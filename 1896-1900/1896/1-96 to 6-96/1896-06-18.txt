The Republican Convention completed its organization to-day, Judge Thura
ton of Nebraska entering upon his duties as permanent chairman. The commit
tee on credentials reported, recommending that temporary rules as made up by
the National Committee be recognized as those governing the convention.
Hepburn of lowa made a scorching speech in favor of a minority report re
submitting the delegation contests to the committee for investigation. The ma
jority report was adopted by a good majority. The report of the committee
was adopted, and the convention adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The platform will be submitted first in the morning, and Colorado may with
draw from the convention altogether, with a few silver delegates. The next
order of business will be the nomination of a candidate for President and Vice-
President. It is expected that the convention will end its labors to-morrow.

ness. He is a lawyer and resides at Council Bluffs, lowa. Two years ago he made a speech at the Repub
lican Convention of his State that made a most profound impression upon that body. That speech
introduced him to the Republicans of lowa as an orator who has more than rhetoric and , more than
gestures and words. In fact, he delivered his speech from one end to the other almost without ges
tures of any kind. His mere presence and his deep voice gave it all the emphasis it needed. *

ren of expected results considerable
j doubt is expressed as to whether the busi-
ness can be finished before Friday.
At 10 o'clock this morning, the hour set
for meeting, there were not mare than
JOSEPH BENSON FORAKER OF OHIO.
100 delegates in the convention . hall.
Little by little the seats began to fill up,
but it was after half past 10 o'clock be-
fore there was a sufficient attendance to
justify temporary Chairman Fairbanks i:i
opening the session. * ' -'i-'
After a whack of his gavel prayer was
offered. Then a trim-built man arose on
: the east side of the space allowed by dele-
gales. He was dressed in a natty business
suit, and wore closely cropped side whis
kers and beard. .'. u>'
His appearance and nasal twang be-
tokened the Yankee, and his dress indi
j cated a young merchant of the New Eng-
land style. It was Henry Cabot Lodge of
Massachusetts, a United States Senator
j from that State. As spokesman for the
i committee on resolutions, he announced,
amid cheers, that the sub-committee on
resolutions had completed the rough draft
of a platform and hoped to complete its
labors in the afternoon. Further time
was granted the committee.
The report of the committee on perma
nent organization was not ready, and after
a few angry expostulations by a delegate
from Maryland, whose luckless name is
"Mudd," the convention adopted the re-
port. ;"v^.:v';v^
Senator Sewell of New Jersey and
Sereno E. Payne of New York then i
escorted Permanent Chairman Thurs
ton to the platform. The Call's read- J
ers all know that John M. Thurs- I
ton is a Senator from Nebraska. He j
is a tall, sparely built man, wearing a
mustache and spectacles. As the trio
marched down the aisle delegates and
spectators arose and waved flags, hand
kerchiefs and hats. Then Mr. Thurston's
address was delivered in a voice that pen
etrated every corner of the great conven
tion hall. Tremendous applause greeted
his utterances. '."",...â /.,",
The address of the temporary chairman,
Fairbanks, yesterday was * very tame
and tamely delivered in comparison. The
convention did not recover from the frost
of yesterday until Senator Thurman spoke
to-day. His speech was . magnificent. It
aroused the convention 'to a high pitch of
enthusiasm, which continued throughout
the morning's session. ' :. At 11:23 the con
vention took a recess until 2 o'clock.
The officers of the convention, delegates
and spectators were slow in reassembling.
At' 2:25 not more than half the seats in
the convention hall were occupied.
The weather for the past week has been
tolerable, and some days pleasant, and
visitors to the convention had begun to
congratulate themselves that the climate
of St. Louis had been : misrepresented, but
by 2 o'clock it was oppressively warm.
The convention hall is very inferior, both
in comfort and architectural beauty, and
the glorious climate of Missouri was not
in evidence. ../-;\*l .'.' 'â '.'
An amusing, incident occurred at the
main door of the convention hall. A tall,
gaunt, spectacled individual, with a bundle
of newspapers and a big wad of , "copy
paper" under his arm, was standing before
the door set aside for officers of the con
vention, distinguished guests and press
reporters, looking like a poor boy \at a
frolic "They won't let me in." said he,
appealing plaintively to a Call corre
spondent, who was properly badged and
ticketed for, admission. ' " "" '
"This is Senator Ingalis of Kansas,"
explained the correspondent. The careful
doorkeeper then made obsequious and
profuse apologies and John J. Ingalis,
once a shining light of: the great Republi
can party,; once an ornament of the Senate
of the United States, wiggled his passage
through the crowded doorway and taking
a seat in '. the j press 1 gallery surrounded by
his fellow newspaper workers, spread his
' paper and sharpened' his pencil prepara
tory to commencing his syndicate reports.
' This incident was commented upon as a
remarkable and pathetic illustration â¢of
the irony of fate. The Sunflower orator,
the pride of Kansas, was a few years ago a
leader of the Senate, yet to-day as a scribe
without proper credentials he was denied
admission to the National Republican
Convention until vouched for by a fellow
reporter. \il 'â 
The hands of the great clock pointed to
2:30 and the immense brass band had
blown and pounded itself warm and
weary. About three-fourths of the chairs
in the convention hall were occupied.
The hall then began to fill up rapidly, and
at 2:40 o'clock, when the convention was
called to order, every available seat on the
! floor and in the galleries was occupied.
Then followed the chaplain's prayer, at
the close of which an enthusiastic and ir-
reverent individual in the gallery cried
| "hip, hip, hurrah!" '-".' *
â¢ Judge Denny of Lexington then pre-
I sented Chairman Thurston with a gavel
carved out of the wood of one of Henry
Clay's old ash trees, planted by Mr. Clay
on his farm at Ashland, Ky. Mr. Madden
of Chicago also offered a gavel of oak
! wood, which he explained was fashioned
from an oak plank of Abraham Lincoln's
primitive dwelling-bouse.
The report of the committee on cre
i dentials was then submitted, after which
Congressman Hepburn took the platform
I to offer the minority report of that com
{ mittee. The lowan is a man of command
: ing presence, and as he stepped to the
i front he was recognized by delegates and
' spectators. His purpose being surmised.

CONVENTION HALL, SACRAMENTO.
Cal., June 17.â Chairman Gould's first rap
of the gavel was not heard in the conven
tion at 11 o'clock this morning, though 9
o'clock had been the hour set for calling it
to order. Gould evidently feared that the
Buckley people had repeated their trick of
yesterday and had taken seats in the Junta
reservation, for he requested all delegates
who could not find seats in the places
assigned them to report to the chairman
and he would . see that they were given
their seats, but no complaints were forth
coming. '*" '
The report of the committee on creden
tials was called for, and was read by the
chairman of the committee, Miles Wallace
of Madera. ...It provided for the seating of
A. R. Baum,- George W. Dennis Jr., H. W.
Bradley and Fred-Wild in the contest
from Alameda ; Township and. of W.B.
White from the Third Ward of j Oakland.
It also, as was expected by every one con
versant with the situation, seated the en
.tire Junta delegation.
At its - conclusion Battersby, one of the
repudiated Democratic delegates from San
Francisco, attracted the attention of the
chairman by his frantic gesticulations in
the neighborhood of the Seventh District
delegation and secured recognition. Be
fore the chairman had time to realize that
he had conceded the floor to a would-be
firebrand Battersby had hurled this defi
ance at the Junta:
"We have been put out of the conven
tion, and now we give you your freedom to
elect your ticket in San. Francisco." .
A. J. Clunie of Solano, amid laughter
over his migratory propensities, movad
that all the portion of the report referring
to San Francisco be stricken out and that
the members of both factions be given a
half vote each. j;K;V
There was no second to the amendment,
and it was in danger of dying of neglect
when James H. O'Brien of Santa Cruz,
better known as an anti-Junta man from
San Francisco, came to the rescue with a
second. This gave Clunie the opportunity
to speak. He promised the support of his
San Francisco delegation to the National
ticket, whether the delegation was given
seats or not, but carefully avoided all ref

"We have had so many shutoffs that I

His address in full was as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
, tionâAt the outset ol the few remarks that
j I intend to make . I desire to repudiate the
; statements that have gone forth that the San
j Francisco delegation of which I am a member
: intends to bolt the Democratic party no mat
: ter, what the decision you gentlemen arrive at.
| That no matter whether you may turn us front
! this hall 'or may seat us with half a vote in
j this convention, we desire to 'say that we will
j go back to San Francisco - and no matter what
i yon do we will work earnestlyâwork morning,
i noon and nightâ for the success of the man
I nominated at Chicago on the Democratic plat
i form for President of the | United States. [Ap-
I plause.] . .;r^-;.-,l; : ':'â ::-â .]_-'. ;'Ytiisi.r^\ j- ':-;. â¢
I* want to come here and repudiate the state-
I ment that has gone forth that this delegation
â  which comes from San Francisco is under the
j control or domination of Christopher Buckley
ior any other man or set of men. I want to say
I that tnis delegation comes here headed by it*
i chairman, and I for one, and speaking for the
j delegation, say that we are here to-day under
i the leadership of that gallant and noble Demo
| crat; the Hon. James I. Stanton, the present
j Railroad Commissioner of the State of Cali
\ fornia. [Applause].
| So far as the personal matter of sitting with
1 you in this convention is concerned â of asso
| ciating with you, gentlemenâ course we
1 recognize it as a great pleasure; but we of this
| delegation who come from San Francisco are
at a great disadvantage. We left our places of
! business and our families, and we come here
j simply out of our love for the Democratic
; party; and I assure you it would have been
' much more pleasant not to come, if we did
j not believe that the Democratic party of San
I Francisco should be harmonized and not torn
j asunder by the factions that have arisen in
j that City.
San Francisco is the -banner Democratic
i county of this State; it is the county which, at
i the last election, when the people of the in2

[Sketched by a "Call" artist. I M
terior of the State abandoned the Democratic j
party, when they abandoned to a large extent
the candidacy of Mr. Budd, that is the county
of the State that gave to him for Governor of
the State a plurality of almost 11,000,
Now, then, the delegation that I am repre
senting here to-day made the fight for Mr. I
Budd in San Francisco; we all participated in i
in it, and the chairmen of this convention, |
Mr. Gould, must say to you, that in every bat
tle of that campaign, whenever the call was
made, the San Francisco Democracy responded
to his call, and as the result of that action this
large majority was rolled up.
There are great matters here to be considered j
by the party and I appeal to you to harmonize
us, to let us vote on these questions. Don't
drive us out of the party and you will get as
large a plurality for your nominee for Presi
dent as you did for Mr. Budd, but each one of
us will go back and take oft* his coat and roil
up as large a one for any one they may nomi
nate, no matter who he may be.
There is another matter of which I wish to i
speak. Two years ago this State Convention '
adopted a platform on the railroad question,
in which you, gentlemen, made the candidates
for the office of Railroad Commissioner accept
a pledge that in the event of their election
they would reduce fares on the Souther i Pa
cific 25 per cent. I want to call your atten
tion to the fact that for the first time in seven
teen yearsâ that for the first time since the
adoption of the new constitutionâ a commis
sioner was elected on such a platform, and I
want to call the attention of the farmers of the
State to the fact that the first fight that came
before that commission was a fight on their
behalf; I want to call your attention to the
fact that every farmer in the State of California
was interested in that matter; 1 want to call |
your attention to the fact that the eyes of every j
farmer in the State were turned toward this i
commission, to see whether or not they would
obey the behests of the Democratic party and
give to the farmers the relief to which they
were entitled; to the fact that when your eyes
were turned there the same attacks were made
then as now upon that commission. The state
ment was hurled broadcast to the world that j
the Hon. James I. Stanton was under the con- j
trol of Buckley, and that the farmers would
not receive from him the support to which
they were entitled.
That statement was made during the cam
paign, and in the face of that statement before
the election he was elected by the voters of j
the Democratic party of San Francisco by a j
plurality of over 2500. In the face of that j
statement, this man not only took the pledge i
to reduce fares 8 per cent, but he took^he
pledge of the Democratic platform and intro- â 
duced it as the order which was finally made;
and as a reward of his honesty and as a reward
of his integrity, he comes to-day before the
Democratic party of the State of California,
and he says to you: jjpfffi
"Gentlemen, the statements that are being
made here that this delegation is controlled
by Mr. Buckley are false. I give you my word
for it. I tell you that they represent the bone
and sinew of the Democratic party of Califor- j
nia; that they ere the Democracy of the City I
and County of San Francisco."
In the face of that statement the statements
of irresponsible persons are taken, and that
man who redeemed your party and saved the
State of California for you for the Democratic
partyâ that man is to be turned out of this
convention and is told to go back. The Demo
cratic party of this State says: "We won't ac
cept your word as. against the word of irre
sponsible persons in the State."
I say to you, gentleman, that you can't
afford to do it. I say to you, farmers, that
when the bread and butter for families was
concerned you did not find him false, you did
not find him recreant, you found him standing
on your side; you found him giving the relief
you asked, and now, when he is here present
ing his word to you in the interests of the
Democratic party of this State, I ask : Can you
afford to turn him out?
Now, I want to say another thing. It is
bad for Democrats to be always fighting; it is
bad enough to fight the enemy on election
day. Why shouldn't every man here want to
harmonize?
I was before the committee on credentials
last night, and there was some statement made
about our delegates not being bound by the
action of this convention. Let me say, we
want to be bound so far as the National plat
form is concerned. Now, as far as municipal
parties are concerned, if the representatives of
the Junta are up here trying to drag municipal
politics into the State Convention I say the
Democracy should repudiate it. What dif
ference does it make to us who the Tax Collec
tor of San Francisco is? We want to place in
the halls of Congress men whom we know to be
friends of the people and friends of all those
great issues recognized by the Democratic
party. What difference does it make who is
dogcatcher or poundmaster or Tax Collector of
the City of San Francisco?
This delegation has been misrepresented in
a great many things..' I say they stand to-day
pleaged on all the questione that can come be
fore this body, and they have instructed Dr.
Stanton to vote for them as a unit on every
question that can come before this body. And
the main question on which Dr. Stanton is in
structed is the free and unlimited coinage of
silver.
Now, gentlemen, that is one issue that con
cerns the people of the United States at the
present time to a greater extent than any other
issue that can come before you.
The chair Mr. Clunie, you are not
speaking to the question.
Clunie â Well, if you shut me offâ we
have had a great many sbut-offs hereâ l
must stand it. I shan't appeal from your
ruling. -^'^^aSSSH
Clitus Barbour came forth to reply to
Clunie. Ho, got along nicely until he
wandered off to St. Louis and on among
the Eastern bondholders, and then he got
yanked back to the report of the commit
tee on credentials. He spoke of the Re
publican National Convention, "about
which the thunders and lightnings' are
playing," and Chairman Gould called him
back to the question. Barbour at once got
in on the lightnings again and the chair
man rapped him down and the convention..
laughed. Then Barbour gave Cleveland
a dig by a reference to the "big bond syn
dicates," and that raised the ire of Charles
Wesley Reed, who yelled, "Stick to the
question." ' 'â¢
"Mr. Barbour, you will have to confine
yourself to the question," said the chair
man again, and Barbour soon closed a de
bate that was quite uncalled for as every
body knew how he was going to vote. Mr.
Barbour's remarks were as follows:
I think Mr. Gould knows that, so far as I am
concerned, I am his personal friend, but I
want to state to you delegates, so that you will
understand our position, that on these ques
tions we are pledged that no outside interest,
no matter what it could be, could change it,
bebause we have taken a pledge, first, on free
silver, and, second, against the funding bill,
and on this question we have taken the resolu
tions of. the San Francisco Daily Examiner
and have adopted them word for word as our
pledge; and we stand here pledged to-day for
delegates at large to Hon. Stephen M. White,
Hon. James G. Maguire and Hon. W. W. Poote.
Now, gentlemen, I have taken up enough of
your time. I believe that you are "fair men,
and I say to you that, no matter how you de
cide this question, we will give to every
principle of Democracy all the support we
can, also to every candidate nominated; but
we hope that you will not send us back with
out a little encouragement; that you may say
tons, "Boys, go ahead; roll up your majority
and give it to our nominee, whoever he may
be"; without giving us the recognition that
justice requires.
I came up to this convention as a Democratâ
as a full-grown Democratâ 16 to 1 Democrat.
I oppose the motion of the gentleman to re
duce me to the condition of half a Democrat.
I am perfectly willing to stand by the proposi
tion made from the first time that any contest
arose among us, to submit ourselves to the
jurisdiction of the authorities of the Demo
cratic party. I proposed it at the time before
your State Central Committeeâ the time an
appeal was presented to this convention
say who constituted and represented the
Democratic party of San Francisco; and if the
verdict should De against us I stood ready to
yield the right of wjy to the gentleman from
Solano and his friends, and that if it should be
for us he would make no interference and no
interruption to the further control of the
Democratic organization of San Francisco.
Now, the offers of the gentlemen are extremely
generous here, and I do not propose to speak
in unklndness now about any of them, for they
are good Democratsâ good Democrats, per
haps, as I amâ and 1 recognize the fact. I
would not take one laurel from the brow of
their chairman, the Hon. James I. Stanton, and
if Mr. Stanton wants my proxy I will give it to
him now cheerfully.
It is not, gentlemen, a question of harmon
izing the. Democratic party of San Francisco,
because harmony is bound to ensue among the
Democrats there. They will bow to the judg
ment of the majority, as declared by the su
preme and highest authority, and will work
together harmoniously when Democratic suc
cess is imperiled. It rests with them whether
they will continue to defy authority and arro
gate to themselves the right to go back and
represent the Democracy of San Francisco, not

only as to National politics, but as to munici
pal politics; lor I assure you, gentlemen, they
are so bound together that you can't say you
are a Democrat for one and not for the other.
Now, gentlemen, there are many | considera
tions which ought to bring you into the fold
with us. We i believe alike. We are going to
make a platform you will ail indorse. We will
declare for free silver; we will pronounce
against secret politico-religious societies. [Ap
plause. ]
Why should we stand out and fight? I ask
you to observe how the Democratic heart is be
ing stirred and how the Democratic spirit is
being uplifted in these United States against
all blandishments of the money power, plac
ing the Democratic party where Andrew Jack- j
son placed it in a great battle against the
money power that was then spreading its
tentacles all over the industries of the United
States. ,\ ;.:;;-
The chairâ gentleman is not speak
ing to the question.
Barbourâ l sometimes go a little way to
bring around my point and that is the
proposition. Now, as I say you will see
the lightnings playing around over that
convention at St. Louis the lightnings of
public indignation. At best .thfey bow
down before the golden calf and that
lightning of indignation will be followed
by the thunders of disgust of the Ameri
can people.
The speaker was called to order and re
marked : "If you do not think the trusts
are behind the Republican candidate you
can think so. They have been behind
Presidents and bond syndicates "
"Speak to the question," shouted C. W. â¢
Reed, and the chairman again called the
speaker to order. The convention did not
want to hear any more speeches and
yelled: "Question." Ciunie's amend
ment got a respectable little bunch of
ayes and then the report was almost
unanimously adopted.
The report of the committee on order of
business was presented by. De Vries of
Stockton, as published this morning in
The Call. Its chief features are the ap
pointment by the chair of a committee of
thirty-five on platform and resolutions;
that all resolutions be offered without
debate; the report of the committee on
platform and resolutions; the election of
four <Jelegates-at-large, and four alter
nates; the selection of two Presiden
tial electors at large and two alter
nates; reports of the district selec
tions for delegates and alternates to

Committee, including two members from
each Congressional district and one from
each Assembly district or county the
appointment by the chairman of twenty
members at large of the State Central
Committee; that the State Central Com
mittee be empowered to adopt a constitu
tion.; that it take steps to incorporate the
party organization ; that all delegates to
the National Convention and Presidential
electors pledge themselves before the con
vention to support only nominees in har
mony with the platform adopted.
Henry Hogan of Napa at once offered a
resolution and asked that it might be
adopted without reference. It was a
tribute to the late Denis Spencer and was
quickly adopted by a rising vote of the
convention. It was as follows: -
. Whebeas, In the course of events death has
claimed the soul of- Denis Spencer; and
whereas, the State of California has sustained
thereby a lasting loss; and whereas, the De
mocracy now misses a wise counselor, , a

(except as to his financial policy) and of
the administration of Governor Budd ; the
plank denouncing the American Protec
tive Association ; the declaration in favor
of the income tax, notwithstanding the
Supreme Court of the. United States, were
all wildly applauded.
' C. Wesley Reed presented a minority re-
port on the financial plank, which in
| dorsed Cleveland without qualification,
I setting up the gold standard. Its reading
I was mildly applauded.
In speaking for his resolution Reed said
(he took great pleasure in standing up for
I Cleveland when other Democrats were de-
nouncing him! Cleveland had said what
he would do before he was elected, and he
had kept his pledge.
California more than any other State
should indorse his policy ; California had re-
fused to accept paper money when the rest
of the Nation accepted it and her citizens
were termed traitors for so doing. Now
this convention proposed through its
platform to indorse a financial policy that
repudiated all its history on the currency
question.
The applause that broke in on him was
that very faint praise that is akin to dam-
nation. Even his peroration that lauded
l Cleveland without reserve called out but a
) scattered handclap.
The amendment was killed by a vote of
I 417 against, 202 for.
THE GOLD PLANK.
Substitute Submitted by a Minority
of the Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 17. -Follow
ing is the gold plank as offered by the mi
nority of the committee on platform:
The following members of your committee
on platform and resolutions present the fol
lowing minority report as a substitute for the
financial plank of the majority of the com
mittee. E. B. Pond,
J. T. Burke,
De Witt Arnold,
Charles Wesley Reed.
Charles Wesley Reed.
We indorse the administration of President
Cleveland as wise, patriotic and Democratic.
We commend his courage and fidelity In main
taining the financial honor of our country
sacred and unimpaired. We are unqualifiedly
in favor of the present gold standard of values.
We favor the use- of both gold and silver as
money and believe that our Government
should coin and keen in circulatibn as a part
of the circulating medium as large an amount
of silver as can be employed without destroy
ing or threatening to destroy the existing par
ity of value between the unit in gold and the
unit in silver.
We favor tbe retirement of small bills and
gold coin under the value of $10, in order
that silver coins may find a certain and gen
eral circulation. "1.:; â¢
We arc opposed to a descent to monometal
lism, and particularly to a silver monometal
lism with its depreciated and depreciating
standard of values. We are firmly convinced
that the free and unlimited coinage of silver
by our Government at a' ratio of 16 to 1, with
out co-operation on the part of the other great
commercial natious of the world, would re
duce this country to a condition of silver
monometallism, entailing upon ns a financial
panic and commercial and industrial disaster.
We are utterly and irrevocably opposed to
the adoption of any such policy. California is
one of the great gold-producing States of the
world. f< From tradition and practice she is
wedded to the gold standard. The obligations
of our people are payable only in United States
gold coin, and the withdrawal of gold from our
currency (the Inevitable result of free silver at
16 to 1) will merely render it more difficult
for California debtors to pay their debts.
CLUNIE MUST WAIT.
Congressional Nomination In the
Fifth Postponed.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 17.â
Fifth District Convention met at once after
the adjournment of the morning session
in the north end of the pavilion. Its chief
result was a blow to Clunie and the tem
porary salvation of Joseph P. Kelly by a
postponement of the Congressional nomi-
nation until July 20 at Redwood City. The
withdrawal of Schellar of San Jose left
only Clunie and Kelly in the fight.
Uesford of Napa, it transpired yesterday,
has his eye on the Congressional nomina
tion in the Fifth. Gesford is said to have
just come to the city, and to be willing to
take the nomination before he is regis
tered. However Gesford is not yet openly
I in the fight. j
Clunie and Kelly have been doing lively
hustling. Clunie night before last secured
the indorsement of ; the, Santa Clara dele
gation, giving him a solid block of twenty
five votes. i He claims most of San Mateo's
six votes. -Â» As forty-nine votes constitute
a majority, Clunie needs about twenty-fiys
of the sixty- seven San Francisco votes.
How the San Francisco vote was divided
to-day nobody knew exactly, but it was '
conceded on all hands that if a nomina
tion was made at the convention to-day
Clunie would be nominated by a consider
able majority. Kelly and his friends knew
this, or were afraid of it, and their policy
was to secure a postponement of the nom
ination, in which they succeeded. % ;>.i
Clunie's supporters tried to force the
nomination to-day.
It may appear strange that they were
not able to do so if they were in a major
ity, but the situation was that while a
majority, may have favored Clunie as be
tween him and Kelly there were a great
many of the delegates' who were not very
enthusiastic about either candidate; and
many of those ready to support Clunie, if .
necessary to vote at all, were inclined to
wait and see if a little time would not de
velop some other candidate whom they
might consider more satisfactory. .
James Denman was made chairman of
the district convention and B. J. Harvey
secretary. A motion to postpone the
nomination for Congress was debated at
considerable length. Max Popper. Eugene
Denprey and others favored it, and Joseph
M.Noueues and other friends of Clunie op
posed it. The proposition to postpone the
Congressional nomination was carried by
a vote of 60 to 44.
Two members-at-large of the State Cer
tral Committee were elected, and the re
sult gave Daegett, Lanigan and Raney one
of the members. Lanigan worked it by
getting in his work early.
He made a combination. ' with Santa
Clara on W. Doyle of San Francisco and
W. P. Veuve of San Jose, and the combi
nation won. James Denman was also
nominated in the convention, but he was
slaughtered for Lanigan's man. Santa
Clara's twenty-three votes went to Doyle,
and the vote stood: Veuve 78, Doyle 70 and
Denman 32.
Ex-Judge Levy said to-night: "It is con
ceded that Mr. Kelly will receive the
nomination, because he is the logical can
didate of the party and individually the
strongest and most popular man in the
district.' The rank and file of the party
are unanimous in their demand for his
nomination. The vote on the nomination
will in all likelihood be about 65 for Kelly
and 35 for Clunie. The district is naturally
in the neighborhood of 6000 Republican."
DAGGETT'S VICTORY.
Many of His Followers Elected
Central Committeemen.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 17.â Dag-
gett achieved a brilliant victory to-day, as
was expected by all who knew the secret
power he had acquired through his own
patronage and hustling and through his
combination with Rainey and Lanigan.
Daggett and his lieutenants, including
the mint forces, Lanigan, Eddie Greaney
and the whole Rainey squad, have been
devoting themselves mainly to this pur-
pose that Daggett may be strong in the
State machine.
In the Fifth District Lanigan won one
of the two committeemen at large by his
successful combination with Santa Clara,
resulting in the election of T. W. Doyle of
San Francisco and W. P. Veuve of San
, Jose. In the Fourth District George T.
Marye and E. B. Pond were named..
Nearly all the Assembly district dele-
gates chose their State Central : Commit

ELECTRIC TR OUBLE AT FERNDALE
Ail Enterprising lountf Wan" With a
Franchise JUixes Up Things. I.
FERNDALE, Cal., June 17.âConsid
erable excitement existed here to-day,
occasioned by the arrest of the represen
tative of the Westinghouse Electric Com
pany of San Francisco. Some time ago a
young man named Nelson secured the
franchise and was successful in placing a
well, equipped j electric plant with about
250 lights in this town, and it was generally
understood that Nelson was backed by an
uncle in San Francisco, whom he claimed
was wealth v. The entire plant was pur
chased by Nelson on credit, and the West
inahouse people, being among the leading
creditors, sent H. D. Scribner here to look
after their interest, and made an attempt
to get possession of tbe dynamos and other
electrical fixtures, claiming them under a
conditional bill of sale.
Scribner was arrested for attempting to
pull down wires and to detach converters
from buildings. The charge is misde
meanor. Holders of mechanics' liens will
enjoin any one from removing any part of
the plant until a settlement is made.
Nelson has left for parts unknown, and
numerous creditors mourn his departure.

Buckleyites Gain Sweet
Revenge by Defeating
Laymance.
FITZGERALD ELECTED A
DELEGATE.
The Alameda Fight Reopened
In the Third District
Convention.
"BUSINESS MEN" USE THEIR
KNIVES.
Triumph of the Daggett-Irish Faction
Over .Their Old.Time
Enemies.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. June 17.â There
was sweet revenee for the enemies of W.
W. Foote, when M. J. Laymance was
â¢ beaten by Fitzgerald as delegate to the
National Convention in the Third District
Convention in the middle of the after
noon. They were not alone, the old
fighters on the other side of the vendetta,
who thanked heaven with an eager joy â
the Daggett-Irish crowd who have so long
been the under dogs.
It was sweet to the Buckleyites, and
sweet it was to the enemies of Gould from
Santa Clara, from Los Angeles and else
where. To tbe Buckleyites it was the one
blessed thing the convention had brought
them. The victory was mainly their.*, for
they hate Laymance, and solely on Foote's
account- They knifed Laymance that
Foote might feel the blade. Foote had
made Laymance's fight bis own. He bad
declared that he stayed in the Alameda
County fight because Laymance was his
friend. He ahared in the brief joy that
followed Laymance's majority in the Ala-
meda delegation.
Laymance's ambition to beat Fitzgerald
for delegate was tbe one great issue in the
fierce contest. Since Foote finally de
clared for Gould, no curses have been too
fierce for the Buckleyites. They had for
months made "Billy" Foote their hero;
had cheered every mention of his name in
their meetings; had indorsed him time
and again for delegate-:>t-large, and had
whooped him up in every possible way.
There is no questioning the fact that the
Buckleyites piled into Foote's fight in
Alameda County, and that they sent
nearly 200 experienced district primary
workers with competent managers over to
the primary. They freely offer affidavits
full of specific times, places and names,
and the men who went are loudly declar
ing what they did.
- This army of the San Francisco "push"
stood off the similar Mint "push" which
went over under Daegeit'fe orders to help
Fitzgerald. These men reported to the {
bosses who handled the' Foote-Laymance
fight. There is no testimony that Foote i
personally entered into any bargain, but
it is declared that they expected Foote's
support in the convention.
So it is no wonder the Buckleyites used
as a knife all the influence th?y had left
when they were beaten. It needed but
few votes to turn the scale and balance
any advantage Laymance eained through
Foote's understanding with Gould.
The same influence was visibly played |
during the day and evening to .defeat j
Foote for delegate at large. The Buckley
ites sought to turn their friends in the â â 
Los Angeles, Santa Clara and other dele
gations to the Daggett Gould-McNab ,
ticket, which included Geary and Cole- i
man and left out Foote.
John P. Irish blessed the day that de
feated Laymance and even took for bliss
ful joy the broiling sunshine, for in his
view right and the nobility of Alameda's
Democracy triumphed when Foote meta
phorically lay low in Laymance's known
summer suit. He spoke frankly and with
a candid air about the somewhat sensa
tional victory of Fitzgerald, of John P.
Irish and of Daggett.
"It retires Mr. Laymance from Alameda
County politics," said Mr. Irish this even
ing. "It is a stinging rebuke of the crim
inal methods he has long pursued in Ala
meda County to the disfranchisement of
every decent man in the party. It is also
a distinct rebuke to his aiders, abettors ,
and co-conspirators against decency and
fairnessâ W. Foote and Frank J. Mof
fitt. Foote has appeared at all times
against the rights of the Democracy in his
own county and against a'l that is right
and fair in politics in Alameda County."
Mr. Irish talked of Foote's flop to Gould
quite as .frankly, and said freely what
prominent Buckleyites had recently told
him about their deal with Foote.
"He didn't bring to Mr. Gould a vote,"
Irish asserted.. "Every decent man in the
convention believes that he was pledged
to Buckley and betrayed him, and while
these decent men may accept Mr. Foote's
companionship, they do it as the decent
public in Great Britain receives that of
Benedict Arnold. They accept the treas
ure but despise the traitor.
"It is not to be forgotton that less than
a week ago he and his, negro partner,
Dennis, boasted that a resolution was
drawn to read John Daggett oat of the
party. But Mr. Foote comes to Sacra
mento, betrays Buckley and surrenders to
Daggett without condition, marches in his
procession and keeps time to Daggett's
brass band."
''Buckley's friendsâ some of the more
gentlemanly of âasked me to take a
proxy and make their fight in the conven
tion, and when I asked why I should make
Buckley's fight, they said: 'We sent men
into Alameda County to win Foote's fight
at the primaries against Fitzgerald, on the
positive promise that Foote would make
our tight here, and now he has played
us.' To this I answered: 'When I
helped Foote win in Alameda County you
damaged my friend Fitzgerald. Accord
ing to your own story, you tied up with a
liar, and you must stay with him ; I can- :
not help you.'
"They offered to go before the committee
on credentials and make affidavits to all
they said, giving times, places and names
regarding the sending over of about 200
men who were used by Foote's managers."
Mr. Irish happened to speak of Foote's
silver leanings. Said he: â¢
"Yes, he is another one of them. If the
party was for polygamy he would declare
that he had been a polygamist from his
boyhood; that anybody who disputed it
was a cursed liar, and that polygamy was
one of the vital principles of the same old
Jeffersonian Democracy."
The Third Congressional Democratic
Convention of California went into session
this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock for the pur
pose of electing delegates to the National
Convention. Edward E. Leake of Yolo
was appointed chairman and H. F. Sure
was elected to the position of secretary.
When the roll was called it was found that
Philip Kalb of the Third District was
absent, and a motion was made by H. C.
McPike that a majority of the Alameda
delegation be allowed to cast a vote for the
absent delegate, but after a spirited argu
ment pro and con the motion was lost.
G. W. Dennis of Alameda then moved
that the election of delegates for the Na
tiDnal Convention be proceeded with.
M. 11. Nurse of Yolo placed Edward E.
Leake of the same county in nomination.
W. W. Foote arose, and after seconding
Mr. Leake's nomination, nominated M. J.
Laymance of Alameda.
"Without doubt the entire Alameda
delegation is in favor of the election of
Laymance," said Mr. Foote, "and 1 am in
hopes that the delegates from tbe outside
counties will consider the wishes of Ala
meda's delegation, and select the gentle
man I have named as a delegate to the
National Convention."
This argument, however, had but little
if any effect on the so-called outside dele
gates, and in consequence Laymance was
defeated, it is generally conceded that
Laymance- was beaten by the Buckleyites
and their friends, who did everything they
could to knife Foote's candidate on ac
count of what they call Foote's treachery.
A. J. Clunie and others secured proxies in
the convention, and John McGilligan
threw what Solano votes he could control
against Laymance.
It was then moved and seconded that
the ballot be cast by the secretary for
Leake's election. W. W. Foote seconded
this motion, and it was carried, with the
result that Yolo's popular son was unani
mously chosen as a delegate to the
National Convention. -.:â¢'/
. J. R. Glascock of Alameda, with a few
chosen words, then placed Robert Fitz
gerald in nomination as opponent to M.
J. Laymance. No time was wasted in
argumentative speech, and the voting to .
decide which of the two contestants
should go to Chicago began without delay.
The balloting was soon concluded with
the following result:

but that gentleman finally settled the ques
tion by naming; M. A. Laymance, his
opponent, for the position as alternate
from the Third Congresional District. Mr.
Laymance, however, declined to accept
and sent the following letter to the chair
man of the Third District Convention:

AN EASTERN VICTORY.
How J. H. Manley Regards the
Adoption of a Gold Standard.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 17.â J. H. Man
ley made the following statement to-night :
"The Eastern Republicans ' have won a
great victory in this convention in forcing
the convention to accept and declare for
the maintenance of the gold standard. *
"The delegates from the New England
States, from New York, from New Jersey,
from Pennsylvania, and, it should be said
to their credit, from some of the extreme
Northwestern States, demanded that the
money question should be met squarely
and the issue presented fairly and honestly
to the people. :)' \ -.'; _",,.'â¢ .'-
"They insisted that the resolutions
should explicitly declare against the free
coinage of silver, except by international
agreement with the leading nations of the
world; that the present gold standard
should be maintained.
"They did not care what else was said,
provided the convention was emphatic in
its. expressions upon these two main
points. The party has taken a stand for
the right, no matter what the result may
be, but in this case to be right will be pop
ular."
WHITNEY IS APPEALED TO
Urged to Abandon, His Trip
Abroad and Go to

New York's Democratic Leaders Hope
to Stem the Free Silver
Tide.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N. V., June 17.â
Senator David B. Hill stopped over in
Poughkeepsie last evening on bis way to
Albany and had a conference with
Chairman Hinkley of the Democratic State
Committee. Mr. Hinkley. showed Senator
Hill a copy of a telegram which he sent
to William C. Whitney a few days ago.
Senator Hill said he fully acquiesced in
the dispatch, which was as follows:
Can you not reconsider your determination
to go abroad and instead go as a delegate-at
large to our National Convention? lam cot
of the opinion that the fight for sound money
is as hopeless as it possibly appears to you. We
understood when our friends first asked you to
go to Chicago that you partially agreed to do
so, and we trust that you will not disappoint
us. ' 1 assure you of a unanimous election as
delegate-at-large if you accept, and earnestly
enter the fight, which may yet be won for
sound money.
WILL STAY AT HOME.
Whitney Is Persuaded to Take a Hand
,V:.::-: at Chicago.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 17.â William
C. Whitney, who bad taken passage for
Europe on the Teutonic, which sailed for
Europe this morning, said this forenoon:
"I decided late last night to remain at
home and go to the convention at Chicago.
I don't think that I can help matters
much, but I have yielded to the requests of
many friends, who have been at me for
several weeks to be present when the con
vention meets.
â  All this muddle in the party has got
into it over the silver question and may, in
my opinion, result in its disruption, and if
I can be of assistance to those . who were
instrumental in helping to reform matters
in 1892 I shall '.be glad to do so. Nothing
said by Mr. Cleveland has influenced me,
as I have not heard from him directly or
indirectly. .His renomination is, to my
mind, impossible."
The sudden changes in Mr. Whitney's
plans are regarded as an indication that
the Democrats of the East anticipate one
of the hardest fights in the history of the
party. David B. Hill, Senator Gorman,
ex-Senator Matthew Ransom and Colonel
James Murdock held a long conference
with Mr. .Whitney yesterday afternoon.
GORMAN AS A DELEGATE.
The Marylana Senator Mas â  Suddenly
Changed His Mind.
BALTIMORE, Mb., June 17.â The state-
that William C. Whitney has decided to
postpone his trip to Europe in order to
take part in the deliberations of the Dem
ocratic National Convention, caused the
statement this afternoon that Senator Gor-
man, too, would be a participant in 'the
Chicago debate of gold vs. silver. The
Senator, it is said, will accept the vacant
position as delegate at large created by the
declination of Charles C. Homer to serve
in that capacity.
Senator Gorman has repeatedly asserted
that he would not go to Chicago, but the'
impending fight over the financial plank
of the platform to be adopted there has, it
is claimed, caused him to change his plans.

AGAINST THE FUNDING BIIjLi.
Resolved, That the Democratic party of the State of California resents the inter
ference in the politics of this State of the Southern Pacific of Kentucky; that we
denounce the system of "boss" politics largely created and fostered by that corpo
ration, which has corrupted public men and public life, and under which only
those who find favor in the eyes of the corporation and stand ready to do its
bidding have held office. Under this influence our youths have been taught that
I political principle and political duty may be justly traded off for personal gain and
preferment at the hands of the "boss" to the almost entire destruction â  of that
healthy public spirit without which no Government of the people can hope to
continue in existence. â '.â  'â 'â¢'. â '.':â¢' -â¢â¢â /â¢""â¢::.
That we are unalterably opposed to the funding bill now pending in the Con
gress of the United States, or to any other similar measure, and we demand that
the Southern Pacific Company and all other corporations subsidized by the Govern
ment be compelled to fulfill' their obligations in the same way thatl private debtors
are compelled to liquidate theirs; in other words, we are opposed to any system
which will permit the subsidizing of Federal corporations jo pay their interest
bearing debt at the rate of 2 per cent, while the Government itself is compelled to
pay 3V-2 per cent for money with which to carry on the public business. '
We request our delegation, elected by this convention to "the coming National
Convention, to use their influence and energies to have the above-mentioned plank
inserted in the platform to be adopted at Chicago by the Democratic National
Convention.
That the Democratic party of California, in convention assembled, recognizes
with pride and satisfaction the able, patriotic and distinguished services of Senator
Stephen M. White and Congressman J. G. Maguire, and does hereby extend to them
its grateful acknowledgment of the same, and particularly their opposition to the
funding bill and their conspicuous and valuable services, in behalf of" a free harbor
for Southern California. ' v^ v,? A

depressed by reason of our commercial isolation and our inability to '> compete in
the markets of the world while handicapped by the ten thousand miles of perilous
ocean navigation. . \r:''~-'- â â  >";i
That the construction of the Nicaragua maritime canal is of the greatest politi
cal and commercial importance to our country, and especially to the Pacific Coast
States, and we respectfully urge the Democratic National Convention to pronounce
distinctly in favor of taking such action by Congress as will \ provide for its early
construction under National auspices; but we are opposed to a subsidy beiug
granted to any corporation for that purpose. 'â¢[ -.'l*'v
Resolved, That the Democrats of California appreciate the noble efforts of .the
sturdy patriot and statesman, Senator J. T. Morgan of Alabama, for his able and
indefatigable struggle in the interests of the Pacific Coast and the Nation in oppo
sition to the funding bill infamy. V \'^'^'" ".1-f~-""'-" '"'â¢':

efforts to equalize and reduce fares and freights, and point with pride to their

INDORSEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.
Resolved, That, we hereby indorse the administration of President Cleveland,
except as to his financial policy. His foreign policy has been wise, statesmanlike
and patriotic, and his domestic policy has been pure and incorruptible.
INDORSEMENT OP GOVERNOR BUDD.
Resolved, That we indorse the administration of Governor Budd and earnestly
commend his vigorous efforts to enforce economy and efficiency :in the public
service, and .congratulate the taxpayers in the great saving he has made in the
cost of administering the public institutions of the State. Â
PERSONAL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
Resolved, That the Democratic party is the defender of the unabridged, funda
mental right of religious freedom guaranteed every citizen by section 3, article VI
of the National constitution, which declares that "no religious test shall ever be
required as a qualification to any office of. public trust under the United States,"
and holds all secret political societies as mischievous in purpose and contrary to
the spirit of republican institutions, a democratic form of government, the con
stitution of the United States and of the State of California. :> I'Vii
As the upholder of -the constitution and the civil, religious and personal rights
it guarantees, the Democratic party denounces the methods and aims of the secret
political organization miscalled "the American Protective Association," for having
religious proscription as its basis and the exaction of religious tests as a qualifica
tion to office for its rule of action. " r \lÂ£Â£&fe :.V\ "-;; ifioV- -;A 'â â â 
Resolved, That we hereby denounce the action of the Republican party for rais
ing a false issue of the possibility of State aid being granted to sectarian schools,
and we reaffirm our loyalty to the constitution of California in section 8, article
IX, which declares that public money shall ever be appropriated for the sup-
port of any sectarian or denominational school, or any school not under the ex
clusive control of the officers of the public schools; nor shall any sectarian or
denominational doctrine be taught, or instruction therein be permitted, directly
or indirectly, in any of the common schools of this State." ',' -V
MINING AND NAVIGATION,
Resolved, That we congratulate the Democratic party and the people of the
State of California on the fact that by the legislation initiated by the Democratic
party under the platforms of our conventions, held resrjectively in ,1890 and 1892,
the mining industry in all its branches has received an impetus which to-day gives
it a leading position in the development and progress of the State. We favor the
continuation of the work so auspiciously commenced, and recommend continued
aid by the National and State Governments on the lines laid down in the law, to
' the end that all interests involved be fully and adequately protected, and each
given the recognition demanded by. the important bearing; each has upon the
general welfare. We believe in fostering the mining industry in all its branches
and favor the rehabilitation of hydraulic mining wherever it can be carried on
without material injury to any other industry. The preservation of the naviga
bility of the California rivers is of the greatest importance to the commerce of the
State, and we therefore urge upon our delegations in Congress the importance of
securing liberal Government appropriations for the improvement and maintenance
of the navigability of our rivers and for the preservation of the ; San Francisco bay
and harbor. We pledge the utmost endeavors of our delegation in Congress in tbe
efforts to place the improvement of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers under
the contract system.

PROTECTION OP LABOR,.
PROTECTION OP LABOR.
- ' ' .-:" -. ? - .'â 
Resolved, That we are proud to record the fact that the present Democratic ad
ministration in the State of California has accomplished more for the cause of
labor than any previous administration { that many of the evils and hardships to
which the working classes have been subjected have been removed and abolished
through the intervention of the Department of Labor; that the said classes have
had a department administered in a careful and just manner to which they have
carried their grievances to the end that the wrongs and impositions .upon them
have found speedy redress without fear or favor; and be it further
Resolved, That the Democratic party,, representing the large majority affected
by the domination of capital upon defenseless labor, pledges itself and its standard
bearers to continue in the good work of assisting and protecting those hampered
by the tyrannical acts of capital monopoly; that it is the sense of this convention
that Tabor be placed upon the plane to which it is entitled ;* that legislative action
be had and the laws of the State so framed and enforced that full and adequate pro
tection be extended to its laboring classes where the same is now lacking. ." .'.. ',
- TARIFF AND TAXATION.;
Firstâ reaffirm our adherence to the principles of the tariff platform of the
National Democratic Convention of 1892. .....;â  . /fv . ..
â¢ Secondâ ln view of the universal decrease in the price of all products of labor ';
in this State and in the value of land- and all other property, we believe that jus- !
tice demands a material reduction in the public expenditures. Notwithstanding ;
the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, we adhere to the position
of the last Democratic Congress ) in' favor of an ; income tax and, if necessary,' of I
amending the constitution of the United States so as to obviate tha objection of
the Supreme. Court. '. *; * . .:
Thirdâ poll tax is an illogical and undemocratic tax. It falls chiefly on
wage-earners, out of whose wages it is withheld, while other classes of citizens gen
erally escape from or evade it. Therefore we demand section 12 of the article on :
revenue and taxation in the State constitution be repealed, and our candidates for
the State Legislature are pledged to advocate such amendment.
GOOD ROADS.
The Democratic party of the State of California, appreciating the fact that good
roads are destined to be an important factor in the development of the resources
of our State, in that they facilitate the interchange of products and tend to bind
together all sections, and recognizing further that the movement having in view
the establishment of properly constructed highways has' become '."one of National
importance, we pledge ourselves to the earnest support of such legislative action as
will bring about this beneficial plan of internal improvement. .;
PURE FOOD.
We thoroughly appreciate the great danger to human life through the general
adulteration of food, and, believing that life and health are of paramount import
ance, we pledge ourselves to take such measures as protect both in, every way con
sistent with our form of government.
FREE SPEECH. ;i
We condemn any attempt to override the will of the people as expressed in
the amendment to the law of contempt enacted by the Legislature of 1890, and to
set up the monstrous and un-American doctrine that courts possess an inherent
right to summarily punisa their critics for contempt/ though not committed in
the immediate presence of ; the court while in session, nor tending to actually in
terfere with its proceedings, thus depriving a citizen of bis inalienable constitu
tional right to a fair and impartial trial by jury. We proclaim our unfaltering ad
herence to the principle of free speech and a free press and denounce all insidious
attempts of returning tyranny to gag the one or. shackle the other. -1 J :
WOMEN ARE
DISGUSTED.
Scant Courtesy Accorded
Equal Suffragists by
Democrats.
BRIEF HEARING AND A
DISMISSAL.
Their Resolution Tabled Without
Argument by Builders of
the Platform.
THEY WILL WOBK TO DEFEAT
THE PARTY.
Indignation of the Leaders Expressed
in Caustic Letters to "The
Call."
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 17.â The
delegation of woman suffragists is feeling
deeply disgusted to-night over the cavalier
fashion in which they were bowed out of
the Democratic platform by the commit
tee this afternoon and the convention to
night. . The women had been promised
chivalrous treatment, at least, though not
encouraged to hope that their plank would
be accepted. They deem, as Mrs. Sargent
expresses it, that they were shown scant
courtesy. .
They had prepared to make a strong
showing before the committee on resolu
tions. Tbe committee was in session in
the parlors of the Golden Eagle Hotel
nearly all day. The ladies were admitted
into the august presence during the after
noon.
They found there a solitary woman, with
a solitary and anonymous letter for her
credentials, to combat the statement that
the women of California really desired the
ballot. The letter purported to have been
written by a married woman and explained
its being anonymous by the statement
that the author had written it without the
knowledge of her husband and she
wished to remain under cover so far as he
was concerned as he would not like it.
This letter has caused great merriment
among the woman suffragists. It has, in
fact, aided materially in relieving the
sense of depression otherwise resulting
from the unsatisfactory result of their ef-
forts. They were given a brief hearing,
the woman with the anonymous letter
being allowed as much time as the suf
fragists with . their 40,000 petitioners.
Susan B. Anthony offered the resolution
for the amendment of the constitution. It
was given almost, no discussion by the
committeemen themselves.
Later in the afternoon Wesley Reed
moved for a reconsideration of tho action
laying it on the table, but the noes were
overwhelming. And for this the women
are anything but pleased with Democratic
politics. X number take the occasion to
state their cause to The Call over their
own signatures. Here are the letters :
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
We came up to the convention expecting
nothing, and we got it. The expression
among the delegates was general that their
personal feeling in the matter cut no figure,
that they would vote against woman suffrage
in the hope of catching all that element in the
State which is opposed to it. It was a grand
bid for votes, without any regard to principle.
We were almost overwhelmed with assurances
of the great chivalry with which we were to
be treated by being allowed to appear before
the platform committee,. out as this same con-
sideration was granted to the lowest and
meanest who chose to appear we failed to
recognize any especial chivalry.
On motion of J. T. Burke of San Francisco
our resolution was tabled almost before the
door closed behind us as we left the room. By
thus refusing to vote on it, a minority report
. was prevented, which would have been made
by several on the committee.
We want the Democratic women of the State
to know that we brought up a delegation of as
representative women as could be had in the
State; that, in the face of the most terrible
heat and under the most unpleasant circum
stances, we made the strongest fight that we
were capable of making: that we left no stone
unturned; that we did not spare ourselves any
effort or any fatigue.
There was a stronger power than ourselves
at work, and we were ignominiously defeated.
The campaign is now open; Ida A. Harper.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ :No
one has ever expressed the opinion that the so
called woman's suffrage plank would be
adopted in the Democratic platform. We had
no reason to expect, however, that the matter
would be tabled In committee, without so
much as a hearing in the convention. We
thought there would be a minority report from
the committee, as I know there are a number
of staunch suffragists among the delegates.
Of course, this adverse action will not prevent
any individual from voting according to his
own views at the coming election, but it shuts
the door against the educational work which
we so much depended upon during the autumn
campaign; for, inasmuch as the party has
ignored the question, the newspapers will not
feel bound to discuss it, and as for the orators,'
they will fear to lose a vote should they speak
of it. â 'â¢â¢'
But the educational work will be done by
the great Republican party and the two
smaller. parties, and through their agencies all
will come to understand the question in a
measure at least, for all voters will attend
somewhat upon the meeting of their oppo
nents. We have this great Republican party
and these smaller parties, and that great edu
cational engine, The Call, to champion our
cause. 'y%t--J
Of course, the rank and file of the women of
California cannot consider the Democratic
party 8s their friend. I say that, having refer-'
ence only to the action of the party with re
gard to this matter, and not as to any other of
the doctrines of the party. I am rather sorry
for the Democratic party, for we shall win this
fall and we shall owe our success largely to its
opponents. .. â  Susan B. Anthony.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: I
have to say that I think we have been treated
with scant courtesy by . the convention of
Democrats. Coming here in a body, with a
National organization back of us, we were
scarcely given a hearing. The man at the
head ot the table in the room of the committee
on resolutions, where we made our plea,
looked cross and bored, as though he wished
we were elsewhere. , Our opponents, composed
of one woman and a man, with no backing,
nothing to support them but an anonymous'
letter, were given a fuller hearing than we
were. \ We deserved better at the hands of the
big Democratic party. Mrs. A. A. Sargent.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
In consideration of the delegation which pre
sented the resolution, and in consideration of
the fact that we represented by petition 20,000
voters and 20.000 respectable women over 21;
years of age, we deserved better treatment at
the hands tit the committee on resolutions.
We deserved a vote, to say the least. However,
in a campaign of any sort it is ;of the utmost
importance to know one's friends. All parties
are on record, and we shall go in to win our
fight with no less courage and faith than be
fore. Mrs. E. O. Smith/
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
From all I Had learned prior to our hearing
before the committee, I was not surprised at
the outcome. I regretted it, because I believe
that the principle of woman suffrage is right
and just, and whatever is right and Justin
principle will always work itself out bene
ficently in practice.
There were gentlemen on that committee
who, in their daily lives, do generous things
for the commonwealth. The best thing they
could have done for the uplifting of the com
monwealth would have been to give 'us the
plank in the platform, and thus aid to insure
the ballot for woman. As it is, we still hope
and believe we shall get it in the triumphs of
other parties who believe in the justice of our
claims. \* Sarah B. Cooper.
The platform committee gave the advo
cates of both sides of the women's suffrage
question forty minutes altogether, and
then spent three minutes dismissing the
matter from their minds by chucking it
"on the table." . v^i
The champions of suffrage stayed in the
hall for some time, and then filed into the
crowded parlor when it. was announced
that the woman question was in order.
The committee was working under high
pressure anyway. and there was no dispo
sition to hear long-winded speeches about
equal suffrage. The chairman held a mo
ment's consultation with somebody near
him and announced that each side of the
question would be given twenty minutes,
which they could use if they pleased.
The plank prepared by Susan B. An
thony, which had previously been . sub
mitted to the committee, was read before
time was counted on the ladies. The
plank was as follows:
Believing in the Jeffersonian doctrine that
"governments derive their just powers from
the consent of the governed," the Democratic
party, in convention assembled, hereby ex
presses its approval of constitutional amend
ment No. 11, conferring equal political rights
upon the women of the State.
Mrs. Sargent, chairman of the State or
ganization, made a brief announcement
that the ladies present represented 40,000
men and women of the State of California,
according to the petitions presented. She
introduced Sarah B. Cooper, president of
the eleventh amendment campaign com
mittee, who spoke but a few words.
"We are not going to vote 365 days in the
year and twenty-four hours in the day,"
she said, "so the babies will not be neg
lected."
Mrs. Alice Stocker of Alameda said that
it was time enough for the ladies to take a
partisan attitude when that was called tor.
Vigorous Miss Hay, who rather managed
the discussion on her side, was careful to
keep each lady strictly within bounds and
to call her down when time was up. Most
of them were called to time before they
had fairly begun.
"The time is up," she said, interrupting
Mrs. Stocker, and then some gallant Dem
ocrat suggested that the time be extended
ten minutes. Plucky Miss Hay cour
teously and nicely declined the favor, and
Mrs. E. O. Smith of San Jose followed
Mrs. Stocker. She made an exceedingly
bright and clever little speech, and when
she closed by referring 'to the Democratic
party as "the party of the people," and
saying, "We are the people; come close
to us," she was enthusiastically applauded.
Mrs. Ida Harper talked for about two
minutes from the standpoint of party ex
pediency. She said that, as chairman of
the State press committee, she had re
ceived in three months 3000 clippings from
California newspapers on the suffrage
question, and that three-fourths of them
were in favor of suffrage.
"We do not ask indorsement of this
party because we believe that the amend
ment cannot be carried without it," she
said. "It will require about 140,000 votes
to carry the measure, if all voters vote one
way or the other. It will be conceded
that 10,000 Prohibition votes will support
us. The Populist vote two years ago was
about 55,000, and that vote will be nearly
solid for us. Of the Republican vote of
about 178,000, two-thirds of it will be in
our favor; but. the largest vote of any
amendment two years ago was 102,000.
We ask the indorsement for the sake of
the Democratic women of California."
. "Time is up," said Miss Hay.
â¢'Do not force us into partisan politics"
said Miss Harper, sitting down.
Mrs. Sargent announced that they would
keep the remaining few minutes of their
time for their closing argument, and the
anti-suffragists were invited to present
their case.
Mrs." Carrie Murray, chairman of the
Anti-Suffrage League, was introduced by
Samuel Braunhart. She spoke less than
a minute, merely saying that the ladies
she represented were much opposed to
woman suffrage and that the league was
going to organize all over the State and
work for the Democratic party.
Mrs. Murray announced that there was
no other champion of the anti-suffragists
on hand, and that the other side could
have the balance of her time if they
wanted it; but Osgood Putnam of the
Fourth District, San Francisco, jumped
into the breach. He declared that he
couldn't let the matter rest without offer
ing an adequate defense of the women of
California.
When Mr. Putman got through, Miss
Susan B. Anthony came forward amid
considerable applause from even hostile
Democrats present.
"In answer to the argument that the
women do not want to vote," said Miss
Anthony in the course of her brief ad
dress, "I offer here the petition signed by
40,000 men and women in the State after a
brief canvas. Two counties send petitions
with signatures equal to half the voting
population, and in eight counties the ratio
is one-third. In New York 625,000 names
are on similar petitions.
"The reason that political parties are not
seeking the votes of women as they are
those of the most degraded elements is that
they know that the women's vote will be
an intelligent one."
Rev.. Anna Shaw, with a characteristic
ally strong and bright three-minute ad
dress, closed the discussion.
"We have been told,',' she said, "that the
women do not want to vote. When a gen
tleman has an invisible consciousness of it
at his back 1 wish to present the visible evi
dence â¢of the contrary to his face. la
Wyoming at the last general election 65,000
of the 80,000 women voted. .
"It is that the conditions of depravity
may be removed that the motherhood of
the country asks the ballot. If woman is
charged with the care home and children,
by every law, human and divine, mother
hood should have the power to protect
home and children." .
Miss Shaw presented statements from
Governors, Mayors and other authorities
in Wyoming, Colorado and Kansas, that
woman's ; elective franchise was exercised
for good and not for evil, closing amid cor
dial applause from quite â¢ a number of
those present.
. Osgood Putnam presented a plank de
claring outright against woman suffrage,
and Jere T. Burke of San Francisco moved
its adoption, but before it was put or dis
cussed a motion was made to, lay the
whole matter on the table. Cries of ."ques
tion" went up, and .there, were two noes
when the question .was put.
The ladies filed. out and the report of the
sub-committee on finance was called up.

Chauncey I. Filley's Hack Ride With

Came of It.
The Call's Headquarters,!
Southern Hotel, [â 
St. Lot Mo., June 17.)
To the tired spectator in such a dreary
town as this has been thus far, there are
PERRY CARSON AND ANDY GLEESON.
The Colored and the White Delegate From the District of Columbia,
as the Washington Post Pictured Them. |
some features bordering on the ludicrous, i
and these irresistibly arise in the mind ;
that is weary of much talking on uninter
esting matters.
The manner in which some of the heavy- j
weights of tbe political world enter the j
convention hall belongs to that risky bor- j
derland between tragedy and bathos. They i
invariably arrive late, just before the con
vention is called to order and when all the
delegates are in their seats.
Then, when the band is playing "The
Suwanee River," or "Walking for Dat |
Cake," the political giants go stalking j
down the aisle with chests thrown forward, j
swelling with pardonable pride and drip- j
ping perspiration from their faces to j
their white vests*, leaving thereon big j
blotches of distress as they fan themselves j
vigorously.
This grandstand play, as it is called in \
the vernacular, makes a palpable hit.
There is a clapping of hands from the New
York, Pennsylvania and other delegations,
and conversation is suspended ; people rise I
in their seats and stand on their chairs; j
the ladies in the galleries wave handker- '
chiefs and inquire : "Is that Senator Quay j
in the white vest?" "What a fine-looking
man he is," or "Isn't Mr. Hanna stout?"
Senator Piatt of New York is an excep
tion to the rule. He is a quiet man with a
very solemn air, as the readers of The Call l
will observe by his portrait. His head is '
bent forward in contemplative mood, and I
there is nothing resembling the pouter '
pigeon in his profile. He might be mis
taken for a minister of the Gospel, his
manner is so subdued, or for an under
taker, purring consolation to the afflicted.
His walk is noiseless, his step is light as
the padded footfall of a tiger, and his
countenance wears a reserved and alert
expression, though somewhat masked.
It was thought at the outset that Marcus
Aurelius Hacua had irretrievably crushed
him; but it is remarked on the other
hand that when he gave Mr. Hanna four
hours the other day to make up his mind
not to straddle on tbe financial proposi- '
tion in the platform, Mr. Hanna imitated !
the motion of the historic coon which I
came down from the tree to give Davy |
Crockett a greeting, and acceded to the j
New York Senator's demands. - â¢:it
Piatt is physically, mentally and politi- |
cally one of the great men of the conven
tion. Determination and subtletly seem
to me to be his prominent characteristics. |
Such men are hard to be downed or kept I
down.
Chauncey I. Filley of Missouri is an- j
other of the great political guns of the |
convention. He is a twelve-inch rifle, and
although he has been spiked by General |
Hanna, is yet capable of doing consider- j
able damage. Mr. Filley took a ride last
Sunday afternoon ma hack with Chauncey j,
Depew of New York and Mr. Hanna of
Ohio. The top of the vehicle was not
open, either ostentatiously or otherwise,
although the weather was warm.
Politicians lock upon a hack as a good j
place in which to do certain political busi
ness of more than ordinary delicacy. No
eavesdropper can lie concealed there to
learn important secrets of state. Well,
after they had bad their little ride through
some of the long streets of St. Louis they
returned, the jehu pulling up his panting
horses at the north side of the Southern
Hotel, just underneath the' Reed, head-
quarters on. the floor above. There was
i quite a large crowd of delegates and others
I in waiting, and when the hack stopped
j and Chauncey Depew alighted and stood
! for a moment on the walk, the crowd
| grew bigger. Mr. Hanna got out after Mi.
j Depew, ana then Mr. Filley. Mr. Depew
walked into the hotel and Mr. Filley took
j hold of Mr. Hanna's elbow as they stood
; upon the curb.
"All right, good-by," was Mr. Filley's
remark as a second later he stepped back
into the hack, Mr. Hanna replied with a
nod of the head in the affirmative and the
hack drove away.
Mr. Filley's face when last beheld on
that memorable occasion wore an expres
sion of satisfaction. Persons who had
witnessed the incident suggested that Mr.
Filley had squared himself with Hanna
and Depew. But the next day something
dropped very hard, and to Mr. Filley's
surprise and chagrin he discovered that it
was himself. Then he no doubt reflected
that he had two to one against him in the
hack, which is fearfully bad politics at the
outset and it became grievously apparent
to him that he had been wooed, perhaps
won, and then betrayed to his undoing.
Revenge, next to victory, is one of the
sweetest things in life to a politician, so
the word was passed around that Mr. Filley
was sharpening his caseknife at the grind
stone of disappointment, and that he was
going to stick it into some crack in the
geld armor of Major McKinley of Can
tan, Ohio. The report proved to be true,
for the first job for the knife appeared last
night. Mr. Filley's Merchants' League
Club paraded with the men from Maine,
burning Roman candles and shouting
themselves hoarse for Reed.
Chairman Thurston of the convention is
a great improvement upon his predecessor,
Temporary Chairman Fairbanks. Thurs-
ton possesses in plenitude what Fairbanks
lacksâ a clear, strong, resonant voice,
which can. be heard clear across the big
hall. By the way. speaking of this hall,
built especially by the St. Louisa ns for
convention purposes and with a capacity
of nearly 14,000 chairs, all of which were
filled to-day, it must be said that the man
who planned it built it for coolness and
ventilation and let the acoustics get along
as well as it could without any plans.
Only the strongest- voiced speakers can
be heard within a radius of one hundred
feet. More than one-half of the half-thou
sand reporters iv the pressstand were un
able to hear a syllable of tho committee
reports, and it was like a breeze from the
ocean on a hot day whenever Chairman
Thurston repeated something of the tenor
of the subject matter.
It is no easy task to build a hail so that
a convenient supply of fresh air can be
kept in circulation while 14,000 people are
perspiring and fanning themselves in the
moist beat. But the arcituct of this build
ing has done it by leaving a great opening
all around the building just under the
eaves. Through this the breeze, whenever
there is one, sweeps from one side to the
other. The heated air from the mass of
people below ascends and escapes, thus in
suring perfect ventilation.
New York, Maine, lowa and Rhode
Island were among the States voting sol
idly against the ordering of the previous
question on the report of the committee
on credentials. But the vote was so over
whelmingly in favor of Mr. Manila's pro
gramme that when the question was put
upon the adoption of the majority report
confirming the action of the National
Committee not a voice demanded a roll
call and it * was rushed through a
viva voce vote. I expect that the plat
form will be disposed of as speedily to
morrow and that a candidate for the Presi
dency will be nominated some time in the
afternoon.
There does not seem to be now any
doubt that it will be McKinley, the Reed
boom at this writing not having grown
any larger than it was last night in the
blaze and the glow of Roman candles and
under the inspiration of the rollicking
strains of "The Sidewalks of New York."
In fact, the Reed boom was made seasick
this evening by the big McKinley parade.
Just at the time the procession was to have
started a shower of warm water fell, last
ing for about an hour and turning the
streets into waterways, while the lightning
flashed and the thunder boomed in honor
of the McKinley boom. When the storm
abated' the procession marched through
the streets, a great crowd lining the side
walks on each side and cheering all along
the line. John Paul Cosgrave.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1896.
VICTORY FOR
McKINLEY'S MEN.
Continued from First Pane.
the Convention Hall rang with the cheers
of unseated delegates and their friends in
the galleries.
Every utterance of Mr. Hepburn con
demning snap judgment on the matter of
credentials was received with rounds of
applause.
Indeed, the responses of the convention
to Mr. Hepburn's sentences were so em
phatic that it looked for a while as if there
might be a chance to vote down the ma
jority report (which recommended the
adoption of the National Committee's tem
porary roll) and. adopt the minority re
port. When Congressman Dave Hender
son of lowa arose and announced that his
State cast her twenty -six votes against the
majority report, there was a tremendous
cheer from the floor and galleries.
Delegates and spectators alike began to
whisper that perhaps after all the majority
report of the credentials committee, in-.
volving the seats of IGO delegates, might
be defeated. The McKinley managers were
visibly worried, and Congressman Grosve
nor, one of the champions of the Ohio
man, was observed to leave bis seat and
consult hurriedly with his colleagues in
the Ohio delegation.
As the rollcall proceeded on the ques
tion of adopting the majority report of
the credentials committee it became evi
dent that it would have a heavy majority.
This was regarded as a test vote of McKin
ley's strength, and as the rollcall neared a
close each man whispered to his neighbor:
"McKinley will be nominated in a few
minutes or he will be defeated," for all
realized the significance of this vote. :â â }:- ;r.
When the rollcall was finally completed
and the secretary was figuring the result
the convention was as still as death. The
secretary came forward and handed a slip
of paper to Chairman Thurston.
He took it in his hands, glanced a mo
ment at the figures and then announced
568}Â£ votes had been cast for the previous
question on adopting the credentials com
mittee's reporÂ£ and 329}Â£ against the pre
vious question. "The ayes have it and the
previous question on the adoption of the
report is ordered,"
The convention broke into cheers. The
supporters of McKinley realized that their
favorite was nominated, while tbe hope of
the opposition was dispelled.
Ti.e question then being upon the cre
dentials committee's report, several ma
jority and minority members of the com
mittee addressed the convention. After
Chairman Fort and Yerkes of Delaware
had made their arguments, Congressman
Hepburn of lowa made' a forcible speech
against the majority report. Mr. Hep
burn inveighed against the proposed ac
tion in unseating 160 delegates without a
fair hearing. The lowa Congressman was
at his best. His speech was a magnificent
one, and was received with cheers, espe
cially from the galleries.
General Grosvenor of Ohio then took the
platform. He is distinguished in appear
ance, a tall man with a well-shaped head,
crowned with a mass of snowy white hair.
His side whiskers and beard are snowy
white, too. He is a man who would attract
attention in a crowd of ten thousand. The
convention recognized his features and
gave him a splendid ovation.
General Grosvenor is a radical. He never
minces words, and the convention was to
day given a sample of his invective pow
ers. He accused Mr. Hepburn with repre
senting the biggest scoundrel in the
countryâ Delegate Cuney of Texas, a half
breed negro. Grosvenor coupled the name
of Addicksof Delaware with that of Cuney,
the Texas delegate, and shouted as he
closed his speech: "I demand the retire
ment of the man from Delaware and the
rascal from Texas."
The convention . then voted almost
unanimously in favor of accepting the re
port of the National Republican Com
mittee.
The report of the .committee on rules
was then adopted, and the convention
adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow. It
is generally thought that the convention
may be brought to a close late to-morrow
evening, but all depends upon the plat
form debate. If it is protracted the con
vention may not adjourn until Friday.

A MINORITY REPORT.
The Action of the Committee on
Credentials Oblected To.
ST LOUIS, Mo., June 17.â Tne second
day's session of the Republican National
Convention was called to order by Tem
porary Chairman Fairbanks at 10:45 a. m.
The early morning hour of the second
day was cloudy and drizzly, -and threat
ened a rather disagreeable rainy day.
An animated throng in front of "The Call's" Market-street Business Office Reading
the latest news from the conventions. -v '"
Just before the hour fixed for. the meet
ing, however, the clouds dispersed, and
there was every appearance of " coming
sultry weather. By 10 o'clock hardly half
the delegates were present, but they kept
pouring in all the time, while the band
discoursed popular airs. In the mean
time, the galleries were being filled up.
and when at last Mr. Fairbanks called the
convention to order there were few seats
unoccupied either in the galleries or in the
sections assigned to delegates and alter
nates.
The convention was called to order at
10:45, three-quarters of an hour behind
time, when prayer was offered by the Rev.
Dr. W. G. Williams. He implored on "this
great historic organization" the blessings
of "the God of Washington and of Lin
coln." He prayed a blessing on the dele
gates as "the successors of our noble
fathers," and "that they might acquit
themselves of their high duties in a man
ner worthy of their noble ancestors." ,
"May these men," he continued, "do
that which is in accordance with the will
of the Supreme Ruler and may the plat
form that will be raised here be raised in
righteousness. May the men whom this
council shall place before the people of
John McNulta of Illinois, Who Is One of
Major McKinley's Most Earnest Sup-
porters.
this Nation be men after the people's own
thoughts."
"The Senator from Massachusetts," said
the. chairman as Mr. Lodge arose amid
applause. -_~
"I desire to â¢ say," were his opening
words, "in behalf of the committee on
resolutions that the sub-committee has
completed a draft of a platform, and that
it is now under consideration by the full
committee. The committee is unable to
report- this morning, and asks leave of the
convention to sit during this morning's
session, hoping to be able to report a plat
form of principles to the afternoon con
vention, and on behalf of the committee I
ask that leave of the convention."
Permission was unanimously granted.
A colored delegate from Arkansas rose
to inform the chair that Mr. Cohen, one of
the delegates from his Slate, was at the
door and unable to get in for want of
proper badges, and the sergeant-at-arms
was ordered to relieve the difficulty.
The committee on credentials was called
upon for a report, but were not ready.
Neither was the committee on permanent
organization. Mr. Wellington of Mary
land asked unanimous consent that the
committee on rules be allowed to report
at this time. This was refused.
A motion for a recess till 2 o'clock this
afternoon was made by Mr. Wellington,
and was voted down. ' '
A motion that the report of the commit
tee on permanent organization be accepted
was made by Senator Sewell of New Jer
sey, and agreed to.
Mr. Littlerield of Maine made the point
of order that the first business in order
was the report of the committee on cre
dentials, but the chairman overruled it on
the ground that that committee had been
called and had not been ready to report.
The report of the committee on permanent
organization was then presented and read.
It named Senator J. M. Thurston of
Nebraska as chairman, made the secre
taries, sergeant-at-arms and other tem
porary officers permanent officers of the
convention, and gave a list of vice
presidents, one from each State, as agreed
upon by the delegations. The reading of
the list of vice-presidents was interrupted
by applause as popular names were
reached.
Mr. Mudd of Maryland made the point
of order that although tbe convention
might receive the report of the committee
on permanent organization it could not
act upon it until the report of the com-
I
rT^tee on credentials had been acted
upon. There was no convention here
now, he said.
The chairman overruled the point of
I order and promptly put the question on
I the adoption of the report of the cor#nit-
I tee on permanent organization. ; While
a rising vote was being taken Mr. Mudd
made another point of order that the roll
of States must be called according to the
rules.
. "There is no convention now," he said,
I "until we have a permanent organiza
| tion."
Disregarding the point the chairman
! said. "Those opposed will rise," and de-
clared that the "ayes had it and -that the
report of the committee on permanent or-
ganization was adopted. *
The chair appointed Senator Sewell of
New Jersey and Representative Sereno
Payne of New York to conduct Senator
Thurston to the chair.
Senator Thurston took the chair amid
tumultuous applause and addressed the
convention. He said:
Gentlemen of the Convention The happy
j memory of your kindness and confidence will
[ abide in my joyful heart forever. My sole am-
bition is to meet your expectations, and I
pledge myself to exercise the important pow
ers of this high office with absolute justice and
impartiality. I bespeak your cordial co-oper
i ation and support to the end that our proceed-
ings may be orderly and dignified, as befits the
deliberations of the supreme council of the
Republican party.
Eight years ago I had the distinguished
honor to preside over the convention which
nominated the last Republican President of
the United States. . To-day I have the further
distinguished honor to preside over the con-
vention which is to nominate the next Presi-
dent of the United States. This generation
has had its object lesson, and the doom of the
Democratic party is already pronounced. The
American people will return the Republican
party to power, because they know that its
administration will mean: : '; %
The supremacy of the Constitution of the
United States.
The maintenance of law and order.
The protection of every American citizen in
his right to live, to labor and to vote.
A vigorous foreign policy.
The enforcement of the Monroe doctrine.
' The restoration of our merchant marine.
Safety under the Stars and Stripes on every
sea, in every port. .;.â¢.'
A revenue adequate for all Governmental
expenditures and the gradual extinguishment
of the National debt.
A currency "as sound as the Government and
as untarnished' as its honor," whose dollars,
whether of gold, silver or paper, shall have
equal purchasing and debt-payltrg power with
the best dollars of the civilized world.
A protective tariff which protects, coupled
with a reciprocity which reciprocates, thereby
securing the best markets for American prod-
ucts and opening American factories to the tree
coinage of American muscle.
A pension policy just and generous to our
living heroes and to the widows and orphans
of their dead comrades. â¢ â .- ",?.'â " ,
The Governmental supervision and control
of transportation lines and rates. .
The protection of the people from all unlaw
ful combinations and unjust exactions of
aggregated capital and corporate power.
An American welcome to every God-fearing,
liberty-loving, constitution-respecting, law-
abiding, labor-seeking, decent man; the ex-
elusion of all whose birth, whose blood, whose
teachings, whose practices would menace the
permanency of free institutions, endanger the
safety of American society or lessen the oppor
tunities of American labor. ..'; â¢ "
The abolition of sectionalismâ every star in
the flag shining for the honor and welfare and
happiness of every commonwealth and of all
the people.
A deathless loyalty to all that is truly Amer
ican and a patriotism eternal as the stars.
Senator Thurston's reference as to what
should be the money policy of the Repub
licans and to the protective tariff brought
out salvo after salvo of cheers. He con-
eluded at 11:40 o'clock and the delegates
rose en masse and gave him a three times
thÂ»ee. " "'J'-- ,;->", -1 â¢-â '::-'â â¢!:
The tribute was resumed as the Ne
braska delegation handed up a pyramid of
American beauty roses and ferns.
As Senator Thurston closed his speech
with the phrase, "A patriotism as eternal
ad the stars," the air was rent with cheers,
amid which he was heard to ask the official
question, "Gentlemen, what is your
pleasure?"
The secretary read a letter from the
chairman of the committee on credentials
saying that they were engaged in the con-
sideration of the Texas case and had not
been able to complete it. On motion of
Governor Busbnell of Ohio the convention
then adjourned until 2 p. m.

adopted by the convention was as follows:

Since yesterday's adjournment the ar
rangement of the floor has undergone a
changeâ positions of the several States
have been shifted, and in a way far from
satisfactory to the reporters, because in
stead of having Senator Teller of Colo
rado, Lodge of Massachusetts, C. M. De
pew and Thomas C. Piatt of New York,
between whom much of the discussion is
anticipated, in close proximity to each
other and to the reporters, they were re
moved to remote quarters back of the
hall, where they could neither be seen nor
heard from the platform seats.
The California delegates occupied one of
the first four rows in the right-hand sec
tion from the platform, and were con
spicuous by each of them wearing on his
left shoulder a plume of red, while and
bh'e pampas grass, which had been
adopted by the Republicans of that state
four years ago as a Blame badge, and is
still worn by them.
The Higgins delegation took the Dela
ware seats in the hall after electing the
following named committeemen: Chair
man of delegation, Senator Higgins; vice
president of convention, Cornelius P.
Swain; assistant secretary of convention,
L. H. Ball. Committeemenâ Resolutions,
H. A. Dupont; .credentials, Senator Hig-
EDWIN H. R. GREEN OF TEXAS.
Among the many notable incidents of the convention not the least
interesting has been a fight made by Edwin H. R. Green to gain a seat
as a delegate from Texas. Mr. Green was elected as a Reed man, but
his seat was contested by Munsen McCormick, a McKinley man, and
the National Committee decided in favor of McCormick. This so irri
tated Green that he asserted that instead of contributing $25,000 to
the campaign fund as he had intended he will not now give a cent.
Green is less than 30 years of age, 6 feet high and is a fine looking
fellow. He is more remarkable, however, for being the only son of
Mrs. Hetty Green, the richest woman in America. Her fortune is
estimated at $50,000,000, and it is to be divided at her death equally
between her son and one daughter.
gins; rules, John Pilling; permanent or
ganization, Washington Hastings.
There was the usual delay in calling the
convention to order, for the afternoon ses
sion, but tbe time was pleasantly whiled
away by good music. There was great
pressure in all parts of the immense hall,
the galleries were packed, and there as
well as. on the floor palm-leaf fans were in
ceaseless agitation. The heat was very
oppressive.
It was 2:40 when the chairman's ham
mer was heard and the chairman an
nounced that the afternoon session would
be opened with prayer by Bishop Arnett
of Wilberforce College, Ohio. The Bishop
invoked blessings on the convention and
on the country and gave thanks for an as
semblage representing the culture, the
wealth and the refinement of more than
forty centuries. He gave thanks that God
had given to the country a Lincoln, who
broke the fetters from the limbs of more
than four and a half millions of people.
He prayed that the victory to be gained in
the future through the work of the con- i
vention might redound to the blessing of
every section, and that protection and lib
erty and civil and political rights may be
secured to every man, woman and child
from the lakes on the North to the gulf on
the South.
Mr. Madden of Chicago was recognized
by the chair for a special pAirpose. " Mr.
Madden, in appropriate terms, presented
a gavel made from a portion of the house
in which Lincoln once lived.
The chairman, in accepting it, expressed
the hope that the inspiration of the im
mortal Lincoln might fire the hearts of
the convention to higher patriotism.
Judge Denny of Kentucky presented a
second gavel, made from the wood which
formed part of the 'homestead of Henry
Clay, the father of protection. ?
Temporary Chairman Fairbanks .re
sponded, expressing 'his gratification that
the State of Henry Clay had entered the
Republican fold and ; trusted it would be
found true to the standard-bearer of this
great convention in November next.
A voice in the hall exclaimed- "By
25,000." - J â 
Mr. Terrence of Minnesota then pre
sented, in the name of. that ; State, to the
chairman of the convention, the table
which stood in front of the presiding
officer. .
In accepting the table, the president sent
back word to the boys of Minnesota that
even as the Father of the Republic handed
the Union down, so would ,the Republican
party of to-day band down the Govern
ment under Republican ; institutions, with
all- the rights and privileges and opportu
nities for the boys to come. [Oncers.]
The report of the committee on creden
tials was then presented by its chairman^
Fort of New Jersey. The report was in
favor of seating the Higgins delegates
from Delaware and the delegates from
Texas on the list headed by John Grant.
The rest of the report lead by the secre
tary recommended that the roll of dele-
gates and alternates of the convention
from the several States and Territories, as
prepared by the National! Committee for
temporary organization, re approved as
the permanent roll of this convention.
' Mr. Hepburn of lowa wai recognized to
present the minority report from the com-
mittee on credentials. It recommended
the seating of the Addicks delegation from
Dele Ware and of the Cuney delegation from
Texas, and that the other contested cases
acted upon by the National Committee be
referred to the credentials committee lor
full investigation. \
The minority report was signed by nine-
teen members of the committee, and is as
follows: ; S-; \
The undersigned members of your commit-
tee on credentials dissent from the report of
the majority of the committee in this:
We are unwilling to accept the roll of dele
i gates as made up by the National Committee.
The National Committee did not attempt to
j consider the merits of the cases of any of the
150 odd constants, only the regularity of ere
â¢ I dentials being passed upon. None of these con-
testants, except those from Delaware and the
delegates at large from Texas, have had a hear-
ing on the facts involved by any competent
tribunal, and in these two cases no part of the
evidence was read or considered by the com
j mittee. The committee has persistently voted
j down propositions to investigate the cases
from Texas other than those from the State
at largeâ those from California, from Louisi
! ana, from Alabama and from the Twelfth Dis
j trict of Missouri.
We deem it a most dangerous precedent to
', permit the National Committee to pass final
j judgment on the election and qualifications of
i members of the National Committee. This
; dangerous exercise of power ought not to be
' submitted to by any body of men, but should
; be retained in the hands of the convention
! alone.
, .We recommend that the delegation from the
State of Delaware headed by J. Edward Ad
i dicks be seated; that the delegation from the
I State of Texas headed by N. W. Cuney be
seated, and that all other cases of contest be
referred to the committee on credentials,
with instructions to hear and report upon the
same.
In the consideration of contested cases be
fore the Republican National Committee it
was distinctly and lepeatedly stated that the
action of the committee was only prima facie,
and that the contestants would have an oppor
tunity to be heard upon the merits before the
committee on credentials with their testi
mony. -.'.';"' 'L'.';i-r '. *
The report is signed by W. A. Hepburn
of lowa, C. S. Blackett of Maryland, For-
rest Goodwin of Maine and sixteen others.
In "presenting it Mr. Hepburn asserted
that none of the contestants, except those
from Delaware and Texas, had had any
hearing before the committee on creden
tials, and in those two cases not one word
of the testimony had been read, and no
member of the committee knew what the
points of the cases were.
More than 160 Republicans claiming to
be delegates, with their credentials, were
now asking to be heard in order that the
merits of their cases might be properly
ascertained. It was a bad precedent, he
declared, to permit the National Commit-
tee to pass final judgment on the election
and qualification of delegates.
It was a dangerous exercise of power
end one that should not be submitted to.
The minority therefore recommended that
the delegation from Delaware headed by
Addicks. and the delegates from Texas
headed by Mr. Cuney, be seated and that
as to all the other contested election cases
they be recommitted to tbe committee on
credentials, with instructions to perform
its duty. 90S
Mr. Fort, chairman of the committee,
was recognized and moved the previous
question, the adoption of the report of the
committee down to the final vote, under
| the rules of tho House of Representatives.
i This motion was seconded by J. Doyle of
Georgia and by a delegate from Ohio.
. Mr. Mudd of Maryland asked for a sepa-
rate vote on the Delaware report and was
seconded by the States of Delaware, Cali
fornia and Maine. Â»
The question being now on the ordering
'. of the previous question the delegation
from Maine, seconded by Massachusetts.
i Maryland and low", demanded a rollcall.
The roll of States was then called and
resulted as follows: . Ayes 56S>Â£, noes
339 J^, so the previous question was or-
dered.
The votes of Alabama, Florida. Georgia,
Illinois and Texas were challenged and on
| a poll of the delegates the votes of the del-
egation as announced by the chairman !
was changed. ;
When lowa announced it cast its
twenty-six votes against ordering the pre-
vious question there was so much cheer-
ing that the chair remarked that he de-
sired on all occasions to give opportunityfor the exuberant spirits of the convention
to find vent, but he must ask that this be
done in reasonable time. When Missouri
was reached Mr. Niecringhaus. one of the
delegates at large, was absent, and a ques
tion arose as to calling his alternate.
Chauncey I. Filler rose to speak to this
point and was greeted with a round of
applause, which indicated that his per
sonal popularity had not been entirely
destroyed by his recent political "turning
down.'' The alternate, Mr. Benecke, was
found in the body of the hall and his vote
was recorded. When Mr. Piatt rose to
cast the vote of New York he was also
greeted with lusty cheering.
The full rollcall was as follows:
The chahman of the committee on res
olutions was recognized and reported that
the platform would be ready at 8 p. m.
Discussion was then commenced under
the previous question, the majority and
minority reports, each side being allowed
twenty minutes. ,
Mr. Fort of New Jersey opened the dis
cussion. He said the minority of the com
mittee made their proposition; first, to
open all the contested cases; second, to
seat the Addicks delegltion from Dela
ware, and third, to seat t:>e Cuney delega
tion from Texas.
He opposed all the propositions. The
committee on credentials had by a vote
of 31 to 14 determined to accept the roll as
made up by the National Committee, with
the exception of Deleware and Texas, on
which the National Committee had taken
no action. One hundred and sixty men,
he said, had appeared before the National
Committee by counsel or otherwise and
had been heard a longer time than the
committee on credentials could give them
unless it stayed in session for a full week.
If they got all the time they wanted,
the committee would be in session for
three months, so that the committee on
credentials had a right to say that the
temporary roll should stand. It had given
three hours and a half to the Delaware
case and over two hours to the Texas case.
And the committee had recommended
that the Higgins delegation be seated be
cause the delegates headed by Addicks did
not represent the Republicans of Delaware
or anywhere else. [Applause and laugh
ter.] â  !
The record before us, continued Mr.
Fort, showed that Mr. Addicks entered
into a combination in Delaware, and with
four men in the Legislature united with
the Democratic party and the Democratic
Governor and agreed not to allow a United
States Senator to be elected from
there. The fact of the matter is simply
this:
A majority of the National Committee
believed under the evidence that Mr. Ad- '
dicks and his partners in Delaware were
highwaymen on the way to political for
tune, no matter what the result. [Cheers.]
And as a rebuke to the Addicks men, and
to carry out the intention which the
United States Senate tried to carry out, we
seat Mr. Dupont in this convention as a
delegate from Delaware. [Loud applause.]
Mr. Yerkes of Kentucky was heard
briefly on the same side.
The other side of the question was sup
ported by Mr. Hepburn of lowa, who
spoke for the minority of the committee
on credentials. He appealed to the con
vention for fairness. The American peo
ple love fairness. He repeated that there
had been no hearing on the merits of 160
contested cases. [Cheers.]
"Here," he said, speaking of the con
tested cases, "is the astonishing spectacle â
in view of all the traditions of the party â
of a Republican National Convention
GENERAL GROSVENOR OF OHIO, THE MAN OF FIGURES.
During the three months which preceded the opening of the con
vention General Grosvenor gave out, almost daily, estimates showing
what Major McKinley's strength would be in the convention. His
figures were at first deemed chimerical, but as the time approached
for the gathering at St. Louis the friends of the other candidates were
obliged to admit the General was a political mathematician. â  >.'..

trampling under its feet ruthlessly, re
morselessly, tho doctrines of equity and
justice, to which the Republican party has
pledged itself during all the years of its
eventful history.'' [Applause.]
As to the Delaware case Mr. Hepburn
asserted that there had been no proof of
any character presented or considered by
the committee on credentials impugn
ing the Republicanism of Mr. Addicks,
whereas Mr. Addicks himself had assured
the committee that he had voted for
Abraham Lincoln and for every Demo
cratic (correcting himself amid shouts of
laughter) every Republican President
since.
Mr. Hepburn spoke contemptuously of
some person who had denied Mr. Addicts'
Republicanism â describing him as "a little
gentleman quite voluble, he might almost
say volatile" â whose intellectual propor
tions were in exact ratio to the geographic
lines of bis State. [Laughter.]
That gentleman was the only person
who had asserted that the Addicks dele
gation were not Republicans. It was the
constituency Mr. Hepburn argued that de
termined the qualification of its represen
tatives in the convention. "People of Del-
aware had not sent here to represent them
i Anthony Higgins, whom they had repudi
ated, who they had said should never
serve them ; whom they had refused to
i place confidence in and who. they had
i said, could not properly represent them
or wield their power at this convention.
"But the majority of the committee on
: credentials asked the convention to say
! that Mr. Higgins should wield the power
; of the people of Delaware, whether they
! wished it or not. Was that Republican
; ism? Whom would Mr. Higgins repre
; sent? The people of Delaware, who said
they would not have Mr. Higgins, or the
majority of the committee on credentials,
i who said that he was to have the seat?"
Mr. Grosvenor of ;io spoke in refer-
ence to the Texas case, giving its history
and claiming the Grant delegates (who
are McKmlcy men) were entitled to the
i seats. He congratulated the last speaker â
Mr. Hepburn â as being "the advocate of
I the biggest scoundrel who was ever on the
earth," meaning Cuney. [Cheers and
laughter.] He assured the convention, in
conclusion, that no harm would come to
the Republic, or to the fair fame of the
Republican party, if this convention rele
gated to private life "the man of Delaware
and the rascal of Texas." [Cheers and
laughter.]
The vote was first taken on the Delaware
case, those favoring Addicks voting aye,
and those opposed no. The noes were de-
clared to have carried, and the minority
report on the Delaware case was rejected.
A similar result, with even greater em-
phasis, awaited the minority report as to
Texas; also that portion of the minority
report referring the contests back to the
committee, the minority in each case be
ing overwhelmingly defeated. The major-
ity report was then adopted amid cheers.
General Harry Bingham of Pennsylva
nia, chairman of the committee on rules,
read the report of the committee. The
rules recommended were almost identical
with those heretofore in force. Among
the changes, Indian Territory was given
six votes instead of two and Alasua four
instead of two. The report was adopted.
Mr. Grosvenor moved to adjourn till 10
o'clock to-morrow, and an equal storm of
ayes and noes was raised.
The chairman declared in favor of the
ayes, and at 5:07 the convention adjourned
accordingly.
TELLER'S FAREWELL.
Reasons Why He Is No Longer a
* Republican.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 17.â The sub
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1896.
committee on resolutions met again at 9
o'clock this morning to complete its
labors before reporting to the full com
mittee an hour later The platform was
constructed the night before, Senator-elect
Foraker, Senator Lodge and Mr. Patter
son remaining after the rough draft was
agreed to, to put it into proper shape.
The sub-committee promptly adopted
the platform and decided to urge the full
committee to vote down any and all
amendments that might be offered.
Shortly after 10 o'clock the full commit
tee on resolutions met at the Lindell Hotel
and went into executive session to con
sider the proposed platform.
It was 10:30 when Chairman Foraker
called the full committee to order. The
platform was read by paragraphs, the
agreement being that each paragraph
should be voted upon separately. The
preamble was objected to and the phrase-
ology was ordered to be changed so that
the wording of the paragraph should be
less obscure.
Mr. Teller of Colorado then arose and
stated that he proposed a minority report
on the financial plank which he would
present when that subject was reached.
The remainder of the platform was. he
added, entirely satisfactory to him.
The tariff plank was agreed to unani
mously and a strong declaration was made
for a protective duty on' wools and
woolens. The protection of American
ship-building and the- development of
American commerce was also demanded.'
All of Mr. Teller's amendments to the
financial plank were voted down. There
was a pathetic scene when the financial
plank was reached and Senator Teller pre-
sented his minority report. It took the
form of a substitute, and declared in gen
| eral terms for the free and unlimited coin
i age of silver at a ratio of 16 to L Senator
Teller spoke for thirty minutes.
His utterances were followed with deep
interest, for all present realized that 'the
hour had arrived when one of the found-
ers of the Republican party, a man who
has been conspicuous in Republican coun
sels for a third of a century, was taking a
step which would separate him from his
party friends. J
Mr. Teller spoke with deep emotion and
the sincerity of his purpose was so mani
fest that his words produced a deep im
pression. He spoke of his long connection
with the Republican party. It was the
party of his young manhood ; the party of
his choice. It was the party with which
he had affiliated for thirty-five years. It
was a party that had given him great
honors and he had served it loyally.
"But," he exclaimed in a voice of deep
earnestness, "the time has come when I
shall be obliged to leave it if it declares for
the single gold standard."
He explained in conclusion that he had
not originally intended to speak at such
length, but that he was carried away by
the importance of his subject. It was
purely a matter of conscience and princi
ple. There was no question of personal
ambition involved. He might be wrong;
he hoped not Time alone could tell
whether he or the framers of . this plank
were right.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts ex-
plained that no choice was left to the com-
mittee but to adopt the plank in question.
He expressed his high appreciation of Mr.
Teller, and stated his; belief that he was
acting I from \ conscientious motives, but
that the Republicans had come to the
parting'of the ways, and in that way part-
ing from Mr. Teller and his associates, he
wished to announce that they carried with
them the full respect of the committee. 1 â 
Mr. Cleveland of .; Nevada asserted that
with such a plank his State could not be
kept in the Republican column.
Mr. Lemon of California said the West
ern men had come here under the belief
that the committee would be ; friendly to
silver. He explained his connection with
the last three Republican campaigns in
Oalifornia ; that they had done what they
could to keep the State in line; but the
effect of this action would be to wipe out
a Republican majority of 40,000 and make
the State Democratic. â¢
Mr. Cannon of Utah, like Mr. Teller,
created a profound sensation by the earn
estness of his remarks. Several times his
voice was choked with emotion and he
proceeded with great difficulty. He
pointed out that Utah had been converted
from a Democratic Territory into a Re
publican State, but that it would be irre
trievably lost if the party were committed
to the gold standard. He bitterly deplored
the necessity which /compelled him to
leave tne party of his choice, but existing
circumstances left him no alternative. :
1 â  Mr. Mott of North Carolina asserted that
he had gone into this campaign for Mc-
Kinley, believing that gentleman was
friendly to silver. He had failed to find
any utterannce of McKinley's to the con-
trary. If Mr. McKinley was unfavorable
to silver there was nothing in his record
to show it.
Before a vote was taken on Mr. Teller's
16 to 1 substitute, Mr. Darlington of Perm-
sylvania arose and replied specifically to
Senator Teller's declaration that the Re-
publican party had fallen under the domi-
nation of Lombard and Wall streets.
Mr. Dubois of Idaho also announced
that he would follow his associates,
Messrs. Teller and Cannon, in leaving the
party, though he regretted that necessity
compelled him to take this step. He
spoke at some length of the loyalty of the
extreme Western States to the Republi-
can party. Each has now two Republi-
cans in the Senate, but the same could not
be said of many of the Eastern States,
whose representatives were adopting a
course that was driving the silver men
from their party associates.
He showed that New YorK was repre
sented in the Senate by two Democrats;
that Indiana has two and Ohio one each.
If this gold plank was adopted the Repub
lican party would, he said, lose control of
the Senate and not regain it in a quarter
of a century.
Brewer of Michigan, following Dubois,
expressed his regret that the silver men
should feel compelled to take the course
they had indicated.
However, he for one felt that the part-
ing of the roads between Senator Dubois,
his associates and their constituents on
the one hand and the Republican party on
the other had been reached when the five
Republican silver Senators told the United !
States Senate that no measure for the re-
lief of the revenues of the Government and
the protection of our industries should be
permitted to be considered and passed
while they were members of the Senate
unless such measure carried with it a pro-'
vision for the free and unlimited coinage
of silver.
If there was an y one thing the Ameri-
can people demanded it was a sufficiency
of revenue : upon which to support the
Government. The Government could not
be starved no matter, what party was in
power. If there was any one principle
that the Republican party maintained'
must be held inviolate it was the princi
ple upon which a protective tariff was
founded. "."..'. "'
: Dr. Hartman of Montana .boldly an-
nounced that he would not support a can-
didate standing 'â¢; on this platform. The
. Republican platform of 1892 ' had declared
for gold and silver as the standard money.
This platform contained a decluration for
gold only, and the silver men demanded
both. The silver men stood by the party |
principles, and until such time as the '
party might return to the double standard !
they could not support its candidates.
McKinley was an honest man and would
honestly interpret the platform. The sil
ver men were ? not antagonizing men, but
principles in this struggle, and in this j
campaign McKinley would stand for gold
alone.
Mr. Fessenden of Connecticut explained
why it was necessary to adopt a gold plank
and expressed his regret at this difference
of opinion within the party.
The vote was then taken on the Teller
substitute, and it was defeatedâ ayes 10,
noes 41."; Those voting in the affirmative
were the delegates from Colorado, Califor
nia, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,
Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and New
Mexico. " -.ll' '* -" .
Before the sense of the committee was
taken on the gold plank Mr. La Folette of
Wisconsin . arose to a personal explana
tion. ..
;He drew attention to a statement made
by Teller that himself and Mr. Gear of
lowa had performed the principal work in
the preparation of the tariff law of 1890,
which had been popularly credited to Mr.
McKinley, and said that while the mem
bers .of the committee discharged the
duties entrusted to them faithfully it was
not true that any one man on earth had
prepared as much of the measure as Mr.
McKinley, but that his ideas and spirit
dominated everything in connection with
the .bill, when the sub-committees were
preparing the . schedules and before they
were submitted to Mr. McKinley, who led
in all tbe discussion. The same rare abil
ity enabled him also, when it was taken
into the House, to pass it through that
body without amendment.
' Such statements as Senator Teller made,
La Folette continued, were an injustice to
McKinley. They had been continually
repeated, and it was time now that the
country should oe acquainted with the
real facts connected with the formulation
of the bill wnich bore Major McKinley's
name. \;-j:t-! :- '
Mr. La Folette then, addressing himself
specifically to the money plank, moved to
amend the last section by striking out the
words, "now in circulation," so that it
should read that "all our silver and paper
currency must be maintained at a parity
with gold," etc. He argued, in support of
his amendment, that a wrong construc
tion might be placed upon the plank as it
stood.
He feared it might be construed as a
pledge to contract the circulating medium
so that no more silver should be coined or
paper currency be issued. It would hurt
the Republican party in States where it
would be hard pressed, although it would
J make no difference in his own State of
Wisconsin. .
Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts opposed the
amendment. He did not wish to be placed
in the position of encouragipg any further
coinage of silver by the Government.
Arguments in a similar strain were made
by Mr. Merriarn of Minnesota and Mr.
Patterson of Illinois. Mr. Gear of lowa
and Mr. Brewer of Michigan supported
the amendment. The chairman. Mr. Fo
raker of Ohio, agreed with Mr. La Folette
that the words should be stricken out and
this was accordingly done. ' > ?;
The vote on Â« the adoption of the gold
plank as amended was then ordered, and
it passedâ ayes 40*, noes 11. The negative
vote was cast by the foregoing silver men,
who favored the Teller substitute,- with
the addition of the .member from Okla
homa.
The discussion on the remainder of j the
platform was general but of .no especial
interest, and it was adopted without
division, a number of the silver men hav
ing already absented , themselves from the
meeting.
CARTER WILL NOT BOLT.
Senator Mantle May Also Stay With
the Republicans.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June Senator Car
ter of Montana is no longer. one of the
five insurgent Senators. His associates,
Senators Teller, Dubois and Cannon, made
plain their positions before the resolutions
committee, and < what ' course Senators
Carter and ' Mantle would pursue has
been a matter of general- interest.
The former this afternoon notified
the silver men that Â» he could not go
with them, and that if they bolted and
left the convention and the Republican
party they must do so without him. Mr.
Mantle has not yet notified his colleagues
to the same effect, but will probably do so
to-morrow morning.

SEVERANCE OF LIFE -LONG
FRIENDSHIPS.
Senators Dubois and Cannon and
Mr. Cleveland of Nevada Also
Retire.
UNITED PRESS HEADQUARTERS,)
SOUTHERN HOTEL. [
ST. LOUIS, MO., June 17. )
The most striking incidents of the day
were not in the convention, although the
proceedings were a trifle more animated
than yesterday, but in the meeting of the
committee on resolutions, where Senator
Teller declared that he could no longer re
main in the R%ublican ranks after the
party had been committed to the single
gold standard.
The high personal esteem the members
of the committee entertain for Mr. Teller
and the heartfelt regret he so plainly
showed in being compelled to sever life
long ties gave to the scene unusual in
terest.
To that extent it was dramatic, but it
> was more pathetic than anything 'else,
because it was evident Mr. Teller took this
course as a matter of conscience and prin
ciple and without any other reason. This
was fully understood, and it was for this
reason his associates exhibited equal marks
of friendship and regret.
Notwithstanding that this was a family
quarrel, in which two factions were ar- I
rayed against each other, it was char-
acterized by a genuine interchange of
courtesies which robbed it of all the bit-
terness which usually accompanies a party
schism.
Senator Frank Cannon of Utah, still in
the thirtiesâ a Republican from . boyhood
and deeply attached to the principles of
the party exhibited almost equal feeling
at terminating his political affiliations.
Notwithstanding the radical position*
assumed by the silver men, it is noticeable
that only fourâ Senators : Teller, Dubois
and Cannon and Mr. Cleveland, of Ne-
vada announced that they would leave
the party. Two others of the committee-
Representative Hartman of Montana and
Dr. Mott of North Carolinaâ stated that
they were still Republicans and would
stick to the party.
When the convention adjourned until
to-morrow, instead of taking a recess un-
til 8 r. m. as it was expected to do, in order
to hear, the report of the committee on
resolutions, which it was stated would be
ready at that hour, rumors were circulated
' in the convention hall that this course'
had been taken because several States had
threatened to bolt because of the financial
plank. Investigation failed to disclose
any foundation for these rumors. The
i vote of 545% to 359%, by which the con-
I vention, at the bidding of. the credentials
! committee, refused to reopen .any, of the
contested cases settled by the National
Committee- clearly showed that the Ohio
leaders hud the convention well in hand,
even in matters where many of the dele-
I gates felt a strong personal interest.
The members of the committee on reso
lutions expressed much indignation to
night that in a garbled account of the
platform published this morning they
should have been represented as declar
ing war against Spain by pledging the Re
publican nominee to armed intervention
in Cuba. They state that the language
employed In the platform simply pledges
the good offices ot the United , States to
bring about a peaceful settlement.
WILL LEAVE THE PARTY.
No Longer Doubt About Teller and
His Allies.
CHICAGO, 111., June 17.â A special
from St f Louis says : "* esterday's action
of the committee on ; resolutions deter
mined once and for all that the so-called
silver Senators and their allies in effect
will leave the Republican party before the
end of this week. The vote in the full
committee against Dubois for chairman
was only less overwhelming than that in
the sub-committee which defeated, the
free-silver resolutions offered by Teller.
The sliver men held an important con
ference and agreed in substance on a pian
of action. Tney will submit a strong mi
nority report from the committee on leso
lutions end demand that they; be given
time on the floor of the convention to ex
plain their views. In that time they will
not only make a brief plea for free silver
but will announce without hesitation that
they will be unable to support Major Mc-
Kinley or any one else not standing on
such a platform. â¢
This is exactly what the geld men wish.
They want the issii9 drawn as plainly as
possible.
Senator Teller left the sub-committee on
resolutions immediately after, the money
question was settled. He explained to a
reporter, who asked him if he had bolted,
that he was tired and needed rest, and,
the money question being the only one in
which he was interested, he bad left as
soon as it was settled. As to the money
plank adopted, Senator Teller was asked
what he would do.
"Oh, I suppose I will bring the matter
up again in the whole committee, when
the sub-committee reports. It is ' rather
useless, however. The whole committee
is packed, just as the sub-committee was
packed, and there is no hope of getting
any other result."
"Will you then take it to the floor of the
convention?"
"Yes, i presume I shall make a fight
there, but there is practically no chance of
our winning it. The whole thing is agreed
upon. We shall be allowed only five min
utes each for debate, and a man can't
make much of an argument in five
minutes."
Returning to the subject of the money
plank agreed upon by the sub- committee,
Senator Teller said: .
"I offered several substitute planks: one
was for the free and unlimited coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. Another sug
gested by Mr. Fowler of Wyoming was .for
the free coinage of American silver with a
duty on foreign. All of them, however,
were beaten .by the same vote of 8 to 1, by
which the plank was adopted as passed."
It is believed that the little impromptu
silver convention, to be held at the Idaho
headquarters to-day or Thursday, will
nominate Henry M, Teller for President
of the United States, prepare a brief
platform declaring in favor of the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16
to 1, and then issue an address to the
American people asking the support and
co-operation of all who believe that way.
A committee will be appointed to confer
with the leaders of the Democratic and
Populist parties with a view to inducing
them to accept Mr. Teller and that plat
form. The Populists, who meet in St.
Louis on the 22d of July, they claim, are
certain to do it.
The mails and telegraph wires brought
hundred of messages from Colorado, Utah,
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Ari
zona, South Dakota, Southern Illinois,
Kansas and Nebraska and other States
urging the free-silver men to walk out of
the convention, and W. J. Bryan of Ne
orasKa, Thomas Patterson of Colorado and
a score of other prominent silver men were
in conference with the silver delegates
constantly.
Last evening the Reed men began mak
ing overtures to the free-silver delegates,
seeking to bring them into the anti-Mc-
Kinley camp; but their overtures were
not received with enthusiasm, and they
were told that the silver men did not in
tend to vote on the nominations. Colo
rado, Utah and Idaho will not elect Na
tional Committeemen. As soon as Sen
ator Teller is out of the Republican party
he will be put forward as tbe choice of the
Western free-silver men for President.
Plans are being made to bring a large
number of Colorado free-silver Repub
licans to Chicago when the National Demo
cratic Convention meets, and every one
will wear a Teller button.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
See the Venetian festival.
There is no hurry at St. Louis.
The Junta pressed the button and Gould
did the rest.
All that Daggett feels the need of now is
a larger hat.
When it is called a Gould victory the
Federal brigade smiles.
It is evident that Manager Hanna doesn't
believe in railroading things.
The Buckleyites won't bolt, because
they can't. They are cornered.
Buckley's retirement from politics has
now something compulsory about it.
Thurston's speech touched the right
chord and awoke a responsive harmony.
Cleveland's letter was evidently intended
merely as an expression of his tired feel
ing.
The memory of the famous Stockton
convention will be invoked by Democrats
no more.
Now that the Buckleyites are in a hole
the thing that grinds them most is that
Daggett dug it. '
As the populous East is not yet ready for
the money question we of the West must
perforce let it wait.
The Buckleyites found to their sorrow
that those who take front seats early are
liable to be bounced.
We may now look for Rainey, Daggett
and McNab to give the razz'e dazzle by
way of a ratification.
After the political fretting of the week
the Santa Cruz frolic will be the very thing
to recreate the State.
No one can complain that the St. Louis
convention did not give time and oppor
tunity for a full hearing.
. Protection will establish itself this year,
and then will come the campaign of edu
cation on the money question.
There is even some talk of Texas going
Republican this year just to show a fellow
feeling with the rest of the Union.
There are some things which can be
learned from words, but the glory of Santa
Cruz in her festal array must be seen.
If Daggett had only known how easily
he could do it, he wouldn't have strained
himself so much for the last three weeks.
It is pleasanter to be in Santa Cruz and
read of the conventions than to be in the
convention cities and read about the fes
tival.
' About the only prominent Democrat
who could be relied on to carry his own
State as a Presidential candidate is Sena
tor Tillman.
There may be some people with leisure
enough to read the Sacramento platform,
but those who do will regard it merely as
killing time.
I The eloquence of to-day at St. Louis
will be re-echoed through the country
until the voice of the people responds on
election day.

WHY SHOULD THEY BOLT ?
No doubt there is talk in spots of bolt-
ing the St. Louis ticket. There never was
a convention of a political party that did
not have to listen to threats of bolting.
It is the disappointed man's refuge. There
are always men who see nothing but de-
feat for any enterprise that is not built
upon lines., of their planning. There
never was a religious association, a
horse-racing club or a political or-
ganization that did not have its bolters,
but they do not always bolt. They gener-
ally have some one handy to hold them
back, arid if one escapes he is found
wandering about in political camps and
longing for the association and flesh-pots
of his own party. When the novelty of
bolting is worn off tbe bolter feels home-
sick, the more so when he finds that the
party continues to do business at the old
stand and that very tewof his old political
associates have any recollection of his ever
belonging to it. It is very foolish for a
man when out in the ocean to start for the
shore on foot simply because the officers
and crew of the boat do not sail her quite
to his liking. . , ' \
The Republican party is composed of
very sensible people, and sensible people
are never bolters. Without a doubt a
goodly number of Republicans are dis-
appointed at some of the work of the St.
Louis convention, but that was to be ex-
pected. The declarations of the con-
vention deal with the United States
as a whole, and they are intended
to work in an equalizing way, so
to speak, so that every business interest
and individual may reap the richest possi
ble harvest without depriving others of
their rights. It is an impossible task to
adjust a system of government to all the
needs of every locality, but the St. Louis
platform stands for the next best thing,
which is the advancement of all communi-
ties upon the strongest possible lines.
It is selfish in a community to want
to go ahead at the expense of its
neighbors. The growth of wealth in a
country like ours should be in a way that
every corner of it would participate in its
distribution. Such a course does not per-
mit Peter to be robbed to pay Paul. The
foundation of the Republican party's
policy of government is the betterment of
the ways of property accumulation for
the individual, but there are 70.000,000
people to .be benefited, and the purpose
oi the party is to equalize opportunity so
that one may not accumulate at the ex-
pense of another. The most striking and
most perfect system of reciprocal trade re-
lations the world ever saw is that
between the people of the United States
under protective tariff laws, tor it leaves
less than 5 per cent of the entire business
transactions of the people to be done with
other nations. If there is a hole anywhere
in such a system of trade and traffic
.through which a bolter would like to
creep, why, let him creep, but there is no
reason under the shining sun why he
should want to.
THURSTON PLEDGES THE PARTY.
The speech of Chairman John M. Thurs
ton was a string of polished sentences
woven into groups by masterly oratory.
Its theme was patriotism, and its purpose
the cementing of every American interest
in harmonious relation, the one to the
other, under the protecting care of the
mighty principles of the Republican party.
In the name of the Republican party the
convention's chairman promised to give
the people of the United States a govern
ment that shall strengthen the hands of
every business enterprise. Mill, factory
and furnace shall resume under conditions
that will give them a lease of profitable
life to continue for all time.
Wagemen shall rind opportunity to
secure continuous employment at remun
erative pay, and freed entirely from that
anxiety which hangs over one when he
knows his skill and brawn may be sup
planted at any boor by the introduction
of products kind red to those of bis own
hands from countries where workingmen
are held to be the mudsills of the social
and business edifice, and who are com
pensated accordingly.
The farmer shall no longer have the
price of the result of his sowing and reap
ing fixed and determined by the fellahs of
Asia, but by the demand of our own con
sumers, which will always equal the
supply.
The American citizen traveling in
foreign lands will have no fear of Weylers,
and the worthy industrial and liberty
loving foreigner shall have a welcome to
our shore that will inspire him to earn a
home of his own.
The whole of commerce shall be relieved
of the obstructions which the Democracy
has placed in their way, and peace and
prosperity and gladness shall drive away
uncertainty, enforced idleness and gloom.
All these things and more Chairman
Thurston pledged the Republican party to
do for the people, and the Republican
party will keep its pledge.
NEWSPAPERS AND COURTS.
It is not tne province of the newspaper to
discuss the merits of a lawsuit during trial,
or in any other way try to influence public
sentiment for or against either litigant,
except so far as an impartial recital of
facts as items ot news may bias public
opinion. When a great crime has been
committed, however, the indignation of
the public will not permit the newspaper
to be silent, whether the offender is on
trial or not. The public demands that the
newspaper shall explain all the bypaths
leading up to and away from the crime.
Moreover, the â¢ public insists that it not
only have a full report of the evidence and
incidents developed during the trial, but
that editorial analysis of the testimony
shall be made from time to time. The
application of a law principle is nothing
more nor less than obeying the demand of
the result of common-sense, dwelling upon
a given point of mental concentration.
But the right, the duty, in fact, of a
newspaper to criticize the decision of a
court or a verdict of a jury cannot be ques
tioned without endangering the liberties
of the people. Until Judges and juries
are clothed with superhuman wisdom, and
honesty, too, we might add, the newspaper
will be the only protection the people can
have against the tyranny of courts and the
dishonesty of juries. Certainly nearly every
Judge means to be fair and administer law
according to its spirit, as well as its letter,
and for the most Dart jurors mean to deal
justly between litigants, but Judges. and
juries are human beings possessing about
the same degree of depravity as other pc >-
pie. Not only so, but the commission
which elevates a man to the bench does
not impart wisdom or honesty to him, nor
does the jury-box assume to transform a
bribe-taker or an oath-breaker into an
honest man, much less a saint.
The New York Court of Appeals holds
that a court cannot punish for con tempt!
unless the offense was committed in the
presence of the court or the offender has
purposely disobeyed the orders of the
court, and that under no circumstances
has a court the right to punish an editor
or publisher of a newspaper for criticizing
it's acts or decisions. The public looks to '

| the official conduct of its servants. The
j law provides for ample redress if a Judge,
â  juror or any one 'else can prove that a
i newspaper has injured his reputation for
j honesty, sobriety and rectitude of conduct.
It is not presumption on the part of the
newspaper to say that although a Judge
may have honestly ruled in accordance
with his best and truest interpretation of
the law, It knows better than he when his
ruling is detrimental to the public's weal,
and that it has the right to tell him and
the public that his understanding of the
principles of law is weak and faulty.
! Were the newspaper denied the right to
I analyze Â»he conduct and decisions of our
Judges and comment upon them truly
and fully, it would be human nature for
our courts to degenerate into verdict bar-
gain-counters. ,:--.,'.':'
The honest newspaper never battles
against persons a* persons, but it does bat
tle for such principles of social and polit
ical government as will secure to all the
j people the greatest possible degree of per
gonal liberty, safety, happiness and pros
i perity. The honestly conducted newspa
| per keeps its finger, so to speak, on the
public's pulse all the time. It works to
allay undue public excitement lest harm
to the community should follow, ana it
works to excite concentrated action when
by reason of undue apathy danger threat-
ens. The newspaper is both the advance
and rear guard of civilization in its on-
ward march. .^r'/'i -
OUR SACRAMENTO SERVICE.
The early delivery of The Call at Sacra-
mento by special train during the sessions
of the Democratic Convention has been
met by an approving response from the
public, which is the more gratifying mas
much as it shows an appreciation of the
enterprise of legitimate journalism. We
have not attempted to vie with the sensa
tional papers of the day in the publication
| of fakes or in any form of catchpenny
i devices, but where the work of obtaining
I news, publishing news and distributing
: news has required something more than
j usual energy The Call, under its present
! management, has never failed and will
never fail to show a truly Californian vim
and vigor. t;i;
There is in every community a need of a
; wide-awake, alert, progressive \ newspaper
which is devoted to the domain of true
I journalism, and within that domain is
j equal to every demand of the time and the
j public. That requirement of intelligent
I men and women The Call fulfills in Cali
| fornia. Its dispatches, whether from the
I United Press or from its special corre
i spondents, are by this time well noted for
; their accuracy. People know they can rely
' upon what they read in The Call. There
! are no fakes in its news columns any more
I than in any other part of the paper. It
; gives all the news fairly and impartially,
j and what is more It sees to it that the
j news is delivered to the reader as early as
i he wishes it. ,
By means of its special trains The Call
reached Sacramento earlier than any
other paper. Its train on the first morn-
ing of the convention broke the record for
j speed between San Francisco aod that city.
t The papers were distributed in time for
i even the earliest risers to read them be
| fore breakfast and for the delegates to
! study the r ports of the whole situation
carefully before the work of the new day
; began. This was the kind of enterprise
j that gives a real news service to the pub
! lie, and is therefore the kind the people
j may count on from The Call. We not
i only "publish the news but we see that the
| reader gets it on time.
THE VENETIAN FESTIVAL.
The Venetian festival at Santa Cruz last
year excited the admiration of all who
saw it, and was the theme of praise in
every part of the State. It was so differ
ent from other festivals that it came into
rivalry with none, and gave to visitors
who had seen the gorgeous floral fetes of
other cities the sensation of a new beauty
and a new pleasure. The success accom
plished at that time has heightened the
popular expectations of the festival of this
year, and it was long ago assured the
attendance would be much larger and the
crowds more joyous than at the first fete.
Santa Cruz has many advantages as a
festival city. In fact, its charms are such
as to render it a favorite resort for pleasure
seekers at all seasons of the year and every
day of the season. It has every grace of
sea and mountain, every delight of climate
and sport and every comfort of good hotels
and pleasant homes. Noplace more at
tractive for the general run of tourists and
holiday-makers can be found anywhere in
the broad confines of California at this
season of the year, and a festival was hardly
needed to advertise its advantages as a
summer-time seaside resort.
The programme of the festivities includes
about everything that goes to make up
popular enjoyment. Every day of the
festival will be a pleasing one, and there
seems no question that every visitor will
be made to feel thoroughly "in the swim."
After the excitement of two political con
ventions this frolic comes as a most de
lightful means of closing the week, but no
one who can afford to do otherwise should
content himself with reading of it. Santa
Cruz should be seen.
CLEVELAND'S LETTER
No doubt the Democratic' party has
plenty of good and sufficient- reasons for
regretting that Grover Cleveland ever be
came its recognized leader, but it cannot
be said of him that he ever talks in riddles.
He is plain and blunt in : the use of
language, and there is no mistaking his
meaning. :Ji:.:~,
In his letter to the New York
Herald Mr. Cleveland laid down the
law of party allegiance in a way ;. that
is sure to make still greater ; trouble
and cause, the gap which separates
the factions to further broaden and deepen.
It was' not good politics for him to inti
mate that no self-respecting Democrat
could support the Chicago nominee on a
tree silver- platform, for such talk will have
a tendency to intensify the already bitter
feeling between the factions, but no doubt
he talked as he did for that very purpose.
It is a good deal for the leader of his
party, especially when he is President of
the Nation and is very much in need of
the indorsement of his party, to not only
encourage a bolt but to practically recom
mend his following to support the party's
most unrelenting and bitterest antagonist.
It is also very far from being good poll-'
tics to charge members of his party with
being unpatriotic and foolish, but that is ,
the way he talks about those who will con-
rol the Democratic National Convention.
He tells his party that he hopes the free
silver illusion will be dispelled before the
time comes to vote, but if it is not he shall !
expect nothing short of richly deserved de
feat. In view of the fact that the majority
of the party will do exactly the most un
patriotic and foolish thing that could be
done, as Mr. Cleveland sees it, it is safe to
conclude that it ie Mr. Cleveland's desire
that the nominee of his party's convention:
shall be defeated and rejected in the most;
humiliating way possible, which would be.
by the abandonment of him by the]
very element which the party has al- j
ways relied upon to commend it to the
confidence of the people.
Mr. Cleveland is moved to give this
warning against, the . silver wing of his
party because, as he says, "My attach
ment to true Democracy is so strong that
I consider its work identical with the pro-
motion of the country's good." If he is
sincere he could . not do otherwise than
recommend the Republican party to all
Democrats who .; consider the country's
good paramount; nor could he do other
wise than point out the danger to the
country of electing the Chicago nominee.
It is quite natural Mr. Cleveland should
say that the unpatriotic . and foolish
purpose of those who oppose him in the
ranks of his party will result in giving the
Republican party advantages both; in the
present and future which he thinks it does
not deserve, but as between a govern
mental policy such as the Bryans and
Altgelds of his own party would adopt
and the policy of the Republican party, as
a well-wisher for his country's good he is
obliged to recommend the latter to his fol
lowing. However, Mr. Cleveland only an
ticipates events. Democratic owners of
industrial plants are bound by the ties of
personal interest to reject whatever the
Chicago convention may offer them, for
it has come to this that they must have
such protective legislation as the Repub
lican party will give them or give up their
business enterprises.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Tarn McGrew, the Stanford man whose name
during the last four years has been associated
more than that of any other university stu
dent with the society events of the San Fran
cisco 400, left yesterday on the Australia on
his way to Korea, where he will be secretary
for a large English -mining syndicate.
It is said that this trip to so remote a place
has a bit of romance connected with it, and
that one of the local belles will change her
name when the traveler eventually returns
with more worldly experience and some of the
esthetic polish of society worn off by contact
with less polished surroundings than those of
the ballroom with which he has long been
most familiar. McGrew is over six feet iv
height, a graceful dancer, a pianist and a lin
guist. It was this last accomplishment that
insured him the position he has gone to fill.
During his senior year he sang bass in the
Stanford Glee Club, and was accompanist for
the glee and mandolin club events.
At Palo Alto he was looked upon as a sort of
Beau Brummel, but whatever that may signify
generally it was not there counted a serious
drawback to his popularity, for while he was a
member of the swell college societies he spent
J. Tarn McGrew-
much of his time with the boys in the big hall
where the hula-hula and kangaroo dances were
feature of impromptu evening programmes.
Something of the attitude of his fellow-stud-
ents toward him may be inferred from the fol-
lowing good-natured josh' which appeared in
this year's Stanford Quad under a caricature
representing McGrew in bloomer attire, golf
stockings aud high theater hat:
Oh, Lawn, McGrew !
The woman new :;.:â_.
Is nowhere when compared with you;
Those stockings, whew! â 
They change her view;
She must decline to wear them, too.

Honolulu with his parents before continuing
his voyage to the Orient. His father, Dr. Mc-
Grew, a pioneer of Hawaii, was known 'as "the
father of the revolution", that made Hawaii a
republic. McGrew l will remain in Corea a
year and will then return to America to enter

the profession that his father chose before

Mme. Marie Engle, the Chicago prima donna,
has just made another great j hit in London.
The opera was "Fra .Diavolo," and sung by
grand opera artists, made heavy by recitatives,
and accompanied by an orchestra ' of 100
pieces, it is said to have resembled a little
water-color picture, seen through a huge mag
nifying glass. Auber's fascinating little work
lost its freshness and charm in the immense
auditorium of Co vent Garden. Ferdinand de
Lucia is an excellent singer, but he has not
the presence nor the style of voice for the role
of Fra Diavolo. The celebrated, bass, Bisham
(Lord Rocburg), was not in sympathy with his
part, but Marie Engle sang the role of Zerlina
in the most fascinating fashion. Her voice
was declared to be fresh, true, well placed,
and her vocalization irreproachable. All she
wanted was a little warmth of manner in her
acting; but even without it, she has come for

year, as one of the great prima donnas of the

The lingering echoes of the wrath aroused
by Foil's ill-considered- remarks continue to
afford entertainment ; to people who take a
grim satisfaction in seeing an alleged critic
struggling heroically to prove that he is even
deeper in the woods than. people, at first sup
posed. When Foli registered his snarl at the
absence of oratorio as a permanent feature of
local musical circles, the alleged critic naively
wrote to a morning paper to proclaim the fact
that he had never heard of the gentleman.
The tree of knowledge has sprouted wonder
fully since then, and he Is now so intimately
acquainted with Foil's life that he can inform
the public not only what he has done, but what
he has left undone iv the course of his career.
The latest manifesto oh the subject 'is to the
effect that if Foli ever sung at- Bologna at all it
was not in the rignt season. The probability
is that he never did sing there; the city is
more noted for sausages than for; song, and
Foli, who has sung so often - in bis prime at La
Scala. the San Carlo and the Argentina, would
scarcely be tempted, .even by the delicious
sausages, to take an engagement in the little
burg of Bologna. _____ ' :; ; i

In honor of the Philological Society. The en
tertainment consisted of a lecture on Greek
music, illustrated by the rendering of Greek
compositions executed' on the original instru
ments, or rather on instruments constructed
according to the originals, by Victor Mahillon.
Gevaert's lecture was; a resume of .the Greek
part of the history of music, which be has just
published after . twenty years of labor. ' The
music consisted of a series of little airs and ex
ercises for the ancient zither, taken from an
anonymous book of Greek f music, collected
some time during the Roman empire; then
followed a "Hymn to the Muse" In.the Doric
style, and a ."Hymn to Nemesis," both written
in the second century after Christ, and the
famous "Hymn to Apollo." There were a num
ber of instrumental .pieces,' performed on a
tibia and an aulus, and to give local color to

A unique troupe of light : opera â¢ artists is

undertaking, as It is generally understood that
the backer of the company is a young and very
rich Duke, who is fascinated $ with a prima

been played with great success. The libretto
is founded on a historical novel, "The An

The city fathers of some of the smaller
Italian towns have sometimes an odd idea of
the compensation due to the performers in the
municipal bands. For instance, the city of

a month to the musician who shall be de-
clared the victor,' but if there Is no competi

to lower the salary to $5 a month.
A pretty story is told of the late Clara Schu

Party.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
is in serious trouble over the loss of the
Colima. L. A. Bfewer, many times a mil-
lionaire, has filed suits in New York in
sums that aggregate $1,500,000. His wife
and three children were drowned in the
ill-fated ship and the husband now wants
justice â revenge. Money, he avers,
cannot restore him the happiness he en-
joyed in the bosom of his family, and
since all he loved has been reft from him
by the "culpable negligence'! of the steam-
ship company he proposes using his mil-
lions in fighting damage suits against the
Huntington corporation. â 
The Brewer suits are brought promi
nently before the public by the prpspective
sudden departure for New York of General
Manager R. P. Schwerin and Captain
Henry Bingham, chief stevedore for the
' Mail Company. /
Accompanying them are two of the dock
foremen and some of the survivors of the
crew of the Colima. The case is probably
coming to trial and the witnesses are
wanted. ,A strange feature of the whole
proceeding is that Charles Cushing, one
of the survivors of the disaster, is now
holding a place in the gift of; the company.
He will be one of Huntington's witnesses
during the trial.
It is asserted that Brewer will create a
sensation during the trial. The Colima's
j career from the day she was launched to
j the hour she sank has been carefully
| scanned, and the plaintiff will attempt to
j prove that at no time was the steamer
! considered a good sea boat. Toward her
latter days it will be shown that she was
worn out, weighted by too hamper and
should have been condemned.
The Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers will
also get an overhauling, as it is. asserted
j that they did very little in the way of fore-
ing the true story of the disaster from the
lips of unwilling witnesses. Brewer has
the depositions of some thirty or forty
witnesses from Central America and Mcx-
ico, all of whom state that the Colima was
cranky. Schwerin, Bingham and other
Mail Company employes will swear the
opposite, and so the legal battle will go
on. Should Brewer win a hundred other
suits will be begun, and that would practi
cally mean bankruptcy for the Mail Com-
pany. * -'Â»â¢; * r --,'*< -;
General Manager Schwerin is at San
Mateo to-day, and he has arranged to leave
for New York next Monday. He expects
to be absent an indefinite length of time
in connection with the suits.
On the same day the plaintiff in the big
suit will leave for New York. It is not
known that General Manager Schwerin
and Mr. Brewer will travel by the same
route or in the same Pullman. If they do
it might indicate that the suit for $1,500,
- would be settled before the train got to
the Mississippi River.
â¢ Mr. Brewer was seen last night at the
Occidental Hotel. He preferred not to
give out any facts in regard to the partic
ulars of the complaint.
"I shall leave for New York next Mon-
day," he said. "I don't care to say
! whether my attorneys are San Francisco
jor New York attorneys. Ido not want to
talk about damages. I expect to get out
|of the suit. I prefer not to talk about it
jat all. . I am. now. making arrangements

DRUIDS DISCUSS
A RELIEF BOARD.
Many Measures Considered
by the Grand Grove
Yesterday.
DUNAND'S WARM FIGHT
The District Distress Fund Is
Rejected After Due Con-
sideration.
MEET NEXT IN PETALUMA
Evening Devoted to a Ball, Banquet
and Entertainment ~, in Odd
Fellows' Hall)
Yesterday's session of the Grand Grove,
United Ancient Order ,of Druids, was in
teresting throughout, anil many important
measures came up for discussion during
the day. /. -,Â»^ 'Â»/â ".. '
The principal subject to which the body
devoted itself in the morning* was the dis
trict fund some, members wished to see
established in San Fraucisco. This was
one of L. F. Dunand's pet measures, and
he made a'hot fight for its passage.
"The question is a vital one with us in
California," he said.,. "Take, for instance,
a grove with a depleted treasury. What
inducement is there for any one to join it?
We have no district fund, much less an
equalized system. The lodge surrenders
its charter, and the aged memberâ where
is., he? ". -'-J'' Â'''â¢""-â .'...,â '". '
' "Now, to build up our* order we must
provide ways and means to guarantee to
those we ask to join us, particularly in
far-away parts of California, that come
weal or woe, success of the grove or fail
ure, tho Druids of the districtâ if not
of the entire Stateâ are between them and
trouble. " ' \
â¢'Such legislation will be only justice
and productive of much . good. We ask
the representatives to ' give the matter
some attention, and, if satisfied, then to
take some action upon it." .. ; ,
After | considerable | discussion pro and
con. the matter was laid over till the after
noon session.
. A projected relief board would
differ from the other relief boards
of the order, in that it would be under the
jurisdiction of the Grand Grove and would
be situated in San Francisco. ; ;/t;?'
Besides, it would legislate for the entire
country and for the sick only. No relief
board has ever yet been under the juris
diction of the Grand Grove.
It was decided to hold the next annual
meeting of ; the Grand Grove at Petaluma,
to convene on the second Tuesday of June,
1897. Â/â¢;.;///â /;,.; :! -5:;. '"" '
Fifteen new delegates were received this
morning and "j invested \ with j the Grand
Grove degree./ Tha election of officers for
the coming year will take place to-day,
presumably at the morning's session.
'.. In the afternoon the district distress
fund, laid over from the morning session,
was thoroughly discussed and was finally
rejected by the Grand Grove. ;
"\ Then the matter of a relief board was
again brought up, and after being actively
discussed by the members, was referred
to the committee to frame a law which, in
their best 'judgment, would | meet the exi
gencies of the case. ' / .'.
; The appeal case of Charles Patocchi
against San Jose Grove No. 23 was then
brought up. The committee reported ad
versely to i appellant lon the ground that
the matter was outlawed, which report
was adopted by the Grand Grove after a
long discussion participated in by nearly
every member present. L. F. Dunand
made * a stirring speech in behalf of Pa-;
tocchi, but for once he was overruled.
The report of the committee on griev
ances and appeals was adopted. 'â¢. ' -{,
| At 4 o'clock the Grand, Grove adjourned
and had its picture taken. Â
At night they had a grand entertain-
ment, ball and banquet at Odd Fellows'
Hall. It is expected that the Grand Grove
will finish its business and adjourn finally

BOTTLES MAKE TROUBLE
Inferior Stoppers Cause a False Report
to Go : Out That Point Reyes
'..;* Cream Is Impure.
In regard to the Alameda reports of im
pure bottled cream, Manager r Russell of
the â '. Point Reyes Company says that * the
cream became unsuitable for use owing to
an inferiority in the. bottles, which was
not discovered until after a few of them
had been filled and sent out. -
/ The, trouble was that the stoppers of the
bottles were not airtight, as J they should
have been and were guaranteed to be by
the ; manufacturers of the bottles. When
the air got into the bottles it spoiled the
cream./ / / '_â *.-
Manager Russell says the company was
imposed on by the ? manufacturers of the
bottles, - and that / the ' company is not
responsible for j the spoiled cream. He is
calling in the Inferior bottles as rapidly as
possible. - w;.;*; .//'â /.-/,--'-/ //â -:: ..:;â -. . L

INSURANCE MEN SURPRISED.
Trouble in the City Agency of the
Alliance Company on Califor

agents on California street for many years,

fore.
Those who were most directly interested
in Parks in .insurance circles j admitted
their complete surprise and. indeed, said
thay felt concerned over his absence.
Parks was \ confidential j manâbook
keeper, cashier, etc.â for Varney W. Gas
kill, City agent for the Alliance Company
of London under the - general manage
ment of N. T. James. The Alliance is one
of tbe large English corporations con
ducting a fire insurance business here. Its
Pacific Coast business last year was $134,
-423, a very large proportion of which was
done |in San Francisco. This large vol
ume of local transactions passed through
Gaskili's office and consequently through
Parks' hands. â  â  - -â¢ \.>;-
Now Parks was trusted. There was no
reason to suspect thai anything out of the
ordinary could be , found in the accounts
of the City agent's office, and so all went
along ; smoothly with a balance on the
right side. The smooth progress of things,
however, it appears, was interrupted the
other day when Mr. Parks did not put in
an appearance at his desk aa usual.
The ; first intimation on the outside of
the office that all was not well was when
Varney Gaskill told some insurance men
that Parks had taken French leave./
He admitted that his "trusted' employe
had gone away in. a most unceremonious
manner, without even leaving the least
word as to where he intended i spending
the summer. ,
"The last we heard ;of him," said Gas
kill, "was in a furnishing-goods store,
where Parks bought some traveling shirts
and other clothes needed for a long jour-
ney. He said he was in a great hurry as
he wanted to catch a train, and appear-
ances sustained his remarks*to the store
keeper. I'd like to know where he is now.
"My books are short fully $500, and I
don't know how much more may.be dis
covered." .',"â¢'''â -- ' ;: J
Gaskill had to employ a new man to go
over the books and also keep up the daily
work of ; the; office. He appeared to be
greatly disturbed over the whole matter. .
From' insurance men who knew Parks for
years it was learned that he had * been \in
trouble" once before. That was about two
years ago, when Parks was general agent of
the German Insurance Company of Pitts
burg, in which be succeeded E. P. Farns
; worth & Co. * / -,â â â '.-.,'
Ed Farnsworth was a good friend of
Parks, as subsequent events proved. Parka

The Unknown Victim Had Been Pros-
The Unknown Victim Had Been Pros-
pecting Around Sonora for
Some Time. /
SONORA, Cal., June 17.â Thurs
day three cattlemen â Billy Hunter, an In
dian, Alvin Shaw and Roascoâ who went
out looking for some stray calves in the
jawbone country. About forty miles from
Sonora, while passing a canyon the horse
of Roasco suddenly snorted, which made
his rider look around.
He noticed the remains of a recent fire
and exclaimed: '"Boys, they have killed
and cooked one of our calves and buried
the hide," and then began to look for a
likely place where it might have been
buried. The search was soon rewarded by
noticing a recently dug and covered-up
hole.
Roasco at once proceeded to open it up,
when, to his horror, he perceived sticking
out from the earth the hand of a human
being. So scared was he and the remain
der of his party that they at once repaired
to a camp, six miles distant, without mak
ing any further investigations. On reach
ing camp they at once sent word to Sonora.
Deputy Sheriffs Lee Pierce and Jim Don
ohue set out at 4 p. m. Saturday, accom
panied by Coroner Burden and his son
Harry. On reaching Roasco Camp with
out delay they set out for the scene of the
tragedy.
The body was at once exhumed and
washed, as it was perfectly nude, and at
the back of the right ear was found a bul
let wound which must have immediately
proved fatal, while other gunshot wounds
were found on the body extending from
the right to the left hip.
A bullet-wound was also found through
the tongue.
After Coroner Burden had covered the
body in an oilskin and wrapped it care
fully in clean blankets, tbe body was again
buried and a monument of stones erected
over it so that in future, should his rela
tives be found and it is deemed advisable,
be might be buried elsewhere.
The sheriffs, meanwhile, were busy
looking for any evidence that might lead
to tbe identity of the dead man or his
cowardly murderer or murderers, and
among the ashes unearthed several but
tons, a part of a brace or strap and buckle
and one or two pieces of wearing apparaL
About 100 feet from where the fire had
been started were picked up two pieces of
a photograph, which showed the face of a
man identical with that of the deceased,
while on the lower part of a photograph
were the words in gilded letters "Max
well's Gallery, Spokane Falls, Wash."
With this slight clew to work on the
two Sheriffs started out to find the cow
ardly assassin. They soon got a clew and
followed it up closely, with the result that
on Monday night about 6 o'clock they
came upon the camp of the murderer on
Big Creek, about six miles above Grove
land. - 'â¢â 'f-Sy;
Here four pack animals were found un
saddled; and the suspected party, in com
pany with a traveling peddler, was trying
to take things easy. After the officers had
talked with the man for some time he was
told to consider himself under arrest for
murder, on which he turned ghastly, pale
and at the same time great beads of sweat
poured down his face and he trembled
violently.
The prisoner, whose name is McMillan,
was at once started on his trip to Sonora's
County Jail. This afternoon his com
panion, the peddler, was also arrested, not
for complicity in the crime, but as a possi
ble valuable witness. He will be charged
with peddling without a license.
Among the arrested man's effects were
a shotgun and some No. 4 shells, identical
in every way with those picked up in the
ashes. The murderer had hoped that by
stripping his victim's body and burning
his clothes all evidence would be removed,
but by a wonderfully fortunate chance
enough had escaped the flames to bring
home to the cold-blooded assassin the
guilt of his awful crime.
The dead man had been prospecting
around here for some time and his identity
will soon be established. Sonora is loud
in its praises over the clever capture made
by the Sheriffs. ';/â â¢â ;? ;*â¢
SUICIDE NEAR ELK GROVE.
A Young Farmer Leaves a Wife and
Three Children.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June James
Miller Redding, a farmer living near Elk
Grove, in this county, shot and killed him
self yesterday morning. About 3 o'clock
he called to hie son for a drink of water,
which was given him and the son returned
to bed. A few minutes later he heard a
pistol shot and he and his mother ran in
and found Redding lying unconscious on
the bed with a pistol bullet in his head.
He. lived until 9 o'clock, but never spoke.
No cause is assigned for the act, other than
that the deceased had been drinking. He
was a native of Maine, 39 years of age and
leaves a, wife and three children.

"Big Battalions" at Sea.
It was the First Napoleon who made, the
cynical remark that Providence is on the
side .of , the biggest battalions ; and ; al
though undoubtedly experience was
largely crystallized in the remark, he had
himself many 5 instances to prove that
there was not a few exceptions to the
rule. It may well be questioned whether
the statement will not be found to be far
more nearly literahy true of naval than of
military . operations. The big â¢: battalions
â the fully equipped . battle-ships, the
best steaming ' power," the best and
moat far-sighted arrangements â these,
far more than mere dash and hardi
hood, are likely to be the controll
ing factors in the success of nations
hereafter when they engage in naval
wars. The nation which has added to
efficient sailors and undaunted men the
greatest number of ships fitted with all
modern, appliances 'â : for warfareâ the best
guns, the soundest armor, the most avail
able steam power may be said to have as
sured success. Mere bravery, a little more
or less, will do little except in rare and un
likely cases; superior skill in seamanship
will but seldom have the opportunity ol
making its influence felt; even the quick
ness and deftness of expedient with which,
rightly or wrongly, we as a people are apt
to credit ourselves beyond : others, will
only in rare cases have a chance of show
ing themselves. . It will be the ships, the
guns, and possibly most of all the steam
ing power of the vessels, that will tell.

Brown came up in the Superior Court this
morning to be sentenced for burglary, hav
ing pleaded guilty. When asked if he had
anything to say be stood up and made a
rambling statement which showed very
plainly that he was weak-minded.
He said that he could swear that he saw
snakes even when he had not been drink

treatment. " ' .'â¢"'.', -.',
"I ain't just what you would call crazy,
but I'm just a fool. I never could learn

BAKERSFIELD SCALP CASE.
Ex-Deputy County Clerk Packard Is
Arraigned for Trial.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., June 17.â The
trial of H. L. Packard, ex-Deputy County
Clerk, on a charge of falsifying records in
coyote scalp certificates, came up
to-day. Packard was indicted by the
famous Long Grand Jury, and the specific
charge is that he issued a certificate for one
; scalp to J. B. Batz, present County Treasu
rer, and entered it on the books as for ten
scalps. ' '^:;
Deputy Attorney-General C. H. Post of
Sacramento is here to try the case. The en
tire day was spent in obtaining ten jurors
and the venire was exhausted. A special
venire was ordered for to-morrow.
POLICEMEN AND ADIPOSITY.
Why Does Life on the Force Increase
Nearly Every One's Weight?
It has often been a source of wonder why
the policemen in the cities of America are
so fat. In the older monarch - ridden
countries of the world obesity is to be
found on the bench of the lower magis
tracy. Among savages the monarchs
alone are fat. Without making a scientific
mystery of it, the cause of adiposity
among these somewhat related classes is
the same in all three they are overfed
and underworked.
A police surgeon has recently given
voice to some opinions on the case of a fat
policeman, a very fat policeman, indeed,
and thence with Machiavellian art has
proceeded to formulate an essay on the
fatness of policemen in general. The po
liceman weighed 380 pounds when the sur- !
geon first began to observe him, but in the I
course of a four months' illness fie dwin- \
died to 240 pounds, and still the surgeon
believed him to be too fat. We are pre-.
pared to believe it. In the course of fits
general remarks he makes one startling
statement, namely: "The life of a police-
man is at best a very inactive one." It is
surprising that this should be the fact.
True, observation of our individual police
men is mostly associated with seeing them
leaning against lampposts, chatting easily
with acquaintances or with each other, or
else standing before some building which
they are set to guard. The peculiarly imper
ceptible way in which they manage to get
from point to point does not quite convey j
the idea of motion, yet when the compla- i
cent citizen thinks of the "force" as |
"guardians of the peace," the idea of sup- j
pleness, alertness, swiftness, arises em- ]
bodied before his mind's eye in an ideal
! body of police. This ideal is plainly 'what i
Darwinians would call a "survival." The !
modern policeman in these United s States
has put an envelope of fat upon it. . . ,
Proceeding with his general remarks the
surgeon said : "Any one can notice that as
soon as a man is appointed on the force he
begins to increase in weight and belt
measurement, his muscles become flabby,
and as a result of all this he moves
more slowly , than . was his wont." j
Precisely, therefore, at , the ' period !
when we imagine him smartened out of j
the loose conditions of civilian life, I
straightened by discipline and urged by the !
traditions of bis new calling to a foxlike
activity, he is, it seems, accumulating fat |
and settling down into a* lumbering object :
in uniform, with an ever expanding belt
and an ever increasing aversion to
locomotion. That a low morale may
follow in the same ratio â  should not
be incredible. . When r Shakespeare
makes Falstaff apologize for his gen
eral want of moral tone, does not Sir John
say, "Thou seestlhave more flesh than an-
other man, and therefore more frailty"?
This plea, so far as we are aware, was not
interposed even by the police themselves
to meet the charges of corrupt dealing
formerly urged against them in various
quarters, but it is clearly worth â  consider-
ing. -!;-;;;'.'â  , :,
And why should not the converse of the
proposition be taken to heart? Would it
not be well to guard against frailty, while
giving a desirable spring to constabulary
heels, by forbidding fatness on the force?
There is, no doubt, some connection
between mental and physical states.
Without straining the point to find
an intimate link between rotundity and
rascality, it is a very clear { proposition
that the will to catch a light-footed thief is
modified by the inability to run a mile,
say. Exercise, such as might be had in
the station-houses, combined with an or-
der to run round their beats, say, twice a
day, would be some corrective, but ulti
mately, as in every case of obesity without
exception, fat can only be controlled by a
proper dietary. Obesity has only one
meaning overfeeding.
Tell that to any fat manâ policeman or
other and be will be indignant. Men
tion it to a lady who has passed beyon d
the state good-naturedly indicated by that
troublesome word embonpoint and you
may preDara to deal with hysterics;
but it is most true. Fat is the
superfluity of the heat supply of
the body. The policeman who has been a
workman finds . himself better paid than
ever before and. with much less to do. He
eats better and richer food; he lingers
longer over it. < As ?he has no mus
cular exercise to take up the increased
heat supply., nature condemns him to
carry.it around.- He grows fat. The rea
soning applies to bankers, brokers, mer-
chants and manufacturers, to the lay
and the clerical, to the "stout" lady at
the opera as to the "fat lady" in the mu
seums. It is to be hoped that the informa
tion about the police, which we have
called startling, and is truly so, shall not
fail of notice among those who have con-
trol in pplice circles, as it should not be
lost on y^he fat of those who are fattening
in anywalk of life. Do not overeat.â

Why They Kept the Dog.
The dog has often ; been called man's
best friend, and one knows how often his
presence in the house is worth more than
any amount of ; moral maxims for the
children. A very suggestive little instance
of this cropped up recently at Corydon, on
tie bearing of a summons for keeping a
dog without a license. The offense was
admitted, but the defendant's wife pleaded
that she only kept the animal because the
children were so fond of it.
At that moment sbe had a little girl ill,
and she would not take her â¢ medicine un
less her mother pretended to give it to the
dog first. No doubt the child's principles
were "Love me, love my dog." and if the
nauseous medicine was necessary for the
good of y the animal the doggie's y little
friend thought it must be good enough for
her. No wonder the magistrate adjourned
the case. : This story reveals such a valu
able discovery in domestic medicine that
we certainly think this .dog sought, to be
allowed ;to get liberty and ?. to : have no
license.â Westminster Gazette.

DUNHAM'S PLOT MISCARRIES.
His Unfortunate Babe No Longer Sole
Heir to His Grandfather's Large
Estate.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 17.â The
Herald says: George F. Dyer of San Fran-
cisco, who is now at the Astor House,
stopped over in Washington on his way to
New York and .helped to discover a sur
vivor of the McGlincy family of San Jose.
On Wednesday* May 27, James C. Dun-
ham, son-in-law of Colonel R. P. McGlin-
cy, exterminated the family, consisting
of six persons, committing one of the most
extraordinary crimes of the century. The
only living human being left on the Mc-
Glincy ranch was Percy Osborne Dun-
ham, the infant son of the murderer and
of Hattie McGlincy 'Dunham.
"When I left San Francisco," said Mr.
Dyer yesterday, "the officers of the law
were in search of Dunham. He had been
seen near San Miguel. He had called at
a house near Bradley ; he had been tracked
\ to Santa Ysabel Valley and was believed
to be in hiding in Indian Gulch. The offi
cers from San Jose said they had traced
him nearly to the Mexican border, finally
losing sight of him in the wild mountains
of the Coast Range. There has not been
so much excitement in California over a
murder for years.
"When I reached Washington I stopped
over to see J. A. McDowell of the Coast
Survey, who had been a mining friend of
mine years ago. McGlincy had at one
time been interested in, mines on the
famous mother lode in Amador County,
where I own the Doyle and Muldoon prop-
erties, and Mr. McDowell asked me what
estate Colonel McGlincy had left. I said
about $75,000, which would go to his grand-
son, the murderer's infant child.
'Not by any means,' was McDowell's
reply. 'Colonel McGlincy's own sister,
Eva McGlincy, is at work here now in the
next room.''
"I found Miss McGlincy as he had said
and put her in possession of the facts
about the murder of her brother and his
family. She had only seen the brief news-
paper announcement.
"I at once telegraphed my discovery to
E. L. Campbell of ti-e Mills building, San
Francisco, a lawyer who is interested with
, me in mines in Amador Count?, and re
j tamed him to act as Miss McGlincey's at-
torney.
"In the absence of any other motive, it
has been my theory of this remarkable
crime that Dunham killed the McGlincys
to make bis infant son heir to the prop-
erty. . â¢//.:-:-,:,^'>-X
'.'Miss Eva McGlincy's appearance on
the scene will change these plans, I ima
gine. ..- She is about 40 years old, an esti
mable lady and has worked in the Govern-
ment service for many years. Colonel
McGlincy originally went West from
Washington, I believe. Miss McGlincy
has never seen her brother's ranch. She
was surprised when I suggested that she
was the heir to the property."
Miss McGlincy's Washington residence
is in an apartment-house close by the
Capitol. She has started for California.
FIRST CATCH YOUR HARE.
I Minnie Schessler' s Father Wants ,000
From Murderer . Dunham.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 17.â Jacob A.
Schessler, father of Minnie Schessler, the
hired girl in: the McGlincy family, who
was killed by James C. Dunham, will sue
Dunham for $25,000 damages for the loss of
his daughter.
The action is one of simple damages for
the loss of the daughter's services. Plain-
tiff claims he is old and was dependent
largely if not entirely upon his daughter
for support She was cheerfully laboring
to lift a mortgage on the humble home of
the family here. Her death deprived the
father of her support, love and society, and
he asks for judgment for $25,000 against
the absent murderer.
Attorney H. V. Morehouse has taken the
case and says it will be a fight to a finish
to test the law. The young woman was of
age, but the claim is made that this does
not bar the action, since she gave her ser
vices to her father and was working with
the distinct understanding and avowed
purpose of clearing the mortgage on her
i father's home.
LOS ANGELES EXCITED.
A Florence Rancher Reports Having Met

LOS ANGELES, Cal.,' June 17.â Los
Angeles does not propose to be behind in
the hunt for Murderer Dunham. A report
was current here this afternoon that a
rancher near Florence had met and talked
with the sextuple murderer, who had
stopped by the wayside to rest. "The mur
derer was a regular walking arsenal, which
fact caused the rancher to interview . ex-
Marshal Gard, who has Dunham's picture.
Thereupon the farmer declared his belief
that the stranger ;he had met headed for
this city was none other ; than the Simon-
Pure Dunham, Marshals, detectives, Sher
iffs : and the whole constabulary of 5 Los
Angeles are on the lookout for the missing
fiend to-night, spurred to extra activity,
perhaps, by the vision of the big reward
for Dunham's scalp. - ' .

ONLY A BABY TORNADO.
It Pays a Brief, but Lively Visit
to the CarpiDteria
Valley.
Orchards Are Ruined and Buildings
Damaged, but Nobody' Seri
ously Hurt.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., June 17.â A
genuine little tornado came in from the
sea yesterday afternoon and swept through
Carpinteria Valley,' disappearing over the
mountain range. Fortunately its ravages
were confined to a district but thinly popu
lated and consisting of large ranches with
but few buildings.
A few tough old live oaks were leveled
by the storm and a track cut through
orchards, but no persons were injured or
buildings materially damaged so far as
heard from. ,
Persons who witnessed the approach of
this tornado describe the scene as extraor
dinary.
Carpinteria lies direct along the sea
shore and consists of a level valley, rising
where it approaches the mountain. A
heavy bank of fog was lying over the sea
and along the shore, when a black, â 
f unneledshaped cloud came cutting the fog
like a knife scattering the mist on either
side into great waves, whose surge was
plainly visible, and speeding through the
valley, cut a track to the hills.
Santa Barbara County can claim the
distinction of having experienced the only
three cyclones, or more properly
speaking, tornadoes that have ever
visited Califorvia, and, although these
were baby tornadoes, they have yet been
demonstrations of sufficient dignity to dis
countenance any sneering. Last year
one of these clouds in the dead of night
descended upon the upper Santa Ynez
Valley, tearing a big barn to splinters and
lifting a threshing machine, cooking out
fit, shanty and ail over a fence and setting
it safely down on the other side.
j The most notable of these phenoma !
visited Barbara in the winter of '77. j
A heavy southeaster , had been prevailing
all day. At 8:30 in the evening a column j
of electric fire was seen by watchers on the j
water front to detach itself from the heavy j
mass of clouds and fly rapidly shoreward. I
A lumber' schooner lying at the wharf I
was driven completely through it, cutting
the wharf in two and badly damaging the
vessel. It then struck the land, seeming
to lift in true cyclone style/taking a path
west of State street, below Dibble hill, up
De Lavina street and out in the direction
of Hope Ranch, where it is believed to
have entered the sea.
At Mr. Tierney's residence on De la \
Vina street it twisted a new barn around j
on its foundation, lifted a heavy farm j
wagon over the fence and deposited it in
the back yard of his neighbor, Mr. Boeder,
and lifted some lighter articles into trees
in the yard of the Bradbury home.
Farther up the street a well-known resi
dent had a pet calf lifted from its corral
and safely deposited in the branches of a
tall tree, whence it was rescued with diffi
culty. In passing over its course it. top- i
pled down a brick chimney on the house
of Elder Goss, killing bis young son. This
tragedy alone presented a serious side to a
phenomenon which was in its other phases
merely a very picturesque and amusing
prank of nature.
ONE OF THE SHORTEST STRIKES.
Bow a Popular Superintendent Brought
About an. Understanding. ;
"J. Q. Van Winkle, general superintend
ent of the Big Four, . once .. made the
quickest settlement iof a big strike on
record," said the old-timer. "It was at
Springfield, Ohio, I think. The men, or
a great portion of them, had gone out, and
an effort was made to get the J others to
strike. Van Winkle arrived and found the
town placarded with notices that there
was to be a mass-meeting of railroad men
at a certain ball to take some action on
the strike. ' He said that he would attend
the meeting. The men were inclined to
be turbulent, and an attempt was made to

STILL IN QUEST OF COIN
fl. F. Marshall Wants Fifty
Thousand Dollars for Three
Damaged Teeth.
His Feelings Were Injured Also.
Suit Commenced Against J D.
Spreckels.
H. F. Marshall, who was thrashed by
John D. Spreckels in The Call office one
night in April last, has sued the capitalist
for ; $50,000 ; damages. The reason why
Marshall was thrashed will now; be made
known through the courts, and if the suit
has been brought for the purpose of f plac
â¢ ing certain men on the witness-stand and
bringing certain things to light it has not
been brought in vain. The truthâ the
truthâ will be made known.
On that , never-to-be-forgotten mile post
in Mr. Marshall's picturesque career, he
lost the lower halves of three of his front
teethâ highly valued teeth were âand
acquired a large and varied collection of
lacerations and bruises. Mr. Marshall's
feelings were â  likewise bruised and lacer
ated to a degree painful to contemplate.
The owner ;of the teeth and feelings-
valued at $50,000â engaged several months
ago, with two or three others in a little
scheme to obtain Â»a | large sum -of money
from Mr. Spreckels, in exchange for which
they promised to secure for him the in
fluence and votes of the American Protec
tive Association in California.
The scheme was a flat "failure, but out of
its ruins the owner of the teeth and feel-
ingsâvalued at $50,000â constructed what
to the American eyes of himself and his
confederates promised bis results. . An
affidavit was prepared by Marshall, in
w: ich he swore that the A." P. A. had been
sold to Mr. Spreckels for a valuable consid
eration by President Hudelson. - This piece
of perjury was to be the conspirators' stock
in trade.
They were to take the document to Mr.
Spreckels and tell him that if he did not
pay them $60,000 they would take it to the
Monitor and the Chronicle, by which it
would be published, to his great and last
ing injury. To let Mr. Spreckels "down
easy" they agreed to give him, in return
for the money, a claim upon a mine,
which probably has no existence.
After-events have proved that the con-
spirators did not dream for a moment that
their proposed victim wouldjdefy them.
Mr. Marshall essayed thejdelicate task
of approaching the capitalist on the sub
ject. He found Mr. Spreckels in the busi-
ness office of The Call and made known
the wants of himself and his fellow-con
spirators. Mr. Marshall is a divinity stu-
dent, but no blush suffused his cheek, no
tremor disturbed his tongue as he made
bis demand for blackmail.. He was asked
where the mine was located, but he could
not tell. t
He was asked where the owner could be
found, and again he confessed his ignor
ance. Finally he admitted that the mine,
so far as he knew, had no existence.
Whenever Mr. Marshall writes the obitu
ary of his lost teeth he will date the event
the moment after he confessed that the
mine, so far as he knew, was a myth. Mr.
Hpreckels arose and thrashed him with
vigor and enthusiasm. Subsequently Mar
shall signed an affidavit declaring that the
mine had no existence, and then he was
taken to his home, where he slowly con
valesced. ;.V;* '>x':::
HISTORY OF A GOLD PIECE.
Jefferson Davis Bad It When Captured
and It Now Belongs to Gen. Church. '
It was a noticeable fact in connection
with the recent exercises of the unveiling
and dedication of the General Hancock
statue that General Miles, commander-in
chief of the army, who was in command
of the military parade, made a decided
change of the personnel of his staff officers
for the occasion. > . â¢ < 'â¢ '. ;â ..
When the war closed General Miles was
in command of the First Division of the
Second Army Corps, which was . com
manded by General Hancock. Of the half
dozen officers then composing General
Miles' staff, four still survive, and these
were present to take part in the statue un
veiling ceremonies. One came all the
way from North j Dakota, another from
Michigan, the third from Ohio, and the
fourth from New York, and they had not
all been together before for twenty-five
years.
When making up a list of those who
should compose his staff for. the occasion
General Miles paid a very graceful tribute
to his old staff officers by announcing that
as president of the Society of the t Second
Army Corps and the ranking officer under
General Hancock, he felt that he would be
justified in choosing the few survivors of
his old staff, to the exclusion, of his pres
ent staff. As a consequence General Miles
marched on foot down Pennsylvania ave
nue with the four members of his former
staff at the head of the parade, as they had
so often marched or â  ridden :on other far
more dangerous occasions more than thirty
years before.
General Nathan Church,, the Michigan
representative of the quartet of old staff
officers who rose from captain; to colonel
of tbe famous Twenty-sixth Michigan,
and then to 'â â  assistant adjutant-general
and chief of staff under General Miles,
showed with much pride while; in Wash
ington ass gold piece that has a wonder
ful history. . , When General Church's
regiment was to be mustered out in 1865,
General Miles requested the War; Depart
ment to allow him to retain his chief of
staff in the service, which ' request was
granted, and for six months after.his regi
ment had gone home, and until he de
clined to remain longer. General? Church
was with General Miles at Fort Monroe,
their principal duty .being to guard their
distinguished prisoner -of war, Jefferson
Davis. ..."
When captured Mr. Davis had 'in his
pocket the gold . piece in question and a
Mexican " silver dollar. General:. Church
procured other silver pieces anil effected
an exchange for the two found in Mr. Da
vis' pocket." He retained the gold piece
and gave the dollar to ] Major. Black, the
Dakota 1 member of | the [ four who were
present at the , recent exercises, and who
had 'been his tentmate. y A y few months
thereafter Major Black was showing his
famous dollar at an evening gathering,
passing it from one to another, when it
suddenly disappeared, and he has . ever
since mourned for his lost treasure. â 
/General Church had better luck, how
ever, with-; his gold piece, and while he
occasionally exhibited |it to -his friends,
carried {it asa: much-prized \ pocket piece
for twenty-five years, when he suddenly
discovered that lhe had unintentionally
paid ?it y out '; instead iof - another similar
.piece of money he carried with it; but to
whom he had not the slightest recollection.
He promptly directed the cashier of ' his
bank to lay aside any $5 gold pieces bearing
the date of 1857 that might pass, through
his hands in the course of business, think
ing there might be possibly one chance in
a million that the valuable keepsake would
some time make it appearance. Six weeks
afterward an .-old \ farmer dropped in and
made a small deposit, >: when the cashier
said to . Mr. Church: "Here! see if, that's
the gold ; piece you \ are looking for." He
took it, and was : overjoyed to find ; the dis
tinsuishing marks he had placed upon the
coin when it first left Mr. Davis' pocket
and found â . its j way into his own. Â Since
then the precious piece has been kept care
fully wrapped I and \ safely secured /against
another disappearance, .yyyyyyy .â "
â  While in Paris five or six years ago Gen
eral Church was a guest one evening : at
the home of 'a . wealthy family who had
formerly resided in New York. â¢> In some
way the â¢ hostess V learned that he had
helped to guard Mr. Davis while he was a
prisoner of war, and she said, wiih ' much
apparent satisfaction : "I have a Mexican
dollar that ' was [ taken from Mr. y Davis'
pocket at that time which "I value very .
highly." Without betraying the anxiety
he felt, "'. Mr. Church asked when and
where she obtained it, and was told that
it had been presented : to the late Presi
dent Andrew Johnson : while he occupied
the White House, and that she being his
near relative, it had fallen to her on the
aistriDUtion of his valuables after I Presi
dent Johnson's \ death. General Church
had no opportunity nor inclination- then
to explain what he knew of the old relic.
but he has now -had %an opportunity to
personally tell Major Black where his
long-lost dollar is, and he, too, may, like
General Church, come again in due time
into possession of his own. Washington

GARDEN SASS AS MEDICINE.
Vegetables .Which Are Remedies for
Ailments.
Few people know the medicinal value of
vegetables. Yet scientists who have stud
ied this subject have proved that man
might find a remedy in "garden sass" for
nearly every ordinary ill.
Asparagus, for instance, is a diuretic,
and forms part of , the cure for rheumatic
patients at such health resorts as Aix-les-
Bains. . Sorrel is, cooling to the mind as
well as the blood, and forms the staple of
that "'soup aux heroes" which a French
lady will order for herself after a long and
tiring journey. .;*?; v..Vv.' '
Carrots, as they contain a quantity of
sugar, are fattening, and. are avoided by
some people as indigestible. It is the yel
low core of the carrot, however, that is in
digestible, for the outer red layer is tender
enough. In many parts of Europe the
peasants have recourse to ah infusion of
carrots Â» as a specific for jaundice. The
large sweet onion is very rich in those
alkaline elements which counteract the
poison of rheumatic gout. If slowly
stewed in weak broth and eaten
with a little cayenne pepper it
is said to be an admirable . article
of diet for people of studious or sedentary
habits. The stalks of cauliflower have a
similar value, only too often they are so
ill boiled and unpalatable - that they are
not inviting. But when well cooked and
served with the proper dressing there is
nothing more enticing.
Cooks have likewise done much to ren
der turnips unpopular, for many people
believe them only fit for cows and sheep.
Yet when properly cooked and served they
make a most palatable dish and have some
medicinal value as a mild diuretic. Let
tuce has a slight narcotic action, and for
soothing the nerves there is no stock
which grows that equals celery,

JUDGE CARPENTER'S ADDRESS.
The Day Observed With Unusual
Patriotism and Elaborateness in a
Score of Places.
At noon yesterday the thundering sa
lutes fired by all the forts guarding our
land-locked bay were but echoes of that
volley fired from behind the stone breast
works on the summit of Bunker Hill when
the redcoats were advancing on that pleas
ant June morning of 1775. Old Glory
floated from all public buildings in the
City, school children dismissed lessons
from their minds to recite stirring patri
otic poems, and even the straight coin
making stieetcar lines consented to un
bend a little and display a flag or two in
honor of the day.
Out amid the shady nooks of Glen Ellen
the Bunker Hill 'Association and the Sons
of Vermont ate colonial sandwiches and
listened to eloquent orations commemora
tive of the heroes of Bunker Hill. There
were regattas on the bay and patriotic ex
ercises at the park. Over at Shell Mound
the Veteran Firemen celebrated in goodly
number, and down the coast line at Santa
Cruz, at the Venetian Water Carnival,
elaborate recognition was made of Bunker
Hill's one hundred and twenty-first anni
versary.
DAY AT GLEN ELLEN.
i raaitions ct Colonial Times Told
Amid Sylvan Scenes.
Pretty Glen Ellen was exuberant all day
yesterday with Vermouters and the de-
scendants of the veterans who fought in
the battle of Bunker Hill, and the sunny
air around the hills of Glen Ellen was rife
with traditions that* had been handed
down from the brave old revolutionary
war times.
Between 1400 and 1500 people took ad-
vantage of the excursion Into the charm-
ing little retreat in Sonoma County. On
the way to Tiburon Blum's band played
lively patriotic airs, and an atmosphere
â of colonial pride of descent stemed to pre-
vail, and one person would be introduced
to another with. "This is Mr. So-and-so,
whose great-grandfather was Colonel
, that made tl.at brave stand near
Concord."
When the warmth and sunshine of the
picnic grounds were "reached the reminis
cences a:id long lines of ancestry were per-
mitted to roll away and vanish with the
fog. Everybody cave themselves up to the
enjoyment of a regular old fashioned pic-
nic. The climax was reached at noon
when the loach baskets laden with ap
petizing creations of New England cookery
wers opened. .
After lunch an excellent programme was
given in the pavilion.
The following were on the committee of
arrangements:.

A. 11. Wheaton, 11. S. Foote Jr., Hugh Clark,
William F. Muhiner.

well.
Blum's orchestra played a medley of
patriotic airs, after which a prayer was
offered by the chaplain of the day, the
Rev. George E. Walk, director of Trinity
church.
William G. Badger, president of the day,
then made a brief appropriate opening
address, in which he dwelt on the early
days of the Revolutionary War, quoting
the words of Warren, " 'Tis sweet to die
for one's country." He said that in those
times our flag had but thirteen stars, and
yet mighty things were accomplished by
the heroism and determination of the old
colonial fathers. 'Now," he concluded, !
"when the blue field of "Old Glory" glit
ters with stars like the sky of a summer
night, and with all this heroism running
still in our veins, what good may we not
accomplish." :. ;V
A song by the Orpheus Quartet, "The
Star-spangled Banner," followed, sue-
ceeded by "Paul Reveres Ride," read by
Miss C. Downing, and "The Song of
Bunker Hill," magnificently sung by
Alfred Wilkie.
Hon. R. B. Carpenter, vice-president of
the Vermonters' Association, then dcliv-
ered the oration of the day. He said :
Mr. President, Members of the Bunker Hill
Association, Native Sons of Vermont. Ladies
and Gentlemen: The descendants of the heroes
who Jfought the battle of Banker Hill 121
years ago to-day and their countrymen are
present on this occasion to honor the brave
men who feared nothing but dishonor, and
preferred death to slavery.. I shall not at-
tempt to describe that bloody field where
Warren and other heroes offered their lives as
a willing sacrifice upon the altar of liberty.
This was war but not revolution.
The battle of Bunker Hill and that of Lex-
ington and Concord that preceded it, the sub-
sequent battles of Trenton, Brandywlne, Ger-
mantown, Camden and others, culminating In
the decisive and glorious victory of Yorktown,
were but the throes in the travail that pre
ceded the National birth.
Heroic men, noble and patriotic women
achieved for us a conspicuous and honoraDle
position in the family of nations; and dedi
cated this great land, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, to liberty, union, the constitution and
laws made in pursuance thereof.
The deeds of valor on the well-fought and
frequently disastrous battlefields of the seven
yearn' war for independence have been chron
icled in the luminous pages oi Irving, Ban
croft and other historians, and described by
the impassioned eloquence of Webster and
other orators; but what nistorian can delin
eate, or orator portray, the agonies, privations,
sufferingsâ alike by both sexesâ during
that fearful and unequal struggle. The Ruler
of the universe alone knows the grief, suffer
ing, horror and despair of those weary and
portentous years. It is useless for mortals to
attempt to lift the veil. While we venerate
and honor the memories of our ancestors, and
have a just pride in their self-sacrifices and
matchless achievements, let us reverently re
member that "the Most High ruleth in the
kingdom of men, even as in the armies of
heaven," and humbly trust that the power
that brought the nation into being sustained
it in all subsequent civil and military crises, j
through which it has safely passed, will con
tinue to preserve this beloved land of ours
for civil and religious freedom through all I
future generations.-
The Congresses that assembled before and in
the first two years of the war were purely
voluntary bodies without, legal authority or
power to enact laws, hut wholly dependent
upon the adoption by the people of the
colonies acting separately for carrying out
every measure recommended. The articles of
confederation adopted by Congress November
15, 1777, while in form a government and
compact between all the colonies, were in
practice little better. Congress under them
had no power to levy taxes or regulate
loreign or domestic commerce. It could only
make requests, and the colonies complied or
refused as they pleased, and acted slowly,
irresolutely and sometimes factionally. This
weakness ana irresolution caused the army
under Washington at Valley Forge during the
winter ofc 1777 to suffer the pangs of hunger,
intense cold and scant clothing, and marked
the frozen roads with the blood of their shoe- !
less and wounded feet The troops In other |
localities suffered like privations from the â 
same cause. *
With all this suffering, privation and pov- j
erty the troops continued steadfast in the \
struggle for liberty and loyal to their immor- j
tal leader. It is easy to be brave when the j
actor is the "observed of all observers" and In- I
spired by "the pomp and circumstance of !
glorious war"; but the private sold.er, who i
faced danger, hunger, death and wants at the j
same time and not once, but through years of
doubt and disaster, were heroes.
Then to side with truth is noble when we share ,
her wretched crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit and 'tis pros- ',
perous to be just;
Then it is the brave man chooses, while the cow- |
ard turns aside,
Doubting iv his abject spirit till his Lord Is cruci-
V.y v fled, ' â¢ i
And the multitude makes virtue of the faith they
had denied.
Many of the gallant soldiers sleep in name
! less graves, widely scattered, but the whole
I world is their sepulcher, and this Republic,
â  stretching from ocean to ocean, and from the j
j Gulf of Mexico to the great Inland seas, inter- :
j spersed with cloud-capped mountains and ,
; might; rivers, beaming on their broad bosoms j
I the travel and commerce of a continent, with j
I its network of railroads and telegraphs, its j
I vast industrial interests, charitable and edu- :
I cational institutions, its happy hearts and I
j homes, is their never-ending eulogy.
On the 3d day of September, 1783, the final
i treaty of peace was signed at Paris by which !
j the United States were acknowledged to be j
I "free, sovereign and independent states." The
j ocuntry, handicapped with the inherent
I weakness of the "articles of confederation," I
I made comparatively little progress until the '
; meeting of the convention that framed our
j present constitution, which was ratified by j
â¢â  nearly all the States during the year 1788. '
J The members of the convention were wise,
I sagacious and patriotic, and the constitution;
I they prepared and the government they or- j
| ganized was founded upon principles in many ;
j respects differing loom any then known to
| history; has stood for more than a century the i
! test of foreign war, domestic insurrection and j
rebellion, and the sudden and violent parox- \
-, ysms of passion into which the country has
i been plunged more than once; and is to-day i
j in all lands where self-government is recog- i
| nized a guide and a model.
That constitution declared that "no title of
nobility shall be granted by the United
States," that "no relieious test shall ever be
required as a qualification to any office or :
j public trust under the United States," and by 1
Prominent Figures in the Successful Celebration Yesterday of Bunker Hill Day.
an amendment thereto promptly adopted it
was provided that "Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exeicise thereof."
These provisions are sententious and con-
densed statements of the act of Virginia passed
in 1785, introduced by Mr. Jefferson, which
provided that "all men shall be free to profess,
and by argument maintain, their opinion in
matters of religion, and that the same shall in
no wise diminish, enlarge or effect their civil
capacities."
Our ancestors laid broad and deep the foun
dation of nationality. How have we continued
their work? "We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done, and we
have done those things which we ought not to
have done."
After more than 100 years of National life,
while we have exacted from the citizen alle
giance,'we have failed to give its corollary
personal protection, not only in foreign lands
but within our own borders. Our revenue and
financial systems, instead of being settled
upon a business basis, in a non-partisan and
sensible way, have been left for political
parties to play at battledore and shuttlecock,
to the irreparable injury of every industrial,
agricultural and commercial industry. We
â¢have not .now and never had any foreign
policy, but in that regard live from hand to
mouth, one administration the action of its
predecessor, and sometimes its own. We have
acted as though we believed a public debt to
be a public blessing and private debts benefac
tions, r
Some Portuguese workmen belonging to the
organization, not American citizens, became
dissatisfied with their wages, and a strike was
declared against all railroads that used the
cars made by the manufacturer, their former
employer. Instantly travel was suspended and
commerce paralyzed from Chicago to the Pa
cific Ocean. A large amount of property was
wantonly destroyed, men were murdered, the
State governments were powerless to protect
life or property, and, indeed, did not
make the attempt. There was no com
plaint by the employes of the railroads
here or anywhere. It was a sympathetic
strikeâ a strike because a few hundred for
eigners 2500 miles away had or claimed
to have a grievance, not against the railroads
here or elsewhere, but against a company that
manufactured 'â  cars that had been - bought or
leased by the railroads, and were a part of
their rolling stock without which they could
not transact their ordinary business or carry
the mails of the United States. All this was
done by. the authority of one man holding no
office, in the exercise of a power above, beyond
and in contempt of law, order and the rights
of the people.
In this condition the President issued his
proclamation commanding the strikers to
cease obstructing the mails and commerce of
the country, and as Mr. Debs gave no heed to
that, be ordered the federal troops to take the

tions are to violence, lawlessness and crime; to
the unions preventing by violence and force
the lawful pursuits of any man; to the willful
destruction of the property of any person nat
ural or artificial; in short, to violations of
law of any character by individuals or asso
ciations. Congress during its session of six
months was very much agitated over the ag
gressions of Great Britain in Venezuela, and
worked itself into a torrent and tempest of
passion over the woes of Cuba, but failed even
to attempt the slightest relief to the stagnant
industries of its own country. On the con
trary, it seemed oblivious to our financial con
ditions, as the enormous and extravagant ap
propriations made by it abundantly Drove.
We need reform; cease living on borrowed
money; it is neither honest nor profitable. We
must live within our incomes, like our fathers
âpay as we go.
These and the other evils under which we
are suffering are not without remeay. Having
inherited this magnificent National patri
mony, the duty of preserving it for our chil
dren devolves upon this generation. The
crisis demands moral courage and prompt ac
tion for the elimination of the evils I have de
scribed and others well known to you. It is
the duty of every citizen to devote some of his
time, and all of it on election days, to pro
curing a good Government. Recur to the Jef
fersonian qualification, "Is he honest? Is he
capable?"
The Republic is peace. Its destiny is not
war and conquest, but the less showy and more
substantial and happy industrial and com
mercial and scientific arts of peace.
Let our Congress declare war less and re
lieve the people more; let us respect and obay
and demand implicit obedience to the laws,
protect the legal rights of all ; let us not lor a
moment think our ancestors have performed
our duties; let us rather consider that every
age in a Republic has its part to bear, iv the
upward and onward progress of the nation,
and from this moment let our firm resolution
he taken to do our best work for Jhe preserva
tion, glory, prosperity and happiness of our
own beloved republic
New occasions teach new duties;
Time makes ancient good uncouth:
They mount upward still, and onward,
Who would keep abreast of truth;
ho, before us gleam her camprires! we
Ourselves must pilgrims be,
haunch our Mayflower, and steer boldly
Through the desperate winter sea,
Nor attempt the future's portal with
The past blood-rusted key. â¢
At the conclusion of Judge Carpenter's
address Mrs. John Pettee sang "Our Grand
Army of the Dead." Rev. Mr. Walk
briefly spoke on the idea of memorials
showing their necessity and great good to
the human mind and heart. "They are
monuments we build in the memory," he
said, "to mark some step of the world's
progress." "America,-' was then sung by
the audience, led by Professor J. McKen
zie. There was also a recitation by Master
Mat Carpenter Dillingham, and a brief
patriotic address by F. Dillingham, presi
dent of the Vermonters. The programme
closed with a benediction invoked by the
chaplain.
Dancing was enjoyed all the remainder
of the afternoon.
"VETS." AT SHELL- MOUND.
Bunker Hill Day Celebrated by the
San Francisco Firemen.
Those of our people who hold the firemen
in esteem for their past services in time of
need, and at the same time wished to have
what is termed "a good time," hied them
and their lady friends over to Shell Mound
Park early yesterday morning to enjoy a
day with the "vets.," who, as has been their
custom for the past nine years, celebrated
Bunker Hill day as their recurring anni
versary.
' From the number of persons who passed
in through the gate it is quite evident that
the valor and popularity of the San Fran
cisco fireman has not died out, nor has he
become objectionable frcm a social stand
point, for at Shell Mound yesterday there
were some of the best people in the City
present. ,
The pavilion where the dancing was in
dulged in was packed with young and old,
pretty and homely, just as are all parties,
all there to enjoy themselves, which they
did to their hearts' content.
In the recreation grounds the games
were well attended and lively competition
was had for every prize. . . s
The judges and committees, under whose
decisions and management the outdoor
sports were conducted, had their hands
full, but so well was the entire affair man
aged that all were satisfied with the gen
eral results and none! came away with a
grievance. Over $100 in prizes had been
contested for, and" in some cases the con
tests were foyght for with as much vim
as if the prize was worth $500. On the
whole the ninth anniversary picnic of the
Veteran Firemen of San Francisco has
added another wreath*of laurels to its es
cutcheon as being a popular association
composed of brave, honorable American
citizens, and men who know how to enter
tain their friends. .

Yesterday.
THE BIG STRIKE OVER.
All Differences Have Been Am-
icably Settled at Sun-
set Park.
The Builders' Exchangj Picnic Pro-
nounced a Grand Success by All
Who Attended.
The big '^'strike" which was declared on
about two weeks ago and which was ad
vertised to take place yesterday was fully
carried out, and notwithstanding the short
notice and magnitude of the undertaking
it was a decided success â so much so, in
deed, that it paralyzed every branch of the
Builders' Union for one day.
But fortunately for those who bad a
grievance all differences were settled at
Sunset Park, in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
yesterday, when the contending factions
met in the spirit of goodfellowshlp and
over t-.e freedom of a picnic programme
the conquerors and conquered shook hands
and without any admonition from Presi
dent Oscar Lewis never to be again guilty
of striking' under similar circumstances
proceeded to enjoy themselves as orderly
picnickers do when out on a good time with
their families.
The Builders' Exchange picnic was a
decided success from the start to the finish.
The long line of cars, with their puffing
and snorting engines, ran down through
the Santa Clara Valley on good time ana
brought the jovial crowd to the scene of
pleasure, where Cassasa's band was in
readiness to make them still more happy
with lively dance music.
After locating their well-filled lunch
baskets beneath the shady oaks, a rush
was made to the recreation grounds where
the sports were held.
There were sixteen contests for an equal
number of prizes, commencing with boys
and girls under 16 years of age down to
fat men and matrons, who puffed and
forced themselves into running speed to
seel which would win the prize, winding
up with a tug-of-war with eight picked
men from the various branches belonging
to the exchange, all of whom pulled (not
' politically, however, but) on the end of a
taut rope to see who could outpull the
1 other fellows. ,
When the engine bell rang its alarm at
5:30 to get aboard the train for the City
there.was not one man, woman or child in
the crowd dissatisfied and all declared the
big strike of June, '96, was over and not to
be repeated for another year.
The directors expect nothing out of the
day's pleasure in the shape of finance; all
that is hoped is that those who went were
happy and enjoyed themselves.

SAN FRANCISCO'S BUILDINGS.
Kapld â  Strides That Are Being Made
. Here in This Branch of Industry.
The. contractors' and builders' work of
this City is of a superior order. There is
no city on the continent that is making as
rapid strides in the direction of modern
architecture" as is San Francisco. This
fact is emphasized by the expressions of
the numerous tourists who visit the City
during the year. Not only is the novelty
of the architecture of our massive build
ings favorably commented upon, but the
quaintness of the designs seems to catch
their eyes with marked favor. The new
union depot and ferry building when com
pleted, it is said, will be one of the finest
structures of its kind in the world.
The lodge recently finished at the en
trance of Golden Gate Park is also a model
work of architecture. The same may be
said of the new residence of W. F. Whit
tier, now being erected at the corner of
JacKson and Laguna streets. The Spreck
els building and the residence of that gen
tleman are two works of architecture that
will compare favorably with any like
structures in any city of the Union. -The
Mills building would be an ornament to
any. city in 'the new or old world. The
same may be said of the Crocker building
and many more which grace our fair City.
All of which is largely due to the artistic
ideas which emanate from the brains of
our skilled architects. â¢ .."
To the contractors and builders is due
ihe praise R that they merit. These men
have always endeavored to obtain the
most skillful mechanics, paying better
wages to secure them than is paid in any
other city on the continent. The solidity
of our many large buildings may, be attri
buted to the excellency of the work per
formed by the contractors and builders.
In fact the entire building trade in all of
its branches is conducted more carefully
here than elsewhere. San t Francisco can
feel proud of her handsome buildings, for
in y this respect at least she is not a jay
town. ' .
SOME EXCELLENT WORK.
Among the noted builders of San Fran
cisco may be mentioned the name of Grant
Brothers, the railroad contractors, who
are making the roadbed of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley road from
Stockton to Fresno, This work is claimed
by practical engineers to be equal to that
of any first-class road in the western part
of the continent. Their facilities for car
rying out large contracts of this kind can
not be excelled. They constantly employ
an army of hands which are snpervised
by competent and skilled men in every
BALDWIN HOTEL, CORNER MARKET AND EDDY STREETS.
department of the work, although the I
general supervision is attended to Dy the j
members of the firm themselves, besides j
the San Francisco and San Joaquin. Val- ;
ley road.
They are now making a roadbed for the !
various branches of the Southern Pacific j
that are being built through the orange |
belt in the southern part of the State.
They are also engaged in work for the j
Santa Fe Railroad between Los Angeles i
and Pasadena. Many of the great irriga- j
tion ditches in the southern portion of the j
State are monuments to their good work.
It is generally conceded, when this
firm executes a contract, that when it is
completed the harassing details of con
tinuous repairs are unknown" quantities.
The very fact that they have worked con
tinuously and for many years past for the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads,
as welf as other large corporations, gives
ample evidence that they do satisfactory
work. They are known for their reliability
and fairness of dealings. The firm is com
posed of Messrs. A. A. Grant, John R.
Grant and L. A. Grant. .
The latter gentleman has his headquar
ters in the Wilson block, Los Angeles, and
the former two in the Chronicle building
of this City. All of them are widely and
favorably " known and ; have a host of
friends." * Their work speaks for itself and
is unsurpassed by that of any of their
competitors. The reputation that they
enjoy with their fellow-business men
throughout the State, and coast is such as
to make them feel just and proud. .These
men are still young. .They have; risen
from the ranks to a foremost position in
the contracting world. Like all self-made
men, they are easily approached and are.
therefore* liked for their plain, unassum
ing manners.
THE CITY HALL DOME. -
This piece of structural work which
crowns the massive City Hall of this City
was erected largely by the enterprising '
firm of O'Connell & Lewis, who furnished
and erected the structural and architect
ural iron of this, the most attractive por
tion of the building occupied by the City
Fathers. To erect this piece of ; work re
quired \ skill ;of â  more than =' the ordinary
quality, but this firm was equal to the
occasion. ' Tbe firm is composed of M.
O'Connell and Oscar Lewis. .Tne .latter
gentleman is president of the Builders'
â¢Exchange, a director of the Mechanics'
Institute and is prominently, identified
with the work of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association. '. v
, -. S. CLARK * SOUS. :
N. Clark & Sons, 17 and 19 Spear street,
are erecting a large brick plant for manu-
facturing architectural terra-cotta at their
works in Alameda, where they are work
ins a full force , of hands. They have a
reputation for manufacturing unexcelled
vitrified iron stone sewer-pine, chimney
tops and pipes, fire bricks, fire clay drain
and irrigating pipes. The officers of the
company, which was incorporated January
11, 1889, are: N. Clark, president; Albert
V. Clark, vice-president, and G. D. Clark,
secretary. The latter gentleman is a
prominent Native Son, being grand vice-
president of that order.
STEAM PIPE AND BOILER COVERINGS.
The Dessola-Deussing Company, 2 Cali
fornia street, are sole agents for Keesby &
Mattison's magnesia steam pipe and boiler
covering, which is in use in every prom-
inent building in this City. It is indorsed
by the board of underwriters, leading
I architects and consulting and supervising
j engineers everywhere. The Govornment
j board of examination pronounce it supe-
I rior to all coverings. It is absolutely fire-
I proof, a non-conductor of heat and is also
easily applied and removed.
MODEL LUMBER-YARDS. .
The most carefully planned lumber
j yards, in the State are those of the Union
Lumber Company at the corner of Sixth
I and Channel streets. These have a front
j age of 1300 feet and a depth of 240 feet. It
is partitioned by gangways, along which
j is piled the lumber, each pile being care
j fully marked so that no possible error can
jbe made. Telegraph poles and ties are
great specialties of this company. The
! planing-mill has the latest and most ap-
proved machinery, and the molding
sheds are arranged for a complete stock.
. . HALL SAFE AND LOCK WORKS. .
The Hall Safe and Lock Works, 609 and
611 Market street, have supplied the vaults
in all of the leaning banks and buildings
of San Francisco.
A WELL-KNOWN BUILDER.
John McCarthy, one of the best-known
masons and builders in this City and State,
has been following his vocation in San
Francisco for the past twenty years. He
was the builder of the Union Trust Com- !
pany, New York Mutual Life, Mills and
Chronicle buildings, and recently con-
tracted for the mason work on the new
;â  Call building. _ Most of the large build-
ings in San Francisco bear some evidence
of his superior skill. His residence is at
1212 Treat : avenue and his office is at the
Builders' Exchange.
BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURAL; DESIGNS.
. The J. L. Mott Iron Works of New York
claim to be the : leading firm in their line
in the world. M. 8. James, their repre
sentative on the Pacific Coast, -has

ness man and salesman. The goods man-
ufactured by this firm are unexcelled by
", any other manufacturer >in the world.
When the beauty of design, excellence of
workmanship and finish are considered,
they are no dearer than those of their in-
ferior competitors. .
Their catalogues demonstrate that no
greater variety of ornamental lawn aud
XmmrmiiÃasasiiSassSit&toLsSsiiStt
drinking fountains, vases in iron and
bronze, railings and gates for altars,
chancels, cemeteries and lawns, and or
namental work in iron or bronze of every
description are to be found anywhere. The
same may be said of their lamp pillars,
lamp brackets,. lamps and candelabra.
Their specialties in plumbing material,
consisting of lavatories, bathtubs, water-
closets, sinks and laundry tubs, needle and
shower baths with all" the adjuncts of
faucets and fixtures are without a peer.
Their stable fixtures are uncqualed. This
firm asks of the public a far opportunity to
market their goods on their merits and
offer the freedom of inspection to all, par
ticularly,to those contemplating building.
They are within the reach of every one,
ranging as they do from the lowest to the
highest prices. A visit to their rooms will
fully demonstrate these tacts.

to Trade.
The Traffic Association of California,
having won a victory in the fierce contest
for Utah business, is now preparing for
the added satisfaction of seeing San Fran
cisco merchants enjoy the benefits thus
brought to them. Under the management
of William B. Curtis, the new traffic
manager, the association has- without
much ado accomplished in this single in
stance more than enough to repay its sup
porters tenfold. For a new and, it is said,
a really remunerative - field has been
brought within the possible scope of San
Francisco's commerce. *.â¢>
The southeast portion of Utah, which
was hardly accessible before because of
discrimination in favor of Eastern mer
chants, is regarded not only by shippers,
but by the railways 33 well, as an im
portant region. Its many mining districts
require immense quantities of merchan
dise, machinery, etc.
Heretofore it was supplied from Chicago
and cities on tbe Missouri, although San
Francisco, by reason of its closer prox
imity, was entitled to the business. Act
ing on this foundation, Manager Curtis
instituted an elaborate system of attack,
and through the powerful influence of the
Traffic Association brought about a con
ference between the Southern Pacific and
tne railways east of Utah.
The result has been made known in gen
eral terms, and now the Southern Pacific
has come out with a new freight tariff be
tween stations on its lines in California to
stations on the Rio Grande Western in
Utah and Colorado.
Thistle Junction, several miles eastward
of Bait Lake City, is made a. "common
point" in Utah, "as it is a distributing
point for the mining districts. Under this
arrangement freight rates from California
are made by the Southern Pacific Com
pany with the same right as if the Central
Paciric road extended so far beyond Ogden.
This new tariff is to become effective Sat
urday next. It is compiled to cover all
sorts of "commodities"' carried by rail
ways, and presents the following "class
rates" in cents per 100 pounds :
The Traffic Association has prepared a
comparative tariff, which will be found
interesting, as it shows the new ratio in
freight rates between the formerly dis
puted points. Until the recent victory
was gained, San' Francisco paid much
mere than either Chicago or Kansas City.
Here is how matters now stand, as ex
pressed in cents per 100 pounds:
The term Utah common points embraces
the following, located on the Union Pacific
system on the Rio Grande Western Rail
way :
American Fork. Atkinson. Battle Creek,
Bingham Junction, Brick Spur, Centerville,
Coalville, Croyden, Devil's Gate, Draper, Echo,
Farmington, Germania, Grass Creek Junction,
Hooper, Jordan Narrows, Kays Creek, Kays
ville, Lake Shore, Lay ton, Lehi, Lehi Junction,
Lovendahis, Morgan. Murray, Ogden, Park
City, Peterson, Pleasant Grove, Provo, River
ton, Roy, Salt Lake City. Sandy, Spanish Fork,
in grille, Stand Pipe, Strawberry, Summit,
Syracuse, . Uintah, Wan ship, ' Wanship Tank,
Wood's Cross and stations between such points.
It will be seen from this list that a very
important field for the enterprise of San
Francisco merchants has been opened.
The new ratio in rates for Utah freight
business stands in favor of San Francisco
at 75 per cent of Missouri River rates
and about 60 per cent of Chicago figuresâ
a clear gain for â  California through the
Traffic Association.' ' 'â¢ C";-y-'AyV
THE OLYMPIC BATHS.
Three Thousand Dollars Will Be Ex-
ponded in Improvements.
The Olympic Club must economize, so
say the directors. Some months y ago,
when interest in the affairs of the club
was flagging, the directors , decided, after
long deliberation, that something must be
done to keep down the expenses, which
were considerable in an institution of this
kind.
! The first thing done in the way of re-
trenchment was to reduce the salaries of
the instructors. Rather than permit any
of the teachers to leave, the club thought
it oest to cut off a slice from tbe monthly
wages of each employe. Walter .Watson,
! the boxing instructor, had his salary re
; duced from $1Â«) to $125 a month ; Profess-
I ors Beaulo, Melhling, Trouchet and Clarke
I came in for a share of the ax.
Everything went along swimmingly for
1 a while, and the directors were congratu-
I lating themselves on the favorable pros
! pects and the financial success they had
achieved from a boxing entertainment the
j club gave in Mechanics' Pavilion which
I netted a very nice sum.
Recently something occurred which
; affected the club, and as a consequence,
i the secretary received several resignations.
j Many of those, who in a moment of im
] pulse, signified their intentions of resign
ing, changed their minds when they had
; an opportunity to consult with the direc
-1 tors and leading members of the club, and
! are now stanch supporters of the Olympic.'
Harry Clarke, the swimming instructor
i who was discharged a few weeks ago, pre
i sented a petition for reinstatement to the
i directors at last night's meeting. The pc-
I tition was signed by a majority oi the
members of the Olympic Club, who are
I strongly in favor of having Clarke restored
i to his old position, which is that of swim
i ming teacher.
Clarke's services will not be required in
j July and August, as the present bathing .
' compartments are to be torn down and
i substantial bathrooms will be erected and
i of material which will stand tbe ravages
I of the salt water and its parasites.
Workmen will commence removing the
i decayed woodwork of the bathrooms on
j July 1.
REPUBLICAN RED FIRE.
St. Louis Nominations to Be
Ratified in Great
Form.
Procession and Music on the Streets.
Speeches at the Pa-
vilion.
Red fire, music, a general parade of
clubs and speeches at the Pavilion will be
features of the great Republican ratifica
tion meeting in San Francisco next Satur
day evening. Since it is regarded as a sure
thing that McKinley is to be the nominee
for President, it only remains for the Vice-
President to be named in order that the
banners and transparencies may be
painted.
The Republican County Committee has
selected United States Senator George C.
Perkins to preside at the ratification meet
ing. The Senator said yesterday that he
had notified the committee of his ac
ceptance. Among the speakers already
named are: W. S. Barnes, Colonel T. V.
Eddy, J. L. Boone, Major C. W. Kyle.
Frank Powers, Julius Kabn, A. W. Branch
and Colonel John H. Roberts. Others
will be added to the list in due time,
The Republican organizations that are
expected to join the marching procession
are the Union League Club. Continental
League, Phoenix Club, Bear Club, Howard
Club, Eagle Club, Thirty-fourth District
Club, Italio-American Republican Club,
Thirtieth District Club, Young Men's Re
publican League and North Beach Repub
lican Club.
The clubs will take position on Mission
and Howard streets, near New Mongom
ery. The column will enter Market street
at the Palace Hotel and march directly to
the Pavilion.
The Enterprise Republican Club of the
City will furnish their own special fea
tures and fireworks. Many bands of music
have been engaged for the ratification.
The demonstration promises to be one of
the largest and most enthusiastic ever held
in this City. No doubt some of the build
ings along the line of march will be illu
minated.
PROVED AN ALIBI.
Charge of Bobbery. Against Richard
Murphy and Thomas Barnes
Dismissed.
Dismissed.
Richard Murphy, letter-carrier, and
Thomas Barnes, blacksmith, were arrested
last Sunday morning on the charge oi
robbery. The complaining witness against
them was Fred Marlow of Fruitvale, who
charged them with robbing him of $46, at
Leavenworth and Broadway, about 5
o'clock Sunday morning.
The case was called in Judge Low's
court Monday morning, but Marlow failed
to appear. The Judge continued the case
till yesterday and issued a bench warrant
for Marlow's arrest. Marlow could not be
found, and yesterday the Judge decided
to go on with the case without him. Both
defendants were able to establish a com
plete alibi, and the Judge dismissed the
case. â
The police want to find Marlow. If he
was robbed of $46 by two men they want
him to explain how he became possessed

SIEBE IS FREE

Judge Wallace Decides in
Favor of the As-
â¢ sessor.
THE CASE IS DISMISSED.

Dropped.
The Siebe perjury case was yesterday
dismissed by Judge Wallace.
Last week District Attorney Barnes sur-
prised every one connected with the mat
ter by moving that the case be dismissed.
He urged that the Assessor was a quasi-
judicial official, and as such could not be
prosecuted except it be shown that he had
been guilty of bribe-taking. As this was
not the idea of the prosecution mistakes in
assessing property could only be held to
be errors of judgment.
be errors of judgment. .'*?'.y,\
Judge Wallace took the matter under
advisement and. yesterday decided that i
Mr. Barnes was* right in the "matter.
Following is his decision in part:
The accusation against Diebe upon a prelim-
mary examination pending here is that of
perjury; the District Attorney 61 the City and
County 01" San Francisco moved that the case.'
be now dismissed, because, as be thinks, Siebe
could not upon trial had before a jury be con-
victed of any criminal offense, and in his judg
ment he ought not to be prosecuted for the
offense of perjury charged in this case. This
announced position of the District Attorney
should put an end to this proceeding ; it would
be idle for me to hold Siebe to answer
to this charge of perjury, when it is apparent
that if he were so held," the District Attorney,
entertaining the views he does, would, in the
exercise of his discretion, refuse to prosecute
him. While it is clear that the District Attor
ney cannot assume to formally dismiss the pro- i
ceedings here before me against Siebe, it is
equally clear that he considers it his duty to |
refuse to file an Information against' him. fori
the offense of perjury should I hold him to an- |
swer; nor is there power anywheie to be found .
which can overrule the judgment of the Dis- \
trict Attorney in that respect, or compel him i
to file an information and prosecute it against !
Siebe; to hold Siebe to answer would, there- |
fore, be but to do an idle thing.
The accusation, generally stated, is that i
Siebe was guilty of perjury when, in 1896, he !
made oath that he had assessed the property
of the Market-street Railway Company at its !
full cash value, according to tne best oi his |
judgment, information and belief. He swore I
that, he had done what every Judge swears he !
will decide according to his best judg- !
ment. the affidavit upon wnich the war- j
rant of arrest was issued it is charged that, j
though the property of that company was I
worth upward of $17,500,000, Siebe had as- <
sessed it at less than $4,000,000, and, more-
over, that he hail made this under-assessment j
"knowingly, willfully and corruptly."
[ The substance of 'this when analyzed Is that I
i Siebe. as Assessor, had decided that property I
worth $17,500,000 was worth no more than
i $4,000,000, and, moreover, that, he gave this
decision "Knowingly"â that is, that he knew
what he was about when he gave it; "will-
fully"â that is, that he did it on purpose; I
"corruptly"â that is, that he bad a design to , i
thereby acquire some advantage, either for ,
himself or some one else (Penal Code, section i
7, passim). But what particular advantage ]
was to be thus securedâ whether it was an ad- ]
vantage for himself or for another, whether it ,
was pecuniary, political or social in char- ;
acterâis not stated or attempted to be stated
in the accusation, as it should have been if the i
purpose of the affiant was to thereby add \
another and specific charge to the charge of j
under-valuation otherwise already set forth.
It was no doubt supposed that the mere fact |
(distinctly set forth in the affidavit) that prop- j
perty worth $17,500,000 had been set down
on the assessment roll as worth less than
$4,000,000. necessarily imported corruption !
on the part of Siebe. How could an under-
valuation so marked as that be honestly ;
made? How could the apparent omission of |
some $13,000,000 out of $17,000,000 from j
the tax roll be reasonably accounted
for as having been the result of- a mere !
oversight, or a mistake honestly made? These
considerations plainly embody the idea upon ;
which the accusation was really founded; j
they constitute the striking feature of wrong-!
doing apnearing upon the face of the affidavit, i
one which, I confess, profoundly impressed i
me at the time when I issued the warrant of
arrest And here it ought to he understood
by every one who looks into this opinion for
honest purposes that no accusation of
j bribery has been made, or is under in-
vestigation hereâ no affidavit charging Siebe
I with that offense has â¢ been presented
â â  as yet. It is true that Mr. Clunie,
j who has conducted this case with zeal and
ability, has repeatedly asserted in speech here ]
that he was confident that if he could get hold
I of certain books in possession of this company I
he could prove that Siebe had been bribed to 1
make the alleged under-valuation; he has ac- I
cordingly attempted to compel the production
of these hooks before the court, and I have
supported his attempt with whatever power I
had. We have so far failed to obtain an in-
spection of these books. In the attempt to en-
force their production I have considered it a
circumstance not a little embarrassing that,
while the ', avowed purpose in hand was to
thereby prove the offense of bribery, there was
in fact no distinct accusation of bribery
pending here; notwithstanding that circum-
stance, however. 1 have pressed the effort to
enforce the production of these books to the
extreme limit of my authorityâ have, in iact;
overstepped the line which ordinarily protects
private affairs from exposure- I have done
this because, in my judgment, these books may
I be fairly characterized as not absolutely pri
: vate but iks quasi public. They are not the
| books of a corporation which is strictly a pri
| vate corporation, but of a corporation which
.is quasi public â certainly has a public
J side to it a corporation in wnich the public
j has a recognized interestâ a corporation which
exercises a franchise over the public streets of
! the City; and though I know of no adjudi
cated case which has announced such a dis-
I tinction my own view was and is that in such
a condition there should be a relaxation of the
â  recognized rules applicable to the production
i of strictly private papers. I remark, again,
j however, that no distinct accusation that Siebe
! had been bribed in this business has been as
i yet made or is pending for consideration here,
j and it is but fair to him to add that 1 have
~ heard no testimony which would justify me in
l holding that he had.
Irrespective of > precedent and authority,
I presently to be adverted to, his power is "the
power to hear and determine," and therefore
J it is in its nature and essence judicial power.
I Should he take a bribe to influence his de-
cision he would thereby commit a crime for
! which he might be prosecuted as a felon, and
j so may a Judge who agrees for a bribe; in that
. particular condition a personal responsibility
j would attach to the Assessor and to the Judge
ânot, however, for the decision given but for
agreeing for a bribe. Aside â  from this a
decision upon a question of value pronounced
by an Assessor is not distinguishable from
such a decision pronounced by a Judge, for
such a decision rendered by either is but the
authoritative exercise of judicial power for
an erroneous exercise of which in a particular
case neither the Assessor nor the Judge would
incur personal responsibility. The civil re-
sponsibility of an Assessor because of a sup-
posed wrong decision he has made in fixing
j values has sometimes been asserted in suits
! brought against him by private persons sup-
posing themselves to have been injured there-
by, but so far as I have observed the plaintiff'
has uniformly failed on the ground that in
making the assessment complained of the As-
sessor was in the exercise of judicial power.
and therefore not personally responsible;
surely the same principle must avail to protect
him from a criminal prosecution.
I have not yet seen a reported case in which
a criminal prosecution in any form has ever
before been set on foot against an Assessor be-
cause 'of a decision :. made by him in fixing
values tor - purposes : of - taxation; 'â  so -; far : as
judicial proceedings- appear to have gone
it would seem that such a decision was
never before characterized as a crime by
any , court of - justice. "What never was
never ought to be," . should be â :. applicable
to this case if to any; If practicable it
would have been attempted before now; for it
is notorious that no single subject has provoked
such long continued and bitter controversy
among our people as the subject of . unequal
taxation; the supposed misconduct of assess-
ors, the alleged unequal taxation they have
fixed, how in the past they have in their decis
ions habitually favored corporations and the
rich and have discriminated against the poor
have constituted an enduring theme of discus-
lion by the press, in the forum and upon the
stump; yet it would appear that until now it
has never been thought to attempt the pre
vention of these asserted evils by a criminal
prosecution of an Assessor for felony com
mitted by him in rendering his decision upon
the subject of values. ' â  .â "â¢'
The proceeding against Siebe having been
dismissed, all mere collateral questions go
with It.
There are certain proceedings pending for
â¢ contempt whicn must be discontinued also.
These arose only upon a question made in
good faith and under the advice of learned
counsel as to the lawful authority of the court
to enforce the production of the books of the
company. The parties and their counsel re
spectfully questioned the power of the court
here to make an order that the books be pro
duced. They had the right to make the ques
tion in that wayâ in fact, there was no other
way practically open to them.
The statute of contempts substantially pro-
vides that one may decline to obey an order
which a court has no power to make. A com
mitment for contempt and an application to
the Supreme Court for a .writ of habeas corpus
is the only available means to obtain an ulti-
mate determination of the question they made
and had a right to make. They have made it
accordingly, but the principal case in which it
arose having been dismissed, the determina
tion by the Supreme Court has become unnec
essary. â¢ ;:;;.::. â¢; :â  ,':' \f\'f'>!: ';â ,". "â â ',

price of real estate has kept up to the
standard, and in many instances it has in

Shade trees of all kinds have been set

The people turned out to the mass-meet

in the dove-cooing stage of their marital
f elicity/ â -'â  > "'â â ?
When Colonel Marceau married he was 1
in possession of a snug fortune. Shortly
afterward several mortgages held by cer- ,
tain persons on some' of Mrs. Marceau's
propertyjn Fresno matured and he natur
ally offered to take them up himself. In
this manner he became his wife's creditor. I
Appreciative of his generosity, Mrs.
Marceau insisted that her own large in
come should be devoted to the expenses of
the family, which included foreign travel l
on a large scale.
Had not Marceau and his wife kept a j
joint financial account the complications
which have so long delayed the settlement
of the suit would have been avoided and
their affairs settled long ago.
Arrangements as to the future custody |
of the child were completed last week, j
when with the consent of both parents
Baby Marceau was transferred to the care j
of Mrs. Herbert Hall, who has been ap
pointed by Judge Slack as the little one's j
permanent custodian. Both Marceau and
wife are to have equal rights as to visiting
it and having it brought to their respective
homes.
No mention of a divorce between the
parties to the suit is made, but as they
both have expressed a determination for
ever to live apart, the general impression j
is that in due time a suit of an amicable j
nature will be brought.
Meanwhile the colonel, it is understood,
will continue to conduct the photograph !
business and his wife has taken a long I
lease of the house on Ashbury Heights, ]
where she now resides with her young son, ]
Allen Fiske, and her father and mother,
Mr. and Mrs. Fisher.
It is said that she intends to leave for
the Fast shortly to spend tie summer at
the home of her parents, but she has made
no definite statement as to her intentions.

A PAINTERS' BOYCOTT.
Union Journeymen in Trouble With
J. Quadt â Four Members
Were Expelled.'
The meeting of the Painters' Union last
The meeting of the Painters' Union last
evening was decidedly interesting, and re-
sulted in tbe declaring of a boycott on one
paints-hop and the expulsion of four men
from the union. Both actions have been
on the tapis for several days. A week ago
it was reported that a number of boss
painters were about to reduce the wages
of their workmen from $3 to $2 per day.
A committee went to all the shops to learn
the facts, and last evening the members
i reported that the majority of the bosses
are paying union rates and are friendly to
the union.
There was one exception, John Quadt,
whose place of business is in the St
Nicholas block. It was reported that he
'â  not only refused to recognize the union.
but was cutting wages. ft took the paint-
ers but a short time to declare a boycott
j upon Quadt's shop. This means tbat no
union man can handle any paints or other
materials from that shop. Furthermore,
the Paper-hangers'* Union, which is a
branch of the painters' organization, will
refuse to handle any paper from that shop.
The secretary was instructed to write to
Campbell & Co. of - New .York,. who are
j supposed to be backing Quadt,' and inform
j them of the boycott on their goods and
: materials on account of Quadt's j attitude
:to organized labor. It is hoped that the
' New YÂ«ork firm will take i a hand in the
; fight in the interests of their goods.
To-day the men in Quadt's shop will be
i ordered to walk out. Those who belong
to the union remsing to answer the sum
| mons will be severely dealt with.
The union then took up the cases of
! four members found guilty of violating
' union rules by working for less than the
standard rate of wages. These are W.
: Cowan of Berkeley. Emil Hoffman of 1521
! Webster street. R. McNess of 206 Franklin
; street and William H. Wilson of 234K
| Thirteenth ' street. - They were expelled
from the union. " " r^S_ss9_S_BjjÃ

HIS CONDUCT TO

Serious Charges Made

M. M. Foote, the attorney, Is about to be
subjected to the cathode ray of judicial in
vestigation by his fellow-members of the
Bar ' Association. :
Let it not be understood that it is W. W.
Foote, the eminent attorney and Demo
cratic politician, who is to go through this
ordeal, but his brother, "Inverted"
Foote, as he is better known, his initials
being M. M. instead of W. W.
Well, ''Inverted" Foote has brought
heaps of trouble upon himself through a
client, one Morris Lubeck, who loans
money on collateral security for every
dollar he loans out, and makes a charge
for interest based principally on what the
victim will stand.
Lubeck loaned out nearly $1000 on the
unsecured notes of a man he believed to
be as good as gold. This paper matured
and it was protested. Then Lubeck en
gaged Attorney Rosenthal to enforce col
lection. The latter, however, was not
prompt enough to please Mr. Lubeck,
who listened to the persuasive arguments
of Attorney Foote, who advised him to
take his affairs' out of Rosenthal's hands
and put them into his. Lubeck did this
after gazing upon the walls of Mr. Foote's
office, decorated with advertising posters
saying:
â¢ . ADVICE FREE. :
Opes All Nioht.
Between these two lines in each case, a
Between these two lines in each. case, a
cheap stamp of the attorney's face was
displayed.
From time to time, however, after get
ting Lubeck's business, Attorney Foote
made demands upon him for expense
money, court and shorthand reporters'
fees and a thousand and one other petty
affairs that must be paid if one cares to in
dulge in litigation. In all, Lubeck paid
Foote some $55 and awaited results.
y The cases progressed to the extent of two
suits being brought in the Justices' Court
and one in the Superior Court, where they
are still pending for the matter of that,
no decision having ever been given. To
bring these suits, Attorney Foote paid as
much as $13 out of the $65 he received.
But Lubeck did not care so much for
that. What angered him and caused his
i withdrawal of clientage from Attorney
j Foote was the fact that while the latter was
I thinking matters over the sued party had
i eight months . to sell out all his property
| and make an exit for parts unknown, pre-
I sumably Germany.
The result is that the $1000 worth of
notes held by Lubeck are not worth the
| paper they are written on. .
In this dilemma Lubeck sought the ad
! vice of . Attorney James K. Ross, who, at
the instigation of his new client, has
formulated charges against Foote, setting
forth certain acts contrary to the ethics of
the profession as accepted by the Bar As
' sociation.
While said charges were being compiled
Attorney M. M. Foote brought suit in the
Justices' Court against Lubeck to recover
$187 attorney's fees for advice. Three
days ago Justice Groezinger decided in
favor of the defendant, Attorney Ross
showing as his chief evidence Mr. Foote's
advertisement dodgers offerihg "advice
i free."
Some of the other evidence developed a j
j phase of character not unusual with men !
lin Mr. Lubeck's business. It appears that ;
! he was very anxious to know how his ]
! cases were progressing, and he called at j
i least once or twice each day on his attor- |
j ney, to ascertain. In his bill of charges
j going to make up the $187 claimed by
j Foote the latter charged his client with
$5 for each visit.
The more . serious charge, however, in
! the complaint filed with tbe Bar Associa
i tion by Attorney J. K. Ross and Mr. Lu
beck, is that either Mr. Foote or his clerk
! yielded to a monetary consideration at the
| hands of the debtor, who was. allowed to
' escape. Testimony to that effect was pro
; duced in the Justices' Court when Lubeck
won the case. .
"Ido not know anything about a dis- J
barment proceeding," said Mr. Foote last j
, night, "I suppose I have many enemies '
! who are capable of attempting such a j
thing, but for the life of me 1 do not know
who it can be unless that client of mine,
; Lubeck, has got his back up.
"I brought five or six sni ti for him, and
had a fee of $187 to collect. I had much
difficulty in getting a financial recognition,
and finally brought suit.
"He has laid himself liable on . several
occasions to prosecution for libel if I had
seen fit to press the matter. He is a close
; fisted dog, anyway, and what he may say j
; or do will have no effect." y:

should herald the coming of their Queen. \
Up and down they paced, ready to catch >
the first sight of the white battalion, I
whose entrance into the city was to be j
tne first act in the ceremony of the day.
All too long the hours seemed. The
restless moving mass divided and then j
came together again. Hundreds wandered !
to the river as though anticipating, some
spectacle there in advance of the hour an
nounced. Others crowded the beach and
lolled on the white sand- bent on catching
the first glimpse of the white battalion
and spending the intervening time watch
ing the gentle rolling of the two ships in
the surf or were swung with the current that
added to the life on deck, where the blue- j
jackets were preparing for their landing
and capturing of the hearts of the people of
Santa Cruz. In fact the people were wild
with the delight of anticipation. They did
not forget their Queen. They did not for- i
get that there were to be many grand !
features of the carnival, but they were j
alive to the fact that it is not often that a j
city is fortunate enough in holiday time to j
be honored with t;,.e presence of the White j
Squadron of the Pacific. . ii.
And so this was the subject : uppermost
in the minds of the people â this was the
great event of the opening dayâ the great
est honor that Queen Josephine could ask.
It was indeed a great honor that she, a ;
mimic queen, ruler of a people- whose >
pleasure alone she sought, a queen in
romance only, should be heralded to "the
resple by the dignified presence of the
commander of the Pacific white squadron
and his sailor-soldiers.
And when the hour came for the forma
tion of the. parade the excited interest !
grew intense, and a great crowd of people j
Scene in the harbor yesterday when Admiral Beardslee and his staff came, ashore, accompanied by the detachment . of blue
jackets who later in the day took part in the parade. Ihe admiral's launch is in advance flying the American ensign from the stern and

harbor, where they will remain during the continuance of the festivities. i
moved op Pacific avenue and to Beach
Hill, from whose flat crown they could see
the movement of the parade and hear the
cheery music of the bands. Other crowds
lined the sidewalks and filled the windows
of the stores and offices and dwellings.
Arriving at the wharf the battalion of
the flagship lined up and was ready to
move promptly at the hour of 2 o'clock.
Grand Marshal Rice rode down the wharf
to meet them; the Santa Cruz Naval Bat
talion marched down the wharf, dressed
in their blue uniforms, ready to fail in the
rear of the white battalion.
The order of march from Lieutenant-
Commander lngersoll was taken up by
the lieutenant along the line and with
uniformity and precision of movement the
white uniformed blue jackets stepped
forward as one man, bearing arms at
shoulder marching in platoon.
The mass of piles and timber that
has borne many a railroad train along
its length from the main track to the
steamer landings swayed from side to
side, moving with the "left, left, left" of
the sailor-soidiers' step, till it seemed as
though the structure would go down with
its burden of dignity and human clock
work. Under the command of Lieutenant
Moorey, the Santa Cruz fourth gun divi
sion swung into line, following the move
ments of tbe white battalion, and the
great parade Pad begun.
Reaching the foot of Pacific avenue the
battalion formed in fours and- thence to
the lower plaza at the further extremity
of the avenue. Keeping time in their
precision of step with the music
of the battalion . band and Roncovieri's
band that played alternately and kept a
continuous run of music from the be
ginning to the end of the parade, with an
occasional intermission when the steady
footfail of the soldiers in white - and the
soldiers in blue sounded above the time
beating of the snare-drums. .
Admiral Beardslee and his staff, with
Mayor Clark, occupied a carriage, which
waited in the rear with another bearing
Captain Cotton of the Philadelphia, Cap
tain Sumner of the Monadnock and first
officers. *
As the battalion approached marching
in harmony with music the order of j port
arms sounded down the line and this
silent salute to the admiral, his staff and

sponded :to by Admiral Beardslee â¢ with

riages brought up the rear.
Reaching the plaza,. the battalion coun
termarched \ and y formed again into pla
toons, then into company front, and tnen
a halt was called, and immediately the
battalion filed into extended order for
pnysical drill with arms. ',_â .
That was a grand pictureâ a picture
that can be seen only when the white bat
talion of the Philadelphia and Monadnock
present it. It was a picture so simple,
so eracefal, so beautiful, that it charmed

Even one who had never seen a blue
jacket nor a soldier on parade | could not
have failed to appreciate this simple drill
that puts the soldier on his mettle in the
matter of physical culture. He must be a
careful student, an artistic actor, a con
scientious, painstaking sailor and soldier.
- This physical includes four exercises and
the blue jackets go through with it hand
ling their guns as easily as if it were a part
of their training from childhood. â¢ The en
tire battalion moves as thongh it were one
man. There was not an instant of time
in the motion of one man in \ advance or
behind that of another.
The first exercise was that of extending
guns held firmly yet lightly over the head,
back of the neck, forward again, down to
the ground. The second . exercise was the
swinging of the extended guns from right
to left, that was a pretty motion.
The third exercise was the right-to-left
motion with guns extended. The fourth
consisted ot four motions to left, four to
the front, four to the right, with arms ex
tended. This was done to the tune of

as played by the battalion band was in
perfect harmony with the movements of
the soldiers. i~~X::i-;S
When these exercises had been con
cluded the battalion formed company

where they occupied a section of seats and
witnessed the entry of the Queen and her
maids of honor, whom they saluted with

Queen Josephine won the hearts of the
people by her quiet dignity, graceful car- â 
riage and modest acknowledgment of her
queenly powers uttered in the shouts of
welcome as the barge moved steadily
under the stroke of the galley slaves

There was a doffing of hats and smiles of
approval of the royal household. Al
though this was a mimic queen, although
this was a romantic picture for the pleas
ure of the people^' there was , an earnest
ness in their greeting that meant a real
welcome to Miss Josephine Turcot, who
made a thousand j friends to-day that she
had not known before. ;C> * *
: When the long train of barges had
passed the arena forming a semi-circle and
the Queen's barge had reached the palace ;
where she , was to' be crowned Queen of !
beautiful Santa Cruz, the attendant barges
swung out on the broad bosom of the San
Lorenzo and awaited the coronation. '
With due solemnity and dignity the
Doge of Venice placed upon the fair head
of Queen Josephine a' rich jeweled crown
and announced his proclamation of coro
nation, Mayor Clark followed with the
key of the city, ,that the Queen might
unlock the gates not only to the city phy
sical, but to the hearts of the people.
This, he said, he presented to ncr aria her
royal following, full right to go and come
as will arid enjoy full freedom, without let
or hindrance.
Queen : Josephine acknowledged grace
fully the honor and pleasure it afforded
her* through a brief but eloquent speech
through her Prime Minister, Ben F.
Knight, who read , in clear, loud tones that
came across the water distinctly as follows:
To our loyal subjects, greeting. Upon our
brow has been placed a regal diadem, symbolic
of sovereign power, by virtue of which we now
assume dominion in this our beloved city of
Santa Cruz. No line of kindly ancestry has
marked our path to a chair of state, dark with
the stains 'of the cruel past, f but we have
been ' called by your ; love to a throne of

boundless joy and happiness. : With unfeigned
pleasure we accept the crown thus graciously
bestowed, and we hope' that our reign, brief
though It may be, will ever be remembered as
that of a Queen who rules . only in the hearts
of her poople.
Now let this royal edict go forth unto all our
subjects that joy, mirth,; merriment and rev
elry abide throughout our coming till the
Goddess of Light shall announce the arrival of
the Sabbath' morn. Let care and trouble hide
their heads from 'â  our sight, and let I naught
occur to mar the | festivity of our joyous reign.

The ; Queen and - her * court of ? royal fol
lowers returned to their â  barges, moved
slowly across the river, approaching the
great audience that had expressed so much
pleasure . at the ; coming of the royal
personage, . and when her barge ar
rived at the landing the people saw that
she carried a distinguished visitor who
had been invited by her Majesty to speak
to the people upon a historical event
which was celebrated to-night by the
mimic battle of Bunker Hill. This dis
tinguished visitor was Irving M. Scott of
San Francisco. Mr. Scott said:
Ladies and Gentlemen: In our imagination
we behold the representation of Bunker Hill
Monument It reflects honor. upon all con
cerned in its design ana construction for this
occasion. , . The spectacle seems to eliminate
distance and enable us to view the veritable
monument standing on Bunker Hill as the glo
rious beacon of American libertyâ a liberty un
like that of- the Democracy of ancient Greece,
or that of the red republicanism of France, or
that of hydra-headed modern anarchism. : In
deed, American liberty is of a kind peculiar to
itselfâ a liberty restricted in practice as well
as in theory by the maxim, "To so use your
own as not to injure another."
The initial battles of the Revolutionary War
were fought April 19, 1775 ; â¢ one at Lexington
and the other at Concord. As to Lexington
and the Americans < that fell in combat there,
Kossuth said in 1852:
Lexington is the birthplace of American lib
erty. It Is the sacrificed . blood of the fallen
heroes with which is written the preface of your
Nation's history. Their death was and ever will
be the first -bloody revelation of America's des
tiny, and I>exlngton .the opening scene of a revo
lution that is destined to change the character of
human governments and tbe condition of the hu
man race. . â¢" â  'â 'â ''.'' yV.
The battles of Lexington and Concord,
though of themselves i inconsiderable in mag
nitude, were most potent in inspiring the peo
ple to take Up the sword against British tyr
anny. Bloodâ American martyr bloodâ
been wantonly spilled. Boston and its envir
ons calling for succor; the cry, "To arms! to
arms I. rang in clarion tones through the
country. v .'Â£^jsHÂ§BB3SB|
â  The response was prompt Putnam, leaving
his plow midway in the field, seizing his arms
and spurring his horse to full speed on the
road to Boston, is an incident Illustrative of
the promptness of that response In general.
The American army, consisting of 20,000 vol
unteers, its line extending from Roxbury to
Cambridge, was under commanu of General
Artemus Ward. General Gage, reinforced by
the army divisions ; of Generals Howe, Bur-
goyne and Clinton, was in command of the
British. The enemy had a powerful battery on
Copp's Hill and a strong naval force In Boston
harbor. ;'â¢. ;:â¢';â ''
The American officers, having learned June
16, 1775, that General Gage would begin forti
fying Bunker Hill the 18th, sent the night of
the 16th Colonel Prescott with- 1000 men to
forestall the British . general's plans. Colonel '
Prescott. and his command during the night
lost no time in converting fences, stone walls,
new-mown nay and- thrown-up earth
into American breastworks. Gag per-
ceiving â ' these at daylight -in the morn-
ing of , the . 17th, ordered the Copp's
Hill battery and the navy ;to "attack
them, and called 'the troops to arms. Still,
amid that storm of iron balls and bursting
shells, Prescott and his sterling band did not
falter, but pressed on in i their fortifying work
with increased vigor. uÂ£fgÃsÂ£jÂ£^KS3^Q&sÂ£Â£Â£sgg3
.;; Generals Howe and Pigot with 4000 troops,
covered by the guns of the men-of-war, effected
a landing in boats and advanced to attack the
American forces, amounting to 1500. Colonel
Prescott. in ', command, gave the Â» order, "Re-
serve fire on the enemy until the whites of the
men's eyes can be seen.", . '' ; â â¢' --;
Tne British opened fire when within â¢ gun-
shot, i But on the American side all I was silent
as the tomb until the forcesÂ«of the enemy were
within close range, when along the crest of the
redoubt a storm of Are burst, hurling volley
after volley of leaden hail into their ranks,
causing them to rush pellmell back to their
boats. >.i â  â¢ .; .
â  They were, however, soon reinforced by 400
marines, and provided with c artillery. , In
making the second attack, Howe sought to
turn to â  his advantage the dense volumes of
smoke-rolling up from Charlestown, set on fire
by the hot balls from Copp's Hill battery.
But as he was leading his forces, enveloped in
these dark volumes, to take the American
works -by surprise, a breeze as from tbe fan
ning of a good angel's wing, wafted the smoke
and disclosed the insidious foe. When he came
within close range, the battle storm from the
breastworks burst upon him with the same
deadly effect as at first. His ranks were thin
ned, and their remnants fled in confusion.
Howe's forces, being re-enforced by those of
Clinton, made a third attack and succeeded in
scaling the ramparts, since their patriot de
fenders had discharged their last cartridge. As
the enemy's troops came pouring over, these
works a hand to hand conflict ensued in wnich
the Americans used their guns a* clubs. .
Owing to the overwhelming numbers of : the
British, Prescott ordered a ret; eat. He and
Warren were the last â¢to quit the works. Gen
eral Warren, as he was leaving, fell, shot
through the head. Starke and Knowlton.with
their forces, held their position until the re
treat had been successfully accomplished . and
then retired in good order. In this world re
nowned battle the Americans lost 450 men and
the British 1050.
On June 17, 1825, General Lafayette laid the
cornerstone of Bunker Hill monument.
j. It was fit that he, the last survivor of the
major generals of the American Revolution,
should consecrate the first brick iv that grand
structure. Amid the silent attention of
50,000 spectators this aged veteran and friend
of Washington, : with uncovered head, per
formed the imposing ceremonies and "Long
live Lafayette!' swelled up from the top of
Bunker Hill.
Bunker Hill' monument was finished in
1842, and was dedicated June 17, 1843.
Time, in his course down the ages, from
Eden's primal dawn to the present day, has
witnessed all the world's splendors and objects
of * worthâ has seen vast numbers of monu
ments of surpassing magnificence, but no one
of them comparable in glory to that plain,
granite structure on Bunker Hill. Though
mute, yet more eloquent than the tongue of
Demosthenes or that of Tully ! It tells of the
valor, the virtue, the sacrifices and the mighty
deeds of those who are now winged sons of
immortalityâ Prescott, Putnam, Stark,
Knowlton, Ridley, Pomeroy, and the 1500
patriots under their command in the first
great battle for American liberty. - Immortal
heroes all !
Â»v It is not only a memorial monument of our
venerated dead, but is a monument of glorious
victory. Though the defenders ot its sacred
site were overborne by superior numbers, yet
they were not conquered. The principle of
American liberty, for. which . they so bravely
fought, was - eventually victorious and ever
will be. *
In the evolution of human affairs, during
6000 years, the form of government developed
by the . principle of .: American liberty seems
the closest approximate to perfection. That
principle, with respect â¢to all classes, em
braces equality of rightsâ civil and religious
morality, intelligence, honor, fidelity: in a
word: "Do unto others as you would they
should do to you."
- "The art of government," says Confucius,
"is the great study." â¢ It Is the cover-all of wis
dom, experience and learning.
Monarchy, to maintain its sceptered sway, is
wont to lean for support upon the subtle de
vices of priestcraft. It hedges itself about
with preposterous pretenses; sets forth that it
is of divine origin; that it rules by "divine
right," and that "the king can do no wrong."
Priestcraft, to lurther the ends of monarchy
and its own ends, .works upon the supersti
tions of the massesâ upon their hopes and
fears j and : longing after immortality. The
masses, not . understanding the causes or
natural phenomena and tne frailty of human
nature, accept without question statements no
matter how marvelous; impostures no matter
how preposterous. Gods, ghosts, genii, men,
animals and things inanimate may figure to
gether without outrage to probability, so long
as superstition goes unrestrained .by cultured
reason.
The ancient Romans excelled i not more :in
arms, in arts, in eloquence and in almost
everything that can adorn human nature, than
in superstitious folly. They deified not : only
beasts Â» and ' things .void of all sense, but
worshiped the very worst: of mankind; such
a penchant had they for gods, that they paid
1112
not only homage to those of their own coun
try, but to all strange deities coming to Rome,
bo that in time, deities became so numerous
there that necessity compelled the Romans to
colonize them as they did their surplus popu
lation. Juvenal says, satirically, with respect
to the multiplicity of divinities:
Religious nations sure, and blessed abodes L- â¢:::â 
Where every orchard is overrun with gods.
From the earliest records of history to the
present time, priestcraft has been a most po
tent factor in the affairs of civil government.
The first effective barrier against it. was reared
by the framers of the constitution of the
United States, wherein is set forth these words:
Congress shall make no law respecting an estab
lishment ot religion, or prohibiting the tree exercise
thereof.
This.the fundamental law, vouchsafes to every
one the free exercise of his religion within the
scope of good morals, but places an impassable
bar between church and state. It secures
each religiom denomination from taxation
for the support of another of a different faith ;
it shields religion against hardship from un
friendly legislation, and protects American
liberty "from the wiles of bigotry and from the
Jollies of superstition. ; â 
We are advised by the ablest expounders of
the constitution, that all the checks human
ingenuity has been able to devise to give per
fect operation to the machinery of govern
mentâto adjust all its movements, to prevent
its eccentricities and to balance its forcesâ
have been introduced with singular skill and
wisdom into the structure of the constitution.
The constitution was approved and adopted,
and is approved and adopted by an intelligent
and liberty-loving people. It has for a century
and upward been tested in the crucible of ex
perience, and is found 1000 fine. Under its
tcgis from a small band of patriots there has
grown up in a century "a Nation of the highest
and grandest type ever before known among
men"; a Nation surpassing in general intel
ligence, National wealth and all the sub
stantial means of happiness any other Nation
on the face of the globe; a Nation consisting
of seventy millions of united sovereigns whose
domain of inexhaustible resources spreads out
from the gulf to the Arctic and from the At
lantic to the Pacific. Where a cen
tury ago were interminable forests now
are" extended orchards, vineyards and
fertile fields of waving grain, ; innum
erable manufactories . of vast propor
tions and happy homes, numerous as the stars
that shine above them. Where then blazed
the council fire 01 the Indian braves stands the
Statehouse of civilized man. The waters that
were then rippled by the rude and fragile canoe
are now shaken by the thunders of mighty na
vies and plowed dv the rich laden merchantmen
of every nation. Cities with swelling domes
and cloud-piercing 6pires have sprung up
where then the red man was, in his native
wilderness, wont to range unmolested and un
controlled.
Contemplating these vast changes, far ex
ceeding the conceptions of romance, who can
doubt that under these auspices American lib
erty will hence on advance still more rapidly?
Who can doubt that travel, now conducted in
palaces of more than regal splendorâ palaces
borne with impetuous speed on links of steel,
joining hamlets, cities and country residences
throughout one vast domain will be rendered
still more felicitous and expeditious? Who
can doubt that a tongue more tractable and
fluent than the electric may be employed for
communicating thought from place to place
though thousands of miles apart? And who
can doubt that the homes of the masses will be
blessed with a greater abundance of the neces
saries, comforts and luxuries of life than they
have been wont to enjoy? No doubt need to
exist. --^" > .'â '-'
Though three thousand miles intervene - be
tween Bunker Hill monument and Santa Cruz,
the elysium of the Golden State, yet are we in
heart, in sympathy, in presence of that grand
memorial structure, ever proclaiming the
"rights of man" to "life.-liberty and the pur

A D ARE -DEVIL ENTERPEISE.
How Kobert Smalls Seized the Confed
erate Steamship Planter.
How Robert Smalls, the well-Known
negro politician of Charleston, S. C, took
possession of the Confederate steamship
Planter in Charleston harbor during the
war and delivered her to . the Federal au
thorities forms the subject of one of the
most interesting war claims now before
Congress. At that time Smalls received a
part of the prize-money, but . the full
amount to which he was entitled was
never paid him, and there is now before
the House a bill, favorably, reported,
which appropriates $20,000, to be paid over
to him for the performance of one of the
most daring feats Of the rebellion. . This
case is not entirely new in Congressional
history, for Mr. Smalls has not been idle
all these years, and the measure has been
previously considered by the committee
and favorably recommended. But com
paratively few persons know the history of
the case, which is given in detail in one of
the reports recently made to -the House
from the Committee on War Claims: *J_fÂ£
On May 13, 1862, the Confederate steam
boat Planter, the special dispatch-boat of
General Ripley, the Confederate post com
mander at Charleston, S. C, was taken by
Robert Smalls under .the following cir
cumstances from the wharf â¢at which she
was lying, carried safely out of Charleston
harbor, and delivered to one of the vessels
of tbe Federal fleet then blockading that
port:
On the day previous, May 12, the Planter,
which had for two weeks been engaged in
removing guns from Coles Island to James
Island, returned to Charleston. That night
all the officers went ashore and slept in
the city, leaving on board a crew ; of eight
men, all colored. Among them was
Robert Smalls, who ; was virtually
the pilot of the boat, although :he
was only- called a wheelman, because at
that time no colored man could have, in
fact, been made a pilot. For . some â¢ time
previous he had been watching for an op
portunity to carry into execution a plan
he bad conceived to take the Planter to
the Federal fleet. . This, he saw, was about
as good a chance as he would ever have to
do so, and therefore he determined not to
lose it. Consulting with the rest of the
crew, Smalls found that they were willing
to co-operate with him, although two o
them afterward concluded to remain be
hind. The design was hazardous in the
extreme.
Tbe boat would have to pass beneath
the guns of the forts in the harbor. . Fail
ure and detection would have been cer
tain death. Fearful was the venture, but
it was made. The daring resolution had
been formed and under command of Rob
ert Smalls wood was taken aboard, steam
was put on, and with her valuable cargo of
guns and ammunition, intended for Fort
Ripley, a new fortification just con
structed in the harbor, about 2 o'clock in
the morning the Planter silently moved
off from her dock, steamed up to North
Atlantic wharf, where Small's wife and
two children, together with four other
women and one other child, and also three
men, were waiting to embark. , *â¢.*":
All these were taken on board, and then,
at 3:25 a. m., May 13, the Planter started on
her perilous adventure, carrying nine
men, N five women and three children. |
Passing Fort Johnson, the Planter's steam
whistle blew the usual salute and she pro
ceeded down the bay. Approaching Fort
Sumter, Smalls stood in the pilot-house
leaning out of the window, with his arms
folded across his breast, after the manner
of Captain Relay, the commander of the
boat, and his head covered with the huge j
straw hat which Captain Relay commonly
wore on such occasions. ..-â ..â¢'
The signal required to be given by all
steamers passing out was blown as coolly
as if General Ripley was on board going
out on a tour ot inspection. Sumter, an
swered by signal, "All right,'' and the
Planter headed toward Morris Island, j
then occupied by Hatch's light artillery, \
and passed beyond the range of Sumter's j
guns before anybody suspected anything
was wrong. â¢ When at last the Planter was !
obviously going toward the Federal fleet ]
off the bar Sumter signaled toward Morris j
Island to stop her. But it was too late. As
the Planter approached the Federal fleet a |
white flag was displayed, but this was not j
at first discovered, and the Federal
steamers, supposing the Confederate rams !
were coming to attack them, stood out to
deep water.
But the ship Onward, Captain Nichols,
which was not a steamer, remained,
opened her ports, and was about to fire
into the Planter, when she noticed the flag
of truce. As soon as the vessels came ,
within hailing distance of each other the I
Planter's errand was explained. Captain j
Nichols then boarded her and Smalls de
livered the Planter to him. From the |
Planter Smalls was transferred to the j
Augusta, the flagship off the bar, under j
the command of Captain Parrott. by whom |
the Planter with Smalls and her crew I
were sent to Port Royal to Rear-Admiral j
Dupont, then in command of the southern i
squadron. . mself
Smalls continued to distinguish hi and
in a number of naval engagements, bile
on one occasion, in December, 1863, w
the Planter, then under Captain Nicker- :
son, was sailing through Folly Island j
Creek the Confederate batteries at Seces- ;
sionviile opened a very hot fire upon her.
Captain: Nickerson became demoralized, j
and left the pilot-house and secured him
self in tne coal bunker. Smalls was on â 
the deck, and finding out that the captain ]
had deserted his post, entered tbe pilot- ;
house, took command of the boat and car- j
ried â¢ her safely out of the reach of the
guns. For this conduct he was promoted i
by order of General Gill more, command- j
ing the , Department of the South, to the
rank of captain, and was ordered to act as j
captain of the Planter, which was used as j
a supply boat along the coast until the end I
of the war. In September, 1866, he carried I
his boat to Baltimore, where she was put j
out of commission and sold.â -Washington |

THE AVERAGE MAN.
! One Who Comes Within That Classifi-
I cation May Consider Himself Lucky.
"It's a pleasure to fit you,", said the
clothing salesman to his customer.
"Why?" queried bis patron as he
glanced complacently over his shoulder
at his figure reflecting in a long mirror.
"Because you are an average man. I
mean that your height, width oi should-
ers, chest measure, length of back, width
across the hips, length of arms and legs,
and general 'set' conform to the average
dimensions struck off by the manufac- â¢
turer of ready-made clothing."
"I thought you . could : fit any sized
man." '.likvi-^ i:
"So we can, but to do it sometimes we
must break up three different sets of cloth
ingâtake the coat from one, the vest from
another and the trousers from another.
Now, with you it is different. I simply
took the chest measure and found the coat
in a few minutes made for that measure.
The vest and trousers were all right, of
course, for you are a man of average build.
And you are a lucky man, too, according to
my way of thinking. I know that when it
is said 'Ob, he is an average man,' the
term is used in the deprecatory sense. As
a matter of fact, to say that a man is an
average man is to say that he will go
through life easily, with less friction, with
more pleasure and less annoyance than the
man who is above or below the average.
Everything made in quantity is made to
fit tbe average man. A door knob is
placed where it is most handy to the man
of average height. A letter-box is put
up so that the average man can mail his
letters with the least difficulty. Car
straps hang down far enough for the
average, man to clutch them with the
least effort and they are placed so that
the average man can get in and out of a
streetcar easily.
"Hats, shoes, shirts, collars, cuffs, stock
ings, clothing ol every sort, are made of
average sizes. If a man of a certain height
is too fat or too slim for the average build
of that height, be is in throuble as soon as
he enters a clothing store. If his legs are
too long or too short, the salesman must
overhaul his stock and try on a number of
trousers before he finds a pair that will fit,
and frequently he must have them altered
after all. . , . Â
"Now, it's the same way with other
things. The man of average intelligence,
average brain power, : average scho ling,
average morality and average religious
ideas will get along in the world better
than men who stand high above him.
Men above the average have added re
sponsibilities thrust upon them. More is
expected of them. s They are supposed to
keep up a fast gait, and If they do not the
world finds fault with them. The average
citizen, average husband, average father,
average man is happy because be is incon
spicuous. He goes along unnoticed, as he
is neither a fool nor a genius. He attracts
no attention and finds ten times more
solid pleasure in life than those who are
highly gifted in one way or another. You
see, the average man is a well-balanced
man, and balance means stability, and
stability means rest. I have figured this
thing out, and have come to the conclusion
tbat the world- is better because of the
great majority !of average men, who go
steadily and quietly along, not because of
the few geniuses who flash up, and blaze
like bonfires for a time and then aie down
to have their ashes blown into everybody's
eyes to annoy and pester them."â Chicago

A strange custom is still observed in
Roumania which reminds one strongly of
Robinson Crusoe. When a servant has
displeased bis or her master, the offender
takes his boots in bis hands and places
them before the ' bedroom - door of his
master. It is a sign of great submission,
and the boots are either kicked away as an
intimation that tbe fault will: not be for
given, or ' else the servant is told to place
them on his feet, which shows that he is
forgiven.

LONDON, Eng., June 17.â dispatch
received here to-day reports that the Brit
ish steamer DrummOnd Castle, which
sailed from Table Bay May, 28 for this
port with 250 persons on board, was sunk
near Ushant, the most westerly of 'the
islands off the coast of Brittany, France.
She was damaged by collision with an
other steamer and sank in three minutes.
A survivor of the disaster, named Mer
werk, is at Ushant, and two others at He
de Molen. Six bodies have been recovered.
: A representative of the Castle line stated
that the Drummond Castle's passenger
list contained 143 names, and that she car
ried a crew of 104 men. , .iv:'
The United Press corresDondent at Brest
telegraphed to-night that no positive
knowledge had been obtained up to that
hour regarding the fate of the missing
passengers and crew of the sunken steamer
except as before, reportedâ one survivor
was at Ushant and two others were at the
He de Molen/ and that six bodies had
been recovered. The correspondent also
stated that a seat is being made by
steamers in the vicinity of the scene of the
disaster in the hope of rescuing other sur
vivors.
The Drummond Castle was of 2381 tons
register and was commanded by Captain
Pierce. She belonged to the famous Cas
tle line of steamships running between
South Africa and London, and was last
heard of at Las Pal mas.
Tugs have been sent out from Brest to
the scene of the disaster in the hope of
picking up some of the survivors.- The
fate of the steamer with which she col

WORST FEARS CO NFIR MED.
Heartrending Scenes at the Office of the
Steamship Company.
LONDON, Esq., June 17.â A telegram
was received to-night at the Admiralty
Office from ibe commander of the British
warship Sibyll, which is cruising
in the Bay of. Biscay, . confirm
ing the reports previously, received re
garding the suddeness of the foundering of
i the Drummond â¢ Castle. The telegram
'states that the Sibyll lowered her ' boats
and did ail possible to rescue those on
board the steamer, but the efforts of the
cruiser's men were in vain.
Many friends of persons who were known
to have been onboard the lost steamer,
especially ladies, remained at the offices of
the steamship company until late to
night, hoping to learn that there were
other survivors of the disaster, arid that
among them would be found their friends.
The telegrams received only tended to
confirm the worst reports and several per
sons fainted and many painful - scenes
were enacted when the messages were
read. -
Ths Castle Steamship Company at mid
night to-night had received no further
news regarding the sinking of the boat.
The Daily News prints the names of
some of the passengers on the Drummond
Castle, including a number of residents of
Johannesburg, Kim berley and Cape Town,
who were accompanied by their wives and
children. ' 'Â', / .?<â¢
The News also pnblishes a report of an
interview had with Sir Donald Currie, M.
P., chairman of the Castle Steamship Com
pany, in which Sir Donald 'declared that
Ushante was a terrible place; the current
in the vicinity of the island being very
strong and running irregularly. _
Captain Pearce, Sir Donald added, had
been thirty-three years in the company's
service and was considered a first-rate
man. * . ' ,' :" â ;
Among the passengers on the Drum
mond Castle were some of the persons
who were concerned in the recent troubles:
in the Transvaal. Late advices" from Brest
state that the Drummond Castle was mak
ing the passage from Plymouth to the
east of Ushante Island when the acci-
dent occurred.
A slight haze hung over the water and
the steamer crashed upon a rock and
foundered in three minutes.
This disposes of the report that the boat
was in a collision, and it is conjectured
that the Drummond Castle was lost while
trying to make the always dangerous pas- j
sage to the east of Ushante Island.

LOVED BY A CONDUCTOR
Mrs. Mcllrath of Oakland Fol-
lowed East by a Street-Car
Man.
He Made Threats Against Her Life
and She Had Him Ar-
rested.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 17. â Mrs
Agnes Mcllrath of West Oakland, Cal.,
called at the office of the Police Prosecutor
this afternoon to ask protection against
â¢W. E. Jackson from the same place. Her
j story was distinctly peculiar. Mrs. Mc
i llrath said she was a widow and in good
social standing in West Oakland, and was
! accustomed to ride on the Grove-street
line of streetcars.
Jackson was a fine-looking fellow and
was a conductor on that line and became
madly in love with her. He secured an
introduction and for a time she returned
his interest. After a little, however, he
became obnoxious to her and she treated
him with coldness and tried to rid herself
of him. He acted with violence, threat
ening to shoot her and threw a stone at
I her. -:;,
After considerable trouble she left Cali
; fornia to visit relatives in her girlhood
i home in Beaver, Pa., chiefly to get rid of
l Jackson. From there she came here, and j
I is stopping with the family of S. T. Leba- 1
! ron on Crawford road. Last night, to her
j dismay, Jackson called there, and threat
ened that if she would not meet him in
j Wade Park this afternoon he would kill
j her or throw vitriol in ber face.
The police fold her.to keep the appoint
ment, and were there at the time and
j arrested Jackson. The man says he never
j threatened tbe woman, but admits his
passion.' Mrs. Mcllrath is in mortal terror
of him. For a time she lived in the Mil
lard House in Oakland and was later on
the staff of the West Oakland Home.

THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE.
More Depositions Against Mrs.
Emma Parker in the Will
Contest.
Accused of Intemperance, Immoral ty
and Making Threats to Kill
Jane Pomeroy.
SAN JOSE, C.v,., June 17.â 1n the
Parker will contest to-day some damaging
evidence was introduced against Emma
L. Parker, the contestant. The entire day
was given over to the reading of deposi
tions and most of them gave Mrs. Parker a
very bad reputation. : , â¢
At the opening of court the reading of
the deposition of Margaret McDonald was
continued. She had advised Mrs. Emma
Parker to tell George Parker and Noah
and Jane Pomeroy the -truth- about her
past life. . . :^._.--^..^.:y
Emma Parker was afraid to do so. A
Emms' Parker was"' afraid to do so. A
Mr. Mitchell called at the Pomeroy. house
and Emma Parker said that be was settling
up her estate in California. She also told
her husband so. When Edward Parker
found out that his wife had lied to him
about her property he was very angry.
Mrs. Pomeroy told Mrs. McDonald that
Emma Parker was an inveterate liar.
There were a number of stories afloat in
the neighborhood as to Mrs. Parker's past
life.
The deposition of Mrs. Mary A. Frost
a cousin of Mrs. Jane Pomeroy, was then
read. She had lived at i Airs. J?omeroy's
bouse, and bad a room on tbe same floor
as Edward Parker and his wife. The night
Edward Parker and his wife left tbe Pome
roy bouse she heard Em maParker threaten
to .blow Jane Pomeroy's brains out.
Emma Parker was enraged because Mrs.
Pomeroy had found out about her past life
and bad character.
The deposition of George Lewis was very
damaging to the contestant. He had
known Mr*. Parker at Plantsville.: He
had gone to school with her, and her name
then was Emma Hough. Prior to her
marriage with Edward Parker, she was liv
ing with a man. Her â¢ character for chast
ity had always been bad. After her mar
riage she was known to have criminal
intimacies with other men.
. George Van Nostrand, captain of police
of Meriden, Conn., said he knew Mrs. Par
ker as Emma Hough in 1868. . At ; that
time she was an Inmate of a bouse of ill
fame. ; On one occasion she got drunk and
raised a â  row, and was ordered . by the po
lice to leave town. :
: Similar depositions showing the bad
character of Mrs. Emma Parker were read
during the day.

STILL AT HER OLD TRICKS
Naomi Temple Trying to Cap-
ture a Young Chicago
Millionaire.
She' Has Already Been Divorced Four
Times From the Same
Husband.
PORTLAND, Or, June Chief of
Police Minto to-day received a letter from
Felix V. Batchelderof Chicago urging him
to look up the record of one Mrs Naomi
T. Temple, formerly of this city, who left
here about nine years ago for the East.
The tenor of Mr. Batcheldor's letter
would indicate that be is the elder son of
a retired millionaire merchant of Chicago,
and that he uesires to avert a mesalliance,
as be terms it, between his younger
brother and Mrs. Temple. The writer im
portuned. the Chief to be as speedy as pos
sible in tracing the woman's local history
and transmit it in full by wire. Â«
She .".was \ Naomi Kirkham, who came
here from San Francisco in 1885, becoming
an inmate of Carrie Bain bridge' resort.
About six months after her arrival here
she .married \ Tom : Duckworth, a Victoria
(B. C.) gambler, and a merry life they led.
Daring the six or eight months that she
and Duckworth lived together in this city
in various lodging-houses, she at different
times took a dozen shots at him, with the
best of intention to kill, but he never
was injured by the erring pistol of his wife
and he never caused her arrest for those
attempts upon his life.
In the summer of 1888 she returned here
from the East on a visit as Mrs. Temple,
accompanied by a new husband, whom
she introduced among her own set as a
wealthy New Mexico mine owner, but who
in fact was a Santa Fe faro dealer. The
couple were well-mated and well-matched,
for Temple was as unscrupulous as she, a
fact evidenced a year later when this
couple were at Colorado Springs, Col.;
where Naomi captured a wealthy young
invalid/said to have been a nephew of
Millionaire Russell Sage of New York.
She obtained a divorse from Temple in
Denver and married the invalid, whom
she mulcted out of $30,000 and deserted
him. Her victim died at the springs six
months later, but in the interim Naomi had
again been hob-bobbing with her divorced
husband. This dangerous woman has al
together a record of four divorces from
Temple, which nave been procured with
his connivance to enable her. to rotyunsus
pecting and susceptable wealthy victims.
TACOMA'S NEW DRYDOCK.
Captain Higgins Is â¢ bout to Commence
Operations.
TACOMA. Wash., June 17.â Captain
John E. Higgins announced to-day that
he will build a graving drydockat the
Narrows, five miles west of Tacoma, com
mencing next month. To-day he sent the
Elans and contracts to New York to his
rother and other capitalists interested in
the project. ;_
Contractors Dougan, Bringham & Cowen
to-day signed a contract to build the dock
for 186.000, giving a $40,000 bond. : As soon
as the contract and plans are ratified in
the East work will be commenced.
Repair shops and machinery will in
crease the cost of the plant to over $125,- i
000. The dimensions of the dock will be :
Length, clear of keel blocks, 425 feet; ,
depth, 21 feet; width, 90 feet at top and
50 on bottom. It will be similar in con
struction and about two-thirds of the size
of the Government dock at Port Orchard.
Captain Higgins has been prominent on
the Paciric Coast since 1851, when he ar
rived at San ; Francisco â  as mate on . the
John Best rum. '
Between v then and : 1870 he was fore
man for several years during the con
struction of the docks at Mare Island and
foreman in the employ of the Pacific Mail
Company three years. % In the seventies he
built several steamersat Sacramento, later
coming to Puget Sound, where he got out
cargoes "of spars for Ban Francisco firms.
He has been working on the drydock pro
ject six â¢ years, securing the ' site in 1890.
This will make the second dryaock at Ta
coma, the floating dock at Quartermaster
Harbor having been built in 1891.

20 MARKET S.T.SJ^HrTROUBLE IN THE
OLYMPIC CLUB.
Members Object to Special
Privileges Being
Dispensed.
CORBETT CAUSES IT.
Insist He Must Not Spar in
Private, But in the Pub-
lie Room.
CHOYNSKI MAY BE MATCHED.
\ I.J Truman Saw the Champion Knock
Down Van Buskirk and Was
Quite Satisfied.
There is a spirit of unrest in the Olym-
pic Club. Some of the members are chaf-
ing under what they believe is favoritism
shown by those in authority to some so-
called "select clique."
It cropped up at the time when Joe
Cboynski was training for his eight-round
battle with Tom Sharkey. Joe made the
clu brooms his headquarters, sparring there
every day with bis trainers and those
members of the club who did not mind
putting the gloves on with him.
These bouts usually took place in the
room especially devoted to tbe wheelmen,
away from the gaze of the vulgar horde â
only a select few being permitted to be in
attendance.
At first nobody seemed to care particu
larly that the exercising was not done with
open doors untii Van Buskirk, the club's
heavy weight, was coaxed to don the mit
tens with Joe's opponent. Then there
were scores of members who wanted to see
the fun. Only a few were allowed within
the room and the remainder set up a per
fect howl of indignation at what they be
lieved was the curtailing of their right as
members to enter any room within the
club building.
That died out, however, or rather the
ill feeling slumbered, to be awakened later
on with renewed life. r- '
â¢ When Jim Corbett cbose the Olympic
Clv brooms for his training quarters mem
bers who do not usually visit the rooms
once in a month began showing up there
morning, afternoon and night. Their ob
ject was. obvious. But Corbett failed to
exhibit himself in the regular boxing
rooms, and the old sore was reopened.
"What right has anyone to exclude a
member in good standing from any room
in the club?'' was asked on all sides.
{Secretary Kennedy was assailed by
-scores of members, who demanded . that
they should be permitted to witness any
contest taking place within the building.
It was no use explaining to tbem tbat
Corbett and his trainers preferred to do
their work unobserved; they knew better,
for Corbett himself had told all those who j
â¢poke to him on the subject that he was
willing to have any and everybody watch I
him in his exercising.
Such is truly Corbett's sentiment. He
loes not mind a crowd of members in the
east watching his doings. But his oppo
nents are the ones who prefer being alone
with the champion when he punches them
inhere and when he cares.
For instance, yesterday Van Buskirk
was "taken down," as .the saying goes, in
nore ways than one. As usual, he put
>n the gloves with Jim, little thinking at
â be time that be would have a distin
guished audience to witness his discom
iture.
It so happened that General W. H. L.
Barnes and President I. J. Truman of the
?ivic Federation were in the club, and at
heir earnest solicitation to see Corbett
ipar they were quietly ushered into tbe
oom. ; -:?y
Prior to this Mr. Truman was properly
illed up witb assurances that there was
lotning objectionable in boxing bouts De
ween clever men of sound health.
"There, is nothing rough ; no blood;
-verything just smooth and nice; a regu
ar tea party as it were." That is what
At. Truman went in to look at.
What be saw was slightly different.
The two gladiators were hot at it: Van
Juskirk had just landed on Corbett' neck
ndwas about to do the same thing over
ritb a straight left jab. Jim was waiting
or this and cross-countered Van with his
ight, the glove fetching up against the
lie' fellow's nose, setting him down hard
m the padded floor.
It was a beautiful stroke, Van Buskirk
leing made to forget any other ailment he
tad ever bad in a lifetime. He was not
xactly knocked out, '-but. very near it."
'here was a little blood spilled, but not
nough to frighten the president of the
iivic Federation nor the old warrior Gen
ral Barnes.
Corbett picked up bis fallen foe, stood
iim gently on his feet, and when be had
utficiently recovered they went at it again
lore gently.
Mr. Truman thought the whole thing
ras perfectly lovely and he remained to
Â»c Jim Corbett box with George Green
nd another club member yyy*2u
"I really see nothing wrong about box
ig-matches," he stated as he left the
uilding.
On the 26th of this month, the night
fter Corbett meets Sharkey, the Olympic
lub proposes holding a "ladies' night,"
ben the champion will spar for the delec
ition of the fair sex. Billy Smith will be
is opponent.
Torn Sharkey bas resumed his training
i Oakland. His -handball- practice has
inhered him up wonderfully. As a mat
sr of fact he "will enter the ring against
orbctt a2O ncr cent better man than the
Ignt be and Choynski bad their eight
>und go.
JIM AND CHOYNSKI.
hey May Be Matchedâ Corbett to
Be Accorded a Special Room.
At a meeting of the Olympic Club direc
ts held last evening, the 'question of
iowine Jim Corbett a special apartment
l which he could exercise without having
i appear before members of the club and
18 friends of members, who generally
vn umbered the 'representatives of the
Ã¼b, was discussed at length. â 
The directors thought Corbett, who is one
'the bill members of good standing.should
l granted some special privileges, and
ley accordingly decided to give him the
Be use of some one compartment wherein
Â»can train for his contest with Sharkey
' peace. ' 'Â'
It is perfectly immaterial to -Corbett
whether he exercises in private or before
the gaze of the club members.
The members who box with him object
to being made; targets for the jokers to
shoot at, and ,it was principally through
their request that the directors concluded
last evening to give the champion and his
trainers a special apartment. It was
quietly hinted last evening that when Jim
was practicing : "the outsiders" who had
been invited to be present at the practice
bouts had more to say in the matter of
who should not .be present than the mem
bers taemselves.
The directors are figuring upon giving
an open tournament in the near future at
which the star attraction will be a ten
round contest between, Coibett and
Choynski. Possibly at the next meeting
of the board some action may be taken
with a view of bringing the native sons
together. â¢ â¢ " n'
The directors have given. Leader Short
sanction to hold an amateur -handball
tournament on July 16, 17 and 18 at the
Occidental handball court. The classes
will be divided into first, second and
third and valuable prizes will be offered
for competition.
TO VETO THE ORDINANCE.
The Mayor Not In Favor of Llcens-
Inar Physical-Culture Contests.
Acting Mayor Taylor will veto the ordi
nance recently passed by the Board of
Supervisors licensing boxing exhibitions
and taking the power of granting permits
for the same out of the hands of the Mayor
and vesting it in the board. Mayor Taylor
opposed the measure when it was before
the board, and his action in refusing to
affix bis signature to the order is not un
expected.
Colonel Taylor has two principal reasons
for opposing the ordinance.
The first is that he believes' that the
board has exceeded its authority in pass
ing it in that it bas assumed the duties of
the executive bead of the City government
after having acted as the legislative head.
He holds that as the board exercises the
legislative right to pass an ordinance
licensing the contests it has no right to
the executive privilege of saying what ex
hibitions shall receive the necessary per
mission. '
The second reason is that the ordinance
is illegal inasmuch as it licenses a contest
that the law of the State says is a felony â
namely, a prizefight.
He takes the ground that the so-called
physical culture exhibitions are nothing
but fights for the money that is paid by
the audience for admission. He speaks of
the numerous knockouts tbat have oc
curred as evidence that skill is not so
much the point as brute force and a desire
to win the money at stake by the quickest
means possible. :r f.
It is probable tbat the veto of the acting
Mayor Will be sustained, inasmuch as he
has three members of the board on his
side. When the matter first came up Su
pervisors Spreckels and Dimond joined
him in opposing it. Supervisor Hobbs
was absent at that time, but is believed to
be with the acting Mayor on the proposi
tion. As it requires nine votes to pass
any measure' over the Mayor's veto, the
ordinance seems doomed to fall.
The veto, however, will only affect con
tests subsequent to tbe Corbett-Sharkey
affair.
EUGENE LOUD RETURNS.
He Speaks of the Good Work
.--Done by California's Dele-
. gation.
Pending an Investigation, Congress
Will Make No Move- Toward
Cuban Recognition.
. Yesterday morning's Southern overland
train brought home Congressman Eugene
F. Loud, Republican member of the Fifth
Congressional District. He was met at the
Sixteenth-street station, Oakland, by his
daughter, Mrs. Callundan, Captain Cal-
lundan, ex-Supervisor Morton and a num
ber of friends. His youngest daughter
accompanied him to Washington on his
last trip East, and returned with tbe party.
Congressman Loud is not inclined to
talk of his prospects of renomination. He
mentioned his possible candidacy, but
merely incidentally, and upon the ques
tion being put to* him directly.smilingly
replied :
"It depends upon circumstances. If the
people want me they will doubtless give
me another chance.
"Candidly," he continued, â  "politics
occupied my mind but little during my
stay at the capital. , This . session's ! duties
were unusually onerous, and th- whole of
California's delegation has had its hands
full attending to business of interest to
the Pacific Coast.
"You, perhaps, have noticed that the
slope has not suffered for lack of appro-
priations. We have tared very well this
year. The San Franciscans, however,
have been too modest. â¢ They should have
pressed their claims for Government im
provement further.
." "For instance, more money should have
been applied for to better San Francisco
harbor. Oakland harbor is under the con-
tinuous .contract law, and it can be seen
that the. estuary is rapidly improving
under that system.
"My efforts in behalf of my second-class
postage bill took up a deal of my time. I
conferred with the Press Association " and
leading publishers, the papers . being di-
rectly interested in the measure, and re-
ceived tbe support of all the leading news-
papers in the country."
Congressman Loud did not believ e that
Cuban war news was regarded as strictly
reliable in Congress. , He said nothing in
the way of recognition would be done at
Washington until the investigation now
being conducted by this Government bad
been productive of satisfactory results.
Further, he stated, information regard-
ing Cuba has been difficult to obtain, con-
tradictory accounts of engagements hay-
ing been the rule rather than the excep
tion.
"My choice for Presidential nominee,"
said Loud, "is Reed, but as be appears to
be out of the race my second choice is Mc-
Kinley. Reed is, in my opinion, the great
est statesman of the day, but McKinley
appears to be the spontaneous choice of
the people. It is the protection issue that
is carrying him ahead." '
: â¢ It is rumored that. Frank Powers and
both Austin and Rea of ; Santa Clara are
ambitious to return in Loud's place.
I'hey i-itvor Protection.
Among the organizations which will partici
pate in the ratiticat ion meeting next Saturday
night is the McKinley Club; consisting of Re
publicans in the vicinity of Polk and Pacific
streets. This organization was formed in 1893
and -is devoted to the principles of the Republi
can party, clean politics and protection. They

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1896.
CLIFTON'S COACH
SUBJECT TO DUTY.
Collector Wise Takes a Hand
in His Lordship's
Affairs.
HOW M'CARTY LOSES.
The Gift of His Rich Friend Seized
by Local and Federal
Authorities.
COMPLICATIONS MAY FOLLOW.
Joe Livingstone's Claim Against the
White.Hat Turfman Is Not
Yet Satisfied.
Talbot Clifton's coach, the vehicle which
set all Blingnm crazy two years ago; and
later caused White-Hat McCarty to dream
of dollars easily earned, has fallen mdi
rectly into the hands of the United States
Government. Collector Wise, as the rep-
resentative of the Federal authorities, has
put in a claim of $900 for duty that has
not been paid.
It appears that the coach arrived here in
July, 1894. Clifton was then cutting a wide
swath in the City, spending money like
water in his effort to beat the races and the
poker games at various clubs. He con-
ceived the idea of paralyzing "Blingum"
with a coach and four the like of which
had never been seen here. ; He ordered a
British manufacturer to hammer together
a vehicle at a cost of over $2000, and when
it arrived there was a rush of admiring
friends to behold it.
A Deputy Collector happening to see the
coach bethought him of a law relating to
the duty on imported vehicles and found
that the Government was entitled to a duty
of 45 per cent of the value of the coach.
This duty, however, was collectable only
in the event that the vehicle was to be
sold. When Clifton was. reminded of the
law he vowed that he did not intend to sell
the coach, but that he purposed to keep it
for his private use until the spokes gave
way. On this statement the coach and
Clifton were allowed to depart.
Some weeks ago . Clifton was summoned
to England to "stand for Parliament." He
left hurriedly, and in his going failed to
recall a debt of $1300 due tbe Burlingame
Club. He remembered, however, to trans
fer to McCarty the famous coach, together
with sundry other articles. 7,?/: ;
When the " white hat gentleman ap
j peared, however, to claim his property he
j was met with the bill above mentioned.
j There was some parleying and not a few
j threats, resulting finally in McCarty send
i ing a cablegram to his lordship relating
how matters stood. /
"Clifton promptly telegraphed an order
for $1300, and McCarty was at once given
possession of the coach. But bis triumph
was short lived. It seems that in 1892 the
white-bat turfman borrowed $1000 from
Joe Livingstone, which he has since been
unable to pay. " -
Livingstone has tried every possible way
to secure his coin, but could never find
anything belonging to McCarty. Sud
denly, however, ' Clifton's gift hove in
sight, and the alert creditor lost; no time
in securing an attachment on the same. â¢
But now Collector Wise steps forward
j with a claim of 45 per cent ad valorem
i duty on the coach, which on a valuation
lof $2000, amounts to exactly $900. The
' Collector claims that Clifton made false
statements to evade the payment of tbe
duty, and holds that the Government
! must be paid first. It is quite likely that
the action of Mr. Wise will result in con-
siderable litigation.
In tbe meantime Livingstone is wonder
i ing just what figure he cuts in the situa
tion. McCarty, he of white- hat fame,
smiles pleasantly at all the trouble his
erratic friend Clifton bas crested, and ex-
presses the belief that he will come out of
the wreck sole owner and proprietor of
Blingum's famous four-in-hand.
The effects in the Maison Riche apart-
ments, which were left to McCarty by
Clifton, were attached yesterday by the
Sheriff for $155, which W. S. Bradbury, a
contractor, claims is owing him from the
wearer of the white hat
FULL OF ENTHUSIASM.
Young Men's Republican Club
Holds a Rousing Mass-
Meeting.
Congressional Aspirants Make Speeches
in Favor of McKinley and
Protection.
The Young Men's Republican Club of
the Forty-first Assembly District held an
enthusiastic rally at its' headquarters,
corner of Fillmore and Filbert streets, last
evening. The primary object of the meet
ing was to make, arrangements for
participation in the grand ratification
meeting of the Republican nominees
which is to y ' be held- on Saturday
night; but a number of good speakers
had been invited, and the' affair developed
into a .rousing Republican meeting. A
portion of the Presidio. band was present
to enliven proceedings, and the hah was
appropriately decked with American flags.
Charles W. Woods, president of the club,
called the meeting to order, and in a biief
speech outlined the objects of the organi
zation. .He laid particular stress upon the
fact that the club was no mere paper affair,
but a \ bona fide working organization of
the loyal . young Republicans of â¢: the dis
trict. ; He introduced H. C. Firebaugh of
the McKinley Club, who is an aspirant for
Congressional honors : from : the Fifth Dis
trict, and made a short but earnest, ad
dress. "" ..' I
Mr. Firebaugh said that he - was ;, per
fectly satisfied with McKinley and Morton
as the standard-bearers. of the Republican
party ; during ; the ; coming campaign,^ and
he would also be. satisfied with any of the
other gentlemen who were being named
for the high places on the ticket. "I am
satisfied," he said, "that we are on the eve
of a return .to Republican : principles,
which brought â¢ this , land -' to a, position
second to none, commercially, industrially
and mechanically. T. The people are now

of $10,000,000 made by him is almost
enough to make the people doubt it."
â¢: The speaker tlien spoke of the necessity
of a ' protective . tariff tp American - labor.
He also favored a restricted immigration
and urged that, foreign- born citizens who
had affiliated with Americans in the true
sense of the word should join in the effort
, to prevent the introduction â¢ of all com
peting elements.
I'm F. H. Powers, Assemblyman from the
Forty-first District and the special favorite
of the ,Young Men's Club for Congress
from the Fifth, was called upon. y His ad
dress was mainly directed to young Re
publicans. 'He said that all over this
country, in every hamlet, village and
town, young men were attaining their ma
jority who were full of vigor and enthu
siasm for tbe grand principles of the Re
publican party. "The young men of to
day," he said, "should be proud that they
have the opportunity of working and vot
ing for a man who, as a young man of 18,
shouldered a musket and went forth to his
country's defense.
"When his country needed him he was
not found wanting, and now, when he ap
pears before bis country asking for the
suffrage of his fellow-citizens, they should
be proud to honor him. *
He spoke warmly in favor of the McKin
ley bill. Referring to the Democratic ad-
ministration he said: "They have "been
experimenting with the bread and butter
of 60,000,000 people, and all they have suc
ceeded in doing is to put a little more cake
upon the delicacy-ladened tables of ' the
plutocrats."
Both speakers were very warmly ap
plauded. Several ~ impromptu speeches
were made by members of the club.
Arrangements were made to turn out
next Saturday night 150 strong. The Pre
sidio band will head the club. Thomas W.
Roulette will act as marshall.
PACIFIC KENNEL CLUB.
Old Officer* He-Elected at Last Night's
Annual Meeting.
The Pacific Kennel Club held the ad
journed annual meeting in the Occidental
Hotel last evening. Eight members were
present and twelve persons in all were in
the room. s :<~;vv'Â» -
The antagonism to the administration
of the club that some anticipated did not
appear. The old officers were re-elected
and the slate went through unbroken.
The officers elected were : H. Bier, presi
dent ; E. . H. Wakeman, first vice-presi
dent; Herbert Spencer, second .vice-presi
dent; C. A. Haight, financial secretary and
treasurer; Horace W. Orear, recording
secretary T. J. Wattson, delegate to Pa
cific Advisory Board.
Votes of thanks were returned to the last
bench show committee, to Superintendent
E. H. Williams for bis labor in making
the show a success and to A. R. Crowell
for valuable assistance.
The following committee was appointed
to revise the constitution and by-laws and
report at tbe next monthly meeting: E.
H. Wakeman, T. J. Wattson, H. Golcher,
C. A. Haight and Sim Mack.
The report of the financial secretary
and treasurer showed that there was over
$373 in the treasury and that the club's as
sets amounted to $1000 over its liabilities,
which were small.
About fifteen members were dropped
for non-payment of dues. .
"KEEP LOPPING TAXES."
How a Single- Taxer Would Im-
prove Industrial Con-
ditions.
James S. Reynolds Talks to the Mem-
bers of the Good Samaritan
Mission.
James S. Reynolds spoke at the Good
Samaritan Mission, 249 Second street, last
evening on ' the "Single Tax.". The talk
was an informal one and was listened to
with interest by a number of men who are
in the habit of ' gathering at the rooms of
the mission every evening. Rev. W. I.
Kip, who is' in charge of the mission, in-
troduced the speaker, saying that Mr.
Reynolds could tell them much of a re-
form that would interest both those who
had deep pockets and those who had no
pockets at all. In the course of his talk
Mr. Reynolds said:
"Never before has there been so much
wealth and at the same time so much pov
erty. It follows, therefore, that never be-
sore has there been such need for mea
sures to abolish poverty. It is not neces
sary, for me to say-that there is something
wrong. You have ocular demonstration
of actual want and the brutalizing fear of
want. Why is there such want? Can we
suppose that a Divine Creator has ordained
it? It is blasphemy to say so. Nor is it
through individual faults and failings, for
poverty overtakes all classes. . Tne trou
ble is an institution in this country main-
tamed by law.'
"I do not pretend 'to say that intemper
ance and other vices do not cause poverty.
Intemperance jis often a cause of distress,
but it is not the cause of the present wide-
spread destitution. But lam to speak of
the single tax, which you doubtless would
rather bear about than poverty.
"Everybody knows that the rental value
of any piece of land is just in proportion to
the capacity of that piece of land to pro-
duce wealth by the â  application of human
labor to it. And hence there is an infinite
variety of such values in the form of rentÂ»-
ground rent, not rent in its popular mean-
ing of rent from improvements.
"This is a fundamental fact and one so
simple thatevery man should see it merely j
by opening his eyes. Now the single -tax
proposes to take the ground rent for the I
purposes of society and to leave to each â¢
man untouched the fruit of his labor.
. "Every public improvement increases
land values. Then why not take one for
the other? If the 'ground rent from land
values is sufficient for public , improve-
ments, why tax men further to pay for the
improvements? .â¢'"".
"These facts show in a rambling way
what is the matter. ' The trouble is that
we have gone wrong. All that: is neces
sary to reform matters is to repeal some of
our laws, and ; things will reform them-
selves. The constitution of this State de
clares that everything must he taxed.l The
only way for us to attain our end is to lop
off one tax after another. As the : number
of taxes decreases the amount on those left.
is increased: \ Continue this . process "of
lopping off the taxes until none but a
single tax upon land values. is left, and the
end which we seek is thus realized."

HUGH CRAIG,
President San Francisco Chamber of

The above was sent yesterday in reply
to the following:
President of Chamber of Commerce, San Fran
cisco: Kindly send at our expense your opin
ion of St. Louis financial plank and President
Cleveland's statement New York Herald.
The statement referred to was as follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 17.â Presi-
dent Cleveland to-day made the following
rÂ°ply to a representative of the New York
Herald, who asked of -the President a
statement concerning the Democratic situ-
ation: Mr. Cleveland said: "I have made
no figures as to the probable action of del-
egates already chosen, or to be chosen, to
the Democratic National Convention, but
I refuse to believe that when the time
arrives for deliberate action there will be
engrafted upon our Democratic creed a
demand for the free,' unlimited and inde
pendent coinage of silver. â¢
"I cannot believe this, because I know
the Democratic party is- neither unpatri-
otic nor foolish, and because it seems clear
to me that such a course will inflict a very
great injury upon every interest of our
country which it has been the mission of
Democracy to advance and will result in
strong disaster to our party organization.
There is great hope that as a means of suc
cess this free silver proposition, after its
thorough discussion during a political
| campaign will attract a majority
jof the voters of : the , country.
It must be that many of the
illusions influencing those now relying
upon this alleged panacea . for their ills
will be dispelled before the time comes for
them to cast their ballots, which will ex
press their sober second thought. The
adoption by the Democracy of this propo- ;
sition would, I belieye, give to our oppo
nents an ad vantage, both ., in the present
and future which they do not deserve. 'y;
"My attachment to true Democracy is so
strong that I consider its work as identical
with the promotion "of the country's good.
This ought sufficiently to account for my
anxiety that no mistake be made at our
party convention.. .In my opinion no
effort should be spared to secure such ac
tion of the delegates as will avert party
demoralization. - â :'â ''â 
"It is a place for consultation and com-
parison of views and those Democrats who
believe in the. cause of sound money
should there be heard and ba constantly
in evidence. : A cause worth fighting ; for
is worth fighting for to the end: If sound
money Democrats suppose there is danger
of a mistake being made such danger
should stimulate their activity in averting
it instead of creating discouragement. ,
"I am very far from arrogating to my
self a controlling influence upon . the
policy of my party; but as an unflinching
Democrat who has been , honored by his
party and who desires hereafter no greater
political privileges than to occupy the
place of private in its ranks, I hope I may
not be blamed for saying thus much at
this time in the interest, as it seems to me,
of the grand old organization, so rich in
honorable traditions, so justly proud of its
achievements and always so undaunted
and brave in its battles for the people's
wel ware. _______________

POCATELLO POLITICS BOILING.
Two' City Officials Fight and an Innocent
Policeman Is Wounded.
POCATELLO, Idaho. June 17.â About 9
o'clock last ' evening Chief of ' Police John
Ellis and County ; Commissioner Frank
Murphy quarreled r over political matters,
when Ellis' struck - Murphy twice on" the
head with a heavy cane, cutting his scalp
badly. His cane then missed its mark and
went through a large plate-glass window
or Kellett & Cleveland's saloon, shivering
it to atoms. Murphy also had a cane and
knocked Ellis down, cutting him badly on
the head. By this time both were bleed
ing profusely. Ellis ; started to arise and
Murphy knocked :; him- down again. Ellis
then drew his revolver and fired at Mur
phy, but the bullet missed its intendedl vic
tim ; and â¢ struck Policeman â¢ McDaniels , in
the ;* left 1 shoulder, making a f; bad : flesh
wound and knocking him down. Friends
then interfered and separated the combat-
i i ii i i mi lin nnii'm iiiummilfl
ants. The street was . lined with people
and everybody fled when the shooting be
gan. y. The wounded men were all taken to
their homes. . . 'â 
: There has been trouble brewing between
Murphy and Ellis for some time. They
are both aspiring to the office of Sheriff,
and it is claimed Murphy was chagrined
upon not receiving more recognition
among Democrats at the convention yes-.
terday. McDaniels was , only slightly
wounded in the left shoulder and Ellis is
able to be out, although badly cut on the
scalp.

THE OLYMPIC CLUB TEAM
Runners and Jumpers Who Will
Invade Portland Next
Week.
Captain .Gill Says That the Multnomah
Club Must Look to Its
Laurels.
Portland, Or., is to be invaded by a small
army of athletes. '[â :/':.-',:-
â¢ Leonard Gill, the captain of the Olympic
athletes, has selected a first-class team of
runners, jumpers, weight-putters, etc.,
the members of which are now in splendid
condition.'
Gill is truly a happy man. He said last
evening that although his team was com
posed of only a handful of athletes he ex
pected to astonish the big guns of the
Multnomah Athletic Club in field and
track events.
â  "I know there are some really good men
in the north," said the handsome little
captain of the Olympics, "but they, must
be first-class to hold a candle with our
men. Here is Phil Wand, who can spike a
100-yard sprint in -10}Â£ seconds, and who
can do 220 in 23% with an inch or two up
his sleeve in case he may be pressed.
'Then there is F. R. Butz, a good strong
runner, who wifl surely do the 100 in 10%,
and who can fly over 21 feet of earth witn
ease. Bert Coffin is a Joe Dandy middle
distance runner. . Bert can go the half in
2 minute s'6-5 seconds, and if the day and
track are good he should negotiate
the quarter in 51 seconds. What's the
matter with that? '
"W. C. Patterson is our high jumper. He
has a' record of 5 feet 11% inches, but I
understand they have a sky jumper named
Kerrigan in Portland who can fly. over a
6-foot bar. Possibly Patterson may loosen
up in the warm climate of the North and
tie the great Kerrigan; at least I hope so.
Patterson is also a first-class hurdler, and
it will take a pretty speedy sprinter to
show 'Patt' his spikes from , start f to
finish. J" -.',â¢
"You can safely say that -little. Dave
Brown of Stanford, who is an old member
of the Olympic, will walk away with his
opponents in the mile and the half-mile
races:-. â¢ "; â  â¢â  â  . .
"Edgren will certainly win the hammer
throw, and I. will do my best to lower the
colors of my opponents in the sprints."
Gill said this with a smile.
The Olympic team will leave this City
for Portland on Monday evening. The
fames in which they will compete will be
eld in the Portland Athletic grounds on
Saturday the 27th inst., under the auspices
of the Multnomah Athletic Club, ".' â¢â¢";', _-:~ y

In Leading Grammar . and Primary
Schools Yesterdayâ A Tired
Superintendent.
Patriotism boiled and bubbled yesterday
in the public schools of San Francisco. In
the hearts of teachers, children and par
ents it burned with an intensity excelling,
if possible, that of the preceding days of
the week. Flags were flying from a score
of schoolhouses and in the classrooms
hundreds of yonng hands were raised in
sincere and loyal salutation to "Old
Glory" and the freedom and independence
of which it is emblematic.
Closing exercises were held in several of
the leading grammar schools, and in all
instances everything went as merry as a
marriage bell. Superintendent Babcock,
Deputy Superintendent Stone and Di
rector Murdock, chairman of the classifi
cation committee of the Board of Educa
tion, were kept busy all day running from
one school to another, presenting diplomas
and distributing medals to the happy
graduates, conferring with principals and
presiding at exercises. Superintendent
Babcock went to bed last evening imme
diately after dinner.
He was completely fagged out, and de
clares that during vacation he will learn
to ride a wheel, so as to be prepared to get
around speedily at the close of another
term.
With one^xception the. exercises of yes
terday took place at the respective school
houses, which were tastefully and appro
priately decorated by the teachers and
pupils. , Pursuant to custom the graduates
or the primary and grammar schools are
dismissed upon receiving their diplomas,
the pupils of the lower classes being de
tained until ! the hour for the final closing
to-morrow afternoon.
The Denman Grammar, exclusively a
school for girls, held its graduating exer
cises at 1 p. m. yesterday, in the auditorium
of the Girls' High School. Following is
the programme:
Class song, "Battle Hymn of the Republic;"
salutatory, Emma Nowbray; class song, "Waltz
of the Blackberry Gatherers"; distribution of
medals by Principal A. L. Mann; class song,
"Voices of the Woods"; valedictory, Maud
Muller; class song, "The Merry Farmer Boy"
distribution of diplomas by Deputy Superin
tendent Stone; class song, "America."
The class songs weie particularly pleas
ing, the voices of the young girls posses
sing great sweetness and freshness. Miss
Mowbray's salutatory and Miss Muller's
valedictory were timely and well written,
and not, as is often the case, too long.
Azro L. Mann, who was once Superinten
dent, is the principal of this school, which
is named in honor of James Denman, the
veteran educator who presided over it for
many years. Following is the list of grad

HIS AMMUNITION TXHATJSTED.
Argument for the Plaintiffs Comes
to a Sudden and Unexpected
Termination.
Termination.
The plaintiffs in the Noe suit had their
grist ground exceeding fine yesterday.
Their champion with the elongated name
sent their contention through the, mill'
time and time again, and the soothing
sound of Mr. Koscialowski's voice lulled ]
the opposing counsel into peacsfnl slum-
ber. The Deputy Sheriff found refuge in
a newspaper and his Honor, who admitted
that he bad to listen because he was paid
for it, rubbed his eyes and Kept awake.
The associate counsel for the Noes was un-
der no obligation to listen. Splivalo dozed
while Koseialowski talked on.
He opened his remarks at the forenoon
session by briefly reviewing his argument
of the day before. This consisted of a more
or less general statement of the Mexican
law in regard to community property.
Continuing he said:
"We have seen by the old laws that
while a grant or donation may be made to
the husband or bead of the family, yet it
was not to be considered as his separate
property."
Then he again reviewed the objects of
the colonization act under which this
giant was made. He proceeded to analyze
and discriminate between the words used
in the act with a nice particularity, the ob-
ject being to prove that the act was made
with a view of investing the property in
the head of a family for the benefit of the
family. After the speaker bad gone over
this ground half a dozen times bis Honor
evidently grew weary.
"1 think, Mr. Koseialowski," said the
j court, "there is no dispute abou the in-
tent of the Mexican Government \o grant
the land for the benefit of the man's fam
ily. The only question is in whom was
the title vested? In this case it is admit-
ted the title was vested in Noe, so all we
need to discuss is his right to convey."
Lane suggested that his .Honor be not
misled into the belief that because Noe
petitioned for the property for himself and
family, this fact in any degree invested it
in the will.
His Honor said he understood that the
intention of the Mexican Government in
making the grant was not of particular
importance. ; The question before the
court was: What have the California
courts held to be the effect of such a
grant?
Lane said they had decisions to show
that such a grant was not bela to invest
any community interest, but was merely
th 6 separate estate of the grantee.
This. statement of the court virtually
went to the essence of much of the conten
tion. A large part of Koscialowski's argu
ment was to the effect that the intention
of the Mexican Government was to grant i
this property for the benefit of the family, |
and his argument was directed toward
proving this intention. -
Koseialowski then entered into a dis- '
cussion of cases which he held supported j
bis position. The attorneys for the de- !
fendants failed to agree with him on the I
application of the cases, as well as on the I
facts and law set fortn in them, and they j
frequently interrupted with correction?.
The case of Noe vs. Carr, decided in 1860, |
in which the facts were very similar to I
those in the present case and in which Noe |
was defeated, was cited to shew that there |
were three, classes of donations under the I
Mexican law, and the grant now under !
consideration .. could not possibly be i
Wrought within any of them. The ob-
ject of this argument was to show that,
the grant not being a gift, would not even
under the community law as now under
j stood in California be separate property. '
Lane again interrupted at this point to \
ask a question. Mr. Kocialowski showed i
some impatience at the interruption. "If '
your Honor will prevent these frivolous
interpositions," he said, "I will promise
the gentlemen that I will finish at least by
to-morrow night, or perhaps by to-mor-
row noon.-' â
The assembled attorneys looked blank
at this. "Do I understand," asked Mtil-
laney, "that at the best this argument will
not be completed before to-morrow noon?
If so we ought to know it so :we can go
away until it is aver."
Van Duzer suggested that some limit
should be put on the plaintiffs, or at least
that they be restricted to the discussion of
material points.
"I intend to allow Mr. Koseialowski to
maite this argument in his own way," said
the Judge. "If you gentlemen don't want
to listen to it, there is nothing to prevent
your going away. I am : paid to listen
to it."
, "That's so," said . Mullaney, as he
reached for his hat. A number of the de-
fendants' counsel went out with him.
Koseialowski then proceeded to draw
the fine distinctions between the different
classes of Mexican donations. From a
scholastic point of view it was doubtless in-
teresting, but " the attorneys ] were un-
appreciative. Judge McKinstry listened
with a pained expression upon his face.
The venerable jurist was evidently trying
to grasp the full purport of the niceties of
Mexican law to which the court was be-
ing treated. As :he listened the unrest
upon his countenance became more cvi-
dent. Then, with a sigh, he gave up the
task and .joined the majority, who were
now outside.
Mr. Koseialowski stated that he had de-
voted a great deal of research to the study
of these distinctions and of the Mexican
community law in general. He declared
that the Supreme Court, in some of its de-
cisions, evidently had not fully considered
the early law upon which these grants
were founded and so they should not be
taken as authority in ; this case.' â¢ ,
Then he delved still deeper into the com-
munity laws of Mexico. He cited Spanish
and civil law writers extensively to show
that the interest of husband and wife was
.&; partnership interest, and .all property
acquired by either was to go into the com
mon fund, except in certain specified cases
which he had enumerated.
;'.'. At 12:30 an adjournment was taken until
2 o'clock, when' plaintiffs' attorney re
sumed his argument. Only two or three
of the defendants' attorneys returned after
lunch, and y Mr. Koseialowski was allowed
to proceed without interruption. ;
/ His . main "efforts during the afternoon
were directed toward the proposition that
at general law. "where the community
theory is in vogue, any property acquired
by either party during coverture is pre
sumed to ;be community property, and
the onus is on those claiming it as sepa
rate property to prove it. He also directed
some attention to the proposition that at
Mexican law the husband, upon the death
of the wife, held her property, in trust for
the children, and he and those claiming
under him could be made to account for
the trust property. "<{"*]<yy-]v>v'
.After about an hour of the afternoon
session had been consumed Koseialowski
began to give evidence of . having ex
hausted his arsenal. '. After fumbling
about his books : for a few minutes he
started to again exploit the colonization
laws of 1824 and 1828. â¢Judge' Sanderson
called his attention to the fact that this
ground had all been gone over a number
of times. .â¢'.. y .- â  â . -WVvsV &;>'*.?
Koseialowski said he merely wished to
resume, but Judge Sanderson didn't wish
any resume. The attorney then said their
contention was, that Noe had no right to
convey the land.
"I understand your contention: per
fectly," said his Honor, and the plaintiffs
rested. J'..' .''"';]": ,v â¢'
' ; This case has all along had a habit of
reaching climaxes at unexpected moments,
and Koscialowski's closing, two hours
alter he had announced he would require
six hours more, was not the least surpris
ing. Judge Sanderson asked Franklin K.
Lane to proceed for the defense, but Mr.
Lane had expected at least another day to
prepare and 'had not his reports properly
marshaled for the fray. He requested
that the case go over, and as Mr. Koseia
lowski also expressed some weariness, the
Judge consented.
He stated that to-day bo would hear Mr.
Lane, who promised to finish in two hours,
and Judge McKinstry, who desired only
about twenty minutes. . Other "attorneys,
who wish to make supplemental argu
ment, he said, must do so on briefs to be
served on Mr. Koseialowski. The latter
would then be allowed to answer.
FOR A LOWER TAX LEVY.
Supervisors in General Believe
That the Rate Is Too
High. ,
No Desire to Cripple Any of the City
Departments by Too S'rict
Economy. â¢
With the majority of the Board , of Su
| pervisors there is a desire for a lower rate
! of taxation, and they believe. that the.city
I government can be carried on successfully
| if good business judgment is used in the
handling and disbursement of the public
funds. -
Supervisor A. B. Spreckels, when seen
yesterday afternoon regarding the tax
levy, expressed himself as being in for
economy. He considered the present rate
entirely too high, and was of the impres
sion that for practical purposes, with the
same care and economy as is pursued by
business men in distributing their funds
for the absolute necessities incurred in
carrying on their business $1 0-5 on the
$100 taxation should be amply sufficient to
carry on the city government.
He expressed himself as being decidedly
opposed to extravagance .in the distribu
tion of the people's money, y Not one dol
lar should be paid out for any purpose
other than the legitimate expenditure
necessary) and for material, labor and
work performed. If this had been prac
ticed the levy would and could be made
j to meet all just demands at . the rate of
i $1 05, and this rate he would not be in-
clined to go above. .
Supervisor Joseph King said: y
"lam in favor of any rate :of taxation
| that will be sufficient to support the gov
| ernment properly, if it is 25 cents. The
â¢ rate ought to be less than last year and I
] think it will be. I think our merchants
I and business men ought to be paid the
j amount we owe them. I. am always on
I the side of improvements. No, there is
! no particular improvement that I want to
see made, except that I think our streets
ought to be kept up and the buildings in
I good condition."
Supervisor Hirsch is also in favor of a re
i duction, and while not in the dollar-limit
j ranks, he believes mat the present $2 25
I rate should be cut down at least one-third.
He thinks that this can be done without
crippling the City. Mr. Hirsch stated last
evening that he was willing to go as low as
$1 07 or $1 08 on the $100, but no lower. In
discussing the situation he. said:
"We will have to cut down the park con-
siderably below the . Commissioners' de
-1 sires. They are asking for- $25,000 or
! $30,000 more than. they had before, and
' .while I don't wish to cripple the park, 1
don't see how we can do it. ' We do not de-
sire to cripple any department, but we
must make a reduction."
A GOOD SHOWING.
Depositors of the Grangers' Bank to
gjtey'fijj Get Their Money.
When the Grangers' Bank closed
doors on the nth of last January it had,
in round figures, about $250,000 of money
due to its depositors. ; The bank had a
capital of $1,000,030 paid up, besides a
very comfortable surplus, and its suspen
sion was quite unexpected, and created a
good deal of consternation in mercantile
circles. The failure was owing to bad
management, immense sums having been
loaned on growing crops and upon lands
in the interior. Over-advances upon grain
explained where much %of the .bank's
money had gone, and for a time it looked
as though the failure would be a disas
trous one. The bank examiners, after a
close examination of the assets, struck off
at one lick no less than $650,000, leaving
$600,000 assets of ; all kinds in which to pay
the depositors and reimburse the million
paid in by the stockholders. A. Muentei
was given control on the 14th of January,
and yesterday made \ a statement of the
condition of the bank. 'â  It appears that of
the quarter of a million owed to the de
positors over 50 per cent has been paid,
leaving the liabilities at the present time
about $120,000. The bank has assets of a
face value of $338,000 â  and over, and Mr.
M neuter i estimates that within the next
four months all current liabilities will be
paid and a balance of $200,000, or. $20 a
share, be r available to distribute among
the 1 stockholders. ~y Vigorous ;; efforts < are
being made to realize upon the assets, and
in most instances the property upon
which loans have been made has been as
signed to the bank, and upon this collat
eral enough has been promised to pay all
depositors and yto practically close the
bank's affairs. :

of Oakland Makes an '
Impression.
THE CASE OF HENRY BEHNKE.
His Charge Against Conductor Henry
and Motorman Mahoney Dis-
missed by Campbell.
There was a deeply interested and
amused crowd in Judge Campbell's court-
room yesterday afternoon at the hearing
of the case against Robert Henry, con
ductor, and Patrick B. Mahoney, motor
man, of a Kearny-street electric car,.
charged with assault with a deadly weapon.
The . complaining witness was Henry
Behnke, 14 Guy place.
The interest of the spectators did not
center in the merits of the case, but in the
attorney who appeared as special prosecu-
tor. His actions were so opposed to the
usual traditions of the Police Court that
every one whispered to his neighbor the
question, "Who is he?" ;
No one seemed to know, not even Attor
ney Kelly who appeared for the Market-
street Cable Company, nor Attorney Clar
ence Gray, who thought he knew every at-
torney that had appeared in the Police
Court for years bacK.
Finally a late comer bowed to the prose
| cuting attorney, and he was immediately
j asked the same question. "Why," he
I said, "don't you know him" That is Alex
! ander Laidlaw, who, when Police Judge in i
| Oakland, fined himself $50 for- bting
drunk." The answer was passed from
mouth to mouth and it intensified the in
terest of the spectators. ' . -fc.
The favorite position of ex-Judge Laid
law was to 101 l back in his chair and place
bis left foot on the table in front of him.
He and the court locked horns repeatedly
over the res gesta and the rules of evidence
till finally Judge Campbell told- him that
I his arguments might hold good in an Oak
-1 land court, but they j were irrelevant and
! useless in a San Francisco court. Once he
; objected to a question put by the Judge to
: the defendant Mahoney, and the Judge
j mildly told him that he must remember
i that Mahoney was the defendant and the
I question was a proper one. Ludlnw pon
j dered deeply for a moment and then
: said : "I guess you are right ; he is the de
fendant." . j;;,.'. : -â¢
One of the witnesses for the defense was
Ben S. Broas, an old | gentleman living at
512 Bush street, who is representative here
of a nrm in Flushing, N. Y. t After he had
I given his testimony, Laidlaw in loud
; tones denounced him a3 a liar. ' The Judge
sharply told him he had no right to talk
i that way to a witness, and he would â  not
I tolerate it for a moment.
-,"You have no right," said the- Judge,
'.'to use language to a man. in court that
you would not dare use to his face outside
the courtroom. I will protect th* witness
against such lant:ua,ie."
''Well, your Honor," said Laidlaw, "I
\ apologize to the court, but allow me to
say that the witness uses the truth with
| penurious frugality," which - raised a
! laugh. â¢
A. L. McDonald, a writer living at the
| Reno House, â¢ Sacramento street, was the
\ next witness for the defense. He is a well
j built man. and as lie passed Laidiaw he
! whispered to him: "You; had better not
call me a liar," and the_ remark was ac
! companied by a look that meant business.
Laidlaw did not call McDonaM a liar, but
he said he also used the truth with penuri
ous frugality.
There were other incidents, such as cor- j
recting the grammar of the witnesses and i
interjecting remarks while the Judge was |
delivering his decision. The Judge
checked him several times and finally
threatened to. commit' him for contempt
unless he held his tongue.
Behnke, the complaining witness, de-
tailed the alleged ; assault upon him on
June 10. He got a transfer from a Market-
street car ; to the Kearny-street. car, and
when he banded it to Conductor Henry
near Bush street he refused to accept it,
as it was only good for going south. Then
! Henry and the motorman forcibly ejected
him from the car. He got on again and
the motorman beat him over the hands
with the controller-handle, while the con
ductor grasped him by the throat. Fin-
ally the motorman hit him on the breast
with the controller-handle and be fell to
the ground, the conductor on top of him. :
He was knocked senseless. - â ]
Charles McCarthy, plumber, 1704 Leav-
enworth, street, corroborated Behnke and
said he instructed Policeman Engel to
arrest the conductor for battery. Dr. P.
F. Lord also gave corroborative testi
mony, and said when the motorman
struck Behnke over the heart with trie
controller handle he dropped like an ox.
For the defense Charles M. E wing, col-
lector for the Evening Post, testified that
be saw the whole fracas and he did not
see any instrument "* in y the motorman's
hands, neither did he see the motorman
strike Behnke with any instrument.
Ex-Judge Laidlaw wanted to show, by
the "witness the connection of the Post
with M. H. de Young, whom he styled the
unpposititious candidate for Vice-President
and the y Southern Paciric, but Attorney
Kelly interposed an objection and it was
sustained. . ~ â¢'
Ben S. Broas and A. L. McDonald both
testified that they did not see tbe motor-
man strike Behnke with the controller
handle,' on the contrary they saw the
motorman put it in the lefthand pocket of
his coat. v;
Conductor Henry and Motorman Ma-,
; honey gave their evidence, and .denied
using more than the necessary force to
eject Behnke from the car. Mahoney de
nied striking Behnke with the controller
handle. y He took - the handle ; off in ac
cordance with the rules of.' tire : company,
and put it in his pocket when be ' went to
the conductor's assistance. A copy of the;
company's : rules : was put ;in evidence.
iceman Engel also testified. â¢
The Judge said the conductor was act-
ing within his rights in refusing to accept
the transfer from Behnke and when
Behnke refused to leave the car the con
ductor was justified in ejecting him and
using all necessary force to do so.',
"When conductors are in the right,"
said the Judge, "they will have the sup
port of this court regardless of the howl
ing mob or the press."
â *â¢â 'â  He held there was not sufficient evidence
to show that there had been an assault
with y a deadly weapon and he therefore
dismissed the case and discharged the de
fendants. -L ".'.. j _____
PLACING THE CHARTER.
The Merchants Want It at the Head
of the Ballots.
Several days ago the officials of the
Merchants' Association wrote to the Elec
tion Commissioners and the Registrar of
Voters stating that in order to have as
complete a vote as possible upon the
adoption of the new charter that this sub
ject be placed at the head of the muni
cipal election ballots. The idea in this is
that the voters give the greatest attention
to such offices and subjects as are given
the first places on the ticket. yÂ»
A committee was appointed to see the
commissioners and secure this concession
if possible. . '
Registrar Hinton yesterday sent an
answer to the letter. After stating thai
the board had considered the matter he
said:
The question whether or not the Board of
Election Commissioners has any right to ar
range the ticket was raised. Pending legal in
vestigation the matter was made the special
order for Monday, June 22, 1896, at 10 A. M-,
and the Registrar was instructed to notify you
that your committee is invited to be present
at that time. '
â¢ The association will have its full com
mittee present when the subject is taken
up.
Forty-Fourth Republican*.
At a meeting of the Forty-fourth District Re
publican Club, held at their clubrooms June
15, it was unanimously resolved that the club
participate in the ratification meeting to be
held next Saturday night. The club appointed
J. C. Kimball, S. C. Jones, H. Lethman, A.
Sjogran ana E. Mosbacher a committee on
finance. I. E Jarrett, Dr. W. D. (lark, \V. W.
Cross, James Meatus and Robert Munch were
appointed a committee on arrangements. The
club appointed Captain F. Hanson marshal.

SOME UNIQUE LAWS.
The Ratio of Divorce There to

NOT SO MANY IDIOTS EITHER.
Punishment to Fit the Crimes of
Womenâ Facts and Figures From
the Records of Wyoming.
Miss Elizabeth Yates, now in this City,
and other champions of woman suffrage,
"point with pride," in the same dramatic
manner as the masculine political orator,
to Wyoming as a beautiful illustration of
the practical working and success of en-
franchisement for women. They point to
that State, with its twenty-seven . years of
equal suffrage of the sexes, as an example
for California to follow and as a shining
refutation of claims, all and various, that
the home is woman's only sphere. They
assert tnat it settles the question of
whether men shaU go into the kitchen and
wash dishes, whether family ties and the
home are broken up and the lodging
house and restaurant increase and multi
ply, whether woman cannot be a woman
and mother still with the additional re
sponsiDility of the ballot. According to
statistics and the last school census the
earth in Wyoming is being plentifully re
plenished. . â¢-- .'..', C^'^Z
Miss Yates is from Maine. She is one
of almost a host of handsome champions
of the ballot for women, who have been
sent into California by the National
Woman's Suffrage League. She is splen
didly equipped for the work. Her dart
beauty indicates tbat she is capable of
putting plenty of fervor into it. The
speech which Miss Yates delivered last
Sunday night before the Socialistic Labor
party, a report of which occasion appeared
in the next morning's Call, was more than
half a classic, in its correct style and its
fitting and finished metaphor. In the
speech she pointed to "Wyoming as the
shining light of the equal enfranchisement
of men and women. She said :
"Wyoming in its purer homes, purer
social relations and purer politics, tells a
beautiful story of the success of woman's
suffrage. It is a proof twenty-seven years
old. When the time came for the Terri
tory of Wyoming to be admitted to the
union of States, the men of Wyoming
notified Congress that they preferred to re
main a Territory for ninety-nine years
than to be admitted to Statehood without
suffrage for woman. They had tried,
while a Territory, and found to be a suc
cess." â¢ ' "cyjvi
Miss Gates has some interesting facts
and figures which show the effect of
woman's suffrage on divorce. They indi
cate that marriage, at least in Wyoming.
is not so much of a failure as in other
States, and that unhappy marriages are
more bearable. One of the great problems
of the day is how to maintain the sacred
institution of the home, and Miss Yates
says that Wyoming's experience shows
one way of approaching its solution.
"Wyoming shields more the marriage of
its daughters than any other Western
State, requiring parental consent for the
marriage of any girl under 21 years of
age."
Another woman, who does same clerical
wcrk for one of the roost prominent
woman-suffrage workers in the State, who |
is now absent from tbe City, gave the fol-
lowing facts and figures on divorce in
Woming:
"The average duration of marriage be-
fore divorce, where persons have been mar
ried 21 years or over, is considerably longer"
in Wyoming than In the average of West-
crn States and In the average of the whole
United States, showing that the married
condition of even the unhappily mated is
more bearable than elsewhere. The per
cent of divorce granted to wives in the
United States is very much larger than to
husbands, while in Wyoming the differ-
ence is much smaller than the average,
and it must, certainly be for the safety of
domestic relations that the bonds should
be as bearable to one sex as to the other.
This, certainly, is a point in favor of
woman's equality before the law.
"In tbe United States," she continued,
"the estimated number of married couples
to one divorce was 664 in 1870 and 481 in
1880, the number of divorced marriages in
the United States increasing 38 per cent.
In the Western group, the States, omit
ting Wyoming, which are beyond or partly
beyond the Rocky Mountains, the average
increase was .V) per cent. In -Nebraska,
Wyoming's neighbor, it was 79 per cent.
To take tbe statistics from two exception
ally law-abiding communities: In Michi
gan it was 50 cent; Minnesota, 55 per
cent, while in Wyoming the number of
divorced marriages had decreased 29 per
cent. â¢ . â¢ â¢
"To state the result in another way,"
she said, "divorces increased in the United
States from 1870 to 1880, 79.4 per cent,
nearly three tiroes the per cent of the in
crease of the population for the same
period, and in tbe group of Western States
that. l have described they have increased
376.3 per cent. Now, in Wyoming the in-
crease in divorce is 61.5 per cent, only one
half as large as the per cent of increase of
tbe population.
. "To state the matter, in terms that all
can remember," she said, "the. ratio of
divorce in Wyoming is to that of the whole
United Btat.es as 1 to 3, and to that of the
other States in the Western group as 1
to 4.
"Statistics show that, contrary to the
prevailing opinion, divorces are very
largely granted where the marriage was
celebrated, but of the few divorces ob-
tamed in Wyoming almost all are of
those married before going to that State,"
she went on. "So, while we can well con
ceive what' a shock it roust be to married
men immigrating to Wyoming to find
themselves for the first time in tbeir lives
forced to see at their firesides a legal and
political equal, it is a sigificant fact that
men to the manner born find this condi
tion conducive .to domestic happiness.
That the conditions of society where
women have political rights and privi
leges conduce to a tranquil state of mind
/and a high degree of intelligence is shown 1
by the statistics of insanity and idiocy, i
Wyoming being far below the average in j
these. Compare Wyoming 'with a typical
Eastern Stateâ Connecticut; where the j
latter has 1 insane person to every 363 of
the population, -Wyoming has but 1, to
every 1497. Nor is this wholly a differ
ence of East and West, for Idaho, its
neighbor, shows 1 to every 1029 insane.
The proportion of idiots is, in Connecticut.
1 to 616; Idaho, 1 to 1534, and Wyoming,
1 to 4336. Especially would voting seam
to increase the intelligence of women, for
in both Connecticut and Idaho there are
over seven-tenths as many female idiots as
there are male idiots, while in Wyoming
there are only four-tenths as many.
"A careful comparison of the laws of
Wyoming with those of other States shows
that they are exceptionally favorable and
just to women. ' They clearly define, as
do the laws of no other State, the different
offenses against the person of women,
making them dovetail and thus furnish
ing continued protection. It is a peniten
tiary offense for any person to exercise the
arts of the procurer over any. female under
18 years of age even with, her consent, or
over 18 years without it; and the statute
omits those usual words of limitation
which extend protection only to the virtu
ous, leaving exposed to the "tender
mercies of the wicked" those who are in
sorest need of the segis of the law.
"Seduction is in most States a civil
offense, laying the guilty party liable to
damages, and I find no other State that
makes the betrayal of a woman less than
21 years of age, under promise of mar
riage, a well-defined penitentiary offense.
Colorado, of this group of Western States,
comes the nearest to it, but this limits the
age of protection to 16 years.
"Wyoming stands alone in considering
the male and female habitues of houses of
prostitution as guilty of the same offense,
but the man receives a double punish
ment, being liable to a fine of $100 and im
prisonment for sixty days, while the
woman is liable only to a fine of $50 and
imprisonment for thirty days. These
figures are taken from the records of the
State and can be verified by any one,"
she concluded.
A SOCIALISTIC CRISIS.
Collectivist Gronlund Gives No-
tice That It Is Fast Ap
proaching.
Believes a Third Party Can Elect a
President Four Years Frcm
Now.
At the meeting of the Political Economy
Club held at 15 South Park last Tuesday
evening Laurence Gronlund made an
interesting address. He stated that there
was a widespread sentiment over the
whole land that the beginning of the
twentieth century would be the dawn of a
new era in social and industrial life.
"Capitalism," he said "is digging its
own grave and is preparing the way for
an era of socialism at the beginning of
the next century. On the continent of
Europe socialism ia a class movement,
and therein lies great danger. It is in
the power of educated people to prevent
the movement from taking this form of a
violent class struggle here, and the Politi
cal Economy Club and all intelligent
organizations should labor to this end
and strive to usher In a new era based
upon intelligent and mutual helpfulness
rather than upon passion and hate. .
"Socialism is perfected democracy," he
said. "It is democracy carried out on the
economic side. We are now living in this
country under a regime of industrial abso
lutismthe power being in the hands of
irresponsible monopoly. Instead of the
divine right of kings, we have now the
divine right of.property.
"There is a general misconception as to
the meaning of the word individualism.
Individualism exists now in the sense that
every one uses his property for his own
gain. Here the idea of self predominates,
which leads to selfishness and egoism. So
cialism or collectivism aims to fight such
individualism, but it is a common error to
suppose that socialism will also crush out
individuality.' Individuality of character
will be fostered under collectivismâ every
individual will have an open field and fair
play for the exhibition and development
of bis highest qualities of body, mind and
spirit.
"Socialism may be defined again as the
collective ownership of all capital and the
collective control of all industries. So
cialists do not desire to socialize all prop
erty, but only that part of property or
wealth which is used in production, i.e.,
capital, as machinery, factories, raw mate
rials and land.
"The educated classes," he continued,
"should be the leaders of the socialist or
collectivist movement in America. But
in Europe it is to be expected that there
shall be a violent revolution. Professor
Richard T. Ely takes the ground that
socialism may be achieved peacefully and
graduallyâ the first step is the socializa
tion of all public utilities, as water, gas,
telegraphs, telephones, railroads, etc."
A third party, Mr. Gronlund believes,
could win at the election four years from
now on a platform containing these three
planks: Government control of railroads
and telegraphs. Government banking, and
State productive work for the unemployed.
In conclusion Mr. Gronlund said that
the great necessity at present is to over
come the indifference of the intelligent,
educated class in regard to the approach
ing crisis which can be demonstrated to
be coming and to be close at hand. The
church and clergymen, especially, can, if
they will, prevent a violent outburst.
The opportunities presented to modern
society are "grand beyond historical pre
cedent."
In the discussion that followed the Rev.
W. 1. Kip made an interesting statement
as to what the church could and could not
do in relation to the movement, and out
lined the approaching crisis. The clergy,
he said, could not, without losing their
character as clergy, become advocates or
partisans of any movement or become the
representatives or champions of any class.
What they could do was to join and organ
ize social unions, into which any member
of society could enter. Here the clergy
could come together with other members
of society, take part in discussions, strive
to arouse indifference and to aid by moral
support.
DAY IS DIVORCED.
His Wire Allowed the Case to Go by
Default.
Osmond L. Day, the masher, who has
been so often arrested for vagrancy, was
yesterday granted a divorce from Annie
Day by Judge Sanderson. â
Osmond proved that Annie deserted
him, and, as Annie made no defense, the
decree was made.
She was, no doubt, so glad to get rid of
Omond that she would have quietly al
lowed almost any kind of a charge to have
gone by default.
Died From, Natural Causes.
A Coroner's jury yesterday returned a ver

Mayne Worrell, who died at the Palace Hotel
June (>. Dr. Whitney, who attended her, testi
fied that she died from angina pectoris. Dr.
Nathan, acting autopsy physician, held a sim
ilar opinion. An inquest was also held on the
bodies of John W. Hay and Orrick W. Marye,
a verdict of murder In the first and suicide in
the last-named case being returned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1896.
CONGRESS FORGOT
TOE NICARAGUA.
But the Chamber of Com-
merce Again Agitates
the Canal.
IN A STIRRING APPEAL.
Agriculture, Manufactures and
Commerce Demand a Cheap
Waterway.
PERSEVERANCE IS NECESSARY.
" With One Anticipated Exception, All
the Coast Delegation in Congress
Deserve Thanks."
j-Â»---~- ... , ..â¢â¢â â :â¢-...
The following address to the commer
cial bodies ana public ot the Pacific Coast
was issued yesterday by the Chamber of
Commerce:
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF BAN FRANCISCO.
To the Commercial Organizations and Our Fel-
low-Citizem of the Pacific . Coastâ Gentlemen :
Congress has again adjourned without enact-
ing the legislation insuring the construction
of the Nicaragua canal, although with a favor-
able report from the Committees on Commerce
of both houses.
The natural feeling of resentment at the
neglect of a great public beneficence because
it has not the propulsion of private Interest,
must not permit us to abate our exertions and
demands for favorable action during the last
session of the Fifty-fourtn Congress. We have
| five months for active propaganda, and a.gen
i eral' election in which to press our demands.
j We are not restricted In our efforts by mercan
' tile interests alone; our producers are suffer-
ing so keenly for cheap, short transportation
by water to the markets where nearly all our
products are disposed of, that we are assured
of their active sympathy and aid, while the
necessity of the canal from a National stand-
point is more apparent every year.
Our National prosperity, influence and safety
so largely depend upon the control of the
Nicaragua Canal by the United States Govern
! ment, jointly with our sister Republic of
{ Nicaragua, that on this ground alone the canal
j will finally overcome all opponents. We have
! powerful friends in the Gulf and Mississippi
j Valley States, while the Atlantic Coast is with
us on account of the great impetus the canal
| will give to American shipping. Even the in
! land transportation corporations that have
j opposed us are gradually recognizing that the
i canal is a beneficent work which will injure
! no vested interest, but will increase their
. traffic. We have no doubt of the great future
i in store for the port of San Francisco, but it is i
| at this time in sore need of this aid to its pros- I
perity. Why, then, should we Idly fold our
arms and forget that "God helps those who
| help themselves?" .
; With one anticipated exception all the Pa
! cific Coast delegation in Congress deserve our
! thanks. They have done all In their power to .
! aid us, and will do' so again when they return
to Congress. Let us then make this a cam- (
paign issue without regard to party. The can- |
didate who pledges himself to work for the
canal is our friend, and must be assured of our j
support. The candidate who ignores our cry j
for aid Is our enemy and deserves reprobation, j
Let every citizen on the Pacific I Coast write to
friends all over our broad land asking in the |
name of patriotism and as a proof of their per- j
sonal goodwill that they will urge their Sen-
ators and Representatives to demand legisla
tion which will secure us this urgent necessity
before the termination of the Fifty-fourth Con
i gress. Let the claims of relationship and old
associations, the mutual interests of business
intercourse, the loyalty which may properly
demand that one section of our, country shall
â¢ not call in vain upon another for aidâ all be
availed of to overcome the inertia of indiffer
ence which has made Congress ignore a great
National progressive enterprise which will be
specially the salvation of the Pacific Coast. In
vain may we look for radical improvement in
the possibility of political change. *
;> Opinions may honestly differ on questions
j of tariff and free silver, but we all know that
! the canal is the solution of the great question
| of cheap transportation for the products of the
i Pacific Coast. On this all parties can unite;
have.-in fact, already and repeatedly united
but failed us when the time for legislation ar
rived, because of the absence of selfish inter-
ests insisting on a fulfillment of party pledges.
And so we urge you in the name of our suf
fering farmers,, our stagnant industries, our
! hampered commerce to agitate, to demand
I and to never cease an insistanoe on such legis
lation as will secure "an American canal un
! der American control," for the benefit of our
people, under conditions which shall prevent
: discrimination and secure us a short, cheap
: waterway to the Atlantic. Therein, believe us,
jis the main solution of our prosperity. We
j urge your action in your own interest and for
the public welfare.
We respectfully request the public press to
t circulate this address and to aid our efforts
! with its powerful influence.

NO FRANCHISE AWARDED.
Judge, Hebbard's Peculiar De-
cision in the L. V. Merle
Case.
Sharon's Bid Could Not Be Ace pled
And Merle Withdrew His
Proposition.
The case of L. V. Merle vs. The Board of
Supervisors was yesterday decided by
Judge Hebbard. A writ 01 mandate 'was
asked by Merle to compel the Supervisors
to award him a garbage-collecting fran
chise on his bid of $5500, he claiming that
this was the highest bid made.
The Supervisors, however, saw fit 'to
accept a proposition submitted by F. E.
Sharon, who l offered ..the City: $2510 cash
and a percentage for the ; franchise. ... It is
-figured.- that the percentage will net the
City $350,000 during the fifty years it is to
run. y -*â¢-'?'..' â  -- - 'â â  .':.' >;':'./ ;
r Judge Hebbard decided that in awarding
the contract the Supervisors cannot con
sider the percentage portion of the Sharon
bid, and so of course Merle's bid is the
highest. Another portion of the decision
says, however, that Merle, by withdrawing
his certified check when - Sharon's bid was
accepted, also withdrew his bid.
By this decision it would j appear "Z that
neither, Sharon nor Merle has secured the
franchise, and that the whole matter will
have to be gone over again. Judge Heb
bard's decision is based on the (supreme
Court's decision of March , 17. 1896, in the
case of A. E. Thompson against the Super
visors of "Alameda* County, when a per
centage bid ; for an electric-railroad : fran
chise was ruled out.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V.. June 17.â After a firm
NEW rofiK, N. V.. June 17.â After a firm
opening, the stock market weakened slightly, the
leading Issues running off as much as a point In
some instances. The reaction was again the re
sult of profit taking. London and commission j
bouses being rather prominent sellers. The en
gagement of $400,000 gold shipment to Europe
seemed to dampen tbe ardor of the small bulls at
this time, notwithstanding an explanation which
followed the announcemen tof the shipment that
the transaction simply represented the closing up !
of an old ordef, and had no reference to political
conditions.
The offerings of stocks by London and local
commission houses were quickly absorbed, how- j
ever, and the market soon resumed its upward
course and prices advanced moderately all along
the line- The firmness prevailed until well into
the afternoon, when it was reported from st. Louis
that the platform will be very emphatic in espous
ing the cause of Cuba. In fact, it was said that the
convention would demand armed intervention by
the United States. This naturally caused uneasi
ness and some selling resulted.
The adjournment of the convention until 2
o'clock was also unfavorably construed in some i
quarters. When it was learned that the reports of j
the adoption of the platform, including the Cuban â 
plank, were premature the market rallied, and in '
the final hour of business the market was strong, |
the feeling was quite confident again. Tbe decla- |
ration of the usual dividends by the Vanderbilt I
roads and the statements submitted had a stimu- ,
la: ing influence, but the St. Louis convention com- ;
pletely overshadowed all other developments of j
the day. : ' â¢'.- -.:'â¢-'

Four Years. Get.ting .Wood.
Robert Winn, an old and eccentric char
acter, died at his; home on Hargis.Creek,
this county, yesterday. ,"- Uncle Bob,", as
he was familiarly called, lived to bury two
wives," and, not wishing to slight either,
on his dying ber' he asked that his re
mains be buried by the side of his faithful
old dog that . had but: a few days pre
ceded him. The request was granted. -
The death of "Uncle Bob" recalls an in
cident in his life that is decidedly out of
the ordinary. During tbe opening scenes
of the late Civil-War, "Uncle Bob" was
anxious to join k the Confederate Army.
His wife was opposed to his doing so, and
used every argument and effort within her
power -to 4 prevent i it. One .7 cold â¢ winter
morning, after f "Uncle Bob" -; had - aban
doned the idea, as' Mrs. Winn sup
posed; yof joining ; the }â  army, ' she asked
"Uncle Bob" to go? to! woodyard
andy gather some wood ; with 'which'
to ' r<"kindie . the fire. "Uncle y Bob"
started, but instead of -"gathering .wood
he walked to Mississippi and joined the
army, and for four long years fought for
the cause of the Confederacy. ; At the close
of the war he returned to the home he had
suddenly > deserted. v Entering by way of
the woodyard. he gathered '{ up ;an armful
of wood, and entering the room, he found
his faithful wife, who had continued to re
mam at the old home. Walking up to the
fireplace, he , carelessly threw down his
armful of wood, and looking into the face
of j his now dumfounded " wife coolly â¢ re
marked,' 'Here's your wood," after which
he proceeded â¢ to make himself at home
as.of yore.â Louisville Post. !.';

RUSH FOR WARRANTS.

Enemies. .
GAVIN HIGH DISAPPOINTED.
Though Served With Two Warrants
He Cannot Get Papers for
Others. ' , .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
808 Broadway, June 17. )
The , dull spell is broken. Oakland is
now enjoying high times, which state
ment is somewhat of a pun, but all of the
truth. Libel, politics and bribery* are the
warcries of the various camps, and while
the storm is raging those most interested
are wondering where the lightning will
strike next. A new element is added each
day and, like so many acids of different
natures, they have now reached the point
of ebullition and the public is enjoying
the show.
The first heavy gun was fired last night
when Gavin Dim, High was arrested on
two charges of criminal libel, preferred
against him by William J. DiDgee, presi
dent of the Oakland Water Company.
Mr. Dingee's comnlaint referred to pub
lications in Mr. High's paper, the Times,
and which reflected on Mr.' Dingee as a
real estate agent, and also on the methods
of' the company of which he is president.
After waiting what he considered a rea
sonable time to give Mr. High an oppor
tunity to retract, Mr. Dingee swore out two
warrants and Mr. High, after putting up
bonds, was released.
Then the editor came back with a griev
ance, In a published interview Mr. Dingee
inferred that he had been approached
come time ago and told that if he supplied
Mr. High with a new printing machine
and guaranteed a subsidy 0Â£5125 a month
Mr. High would be Mr. Dingee's "friend."
â¢ .Mr. High- indignantly denies that he I
ever dreamed that the donation of a print- >
ing machine was part of the legitimate j
business of a water - company. The editor j
published his view of . the case this morn- j
ing and said:
"Mr. High emphatically denies that he I
ever asked Mr. Dingee or anybody con- i
nected with his enterprises for a dollar or
any other consideration, but will affirm
under oath in court at the proper" time
that he had not been in the city more than
forty-eight hours when a politician in Mr.
Dingee's employ attempted to bribe him
to advocate Ah& sale of the plant of the . j
Oakland" Water "Company to the city of
Oakland. . Mr. High refused point blank
to be a party to the scheme to foist the
plant on the city and he was then threat
ened with all kinds of calamity unless he
'fell into line' and advocated the Dingee
plant, and it was that very refusal to be a
party to Mr. Dingee's pet scheme which
has caused the arrest of the editor."
This morning Mr. High : applied to the
-District Attorney for a warrant for the ar
rest of Mr. Dingee for criminal libel for
his reported reference to the printing
machine; he also wanted a warrant for W.
E. Dargie, who printed Mr. Dingee's inter
view. Frank Robinson, the editor of an-
other paper, also printed \ the interview,
and not contented with this he published
an editorial in which he said: 'â â 
"Mr. Dingee has been a liberal patron of j
the press. . It does not appear well for any j
one in this community to attempt even to
belittle his efforts, let 8 lone slur his char- j
acter. He has saved to the people of this j
city hundreds of thousands of dollars in '. j
water rates. by introducing a competitive I
system equal to any on the Pacific Coast.
These are the : men Oakland ought to aid i
and support in every way possible. The
pame offending paper seems to be the,
mouthpiece of a banking institution. As
a consequence the impression has gone
forth that the bank is responsible in a
measure for the policy of the paper." ,
For his share in the matter, Mr. High
also asked for a warrant for the arrest of
Mr. Robinson. The District Attorney did
not consider that he was justified in oblig
ing. High, and so no warrants were issued.
These are the fact 3 of the latest sensation
in this city, but they are simply like, the
covers of a book. They constitute merely
the title to a hundred untold stories and
-sidelights that are familiar to those on the
"inside," but which will, if the cases
against â¢ High go to trial, become public
property. The editor does hot believe the
prosecution will be pressed, but promises a
sensation if it should be.. Mr. Dingee de
clares that he will vindicate himself by
the law and intimates that he has a trump
card up his sleeve.
And Frank J. Moffitt, the assistant
manager of the Oakland Water Company,
says this is not his fight, but calmly awaits
developments. Truly there are "High
Times" in Oakland . /* .
POLICE CLERK SAFE.
â  Mayor Davie's Attempts to Remove
Gardner Are Failures.
OAKLAND, \ Cal., ;\ June , 17. â Mayor
Davie introduced a resolution at the meet-
ing of the Board of Police and Fire Com
missioners last evening declaring the posi
" tion of Police Clerk Gardner vacant, but
City Attorney Hiersol explained that the
' board had no power to carry out such an
order if it were passed, as the man -was ap
' pointed by the Chief of Police .'instead of
by the board. ~ The resolution was lost, the
Mayor being the only one to favor it.
- -Chief Fair recommended that J. W.
Bankhead, foreman of truck 1, be trans
ferred to extraman of engine 2; that Mike
Quigley, extraman of engine 2, be given
the - f oremanship made vacant, and that
John Fitzsimmons, steward of chemical 1,
be dismissed from the department. â At

TO FILL THE MARSH.
Improvement Club Raised the ' Money
. * to Do the Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 17.â West
Oakland " Improvement Club' has shown
its right to exist by the work it is ; doing.
Sufficient money has been raised to have
the depression at Sixteenth- and Pine j
streets filled with mud pumped from the j
bay, and Captain John iiackett, a member
of the club and representative of the
Pacific Coast -Dredging and -, Reclamation
Company, will begin work at once.
. :In speaking of ."> the subject, Captain
Hackett said ; it was his opinion that his
dredger would not leave the vicinity until
j the entire West Oakland marsh was filled
[ and that he had facts which bore him out
in such a belief. He also said the railroad
company would assist in improving that
part of the city. 'â¢ y â 'â â â â .:,'â <â¢â 
BATES' HEAVY FAILURE.
Principal of the Berkeley Gymnasium
â¢ â " Caught in Land Deals. .'.'V.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 17.â George
Bates, the principal of the Berkeley gym
nasium, a private boys' school at the uni
versity town, filed his petition to be de
clared an insolvent to-day. He gives his
liabilities at $50,173 17 and his assets at
$6538 05, of which $175 is claimed as ex
empt. The reason eiven for the failure is
bad real estate investments in Kansas and
Stockton.
It is said that within the past five years
he has lost $100,000 owing to the failure of
realizing anything from the properties.
He was unable to keep up payments, and
the former owners foreclosed on the lands,
with the result that he- had large de
ficiency judgments placed against him.
The Heaviest creditors of Bates' are John
Jackson of Stockton in the sum of $21,000;
T. Lewis, Oakland, sl-200; Judah Boas, San
; Francisco, $2120; â¢Â» Pacific Mutual Insur
: ance Company, $5750 jf Fourth i National
i Bank of Wichita, Kans., $9000. Besides
j these there are a large list of storekeepers
i in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley
in sums ranging from a few dollars to
hundreds. .-â¢!
Among the assets are a list of prominent
families about the bay and throughout the
State who are in arrears for their boys'
tuition from a few dollars up to nearly
$700. Mr. Bates is well known as an edu
cator and has resided in Berkeley many
years. ,''"â â ' â '"'-" ~Z':* \ZZZ*\
PRIMARIES IN BERKELEY.
Followers of Foote and Lay-
mance Are Out With the
. Machine.
The Unprecedented Vets Causes Re-
bellion Among College Town
Democrats.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 17.â War is
brewing in the ranks of the local Democ
racy. The discord among the local leaders
is over the primaries recently held in
Berkeley. "'.â '-'
The primaries were a surprise to many
people outside the political . swim. .Old
residents looked at the polling-places and
the crowds around them and at the Targe
number of wagons that carried voters to
the headquarters, and asked one another
"where all the Democrats had come from."
The primaries were held on June 5 and
by nightfall many an old-timer who bad
thought that he knew the college town
quite well had begun to think that Berke
ley was a town of much larger popu
lation of followers of the modernized
Jefferson than it had been previously: cred
ited with.
"There were 230 votes cast in East Berke
ley on that eventful day." said a promi
nent . Democrat lof Berkeley . to-day.
"When the polls closed I heard a bet of
$100 offered that not over thirty of the
voters were really Democrats.
â¢ "Berkeley is admittedly a Republican
town, but the Democratic vote at the pri
maries of 1896 outnumbered the Republi
can by about two .to one, which is cer
tainly a clear indication of crooked work.
"Such political methods do not meet
the approval of the best element of the
party, and, their success leads us â > to wish *
for the Australian or some secret ballot
system in .primary elections by means
of which the heelers might be deprived
of their power." â¢'" " .
At this late day no results can be accom
plished by the kickers * who are not dis
posed to fight in the open, but there are
those who carry a knife for the primary
managers of 1896, who managed to scrape
up 440 votes, t.v
The Democratic vote of the town is esti
mated at less than 250..

908 Broadway, June 17. f
For the first lime since : its arrival from
"Washington, the flag of Uncle Sam's rev
enue service floated from the new Oakland
Custom-house to-day. . :â¢'.; â â â¢'â 'â . .
The uncommon sight of the new flag
created general interest, and it was the
first intimation to the public that this city
has an active custom-house and that it is
Oakland's New Custom-House, Over; Which Uncle -Sam's Revenue Flag Floated
, y , '. V V for the First Time Yesterday. - ''. / -<Â».''"'
no longer necessary for a merchant to go
to San Francisco to enter or clear cargoes
or shipments. ' â¢ â¢'..' â¢ ' >f .. '-..' ..-â  â¢'"
There was much speculation among the
uninitiated as to the motive for hoisting
the flag. Many thought it was floating to
the breeze because . t*-day- is the anni
versary of Bunker Hill; others'concluded
that it was in honor of the seating of the
Laymance-English delegates at Sacra
mento, and that Warren B. English, the
sub-Collector of the port of Oakland, had
wired instructions to that effect from the
capital. â¢ -
The real truth of the matter is that the
flag floated ' because it was there to float,
and neither patriotism nor politics cut any
figure. The office has been waiting for
several months for the necessary books and
seal from Washington.. These and the flag
have just arrived, and the office able to
transact all the business that can be trans
acted at a full-fledged port of entry.
The seal reads: "Sub-port of Oakland,
Cal., District of San Francisco, < Collector
of Customs,' Deputy." It is the first time
that Oakland has been officially designated
as a sub-port, and it will soon be affixed to
the papers of â¢ several - vessels owned [ here,
and then Oakland will be advertised wher
ever her ships may be as a port of entry.
, Although the office was established some
months ago there has been but little busi
ness done, as most of the consignments \o
Oakland merchants are from foreign ports,
and consignees' papers could not be made
out to Oakland until there was an office
here. Now- that sufficient time has elapsed
the cargoes (j are beginning to arrive, and
the local custom-house will soon be very
busy.; ,'â 'â â .'-â¢ 'â  - ' - - : .'â¢â ".â â

Thirdâ That any employer who insists or

Fourthâ That we believe Oakland should
keep In the iront , rank in each of . her several
lines, carefully guarding her interests, morally,

908 Broadway, June 17. j
The statement made in to-day's papers
that San Francisco 'â¢ may be required to
conduct her municipal government on a
$1 tax limit contained great 'interest for
Mayor â  Davie. ,;â  The Mayor has run Oak
land for one year on $1 and he thinks he is
qualified to express an opinion. ,
<â  Mayor Davie's . experience :as Mayor,
with a Council ' and Board of Works | op
posed to him; in every way possible, has
convinced him that life is too short for a
man to serve two terms. ..
"There is no reason why San Francisco
cannot be ran on $1 as well as Oakland,"
said the Mayor to-day. "We have bad a
year of it and 1 am proud of the showing
made. lam not; proud of ; the despicable
straits into which a small-minaed Council
has run things financially, but that is not
my -. fault. Had 'the apportionment of
funds been left as I fixed it all would have
gone well. y As â¢it is, there was ; plenty of
money raised by the $1 ; tax, , but it has
been frittered away in all conceivable di
rections for the sole purpose of hurting me
politically.
"It has been a thankless task and it a
man wants to see his fellow man in all his
meanness there is no y better' vantage
ground than that of a Mayor who attends
to his office as he would to his private
business. I have given ail my time to the
business of the City and I have educated
the people in regard to municipal finances
more than they were ever educated be
fore. ' .
y "There are two examples of the work of
the present Council now before this 1 city
that are shameful. The great boon to the
working classes and one which is patron
ized by hundreds daily, the free reading
rooms, is closed .' and on the door yis a
notice "Closed for lack of funds." , A
grosser lie never was written. There was
ample money in the library fund and
more than in the similar fund of any city
of its size in the country. But the library
trustees think j: more of politics than
honesty and try to fool the public - j '
y "The High School wasplosed two weeks
earlier than usual and the cry went .up
that there was a lack; of funds. This was
as great a fabrication as the other, as tbe
teachers were actually paid for the whole
time the school would under ordinary cir
cumstances have been open.
'.'Under the new charter, if adopted, San
Francisco's Mayor >â . will have proven
enough to :_ insure the â  carrying out of his
financial policy. Sutro has had the same
fight since I elected that I have bad, and
from what I understand be is about as dis
gusted with everything as 1 am. y There is
no use for an honest man in municipal
politics in this: neighborhood. I believe
now that I am not popular with the ma
jority. â ; My administration's indorsed by
honest men and ';. condemned | by ,' rogues,
and the rogues predominate." -

the effect that all children between the

CUTTING THE ESTIMATES
Superintendent Ashworth Can
Make a Great â  Reduc- :
tion.
A Revised Statement Will Be Pre-
y sented -to the Grand
Â . Jury. *_ ' '' .
The Grand Jury, in special session at
the District' Attorney's office, last night
heard Thomas Ashworth, superintendent
of Streets, and his chief deputy, A. J.
Donovan, on the subject of . estimates for
street work for the next fiscal year. '
' Among the items considered were $400,
-000 for repairing cobbled streets and $150,
-000 for repair of water-front streets. ,
The amount included in all the items
presented by Mr. Ashworth approximates
$1,500,000/ He and his chief deputy ex
plained to the Grand Jury that these rec-
ommendations included everything that
property-owners and improvement clubs
deemed most desirable and were not con
sidered as.absolutely.: necessary., The Su
perintendent promised to submit to the
jury a statement of what he considered the
actual necessities of the department. '
The fact ; was clearly presented that the
Supervisors had by contract disbursed
nearly $300,000 of the $526,000 appropriated
to maintain the Street Department for the
year now closing.
The Superintendent will, it is believed,
present a revised statement, showing that
he can get along with $450,000, which will
include $150,000 for sweeping and repair
ing the streets. y-â  - 'â <-> .;-â¢"
- is.an open question whether the City
ia compelled to expend any money on the
water-front streets before the completion
of. the seawall and thoroughfare. Should
this view obtain,'. $150,000 may be omitted
in this line. .
VISALIA'S TRIAL CLOSING
In Defense of Lovren General
Kittrell Denounces Obie
Britt.
Applause, of the Forensic . Effort by
spectators Is Reprimanded by
the Court.
VISALIA, Cal., June 17.â This morning
argument in Josiah Lovren's case was re
sumed by J. W. Ahem. As he was com
paring ; they difference between the testi
mony of some of the defendant's own
witnesses he; was interrupted by Juror
Elam, who wanted to ask for some' infor
mation on that point. Judge Gray, how
ever, admonished the juror that it would
be better to say nothing, lest he might do
something inadmissible.
:',. General J. R. Kittrell then ; followed for
the defense. ; Soon Obie :Britt came in for
ft share of the general's forensic eloquence,
mingled with scorn of a withering charac
ter. While in \ the midst of an eloquent
roast of Britt a number of the spectators
began to applaud and Judge Gray ordered
the bailiff to arrest the men who contribu
ted to the applause. : Only one was found
who would own up to this breach of the
law. This was - Andrew ! Gilstrap,-. aged
about 18 years, who was J put under arrest
and i taken to y jail. - Shortly before noon
young Gilstrap was brought into court and
severely reprimanded â  by the \ Judge ' and
then , was allowed to go. ,
' General Kittrell finished his argument
after 4 o'clock. To-morrow morning Mau
rice E. Power will ; close the case . for the

NECESSITIES ARE DENIED
Fair Warning Given to the Board
of Supervisors Yes-
terday.
DE. CREELY WAS DISMISSED.
Property-Owners Protested Strongly
Against a Sewer Without
an Outlet.
The Board of Health gave the Board of
Supervisors fair warning yesterday that
unless the City Receiving Hospital is im
mediately famished with the surgical sup
plies needed the institution will be closed
until the articles are forthcoming.
The matter came to a head when Dr.
Well, the physician of the hospital, com
plained that tnere were many articles ab
solutely necessary for the care of surgical
cases that could not be obtained from the
Supervisors.
Dr. Hart was on his feet in an instant,
and declared that such a state of affairs
was an outrage, and that if the hospital
could not be furnished with bare necessi
ties it might as well close.
Dr. Morse took the cue and made a mo
tion that unless supplies were furnished
within forty-eight hours the hospital doors
should be shut. The motion carried.
Mrs. Bates petitioned the board to ap
point a female physician to look after fe
males brought to the hospital, and her ap
plication was referred to the Hospital
Committee.
On motion of Dr. Fitzgibbonthe position
of veterinary surgeon of the board, held
by Dr. E. Creely. was declared vacant.
Creely was charged with having exceeded
his authority in examining herds of cows
for tuberculosis without the knowledge of
the board, and with having promised to
protect certain miinmen by having the ex
amination of their herds put off until the
last in returns for loans of money.
. Dr. Creely emphatically denied the
charges against him, offering to prove his
innocence, and no regular investigation
was held, but the board has had enough of
scandals and decided to peremptorily ex
ercise its power of removal rather than go
through the ordeal of an inquisition.
Resolutions of respect to the memory of
the late Dennis Spencer were passed.
- A delegation of citizens from the yicitity
of First avenue and California street ap
peared before the board and protested
against the sewerage in their districts.
They stated that the sewer on California
street from First avenue to Walnut has no
outlet and that the stench has become un
bearable.
Tne Walnut street sewer was declared
to De in much the same condition and
fear for the health of the neighborhood
was expressed.
The board decided to investigate the
matter and ascertain who is responsible
for the conditions alleged by the pro
testants. - â  :-'-Y'Z.

DANIEL TOLD
ABOUT "RACKETS."
Detective Wood's Assistant
on Miss Ashley's Strong
Work.
Work.
HER COUNTER CHARGES.
Baldwin's Fair Accuser Says
O'Kefe Played Her
False.
SOME ASSUMED NAMES.
The Big Betrayal Case in the Superior
Court Continues Its Spicy
Developments.
Daniel J. O'Kefe was again the central
figure in the Ashley-Baldwin suit yester
day. He told of "strong work," "rackets"
and other Bostonese diversions which
were engaged in at the different places
where Miss Ashley lodged in "The Hub."
Early in the day a couple of letters were
introduced in evidence. They were from
Lillian A. Ashley to "Dear Daniel." and
the envelopes were addressed to D. J.
O'Kefe. It seems that after t-he death of
the employer, Miss Ashley was inclined
to be solaced by the clerk, but, according
to his testimony. Daniel was not disposed
to play the role of consoler.
Following are the contents of the letters
introduced :
Friday eve., November 14.
Dear Daniel : You have not come up as you
promised, but try to realize that you are very
busy and much grieved. However, you must
know how 1 do depend upon you, and how and
when to act in the matter of this note. Being
ill as I am, I am so needy and dependent that
most any Judge would allow my claim if there
is anything left. If not, try to arrange a meet
ing with her or his nephew. Manage it some
way, Daniel, tor you know the circumstances
best. Please let me hear from you soon or see
you. Also I wish you would give me the ad
dress of the one that has charge of the settling
of poor Wesley's affairs after you leave, or give
me the address of his nephew. Believe me,
very grateful to you for past kindness and in
much sorrow, sincerely,
Miss l. A. Ashley.
P. S.â Have seen Dr. Whitmore. and he is
very kind. He will attend me just the same as
before. Through Mrs. Hayes' kindness to keep
her a little while free and expect my sister to
come up here by Saturday eve (to-morrow).
Please come up any time after the train ar
rives, which is 7:30 P, M. L. A. A.
Dear Daniel : Your kind note duly received,
and *hank you for the same. I suppose you
did not see her. Pettes. However, I have not
seen him yet. My sister and I leave here to
day to go and live at 23 Bellevue street. Brook
line. You know where the Beacon House isâ
a little way out on Beacon street. Well, Brook
line avenue is the street to the left that leads
up to the railroad. Bellevue street is the sec
ond street to the right that leads off from
rsrookline avenue, a short walk out or into the
city. Can come in and see Dr. W. once a week
easily. My sister gets a small price per week
doing general housework. I get my board.
Am in hopes we shall live and can remain
some time. Please come out and see us any
time, Daniel. Also let me know if you change
your address. With kindest rezards believe
Miss L. A. A.
For some time after the demise of W<
ley T. Balch O'Kefe did not, despite tbe
pressing invitations sent him, go to see
Miss Ashley. Then one day he met her on
a streetcar. In the meanwhile Daniel bad
gone to work for J. R. Wood, the detec
tive. Miss Ashley had evidently heard of
this, for she accused him of telling
naughty stories about her, and informed
him that if he did so it would be the
worse for him. She accused O'Kefe of
having stolen money confided to him by
Balch for delivery to her, and said she
had letters from Balch that would prove
this. ' :!?.-â¢"â¢ Vi
O'Kefe says be denied the accusation.
He was then earning $8 per week as a de
tective, and told of a number of people he
shadowed, though what great crimes he
ran to earth remain to be heard from.
The testimony now went back to the
glad days when Balch was alive. O'Kefe
told of the different places where he had
visited Miss Ashley while acting as a
messenger- boy. He testified that while
her headquarters were at Mrs. Melville's
she complained that there was "strong
work" going -on there at night.
When asked what he meant by strong
work, the young man from Boston lucidly
explained, "Rackets."
"Rackets?" repeated the puzzled ques
tioner.
"Yes, beer rackets," replied the witness.
"They went out for beer and had a good
time."
O'Kefe occasioned some surprise when he
explained that Wood, Barnes and himself
came to California under assumed names
and concealed themselves in Oakland that
Miss Ashley's attorneys might not dis
cover them. O'Kefe is getting more than
$8 per week. He testified that $3 per day
and expenses is oeihg allowed him. He
did not know until it came out in court
that Wood is to receive $2500 for his work
in Baldwin's behalf.
The case closed for the day with Daniel
still on the stand.

TURNER, THE TOUGH.
He Is Convicted of Assault With Intent
to Rob.
Clarence Turner was yesterday convicted
of assault with intent to commit robbery.
This is his second trial on the charge,' the
jury having disagreed the first time.
Turner is a young fellow, only 20 years of
age, but he is about as low a rowdy as bas
been seen in San Francisco for a long time.
i On January 13, late at night, Turner went
! to tbe room of O. T. Dyer in the Baltimore
i Hotel and presented a dummy note so as
to get him out of the house. Dyer refused
to accompany him and started toward a
gas jet to read the note. As he did to Tur
ner hit him with a slungshot, and as Dyer
lay on the floor threatened to kill him if
he did not give up his valnables.
Turner escaped, but was captured in
Oakland. When he was arrested a couple
of masks and a pistol were ' found in his
possession.
Turner will be taken before Judge
Belcher for sentence on Saturday.
MOUNT DIABLO COAL.
The Manufacturers' Association Wants
It Used in the State Prisons. â 
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation is making a strong fight to get
the prison directors to use California coal
in the mills at San Quentin and earnestly
recommends the Contra Costa coal in the
following letter to the directors:
Gentlemen: We have been informed that your
honorable board has deferred consideration of
the bids for coal and hardware lor the prison
at San Quentin until next Saturday. Among
the bids for coal there will be found one from
a California company, namely, the Pittsburg
Coal Mining Company. The coal put on the
market by this company, besides being a Cali
fornia product, is, we are informed, of as good
if not better quality than any coal used in this
market, and if your tests have proven such to
be the case, as we have no doubt they have, we
would most respectfully urge that you award
this contract, if the bid is as low or lower than
other bids for an equal quality of coal, to the
California coal company.

pioneers of California, passed away last

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1896.
JAPAN'S NEW
MINISTER TALKS.
Cheap Competition He Con-
siders Only a False
Alarm.
CHINA IS HER MARKET.
Emigrants Prefer Hawaii to This
Country for Laborers'
Chances.
AMERICA JAPAN'S FIRST LOVE.
Enormous Chinese Indemnity Fund to
Be Adjusted Through Lon-
don Banks.
T. Hosho, formerly a member â¢of the
Japanese Parliament, but recently ap
pointed Minister to the United States, is
at the Palace on his way to Washington.
T. Hosho, the New Japanese Minister, Now on His Way to Washington.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.] -
He is accompanied by his. wife and child.
The new Minister is a middle-aged man,
and is slightly disposed to flesh. This is
his third visit to the United States, and
he speaks very good English, although
with the diplomatic hesitancy of one who
would not have his meaning misconstrued.
He discussed Japan's commercial inter-
course, the competition Americans fear
from her manufactures, emigration, the
award of contracts for five new battle-
ships and the large indemnity fund due
from China as a result of the recent war.
The Japanese, he says, have a very
kindly feeling for Americans, because the
United States was the first country to en-
ter into fair and equal treaty relations
with them.- - Were prices equal he thinks
Japan would favor this country in buying
raw materials and other goods, but senti
ment is - not a greater force in Japan than
it is in Amer.'ca when it comes to a plain
business transaction. He says that the
Americans do not cater to Japanese trade
or any other foreign trade as do the Eng
lish and the Germans, who take .pains to
manufacture goods especially to suit their
foreign customers.
"We would prefer," he remarked, "to
buy in America, but we can get materials
much cheaper in England. If you made
your prices less we would buy., here. You
are our greatest customer, but we ': buy
from you more than you buy from us."
Minister Hosho considers- the competi
tion of Japanese manufactures with Ameri-
can goods only a â¢ scare without anything
in his country to warrant it. There has
not been, he declares, any great manu
facturing impulse since or because of the
war.
He has read in American papers of
-American factories in Japan where very
cheap watches are made.but at home .he
could not learn that there were any such
factories. Japan is manufacturing a large
number of bicycles and at a low price, but
they are frail and would not' be received in
America. - In fact when the Japanese want
good machines they buy them in London
or in America. China is Japan's market
for small manufactured goods. -
Fewer Japanese are emigrating to Amer
ica. They do not realize what they once
expected from the venture. ; Hawaii gets
most of the emigrants.
Mr. Hosbo thinks that about five : years
hence all parts of Japan will be opened
freely to foreign travelers without pass-
ports. Treaties with different countries
are being slowly revised to that purpose. ;y'
The â¢ Government decided y last year to
build about five battls ships. Mr. Hosho
was in Parliament at the time. Japan is
not prejudiced^ in favor of any particular
country as the builder of her warships.
Where her designs can be followed for. the
least money, there the contracts will
probably be awarded. Mr. Hosho says the
model of tbe battle ship Oregon was on ,
exhibition in the War Department at
Tokio. He inspected the Oregon . yester-
day with Mr. Scott, . and is very much
pleased with her.
In the Minister's party are two Japanese
bankers.. They are going to London on
business connected with the Chinese in-
demnity Â fund of i 2,300,000,000 ; taels due
Japan as payment for the expense she â  in-
curred in the recent war. ..
- . T.Yamanato represents the National Bank
of Japan at Tokio and K. Sonoda, president
of the Specie Bank of I Yokohama, is his
colleague. They purpose to make arrange-
ments for the disposition of these funds in
England, the payments being due in Ber
lin and London in gold. _';â¢
y China has already paid 1,300.000,000 taels,
or half of : the total indemnity, together
with 300,000,000 taels for the return of cer-
tain territory captured during the war. y
. The adjustment -of 5. this business is a
delicate matter, and one. â¢ if : not i carefully
conducted, that, would affect the monetary
conditions of the world throueh a change*;
in the exchange rates.'lpsS&tiSip
Minister Hosho will start on Friday for
Washington: â¢ How : long he ; will : remain
there he cannot say, as he is not appointed
for any definite time, y : ;y
Inadvertently :'-. Omitted.
In the list of graduates of the Hamilton
Grammar School, published . in yesterday's
Call, the name of ' Miss : Mary ( Ellen 'â  Hottua
of 2712 Bush street was inadvertently omit
ted. The young lady was one - of â¢ the highest
in her class, standing among the highest ten
in scholarship.
HE GOT SIX MONTHS.
Jacob Unna Refused to Testify A gains
H. Hirsch, His Book-
Hv Hirsch, His Book-
keeper.
Herman Hirsch, bookkeeper for Jacob
Unna, 115 Front street, was arrested -on
May 16 on complaint of his employer for
felony embezzlement, y ~Y .'.'-:
Hirsch had been bookKeeper for about
two â¢ years and was taken sick a week or
two before his arrest. During his absence
it was discovered that be had been collect- j
ing accounts and had not entered the
amounts in his cashbook. An expert was
called in, and when Hirsch returned to
the office from the hospital he was placed
under arrest.
The case has been continued from time
to time, ana yesterday morning Judge
Low insisted upon going on with it. Hirsch
said he was willing to plead guilty to mis
demeanor embezzlement. The complain
ing witness wanted the case dismissed and
refused to testify against his bookkeeper.
The Judge then sentenced Hirsch to six
months in the County Jail.
Unna afterward admitted that Hirsch's
defalcations would exceed $3000.
AN AGED CRIMINAL.
Seventy Years Old and Convicted Four-
teen Times.
Alexander Thompson, a white-haired
man of 70, yesterday pleaded guilty in
Judge Belcher's court to the charge of
burglary. â¢â \\ .~yf V ~
Thompson has. been a thief for over
thirty years. He has thirteen prior convic
tions against him in California alone. The
first record of punishment meted out to
bim was when he was convicted in the
Police Court, May 26, 1865. Most of his
time since then has, been passed in jail,
his last conviction being on September 21,
1895. '...-..
On March 20 of this year, Thompson was
captured in the apartments of Julia Flynn,
111334 Leavenworth street, and for this
crime he will be sentenced on Saturday by
J udge Belcher. - \", , â  .
DETECTIVES ARE AT SEA.
They . Can Find No Clew to the
Murderer of Mrs. Zieger's
Child.
The Woman Will Be Examined by a
Police Judge and May. Go
Free.
" Mrs. Martha Zieger, the woman who has
.been detained at the City Prison since Fri-
day last under suspicion of being the mur
derer of her new-born child on December
7, 1895, will be taken before a Police Judge
to-day or to-morrow, and if the prosecut- '
ing attorney, hearing the facts of the
case, should think the evidence sufficient
to draw a complaint against the woman,
she will be charged with the crime of mur-
dci. Otherwise she will be discharged and
exonerated.' '..-':â '
Mrs. Zieger, as stated a few days ago in
The Call, calmly confessed the crime to a
reporter. However, as the police have not
possession of the corpus delicti, and as
nobody has seen the child . except a man
named Sutter, Chief ; Crowley has decided
to submit the case to one of the prosecut-
ing attorneys.
â¢ Officer Ryan and Detective Dillon, who
have been working on the case since the
arrest of the woman, have so far made but
very little progress, as they, could not find
any trace of Sutter, who is" wanted in con-
nection with ; the murder "of the child.
Sutter disappeared on the day of the â¢ ar-
rest of the woman and has not been seen
or heard of since in this City.
Chief Crowley, in speaking of the case
last night, said: "It seems to me that the
officers should have made a report to mo
about the case by this time, as the woman
has been in prison ever since Friday last.
So far they have not found Sutter,
and as there â¢yis y no direct cvi-
dence ,; of .':- the guilt of â  the . woman
I will submit the case to one of the prose-
cuting attorneys. Â. Nobody has ,- seen ; the
. baby, and the only. witness we have is the
woman, herself. There is still hope that
we will find Sutter, and if we should, sue-
ceed, .he will surely ; ; be charge d with
murder. y- . ;,;.
. "The /woman is \ confined in ; prison for
the last six .days without being charged,
and 1 therefore think that to-day some
thing should be done in her case."
| Mrs. Zieger spoke as ; coolly and calmly
about her case as on the day of her arrest.
She positively does - not realize I the heavy
charge which ; she may be called y upon to
answer. She said:
"I only .wish that they would watch that
man Sutter, as he is responsible for all my
trouble. â â  ; My husband is -to ; blame ". that
Sutter has escaped, as he has told him he
would; cause my arrest. Sutter took the
hint * and escaped. ; It is not impossible
that he may kill himself, as â¢'â  he : has a pis

be arrested, as I want to see - him S pun

REV. G. VINAI
IS DISMISSED.
The San Francisco Presby
tery and Its Foreign
Pastor.
PAY CAME IRREGULARLY
Both the French and Italian
Missions Have Known
Hard Times.
EXPENSES TO BE CURTAILED.
The Sick Pastor Says It Is Unjust to
Send Him Away Without
Due Notice.
For some time past the San Francisco
. Presbytery has had two foreign ministers
on its hands whose meager salaries have
dragged behindhand in a way that was
painful, both to the pastors who were sup
posed to subsist upon tbem and to the
presbytery, which was supposed to re
ceive the salaries from the various Presby
terian City churches, each of which had
undertaken a certain amount of indebted
ness in supporting the French and Italian
missions.
Rev. Eugene Dupuy is pastor of the
French mission , and Rev. G. Vinai was
brought from South Carolina a couple of
years ago by the ' San Francisco Presby
tery to take charge of the Italian work.
Mr. Dupuy is supposed to receive $250
from the San Francisco Presbytery and a
like amonnt from the Oakland Presbytery.
Oakland has no indebtedness in the Ital
ian work, but the San Francisco Presby
tery is supposed to give the Italian .pastor
$600 a year, though the board of missions
in New York supplies some of the amount.
Neither of the pastors has had his salary
paid with that regularity which marks the
cheerful giver. Some of the churches
have paid up regularly, others have not,
and the pastors have had at times to bor
row from their friends or live on credit.
Rev. Eugene Dupuy. â¢ when questioned
on the subject yesterday, admitted that so
far this year he had lived on hope and the
Italian pastor said there had been months
at a time when he had to depend on the
clemency of his landlady for board and
lodging. Oakland Presbytery still owes a
large slice of â¢ last year's salary to the
French mission. ,
On Monday last the San Francisco Pres
bytery, held a session with closed doors, at
which the subject of the foreign pastors
and their salaries was thoroughly argued
out. The pastoral year begins with July,
and Rev. F. R. Farrand, moderator of the
presbytery, urged in the most emphatic
way that the churches should pay up
their obligations to the . foreign work be
fore that date.
Calvary, St. John's, Westminster and
the Howard Church had nothing to re
proach themselves with in that . respect,
but Rev. F. R. Farrand urged that the
other churches . should follow:; their ex
ample. There was a somewhat warm dis
cussion, and it was finally resolved that
the money should be raised by. July 1. It
was also resolved to abolish , all expense
in connection with the .Italian mission by
dismissing the pastor, Rev. G. Vinai, and
turning the work [ over to John Russell,
who would continue it gratis.
This summary action has given rise to
considerable feeling among Rev. Mr.
Vinai's friends. The Italian pastor is at
present sick in bed at his home, 1000 Lom
bard street. When seen yesterday he
was at first disinclined to talk, but finally
said: "I am strongly averse to notoriety,
but for the sake of my wife and children I
shall see that justice is done. You cannot
discharge a man in a moment, when he
has a family, and I am a foreigner with
scarcely a" friend here, and they brought
me 3000 miles. â¢ y . t- * Â ,
"Before coming to San Francisco I was
pastor and director of fifty Waldensian
families in South Carolina. I would never
have left that position if 1 had known
what I was coming to, for a man with wife
and children must have the means to live,
and the salary there/ though small, was
regularly paid by the Congregational Board
of Home Missions. I left my position be-
lieving they were truthful. On the way I
was delayed at Los Angeles by the strike
and had to stay at a hotel till my small
means were almost gone. - When I got to
San Francisco; what was my surprise to
find that the presbytery had no money.
"However, I said nothing, but lived on
credit from July till November. One day
in that month a ; Mr. Logan, I think his
name was, of the Young People's Society,
came and gave me $6 50; it was a small
sum, after living so long on nothing, but
I took it and said nothing." .
The pastor stated 'I that there had been
months at a time, when if it bad not been
for the kindness of his landlady, he would
have been without the wherewithal to
live, but he , went on laboring at his mis-
sion and taking, his salary when it came.
Lately -he has suffered from a racking
cough, and the committee of the presby
tery, consisting of Rev. J. Cumming Smith,
Rev. Mr. Jenks and Rev. . F. R. Farrand,
have urged him to. take a month's vaca
tion, but he refused to leave his work, and
having received no salary since January
be had not the means to go away and pro
vide for his wife and three children during
his absence.
It is on account of his wife and children
that the pastor's sudden . ; dismissal has
broken him completely up in health. He
looks like a man on the verge of â  con-
sumption. y
"I am a foreigner, almost without
friends here, and am too sick to take any
steps at present," he said yesterday, "but
if they do not do their duty I will do mine.
The work was so promising:, too. We had
eighteen converts y last â *;.' Pentecost, and
there were ; ninety-five scholars in the
school last Sunday."
y Rev. â¢F.; R. Farrand stated yesterday
that the churches would' pay up all their
indebtedness before . July. '-'â  ."Dr. â ;â¢ Mac-
kenzie's church, fori instance, has had a
number of other charities on hand, but it
will pay up. We dismissed the Italian
pastor to curtail the expenses and because
we were not thoroughly satisfied with the
Italian work. As ; for arrears, we are not
bound \to 7 pay ' oftener than every six
months, and tbe pastoral year does not be
gin till July 1."
