FACES A CRISIS

AN AMERICAN IN THE TOILS.
John Hays Hammond, the Mining
Engineer, Among Those Arrested
for Treason.
LONDON, E.vg., Jan. 11.â Though offi
cial and diplomatic circle? are -aid to be
lie ye that Great Britain is facing a great
crisis, the pubic refuse? to believe that
tnere is even a possibility of war. It is
thought the naval preparations making
are well enough in their way, to impress
upon foreign powers that Great l>ri:ain is
ready to accept the gage of battle should
it be thrown dowr., but the popular opin
ion is that Engl and will not herself pro
voke a war.
The belief prows, however, that the
Transvaai Government will need a re
mind- â  Britain still exercises
suzerain j r the country, and
does i. . â¢ : rego any other rights
conferred upon her by the Anglo-Boer
convention of LBB4.
31 1.; faction is expressed at the
â '.-â¢ sident Kxuger. Though it is
generally conceded that he is practically a
the Transvaal it is believed the
anger of the burghers against the British
is burning ?o fiercely that he dares not re
!ea-Â»' Dr. Jameson and the other prisoners
nt present, and that in making their re
lease c : unon the restoration of
order in Johannesburg he is temporizing
in order that the indignation among the
Boers may cool down.
The report of the existence of docu
ments showing the existence of a wide
spread conspiracy against the Transvaal
simp. - the belief entertained in
many quarters that tills was really an in
tention on the Dart of certain ambitious
.'â  uTerttrrn the Transvaal Govern
ment and then bring about the annexa
tion oi that country to Cape Colony.
It is thought the arrest at Johannesburg
of a number of members ol the reform
committee was due to the knowledge
reaching the Government that the men ar
rested are implicated in this conspiracy.
John H. Hammond, the American min
ing engineer, who was arrested, is well
q in New York and it is reported

I oat city and elsewhere to secure

I all serious trouble with tne
vaal lias been averted by the prompt
tion of the British Govern
ment and that whatever questions may
arise or have already arisen will be settled
through the us: lt j c channels.
With regard to Germany it can be said
that although the interference of Emperor
William in a matter that in nowise con
cerned him aru.- ; warlike feeling
throughout Great Britain that feeling is to
a creat extent dying out under the re
peated assurances of the German press
that Germany never intended to affront
If Great Britain is threatening any
power, or if any powor bas actually
threatened her, it is impossible to say
which power it is that bas menaced or is
being menaced. Of course it is generally
-tood that German y â  iwer in
question, but there is nol ial to
show that she i s . It is not known whether
or not Lord Salisbury ba r an
explanation of Emperor Wi I am - atti
tude, or if he has done so whether any
explanation has been vouchsafed him.
At any rate Emperor William is not
Germany, and the tone of German senti
ment so far as can be gleaned from news
paper comment is decidedly averse to war.
It is not in the power of the German
Emperor to declare war unless it is a de
fensive one. To declare war, if not merely
defensive, the Emperor must have the con
sent of the Bundesrath, and it is believed
the German commercial and colonial inter
ests would exert all their influence to pre
vent a declaration of war against flreat
Britain. Such a war would undoubtedly
â ;i*trous to those interests, and no one
is quicker to see this than the Germans
themselves. It will therefore devolve on
the British Government to declare war,
and it can be stated tnat scarcely any one
believes it will do so.
There can, however, be no denial made
<,) the fan that England is patting herself
in a condition of prepared readiness for
any emergency that may arise. Popular
opinion supports this policy and would
support war should it be necessary to pre
serve British honor or the integrity of the
empire, but it is not thought now that
either is tnreaiencd and there are not lack
ing persons who do not hesitate to declare
that .Lord .Salisbury is ''playing to the
gallery."

WAS A WIOESVRUA-n â  PLOT.
Jameson's Raid Jpjiears to lie Only an
Opening Wedge.
LONDON, RÂ»o., Jan. Advices from
Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange
Free State, say that the delegates of the
Orange Free State who were sent to Pre
toria to confer with the Government of the
South African Republic and proffer to the
Transvaal Government the assistance of
the Orange Free State, if it should be re
quired, have returned to Bloemfontein
and reported to the Rand (the executive
corps).
The delegation report that documents
have been discovered disclosing a wide
spread plot of which Dr. Jameson's raid
into the Transvaal was a part. The dele
gates entirely absolve Governor Robinson
of the Cape Colony of all knowledge of the
conspiracy.
Dispatches from Johannesburg, dated
January 8, Bay that the situation there
has become more grave in consequence of
the condition imposed by President
Krugerthat the release of Jameson and
his followers shall be contingent upon the
abrogation of the convention of 1884,
thereby making the Transvaal republic
an absolutely independent state.
Advices from Johannesburg state that
several of the members of the reform com
mittee have fled and that one of them has
been allowed to depart after dev-ositing
surety for his appearance when wanted in
the sum of Â£20,000.
It is rumored that the Government of
the Transvaal will demand the cession of
Amatontraland from Natal. This report
however, is not believed.
The Globe says it hear 3 that the flying
squadron just formed will first go to the
Mediterranean. It adds that the vessels
attached to the squadron, which may
eventually be ordered to proceed to DeJ
agoa Bay, Portuguese P^ast Africa, will
probably go by way of the Suez Canal.
The whole statement has a doubtful air.
Dispatches from Portsmouth state that tue
date of the departure of the flying squad
ron from that port has not yet been lixed,
but it is expected that Rear- Admiral A. T.
Dole, who has Lecu appointed to the
command of the squadron, will be at sea
by January 18.

Sir Hercules Robinson has issued a procla

LONDON, E^c, Jan. 11.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Johannesburg says
that fifty-four arrests of members of the
Reform Committee have already been
made, and that further warrants have been
issued.
The dispatch adds that the curiosity con
cerning the losses sustained by the Boers
in the fighting with Dr. Jameson's party
is unappeased. There is reason to believe
that they lost 150 men at Doornkop alone.

respect to foreign affairs is one of some
anxiety, and demands the most concen

To Notify Krueger That American Right a
Must Be. Jtetpected. â  â¢
â¢ General R. P. Hammond, on hearing of
the arrest of his brother, John Hayes
Hammond, did not let the grass grow
under . his . feet. He kept the wires hot
during the afternoon, and in the evening
was enabled to announce to his friends that
the National Government would see that
the arrested men had fair play. â â¢
General Hammond first telegraphed to
Goverror Budd, who wired to the Califor
nia Congressmen at Washington. The
message ran in this wise:
One of the most prominent mining engineers
of the Pacific Coast has been arrested at
Johannosberg on account of his friendship
to. Cecil Rhodes. Â£c 3 that his rights as an
American citizen are protected.
Late last evening General Hammond re
ceived a dispatch from Washington stat
ing that President Cleveland had in
structed Secretary of State Olney to send
a message of like import to President
Krueger. The message informed the gen
eral that the absence of an American
Consul at Johannesburg would not mil
itate against his brother's safety.
Other prominent Californians reported
to have been arrested at the same time as
Mr. Hammond are: Victor N. Clement;
Harry Webb, superintendent of the Selby
Smelting Works up tÂ« ninety daj'B ago;
Ed Garthwaite, a brother of the president
of the Union Bank of Oakland; Ai Tllgh

SOON TO BE DISSOLVED
Members of the Morgan Syndicate
Will Act in Their Indi
vidual Capacity.
German Bankers May Contribute
Twenty-five Millions for
the Bonds.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 11.â The with
drawal of the New York Life Insurance
Company from the Morgan bond syndi
cate following so closely on the heels of,
the Chemical Bank started a rumor in the
street that the Morgan syndicate will send
out formal notice of its dissolution to-day.
Speaking of the reported dissolution of
the preseut Morgan syndicate a banker
said that even if the commission should
disband it would not imperil the success
of the new loan in the slightest degree.
He claimed that i! the present syndicate
should go out of business another one
would be formed at once on the same lines
with new capital, as the first one was over
subscribed. The attitude of the German
bankers, he asserted, was more important
to Morgan than the action of the Chemi
cal Bank and the New York Life Insur
ance Company, as the foreigners, through
Speyer & Co., it is said, have guaranteed
to take $25,000,000 of the issue and place it
abroad, thereby bringing in just that much
new gold.
The bonds, it is said, will be held for in
vestment and will not be returned as was
the case with the February loan. In the
meantime gold is piling up at this center,
the receipts from abroad during the past
few days amounting to over $3,000,000.
The report that the Morgan syndicate
would issue a formal notice of the disso
lution to-day did not materialize. It was
learned, however, that some of the leading
members of the syndicate mci informally
and decided that hereafter they would act
in their individual capacity, so far as
bidding for the new bonds is concerned.
Owing to the absence of the head of the
syndicate, Mr. Morgan, nothing of any
official character could be obtained, but
it is reasonably certain that on Monday
next there will be a statement of some sort
from the syndicate. The opinion is cer
tain in banking circles that the announce
ment on Monday will be to the effect that
the syndicate, in view of recent develop
ments, considers it best to dissolve, leav-Â»
ing each member to file his own bid with
the Secretary of the Treasury.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 11.â The
treasury gold reserve at the close of busi
ness to-day stood at $56,029,536. The with
drawals at New York to-day amounted to
$55,000. The treasury completed to-day
sending out to postmasters Secretary
Carlisle's circular inviting bids for bonds.
On the top, signed by William L. Wilson,
Postmaster-General, is printed this notice:
"The postmaster is hereby directed to
post this circular in a conspicuous place in.
his office."
As there are over 73,000 postoffices in the
United States the printing and distribution
of this number was no small matter.
Director Preston of the treasury has
gone to Philadelphia to hurry up gold
coinage there. The heavy gold exports of
the past few weeks has made inroads on
\ the Government supply at New York and
it will be part of Director Preston's busi
; ness in Philadelphia to send gold to New
j York. A heavy shipment of gold to New
j York from the Philadelphia mint will be
! made during the coming week.
TREASURER ALDRICH FLED.
ft /s Supposed That He Burned the Court
house to Conceal His
Shortage.
LINCOLN, Nebe., Jan. 11.â Advices re
ceived at the Statehouse to-day are to the
effect that W. E. Aldrich, late treasurer of
Gosper County, has fled, presumably to
Oregon. Last November, while Examiner
McCloud was making an investigation of
the books of Aldrich at Elwood, the court
house was burned. Everything pointed to
incendiarism, and Aldrich was openly
charged with the crime in order to conceal
a shortage. He was not arrested, end his
friends claimed that he was insane. No
attempt vas made to send dim to the
asylum, however, and now it develops that
he has left the State. Examiner McCloua
says there is a shortage to the State, but
how much he cannot tell for some weeks,
| as nearly all the records were burned.
OWNED BY A DEFAULTER.
The Principal Stock of a Defunct Bank
in Bad Hands.
LINCOLN. Nebr., Jan. 11,â The State
Banking Board has taken charge of the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of Platte
Center. The bank has a capital stock of
$12,000 and was largely owned by County
Treasurer Lynch, who retired from office
yesterday short in his accounts. His
shortage is reported to be between $20,000
and $30,000. When the shortage was first
discovered, it was reported that Mr. Lynch
had the money loaned out and might be
able to collect it within a few days, but
this is now questioned. An investigation
is in progress.

COLON, Cuba, Dec. 30 (via Tampa, Fla.,
Jan. 11.)â To-day the column under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Perara
returned to this city. Yesterday it had a
sharp and bloody engagement with the
rebels under Gomez. The number of the
latter was estimated to be 5000. The van
guard of Colonel Ferara's column, com
posed of a detachment of Santiago cavalry,
met twenty mounted rebels between the
town of Calimete and the Triunfo sugar es
tate. The rebels fired a volley at the royal
troops and instantly retired in tne di
rection of their main body on the estate.
The column advanced, and on nearing
the estate a general fire was opened on it
by the rebels. Later a detachment of
mounted rebels charged with machetes.
They were allowed to get near enough to
the troops before the command to lire was
given. The first volley emptied twenty
saddles, when the rebels precipitately re
turned to shelter back of some temporary
barricades that they had erected. Colonel
Perara advanced his column, taking up
several positions.
Steady fire was maintained on both,
sides when the royal troops charged en
masse, wherepon the enemy fled. The
Spanish loss in killed and wounded in
dislodging them was large. The engage
ment commenced at 6 a. m. and lasted un
til 8. After the rebels tied the royal troops
gathered in their dead and wounded, tak
ing them to Calimete. From the latter
place they were transferred to-day to thia
city, where the dead were buried.
The casualties are as follows: Dead â Two
lieutenants and seventeen soldiers;
wounded â two captains, two lieutenants
and forty-seven soldiers. Some of the lat
ter have several bullet wounds.

It Tells of the Progress in the Struggle for

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.-Tomas

of the following letter from the insurgent
general. Gomez:
Headquarters Cuban Army in Campaign,)
jjuuak Plantation Kmfresa, >
Matanzas, Dec. 31, 1895. )
To Tokos Estrada I'a'una, Esq.â My Dear
Friend: I wrote you a few lines yesterday
and I write these in addition at night, as it is
the only time I have to spare, and that after a
hard day's work.
We have had three combats with the enemy
to-dny, and we have won all three and have
been doubly* successful, for we have thus
broken through their lines and are marching
forward, notwithstanding the great efforts of
the enemy to prevent it and all the desperate
means they are employing in order to drive us
back. ; v "
This territory, successfully invaded by us, is
full of the most exalted enthusiasm mixed
with surprise, as they did not expect this rapid
invasion. . The torch, 1 am sorry to say, is pro
ducing its effect, not among the* strong
minded, because these have always been with
the revolution, but with me weak, who are
row opening their eyes to the true situation of
the country.
They realize that the decisive moment has
arrived, and that true patriots should stop at
no sacrifice, for if they shed their blood gener
ously with greater reason they should raze the
country to the ground, If it is necessary to thus
obtain victory, because our dignity and self
respect are pledged in the heroic struggle
which is to redeem the Cuban people from the
tyranny of Spain.
it is not possible, my friend, that so many
accumulated hardships of our suffering people
tihouM not some day have their reward, which
is a natural consequence that justice metes
out to all as their rightful due.
We are doing all to our power here, leaving
all else to fortune. lam more than ever sure
that we will be successful, and you can so state
to the world, whose sympathies must be with
a nation righting for its independence.

COUNTED A QUORUM.
Speaker Reed Exercised the
Power the First Time
This Session.
CHANGES IN THE RULES.
All the Recommendations of the
Committee Agreed To
Except One.
WHEELER OBJECTED IN VAIN.
Declared that the Counting Process
Was Unfair and Wholly
Unconstitutional.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.â The
House to-day finished consideration of
the code of rules reported from the Com
mittee on Rules, with the exception of the
one with relation to the counting which
went over by request of Henderson (R.) of
lowa. Every change recommended by the
committee was agreed to and no proposi
tion originating on the floor was accepted.
The most entertaining part of the day's
discussion was evoked by an amendment
proposed by Curtis (R.) of New York,
which bad to do with eulogies upon de-
ceased members. It was advocated by a
number of members, but failed of adop
tion by a vote of 31 to 131.
Wanger (R.) of Pennsylvania endeavored
to secure a re-enactment of th<* rule of the
Fifty-third Congress giving the privilege
of the lobby in the rear of the hall to news
paper men, but secured only seventeen
votes in support of his motion. The vote
being short of a majority, gave an oppor
tunity for the Speaker to count a quorum
for the first time in this Congress. There
were 190 gentlemen in their seats and the
Speaker announced that a quorum was
present to do business.
The House resumed consideration of
changes in the code of rule 3 proposed by
the committee. At the suggestion of
Henderson (R.) of lowa the paragraph
relating to the counting of a quorum when
one fails to vote on auy question was tem
porarily passed.
"Wheeler (D.)of Alabama moved to strike
out the paragraph providing that "on de
mand of an}- member or at tho suggestion
of the Speaker the names of members suf
fioient to make a quorum in the hail of the
House who do not vote shall be noted by
the clerk and recorded in the journal and
reported to the Speaker with the names of
the members voting and be counted and
announced in determining the presence of
a quorum to do business. " His first ob
jection to it, Wheeler said, was that it
was unconstitutional, and if not uncon
stitutional its operation would permit the
passage of a bill or even the declaration of
war in the House by the votes of less
than a majority of a quorum.
"Wheeler's amendment was lost. Several
committee amendments were agreed to,
and the proposition to limit memorial ser
vices over deceased members to a series of
resolutions was voted down â 31 to 130.
The remainder of the committee amend
ments were agreed to, as follows: Making
it possible to change the rules without
previous notice; regulating the privilege
of the floor granted to representatives of
the press associations, and striking out the
regulation governing the printing of docu
ments that have been covered in the new
printing law.
A nunxber of unavailing efforts were
made by members to secure amendments
to the rules. Among them was one by
Turner (D.) of Georgia to retain the pro
vision making a majority of the whole
membership a quorum of the committee of
the whole. This had been the unvarying
rule in the history, save in the Fifty-first
Congress, when a quorum of the commit

number is incorporated in the present
code.
At 3:45 o'clock, on motion of Hender

O.V TOREIGX RELATION'S.
The Armenian and Cuban Questions Be
fore the Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.â The
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
held a special meeting this morning for
the purpose of considering the Armenian
and Cuban questions. There are more
important matters before this committee
this session than there have been in many
years, owing to the many recent foreign
complications. The Armenian question
is considered by the committee to be the
most urgent, and some means will doubt
less be devised to bring about a condition
that will afford Americans and their prop
erty better protection under the Turkish
Government. The committee nas been
flooded with petitions and memorials on
the subject. How best to meet the situa
tion is a question not easily answered.
The well-established policy of the United
States of avoiding entangling alliances
with foreign powers will be respected by
the committee.
The Cuban question is one that is also
considered by the committee as of imme
diate importance, There is no doubt the
majority of the committee is in favor of
the recognition of the Cuban insurgents as
belligerents, but the committee does not
think the time is yet ripe for such recog
nition, as the insurgents have not yet
gained the signal victory that will justify
the United States in extending to them
the recognition that will give them, so far
as this country is concerned, belligerent
rights.
Of course the Venezuelan matter has not
been lost sight of, but there appears to be
no immediate necessity for action on that
question. The appointment of the com
mission by the President is considered a
motion for a stay of proceedings pending
the finding of facts by the referees, who
htve been appointed for that purpose.
Affairs relating to Hawaii, Nicaragua,
etc., are before the committee, and several
resolutions looking to important action on
the part of this Government, especially
the resolution of Lodge directing the com
mittee to make an investigation of the re
port :hat the Danish Government ia will
ing to Bell her three islands in the Lesser
Antillesâ St. Thomas, Santa Cruz and St.
John.
The committee adjourned at 1 o'clock.
No conclusion was reached on any matter
before the committee. The Venezuelan,
Armenian and Cuban questions were dis
cussed, and there was a free interchange
of views, but no effort was made to pass
upon the subjects. They were all referred
to sub-committees, aud no report there

from will be made to the Senate until after
the next meeting.
It can be stated with positiveness that
the members of the committee are opposed
to any attempt on the part of the adminis
tration to send warships to Turkey for the
purpose of making any further demonstra
tion. It is decided that a dozen ships
could accomplish more than one, the only
merit in the presence of a ship in Turkish
waters being the flag it carries and the
moral effect its presence may produce.
All MS FOR THE MILITIA.
Stnator Hatcley'n Hill Approved by Gen-
eral Hoe.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Jan. 11.â Senator
Hawley's bill to arm the militia, which
authorizes the Secretary of War to furnish
the National Guard of the various States
with Springfield rifles of 45 caliber in ex
change for any other type of rifle now in
use has been referred to the Wai Depart
ment for an opinion as to its merits, and
Assistant Secretary Doe, who is in charge
of military matters and thoroughly ex
perienced in them, has, after careful
consideration, given the bill a strong in-
dorsement, but has suggested that it would
be of even greater benefit to the militia if its
provisions were extended so as to author
ize the exchange of new Springfield rifles
of 45 caliber for arms of the same make and
caliber already in possession of the militia,
but which have become worn out and use
less as the result of continued use.
After passing the bill as it stands it
would have been impospiblo to exchange
the old Springfield rirles held by the
militia for new ones as the exchange is
confined to arms of other make. Accord
ing to General Doe a good gun is a desider
atum to militiamen and the Government
should see that all are properly equipped
in that respect. In view of the main pur
pose of the bill it is believed that it will be
amended so as to meet the point raised by
the military authorities.
UNION PACIFIC PATENTS.
An Attempt to Secure Some In
formation Relating to Their
Suspension.
Members of the Committee Not Yet
Ready to Be Known as
"Land Agents."
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 11.-The
House Pacific Roads Committee to-day
heard E. Ellery Anderson, Government
Director of the Union Pacific Railroad, and
Wheeler H. Peckham, an attorney of New
York City, in advocacy of a resolution
calling on tne Secretary of the Interior for
information as to why land patents have
been suspended.
The committee took no action, it being
understood that Anderson would, in the
meantime, prepare a bill on this subject to
be presented to the committee when it
meets again on Monday, the 20th inst.
Ex-Representative Payson of Illinois,
representing the Central Pacific Railroad,
will appear before the committee on that
day and oppose any such resolution or bill
as proposed by the Union Pacitic. He does
not wish the impression to get abroad tbat
the Pacific Railroads Committee is acting
in the capacity of a body of "land" at
torneys for the Pacific roads, but that they
are a fair and impartial body of men.
Maguire said to-night:
"1 heard a report to-night that the Pa
cific Roads Committee had adopted a
resolution asking Secretary Smith why he
had suspended land patents to the Pacific
roads. I was astonished that this
committee would do 'such a pre
posterous thing. They have no
business looking after their land patents,
and the adoption of such a resolution
would have made them appear as 'land
agents' for Pacific roads. I learned to
night that the report was erroneous, but
that Union Pacific Director Anderson will
prepare a bill looking to the resumption of
land patents. The Central Pacific people
are smarter, however. Tneir attorney,
ex-Representative Payson, will oppose
such a measure, realizing full well that its
adoption would place the Committee on
Pacific Roads in the attitude of railroad
land agents."
Chairman Powers also stated to The
Call correspondent to-night that no such
resolution had been adopted.
TO CREATE A COMMISSION.
JÂ»l> Â» sun's Hill for Sacramento River
Improvements.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.-Repre
sentative Johnson to-day introduced a bill
to create a Sacramento River commission,
defining its powers and duties and making
appropriation therefor. It provides for a
commissionâ to be known as the Sacra
mento River Commissionâ consisting of
three members, to be appointed from the
corpa of engineers of the United States
army by the President, to hold office for a
term of four years and until their succes
sors are appointed and qualified, and any
vacancy that may occur in the commission
shall be filled in like manner.
Section 2 provides that the commission
â¢hall organize within thirty days after its
appointment by selecting from its mem
bers such officers as may be required in
the performance of its duties, and it may
at any time adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the law to govern its
deliberations and acts. No compensation
shall be allowed to the members in addi
tion to what is now allowed each, respec
tively, as an officer of the corps of enei
geers.
The commission shall have its office in
Sacramento and tho expense of maintain
ing the office shall be paid out of the
moneys appropriated.
VEFJE2SBEB OF THIS COAST.
Senator Perkins Asks Secretary Herbert
for JUoro Warships.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.-Sena
tor Perkins has prepared the following let
ter to Secretary Herbert :
To Hon. H. A. Herbert, Secretary of the Kavyâ
my Dear Sir: Recent events have caused the
people of California to study the means ol de
fense which their State now has, and to ascer
tain on wb&t they may rely for protection in
time of war. They have found that the only
vessel in the Pacific squadron of the United
States Navy is the Philadelphia. The Olympia
and Boston have been, I understand, "trans
ferred to the Asiatic station, which leaves one
flagship the only vessel in the squadron for
the protection of the Pacific Coast.
There are, however, on the coast the Mon
terey, which, it ia stated, can be placed In a
serviceable condition without much trouble or
expense, and the Monadnock aud Oregon
,wuich can booh be finished. The desire among
those who have studied the matter is that
these three vessels be attached to the Pacific
squadron, which, with the Philadelphia,
would make quite a formidable showing, and
relieve the coast of that fear which they now
have that serious trouble might find them in a
comparatively helpless condition.
We would, therefore, ask you whether the
good of the service on the Pacific Coast would
not be subserved by the addition of the vessels
named. Any action looking to improved
lueana of protection ou the Pacific Coast will
be appreciated by its people. Yours very
tru 'yÂ» George C. Perkins.
The letter will receive the signatures of
the entire coaÃt delegation in Congress.
A Land Grant Approved.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.-Tfae
Secretary of the Interior to-day approved
to the Central Pacific Railway Company,
as a successor of the California and Oregon
Railway Company, a grant in the Redding
(Cal.) land district, containing 67,784 acres
of land.
CONTRACTS FOR COAL
England Makes a Very Bold
Move on the Northern
Border.
READY FOR EMERGENCY.
Vessels May Be Supplied With
Fuel at Canadian
Ports.
MEETING OF THE COMMISSION.
Little Done Beyond Hearing Qualifica
tions of Applicants for
Positions.
SYRACUSE, N. V., Jan. 11.â A special
to the Standard from Oneida, N. V., says:
It has been learned that the English
Government has just entered into a con
tract with the oificials of the New York,
Ontario and Western Railroad for the de
livery of one million tons of coal to points
along Lake Ontario and the Canadian bor
ders.
The contracting for coal in such large
quantities is thought to have some signifi
cance when the strained relations of Great
Britain and the United States over the
Venezuelan question is taken into consid
eration.
It is thought to mean that England is to
supply her coaling vessels at Canadian
ports, if not to establish and supply new
ones in case war should ensue between the
two countries.
The New York, Ontario and Western
road is largely controlled by English capi
talists, and the placing of the contract
with them is a sort of national affair.
The railroad is now making preparations
for filling the contract, and many cars and
engines are being repaired and built.

WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 11. â The
members of the Venezuelan Commission
assembled in the diplomatic room of the
State Department at 10:30 o'clock this
morning after a recess of a week. Andrew
D. Wright, who was the only absentee at the
former meeting, was present. Justice
Brewer, president of the commission, pre
sided, and his private secretary, Frederick
.1. Haig, was temporarily installed as
clerk pending the appointment of the ex
ecutive officers and the other assistants to
be selected.
A large number of applications for em
ploy ment by the commission have been
received from stenographers, translators
and others anxious to obtain clerical em
ployment, and this morning some of these
crowded the anteroom between the office
of the Secretary of State and the diplo
matic room when the members of the
commission began their session.
J. M. Prevost, an international lawyer of
some reputation, who has been connected
with the Peralta-"Reavis case, is S3id to be
strongly booked for the principal position
which the commission will create.
The commission adjourned for the day
at 3:30 o'clock, after having been in con
tinuous session for five hours. Most of
the day was spent in examining the quali
fications of candidates for the secretaryship
and other positions, Dut no selections ware
made. The commission decided to lease
offices on the fourth floor of the Baltimore
Sun building. Until these are prepared
for use it will meet at Justice Brewer's
residence. Dr. Gilman presented to the
commission a sketch of a preliminary
physical map of the disputed territory.
with VENEZUELA DIRECT.
Thai la Mote England Intends to Settle
the Dispute.
LONDON, England. Jan. 11.â West
minister Gazette says it has reason to be
lieve that the Cabinet at its meeting to
day decided upon peaceful measures, but
favored the maintenance of the Franco-
Russian entente and the establishment of
a Russian administration of affairs in Ar
menia. '
President Cleveland's message was not
before the Cabinet, but the Cabinet was
favorable to making an effort to settle the
Venezuelan dispute with Venezuela direct,
and with a view of the accomplishment of
that object there is a good prospect of
England resuming diplomatic relations
with Venezuela through the good offices
of a certain American State, not the
United State?, however.
The foregoing is evidently merely a sur
mise on the part of the Gazette, and does
not appear to be inspired.
JV'O OPPOSITION TO ALLISON.

DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 11.â The lowa
Legislature as its first business of im
portance will elect United States^Senator
"William B. Allison to succeed himself.
The election will be on Tuesday, and
Senator Allison will be here it is expected.
It is probable the Democrats will give
their complimentary vote to Judge W. J.
Babb of Mount Pleasant, who was Demo
cratic candidate for Governor in the last
campaign. The Republicans have about
4 to 1 majority, and in their ranks there is
no opposition to Allison.
Compromiaed on Patents.
N^VARK, N. J., Jan. 11.â The legal
complications of Thomas A. Edison with
John R. Hardin, receiver of the American
Phonograph Company and various phono
graph companies with interests hinging
on Edison's claims, were ended in the
Court of Chancery this morning, when
Vice-Chancellor Emery issued an order
legalizing the compromise asked for by
Edison and the stockholders and credit
ors. The receiver gets all the oatents of
Edison in the company named and in the
Edison Phonograph Company, and Edison
is prevented from making phonographs
for any one but the receiver. The decision
is favorable to the receiver.

FEARS WERE WELL FOUNDED.
Mysterious Murder of a Man Who Was
Refused Protection by the
Authorities.
FORT SCOTT, Ka>s , Jan. 11.â Two
days ago Quill Burger, a well-known baker,
who had just returned to this city after a
long absence, sent to Sheriff Allen and
asked for protection from a man whose
name he gave as Dr. Munyard of Eureka,
Ctah. He said he had been conducting a
bakery at Eureka and that the doctor had
sworn to kill him, for which reason he
fled. Upon arriving here he discovered
that the doctor had followed him. Burger
was closely questioned by the officer, but
would not tell the nature of the trouble
that caused his apprehension of being
murdered. The Sheriff believed it an hal
lucination and assured him that nobody
would harm him.
Last evening BurgÂ«r's dead body was
found in an isolated cave in the west part
of town. His throat was cut from ear to
ear. There was no sign of a struggle, nor
could any evidence be found to indicate
that he had been killed at that spot. The
body was in a sitting posture, leaning
against the wall of the cave, and life Had
evidently been extinct twenty-four hours.
No weapon could be found to indicate sui
cide.
The city and county officers were noti
fied and have as yet been unaole to learn
who could have had any motive to murder
him. The body is in the Morgue and sen
sational developments are expected.

practically exists in the district, and this
report will fix the rate of mining at 64
cents per ton.
The uniformity prevails at 05 2-7 per
cent of the mines embraced in the district,
these mines producing 05 per cent of the
outrut of the district and em ploying about
20,000 men.

MAST FIRMS INVOLVED.
Some Extensive Failures Occur in I'/iila-
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 11.â The
Keen-Sutterle Company, extensive im
porters and dealers in glazed kid, against
which executions for $67,730 were issued
in favor of Mrs. Mary G. Forepaugh, made
an assignment to-day to the Equitable
Trust Company. Subsequently the latter
conitmny was appointed by the court as
receiver of the embarrassed concern. Mrs.
Forepaugh also entered judgment against
Frederick W. Sutterle, the head of the
company, for a similar amount. The
failure also involved John M. Fenlin, an
extensive morocco manufacturer in this
city. It is estimated that the liabilities of
the Keen-Sutterle Company will exceed
half a million dollars. Fenlin's liabilities
are about $SOOO.
The assignment of the Keen-Sutterle
Company produced a flurry on the Stock
Exchange to-day by the offering of a large
block of shares of the Choctaw, Oklahoma
and Gulf Railroad Company, which were
carried on a margin for a syndicate com
posed chiefly of the members of the Keen-
Sutterle Company. The price foil rapidly
from 11^ to 8%, but it recovered a point
before the close.
James 8. Keen, the vice-president of the
company, is reported to have stated to
day that nine house 3in the leather trade
will be involved by the failure. Another
merchant is said to have expressed the
opinion this afternoon that four firms
would be involved.
Following this failure the embarrass
ment of John A. Duncan & Co., local
morocco manufacturers, was announced.
Executions were issued against Duncan &
Co. for |35,000.

THE MOHAMMEDAN REBELLION.
An Additional Army Sent to Join
General Tung in Fighting the
Insurrectionists.
TOKIO, Japan, Dec. 27.â The ninth ses
sion of the Japanese Diet commenced on
Christmas day. Great interest attaches to
the proceedings on this occasion. For the
first time in Japanese parliamentary his
tory the Cabinet meets the Diet with
a large and openly avowed body of adher
ents in the Lower house. On the other hand
the fact that the chief political party in
the empireâ a party commanding 100 votes
out of a total of 300 in the House of Repre
sentatives â is now on the Government's
side, has induced the various sections
forming the opposition to amalgamate
into a solid union, the result being such a
close division of forces that the balance of
power rests with a small party of thirty
two members, called the National Union
ists. Victory will lie with whichever side
secures tne votes of the Jatter. The ques
tion at issue between the opposition and
the Cabinet relates to foreign policy.
It is maintained by the opposition that
the Ministry is responsible for the retro
cession of Liaotung and that the pro
gramme pursued in Korea has been alto
gether too weak.
But many national problems of vital
importance press for solution in the sequel
of the war with China â problems relating
to increase of armament, promotion of in
dustries, extension of maritime enterprise
and so forth â and it is felt that to impede
the settlement of these problems for the
sake of arraigning the acts of the Cabinet
in the past would be contrary to the in
terests of tbe empire. If the opposition
quietly voted for all the Government's im
portant bills and after the passage of these
introduced an address to the throne ar
raigning tbe Ministry, they might obtain
a majority of votes, so Btrongly developed
among the members of the lower house
is the instinct of attacking those in power.
But during a session of only three months'
duration there is always threat difficulty in
passing a number of measures through
both houses, however popular the meas
ures may me.
Hence, even though the opposition defer
their assault upon the Ministry until after
the passage of all-important measures sub
mitted to the lower house, they will still
run the risk of defeating the measures by
precipitating the dissolution of the Diet
before the upper house ha 3 had time to
conclude its deliberations. Thus the Gov
ernment virtually holdÃ command of the
situation, since it can easily contrive to
divide the work between the two houses
so that, up to the very last hour, some
thing will remain to be accomplished.
Appreciating this dilemma, the opposition
have resolved to introduce their vote of
want of confidence at an early stage of the
proceedingsâ precipitancy that will prob
ably involve defeat. Should they win the
day, whether early or late, the Cabinet is
pledged to dissolve the house and appeal
to the country, and is further pledged to
resign in the event of the constituencies'
pronouncing against it.
Considerable sensation has been caused
in Japan by Russia's action in obtaining
the port of Kiao-chow as a naval station
during winter. Kiao-chow is a spacious
bay on the southern side of the Shantung
Peninsula. A certain sinister significance
seems to attach to the presence of a Rus
sian squadron on one side of a Chinese
peninsula while a Japanese force occupies
a fortified harbor (,Wei-hai-wei) on the
other, especially in view of the fact that
Japan's occupation is temporary, being de
pendent upon the complete payment of
the war indemnity, and that the supposed
object of Russia is to extrude the Japanese
from all positions on Chinese soil. Rus
sia has succeeded in thrusting Japan out
of Liaotung and Manchuria, and it looks
as if she intended to make sure of pushing
her out of Wei-bai-wei also when the stip
ulations of the Shimonoseki treaty are ful
filled. She is gradually acquiring in the
Far East a position that cannot be viewed
with complacence either by Great Britain
or by Japan.
The threatened cabinet crisis in Japan
has passed, Marquis Ito, president of the
Cabinet, having returned to Tokio and re
sumed the duties of his post. Count Mutsu,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has been
recruiting his health for months at his sea
side villa, is now convalescent, but is not
expected to take up active duties before
April.
The commission appointed by the United
States Government to inquire into the
Szechuan outrages was reported, when last
heard from, to oe making steady progress
toward its goal, Chengtu. The journey
was estimated to last seveuty-three days.
Daring the first few weeks the commis
sioners rode on horseback ; then they used
mule-litterÃ and subsequently sedan chairs.
One account says that they have met with
great civility ana helpfulness from all
Chinese officials en route, but another al
leges that they have had to endure studied
neglect and insults.

The people of Hunan have emphasized
their anti-foreign sentiment by issuing a
proclamation for the purpose of prevent
ing any sales of land to French mission
aries or Japanese, who are supposed to be
about to visit the province. The procla
mation emanates from the seven co.leges
of literature in Changsba. It threatens
severe punishment for any persons sell
ing land to foreigners, and promises a re
ward of ten string of cash to any one
giving information of intended or com
pleted sales, the reward to be increased by
half of the price paU for the land in tnÂ«
event of an actual sale, the other half
going to the public funds. That such a
proclamation should be suffered to circu

the temper of ollicialdom in Hunan.
Peking is said to be full of foreigners of
all nationalities, who have gone there to
bid for some of the work-railways, ships,
arsenals, dockyards, loan's, and so forthâ
that China is supposed to be about to un
dertake in her era of awakening. But as
yet no one has succeeded in obtaining an
order.
It is alleged that owing to dissensions
between the two official parties in Peking,
the Emperor's party, headed by Weng
Tung-ho, and the Empress' party, headed
Li Hung Chung, there is no chance what
ever for railway building or of reform.
The Emperor has just dismissed from of

with using language calculated to estrange
his Maiesty and the Empress Dowager.

any doubt that the women of China are
opposed to the custom of binding. Sev
eral have already agreed to give it up, and
none oppose the movement for abolishing
it, though there is a general opinion that
nothing can be achieved hastily.
In spite of the strong efforts made to
secure the execution of justice in the case
of the Kucheng outrages, and in spite of
the apparent success of those efforts, as
evidenced by a number of capital punish
ments, there is no doubt tnat a large num
ber of men implicated more or less directly
in the brutal massacre remain scot free.
Investigations conducted in loco by the
Foreign Commission of Inquiry resulted
in the preparation of a list of 105 names of
persons conclusively shown to have taken
part in the tragedy. Of these eleven only
have been punished by sentences of im
prisonment. The rest have never been
apprehended. The list here referred to
was compiled from the testimony of wit
nesses, who, though fully cognizant of the
facts to which they testified, could not,
for various reasons, appear before tne Chi
nese officials. It is in fact a list supple*
mentary to that drawn up by the officials.
It was formally sent to the Taotai of Foo
chow, who promised to dispatch deputies
to search for the ninety -four unpunished
persons. The promise was given at the
end of October, but remains apparently as
far from fulfillment as ever.
The sum total of the punishments mete-i
out by the Chinese Government in connec
tion with tbe Szechuan anti-missionary
riots is that six of the riotors were decapi
tated, seventeen sentenced to banishment,
tae cangue or the bamboo, and nine local
magistrates, expectant Taotai?, ictir
fects, etc., have been removed from office
or otherwise penalized. Considering that
no foreign lives were lost in the riots the
above is not an unsatisfactory record.
General E, the Tartar, of whom so much
was heard during tbe war in Machuria
last year, has received a reprimand from
the throne. The gallant officer's offense is
of a peculiar character â fahe modesty. He
presented a memorial declaring that his
incapability, mediocrity and other defects
disqualified him to accept the post of
Tartar-General of Foochow. The Emperor
practically says to him: "Go o, thou
bashful fellow."

LONDON. Eng., Jan. 11.-The German
Emperor continues to De uppermost in the
British minds. This sedate and some
what cumbrous organism now and again
directs itself toward Dr. Jameson or I
dent Krueger, or even Mutters briefly in the
direction of Washington, but it reverts al
ways to the Kaiser. Although a week has
elapsed, its anger burns brighter than
ever, but its bewilderment has also in
creased. It still hesitates at the dilemma
of deciding whether he is a mere irre
sponsible crank or a deliberate assailant.
Most of what happened in Germany dur
ing the week seems to support the former
theory.
There has been a complete lack of
official or political demonstrations of a de
sire to emphasize the truculent tone of the
Emperor's famous dispatch, and, on the
other hand, from Bismarck down, every
body of importance who lias made a sign
at all has shown tbe desire to read into it
something and add pacific meanings. It
is obvious that official word was sent
round to the papers Monday to stop shout
ing, and to say that the Knglish were mis
taken in supposing that the telegram had
c truculent intention.
Let'.ers from Germany, too. began to
ernve, saying that the fact that the Kaiser
showed the message to the Ministers be- '
fore ?enriiiiL r it was of no such significance
as the English might imagine, because he
had his Ministers in such a state of cring- j
ing subjection that they did not dream of
dissenting from anything that he showed j
them, and now confine their services to
the state* entirely to going round cau
â â â  after him and undoing as much of
the mischief he had wrought as was pos
sible. Still later there seemed to be cer
tain signs that the Emperor himself was
frightened at what he had done and was
willing to let others patch up the best
sort of apology for his haste that they
could manage.
To-day's reports that he has written a
contrite letter to his royal grandmother fit
this theory that he is anxious to quiet the
Ptorm that his action has raised, and if
that is really the case the English will
find satisfaction in the feeling that nis own i
7"opie will punish him in good time for
Buch recklessness or levity.

going on outside of Germany suggests
much method in this young man's mad
ness. It is not disputed that his govern
ment sounded that of Portugal last weeic
on the question of the right of way for
Germany to force through from Delagoa
Bay to the Transvaal. This in itself con
stitutes an unfriendly act. which no Eor
eign Office can ignore. Again it is plain
that President Krueger at Pretoria is being
advised from Berlin, where iiis Secretary
of State is closeted daily with the Em
peror and Hohenlohe.
It is known by long and costly expe
rience that Krueger is an exceedingly able
man, who needs no mental help from any
body in Germany or elsewhere. He will
not refuge to pick the plums out of what
ever cake is offered to him, but he will by
no means commit himself to >'at it all. He
would not suffer Germany to dictate any
thing to him, and his close, constant in
tercourse with Berlin can mean only that
he has some plan by which Germany can
serve him. England asks itself at once
what that plan may be, and these seems
to be an obvious answer.
Krueger has already in hand some large
advantage? over England. He holds
proofs of the chartered company's scoun
drelly plot to overrun the republic, and
has a score of its chief men in Africa in
jail on the charge of high treason. He
has the Boers all armed and spoiling for a
fight and the cowardly Uitlanders dis
armed and blanched in terror. He has a
string tied even to Dr. Jameson, and thus
he sits waiting for England to explain
what she proposes to do in the way of
apologizing for and punishing her free
booters, ransoming her stock-jobbing Uit
lander traitors and recompensing the
Boers for their trouble and expense. It is
hardly doubted that he has demanded a
higher price than England is willing to
pay, and then Krueger i 3 expected to say
that under the circumstances he must ap
peal to the general opinion of Europe and
ask Germany's aid in laying his hard case
before the assembled nations in a confer
ence which might, also, while it is about
it, discuss Egypt and other Anglo-African
questions.
It was with this probable sequence of
events plainly in view that England
swiftly called out what officials describe
as the particular squadron, but what every
naval man calls the North Sea fleet. The
perfect facility with which this operation
was performed has swelled every British
bosom with pride, and the statement that
three more such extra fleets can be got to
getner in a week, if necessary, makes the
whole island beam with self-satisfaction.
It was a stupid lie to say that a London
crowd had insulted and shown violence to
German residents here, but it is wholly
true that England ia a unit on the ques
tion of blowing Germany out of the water
if she insists on interfering in South
Africa. It is apparent that the Germans
more or less realize this fact and respect it.
It remains to be seen if their Emneror also
grasps it. If he should feel bound to go
ahead it is already clear that nothing
short of >\ recession of Alsace and Lorraine
would guarantee his immunity from at
tack on the French frontier. This, we
may assume, he could not discuss with
the Germans or even with himself.
Italy is very sick aDout the whole thing.
Austria is doubtful and suspicious and
Russia remains as usual inscrutable. It is
believed here that she is tacitly encourag
ing William to adventurous courses. If he
were smashed in the process and his em
pire who him Russia would profit rather
than lose by the fact, and meanwhile
would enjoy a free hand to prosecute her
own enterprises in the Levant and far East
without effective English resistance. This
consideration inclines the English Foreign
OtJiee to suspect St. Petersburg of egging
on Berlin.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 1896.
An English officer who returned from
China a fortnight ago tells me that it is
well known there that the Russians are
busily at work on a railroad which is to
run from Nermschinsk across the Siberian
frontier to the Manchurian town of Tsitso
kar, thence in two branches to Vladivo
stok and the Pechili Gulf. He says, more
over, that of his own knowledge the Lon
don officials are perfectly aware of what is
being done.
It will he remembered that when the
rumor of this intention came from Hong
kong last summer, and the English
showed that they would resist by force any
such attempt, the Russian diplomats dis
avowed the design in most forma! and
explicit fashion. The Duke of Westmin
ster is so close to Lord Salisbury that his
public denunciation of Russia as respon
sible for the failure to do anything further
for the Armenians becomes almost an
official utterance. This consciousness that
Russia was the real stumbling-block has
been slowly forming in the British mind,
but the Duke is the first one in semi-au
thority who has said so. It may be
doubted, too, if he would have been so
frank had Lord Salisbury not become con
vinced that Russia was definitely hostile
to England elsewhere than on the Levant.
Under these circumstances there is some
loose talk here about trying to make a
Russian alliance.
English sentiment, however, is over
whelmingly against such an attempt.
The English would rather have the Rus
sians take Germany's side than their own,
for they instinctively feel that they would
have to fight Russia afterward, anyway,
and that to fight two empires at once
would give to them the sympathy of
Western Europe and of the world in gen
eral.
As to tbe strictly British aspects of the
South African maelstrom strange rumors
are current in the city and filtering
through clubiand. It i< said that Cecil
Rhodes has commanded that $500,000,000
be put up by a syndicate here for the pur
pose of rushing the Transvaal, overwhelm
ing the Orange Free State, declaring a
federation of all South Africa, and if Eng
land refused recognition cutting the
painter off-hand. He resigned the premier
ship before the news of Jameson's raid was
published in Cape Town, solely to be free
for this enterprise. Four days ago friends
of his here were qnietlv giving out word
that he would be President of the South
African republic by midsummer. Whether
the seizure of his brother with Leonard,
Phillips, Dunbar and the rest has quite
knocked the bottom out of this project is
uncertain, but that it existed is, I am told,
beyond question.
If the German complication blows over
there are likely to be revelations of finan
cial and political corruption underlying
thi< whole affair which will dwarf any
thing of the kind in history.
Chamberlain meanwhile has made the
greatest personal score of a generation. He
carries himself like a second Oliver Crom
well and the whole nation gapes at him in
dumb admiration. To-day's Cabinet coun
cil, which was the first since autumn,
briefly recalled to the public the existence
of other Ministers, but by to-morrow it
will be again Chamberlain first and the
re>t nowhere. Bave for a list of â¢ official
denials that the situation in the Transvaal
is worse, which may mean anything, it is
useless to expect that any news will leak
out about the Cabinet meeting or its de
cisions until they are exhibited inaction,
Discussion about Venezuela in the pa
pers is still of great bulk, but it manifestly
proceeds under the disadvantage that the
public is thinking of something else. Such
few expressions of racial sympatny for
England and her Continental trouble as
have been perm itted to get across the wire
from America have been eagerly seized
upon and reprinted and until to-day the
advocates of some large and comprehensive
arrangement for a permanent arbitration
tribunal have been having things much
their own way in the press.
To-day the Times, however, feels im
pelled to call these people amiable vision
aries, and compliments its New York cor
respondent on having poured on them
such a wholesome shower of cold water.
The dispatch alluded to explains at a
column's length all the minute difficul
ties in the way of such an arrangement.
This criticism is useful, no doubt, but
Lord Playfair much better reflects the
spirit of the hour, at least over here, by
more than a column of warm advocacy of
the general principle, which he does not
doubt, if once accepted, will readily sub
ordinate minor difficulties to their proper
place. Even the Times reiterates its call
for official papers on the boundary dis
pute, and also suggests that if President
Cleveland had asked for one arbitration up
to the Schomburg line, with the proviso
that if Venezuela won this England would
then consent to a second arbitration as
to that line itself, it would not have been
refused, but the whole debate is getting so
much in the air that it is hardly worth
while to follow its development.
A month from to-day, when Parliament
meets, there will be something tangible
from the British official point of view to
consider, and probably not before.
The arrest of Little Rosenthal, who by
the sheer vitality and energy of his native
impudence has been able to impose him
self on Le Figaro and on Parisian journal
ism generally as an authority on foreign
politics, creates a great stir in Paris, but
need scarcely be a surprise. For a long
time I have been told this Jacques St. Cere
was swimming in queer waters and ulti
mately would be landed high ana dry. It
may bY that there are some honest anti-
English journalists in Paris, but it has
come to be the rule that the more violently
a Parisian writes and assails England the
more certain he is to turn up as a black
mailer and the creature of thieving syndi
cates.
It is understood that someothers equally
well known have been dipping their rin
gers in poor Max Lebaudy's millions, and
I hear also that the Dossier of the journal
ists who have been levying blackmail on
Monte Carlo are also in the hands of the
authorities, and this contains a very noble
name, indeed. With these rumors added
to the approaching opening of the Panama
lists, it may be understood why the Bour
geois Ministry continues to hold more
than its own.
Although Paul Verlaine lived in his
most mature years as a social outcast, his
funeral was attended by a distinguished
literary assemblage, including many
academicians, and Francois Coppee spoke
over his tomb of his immortality being
more certain than theirs. In England
tliis could not have happened, because a
man of genius here must also be respect
able. Respectability has its penalties none
the lens.
To-day England has read with literal
amazement eight doggerel stanzas by the
new i>oet laureate on Jameson's ride,
which fail beneath the level of ordinary
country weeklies' rhymes. The poem is
in outrageous taste from a public point of
view, but that is less noticeable than its
grotesque literary demerits. It turns the
author's appointment into a national hu
miliation before it is a fortnight old, and
already the radical wags have shaped
questions from it to ask of Balfour when
Parliament meets. Harold Fkkdsbio.

KAISER WILLIAM COOL
Not Disturbed by Diatribes
of the English Press
and People.
APPEABS INDIFFERENT.
Does Not Believe There Is Any
Possibility of War With
Great Britain.
EXCHANGE OF COMMUNICATIONS
Disagreements Not Regarded Serious
Enough to Cause a Clash Between
the Two Nations.
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 11.â The whole
tone of the information that is capable of
being gleaned from Government papers
points to an early restoration of amicable
relations between Germany and England.
If the Emperor, his Ministers or the Ger
man people were influenced in the least
by the savage and unrestrained language
indulged in by the English newspapers, as
shown by the summaries of their articles
telegraphed here, an open rupture between
the two Governments might be imminent.
But the Kaiser has for a longtime recog
nized the irresponsibility of the diatribes
of the English press and the English
peoole, and, though he is deeply irritated
thereat, he does not seem to believe that
there is any possibility whatever of an
outbreak of war between Germany and
Great Britain over such a question as that
involved in the Transvaal disturbances.
If the Emperor has any motives beyond
mere interference in behalf of a Govern
ment asking his assistance in prevailing
against an alien revolution and for the
purpose of protecting German interests,
there is no indication here that would
afford the slightest clew to them.
The semi-official newspapers discuss the
question of the isolation of England, but
they make not the slightest allusion to
any alliance against Great Britain which
the French and English press regard as
being projected.
In Berlin the tone of the Foreign Office
concerning the excitement of the English
press and public and the English naval
demonstrations and exhibition of sea
strength is not really akin to contemptu
ous indifference. There is a constant ex
change of communications between the
two Governments, with a consequent dis
closure of a difference of policy at various
points of contact apart from the Trans
vaal; but none of these disagreements in
volve such a radical disturbance of the re
lations of tne two powers as would call for
an increase of armament on either side.
In ofticiul circles the view taken of Lord
Salisbury's fleet demonstrations is that the
English Premier is playing to the mob
and that his attitude cannot mean an at
tempt to influence the policy of the Em
peror, who, Lord Salisbury well knows,
will take its development unaffected in the
slightest degree by menaces or demonstra
tions from any quarter.
The Nortti German Gazette prints an
article which is obviously inspired and
which reiterates the German contention
that the South African republic under the
convention of 1884 was no longer subject to
the suzerainty of the British Government,
toria, and as proof of this assertion calls
attention to the fact that since 1884 the
Transvaal Government has appointed En
voys and Consuls to foreign states without
consulting the Government of Great
Britain, and the Boer Government also
sent a delegate as an independent power
to the International Postal Congress at
Vienna without the slightest complaint
from England that such a proceeding on
the part of the Transvaai Government was
in excess of its authority and an infringe
ment upon the rights of Great Britain.
The semi-ofh'cial press generally refrains
from any expansive comment upon the
war preparations which the English Gov
ernment is so ostentatiously making, but
the journals which are freehanded and
not hampered by any official obligations
or connections do not.
The Vossische Zeitung asks the ques
tion: "Whom is England threatening,
Germany or the Transvaal republic?"
The National Zeitung attaches no spe
cial importance to England's naval dem
onstrations, but suggests that the Govern
ment ought to ask the meaning of them,
nevertheless.
The Tageblatt says it is understood that
Count yon Hatzfeldt, German Embassador
to Great Britain, has been instructed by
the German Government to inform Lord
Salisbury that these manifestations are
supposed to be directed against Germany
and are likely to provoke serious conse
quences.
Tlie Boersen Courier concludes that the
English excitement baa well nigh fizzled
out and the crisis is drawing to an end,
everything tending toward peace.
Apart from Prussian opinions, which
the Kaiser unquestionably represents, the
sentiment pervading the whole of the Ger
man States continues to uphold the Em
peror's action in interfering in the Trans
vaal, and it would be a bitter national dis
appointment if the Imperial Government
should retire a single step from the posi
tion it originally assumed. The entire
press of Bavaiia, Saxony and Wurtemberg
and even the Gotha Gazette and the Co
burg Gazette, the official organs of the
Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Duke of
Edinburgh) are warm in ttie approval of
the course the Emperor has taken, though
from no quarter is war advocated.
The National Zeitung accurately reflects
the universal feeling upon the continuance
of good relations between Germany and
England, saying that Germany would be
found oftener than hitherto allied with
England's opponents in disputes affecting
English interests until the British Govern
ment shows itself convinced that Ger
many's friendship is more desirable than

CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT
Chicago's Citizens Determined to

Affairs Run by a Machine and Alder

Their Votes.
CHICAGO, Iti... Jan.H.â A meeting of
250 of Chicago's most prominent citizens
was held to-day to devise means for purg
ing the city government of corruption. It
was agreed to forn. a municipal league, and
at a meeting which is to be held next
Saturday, it is expected a new and inde
pendent party will be formed.
The general sentiment seemed to be that
the affairs of the city are run by a machine;
that the City Aldermen make a business
of selling their votes in the City Council,
and that the entire municipal government
is rotten all the way through.
It is believed that the committee will
recommend the formation of a separate
and distinct party to take the affairs of the
city in its own hands.

Four Youths Arrested for

Grocery.
STAMPS CARRIED AWAY.
Precocious Youngsters Who Have
Evoked the Wrath of
Uncle Sam.
FACING THE PENITENTIARY.
Partiality to Sweetmeats Gave an
Officer a Clew that Landed Them
in Jail.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Tan. 11.â A quar
tet of precocious youngsters were delivered
into the hands of United States authorities
by the Sheriff this morning. They are
Daniel Crandall, Joseph Szarfarinski, Jo
seph Kasisgorch and Bert Hill.
These Doys live in Pico Heights and
have been a terror to that community for
many a moon. Their ages vary from 13
summers, seen by the youngest, to 15, the
oldest.
The Pico Heights postofftce was entered
and robbed Tuesday night. As the post
office is located in a grocery store, the boys
not only meddled with the effects of Uncle
Sam, but concerned themselves with the
property of the grocer.
At first it was supposed that the burg
lary was committed by professional cracks
men, but Under Sheriff Clement, on inves
tigating and finding broken pieces of
candy and sweetmeats lying about in con
fusion and profusion, jumped at the con
clusion that the burglary was the work of
boys, and very bad boys at that.
Just before the Federal authorities took
charge of him this morning, Joseph
Szarfarinski intimated to Sheriff Russ that
he desired to make a confession. This he
proceeded to do in writing, and impli
cated the balance of the quartet. The
theft of the stamps is a serious offense
against the Government, and will likely
send the boys to the penitentiary.
RECEITED FATAL BVRXS.
A Woman's Costly Attempt to Save Valu
aliles From fire.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 11.â An
alarm of fire turned in from the p]aza this
afternoon called the department to a
hou?eat22o MarchessauU street, kept by
a woman known as May Williams.
The blaze in itself was insignificant and
was speedily extinguished. It is supposed
that hot sun revs ignited some matches
lying on the window-sill, the lace curtains
caught fire and scorched the walls and
damaged the furniture.
If that were all the loss would scarcely
be worth the telling, but May Williams
herself, in her efforts to save some valu
ables she thought were in danger, was
burned so severely that it seems almost
certain that she cannot survive.
The woman was in the hands of a hair
dresser when a man rushed to the house
and said smoke was coming from one of
the windows. She rushed to the room in
dicated and saw the curtains and the
lounge underneath the window in flames.
Desiring to save a small desk containing
all her papers and jewelry, she attempted
to drag it out of the room. While doing
so a bottle of lucine that was standing on
the top of the desk exploded, drenchin-
her dress with the liquid.
The flirnes seemed to leap to the iicht
material of which her clothing was com
posed, and in an instant they enveloped
her. She rushed into the hall, and the
colored servant had wit enough to snatch
up a rug and wrap it about the agonized
woman.
A doctor was speedily in attendance,
and found that the lower portion of her
face and her entire body was badly burned.
It is extremely improbable that the suf
ferer can last many hours, much less re
cover from the terrible shock in addition
to the terrible burns received.
SONOMA COUNTY'S GOLD
District Attorney Butts Says
Treasurer Woodward Must
Guard It.
Supervisors Have the Power to Erect
New Vaults to Contain the
Public Moneys.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. 11.â Assistant
District Attorney Butts filed with the
Board of Supervisors to-day a â written
opinion defining the powers of the board
in regard to taking steps for the future
safety of public money. County Treasurer
Woodward had applied to the board for
relief in the matter, suggesting three plans,
viz.: To hire guards and keep the money
in the county safe; to make arrangements
with some local bank to receive the funds
as special deposits; or improve the
present vault or build a new one that
would afford safe protection for money in
the Treasurer's charge.
The opinion holds that the board has no
authority either to hire euards or make
arrangements with a banking institution.
"The law is just the same now," it de
clares, "as when the Treasurer took his
oath of office. At that time he agreed to
safely care for funds intrusted to his keep
ing, and if guards are hired or arrange
ments made with banks it must be at the
Treasurer s expense and not at the
county's."
Regarding the third plan, the District
Attorney say 3 the board has full power to
erect a new vault or remodel the "old one.
or take any steps the board may see tit to
afford proper protection to the county's
treasure.

School Trustee Meinlnger Requested to
Resign From Office. . V
MOUNT EDEN, Cal., Jan. 11.-The
charges made by School Trustee Meinin
jrer in The Call of January 3, in which he
stated that the recent indignation mass
meeting and re-election of Mr. Rowlands
as principal of the Mount Eden school were
part of a conspiracy to ruin him politically ;
that Mr. Rowlands fought him and did his
best to defeat him at the last June elec
tion for Trustee, and that Mr. Rowlands
spent much time loitering about saloons,
was the subject of censuring resolutions
adopted at a mass-meeting of citizens held
here on January 5, when Trustee Mein
m^er was requested to resign.
The resolutions recite that the "taxpay
ers of this district and patrons of the
school, in mass meeting assembled, do de
clare tne above charges false and untrue,
and are made by Mr. Meininser to gratify
Ins personal spite against Mr. Rowlands
and to ruin his character if he can, and is
an insult to the people of this community,
more than nine-tenths of whom signed a
petition requesting the Trustees to retain
Mr. Rowlands as teacher, and who we
declare would not have attached their
names to that petition had he been guilty
of loitering about saloons."
Continuing, it is resolved that "we de
clare Mr. Meininger as School Trustee
does not represent the interests of his con.
stituents, and request that he resign his
oliice."

hto, but he is instructed to keep Rear Ad
miral Beardslee, at San Diego with the
flagship Philadelphia, constantly advised
regarding the movemen's of the monitor,
and the progress made in the matter of
shipping men for her. It is probable that
the Monterey will join the Admiral at San
Diego just as soon as the men are shipped.
The monitor is fitted up with provisions
for a Jong season out, and has put on
board 180 tons extra of picked coal. No
one is aware of her destination after leav
ing San Francisco or San Diego. Her
commander, Captain Theodore Kane, is
on the sick list, and she will go to San
Francisco Bay under command of Lieu
tenant-Commander A. V. \Vadham, who
is a thorough naval officer. On or about
the Ist of the month Captain Kane will
be relieved of his command by Captain
Harrington.
The monitor is in first-class fighting con
dition, with a crew pdtnposed of men who
understand all the working machinery
and various parts of the ship to perfection.
PREDICTED AT BTOCKTOX.
Ab Surprise Occasioned by the Retiring of
Superintendent Wilbur.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 11.-The an
nouncement to-day that John S. Wilbur
had been superseded by W. C. Ead3 as
superintendent ot construction of the Val
ley railroad occasioned no surprise here,
as the friction between Mr. Wilbur and
Henry Vogelsang was expected to culmi
nate in trouble for the superintendent.
Since Mr. Vogelsang was discharged from
the road by Mr. Wilbur^iis friends have
been active in his behalf, and the puperin
tendent's animosity to the engineer was so
marked as to lead many familiar with the
situation to conclude that personal prefer
ences had a great deal to do with the
make-up of the personnel of the forces
working under Mr. Wilbur.
Since the last visit of the Valley railroad
directors to this city a quiet investigation
into the workings of the hoadquarters
here has been going on and it is evident
that Mr. Wilbur's course in discharging
Mr. Vogelsang so summarily was not ap
proved. Mr. Wilbur has been an ener
getic worker and has accomplished a great
deal of work in a snort time. He declines
to discuss the reasons for his discharge
and says he will step out at once.
This was pay day in the various depart
ments of the Valley railroad and over $8000
was distributed among tne men. All time
checks were honored at par value and
some very lively times are to be seen in
the city to-night and in the various camps
along the line of the railroad.
AEEDLES GOL*T> STRIKE.
Remarkable fin* Reported from the
Queen of the Aight Mine.
NEEDLES, Cal., Jan. 11.â The Needles
Eye to-day said: While James Patton
and Al Powell were doing sonfe develop
ment work on the Queen of the Night
mine they opened a very rich vein of free
quartz and free gold. "The gold runs
through the quartz, very few barren spots
to be seen. Nothing of the kind has ever
been found here since the district was
formed. The celebrated Montgomery dis
trict can't surpass this ore. The quartz is
what mining men call "healthy 1^ quartz,
and old-timers "hamfat." The lowest
estimate of the ore is $1000. and some put
it at $20,000 per ton. The owners feel
Jubilant over their find, and well they may.
They are worthy of it and will soon be on
"velvet." It is a good thing for the camp.
It makes the outlook encouraging.

JOY AT SACRAMENTO
Southern Pacific Engineers
Triumph Over Mr.
Fillmore.
HIS RULING REVERSED.
General Manager Kruttschnitt
Observes a Brotherhood
Decision.
YIELDS TO THE EMPLOYES.
A Final Settlement of the Engineer
Stevens Case Has Been
Reached.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 11.â The
Sunday News will print the following to
morrow: J. A. Fillmore of ths Southern
Pacific has been overruled and the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Engineers has
thereby eaineil a signal victory. It was all
done by General Manager Kruttschnitt.
Last August a misunderstanding arose
between the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and Fillmore over the latter's
action in placing Engineer Stevens on a
run to which, under the laws of the brother
hood, he was not entitled. It seems that
Stevens had abandoned his run out of Sac
ramento for a position on the new coast
division.
Under the recognized rules he thereby
forfeited his place on the rolls here of engi
neers eligible to promotion. But Stevens
returned and, making application, was
duly reinstated on his old run, in direct
contravention of the old rule.
When complaint was made to Mr. Fill
more it is said that he tola the committee
that the railroad company was hiring men
as it pleased and that therefore it proposed
to keep Stevens in the position to which
ho had last been assigned.
The engineers were never satisfied with
this, and delegates from the brotherhood
were called from different parts of the
country to endeavor to induce the corpor
ation to overrule Filimore's decision. It
is claimed that Fillmore was upheld in his
action by A. N. Towne, but upon the ad
vent of Kruttschnitt there was a renewed
effort to effect a reconsideration of the
former decision.
The new railroad manager seems to be a
favorite with such employes as have had
personal relations with him. Unlike Fill
more, he is willing to listen to reason and
give patient hearing to the men. He heard
the statements of the engineers and then
decided that the old rule should be upheld
to the letter.
This decision was forthwith forwarded
to Sacramento, and Mr. Stevens, whose
ability, by the way, as an engineer was
never brought into question, was ordered
back to his coast run. His place here wbb
then tilled in the regular order of succes
sion, nnd all is again serene in that de
partment of railroading.
Kruttschnitt has suddenly leaped to a
place in the esteem of the railroad work
ers and the whole affair has promoted a
better feeling between employer and em
ploye.

WELLINGTON DYNAMITERS.
George Graham Confesses to Complicity in
the Blowing Up of a Resi
dence.
VICTOKIA, B. C, Jan. 11.âSuperin
tendent Hussey of the Provincial Police
returned from Union this afternoon, where
he had been investigating a report received
by him from Detective Ellis respecting the
statement of a miner named George Gra
ham. The miner's story was to the effect
that the explosion which destroyed the
residence of Alexander Sharp at Welling
ton on March 13, 1894, was caused oy four
miners who came down from Union a few
days before that date. It is almost certain
that had Sharp been sitting in the front
part of the house, as was his usual custom,
he would have been instantly killed.
Informant Graham is personally impli
cated to some extent with the four dyna
miters. He stated he was present when
the explosion toolc pjace and was within
100 yards of the premises, and that he
knew the persons concerned, though he
had nothing to do with the discharge of
the bomb.
Ellis communicated with Constable
Hutcheson, who in turn laid the matter
before (Superintendent Hussey. Before
the latter arrived the Union informant be
came alarmed at the possible consequences
of the confession and. was making active
preparations to leave when arrested with
another miner named Allen, apprehended
at the same time on suspicion of com
plicity in the outrage. The evidence of
Detective Ellis was taken last nisht, and
both Graham and Allen were remanded
for eight days pending further inquiry.
Graham is said to have given away the
identity of the persons connected with
the plot.

The Steamer George W. Elder Driven Ashore
and Disabled During a
Squall.
PORTLAND, On., Jan. 11.â A serious ac
cident has happened to the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company's steamer
\V. Elder, which left yesterday for
Ban Francisco, and she is now returning
to Portland in tow of the steamers Okla
homa and Harvest Queen for repairs.
It appears that the pilot. Marsnall Mar
ix, on reaching a point opposite
Jast night, decided to anchor
; roceed on down to the mouth of the
river in the morning. The night was very
dark, with a heavy northerly wind blow-
ing, and the pilot decided to take in under
the lee of the Washington shore. On
reaching what he consi lered a proper an
chorage the order to let go the ground
tackle was given.
Haiuly had the steamer swung up on
her scope of chain before a squall struck

On an examination beins made it was
found that the gudgeons of the rudder had
been carried away, and the rudJer dis

PORT TOWNSEXD, Wash., Jan. 11.â
Th-2 .â¢-hip Waenusetts, with coal from
Nanaimo for San Francisco, which sprung
a leak and came near going down off Cape
Flattery ten days ago ami then put back
to Port Angeles, is having trouble getting
a crew for the voyage south. The mem
bers of the crew claim the ship is leaking
to a depth of eighteen inches every four
hours, and several of them deserted her
rather than risk the trip. Steward Busby,
â¢who has been with the Wachusetts eight
months, came here co-nay to advise sailors
who ha 1 promised to sign of her condi
tion, and he says she will not reach San
Francisco unless she has an exceptionally
smooth voyage. Her agents are trying to
sign six extra men to work at the pumps
on the trip.
SAN DIEGANS MAY WIN
Company A Guardsmen Likely to
Become an Independent
Organization.
Allowed to Retain Their Equipments
Pending Action by the Board of
Location.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 11.â It was sup
posed last night when thirty-eight mem
ben of Company A, old Ninth Kegiment,
N. G. C, marched down to Company B's
armory that the consolidation of the two
companies was practically effected. But
it appears that a hitch has occurred.
This morning two trucks and four men
were sent out to the National-avenue
Armory, in compliance with previous ar
ments, to get the equipments of
Company A aud transfer them to Com
pany B's armory.
Before anything was done, however,
Captain Dodee of Company B received an
order from Assistant Ad jutant Alfonso at
Los Angeles notifying him that he had
just receive 1 , a telegram from Adjutant
cieneral Barrett to have all the property of
Company A remain intact until further or
ders were received from Sacramento.
The property was, therefore, left at
Company A'b armory, for although it had
been already formally turned over to Cap
tain Dod-re, he did not care to take pos
session when another ordej might come at
any time ordering him ufreturn it.
Captain Dodge says he does not exactly
understand the order, but that he believes
it means that the Board of Location will
soon decide whether Company A is to be
retainer as an independent company in
the service of the State.
This, as has previously been stated, is
what Colonel Spileman, commanding the
old Ninth, and his son, Captain Spileman,
of Compcny A, have been working for. An
officer of Company A seen this afternoon
wa- very jubilant over the order, and said
there was no doubt that the company
would be permitted to remain in the ser
vice as an independent company.

Miss Middlenusw came here two weeks
ago for chance of scene. She was invited
by tiie Farqunars to visit them in order to

during a moment of irrepressible melan
choly she made an attempt to end her life.
This is the second time she has tried to

Famous Divorce
Suit.
The Woman to Whom Stewart Deeded
the Estate Must Surrender
Her Title.
SANTA CRVZ, Cal., Jan. 11.â The case
of Elizabeth R. Stewart vs. John R.
Stewart and Catherine McKenzie et a!.,
which has beea in the courts of this county
for the past three years and has occupied
weeks at a time, was decided to-lay by
i Judge Breen. The action was in
stituted by the plaintiff to sever
the bonds of matrimony existing between
j her and the defendant, John A. Stewart.
She also sought to control the legal title to
certain property alleged to belong to the
community, but standing on record in the
name of Catherine McKenzie.
In his findings Judge Breen says the
personal history of the Stewarts shows
them to be persons of intelligence, liberal
education and well-established social po
sition, and that the four children are not
inferior in that respect to the parents.
Threeof the children are in California, two
ofwiiOin, the sons, espoused their mother's
cause and the daughter their father's.
In the wife's petition Catherine McKenzie
was named as co-respondent.
The plaintiff claims that the defendant,
John A. Stewart, is the son of John &nd
Mary Stewart; that his father was an offi
cer in the British army, stationed at Malta
when John was born. In infancy he was
taken to Corfu, Greece, thence to Aber
nathy, Scotland, and was sent to Edin
burgh to be educated for a medical mis
sionary. While pursuing his studies he
met the plaintiff, a maiden 16 years of age
of good social position, and married her
ten years later. While on his vacation
preceding his marriage he visited the
Isle of Skye, where he was engazed in
teaching, and there lived with Peter Mc-
Caskil), whose eldest child was Mrs. Cath
erine McKenz'.e (nee McCaskiil), a girl of
tender years. Peter and his daugher Cath
erine went to Edinburgh, and Stewart
went with thsm. He was to supervise her
education. It is claimed that at this time
his relations with the girl were more than
those of a friend. He offered to marry
her. but was refused.
Having graduated as a physician Stew
art married the plaintiff, went to Foo
chow, China, to reside, and amassed quite
a fortune from the practice of medicine.
Here their children were born, and they
Jived happily for eleven years. In 187(5 the
plaintiff returned to Europe to educate
her children. The husband speedily fol
lowed and remained with the lamily one
month. While in Glasgow he again met
Catherine McCaskiil. who in the meantime
had been married and was the mother of
j several children. Stewart and .Mrs. Mc
i Kenzie crossed the Atlantic, she being en
route to Boston and he for China via .the
United States. According to an under-
I striding they met in Santa Cruz and es
| tablished themselves on a fruit ranch
' known as Etha Hill and belonging to Dr.
j Stewart. There they resided together.
Mr.-. Stewart claimed a plan was con
cr ctei between them to defraud her of her
rights and that Stewart executed and de
livered to Mrs. McKenzie a conveyance of
certain land. She, ignorant of the infidel
ity of her husband, came to Santa Cruz in
l^'l to join him, and on meeting Stewart
after an eight years' absence was received
coldly, repulsed, ill treated and was con
si rained to join him in the execution of
articles* of separation.
On the other hand, John Stewart claimed
that he was a brother of Mrs. Catherine
MrKenzie. He claimed he lived with his
mother until 12 years of age, and was then
tak.cn to John and Mary Stewart, who
adopted him in place of a dead son, giving
him the son's name. At 16 year-: of aj;e
he returned to his real father. Here he
first met Catherine McKenzie. He claims
that she was not the cause of his being
alienated from his wife, but that Mrs.
Stewait's frequent drunkenness was the
cause.
In closing, the Judge says that from the
testimony he finds Dr. Stewart is not what
he represents himself to be, but that he is
the son of John and Mary Stewart; that
he is not the brother of Catherine Mc-
Kenzie. The divorce is granted, and in
regard to the property he declares the
transfer of the Etha Hill vineyard to Cath
ine McKenzie fraudulent, and that the
Ktha Hill property be reconveyed to them,
and that all the community property be
apportioned between Elizabeth P. Stewart
and John A. Stewart, the former to receive
two- thirds and the latter one-third.

SAN JOSE FATALITY
Electrician Hoffman Meets
With a Terrible
Death.
KILLED WHILE AT WORK
He Is Electrocuted by Contact
With a Power-House
Switch Plug.
LIVED BUT A FEW MINUTES.
His Body Burned by a Deadly Current
of Twenty-Five Hundred
Volts.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 11.â George Wer
ner Hoffman, the electrician at the Elec
tric Improvement Company's power
house, was almost instantly killed this
evening;, at 7 o'clock, while attending to
the electric-light switches at the power
house. Hoffman was seen to go into the
switchroom, and a few seconds later
George Johnson, the oiler, heard a moan.
He rushed into the room and found Hoff
man lying on the floor. Before he had
time to make an inquiry or assist the elec
trician from the floor, Hoffman said,
"George, I am done for." He then fell
in a stupor and remained unconscious
until death came several minutes later.
An investigation was made and it was
found that in some manner Hoffman had
touched either the switch plug above the
insulation or had slipped, and in falling
his hand came in contact with a coil of
electric light wires which was not insu
lated. The current passed through the
thumb and first and second finger of the
right hand, and on through his body, com
ing out at the heel of his left foot. Where
his fingers came in contact with the elec
tricity there were three burns and his heel
was charred. Twenty-five hundred volts
passed through his body.
Hoffman was a skilled electrician. He
was 126 years of age and a native of San
Jose.

Marriage Bonds of Charles H
Davis of San Francisco
Severed.
He and His Wife Had Separated bj
Agreement Two Days After
Their Wedding.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 11.â Charles H.
Davis of San Francisco was yesterday
granted a divorce from Valeria Z. Davis by
Judge Lorigan.
The parties to the suit were married at
Oakland in August, 1891, but lived to
gether only two days, ihe agreement to
separate was mutual. In September, 1892,
the husband learned that his wife was
living with a man named Iloag. Although
the woman's guilt could have been easily
established, fear of public notoriety kept
Davis Irorn bringing the suit until nearly
two years had passed. The action was
begun last September and the wife has
made no attempt to contest the suit. She
is at present in New York City or there
abouts, her exact residence not being
known to Davis, as they have not com
municated with each other since the day
of tlieir separation.

NEWS OF CITY INDUSTRIES
Orders From Mexico, Australia,
Central and South America
for Machinery.
Several Factories Working Overtime
to Keep Up With Ordersâ The
Prospects Fair.
Most of the factories in the City start in
the new year wuh plenty of orders on
hand, while those engaged in the manufac
ture of mining machinery, are fairly
rushed with orders.
The Union Machine Works have a large
amount of miscellaneous work on hand,
and have been compelled to work their
force overtime for several weeks past.
The Union Iron Works are building two
composite gunboats for the United States
navy. They are twin-screw steamers, 174
feet in length, 34-foot beam, 12-foot
draught, engines 800 horsepower, speed
12 knots. Each will carry six 4-pound,
four G-pound and two 1-pound rapid-fire
guns. The California Machine Works re
cently supplied the Government with a
steam launch, and are building another for
the Lighthouse Department. The Wash
burn-Moen Manufacturing Company re
cently furnished the California-street
Railway Company with a cable 12,500 feet
in length, for the Hyde-street line, and
will deliver this week a cable to the Sutter
street line. Their shops at North Beach
are running on full time, with plenty of
orders on hand.
Francis Smith & Co. have just manufac
tured and are shipping a cargo of thirty
inch pipe to the Horsefly mining district
in British Columbia for mining purposes.
The Union Lit ha Company report a large
volume of business in hand for the com
mencement of the new year, and are san
guine of a very prosperous year in their
line of trade.

amalgamators to New Zealand, one to
Clipper Gap, two to Carson Creek, Cala
veras County, and one to NVw port. Or.
The Union Photo Engraving Company is
turning out some half-tone work three by
six feet in size. This is believed to be the
largest ever made in America. T.e South
American republics are beginning to ap
preciate San Francisco art worK in this
line, and the Union Photo Engraving Com
pany have large orders on hand from these
countries.
L I. Degen recently equipped Tillroan &
Bendel's new coffee and spice mills and
factory with new belting throughout, lie
is also manufacturing an l^-inch belt for
driving a dynamo at San P.ernardino.
About a year ago the Ontario Mining
and Milling Company, at Park City, Utah,
installed an electric transmission plant for
the purpose of running their mills. Ihe
generators were operated by Pelton water
wheels, running under a head of about 120
feet and developing 100 horse-power.
At the time of the installation provision
was made for duplicating the power plant,
in case they found it necessary to increase
the output of their mills at some future
time. Such an increase has already been
found necessnry, and the I'elton Wnter-
Wbeel Company has in hand an order for
a complete duplicate plant, which will
afford the company twice the capacity it
ha<l before.
The i'elton Water-wheel Company re
ports a very good run of business for the
past few months, their export trade being
particularly good. Among recent orders
they have a contract for a pumping plant
and piping system for Chalchupa, near
San Salvador, Central America. They also
have a similar contract for Santiago. Chile,
and for a number of electric lighting plants
in the Northwest.
The Dow Steam-pump Works has just
completed at the present time some large
contracts, and among them are a com
bined air and circulating pump for Stock
ton, a gas-compressor for the Pasadena
Gas and Electric Light Company and an
oil pump for Fresno, and ttiey repori
having just completed six pumps for Port
Townsend, to be used on Government
vessels now building at that Dlace. The
vessels in question are two launches for
lighthouse service, and the pumping
piant consists of two boiler-feed pumps
and one combined air and circulating
pump for each boat.
The large sinking-pump just completed
for the North Star Mining Company will
be shipped this week. This firm make a
practice of testing every pump built, and
each test is more severe than the work the
pump will be called on to perform.
The pump built for the North Star mine,
while over twenty-one feet long and
weigning close on to 15,000 pounds, was
tested in an upright position, that being
the position it will be called on to do the
grreater part of the work.
This company has also just shipped to
Mazatlan several of the latest improved
boiler feed pumps. They have also
equipped the Union Oil Company with
one of the duplex pumps, to be used for
pumping salt water and for fire service.
The Lick Observatory, at Mount Hamil
ton, has just ordered a Dow pump of the
outside packed pot-valve plunder pattern,
which will be used for pumping water
through 2000 fept of pipe to an elevation of
300 feet.
The Abner Doble Company of this City
has contracted to furnish the Los Angeles
Electric Railway Company with an 800
--kilowatt generator for tueir lines. The
generator, weighing 14,000 pounds, will be
run at 80 revolutions per minute, driven
by a compound engine of 1200 horsepower.
The Risdon Iron Works recently con

FROM EASTERN PRISONS.
Unfair Competition of Articles
Imported Into This
State.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald Au
thorized to Make a Tour of
Investigation.
Governor Budd has taken action on the
communication of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association relative to the sub
ject of contract prison labor, and has de
cided to authorize Labor Commissioner E.
L. Fitzgerald to make a tour of investiga
tion through the East.
Mr. Fitzgerald, accompanied by one of
his own assistants, expects to start about
February 1, and they propose to visit
every prison of any consequence. The
action of the Governor was taken on a per
sonal report from Mr. Fitzgerald, to whom
he had referred the question.
Mr. Fitzgerald submitted a type-written
report to the Governor at Sacramento on
Friday. He was hoir.e again and in his
otlice yesterday and made the following
explanation:
The question of the manufacture of commer
cial articles by convict labor in other States
and their importation Into this State, where
they are sold in competition with our own
products, has occasioned a great deal of indig
nation among our merchants and manufac
turers. The matter has been ably discussed
by the local bodies representing these inter
ests, and every effort has been made to arrive
at facts and figures as to the extent to which
this business of importing prison-made good?
has been carried on in this State.
In various lines a general depression has re
sulted in consequence of this unfair compe
tition, help having been curtailed, wages re
duced, and an all-around retrenchment car
ried out. Some time ago I received a letter
from K. A. Hughson, a gentleman who has
given the convict labor question a great deal
of study. It gave me much information, and
his logical conclusions threw a new light on a
somewhat obscured subject. Here is one ex
tract from it to show Mr. Hughson's reasoning:
To my mind convicts should not remain idle for
two good reason-â first, for the sake of human -
ness, for It Is Inhuman to place prisoners In close
confinement, the tendency of that kind of incar
ceration bring to make them worse instead of
better; and second, for the sake of economy, be
cause convicts in our state prisons should at least
pay the cost of their own maintenance by their
labor and thus tighten the burden of taxpayers.
As to the second, I am inclined to believe that
convicts can be made to maintain themselves
withou: Injury to the honest labor of the State.
The question is, How can it be done?
Take, if yon please, vehicles. One has only to
loot over the Sta:e and he will see farm wagons
which have been manufactured at the Michigan
Sta:e prison ut Jackson, ranatout v.-agons and
carts made at other Eastern prisons, wheels from
the Columbus (Ohio) penitentiary and wood
screws and carriage-bolts produced attheOncn
data County penitentiary at Syracuse, ?f. V., and
only a few months aso < iillfornia was flooded with
wagon and carriage axles manufactured at the
New.- York state prison at Auburn.
When we consider that California Imports 90 per
cent of all the vehicles purchased, from ft farm
wason to a business van or line carriage, why
could not a certain number of convicts be set to
work in this Plate In such a ay as to make good
the cost of their maintenance wi.hout competing
with honest labor?
Mr. Hnghsou in his letter rather argued that
the convicts could be worked even at * profit to
the State, bnt with that I do not agree, because
they could not <to so without hurting legiti
mate labor. However, the letter served a pur
pose of some enlightenment, and I at once
sent to every official labor bureau in the coun
try for data. In this 1 was not successful, be
cause the replies I received informed me that
the various State Labor Commissioners were
not in positions to obtain for me the facts I de
sired.
That the Eastern labor organizations are
taking a very active interest in she subject was
demonstrated to me- in a letter from Chairman
Alex. B. McCulloch of the Richmond (Va.) Cen
tra! Trade end Labor Council.
1 have managed to get considerable informa
tion from unofficial sources, though, and I
learn that the fol lowing articles are largely pro
duced by convicts:
Iron and steel wagon axles, wagon wheels, car
nage l.olts and nuts, clips, stoves, lioots, shoes and
clothing, knitted kooMs, overalls, blankets, woven
woolen goods, foundry work, light carriage hard
ware, castings, hames and harness.
My correspondents tell me that the method
has been for the contractor to purchn.se the
convict labor at so much per hour, which has
not proved satisfactory to either side.
The capacity of tlie convict laborer as com
pared with the labor of a tree man is estimated
at two-thirds; therefore the convict who works
at 50 cents per day competes with outside labor
at. say, 75 cents per day.
Thus, even lit the very lowest minimum of
wage received by free labor in comparison, the
showing is conclusive in demonstrating that
the manufacturer employing honest labor is
at a great disadvantage, and may ultimately
bedriv&a from business by disastrous compe
tition.
In his report to tbe Governor Mr. Fitz
gerald included much of his correspond
ence and finally recommended a per
sonal investigation. His reason for Laving
one of his own assistants to accompany
him is that his companion, having already
been schooled in the practical work of
-â¢State labor reforms, besides having the
general interests of California at heart,
would be a much more effective aid than
an outsider.
Astor'H New Vehicle.
One of the sights of the metropolis just
now is John Jacob Astor steering his
horseless carriage up and down Fifth ave
nue. It is a sight for men and anirels. It
is the first fashionable move in the direc
tion of abolishing the poor horse alto

tori?, without a box.
This he manipulated by a wheel for
steering and sundry valves for letting on
and suppressing the foam or naphtha.
The tall figure is bent over the apparatus
with a great degree of earnestness, while
ever and anon the keen eye shoots ahead
to look out for possible collisions and in
terference. â Commercial Advertiser.
Enforcing Ancient Sunday Laws,
The contemptible and ridiculous Lord's

police have begun by getting a Jewish
tobacconist lined for trading on the Chris
tian Sabbath, while at Hoy lake, near Bir
kenhead, a start has been made with the
prosecution of a barber for the awful crime
of shaving customers on Sunday. The

POINTS OF SUPERIORITY.
ELECTRIC POWER.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT
generates double the power of any other
Electric Belt made. The arrangement of
the metals is upon the most approved
scientific basis; the Voltaic piles, being
quadruple, so as to brine out a steady,
powerful current; perfectly insulated, so j
that, different from all other belts, the full
force of the current is conducted into the !
weakened system in a continuous, life- j
giving stream. It gives tone and energy |
to the nervous system and all its depend-
ent organ?. As "Electricity is life" Dr.
Sanden's Electric Beit is the modern life-
giver.
DURABILITY.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT is
positively guaranteed for one year. Every
Belt broken or by any circumstance,
whether the fault of the belt or the wearer,
having lost its curative powers of elec- '
tricity within one year, is replaced with a j
new one at no expense to the wearer. If i
Dr. Sanden's Belt was twice its present
cost it would still be cheap, as no other ap-
pliance made can be sold with this
guarantee.
CONVENIENCE.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT is
applied on retiring at night and worn until
time of arising in morning. No care or
trouble is incurred in its use; no time is
wasted in using it, as its soothing,
strengthening current absorbs into the
â weakened orcans while you sleep. Benefi-
cial results are noticed In one night's nse,
and the sleep is made sound and refreshing.
It quiets the nerves and builds up the weak
parts in a natural, humane manner.

The Narrow Escape of Miss
Claussen, a Missionary
at Yu-Jang.
The People There Had Never Seen a
European Before, and Were
Much Wrought Up.
Miss Sophia Claussen of Norway, a mis
sionary of the Lutheran church, for four
years laboring among the Chinese at Nan
kowand other places in the- Chinese em
pire, is at the Occidental.
'I he lady arrived on the steamer Peru
yesterday. She says these are rather
troublous times for missionaries in China,
and that in whatever towns they are none
of them feel very safe.
It is worse, she tells, where the literati
abound. They are full of prejudice againat
tiie missionaries, and in their feelings
border on contempt.
>Jiss Claussen recently made a long trip
up the Yangtse-Kiang River from Han
kow to the city of Yu-Jang, which had pre
viously only once been visited by Eu
ropeans. It took six weeks of steady trav
eling to get there. She went with other
missionaries, taking one of the Chinese
Bailing boats used on tne great river.
Yu-Jang has many students in it. It is a
literary city, and the literati, as well as the
people, swarmed about them in wide-eyed
wonder.
"Few of them had ever seen a Euro
pean." said .Miss Claussen, "and their in
terest was raised to the highest pitch. I
whs carried in a chair by the Chinese who
had come with us.
"The streets were very narrow, and for a
time they were blocked so we could not
get through. The Chinese all gather-d,
examined us critically and talked about
us, wondering if we thought we could
teach them anything.
"Finally I went in, and to i;et past the
crowd pushed into a side place, when im
mediately their faces assumed looks of
great seventy and there were many wild
ejaculations, coupled with threats.
"It looked as though they would attack
us. The crowd had all the appearance of
a mob. Danger seemed to threaten us
from every side. Finally one cf them
said, raising his hands as if appealinglv,
'She didn't know ; she didn't know it was
a holy place.'
"Then I realized what the trouble was.
The place 1 had unwittingly stepped into
was holy to them, and for a foreigner to
enter it was according to their ideas to tie
rile it. They thought we didn't under
stand what they said, but we di.J. We
made haste to get out. The faces of the
Chinese chair-carriers with us were very
pale. They realized the great danger we
were in.
"I shall remain in this country about a
year, and will stay with friends in San
Francisco a good portion of the time. I
need a change of climate. It is very ur

GREAT BUCKLEY VICTORY.
Everybody Was Unanimously
Elected at the Family Pri
mary Last Night.
THE NEW GENERAL COMMITTEE.
The Boys Gayly Piled Up an Unneces
sarily, Suspiciously and Harm
lessly Large Vote.
The Buckley primary for the election of
a new Democratic general committee,
which was neld under the club plan in
the eighteen districts of the City last night,
gave the Buckleyites a chance to be glad
acain. for something like 6000 votes were
dropped into the eighteen ballot-boxes be
tween the hours of 7:30 and 10:30 r. m.
This is about half the number of names
enrolled a month ago, and is a somewhat
surprisingly heavy vote to be polled under
the circumstaticps, because in each district
there was but one ticket, and after the first
vote the balloting was a somewhat per
functory process cf ratification.
The election paÂ«sed off quietly and
patisfactorily without any of the relish
and excitement of the "Buckley pri
mari' good old times back in the
'80' a. The Junta people looked on
with a merely curious interest, and as the
Buckleyites had the tield all to themselves,
and as it was a family affair, there was no
good reason why the thing should not pass
nicely.
Tlie committee of twenty-five in charge
of the primary, assisted at times by the
counsei of Buckley and others, success
ful iy carried < at their idea of having har
mony univ< â 
'Win:! the primary loomed up ahead
factions in several districts began conten
der uistriv-t power, but the powers
succeeded, by pleading, suggesting, re
tnping heads together, in
getting ail tiiÂ«' rival factions to agree on
compromu mdond visions of the
representations in the general committee.
This was comparatively easy in all the
at tht- Thirty-second and Thirty
fifth. In the former the bitter, prolonged
tr.ni seemingly boneless war between the
Dundon and Goecken factions was settled
by Buckley by his drawing a name from
â¢â Jim" O'Brien's hat, aad the settlement
hung together until the ballot-box was
. Lst night.
instead oi the anticipated bloody war
at Fourth and Brannan streets last night,
there was simply a lively voting, spiced
with steam beer and two or three lively
- that didn't amount to anything at
all.
The equally bitter war between ''Larry"
Dolan and O'Byrne and their
followers in the Thirty-fifth was settled at
the last b . ::ient giving Do
lan twenty and O'Byrne live out of the
twenty-five, and there, too, peace waa
maintained until 10:30 p. m. The only
~t*was in thÂ»? Thirty-third, where two
extra names were vii the ticket.
The usual rules governed the election
la^t night. Yesterday eighteen ballot
boxes were borrowed of the Jtegistrar and
distributed and the machinery of the elec
tion was worked with great regard for
regularity, for the Buckleyites are very
careful now about constitutions, rules and
regularity.
In most of the districts, especially south
of Market, street, the polling-places wer<*
back rooms of corner saloons, wuh a win
dow opening on the sidewalk. Tne boys
gathered early, the crowds were quite
targe and in nearly every district the vot
ing waa LivÂ« iy and steady.
The heavy vot< to the organized
effort in every district to poll a large vote
as a demonstration of factional strength,
to go along with that of the big enroli
ment of 11,nX> names. The regulars claim
to be "the" party, ainl it was important to
prove it. They think they have done it.
The iiuckley organisation is very coru
plete and well managed in a practical way,
;t:;ii a B] ecial effort waa m ide I â¢ get out a
big vote. It is probable that a large ma
â of the votes were legitimate. How
tâ â¢.-. .-. it was simply a question of the size
of the vote re no contests and no
challengers, and the number of ballots
renting the factional pride and en
thusiasm oi the boys can oniv De guessed
at.
[inning at 10 o'clock, reports from
the districts began to come into the head
quarters >>f the primary committee at 20
Ellis street, where, in the 'ibsence of a
vith anything, the spirit of things
ply a satisfactory business one.
new general committee elected last
includes over 150 of the old general
committee. A majority of the old 4.">0
elected in 1892 is .-til 1 with the Buckley
â ], i.nii wherever it was fairly satis
. the pian was to return old
inenit" rs. Man; were tired of the job and
wanteci friend-; in their places, and many
party workers who had" had no show at
;e since the revolution of
1892, thought it time they were given a
chance. ' â 
The chief characteristic of the new
committee is that it is composed of good
party workers. Tne Junta, in making up
â ,:erul committee, went a good deal
on the respectable sound of the names in
it. The Buckieyites don't scorn great and
good men, but look first to getting in the
right places the men who can "do politics"
and who can get and manage votes in their
districts.
Jamea G. Maguire is returned to the new
committee without his being consulted.

The old and the new general committees
will be called together, probably at Metro
politan Temple, some night this week.
Fhe old committee will wind up its busi
ness ana the new committee will organize.
Talk about who will be- chairman is vet
"low down.' 1 James H. O'Brien, who \vas
beaten by Watkins some time ago, is much
talked of and appears to be the most
likely to be the successful candidate.
Joseph Rothschild, the present acting
chairman, is another probability, and
Thomas J. Glynn is mentioned.
The following figures show for the dis
tricts named respectively the vote as re
ported last night and the district enroll
ment. In some of these and in some dis
tricts unreported last night the vote is re
markably close to the whole number of
names enrolled, but then nobody would
have been hurt if the boys voted every
name twenty-three times:

Trees Have Likes and Dislikes.
R. M. Kellogg of lona County, Mich., one
of^ tiie most successful fruit-growers in
Western Michigan, and secretary of the
West Michigan Horticultural Society, be
lieves that a tree has its like3and dishkes;
that it knows its friends and its enemies
when they approach, and has a high de
gree of intelligence generally. He believes
trees are as alive to their surroundings as
animals, and that their sensibilities must
be touched to gain the best results. He has
made a lifelong study of fruit trees and
fruit-growing. He explained his theory at
the joint convention of Western Michigan
horticultural societies in Grand Rapids
last week. His position was not contro
verted by any in attendance, and many
agreed with him.â Chicago Herald
Count de Gobelin says that cards came
from the ancient Egyptians, but the ma

origin, and assert that they were invented

MAY CONTEST A
FEDERAL ORDER.
The Southern Pacific Com
pany Inclined to Be
Defiant.
ITS REVENUE AT STAKE.
Exception to a Sweeping Ruling
of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
A LEGAL BATTLE IN PROSPECT.
What Was Brought as a Test Case
Proved a Most Destructive
Boomerang.
There is now every probability that the
r< cent decision of the Interstate Commerce
Commission in the case of the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company of Pueblo, Colo.,
against the Southern Pacific Company
and other railroads engaged in interstate
commerce west of Pueblo is likely to pre
te a great legal battle between the
Southern Pacilic Company and some of
the other Western roads involved on one
side and the Interstate Commerce Com
â i on the other.
When the decision was rendered a very
brief synopsis of it was telegraphed to this
Cityâ not sufficient for the railroad peo
ple to determine the full scope and effect
of it â and the entire text was expected
with much interest and anxiety. This has
now come to hand and proves to be a most
serious blow at the lines affected.
It not alone orders a reduction of rates
between Pueblo and San Francisco on iron
and steel and goods manufactured from
these materials, but also between all inter
mediate points.
In its decisions the commission does not
decide principles so much as it does cases,
anu therefore its decision in this matter
only bears upon the commodities in ques
tion. But a most vital principle is in
volved and it is expected that a decision
.ortly be rendered that will cover
rates in the territory mentioned on all
classes of freight and all commodities.
An adherence to the ruling of the com
mission means a decided decrease in the
freight revenues of the companies con
cerned, as it involved heavy reductions.
All the lines have until January 15 to com
ply with the order. The only road tuat
has thus far announced reductions in ac
cordance with the decision ia the Santa
At the oilices of the Southern Pacific
Company it was stated yesterday that the
order oi "the commission would in all prob
ability be disobeye I, or rather ignored. It
is expected that charges will then be made
against the company, when the whole
matter will be taken into court. There is
no ai y speaking, from the
ons of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, the only remedy lying in a dis
ind conseqnont trial before a
judicial tribunal.
The complainant is engaged in mining
coal and iron ore and in manufacturing
coke, steel rails, railroad fastenings, mer
chant bar iron and steel at Pueblo, Colo.,
and complained that the defendant rail
road companies publish a rate between
Pueblo an 1 San Francisco on steel rails
and other articles of iron and steel of $1 tJO
per hundred pounds while they are pasties
to tariff rates o:i the fame articles to San
Francisco from Chicago of <J0 cents, and
that the rate on said commodities from
! certain Atlantic points is as low and sorue
i times lower than from Chicago. It was
! then charged that these rates unjustly
! discriminate against Puoblo and are in
'â  violation of the fourth section of the act
'to regulate interstate commerce; that
i complainant's business of supplying fuel
ilorado industries and other products
j to points in California was greatly affected
by these unjust rates and that the;
i been deprived of a large and valuable
| business in the i
The prayer was that the defendants be
â¢:d to haul iron and steel and all
â  articles from Pueblo to San Fran
.â¢it rates that will pay thorn relai
cbe same profit as was derived from trans
ng similar commodities from I
lantic seaboard or Chicago to .San Fran
; cisco.
In the consideration of the case Com
missioner Clement?, who heard it, said :
It was Insisted on behalf of the complainant
at the hearing that the rates from Pueblo to
n.il'l not excel : 40 1
and 33 cents on bar iron, and
defendants concerned in the transporter
: tion of freight originating at Pueblo ai
I by their representatives Indi
ach rates to
complainant on condition that the commission
would construe the long and short haul rule,
or grant reliei therefrom so as not to make
the maximum from l'ueblo to points
ir lines between Poeblo anil Ban Fran
cisco. Under such ruling or order all the de
fendants Reem agreed that raies toSanFran
migbt, on occasion, be wade less from
lo than from the East.
â¢o reduce the rates from Pueblo to
Ban Francisco, on condition that they should
be applied as maximum rates to Inter
media Is not an application for relief
from the operation of the fourth section of the
law.
i pon the request of complainant hearing
was had only in respect to that part of the
complaint relating to rates on steel rail?, rail
road fastenings, bar iron, castiron water-pipes,
pig iron and other iron an-1 steel commodities
which take similar rate*, those complained of
on oilier goods being involved in another caÃe.
In coming to this conclusion, the com
missioner said:
This case rests upon broader grounds than
ble availability of competition by rail and
water rout*:-. The disparity between higher
rates for short hauls and lower ones on long
hauls, the latter involving greater service and
expense on the part of the carrier, is usually
defended upon the ground, where competition
â¢ carriers is set up, that unless the lower
rate is made, the traffic will not IBOve by the
lant's Line, but will be secured by his
. Whatever may be the merits ol
this defense, it would seem that better cause
exists fur lower rates where, under higherones,
the tnitlie is subjected to such disadvantage or
prejudice that it will not move at all. Such is the
situation developed in the case nnder consid
eration. The. rates in force from Pueblo to San
Francisco prohibit the movement of iron and
steel articles irom the former place to the latter,
while greatly lower rates from other, though
far more distant, points prevail.
It is contended by the complainant that but
for the. obstructive position taken by the South
ern Pacific the rnt<-K complained of herein
would no', have been bo hign , anil some of tne
testimony tends to show that it may be for the
Interest of the Son them Pacific to encourage
iron and steel traffic via New Orleans so as to
obtain for itself a longer rail haul and greater
ensatlon than on such traffic routed via
Osrden and Its Central Pacific division.
However this may be, discriminations and
prejudices, both as to rules and facilities, have
sometimes been found to result from the ap
parent interest of carriers to secure freight at
points situated with reference to the place of
destination, so as to give a long haul, though
at iower rates than a much shorter one at
higher rates, the former yielding greater ag
snue. Inequality of treatment of
shippers and localities having do other justifl
carfoo than this end is indefensible.
Taking all the facts and circumstances into
consideration and making due allowances
therefor, we think the rates from l'ueblo to
Sun Francisco should not exceed 45 cents per
l<)0 pounds on steel mils and railway fasten
ings, or 87J^j cents per 100 pounds on bar iron,
:i witier-pipe, pigiron, billets, blooms,
rivets, nails and spike*, nor should the rates

on other Iron and steel articfes bo greater at
any time than 75 per cent of rates coatcm
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 1896.
poraneonsly in foice on like traffic irom Chi
cago to San Francisco over any of the de
fendant roads. An order to this effect will be
entered.
The percentage relation fixed in the forego
ing order is confined to rates from Pueblo and
Chicago, in expectation that the present rela
tion In rates applying to San Francibco from
Chicago and other eastern points c ver the
various routes in use, will not be changed in
such manner as to result in new injustice to
Pueblo, but to guard against such r contin
gency this case will be held open for such fur
ther proceedings or action as may at any time
appear necessary.
The sweeping character of the' decision
was entirely unexpected to the defend
ants. It was in reality a test case, having
been brought on an understanding be
tween the railroads and the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company. Its purpose was to
enable the Colorado company to come into
the San Francisco market against Eastern
competitors, and thus permit the railroads
west of Pueblo to enjoy traffic that was
largely moving around C"ape Horn.
Instead, however, of reducing rates only
from Pueblo to San Francisco, as was
asked, the commission has held that Pu
eblo-San Francisco traffic was not exempt
from the long and short haul clause of the
interstate commerce act, and ruled that
the Pueblo-San Francisco rate must be the
maximum rate for intermediate points.
LEAGUE OFFICIALS MEET.
Charles S. Wells and Trainer Shaefer
Arrive From the South.
The board of oilicers of the North Cali
fornia Division, League of American
Wheelmen, held an important meeting
last evening at the rooms of the Bay City
Wheelmen. Representatives were present
from the Garden City Cyclers, California
Cycling Club, Reliance, Petaluma, Bay
City and Olympic Club Wheelmen and
Terminal City Wheelmen of Stockton.
Reports were heard from the good roads,
racing, touring, transportation, finance
and membership committees, which indi
cated that the league in this State is in a
prosperous condition.
A committee from the Petaluma Wheel
men, consisting of P. K. Lippitt, L. C.
Byce and Joe Steiger, addressed the meet
ing, requesting that the league meet of
1896 be awarded to Petaluma. They hand
ed in the applications of thirty-two mem
bers of the club as an evidence of good
faith, and promised many more in the
near future. The meet is usually held on
the Fourth of July, and the features are a
competitive parade in the forenoon, races
in the afternoon and a ball in the evening.
It was decided to leave the matter of
awarding the annual meet until the next
meeting, to be held Saturday evening,
February 1.
Charles S. Wells, the great class B racer,
arrived here yesterday with his trainer,
Dave Bhaefer, from Coronado, where he
lias been trying for records. They found
quadruplet pacing not fast enough to se
cure the coveted records, and, while await
ing the arrival of a rive-seated machine
from the East, decided to come north and
take a look at the cement track at San
Jose. Mr. Shaefer went there last night
for that purpose, and will also try to se
cure Otto Ziegler for his racing team, in
which regard he thinks he will be suc
cessful.
Wells is in splendid form now and feels
sure he can secure the records he wants if
his pucing is fast enough. The wheel he
is now riding has a 102 gear and 63-i-inch
cranks, but Wells is a heavy, strong" rider
and can make fast time on it.
T. A. Griffiths, E. Languetin, T. S. Hall,
H. A. Goddard, A. L. Holling, Archie
Keid, S. B. Vincent anÂ£ A. J. Mcnne of
the Buy City Wheelmen will start at 7
o'clock this morning to ride 100 miles
around the bay. They are all hardy road
riders and hope to lower tho record for the
course.
THE PASTORS AND WOMEN
Mrs. Clara M. Partridge Writes
an Open Letter to the Rev.
Marshall Law.
A Scathing Criticism of Mr. Law's De
termination to Permit No Women
to Visit Him.
Mrs. Clara M. Partridge, wife of Samuel
C. Partridge of Haste street, and a teacher
in the Columbus School at West Berkeley,
has written an open letter in which she
attacks Rev. Marshall Law of Oakland in
a most scatbing manner on account of his
announcement from the pulpit that be
will hereafter see no woman except at his
home, "where Mrs. Law can keep us
company," or "by appointment and when
her husband or some ono else is present,"
this decision on his part having been
brought about by the recent troubles of
Dr. Brown.
Mrs. Partridge in her letter makes the
following statements:
"It certainly is true, as Rev, Mr. Law
states, that there is a sort of unhealthy
sentimentality between come of the ladle's
of some churches and some pastors, but
because one or two, or even half a dozen
instances of injudicious friendliness may
be named, does it follow that all women
are to be shunned and treated as villainous
Bchemen, and all men, especially ministers
of the gospel, to be isolated because they
are too weak to meet women without losing
their moral dignity and probity of charac
ter?
"Is it possible that you, as a woman of
business, I, as a schoolteacher, young
women students, mothers with sick chil
dren, daughters who can earn their livings
at the bookkeeper's desk or typewriter's
table, cannot meet the men of our com
munity to transact business without being
accused of sinister designs and immoral
tendencies?
"With all due respect to the ministry,
which in these days is too often harshly
criticized, I, in the name of the thousands
of good women and true, protest against
Mr. Law's implications, and against one
in his position lending his influence to the
building of a still more unhealthy senti
ment between men and women. Would it
not be more luting for him to use his best
efforts to cultivate in the minds and hearts
of men and women alike a true concep
tion of manhood and womanhood, and of
their mutual responsibilities, moral and
social?
"Those in high places, whose duty it is
to mold public opinion, should take wise
counsel among themselves before they say
that which will in any way lessen the
faith men ana women have in each other's
integrity, and it seems to me that Mr.
Law has cast an imputation upon his sex
as well as upon woman that is unworthy
of him and unwarranted by the case in
consideration. Clara M. Fartu/dÂ«k."

AN HOUR WITH "CHIMMIE"
The Author of the Famous Bowery
Creation Gives a Public
Reading.
BRIDAL TOUR OF THE DUCHESS.
Successful and Enjoyable Entertain
ment Under Auspices of the Mer
cantile Library Auxiliary.
Chimmie Fadden, his Duchess, his
"wot fell" and his other quaint Bowery
vulgarisms delighted a large and cultured
audience in the auditorium of the Young
Men's Christian Association yesterday. It
may be remarked also that Chimmie Fad
den's author was present, and this added
greatly to the interest and the pleasures of
the event. Chimmie Fadden's author is
neither an Apollo nor a Beau Brummel.
In truth he wears glasses and has the ap
pearance rather of a studious sort of fel
low, albeit one that can appreciate both a
good dinner and a good joke. His name
is Edward W. Townsend, and as Samuel
M. Shortridge said yesterday in introduc
ine him, "he went from us and has re
turned with laurel on his brow" â also with
more flesh on his bones it may be added.
The entertainment was given under the
auspices of the Mercantile Library
Auxiliary, and it opened â somewhat after
the hour set â by two vocal numbers by
Mrs. J. E. Birmingham.^ She ?ang ""When
You Are Here, Love' (Kate Varmah) and
"To-morrow" (Meidlinger) â and sang
them sDlendidly and was roundly and
justly encored.
Samuel M. Shortridge appeared [next as
the forerunner of the britrht particular
star of the evening, he who discovered
"Wot tell." Mr. Shortridge's address was
commendably brief, but every sentence
counted and paved the way for the
splendid reception accorded the author.
"It was a pleasure, refreshing and gratify
ing," said Mr. Miortridge, "to steal away
from the heat and the dust and the con
tention â yes, and sometimes anger â of the
courtrooms to this beautiful temple dedi
cated to music and letters and their
kindred arts to welcome one who went
from us and has returned with the laurel.
"And in winning a laurel wreath for his
own brow he has added one to the pure
and spotless forehead of our Stato." In a
few terse sentences Mr. Shortridge then
discussed Mr. Townsend'e place in litera
ture. He had not indulged in speculative
or abstruse treatises, but had followed in
the path of the immortal Dickens and
touched the hearts of all the people
by finding his poetry and comedy
and drama in lowly walks of
life. Doubtless Mr. Townsend had
seen the stars at night and had been
thrilled with the poetry of each flower
that turns its face to the sun, but he had
looked deeper into the hearts of men, and
had found the diamond sparkling in the
tavrny grass. Nevertheless his service to
literature was as great as though he had
written of the most learned subjects. "We
at home, seeintr him so near, did not
realize his true proportions, though we
knew he had genius, and like so many
others he went Fast and there won that
AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE TOWER.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
World-wide recognition that is the just
tribute of civilization to genius."
Mr. Shortridge then said a few kind be
coraine words on behalf of the auxiliary,
after which the father of "ChiinmieJFad
den" stepped out upon the platform and
bowed.
Then he opened "A Daughter of the
Tenements," and read therefrom some de
scriptions of the Boweryâ this as a preface
to his chapter from "Chimmie." He
chose the bridal tour of "Chimmie" and
the Duchess, and it is scarcely necessary to
say that his audience was kept in an
almost continual roar of laughter that, at
the conclusion of the reading^ was merged
into most hearty and prolonged applause.
There were two other numbers on the
programme, both of which were heartily
enjoyed and warmly encored â Bernard
Mollenhauer in a violin solo and Donald
de Vere Graham in a vocal number. 11. J.
Stewart was the musical director. The
entertainment was deservedly successful,
because it was one of the most enjoyable
afternoon events of a public nature that
has occurred in San Francisco for many a
day. ______________
Body Found Off Black Point.
Boatman Irving of 432 Kentucky street

as the boiler-makers use and some business
cards were found in one of the pockets. A
odging-house key, numbered (37, was also
found. The man must have been in the water

THAT TOTTERING TOWER
The Tall Landmark of the Mid
winter Fair Is Doomed
to Fall.
Blasting at the Foundation and Tug
ging at the Top of a Finan
cial Failure.
San Francisco has its leaning tower, but
unlike the famous tilted pile at Pisa, Italy,
it is not destined to remain an object of
interest to the wondering gazer.
That tall steel structure that marked the
center of the main court at the Midwinter
Fair grounds and had at its highest point a
great electric searchlight that flashed over
all the City and far out on the bay, has
cea sed to be aa object of pride. It must
like a dead giant of the forest be uprooted
and felled to make room for something
more useful and ornamental.
All yesterday afternoon nearly a score of
men were at work either tugging at a
windlass to which was attached a double
steel cable reaching to the top of the tower,
or were drilling hoi es for blasts m the
solid concrete foundation in which the
four corners of the steel and iron super
structure are imbedded.
Little by little the framework responded
to the strain upon the cables, but the
twelve blasts exploded in the ten-foot
cubes of cement failed to crack and
crumble the foundations sufficiently to
cause the 2"_'s-foot tower to loosen at the
base, totter a moment and then come
down with a mighty and impressive crash
of 110 tons of metal.
People stood at a respectful distance and
bent their necks far back as they looked
up at the dismantled skeleton, st.rinped of
its elevator and of the few furnishings
that had once made each of the several
platforms attractive stations to the patrons
of the electric tower.
The Park police were on duty at long
range waving ami gesticulating to foot
passengers and bicyclists to keep out of
the imaginary circle of possible death.

and along the level stretches formed a big
ring, and aJI the faces were turned toward
the center in momentary expectation that
another explosion would raise a cloud of
gray dust and scatter broken fragments of
cement, or that the straining cables would
suddenly precipitate the spectacular fall
and crash.
But the tower would only lean a few de
grees to the west, and, in that threatening
position, it will probably remain to-day
and until some time to-morrow afternoon.
More blasts will be put in the concrete to
morrow forenoon after holes shall have
been drilled.
When the tower falls it will be un jointed
and broken up into convenient pieces, so
that it can bo removed and piled some
where awaiting a sale as old iron.
It is estimated by the Park Commission
ers, under whose orders the work is being
done, that the material will not bring
enough to pay for the labor of destruction.
At any rate, the Commissioners say they
offered to let any one take the tower down
for the material in it, but no one would at
tempt it.
The electric tower was a white elephant
to the men that invested their money in
it. It did not pay and nearly every part
of it. even to the concrete foundations, it
is said, is the subject of some legal claim.
The owners were given a whole year to
remove the obstruction, for such the tower
has been considered (to the work on the
extensive new concourse) and the present
action is the result of tne Commissioners'
determination to wait no longer.

The brig Percy Edwards, owned by Cap

lying up in Oakland creek for two years,
will probably be purchased for the Central
American trade. Several wealthy persons
from the Gilbert Islands are here trying to
secure the vessel, ana if they succeed her
first mission will be highly creditable to
herself and her new owners. She will pro
ceed to San Jose de Guatemala and carry
home the "blackbird" Gilbert natives who
were kidnaped some years ago by the
trampsteamer Montserrat. It will be re
membered that Captains Blackburn and
Ferguson engineered the scheme of sup
plying the Central American coffee plan
tations with cheap island laborers and
landed a steamer load of the simple natives
at Guatemala.
This slave trade soon fell into disrepute
even on the Spanish-American coast, and

FIRE IN A FACTORY.
The Eagle Collar-Pad Company's Ei
tablisbiuent Damaged to Con
siderable Extent.
The manufacturing portion of the City
was vi.-ited by a lire last evening which
succeeded in destroying about $5000 worth
of property before the flames gave in to
the many thousand gallons of water which
wore poured upon them.
It is supposed that the fire broke out in
the Eagle Collar-pad Company's establish
ment, which occupies the second floor of
a two-story brick building at 132 Main
street.
At 9:45 p. m. the neighborhood was
startled by what appeared to be an explo
sion, and in a few moments the rear por
tion of the building was a mass of raging
names. Special Patrolman Detwiler, who
was among the first to discover the lire,
immediately turned in an alarm through
box 2G5, but after a few moments, no an
swer being received, another alarm was
turned in through box 51. The tire patrol
was the first to arrive at the scene, and be
fore the engines were ready to begin throw
ing water had succeeded "in covering the
goods and machinery in neighboring es
tablishments, thereby eliminating the loss
which would have inevitably resulted had
the flood of water which was turned on the
flames been allowed to go where it pleased.
The heaviest loser from the fire is the
Eagle Pad Company. It is estimated that
the damage done to its stock will amount
to about $2000, which is fully covered by
insurance. The Union Machine Company,
which occupies the first floor of the
scorched building, will probably lose $1500,
as its establishment was thoroughly
flooded and filled with smoke. The "ma
chine company carries a stock valued at
$2f>.000 and ?SOOO insurance.
The stock carrifl by the Davis Collar
Company was damaged to the extent of
about $500, which loss is covered by insur
ance.
A portion of the floor at 132 Main street
is occupied by the California Gas Engine
Company, and they will probably lo?e
about $:M>. This company carries $t;00 in
surance on its stock.wnlch is valued at
several thousand dollars.
It is not known how the fire started, but
it is presumed that it was from a cigar or
cigarette stub being carelessly thrown
among the grass-stuffed coilar-pads,
which were as dry as tinder.

FATHER YORKE
TO DR WENDTE.
The Catholic Chancellor Con
tinues His Reply to the
Unitarian.
ST. PETER'S COMMISSION.
Christ Was Governor of His
Kingdom and Bequeathed
His Office.
W. H. BOWMAN'S CONTRIBUTION.
The American Protective Association's
Champion Continues the Argu
ment.
Rev. Father Yorke continues his reply
to the Rev. Dr. Wendte in the following
letter addressed to The Call:
January 11, 1896.
Tn the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: In my
letter of yesterday I treated the lirst proposition
defended" by Dr. Wendte:
Peter was never invested by Jrsus Christ with
any extraordinary authority or spiritual supremacy
over the other disciples.
In order to substantiate this denial Dr.
Wendte gave the usiml objections against the
Catholic doctrine that Peter was appointed
head of the church. These objections I ar
ranged in the following order:
A. Objections against the proofs alleged to sub
stantiiue the tact.
1. The argument from the Eock metaphor is of
no value, because :
(a) Peter is not the only Rock.
(b) His name Rock was given on a different oc
casion, and therefore has no special significance.
(r) Peter was the Book simply because he took a
leading part in spreading the church.
(rf) Peter was nor the Bock, because Christ re
buked him and because he denied Christ.
â J. The argument from the commission to con
firm the brethren is of no weight, because nothing
was meant tn* Sj !'â¢ â¢â¢ r's natural fervor.
'A. The argument (torn the puwi-rof binding and
loosing is of no weight, becanse all the disciples re
ceived the same j n\\ er.
B. Objections against the fact itself.
(.1) Our Lord himself expressly provided against
a primacy.
-â  The ancient church was not orsanized on a
hierachical basis, and therefore there was no room
for a Pope.
(3) The whole history of the apostolic church
Bhows no trace of the primacy of Peter because
Ihe apostles exercised their authority In
common.
ih) Peter did not preside at the council of Jeru
salem.
,<-> Paul \rithstood him face to face.
1 he fourth gospel p'.orlfies John, not Peter.
I have considered his treatment of the argu
ment drawn from the Rock metaphor, and
have shown that his objections will not hold
water. I now proceed to examine his answers
to the argument drawn from
â¢J. thk Commie-ion to Com :rm the Brethren.
"* The account of the conferring of such a com
n on Peter is found in the twenty-t
chapter of St. L :ke : "There ft' so arose b<
tion among them which of them is accounted
to be the greatest." Bach contentions were
not unfrequem. A !>n::<i of poor fishermen,
tired with Messianic dream?, have been prom
a kingdom, and it is no wonder
that they should squabble and in
trigue for the good places. Christ takes note
of their contention, find does he say
There shall Vn- no places, no "chiefs," no
"greatest" in bis kingdom? Such a declaration
would end the dispute at once. On the con
trary he admits that there shall be grades and
offices among them, and he takes the oppor
tunity to inculcate humility on the men who
are to hold these offices. They are not to
follow the example of the petty tyrants who
rule the nations: "The kings of the gentiles
lord it over them and they that have authority
are calleu benetactors, bur not so ye. He that
is greater among you let him become as the
lesser, and he tr:at is chief as one that doth
serve."
Then he enforces this precept by his own ex
ample. No one who reads "the gospels can
deny that Christ acted as chief, as leader, as
governor of h:s kingdom. Acts of authority
exercised by him are found strewn eL over
the pages of the evangelists. He therefore was
among them as their master and chief, yet
just at this very moment he had but finished
performing the most menial serviceâ the
washing of their feet. "For whether is
greaterâ he that sitteth at meat or he that
t^erveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat; but
I am in the midst of you as he that i>erveth."
He had not cei.sed to be their master though
he acted as their servant. He was still the
king, though he was meek and humble of
heurt ; so when they should receive the ap
pointed kingdom, and should sit on thrones
judging Jsrae-1, they should not be carried
away by their power, but should use it even
as he. Then he turned to Peter and saH :
"Simon, Simon. Satan hath desired to have
you'"â pl'iral, the apostlesâ "that he might
sift you"â plural, the apostlesâ "as the wheat
is sifted in the- winnowiug. But. I have prayed
for"â whom? The twelve apostles? No; butâ
"thee"â singular, Simon Peterâ "that thy"â
singular, Peter'sâ "faith fail not. And thou"â
Peterâ "being once converted confirm thy
brethren"â the apostles.
The hour of the passion is at hand. The lit
tle flock which he had gathered with such in
finite care and patience and love is about to be
scattered. The powers of darkness are to have
their df.y of triumph. What then will become
of those to whom he has been making such
"pTomUes, promises so glorious that lie has
been compelled to warn them against pride?
His words give the answer. He has chosen one
out of the eleven, to be the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven. To him he gives the office
of confirming his brethren. In order that he
may carry out that office he prays for him
specially. Evidently he believes* that his
prayers shall be efficacious. Peter's faith shall
not fail, and Peter, therefore, shall confirm the
brethren.
This dr. ty laid upon Peter is something given
to him alone. It is a peculiar privilege, and it
is a privilege which necessarily denotes au
thority, i hrist sends him to restore order to
an army tha; is demoralized. The enemy is
victorious and the soldiers are fleeing hither
and thither. He who in such a juncture would
rally men once more to the flag must possess
or must seize authority. Hi.s words must be
commands, and he must be ready to shoot, the
mutineer dead in his tracks. In such a case
men will obey authority, and authority oniv.
When Christ sends Peter to rally his panic
stricken apostles shall we believe that he sent
him without as much authority as we would
give a policeman in a stampede? Unless he
has power and can speak as one having power,
all his efforts will be in vain; but because he
has authority and because he speaks as one
having authority he is able to confirm the
brethren as his master commanded.
But the Rev. Dr. Wendte thinks otherwise
"Peter, he says, "was a man of intense and
striking Individuality, a singular blending of
stren-rth and weakness, faith and (ear. He~waa
always foremost unions the disciples to spea* and
act. Hence, Jesus naturally looked to him to be
come a pillar of the church, and by his fait and
fervor to -strengthen the brethren' in the hour of
trial."'
Christ's words give us a different impression
I do not suppose here that he is mure than a
man, or that he could see into the future or
that his prayers were efficacious. I take his
words as expressing his thoughts, whether
inese thoughts were correct or not. Now then
our Lord's words evidently imply 'that the
devil had got hold ot the whole apostolic col
lege. To Jews, saturated with the Old Testa
ment, his expression meant that Satan had ob
tained them, as of old he had obtained Job. In
this juncture what did Christ do? He dots not
rely on Peter's fervor; he relies on his own
prayers. Peter shall not fail, and the obvious
intention of Christ's words is that he does not
fail because of Christ's prayers. Dr. Wendte
may not believe that Christ's prayers could
have this effect, but It is evident that whoever
wrote the gospel had a different opinion.
Anyhow it little matters why Peter did not
fail. Christ gives him a certain duty to per
form as soon as conversion comes. That duty
is to be exercised by him toward the other
apos les. How on the face of this commission
can any one hold that "Peter was never in
vested by Jesus Christ with any extraordinary
authority over the other disciples."
3. Thk Commission to Bind and Loose.
As a "linal proof" that St. Peter received no
special power or authority Dr. Wendie says:
In the Gospel of Matthews (XVfll:18) we read
that Jesus committed the power to bind and loose,
to retain and remit Sin, not only to Peter, bnc. to all
the disciples. "Verily. I say unto you, whatsoever
ye bind on earth shall be bound In heaven,
and whatsoever ye loose on earth shall
be loosen in heaven." Whatever weight
of authority we may- attach to this
mysterious passage, one thing- is assured, the keys
of heaven are in the hands of no oue privileged
mediator between man and Ood. Every disciple Is
a priest of the Most High; every pure soul Is nod's
temple, every honest thought, every virtuous
action and holy prayer brinys us Into immediate
and intimate relations with our father in Heaven,
promotes our present felicity and opens the King
dom of Heaven to all believers.
This is another of these beautiful and mys
terious passages in which Dr. Wendte delights.
As a matter of fact, there is absolutely nothing
mysterious about it. The expression "to bind
and to loose" was one quite familiar to the
Jews and possessed a well-defined meaning. It
is a metaphor, certainly, but a metaphor easy to
be understood. It means tjie powur of making
and abrogating laws, that legislative authority
which is a function of the supreme govern
ment of any society.
When, therefore, our Lord said to St. Peter,
"Whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth shall
be bound also in heaven," he gives him is
plain terms the supreme legislative power in
his church. Dr. Wendte, however, objects that
this, power is given to all the other apostles as
well. In order to see the strength of his argu
ment let us read the whole text. Christ is
speaking to the disciples:
Tf thy brother sin against thee, go, shew him
his fault between theo mid him alone; if he hear
thee thou hast pained thy brother. But if he hear
thee not take with thee one ortwomore, that at the
mouth of two witnesses or three every word may
be established. And if he refuse to hear then tell
it utito th; church; and 1( he refuse to hear the
church also lot him be unto thee as the Gentile
and the publican. Verily I say unto you. what
things soever ye shall bind on earth Fhall be hound
In heaves; and what things soever ye shall loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
It is evident here that Christ is dealing with
a particular circumstance; namely, excom
munication. Whcu the church expels a man
Christ promises to ratify the expulsion. Hence
the object of the legislative power is restraint
to this particular case.
It. however, it be urged.â and most Catholics
agreeâ thai the words, "What things soever,"
are universal, and that the object on which
the power is exercised does not restrict tne
power itself, we should then grant that by this
text the legislative power was given to
the church. Dr. Wendte's claim that
the power is given to each individual
disciple is as absurd as to claim
that each individual member of Congress
possesses the legislative power. Christ is
speaking not to each, but he is speaking to
borne kind of a society, call it church or
congregation or what you will. He has made
a complete distinction between the brother,
the two witnesses and the society. To the so
ciety he gives the binding and the loosing
power to each disciple.
However, the privilege given to Peter was
absolutely personal. To him and to him by
name was given the game power which is con
ferred upon the whole church. When the
whole church meets in council w th J'ope at
itshead.it nas undoubtedly supreme legisla
tive power. That very same supreme legisla
tive power was given by Christ to St. Peter in
dividually, and was not given individually to
any other of the apostles.
Hence we see, Mr. Editor, that all the objec
tions brought against my argument by Dr.
Wendte do not touch the case at all. lie has
not succeeded in explaining a>vay these plain
ami unequivocal texts of Scripture which
demonstrate the primacy of St. Peter. Let us
now see if he can, from the whole of the New
Testament, produce a single fact or saying
which will militate against the Catholic teach
ing that Christ constituted Peter the head of
the church.
B. OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE FACT.
To disprove the fact that Peter was given
a supremacy over the apostles. Dr. Wendte
produces three arguments: 1. Our Lord pro
vided against a primacy; 2. The ancient or
ganization of the church lett no room for a
primacy, and, 3. The Apostolic history shows
no traces of a primacy. I will consider each
oi these arguments in order.
1. Christ Provided Against a Primacy.
"Once more," says Dr. Wendte, "while Jesus
may have intended to make Peter prominent
in the apostolic circle, it was entirely without
any Idea oÂ£ his supremacy or rule over them.
This is shown by the striking incident, nÃr
rated by the synoptics, that on one occasion
when the disciples were disputing on this very
pointâ who should be the greatest in the king
dom ot heaven (Matt. xx:2O-24)â Jesus, instead
of solemnly putting forward Peter, as he would
naturally ha\e done if he had destined him
for the primacy, Jesus rebukes their selfish
contention by placing a child in their midst
und telling them of such is the kingdom of
heaven. Christ himself recognized no su
premacy. He said: "The princes of the gea
tave il^minion and great authority over
them. But it shall not be so among you; but
whosoever shall be chief among yon'let him
be your servant." And Jesus, to give them an
example of this humble service, performs the
menial office of washing their feet.
I have already touched on an incident simi
lar to this related by St. Luke, and which took
lilace at the last supper. Dr. Wendte evidently
has confounded both. 1 will copy out the
text in full, for there is nothing more mislead
ing than scraps of Scripture torn from their
i context:
'i lien came to him the mother of the sods of
Zebe with her sous, worshiping him and ask
inK a certain thin; of him. And he said unto her,
What uouldst thou? She saith unto him. Com
mand that these my two sons may sit, one on thy
right hand and one on-thy left hand, in thy kinsi
dom. But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not
what ye ask. Are ye able to drinK the cup that I
am about 10 drink? They say unto him, We are
able. He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall
drink, but to sit on my right hand and on my left
hand is not mine to give, but it Is for them lor
whom it has been prepared of my Father. And
when the ten heard it they were moved with in
dignation concerning the two brethren. But
Jesus called them unto him and said,
Ye know that the rulers of the gentiles
lord it over them, and their great ones exercise au
thority over them. Not -so shall it be among you;
but whosoever would become great among you
shall be your minister, and whosoever would be
first among you shall be your servant. Even so
the Son Of Man came not to be mistered unto, but
to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
many.
There is also another similar incident re
lated in the eighteenth St. Matthew:
In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, say
ing, who then is gmetesl in the kingdom of
heaven?" And he called unto him a little Child
and set him in the midst of them, and said,
Verily I say unto you, except ye turn and become
as little children, ye shall in no. wise enter into the
kingdom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall
humble himself us this little child, the same is the
greatest iv the kingdom of heaven.
From these texts it will be seen that Dr.
Wendte has mixed up three distinct and sepa
rate events to make an argument against St.
Peter. lam surprised that he manifests such a
confused acquaintance with the words of the
Holy Bible.
It will be seen from an unbiased reading of
all these texts that Christ tacitly acknowledges
the existence of places of honor in his church.
He knows too well, however, how prone the
heart of man is to pride and how the holiest
office of religion may be prostituted to per
sonal glory. As long as men, not angels, are
ministers of the gospel this must be. Christ
tries to guard against it as much as possible.
He does not cure the sin by killing the sinner.;
he does not prevent pride by abolishing places.
Rather he lays down the "maxim that they
who are to hold the offices are to be the
humblest of all. He admits that there are
offices in his kingdom, but they are not ob
tained by intrigue or by influence. Rather
should they be bought by humility and be
coming as little chii-lren.
Dr. Wendte's argument against the existence
of offices in Christ's church, as 1 have said
above, proves too much. Christ was certainly,
as a matter of fact, the head of his church.
He was a teacher, a rabbi, a prophet, a king.
This the apostles believed. Was he not us
muchaki::g in their eyes when he washed
their feet as when he scourged the Pharisees
with his woes? Was he not more a king? Did
not the act receive its significance from the
fact that he was the Master, and do not his ex
hortations receive their force from the fact
that he was addressing those who were to be
set by the Holy Ghost to rule the church of
God?
Dr. Wendte says that Christ should naturally
have set forth Peter as the head of the church
When the^e contentions arose I answer that
he did. Not on every occasion it is true, tor
he was not exhibiting the apostle as a prize
calf. But on the occasion 01 the last supper,
when the eleven fell to fighting again, he
stopped their contentions torever by telling
them that Satan had got them all except one
and that one, Peter, was to have the duty of
confirming the rest.
Hence how baseless, how unsubstantial Dr.
Wendte's argument is may be seen lrom these
i-oiiMderatious. I am tempted to quote his
own words against him. His claim thai Christ
repudiated a primacy "is disclosed to be en
tirely unfounded, a fiction built on the most
6ienaer basis of tact, a myth which dissolves
into thin air," not at such an elaborate per
formance as "the first dawning of an enlight
ened reason and conscience," but at a simple
inspection of tha Bible record.
How can our worthy Dr. Wendte meet such
facts as these?
ii. The ancient Cur kch Was Not Hieraechi
cal.
The second argument urged by Dr. Wendte
against the primacy of St. Peter is that there
was no room for it in the ancient church. He
says :
Indeed, in the Bible the word "church" Is never
used 10 signify a hierarchy in the Jlom&n Catholic
sense. It always means an assembly or congrega
tion. No such onice iS that of liisnop. in the
Romish sense of a lifelong' tenure and supreme
priestly authority over the whole congregation, is
to be found In the early church, from its Institution
down to the line of Nero. The first church officers
Dientioi.ed in the New Testamentâ the deacons
(Acts vi-2-6) - were ordained by all the apostles in
comix.ou, not by Peter alone.
I am afraid that Dr. Wendte Is inventing
Catholic doctrine as he has been inventing
Scripture. The penny Catechism defines the
church as follows:
" The church is the concregation of all those
who profess the faith of Christ, partake of the
sum-- sacraments and are governed by their
lawful pastors under one visible head."

constituted by Christ. Indeed there is noth
ing in the New Testament more evident than
the fact that Christ divided his kingdom into
the teachers and the taught. From the multi
tude of his disciples he selected twelve
(Matt. x). Them he sent forth to preach. At
the end of his stay on earth he commanded
them to make disciples of all the nations
(Matt, xxxiii). He gave them powerto adminis
ter snered rites such as baptism, penance (John
xx) and the hoiy communion (I Cor. xi). He
made them legislators, whose laws should bind
the very consciences of men. (Matt, xviii).
Moreover, these powers he gave only to cer
tain officers. As St. Paul puts it, "God hath set
some in the church; lirst, apostles; secondly,
prophets; thirdly, teachers; then powers, then
gifts of healing, etc. Are all apostles? Are
all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all work
ers of miracles? Have all gifts of healings?
Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret:"
And again (Ephes. iv; 11), "He (Jesus) gave
some to be apostles, and some prophets, and
some pastors and tenr hers, for the perfecting
of the saints unto the work of ministering
unto the building up of the body of Christ till
we all attain unto the unity of the faith."
That it is to say, there shall "be in the church
men to instruct, to govern, to minister, by the
appointment of Christ, until the la>t soul is
gathered to the shecpiold with the Good Shep
herd on the eternal hills.
Hence it is that we iind the church assuming
a hierarchical form immediately after the
death oi Christ. Another succeeds to the office
from which Judas had fallen and obtains the
same grace and apostoleship as the eleven.
Paul and Barnabas are set aside for a certain
work arid straightway they proceed to appoint
elders or bishops in every church. Nothing
can be conceived more diverse from the apos
tolic practice than a modern Protestant con
gregation. II the Christians of Crete were any
thing like our California Unitarians they
must have considered that Paul had un
paiallcled|impudt-nce;when he handed them
over to Titus. "Heretofore 1 left thee in Crete
that thou shonldst appoint elders or bishops
in every city." If by some dispensation of
providence Titus should some day appear in
Oakland, accompanied by Dr. Stebbins, and
order Dr. Wendte over to Franklin street, I am
afraid the congregation woutd have a unani
mous tit. The apostle who wrote of the over
seers whom the Holy Ghost had placed to rule
the church of God would have very little sym
pathy with the modern system whereby no
member of the church Is compelled to obey
except the unfortunate pastor.
For these reasons I conclude that Dr.
Wendte's attempt to block out St. Peter is not
a success. There is no use arcruing against a
fact, and the facts of apostolic history are in
favor of the Pope.
3. The Apostolic Church.
Dr. Wendte gives four reasons for his asser
tion that the history of the apostolic church
shows no traces of the primacy of Peter. I
will consider these four reasons separately:
(a) The apostles exercised their authority in
common.
He says: The first church officers mentioned
in the New Testamentâ the deacons (Acts
vi:2-6) â were ordained by all the apostles iv
common, not by Peter akine. So, ag;ai;i, when
earnest teachers are needed in Samaria (Acts
vii:l4) the apostles exercise their collective
authority and send Peter and John thither.
I might remind Dr. Wendte that the practice
of ordination in common is still carried on in
the Catholic Church, and does not at all prove
that the bishop is not the governor oi the dio
cese. When the presiding officer oi the Senate
votes for a bill, and thus passes it, he does not
cease to be Vice-President of the United States.
Some people imagine that St. Peter could not
have been head of the church unless he was
grabbing every, hing in sight. If 1 may say it
without disrespect the proper answer to Dr.
Wendte's objection is that St. Peter was no hoe.
That he was sent into Sr.maria with John is
a very peculiar way to prove that he was not
head of the apostles. Suppose in the present
war scare the English Cabinet should decide
to send Queen Victoria over to Germany to
mollify her grandson, would that prove she
was not Queen of England? Ptter and John
were sent because they were considered best
fitted for the work, and that Peter went only
proves that he patterned himself on his Mas
ter, who came not to be ministered unto but to
minister.
To what desperate straits must men be re
duced when they bring forward such cobweb
arguments as these to batter down the rock!
(6 The Council of Jerusalem.
Still more significant is the testimony af
forded by the council or synod of apostles
mentioned in the fifteenth' chapter of the
Book of Acts. Peter does not preside over it,
as lie would naturally have done if he hart
been recognired as primate. He defends his
own course like a private member of the con
gregation, aud James is the one who proposes
the compromise which is finally adopted by
the apostles, elders and congregatiou in settle
ment oi their differences.
It v ould tiike up too much room to copy out
this text. However, as this letter will appear
on Sunday your reader?, Mr. Editor, could' not
do better'ttinn read the whole fifteenth chap
ter of the Acts ot the Apostles. They will find
that there is not the slightest hint given that
Peter did not preside e.t the synod. Indeed,
his words have an authoritative Found. He
does not defend his course, as Dr. Wendte
says, but he simply tells what he did, as if the
fact that he did it were sufficient justification.
What James hus to do with the question no
one can tell. That he proposed a compromise,
or that the compromise was adopted, proved
nothing for his superiority. One might as well
claim that Mr. Wilson, the- author of a com
promise tariff act, is the President of the
United States. Hence, 1 am afraid that Dr.
Wendte will get cold comfort from the council
of Jerusalem. The description of it contains
not a single sentence to show that Peter was
relegated to a second place.
(c) I'aul withstood him face to face.
To prove that St. Peter wr.s not the head of
thechurcu Dr. Wendte produces the famous
t x! from the Galatians. He says:
"Peter was no rock when in apostolic times,
in subservience to the narrow" policy of the
Jewish wing of the church, he was unfaitnful
to his own highest conviction, opposed the
necessary world-historic development of Chris
tian truth, and drew upon himself the stern
rebuke of Paul (iialatians 11:11-21), who ac
cused him of falsehood, hypocrisy and thwart
ing the will of God. This frau'^ criticism in
which Paul indulged, doty not look like an ac
knowledgment on lu> pa-t of the primacy and
sovereign authority of Peter."
If tliere is anything that delights me it Is to
6ee the beautnul way in -which the modern
preacher can pitch into St. Peter. I do not
know what special spite they have against
him, but they seem to revel in hurling epi
thets at him. In the beginning of his letter
Dr. Wendte reproached me with solemn face
and lugubrious voice for my bad language, and
here he is live minutes after calling St. Peter a
liar, a hypocrite and a coward. lie reproves
me for applying to a live sinner terms which
he does not scruple to apply to a dead saint.
Now, let us see what bearing St. Paul's con
duct has upon the supremacy of Peter. The
mere fact that he resisted the Pope to his face
proves nothing. Many a man has resisted his
superior to his face end gloried in it. Why
not St. Paul? In fact, if we study the circum
stances under which this resistance took placo
we will find another and a stronger argument
in favor of St. Peter's prerogative.
The statement that St. Paul withstood St.
Peter is found in the second chapter of the
Epistle to the Gnlatians. These Galatlans were
troubled by mischief-makers, who insisted that
the Jewi.Â«h law was binding on ail Chris inns.
As this was directly oppo.-ed to St. Paul's
teaching the Judaizers, as they were called,
strove to belittle his authority by d'.-clarin-,'
that he was not a genuine npostle but a late
comer, who had never walked with Christ on
earth, and who, therefore, was not competent
to declare what the true Faith was. The Epistle
to the nalatians was written to enforce the
idea that St. Paul was a true apostle and capa
ble of saying that his teaching concerning the
Jewish law was correct.
The proof which he offers is the testimony
of St. Peter. He 6ays that after his call at
Damascus he went into Arabia for three years
to prepare for his mission. Before he entered
on that mission, however, he writes: "I came
to Jerusalem to see Peter and I abode with nim
fifteen days." Now, if Peter had not some
peculiar office In the church why should Bt
Paul single him out for a visit? P'eier was not
even Bishop Of Jerusalem, and to James, who
was Bishop, St. Paul only refers in passing
When we read in mediaeval history that the
Apostles to the barbarians, like St. Patrick and
St. Boniface, went to Rome to visit the Pope
before setting out on -heir missions we under
stand that they recognized the supremacy of
the Bishop of Home. Whan St. Paul goes to
Jerusalem to visit St. Peter beiore beginning
his apostolic career is it reasonable to suppose
that it means nothing at all "
Moreover, St. Paul is strong on the point that
Peter's approbation was sufficient to vouch for
him. He adds. "And no other apostle did I
see except James, the brotner cf the Lord."
According to the theory of Dr. Wendte, that
James was rising into prominence, he should
have called on James first; but St. Paul, just as
any other good Catholic to-day would do, be
gan by paying his respects to the Pope.
Then he goes on to make a further appeal to
Peter. His visit to Jerusalem shows that he
was recognized as a true aposile, now he wants
to show that Peter himself preaches the same
doctrine about the non-binding character of
the Jewish law. This he does by recalling the
Incident at Antioch. Antioch was a Gentile
city and St. Peter made no distinctions between
his conveits from paganism and his converts
from Judaism. St. Paul records the fact that he
ate with the Gentiles. When, however, the ex
tremists began to as.sert that the Jewish law still
continued in force and emissaries arrived from
Jerusalem, then St. Peter, fearing to offend the
Jewish party, withdrew from the conversion
of the Gentiles. This was simply a prudenmu
movo and was recommended by St. Paul him
self on another occasion, when he says: "1 will
not eat meat if it scandalize my brother." St.
Peter's action, however, though indifferent in
itself, appeared v. St. Paul as calculated to pro
duce a bad effect. He realized that the
Judaizers were rapidly advancing to the
heretical position which they afterword
rer-ched of declaring that the law absolutely
bound nil. He therefore considered Peter's
action as favoring a dangerous faction. For
tins reason "he resisted him to the face." The
resistance, indeed, was a very Giruple matter.
It consisted, so to speak, in "giving away" to
the visitors from Jerusalem the fact that St.
Peter was in the habit of eat/in? with the Gen
tiles. "I said to Peter before all," he writes to
the Galatians, "if thou who art a Jew does live
like the Gentiles, why v.ouldst thou compel the
Gentiles to live like Jews?"
This is practically an appeal to the supreme
authority of the prince of the apostles against
a faction who were using him to justify their
errors. That Paul could resist Peter on this
nintter merely proves that Paul's doctrine was
right. It brings shamefaced Peter before the
Galatians to bear witness that this newfangled
apostle is correct in his teachings. Now if
Peter's witness is not in some way authorita
tive, why should Paul be so anxious to have
him on his side? "Does not the fact look like
an acknowledgment on his part of the primacy
and sovereign authority of Peter?"
(d) The glorification of John.
Dr. Wendte tries to show that there waÃ a
gradual obscuration of St. Peter as the church
grcv,- older. How this obscuration can be
proved is to me a mystery. All we know about
the apostolic church is to be found in the New
Testament, and surely Dr. Wendte does not
consider that a bundle of old letters is a very
good method for obtaining anything like the
proper perspective of history. What Dr.
Wendte says about the Gospel of St. John is, I
am sorry to say, incorrect. In fact, John re
lates how our Lord washed Peter's feet first of
all. He tells of himself, how, when he outran
Peter to the tomb, he waited and would not
enter till Peter had preceded him. Above all,
he records the giving of that superhuman task,
"Feed my lambs, feed my sheep." Certainly
this does not look as if Peter was depreciated
by the fourth Gospel.
These, Mr. Editor, are all the objections
against the primacy of St. Peter that I have
been able to gather from Dr. Wendte's letter.
What their value is your readers can now
judge. No evidence has been brought forward
to show that Peter is not the only ruck, or that
the change of his m>.rae to P.ock does not indi
cate his supreme power. The commission to
confirm the brethren is a special commission,
not the result of a mere natural char
acteristic. His legislative power he re
ceives in common with the body of which
he was a member, but he also receives it
alone as a personal and individual gift. His
primacy fits in with the hierarchical constitu
tion of the church as established by Christ
and no word or act in all apostolical history
can be alleged against that primacy. The very
texts and arguments which :ire sent up to con
fute him range themselves upon his side.
No, Dr. Weodte'a honest a;:d impartial re
view of the liible testimony proves nothing
agAinst the prince oi the apubties. Clear nud
definite texts stand forth in his favor.
What is brought to confute him? A few
straggling passnees from all parts of
the Bib'eâ unwilling conscripts who escape
as soon as they get an opening, [jet
Dr. Wendte consider well the straits in which
he puts himself by yielding to preconceived
idens. Some of the "noblest passages in the
Scripture he is compelled to dismiss with the
epithet mysterious He loses the key which
unlocks not only the obscure chambers of
apostolic history but he loses the explanation
of the long dealing* of God with man.
11. THE PERMANENCY OF THE PRIMACY.
In my original letter I stated the Catholic
argument in the following words:
1. The society which Christ established to
teach his doctrines must last forever. He is
with it even to the end of the world.
'2. This society rests upon the rock, and be
cause it rests upon the rock it is victorious
over the gates of hell; hence the rock must en
dure as long as the church, for no building can
stfuid without a foundation.
3. Peter, therefore, must ever remain in the
church as its perpetual defense, as its ruler, as
the shepherd of the lambs and sheep.
4. But Peter lived only lor a few years.
Therefore, unless he has a successor the plans
of Christ came to untight almost as soon as
they were put into operation. No one can
predicate this of him who is infinite wisdom
and infinite power.
To this Dr. Wendte replies: "Even if he had
been so invested, there is rothit-.g to show
that tliis authority was or could be trans
ferred to succeeding generations of disciples."
As he gives no reason for his denial my posi
tive statement stands, becau=e I have given my
reason for it.
111. ST. PKTF.K AND ROME.
Dr. Wendte has summed up his conclusions
concerning the connection of St. Peter with
Rnme in three propositions:
Peter was never Bishop in Rome.
Peter never Ã¼bode in Home for any such term
as is claimed for him in the official declara
tions of the Roman Catholic Church,
Peter was, in all probability, never in Rome
at ail.
1 will consider these propositions one by one.
1. Peter was Bishop of Rome.
The only reason given by Dr. W-ndte for his
denial of Pater's episcopate in Rome is ih;it
'â¢the unanimous tradition of the church fatu
ers designates one Linus as the first. Roman
Bishop." I really do not see how he can make
such a wild statement. His own beiovd Lip-
Bius now acknowledges that Hippolytus, in
that portion of his chronicle froni which j
the first part of the Liberiau catalogue
of the Popes was derived, counts Peter |
as first Bishop of Rome. My author- j
it y is C. P. B. Alnatt. "Was" St. Peter |
Bi-hop of Romp." He gives as his reference i
bictionnry of Christ, Biography and Litcru
ture, vol. i, pp. s<>7, 555, 577. Irenceus declares
that "The blessed apostles having founded
nnd built up the Church of Rome, delivered
the episcopate to Linus." The difficulty
which is sometimes made that Linus is called
the first is easily met by the explanation that I
the fathers count "from the apostles," i ust as j
they say that Ananias was the first Bishop of
Alexandria after Mark. Indeed, I am very
much afraid that Dr. Wendte will find it hard
to prove that the fathers are unanimous, as he
asserts.
One statement of Dr. Wendte I notice with
great surprise. He says:
"It is not untii 100 years after the reported
death of the Ap -tie Peter that we come upon
testimonies to ibe general tradition existing
at Rome of his sojourn, primacy and death
there. Now lou years is a lons* time. How
many legends and myths have uriÂ«en in
our own enlightened country during the
pu.-t hundred yean and still persist? Kow
much more must this not have been the case in
the ignorant, uncritical, credulous and turbu
lent arre which witnessed the downfall of the
Roman empire and the transformation of the
spiritual democracy of Jesus and his disciples
into the monarchical constitution of ;h>
Roman hierarchy, especially when it was so I
inanife>tly for the interests of the clergy to
spread the doctrine of Peter's Roman primacy."
With referenfe to this, allow me to remark,
that the Christian literature of the first century
is very scant; and Dot of such a natureas would
indicate anything whatsoever about matters of
history. We have, however, pretty clear and
convincing evidence from thirty-three years
after the death of Peter, that the Roman See
exercised lys primrcy. Moreover, I beg em- I
phatically t" deny that this century was '-igno
rant, uncritii !. turbulent or credulous." it
was the century which saw Ro;;ie's greatest
glory, and :is far as Learning or skepticism, or
pence goes, it could well compare with our
own. I a:r afraid lir. Wendte has been mixing
up hii history n.s he has been mixing up his
scripture.
2. The Official Records.
Dr. Wendte goes into a long arithmetical and
chronological discussion to j rove th<Â» Rumen
r. cords wrong. "It la claimed," he Bays, "in!
the official declaration of the Koman Catholic
church (Liber Pontificalia, etc), that Peter rÂ©>
sided in Rome twenty-five years aiui more, but
that he had previously served for ten years as
Bishop of Ar.tioch."
Dr. Wendte might have spared himself all
the trouble. It is nowhere claimed that St.
Peter's residence at Rome or at Antiocn was
continuous. He uiifrht as well try to prove
that Archbishop Rlordan is not Archbishop of
Pan Francisco because he spent some time in
Europe.
3. Was St. Peter in Rome?
Dr. Wendte produces a long and learned
array of names to show that he was
not. I can produce as long and as
learned a list to prove that he was. How
ever, I would remark that for 1300 years there
was never a suspicion breathed that Peter was
not at Rome. Again the most learned scholars
of Protestantism hold with us. Dr. Wendte de
clares that Llpslus 'has forever destroyed the
so-called historical foundation for Peter's
primacy at Rome." If he would care about
seeing lapsing himself destroyed by another
Protestant I refer him to Hi'lgenfeld's Zeit-
Bchrift, 1877, pp. 486-508, where "he entirely
disposes of the arguments alleged by Lipsius
and other critics against the presence and mar
tyrdom of St. Peter in Rome."
Dr. Wendte considers that the silence of St.
Paul about Peter in his epistle to the Romans
is an argument f-.gainst St. Peter's presence
there. He should remember that the same
silence is maintained concerning John in the
letter to the Ephesiane at a time when John
was r.ndoubtably in Ephesus.
Finally the interpretation of Babylon in St.
Peter's epistle as Rome is supported by such
testimony Catholic and Protestant that the
truth of it is no longer open to doubt. Dr.
Wendte seems to imagine that, only Catholics
hold this view, but I refer him to the "Speakers'
Commentary" 'a Protestant work) both for
proofs and authorities. He will find there that
the opposite theory in the words of Dr. Farrar,
"will not bear a moment's consideration."
Hence I conclude that Dr. Wendte's objec
tion to St. Peter's residence in Rome, like his
objections to the primacy, are inspired more
by the desire to down the Pope at any cost
rather than by the desire for historical accu
racy.
Dr. Wendte has said many things about the
church, but in such a vague and general way
that I cannot find anything on which to base an
argument. He speaks of founding an American
Church upon the runs of the Papacy. Year
after year the downfall of Peter has been
prophesied, and lo! he still stands. Year after
year the Kates of hell have raged against him
but they have not prevailed. Generation after
generation of his enemies has come and gone
and he has outlived them all. Century after
century passes by and he grows notold. "There
are no gray hairs on the head of Judah. who
reneweth his youth like the eagle, whose fee
are as the feet of harts and underneath the
everlasting arms." Yours truly, P. C. Youke.

BOWMAN ANSWERS YORKE.
The Editor of the American Patriot Eeplies to
the Editor of the Monitor
H. W. Bowraan, editor of the American
Patriot, contributes the following letter to
the famous religious controversy in the
form of an answer to the recent letter of
Father Yorke :
Office of the American Patriot,
819 Market street. J
Editor of San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir: In a
previous article we called attention to some of
the political principles of the Papacy as mani
fested in the bulls of Popes and the indorse
ments of Catholic writers. The Papacy here in
the United Slates upon these principles is an
incontrovertible fact. We will restate the prop
ositions and cite tacts to substantiate our state
ments. Proposition 1: "The Romish church
has a right to exercise its authority without
any limit .set to it by the civil power." Proof
from American history: The refusal to con
form to the educational policy of our Govern
ment and the establishment of parochial
schools in opposition to those of the state is in
controvertible evidence of Koine's assumption
of spiritual sovereignty over the state. The at
tempt to obtain state-endowed schools and a
part of the money raised by taxation to sup
port her sectarian schools is confirmatory evi
dence of the same. Rome has denied the right
of the state to educate its children.
Pope Leo has quoted with approval the state
ment ot Pius JX in reference to the right of
the church to educate, independent of secular
limitation. It is as follows: "But toexclude
the church which God himself has constituted
â¢ â¢ * from the teachings of youth * â¢ â¢ is
a creat and pernicious error.'- (Quoted in the
encyclical on "The Christian Constitution of
States.") The determined opposition of the Ro
man hierarchy to our schoul system Is self
evident proof of their adherenceto this papal
tenet. In a Roman Catholic publication, en
titled "Brownson's Vibws,"ana published by
P.erziger Bros., there is an article on "Educa
tion." In it the author says: "Education
should be under church control." Â» * *
"This sort of education can be given only by
the church or under her direction and control";
and as there is for us Catholics only one
church, there is and can be no proper educa
tion for us not given by or under direction and
control of the Catholic church"(page 61). Again
on page 63 he says: 'â¢The state has no right
to educate. As American citizens we object to
the assumption of the control of education or
of any action in regard to it by the General
Government." On page Gi he asserts: "We
deny, of Course, as Catholics, the right of the
civil Government to educate, for education is
a function oi the spiritual society." On puce
65 he declares: "All education, as all life,
should be religious, and all education divorced
from religion b an evil, not a good, and is sure
in the lorn: run to be ruinous to the secular or
der." That is, in learning arithmetic they
should learn how to string beads, and in learn
ing how toeing "Hall, Columbia!" they should
be taught how to say, "Hail, Mary:"
This is a mere sample of the tone of the
Romish press and pulpit, It manifests their
hostility to American law. Although some
States of the Union have adopted a compul
sory educational law they, in open defiance of
it, erect parochial schools and send their chil
dren to them.
Proposition 2â ''The Pope and priests ought
to have dominion over temporal affairs."
Secular education is a function of the state,
yet Pope Leo sends Satolli here to dictate to
the* American Government in regard to the
education of youth. The laws of the land
make marriage a civil contract, yet Pope Leo
and his priests repudiate the law of the State
and teach that marringÂ© is a sacrament; hence
marriage by civil law â 10 use the Pope's own
wordsâ is "legal concubinnge instead of legiti
mate union." (First Encyclical.) Again, in
regard to the holding of property, the hier
archy as.-ert their right to hold property under
the laws of the church and in defiance to those
of the state. The fact that Pope Leo has dic
tated the political actions of American citizens
proves that he claims authority over the politi
cal powers of his adherents in America. He
has declared that "the constitution of states
should bo modeled after the principles of the
true church."
Proportion 3â "The Romish church and
her ecclesiastics have a right to immunity from
civil law." Civil Ihw taxes pr >perty tor the
use of the state. Rome claims that her church
property should be exempt from taxation.
Civil lftw asserts that aiders and abettors of
criminals are amenable to the civil courts of
the land. Rome teaches that her ecclesiastics
may become cognisant of the most atrocious
crimps In the eon:e.isional-box and be under
no obligation to reveal them to the state.
Here in this country the Romanists have
Bought to exempt their priests from civil juris
diction in various instances. Romish police
men have taken drunken priests to tneir
homes instead of the lockup. In Hun Francisco,
last sprintr, a priest was allowed to testify
without taking the oath required by law.
Civil law in many States requires children to
attend the public schcols, but the Romish
church asserts her right to disregard this law.
civil Jaw declares all marriages performed
by the civil authorities are valid. Rome holds
and teaches that marriage is a sacrament,
hence cannot be performed by civil authori
ties. On January 10, 1880, Pope Leo issued an
encyclical on marriage and divorce, in which
among other ttv.ngs he said: "Marria?e, at
least in all that concerns the substance and
sanctity of the conjugal tie, is unessentially
sacred and religious act which naturally ought
to be regulated by the spiritual power, which
holds this power not as delegated by the state
or by the consent of princes."
In' his first encyclical Pope Leo, after ?peak
ing of some of the modern evils that afflict so
ciety, says: "We are convinced that the cause
oi these evils lies principally in the rejection
of the august authority of the church, which
crfsides over the human race in the name of
God, and is the safeguard or ail legitimate au
thority." â¢ â¢ â¢ "The right of the church to
instruct and educate youth is trampled under
foot." * * â¢ "Oh, that this salutary author
ity had never bÂ«cn neglected or repudiated!
i.'eriHinly tne civil power would never have
lost that august and sacred glory which it re
ceived from religion."
The Roman Pontiff, in sending Satolli here as
an EtnbaÂ«saik>r to our Government, set aside the
civil law which teaches there shall be no
union of church and state. In seeking to ob
tain funds from the state for sectarian pur
poses the Romish ecclesiastics have not only
trampled upon constitutional law, but have
enjoyed immunity from the penalty of its vio
lation. Rome claims the right to immure
young women in her convents and refuse them
their liberty w hen they desire to go free. This
is a violation of the laws of civa liberty. If
any other society were to thus rob people of
their liberty the strong arm of the law would
be invoked in their behalf. If Rome does not
claim a right to immunity from civil law why
are such prison pens allowed to exist in our
land?
Proposition 4â "ln case of a conflict be
tween the ecclesiastical and civil powers, the
ecclesiastical ousjht to prevail.' 1
That Rome adheres to this as a fundamental
doc.rine and thapes her policy in the United
States in accordance with it is proved by the
following tacts: First, tor over forty-eight
years the Church ot Rome has been in conflict
with the United Slates Government in regard
to the education of youth. Now, instead of
yielding to ihe laws ot the land and accepting
the system of education sanctioned by law, it
has persistently opposed it, thus proving that
it seeks to prevail in this conflict. To submit
to the civil power would prove its loyaliv, but
to thus stubborniy resist the law? of the' land
is to manifest the disloyalty of the hierarchy
Second, the following-described attempt to set
aside the civil law ia favor of the ecclesiastical
is an illustration of Rome's adherence to the
principle laid down in the above proposition.
Says Mr. Hogan:*
'"While I was a Romish priest in Philadelphia
a consultation was held between the papish
priests in the diocese of Philadelphia, and it
was secretly resolved by them that the best
way of checking Hogau's heresy, as they
termed my advocating the reading of the Bible,
Tins to take possession oi the church in which I
officiated in the name of the Pope. They ac
cordingly wrote to his Holiness, numbly pray
ing thls'mangod to send them out a Bishop
and to give him and his successors in office a.
lease of St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia and
all the appurtenances thereunto belonging.
Accordingly his royal Holiness, the Pope, sent
them a Bishop with the aforesaid lease. I was
immediately ordered out of the church, and
having refused to depart, unless the trustees
thought proper to remove me, thiÂ« emissary of
the Pope, only a few days or weeks in this
country, had me indicted for officiating in St.
Mary's "Church, although 1 had the full and un
divided consent of the trustee-.
"But the Bishop's legal right was questioned;
the case was brought betore the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania, Chief Justice Tignlman
presiding. I was discharged from bail and
custody, and the rights of tue trustees sus
tained. But the priests and the bishops were
not content with this decision. They put th. ir
heads once more together, and fancied that
they had discovered another mode by which
they could rob the people of their rights, and
defeat the intention of the donors of St. Mary's
Church; and what was their plan, think you,
fellow-citizens? The Bishop called a m<
of all the priests ar.d leading Roman Catholics
in the diocese. Every lay member was ordered
to bring with him a hickory stick (or club).
The meeting was held in the church of St.
Joseph; and at the hour of 12 at night the
Romisn Bishop of the diocese of Pennsylvania,
an Irishman, not more than a few months in
the co jntry, attended in his pontificals, told
the multitude, who were theru assembled, to
lay down their sticks in one pile, in
order that he might bless them for
their use. This was done asa matter of course.
The Bishop said mass, sprinkled holy water
upon the sticks, blessed them, and this done,
the whole party bound themselves by a solemn
vow never to cease until they elccied a Legis
lature in Pennsylvania that uould annul the
charter of St. Mary's Church; and, as an
American citizen, I biush to state the fact, they
succeeded. The charter was annulled by an
act of the Legislature, and property worth over
a million dollars would have passed into the
hands of the Pope and his agents were there
not a provision in the constitution of that
State empowering the Supreme Court to decide
upon the constitutionality of the acts of the
Legislature.
"We brought the constitutionality of the act
beiore the court, Justice Tighlman presiding.
The court decided in favor of the trustees and
myself. This, I believe, is the first attemp:
the Pope has made to establish his temporal
powers in this country. The priests have
headed the papists as a body and have resolved
to carry by tlio ballot-box their schemes."
The history of thirteen centuries bear testi
mony to the fact that Rome has taJten its stand
for the pre-eminence and supremacy of ecclesi
astical law und ecclesiastical authority when
ever the church and state are in presence to
gether and whenever civil and canon law are
in antagonism. In the last fifty years she has
tried it in various countries. She tried it in
England in 1531, when she parceled out the
dominion of Queen Victoria into ecclesiastical
principalities. She tried it la Italy and South
America upon the marriage question. She
tried it in Austria upon the question raised by
the concordat. She has tried in the United
States, Canada and Mexico upon the school
question.
"It has been maintained by the bulls of
Popes, the decrees of councils and the
anethemas of the priesthood. Its record has;
been written in the lurid flames of the auto da
fe, by the bleaching bones of earth's noblest
men and women, by dethroned kings, ex
communicated einpejrors, wrecked nations,
ruined states und impeded civilization.
In a book entitled, "Pope Leo XI.II, His Life
and Letters," by Key. J. P. Talbot, D.D., with
the indorsement of Rev. P. A. McKeiina, there
is an encyclical upon "The Christian Constitu
tion of .States. " The following are some of his
statements:
â  First â just as the end at which the church
aims is by far the noblest of ends, so its power
is the most exalted of all powers, and cannot
be held to be either inferior to the civil power
or in any way subject to it." (Page 372.) This
proves that he sets the church above the state,
On page 383 he says: "But to wish the church,
in the discharge of its offices, to be subject to
the civil power, is a great rashness, a great in
justice. If this were done order would be dis
turbed, since things natural would thus be put
before those which are above nature." * * *
"A well-regulated state cannot be when re
ligion is taken away."
Secondâ He quotes approvingly Pope Gregory
XVI in his encyclical of August, 1532, where
he says: "Nor can we hope happier results,
either for religion or the Government, from
the wishes of those who are eagerly desirous
that the church should be separated from the
state, and the mutual good understanding of
the sovereign secular power and the sacer
dotal authority be broken up. It is evident
that these lovers of most shameless liberty
dread that concord which has always been
fortunate and wholesome, both for sacred and
civil interests." This is indorsed by the latest
infallible, hence be authoritative.
Thirdâ He condemns as heretical errors the
following vital principles of our National con
stitution: (a) That the people are the source
of civil power. He says (page 334): "From
these decisions of the Popes it is clearly to be
understood that the origin of public power is
to be sought from God himself, and not from
the multitude." To understand the papal
meaning of this statement it is necessary to
quote his previous utterances relating to the
same thing. On pages 370 and 371 he says:
"It is clear that a state constituted on this ba
sis is altogether bound to satisfy, oy the public
profession of religion, the very many and great
duties which bring it into relation with God.
Nature and reason, which command every
man individually to serve God hoiily and re
ligiously â¢ * â¢ binds by the same "the civil
community. * â¢ * States cannot, without a
crime, act as thougn God did not
exist, or cast off the care of re
ligion as alien to them or useless, or
out of several kinds of religion adopt indiffer
ently which they please, but they are abso
lutely bound, in the worship of Deity, to adopt
that use and manner.in which God himself has
shown that he wills to be adored. Therefore,
among rulers the name of God must be holy,
and ii must be reckoned among the first of
their duties to favor religion (Roman, of
coarse), protect it and cover it with the au
thority of the laws, and not to institute or de
cree anything that is incompatible with its
security." As the Romish Church claims to
be the infallible teacher it follows that the
State must learn from her its relation to God
and its duties to him, hence must depend upon
the church for the authority of its laws.
(6.) He asserted that religious liberty was a
crime. "It is a crime for States to treat in the
same way different kinds 01 religion" (p. 384).
Religious equality in the eyes of the law is one
of the cardinal principles of our Government.
(c.) He condemns freedom of thought, speech
and press. "The uncontrolled right of think
ing and publicly proclaiming one's thoughts
is not inherent in the rights of citizens, nor in
any sense to be placed among those thing 3
which are worthy of favor and patronage"
(p. 384).
(d.) He condemns the Declaration of Inde
pendence that "all men are born free and
equal" (p. 331). "From this spring came
those more recent propositions of unbridled
liberty. Of those principles the chief is that
one which proclaims all men, as by birth and
nature they are alike, so in very deed in their
actions of life are they equal, "and each is so
master of himself that in no way does he come
under the authority of another; that it is for
him to freely think on whatever subject he
likes; that no one else has a right of ruling over
others. In a society founded upon these princi
ples government is only the will of the people."
In condemning such a basis of government he
has assailed the fundamental principles of our
republican form of government. I hold in my
possession a book written by a famous Cath
olic authorâ Rev. J. Balmesâ published by
John Murphy & Co., Baltimore, and entitled
"Protestantism and Catholicity Compared in
Their Effects on the Civilization of Europe."
It is highly recommended by priests and
bishops. lii hit chapter upon '"Resistance to
the Civil Power he begs his readers to "bear
in mind the general principles at all times in
culcated by Catholicity, viz.. the obligation of
obeying legitimate authority." (P. 325.)
In order to make the desired application of
this principle, and to explain what he means
by legitimate authority, he puts and answers a
most pertinent question, as follows: "In the
first place, are we to obey the civil power when
it commands something that is evil in itself?
No, we are not; for the simple reason that
what is evil in itself is forbidden by God; now
we must obey God rather than man." (P. 326.)
"In the second p.ace, are we to obey the civil
power when it interferes in matters not in
cluded in the circle of its faculties? No- tor in
regard to these matters it is not a power." (P.
As he contends that the church should be
left perfectly free to enact its own laws, and
whenever the State undertakes to subject the
church to its laws it passes beyond the "circle
of its faculties," it follows that the laws the
church opposes it need not obey.
After establishing his . premises ho lays
down as the logical result of the doctrines
mahitamed by the Roman Catnolic church
"1. â¦* c cannot, under any circumstances,
in?inâ¢Â£& unjust they are not bind
"3. It may become necessary to obey these
laws from motives of prudence; that is i., or
der to avoid scandal and commotions."
.When we remember that all of the edicts of
the Pope are to them divine law, and that all
laws are unjust that are not sanctioned by the
Pope, we see how that Romanists could resist
our civil rulers without (to them) commltt!

duced In this article proves that the papal
church as an organization "has politics for
its principles, monarchy for its object and
religion for its garb." It is founded upon for
gery maintained by fraud and defended by
deceit. It has fomented sedition, incited re
bellion, usurped authority ami plundered the
public to pamper its pride. It has slaughtered
freedom, shackled science, cursed progress,
and built its throne of despotism upon the
ruins of liberty. Its priests kneel at the shrine
of bigotry and swear to defend its unholy prin
ciples. Its head, the Pope, as its chief legisla
tor, is held to be infallible. Its record of blood
is whitewashed, and its corruption veneered,
soastomnke it appear beautiful to the eyes
of Americans. Ignorance may revere it, super
stition chant its praises, bigotry defend its
errors, and ambition Hid its designs; but truth
will unmask it, education dissect it, and liberty
oppose it so long as time endures.

Postscriptum.-I notice that Priest Yorke has
returned to the fray after one day of silence. I
was of the opinion that he had petered ou on
Peter, and had laid down to rest after pettlnÃ
him safely located at R -me. And if that were
not the reason it must have been that r.e
sought to imitate his Illustrious predecessor.
"Peter the Fisherman," in going fishing, ana
while fishing for suckers caught a whale, ne
alludes to our use of the "scissors" quite : often
as if it were a strange thing. Now, Mr. he i'", r >
I will a tale unfold, and explain why Mr Hut.
--â¢bell and myself used our scissors to such good
advantage. Under the new papal programme
Priest Yorke has appeared upon the stage as
chief actor in the role of an American with a
new American costume. So we. concluded thai
we would cut him out a suit of clothes from
Roman cloth and let the public view him in
his native costume, Furthermore, we made
use of our scissors in cutting out a plaster to
apply to the papal boil on Uncle Sam s neck.
If we can thus draw the pus out it will give the
patient relief. , .B , - t
In his quotation from our speech at Sulsun it
reads "the American liberty" where it should
be "our American liberty." It so happens that 1
read that portion from manuscript, hence
know the language I used. I am pleased to
learn what quotation he had reference to. My
authority lor the article is Bishop Marvin, who
quotes it'in his book, "Errors of the Papacy.
How does Priest Yorke expect me to verify it?
Does he want me to go to New York and con
sult the file of the Catholic World and bring
the paper to The Call office? If so, $100
would not pay expenses. To offer $100 for an
article that appeared in a weekly journal over
thirty-five years ago is a mere bluff game. His
denial of historic facts do not lessen the value
of the same. Our reason for suspecting his
veracity is that the standard theologians of his
church justify lying, perjury, stealing and
murder.
Our reason for challenging Priest Yorke to de
bate the subject was to prove to the people
that Romanism, like the owl, courted the dark
ness and shunned the light. Of course, it
would have been at the sacrifice of my Ameri
can honor to appear on the same platform with
one who was raised in a land where the pigs
and chickens enjoy the luxuries of the parlor
with the "childers"; but I was willing to
forego that for the sake of the A. P. A. cause.
In regard to "pulpitless preachers," I wish to
remark that if I were called to choose between
being a pulpitless preacher or a bachelor
priest I would choose the former, as there
would be some show of obtaining a pulpit, but
none of having a lawful wife. But he shot
wide of the mark in this case, as none of his
opponents chance to be pulpitless. As for no
toriety, Priest Yorke would never have been
known outside of his narrow circle only for the
A. P. A. Yours for Americanism.

The Big Chestnut Romped Away
With the Baldwin Hotel
Stakes.
LIBERTINE WAS SECOND.
Favorites Took Most of the Events on
the Card at Ingleside Yes
terday.
All i ipie attended the races at
[ngleside yesterday, and cheered lustily as
Crescendo, ing chestnut son of
Flambeau, spread eagled his field for the
rich Baldwin stakes, worth $1500 to the
winner. The event, on which all interest
was cantered, was third on the card, and
excitement was at fever heat as the race
was called. In the ring a scene of pande
monium reigned as the different well
known plungers piloted their way from
stand to stand, followed by an eager
crowd, anxious to fee what horse each
was backing.
In the opening betting, notwithstanding
the conditions of the stake, which allowed
ndo in at such a sweet weightâ 99
pounds â the men on the block offered G
to 5 against him, couuled with his speedy
half-brother Bellicoso. This tempting
price failed to draw out the coin, and T to
6 was scon chalked against the pair, of
which odds the smaller bettors took ad
vantage, it soon being apoarent tlie big
coin was going in on some of the others.
Libertine, carrying top weight, and imp.
Santa Belia both opened at fours, a steady
vlay soon cutting the odds against the
latter down to U> to 5. The filly was par
ticularly heavily backed for the place.
Late in the betting the odds against the
mile-record holder were forced down to
3}Â£ to 1. Imp. Star Kuby and Installator
both went back in the betting. The
Spreckels duo. l'ai Murphy and Gallant,
were nibbled at by lovers of long shots,
the stable drifting back to <J0 and 7u to 1 in
the bettimr.

place from Mestor by a neck. The winner
covered the distance" in 2 :11Â»^.
Six started in the mile dash", with Pepper
ruling an 8 to 5 favorite. Eu Kearney,
strongly fancied by his owner, was a pro
nounced second choice. Moderocio and
Ferrier were the next most fancied. Fer
rier was first away when the flas fell, but
wus almost immediately passed by Meadow
Lark, who showed a spasmodic burst of
speed for a quarter. Ferrier soon had the
lead again, turning into the stretch a
length in front of Ed Kearney. The pair
were soon on nearly equal terms and a
furlong from the wire were joined by Pep
per. Then the most exciting drive seen
on a local track in months ensued. With
all three riders resorting to whip and steel
the three passed the wire in the time-hon
ored blanket finish. Ferrier's chestnut
nose was in front and the last few jumps
Pepper poked hia nose ahead of Ed Kear
ney's, taking the place. The mile was
covered in 1 :42.
Fly, the 2 to 5 favorite, made a runaway
race* of the last event over five furlongs,
winning as he pleaded from Midlo. Gold
Bug finished third.
Track and Paddock Itemst
Thomas 11. Williams Jr. was numbered
among the spectators. The president of
the old Jockey Club held a ticket on
Ferrier.
If Earl Cochran, who rode Crescendo,
were to visit a phrenologist none of his
bumps would prove as expensive as the
one he gave Libertine. The judges fined
him $100.
Nineteen bookmakers weighed in yes
terday. The Baldwin Club, Clarke & Co.
and Cooke & Co. were the new comers.
The many friends of the popular jockey,
] George Miller, are greatly pleased to see
him if gaining his old form. His ride on
I Ferrier could not have been surpassed.
Fred Cowan was hurrying: around the
ring picking up G to 5 against imp. Santa
I Bella for the place wherever he could find
; it. The St. Nicholas Club took one bet of
I $500 irom him.
Riley Grannan was another ardent
admirer of Mr. Macdonou^h's filly. The
| "Doy" plunger backed her to win ail
i around the ring.
'Cad" Irish, considered one of the
shrewdest bettors on the turf, stayed by
I Crescendo and won a good sum.
Walter Hobart, the young millionaire
turf man, strayed into the ring as the
i horses were going to the post and viewed
the race with some Libertine tickets in his
pocket.
Shieldbearer was fancied by the public
more than by his owner, Frank Phillips,
who thought the track too dry for hm:
and backed the horse bat lightly.
Libertine is certainly unfortunate in his
stake engagements. In two of the stakes
: run off at the Bay District he fared much
the worse for the starts, and in yesterday's
race was knocked against the rail soon
after the nag fell, losing three or four
length?. Of course to a horse of such great
striding powers this accident would lie a
powerful factor in aiding toward his de
feat. But when the ease with which the
j winner captured the race is considered it
! looks as though even barring this draw
back there could have been no material
change in the result.

HELP FOR THE PRISONERS
The Salvation Army Offers to
Aid and Reform Dis
charged Convicts.
AMENDING THE PENAL LAWS.
Prison Directors Appoint a Committee
to Offer Suggestions to the
Code Commission.
The State Board of Prison Directors met
yesterday at San Quentin prison, De Pue,
Devlin, Xtff ana Fitzgerald being pn- snt
L. Wadhams, expert fur the board, re
ported on the condition of prison iinances
for the quarter ending December 31, 1835,
THE GUT OF THE DIRECTORS TO MR. DEVLIN.
according to which the general cash
account had in bank Â£9455 .;*;, fa vault
$182 16, making a total of $!)Â«.i7 4\t belong
ing to the State. The prisoners' cash
account showed in bank and vault,
$3242 50. The available funds on hand
were: General appropriation fund, $90,
--530 90; State prison fund, $2'),208 05; jute
revolving fund, $19,040 32- cash on hand
|9637 49.
The Code Commissioners asked for in
formation and suggestions as to changes
in prison laws, and Directors De Piie,
Devlin and Fitzgerald were appointed to
act as a committee in conjunction with
Wardens Aull and Hale in preparation of
the required information.
Reports were received from the several
paroled prisoners and read by Warden
Hale. They contained favorable news j
that proved the men out of prison on I
parole were living up to their new rule '
of life.
Senator Sewell appeared on behalf of R.
P. Crailwick and Charles Ossood, who were
sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment
from Lake County in 1891 for murder com
mitted in the "white cap" outrages. He
asked for a commutation of the sentence
in each case to eight years, which, with
credits already accrued, would allow the
prisoners to go free eight months from
now. The reply was that although the
board had previously considered these
cases carefully, and returned the petition
without recommendation, it would review
1GT975 pairs FULL SIZE WHITE BLANKETS (manufactured by the Goiden a X^â¢s&*Â°%Z
Gate Woolen Mills, San Francisco), cost to make $6.12', on sale at $4.90 a pair. SS'S donfront table at greatly
gf (/ Murphy Building, J mif Murphy Building, /
Market and Jones Streets, Met and Jongs Streets.
Senator Sewell's claims if presented In
writing with all the evidence from the
prosecution. He also offered a, petition on
behalf of William l'ettis, sentenced in 1891 to
ten years from Mendocino County for man
slaughter, praying for parole. The request
was taken under advisement.
Tapers which had been laid before the
Governor j.raying for executive clemency
in the case of Rev. E. E. Rowland of Los j
Angeles, who was convicted of perjury, I
were referred to the board. The prison j
register showed that Howland, who styled
himself a "minister of the gospel,"*had
been convicted July 17, 1895, in Los Ange
les for swearing falsely to a complaint ac
cusing a man of disturbing a religious
meeting. He is serving a sentence of two
years at San Quentin. The petition was
returned to the Governor without recom
mendation, as letters from the District At
torney Â«nd sentencing Judge were not
favorable.
Captain McFee of the Salvation Army
submitted a plan which the army bus had
under consideration for assisting dis
chargd prisoners.
"I would like to have the names of pris
oners about to be discharged, 1 ' he said;
"say about thirty days before they are let
out. Then the army could learn every
thing about the man and see what couid
be done for him. We have members of
the army all over the State who could take
care of discharged prisoners recommended
by us from here. Our main plan is to re
move prisoners as far as possible from
their old associations."
Director Devlin remarked that it would
1>' 1 advisable for the captain to confer with
Warden Hale and the chaplain and come
back at the next meeting with a better idea
of what should do done.
"This is a very important matter," paid
the Warden; "I have given it considerable
study, ard we don't want to go into it un
advisedly."
"Exactly, that's what we want to do,"
reniied MuFeeâ "to co-operate with the
Warden and you, gentlemen."
"There is no question," added Chairman
De Pue, "that there should be some one to
look afier prisoners when discharged. We
turn thorn out with $5 and a suit of
clothes, and very frequently have them
back again. They ought to be taken in
hand, sailors put on ships, tradesmen al
their trades and others given employ
ment."
"That is our programme of practical re
form," Oaptain McFee said.
The Warden stated that Governor Budd's
feelings were that the prisoners should be
taken care of after leaving the orisons,
and he had no doubt but that an appro
priation would be made for that purpose
by the next Legislature. This closed the
discussion and the board went into private
session.
FAREWELL TO DEVLIN.
Director Devlin, whose term of office
has expired, was tendered a farewell
banquet last, night by the prison officials
in Warden Male's residence. In the after
noon Mr. Devlin was given a pleasant sur
prise, which Vas not the least affecting
feature of the most agreeable ending of
his oiiicial career.
After the directors returned from lunch
eon he was invited into the clerk's office,
where he found the Commissioners and
some prison officers. On the desk waa a
beautiful case covered with flowered silk,
which Mr. Devlin eyed curiously.
The Warden, without much ceremony,
deputed Director Fitzgerald to deliver a
farewell speech, and Mr. Fitzgerald offered
the best wishes of the board for the success
of the retiring director, who was assured
of the hish esteem and lasting friendship
of his colleagues. At the close of the ad
dress Mr. Fitzgerald opened the silk-
I'uvered case and exposed to view a mag
nificent salad service, half silver and half
gold, and an engrossed card bearing the
inscription:

Director Devlin responded with words of
regret that he should have to leave his as
sociates, and with a deep sense of the kind
ness and friendly feelings that had existed
between him and them.
GERMAN SALVATIONISTS.
A Now Army Branch Has Been Opened
for Natives of the Father
land.
The Salvation Army took a new de
parture in its worK last Thursday night by
opening the first German corps on the
Pacillc Coast.
New York, Brooklyn, Philadelnhia, Cin
cinnati and Chicago have German corps,
which have been found to do such effective
work that a number of natives of the
Fatherland whose lot is cast in this City
and who are interested in army work
have been clamoring for the establishment
oF a German corps here. Accordingly,
suitable quarters were taken, soldiers 'Â»Â»ere
detailed for the work, and last night the
corps was opened with a large attendance
and plenty of enthusiasm.
Rooms at 61t> Merchant street have been
chosen as the headquarters of the new
German work. There is a good-sized hall
in which meetings will beheld every night
in the German tongue. Lieutenant Kuhne,
â¢tvho recently made her farewell from
Woodland, has been j>laced in charge of
the work. Lieutenant Villiger has been
appointed her assistant.
The new branch will devote its energies
to caring for the material as well as the
moral welfare of the German people in
this City. There will be a Bureau of In
formation as well as an employment bu
reau. Information will be given to Ger
man strangers in the City, and if required
respectable lodging-houses will be found
for them. The branch will also be fur
nished with copies of the German War
Cry, published in Now York City.
Weli-informed Hungarians estimate that
fully 750.0 CX) of tbeir people have found
homes injthe United States. According to
United States Treasury statistics there are
242,702. Many of them are in Pennsylva
nia.

diseases by a scientific process unknown to the
medical fraternity. sworn statements of the lame,

THE REALIZATIONS
OF THE DREAMS OF AGES.
THE FUTURE UNVEILED
FOR THOSE WHO CARE TO SEE.
The Prophet has arrived and is now in the city;
that great exponent of the occult art, that le-
nowned and famous mediumâ Professor Van 'Je
Vereâ whose clairvoyant vision penetrates all the
subtle mysteries of Life and Death, from which the
common mind is veiled.
Query: Why Is it that so many personsâ men
and women sifted in many waysâ struggle on from
day to day, urued on by love of hate, or ambition,
yet vt-r succeed, although their exertions are al-
most superhuman and their fortitude is more than
sublime as they drag their weary limbs through
years of tria's, while their poor, tired eyes gaze
yearningly for that Mecca of Happiness they have

fire >.n the Clark estate at the comer of Bush and Battery streets. The new structure,
which, is to be six stories high, will be built of granite in the lower and buff Roman brick

ing strictly to commercial purposes, no offices being let in the upper stories. The design
herewith is by Edward R. Swain. The cost of the structure is estimated at $100,<XX).\

George T. Bowen Argues Against
the Proposed Ordinance of
the Supervisors.
Large Revenues Being Spent in Beauti
fying and Improving Them Would
Be Cut Off.
Those interested in the Odd Fellows',
Laure! Hill and Masonic cemeteries are
very much concerned over the proposed
ordinance before the Board of Supervisors
to stop the further sale of lots. This, they
claim, would cut off their supply of funds,
prevent them from keeping the cemeteries
trim and cause them to become nuisances.
They claim that the ordinance in not pro
venting burials in lots already sold can
really accomplish nothing except making
the burial-grounds eyesores.
George T. Bowen, president of the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery Association, speaking
of the matter last evening said :
"If they stop the sale of any more lots
they cut off our revenue, and instead of
making the cemeteries Deauty spots they
will become nuisances. It has been our
aim for years to make ours a promenade
park. We intended to wall it in and fur
ther improve it. As it is more people visit
our cemetery than any other in the coun-
try.
"There is nothing in the argument that
its presence is a menace to health. It is
well known that the twelfth is the most j
healthy ward in the City. Tnis argument,
and, in fact, the whole light, is being
made, I have no doubt, by the San Mateo
cemeteries. The people in the neighbor- j
hood are not fighting us.
Another thine, much of the improve
rnflnt of the neighborhood is due to the !
presence of the cemrtery. When it was '
desired to put in the sewer and do the j
other work on Point Lobos road we were
the first to sign contracts and get the
other property owners in, and have spent
over $30,000 in that way. Laurel Hill
Cemetery has spent $80,000 in the last few
years in streets and walls.
"There is no objection to well-kept cem- i
eteries in Eastern or in European cities, i
where many of them are objects of pride,
and pleasure grounds for the people. It is
not as if this City was going to be cramped
for want of ground. If this ordinance is
passed, it will mean simply that the cem
eteries will in time become neglected and
become eyesores."

FIRST QUAKER REVIVAL.
The Society of Friends Will Hold
Religious Services at
South Berkeley.
" Speak Easy's" Proprietor Found
Guilty of Violating the One-
Mile Limit Law.
BERKELEY. Cal., Jan. 11.- The first
series of revival meetings ever held in
California by the Quaker Society, moro
commonly known as the Friends' church,
are now in progress at Ashby Hall, South.
Bertceley. The initial service was held
last night under the leadership of Kevival
ist . T IL. Doutrias, superintendent of the
yearly meetings in California. He is
assisted in the work by Rev. Lida Romick,
a distinguished Quaker evangelist from
Ohio. The society in California was or
ganized twelve years ago with a member
ship of only twelve. At the present time
it has over 1200 supporters of the faith in
this State alone.
Their field of activity has recently been
broadened by the establishment of Â« col
lege of their own denomination at "Wbittier,
Los Angeles County, which has developed
to large proportions considering mat it is
a strictly denominational institution. The
church in Berkley lias among its mem
bers some of the leading business men in
town. The services at Ash by Hall will be
continued indefinitely.
Suffragists to Sleet.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 11. âW. H.
O'Brien, the recently elected manager of
the Altrurian, the official organ of the
Altruistic colon}', will speak before the
Citizen's Suffrage Club of Berkeley next
Monday afternoon at Stiles Hall on
"Strong Points in Woman Suffrage and
the Liability of Failure Through Woman's
Non- Acquaintance With Political Meth
ods." This topic is directly in line with
the principle of the unpreparsd condition
of woman for assuming the burden of po
litical responsibility which Mrs. George
Haight, president of the county and local
suffrage organizations, have been agitat
ing, and whicti the Berkeley society will
continue to promulgate until tiie amend
ment election striking out the word
"male" from the State constitution takes
place this fall.

BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 11.â The trial

STUDYING THE HEAVENS.
An Interesting Lecture on Astronomy
by Professor Lenschner.
Professor A. E. Leu?chner of the Uni
versity of California delivered an interest
ing lecture last evening in the Mechanics'
Institute. His subject was "^omeJÃecent
Advances in Astronomy," and as the pro
fessor progressed in his address the
principal features were illustrated by
btereopticon pictures thrown upon canvass.
The attendance was large, the big lecture
room being filled to the doors.
In his preliminary remarks Professor
Leuschner went bauk in history to the
earliest races of niariKind who made a
study of the heavvus, and followed the
science of astronomy through the times
when it was studied by tne Chaldeans,
Egyptians, Grecians, and then to the
C Imstian era. He dealt particularly with
the importance of the big telescopes, as
tronomical photography and the spectro
scope, and the inestirna'ble value these are
to the pursuit of ihis science. The views
| presented by the siereopticon gave the
spectators a better insight into the man
ner in which the astronomers study the
heavens than anything could, except
actual observation and personal experi
ence in a modern observatory.

A LIFE OF MISFORTUNE.
Child in ;Â» Blind Home; Husband in San

an Asylum.
Oak r and Office Sam Fuancisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 11. \
The finding of the will of tne late Ida
Duffy is the last chapter in a life to which
fata seemed to be particularly unkind.
Several years ago Andrew Duffy, her hus
uho is now serving a term in San
Quentin, was a well-known Oakland poli
tician. Among the street-corner set his
word carried weight, and he was a boss
whose friendship was more to be desired
than his enmity.
About ten years ago Duffy met Miss Ida
Lussier, a young lady who had already
contracted an early marriage that had
proved unfortunate, and she had resumed
maiden name. Mi^s Ida's lirst hus
band was a man of means named Meyer?,
but before she was long a wife her husband
died. When Ida met Andy Duffy she still
bad Borne money left, and the pair opened
the Palace cipar-store on Seventh street.
Here Mrs. Duffy attended to the business
and her husband did politics.
After the birth of a blind son Mrs. Duffy
and her husband went to Tracy, and Mrs.
Duffy went insane and was sent to Ag
news. .Some time later ?he was pronounced
cured and went to live at Stockton. All
went well fora while until a man came
- their path and aroused the jealousy
of Jhiffy by his marked attentions to his
wife. On one occasion there was a quarrel
between the two men, and Duffy in a lit of
jealousy killed the man who was pursuing
his wife. For this crime lie was sent to
the penitentiary fora long term. His wife's
insanity returned and she was again sent
to Agnews, where she recently dfed. The
boy is now at the Berkeley Blind Asylum.
Thousands of Oaklanders remember the ex
citable Duffy and the really beautiful
young woman whom he married and who
ran the Seventh-Street ciirur-stand.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 1896.
A QUORUM IS BLOCKED
Alameda County Republicans'
Oid Guard Keep Their Man

REORGANIZERS AEE DEFEATED.
Although Evans Controls the Com

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 11. )
The Republican County Committee did
not meet this afternoon. The reorganizes
were outgeneraled by the old guard, and,
although J. W. Evans was sure of seven
votes out of thirteen, be was not elected
chairman, owing to there being no quorum.
For over a year an effort has been made
to oust Charles Mautalen from the chair
manship, but no success has been met
with. Mr. Maotalen is not anxious to be,
displaced, although he has two-thirds of
the committee against him. This after
noon, in accordance with a promise made
two months apo, Mautalen called a meet
ing of tho committee for this afternoon,
"in accordance with an understanding at
the last meeting."
At 2 o'clock the sidewalk outside of
Justice Allen's courtroom was covered v/itb.

politicians, and although at one time there
were ten members of the committee to be
seen, when the roll was calied it was evi
dent that a job had been put up to defeat
the reorganizers, as only seven answered
to their names. The other thiee had van
ished and could not be found.
The present county committee is com
posed as follows: Alameda, P. J. Fletter;
Brooklyn, J. H. W. liiley; Eden* B. ' .
Ha we s : Murray. Y. E. Bernal ; Oakland,
.7. W. striker; Washington, W. li. Ford;
First Ward, Phil M. Walsh; Second Ward,
J. Mitchell: Third Ward. A. L. McPhfcx
s.m: Fourth "Ward, R. \Y. Church: Fifth
Ward, B. F. Armstrong: Sixth Ward,
Charles Mautaien; Seventh AVard, J. W.
Evans.
When the roll was called Fletter, Hawes,
Mitchell, McPherson, Armstrong, Mauta
len and Evans were present. Messrs.
Walsh, Denial and Striker had been seen
previously, and the other members were
not in town.
Chairman Mautalen announced that
there was no quorum present, as the rules
recently adopted require eight members to
transact busineÂ«s. Several members
claimed that a majority was sufficient, but
the chairman said that a special rule took
precedence over general rules. This was
questioned, and the secretary read from
the book rule 8. It stated cleiirly that not
le?s than eight members should form a
quorum, and so a few minutes were al
lowed to elapse in hope that the eighth man
miaht come in ; but the plans had been too
carefully laid. Church "was sick and In
bed, Riley was busy at the courthouse. Ford
missed the train "from Niles, and Walsh,
bernal and Striker forgot about the meet
ing at the last minute and did not recover
their memories till Chairman Mautalen
had declared the meeting adjourned sine
die.
The county committee is in a position
now that is not at nil uncommon in Ala
meda County politics. Chairman Mim
talen has not sutlicient votes to re-elect
him chairman if a full board were present,
but he hns just enough to prevent a quo
rum from getting together aud ousting
him. J. W. Evans controls enough votes
to elect him, but not enough to form a
quorum. How long the deadlock may
continue not a politician on the street can
be induced to Bay. One vote will change
the whole situation, but even then the
blocking of a quorum will prevent reor
ganization. .

MADDENED BY JEALOUSY.
B. L. Hill, a Brakeman, Shoots
His Wife and Gives
Himself Up.
The Murderer Calmly Teils His Story
Behind the Bars Between the
Puffs of a Cigarette.
Oakla.mi Office San Fbancibco Cat.t.,)
9US Broadway, f
B. L. Hill, a brukeman, shot his wife at
Thirteenth and Kirkham streets, to-night.
Tin 1 murder was instigated by jealousy.
Hill returned from Portland this morn
ing on the State of California, and took up
his quarters at the International Hotel in
Ban Francisco. He came to Oakland and
saw his wife and learned from her that
their two-year-old buy was with a family
in East Oakland. Hill visited the boy and
returned to San Francisco. He came back
to OaKiund to-night, waited on the street
for his wife to come out, walked half a
block with her, and on the corner of Thir
teenth and Kirkham streets, fired three
shots into her head.
After the shooting Hill walked toward
the neighboring carhouse and gave him
self up to two men who came out when
they beard the shots.
"That's what I've done," he said, point
ing to his dead wife.
The murderer was taken to the city prison
and was as calm and deliberate as a man
could be. Within an hour of the murder
ho told the following story to a Call re
porter between the puffs of a cigarette
with as much sang froid as is attributed to
the most hardened murderer. -'â¢';);}-
"This thing has been going on ior some
time," said Hill, "and I have been very
quiet about it. Not long afier we married
trouble began and there has been more or
less vi it during the lour years since we
wore married in Suisun. Ido not wish to
cast :iny reflections on my wife and conse
quently I cannot say much at this time.
1 kept a saloon for four years at Suisun
and they were far from happy.
"Last March I moved to Oakland and
we went to housekeeping on Vi'illow street.
I was employed by the Southern Pacific as
a brakeman, but on account of my wife's
behavior 1 made up my mind that we
could not live together, and last Novem
ber I went to Oregon.
"I threw up my job and went north
solely because my Wife was not behaving
herself. She did not drink, but she kept
too much company. We wrote to each
other and about a week ago I received a
letter tlmt induced me to relurn. She said
that all would he well if 1 came back, and
that she would see that I should have
nothing to repent of if I came back.
"I arrived this morning and called on
her. She had given up housekeeping and
was living with a Mrs. Thomuson, at
Eleventh and Kirkbam streets. I was not
pleased with what I discovered, and after
going out to Eart Oakland to see our two
vear-old boy I returned to San Francisco.
To-night I came over here and went to
Mrs. Thompson's house. I did not call on
my wife, but waited on the sidewalk till
?he came out. Then I walked with her to
the corner, where she was to take an
electric car.
"We had some words and when we got
to the coiner I did it. I think 1 fired
threo times. There was no scuffle and she
made no effort to defend herself. I heard
something wh ich if any man had heard
would have made him do tbe same tiling.
I will not say now who has caused all this,
but there was Bomebody taking my place
and that is all there is to it. \l made no
effort to get away as I might have done,
for there was no one near. I gave myself
up and can put up with the consequences. "
Hill told his story very deliberately and
seemed totally unconscious of the enor
mity of his crime. When he was linished
he asked the jailer for something to read
and was siven a volume of "Mary, Queen
of Scots. 1 ' 1
The murder was carried out so suddenly
and so deliberately that not a minute
elapsed between the firing of the first shot
unil the arrest of the murderer. The pistol
was held close to his wife's head, as the
hammer dragged Â°'- l t some tufts of hair as
it fell, which wereonthe pistol when it was
taken from Hill at the prison. Two of the
sliots are just above the right ear and one
through me left cheek.
The victim was woman about 25 years
old, a pronounced blonde of rather
heavy figure and tall. Ilefore her marriage
to Hill in Suisun she was a Miss Nelson.
So far as known nothing can be related
against her character.
The murderer came hero from Wisconsin
in 1890 to play in the Oakland baseball
team. He ninde a good record in the sea
son of 1890, and after that went to Buisun,
where he conducted a saioon. He is a
big, heavy built man, with a large red
face that appears to be devoid of gentle
ness or refinement.
The Yellowstone Saloon.
James T. Murphy and F. Smalley have filed
an answer in the suit of John H. Wise, Col
lector of the Port, to recover on & note given
for a half interest in the Yellowstone saloon,

In their answer they say that John H. Wise
and Hut rv E. Wise told them the saloon was
worth $'20,000; that it took in SiiOO a day and
the expenses were $35 a day. They say these
figures are all wrong anil that as a matter of

A FRAUD ON THE CHURCH
Archbishop Riordaa Denounces
the San Leandro Found
ling Home.
WILL ADOPT EIGHTEEN BABES
Rev. Father McSweeney Empowered by
the Children's Society to Take
Them From the Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
WS Broadway. Jan. 11. j
In an isolated part of the county, lying
between the town of San Leandro and the
bay, is a little four-room cottage. Very
few people, even in the neighboring town,
know of its existence, yet eighteen hapless
babes have been confided to the care of the
two women who manage the place, under
the delusion that they are Sisters of
Mercy, and that the cottage is a branch of
a Catholic institution.
Tales of cruelty, neglect, and starvation
have occasionally been told by the found
lings and others, but only three days ago
was sufficient evidence produced to war
rant Mrs. Prescott to officially investigate
the place and declare that it was not a
healthy or proper place for the inmates.
The case was reported to Mrs. Prescott
last Friday by the parents of two boys
5 and 7 years of age, who, by the instiga
tion of a Catholic relative, had been tem
porarily boarded in the home. It was
done solely upon the representation that
for the sum of $8 the children would be
boarded and carefully tended in a branch
of the Girls' Directory located on a farm
iu>ar San Leandro, where they would enjoy
the fret'dom of the country under the
motherly care of the Sisters of Mt-rcy. The
larmhouse proved to be a squatty, one
story cottage of four medium-sized rooms,
carpetles.s and bare in appearance.
In a darkened room were the beds that
eighteen babies slept in, anything but
clean and the odor was extremely sick
ening.
The mattresses were bags made of calico
lit led. wii.'i straw and the pillows the same.
A sitting-room, carpetless and cheerless,
was directly ODpoaite the dormitory, bacK
o_i which came the kitchen, wherein the
eighteen babes were seated in little wooden
chairs eating dry broad.
A ferocious bulldog in a kennel at the
back door growled and snarled most dan
gerously at Mrs. Prescott and her com
panions who were refused admission very
emphatically. Only by asserting her
rights us an officer of the law did sheman
age tv get outside the reception-room.
This week it 16 now arranged that the
cluldien will be pat under better and per
manent care for their future welfare.
The Rev. Father McSweeney, pastor of
the Francis de Haies Church, was ieen
this afternoon in regard to the alleged
Catholic institution at West San Leandro,
known as a branch of the Girls' Directory
located hi San Francisco.
lie f-aid: "I did not know that such an
institution existed until recently. When
I heard it I was ac a meeting in Berkeley,
ut which Archbishop lliordan was present,
I and it gave the excellent opportunity of dis
-1 cuseing the mutter, which is one of the
worst of frauds perpetrated on the Catholic
church. The institution has no connection
in any way with the Catholic church, and
the quicker the affair is investigated and
; the wider publicity it geta the better it will
| be, for of all frauds a religious fraud is the
1 most dangerous.
"The first we ever heard of this organi
-1 zatiou was between three and four years
[ ago, when we were informed that a band
I of four or rive women had met somewhere
I in the Western Addition in San Francisco
â¢ without any authorization from any reli-
I gious sect and constituted themselves into
what, if my memory serves me right, as
the "Sisters of St. Francis" or Sisters of
Mercy. They donned the regulation uni
| form of the sisters of the Catholic church,
' but very little has ever been heard of
them. Every priest in the State has de
; nounced the body from his pulpit and
warned his people against them. Conse
quently it is no wonder that a building so
ittr away from everybody should have
: been selected and that the visitors who
! Bought to investigate the charges pre
ferred should have had so much difficulty
in finding the place.
"From the conversation I have had with
j those who went through the instiiution I
am perfectly satisfied that those eighteen
little waifs are in a terribly neglected and
suffering condition. Most of them, if not
J all, have been placed there under the be
i lief of their parents or guardians that they
: were in care of genuine Sisters of Mercy
under the auspices of the Catholic church.
Wnen the matter has be;Mi explained to
I the public in order to inform the friends
I of these little ones of their suffering and
! neglected condition and they fail to come
i forward, if authorized by Mrs. Prescott, i
| secretary of the Alameda County branch
;of the Society for the Prevention cf â 
Cruelty to Children, I will upon two min
utes' notice take tiie entire lot of eighteen
children.
"L will place them in one of our homes,
where they will be properly and kindly
cared for without any money considera
tion, only to see those suffering, diseased
little waifs made comfortable and happy.
"Archbishop Riorrian, who is greatly
wrought up over this affair, has notiiieii
all the priests to give publicity to the San
Leandro affair from their various pulpit 3
to-morrow morning, and I hope this will
be the means of breaking up the fraud
that is. being perpetrated upon the Catho
lic church.
"I am well pleased with the proposition I
made by Father McSweeney," said Mrs.
Prescott, "and in my official position will
empower him â¢to take charge of the
neglected children, whose present condi
tion would warrant me in considering
them wards of our society. When I visited,
the Children's Home at San Leandro there
were many indications that were strangely
out of keeping with any other Protestant
or Catholic institution I ever had visited,
and 1 determined to communicate with
our officers at the Sun Francisco head- I
quarters and request thai the directors of
the Girls' Directory remedy the great
number of wrongs seen during my visit.
"I fully believe that moat of the little
ones in "the institution have been sent
there under the impression that it was a
Catholic home, and Ido not propose to bo j
a party to a deception, and will do all in {
my power to aid. Father McSweeney in
placing the little ones where they will re
ceive the right kind of care and nourish
ment. \, â 
"If necessary an officer of the society can
accompany Father McSweeney whenever !
he wishes to take charge of the "little waifs, I
whose distressed condition is pitiful to be- '
hold." â  â  ;â â â - --â â  - j

DR. BROWN WILL
PREACH TO-DAY.
His Victory Over Mrs.
Davidson Gives Him
Courage.
MUST STAND TRIAL.
Prominent Church Members Will
Demand an Investigation
at Once.
MRS. DAVIDSON GOES TO JAIL.
Still in a Cheerful Frame of Mindâ Mrs.
Tunnell and the Overman
Letters.
According to his statement last night
Dr. Brown will occupy the pulpit of the
First Congregational Church to-day.
His temporary victory over Mrs. David
eon has given him renewed courage, and
on this Sabbath morning he will rise
triumphantly over the prostrate form of
hia accuser. Tl>e doctor feels that his
honor in a great measure has been
retrieved and his character vindicated.
The deacons, who conmose the governing
power of the church, are still with him.
This fact is very encouraging to him. It
inspires him to hold his head up, look his
congregation square in the face and pro
claim his innocence to the world.
In the meanwhile there is a strong un
dertow of feeling against him. This feel
ing has spread very rapidly since the com-
itment of Mrs. Davidson. Talk of an in
vestigation is now heard for the first time.
It is pointed and convincing and shows
ttiat the people are earnest in the matter.
It [a claimed that the interests of the
church demand an investigation, and at
once.
"If the church does not investigate Dr.
Brown, Dr. Brown should demand an in
vestigation," said W. J. Dutton, trustee
of the First Congregational Church, yes
terday.
"The interests of the church and public
opinion demand that an investigation
Bhould be held," declared Dr. Jonathan
T. McDonald.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and other promi
nent members of the First Congregational
Church have already gone on record as
favoring an investigation, even demand
ing the resignation of the pastor.
Anyway, Dr. Brown will preach to-day.
While he is exhorting his hearers to follow
in the footprints of the Savior the gray
haired old lady who so readily accepted
his shekels will be communing in a lonely
cell at the big white building out on the
San Bruno road.
AT THE BRANCH JAIL.
Mrs. Davidson Removed From the
City Prisonâ Talks of Mrs.
Tunnell. â¢
Mrs. Davidson has apartments at the
branch County Jail.
Her departure from the City Prison at
noon yesterday was without display. She
rode out in thÂ« prison van. There were
other prisoners in the somber-covered
vehicle with her. She paid no heed to
them, but, clasping her Bible and her
handbag tightly, she calmly looked into
apace and graciously submitted to the
inevi table.
Mrs. Davidson was indeed herself.
In many respects she is a remarkable
woman. She is much more cheerful in
her lonely prison cell in her failure to
establish her innocence than Dr. Brown is
in his temporary vindication. She smiles
while the pastor frowns; she fattens while
he fails. She is either a martyr to con
ditions or a hypocrite of the first magni
tude; a spotless Christian or a dangerous
swindler. She can act any or all of these
parts with equal proficiency. She is suffi
ciently clever to sing, pray or scheme at
the same time; or, as the poet writes:
**In penance planning sinÂ» anew."
This is Mrs. Davidson, the motherly
appearing old woman, gray, handsome,
eloquent, the woman who either black
mailed Dr. Brown or is the innocent victim
of circumstances, who went to Drison yes
terday with an unyielding faith in the
mercy ana justice of the Lord and a firm
belief in her ultimate acquittal.
Mrs. Davidson, of course, is not con
cerned over the statement of Mrs. Tunnell
telegraphed from Yisalia, and to the effect
that the Overman-Tunnell letters were
forged by her. There is no similarity in
the handwriting of Mrs. Davidson and Mrs.
Tunnell.
"It's absurd for Mrs. Tunnell to cry
'forgery,' " said Attorney Gallagher yes
terday, "and it only weakens her case. Of
course the letters are eenuine. That is
apparent to the dullest brain. How could
Mrs. Davidson forge them? She has been
in jail ever since her arrest, and not having
the slightest idea of being arrested it is
ridiculous to think that she vrrote the let
ters to build up a defense. Anyway, Mrs.
Tunnell virtually admits that Mattie Over
man wrote the letters, as at first glance
she said the handwritine was Matties,
and then when she slept on tne letters all
night and familiarized herself with the
contents she denied their authenticity.
That was her play. She wants to shield
Dr. Brown and Miss Overman."
"My acquaintance with Mrs. Tunnell was
very slight," said Mrs. Davidson yester
day. We met at the Allen meetings. Dr.
Brown Jntroduced us. I also met Miss
Overman at che same time. Mr.Â«. Tunnell
and Mattie were great-friends. Dr. Brown
said Mrs. Tunnell was a very good woman.
"After the few slight conversations I had
with Mrs. Tunnell at the Allen meetings I
did not see her until her return from Ta
coma. This was in May, and Mrs. Tun
nell went to Tacoma in January or Febru
ary, remaining three months. In May I
met her and we walked a little way "to
gether. I asked Mrs. Tunnell to dine with
me, but she did not. She spoke of Mattie,
f-aying she had been a poor, sick girl.
Afterward, I think it was Admission day,
September 9, Mrs. Tunnell spent a day
with Miss Overman at my roonu.
"Theu Mattie lost sight of her and was
uneasy. But the woman called at my
rooms between December 5 and 10. Mat
tie was at school, and Mrs. Tunnell asked
whether Dr. Brown was paying her regu
larly, and whether he allowed the poor
girl to visit him. I replied that he did
pay regularly, as he had paid the $35 to
Mattie twice and to me three times. I
told her, too, that the girl did visit Dr.
Brown's ollice, but that he objected.
"Thia is all I ever saw of Mrs. Tunnell.
Now as to what 1 said to the woman: Dr.
Browu had sent for me one day and urged
me to keep Martha, as he always called
her, away. He said she had come to the
office the night before and stayed tnere,
crying, very late. I know this was true,
for she had been out late, and though she
had sr>id nothing, I observed that the silk
trimming of her dress was stained with
tears and mussed up.
"Dr. Brown said he feared scandal and
wanted the eirl kept away. I ?poke to her
and she admitted going, saying she had
never been so abused in her life. I urged
her to keep away, and she said she was
hypnotized and could not. At this inter
view Dr. Brown told me he must leave San
Francisco, and would either so to Phila
delphia or Brooklyn. 1 told him I knew
Philadelphia people well, and thought
there were people who would send reports
from here.
"Long after this, though. Dr. Brown
spoke again of going to I'hiladelphia, and
said if he could he would get $7000 a year.
He said he could get one of his rich trus
tees to advance him $2500 and he would
give an order on his salary in return. He
asked me if this Mrs. Badden would take
this $2500 as a final payment and not trouble
him further, and I was to see what could
be done in the matter.
"He talked at the interview I spoke of
first of going to Brooklyn, and I warned
him there was a highroad between here
and there. 'Well.' said he, 'I must go
somewhere, and I think I had better go out
in the midnight hour. I could go to my
son, herd cattle there with him, and be
buried from the world.' I told Dr. Brown
I doubted it. and he said one thing was
certain, and that was he must leave San
Francisco, and must leave it soon."
MUST STAND TRIAL.
Charges Against Dr. Brown Will
Be Investigated by the
Church.
The fact that Dr. Brown will defy public
opinion, as well as the pronounced expres
sions of certain prominent members of
his congregation, and re-enter the pulpit
of the First Congregational Church to-
MRS. DAVIDSON ENTERING THE PRISON VAN PREPARATORY TO SETTING
OUT FOR THE COUNTY JAIL.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
day, has aroused the indienaf.ion of his
old-time opponents, and a church in
vestigation will doubtless be the outcome.
Dr. Brown made many enemies because
of his attacks on Professor Herron, and,
later, in ousting Deacon Strauss from the
church.
These enemies have been silent during
the scandal in the past. But now that Dr.
Brown seems determined to act as their
spiritual guide they are preparing to take
some steps looking to an investigation.
There is a large body in the congrega
tion which asserts that Dr. Brown volun-
tarily made the blackmailing a worldly
matter when he took it to the courts. If
he had laid Mrs. Davidson's attempt at ex
tortion before the officers of his church,
and had demanded advice and counsel
from them instead of paying the money,
the public would have had no concern in
the matter.
But these church members say that it
was Dr. Brown who challenged this fierce
light of publicity, and since it has come
they do not shirk a thorough investiga
tion.
Outside the officers of the church there
is a strong body of church members hold
ing these views. They say they feel tnat
every one in the congregation isaffected by
the slurs cast on the pastor, and that the
only remedy is to wipe away the insinua
tions, or else, if the slurs are proved to be
true, to compel a change in the pastorate.
With these objects in view quiet but de
termined steps are being taken to hold an
investigation. The members of the flock
who ask for a thorough sifting of the
charges against Dr. Brown are making
arrangements to hold a preliminary meet
ing to discuss the best course to be taken.
It is not intended to hold any judicial
court of inquiry or to summon the pastor
to a tribunal. The church members who
want an investigation will consider, in as
Christian and friendly a spirit as possible
to the pastor, how they can be3t get at
the truth of the Overman and Stockton
stories.
The mere fact of this investigation being
planned implies a feeiing which is not one
of entire conlidence in Dr. Brown.
A proof of this feeling was given last
Wednesday at the prayer-meeting held at
the church. It had not been expected that
the pastor would be present, and when it
was discovered that he was, a number of
ladies and one or two gentlemen withdrew
from the meeting.
W. J. Dutton, a trustee of the First Con
gregational Church, said:
"I certainly believe that there should be
an investigation of these charges of mis
conduct against Dr. Brown. If theinvesti
eation is not made Dy the congregation I
think Dr. Brown ov.es it to himself, his
family and tne church to demand it.
"These charges against the pastor are of
a very serious nature. He says he will
come forward at the proper time and ex
plain his position to the satisfaction of all
concerned. I earnestly hope he can.
Until the doctor has been heard I will not
pass upon his guilt or innocence.
"Dr. Brown occupies a high place as
pastor of the First Congregational Church,
and I should be loath to believe him
guilty of all these "harses until his guilt
has been established beyond all doubt be
fore the proper tribunal of the church."
"And in case his guilt is established,
Mr. Dutton?"
"Then the First Congregational Church
will dispense with Dr. Brown's services as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 1896.
pastor without the slightest hesitation,"
replied Mr. Dutton.
Dr. Jonathan T. McDonald said:
"The officers and members of the First
Congregational Church are somewhat reti
cent about expressing their views. There
are several reasons for their silence.
Probably it is because we feel mortified
over this whole affair and have not for
gotten that only a few months ago there
was a wide breach among the congrega
tion owing to M. Strauss, the artist,
having written a letter criticizing Deacon
I. H. Morse. His only offense was that he
remarked that Morse was aspiring to be
'boss' of the church. For this Strauss was
excommunicated from the church. He
was restored, however, a week later.
"I do not speak authoritatively as I am
not an officer of the church, but it is my
opinion that there will be an investigation
into the charges of alleged unbecoming
conduct against the pastor. I do not see
how it can be avoided, since public opinion
seems to demand it.
"For my part I consider the interests of
the church paramount to the interests of
any individual. We must protect these
interests.
"We cannot afford to pass this unfortu
nate affair over in silence. The people are
looking to the church olÃcials to act, and
I presume they will do so at the proper
time."
Rev. John Kimball excused himself
when the reporter called at his home at
132 McAllister street last night. Mr. Kim
ball's views on the question of an investi
gation will be read with much interest by
the tmblic. Therefore the following from
the Examiner of January 8 is reprinted:
The Rev. John Kimball is a prominent mem
ber of the First Congregational Church, and is
also editor of the Congregational organ, The
Pacific. In speaking of the Mattie Overman
letters he said : "1 have read these letters, and
I must Eay that they put a bad light on the
conduct of Dr. Brown. Whether or not an in
vestigation will result I don't know, but if
there is one I believe that it might be best to
place it in the hands of the Bay Conference of
Congregational Churches, which meets next
Monday.
"This conference is composed of clergymen
of our denomination, and it would be proper
for them to investigate any charges involving
the standing of a brother clergyman. Dr
Brown should certainly be glad to have an
opportunity to answer the charges which are
being made against him.
"So far as Mrs. Davidson is concerned, regard
less of Dr. llrown, I believe that she is a person
in whom I cau have little confidence. When
she first came to the church I thought well of
her, and she came to my Bible-class a number
of times until she took a class of her own.
During that lime 1 was favorably impressed
find never saw anything out of the way in her
conduct."
Deacons Pexter, Hatch, Vasconcellosand
Bernard are still championing the cause of
Dr. Brown. Deacon Dexter is a cousin of
Mrs. Brown.
SHE IS A HYPOCRITE.
What Mrs. Thurston Say* of Mrs.
Tunnell and Her Startling 1
Statements.
Mrs. Thurston expressed great surprise
yesterday at Mr*. Tunnell's letter, pub
lished in The Call. "It looks to me like
the work of a hypocrite," she said. "In
this letter Mrs. Tunnel! pretends complete
ignorance of the Overman-Brown episode.
I do not see how she can do that without
great hypocrisy, for she talked the affair
over with me and then she knew all
about it.
"The more I think over Mrs. TnnnelPs
sudden and mysterious ignorance on a
subject that she was once so well posted
upon, the more I become convinced that it
has been made worth her while to know
nothing of Dr. Brown's relations with Mat
tie Overman.
"Any one who has talked the thing over
with Mrs. Tunnell as I have would have
no difficulty in reading the hypocrisy be
tween the lines of that letter. She
spoke the truth in her first interview with
a Call reporter when she was taken una
wares. After she had had a night to
think it over and reflected which way her
interest lay, Mrs. Tunnell decided that
the letters were forgeries. It took a long
time for her to makn up her mind, and
her letter bears the impress of hypocrisy."
J. Knudson, whom Mrs. Tunnell stig
matized in her letter as "another wolf in
sheep's clothing," had a very simple rea
son to offer yesterday for that lady's
animosity.
"I refused to ketD Mrs. Tunnell at the
restaurant, 1917 Mission street," he said.
"She interfered with my work, and I had
to get rid of her. I suppose spite for her
dismissal induced her to hint that she
could have put me behind the bars with
Mrs. Davidson. The threat is made out of
whole cloth."
Mrs. Dray, the landlady at 1041 Mission
street, now claims that Mrs. Tunnell never
brought any clothes to her house. Taken
in conjunction with her former anxiety at
Mrs. Tunnell not sending for a change of
clothes after her disappearance, this sud
den change of mind is held to be signifi
cant. It will be remembered that in a
statement published last Thursday week
Mrs. Dray expressedalarm that Mrs. Tun
nell had not sent for a change of gar
ments.
In her first interview with a Call re
porter, when Mrs. Tiinnell was informed
of the publication of Mattie Overman's
letters, she exclaimed "my trunk
must have been broken open." Mrs.
Dray now asserts, however, that not only
no trunk, but no clothes were left at her
house.
WINCHESTERS
AND BULLETS
Shooting Down the Tele
graph Wires to the
Poolrooms.
GAMBLERS ARE ROUTED.
They Strung Miles of Telegraph
Line During Friday-
Night.
SHADOWED BY DETECTIVES.
They Propose Having a Captive Bal
loon to Get News From the
Ingleside Track.
The threatening bark of the Winchester
rifle entered materially yesterday into the
controversy which has been going along
for the past few weeks between the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club Association and the
downtown poolroom keepers,
Nobody was killed, but this fortunate
result was dependent only on the fact that
the gamblers were unprepared for the at
tack made on their stronghold whence
they wired the news of the Ingleside track
races into the City.
When the Jockey Club's meeting began
last Thursday, and the gamblers were not
permitted to use either the telephone or
telegraph wires at the tract so as to get
their odds, entries, jockeys, weights and
results, they devised many means to cir
cumvent the prohibition. Principally they
employed boys on bicycles to race from
the track to the nearest telephone stations
with the desired information, which was
immediately sent over the wires to the
downtown rooms. The service was imper
fect, but still it was the best that could be
done until other means could be provided.
The wise men of the "Big Eight," which
organization of pool-sellers has plenty of
money in its coffers, were dissatisfied be
cause the tardiness in receiving news pre
vented their customers from wagering
their money more than once in a day,
from the fact that the bettor's money
being once placed remained inactive until
the result of the race was learned. This
result coming in after all tlie races were
about over was, therefore, too late for
further speculation. It was then that the
poolmen rose to the magnitude of the
emergency.
The nearest telegraph station to the
track is at Twenty-ninth and Mission
streets â a mile and a half from the race
courseâand it was deciued that the best
move to be made would be to bring that
station closer to the scene of action, or else
establish a connecting line which could be
reached more rapidly. Money and men
were plenty, and, without trie "formality of
obtaining a franchise or even informing
the proner authorities as to their intent or
right to act, the poolmen purchased the
necessary telegraph poles and wire and set
out a score of men on Friday night plant
ing poles and stretching wire over the
property of people unknown to them, so
that when the races began at 2 o'clock yes
terday afternoon they had a service of
their own.
The western terminal of the impromptu
line was on the hillside just east of Ingle
side track, not more than a few hundred
yards from the main entrance. There an
ex-employe of the Western Union Com
pany, whose name is Emlev worked a
portable "ticker," and at the other end of
the line another ex-employe of the com
pany, named Patterson, received Ernley's
messages.
The poolmen had arranged another con
nection between the racetrack proper and
Emley by paying the admission to the
track of a dozen lads whose duty it was to
hurry from the course with the odds on
the races as posted at the track books and
with the results of the races, a couple of
kids working this way for each race.
After leaving the track with the much
needed information, it took but a few min
utes to reach Emley, who kept bis partner
informed, and in that way the poolrooms
were kept as well informed of all occur
rences as if they were using the Jockey
Club's leased wire.
The members of the "Big Eight" combi
nation were all smiles when they opened
their rooms for business in the afternoon.
They felt sure that they had outwitted
Edward Corrigan and that there was noth
ing more to interfere with their business
until the courts could decide on the ap
peals taken from the lower courts, where
they bad been found guilty of violating
the Ellert ordinance against making books
outside of a racetrack.
The odds and result of the first race
came in splendidly. There was not a hitch
and the presumption was that the remain
ing races would be equally well reported.
In the meantime, however, while the
poolmen were making all their arrange
ments for posts, wires and operators, Cap
tain Jules Callundan of Harry Morse's
I'atrol had four men out looking up their
doings. In this way the Jockey Club was
kept informed of what was going on and,
although Mr. Corrigan said last night he
did not know what more was intended by
the detectives until it was all over with",
the transmission of news was brought to a
sudden stop.
The four Morse men, among whom was
ex-Police Officer Allen, dropped in on
Emley in his improvised office and de
manded the surrender of his machine. To
this demand he demurred and imraedi
ateJy wired in to Jerry Driscoll, relating
what had occurred. "The answer came
quickly:
"Give up nothing. You are working on
a private wire, and if they interfere with
your business they will lay themselves
amenable to the law. Inform them of
this fact."
This had the effect of stopping proceed
ings for a little while, and the four detect
ives marched down the road a bit to have
some quiet little Winchester rifle practice.
There is no ranpe in that section of thn
and birds are scarce, so they used
a^elegraph pole as a target.
Although all of the men are known to
be good shots, they appear to have been
suffering just then "from nervousness, for
they were remarkably inaccurate in hit
ting the pole. Instead, however, they
shattered the glass insulators on the poles
and their biillets cut a wire or two, com
pletely isolating Mr. Emery on the foot
hills from his partner, Patterson, at
Twenty-ninth and Mission streets. That
is why the poolrooms failed to get returns
after the first race.
The bookies are wild now at what they
deem to be a most horrible outrage and a
trespass upon the rights of property-own
ers. They threaten all manner of ven
geance.
It seems that in their wild shooting the
detectives unintentionally cut a wire of
the Postal Telegraph Company, and this
fact may bring about complications.
Between this hour and the time the
races begin Monday afternoon the pool
men propose to have some other system of
getting the news from the track. One of
the methods suggested by Blodes, the
"King of the Newsboys, 1 ' who was ar
rested recently for running a poolroom
where women only could play, is that the
captive balloon and balloonist who some
months ago were at Central Park be em
ployed, and an ascension lasting all the
afternoon be made daily just outside of
the racecourse.
"I will put an operator in the basket,"
Blodes explained, "and with a wire run
ning from there and a powerful field
gJass, I con't see who can prevent us from
getting all the news we want."
The little fat fellow laughed heartily at
the cleverness of his idea to circumvent
the machinations of Mr. Corrigan to stop
his business.
"But I'll not go up in it," he added,
after some deliberation. "I'm too heavy."
When Blodes' idea was mentioned to
Mr. Corrigan he smiled.
"What's to prevent some one from send
ing a bullet through the balloon?" he
asked.
At all events this fight against the pool
rooms has had one good result. Only the
larger rooms are running now. The small
fry who ran places where women and boys
were permitted to gamble have all closed
the;r doors. The "Belfry" at the gore of
Market and Ellis streets, where no less
than seven of these dens held forth at the
beginning of this week, is now deserted
and in gloom.
The case of Gilbert Blodes, proprietor of
the poolrooms on Ellis street patronized
by ladies, came up for hearing in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday. He was
defended by Attorney Lennon.
After the arresting officers had given
their evidence Attorney Lennon raised a
number of objections to the testimony.
Although the sign at the entrance of the
poolrooms bore the name Blodes & Co., he
argued that it had not been proved that
Blodes was a partner. Another objection
was that it had not been proved that races
were running at the time of the alleged
violation of the ordinance. The case was
continued till to-morrow, when argument
on the objections will be heard.
G. W. Statler of the Northern Pacific
Railroad swore out a warrant on Friday
for the arrest of Albert Reinert, stenog
rapher in the office of the general freight
agent, on the charge of grand larceny. He
is alleged to have stolen a typewriter
valued at $100, which he pawned for $!).
He left the office last Thursday and has
not been seen since.
Reinert's downfall is attributed to the
poolrooms. Eve ry month he spent his
wages in patronizing these places and bor
rowed money from his friends to such an
extent that he saw no means of repay
ing it.
Reinert was formerly employed in the
office of the Rio Grande Western Railroad
and was engaged in the office of the
Northern Pacific only for the past two
months.

some Japanese gown of black and gold,
and looked as much in keeping with her
sumptuous apartments at the Baldwin as
she does in the classic settings of her
favorite dramas.
"I'm nearsighted, you know, so about
the first thing I would do if I heard a lire
alarm would be to put on my glasses. 1
would not go out into the elements unclad.
I would avoid the Scylla of pneumonia as
well as the Charybdis of fire. Well, after
the clothing process I would throw my
sealskin over one arm, my best gown over
the other, take my jewel-box in my
hand and start for the stairs. Yes, the
stairs. Do you know I am very nervous
about elevators? Flames shoot up the
shaft in a twinkling. I will choose the
stairs always. Oh, yes, I forgot to say
that I would saturate a towel and place it
over my mouth and nose before taking my
leave.
"Time thus spent is spent wisely, no
matter how near the flames.
"1 have been the loser to a considerable
extent through fire; $30,000 worth of my
'Twelfth Night' and 'Amy Robsart'
properties were destroyed at the Davidson
Theater, Milwaukee, where I had left
them, uninsured, unfortunately, for the
summer. Perhaps that experience has
made me more than usually mindful of
precautions against lire in theaters.
"I am careful to note the stage exits
in all theaters. Smoking is prohibited,
and I urge extreme caution as regards the
handling of diaphanous materials near
gas. These precautions are with regard
to property, however, for I am convinced
that there is little or no danger to life from
fire in modern theaters. Statistics show
that there have been more deaths from
panic than fire in such cases. The annals
of all great fires show this."
"I wouldn't get frightened till after
ward," said George T. Bohen, president of
the Board of Fire Commissioners. Mr.
Bohen is an old-time fire-lighter and a
bonanza of reminiscences, pathetic and
humorous, to the fire laddies, who never
tire of his stories of service in his native
city of Baltimore and in ihe days of the
volunteer firemen of San Francisco.
"No, indeed; I wouldn't permit myself
to get frightened," Mr. Bohen repeated.
"You haven't the time nor strength for it
when your house is on lire. I would close
the doors and windows if I were trying to
extinguish a fire, for in this case, too,
draughts are deadly. If I failed to put
out the fire I would see that my family es
caped by the best means of exit, if there
were an3 r choice. A person could jump
from a window in the second story of my
house without any damage to life or limb,
but if 1 lived in one of the flats downtown
I would be ready to 'throw out tiie life
line' at a moment's notice. The 'life-line'
is simply a rope knotted at a distance of
every two feet. A man could lower his
wife and children to the ground by this
means in a short time and soon follow
them himself.
"Keep cool! Keep cool, even if the
blaze is singeing your hair, and by all
moans keep close to the floor, where there
is fresh air if anywhere. That is my pre
cept and would be my practice."
"Send for the Fire Department in case
fire breaks out," said Dr. W. F. McNutt.
"I would do that with the greatest dis
patch, I assure you. But I'll tell you what
I wouldn't do. I wouldn't go back into a
burning house to rescue a joint of pipe, as
a woman did in Chicago at the time of the
big fire. Neither would I carry a child
out by the leg, as one of our San Fran
cisco women did. And I would certainly
not walk through lire and smoke when it
is not necessary. The great point ia to
keep your head, to use a popular expres
sion. Too many people lose their heads at
a cry of lire. That is really more danger
ous than the fear-inspiring flames them
selves.
"Well, suppose the Fire Department has
been summoned, or that one is enveloped
by lire, as it were, and the one considera
tion is to escape. I would not make a
dash tbroueh the smoke if I could avoid
it, but if the window did not furnish an
avenue of escape I would take care to pro
tect my lungs before making the dash for
liberty. No one should attempt to go
through a room lilled with smoke without
such precaution. C!oth should be placed
across the face â if the cloth be wet all the
betterâ to prevent the smoke entering the
lungs. A few inhalations would prove
fatal. The air in a burning building is
not oxygenated and breathing it never so
little will produce congestion.
"I am greatly interested in a life-saving
appliance that was tested and proved most
sat isfactory at the Palace Hotel a few years
ago. 1 don't remember the name of the
inventor nor the appliance itself, but it is
the best invention of the kind I ever saw.
There was a small metal box, within
which was coiled a strong wire cord. One
end of the cord could be attached to the
bedpost and the box fastened to the waist
by a belt. The cord uncoiled gradually, so
that there would be no jar and positively
no danger.
"A man so equipped could throw him
self from a ten-story window with im
punity and save others in the bargain, for
the box could be sent back by the manipu
lation of a convenient button. The weight
of the instrument is not more than three
or four pounds, and it is so compact that
it would take but a small space in a trunk
or valise. Then a rope knotted at inter
vals of a foot is a useful article in case of a
fire. There are many people who would
not travel without one. Of course, our
modern buildings are furnished with fire
escapes, but intense heat melts the metal,
and ail these things are, as the housewife
says, 'handy.' "
Key. Dr. W. D. "Williams leaned back irt
I his chair meditatively and looked mus
ingly at his study-table with its manu
! scripts galore.
"I tell my children to count ten before
i they do anything after hearing a fire
alarm," lie said, "and I am of the opinion
that that advice would apply to 'children
!of a larger growth.' It doesn't take long
I to count ten, but it has rather a soothing
! effect, you know. My instructions are,
further, to be sure they have a clear idea
where they are, to recall distinctly the
! passageways and be sure to avoid the
â  wardrobe and closets. I knew a child
! who lost her life during a fire by becoming
| confused and mistaking the closet for the
I hall. She groped about in the smoke
i filled closet until she was suffocated.
"Ministers have a preat responsibility in
the matter of proper precautions against
a panic in case of tire. I have always felt
strongly upon this point, and had my line
of action so well defined that when the cry
of 'Fire!' was heard near my church in
an Eastern town, I was able to dismiss my
audience in au orderly manner. I mdi
cated the aisle down which a certain con
tingent of the audience should pass, and by
giving the directions calmly somewhat al
layed the fears of the congregation. The
church, a large one, was cleared by that
means within four minutes.
"I have a half-dozen minute-men in
Plymouth Church who understand that
iheir duty is to take certain posts at the
different exits, some of which exits are
seldom used for any other purpose, and
direct the crowd, or such portion of it as
is known to be under tbeir care, to the par
ticular exit most convenient. These men
are to take their posts on a fire alarm with
out a sign from me. On special occasions,
like the lectures of Dr. Gunsaulus and Miss
Shaw, I increased this force. The fact is
not known to the audience. There is no
necessity of bringing up appalling mental
pictures of a holocaust, especially when I
am so sure that our measures will prevent
its attendant terrors."
"I would try to rescue them even at the
risk of singeing my wings."
J. J. O'Brien explained this reference to
seraphic appurtenances by the statement
that the head of a family was supposed to
be its guardian angel. '-I would try first
to save my children, and that accom-
plished, my wife, if she were not able to
do so herself," said the merchant. "How?
Well, I might lie the sheets together and
lower them to the ground. One can't
make an arbitrary rule of action, because
the variation of circumstances corresponds
to the number of fires. I would try to
grasp the situation and act according to
the emergency."
Mr. O'Brien once assisted in the work of
rescuing women and children from a con
flagration in Dublin, and his recollection
of the peril of that time makes him an
earnest advocate of better provisions
against tires in dwellings.
"Probably the same ridiculous things
that other panic-stricken people are guilty
of, that is, if we may consider the tragic
ridiculous," said Judge Seymour D. Thomp
son. "I might, for instance, lrantically
toss one of my grandchildren out of the
window and deliberately lower a feather
bed and pillows to the ground by means of
a rope. You needn't look incredulous.
That has happened more than once in the
histories of panics and the biographies of
the panic-stricken.
"I might also return to a burning
building, after having made my escape,
in order to save a favorite lawbook and
perish with my treasure.
"You may be sore of one thing. That
is, if there were a lire in the neighborhood
V man equipped with this life-saving appliance could throw himself from a ten
story window with impunity," said Dr. -McNutt.
I would stay at a reasonable distance
from it."
General John JtfcComb believes in the
merits of mother earth as an extinguisher
of flames. "A shovelful of earth is a
weighty argument in a contest with
fire," said he. "I have found it useful in
more than one instance of the kind."
The general says he discovered a new
use for the coat one day when he was
straggling with a pile of burning papers in
an inconvenient recess of his desk. "I
had been trying to beat out the fire with
a towel," he said, "but without effect,
when a cool-headed friend of mine en
tered. He grasped the situation in an in
stant, and whisking off his coat threw it
over the desk. When he drew the coat
away a moment later I wag confronted Dy
charred papers, but neither sparks nor
flames."
"My first thought would be of the chil
dren," said Mrs. Mary A. Swift, president
of the Century Club. "The next would be
to reach the fire-escape. It is an indis
pensable part of a dwelling in my opinion.
I would not live in a house without one.
I consider it most inconsistent to take pre
cautions against the ravages of fire in
business houses and neglect the home. If
a fire had gained but little headway on my
premises I would see that the hose and
buckets of water I always keep in the third
story of my home were utilized. The
presence of those extinguishers affords me
a good deal of satisfaction and a sense of
immunity. I have a dread of fire, in
creased, perhap3, by our residence in
Japan, where all materials used in the
construction of houses are highly inflam
mable. Our plan, while there, of keeping
our supply of kerosene for lamps out of
doors was, I believe, a preventive of fire.
My husband's fancy for having an outside
switch for electric lights so that he could
turn all electricity out of the house, as it
were, at will, was, I think, another excel
lent preventive."
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper has a well-ordered
plan of campaign in case of tire.
"My daughter and I are quite ready for
an emergency," she said. "We keep a
rope in one of our bedrooms, knotted and
ready for emergencies. We are careful to

Judge Thompson.

when it shows signs of age. Then
we have our means of exit carefully
in mind. If a fire snould break out in the

other, take my jewel-box in my hand and start for the stairs," said Mis^

hands on the rose bushes. Better be
scratched than burned."
Mrs. Cooper believes a family should be
trained as to the methods of escape in
case of fire as systematically as the chil
dren in the public schools. "These plans
should be made with special reference to
the house, no matter how often the family
moves."
FUTUEE WAR SURGERY.
What May Be Kxpertetl From the UsÂ©
of the ~Sevr Projectiles.
It wonld appear probable that in a
future war many of the wounds prodmced
by the new projectiles will be surgically
less severe and prove amenable to effective
surgical treatment. Probably, also, the
number of severe injuries will be very
great, when we consider the enormous
range of the new weapon and the pene
trating power of the projectile, which en
ables it to traverse the bodies of two or
three individuals in line, including bones,
and to inflict serious or fatal wounds at a
distance of 3000 or 4000 yanK
It is impossible to say what the propor
tion between these two is likely to be. At
near ranges the explosive effects will be
much the same as before; but at long range
the narrow bullet track, the small external
wounds, which often approach the subcu
taneous in character, and the moderate de
gree of comminution and fissuring of the
bone will be surgically advantageous.
These will form the bulk of the gunshot
injuries of the future, for it would seem
impossible with magazine quick-firing
rifles to contest a contest at close quarte rs
without speedy mutual annihilation.
We may take it for granted that the
number of wounded in proportion to the
numbers engaged and actually under lire
will be greater than before. The supply of
ammunition will be larger, the facility for
its discharge greater, and smokeless pow
der will increase accuracy of aim.
I think we are justiiied in believing, al
though there is high authority for a con
; trary opinion, that the next great war will
i be more destructive to human life â "Uood
j ier," in factâ than any of its predecessors;
! and that the number of injuries, and in
j many cases the severity of the injury, will
', be largely increased. 13ut very many cases
| will remain less severe in character, more
capable of successful treatment and less
likely to entail future disablement, while
i improved sanitation and antiseptic meth
: ods will enormously increase the propor
tion of recoveries.â Sir William Mac Co

BREWERS WANT PEACE.
They Have All Decided Not to
Indulge in a Cut-Rate
Beer War.
NEW PRICES ARE ESTABLISHED.
Hereafter the Drivers Will Not Be
Permitted to Spend Money in
the Saloons.
The local brewers have re-formed their
combination, as The Call last Friday pre
dicted they would, and once more peace j
and harmony prevail in the ranks of the j
Brewers' Protective Association.
The trouble was started several weeks j
ago by charges being made that the Califor
nia and Broadway breweries were catling
the price of steam beer in violation of the
association rules. This was shortly after
the Brewery Workmen's Union had raised
the boycott from two of the breweries of j
â¢.the association. As might be expected
this raised a storm, because similar charges
had been made before, but while there was
a fight on with the union there v.as no
chance for correcting internal troubles.
When the bail was started the brewers
were up in arms and ready for a fight at
once, in order to discipline the offenders.
One of the number openly declared for
cutting the price of beer to Â£'J per barrel.
However the conservative element pre
vailed, and a committee was appointed to
investigate the char
A wees ago the committee reported that
the accused were guilty, and recommend
ed that the price of beer be cut by the
members of the association so as to crush
out the offenders. This raised a row that '
for a time threatened to break up the as
sociation, and when the meeting closed no
action ha been taken upon the recom
mendation. During the week many of the
members were declaring themselves as
bein? favorable to fighting, but all of a
sudden word was received that a new
enemy had appeared.
The beer-wagon drivers and helpers
were organizing for the purpose of com
pelling the brewers to pay better wages,
the same as was paid before the fight
began â¢between the brewers and the union
â workmen.
Another cause for alarm was the
secret meetings being held by the brewery
foremen, the objects of which could not be
learned. Realizing that a cut-rate beer
â war would be disastrous enough of itself,
the brewers aid not have the courage to
face a possible labor union light at the
same time.
When they met again on Friday it was
not a council of war, but a Jove feast, and
figuratively speaking, they threw bouquets
instead of brickbats. After a long confer
ence the members of the association de
cided Â»o bury the hatchet so far as the
offending brewers were concerned and to
arrange a new standard for the price of
6team beer.
The new arrangement is best understood
by the following "Notice to the Trade,
which was signed by the proprietors of
twenty-two breweries and the San Fran
cisco Breweries (limited):
Beginning with Monday, January 13,1896,
the price of steam beer to all dealers will be as
follows: .*5 for each wuole barrel, -j 50 for
tact; half-barrel. $1 75 for each third-barrel,
$1 for each sixth-barrel, luster beer not less
that $8 per barrel, net, without any re
bate or allowance of any nature or kind, and
without spending-money by proprietors, man
agers, employes or drivers.
These prices have been tised in the interests
of th<* dealer as well as in the interests of the
brewer. Low prices for beer only increase the ;
number of dealers and give to those opposed to
the liquor traffic a good argument in favor of I

dark days of the Rebellionâ the monitor
Comanehe, after a rest of thirty years and
more, has once again been put in trim, and
almost anj" da}' we may expect to see the
formidable little craft come sailing down
the bay from the island.
The Comanehe? Old residents of San
Francisco remember her well. Her his
tory is somehow woven in with the his
tory of the City and the coast. Ask some
old pilot about the Comanehe and the
smiling response would likely be, "Why,
lad. the Comanehe was the first and only
ironclad in history to be sunk by a
wooden vessel." And it's all very true,
only that a little explanation is necessary.
The Comanehe? Why, she was the fore
runner of iron ve^el building in the West
â the first ironclad ever seen in Pacific
waters. The material which figured in her
make-up was brought around the Horn as
the cargo of the ship Aquilla. She arrived
in pieces and the pieces were put together
down at the foot of Third street by the
firm of Donahue, Secor <fc Ryan.
But then between the shipping of the
materials and the completion of the craft
came a series of events that are brimful of
interest, especially now that the monitor
is about to exhibit her turret again on the
water? in which every part of her was so
Icaj: a<ro baptized by immersion.
San Francisco looked eagerly forward to
the arrival of the Aquilla, and when on
the 10th of November, 1803, the big wooden
snip sailed into port no little enthusiasm
was manifested. "The heart of every loyal
man in the City was made glad," declares
n newspaper of the day â and no wonder.
The war was raging at the time ana t here
was feverish excitement on the slope,
although far removed from the scene of
conflict. San Francisco Bay wus in need
of a defender of just this formidable type
to put its security" beyond the question of
doubt, and the fulfilment of the City's de
sire was near at Jiand.
The Aquilla was 163 day? on her journey.
She had" been convoyed from New York
to a point some degrees below the equator
by the United States steamship Ina. Sbc
had breasted a violent gale a month before
reaching her destination.
As she glided in through the Golden
Gate and anchored in the peaceful bay it
may be supposed that her captain deemed
Bnnday closing, high license and separation of
grocery from saloon.
In their own interest we ask all dealers to as
sist the Brewers' Protective Association in
keeping tho prices as above, and ask that the y
report to the said association any reduction in
these prices, or any concession or allowance
made to them.
It these prices are strictly adhered to it Will
leSSen competition and prevent discrimination.
This is a radical departure from the
customs of the past and it may cause
trouble among:." tho boer-wagon drivers.
Heretofore these employes have been
permitted to sell beer for $5 50 a barrel
and spend 50 cents with the saloon
i keeper, and 25 cents on hall-barrels. In
! this way they were able to hold old
patrons and frequently obtain new cus
tomers. Hereafter they will be obliged to
pay for the Deer they drink out of their
own pockets. ;
A well-known brewer yesterday, in
speaking upon the settlement of the
troubles, said:
Although the brewers may not at present
realize the fact, still it is a fact that this news
i paper notoriety has done more toward
; straightening out these troubles than any
other factor. It showed what would result
from a beer war. Drunkenness would be
come so prevalent that the Authorities would
â¢ take up the matter, find the temperance
1 people would have an excuse to start a crusade
i against beer - sellers and beer - producers.
While some of tho members of the association
have been displeased that their business
; should be made public, still they all now
i acknowledge that had it not beeu for those
articles there would have been a light which
would have proved equally disastrous to
dealers and consumers and the public in
general. __li;
FALSE TO PLEDGES.
John M.- Reynold* Thus Styles the
Committee of Fifty, and Loaves
Its Hun Km.
The "iniquitous funding bil!, !> to quote
Mayor Sutro, is now causing dissension in
the ranks of the Committee- of Fifty ap
pointeil to impede the passage of the bill
and to introduce another bill in its stead
providing for the foreclosure of tne Gov
ernment mortgage on the Pacific roads.
The cojnruinee's action has so displeased
its secretary, John M. Reynolds, that he
has sent in his resignation. Mr. Reynolds
gives the reason for his action in the fol
lowing open letter:
To the Public of San Francisco â Fellow Cm
! zen's : The Committee of Fifty fears in urge
; upon Congress the passage of <i bill for tne
: Government ownership of the Pacific railroads.
; While favoring Government ownership as tin
only true remedy for railroad extortion and
corruption, most of the members hare decided
that it will injure the movement ntrainst the
| funding bill to present that plan at this time.
A large umber of the committee have taken
this view oJ ihe situation.
1 regret to differ from those with whom I
have been working upon a matter ot vital im
i portancc. I maintain, however, that the Com
mittee of Fifty were appointed upon the uuthor
-1 ity of a mass-meeting which resolved "'that we
here and now appoint a competent committee
duty it shall be to draft a suitable bill
| providing for the foreclosure of the Govern
ment mortgage bonds of the i'ueific railroads
and for the transfer of such to their rightful
owners, the peopie of the United States." This
; resolution was accepted as an amendment by
â¢ the gentlemen who moved the original resoiii
tions and was carried unanimously. Komass
' meeting of citizens of San Francisco can be
' held vhich will repudiate this demand and
step toward Government ownership of the Pa
cific railroads.
Notwithstanding the clear and decidedly ex
pressed wishes of the meeting of December 7,
and without regarding the voice of 200,000
voters who have petitioned Congress to ac
quire and operate the Central and Union Pa
cific railroads as a National undertaking for
the benefit of the whole people, the Committee
of Fifty has assumed a compromising attitude,
which, in my estimation, is unwarranted. . Its
members, who know -what authority they have
to act for the people, have no right to accept
end hold their position unless they truly rep
resent the people and act as directed by "them.
In neglecting to carry out the wishes of their
constituents they do what they condemn in
Supervisors who violate their pledges. In pre
suming to know what is best to do, instead of
following the people's commands, they dis
credit the principles of popular government.
Such conduct upon the part of cur lawmakers
and officials has brought our Nation into a
deplorable condition, and I must, from self
respect and from a high regard for the voice of
the masses, refuse to be a party to the com
mittee's action, and therefore publicly resign
my position as member and secretary.

pense. were taken np from the hold of the !
wreck. It was a six months' job. How
ever, every niece intendect for the craft had ',
been marked, of course, and was ready to \
go into its proper place; As soon as the '
various parts of the monitor bad been
brought up, they were Conveyed to the :
yard at tho foot of Third street! and there,
between the months of June .and Novem
ber, 1864, the work of putting the vesse
tozether was accomplished.
Finally, on the 14th of the latter month,
the launching took place. It is estimated j
that 25,000 people had gathered within the
inclosure of the shipyard at the hour ap- !
pointed for the ceremony. At 11:25 a. m., I
flood tide, Mr. Ryan, the managing con- '
tractor, gave the word, the blocks were |
knocked away, and in an instant the im
mense weight of the vessel sent her down
the well-oiled ways into the element
which was to be her home. About 150 per
sons, including a number of ladies, were
on deck, and as the vessel started an im
mense cheer broke from the assembled
multitude on board and on shore, while
the JNinth Infantry band struck up a loyal
air.
At the moment of her striking the water
Miss Nellie Maguire, a relative of Peter
Donahue, knocked the neck from a bottle
of champagne, and, pouring the wine over
; the deck at the point where the turret was
to stand, christened the harbor defender
: Comanche. The launch was celebrated by
; ft banquet that evening at the Occidental,
where there was an interchange of con
gratulations.
Eloquent speeches were made, including
one by General W. H. L. Barnes in which
he declared that "the launching of the Co
j manche was no oniinarv event and had no
: ordinary significance, "tt'hen this invulner
| able engine of naval warfare touched the
waters of the bay of San FranciM-o it
spoke at once de dance to the fleets of
France now engaged in the infamous
! work of treacherously destroying the '
! liberties of a sister republic, and j
sent away up toward the domin- |
ions of John Bull the premonitory
notice to prepare for the dread reckoning,
the peremptory balancing of accounts
wnich inevitably awaits the nation to
which we owe, more than to all other
causes combined, the evils which have be
fallen us and against which we haveaecum
: ulated a debt of righteous hatred which we
j are bound to discharge with interest indue
! tini<-."
Mr. Barnes' speech reads like an utter
ance of to-day. In conclusion, he offered
the sentiment:
Tne monitor Coir.acehe and the flag of our
Union, the exponent of the idea of National
Unity and the Monroe doctrine, and the em
blem of universal ireedom.
When finally the war came to an end
and peace dawned upon the Jand the
Comanche went into retirement.
The Aquilla was ill-fated. She was i
raised; her wreck was sold; she was re- 'â 
paired at much exp>-n*e and sent to sea '
attain, to founder at length after only a I
few years of service.
But the Comanche! She's almost as!
fresh as they make them. She has had a !
lazy time 01 it for a period nearly as long '
as the average human life; but if the
necessity should arise" her guns may be
heard sounding and helping to swell the
battle chorus of a matchless navy in the
good cause of liberty and justice.
Tiie Government will keep the monitor
ready in case of emergency, and it is possi
ble that in response to a "proposition to be
made to the Navy Department the Co
manche may be turned over to the Naval
Keserve for practice purposes.
CEMETERY SEWERS.
The Laurel Hill Association Complains
to the Supervisors.
The Laurel Hill Cemetery Association
sent a strong protest to the Board of
Supervisors yesterday regarding the sewer
work on California street, between Central
avenue and Walnut street.
The communication stated that by a
resolution adopted December 31. 1894, a
sewer had been ordered laid in the street
between the thojougbfares named and the
contract let to L. J. Welch. In spite of
these facts the work was never done and
the sanitary condition of the district was
likely to suffer In consequence. The asso
ciation stated in its complaint that the
sewer in California street from Walnut
west to Maple had been built and paid for
and that the association wanted tiie sys
tem completed. It was also slated that by
a resolution adopted December 23 last the
block had been ordered paved with bitu
men and that the Superintendent of
Streets should have known that the street
was not properly paved.
The board is* asked to have the work
done at once.
RICH CONTRIBUTIONS.
Mr. Seai-les and Mr. ami Mrs. Avery Send
Valuable Donations to the Art
Institute.
The Mark Hopkins Institute of Art has
received the following letter from Edward
F. Searles:
Methuen, Mass., Jan. 8, 1896.
I James 0 Phelan, President Mark Hopkins In
stitute of Art, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: I have
. ordered shipped from Great Harrington a pic
| ture by Benjamin Constant addressed to your
; institution, which on arrival please accept
with my best wishes for the welfare of the in
j stitute. Wishing you the compliments of the
I season lam yours, very truly, E. F. Searles.
This shows that Mr. Searles has not for
gotten the association, and that he keeps
j up his frequent gifts of pictures and sculp
j tures. Benjamin Constant is one of the
j great masters of modern times, and the
| picture referred to, no doubt, is an excel
lent work, as Mr. Searles is well known as
a conn oiseur and critic.
In the will of the late Mrs. Dr. Toland
there 13 a provision bequeathing to the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art all her
sketches, the work of first-rate Eastern
artists, which were used for the illustra
tion of her books, and also the income
from the sale of her books.
The artists' portfolio which will- be pre
sented to Mr. Searles by the San Francisco
artists as a mark of their esteem and ap
preciation is nearly ready. ' Several of the
gentlemen interested in the Art Associa
tion have subscribed $1000 and have com
missioned Rupert Scbmid to model from
life a bust of Mr. Searles for the Art
Association. Mr. Searles has been asked
to give the sculptor a sitting, ana he will
no doubt comply with this complimentary
request.
In addition to the foregoing the Art In
stitute is just in receipt of some very
costly books donated by Mr. and Mrs. B.
P. Avery and the trustees of the Columbia
College in New York City. One of the
most valuable of the lot is a complete cata
logue of the famous Avery Architectural
Library. This is a large volume of nearly
1200 pages and one of a very limited edi
tion. It bears the following title-page:

Another very valuable contribution from
Mr. and Mrs. 1 Avery is a royal folio volume
of "The Gems- of Stuart Newton', R. A.,"
edited by Henry Murray,- and published
in 1842. Some of the very finest' of metal
engravings are contained in this volume,
which is highly appreciated by the artists.
Another book of the ' lot is "the Masters
of Wood j Engraving," by "W. J. Liuton.
This is also a very valuable volume. In
truth the Art Institute considers itself for
tunate in receiving both these highly
prized contributions. Mr. Avery is the
brother of the Art Association's first
president, who was one time editor of the
Bulletin. .

SHORT LESSONS IN HORSE GUIDANCE.
THH START.
To start right is half the trip.
The other half depends upon doing right, keeping to the right, and supplementing
the horse's sense with your own.
The majority of accidents from careless driving that occur in this City every day
are the result of something wrong at the start.
So be sure you start right.
Look the turnout over carefully before you enter the vehicle, and see that ever-,
thing is shipshape.
Is the h itching-strap in its place? If the guard to your vehicle is low give the
strap a half-hitch about the fender. It is awkward to find, just as you wish to tie, thab
it has fallen out and disappeared.
Cast your eyes over the bar ness. If you are not able to tell at a glance whether
every strap is right you are not competent to undertake the guidance of a horse. I n
doing it you are putting your own life and the lives of others in jeopardy. The points
to be noted as the most frequent seats of accident are the holdbacks, the shaft-band
and the shoulder-strap where it buckles to the breastplate. The most careful stable-
man will sometimes leave a holdback unbuckled. See that the reins are buckled
securely.
Give a thought to the horse. Note if breastplate or saddle-girths seem to be galling

When you are ready to start take the reins decidedly and firmly, so that the animal

If you have to back, in starting, to clear a curb or to turn around, remember fim

ever chasms and surmounting all the
other difficulties that women, according
to the chivalric notion, at least, were never
intended to end
Woman is a mere sociable being than
her brother, anyhow, ana there will be
none to dispute the : r ways are
instinctively the ways of delicacy and re
finement. The male artist, in order to
achieve a triumph in sketching a scene
from higher ridges than were ever ascend
ed by painter before, willingly becomes a
hermit, burying himself, aa it were, from
the world of civilization fur weeks and
months. The inspiration which comes to
him meets no distracting influences.
When the ideal view is reached lie makes
it his own, studies it till the picture is in
effaceably in his mind and till every mark
on his original sketch is mentally trans
lated into a glorious realism.
Now, as to his sister-artist, she will
exercise her talent or even genius in
regions not so difficult of access, or she
may pursue her studies of nature as a
member of a summer pleasure party; but
when it comes to a long, lonely, individual
tramp through some unfrequented and
rugeed piece of countryâ why, that is quite
another thing.
"THE BARROW OF ROSES," BY ALICE B. CHITTENDEN.
Tom Hill and Hngo Fisher may haunt
the heights and depths of the Yosemite,
Bloomer may relish the rarefied atmosphere
of lofty Shasta, ani Will Keith may never

imon. mail his glory, was not arrayed
as one of these" id true not only of the lily.
The same may be said in reference to the
innumerable wild dowers that every spring
brighten, with their varied hues and tints,
the hillsides and the fields, and even the
highways and byways.
One finds among the men more land
scape-painters and among the women
more Sower-painters. Thin is not exactly
because man chooses the sublime and
woman the beautiful, both from prefer-
I ence, although such a view does not look
unreasonable. The preference, in many
! instances, is similarly for the sublime, but
! in the way of the desire of the female
â¢ artist is that question of accessibility
j above referred to. Perhaps all such prob
lems will be successfully and satisfactorily
â  solved when the scepter of the new woman
waves over the land.
It is not an easy uMitter to do justice to
the devotees of art among the women of
San Francisco. Some have won honors in
the East and in Europe. The Call to-day
furnishes sketches from a number of them.
The time will douotless come when, by
some process yet to be discovered, the
daily paper will he enabled to picture
landscapes and flowers in colors on short
notice and without the large amount of
trouble and expense that attends such
efforts at the present day.
The sketch by Miss LilUe L. Kendall is '
i that of a Dunch of California floppies
(esch&choltzias) and wild oats. The fact !
that the eschscholtzia is the California
SState flower causes especial interest to at
tach to it. These poppies grow wild and ;
' often nearly cover the landscape. In the
' spring of the year when they are in great

v.paitn and abundance they usurp grain
lields and line the tracks and roads al
most from one end of the State to the
other. In some localities the3 r bloom all
the year round. To-day, if one chances
to visit the Cliff House, little poppies may
be found thereabout without any trouble.
Miss Kendall has made caretul studies of
many species of wild flowers and has a
gallery of original art works that are as
creditable as they are highly interesting.
Miss Sarah E. Bender is known amone
artists as the "poetic flower-painter."
Violets and roses are lier favorite subjects,
although her work has a wide range. Her
painting of a lot of superb Bon Silene roses
and agrippinas has won much favorable
comment, although not more so than her
attractive picture of violets in a glass.
The rose painting above mentioned was
Â»<riginally sketched from flowers plucked
in May, before Eastern roses are in bloom.
It might be observed here, too, that the
garden flowersâ even those that are intro
duced here from the East â grow larger and
more beautiful than they do elsewhere.
Miss Bender has also done some fine work
in California pinks.
The sketch by Miss Adelaide Hanscom
of Berkeley is a meritorious representa
; tion of a scene in the Coos River country,
Oregon, about fifteen miles above the
; mouth. The mountainous country there
is thickly timbered, and the underbrush is
so dense that one is forced to cut his way
through it if he does not take a beaten
trail. Fir. spruce and cedar trees abound.
In fact, bears and panthers make their
dens in that region, which is wild in more
ways than one. Miss Hanscom was a
member of a camping party that spent the
; summer of 'iH on Coos River, and her col
: lection of sketches taken thereabouts is
something of which any young artist
might well be proud.
Mrs. Susan Sroufe-Loosley has traveled
very extensively both in this country and
Europe and she is free in the expression
that scenery nowhere else compares with
ours in California. "Artists have hardly
begun to discover the unnumbered scenic
attractions of our own State," remarked
Mrs. Loosley. "One might spend years in
that portion of the Colorado Desert which
lies in Riverside County and be contin
ually finding new and delightful as well as
grand and impressive scenes."
The sketch by Mrs. Loosley is that of
the waterfalls in Tabqtlitch Canyon, near
Palm Springs. The latter place is eight
miles from Palm Springs station, and to
reach it a desert of fine rock and sand is
crossed. The palm groves that appear
here and there for nearly 300 miles up into
the mountains make a splendid sicht.
They are from twenty to seventy
feet high and have black clusters of
fruit. Many of the trees have charred
trunks, the Indians believing that by char
ring the trunks of the trees they make the
palmfruit sweeier. The notion is a foolish
one, of course, and the Indians in so doing
are simply hastening the death of the very
trees they depend on for mucn of their
choice food. In the black canyons near
Palm Springs are many cacti.
Mrs. Loosley has visited Alaska, and her
collection of curios is a rare and valuable
one. In connection with her studio is
quite a museum, wherein may be found
treasures of art, antiques and curios from
all parts of the world. There is a fine case
of mineral specimens. Here is the eye of
a whale, and there are a whale's ears petri
fied. In a cage in one corner is a Gila
monster, whose bite is deadly poison. It
lives on eggs. The figures that nature
painted on the Gila's back remind one of
an Indian hieroglyph.
Mrs, loosely makes a specialty of land
scape painting, although portraiture and
flowers, etc., are among her works.
Miss Alice B. Chittenden's sketch is that
of a wheelbarrow full of roses. The orig
inal may be seen at the Hopkins Art In
stitute, where it never fails to attract
favorable notice. It may be said that
Miss Chittenden has made, perhaps, the
most extended study of wiTd flowers of
any California artist. In her studio may
be seen sixty paintings, each representing
one or more native flowera. Each paint
ing is a work of art in itself. It is the in
tention, ultimately, to have a volume pub
lished, with illustrations of native flowers
based on this collection. Miss Chittenden
has also won encomiums for portrait paint
ing; but she takes especial pride in her
floral work â roses and chrysanthemums
being her specialties. She paints these
flowers out of doors and there is a fresh-

ncsa about them that smacks of the sun
light and the open air.
Miss Eva W. Withrow has attained dis
tinction as a portrait-painter. The sketch
on this page is from a portrait of J. Frank
furrier, who was Miss Withrow's teacher
in Munich, and who is one of the first of
the impressionist school. Mr. Currier is
a native of Boston, but for twenty years
has made his home in the German art
center. His painting, "The Whistling
Buoy," created something of a sensation
in the art world a few years ago. Mis 3
Wiilirow takes a prominent rank among
our portrait-painters. Some years ago she
painted a sketch of San Francisco, look
ing toward the bay, from her studio. It
attracted attention, and was sold and
taken to England. The owner of this
painting recently died, and now Miss
Withrow is eager to regain possession of
the painting, and has made overtures to
purchase it back.

MOVED EUGENIE TO TEAES.
Mrs. Cora Potter Relates a Pathetic In
cident of Her Stay at Cowes.
"A pathetic and never-to-be-forgotten
incident occurred to me while stopping at
Cowes, the great English yachting center,
in the summer of 1886," writes Mrs. Cora
Urquhart Potter. "What is called the
'Squadron week' was in full swing, and
the beautiful Solent was crowded with
yachts belonging to the princes, nobility
and wealthy commoner? of England.
Conspicuous among the magnificent craft
assembled was the Osborne, the royal
yacht, on which his Royal HighnesÂ« me
Prince of Wales, the Princess of Wales
and their family were spending the time.
"Entertainments were the order of the
day at Cowes, for the session ends there
the 12th of August, carrying all the men
north to the moors for "shooting. I had
received an invitation from H. 11. H. the
Princesa of Wales to lunch on the Os
borne, and at the hour named I stepped
on the launch awaiting me at the castle
steps and steamed out to the yacht.
"It was rÂ»ne of tl^ose glorious summer
day? when nature seemed to bave put on
her best; everything was bright, beautiful
ami brilliantly gay. Arrived at the great
dock's gangway, I was received by the
Prince â whose courteous manner is" a by
word the world overâ and soon found my
self the center of a brilliant party, con
spicuous among whom were the King of
Greece, the Crown Prince of Austria and
the King of I'ortu al. and. lastly, the
sad-eyed but beautiful Eugenic, Empress
of tne French.
"After lunch, and during the idle hour
before tea was served, the Princess asked
me if I would recite something. I had
often recited for iier Royal Highness be
fore, but oo this occasion she wished me
to do .so specially for the Empress Eugenic,
whom I now had the honor of meeting for
the first time. I was not at all nervous,
for no people in the world knew better
how to make one feel at perfect ease than
those among whom I found myself. I
asked the Princess if she had any choice
of pieces, and she said no; but suggested I
should give one of the many characteristic
little American poems she had heard me
recite before. So 1 stood up.
"The Empress was close to me, right
before me, and I gave 'Kentucky Belle.'
I saw the tears gradually gathering in her
great, sad eyes, and fall silently down her
pale cheeks. I had touched and touched
deeply a chord that reverberated through
the chambers of her memory, and took
her back to a scene far away in Africa,
where her dead boy lay, pierced to the
heart by the assegais of the savages, to
wnom he dearly sold his lite.
"When the last words of the poem left
my lips the Empress rose, and, coming up
to me, folded me to her heart, and, with a
voice trembling with emotion, said : 'God
bless you, my child. You have made me
feel as I have never felt since my poor boy

was killed â God bless you! I shall never
forget this day.' Then she kissed me,
and, drawing me to a seat by her, holding
my hand in hers, she talked to me for a
long time, and I felt keenly what the loss
of that son meant to the sweet, gentle
woman beside me, who had once been
Empress of the French." âBoston Herald.
A Suggestion for Entertainers.
A worthy Parisian tradesman who in
vited his friends some time ago to a soiree
dansante has had a bad experience of the
class of entertainers whom George Gros
smith calls society clowns. One of his
THE FALLS IN TAHQUITCII CANYON, BY MRS. LOOSLEY.
friends recommended him to secure the
services of a certain young man to amuse
the guests. The tradesman took the ad
vice, and the young man was among those
who attended the soiree. First, the young
man jrive an imitation of Paulus, then be
gan an imitation of Mme. Sarah Bern
hardt. So far, all went well. The per
former then said :
11 1 shall now give you my celebrated
sketch of the 'gentleman who takes the
piano to pieces to lincl a halfpenny he has
dropped inside it.' " First he took off the
wooden c;ise, then he proceeded to un
screw tkc instrument, piece by piece, and
Tn pile up the pieces on the rioor. There
v.is much Jaughter when, after all this,
the young man said, "I have it," and ex
hibited a halfpenny. When it came to
patting the piano together again, how
ever, he declared it must be sent to the
maker's, and there was therefore no
dancing that night. A hundred francs
damages were awarded by a court of law
to the outraged tradesman, who very
naturally pleaded that when he invited an
entertainer to make his guests laugh, it
was not in order that they should be made
to laugh at his expense. â London Daily
News.
ROMEO AND JULIET.
Shakespeare Changed the Construction
for the Better.
In one important matter Shakespeare
has followed neither Bandello nor Porto,
but Boalstuau and Brooke. In the drama
Rome is dead when Juliet awakes; in
Bandello and Porto there is a terrible
scene between the dying husband
and the waking wife. And I cannot for
bear to offer a few remarks on this
matter, because many have considered
Shakespeare's version inferior.
I do not think Shakespeare has always
improved on what he lias received from
others, but in this respect, assuming that
he knew the other version of the dying
see ne, I think he has; or, to put it in an
other way, I think the dramatic version is
the better one for dramatic purposes,
whether our English poet mada a de
liberate choice or not. "Mrs. Fanny
Kemble," says a writer in the Sat
urday Review (September 24, 1892), "pre
ferred, apparently, Garrick's version of
'Romeo and Juliet' to the original.
"Garrick returned to the finale in the
novel oi 'La Giulieua,' by Luigi da Porto,
where Romeo does not die till Juliet
awakes from her trance. Mrs. Kemble con
sidered this a liner end from a dramatic
point of view. It certainly is." Is it? The
scene on the stage is terrible enough as it
is, and the emotions of terror and pity are
as intense as an Aristotle could wish,
liow, then, could we bear the agony of a
scene between the dying Romeo and his
awakening bride? ft is horrible to read
of, but to set before one's eyes would be,
in my judgment, intolerable.
In the story meant for reading it is ap
propriate, and arouses the feelings of com
miseration to the highest degree. Khake-
speare has reached the same end, though
Romeo dies first. Both are right, I con
sider; the story for a story, the drama for
a drama. Faultless and infallible the
English iEschylus was not, but to side
with Garrick here and to offer Shakespeare
"the show of violence" would be "to do
him wrong, being so majestical." â Gen
tleman's Magazine.

SOCIETY
AS SEASON succeeds season and
year follows year, each one seems
to attain an individuality; each
one in San Francisco has itspoDU
lar form of entertainment. Our people
are very fond of following each other,
and if some favorite house or some
one of our society leaders, early in the sea
son, gives an entertainment it will be at
tractive and popular and at once all the
other entertainers take it up and give
something like it.
Tiiis season is a great one for dinners.
They are the idol of the hour, and it is said
that before the last cotillon they were more
numerous than ever before. Some years
a;.', i toas on Saturdays were the rage, and so
popular were they that the musicians and
caterer had to be engaged weeks ahead,
and the knowing ones had to be consulted
to see if any one else had a reception fixed
for the same evening, and the invitations
were sent out well in advance to hea-J off
all possibility of a conflict.
These afternoon affairs on Saturdays
had so much to recommend them in every
way that it was not to be expected that they
would go out of fashion, but tuoy have
almost entirely done so â certainly as to
Saturday and inviting men to them. The
thing that was most powerful in bringing
about this result was that on Saturdays
the girls as well as the men preferred to
spend their half holiday out of town, and
then the evening was entirely lost as noth
ing could be done after the tea, and the
girls, always a great number of them, were
tired out by standing so longâ the recep
tions generally lasting from 4 until 7.
These were usually great crushers, since
the main object was !o pay off all obliga
tions with a tea.
So now, much to the delight of the men
and the girls as well, dinners and theater
parties! are the all-pormlar ways of enter
tainment.
Friday appears to b-> in favor for recep
tion day among brides, quite a number
having chosen that day for the present
month. Mrs. Howard Bennett, formerly
Miss Julia Conner, receives at her mother's
home on first and second Fridays; Mr*.
Shattnck (nee Sharp) and Mrs. Samuel
Knight (nee Holbrook) have chosen the
lirst, second and third Fridays. Mrs.
Knight's second at home, which took
place on the lOtii, was largely attended,
and proved a delightful affair.
My previous reference to the wedding
lees given by Englishmen, says Vanity,
who marry American heiresses, has been
so much discussed, not unly in the papers,
but at dinner-tables and afternoon teas,
thnt a mention of the Leiter-Curzon wed
ding of last spring may not be amiss. It
will be remembered that Bishop Talbot of
Western Nebraska married the couple,
and the fact that he was in hopes of re
ceiving a sum large enough to materially
assist him in his missionary work. When
asked by a friend after the ceremony if
his services were sufficiently recompensed,
the Bishop shook his head sadly and re
plied: "The fee was not as big as I ex
pected, but thenâ a pound 19 a large ff-e
for an Englishman!" It is possible the
Bishop got two pounds, thongh ho didn't
say so. In any case, he ia better off than
Bishop Littlejohn, who received zero for
his services in the Marlborough wedding.

TWELFTH NIGHT PAKTY. '
Merry Gathering Held On the 6th IÂ»st., at
the Bcsidenoe of Mrs. Bobert Bruce,
A merry party assembled at the residence
of Mr. Robert Bruce, 254.6 Jackson street.
on the 6th inst., Twelfth Night and
many games peculiar to the day were
p.ayed, that have been in vogue ,in Scot
land and Ireland, from time immemorial. An
| important part of the festivities is thechoosing
of a king and queen for the evening. Th's is
done through the medium of a large cake, in
which are hidden one black and one white
bean, 'iiie cuke is cut, each guest taking a
slice, and the gentleman finding the black, i
and the lady finding the white one in their
portions, are king and queen respectively.
The fortunate ones this time were Laurence Va"n
j Winkle and Miss Frances Curry, and they were
I crowned with much ceremony. Partners for i
j supper were ctaown by the mcii hanging pieces
oi ribbon over the banisters from the hall
above, thegirlseatchingtheotherend. Dancing
followed supper, and was continued until long
]ia>t the usual hour for adieus to be said.
Twelfth Night is becoming more in favor in I
late years as a medium of merry making, as '
has also "All Hallow's Eve." In* the Eastern !
cities, both these occasions are signals for large
and numerous gatherings, formality is thrown
aside and even-body is ready for fun snd jol
lity.

CABLE-CAR ACCIDENT.
Little Blanche Lyons Narrowly Escapes
Heine Crushed to Death by a
McAlligter-Street Car.
Elanche Lyons. 4}Â£ years of age, the
daughter of A. J. Lyons of 919 McAllister
street, had a narrow escape from being
â¢crushed to death by a cable-car last even-
ing.
The little pirl was riding .on a b'cycle on
the opposite side of the street shortly be
fore G o'clock, when her mother came out
on the porch. Blanche had apparently
started to cross the street to join her
mother and got in front of car 2U2.
She was knocked down and fell in front
of the car. Mrs. Lyons was frantic with
grief, as she expected to see her little
daughter's mangled corpse. The car* had
shoved her along for a few feet before it
was stopped, and when the conductor bent
down to drag her out he found her
I jammed against the fender. She was
i alive and was carried into her father's
house.
Dr. Janes was summoned and he found
that her right leg was broken in three
places, twice below the knee and once
above. The little h" nger of her right hand
was hanging by shreds and it was ampu
tated. The broken bones of ttie leg were
set, and unless she has suffered internal
injuries, which will not bfe known for two
or three days yet, she will recover.
Neither the conductor nor gripman, nor
any representative of the Market-street
Cable Company, called at the house to as
certain whether the little girl was dead or
alive.

Arbitration, Says the President's Critic,
Is the Very Thing England
Will Want.
Attorney J. F. Evans is inclined to view
the attitude of the Cleveland administra
tion on the Venezuelan question with a
very critical eye.
He has had a great deal of experience
upon international questions on this conti
nent. During the Pan-American Congress,
which the brilliant statesman from Maine,
James G. Blame, succeeded in bringing
about as a masterstroke of Republican
policy, Mr. Evans was secretary to the
commercial committees of that notable
gathering. It was largely due to his ex
haustive report on the Blaine- Romero
commercial treaty between this country
and Mexico that the treaty was found alto
tether defective from the standpoint of
the United States. Besides these connec
tions with' Pan-American affairs, Mr.
Evans devoted twenty-eight years of his
life to service in the Treasury Department.
The manner in which Mr. Evans dis
cusses the administration's use of the
Monroe doctrine and the demand of Secre
tary Olney for arbitration, and incident
ally the effect of the President's message,
he thinks, will open the eyes of the Repub
licans to a possible sinister side of the
Cleveland-Olney policy. In short, Mr.
Evans is of the opinion that Grover Cleve
land is, after all, simply endeavoring to
make this country play tail to the British
kite, for it is his belief, as he views the re
cent reports from London, that arbitra
tion, under the circumstances, would much
better serve British interests than Amer
ica's, and that England will be only too
willing to arbitrate, when once her eyes
are opened to her advantage. The position
taken by Mr. Evans is best stated in his
own words of yesterday, as follows:
Though the discussion by public men and
the press of the Monroe doctrine proceeds
without abatement of Interest or any indica
tion of cessation, yet so far one solution oiÂ»ly
has been suggested as a means of healing the
pending rupture between this country and
1 Great Britain and that is the submission of ihe
j matter in dispute to international arbitration.
This was the position taken by our Govern
| ment in its state papers in the earlier discus
sion of the subject. It is the position assumed
by Mr. Norman, the British agent recently sent
to Washington as a correspondent of the Lon
! don Chronicle. It is the position of the Amer
ican press generally, of Senators Sherman.
Lodge and other statesmen to whom the people
: naturally look for guidance in the hour of dan
| ger or distiess.
To a person not specially trained in diplo
matic intrigue it is difficult to comprehend the
reasoning on this all-important and engross
ing subject or to agree in the conclusion BO
generally expressed. I have read the tervent
utterance of Senator Lodge that the. Monroe
doctrine is not founded upon international
law, but like the Declaration of Independence
is our American doctrine. i 'â¢ â¢-.
It is undoubtedly true that the Monroe doc
trine is peculiarly an American doctrine, and
to this fact is to be attributed the stirring effect
: of the epigram of the gifted Senator, but it does
| not follow that the doctrine does not rest upon,
â  sound principles of international law.
Whatever obscurities of definition, whatever
'â  conflict of opinion of publicists and other
authorities may exist as to the purposes, func
tion und scope of international law, there is
one maxim which is clear and distinct and
upon which all agree, and that is, "A nation
by virtue of its sovereignty has a right to
| maintain its own existence and integrity."
The jurisdiction - of a state or nation over
i foreign vessels within its own ports or harbors,
or upon the high seasâ the marine league, or
cannon-shot distanceâ and its revenue jurisdic
tion for even a greater distance upon the high
seas, (ire founded upon this principle.
If it be true that the extension of European
territorial limits upon this continent would be
a menace and danger to this Nation, it is our.
\ sovereign duty to guard against it, and this
right is founded upon international law. It is
i not only like the Declaration ot Independence,
but ft part of it, giving significance and effect
to its words.
The patriotic manifestations of the last few
days leave no room for doubt that the prin
ciple involved and the occasion for Invoking
H are thoroughly understood and indorsed by
the people of the United States.
It may be doubted whether the executive of
fices of the Nation have a better appreciation
of the doctrine than the people generally, ii
the manner of presenting the subject is taken
as a test of comparison.
I allude to the proposition of this Govern
ment made to Great Britain to submit the
subject matter of a quarrel between the two
nations, involving tlie enforcement of the Mon
roe doctrine, to a committee composed of the
representatives oi three other nations for set
tlement.
We are given to understand that a demand
has been made iv the name of the Monroe
doctrine upon Kngiana to arbitrate her diffi
culty with Venezuela, and that the demand
has been snoeringly relumed.
It is therefore to be topically inferred that if
the proposition of t lie Government hid been
accepted the inattfr would have there ended,
Monroe doctrine, Ivclaration of Independence
and all connected with it to the contrary.
In line, her Britannic Majesty In conjunction
with Venezuela [who up to this time has never
evinced a very lively interest in tho Monroe
doctrine) would have proceeded to organize
the commission. England would most cer
tainly select as her member a representative of
a European Prince; Venezuela, a representa
tive of come one of the American republics,
and they two would have to unite in a third
memberâ in all probability a representative of
a European nation.
The United States is not a party to this
record. She has no voice in the (selection of
arbitrators, nor right to be hearti before tnem
â when selected. In fact she would have notn
ing to do in the matter but look on. Yet to
6uch gracious hands as they has our Govern
ment proposed to entrust ourprecious doctrine
of Monroe.
The award of the arbitratorsâ probably ad
verse to Venezuela, resulting from honest mis
take of fact or collusion of the parties, or
natural resentment against the authority of
the members of the commission as to our own
American doctrineâ ls to be final, absolutely
final, because of our own urgent request to
arbitrate, accompanied by threats to shoot for
non-compliance. In such manner it was pro
posed that a few respectable gentlemen should
be permitted to attend to the matter of pre
venting the extension of British dominion on
the American continent in the name of the
Monroe doctrine.
To the ordinary mind the Monroe doctrine is
a solid wall against just such extension as
claimed by Great Britain by any mode what
ever, whether by conquest, treaty, purchase or
arbitration, or what not. If it does not mean
this it means nothing. It is a mere brutum
fulmen, or nothing more than a loud but
harmless voice, and should be abandoned and
the further discussion of the Monroe doctrine
stopped. It is a declaration against a further
acquisition by monarchical governmentsof ter
ritory on this continent, and can no more be
inado the subject, matter 01 arbitration than
the truth of the ten commandments, an axiom
in geometry or any other self-evident proposi
tion.
Under this doctrine Venezuela is safe from
Invasion by the armies of Europe. Under it
she would promptly be invaded by our own
armies if she should even by treaty or arbitra
tion surrender one foot of rightful soil to any
Kuropean power no matter what compensating
advantages such treaty or award gave her. In
each instance the menace and danger to this
Nation are the same, and the wail should be
impregnable at all points.
It is surprising that the President and the
Secretary of .State, who seem to be fully im
bued with the gravity of the situation, should
have proffered no broad a stairway as arbitra
tion to England of all the nations of the world
to surmount and destroy our American doc
trine.
It is our good fortune that thus far she seems
to have Leon blind to her opportunity. The
present danger is that she will suddenly
awnken and open her eves and take it to her
embrace. Indeed The indications now all point
this way. It is not pleasant to forecast the em
barrassments and complications which would
ensue.
But consideration of them may be nostponed
to the event. Meanwhile the President, with
the assistance of Congress, is doing what ought
to have been done without forewarning Eng
land, namely: try to ascertain the facts re
specting the true and actual boundaries of
England's territorial possessions. That done
the patriotism and intelligence'of our citizens
may be depended upon to keep them as we de
termine them for ourselves, without resort to
arbitration, or proposal for arbitration, for a
proposal to arbitrate, should never have been
made and must not be resorted to it' the doc
trine of Monroe is to be respected and main
tained and treated as meaning more than a
mere obtrusive interference in the affairs of
other Governments.
HEAVY LEGAL TALENT.
Henry N. Clement and Tfenben H.
Lloyd Engaged in a Suit for
Less Than SIOO.
Some heavy legal talent Was engaged in
an apparently unimportant case in Justice
of the Peace Barry's court yesterday.
Jeremiah Lynch is the owner of the prop
erty at 1110 Market street and a few months
ago rented it to tenants, who, in turn,
sublet the basement to Kohlberg, Strauss
& Frohman. Mr. Lynch did not learn of
the transaction for some time ur that
some slittht alterations had been made in
the basement. When he did his anger
was great and he demanded $G0 for one
month's rent from the firm, as well as
damages to the extent of $25.
Neither beincr forthcoming he sued for
$85, Henry N. Clement being his attorney.
Reuben H. Lloyd appeared for the de
fense, and for a while the legal battle
raged as though the amount at issue was
thousands instead of less than $100. Jus
tice Barry pave judgment for the aefense,
as the relation of landlord and tenant was
not established between Mr. Lynch and
the iirm.
UNION LEAGUE ELECTION
Colonel Stone Up for President
Instead of General
Dimond.
The Fight for the Secretaryship Be
tween George H. Pippy and
John J. Wirtner.
The merry war in the Union League
Club goes bravely on, and if, as clubmen
say. contests are good things for clubs the
habitues of the comfortable quarters in
the Palace Hotel have a very good thing.
In consequence of General Dimoud's de
termination to withdraw from the candi
dacy for a directorship and the presidency
against General Friedrich, the nominating
committee met again yesterday at noon to
choose a substitute. They named Colonel
George Stone, called in their original
ticket and had. a new set printed. Colonel
Stone, who is one of the leading lights of
the club, is understood to be the candi
date for the presidency as against General
Friedrich ot the members' ticket. He is
president of the People's Home Savings
Bunk and is interested with the McMutries
in raiiroad contracts on the Coast line be
tween San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara.
"It is a good thing for the club to have
these little contests." said Paris Kilburr.
yesterday. "The only man who seems to
object to it is Dan Cole over there, who
goes about Baying 'Let's have harmony.'
Probably I would do that, too, if I were a
candidate and on all the tickets as be is."
The election which takes place on
Tuesday will probably bring out the
largest vote ever cast in the club. The
clnbrooms are nearly as lively as they are
on the eve of a National election "with
the members who are electioneering for
their favorites.
On the principle that there cannot ba
too much of a good thing there were
movements on foot Jast evening to put up
a couple more tickets, and they may be
ported to-day.
Next in interest to the fight between
General Friedrich and Colonel Stone for
the presidency is the contest over the
secretaryship between George H. Pippy,
the incumbent, and John J. Winner. It
is understood that if the Friedrich ticket
wins Wirtner will be chosen, while Pippy
is the choice of the supporters of Colonel
Stone.

ARMORIES FOR THE GUARD
The Move of the Third From
Golden Gate Avenue to
Market Street.
DISSATISFACTION ALL AROUND.
What Would Happen in the Event of
a Draft Being Requiredâ Recent
General Orders.
The stragetic move of the three com
panies of the former Third Regiment from
their armory on Golden Gate avenue to
the Market-street armory will bring the
armory question to a focus. The issuance
of regimental order No. 3, dated January
9, after the companies had moved to the
Market-street armory, directs and orders
the commanding officers of these com
panies to move all military property, etc.,
to the Page-street armory before Febru
ary 1, and appears to have been issued
with the view that they were located on
Golden Gate avenue at the time, although
it was known to the acting adjutant that
these companies had moved all their mili
tary property on the Bth, a day before the
order was issued;
It is well known that the companies
commanded by Captains Cunningham and
Miller had completed their arrangements
to move Irom the Page-street armory to
the Ellis-street armory, and the presump
tion is that Captain Cunningham being
the acting adjutant of the regiment
Colonel Mucdonald must have been aware
of this, both by reason of the official con
nection of the colonel and the acting ad
jutant and their intimacy.
Captains Connolly, Fitzpatrick and War
ren claim that they moved under orders
from Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, who was
then in command of their battalion, issued
early in December, and ask that having
complied therewith, why they should
aeain be required to move to the Pace
street armory, and naturally ask why
they should be the only ones ordered to
move under Regimental Orders No. 3, and
that it could not have Deen for the purpose
of concentration when the contemplated
removal of the companies commanded by
Captains Cunningham and Miller is taken
into consideration.
The entire subject will undoubtedly bo
brought to the attention of the board of
location, who, to settle a matter which ap
parently must lead to interminable dis
cord, will order the concentration of the
entire command under one roof.
While more than a month has elapsed
since it was decided to reduce the force,
great dissatisfaction still exists, particu
larly among the older members of the
guard, at the manner in which these con
solidations were made and the apparent
discrimination against the older com
panies. Numbers of the men transferred
to tho several companies are applying for
their discharges, declining to serve in the
companies to which they have been trans
ferred.
It is apparent from the locality of the
companies permitted to remain in the
service that no consideration was paid to
that portion of section 1912 of the Po'itical
Code which requires that the companies
i "must be located throughout the State
with reference to the military wants
thereof, means of concentration and other
j military requirements." Many, therefore,
j contend that if it was necessary to reduce
the number of companies on account
of the inadequacy of the appropria
tion, the ax should have fallen
on the younger companies, particularly

all except one being in the interior of the
State, and not upon such coin;
whose long and faithful service entitles
them to more consideration. By the pro
visions of General Order No. 17 of the
twelve companies consolidated, or mus
tered out, but three of them were organ
ized during 1893, viz.- Companies D and
H, Second Infantry, and Company G,
Eightu infantry, the other nine companies
dating their organization for many years
prior thereto, notably Company D, First
Infantry, organized June 15, 18Â«1; Com
pany H, Second Artillery, August 7.
Company I), Second Artillery, May 28,
18t)8â each of these companies being in fair
condition at the t :.'n<>.
Particularly is this feeline among the
members of "the Second Brigade in this
City, the brigade having lost nine com
panies since June 1, while the First Brig
ade has practically lost none and the
Third Brigade but six. These losses ap
pear more prominent when the population
of the several brigade limits is taken into
consideration. Taking the vote of the
State at the last election, the I 4 irst Brig
ade, with fifteen companies, has one com
pany to 4073 voters, while the Second
Brigade has twenty-five companies, being
one company to 5079 voters. Under that
ratio the Second Brigade limits should
have thirty-one companies instead of
twenty-five. To illustrate: In case of a
draft being ordered, using the voting cop
ulation as a basis, the limits of the Second
Brigade would be required to furnish
double the number of men called for from
the limits of the First Brigade.
WILL CONNECT FORMOSA.
A Cable to Be Laid From Southern
Japan to the Captured
Island.
Engineer Mino and Others Now Here
En Route to London to Board
the Cable-Ship.
Among the arrivals here yesterday on
the Peru were six Japanese who are bound
to London to boartl a ship for the purpose
of laying a cable between Kagoshinia, in
Southern Japan, and the newly acquired
island of Formosa.
The ship they will board is the Okinawa,
lately built at Glasgow for the especial pur
pose of laying the cable. It ha* the cable
aboard, besides all the requisite machinery
for laying it in the bed of the ocean.
The Japanese gentlemen alluded to are
all at the Occidental. Among: them is K.
Mino, ttie chief engineer, and Y. Okami,
second engineer. Tin y told about the
cabie project last night.
"The cable will by between 500 and 600
miles in length," said Chief Engineer
Mino, "and will be laid at a depth, for
most of the way, of aoout three miles.
It will cost a large sum of money.
"The reason we want it is to connect us
more closely with Formosa, our newly ac
quired possession. The war is now over
there, we having conquered the Black Flac
people. We will be about three months in
completing the laying of the cable. One
of our vessels, with eighty-six men aboard,
left Yokohama some time since, to assist
in laying the cable."
They will s.tart for New York and Lon
don to-morrow. Several other prominent
Japanese arrived with them. Viscount
Taniura is one of them. He is to enter
the United States Nnva! Academy at An
napo'is by courtesy of the United States.
Mr. Segawa, who isalonj:, will enter the
Japanese consular oiiice here.
Some one declares that "the method of
conveyance of Irish cattle across the Irish
channel is a disgrace to the nineteenth
century."

Between Fifth and Sixth.A ROBBERY
ON THE
MIDDLE TOWN
GRADE.
tT WAS about 9 o'clock of a fine spring
morning that three highwaymen,
masked and armed, while lying in wait
â  Middle town stage, were discon-
certed to observe a lad leisurely de
scending the grade afoot, his arms
;ing in a wide arc with his
long- reaching legs and his throat giv
ing loud voice to the joy with
â¢which the gladness of the morning tilled
ml. For the stage was nearly due from
: posite direction, and they feared t'.iat
tl c unwitting intruder would be too near
the critical moment, even though,
should he Keep on, he would be far pits t
pot where tho s:a::e was to be stopped.
â ing would have to be done. The
of ritles in the still mountain air
. carry far, a:i<i a sound like that gives
ivitation and speed to the legs of a
â¢he distance of his first appearance
emed an ordinary green mountain
: '.hereabout, an innocent yo^el,
rnely loose-jointed, shabbily dressed
yes, and was varying his
unmelodious singing with talking and
in the utter abandon of a sense
of solitude. Only one of the three men
â  to crawl out and peer at him
through the bushes, and that was the
which he made to the others. This
was a short, wiry, nervous young
man, called by his companions Jim. An
other of the man was younger still, very
tall, and in manner constrained and ap
osive, as though this might have
been hi* first experience of the kind; he
was addressed an Dick. The third, whom
the merest glance would have revealed as
the leader, was of middle ace and medium
Mze, coo!, suong and patient, suggesting a
. him the others called Tom.
<>n came the youth down the grade, un- I
conscious of the terrible dangers into
which he might be walking and which |
were so iiercely out of harmony with the
Splendors of the day. It was such a sprint;
morning as the coast mountains of Cali
i give birth to and riot in. The dainty
perfume of tiie wild lilac strove for mas- ;
terv w:th the bold fragrance of the ceano- ;
thus. Panicles of white blossoms of the i
wild grape hung from tall trees which the
bad taken for a ladder to the sun- i
phine and sky. From out the depth of a!
luxuriant tangle of foliage which rilled the
canyon on the lower side of the grade rose
the tinkling babble of a mountain stream,
â  the upper side of the grade sprang ;
a steep wooded slope, which, rolling away
i:i undulations of constantly increasing
â  anally merged into the proper base <
of grim bt. Helena, the steely blue of i
oald and forbidding summit gleamed \
coldly in the distance through the trees.
the boy approached the wine of the |
morning worked with increasing vigor in !
:. s veins; and then, by one of those pro- j
of perversity whose secrete no hu- |
man mind can ; the intoxication
Eeemed to overcome him ; for at a spot in
the road exactly opposite the hiding-place
of the robbers he stopped, stretched him
self with a perilous approach to gei.eral
dislocation, yawned in a perfect luxury of
tdeand began a most extraordinary '
series of speeches, songs and physical evo- !
iutions.
The three men were concealed behind a
ich lay parallel with the road a short
. ;>ce from its lower side. Far away
down the grade the shouts and whip
crackings of the stage-driver were already
audible as he urged the tugj
slowly up the grade. The robbers had
knowledge of an uncommon amount of
ore in the expres>-box. and the sim
ple accident of a country boy happening
:it this t;me of all others was not to
be permitted to dash their bright pros
pects to the groun 1.
Ail that passed in the minds of the
crouching men as they ground their teeth
and inwardly ctu-aed need not be enlarged
upon here. Whether to seize, bind and
gag the iad and drag him into the woods
till the deed was done, or to slip a knife
quietly between his ribs where lie stood
and drop his body on the lower side of the
log, or to force him to assist in the enter
prise â doubtless all these matters were
considered. More than likely the free
young life would have been let out in
preference to ail other plans had not the
a-ader made an extraordinary discovery
ami taken an unexpected course.
AVLile his companions were fintrering
their knives impatiently the man called
Tom waÂ« regarding the lad with a calm
and piercing scrutiny.
'KJodP' tie exclaimed, "the boy's an
idiot."
"Well, Til bed !" replied the short,
nervous man called Jim. "That makes it
I'M slit his windpipe and "
Jim was m the act of springing forward
to carry out his purpose, when the leader
caught his arm in an iron grip, and hold
in/ him thus, as a cat would a mou.-e, he
iuid. with awe in his throat :
"No man that ever murdered an idiot
since the world was born has stepped out
of this Jife with his boots off!"
The awe of riis manner and the firmness
of it suppressed the nervous Jim at once
and sent a slight shiver through the slender
frame of Dick. "I'll attend to the boy,"
addeu Tom. This was simply because the
boy might prove less dangerous as an
acquaintance than as a possibly intruding
â trail
\\ ith that Tom stepped boldly into the |
road, masked and armed as he was, and
directly approaches the lad.
"Hello, my son," said he in a^ cherry
voice, "don't you want bo me fan?"
The kid turned with a quick start, and
fear appeared in his dull face. His scant;
chin dropped, his mouth opened, his eyes
re^urded the formidable apparition with a
peculiar luster, and every muscle in his
body was on & strain for instant exercise
in night. But the stranger's voice was so
round and friendly and his manner so free
and hearty and masterful that, despite a
forbidding outward aspect, the lad was |
drawn under his power. As the man con- ;
tinned to talk in his simple, straight
forward, friendly way the tension of the
lad's muscles gradually relaxed, the wild
look in his eyes softened, his weak chin
rose \f> its higher function, and finally a
sni'le came over his face. Then he cave
forth the vacant, coarse, mirthless laugh
of his kind.
Tom hail been telling him about the great
fun which he and his friends weregoin â  to
have. The stage was comine up the grade;
they were going to jump out into the road,
throw up their rifles and point them, so;
tho driver would pull up his horses; the
| rifles would be tired just to make the fun
; ail the better: the driver would throw
, down a box and then go on his way â oh, it
would by the greatest fun in the world!
The picture was most alluring to the
boy, albeit several repetitions of it were re
quired before he could fully grasp its
' meaning. When he finally did, after in
terrupting its recital a number of times
with vacant laughter and wild ejacula
tions, he became greatly excited and
entered heartily into the spirit of the en
terprise.
â¢â l'frh, huh!" he cried. "I like that.
Heap o' fun! Huh, huh, huh ! Shoot the
gun â bang! Wow, how, howl"
'â Ail right, then," saui Tom. "Here
comes the stage. Take this" (handing him
a stick); "it is your gun. You point it
when we point ours; you shoot when we
shoot. What's your name?"
"Luny," slabbered the boy over his thick
Tom drew him into the thicket where
the others were concealed. For a moment
the boy seemed apprehensive when brought
into the presence of Jim and Dick, but
they took up the cue given by Tom, and
with kind and reassuring words welcomed
tte lioy and made him feel at ease.
Thâ¬ stage clowly climbed the grade, the
horses laboring heavily and snorting at
intervals. The driver, all unsuspecting,
urged them forward with word and wnip
crack. Suddenly four forms leaped into
t:f- road at bis horses' heads; one seized
a bridle, and two others, one on either side,
held the driver covered with rifles, while
a fourth, shambling about with great un
certainty, brandished a stick which ho
carried, made feints of shooting with it,
and laughed and crowed delightedly.
with the demand to throw down the box
came a shot from one of the robbers. The
driver dropped the lines and sat pale,
silent and distressed. A woman's scream
Sed from the interior of t.:e stage, and it
answered with a raking volley and a
mand to keep heads within" or get
them blown to eternal torment.
The box soon fell with a heavy thump
Â«the road. To provide against the pos
ity of a trick the passengers were or
i out, stood in line, searched and
fd, and the interior and boot of the
stage were examined. Then the passen
gers were ordered back and the driver
P:ted sharply to proceed on his way.
soon as the stage was gone the rob
dragged the box over the log and
c it open with an ax. The treasure
h they expected to rind was all
:â bags of gold and silver coin. Still
ng a triok, they opened the bags and
their linger^ through the gaining
metal; it was sound and beautiful and the
sweetest music rang in its tinkle. They
hastily tied up the. parcels and prepared to
pick up their rifles and escape into the
forest which filled the canyon and
blanketed the mountain slopes, and find
waiting horses tethered in a gulch not far
away.
But an unexpected thing had happened.
They had given no heed whatever to the
idiot boy, who was dancing and capering
about in the linpst glee. Discovering that
his mock weapon was inferior in beauty to
the polished rifles of his new friends, he
had appropriated the one belonging to
Dick, ihe tail young novice. More tl:an

that, the boy had seen the sheen and
heard the tinkle of the ruoney, and it is
bred in human bones to love the beauty
and music of it. So when the robbers
sprang for their rifles they were dismayed
to tind the boy in possession of one. An
effort on the owner's part to snatch it from
the lad's hands only made the idiot leap
backward with Hashing eyes and bring the
weapon menacingly toward his shoulder.
Tom tried his old tactics of -wheedling
and play, but something in the boy had
gone awry â the excitement and turmoil,
the tiring of the rifles, the sheen and music !
of the coin and the possession o" a bright,
strong gun that felt heavy and substan
tial in his hands, had given his unor
ganized wits a distorted activity and tilled !
his blood with lire; and all that was what
wiser men than these might have ex
pected.
Tom's decision and action were prompt.
"Let the fool keep tiie gun," he mut
tered. "We must hurry."
THE BANDIT AND THE IDIOT FACE TO FACE.
They sprang forward with the money
and two rifles, but an uncanny cry behind
them made ttsem pause and look back.
The idiot was now terribly excited anil
was pursuing them. When they halted
he also came to a stand, and with a threat
in the holding of his rifle shouted:
"Money! I want money! Drop it. I
want it."
The case was serious, for every moment
was precious and there was a law that
made highway robbery a hanging crime.
.Jim, the mercurial one, ignoring the warn
ing and authority of his leader, dropped
his load of money and was in the act of
bringing up his rifio to shoot the lad, when
the incredible happened â his quicker an
tagonist disarmed him with a bullet in the
shoulder.
The three desperate men now realized
that they had an enemy more formidable
than the bravest order "of cautions sanity â
that most uncommon and terrible of
things, the angry madness of an idiot;
and every moment lost meant the nearer
approach of baying bloodhounds of the
law, with sharp eyes and noses and with
teeth that could inflict a fatal bite 500 yards
away.
Jim was not badly hurt. It was only a
slight flesh wound, but it gnawed him
with bitter pangs. Each of the three men
knew that the slightest movement to shoot
would be anticipated with a shot, and as
all were amazed to discover that the lad
could shoot at all and were ignorant of the
extent of his skill, to offer open battle
meant the probable death of one. And
they clearly saw that the idiot had an in
stinct of self-preservation. Worst of all,
he was absolutely devoid of fear; the gold
wine in his blood had made him lierce
and terrible. It was not a human beimr
that confronted them, but a ferocious
beast whose instinctive cunning was made
more potent by that substratum of the
human quality in which cunnine predom
inates.
Tom was a man of resources, but for a
while he was perplexed by the extra
ordinary character of the situation.
"Boys," said ho, "it's no use to fight.
The devil is in that grinning fool and he
has the drop on us. No more breaks like
| the one you made, Jim. Guns are useless
j here. Leave this case to me. Say, Luny,"
j called Tom, "what are you shooting for?
You want money? Plenty money. See!"
He held aloft the heavy bag which he car
ried and slowly poured its contents on the
I ground, whither the coins fell in aglistenine
stream, giving clattering evidence of their
impact. The boy laughed aloud and
moved to and fro with the stealth and soft-
I ness of a leopard.
"You, too, pour out!" he shouted to Jim
and Dick.
Rueful and wondering they complied,
after the leader had commanded them so
to do.
"Here it is, Luny," called the leader
"Come and it. We are going away.
Good-by, Limy. You're a good boy. I
want to play with you to-morrow."
The men then started to saunter indiffer
ently away, Torn and Jim taking their
rifles; but no.
"Drop 'era!" demanded the idiot. "I
want {runs."
"Let's ri r op 'em," said Tom under his
breath. "We have our knives left, and the
fool holds the drop on us."
They laid the rifles alongside the money,
and with jolly laughter and amusing
antics â an exercise led by Tom â they went
trippine away, the boy guffawing heartily
at their pranks. The men melted away
into the woods, and the idiot advanced,
alert and cautiou3 and carrying his rifle
ready ior action.
Thus he crept to the pile of money. His
slavering lips and retreating chin twitched
and writhed under the highest excitement
of which he was capable, and his eyes,
while s'.iil darting suspicious glances in
the direction of the spot where the men
had passed from view, were nevertheless
blazing with a greed for money.
'"Boys," said Tom when they had gone
beyond the idiot's hearing, "there are
only two thing? left. In a few minutes the
stage will reach the summit station, where
there is a telephone, and immediately
afterward hunting parties will leave every
town in the mountains within a radius of
twenty miles. It must be quick and des
perate work now, or everything is lost.
The two things that are left for us are
these: As we have nothing to shoot with
we must either slip round, get above the
fool and roll down a bowlder on him, and
take slim chances on its striking him, or
one of us must creep up and give him the
knife."
"And kill him?" asked Dick, the young
est man, in alarm.
"Nol quickly exclaimed the leader.
"Cripple Sim; if not with a knife, then
with a club; but a knife is better, because
to use a club you'll have to get arm-free
dom and so make a noise."
There was a touch of the ludicrous in the
helpless look of the two younger men, but
the face of the elder was dark and serious
and malignant.
"I'll atiend to the boy," he quietly said.
Ihe idiot was sitting on the ground, the
i across his legs and his hands engaged
laving in the beautiful pile of metal
\een his feet. He chuckled, gurgled,
>ned and crowed, and shouted a^ limes
, simple riot of pleasurable emotions,
dually his wariness relaxed, and with
Ã¼bsidence of the turmoil which had
kept his blood boiling came a more pas
sive mood and that desire for repose which
lety creates.
';e robbers had discovered the prudence
ike away the sacks which had held the
i, but the idiot, moved by that instinct
cquiaition which represented his herit
age of the ages, began to stow the treas
ure in his pockets. In order to do this he
had to sacrilice some of the queer odds and
ends which he had assemble-i thereâ such
as dtriims, bright stones, naiis and wild
nuts. This brought a struggle upon him.
Painfully he weighed these cherished pos
sessions against the sparkling gold and
silver, and with many a sigh relinquished
this string and that stone.
He discovered that with all the sacrifices
which he could make there was still insutii
cier.t room in his pockets for the money.
He could not bear to leavw a simile coin, so
entrancing was every one of them. It was
a long time before he hit upon the idea of
puiling out his shirt to use as an apron
and filling it with the plunder. But finally
ail this was done, and every coin had been
snugly provided for. When he attempted
to rise he discovered that the weight of the
money was too great for his strength.
Again and again did he essay the task,
straining his muscles to the last'limit and
groaning with the pains of his burden.
It was while he was thus struggling that
he suddenly became alert ami apprehen
sive again, and raised his head in a listen
ing attitude. He was very quiet, moving
not at all. A mental effort was going on
with slow and tedious progress, for the
passing of his excitement had reduced his
capacity for complex comprehension, and
his memory was at fault. Nevertheless,
something impelled him to look again
toward the spot where the robbers had
disappeared. Nothing alarming was
visible in that direction, for the simple
reason that he was facing it. The longer
he looked and the more keenly he listened
the sharper became his faculties and the
warmer his blood. Whatever it was that
finally roused him â whether it was a
crackling so slight that an ordinary ear
could not have heard it, or whether it was
an instinctive sense of danger â it were
profitless to inquire.
He looked quickly about, and directly
behind him, not ten feet away, were two
eyes in whose glance he recognized some
terrible menace. They were so near the
ground, and the meaning within them so
completely filled the field of view, that thÂ«
lad saw them only, and not the head that
held them, nor the creeping body that
lay stretched upon the ground behind
them, nor a bright knife which a strong
hand held so firmly.
He saw only the eyes, and they were
more terrifying than anything he had ever
seen before in all his crippled and stunted
life. He felt that they were something to
be killedâ a monstrous thing which had
no place in the presence of beautiful gold
and the gladsomeness of the morning.
With an almost imperceptible movement
his hand grasped the rifle, and with a re
lentless certainty he slowly turned as he
sat and brought the weapon to bear on the
eyes as it lay across his legs.
The face which held the eyes before him
blanched, and lines resembling those of
decrepitude came into it. No voice could
be useful here â except, perhaps, to hasten
ttie end of the tragedy. It must be abso
lute silence and immovability untii such
time as a hand should find its way to the
rifle's hammer and a finger slip through
the trigger-guard. After all, those things
might not happen if beaven or hell give
the prisoner strength to do nothing but
wait. Were the others observing? Did
they sec the terrible plight of their leader?
Would they do so rash a thing as seek to
save him by attempting to divert the
idiot's attention and so precipitate the
catastrophe? What wonderful things did
not come trooping out of the open door of
death and run riotously through the
bandit's head?
A clumsy thumb slowly felt along the
barrel for the hammer, and its oppos ; ng
forefinger as slowly crept along under
neath as it groped* for the trigger-guard.
The pallor in the prisoner's fa^t thereupon
became a dead gray, and as slowly and
surely as the idiot's thumb and forefinger
crept" along the rifle barrel, a sure, strong
bandit hand was taking firmer hold of a
knife, and powerful biceps were preparing
for a masterful effort. There was perfect
silence between these two â the idiot, who
was master, and the strong and competent
man, who was helpless â but no sound that
either could have made, no word that
either could have spoken, would have
been so terrible as this deadly communion
of silence between them.
It was a repeating-rifle that the idiot
held. He had already fired a shot from
it, and that had necessitated a throwing of
the lever to eject the empty shell. The
bandits had seen the idiot, perform that
feat with quick dexterity "when he had
shot one of them in the shoulder, and
knew that in doing so he had cocked the
weapon. The one ray of hope that now
shone in the* leader's "heart was that the
idiot had taken the precaution to let down
the hammer after they had left him. To
cock the weapon would require a second.
One second was ali that the robber needed.
With the bandit it was not now a matter
of disabling thu idiot with a knife-thrust
through the arm; it was a battle to the
death, and his stout heart must not quaver
under the suDerstition which had spared
the boy's life when he rirst intruded him
self. Nor could he for a moment permit
himself to calculate the distance which
his pursuers, sent forth hy the law to seek
his life, were lessening between themselves
and him. To kill this unspeakable
monster that hela his life on the touch
of a finger was the present necessity, the
only thing that could be thought of, the
one idea upon which he must concentrate
every faculty of his strong, clear mind.
The Interposition of t!ie boy's hand pre
vented a view of the ride's lock. Tins im
prisoned man could not see whether thÂ«
hammer was up or down. He could know
that fact only when he should see the
clumsy thumb begin to press on that
potent bit of crooked metal. Meanwhile
the grasp on the knife had- been made
sufficiently firm and the biceps were ready.
With incredible swiftness the rubber's
arm shot out, and a line, strong knifeâ one
of the kind mane to killâ went flying
through the air. It was a wonderful aim,
for it had been calculated seemingly
through incredible ages and had been
planned and judged for accuracy to the
thousandth part of an inch. So true was
it thai it found the boy's throat, through
which the knife passed till the guard was
pressed hard against the skin.
It was only the springing of a mine. In
another moment a bullet was plowing its
way through the robber's body, having en
tered his mouth; it was the blow of the
knife upon the idiot's neck that had
pressed the finger on the trigger; and the
robber, whatever else might have hap
pened, had indirectly given himself a
death wound.
The clattering of horses' hoofs and the
running of men to the scene of the tragedy
followed the duel so closely that the dying
highwayman's last words, issuing thickly
from his torn mouth, were indistinctly
heard :
"No man that ever murdered an idiot
since the world was born has stepped out
of this life with his boots off."
NOT FOR PRIVATE USES
Crushed Rock From Folsom Can

Bodies.
The Highways and Prison Commis
sions Settle Important Points
at a Joint Meeting.
A joint meeting of the State Board of
Prison Commissioners and the State Bu
reau of Public Highways was held at San
Qufntin prison yesterday. Prison Com
missioner De Pue presided.
The purpose of the meeting was to have
a thorough understanding of the law on
providing rock at Folf-om prison for pub
lic highway- 1 , to adopt measures looking
toward an approximate estimate of cost of
rock to counties and other public bodies,
and also to definitely settle as to whom
and under what conditions the rock mi^ht
be .sold and the cash obtained.
Marsden Manson, CIS., of San Fran
cisco; J. L. Maude, C.E., of Riverside and
R. E. Irvine of Sacramento, com prising
the Bureau of Highways, were present and
took an active part in the discussions,
which were of interest to the whole State.
.Mr. De Pue remarked that lie supposed
the first tiling necessary would be to de
fine the authority for using the broken
rock quarried a.t Folsom. He desired to
have that point determined so that no con
tractors could use the rock for private pur
poses.
Marsden Manson said: "A matter I re
gard as being very important is, what is
going to be the cost of the first half year's
production of rock? I'd rather we esti
mated a little over cost, because it would
be very difficult to get excess money back
if we estimated below cost; whereas, oth
erwise it would be an easy matter for us to
refund to contractors whatever small ex
cess there might be at the end of the six
months. We nave to operate and fix a
price as it goes out, and we want to avoid,
as far as possible, having counties owing
the State without any definite fund to pay
it from. We must cover the cost of pro
duction in the first half year and after that
we can very easily settle small differences."
"The cost at the start is going to be far
in excess of further operations/ replied
Warden Aull. "Say 250 cubic yards at first
would cost as much as 500 later on. I can't
say what the cost will be."
Manson announced that Sacramento city
and county, Stockton, San Joaquin and
the State* Capitol Commissioners were
ready to take enormous quantities of the
rock for roads.
A discussion ensued as to what limita
tions should be placed on the sale of the
rock so as to keep within the law, and it
ended in theadoption of the following com
posite resolution, presented by Director
Devlin:
Reaolved, That highway "metal" shall be sold
only when to he used on public highways, end
that every contractor doing public work shall
be allowed to purchase on certificate to tnat
effect, from the proper public authorities, at
prices to be hereafter fixed, all rock to be paid
for before being shipped.
Maude moved that Warden Aull of Fol
som be instructed to estimate the approxi
mate cost of crushed rock for the first
three months and report thirty days be
fore operations begin. Aull replied that
he would do as desired, but would cer
tainly make out an under-estimate for the
meeting in Feoruary at Folsoru.
It was stated that all money received
from the sale of rock must be paid to
Aull.

A EUROPEAN WAR.
The annual announcement of an im
pending war in Europe is like the cry of
"wolf" by the boy in the fable. For a dec
ade or more it has been regularly revived
during that period of the year when the ar
mies are in winter quarters and when an ac
tive campaign, in Northern Europe,at least,
would be impractical. In view of this oft
repeated prophecy of an event which does
not occur, many persons who have never
analyzed Old World conditions are of the
opinion that the peace of Europe will
not again be disturbed, and that the re
currii.g war scare is nothing more than
newspaper talk.
it is to be noted, however, that as there
was a wolf in the fable so there is also a
wolf in European affairs, and that sooner
or later it will break from its copses with
either war or revolution in its burning
eyes.
It is impossible to suppose in reason that
the existing conditions and institutions of
Europe can much longer endure. Look
for an example to the Germany of to-day.
With a population of about 47,000.000, it
has a regular standing army of 500,000
men, and in addition to this a
body of civilian soldiers of 2,500,
--000 more. It costs the enormous sum
of $165,000,000 annually to support this
army, and this, with the vast and
increasing expenses of the imperial Gov
ernment, swells the burden of taxation
upon the producers and property-owners
of the empire to a degree which Americans
can hardly realize. According to the con
sular reports from Germany the annual
tax rate in that country exceeds 20 per
cent of the assessed valuation of its prop
erty.
If this be true it follows that even,' five
years the Government of Germany absorbs
the entire wealth of its people in taxes.
This of itself is a condition which cannot
continue long. It is also one which affects
Italy, Austria, Turkey and France to an
almost equal degree.
Take another view of Germany as an ex
ample of conditions in Europe. Behold
her young Emperor engaged in the vain
endeavor to convoke a Cabinet which
shall repulse the assaults of the op
position long enough to inaugurate
a policy. Of what elements is this opposi
tion composed? Mainly of the several
schools of German socialists, whose
aim is the overthrow of imperialism.
These elements Bismarck was able
to keep divided Dy the exercise
of his powerful genius in statecraft and
by casting to this faction and then to that
the sop of a seeming accession to their
demamis. But the genius of Bismarck
is lost to the Government of to
day, and as a natural result the em
pire which his ability upreared for
the Hohenzollerns is in danger of an
eruption of its own internal discontent.
This condition also affects the other
nations of Europe, in every one of which
there is a growing sense of equality among
men and increasing hatred of caste.
With these two elements in European
society it is not surprising that either war
or revolution must speedily occur. The
surprising thing b that one or the other
has not happened before. It is now more
than a quarter of a century since Europe
has had a serious war. This long
period of peace has been due to conditions
which have ceased to exist, and to the
genius of statesmen who have passed from
the stage of action. In the meantime the
increase of standing armies, composed
of men whose trade is war and who
demand it as their opportunity for glory,
and of the forces of socialism and discon
tent, made up of those who have every
thing to gain and nothing to lose by either
war or revolution, place a near limit to the
period of peace.
Every sign of the times points with un
varying finger to the certainty of Europe's
entrance noon the new century in a state
of disturbance not unlike that with which it
began the present one, and with results
ahead which are as difficult of forecast
now as then.
HELP SAN FRANCISCO.
The Fresno Republican calls attention to
the fact that while San Francisco is mak
ing a lijrht against the influence of the
aided railroad? in Congress to secure the
passage of a funding bill the people of the
interior are content to applaud the effort
and rest at that. "Our inactivity, 1 ' says
our contemporary, "is the more surprising
because we .so expressly recognize the im
portance to the coast of a right decision of
the matter, such a decision as will not be
secured by the lobbyists of C. P. Hunting
ton. If our bondage to the Pacific roads is
renewed some part of the blame will attach
to ourselves."
This article was published before the call
of Mayors to appoint delegates from all
the cities and towns of the State to a
meeting in San Francisco for the purpose
of drafting a memorial to Congress pray
ing that the railroad debt be not funded or
otherwise extended. The scope of this
ca'.l has been very properly widened to in
clude the chairmen of the Boards of Super
visors throughout the State, Â«o that the
two main interests at slakeâ the business
men and consumers of thecitiesand towns
as represented by municipal boards and
the producers as represented by the Boards
of Supervisorsâ will have an opportunity
to express themselves and present a pe
tition which Congress cannot ignore.
Hence, the interior of the State will now
have an opportunity to act upon this sug
gestion contained in the Republican's edi
torial: "If the San Francisco organization
which is attempting to combat a funding
bill will practically and directly appeal to
the interior of tho State for moral and
financial assistance it will receive it. The
wisdom of Buch a course must be manifest
to anybody. * * * California should be
as united in action in this matter as it is
in feeling. Congress should not be per
mitted to flatter itself that San Francisco
is alone in opposition to any funding bill
that may be devised."
The convention is to be held next Satur
day at Metropolitan Hall in this City. It
will be one of the most important as
semblages of representative citizens of
California ever brought together under
one roof. It will be a struggle for life, and
every patriotic resident of the State and
every citizen who has the intelligence to
know that his own welfare is at stake wili
lend his strongest linancial and moral sup
port to its success.
A BRIGHT RECORD,
J. A. Filcher, manager of the California
State Board of Trade, sends just such an
account of California's victories at the
Atlanta Exposition as might have been
expected. Although the diplomas have
not yet ail been made out, and Mr. Filcher
is therefore unable to send a complete
list of the California winners of prizes, he
does say that California thus far has taken
about seventy-live prizes; that this is at
least three times as many as any other
State has won; that about half of these
are first premiums (gold medals), and that
the number of prizes will undoubtedly be
increased to a hundred before the fair
closes.
It is pleasant to hear from him that the
California exhibit is already known as the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 1896.
"gold-medal corner," and that the free
exhibitions of California fruit-cooking
have made it necessary for the merchants
of Atlanta to carry a stock of California
dried fruits to supply the demand which
these exhibitions have created. This is
worth fully as much to the State as any
number of gold medals that may be won
by private exhibitors, and it indicates one
of the lines along which the extension of
our market can be profitably followed.
It is encouraging to learn that Florida
orange-growers, after seeing the California
exhibit, decided not to enter their prod
ucts. Still, it had been already learned
that the climate of Florida is not suffi
ciently reliable to make oranee-growing a
perfectly safe occupation there.
It is to be noted in this connection that
there is on foot a movement to expand the
exhibit of the California State Board of
Trade by taking more extensive quarters
and incorporating exhibits ol valuable
products of the entire Pacific Coast and
even the Hawaiian Islands. This would
make a permanent exposition of great
magnitude and interest, and it is to be
hoped that the suggestion will not be al
lowed to slumber.
A HEALTH RESORT.
If all Americans possessed th* order of
intelligence which Enoch Knight has dis
played in a contribution to the Christian
Register, published at Boston, there would
be less eager search for elusive specifier
for consumption. Mr. Knight shows that
there i 9 one spot in the world where nature,
under pleasant circumstances, offers a
stronger hope for benefit or cure than the
laboratory of the scientist. This is what
he terms the rim of the Colorado DeÃert, in
Southern California.
"If one were to go among the ranches of
New Mexico and see," he writes, "as one
must see, the prevalence of catarrh, actu
ally developed by the terrible winds, the
blinding alkaline dust and the almost
lightning changes of temperature, one
would at least be prepared to act conserva
tively, if not to leave that region entirely
out of account. There are beautiful re
gions of country and seasors of perfect
weather 'east of the mountains,' but there
is no all-the-year and out-of-doors equal to
that found in the rim of the Colorado
Desert and the region westward to the sea,
as it is respectively opened by the San
Gorgonio Pass, with Los Angeles as the
base and center. It is here that one can
find equableness and dryness, with almost
complete immunity from what may be
called 'rough' weather."
He shows that at Indio, a railroad station
out on the arid and barren plain 3, there is
an annual rainfall of only three inches.
This means practically uninterrupted sun
shine throughout the year, as fogs are un
known. It means further an extreme ab
sence of humidity, and the value of this is
appreciated when it is reflected that no
germs can thrive in a perfectly dry atmos
phere. That is why typhoid fever, diph
theria, malaria and zymotic and endemic
diseases generally are impossible in that
semi-desert region. Furthermore, as the
country is several hundred feet below the
level of the sea, breathine is easier there
than anywhere else in the world. This
relieves the lunes of an effort and a strain
that impair the value of the high plateau
of Colorado and New Mexico.
While regarding this rim as the greatest
boon that nature ha? provided for phthis
ical sufferers Mr. Knight urces against the
plan of establishing sanitariums, where
the patients shall be herded and thus de
pressed by contact. In that wonderful
climate, where, as he truly says, "one can
bask, if not actually bake, in the sun the
winter long," and where ' the sunshine is
as faithful as is the unvarying west wind,
which week after week and month after
month brings over mesa and mountains
the sweet breath of the octan," it is essen
tial that the benefits of outdoor freedom
be enjoyed to the fullest extent.
If one prefers a slightly stronger touch
of the ocean, a little higher altitude and
immediate contact with beautiful farms,
orchards and vineyards, one may go into
the pretty canyons of the San Jacinto
Mountains, which open upon the desert.
Palm Springs is one of these places, and it
has the advantage of hot medicinal springs.
Even at Indio, which is planted in the
heart of a blind desolation, water has trans
formed the desolation into a garden of re
freshing verdure planted by human hands.
The time must inevitably come when the
wonders of this strange region, in its
power to restore health while offering the
pieasantest conditions of life, will be bmer
understood and the sufferings of humanity
diminished in proportion to the extension
of this knowledge.
WHAT TIME WILL BRING.
Those who cannot read the destiny of
Pan Francisco in the unalteraDle condi
tions which assure its coming greatness
must lack the understanding to make an
effort to secure that result. As the his
tories of cities go, San i lancisco was born
but yesterday, and unlike any other Amer
ican city of rapid growth it has developed
its present importance solely by the irre
pressible force of natural advantages
which have operated with the certainty of
fate againet purely artificial hindrances.
These are too familiar to Californians to
require enumeration here. It is sufficient
to say that no manifestation of human
stupidity, greed or indolence can check
the onward march of this Western metrop-
olis, and it is still more encouraging to see
that even these obstacles to advancement
are disappearing tinder an awakenine
sense of duty and a better appreciation of
opportunity.
The geographical situation of the City
comprises an extraordinary combination
of favorable circumstances. Its back
country is surpassingly rich in agricultur
al land?, precious metals, lumber and all
the other great essentials of community
wealth; these are not developed to a hun
dretb part of their capacity. Much of this
region is accessible by waterways which
are not made available for transportation.
The outward view shows a frontage on the
Pacific Ocean and favoring winds and
ocean currents that invite navigation. The
physical conditions of the City have for
their chief feature a climate which is not
only pleasant but which conduces to
health, vigor and adventure.
Of equal value with these advantages is
the peculiar fact that the City can never
have a. rival. Railroads have caused it to
lose the trade both of the north and the
south, but a thousand such facilities could
not annul the remarkable advantages
which are centered in this spot. Railroads
may produce a wonderfully rapid erowth,
as they have done in the case of Chicago,
Minneapolis, St. Paul and some other
Western cities, but a great ocean and a
matchless harbor have an influence, and,
assisted by natural inland waterways and a
climate which makes possible the produc
tion of expensive articles of consumption
grown nowhere else in so great variety and
abundance, must exert an influence that
will have a cumulative force in the passing
of the years and that in the end will make
of San Francisco one of tho greater cities
of the world.
A preat hindrance to development is its
distance from the populous centers of the
world. What is termed "the bridge" lies
between us and the millions of our breth
ren who live on the other side of the con
tinent and who are eager to buy what we
produce; but in time this bridge, by means
of irrigation and settlement, will become
a highway lined with thrifty people, and
that problem will be solved. Long before
that will have happened our own broad
acres will be filled with a happy popula
tion enjoying life while accumulating a
competency and all contributing to the
greatness of their metropolis at the Golden
Gate.
POETRY AND EOSES.
It has been proposed to have a poetess
instead of a queen to preside over the com
ing festival of roses in San Jose, and the
proposal is worthy of serious considera
tion. It suggests possibilities of lifting the
annual festival at San Jose to a unique
position among the carnivals of the State,
and if the proposal is undertaken in the
right spirit and carried out in the right
way it may result in adding to the festival
a feature of extraordinary interest.
It is a well-known theory of Wagner
that music, painting and poetry have each
been carried to the highest plane they can
attain separately, and that if the art of the
future is to transcend that of the past it
must seek to do so by combining the three
arts into one and raising that to the
superlative degree. Wagner soueht to
achieve this in his operas, and in the com
position of them gave as much attention
to the poetry they expressed and to the
beauty of the scenic effects as he did to
tho music itself. A Wagnerian opera
therefore is a combination of all the arts,
and there can be no doubt that much of
the prestige of these operas is due to the
skill with which the combination was
effected.
Our floral festivals have ignored the wis
dom of this maxim of the innovator of the
opera of our time. They have sought to
please by one art alone. All energies have
been directed solely to tne production of
scenic effects. Music and poetry have
been set aside in order that exclusive at
tention might be given to artistic accom
plishments of form and color. Great suc
cess has been undoubtedly gained in that
way. The beauty and the multitude of our
flowers have sufficed to produce wonderful
pageants and brilliant pavilions, and
when united with the glow of ribbons and
the blaze of fireworks the triumphs at
tained have been almost infinite in their
variety. It seems certain, however, that
much could be added to the delight of
even the most successful of these festivals
if all the glory of their colors and the
splendor of their beauty were interfused
with the glowing sentiments of poesy and
the raptures of music.
If San Jose undertakes to introduce the
element of poetic competition into her fes
tival of roses she will not be without
models on which to fashion her work.
Many of the medieval festivals of Italy
and Southern France were blended floral
fetes and contests of poets and musicians.
Such a festival continues to this day in
Provence. Readers of "Corinne" will
recall the triumph of that heroine on such
an occasion at Rome. These old models
could not be closely followed, of course,
with any success, for we are a different
people, with different customs; but still
we mieht profit by them as fully as we do
by Venetian pageants in arranging the
spectacular portions of our festivals.

A PASTOR AT SIXTEEN.
Brooklyn never has done justice to her in
fant ministerial phenomenon. He is Henry
Banta, aged lti, of 227 Nineteenth streei.
Young &s he is, Master Ranta Is settled over a
church, has a parsonage and draws a man's
salary, fays the New York Press. He is spend
ing the winter in Brooklyn, because his home
is there.
Four years npo, after spending several
mouths in Seney Hospital, he went South with
nis tether, the Bar. Charles Bnnta, a traveling
evangelist. Young Banta was taken along in
the hope that the change of air might bent-fit
him. While attending one of his lather's re-
Henry Banta.
vival services in a small backwoods Ohio town
he became converted. He began almost imme
diately to preach.
â¢'First I used to exhort from my seat In the
audience." he said. "I gave my testimony.
Then father had me read a chapter in the
Bible, and allowed me to make a few remarks
on the passages that particularly impressed
me. He would follow with the main address
or exhortation. In a few weeks I found lny
self preaching to audiences that I had never
seen before, and I have been preaching almost
continuously ever since. A year ago I preached
in New York, Brooklyn and Jersey City. In
Jersey City the meetings were largely attended f
and many, very many, seemed to feel the love
of God for the first time."
When young Banta went South last spring
on an evangelistic tour the Methodist church
of Shalotte. N. C, was so taken with hispreaeh
lng that he was asked to remain permanently
with the church. After considering the offer a
few months Banta accepted. He preached in
Shalotte three months and from all accoums
Kay? good satisfaction. The demands of regu
lar parish work, the necessity of preachim; n>
terc-'tingly to the same congregation twice a
week soon showed him that he lacked the
qualifications of a regular pastor aud he has
come North to flt himself for the ministry.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Sam Rainey, the gentleman who has a fond
ness for the Fire Department because be was
brought up in the atmosphere of the engine
house on Bush street, is a philosopher,
ever, if he is nothing else.
Mr. Rainey seldom opens his head unless he
says something worth hearing, but on the
other hand it must not be forgotten that Mr.
Rainey knows when not to open his head, not
withstanding the fact that he might say some
thing pleasing to the ear if ho wibhed to.
While Mr. Rainey is not the author of that
famous expression "The people be ," he is
nevertheless responsible for the epigram ad
dressed to a newspaper man, "If you want to
kill a politician don't mention his name and
he will mildew and get off the earth."
In fact, for a man who does not pretend to be
a Solomon, Mr. Rainey says some very peart
things.
"I used to be inspector of the apparatus of
SAM RAIN'EY, PHILOSOPHER.
[Sketched by a "CalV artist. J
! the Fire Department," said Mr. Rainey yester
day, as ho blew a cloud ol smoke through the
interstices of his Stubby mustache, "when the
, Grand Jury found it a pastime to investigate
! us every six months. No matter whether there
was anything in the wind or not that body of
citizens would haul the Fire Department up
I for a scoring. Of course, under the circum
â  stances, we were our own witnesses and stood
i right up to the music, swearing that every
! tiling was nil rightâ and it was." The speaker
j thrust another load of smoke out of his face
j and continued: "One day Lyons, the depart
j ment drayman, came to me and we talked of
j the frequency with which the Grand Jury used
I to reflect upon our honesty. Lyons was a very
thoughtful niftn.anii looked further ahead than
I was accustomed to. He reviewed the num-
b erless times we had been maligned by the
; Grand Jury and recalled the occasions on
which we hnd proven our innocence. He rev
eled in the fact that our reputations were as
! yet untarnished by proof, and altogether he
i seemed very well satisfied with the condition
: of things.
" When we had finished conversing of the mis
takes of the Grand Jury he laid his hands on
my shoulder, and with a thoughtful expression
on his face said:
" 'Sam, if we should ever get out of the Fire
: Department it would be impossible for us to do
! it any harni?'
" 'Why so. Lyons?' I asked.
" 'Well, fam, I'll tell you. It is because we
have sworn so many times that the department
is dead straight and Bquare.' "

Francisco is his home and it is his delight to
be. here. The Lambs' Club is a joyful place, but
Barton's allegiance to the Owl never falters.
Speaking of songs at the Bohemian Club yes
terday Mr. Barton replying to questions gald:
" 'Kazzle Dazzle' made a great hit and was in
considerable demand for a time, but it has not
maintained the steady favor which has been
accorded to 'Imogene Donahue.' Yes, 'The'
Knights of the Gold-i'lated Hod' and
'Rachel Rosenheimer' are still sung, but
'Donahue' sells batter than any other song of
my composition. This thing of writing songa
is only an incident. When I found that the
songs were profitable I protected my interests
by copywright and have derived quite a sum of
money as the result.
"I am now interested most in shipping to
Eastern cities refined asphaltum from the vast
bids near Santa Barbara. It is the best paving
material in the world, even superior to that
which comes from the Island of Trinidnd. It
is extensively used in Xew York, Brooklyn,
Utica and Syracuse, and is bound to become
popular in other cities. We Bend East the re

North, the Water Purveyor of Xew York, as
serts that it la the best paving material in the
world. We come into competition with the
product from Trinidad, but are able to meet it.
In New York we lay two and a half Inches of
asphalt on a concrete foundation of six inches,
and the pavement is guaranteed jo last for
fifteen years.
"rian Francisco," remarked Mr, Barton, j
"should be the best-paved city in the world, ;
but it is one of the worst. Whoever heard of a ;
pavement being guaranteed to last for any
length of time in this city ? In the East guar
antees are exacted, and the lowest limit of
time is five years. For the New York pave
ments all the oils and moisture of the material
are extracted and the composition is put on at !
a temw rature of 226 degrees. With this care j
in construction and reasonable diligence in !
keeping the street in repair the pavement will ;
last for fifty years.
"People in California do notcomprehend the i
value of the vast deposits of asphaltum in this â 
State and do not appreciate the excellence of !
the article. One bed in Santa Barbara covers
an area of 35.000 acres, yet the world-famed
deposit on the island of Trinidad embraces
only 118 acreÃ. In freignts we can hold our
own. Of course, wo ship only the refined arti

The country is not depicted as a para
dise. In describing the arrival of Miss
Tretfaskiss at a new town at the end of a
railway line, it ia laid :
Sh e looked out on a dusty road bordered by
tine houses with patches ot brown grass end
here and there a parched gldla tree between

to the eye, which found relief only in a
green passion vine, or native cucumber, strug

The zizrc buildings rev.' out cruel diamond

buildings were public-houses. Fifteen there

"1 want sympathy. I wish soul, (spirit, intellect
to come and surround me. And there is
nothingâ nothing, but coarse, cruel flesh and

scenes of life remote from civilization.
The picture given of Australian life is not
wholly attractive, and yet it has charms
for those who like freedom and adven
ture. It was not the right environment
for Mr-. Tregaskiss and she came near to
making a wreck of her life before she es
caped it. Mrs. Campbell-Praed, however,
was kind to her heroine, and after many
sorrows closed her career in Australia by
giving her a legacy of Â£20.000 and allowing
her to return to England with her hus
band, thoroughly reformed.

uses of the party to whom it was ad

INDIAN LEGENDS.
"The Siwash ; Life, Tales, and Legends
of Puget Sound and the Pacific North
west," is the title of a volume just issued
by the Calvert Publishing Company, Seat
tle, Wash. If, is in paper covers, 170 pages,
and is fully illustrated. The editor. J. A.
Costello, is a Seattle journalist, and his
excuse for the book is that "it is the first
attempt to depict the life or ethnology of
the maze of Indian tribes on Pusret
Sound." Mr. Costello's aim, he declares,
was to attain as nearly us possible the
facts in every instance, in order that read
ers might arrive at a proper understand
ing of fche natives of that country, as they
were found by the first whites to arrive.
Much of the work is a compilation of his
torical and other matter. The material
was largely drawn from old pioneers and
the more intelligent natives, and as oppor
tunities for obtaining such matter will not
last many years longer, the editor and
compiler hopes that his volume will find a
welcome place in the homes of the country
where the Siwash once nourished. Many
of the tales and legends remind one of bits
of Greek mythology.
The volume on the whole is interesting.
The Indians are gradually disappearing
and it seems deplorable that so little is to
day known, in a literary sense, concerning
the aboriginals of the great West. This
book, undoubtedly, rescues many tales
from what would otherwise be certain ob-
I livion. An age or two hence the Indian
; himself 'will be a story of other times. Mr.
Costello is entitled to credit for his ser-
I vices in assuring the preservation of these
tales and legends.
The legend of "The Thunder-bird" is one
â  of the many that, Mr. Costello has col
lected. Thai legend, which he brielly re
lates, has been put into experimental
verge by the reviewer and the result is
i given below. It is substantially faithful
to the original story whatever literary de
; fects it may have. "The Thunder-bird"
' may be set down as a fair example of the
Siwash myth. And here it 1?, with apolo

â¢'THE ONE WHO LOOKED ON."
After the ordinary novels of exaggerated
emotions told with tho straining ior effect
that 'tears passion to tatters," it is pleas
ant to come upon some story of quiet life,
having within it suggestions of deep and
true feeling. Such is the story told in
"The One Who Looked On." Nothing
could be more simple than the structure of
the tale. It is merely tho narrative of the
unfolding of the character of an excep
tionally strong man, who beneath a man
ner of cold reserve conceals the emotions,
but does not stifle the current, of a warm
and noble disposition.
The characters are few and the incidents
are in no respect extraordinary. The
whole interest of the work lies in the man-
ne r in whichÂ»the real nature of the hero is
developed and becomes clear to a youn-Â»
trirl who tells the course of his love and is
"The one who looked on." The style, in
harmony with the narrative, has the charm
of a graceful simplicity and eives the book
a literary value much above the standard
of the average novel of the day. ["The

In '"Cension" Maude Mason Adams
has given us a simple love tale and sketch
of ranch life near Paso del Norte. 'Cen
sion, the young daughter of a wealthy and
easy-going rancher, is passionately in love
with Eduardo Lenna, a boid, handsome
man of 38. She is simple, pu re, trustful,
beautiful, in direct contrast to the man on
whom she bestows her love. He is a liar,
thief and hypocrite, and cares for 'Cension
only as he would for an exquisite wild
flower, to be plucked, scented and trampled
in the dust. Eduardo is thought to have
another love, and one night 'Cension goes,
accompanied only by her dog, to a dance
hall in Del Norte to see her rival. Eduardo
explains his falseness away very glibly;
but his evil suggestions glance from the
girl as from shining armor, and in the end
her brother saves her from the villain's
wiles by proving him to be a robber, de
serter of wife and children and would-be
murderer. There are some striking scenes
in the tale, which is well illustrated. [Pub

Haggard's "Heart of the World" a "gor
geously readable book," but before doing
so remarks that "Mr. Hagpard conscien
tiously misspells two-thirds of the Spanish
words he uses, and misuses a fair share of
the rest, and this is his least blunder."
Stanley J. Weyman, whose "Red Cock
ade" has been one of the most successful
of recent novels, has given up his inten
tion of taking a lone rest, and is at work
on a new historical romance. "VYeyman is
a very careful workman and frequently
spends a week in constructing and writing
a chapter.
Richard Henry Rtoddard is of the
opinion that the well-bred persons in Wil
liam Biack's serial "Uriseis," now appear
ing in Harper's Magazine, are a welcome
addition to the characters of fiction. The
tale itself moves as blithely as a holiday
pageant and is in pleasant contrast to the
morbid literature that iilis so many book
covers at the present day.
Helen Mathers wrote her novel, "Comin'
Thro' the Rye," in a bit of pique. Her
father, who was a strict disciplinarian, de
nied her some cherished wish, and she
paid him off by depicting the family mar
tinet in her book. She was greatly sur
prised when her novel was accepted by the
publishers, and went about in an agony of
fear lest her father should discover the
author.
A striking contribution to the literature
of the new year will be that of Slatin
Pasha. Before the Mahdi's victories in
the Sondan he was Governor of Darfur
and in command of large military iorces.
He fought twenty-seven pitched battles
before surrendering and has given a vivid
account of them. He was present, during
the siege of Khartoum, and to his feet
Gordon's head was brought within an
hour of the city's fall. "Fire and Sword
in the Soudan" will be illustrated with
maps and thirty-two engravings.
In his new "Recollections of Napoleon
Til," Sir William Fraser says that the
Kmperor looked like a sick eagfe â "his eyes
small and not at all prominent, his head
held slightly at one side, an appearance
of abstraction about him." His chief re
semblance to the Bonaparte family
was in his back. One good saying
of the Emperor is recorded. When
Nicholas I of Russia congratulated him
on coming to the throne, he addressed
him as "my friend" instead of "my
brother," the usual royal phrase. "This
is most flattering," said the Emperor.
"We choose our friends ; we cannot choose
our relatives."
Dean Hole's book giving his impressions
of this country, just out, contains some
curious inaccuracies. He says, for in
stance, that in prohibition towns liquor is
generally dispensed in teapots, and
tells about a guest in a hotel who,
upon calling for something to drink,
was told by the landlord: "You
will find a little tap near your dressing
table in your room, 'which will put you in
communication with the old rye, and you
can take what you please for yourself and
your friends, as there is a meter on the
other side of the wall." It cannot be sup
posed that this was a persona! experience
of the good dean, and it looks, therefore,
as if some wag had been "stuffing" him.
It is not too much to say that "The
Traveler" of San Francisco is one of the
handsomest journals published in this
country. The January number appears
with a photograph in colors as a frontis
piece, giving a graphic picture of the vol
cano of Kilauea at the Hawaiian Islands.
Chief among the contents is an entertain
ing sketch on palmistry, with illustrations,
by Jane Seymour Klink; Arthur Inkers
ley contributes a bright sketch, giving an
account of his experience at Oxford; W.
: V. Bryan has a two-page article on the
} luxuries of mountain railways; Santa Bar
j baia, by H. Edwards, ia quite a unique
I sketch, and Mrs. K. S. Marshall contrib-
utes an article on San Leandro Lake, giv
ing an account of the great water supply
system through a large part of Alameda
County.
Dr. William L. Phelps of Yale announces
that the novels which he will discuss in
his popular course on popular fiction dur
ing this year include the following books:
"The Children of the World," by Heyse;
"Dame Care," by Sudermann; "A House
of Gentlefolk" ("Liza"), by Turgenev;
"Fathers and Sons," by Turgenev; "Anna
Karenina," by Tolstoy; "Where Love Is
There God Is Also," by Tolstoy; "Pan
Michael," by Sienkiewiez: "Synnove Sol
bakken," by Bjornson ; "In God's Way,"
by Bjornson; "'Jack," by Daudet; "An
Iceland Fisherman," by Loti; "The Crime
of Sylvester Bonnard," by France. In this
list most of the modern schools and kinds
of fiction are represented, in so far, at
least, as foreign writers are concerned. In
the course of the term Dr. Phelps will also
lecture on Ibsen and his influence on the
novel.

REV. MR. KING'S SCHEME
Will Establish a Great Co-oper
ative System in This
City.
Business Houses of all Kinds Will Be
Started in the Near Future.
His Plans.
Rev. Francis King, a minister who re
cently arrived in this City from the East,
is making preparations to launch a co
operative scheme, the like of which has
never before been established in the San
Francisco community.
Rev. Mr. King has long been a student
of social conditions as they exist, and be
lieves that the time is ripe for a plan to
unite the efforts of men for their common
good. He believes that the co-operative
plans of the past, many of which have
been auspiciously launched only to be
wrecked on the rocks of discord, have
failed because the projectors or those who
embarked in the schemes did not stick to
their original plans, but allowed them
selves to be drawn into side issues that
eventually brought dissensions into the
ranks and finally broueht their efforts to
naught.
"To make a co-operative plan a success,"
he said yesterday, "those who undertake
it must first fix upon a feasible plan, allow
those who are shown to have the most
executive ability to direct their efforts and
then follow the direction first taken to the
last extent.
"The plan we are now working on is
different from any that has yet been tried
in this City, but weâ that'is, those who
have signified their intention of joining
the association now forming â have nu
doubt of its ultimate success. We shall
begin in a small way, say with 100 mem
bers, and gradually, as the machinery gets
into working order, more will be taken in.
The lirst hundred members will appoint a
committee to formulate a constitution and
by-laws which will provide for the election
of a president and other officers. The
plans of the association differ materially
from those of the Labor Exchange in
many particulars, chief among them being
that money will cut a very important
ligure in the scheme.
"Without funds we can do nothing, and
our first efforts will be devoted to raising
these iunds. The first hundred members
will pay for some time monthly dues into
the treasury.
"Some have agreed to pay ?1 per month,
others $5 per month, and so on. When suf
ficient money has been collected to begin
operations, one business house will be es
tablished. It may be a tailoring establish
ment, a shoe factoiy or any other business
which the members elect.
"It is acknowledged by all that by the co
operative system cheaper and better re
sults can be obtained than by individuals,
so that all things being equal it should do
as well as any other business of the kind.
"Here is where the membership of the
association will come in. Each member
will be pledged to patronize the business
started by the association ana to induce
his friends and business associates to do
the same. As the membership of the as
sociation increases the patronage of the
business^will enlarge, and it is hoped to
have it on a paying basis in a short time.
"Then members who are expert in some
other line will be selected to start some
other business on ttie same lines, the
monthly dues aiding to push the now es
tablishment along until it can stand on its
own legs. We hope eventually to estab
lish a gigantic system by which all our
members can live getting the maximum
wage for the minimum of labor and pro
ducing such goods as will be to tne great
est beneiit to all. By adhering strictly to
the plan as outlined we are sure of ulti
mate success.
"Of course it will take men of executive
ability to direct the affairs of the concern,
but we already have many men of good
.-tunuingand ousmess sense interested and
DO difficulty will be experienced in this di
rection. We will soon begin to hold meet
ings on the matter, and once organized the
association will make rapid progress."

'. NEW TO-PAT.
STARVED.
STOMACH RUINED AND MEMORY GONE.
Caused by Using 8421 Plugs of Tobacco.
A. T. r.mlil. Druggist, of Arnprior,
Ont., Reports This "Wonder-
ful Case.
Man does a lot of foolish things, and
when you come to look them all over, the
continued use of tobacco is, without doubt,
the most unaccountable of them all.
Tobacco kills more people than all the
contagious diseases together.
We don't know it, or don't want to ad-
mit it, but it's so. Not one man in ten
would get sick so easily and die from
catarrh, consumption, pneumonia, heart
disease, etc., if his otherwise strong con-
stitution were not undermined by tobacco
poison.
It's so easy to eet started and so impos-
sible to stop tobacco use, unless Xo-To-
Bac comes 10 the rescue. Millions are
now seeking relief, and they are coming
from all parts of the world. Read this let-
ter:
He Now Can Eat.
Arnprior, Ont., Sept. 20, 1895.
A. T. Budd Esq., Druggist, Arnprior,
Ont. â Dear Sir: I have used No-To-Bac
and found it a complete cure. 1 had
smoked and chewed for 20 years. I had
used a 10-cent plug of chewing tobacco
every day, as weil as three plugs of smok-
ing a week. My doctor told me that to-
bacco was killinc me, and I tried to quit
of my own accord, but could not exist
without it. After using three boxes of No-
To-Bac lam completely cured. My nerves
were a complete wreck, but now my nerves
never trouble me. For many years I
could not eat any breakfast, my stomach
was in such a bad condition. Now I can
eat as well as any one, and have gained
considerable in weight, and am better
physically and mentally than ever before,
and I can highly recommend No-To-Bac
as a complete cure.

THE Tavary Grand Opera Com
pany will come as a boon and a
blessing to people who care for
something more musicianly than
â¢The New Rally,' or "I Don't
TV ant to Play in Your Yard,' 1 but a glance
over the published repertory arouses a feel
ing of sorrow that though Charles Pratt
eeems to hove been enterprising in securing
additional artists, not one novelty in the way
of new operas is announced. In fact, for
the most part, he only promises us the
same eld list of works that have lulled our
ears from childhood up, the works we
pounded out as "fantasias" when wo were
learning the piano, the works halicwed by
youthful memories of hand-organs, and,
worst of all, the works we have heard all
the Pattis "in herba" of our acquaintances
"sing" ( ?) ever since we can remember any
thing.
The dear old "Sonnambula," for in
stance. Her sleepwalking act thrilled our
mothers and grandmothers, but that was
before Richard Wagner introduced the
fashion of having plots to oper.is. "The
Old Girl" as Balfe used to call her, is also
on Mr. Pratt's list and among the other
ancient and familiar friends are "Martha,"
"The Travinta." '"The Jewess" and
"L'Africaine." The composer of the last
work is also to be remembered hy "Les
Huguenot?, 1 ' and Verdi is also represented
by "II Trovatore." "Iligoletto" and
"Aida."' Rossini bobs up serenely with
"William Tell" and â but why go
through the list? The above-mentioned
works give an index to the whole of the
repertory, unless indeed the saving clause
"and others,"' which ends the category,
contains a promise that we are to hear
come of the novelties of the last few years.
This is an age of opera-writinsr. Europe
is constantly deluged with new works,
some of them of great merit ; but in Fan
Francisco we have heard nothing of all the
modern successes but the "Cavalleria Rus
ticana' and ''I Pagliacpt."
Mascagoi and Leoncavallo have both
written voluminously since those first pro
ductions, but so far a3 we are concerned
they might have been mute. The Zola-
Bruneau opera, "L'Attaque dv Moulin,"
has been on the boards for a couple of
years, and the more the critics hear it the
more they say it will live when we are all
dead ; but that is no reason why we should
die without hearing it. "Hansel and Gre
tel" is an extraordinarily successful opera
that we have virtually heard nothing of;
bo is "La Nararraise."
No one would be so unreasonable as to ast
Mr. Pratt to pay heavy royalties on many
new operas, but he might at least favor
us with one unhackneyed work. If a dra
matic company came for a long run, with
out announcing a single novelty, and with
half its repertory made up of stereotyped
old works, wÂ« should probably clamor for
something more in accordance with
modern standards. We have more reason
to clamor when a good opera company
comes to us without novelties, for, of all
arts, that of opera-writing is the one that
has made most universal progress during
the last quarter of a century.
Baldwin Theater.
"Daughters of Eve" will receive its last
presentation by Marie Wainwnght and
her company at the Baldwin Theater to
night.
Sheridan Knowles' "Love Chase" hap
been cnosen to commence the second and
last week of Miss Wainwright's engage
ment. Both she and her company are said
to be fitted with congenial roles in the
drama. "The Love Chase" will be given
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday " and
Thursday nights. Dumas' "La Dame

night and Saturday matinee, and as this
will be the first time that Miss Wainwright
has appeared in this role in San Francisco
there will be unusual interest in the per
formance. Her portrayal of Camille has
been accepted by Eastern critics. Tom
Taylor's comedy drama, "'An Unequal
Match," will be presented by Miss 'Wain
wright on Saturday and Suuday nights.
California Thenter.
Louis James will open the second week
of his engagement at the California with
the first San Francisco production of his
now play, "Marmion," a dramatization by
Percy Saire of Sir Walter Scott's famous
poem. The author has endeavored to re
tain the martial flavor of the poem and
the breezy, outdoor atmosphere which
pervades it. He is said to have followed
the story of the romance with fidelity,
only deviating from it in minor particulars
for trreater dramatic effect.
Mr. Sage baa taken up the story of
Scott's romance at the parting of Con
stance and Marmion at St. Cuthbert's
Abbey, when Marmion, finding that the
irirl who for love of him has adjured her
religious vows and followed him disguised
as a page is an obstacle to his marriage |
with the wealthy and influential Lady
Claire, decides to rid himself of her. The
story of Constance leaving the convent
where Marmion leaves her, of her follow
ing him and securing the proofs of his
tieacherous betrayal of De Wilton and of ,
ncr subsequent condemnation and doatli
are all dramatically told. The last act
represents the battle of Flodden Field. I

"Mann ion" will be played on Monday

will give a performance of "Othello," on
Wednesday and Sunday nights "Macbeth"'
and Saturday night "Hamlet."
"In O!d Kentucky" follows Louis James
at the California Theater.
Columbia Theater.
"The Senator" was one of the most
popular of the Frawley Company's pro
ductions last season, and in response to a
demand for its repetition it has been de
cided to make it the bill for this week, in
stead of "The Arabian Nights," as was
originally intended. "The Senator" is a
thoroughly American play, and deals with
fashionable life at the National capital.
There is a well-defined plot, which involves
j love, ollicc-seekins; and political intrigue.
i The cast of "The Senator" is almost the
; same us last season, except that Jennie
Kennark will play the role of Mabel Den
j man, instead of Catherine Gray.
Grand Opera-House.
The pastoral drama, "A Long Lane,"
will be the bill for this week at Morosco's.
llt is an American story, its author, ,
Sedley Brown, being well known In the
East. There is nothing of the conven
| tional drama about it.
The story hinges upon the betrayal of a
j yonng girl by the villain, Frank Findley.
I The leading Female role is strong. It will
Jbe taken by Maud Edna Hall. There is
i enough comedy running through the live
acts to keep Swain and Florence Thronn
busy. n
Grovnr'a Alcazar.
"My Precious Baby" has proved so suc
cessful at Grover's Alcazar that it will run
for another week.
On Wednesday there will be a "Doll
matinee," at which "precious babies" will
be given away to all the ladies and chil
dren present.
Tivoli Opera-Houso.
The second edition of "Ixion, or The

Man at the Wheel," has met with favor
at the Tivoli Opera-house, and it has been
resolved to continue the performance until
further notice. On Tuesday more new
material will be added to tlie burlesque
to commemorate its twenty-fifth perform
ance. A special souvenir night will be
given, at which photographic mementos
will be distributed to all the lady patrons.
This will also be a special bicycle night,
and several prominent clubs have signified
their intentions of attending.
At the Orplienm.
Two new acts will be presented at the
Orpheum to-morrow evening by Gilmore
and Leonani and "William Roberts. !
The former are recommended as being one
of the cleverest Irish comedy teams in the
business, and Roberts comes heralded as a
great equilibrist. The Eastern press >
notices of all are said to be Mattering.
Of last week's new people Mason and ;
Healey and the Deltorellos," who proved to j
be valuable additions to the bill, will
remain. Caron and Herbert, the Manhat
tan Comedy Four and Clifford and Huth
are also among the holdovers on this
week's programme.
Stole a Play.
"Speaking of play stealing," remarked
Charles Barton the other night, "I'll never j
forget the way 'Forget-Me-Not first saw ;
light in San Francisco. It was away back I
in the seventies. I was treasurer of the '
Baldwin Theater and we were running a I
tirst-class company. 'Forget-Me-Not ;
scored a great hit in London and the news !
of its success reached us by cable. The â 
manager cabled back to his London '
agents to steal it by fair means or i
foulâ he didn't care which. Six men were i
sent to the London performance every i
night and ihcy jotted down the [
dialogue bit by bit. Three weeks '
later 'Forget-Me-Not becan to arrive. It
came on the backs of old envelopes, on tol- |
egraph blanks, and one scene, I remember, !
was written on the blank sheets of a !
prayer-book. A fortnight later we had the '
play complete, and then bepan the busi
ness of piecing it together and writing it '
out for rehearsal. It was a big task, but
it proved worth while. 'Forget-Me-Not :
was the first melodrama with a silent end- !
ing. In these days its last scene was re- i
garded as unique, and it made a tre
mendous hit on the coast. And. mind I
you, that was long before 'Forget-Me-Not
received its legitimate production in New j
York and Generieve Ward and RoseCogh- i
Jan had made their famous squabble for !
the sole American rights."

A CALIFORNIA ARTIST.
He Sheds Tears at the sight of a Beer
Bottle.
Gambetta is a name suggestive of
French politics, says the New York Her
ald, but it is doubtful whether the trained
bear that leads a theatrical career in the
"Sidewalks of New York" cares anything
about frog-eaters, though he answers to
that distinguished appellation. He is of
California extraction, of French training
and with the German taste for be?r. Tlie
actors and actresses who are in the caste
with Garabetta bold him in great re
spect, being careful never to tread on his
toes or give him any painâ at least no
greater pain than he may be called upon

GKA>'D OPERA.
The Famous Metropolitan Opera-House
Company Coming to the Baldwin.
Arrangements have just been concluded
between Al Hayman and Abbey, Schoeffel
&i Gran, for a two weeks' season of grand
opera at the Baldwin Theater, beginning
May 4.
It i? stated that tbe fuJl strength of
the Metropolitan Opera - house Com
pany will travel acros3 the continent,
together with the big. chorus. The two
De Reszkea are coming, as well as
Melba, Calve, Nordica, Saville. Mantelli,
and the rest. The repertoire will be the
same as that at present being given in
New York. Probably Wagner's "Tristan
and Isolde," which has proved the
event of the season, will be performed, as
well as "La Navarraise."
If the coming season proves a financial
success there is every probability that
Messrs. Abbey, Schoeffel & Grau will
make it an annual event.
Dramatic Brevities.
"A Milk White Flag" comes to the
Baldwin shortly.
The first Paderewski recital at the
California takes place on February 10.
Richard Mansfield has placed in re
hearsal an adaptation of Stanley Weyman's
success, "The Red Robe." It will be pre
sented initially at the Grand Opera-house,
New Orleans, on the 14th inst.
The author of "Marmion," at the Cali
fornia Theater this week, is the son of Mrs.
Abbey Sage Richardson, who adapted
Pardon's "A Woman's Silence" and his
"Americans Abroad" for the Lyceum
stock company.
Jane May, the clever French pantomim
ist, has sued Rev. Joseph M. Pullman of
BrMgenort for $25,000 for libeling her
character in a sermon. It is sfated that
the reverend gentleman did not take the
precaution to see the show before preach
ing the sermon.
Olea Nethersole has made another sen
sation with her Carmen at the Empire
Theater. The play is adapted from Pros
per Merimee's book and follows closely
the operatic version. Miss Nethersole has
a congenial role, in which she can give
free vent to her fervid style of acting. Her
love-making with Don Jose is realistic to a
degree, and her kiss bids fair to rank with
the famous one in Sigfried.
Joseph Jefferson recently made a curtain
speech at Springfield, 111., and told the
story of the time, fifty-four years aeo,
when his father tried to open the first the
ater in that city. The trustees of the town
tried to stop him by setting up a heavy
license fee, and Abraham Lincoln volun
teered his service as counsel and secured a
reduction of the license.
Sleep on the Floor.
Mrs. S. F. Lewis of 17 Precita avenue relates
a sad tale of desiitution. Although she has a
husband, who is a. barber by trade, she snys
she is absolutely without food or means. Iler
husband has fallal to make any money for
five moutua, biÂ» last two employers refusing to
pay him his wages, without reason, according
toh -fife. Their baby-girl, 2 years old, has
become ill for want of nutriment and has been
taken to St. Luke's Hospital. The unhappy
father end mother have no furniture and are
compelled to sleep on the floor of their room.
The case is called to the attention of the
charitable.
LAND CHARGE IGNORED.
Maritime Jurisdiction Defined in a Suit
Against Moore, Ferguson
& Co.
A. decision rendered by United States
District Judge Morrow yesterday defines
the limits of admiralty jurisdiction and
will prove valuable as a matter of informa
tion to transportation companies.
The case determined was the suit of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company against
Moore, Ferguson & Co., commission mer
chants, to recover a balance of freight due
on a shipment of 2413 sacks of barley
(271,510 pounds) from Moss Bay to
Diego.
The steamship company alleged in its
libel that the freight rate agreed upon was
$4 35 per ton, including a charge of 25
cents per ton for storage in the Moss Bay
warehouse. But in this gross rate was in
cluded also a rate of $1 per ton said to
have been advanced by the steamship
company on behalf of the consignors to
the Pajaro Valley Raiiroad Company for
carrying the barley from Blanco by rail
to iloss Bay. The* balance alleged to be
due altogether was put at $251 15.
Against this Moore, Ferguson <fc Co. set
np that they had contracted to pay only
$5 10 per ton for the shipment Dy water,
with the storage charge of 25 cents addi
tional. They had, therefore, tendered in
court a balance of only $115 39 as full pay
ment, and events have proved that they
had the best end of the law.
Of course, Moore, Ferguson & Co. chal

Ciun which was made by a bright
Eastern woman. She remarked that our
young matrons and debutantes do not take i
advantage of their youthful beauty and
wear enough of the lovely frocks evolved
from airy, fumy, ethereal fabrics. They j
6hould leave the superb velvets, satins and
bcooadea to older women and stately
matrons. As I wrot? weeks ago, gowns of j
tulle are the dernier cri in Paris and New j
York, so new and wonderful organdies. !
exquisitely embroidered or hand-painted
games, such as we were taught in child- \
hood to believe were worn by fairies j
only, now beautify the fairest of maids I
and matrons.
To be sure all are made over silk or
satin and are far more costly in the end
than the gowns worn by their elders, for '
the lovely ethereal materials iook like
rags in an inconceivably short space of j
time.
As actresses, and especially French |
ones, will probably for years to !
come set the fashions in many ways, I 'â â 
quote the description of a gown worn re
centiy by a celebrated actress in Paris:
Mile, L. wore a white tulle ballgown over a
pale rose-p'.nk satin slip. The piuk satin skirt
was covered from waisi to hem with pleats of j
tulle, slightly overlapping each other, to the I
number of thirty. The bodice was decollete!
carre. or square with tulle arapery en bebe j
back and front, and broad puff of tulle across '
the decolletape. The elbow sleeve* were char
mante. Two or three thicknesses of tulle >
formed a large puff draped up well on the i
shoulders and then gathered again into a scp
ante puff, which was attached to a black vel
vet bracelet encircling the arm above the i
elbow, and barely seen under the voluminous I
puffing. On the left shoulder a floral branch 'â 
of huge pink and lilac gauze poppies draped
the siae ot corsace endinc in graceful buds
nnd foliage. HÂ«-r hair waved and parted, aud
quite puffed out around the face. A polden
Ferrouniere, with sapphire renting on the !
I in the hair, a revival of the |
modes of I*3o which I mentioned s-ome months *
ago would be sure to return. Wide-jeweled j
, gold and sapphires.
At a dance here a young girl was fairly
it in a dress of yellowish satin, fitting
and hanging to perfection. Around her
shoulders vas draped a film of pale blue
tulie, with a tiny mine along the edge. A j
k about the dress was that it '
suited the wearer admirably.
ther toilet worthy of more than pass- I
ing oomment was of a silky crepe texture, j
-tnj.es of light bine and white over j
blue silk. The skii t was without orna
mentation and the bodice of blue chiffon I
with sleeves matching the skirt. A few ;
bows of satin libbon were on the waist. j
This description Bounds simple enough, j
but one of our best women here made this
frock, so you can understand why it had
that indescribable air, and besides" it was â¢
worn by a maiden who is not only stylish
but beÂ« veil.
arming gown from Paris is cut en
princess of black velvet, the decolletage
being iinished with three scallops back
and front. The balloon sleeves are of
ivory satin, beautifully embroidered in ]
oriental designs with btittercup yellow j
silk. The lining is of the same shade in j
glace taffeta.
That the princess gown is <to be much
worn is an established fact; and if you
possess one, such as was "the thing" about
five years ago, do not rip it up. for as tne j
gleeves probably are to be different from j
the dress, as likely as not panels will be |
correct matching the sleeves, so be patient j
and next fall you can probably have your I
modiste do wonders with a garment which, j
at best, would only make a cape or a pair
of sleeves if utilized now. Great sleeves
are to collapse soon is predicted.
Two gowns were noteworthy at two dif- '
ferent teas, and were worn by young ma- '
trons who assisted in receiving. * One con- j
sisted of a perfectly charming waist in {
light blue pink and green oriental figures j
on a white ground. It had a lovely high I
collar of white lace and two dear little j
revers of white satin. On either side two!
handsome enameled buttons completed I
the waist. The sleeves were very lon<Â» |
and had frills of the lace. Around the '
waist was a soft crinkly band of white j
*atm, of which material the skirt was com
posed.
The other had a long-tailed basque of
the lightest gray brocade, covered with a j
black figure. It was cut square in front
only, and had a vest of gray crepe and I
rivers of white satin. At the back of the j
neck was a large bow of black satin and j
iace. Lace also fell over the bands. The I
skirt was enormously full and of the most
deiicate shade of gray crepe. The ripples
round the basque were lined with white i
satin, and three small black ostrich plumes !
were perched on the right shoulder. ! i
A statuesque girl was lately observed at â

a bali c!ad in rich ivory satin, the neck of
which was outlined with sable, which also
formed a girdle. No other' trimming ap
peared on the gown which was considered
one of the most beautiful worn.
Another excellent dress was made like
the illustration, and was also of brocade,
the ground ol a grayish green, the roses in
many shades of pink. The lining was of
rose silk; as you see only a small amount
of lace trim? the waist. It is most difficult
to convey any adequate idea of tne beauty
of the fabric as the truly wonderful bro
cades of to-day must be seen to be appre
ciated.
A pretty girl "poured tea" one afternoon
last week, attired in one of the newest
silks, which recalled those worn by our
grandmothers, for it had stripes of "green
and pink that shaded into gold and violet
tones. It was made with a plain, flaring
skirt and a full, quaint bodice. There was
no CDllar and the gown opened in V-shape
for an inch or two at the throat. A fichu
of the finest chiffon, frilled with lace, was
knotted at the bust line, the long ends ex
tending to within a few inches of the bot
tom of the skirt. At the throat the fichu
was fastened with a brooch of pale pink
coral, set in green enamel.
A pretty woman quite spoiled the effec
tiveness of her tailor gown the other day,
by wearing with it a little French bonnet
and high-heeled shoes. Things should bo
in keeping, and with a tailor gown one
associates sensible walking-shoes, heavy
gloves and a proper walking-hat.
The stylish young matron from Baltimore
when attired in tailor gown is a model
which many might copy to their advan
tage. In the evening she is no less "the
mold of fashion <and the glass of form,"
but at present I am speaking of tailor
made things, which are worthy of our
consideration, for most of us find one such
gown, at least, a necessity every winter,
aa only when so clad can we face the wind
or rain without loss of style.
I cannot but wonder that more women
are not helpless invalids or in their graves
when I see the number who insist, at all
seasons ot the year, on wearing paper
soled shoes. Such soles tlo not even pro
tect the feet from the cold ground, much
less from dampness. However, physician*
and all the sensible people in the world
mi^-ht give advice in some cases without a
pr.rticle of effect. I only know this much,
that at one time I wore the thinnest of soles
and had delightful colds and neuraleia:
now I have neither, hut ray shoes are never
ugly nor clumsy, for I have not found it
necessary to wear hideous shoes in order
to have proper soi'-s.
This week I give illustrations of two
waists. The low cut one is, as you ob
serve, made very simple, as it depends on
tne beautiful triniming for its air ot nov
elty. The trimming consists of a mingling,
apparently, of pink pearls and emeralds,
strung on a thread of gold. Of course
they are imitations, but very satisfau >ry
ones indeed, and are very exquisite, fall
ing as they uo over the white satin. The
skirt is of the satin and absolutely plain.
The other is of pearl gray satin, with a
deep collar effect of red velvet, over which j
is appliqued costiy lace, making a really
chic waist and a very useful one as well.
The wearer is a bright-faced demi-bloncle,
with dancing brown eyes, so the red is a
welcome touch of color, which reminds
me that on Monday evening I went to the
Baldwin Theater and saw Marie Wain
wright. There were any number of
women present attired in light waists, the
usual skirts, and the bonnets and h:its
were of all .kindsâ good, bad and indiffer
ent.
One of the swellest bonnets was worn by
a striking brunette, aud was of a rich red
velvet. A narrow band of the velvet stud
ded with fine rhinestones rested on I er
hair; about an inch and a half lurther
back was the soft velvet crown. In front
arose an admirable white fluff v aigrette.
The pink and pinky-pink hats in the
neighborhood of that bonnet all had an
old faded look. A handsome bonnet, evi
dently from Paris, was of very unusually
fine jet, quite the best I have ever seen. A
few choux of lace and two or three exqui
site yellowish rose? prevented it from
being in the least stiff.
There were bonnets with silver crowns,
with gold crowns â indeed, with almost
every kind of crown } r ou can think of; but
very many of them were far from new.
One refreshingly dainty hat was of white
chenille with three or four short black os
trich plumes. Another, worn by a girl in
a sweet little waist of fluffy blue chiffon,
looked like the wings of some large brown
bird. They were perched on a pretty
brown head with excellent effect.
As for the waists, well, several of them
merited the adiectivP9 frumpy and dowdy.
About those I have nothing to say, except
ing that I trust they may soon be con
signed to the ragbag; but there were sev
eral fresh and fashionable. One of corded I
whitÂ« silk wa<> well embroidered in jet;
another had the body of pompadour silk of

creation of a superior dressmaker.

Miss "Wainwright, in the first act, looked
well in a toilette of pink Dresden silk, cov
ered with little- flower?; a fichu of tulle
trimmed with a full frill was becoming.
She next appeared in a frock of soft white
crepon trimmed simply with cream satin
ribbons. It was satisfactory, but not so
becoming as the pink.
In the ballroom scene the handsomest
creation is donned by Rboda Daitry: it is
of white -satin, the flaring skirt absolutely
plain and the bodice plain also, but re
lieved by the sleeves of a deep shade of
cream lace. The bodice laces up the back
and between the shoulders where j the
lacing ends was a Huffy chrysanthemum
exactly matching the sleeves" Extending
from the waist line were two lons broafl
strings of pearls. I did not at all care for
the black gown in the fast act. but when

many bonnets for evening wear, and
almost without exception they are of
tulle, in combination with gold and jewel
embroideries and feathers. Beautiful
aigrettes are seen on most of them as they
seem especially suitable with tulle.
One of the most beautiful and youthful
of grandmothers to bo found anywhere
looked unusually handsome to-day in a
Paris bonnet.of green velvet and black jet. i
A fanciful border of jet rested on her i
masses of white hair. Next came the i
green velvet, slichtly puffed, and then the
crown of jet. At the left side was a bushy
aigrette, which rose from a knot of velvet.
The green emphasized the beauty of a |
complexion many girls might envy.
I am delighted to be able to inform you
that the newest veil is of plain black tulle
illusion, "with a border, all around the
four sides, of two rows 01 narrow white
lace."

Those among us who enjoyed "The
Amazons," recently given by the Lyceum
at the Baldwin Tlieater, will remember
how much "Tommy" whs praised for his
clever acting. I always think of the manly
manner in which she jumped the fence
and smoked her cigarettes and wore her
jaiittty coats, indeed in every play given
l>y that company Miss Tyee cave promise
of better things, so I am pleased to be
able to chronicle the fact that as the up-to
date society woman En the "Home Secre
tary" she ha,s made a decided hit, and as
a natural result is being much interviewed,
but more about her anon. Hhe is a bonny
Southern girl and is surprising all by her
ranid advancement.
The Presidio hop was a success. Many
bright stunning girls in dainty fresh frocks
were present. As a natural result that
rosy little urchin with his feather-tipped
darts played .sad havoc with the sons of
Mars.
Many congratulations have been offered

FOE WES.
Those who pay attention to social ethics
must now all be aware that letters must be
sealed, not gummed. Those who have
the right to use coats-of-arms usually do so,
and others who have inherited no such
privilege should use their monograms.
There have been Borne amusing in-
Btances where persons have paid
to have a coat-of-arms made to
I order, thus laying themselves open
10 ridicule, as it is a very easy matter to
! ascertain whether or no one has the right
| '"to bear arms." and it is no longer in the
j least necessary to send East to have en
â  graving or die-cutting done, as I have
| found the work done here equally good
and very considerably less expensive. A
crest alone may be used alone, but arms
and crest should go together, or the
shield of arms may be so used alone.
The motto is not a part of the
coat-of-arms, but it may be used when de
sired, and any one can adopt a new one.
Of course many families have had the
same for hundreds of years, while in other
cases it has been changed almost every
generation.
All of us blessed with sweethearts or
wives will be kept well supplied with golf
stockings, as the knitting of them is the
very latest fad of the "saiart set," and
amusing as it may seem "at the polo
matches and race meetings, the fair specta

and sweethearts on to victory, are busily
engaged in knitting them "golf stock

at Hempstead, Long Island, and on all
the steam yachts and club steamboats
i which followed the Defender to victory
| there were numbers of charming women
! who knitted, knitted all the time, so at no
late date will be heard the clicking of
needles at Burlingame.
It is correct at the present moment to
wear brown underwear, the most brilliant
of ties, preferably red. In the shape of
ties and scarfs there is but little change,
however, now that men tie them thern
j solves. There is welcome air of originality.
j and many men select their ties from sarii
j pies and have them made to order, but tbo
' best dressed are conservative and select
dark tri'ouiids with raised but inconspicu

favorite overcoats is a paletot, which is of
' a soft vicuna of a bluish-black. It reaches
11 tittle below the kuees. It has a velvet
collar, is double-breasted, is loose and
' does not fit closely upon the hips and is
not intended for afternoon wear. A
| Chesteriield should then be donned.
! They are only a little bit shorter
rtnd looser than last winter, the principal
difference being that the collar is now of
; thr same material as the coat. Perhaps
one oi the smartest-looking and most use
ful of overcoats is ihe covert one. The
short little ones worn some years ago arc
a^n â f. fashionable. They must be an inch
I longer than the lounge coat worn under
neath, as it is now considered in the worst
possible style to have the undercoat pro
trude. These coats are loose and single
breasted. Numerous Dockets are out of
fashion, as are also Jar;;Â»? flaps'.
London taiiors seem to hav< <1 'icrmined
to make some change in our evening coats,
so they are trying to reintroduoe a fashion
in vogue there daring the -ixties, that of
lining such coats with colored silks. A
New Yorker just from London has one of
cashmere- melton lined in white silk. This
fad will, I predict, not last long.
The latest umbrellas are of the finest
silk possible and the steel stem wonder
fully slender, so that when rolled they
look Jike walking-sticks. Their handles
an absolutely plain, of natural woods.
Crooked handles are preferred.
George Curzon, the member of Parlia
ment who has just married Miss Leitor, is
described by one who knows him well as
a franK-faced young man with delightful
manners, which make him very popular
with the women. His strong po"int lies in
being able- to convey an impression of
possessing a discretion far beyond his
years. * C. C.
Victoria's Descendants.
A laborious genealogist announces, as the
result of years of minute labor, tuat the
Queen has had nine children, of whom sbe
has lost two; forty-one grandchildren, of
whom eigut have died: and twenty-three
great-grandchildren, all of whom are
living. She has, therefore, sixty-three
descendants living â seven children, thirty
three grandchildren and twenty-three of
the next generation. Her next eldest
great-grandchild, the Princess P'eodore of
Saxe-Meiningen, is now nearly 17, so
that in all probability her Majesty will
live to see her grandchildren's grand
chiltren. Few English sovereigns before
Queen Victoria have seen grandchildren
jrrow out of infancy; and none ever saw a
great-grandchild. Hence, her Majesty had
io determine the question of precedency
in the case of the Duchess of Fife's
children, and she wisely decided that they
should rank only as daughter* of a Duke.
This decision was in accordance with a
House law decreed earlier in the reign, by
which the title of Prince and Royal High
ness is limited to the children of the
sovereign, and the children of the sover
eign's sons, the children of the sovereign's
daughters taking precedence only" in
accordance to the rank ot their fathers.
Thus the Princess Helena's children rank
as children of Prince Christian only, while
the Duke of Connaught's are Royal High
nesses, and Prince Arthur of Connaught's
son and successor, if he has one, will be
the Duko of Connauglit, aÂ« an ordinary
Duke, taking precedence merely by date
of the creation of his dukedom. This is
now the case of the Duke of Cumberland
on the roll of the House of Lords, though
he is styled Royal Highness a.s a son ofÂ°a
King of Hanover. â Tlij Gentlewoman.

BAB TALKS ON HIGH ART.
The Observing Woman Writer
Admires Its Develop
ment.
SEEN ON THEATRICAL POSTERS.
The Unhappy Lot of Those Children
Who Live in Boarding-
Houses.
NEW YOEK, Jan. 6, 1896. â No
body ever accused me of being de
voted to high art. A study that showed
a mauve lawn, a green, sky, a bright scar
let rock and two yellow ladies with white
hair â I say ladies because they both had
petticoats onâ was once displayed to mo,
and I was told it was called "Love and
Death." You could take your choice as
to which was love and which was death,
but each of the yeliow ladies looked sea
sicK: the result probably of gazing too
long on that purple crass. The young
man who showed me this picture said it
was one of the finest examples of high art
that had ever been painted. Then 1 was
convinced that high art and 1 were two.
Hence ray liking for art which is ordinary
and common. Some years afro, longer
than I like to remember, I used to stand
on the street and admire art as developed
on the fences and also on the ash barrels.
It is true it was crude.
The rim appearance of the realistic
poster was made about two years ago,
when an enormous fence was covered by
a procession of perfect ladies, whose shapes
were exquisite, who3e faces were fair, and
who were, evidently, believers in health
in costume. They told by example that
the greatest health was gained by the
least amount of clothing. But this was
a fine picture. Up to the time the aver
age ballet girl had been represented with
enormous calves, a twelve-inch waist and
forty-two inch shoulders. The result was
startling, not pleasing, and the looker-on
might have called the pictured person any
thing but a woman. However, the new
school painted a magnilicently shaped
woman. It is true she was Juno and not
Venus, but her foot was in proportion to
the size of her body, and, while she
rounded in at the waist, she did not pre
sent an unhealthy look or impress you
with the idea that she could not take a
good long breath. That arliche measured.
1 should think, at least live yards by four.
The consequence was it could not join
my collection, but I used to go and look at
it, and one day wnen I was gazing a man,
also a gazer, told me all about it. He
said: "This is the finest picture oi women
in a group that nas ever been done, anil
the reason it good the women are real
women, real women in more sense than
one. Not only real in appearance, but
these, women exist, and each one was
chosen a., little slenderer than, the
one before her so. thttt the proces
sion might be effective in contrast.:
After the women were grouped the artist
had models of them made in wax, and
from these wax models the poster was
painted." From that time on I had more
respect for them, but soon I noticed there
was a change in the poster. fÂ£ : ;!Â£*.i*.*
The athebe began to represent a young
lady .with a thin face, green eyes, burning
red hair, clothes that were tired on her
with a pitchfork, and she caressed either a
rabbit, or a bunch of lilies or a red um
brella. Nobody knew what it mean ti This
Titian-haired young female might have
written under her "Go and See the Gay
English Girls To-Night, '.' or the sign
might read "Hear Tommy Atkins Sing
the Patriotic Songs of His Native Land,"
or her only explanation might be, "Buy
the April Tuner ! It Is Just Out." You
never knew what she meant; she had to
explain . herself always, and the explana
tory letters were very queer in shape and
very odd in color. When the magazines
becan to send around these delightful and
most artistic poster*, then there was joy,
because one could always bully one's news
man into giving them away.
By the by, isn't it curious how the inter
est in Robert Louis Stevenson has con
tinued? To be quite honest, I care for only
one of his books, but there seems to have
been something more than charming
about the man, for women who have
never -seen him shed tears, bitter
tears for him. He fought so hard against
death; he seemed to have found so much
in lite that was good that it was a pity
he could not have had more of the life
which he drank as eagerly as if it were
the finest Burgundy. But "the book? It
is none of the learned ones, it's none of
the tales of adventure, and vet it is the
one I like. It is called "A Child's Gar
den of Verses," and it is quite as good for
grown-up children as for little people."
The lines themselves are most wonderful;
the pictures are joys, and, well, if you
want to know exactly how good it is, I will
quote you . one whole poem called "A
Thought":
I' is very nice to thinK
Trie world is full of meat and drink,
â  With little children saying grace
in every kind of Christian place.
Then here's another. Short and sweet.
It is called "The Whole Duty of Children,"
and if more children were raised on it
there would be more better behaved ones
in the world :
A child should always say what's true
And speak when lie Is spoken to,
Ai:d behave mannerly at, table,
At least as far as he is able.
These verses are so much better than
those horrid books about the angel chil
dren who trot around and say impudent
things to their elders under the guise of
religion. There's Fauntleroy. He was
lovely in a book, but I should like to be
preserved from living with children who
know such an awful lot, and who are so
beautiful, so meek and mild, and so very
ready and willing to run the affairs, not
only of the- earth below, but the heaven
above.
Speaking of children brings to my mind
those that live in boarding-houses, "i often
wonder why there hasn't been en addition

made to the litany in the American
prayer-book that would read, "From the
living in a boarding-house good Lord de
liver us." J know there are different
kinds of boarding-houses. There are
boarding-houses that are worse; but what
I cannot understand is why women who
kept homes of their own comfortably seem
to lose all knowledge of how to live wnen
they keep boardint -houses, They seem to
think that everybody is to be treated with
suspicion, and that children and dogs are
to De regarded as cumberers of the earth.
It has always appeared to me as if there
was money to be made in keepiiic a board
ing-house properly; that is, giving good
rooms, neatly cared for; good food, prop
erly cooked and served, with an additional
treatment of human beings as if they
were men and women, and not merely
boarders. The better a house is kept,
the more money a woman can make
through it; but the average boarding
house keeper does not look at it
in that light. If the unfortunate
boarder happens to be a woman,
ehe is credited with a desire to do some
thing wrong from the moment of her ar
rival. If she wishes to retain a particle
of character she mustn't take even her
own father, aged 75, into her bedroom. If
she happen to possess a number of books
she must submit to their being smeared
by the young woman who pretends to dust
them, and by having this said to her
about them: "Miss Brown, I knew you
wouldn't mind, so I lent a lew of your
books to Mr. Robinson, who don't feel
well." The few lent are certain to be
first editions that she specially prized, and
as weeks go by and they are not returned,
she summons up courage and asks the
landlady about them, .^tie doesn't re
member ever having touched them. Mr.
Robinson moved away that morning, and
she is surprised "'at your making such a
fuss about books, cheap as they are." If
she happens to dress well the other boaid
ers are doubtful as to where she gets the
money to pay her bills. If she don't dress
well they feel sure that she isaaving money
and is too stingy to mate Herself look de

has always had stylish people in her house

Here is a suggestion you may be able to
Work up into something::
"Ha! ha! ha! < a l-i-for-ni-ah ! U. C. !
"Berkelee ! I !
"Rah ! rah ! rah !''
That cry m.'ans several very fine things.
It means, for instance, that "each year an
other class of young men and women joins
the nice little army that is already pre
-1 area to raiiv around everything that is
good and true in response to" that cell.
It means, too, that the students of the

The change isn't so much in the young

about school life in England long ago.
I And if that isn't enough, ask your grand
father about the schools of his childhood
and he will he pretty sure to tell you that
there was rather more flogging than any
thing else.
Your uncles had a better time, but even
they will be pretty sure to tell you that
things are pleasanter now â and they will
he just as glad as you and I are that it is so.
The Runaway Mariner*.
[Continued from last week.]
i When the boys woke in the morning it
did not take them long to learn that the
Jolly Susan was lying at rest in a peaceful
harbor.
Bert and Walter managed to reach the
deck after a while and they were greatly
interested in what they saw from that
point of observation.
A tropical island stretched before and
around them, an island picturesque with
palm trees.
Toward the ship came brown-skinned and
almost naked people rowing queer little
canoes, which were well laden with ba
nanas, cocoaunts and breadfruit.
But the island and its inhabitants inter
ested the young wanderers less than a
great white ship that was their neighbor
in the little land-locked harbor.
She floated, this beautiful ship, the stars
and stripesâ the blessed "red, white and
blue."
From the masthead floated another flag,
a 200-foot streamer, which set the boys
a-wondering.
"That's a big American man-of-war, but
what do you suppose the streamer means ?"
said Bert, with a well-suppressed sob in
his throat.
""Well, I don't know what it means," re
plied poor Walter, with white lips, "but
somehow I am pretty sure it means some
thing good."
And it did.
The captain of the Jolly Susan had him

self rowed out to visit the great white flag
ship. Ihere was never any very extended
official report of what he said to the navy
captain, nor of what that gallant gentle
man replied.
But before those runaway San Francis
cans had had time to eat" half as many
bananas as they really wanted a steam
launch from the man-o'-war came along
side the Jolly Susan and those rascally
boys were carried over to the shelter of
those stars and stripes quite as if they were
young princes recalled to their father's
most royal and majestic presence. The
man-o'-war had steam up already, and
almost before Walter could gasp out a
question as to that mysterious streamer up
aloft the ship was under way.
"It's the homeward-bound pennant,"
was the welcome and most unexpected
answer to Master "Walter's inquiry. And
the glorious man-of-war steamed out of
the harbor while the sailors on the Jolly
Susan cheered and the flagship's band
played, "Oh, Ain't I Glad to Get Out of
the Wilderness?" "Home, Sweet Home," i
and plenty of other airs familiar and dear, j
THE END.
The Strange Birthday Present.
"Oh, to-morrow is my birthday! I shall
be 10 years old, and I want ever so many
things ! How I hope I shall get them all!"
So cried little I'atsie one night as he |
danced around the nursery in his white
nightgown.
Finally his mamma quieted him, and
after tucking him in his little bed and lis
tening to his "Now I lay me," soon left
him fast asleep.
AVhen he awakened in the morning, he
was dressed in a jiffy, then downstairs he
Hew two steps at a time !
Oh, yes, everything was there; from the
shining, glittering safety, to the pile of
story-books.
When papa and mamma entered the
breakfast-room they found their little son
very happy and very much excited over
his beautiful gifts, and it was quite hard
work to get h-im to eat his breakfast. Dur
ing the meal his father told him that a
very mysterious package, tied very se
curely, had arrived for him, with the fol
lowing words printed on the wrapper:
NOT To liE OPEKED UNTO, PIN.NKU TIME.
"Isn't that mean ?" said Patsie, "dinner
time is a long ways off." "Never mind.
Patsie," said mamma's gentle voice, "just
don't think of it, but have a j?ood time
riding your safety and playing football
with your little brother."
But Patsie could not forget that pack
age, and every few minutes he would come
in to take a "peek" at it and to wonder
what it was. So all the beautiful sunshiny
morning hours passed and Patsie had
not felt either happy or contented.
In the afternoon his mamma tried to read
to him out of !his lovely new story-books,
but the restless child Kept looking toward
the unrevealed gift, so she had to stop,
because you know it is very hard to read
to a littie boy when he does not pay at
tention.
Then some friends came to play with
him and they brought him some more
pretty gifts; but he spent almost all of
the time they remained in asking if they
had sent the mysterious present or in try
ing to make them guess who was in it.
His companions did not enjoy this way
of being entertained, and went home quite
early, declaring that "Patsie" was a very
disagreeable boy on his tenth birthday.
At last dinner time came (as it always
does). Mamma had prepared a lovely
dinner for her young son, but the excited
curious child scarcely glanced at the beau
tifully decorated table, he was so eager to
open the package.
"Ah, no, you must eat your dinner first,"
said papa. And the little fellow proceeded
to obey as fa3t as he could.
Then came the eventful moment.
Thoughts of all sorts of beautiful things
that he had wished for flashed through his
brain.
One string was untied, one paper wrap
per was removed; another string was un
tied and another paper covering taken off.
"My! it must be something fine to need
so much wrapping up!" thought he.
Well, that little boy untied a great many
string*, and had quite a lot of paper beside
his plate before he came to the hidden
treasure, and when he did, what do you
think he found Â» Nothing but a little pile
of dry crusts of bread !
I .know you all feel like saying, oh, how
mean ! and that you feel very sorry for
little Patsie. So did his papa and mamma
recret having to disappoint their little boy,
but they had tried so hard for two or three
years to teach him to eat all of his siice of
bread instead of digging out the soft part
and leaving three or four rings of crusi,
around his plate that they just had to
impress it on his mind so he would never
forget it. Little Patsie felt very much
ashamed, and later in the evening when
the whole family were seated around the
center-table, where ten little colored wax
candles were burning brightly around his
j beautiful birthday cake, he slipped to his
I mamma's side and said he would always
I try to remember to eat his crusts, and I
am happy to say the little fellow kept his
word.

Who somehow got belated;
My reindeer didn't come in time,
A net so, of course, [ waited.
I found your chimneys plastered tight,
Your stockings put away.
I heard you talking of the gifts
Yon had on Christmas day;
So will you please to take me in

And kepp mo till November?
I'd rattier start Thanksgiving day
Than miss you not Dicciiihcr.

THE DONALD SERIES-NO. XL
FOB TINY BOYS.
When the blue eyes opened in the ruorn
ing there were no sunbeams dancing
around the nursery, but the room was real
"shady as Donald said. When he heard
tlip tinkie, tinkle of the tiny raindrops
ngainÃt the tin water-spout he sat up in
bfU crying "Oh dear, it's raining. I can't
have any fun to-day."
"Let's you and mother try if we cannot
have a real happy time all day," said
mamma as she lifted him from his little
bed to get him ready for breakfast.
Donald did have a merry, happy, busy
time that day and at night just before he
went to slumberland he said: "'Mamma, I
hope all the tiny boys had as much fun as
I had to-day."
So after the dear little fellow was fast
asleep mamma wrote out a programme of
just how the tiny boy spent the day.
First â He looked out of the window.
Watched the raindrops falling into the
gutter, forming bubbles which he played
were ships as they sailed nway so grace
fully. When two bumped together he
said the ships had a collision and an ex
plosion.
Second â Watched the poor horses driven
so fast over the slippery street that three
or four of tueni fell down. Was not a bit
sorry for the men who had to get out and
cut their harness and push back the shafts
to allow them to eet up again.
Thirdâ Saw the little children going to
school, wrapped in all sorts of funny
cloaks and waterproofs to keep them dry.
Saw some poor little ones with nothing to
protect them from the rain but very thin,
old clothes.
Fourth â Mamma and he chose horses
by colors, he choosing all the white horses
that passed by and mamma the brown
ones.
Fifthâ Had on his rubber boots, warm
cap and great coat. Went out in the rain
for half an hour. The only place the rain
drops could touch him was on his chubby
face.
Donald laughed with joyous glee as the
water trickled down his rosy cheeks.
Sixthâ Had a hearty lunch, and then
cut all sorts of pictures from a pile of old
papers.
Seventhâ Went into the kitchen: sat in
A FEATHER IN HER CAP.
his high-chair before tne table. Mamma
pinned an apron over his clothes; gave
him some old soft ra^s to wipe paste off
his hands and pictures. Then the active
little boy spent a lone time in pasting the
pictures he had cut out in his dear old
scrapbooK.
Eighthâ When he had wearied of this
his mamma brought out a large bowl of
Boapsuds and a clay pipe. This meant the
bc>t fun of allâ making soap-bubbles. It
was bard for him to stop tiiis fascinating
play, even when dinner time came.
Ninthâ After dinner, a delightful story
from papa finished a little boy's happy
rainy day.
Indoor Amusements.
Of the many games which are elaborated
from a series of words none is better than
the old one: "I love my love with an a."
It is played in this fashion. The first
member of the company begins, "I love
my love with an a because he is amiable;
I hate him with an a because lie is athletic.
He tooK me to Atlanta and treated me to
apples and his name is Alfred." Then the
next person continues, "I Jove my love
with a b because he is beautiful; "I hate
him with a b because he is brutal. He
took me to Baltimore and treated me to
buns and his name is Benjamin." Girls
give the name of a boy and boys the name
of a girl. If any one fails to think promptly
of a word beginning with the right letter a
forfeit must be paid.â Brooklyn Eagle.
Song of the Holly-Buds.
Little ones, pretty ones, wide-eyed and wonder
eyed,

Chasing up laughter from basement to ra'.ter.
Hark to the story the holly-buda tell:
" Once within the long-ago
To a manger lowlyâ
Wiser than the world could know-
Came the Christ-child holy.
" Came to bring his j?lory down
To all lives of sorrow,
And to weave them coliien crown
.For his glad to-morrow.
" So. since then, the holly elves,
Never sad nor lonely,
Don their red coats by themselves
For the Christmas only."

Tongue Twisters.
A good merry making game at an even
ine party, or for that matter at any time,
is trying to repeat difficult sentences over
and over again. One of the simplest and
best of these is "Mixed biscuits." Another
is "Gig whip" and even worse than that is
."Six thick thistle stick." Peter Piper
fades into insignificance when compared
with such jawbreakers. Having mastered
them attempt "She stood at the door wel
coming him in," and proceed to the direc
tion which the writer has been obliged to
give, "Stop at the shop at the top of SJoane
street." Should any member of the com
pany feel sure of the prize thus far an an
tidote to conceit is, "There was an old
woman and she was a thistle sifter. She
had a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of
unsifted thistles, and she was a thistle
sifter." ; : , -^ ' â  â  ...-â

SAW FAULTY SANITATION.
Hospital Committee of the Board
of Health Inspects the
Jails.
THE ALMSHOUSE ALSO VISITED.
Accumulated Filth Caused by Imperfect
Plumbing Was Deplorably in
Evidence.
Early yesterday morning when the air
struck keenly and before the fogs had lifted
over the City roofs, the physicians con
stituting the Hospital Committee of the
Hoard of Health, Jtrs. Henry H. Hart, J.
M. Williamson ami <r. J. Fitzgibbon, ac
companied by City Physicians 3. R. Mc-
Murdo and A. P. O'Brien, together with
Chief Plumbing Inspector J. J. Sullivan,
went spinning across the rocky roads, over
the hills, out toward the branch jails and
the Almshouse.
Chief Inspector Sullivan was in the lead.
The object of the committee was an in
spection simply of the sanitary and plumb
ing condition of these institutions.
Captain I. N. Clarkson of the Branch
Jail '1, formerly the House of Correction,
conducted the party through that building.
The doctors thoroughly and conscien
tiously examined the plumbing fixtures
from cellar to garret.
tliv recommendations of Mr. Sulli
van regarding the improvements in this
line throughout the City and County in
stitutions, in this building ulone have his
simjrestions been satisfactorily acted upon.
The committee found things there in a
more favorable state than in any of the
three buildings visited yesterday. "
Some very objectionable features exist,
however, in tilt.- way of open sewer holes
and faultily constructed bathtubs. In the
butcher-shop, which serves also as a refrig
erator, a large hole connecting directly
with the sewer opens in the floor next to
the j-ink. The effluvium arising from it
lingers among the legs of mutton and
quarters of beef. "If we did not Hush
things out two or three times a day,"
remarked Captain Clarkson, "the meat
would walk away in the night."
"There should be a trap beneath this
drain," said Mr. .Sullivan, "and the flush
ing shotild be automatically done, as it is
in other institutions of the kind."
"I'd make improvements fast enough "
sighed the captain, "but we lack stuff.
'Economy, economy,' is the cry."
There are 286 prisoners in the jail.
The women's department, jail 3 was
found in a deplorable sanitary state. '
"Ah. this room," said Dr. Hart, peering
througu the darkness, "needs lignt and
air and a coat of paint."
Patches of plastering in a wide expanse
of protruding lath were coated with siime
The doctors beat, a hasty retreat. "Con
demn it, condemn it," was whispered by
each one.
Then began a long night-marish tramp
through shadowy passage-ways, from
which a vista would open now and then of
large, low-ceilinged rooms, where cringing
creatures huddled in groups together- up
shaky winding stairways that led to misty
dusty attics, only to view, when the last
step was climbed, the place where a pipe
rising from tilth beneath penetrated the
roof to send its noxious breath into adja
cent windows. Then down through the
uncertain way again to the place where
the tilth stagnated and dealt out its
deadly miasma to the poor unfortunates
above.
In a tomb-like bathroom six coffin tubs
rose from a floor reeking with nastiness.
In the laundry near the dining-room a
witch of Endor stirred with a long stick a
noisome brew of dirty linen, and the
dining-room itself was remarkable for an
open cesspool at one end, an open sewer at
the other, and a strong draft between.
The committee hastened outside to air
itseif.
"And yet." said Dr. McMurdo, "there is
very little sickness here, ani it is all owin<*
to the excellent care that is maintained by
those in charge."
"It must be a good care," observed Mr.
Sullivan, "for such plumbing-wooden

STOCKHOLDERS TO MEET
Future of the Grangers' Bank
to Be Decided Next
Tuesday.
How to Pay the Depositors the Main
Questionâ Half Enough Money on
Hand Now.
The stockholders of the Grangers" Bank
will hold their annual meetine on Tues
day to take final action about settling the
affairs of the institution. There waa held
yesterday a meeting of the directors, with
all the members present, to talK over their
report to be made to the shareholders.
There is cash on hand in the bank $60,000,
of which $;w,OOO has been collected since
the suspension.
The directors say that they expect to
have $70,000 by Tuesday and to be pre
pared to pay off at least one-half the
j amount due depositors, which is about
$1:50,000. It is expected that arrange
ments will be made soon, probably
within a month, to pay off the whole
amount owed depositors by securing ad
vances on securities from, some of the
wealthy shareholders.
The securities have been examined into
a second time by the Bank Commis
sioners.
Mr. La Rue, in speaking of the securi
ties, said :
"Daniel Meyer, Mr. Hellman and others
know the value of our securities. The
Bank Commissioners are thoroughly fa
miliar with the worth of the notes and
murtgaaes we hold. The stockholders
may lose $200,000 or perhaps $250,000, but
no depositor will lose a cent.
"After the Bank Commissioners made
their first statement I feared that Mr.
Montpellier'a enthusiasm had induced
him to plane higher value on our securi
ties than the market warranted and so I
asked the Commissioners to go over the
list again and strike off everything
doubtful. This was done and we
know exactly now on what we can
count. But it is difficult to raise
money on the best of mortgages and con
tracts. For example, Mr. McNear pur
chased from us a line of warehouses for
$tjO,OOO.to be paid for in six years in annual
installments of $10,000. On this account
we have $50 r OOO due the bank. A line of
warehouses was sold to another pa^ty for
$40,000 on the same terms and on .hat ac
count the sum of $:iu,od<> wiJl come in.
These contracts are gilt edged, but we can
not raise money on them."
M Taken to S:in Quentin.
Frank Klose, the murderer of William
Deady, was taken to San Quentin yesterday in
charge oi a deputy Sheriff to await execution
for his crime. Deady was asleep seated In a
chair in a saloon on Hayes street, when Klose
with an oath, suid that he could wake him up.
and plunged a knife into his neck, sever
ing the jugular vein. He was convicted of
murder in the first degree and sentenced to
hang. The murdered man was a fine young
fellow who had many friends in his neighbor
hood.
Failure to Provide.
Two married men who refuse to provide for
their families were sent to the County Jail by
Judge Campbell yesterday. Louis X. Fletcher,
a wealthy contractor, who was arrested on a
bench warrant on Friday, got three months
and Nathaniel Horigsen, a painter, was
Hunrdcl six months.

The want of the world is strong, healthy mothers. Give us these and we will answer for the race. Nine women in ten are lacking in health and strength, if not positively ill. The
sickly men are those who never were strongâwho were born weak. The sickly women GET sickly because something goes wrong. Compared with the large number of women who suffer
there are but few who realize that suffering is not a necessary heritage of womanâ that a woman can be well and healthy, strong and vigorous and carry on the responsibilities of life.
There is no decree of beauty, intelligence or amiability which can compensate for a diseased body in a woman. Indeed, there is no beauty, intelligence or amiability which bad health
will not undermine. Neither wealth, position nor opportunity can compensate for the absence of health. The conscientious woman has other reasons than selfish ones for feeling bad
health to be the greatest of misfortunes. She knows she cannot be ill without casting a shadow over the home that she would, if she could, keep always bright. If she has children she
will not only find herself unable to give them the mental and moral training they need, but she may not be able to hold even their admiration and love, and the chances are ten to one
that she has given them a heritage of disease. She may well be haunted by the fear that the day will come when they will think of her unkindly for bringing into this world children
who cannot escape from a life of suffering because of her enfeebled constitution and their inheritance of her weakness. In short, a conscientious woman cannot help but feel that she,
as an invalid, is daily damaging the lives of those she loves best, and that each day which prolongs her painful and wasted life is a misfortune rather than a blessing. Yet the time
really never comes when a woman with anything to live for is ready to relinquish life, no matter how acute her physical sufferings or how terrible her mental torment.
Â«
Man is seldom called upon to endure anything so painful, so lingering and tenacious as those distressing diseases to which woman is peculiarly subject, and which are especially terrible for the reason that most of them affect the
mind as well as the body. They produce irritability, destroy the ambition and injure the memory. Ninety-nine out of a hundred women are afflicted with some of these complaints in a greater or less degree, and so accustomed have they
become to pain that they can hardly fancy mortal existence without it. Many of them are women of natural brilliancy, and their possibilities for usefulness would be great if they were not handicapped by these tormenting troubles.
Women have a way of taking their own complaints too much as a matter of course. They say : 'â¦Every woman has some trouble ; I suppose I ought not to complain." Thus they permit a disease to continue until it absorbs the muscular
strength, impoverishes the blood, destroys the beauty, sucks up the mental activity and leaves the victim an unhappy, disappointed woman, with a hold upon the pity of those about her, but none upon their admiration.
The expense of calling for the treatment of a physician hinders many women from attending to themselves. They do not wish to be an expense to their husbands or fathers, and through a false modesty conceal their sufferings until
they are almost beyond help. Our treatment obviates the expense and embarrassment of a physician's treatment, and enables the patient to treat herself ; but she should lose no time in beginning it. Many have a foolish idea that they
will get better after a little while. This is a mistake. The relaxed muscles, the diseased nervous system and the impoverished blood are not likely to get back to their normal condition without aid.
Most women are familiar with the great good VIAVI has done in curing these diseases, but for the most part women have not, as a whole, realized the real work of VIAVI. VIAVI ought not really to be called a remedy. It ought
to be called a food. If we can realize that in using VIAVI we but strengthen these partsâ that nature does the buildingâ we will understand the workings of the remedy and appreciate why it cures. There are, too, thousands and
thousands of women who ought to use this great uterine food merely to strengthen them, the same as they take other food into the system. They never feel when they are eating their daily meals that they are "doctoring," and they
ought not to feel so when they are using VIAVI. They should not wait until this part of the body is starved before they feed it. These organs are often severely overtaxed, and, being delicate, they are overlooked in the general
distribution of the blood, to an extent which almost starves them. There is no question but that if these organs be given strength in the same proportion as the strongest muscles of the body we shall have very little uterine trouble. No
disease can exist unless weakness precedes itâ it is weakness first, then disease. The Creator had no doubt intended that the food taken into the stomach should be sufficient for the body, but we no longer present the perfect type of
physical woman. Civilization, over-taxation and the many exactions of our present mode of living, acquired tastes, habits, etc., have measurably changed the original woman. The solution seems to be that the Creator, in his all-wise
way, has given us the intelligence and skill which enable man to reach in a different way these weaknesses, as an offset to the depletion that part of the system has undergone. Nature, in her greatness, is able to sustain many of the
irregularities of life and survive and flourish, and if we can only extend her a helping hand when she is run down she will successfully perform the functions of life, even if they are in excess and in a different form from what the natural
method of existence would have required. â  â â¢
We believe the greatest argument that can be made in favor of VIAVI Is, IT does not attempt to cure ; it simply assists nature ; SHE effects the cure. Everything that nature does is well and perfectly doneâ better than any
human being. The nearer we come to nature's laws the nearer we come to perfection. We have been immeasurably successful in securing results that were nature's own, rather than the abstract effort of man. VIAVI is a known and
positive remedy ; it does not fail or change ; it is the same now and forever.
Nature provides a way of righting every wrong, if we can but know it and apply it. There is no condition that cannot be cured if taken in reasonable time. Nature's way in these diseases is certainly VIAVI. IT WILL AND
DOES CURE, and the thousands upon thousands of people who have been cured prove it. Mr. Samuel Baker of 1751 Lawrence street, Denver, Colo., writes :
1
"To whom it may concern â
"This certifies that I personally know of over
fifty cases of female diseases of all kinds cured by the use
of VIAVI in this city. That my own wife has been

Novelties IN THE Realms OF SCIENCE
LITERATURE
AND ART.
AT NEW ORLEANS Tuesday was
successfully test d a locomotive of
a type entirely different from any
thing ever before constructed.
The engine is not propelled by
Bteam, electricity or oil but by airâcom
pressed air, and on account of it many ad
vantaces is destined to come into general
use where light power engines free from
smoke and lire are required.
There are but three of these locomotives
now in use. One is doing service in the
mines of the Susquehanna Coal Company
near Pittsburg and the other two are in
service at the terminal of the New Orleans
and Western Railway at Port Chalmette,
and are uÂ«ed in handling cars loaded with
cotton and other freighr.
The new style locomotive will result in
a great saving of cost in handling freight
and in complete immunity against lire
where sparks from locomotives would be
dangerous in the noighbornood of inliam
jnable material.
- meol their advantages for mine use
are as follows: Their shape, as is seen
from the illustration, presents no pro
jections which would obstruct the
entrance of the locomotive into a
small shaft. The locomotive, being
self-contained, can be run anywhere that
tracks are laid. Steep tirades and sharp
curves are practicable. Further, the work-
L< COMOTIVE TO RUN BY COMPRESSED AIR.
ing pans are few in number and the result
is that the engines are Bimple, easy of
operation and durable. Their low cost of
installation and operation is also an impor
tant advantage, while the absence of cin
ders, sparks, etc., is desirable in almost
any service. The supply of fresh air which
is given off by these engines is specially
valuable in mine service.
The dimensions of the locomotive are
about as follows: It is 17 feet â¬sÂ£ inches
long, r> feet 2 inches wide and 5 feet high.
The illustration showing the rear view
gives an idea of the small size of opening
required for entrance by this locomotive.
It-- weight is LB.soo pounds. The cylinders
are 17 inches by 14 inches, and a working
pressure of 600 pounds per square inch of
air in the tanks is used. As is seen from
the side view, them ;;re four drivers 24
inches in diameter, and two air tanks,
whose total capacity is 100 cubic fee:.
An auxiliary reservoir is provided and
a reducing valve for delivering the air to
the cylinders at 103 to 140 pounds pressure,
variable instantly as desired. The tank
heads arc convex outward, and the cir
cumferential seams of the tanks are
double riveted, with manholes in the front
L.cad?. as is ciearly seen from the illustra
tion showing a front view. The horizon
tal seams are treble riveted. The tanks
were tested at 900 pounds pressure per
square inch before using.
A powerful hand-screw brake is pro
vided, braking each of the four driving
wheels. The axle, crank pins, rods, cross
heads, guides and links are a! i of steel,
and hardened removable bushings and
pins are provided throughout for all valve
gear. Sand boxes are provide ito sand all
â¢wheels both ways. All operating levers,
valves, etc , are within easy reacn of the
engineer. The locomotive is designed
throughout to secure the best e.ncieney
for uninterrupted work for Jong hours un
der severe conditions, and the design of
parts is such as to make repairs easy.
The engines were built at Pittsbnrg.
THE DOCTOR'S ULSTER.
Inside Pockets for Carrying Surgical
Instruments and Medicines.
By means of a coat recently planned a
doctor may now load himself up com
pletely with surgical instruments and the
public will he none the wiser, says the
New York World. And he can do away
with his gig, too, it he wants to. The coat
is known as the "doctor's ulster," and in
addition to providing warrcth and a water
proof covering, it is calculated to contain
ail the instruments which physicians are
usually called upon to use in emergency
cases.
The coat is represented in the picture
turned inside out. On the right side
of the coat are a number of pockets, ar
ranged to hold three different instruments.
On the other *idÂ«j there is room for a medi
cine-case, a hypodermic-case and a stetho
scope. This coat is a very great conven
ience to physicians who are'called up at
all hours to attend cases of pressing neces
sity. Formerly the doctor was obliged to
load up a valise with instruments and medi
cines and cany it out in all sorts of weather.
Now, in ra*e of rain, he need only slip on
his ulster, having previously supplied the

TnK NEW SCIENCK.
It Read* the Character of People by
Examining the Teeth.
What, another! Yes; palmistry has a
new rival. Phrenology is way back,
physiognomical research proves too unre
liable, but here is a method that is de
clared to be unerring, infallible, and then
so blessedly innocent.
Teeth-reading is the latest, the very lat
est, means of investigating character.
Open your mouth ! For the horse-dealer's
i judgment is now to be applied to the
world at large, but, instead of "age,"
it is temperament, disposition, with
all the attendantfvirtues and vices that
j the knowing seer will be able to read in
I those ivories which natureâ not art, let it
; be addedâ has fixed there as so many sign
boards. Th.s science is the result of a
necessity for something new and startling,
aiid it will "je admitted by possessors of a
dental complement that there is some
thing in it.
Professors affirm there are two or three
deep-rooted reasons for believing that
i teeth are the index of a man's nature. At
j all events, teeth that are long and nar
| row indicate a grasping disposition; small
j white, separate molars mark his treachl
cry ; inconsistency is revealed by over
lapping teeth, anil where they are widely
parted he is sure to tell all be knows.
Thus suit ta t!ie believer in the new science.
Mr. Roosevelt's tine teeth have been the
subject of considerable comment by the
New York newspapers ever since he was
made Police Commissioner, but nobody
has as yet applied to them this theory
of character reading. Why not try it on
now?
Would it not be a laudable experiment
to apply this same method to all sorts of
persons, beginning, of course, very early
in life, before the dentists have upset
nature's handiwork with their artifices
and made "iniDroveinents" on that pood
lady's crude and early efforts. People who
wear false ones would be out of the
running, but surely everybody else must
be charmed to try teeth-reading.
Even if Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes did
say men made their own mouths, outside
of a dental co:lege they are not responsible
for the shape of their teeth. If. as a race,
we Americans are not of the Mr. Carker
order, and haven't handsome white teeth,
let alone good and moral teeth, it should
not be laid up against us. However,
if there must be as many new sciences
as there are new fashions, this infant one
is as well as another, and may yet grow to
dignified proportions, though it ia feared it
will be some time before it is self-sup

A COAL TRANSPORTER.
An Ingenious Apparatus for Use In Sup
plying Steamships at Sea.
So far as is known to the writer no
especial apparatus for this purpose has
been designed or constructed in this
country; possibly the idea of coaling war
vessels in a seaway is of too recent adop
tion here for such development. It will
be remembered that some experiments
have been made with coaling off sound
ings from a tender by A merican war vessels;
and if it shall seem to be desir
able to be prepared to receive fuel
at sea in this manner there is little doubt
that the genius of American mechanics
will evolve an apparatus which shall be
at once simple and efficient. In all prob
ability the onl\ T principles to be applied
to this undertaking are those in daily use
on the traveling cableway, the coal "stor
age mechanisms and some of the exten
sive apparatus which is used for the re
moval of spait from the great cut of the
Chicago drainage channel.
The appliance consists essentially of a
beam or spar which can Ire hoisted and
supported from a suitable hook. A trav
eler runs on a rail attached to this spar
and carries a bucket. This traveler may
be stopped at any one of a number of
fixed points in this rail and the bucket
lowered or raised. When the load is be
ing lowered the traveler is rigidly locked
to its wave, and when it is traveling the
load is locked so that it cannot be low
ered. The whole of the various motions
of lowering and traveling are controlled
by a single wire ropo passing over a pul
ley at the end of the spar. The spar is
stayed at frequent intervals by wire
rope stays, which at their upper ends are
connected to a single ring. The whole ap

pliance can thus be strung from an ordi
nary derrick or crane, and when used
on shipboard it is not mounted until it
is about to bo used, being secured on deck I
until wanted-. The ends of the spar are j
stayed to fixed points, and when all is I
hauled taut the transporter is quite rigid, j
One of these transporters erected on a I
wharf at Woolwich has a spar eighty-five j
feet long which can be traversed along its !
: beam a distance of forty feet, so that a large
: area may he commanded by the bucket.
I The rail on which the traveler runs is
! made out of a channel iron and is fitted
with stops at intervals of five feet. All
the stops, save the one at the lower end
of the spar, are under control, and the
bucket may be stopped at any one of
them which the engineer or fireman may
direct. Suspended from the traveler head I
is the latching and locking mechanism, j
which appears to be quit** elaborate and
somewhat difficult to explain without the
aid of a series of diagrams. In operation
j the bucket is run out to the end of the spar,
where the traveler locks itself, there being
a specially deep stop there.
The bucket is then lowered and filled !
and hoisted until a ball unlocks the tray- I
J eler and locks the load. It is then tra-
I versed up the beam and past the desired
I Btop and allowed to back into it, when
I the traveler locks itself and the load may
j be lowered. On raising the bucket again !
; the traveler is unlocked, moved sligntly I
up the beam and allowed to run down
I again to the lower end, where the former
i cycle of operations is repeated. It is said
i that one of these machines has dispensed
! with the services of eight men formerly
: employed to accomplish the same amount
; of work, and that the transporter has been
; extensively sold both in Englaud and
abroad. â London Engineering.
JOURNALISM IX FRANCE.
The Rank and File Find Life a Hard
Struggled
generally, journalism in
France is not a remunerative profession.
With a few notable exceptions, both jour
nals and journalists have a struggle to
live, and the prospects for both seem to be
getting more gloomy. A well-known edi
tor has lately given expression to the fol
lowing facts.
Dealing first with journalists, ho says
that the exceptions are Francisque Sarcey,
H. Fouquier and H. Maret, who earn
something like $20,000 a year by writing
articles, and editors like Fr. Magnard (I.c
Figaro^. H. Rochefort (L'lntransigeant).
P. de Cassagnac (L'Autorite) and E. I)ru
mont (Libre Parole, the anti-Semitic news
paper), who make a respectable income.
But all these men have to work far
harder in proportion to their earnings
than their confreres in England and
America. Francisque Snrcey is probably
the most popular journalist in the world;
it is a fair estimate to say that his articles
in different papers are read by 2,000,000 of
people every week, without counting his
work for the American monthly, "The
Cosmopolitan."
There is a sharp contrast between the
earnings of such men and those of even
the cleverest of the ordinary run of French
journalists. An income of Â£180 per an
num is considered very good indeed; the
majority earn from Â£120 to Â£160. The
journalists who earn such salaries are
generally regular members of the staff of
a newspaper. A large number of men
live almost from hand to mouth, unable
to obtain a regular engagement; and un
fortunately the regular situations are be
coming more and more scarce. The num
ber of men absolutely out of work is rela
tively greater than in any other profession ;
the two professional associations have
nearly one-third of their members with
out occupation. i
It is much the same with the newspapers ;
some pay well, but the majority of those
which keep alive do not yield a good re
turn. Although the total number of jour
nals increase^, the absolute number of
readers remains the sameâ that is, the cir
culation obtained by a newcomer, or the
increase in the circulation of an estab
lished .journal, simply means that so many
subscribers have deserted other papers.
The two most widely circulated papers
in France are Le Petit Journal and Le
Petit Pansien, both halfpenny dailies.
The former, which has a circulation of over
1,000,000, is able truthfully to boast of the
'â¢largest circulation in the world." The
Petit Parisien is rapidly overtaking its
French rival.
Newspapers in France live by their sales,
which, of course, do not eive them a chance
to pay handsome salaries. In other coun
tries, except those inhabited by Latin
races, newspapers live by their advertise
ment?.
i The advertisements of all kinds in the
; three principal German papers are enor
mous; even the Russian journals Novoe
! Vreraya, Novosti and Viedomoati have
i each more advertisements than all the
i Parisian papers put together. The Times,
'â  with a circulation probably not exceeding
30, 0 X), spends more money than a small
German state, whereas a" French paper
with six times the circulation can only jog
; along decently. And there is probably a
j worse time coming. Not only are ariver
tisements becoming fewer, but the number
! of people in all parts of the world who
: speak French is constantly diminishing.
A NEW THING IX FICTION.
The Grotesque Figure Introduced by
Uerr Xurdaui
Smokeless powder, the bicycle, univer
j sity extension, any number of new-fangled
i and portentous things are fast becoming
| the material of fiction, but Herr Nordau,
; who is rich in surprises, offers one more
: novelty to his readers which casts even
'the kinetoscope into the shade. A certain
: professor, in one of his novels, receives a
i packet from his inamorata. 'She in
! closed a lock of her magnificent golden
! hair. * * * The habit of minute ob
| pprvation, inseparable from the naturalist,
j led him to discover, on examining the
charming offering, that each sinele hair
still retained its root bulb. The lock had
not been cut from the head, but was com
posed of combings which srrj had saved up
with prudent calculation."
This, it may be safely averred, is beyond
the most painstaking "realist to be found
in the same hemisphere with Herr Nordau.
He puts a long distance between himself
and all competitors. For "actuality" he
must be given the palm over the most de
j generate author he has ever scored for
I senseless absorption in material details.
For if this discovery of the professor in the
novel is not senseless we would like to
know how it might better be characterized.
I The wiles of the sorceress have been put to
naught ingeniously by many novelists, but
it is doubtful if any one o'i them, having
the dignity of his work in consideration,
could ever admit this end-of-the-century
expedient of Herr Nordau. The inquis
itive professor, pottering over his lady
love's hair with a microscope and a "nat
uralist's" enthusiasm, makes one of the
most grotesque figures that even this time
of hysterical fiction has produced. He
goes to the root of the matter with a
vengeance.â New York Tribune.
THE PORKER'S RUM BLOSSOM.
He L,ikes V.hUky and His Nose Shows
the Kffeet of His Indulgences.
Just across the line from Lawrenceburg,
Ky., in Mercer County, there is a large
distillery owned by one of that county's
most reputable and influential citizens, j
This man made a discovery a few days !
since, the like of which was never heard of
before.
He has for many years owned a white
pig of the Berkshire variety , which was
the pet of the entire family. The pig, in
stead of staying around the house, made
his home constantly in the large whisky
warehouse near by, and was fed at this
place, never leaving except for a few
moments at a time. About three months
ago the distiller noticed that the nose of
his pet was taking on a crimson hue. He
thought rather strangely of this, but didn't
give the matter much attention, thinking
t;iat possibly the pig' 3 nose had been hurt
in some way.
Last Sunday he had occasion to again
notice the pig, and discovered that its
nose was now perfectly red and it seemed
very drowsy. He at once came to the con
clusion, winch proved to be true, that the
pig was a confirmed drunkard of the worst
type. It was a custom at the distillery
when a leak was found to place a tin
bucket under the barrel and catch the
drops as they fell until time could be
found to stop the leakage. This whisky
was given to the hands at the warehouse,
and they were never in a great hurry to
repair the barrel. Knowing that the pig |
could get whisky no other way except out
of these buckets, he was watched ana was
seen to go to a bucket and drink at least a
quart, alter which he would smack his
jaws together and utter a satisfied grunt.
The distiller thinks the hog acquired the
whisky habit by drinking the distillery
slop, on which he was fed for a long time.
No attempt will be made to break him
from the habit.â Cincinnati Enquirer.

SOME QUKKB SEEDS.
A Famoua Bean Which In More Deadly
Than Strychnine.
Our North American Indians eat the
seeds of many plants, parching them, then
grinding them and making them into
gruel. Their fondness for the seeds of
some pines is weli known,, these "pinons"
being to them what sugar plums are to us.
Seeds of many kinds have been found in
the ruins of the homes of the ancient cliff
dwellers of Utah, who evidently used them
for food. The cliff-dwellers ate the seed
of the ordinary pigweed. Indians to this
day consume the seeas of many grasses,
which are ground into flour.
The famous Calabar bt-an is said to be
worse than strychnine. The natives use it
for an ordeal. If a person be accused
of a crime he is made to eat one, being
judired to be guilty in case of
death, which is almost inevitable. An
other seed employed for a like purpose is
that of the ordeal tree of Madagascar, said
to be the most deadly of vegetable proa
ucts. One of these seeds about the size of
an almond will kill twenty men.
Another seed alleged to "be poisonous is
the common cockle, which, finding its way
into the wheat tields, poisons the bread
; made from the wheat. It is the bane of
; the farmer in the Northwest.
It is popularly supposed that horse
; chestnuts are very unwholesome, neverthe-
I less in Turkey they are roasted for coffee,
I fermented lor liquor and used for horse
medicine.
In India there is a seed called the retti
which varies so little in weight that it is
used as a standard of one grain. From its
name is derived the name carat which we
use.
From Guatemala comes the candle nut
used for lighting. The famous kola nut of
Africa possesses wonderful properties as a
stimulant, and the betel nut, "a narcotic,
is well known. â New York Mail and

40,000,000 BOOKS.
Public Libraries of the World Contain
That Enormous Nnmber.
Exclusive of private libraries, the num
ber of books in the various libraries of the
world is estimated at the present time to
be no fewer than 40,000.000.
In the last half-century the number of
library books has as nearly as possible
doubled, as the number in 1845 was only
estimated at 20,000,000.
One cause of this remarkable increase is
the threat cheapening of the cost of pub
lishing during that period, and another
the spread of education among all classes.
The biggest library in the world is the
National Library at Paris, which has now
2,100,000 books. 'The library of the British
Museum follows with at least 1,260,000
books, and the Imperial Library at St.

warded thence a letter asking for an oppor

for he was never degraded ; but they broke
his spirit and he doubtless committed
suicide.
It was long believed that he had been
killed by one of his own officersâMagen
die, captain of the Bucentaureâ lest he
should make disclosures dis raceful to the
fleet and to the Emperor. Captain Wright,
who commanded the English ship in
which Georges Cadoudal, the Chouan, and
other Bourbon conspirators had landed at
Biville, had been thrown on French shores
from a wreck and taken prisoner. In Oc
tober, 1805, he, like Picuegru. was found
dead in his cell. The circumstances were
equally theatrical and damning. He was
lying with his throat cut, and near at hand
was a razor and a copy of the Moniteur
containing the news of'Ulm. The Parisi
ans murmured under their breath that
this Bonaparte was indeed unfortunate, as
all his enemies died in his hands. Later,
however, the most convincing testimony
proved Magendie's innocence, and there is
little evidence that Foucbe or any of his
agents were concerned in the deaths of
Pichegru and Wright. It is, nevertheless,
possible, and suspicion will never entirely
disappear, for the coincidences are start
ling.âSloane's "Life of Napoleon" in the

The Scientific Color of Sin.
The Methodist Ministerial Association, !
in session at the Meridan-street Church, j
yesterday morning listened to an interest
ing lecture by the Rev. John W. Milam on i
"The Color of Sin." Mr. Milam made the !
assertion that scientific developments have i
developed that sin is scarlet. These ex- J
periments were made in the Smithsonian I
Institution. By means of a chemical
process the perspiration of a person arouse:!
by sinful passion was subjected to a test
that disclosed a pinkish color. Forty ex
periments were made, and in each test the
results were the same. Some of the min
isters declined to accept Mr. Milam's new
theory, and one member of the association
asked if it were meant that people could
sweat out the evil in them. Mr. Milam
replied that his assertions were based on
scientific facts; that it was a convincing
argument that the Bible and science are
in accord, for the Bible speaks of the color
of sin. â Indianapolis Journal.
ELECTRIC FIREARMS.
The Cartridge Discharged by the Cur
rent's Action.
The practice of tiring big guns by elec- I
tricity is already well established, but
hitherto no practical attempt has been
made to explode the shells of small arms
electrically. An electric rifle has recently |
been designed by J. F. Blake of New I
Haven, Conn., in which it is sought to
carry out this principle, says the Phila
delphia Record. The source of the cur
rent is a battery (A), wbich is fitted into
the stock either from the side or from the
ends. The holes (B B) are connected to
springs (C C), from which the wires (D D)
run respectively to a spring (M), bolted at
(I) to the look plate and to the insulated
hammer (H) fixed on the upper part <f
the trigger (G). Qis the shell containing
an insulated pin, the head of which (O)
projects beyond the base of the shell. If nec
essary two pins can be placed parallel with
each other and insulated until their points
nearly meet. Between the base of trie
cartridge and the hammer is a pin (X) j
encircled by a spring and rireted into a '
cross plate (J) at one end, the other end!
being fitted into an insulated thimble (L),
the point of which nearly torches the 'â â 
shell pin head (O). When the cartridge
has been inserted and the gun closed, the
spring (M) rests on the metal base of the
cartridge.
As the trigger is pulled the hammer j

strikes the plate (J), forcing the point of
the thimble (L) into contact with the pro
jecting end (0) of the cartridge pin. An
arc is established at (P O), which explodes
the contents of the cartridge.
The point of the tiring pin (P) can be
placed anywhere within the explosive
pow.;er of the cartridge, but by extÂ»-ndini>
U near the bullet, as shown in the illustra

powder is secured.

Cramp In the Lee-
Many persona of both sexes are troubled
with cramp in one or both of ihe legs. It
usually comes on suddenly, and while it
lasts the pain is acute. Most people jump
out of bedâ the cramp nearly always conies
on just after coing to bed or while un
dressingâand either rub their lee or get
some one to do it for them. There is noth
ing easier than to overcome the spasm,
and the method suggested is as follows:
Provide a good strong cord â a long garter
will do it nothing else is handy. "When
the cramp comes on take the cord, wind it
around the leg over the place in which the
pain is felt and take one end in each hand,
und give it a sharp pull, one that will hurt
a little. The cramp will cease instantly,
and the sufferer can go to bed assured that
it will not come again that night.âPhila

known in that city. She says :
Mrs. a. M. Rudolph, 1471 r'i*-rn st.. Oakland.
My trouble commenced some twelve years
ago. *It began with catarrh, the result of neg-
lected cold ; this brought on a polypus growth
in my nostrils. My nostrils gradually stopped
up, and for years I could not breathe through
them, compelling mo to keep my mouth open
nil the time. I lost my appetite; could not
sleep; ran down in flesh and strength, and was
thoroughly miserable. 1 went to many doc-
tors, but could not obtain relief. I was afraid
<>t their barbarous methods of removing the
tumors. I had read so much of the Copeland
Medical Institute, and one day read of a case
exactly like mine. I then went to them and
placed my case in their care: They removed
the tumors painlessly and without loss of
blood ; the relief at once was worth a hundred
times what it cost. I can now breathe through
my nostrils freely and leel better in everyway
I want every one to know tin- great good Drs
Copeland, Neal and Winn have done for me"
and am only too glad to add my testimony in
their favor. '

NEW YORK, V V., Jan. 11.â The dealings at
the Stock Exchange to-day amounted only to 75,

total. At the opening sugar was the especial
feature, rising l x i to 1041^ on reports from Wash

Lea her preferred was linn tor a time, bat on the
revival ot the rumors about the passing of the divi

Ctiicaso Ci:is was inclined to weakness and ranged
between 6SV2 ur.d 66^. closing at the lower figure
on the failure of the rumors current yesterday
about a declaraiion of dividends, t-tc." Tobacco
was in demand and at one time ro.se to SO 1 ,'' The
r;se brought out long stock and a reaction to 79 iv,
followed. The railway list af:er an irregular opoti"
ins became firm in sympathy with the.ri.se in su
par, but- the changes werj cOtfOned to narrow lim
its. London sold moderately of the imernatiouHl

New developments in the bond situation, such as
the witharawnl of the New York i ife Insurance

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 11.â wheat market
was rather a tame affair to-day, the local scalpers
endeavoring 10 break prices early, and upon being
convinced of the futility of their effort 3 buying
baci â  bat they had sold, thereby causing a rally,
an advance of no particular Importance.' however
occurred at the opening, higher Liverpool cables, a
slight decline in British consols ahd iurj-e rxiiori

gree to communicate firmness .0 the tone. Tlie
selling by <ocal scalpers then began to aEsen its
]*mer and a decline to yesterday's close took place,
tollowed by the rally previously referred to. Later
there was a. return of weakness which carried
valut 3 below the earlier inside marks. Receipts in
tlie Northwest were large at 684 cars, against 398

FRISCO'S BUSIEST STORE. Progress and push are the everlastingly NEW IDEAS of this business. We are pushing to completion the monster addition
to the big store, and by price power moving out all of the winter stock and broken lines. All MUST go before the big tearing-up time now rapidly
approaching. Two dollars for one are not uncommon happenings during this great sale. The confidence of the people we have (the daily crowds tell us this),
and it's one of the biggest assets we have gotâ even if not in our bankbook. To prove our gratitude we cut prices smaller than ever this week, and remember
the old and true saying, "Time and tide wait for no one." To secure present bargains set lesser duties aside and come NOW.

CHIEF SULLIVAN TALKS
He Explains Matters Touched
Upon by Ex-Foreman
Buchanan.
FIREMEN HAVE VARIOUS VIEWS
Some Are of the Opinion That the Dis
charged Foreman Has Squarely
Hit the Nail.
Ex-Foreman Buchanan's story in The
Call of yesterday morning concerning the
Fire Department and the probable use of
the widows' and orphans' fund for politi
cal purposes at the last Legislature created
considerable comment among firemen all
over the City. It was the subject of both
criticism and approval.
Many firemen who dare not discuss the
matter openly intimated that Foreman
Buchanan had struck the nail on the head
when he suggested that politics has some
thing to do with the circulation of the paper
giving the heads of the Fire Department
authority to expend the surplus of the
fund for the employment of special
counsel.
Chief Sullivan when interviewed on the
matter at first refused to have anything to
Bay regarding the truth or falsity of the
charges on the ground that he did notcon-
Bider a discharged foreman's accusations
worth comment.
Later on, however, he went briefly into
the subject and said: "The statement
made by Buchanan, that I was the man
who cut down the amount allowed widows
from $500 to $200, is not true. It was Isi
dore Grezmand. His statement, that I
was the man who offered the resolution
authorizing the firemen to erect a monu
ment for Assistant Chief Reilly was also a
misstatement. Major Walter, at present
one of our district engineers, was the gen
tleman who made that resolution, and I
had nothing to do with it other than to
approve, as all the firemen did. Regard
ing my failure to move in the matter of
erecting a monument to Dave Scannell I
have this to say: Park Commissioner
Rosenfeld offered to subscribe $500 when
ever we were ready to commemorate Chief
Bcannell with a monument, but 1 refused
to take that offering owing to the fact, as
I stated at the time, of there beinz suffi
cient money on hand to meet the cost of
such a monument. Pending the settle
ment of this question as to where the
money should come from, George T.
Bohen and Joseph Figel thought with
me that the money should come out of the
reserve fund and a design was submitted
by a stonemason. I had a conference with
Mr. Bohen, president of the Board of Fire
Commissioners, and the design was sub
mitted to us. I told the designer to ap
pear before the board at its next meeting
and informed him that his proposition
would in all probability be accepted. He
did appear and the offer to complete and
erect the stone for $1200 was thought to be
reasonable and was accepted. That is the
history of the Scannell monument, and it
was not at the suggestion of Mr. Bu
chanaD, although he had something to
say of it at the meeting when it was ac
cepted."
"Was a paper circulated authorizing the
heads of tne department to expend trie re
serve fund for special counsel?
"Not to my knowledge. I saw nothing
qf it, and i tnÂ«ik if anything of that kind
had been done I would have known it. I j
pee that Mr. Buchanan charged that to us, '
but I never knew of the existence of such |
a document," replied Chief Sullivan to |
that question.
'â¢Is it true that Mr. Buchanan was not
allowed to have a lawyer before the Board
of Fire Commissioners to represent him
when he was tried for felony?"
"He was permitted to have a lawyer as
an advisory counsel," answered the Chief,
"but in no other way was the attorney al
lowed to act. Lawyers are found to be an
obstruction to the board, and the Commis
sioners passed a rule excluding them from
appearing before the board to represent
anybody who was accused of misconduct,
neglect or anything of that kind. Law
yers take up too much time when they
come before us, so they were shut out alto
gether, except as advisers to their clients.
I do not consider tlutt an injustice, as it is
done by other commissions and we find it
works well."
Chief Sullivan refused to go any deeper
into the controversy on the ground that he
was not a bit annoyed by the charges and
that he thought Buchanan beneath his
notice.
Other firemen of the department who
j had read Foreman Buchanan's statement
talked among themselves, but refused to
be interviewed for publication.
Many thought that while Buchanan
might De a little mixed up in his dates and
perhaps had mads a few mistakes from a
technical standpoint he was, nevertheless,
right in a general way, and that there were
a great many more points to be touched
j upon that Buchanan had either overlooked
or was not yet prepared to give to the
public.
NOT UNDER SUSPICION.
Bliss Elsie Wallace Dirt Not Resign
Under Pressure.
There was a story published in an even
ing paper yesterday that Miss Elsie Wal
lace had been forced to resign as superin
tendent of the Children's Hospital and
Home for Trained Nurses about a month
ago, owing to being under suspicion of
having pilfered money from the nurses.
Mrs. Willard B. Harrington, president
of the institution, when asked about the
matter last night, declared there was ab
solutely no truth in the report, except that
Miss Wallace had resigned. Continuing,
Mrs. Harrington said:
About three months ago Miss Wallace was
tendered a place in St. Luke's Hospital, New
York, which she desired to accept, and ten
dered us her resignation at that time. We de
sired her to remain, however, until we secured
some competent person to replace her. She
agreed to this, and the result was she lost the
opportunity of going East, which she much de
sired, as thÂ£ vacancy was iilled by the selection
of another lady. About six weeks ago sne got
another ofler from the East and then insisted
on our accepting her resignation at once,
which we did. She then left. There was never
any suspicion attached to her.

An Old Man Disappears.
The police were notified yesterday by FranK
Van Land, 241 Eighth street, of the disappear
ance of his friend W. H. Verrey. He is an old
man, 02 years of age, nnd arrived here from
New South Wales on December 10, registering
at the International Hotel. On December 23
he called at 241 Eighth street, where he had
luncheon and left saying he was going for a
stroll to the park and ocean beach. Since then
he has not been seen or heard of.
Broke His Leg.
R. Mavrack, 723 Devisadero street, while
playing football yesterday at the recreation
grounds, Golden (Jate Park, slipped and fell,
breaking his ri^lu leg. The ambulance was
summoned and he was taken to his home as he
refused to go to the Receiving Hospital.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 12, 1896.
THIS MAY CAUSE DELAY
The Writ of Mandate Petitioned
For by the Valley Road
Denied.
THEEE WAS NO OPINION FILED.
Fresno and Other Towns Can Put Up
the Franchises at Open
Sale.
The writ of mandate which the Valley
road asked of the Supreme Court to enable
it to progress uninterruptedly through
Fresno and afterward through other towns
has been denied, and the first setback has
been encountered by the competing line of
steel.
No opinion accompanies the denial of
the court. It is not even graced by a sep
arate order, but across the back of E. F.
Preston's petition is written, "Writ de
nied. Beatty, C. J."
The question involved was cne of vital
importance to the progress of the road,
and the denial of the writ is a severe blow.
When the franchise through the city of
Fresno was decided on application was
made to the Town Trustees for the privi
lege of laying tracks on the street desig
nated. This the Trustees refused to grant
without first putting up the franchise for
sale at public auction. Their action was
based upon the provisions of the code,
which direct that all franchise.^ must be
sold in open competition by the governing
bodies of the towns and counties in which
the franchise is desired.
This course would bring endless trouble
and complications for the road and deJay
its progress indefinitely. Every town or
county which is reached in the course of
construction would have to be petitioned
to allow the franchise, and then, after its
location had been determined, the fran
chise would have to be sold in open com
petition, the Valley road relying for its
possession upon the doubtlul hazard of
making the highest bid. To cut these
coils of red tape and to close all the loop
holes which this method held out for
any one wishing to stay the progress of
the road, the directors petitioned the
Supreme Court for a writ of mandate
directing the Trustees of Fresno to sell
direct to the petitioners the franchise
which they want.
The proceedings were brought in the Su
preme Court, because the point would be
raised at every town reached, and it was
necessary to have a final decision in the
case as soon as possible. The petition at
tacked the constitutionality of the iaw, but
the strongest point was not made on that
ground. The further contention was made
that there was no competition possible in
the franchise asked for. as no one but the
petitioners whished to run a steam rail
road through the town. Again, it was
claimed that the law directing governing j
bodies to auction all privileges and fran- J
chises referred to franchises wholly within
the jurisdiction of the granting power.
Assuming that the law was not unconsti
tutional, the Valley road people contended
that, did their franchise begin and end
within the limits of the city of Fresno,
then the terms of the law would apply,
but in the case in question the franchise
through the town was but the continua
tion of a right of way running through
several counties, aud after crossing through,
the city limits it was run through several
more.
The road is being pushed forward under
State laws, it was claimed, and it should
not be hampered by local ordinances
framed for municipal corporations and in
force only within the corporate limits.
A? may be seen, the question was one
of the lirst importance to the road, and
the curt denial of the writ has by a few
words added untold complications to its
further progress. There is no denial with
out prejudice, so that the action may be
recommenced in a lower court in a differ
ent form or under different auspices. The
writ is denied and the case is ended with
out even a hearing.
CHUTE NOVELTIES.
"Cannon King" ,)<>hn Uoltura "Will Par
ticipate in an Athletic En
tertainment.
By way of a novelty this afternoon, the
management of the water chutes on
liaight street have decided to offer an
athletic entertainment instead of the cus
tomary balloon ascension and parachute
drop.
John Holtum, known all over the world
as the "Cannon King," is in the City for
the purpose of deciding whether he or
Augustine Martinez, a local strong man,
is the more powerful, and later on the two
will meet for a large purse. To-day they
will hoth pive exhibitions at the cnutes,
Holtum catching cannon-balls tired from
a cannon with genuine powder, and after
ward taking the gun from its carriage and
bitting a bull's-eye 100 feet distant, and
Martinez lilting all sorts of weights up to
2500 pounds. The performances will take
place at half-past 2 and 4 o'clock, and if
the weather is pleasant the grounds' will
undoubtedly be crowded.
SEARCHING FOR A SITE
The Pesthouse Likely to Be Lo
cated on the Almshouse
Tract.
Supervisors on a Tour of Inspection.
Mayor Sutro Will Fight the
Project.
There ia every likelihood of a lively
time in the Board of Supervisors to-mor
row if the Health and Police Committee
decides to report in favor of locating the
Pesthouse on the Almshouse tract. Since
the Board of Health began its agitation in
favor of a better home for those suffering
from contagious diseases in a different
location, it has been anticipated that the
committee would go on a tour of inspec
tion in search of a site. It was also ex
pected that as the last Board of Supervi
sors had favored locating it on the City
property, near the Almshouse, the
present board would take the same course.
Mayor Sutro owns a great deal of property
near the Ingleside and Almshouse prop
erty, and has always fought any such plan
strenuously.
Yesterday Supervisors Morgenstern,
Dunker, Hughes and Benjamin went on a
little trip in search of a site and headed
direct for the Almshouse. They inspected
the tract thoroughly, and while no report
was formulated, there is little doubt that
they will follow the example of their pre
decessors ana report that the City property
near the Almshouse is the only proper
place to locate the Pesthouse. Any such
action will precipitate a battle with the
Mayor, who says that he will resort to the
courts if no other way of stopping the pro
ceedings can be found.
