VOLUME LXXIX.â NO. 88.
GOEBEL EXPOSES
THEIR FRAUDS.
Boldly Denounces Methods
of Huntington and His
Associates.
MUST PASS THE BILL.
California People Pillaged and
Plundered in the Name of
Kentucky.
RINGING APPEAL FOR JUSTICE.
Legislators Should Undo the Wrong
Done in Granting the Southern
Pacific Charter.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 25.â Senator
Goebela bill to repeal the charter of the
> outhern Pacific Railroad Company came
up as a special order in the Senate this
afternoon and was debated at length, the
discussion being cut off by the hour of
a'.journment. The great interest which
is taken here in the subject of the repeal
was indicated by the presence of a large
ero*d in the Senate lobbies. The Senate
reconvened at 3 o'clock.
Senator Goebel. the author of the bill,
opened the debate in a speech of three
quarters ol an houT, during which he was
given the closest attention. Senator.' Hays
of Louisville, who is interested with Hunt
ington in one of his roads, followed, speak
ing against the repeal, and Senator "Weis
s-inger of Louisville, also speaking on
that side, had the floor when the Senate
adjourned.
Senator Goebel in advocacy of the bill
made what was generally pronounced one
Â«>f the clearest and most forcible argu
ments heard in the Senate "in recent years.
His exposition of Huniingtou and his
methods were alike scalding and brilliant.
He reviewed the history of the organiza
tion of the roaa, the duping; of the Gov
erume'nt by him, and how Huntington,
Stanford and Hopkins under corporate
disguise contracted with themselves in
constructing the road.
He then detailed how they had prac
ticed a fraud upon the people in Kentucky
by coming here and securing the charter
through the influence of some of their
friends in this State. He asked if the
Honai'trs were wiJliu* to see California
people pillaged and Dlundered in the name
of Kentucky, as the road was doing, and
made an earnest appeal in the name of
right, honor and justice to Tote for his
bill.
When Senator Goebel had concluded
Senator Hays took the floor and read his
f }>eech, which was made up largely of ex
tracts from newspaper editorials defend
ing the Southern Pacific. He read the
card of Harrington published in the
Capital, in which Huntington was pic
tured as a benefactor; also other cards and
extracts against the bill, and displayed
the matter that has been sent in favor of
the passage of the bill, including the
valentine which created considerable mer
riment among the galleries and the unac
quainted.
He asserted boldly that he was a di
rector in one of Huntington's roads.which
fact was noted and will probably be
brought Tip at the proper time, and pre
vent his voting on the bill, when it comes
to a ballot, on the constitutional prohibi
tion of a personal interest. There was no
question raised, but a quiet smile played
over the face of Senator Goebel and friends
of the measure as Senator Hays thus re
vealed his connection with the road. He
declared that no money had been used by
Huntington and the Southern Pacific peo
ple, and claimed that the repeal bill was
the result of spitework emanating from
Mayor Sutro, who he declared was a
sycophant and slanderer. Its passage, he
said, not only imperiled one hundred and
seventy millions of stock in the Southern
Pacific, but also railroad securities all
over the country. Huntington was held
up as almost an angel and the greatest
benefactor of the age.
Senator Weissinger's address was of a
much more dignified character and was
devoted solely to the legal phases of the
bill and the probable legal effect the re
peal would have. The bill will be taken
up again on Thursday evening and further
debate will be had.
Senator Hays said to The Cat.l corre
spondent to-night: "The bill will never be
passed. The vote will stand fully 23
against the measure."
This is known to be a wild boast and
sentiment for the measure was seen to be
strong this evening. There will probably
be tpn votes for the bill. Senator Gaebel
believes that the bill will be acted on by
the Senate during Thursday evening's ses
sion and will be passed by a large major
ity. Efforts arÂ« now being devoted on
members of the House, as the Huntington
]<eoplc hope to there prevent the passage
of the measure.
RALLY Or THE LOBBY.
HpecchrÃ of Hnyra and Heiatinger of
Little Avail.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 25.â The Hunt
ington people, with their double-team com
bination lobby, have become more active
against the repeal of the bill since the
opening of the tire on the methods of the
road by Senator Goebel at this afternoon's
session. A good deal of feeling was en
gendered and Huntington's friends are
smarting under the hot shot of friends of
the bill and realize more than ever their
determination to pass the measure, not
withstanding the ditliculties in the way in
the effort* Of the Southern Pacific people
to delay every possible moment.
A ludicrous incident in connection with
the repeal bill came to light to-nieht. A
friend of the measure in California had
written Representative Thorne of the
House fur a picture of Senator Goebel.
'ihorne is something of a wag, and pro
cured a photograph of Rev. Fred Rider,
also * memoer of the House, and for
The San Francisco Call.
warded it with the name of Senator Goebel
written thereon.
The general engagement is now well on,
and so far the advantage is certainly on
the side of repeal. Goebel, as was ex
pected, sailed â in fully equipped with
facts and instances of the history and
workings of the Southern Pacific Company
since Kentucky gave it birth, and he de
livered liis fire in the most approved
style, making even the thickest skinned of
Huntington's pachydermatous advocates
wince.
he commanded the attention that the
Importance of the question and his efforts
in behalf of justice deserved, and he un
doubtedly made a strong impression on
those who were open to conviction.
Oeobel speaks offhand and without
notes. He has a clear, flexible voice and
very forcible action. Standing erect on
the floor, looking from one to another as
he delivered his convincing arguments,
and with the conscious flush of right on
his side and victory, he presented a strong
contrast to the gentleman who followed
him, Senator Hays, the Huntington
"heavy -weight.''
The major being, as his old darky said,
"Five foot one way and six foot the
tother," presents a much more imposing
appearance on the floor than does Senator
Goebel as long as he keeps his mouth shut.
When he begins to talk, however, he be
gins to dwindle, and soon sinks way down
in comparison. This is especially the
case when he knows that he is in the
wrong, as in this instance. The major
has plenty of room in his head for ideas,
but he don't keep them well sorted, and
they come out, as it were, in such confu
sion, though without hurry, that they
crowd each other, and his mouth, being
rather small, get stuck in the act of utter
ance. The major does not talk too freely
on any occasion.
To avoid arty halting or resorting of his
"idees" he put them all down in order on
paper, borrowing many from hired Hunt
ington editorials, and proceeded to read
them off like a young preacher with a bor
rowed sermon.
The tenor of all the various extracts and
clippings that he read was of one accord,
and though they knew that great minds
think alike, his audience began to see that
they in this instance, at least, expressed
themselves so very much alike as to cause
them to suspect that the major's matter
was all the product of one great mind.
AVhen he reads "writing or print" the
major has to wear two pair of glasses, and
this, of course, makes him appear funny
if not ludicrous. And when he begins to
read in his slow, doubtful tone, with his
eyes rather fixed on the paper, and gesticu
lating with his free hand he gets more so
and all the iruposingness banishes. It's a
pity, too. The major means well. His
heart is in the right place, but he has such
a regard for his old friend Huntington, or
fear of old "Smoothing Iron" that he is not
his own master always.
The major saw that Goebel had a maga
zine full of shot that he was saving and
thought that he had better ''fess up,"' so
he acknowledged that he held the nomi
nal "position as a director in the Elizabeth
town and Hadgruville railroad, which he
and his associates incorporated and turned
over to the "old man" a few years ago for
a consideration.
Weissinger's learned legal remarks
would doubtless have been much more im
pressive if he had but the dignity of an
English Barrister's wig to his bald head
and clean-shaved face.
As it is incomprehensible as the techni
cal language he uses, maybe he never looks
as if he was really in earnest, and when
any one looks attentively and inquiringly
into his eyes and shakes the head as if
questioning his statements, a smile is apt
to play around the corners of his mouth.
The Senator is very dogmatic and obsti
nate when he once takes a josition.
The only objection is that he looks to
his own set in the PendennisClub to learn
what public opinion js. Senator Jack
Gross told him the other day that he rep
resented no one but the mutual admira
tion society down at Louisville, to which
he belonged; arid Jack Gross, was not far
wrong.
It is not thought that Weissinger made
many converts to his side by his effort
so far, with all his labored learning.
COXFEnEXCK OF DEMOCRATS.
They May Drop Blackburn and Support

FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 25.â The sound
money Democrats held a conference in a
room at the Capitol Hotel to-night and
discussed the matter of dropping Black
burn and giving their support to a sound
money Democrat whom they hope to elect.
It is said they will support Judge Willis
Reeves of Todd County, and are hoping to
secure the vote of Senator Petrie
(Reo.) of Todd County. It is fur
ther reported that they will present a pe

instruct his forces to cast their solid vote
for Judge Reeves or some other sound
money Democrat, and hold out as an in
ducement that this action on his part
would solidify the bolters for him in oase
they fail in an election.

What! One Hundred Years More of This?
TWO CASHIERS
ARE SHOT DOWN
Robbers Make Daring Raids
Upon Banks Not Well
Protected.
TWO DEFENDERS SLAIN.
In One Instance Loot Is Secured,
but Failure Results in
Another.
PUESUIT OF THE DESPERADOES.
If They Are Captured the Authorities
Will Not Be Put to the Trouble
of a Trial.
"WARREN", Ark., Feb. 25.â A daring at
tempt at bank robbery occurred here at 3
o'clock to-day. The robbers failed to get
any money, but the brave cashier. Mr.
Adair, lies badly wounded, and T. M.
Goodwin, a leading citizen, merchant and
bank director, is dead.
There were only three of the robbers,
one a tall, red-complexioned, sandy-mus
tashed individual, and the other two ap
parently brothers, black hair and dark
complexioned, round faces, apparently of
foreign birth. They have been camped a
few miles out from town for about ten
days.
They have been about town occasionally
buying horse feed and provisions and one
of them made a deposit of $25 in the Mer
chants' and Planters' Bank, shortly after
ward drawing it out half at a time. "
To-day about 2 p. m. they were noticed
coming into town, but no attention was
paid to them until they walked into the
bank, single hie. On entering the bank
tbe one who had deposited and drawn out
the ?2o demanded of the cashier to know
if he did not pay interest on deposits.
He replied, "No," whereupon, with an
oath, the robber presented his pistol and
ordered the cashier to hold up his hands.
At this time T. M. Goodwin and D. W.
Button, two directors, were sitting inside
the office, and did not pay any attention
until Mr. Adair, instead of holding up his
hands, reached for his pistol lying close by.
Then the robbers fired on him, grazing
his head and stunning him so that he fell
to the floor.
Doubtless the robbers thought him
dead, and rushed inside to eet the plun
der. Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Sutton were
in their way, and though unarmed were
fired on. Mr. Goodwin fell fatally
wounded.
Meanwhile the cashier on the floor fired
two shot 9at the robber nearest him, when
they fired on him again and put a 4"i
caliber ball through his shoulder. He is
notponsidered fatally wounded. The rob
befs escaped, but failed to get any money.
KILLED THE CASHIER.
Two Robbers Made a Daring Said on a
: Texas Bank.
WICHITA, Kans., Feb. 25.-A special
from Wichita' Falls, Tex., says: Two rob
bers entered the City National â  Bank of
this city at 2:45 p. m. and demanded the
money of Cashier Dorsey, who resisted
them. â  ," . â¢'
' Shooting began, resulting .in the death
of Cashier Frank Dorsey and the wound
ing of ; Bookkeeper P. P. Langford. Lang
ford's injuries are not serious, being light
flesh wounds. . -'; .;
The robbers secured only a few hundred
dollars in silver. ' . - ". .
._ They then mounted their horses and
made a run for their lives. By this time
many -i of the citizens had armed them
selves and a small battle took place. One
robber's horse was shot from under him,
and it is believed the robber was wounded.
He mounted behind his partner, and
about a mile from town they met a farmer
in a buegy. They took his horses and
made a break for the hills.
In the meantime the citizens had se
; cured horses and at last reports were
within a quarter of a mile of the robbers
i with good prospects of overtaking them.
Captain McDonald and his rangers came
in at 4 o'clock and took the trail at once.
It is believed a lynching will take place if
the robbers are caught. A reward of $1000
if offered by the I'anhandle and City Na
tional Banks for their capture, dead or
alive.

They Fought a Vitchtd Battle in a liela-
ware Tillogt.
WILMINGTON, Dei.. 4 Feb. 25. -The lit
tle village of WhaU>YH'.e, a few miles
from Frankford, Sussex'* 'Juunty, was the
scene on Saturday night of a pitched bat
tle between six jealous lovers. One man
was killed, another is likely to die, and a
third will probably t>ay the penalty of the
crime on the gallows.
The murdered man is William Harnblin,
and the wounded are John Quilleu and his
son John. Old man Quillen bas been
courting Mrs. Ann Bouden, a widow, who
lives on the outskirts of the village, and
went to her home on Saturday nitrht to
make his regular call. His son, John
Quillon, also went to the bouse to court the
widow's daughter.
William Hambiin, George Van Baker
and Frank Hickman, rivals, bent upon
breakinc up the love-making went to the
house ana started a fight. They were
ejected, and waited on the outside to way
lay the Quillens, and when the latter came
out of the house they were joined by
Feter L. Davis, a farmer, and a hand-to
hand encounter ensued between the six
men. During the melee Van Baker
stabbed his friend Hambiin in the region
of the heart, killing him instantly. The
elder Quillen's scalp was split open, and
his one received several cuts. No arrests
have been made.
SWEPT AWAY BY THE ICE
Collapse of a Span of a Big
Drawbridge Over the
Mississippi.
The Engineer of a Rock Island Train
Stopped in Time to Prevent
a Disaster.
DAVENPORT, iowa, Feb. 25.â At 12:40
o'clock this afternoon the north half of
the span of the Government bridge across
the Mississippi collapsed and fell into the
river. The accident was caused by the ice,
which had gorged a mile east of the bridge.
The ice suddenly broke and rushed with
tremendous force against the false work
which held the span in position. Al
though extraordinary precautions had
been taken to prevent such an accident,
the structure, ir. its semi-completed condi
tion, was unable to withstand such an on
slaught, ana in a twinkling the huge steel
beams and lofty derricks lay on the' river
bottom a twisted, useless mass.
Less than thirty feet away when the
span fell was a Chicago, Rock Island and
Pacific train, consisting of two coaches
and a locomotive. The engineer, seeing
the swaying structure, stopped his train
just in tim* to prevent its destruction.
The Rock Island road has the exclusive
use of the railway rights, and the bridge
was being: rebuilt in order to afford the
railway a double track.
Bert Kustard of Crookston, Minn., was
the only one of sixty men working on the
bridge at the time of the accident that was
hurt. He jumped a distance of twenty
rive feet to the ice and broke a leg. It will
be a week berore the Rock Island road can
run trains across the bridge.

HAVANA, Ct-ba, Feb. 2o.â Charles
Michelson, correspondent of the New York

taken identity.
The prisoners taken at Guatao and Punta
Brava Saturday have also been placed in
Morro Castle.
The rebels have resumed the burning of
cane in the province of Matanzas. Three
i.undred thousand arrobas have been
burned on El Triondo estate at Cabazas.
Cane has also been burned on El Combate
estate at San Francisco de Colonia in the
same locality, and at the Dolores estate at
Santa Domineo in Santa Clara.
The news of the capture at New York of
the filibustering expedition under Garcia
caused a sensation here. The Spaniards
praise the vigilance of the American navy.

THIS WAS JVOT JOCrOXTEO.
One Battle . in . Which, the Spanish Suf
fered. Great Lot:
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 22 (via Tampa,
Fla., Feb. 25.)â Refugees from San Cristo
bel and Candelaria, towns on the western
railroad in Piiiar del Rio province, bring
news from a region that is without tele
graph, railroad transportation and regular
mails. It is also a province without salt,
and in whicU the inhabitants are shut up
in towns in a starving condition and
guards of Spanish troops threaten to shoot
any one passing in or out.
It appears that a battle has taken place
which has- not figured in the official
Government report. It was at San Cristo
bel on the 13th. The town had been occu
pied by the rebels from January 6 to that
date. Antonio Maceo had fought with
General Luque at Paso Real on one side
of the town and later with General Canelia
on the other side. Coionei Sefgura and 600
men had a narrow escape from annihila
tion on the main road between Candelaria
and San Cristobel on the 6th, but no light
in San Cristobel .has been announced bj*
the Government.
An eye-witness to the affair said that a
Spanish column 1200 strong under Colonel
Hernandez arrived at San Cristobel on the
13th, supposing that the insurgents had
gone further east, for Maceo was near Ar
tensia. The rebel leader, Zayas, and rive
of his men were in the town and 900 qf his
followers were camped just east of the
town. Hernandez came from the west,
entering the main street. Zayas and his
men ran firing their revolvers to warn the
men of the approach of the troops. Zayas
reached the rebel camp and took com
mand. He divided his men into three
battalions of 300 men each. Two of them
remained at the east end of the town and
attacked Hernandez's coiumn as they
came down the narrow street.
With 300 mounted men Zayas rode
around the town and entered in Hernan
| dez's rear, attacking the troops and driv
ing them in between the crossfire of the
other rebel bands. Hernandez fought
desperately, and used several cannon; but
the rebels had him in a disadvantageous
position. He fought on, moving slowly
along the road east from San Cristobel to
Candelaria. Zayas' men fought him on
each flank and from the rear. It is said
that the road was littered with dead sol
diers for the entire six miles to Candelaria.
The informant said he saw in the ruins of
a house which had been burned on the
road the heads of six Spanish soldiers, the
bodies having been burned to prevent
identification. The rebels burned two
large Government bridges on the highway
at Hagassa and Rio Honde to prevent
Spanish cannon from being again taken to
Pinar del Rio province. After Hernandez
left the rebels re-entered San Cristobel.
On the 19th the insurgents burned the
town of Cabanas on the north coast, twenty
miles west of Havana. The garrison was
driven out of the town and the torch was
applied. While the insurgents were in
the town the gunboat Alerta, which once
be-fore fired upon the rebels, shelled the
town. That completed the work of de
struction.
The Delario de las Marina publishes the
following account of the destruction of an
insurgent hospital near Bolondron, which
is semi-ollicial, since all matter passes
through the censors' hands before publica
tion: "Receiving confidential notice that
in the plain called Mayea there existed a
hospital of the enemy, Count Lersunda
went in that direction and ordered an ad
vance of a section of his troops, com
manded by Senors Pozo and Gonzales,
directed by the scout Ramirez. Hardly
had the sentinel of said hospital seen our
gallant troops than there were seen com
ing out of the same eight unarmed indi
viduals, who immediately fled. They were
captured, and a medical case, cartridges,
one Mauser rifle and sundry effects. The
hospital was destroyed, and everything
which could not be transported."
FILIBVSTEKS AHRAIGXED.
Over a ttundred Men Taken from the
Seized Steaiuer.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 25.â Over a
hundred men were brought up from the
steamer Bermuda this morning. They
are principally Cubans. The filibusters,
including the leader, Garcia and Cap
tain Hughes, were taken to the Federal
building, to the United States Marshal.
The District Attorney says no definite
charges have been made against the pris
oners nor vessels seized. They are only
detained by orders from Washington.
Shortly after 12 o'clock to-day all the
prisoners were released excepting General
Calixto Garcia, Captain Hughes and two
others under telegraphic direction from
the Attorney - General at Washington.
Commissioner Shields adjourned the ex
amination of the remaining four.
Benjamin Cuerra, Treasurer of the
Cuban Junta, was arrested this alternoon
by the United States Marshal. He is
charged with having given a receipt for
certain money used in fitting up the fili
bustering expedition.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 25.â While
Minister Depuy de Lome declines to
speak about the Bermuda seizure, it is
learned that the Spanish authorities here
attach more importance to last night's re
sults than anything yet accomplished.
BOOTH STILL UNDECIDED
Will Announce on Saturday the
Course He Intends to
Take.
Said to Have Been Offered $i,000.0d0
if He Organizes an Independ
ent Army.
NEW YORK, X. V., Feb.
ton Booth and his wife did not appear at
headquarters to-day. All that was known
as to the intentions of Baliington Booth
had been conveyed to Staff Captain Cay
gill in a note stating that he would return
to headquarters on Saturday either to
"make a stand" or to "turn over the prop
erty of the Salvation Army to his suc
cessor."
It was said that by "to make a stand"
Baliington Booth meant he would .try to
hold the headquarters and nther property
for the American organization of the Sal
vationists aeainst the claims of the British
Commissioners. Commenting upon the
note which he had received Mr. Caygill
said to a reporter:
"If the commander decides to 'make a
stand,' he will not be followed by one
tenth of the officers of ths army."
Captain Caygill said further: "There is
one man in New York who offered the
commander $1,000,000 on his note of hand
if on Saturday next he decides to declare
independence and start what would be
known as the American Army."
STARS IN THE .SEW FIjAQ.
Their Arrangement Considered by Her
bert and Latnont.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 25.-A Herald
special from Washington says: Secretaries
Herbert and Lamont are giving special
attention to the question of placing the
extra star representing the neve State of
Utah on the American Hag. They were
together for a long time yesterday trying
to perfect an arrangement of the forty-five
stars, which will be the number in the
National ensign on and after July 4.
It is probable that the stars in the new
flag win be arranged in six rows, with
eight and seven stars in ea:h row alter
nately. At present the forty-four stars are
arranged in six rows, the upper and lower
rows having eight stars each and the
others seven stars each.
The War Department decided some time
ago to place the additional star at the end
of the fourth row, and flags so arranped
are being manufactured for the army. The
arrangement of six rows, with eight and
seven stars alternately, so favorably im
pressed Secretary Herbert that he asked
Secretary Lamont to reconsider the design
adopted by the army.

DR. JAMESON IS
TAKEN TO LONDON
Arraigned Before a Swell
Crowd in the Police
Court.
RELEASED WITH HIS MEN
Charged With Having Made
War Upon a Friendly
State.
CHEERS FOR ALL THE RAIDERS.
Through Mistake Captain Heany, an
American, Received a Big
Ovation.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 25.-Dr. Jameson,
formerly administrator of the British
South Africa Company, who Jed the raid
into the Transvaal, arrived in London this
evening, was arraigned in the Bow-street
Police Court, and was released upon his
own recognizance in the sum of Â£2000.
Fourteen others who took part in the raid
*vere arraigned with Jameson ana were ail
admitted to bail in Â£2000, each furnished
by themselves.
The transport Victoria, which brought
Dr. Jameson and his party from South.
Africa, left Plymouth yesterday and
anchored in the Thames off Purfieet, fif
teen miles below London, at 1 p. m. to-day.
A tug ran alongside the steamer and took
off a passenger and landed him at Frith,
two miles above the Victoria's anchorage.
Here the passenger, who was supposed to
be Jameson, took a train and proceeded to
London, where he arrived at. about 5
o'clock.
A large crowd had assembled outside
the station and as he emerged he was
greeted with enthusiastic cheers and cries
of "Bravo, Dr. Jameson." He was fol
lowed by the crowd from the station to
the Mark Lane station of the underground
railway, being cheered again and again.
Arrived at the latter station the passenger
was joined by a number of friends aud
disappeared from public view.
The enthusiasm of the crowd had been
manifested for the wrong man, for the pas
senger, instead of being Dr. Jameson, was
Captain Heany, an American, who form
erly held a commission in the Bechuena
land Horse, and who had acted as a scout
for Dr. Jameson in his filibustering expe
dition.
In the meantime Dr. Jameson and his
officers were taken off the Victoria by a
police launch, which reached Waterloo
pier at half-past 6 o'clock.
A large crowd had gathered at the pier,
and when Jameson and his party ap
peared they were loudly cheered. The
party entered two omnibuses, which con
veyed them to the Bow-street Police
Court. The crowd manifested its appro
bation for the raid-era for the entire dis
tance from the Waterloo pier to the court.
The party was given a most tumuituous
welcome by the great crowd that had
gathered about the court. In anticipation
of Dr. Jameson's arraignment a laree
crowd of people, composed principally of
members of the aristocracy, assembled in
the courtroom before noon and awaited
Dr. Jameson's arrival.
Seated upon the bench with the magis
trates were the Duke of Abercorn, Lord
and Lady Abingdon, General Sir St.
George, Gerald Foley and Lady Foley, and
Viscount Chelsea and Hon. Robert Arthur
Ward, members of the House of Commons
respectively for Bury St. Edmunds and
the Crewe divisions of Cheshire.
The prisoners were promptly arraigned
before the magistrate upon the formal
charge of having made war upon a
friendly state. So carried away were the
people in the courtroom by their enthusi
asm that the magistrate ana court officers
were unable to put a stop to the demon
stration.
After hearing evidence briefly the magis
trate adjourned the examination for a fort
night, releasing Jameson and the others
upon their own recognizances in Â£2000
each. The exact charge preferred against
the prisoners was that "The defendants, in
the month of December, 1895, in South
Africa, within her Majesty's dominions,
without license of her Majesty, did will
fully prepare a military expedition to pro
ceed against the dominions of a certain
friendly state, to wit: the Soutn African
Republic, contrary to the provisions of the
foreign enlistment act of 1870."
After bare evidence of the arrest of the
prisoners had been submitted and formal
statements had been made by counsel reU
tiue to the conduct of the case, the sitting
magistrate, Sir John Bridge, remarked:
"No graver charge could be brought
against these men. It is a crime of the
highest possible uravity, and must be so
regarded by every person who considers
the risks of performing the offense.
"It involves, first, the danger of a battle
at the time in which many lives may be
lost and many homes desolated, besides
the greater danger, the offense, being con
tinued, producing a state of war be
tween countries at amity with one an
other."
After deciding upon the amount of bÂ«il
to be furnished, Sir John Bridge ad
dressed the prisoners, begging them for
their own sakes and the sake of the conn
try to absent themseives from any place
where their presence would arouse public
excitement.
He further asked them not to assemble
together more than they were obliged to
do, and to otherwise avoid anything that
might possibly disturb the public peace.
Both requests were remarkable, coming
from a Judge of the bench to defendant!)
before him, and showed very decidedly
that public opinion was strongly in favor
of the accused, and that fears are enter
tained of a public demonstration.
The magistrate appeared astounded and
angry at the cheering that greeted the
prisoners on their entrance into the court
rora. When the cheering was renewed
he sternly cried: *']f you wish to bring
the name of England into contempt that
is the way to do it."2
ANIMATED SCENE
IS THE SENATE
Defeat of Another Attempt
to Consider the House
Tariff Bill.
DEMOCRATS AGAINST IT.
Five Republicans and as Many
Populists Also Oppose the
Measure.
MORRILL AND THE SILVER MEN
Sherman Appeals for Legislation to
Supply the Treasury With Suffi
cient Money.
WASHINGTON, D. C. r Feb. 25.â There
Tvas uuite an animated scene in the Senate
to-day over the second attempt to have the
House tariff bill t&ken up for considera
tion, notwithstanding the defeat of that
proposition on the loth inst. by a vote of
21 to 29. Morrill of Vermont, chairman of
the Finance Committee, felt it his duty to
renew the attempt, but the motion was de
feated to-day by a still larger majority â
22 to 33.
The Democratic votes were all cast
against the motion and they were backed
by the votes of rive Republican Senators â
Cannon of Utah, Carter and Mantle of
Montana, Dubois of Idaho, and Teller of
Colorado, and by the votes of rive Popu
lists, Allen of Nebraska, Jones and Stew
art of Nevada. Kyle of South Dakota, and
Peffer of Kansas.
After the announcement of the vote
Morriil stated that he would make no
further attempt to get up the bill; that it
was hopelessly defeated and it was per-
fectly obvious that the Republican party
was in a minority in ttie Senate.
Morrill's remarks were construed by
Teller of Colorado as indicating a purpose
to read the Republican silver Senators
out of the party, and Teller made an angry
and defiant speech on that point. Sher
man of Ohio tried to relieve the question
of all partisan considerations and ap
pealed to Senators not to inflict such a
disgrace on the country and on civiliza
tion as to adjourn Congress without mak
ing a provision to supply the treasury
with sufficient revenue, and said that he
would even favor and the people would
willingly pay a tax on tea or coffee or on
anything else for that purpose.
The discussion flowed into the cross
channel on bimetallism and monomet
allism, and in the course of it Platt of
Connecticut expressed the belief that the
Republican party would go into the next
campaign on the doctrine of bimetallism
as laid down in the last platform of the
party, and that when the silver mono
metallists proposed to antagonize protec
tion with the unlimited coinage of silver
the death knell of that delusion and craze
had been struck.
The last three hours of the day's session
â¢were given up to the consideration of the
Cuban belligerency resolution. Morgan of
Alabama concluded his three days' speech
in support of the resolution as reported
from the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Gray of Delaware, another member of
the same committee, while denouncing
Spanish rule in Cuba and declaring the
warmest sympathy with the revolution
ists, argued that the declaration of bel
ligerency was solely an executive function
and outside of the constitutional power of
Congress.
A motion to reconsider the vote by
which the Senate yesterday passed the
House bill extending for five years the
time for beginning suits to annul railroad
land patents was made by Davis (R.) of
Minnesota, the time under existing laws
expiring next Mpnday. He subsequently
withdrew the motion and the bill now
gees to the President.
During the course of the morning busi
ness a resolution was offered by Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska for the appointment of
James B. Lloyd of North Carolina as
second assistant doorkeeper of the Senate.
Some objections were made by Senators
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire and
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, the former stating
that he would not consent either to the
displacement of an employe or to the crea
tion of a new office, and the latter remark
ing that an assistant doorkeeper and an
acting assistant doorkeeper had been
maintained, one on each side of the
chamber and for each political party.
This latter remark was taken up by Allen,
who said humorously that the Populist
party was repeatedly obtaining accessions
to its ranks in the Senate and that even
the Senator from Maine (Hale) had re
cently declared himself an adherent of
Populist doctrines. [Lauchter.J The
Populist Senators, he said, therefore have
a representative of their party among the
officials of the Senate.
"We expect," he added, "and are living
in the confident hope that before the close
of this Congress a large proportion of the
Democrats and Republicans will, by stress
of circumstances, be driven into the Popu
list tent. The Democrats and Republi
cans are at war with each other. The Re
publican party is not Harmonious on the
question of nuances bjr any means, and the
Democratic party and its cnief executive
are engaged in a pairot and monkey
tight." (Laughter.)
Platt(R.)oi Connecticut compared Al
len's Populistic crowing to the felicitude
of a hen over her brood. After some fur
ther colloquy the resolution went over
until to-morrow.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont, chairman of
the Finance Committee, called attention
to the subject of the House tariff bill. He
said tiiere was a deficiency of revenue
month by month which would amount to
$30,000,000 for the year, the second year of
the existing tariff bill. It certainly seemed
aa though something should be done to re-
litve the distress of the Treasury Depart
ment and to do something looking to the
revival of the business interests of the
country. He therefore moved to proceed
to the consideration of the House tariff
bill.
The ayes and noes on that motion were
demanded by Senators Stewart (Pop.) of
Nevada and Teller (R.) of Colorado. The
vote was taken, and the motion to take up
the biil was rejected â ayes 22, noes 33 â
as foliows:
Ayes â Aidrich, Aliison, Baker, Brown,
Burrows, Cameron, Clark, Cullom, Davis,
Gear, Hale, Hansbrough, Hawiey, Lodge,
Mitchell of Oregon, Morriil, Nelson, Per
kins, Proctor, Quay, Sherman, Shoupâ 22.
Noesâ Alien, Bacon, Bate, Berry, Butler,
Caffrey, Call, Cannon, Carter, Cbilton,
Cockrell, Dubois, George, Gordon, Gray,
Harris. Hill, Jones of Nevada, Kyle, Lind
say, Mantle, Martin, Morgan, Palmer,
Pasco, Peffer, Roach, Stewart, Teller,
Turpie, Vest, Walthall, Whiteâ 33.
When the vote was announced Morrill
stated that he did not think that it would
be becoming of him to ask the Senate for
any further consumption of time on the
bill. He added that it was perfectly ob
vious that the Republican party was in a
minority in the Senate.
Teller (R.) of Colorado took offense at
what he said as an attempt to read the
silver men out of the party. He notified
the Senator that he and his colleagues
who believed in the cause of silver had
been as zealous and worked as long in the
Republican party as the Senator from Ver
mont or his colleagues. The silver Re
publicans did not propose to be read out of
the party ; they would only go when they
saw fit. They could, he assured the Sena
tor, get along as well without the party as
the party could without them.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, a member of the
Finance Committee, disclaimed all parti
san feeling in relation to the House tariff
bill. That bill did not belong to any party.
Its only merit was to furnish forty mil
lions additional to the revenues of the
Government. It was a bill to provide ior
an occasion. He declared that it was a
disgrace to the country and to civilization
that the Government of the United States
was now spending $30,000,000 a year be
yond its income. Here was a Congress in
session, both houses fully armed and with
power to furnish the remedy, but Congress
was idle and refused to act. He would
vote to put a tax on tea, on coffee or any
thing in order to meet the deficiency of
revenue.
"The President says," Peffer (Pop.) of
Kansas broke in, "that we do not need any
more revenue."
"I do not care," Sherman declared ex
citedly, "what the President says. Every
body within the sound of my voice knows
that we need more revenue. If that same
thing occurred in Great Britain or in any
other parliamentary country, it would de
throne.the party in power, but now, every
day and every hour, we have been running
in debt, and are increasing our debts, and
there is no reason for it. A tax on tea and
coffee would be paid cheerfully by the
people. Any tax, however obnoxious,
would be supported by the people rather
than see the funded debt increased. Now
that the House has sent us so faulty a bill,
let us take it up. make it rigut and send it
back to the House, but for us to adjourn
without providing for this deficiency is not
a manly action fer either of the great
parties or for any one else who is respon
sible for it. Let us in the name of heaven
do something."
Harris (D.) of Tennessee asked Sherman ;
why he did not advise the Treasury De
â¢ partment to coin the $55,000,000 of seignior
age and the rest of the silver lying idle in
the treasury and utilize it for the purposes
of the treasury, as it was bound to do under
the third section of the Sherman act.
Sherman replied that that question had
been tested in the House of Representa
tives t.nd that by a vote of more than 2 to 1
that foolish and dangerous policy of de
parting from the now lawful standards of
money of the country had been denounced.
That was the action of a body directly
representing the people, while in the
Senate ten States where Senators voted for
the free coinage of silver contained less
people than two-thirds of the State of
Ohio.
He prophesied that Senator Harris'
remedy would never be as strong in the
future as it had been in the past. In his
judgment the sober convictions of the
people would settle down in favor of the
best standard of money. He would not
consider his duty discharged until some
action was had on the subject. If they
went home without performing the duty
of providing for the treasury every man of
them would be held responsible to the
people. He intimated that he would make
another effort to have the House bill taken
up and acted upon.
Stewart (Pop. ) of Nevada said he could
not bold his peace and allow the false pre
tense to exist that the House tariff bill
was designed to produce revenue or that
there was any necessity for a bill to pro-
uuce revenue. The most wicked part of
the recent bond sale was the impounding
of the people's money in the treasury.
After Stewart had been speaking for a
quarter of an hour, Allen (Pop.) of Ne
braska expressed his regret, facetiously,
that his Populist colleague had talked
Senators Morrill and Sherman out of tue
chamber.
"They always leave the chamber when 1
talk," Stewart said with an air of triumph.
''It is impossible for them to hear me
speak of their misdeeds." [Laughter.]
Allen said nothing practical was to come
out of the discussion. The Senators from
Vermont and Ohio had been permitted to
run away after the Senator from Vermont
had undertaken to cast on the Populist
party the responsibility for a failure to
carry his motion. It was perfectly willing
to assume that responsibility. In the ab
sence of those Senators he would ask the
Senator from Rhode Island (Aldrich), who
always coached the Senator from Ver
mont, whether he was willing to take the
House bill with a free silver coinage amend
ment to it.
"I say no, sir,'' Aldrich promptly re
plied, "with as much emphasis as it is
possible for me to use."
"Would you take the McKinley act with
a free-coinage provision?" Allen asked.
The answer "no" came simultaneously
from Aldrich and Platt.
"Are there any circumstances," Allen
persisted, "under which you would take
free coinage?"
"No sir," Aldrich replied, "except by
an international agreement."
"There are no circumstances under
which you are a bimetallist," Allen said.
"You have lied on the question â it I may
speak metaphoricallyâ (general laugnter)
for three years to my certain knowledge.
For three yeai-s yon have stated in this
chamber and undertaken to make people
believe that you were a bimetallist."
The discussion ran on this way all
through the morning hour.
The Cuban belligerency resolution was
taken up at 2 o'clock and Morgan began
his third day's speech in support of it.
Morgan closed his speech at 3:30 and was
followed by another memoer of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, Gray (D.)of
Delaware.
Gray argued that there was nothing in
the constitution of the United States in
relation 10 the recognition of belligerency.
He favored the amendment offered yester
day by White (D.) of California, as a sub
stitute for the pending resolution.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio said he would
take the floor to-morrow on the resolution.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada declared the
existence of a slaughter-house for half a
century at our doors by a Government in
capable of governing Cuba is something
that we ought not to tolerate.
Call (U.) of Florida submitted a table
showing that the Spanish forces in Cuba
had lost thousands of men in this war.
He wa3 tired, he said, of hearing resolu
tions of sympathy. ''Let us," he ex

claimed, "act like men. If it be true that
this is an imperial government with a
magistrate possessing absolute powers I
am in favor of Congress establishing a
Government of the people. I at least
shall ask that something practical and
positive shall be doneâ something becom
ing the character of the American people."
[Applause in the galleries.]
The subject went over till to-morrow.
Squire (R.) of Washington, from the
Committee on Fortirications, reported
back with amendments his bill for fortifi
cations and other coast defenses, and it was
placed on the calendar. The Senate at 5
p. m. adjourned until to-morrow.

AT THE MERCY
OF ANY POWER
Billions of Dollars' Worth
of Coast Property
Not Protected.
REPORTED BY SQUIRE.
Estimates of the Appropriations
Needed for Defenses Are
Submitted.
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS
With the Expenditure of That Sum
Suitable Fortifications Could
Be Erected.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 25.âSena
tor S.juire, chairman of the Senate Com
mittee on Fortifications, to-day submitted
the report of that committee on the bill
before it to the Senate. The questions in
volved have been under discussion for
several weeks and many of the chief offi
cers of the army and navy have been be
fore the committee to urge the passage of
some adequate measure looking to the
thorough fortification of our seacoast.
It is set forth that in the cities clustering
about New York there is property valued
at four billions of dollars within reach of
the guns of a hostile fleet lying in the
upper bay of New York. Not one-tenth of
the necessary defenses for that port have
been completed, although its harbor is
better protected than any other in the
United States.
The aggregate value of destructible prop
erty exposed ac the twenty-seven princi
pal seaports of the country, not including
those of the great lakes, is â  found to
amount to ten billions of dollars.
The contrast between the cost of prepara
tion and the cost of war itself is one of the
principal considerations urged by the com
mittee.
It is an anomalous state of affairs that
this great Nation, encircled by a chain of
foreign fortresses near its shores, is with
out the means of resisting an attack from
any one of them. Although appreciating
the strength of the navy, the committee
says it would be unsafe to rely exclusively
upon that arrangement for means of de
fense.
The very existence of the navy would be
imperiled in case of war with any
great power without the support which
would be afforded it by land defenses.
It was clearly shown by a distinguished
admiral that the expenditure for coast de
lenses, as compared with that for the navy,
should at present be in the ration of I} 4to
1, and that the ratio should be increased
in favor of coast defenses after the expendi
ture of $100,000,000 for both purposes.
The Endicott Board of 1886 estimated
the cost of a permanent system of land
defenses at a fraction less than ninety
eight millions, and since that day h\xV little
more than ton and a half millions have
been expended. The committee, having
thoroughly examined all the conditions,
the changes in the law requiring but eight
hours labor, etc., find that the amount de
sirable for fortifications and armament
will be more tnan originally calculated by
the Endicott Board for the whole work of
land defenses.
The total cost of fortiGcations, including
purchase of sites, is estimated at $61,
--500,000; the cost of armament, including
guns, gun-carriages, mortars aqd carriages,
rapid-lire and machine-euns, at $43,796,020.
This does not include the Bethlehem con
tract, already authorized by law, nor any
estimate of the cost of projectiles and other
items which may properly be provided for
in the annual appropriation bills.
The rapid-tire guns, costing $2,762,000,
were not estimated in. the Endicott plan.
The consolidated estimate of all the
boards necessary to make the fortifications
thorough and complete is fixed at $105,
--296,020 for permanent worts and arma
ment. To complete this undertaking will
require not les3 than a period of six years,
and for this reason Congress is urged to
begin the construction as speedily as
possible.
The scheme of distributing the appro
priation from year to year during a period
of about eleven years is approved, unless
an emergency should arise that may cause
the President to order the whole or any
part of the amount to be immediately
available.
As a minimum sum, the chief of en
gineers says that $80,000,000 would provide
an efficient defense, but nothing less than
this would do.
Therefore the committee decided to re
port in favor of an appropriation of $80,
--000,000â^10,000,000 to be available for the
remainder of the current and the whole of
the next fiscal year for each of the next
seven years. The committee also reports
in favor of $2,500,000 for torpedoes.
The committee recommends that author-
â¢Ity be giveu the chief of ordnance to con
tract for forgings, carriages, rapid-fire
guns and projectiles to the amount of
f 1,750,000 to be paid out of the appropria
tion for the next fiscal year.
The chief of engineers says that after a
few weeks of preparation he can econom
ically expend about one million a month
on the engineering part of the work, but
that under stress lrs-could advantageously
expend a much larger sum for that pur
pose.
If the appropriations recommended by
the committee are granted provision could
be made within eighteen months for (344
guns, of which six would be 12-inch on
lifts, twelve 12-inch on non-disappearing
carriages, ninety-four 10-inch disappear
ing and nine 10-inch non-disappearing.
In conclusion, the committee. urged the
vital importance of immediately com
mencing the work of defense on an ade
quate scale, of prosecuting it with vigor,
and of providing for it by sufficient appro
priations of money in order to avoid great
and unnecessary risks to the safety and
welfare of the Nation.
SEXA.TE JSIXASOE COMMITTEE.
Divided on Party Tinea in Beference to
Jiond Issttrs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 25.-The
Senate Committee on Finance met this
morning for the consideration of a num
ber of matters of minor importance. The
only measure of any important signifi
cance that was considered was the resolu
tion of Senator Bacon (D.) of Georgia, jm>
hibiting the further issue of bonds unless
such bonds were previously authorized by
act of Congress.
Harris of Tennessee insisted that a vote
be taken on the subject, for he desired the
resolution reported. This precipitated a
discussion in which all the members of the
committee engaged. There were absent
Jones of Arkansas and Yoornees, of the
Democrats, and Wolcott, of the Republi
cans. The committee divided on party
lines, Jones of Nevada joining with the
Democrats.
The committee by a vote failed to pass
Aldrich's motion to" report the resolution
adversely, the vote being as follows: To
report adverselyâ Morrill, Sherman, Alli
son, Aldrich and Plattâ all Republicans.
Against reporting adverselj â Harris, Vest,
White, Waltball (Democrats) and Jones
of Nevada (Pop.)
The resolution by this vote still remains
before the committee.
HICH. GOLD JT-V THE GULCH.
It la Causing a Stampede in One Section
of Colorado.
LAKE CITY, Colo., Feb. 25.â A stam-
Dede to Yellowstone Gulch, ten miles from
Lake City, began yesterday, because of the
discovery of fine specimens of wire gold in
the Woodstock mine recently made. The
mine is an old location, classed as a low
grade copper and silver producer, and was
not considered of esneciai value. Recently
the owners have been developing their
property by a drift and shaft in the tun
nel, and for some time they found pockets
of wire gold quartz, which they threw over
the dump, thinking the stuff was wire
copper. Specimens valued as high as $23
have been taken from the dump.
Saved From the Hallows.
DENVER, Colo., Feb. 25.â A. W. Van
Houton, awaiting execution in the State
penitentiary for the murder of Richard
Newall, chief engineer of the Midland Ter
minal Railroad, has had his sentence com
muted to a life imprisonment by Governor
Mclntyre. The Supreme Court refused to
grant a rehearing of the case and the
board of pardons last night by a tie vote
failed to agree to grant a pardbn or grant
a commutation, whicu left it within the
power of the Governor to act.
CENSURE FOR MR. BAYARD
It Is Contained in a Resolution
Submitted to the
House.
Utterances of the Embassador De
clared to Have Been a Dere
liction of Duty.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 25.-The
resolution censuring Embassador Bayard
for the utterances contained in his late
speeches at Edinburgh and Boston, Eng
land, which were adopted several weeks
ago by the House Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, were reported to the House this
afternoon by Hitt of Illinois, the chair
man of the committee. The preamble re
cites the language used by Bayard and
continues:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of
Representatives that Thomas F. Bayard, Am
bassador of the United States to Great Britaiu,
in publicly ixsing the language above quoted,
has committed an offense against diplomatic
propriety and an abuse of the privileges of his
exalted position which should make him the
representative of the whole country and not
of any particular party. Sucn utterances are
wholly inconsistent with the prudent, deli
cate and scrupulous reserve which he himself,
while Secretary of State, enjoined upon
all diplomatic agents of the United
States. In one speech he affronts
the great body of his countrymen
who believed In the policy of protection. In
the other he offends all his countrymen who
believe that Americans are capable of self-gov
ernment; therefore, as the immediate repre
sentative of the American people and in their
name we condemn and censure such utter
ances of Thomas F. Bayard.
Resolved further, That in the opinion of the
House of Representatives, public speeches by
our diplomatic or consular officers abroad
which display partisanship, or which condemn
any political party or party policy, or organi
zation of citizens in the United States, are in
dereliction of the duty of such officers, impair
their usefulness as public servants, and
diminish the confidence which they should
always command at home and abroad.
The report accompanying the resolution
closes with the statement that "Bayard
did make such speeches," and that no ac
tion had been taken thereon." The com
mittee therefore respectfully recommend
the adoption of the resolutions.
GRATITUDE OF VENEZUELA.
It Is Expressed in the Message of Presi-
dent Crespo to the Country's
Congress.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 25.-A dis
patch to the HeraJd from Caracas, Vene
zuela, says: De Francisco Castillo, Min
ister of the Interior, to-day read to Con
gress the message of President Crespo.
The Cabinet was present, but the Presi -
dent did not attend the session.
After referring to the recent revolt, the
condition of the National Guard, and rec
ommending . appropriations for necessary
coast defenses, the message referred to the
boundary dispute with Great Britain, with
particular regard to the attitude of the
United States.
Gratitude, the President said, was due
to that country, for the reason that it had
interfered and had become a powerful
ally of Venezuela when it found the in
tegrity of an American State was gravely
menaced. . Venezuela's rights would be
peaceably maintained, the" President de
clared, if the advice of the United States
should be followed. Â ; '.<â â 
This portion of the message concluded
with - the emphatic .;.' declaration that
Venezuela's debt to the country of Wash
ington could not be estimated, and with
distinct commendation for the part taken
by Mr. Thomas, the United States Min
ister. v-v'. '- , ;*â ;â¢ â¢'â ..- â¢' -

PASSAGE OF THE SEAL BILL.
__ _____
If an Agreement Is Not Reached All

Washington, d. c, Feb. 25.â The
Hoffse to-day entered upon consideration
of the first contested election case in which
there was a division of the Elections Com
mittee upon the findingâ that of Van Horn
vs. Tarsney, from the Fifth District of
Missouri. This was, besides the division
of the committee on political lines, the
separation of one of the members of the
majority, Taylor, (R.) of Ohio, from the
recommendation made by it that the con-
testant, Van Horn, be seated instead of
Tarsney, who now occupies it. He agreed
with the minority, which did not express
an opinion, but recommended that the
case be reopened for a count of the ballots
in the disputed precincts in Kansas City,
where the frauds were committed upon
which action the majority based its recom
mendation.
The adoption of the committee's recom
mendation was advocated by Strode (R.)
of Nebraska in a speech of nearly two and
a half hours, in which he set forth in detail
the extent and character of the frauds
committed, and contended that the condi
tions were such that the returns from the
precinct in question could not be purged
of the taint of fraud, but, as the committee
had found, must be rejected entirely.
Taylor defended his position in au hou s'
speech, which held the attention of the
House throughout and won him many en
comiums from the older members. He
contended that the fraudulent ballots
could be segregated from the honest ones
and that it was the duty of the House to
have this done before passing upon the
contest. He admitted his belief that if the
count was made as he recommended, it
would result in demonstrating the fact
that Van Horn had received a majority or
the legal votes cast.
Before taking up the election case the
House passed the Indian appropriation
bill without further discussion, the para
graph relating to the purchase of the title
of the Ogden Land Company to lands in
the Alleghany and Catteraugus Indian
reservations, in the State of New York, be
ing stricken out by unanimous consent.
Dingley (R.) of Maine called up the bill
introduced by him and unanimously re
ported by the Committee on Ways and
Means relating to the fur seal industry. It
directs the President to enter into negotia
tions with the Governments of Great Brit
ain, Russia and Japan or either of them
for the appointment of a joint commission
to investigate the fur seal industry in all
its bearings and to report what, if any, ad
ditional regulations are necessary for the
preservation of the fur seal herd. It also
provides for the establishment of a modus
Vivendi between the several Governments
under the findings of the Paris tribunal of
1893, respecting the protection of the seals
with a provision that if this modus be not
concluded in time to govern the season of
1896, the Secretary of the Treasury is di
rected to kill every seal that can be reached
on the Pribyloff Islands and sell the skius
for the benefit of the Treasury.
The report of the committee set forth
the necessity of the proposed legisla
tion and the bill was passed unanimously
as it did in the House last Congress.
The House at 5 :05 p. m. adjourned until
to-morrow with a prospect of spending a
day or two in the further discussioa of the
election case.

It is often difficult to convince
people their blood is impure,
until dreadful carbuncles, ab-
scesses, boils, scrofula or salt
rheum are painful proof of the
fact. It is wisdom now, or
whenever there is any indica-
tion of
Impure
blood, to take Hood's Sarsa-
parilla and prevent such erup-
tions and suffering. â¢
â¢ "I had a dreadful carbuncle abscess, red,
fiery, tierce and sore. The doctor attended
me over seven.weeks. When abscess broke
the pains were terrible, and I thought I
should not live through it. I heard and
read so much about Hood's Sarsaparilla
that 1 decided to take it, and my husband,
who was suffering with boils, took it also.
It soon purified our
DIOOCI
bvilt rue up and restored my health, so
that, although the doctor said" I would not
be able to work hard; 1 have since done
the work for 20 people. Hood's Sarsa-
parilla cured my husband of the boils, and
we regard it a wonderful medicine."

BIG RECEPTION
Greeted by the Members
of the Manhattan
Club.
NOTED MEN ATTENDED.
Democrats of Gotham Turn Out
to Welcome the Secretary
of the Treasury.
WAS GLAD TO MEET THEM ALL.
And Then He Took Occasion to Advo
cate Cleveland's " Sound "
Money Principles.
NEW YORK, X. V., Feb. 25.â One of the
most notable receptions ever given a Dub
hc official in this city was accorded John
G. Carlisle, Secretary of the Treasury, by
the Manhattan Club to-night at the club
house. A more representative body of
men than those who gathered to honor the
Secretary could hardly have been gathered
together.
Bankers, merchants, presidents of cor
porations, lawyers, politicians and men
of affairs, each vied with the other to do
honor to the distinguished guest.
The rooms of the club were thronged
when at 9:30 o'clock C. C. Baldwin, Jus
tice Smythe and Secretary Carlisle ap
peared.
There was a round of applause as the
Secretary entered the rooms and he was at
once conducted to the East room, where
the reception was held.
On the right of the Secretary stood Presi
ident Coudert of the Manhattan Club and
to the left stood Edward F. Bell, chairman
of the reception committee, who intro
duced the guests and members as they
pressed forward in a stead}' stream for over
an hour to shake the Secretary's nand.
Every one received a hearty handshake
and "I'm glad to meet you" from the Sec
retary. This continued until nearly 10:30,
when President Coudert, linking arms
with the Secretary, went to the dining
room.
The luncheon was spread in the billiard
room of the club.
President Coudert took his seat at the
center of the guests' table at the head of .
the room, and with him at this table
were Mr. Carlisle, Collector Kilbreth, E.
Bell, J. A. Stewart, W. W. Sher
man, Robert Mackay, C. A. Jordan,
St. Clair McKelway, H. W. Cannon, S.
O Sullivan, G. G. Ward, M. K. Jessup, ex-
Governor Flower, General Ruger, Admiral !
Erben and W. J. Coombs. In a .happy
speech he introduced the guest.
Mr. Carlisle said that his first thanks |
were due to the President and the mem- â 
bers and their guests for the cordial man- j
ncr in which t, l iev had received him.
"I am Â«lad, he said, "to be surrounded 1
by old-iashioned Democrats who have
never repudiated the principles of the
Democratic party oi sound money, just j
and equal taxation, economy in finances
and honesty and fidelity in the discharge
of public duties.
"Ihere has been some objection to these
principles, but they were pood enough for
old-fashioned .Democrats and they are ;
good enough for us. If there is one prin- j
ciple to which they have ever been true it
is that the currency of the people must be
maintained on a sound and equitable basis
and that nothing but specie be made a le
gal tender.
"The Democratic party is not dead, and
the time has not come to distribute its
assets among the Populists and its allies. :
[Applause.] It will never die if it is faith
ful to the principles upon which it was
founded. I hope it will go into the con
test in a perfectly sound declaration of
principles, and if it does it will emerge from
the contest with victory and an unblem- i
ished record."
BOIES' PLEA TOR KILTER.
At the Same Time He Decline* to Run
for President.
DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 25.â Ex-
Governor Horace Boies has written a letter
to the Dcs Moines Leader declining to be a
candidate for the Democratic nomination
for President. He is rinal and positive on
this point.
He says he desires the party in lowa to
send a delegation to the Chicago conven
tion uninstructed and uninfluenced by
local considerations. He says he insists
on construing the platform pledges of the
party for many years as solemn promises
to restore silver to the position assigned to
it by the fundamental Jaw of the Nationâ
as money of redemption ; and he says:
"I conscientiously believe that to neg
lect to do this, both in theory and practice,
is an open, flagrant and continuous viola
tion of the highest law of the land."
This issue, he says, completely obscures
every other. The Democratic party is un
happily divided, and the Republican party
is strongly in favor of the single gold
standard.
Success in the effort to force this standard
on the country, he says, will be the death
knell of prosperity for the struggling
masses. It is impossible that high-priced
iabor and low-priced commodities should
exist together for any length of time.
No combination of men can ever be
made with its object to increase the value
of labor and its products, as the combina
tion of the money powers of the great
commercial centers of the world are to op-
j/o?e that end.
The policy of monometallism means the
issue of $500,000,000 of interest.bearing
bonds to take the place of $500,000,000 of as
pood money as was ever issued.
CLAIM Eli BY A PLASTERER.
A Fast Estate Left by the Son of Lord
lilake.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 25.â A few days
apo dispatches announced the fact that a
rirrn of English attorneys having offices in
I/ondon were seeking to find the heirs to
the vast estate of Francis Blake, a son of
Lord Blake, who died nearly half a cen
tury ago at his family estate near Iloscom
mon, Ireland. The papers published the
btory of Francis Blake's life and it excited
considerable interest.
Now conies James Gavin, a plasterer,
who lives with his family at 4629 Dryer
street, in the town of Lake, who claims
that he is a descendant of the family and
consequently an heir to the estate now
worth nearly $3,000,000. Gavin yesterday
traced his family tree from the BlaHes to
the Gavins ana was fully convinced that
he had not only royal blood coursing
through his veins, but that he had a good
show of getting the money. He claims to
be the grandson of the aunt of Lady Blake
and the nearest of kin.
MISS ILAQLEK PLEADS GUILTI.
Sentenced to Three Hours' Imprisonment
and to Pay a line.
WASHINGTON. d. 0., Feb. 25.â Miss
Elizabeth Flagler, the daughter of General
D.W. Flagler, chief of ordnance of the
United States army, who shot and killed
a colored boy who was stealing pears from
her father's garden, was brought into the
Criminal Court this morning to answer to
the indictment for manslaughter.
The hearing was brief, and resulted in a j
verdict of guilty. Miss Flagler was sen
tenced to three hours in the District jail
and a fine of $500.
i Miss Flagler was indicted on October 31
last year by the District Grand Jury for
killing with two shots from a navy, re
volver Ernest Green, a young colored boy,
who, on August 2, attempted to pick a pear
from a tree in front of her father's house
on California avenue. The jury were nearly
unanimous in their verdict. Miss Flagler
was released on $10,000 bail.
WITH WITHERING SCOBX.
Mrs. Mary I â¢â Â«â Â«<â  Too Busy to Answer
Every "Barking Cur."
WICHITA, Kan?.. Feb. 25.â When Mrs.
Mary Elizabeth Lease was shown the dis
patch, from Detroit to-day saying that
Jerry Simpson said she had never been
anything but a disturbing element in poli
tics, that she always wants to be the great
"I am," and that she is better in the pul
pit than in politics, she said with wither
ing scorn:
"Life is too shori and my time too fully
occupied to pay attention to every barking
cur or step on every worm that crawls
across my path." She says Simpson's at
tack upon her is entirely unprovoked.
There is a strong fight against him in this
district, but Mrs. Lease has taken no part
in it.
JUnhoney Is Receiver.
LEXINGTON, Ya., Feb. 25.â William J.

STABBED BY THE BUTCHER
Ed Hickey, a Chicago Tough,
Made a Fatal Mistake as
a Rohber.
After Being Mortally Wounded He
Was Carried Away by Con
federates.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. 25.â 5. Haas, a
butcher at 2254 Halstead street, was clos
ing up his shop about 8 o'clock this even
ing when a tough character, who was
identified later as Ed Hictev, came in and
said he wanted some meat.
As Haas turned to till the order Hickey
crabbed him by the throat and told him
to give up all the money he had and to do
it quick.
Haa*, who is a powerful man, resisted,
and had just thrown Hickey to the floor
when two masked men rushed In tlie front
door, and, with Hickey's assistance, again
attacked the butcher.
Haas backed away from his antagonists
until he reached his chopping-block, and
just as he grabbed a carving-knife the
three men were upon him.
Before they could floor him, Haas had
sent the blade clear through Hickey's
body, just above the stomach.
This summary act frightened the men,
and helping their partner to the door they
fled. Hickey was fatally wounded and
staggered to Thirty-fifth and Halstead
streets and fell dead just as he entered a
saloon. The other two escaped.
HEAVY LOSSES AT TACOMA.
Two million siiiiiyl'M and a Residence
Destroyed by Flames.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb 25.â Fire broke
out in the dryhousesof the Cushing Young
Shingle Company at Old Tacoma this
morning and destroyed 2,000,000 shingles
together with the dry houses. The total
loss is about $20,000, and the insurance will
not cover 50 per cent.
At 4 o'clock this morning the handsome
residence of Collin Macintosh of South
Tacoma was destroyed by a fire originat

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1896.
MEETING OF THE
BALL MAGNATES.
Completion of the Schedule
for the National
League.
POWER OF THE UMPIRES
It Is Increased So That Miscon
duct Can Be More Se
verely Punished.
FINES AND PROMPT EXPULSION
Disorderly Players Can Now Be
at Once Removed From
the Diamond.
NEW Y.ORK, N. V.. Feb. 25.â T* he an
nual spring meeting of the National League
of professional baseball clubs was brought
to a close to-night at the Fifth-avenue
Hotel.
The league schedule, the formation of
which is always the most important busi
ness of the spring or "schedule meeting,"
as it is generally known, was given out for
publication at a late hour. As a rule, the
Eastern clubs open the season in the East
and the Western clubs in the West.
In future umpires must immediately re
move from the game and field any player
guilty of improper or indecent conduct or
language, instead of having the option of
fining the offender as heretofore. With
regard to coachers or players leaving the
bounds of their positions, the umpire
shall, after the first warning, fine the
offender in a sum of not less than $5 nor
more than $10.
In case of a second violation, a fine of
$25 will be imposed, and for the third of
fense the umpire must positively order tne
player from the game and field.
President Hart of Chicago offered a reso
lution to dispense with the temple cup
series, but the motion waa not enter
tained.
The double umpire system was not dis
cussed, nor was the new member elected
on the board of arbitration.
The latter matter was laid over to the
next meeting of the league, which will be
held in Chicago some time in November.
The other business before the meeting
was of an unimportant nature and the
league adjourned at 5 o'clock.
The minor league magnates were much
perturbed over the action of the National
body in altering the National agreement
in such a manner as to impose new hard
ships on the minor organizations. There
was much bitter feeling among the repre
sentatives and a meeting was held during
the day to consider a course of action. It
was decided to postpone action until the
26th of March, when a meeting will be held
at Washington.
Under the new National agreement on
the aggregate population basis some of
the minor leagues will be forced into
lower classes than those in which they are
now classed.
BASEBALL AT STANFORD.
Juniors Defeated by the Sophomores in a
Ten- Inning Game â A Battle of
Pitchers.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
25. â The finest baseball game of the season
took place this afternoon on the campus
between the classes of '97 and '98, and was
won by the latter team. The work of both
pitchers was of the professional order, and
for ten innings the two men held out.
The eco re at the end of the tenth inning
was 11 to 7. Up to the seventh inning
the juniors haa the lead, but in that
inning the score was tied, and the excite
ment among the rival factions that lined
the diamond became intense. For two
innings after the seventh neither side
could score, but in the beginning of the
tenth the juniors became rattled and
threw wild, with the result that the sopho
mores tallied five times.
The infield did much better work than
the outfield. The battery work of both
nines was of a high order. The juniors'
battery consisted of Ruddell and Osgood,
while Whipple and Jeffs did work for the
sophomores. Two home runs were made,
one by Arnold and the other by Yonng.
The championship inter-class game
takes place Friday between the seniors
and the sophomores.

CORBETT IS HEFIANT.
Dare* Fitzsimmon* to Meet Him for
Any Sum.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. Feb. 25.â Upon
learning this evening Fitzsimmons' objec
tion to accepting the Bolingbroke Club's
$8000 offer on the ground that the amount
of the purse was too small, Corbett wired
Fitzsimmons a proposition to bet him as a
side stake any amount from $1000 up to
$100,000. Corbett said to-night:
"FiUsimmons' agreement to the second
postponement at El Paso resulted from
the decision of a 'jury' of sporting men.
A jury must decide if he is afraid to light
me or not, or if he has any sensible excuse
for not doing it. I don't think the size of
the purse or any side bet is being consid
ered by the Australian, because he knows
that all he will get out of the encounter
will be a good hard whipping and the
loser's end of the purae."
ARBACES LOSES AN EYE.
Seriout Misfortune to a Full Ilrother of
the ltacehorte litgga.
WOODLAND, Oal., Feb. 25.â Irvin
Diggs, who recently sold Button for $3000,
met with a streak of bad luck yesterday.
He has a yearling colt, a full brother to
Diggs and Sutton, which he calls Arbaces.
This youngster is a very valuable animal,
and is fully as promising as either of hia
older brothers. Yesterday Mr. Diggs
found that the colt had cut the ball of one
eye, and that sight had been destroyed.
In searching for the cause, he found a
strand of barbed wire three or four feet in
length stretched on the paddock fence at
one place. He has no doubt but that Ar
baces gouged his eye out on one of the
barbs. The injury may probably not in
terfere with the running qualities of the
colt, but it will certainly injure his sale.

CHICAGO, III., Feb. 25.â H. M.Greene,
a wealthy broker who has been operating
on the Chicago Board of Trade for several
years, was expelled by the board of direc

to appear for trial on the same charge two
months ago he showed tight by securing a
temporary injunction against the direc

TRAGEDY AT SACRAMENTO
Suicide of a Man Who Feared
That His Reason Was
Tottering.
Lefi a Letter In Which He Declared
That He Preferred Death to
the Asylum.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 25.â D. J.
Brooks, who for several years past has
been connected with the firm of Hall,
Luhrs & Co., committed suicide this
afternoon by shooting himself in the
month with a revolver, the ball passing
out through the top of his head.
His body was discovered shortly after
ward by his landlady, Mrs. Menke, who
went to his room to deliver a telegram
which had come for him. It lay on a bed,
with a revolver clutched in the right hand.
In a pocket of his coat was the following
letter, addressed to the Coroner:
Friend George: My father and elder brother
both died In an insane asylum from soKening
of the brain In the last year. I am satisfied
that lam the next victim. 1 don't propose to
die in any asylum. I shall cut the Gordian
knot and fly to the ills we know not of. Yours,
Brooks.
The deceased leaves a widow and child,
the latter being a protege of Mrs. Green,
mother of Will S. Green of the Colusa Sun,
in whose family she resided for years. For
the last six months Mrs. Brooks has been
in poor health.
She has been visitinc in Colusa County,
and a few days ago her husband received
a letter from her which he claimed con
tained bad news. This missive is probably
in some way connected with the cause of
his committing suicide.
Mr. Brooks was a prominent member of
the Masonic fraternity and served with
distinction during the late war. Mrs*
Brooks is a superior woman, highly edu
cated and refined.

SANTA BARBARA
FRAUDS EXPOSED.
Professional Beggars Who
Have Been Enriched by
Charity.
SOLD THE DONATIONS.
Gifts From Philanthropic Citi
zens Disposed of in
Other Cities.
LIVED IN LUXURIOUS STYLE.
Profligacy of the Seemingly Penniless
Itinerants Revealed by an
Investigation.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 25.â A
trio of as sleek professional beggars as
ever traded upon the sympathy of a com
munity has been operating among the
upper circles of Santa Barbara society for
the past five months. The fraud they
have practiced hp.s just been uncovered,
and it is believed they have become hun
dreds of dollars richer through the mis
directed philanthropy of Santa Barbara
citizens.
An elderly French woman named Le
Febre with a putative daughter, Mrs. Rob
erts, a young woman of decidedly Scotch-
Irish cast, the latter's husband and four
young children, came to this city last fall.
Mrs. Le Febre professed to be looking for
French scholars to teach, although her in
dustry and gifts have been chiefly directed
in other directions.
Son-in-law Roberts was a civil engineer
who was sent to the World's Fair to run
an engine used with the captive scenic
balloon, but who has since been out of an
engagement, Mme. Le Febre everywhere
told a tale of poverty and woe, with the
result that charitable women united to
sustain the family, paying rent, sending
wagonloads of supplies of all sorts.donating
money and hiring a trained nurse to carry
the young woman through sickness, and
raising money to pay the passage of her
husband to Guatemala. With a house
overflowing with eatables and clothing and
comforts of every kind, donated by sympa
thizers, the old woman industriously
worked the city, going from person to per
son with her tale of distresa, and every
where receiving generous aid.
The extent of the woman's schemes has
just become known. She offered donated
garments for sale and shipped others to a
Stockton woman. She has assistants
working the country districts, gathering
food, groceries, clothing and money, the
same pitiful tale oi want being everywhere
repeated.
During the young woman's illness, it
was discovered, numerous trunks were
brought to them, already tilled with elabo
rate underwear and rich clothing, while
the grossest waste was going on within
the household, whole loaves of bread being
burned and preserves thrown away.
Interesting incidents could be recounted
of how the family spurned Mrs. Admiral
Harmon's best curtains; of how the kind
offur of Mrs. Gaty, wife of the manager of
the Arlington, to supply left-over meats
was taicen advantage of, with a written or
der for so much butter, sugar, tea, etc.; of
an honest little neighbor, the mother of a
family of children, the wife of a struggling
mechanic, obliged to deny her own little
ones butter upon their bread, but who was
imposed upon for loans of every sort to the
seemingly penniless family.
The community at last awoke, investi
gations were quietly conducted, and it was
proved that this family's operations in
Santa Barbara were but a repetition of
what has been carried on for years in other
places, notably Chicago anu San Francisco.
They were helped a^way from these cities
by people who wished to shirk the burden
of their support. They have been grow
ing rich upon the charity of others, and
now that they will be ejected from Santa
Barbara, some other unfortunate commu
nity will probably contribute to their bank
account.
SHU'MEXTS TO BTOCKTOX.
Expensive Millinery Jillla Paid Out of
Madame I .<â¢ Febre'a Donation*.
STOCKTON, Cal.. Feb. 24.â Mrs. Sarah
Avey of 477 North Hunter street, in this
city, who has been accused of receiving
goods from Madame Le Febre and daugh
ter, the Santa Barbara swindlers, was seen
to-night by a Call correspondent.
Mrs. Avey promptly acknowledged an
acouaintanceship with the madame, but
when asked if she had been receiving any
goods from Santa Barbara, said :
"If there is anything wrong, I do not
want to get my friend in trouble."
Bhe was pressed for an explanation as to
her connections with the woman, and
said:
"Mrae, Le Febre is no kin to me, and
I became acquainted with her while she
was teaching French in this city. lam
a dressmaker, and she ordered several
dresses from my place.
"I never got a cent of money out of her
I in payment and accepted second hand
clothing, which I made over for my chil
dren. On the 10th of last December I was
surprised to receive a large sack filled with
dresses and other clothing which had been
worn, but was still quite valuable.
"A letter accompanied the box, and I
replied, thanking the madame for her kind
ness to me. I never asked her for the
clothing and did not even know where
i she had gone. On the 20th of January 1
| received another consignment. That is
positively all the goods I received."
Detective Oscar Marshall, who accom
panied the correspondent, asked to see the
clothing, and Mrs. Avey demanded by
I what authority he made the request. He
replied that it was at her own option to do
so, and that it was merely to give her an
opportunity to verify her statements.
The lady then exhibited several gar
ments which she said she had received
from the madame. She said she had
never asked for any of them, and that
they were all she got from the French
teacher for her work. Mrs. Avey has
resided here for some time with her sister,
and, in default of any further information
on the subject, the officers accept her story
as true. _____________

Credulous.
SKILLED IN LEGERDEMAIN.
Sufferers Made to Believe That They
Had Been Cured of Mythical
Ailments.
SAN JOSE, Cat.., Feb. 25.â After two
years jf continuances the charge of prac
ticing medicine without a license against
1.-. Luis Viscayo was dismissed by Judge
l,orijran this morning on motion of the
District Attorney, as it seemed impossible
ire a conviction.
Dr. Viscayo came to this city about two
years ago from Mexico. He hung out a
gaudy sign with "Dr. Luis Viscayo, Eel
minthologist," upon it, and for a time
shekels rolled into his pockets, as he guar
anteed a cure or no pay. The doctor was
something of a legerdemainist, and after
giving his p;itients a dose of his cure-all lie
would produce a variety of angleworms
aiid small reptiles and felicitate tne patient
upon having severed relationship with the
collection. Some were inclined to doubt
the doctors word, but a second treatment
and a second addition to the menagerie
convinced them that what he said must be
true.
Viscayo was finally arrested on com
plaint of George Bellamy, who alleged
that the doctor had procured $10 from his
wife on false pretenses. Mrs. Bellamy al
leged that Viscayo had treated her little
son and that on one occasion lie exhibited
a handful of angleworms and tried to con
vince her they were miniature members of
the Bothrioeepbalus family with which the
boy had parted company. The doctor had a
small gopher-snake and many were the
sufferers who gazed upon the reptile and
shuddered at the thought of the close
companionship it had forced upon them
until they had met the man of science.
This snake was used only in the case of
rich patients, who usually paid handsome
fees, while their thankfulness lasted. For
months the doctor gave entire satisfaction
in every case.
After Viscayo's arrest the State Medical
Society was very active in his prosecution
for practicing medicine without a license.
It tried in every way to procure sufficient
evidence to convict ana now, after two
years of delays, the case has been dis
missed. The doctor left town some time
ago and is evidently practicing legerde
main in greener pastures.

LARKIN HEIR FOUND AT VIENTO.
End of a Long Search for the Quartet
Entitled to the Estate of the
Californian.
PORTLAND, 0r.., Feb. 25.-After a
search extending over several months, and
during which time it was necessary to twice
traverse almost the whole United States the
fourth missing heir to the William Lar'kin
estate in California has just been discov
ered near Viento, Or., in the Cascade
Mountains. A local paper prints a story
to the effect that the search for the
rightful heirs of Larkin has ended,
and that the lawyers engaged in the
case will make a hot fight to estab
lish the claims of the heirs, three of whom
Â»re in Ohio. Their names are Frances
William R. and Mary E. Fox, children of
Larkin's sister, who married a soldier
named Fox at St. Louis.
It is stated by a man who worked up the
case that one of the heirs in the East is of un
sound mind, and tbe Oregon heir is also un
balanced from a bullet-wound in the head,
received in the army. One of the girls in
Ohio is mentally unsound, and it is on this
point that the probate of the Larkin will will
be fought, as there is a law in California to
the effect that if no contest is made within
a year's time the will of decedent shall
stand, excepting in cases of infant heirs or
persons of unsound mind, who have a
claim to the estate. Now thru Larkin's
nieces and nephews have been discovered
steps will be taken at once to contest the
probate of the will and establish the claim
of the four heirs.
Larkin died two years ago, leaving all his
wealth to stranaers. His sister's children
are his only kin so far as known.
MARIN COUNTY CANDIDATES.
A Lively Campaign for the Supervisorship
Begun â Many Aspirants for
the Honor.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Feb. 25.â The poli
Heal battle for Supervisor from the south-
em part of Marin County is assuming
rather a peculiar aspect on account of the
unusually large number of aspirants for
the position. Even the political leaders
seem confused.
The incumbent, Jacob Gardner, says
that he is undecided whether to run again
or not, but he is generally considered a
candidate for nomination.
AVheerler Martin, the postmaster at
Eastland, in Mill Valley, has expressed a
desire for the position. Commodore Har
rison of Sausalito is a likely candidate.
Mill Valley has another man in the per
son of J. H. Mclnnes, formerly a contrac
tor in San Francisco.
Mr. Mclnnes has publicly stated that he
intends to place liis name before the Re
publican convention. In fact, the Repub
licans are the only ones in the field thus
far, although A. Sylvais believed to be the
choice of the few Democratic voters in the
southern part of the county.
The question of whether" the school ap
propriation should be raised sufficiently
to keep the imtrtfc schools open longer
than eight niontfcs out of every twelve is
the main issue upon which the light is to
be made, although the question'of eood
roads is considered very important.
As 10 Superior Judne there appears
to be no opposition to Frank M. Angelotti.
j He has occupied, the position of District
i Attorney for four years and that of Supe
j rior Judge for six years. The Battle is be
ing fought for the position of Supervisor,
j.and on account of the multiplicity of
. aspirants there is considerable feeling be
! ing shown.
FRESNO ELECTION FRAUDS
Corrupt Methods of Candidates
May Be Aired in a Suit
at Court.
George W. Smith's Race for the
Shrievalty and His Promises to
a Supporter.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 25.â A suit on ap
peal from the Justice's Court, now being
heard in Judpe Carter's department" of the
Superior Court here, involves some ques
tions of great delicacy, in which George
W. Smith, the Democratic candidate for
Sheriff of this county, is the defendant,
Judge W. D. Crichton the go-between and
Jacob Hocken berry the plaintiff.
The suit is to recover $242, with interest
since the campaign of 1894.
In that year of Democratic disasters
Smith was the candidate of his party
against Jay Scott, the present Sheriff of
Fresno County. Hocken berry had some
surplus money, which he "loaned" to the
defendant to help him out.
Smith acknowledges that he got some
money from the plaintiff, but did not re
gard it as a loan and never Intended to
pay it back.
Crichton, who negotiated the "loan,"
went on the stand to-day to tell what he
knew about the transaction.
He at first declined to testify, on the
grounds that his testimony might incrim
inate himself, but waÂ» prevailed upon by
the court to make his statement. Rein g a
lawyer, his testimony was exceedingly
guarded.
He admitted, however, that he received
money from Hockenberry and gave it to
Smith, and when questioned as to whether
thero was an implied or expressed promise
of official reward in case Smith was'elected,
said there was no promise, but it was un
derstood that Smith would grant a deputy
ship to any one lie (the witness) might
designate.
The case is attracting a creat deal of at
tention among local politicians. Whether
it will be concluded without betraying a
felonious disregard cf ihe purity of the
elections act by the parties concerned, is
problematical.
1-RESHO'S lIAIiJUT DRIVE.
Corral and JFentes Jiuilt Preparatory to
the Slaughter.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 25.â The great
rabbit drive and slaughter planned for
next Saturday a few miles west of this
city promises to attract people for scores
of miles in every direction.
A carral has been built and two lines of
lath-fe:icing stretches at an acute angle
from this pen for miles. Men on horse
back have been scouring the country, giv
inc instructions and orders for the event.
These drives often result in the slaugh
ter of thousands of jack rabbits. The
pests are said to be more numerous than
in any previous year, and in consequence
and immense killing is predicted.
The drives are conducted by mounted
officers, who require military precision and
promptness of action. Neither dogs nor
guns are permitted. Clubs are the only
weapons and the army of "rushers" is al
ways afoot.

VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. 2o.â F. A. Hol
brook of San Francisco, special officer for
the prevention of cruelty to children, came
up to Vallejo this morning and returned
this afternoon, having under his charge
two young girls named Ella Burke and
Florence Gifford, who, through the mis
representations of a woman known as
"Tillie" Hill, came here Saturday evening
presumably to secure employment in a
restaurant.
Instead they were enticed into a dis
orderly house, from which they were res

hotel until friends could arrive from San
Francisco. The proprirtor of the house,
William Collins, is under arrest. He and
the woman will be prosecuted to the ex
tent of the law.
The Hill woman decamped on Monday
afternoon, but is expected to be brought

LIVERMORE, Cal., Feb. 25.â Burglars
entered the large grocery and -hardware

They secured about a dozen pocket-knives
and a few dollars in change that had been
left in the money-drawer. No attempt
was made to open the safp. It is believed
that the burglars became frightened while
at work, as they left their entire kit of
tools scattered about tbe office floor.

SACHEM DEAD
Aged Chief Gil Loses His
Life in a Brush
Blaze.
HEMMED IN BY FIRE.
Indian Companions Say That the
Old Man Could Not Fight
His Way Out.
THEIR STORY IS DOUBTED.
San Diego's Coroner Suspects Foul Play
and Will Investigate the
Tragedy.
SAN DIEGO, Cat,., Feb. 25.â Chief Gil,
at the head of a small raneheriaof Indians
living in Mission Valley, was burned to
death to-day a few miles north of the city.
He had been engaged with his son and two
other men at grubbing a piece of land.
They piled the brush in long rows, and
Chief Gil in some manner became sur
rounded by the fire before ho knew it.
Being aged and infirm, lie did not have
the strength to fight his way out. This is
the story as told by the other Indians, who
went to the village of Morena and informed
the ranchers there.
Coroner Johnson went out and viewed
the scene and secured the body, bringing
it to the city this evening. As he was
passing through Old San Diego he was al
most mobbed by a lot of Indians and
Mexicans, who insisted on keeping the
body of the chief at Old Town.
The Coroner finally managed to get
away from the crowd, and brought the
body to the morgue. It is black and un
recognizable, the flesh being completely
cooked, and a hasty examination failed to
show anything suspicious in the manner
of death.
Coroner Johnson, however, said that the
quantity of brush seemed so small that he
could not understand how the chief had
been burned unless he had been prevented
by others. An inquest will be held to
morrow morning.

UNITED IN GAY GOTHAM.
Marriage of Miss Carrie D. Huntington to
Edmund Burke Holladay of
This City.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 25.â Mr. and
Mrs. Collis P. Huntington's new residence,
at the southeast corner of Fifth avenue
and Fifty-seventh street, which was taken
possession of by its owner only a few days
ago, was this afternoon the scene of the
wedding of Mr. Huntington's niece, Miss
Carrie D. Huntington. daughter of the late
Solon Huntington, to Mr. Edmund Burke
Holladay of San Francisco.
The white and siold Louis XV salon,
where the marriage ceremony was per
formed, was handsomely decoraced with
flowers. The Rev. Dr. Frank Clendenin,
rector of S.t. Paul's Church, was the offici
ating clergyman.
The bride, who was given away by her
uncle, wore heavy white satin ornamented
with point lace. Her veil was of tulle,
and it was confined to the coiffure by a
wreath of orange blossoms and some
handsome diamonds, presents from Mr.
Holladay and Mr. Huntington.
There were neither bridesmaids nor
ushers.
A seated breakfast, served in the dining
room, followed the ceremony. Included
among the guests were A. M. Hunting
ton, Dr. and Mrs. William B. Coley,
Mrs. Solon Huntington (mother of

Independent Agencies.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 25.â The receivers
of the St. Louis and San Francisco Road
announced to-day that after March 1 next
they would establish independent aeencies
at. Chicago, Cincinnati, New York and
Pittsburg.
The New York agent is W. L. Van Nest,
H. B. Franklin at Cincinnati, and 0. M.
Conley at Pittsbu rg. This action indi
cates that the receivers have decided to
operate the road independently of the
Santa Fe interests.
From the time the Santa Fe went into
the hands of the Federal court a faction of
the San Francisco stockholders has been
insisting on a severance of relations with
the big system, claiming that profit would
result, and tins view seems 10 have been
adopted by the receivers since the judicial
saie of the Santa Fe property.
TAILORS ORGANIZE.
All Branches of the Trade Stand for
Better Treatment.
The garment-makers of this City are
organizing a strong protective trades
union, the power of which will be felt in
the near future. Three weeks ago twenty -
hve tailors Ueld a preliminary meeting and
decided to form a union. The tailors met
again last evening, but instead of twenty
five there were 125 or more present.
Samuel Schwartz was selected as chair
man and H. Stark was selected as secre
tary. At present J. Goodman is the organ
izer.
The union will be permanently or
ganized as soon as it receives its charter
Philip Lee Bush, Son of Colonel 11. P. Bush, Who Has Just Been Appointed Aid
de-Camp on the Staff of Governor Budd, With Hank of Lieutenant-Colonel.
[From a photograph.]
from the International Garment-workeTs'
Union, the headquarters of which is in
New York. Then a full board of officers
will be elected.
T. F. Burns and Mr. Milne, the organiz
ing committee of the Trades Council, were
present ana urged the tailors to form a
strong union and affiliate with the other
labor organizations.
I. Masomck made a strong address, in
which he said the union will include all
branches of garment-workers â vest-mak
ers, pantaloon-makers, coat-makers and
helpers.
More than that, women will be admitted
into the union upon an equal footing with
the men, and a stand will be taken to see
that their hours are reduced from fourteen
to eight. More than that, their wages
will be increased the same as the men's. At
present all are working for only sufficient
to keep body and eotil together, he said,
and an open demand for better and more
humane treatment will not result in any
thing worse. His remarks were received
with approval.
CLAIM TO SANTA
BARBARA LAND
James McMahon's Story Is
Investigated at the
Mission.
PORTIONS ARE PROVED.
A Brother of the Claimant
Found to Have Lived at
the Monastery.
CAME WEST IN THE SIXTIES.
The Records Show That He Had
Commenced to Study for the
Priesthood.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 25. -The
claim of James McMahon to the property
of the old Santa Barbara Mission, now
valued at 115,000,000, may not be as un
founded as Father lieguarius and his as
sociates at the old n<onastery intimated
yesterday. McMahon had stated that his
brother John, an ex-priest and inmate of
the monastery years ago, had obtained title
to all the mission property; that the title
was still vested in his name and that he
could advance ample proof to support his
present claim to f.his vast church estate.
Yesterday Father Reguarius denied that
any one by the name of McMahon had
ever been an inmate of the monastery.
It seems that he and the venerable Father
Forbes had relied entirely upon their
memory. They decided to-day to verify
their statement by a search of the records,
and the result proved they were in error
in making 1 the declaration they did.
The records show that in 18(53 and 1864
John McMahon was actually present, not
as a priest, but as a lay-brother of the
Franciscan order. He is now recalled as a
man of about 40 years of age, who desired
to enter the priesthood but became dis
couraged on account of the severe course
of study required and his already ad
vanced years.
He did not speak Spanish, the prevail
ing language of the locality at that time,
and was never interested in any way in
the property of the mission. The father
states that McMahon was one of six who
arrived at the same time from Brooklyn,
N. V., where they had some disagreement
with Bishop Laughlin.
The discovery of these facts corroborates
James McMafron's statement, published
in last Sunday's Call, in all but the very
important claim that he is the rightful
owner of the mission property.
BUDD'S NEWAID-DE-CAMP
Philip Lee Bush, Son of Colonel
H. P. Bush, Appointed by
the Governor.
Now Senior Captain of the University
Battalion â Long Connected
With the N. G. C.
Governor Budd has appointed Philip
Lee Bush as aid-de-camp on his staff with
rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.
The new aid, who is the son of Colonel
H. P. Bush, is a native of San Francisco.
He is quite a promising young soldier and
tactician, standing high in his military
| and engineering studies at the State Uni
i versity, from which he will graduate this
j spring.
He has been for several years connected
i with the National Guard, "was a cadet cor
; poral in the famous High School Cadets
I subsequently transferred to Company H*
I First Infantry, where he served as corporai
I and sergeant, and as sergeant-major on the

He is at present senior captain of the
University Battalion, and his appointment
is another remembrance on the part of the
Governor of the claims of his alma mater
A VITICULTURAL DISPLAY.
It Will Be a Feature of the Board of
Trade Exhibit.
The viticultural display at the new-
State Board of Trade rooms at 16 Post
street will be upon a grander scale than
erer before, because it will to some extent
be under the care of the nÂ«w Viticultural
College. When the old State Viticultural
Commission went out of existence on the
lirst of the year the college arose from the
ashes of the defunct State institution.
The members of the old commission and
many prominent wine-makers and '.>isin
growers of the State are moving spirits in
! the new corporation. After turning over
the property belonging to the State the
i members of the commission still retained
i the library, which is conceded to beorie of
. the best, if not the best, on subjects of the
vine of any in the world.
At the last meeting of the State Board
of Trade a committee from the Viticultural
I College made a request for sufficient space
|in the Post-street quarters where the
library could be installed and the wine
men have an office and a general ren
j dezvous for all visiting vitieulturists. A
j committee consisting- of Messrs. Irish, Lc
long and Manager J. A. Filcher was ap
pointed to look into the proposition. The
committee found that their general display
j of Stare products will be largely increased
| by the viticuitural display that will be
aaded by the college. The" latter body will
make a larce display of wines, raisins,
grapes and everything pertaining to that
department. The Board of Trade has al
ready a large quantity of these products
and with those coming the projected dis
play will be the largest ever made of the
vine products of this State.
SPRING VALLEY SECRETS
Max Popper Says Supervisors
Fell Repeatedly Through
Bribes.
Discussion on Public Ownership by
the Union far Practical
Progress.
The Union for Practical Progress met
last evening at 621 O'Farrell street and
heard James S. Reynolds and Morrison I.
Swift talk upon "municipal ownership."
Mr. Reynolds said he was against mu
nicipal ownership unleÂ£3 it could be done
by taking the ground rent to pay for it, be
cause if the principle resulted in a saving,
the landlord only would receive the bene
fit. Better water service, just like better
streetcar service, he held, would simply
raise the rent. Consumers of water would
gain nothing, while the owners of the land
would.
Mr. Swift said that public ownership
could be secured through a political and
social organization. The people should
unite on a broad basis to bring about a
social revolution peacefully, and it that
we^e not done Mr. Swift feared the revo
lution wouli come with bloodshed. The
desired end could not be gained by the
single tax. in which he declared there was
not one-tenth the interest as there was in
socialism in America.
Mr. Hansborough of Castroville stated
by request that a proposition had been
made to supply San Francisco with 21,
--, 000.000 to 36,000,000 gallons of water daily
I from Castroville for $7, 500,000. This in
! eluded plant, pipes and delivery of the
j water. The amount now paid to the water
! company by the City would in ten years
i pay off the bonds on' this estimated sum
and the City would have free water be
sides. The plant could be operated for 10
j per cent of what the Spring Valley Com
pany claims to expend in that direction.
Max Popper was present in the role of
listener, but the chairman asked him for
j an opinion on the question of municipal
ownership.
"I agree with the gentlemen, that this
City should have its own water works," he
said. "I have studied all these questions
i from a practical point of view â I have no
| time for theorizing. So I can only present
| practical views on the practical question
! of Kan Francisco owning its own water
' works.
"The water rates of this City are un
questionably higher than in any other
city of the United States, excepting New
Orleans, where, I understand, they are
about equal to ours. New Orleans suffers
from private ownership.
"The greatest temptation to the Board
of Supervisors has come from the Spring
Valley Company. It should be removed
from tne local legislative body. Time and
again we have elected men upon their
pledges that they would perform their
duty to the people, and they fell under
this temptation.
"The Spring Valley "Water Company
ljas watered its stock to an extent out of
all reason. The worfcs never cost so much
as it claims. In its statement to the Su
pervisors we are informed that some
twenty odd millions are invested in the
works. In the Assessor's statement the
total amount is somewhere between one
and two millions.
"For practical purposes we may say
$1,500,000. This clearly indicates tha'tthey j
are not telling the truth. The City should
b&T6 bought the water works from the j
Spring Valley Company years ago, but
now, with watered stock and fictitious
values placed upon the property, purchase
is out of the question.
"If the gentleman from Castroville can
supply the City for $7,500,000 it is a reve- ;
lation, and I for one am certainly in favor â 
of giving this question support. lam in â 
favor of San Francisco owning its own i
waterworks." I

r:NARROW ESCAPE
OF THE QUEEN
The Steamer Was in Col
lision With the Bark
Strathdon.
HAPPENED ON THE BAY
Captain Green and His Lookouts
Could Not See Ten Feet
Ahead.
A VERY DENSE FOG PREVAILED
Owing to Detention for Necessary
Repairs the Damages Will
Amount to $50,000.
The terrible fatality which accompanied
the collision between the Occidental and
Oriental Steamship Company's Oceanic
The Steamer Queen and the British Bark Strathdon in Collision Off Lombard-Street Wharf Yesterday Morning. The Starboard Side of the Steamer From the Bridge to
the After-House Was Almost Dismantled. The Bark Lost Her Bowsprit and Headgear.
and the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's City of Chester about eight years
ago wa3 vividly recalled yesterday. It
was just such another morning and just
about the same time of the year, The fog
on each occasion was so ttiick that the
lookout could not see ten feet ahead.
When the Pacitic Coast Steamship Com
pany's crack steamer Queen started to
feel her way into port yesterday morning
Captain Green had her under a slow bell,
and being sure of his ship, never thought
for an instant of danger. It was a little
before 7 a. m., and the tide was running in
strong. It carried the Queen along at a
greater rate than was calculated upon and
before either captain, crew or passengers
could realize their danger the steamer
was across the iron bark Strathdon's bows
and the latter' 3 bowsprit was raking fore
and aft.
Luckily the lookout on the Queen gave a
warning'cry. and Captain Green managed,
in a measure, to sheer off. He also pave
the signal to the engine-room to stop and
go full speed astern. By his presence of
mind an awful catastrophe was probably
averted. Had the Queen struck the .Strath
don farr and square on her starboard quar
ter the chances are that either one or the
other of the vessels would have pone down.
In the darkness it is doubtful whether any
of the people could have been rescued, as
the fog hung as close as a blanket to the
waters of the bay.
As it was things are bad enough. The
Strathdon lost part of her bowsprit, and
the remainder is so bent and shattered that
it will have to be replaced. Three of the
j..ates in tier bow are strained, and the
j.rospects are that she will have to dock ior
repairs. As the vessel was loaded with
wheat for England and had all her crew
aboard, this will entail an expense that
Will run into at least $15,000.
When the Queen emerge! from the
r.oLlision her starboard side looked like a
wreck. From the pilot-house to the after
iiouae on the hurricane-deck there was
almost a complete -sweep made by the
bowsprit of the bark. Starting with the
end of the bridge, which was partly car
ried away, the work of destruction swept
aft. Three of the staterooms on the
hurricane-deck were wrecked. The next
sweep carried away two'of the boats and
the davits in which they swung. The
boats were stove in and tlue. heavy iron
davits &l once took them to the bottom.
The two vessels kept grinding together
and the Strathdon's bowsprit next car
ried away the two after boats, one of
which hunc to the martingale of the
bark and another was crushed between
the two vessels. All the stanchions and
railing for over 150 feet went at the same
time, and the big sailing-vessel's bow
sprit was up against the dome over the
dining-hall of the Queen.
Tnis dome is said to have been the pride
of every crew that ever worked on the
slap. The cost of it is said to have been
over $7500, as' Henry Viliard, who built
the steamer for a yacht in the palmy days
when he was the presiding genius of the
-Northern Pacific Railroad, wanted to have
tne vessel perfect in every detail. When
the bowsprit of the Strathdon struck that
(tone it did not take long to destroy it.
lhe brass rods that protected it were
swept away, there was a crash of falling
glass, and that was the last of the dome.
A oout the last thinj; to be swept away on
the hurricane deck was a standard com
pass, which was twisted into all kinds of
shapes, and will never be of any use again.
Standing rigping and ventilators shared
in the general destruction, and the hurri
cane deck looked as though it had been
struck by a cyclone.
W tiile the bowsprit was doing its work
on the upper deck the martingale or "dol
phin striker 1 ' was wrecking the lover
deck. Railing, stanchions, benches and
everything within reach was swept away
and only slender rods of iron, that bent to
pressure put upon them, were left to ahow
what had once*been the bulwark of the
Queen. Strange to say there were no acci
dents. An elderly gentieman from Port
land was struck on the head by a falling
timber but only received a scalp wound.
One of the cabin boys was cut by some fall
ing K'ass but his injuries are only super
ficial. Outside of these no one suffered
except from the severe shock.
â  When the collision happ-ned everybody
was on deck and as soon as the passengers
heard the crash there was a panic. They
all made a rush to escape ami fortunately
succeeded. Captain Green soon calmed
their fears and after that everything was
quiet and. orderly until the vessel docked.
The cabin passengers on the Queen were
as follows:

Soon after the vessel was docked a care
ful examination was made, and it was
then seen that the deckhouses,, both fore
and aft, had been moved out of plumb
and would Jiave to be practically rebuilt.
The concise report of the collision, made
by M. Fitzgerald of the Merchants' Ex
change, is as follows:
The steamer Queen, inland bound from
Portland, collided with the British bark
.Strathdon, anchored in the stream off Lombara
street, at 7 o'Hock thiÂ« morning. The Queen
had about 150 leet of rail on starboard side,
stanchions and staterooms, from third officer's
roomjaft to the hurricane deck, and dome car
ried away, lost four boats with contents and
dsvitsand other damages. The bark Strath
don had jibboom and headgear carried away.
Captain Green gives the following ac
count of the trip of the Queen: '"We left
the Columbia River last SuDday," he said,
'and from the start had to contend against
a Heavy fog. In spite of this obstruction
we made splendid time down the coast
and ou Monday night .we were off the
Golden Gate. "It was then as thick as
mush, so I determined to stand off and on
until morning. The fog seemed to get
thicker and thicker as daylight approached
a.ul Dually, about (j o'clock, I determined
to make for port.
"It was ali clear sailing in spite of the
fog until we were abreast of B.lack Point.
Then the engines were slowed down and
from that time on everybody was on the
gui vive. I had three men stationed in
the bow and others on the port and star
board quarters. One of the quartermasters
was with me on the bridge and every one of
us was straining every sense to see or hear
what was before us. Suddenly one of the
men at the bow called out, "A vessel rignt
ahead, sir." I could not see any vessel as
it was impossible to see ten feet in any
direction. However, I ordered the wtieel
over thinking to clear everything but
failed. Instead of being right atiead the
Strathdon, as I afterward learned was
lying with her bow north-northeast and
was therefore on our starboard bow. When
I first saw her we were about to cross the
bark's bow and were right on top of her.
The engines were reversed and we went
full speed astern, but it was too late and
the solli^ion occurred. It was all over iv.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1896.
a few minutes and after reassuring the
passengers I docked the Queen."
Chief Officer E. D. Parsons was in "the
eyes of the ship" wnen the collision oc
curred. "I and two of the sailors were on
the lookout," he said, "Whether the bell
on the Strathdon was ringing or not I can
not swear, but I think it was not. We
were only a few feet away before we struck
and then the bell rang oiit merrily. ]t was
awful hard lines after such a successful
trip under such unfavorable circumstances
to wind up with a disaster at the last."
Fred Hey wood, the purser, had a narrow
escape. He was in one of the staterooms
swept by the jibboom of the Strathdon
and had only gone on deck about two
minutes before the collision took place.
"As it was," said he, "I got a pretty good
scare and lam only too thankful that it
was not a worse one."
Captain Phillips Jr. of the Strathdon is
confident that the bell on his vessel was
rinsing and that vigorously when the
Queen was hearing down on him. He says
that when the big steamer loomed up he
at once began paving out chain and had it
not been for that fact his vessel migtnhave
been cut m two. Later in the day Captains
Metcalf, Thayer and Attwood, marine sur
veyors, went' out to the bark and decided
that she would have to dock for repairs.
At Goodall, Perkins & Co.'s it was
learned that the docking of the Columbia
would be delayed and that she will
go out in place of the Queen. The
Portland mechanics made an excellent
job of the Columbia's rudder oost and she
is now as good as ever. Captain Goodall
is in hopes that the Queen will be fully
repaired by the time the Columbia re
turns to port. Then the latter will go on
the drydock and the former will resume
her run.
The Queen has been one of the most un
fortunate and withal one of the finest
vessels that has plied on the Pacific Coast.
As before stated, she was built for Henry
Villard, then a millionaire, and t\ as named
the "Queen of the Pacific." While out
with' an excursion party Viilard's captain
ran the vessel on the rocks and she sank.
After she was purchased by the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company she started one
day for southern ports with a full cargo
aboard. One of the portholes had been
left open and the vessei had to be raced
for Port Harford, whero she sank a few
minutes after all hands had been landed.
In Autrust, 1894, she was run on Cer
morant Island, Alaska, and it was several
days before she was got off. Later there
was an explosion on Doard, while she was
lying at Seattle, and a number of the crew
were dangerously injured.
The Queen had not been docked half an
hour before the work of repairing her was
begun. As soon as her cargo is out she
will be taken to the Merchants' drydock
and there overhauled.
SCIENTIFIC KITE FLYING.
An Accident Interrupts an Kxperiment
With Them Yenterday.
Another experiment in kite-Hying was
made by the United States Weather Bureau
yesterday from the roof of the Mills build
ing with the object of determining the
feasibility of obtaining the meteorological
conditions of th-i higher atmosphere. The
j purpose yesterday was simply to test the
action of the kites in a stiff breeze, and no
instruments were attached to them.
The bureau has thirty-three kites, the
| idea being eventually to rly the entire
number at one time and secure atmos
pheric data from the regions two or three
miles above the earth.
Seven kites were sent up, when the main
string broke, ending the trial. All of the
kites were subsequently recovered. There
was about 7000 feet of the main string out,
and each kite was attached to it at a dis
tance of 1000 feet by a branch cord 200 feet
in length. The wind was blowing eleven
miles an hour, and the kites soared at an
angle of about 28 degrees. It was esti
mated that the highest reached an alti
tude of about 3400 feet. The kites, after
they broke loose, hovered over the bay,
one, of the kites having caught on a wire,
and thousands of people watched them
along the water front.

THERE IS NO
PRIMARY LAW
The Supreme Court Has
Decided It Unconsti
tutional.
IS SPECIAL AND LOCAL.
Election Laws Must Be Ap
plicable to the Entire
State.
TWO TEST CASES DECIDED.
Sacramento Had No Interest, So the
Los Angeles Case Carried the
Opinion.
The "primary law" has failed to survive
the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. It is
unconstitutional, the court says, it is
special and local, it is at variance, with
various sections of the constitution, and
it is a special law in regard to elections,
something which the legal system of this
State does not tolerate.
There were two cases decided â one from
Sncraruento and one from Los Angelesâ
but the one. from Los Angeles presented
the issues more directly and was therefore
more minutely considered than the Sacra
mento case.
The case from Los Angeles was an- ap
peal from the decision of Judge Van Dyke
in the case of Martin C. Marsh against the
Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles
County. Marsh sued to have the Super
visors restrained from purchasing ballot,
boxes and other necessaries for the primary
under the new law. Judgo Van Dyke
granted the injunction which Marsh
sought, and the Supervisors appealed.
The Supreme Courts decision was as fol
lows:
This is a suit by a taxpayer to enjoin the de
fendants from â¢appropriating public funds of
the county for the purchase of ballot-boxes
and the payment of other expenses involved in
carrying out the provisions of the act of March
27, 1895, commonly known as the primary
election law. - The claim of the plaintiff is that
the act is local and special, and therefore un
constitutional and' void. This contention was
sustained by the Superior Court of Los Angeles
and the injunction granted. Appellants appeal
from the judgment.
There can be no question that the act is local
and special, since by its terms it is to "apply to,
take effect in and be in force only in counties
of the first and second classes, " that is to .-ay,
in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
The constitution allows the classification of
counties' according to population for the pur
pose of regulating the compensation of county
officers in proportion to their duties, and for
that purpose a classification has been estab
lished under which San Francisco falls into
the first class â  and Los Angeles falls into the
second class. | But the fact that these and other
counties of the State have been classified for a
purpose which . the ; constitution recognizes as
a proper and necessary one does .not relieve a
law relating, to other and distinct matters
from the objection that it is local and special
if by its -terms it'is limited in its application or;
operation to one or more classes of counties
less than the whole. This act, therefore, not
being a regulation of the compensation of
county officers is local and special, Slot with
standing it embraces- two counties, each- of
which constitutes one of the classes denned in
the county government act, and; the only
question ; to be determined , is whether or not
the subject of the act is one of those as to
â¢which special and local legislation is inhibited
by the constitution.:; ~'. \ â â  > ";.. â¢ .â >-/ â / '-?' V: '
â  The act is intended to regulate primary elec
tions,!, c. , the election: of delegates to.nomi
nating " conventions, and not ' only in its . gen
eral scope and ; nature, but by various specific
provisions, is made an 1 essential part of the
general election law of the State. 1 By section 21,
for example, it is provided â  that no candidate
can have his name printed upon any. ballot as
a candidate : for ! public - office ' at any general *
election In this State unless he shall have been
nominated by a convention composed of 'dele-'
Â£atÂ«k chosen as the act jjroyidad. or nominated
by a certain percentage of electors, as in the
Political Code prescribed.
The entire act prescribes an elaborate scheme
for the conduct of primary elections by sworn
officers, whose certificates "of election will con
stitute the credentials of the delegates to the
various political conventionsâ State, distri-jt
and local. Not only is it a general law which
should have a uniform operation, and notonly
is the case to which it applies one in which, "a
general law can be made applicable," but from
an inspection of its terms it clearly appears
that it was designed originally to apply uni
formly throuehout the State. This is shown by
various expressions scattered through its first
twenty-four sections in which the original
scheme of the law is embodied.
Section 25, which is in some respects incon
gruous with other portions of the act, seems
to have been a later addition. It provides for
the election in Presidential years of delegates
to a State convention to choose delegates to a
National convention, and by a proviso is made
obligatory only in counties which cast 9000
votes find upward at the last preceding general
election.
But by section 2(> this proviso is superseded
by the proviso limiting the application and
operation of the net to counties of the first and
second classes. But for these two sections we
should have a law complete and full, capable
of applying, and intended to appiy, in every
part of the State. It is not a matter for argu
ment or speculation, therefore, whether this is
a case in which a general law should be made
applicable.
This act, by its terms, shows that such is the
case, and if ft did not, it is apparent that a law
regulating the election of public officers, by
prescribing the exclusive means by which
candidates of the great political parties can
secure a place on the official ballot, is neces
sarily a law of a general nature and capable of
uniform operation.
The act is, therefore, unconstitutional by
reason of its conflict with section 2 of urticle I
and subdivision 33 of section 35 of article IV
of the constitution above citfd. It is also in
conflict with the more specific provisions of
subdivision 11 of section 25, article IV, pro
hibiting local or special laws for conducting
elections.
Counsel for appellants have, made no answer
to these objections to the validity of the act,
ami we know of none which can be made. An
amicus curias makes an urgent appeal in be
half of the law on the ground that it is a good
law designed to prevent, and capable of pre
venting, evils of great and increasing magni-
tude, but he does not deny that section 26
makus it unconstitutional if it is allowed to
stand. He suggests, however, that we should
hold that section. void (he would have to in
clude section 25 also) and the act vaiid
throughout the State, if we should do so we
would be imposing upon the whole State a law
which it is eleftr the Legislature intended to
apply in only two counties, and which would
not otherwise have passed. Tnis we cannot do,
as it would be nothing short of special legisla
tion.
If the act is as beneficial as it is claimed it is
to be regretted that it cannot stand, but as we
have more than once been compelled to re
mind the defenders of special and local laws
we cannot have the advantage of such legisla
tion when it is good under a constitution
which strongly prohibits it upon the assump
tion that it is generally bad.
The judgment of the Superior Court is
affirmed. Beatiy, C. J.

The case from Sacramento was the one
first filed. W. A. Gett sued to have the
Supervisors of Sacramento County ap
point the names required by the law from
which the primary election officers would
be drawn. He commenced an original
proceedine in the Supreme Court in order
to obtain an immediate decision, but the
court holds that Sacramento was not in
terested in the matter at all. as the law,
unconstitutional as it rs. applies only to
cities and counties of the first and second
classes, and Sacramento belongs to neither
of these. The proceedings brought by
Gett are therefore dismissed, the follow
ing opinion by the court explaining the
reasons for such action :
This is an original proceeding in which the
petitioner asks a writ of mandate to the Super
visors of Sacramento county, 'commanding
them to perform the duties imposed upon Elec
tion Commissioners and Boards of Supervisors
by the act of March 27, 1895, relating to pri
mary elections.
The act, by its express terms, is restricted to
counties of the first and second classes, and
consequently has no application to Sacramento
County, or any other except the City and
County of Sail Francisco and the county of Los
Anceles, unless the contention of petitioner
can be sustained that the classes referred to in
said section 20 are those defined in section
400G of the Political Code as originally enacted,
whicn reads as follows:
> - Sec. 4006â For â  purposes other than roads and
highways the counties of this State are classified as
follows: ;.'"-â  :' ,â -';â¢ â 
1. 'Iliose containing . 20,000 inhabitants or over
constitute the first class. â¢ â¢- -
"â¢-â ; 2. Those containing 8000 and under 20,000 in
habitants constitute the second class; and â "..."',-. â -â . â 
_': 3. Those containing less than 8000 inhabitants
constitute the third class.; _, : . ; .
This section was a part of , title II of part IV
of the Political: Code .relating; to the govern
ment of counties: as the same f was regulated
prior to the adoption of the present constitu
tion. By the act of March 14, 1883, entitled
"an i act k to:- establish a uniform system of
County and Township Government," the whole
law upon this subject was revised and the old
law in most cases superseded. 1 ,.- â¢ '.--. -:.-:..
:â â â  liua : beicÂ£ - so. .it is ' extremely . doubtful.
whether the classification established by sec
tion 4006, supra, is continued in force for any
purpose whatever, but conceding that it may
be in force with respect to some matters regu
lated by statutes passed prior to the new classi
fication contained in the act of 1883, we have
no doubt that the reference in the primary
election law is to be the classes denned in the
latest county government act aud not to the
classes established by section 4006 of the
Political Code. It follows, therefore, that
neither this petitioner nor the respondents
have any interest ir. the determination of the
question which they have attempted to sub
mitâi.e., the constitutionality ot the act of
March 27, 1605. and that it ought not to be
decided upon such attempted submission.
Writ denied and proceeding dismissed.

WAS CRUSHED TO DEATH
Mrs. Harriet Wilbeck Is Killed
by a Mission-Street
Car.
Deaf . and Almost Blind She Did Not
Hear or See the Advancing
Deadly Dummy.
Mrs. Harriet Wilbeck, 75 years of age,
deaf and dim of eye, is the latest victim of
the trolley-car. ;; yÂ: "Ji-M
The unfortunate old lady had taken ad
vantage of the beautiful weather on Sun
day last to visit the home of her son, at
Twenty-sixth and Guerrero streets, where
she spent the afternoon. On her return
trip she walked part of the way, until near
Nineteenth street, when, feeling somewhat
tired, she stepped into the street to hail a
passing car.
Another car at the time was speeding
westward, and allowing it to pass, she ven
tured further on, heedless of the danger
bell which tne east-bound car was ringing.
She was either misjudging the distance or
else believed she had time to cross the
track. At any rate, she was struck and
rolled a dozen feet before the motorman
brought the car to a stop.
Mrs. Wilbeck was picked up and carried
to the. drugstore at the corner. She was
unconscious and bleeding from the nostrils
and ears.
Dr. Charles A. Dozier, formerly of St.
Luke's Hospital, was called to attend the
lady and had her removed to her home at
225 Leavenworth street, corner of Eddy,
where she died yesterday morning at 2:25
o'clock.
The remains were conveyed to the un
dertaking establishment .of Porter & Co.,
where an autopsy disclosed that five ribs
on the left side and the collar bone were
fractured.
The scene of the accident is on a slignt
downgrade, and the car was packed witn
the usual Sunday crowd returning from
an outing. Those who witnessed the af
fair say that the old lady was hidden from
view by the westerly bound car, and when
she stepped on the track she was but a
dozen feet from the car that struck her.
The automatic danger bell was ringing
and the motorman stopped the car as soon
as possible, but too late- to save her.
THE COUNTY FEE BILL.
Attorney - General Fitzgerald Gives
County Officers Valuable Foints.
The county fee bill does not seem to be
well understood by many of the officers of
the State. Attorney-General Fitzgerald, in
response to various requests from county
officers, has determined that under the
new fee bill it is the duty of the County
Clerk to collect 25 cents, first, for affidavits
made before him by persons having claims
against the county ; second, on affidavits
so made by pension claimants attached to
their vouchers, for the reason that the act
of 1895, commonly known as the fee bill,
repealed the act passed in 1887 (statutes
1887, 81) authorizing the County' Clerk to
certify affidavits for United States pension
claimants without demanding or receiv
ing fees or compensation.
Upon this same subject the Attorney-
General has also held, first, that no charge
shall be made by the County Clerk for
taking affidavits in the matter of applica
tions for marriape licenses, as the affidavits
are a part of the service necessary to the
issue of the same, for which the charge of
$2 is provided ; second, that a clerk should
make no charge ior taking affidavits in the
matter of the registration of voters, nor for
tiling the same.
He further holds that no charge should

ATTEMPT TO ROB.
The Police Investigating the Case of
George Knapper.
The police are investigating the case of
George Knapper, who lives in Kramer's
lodging-bouse on Sansome and Pacific
streets. About 4 o'clock yesterday morn
ing he was found on the sidewalk in front
of a saloon on Pacific and Kearnv streets.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where a wound in his scalp was dressed,
and he was sent home. He said some men
had attempted to rob him and had struck
him on the head with some instrument.
When he got home he gave the landlord
a $20 gold piece to keep for him, as he was
afraid another attempt would be made to
rob him. Yesterday afternoon the land
lord found him unconscious in bed, and he
was again sent to the hospital. Dr. Fitz
simmons thought his skull might be frac
tured, and he was placed in a cot till a
thorough examination could be made.
Ha had $2 30 in his pockets.

THE PEIMAEY ELECTION LAW.
The decision of the Supreme Court de
claring the primary election law uncon
stitutional will hardly come as a surprise
to any one who has given the subject
serious consideration. The act had the
defect of so many other measures purport
ing to establish reforms in particular local
ities. It was of the nature of that special
legislation which the constitution forbids
and which the Supreme Court has been
again and again called upon to declare
null and of no effect.
From the fate of this measure there are
two plain lessons to be drawn and neither
of them should be overlooked by any citi
zen who has the cause of political purity
:u heart. The first is that all acta in
tended to establish reforms by the processes
of law must be made to conform with the
fundamental principles of government
provided for the State in its constitution.
That ihis may be effected it i-s necessary
in the first place that reformers them
selves should seek no more than can be
constitutionally obtained, and, secondly,
that they should send to the Legislature
men who are sufficiently familiar with the
processes of legislation to enact a measure
that will stand as law.
The more important lessen to be drawn
from the result, however, is that political
reform to the extent of bringing about an
essential honesty in primary elections is
in no way dependent upon the law which
has just been declared unconstitutional.
If that element of the people which
earnestly desires reform will range them
selves under leaders deserving their confi
dence, ana will attend the primaries of the
National party whose principles they sup
port, there .can be no doubt that results
will be obtained equally as good as any
that could have been hoped for under the
measure from which the reformers ex
pected so much.
INGENIOUS AKGUMENTS.
General Hubbard, representing Mr.
Huntington's interests, made on Monday,
before the House Committee on Pacific
Roads, the shrewdest argument that has
yet been presented on the railroad matter.
The propositions which he advanced were
that the Government, desirous of a rail
road across the continent, and unwilling
to construct one itself, made a grant to
private parties for the purpose; that these
persons were not trustees of the Govern
ment; that they were entitled to all the
prorits which they might make on the
construction, because in the absence of
such a prospect no one could be found to
undertake me work, and that the Central
Pacific had lived up to its agreement with
the Government.
He urged that the cont.-act should be re
garded as one between individuals, and a
settlement made in the ordinary way by
extension of the- time for its completion.
He could not satisfactorily meet the ob
jection that the extension would be the
making of a new contract, which would be
voided by the terms of the charter from
California. He proposed as a plan of set
tlement that the company pay the prin
cipal of its Government debt and that the
unpaid interest be funded. It is interest
ing to note in this connection his assertion
that the company could pay its iirst mort
gage debt, wnicii is identical in size with
that owing to the Government.
Leaving thcquestion of trusteeship out
of the account, we still have that of aeon
tract. How General Hubbard can claim
that the company has observed ttiat agree
ment we cannot imagine. On the contrary,
even though we may not consider the
fraudulent means by which the construc
tion contracts were let, nor the sharp prac
tices resorted to in order to cover up and
destroy evidences of those transactions, it
is notorious that in order to avoid keeping
its agreements with the Government and
in order to provide against the chance of
the Government collecting its debt, the
Southern Pacific sj'stematically reduced
the earning capacity of tie Central Pacific,
which earnings belonged under the agree
ment to the Government, and dishonestly
diverted and secured these to the prejudice
of the Government.
It was the most flagrant and shameless
violation of an agreement that could have
been made, and that alone is sufficient
argument against the making of a new
agreement with the same parties. Even
applying the ordinary business rule for the
extension of a debt, no private creditor
would be willing to make a new agreement
with a person who had already defrauded
him, particularly if by foreclosure he could
recover the whole amount.
A NEEDED INVESTIGATION.
The resolution of Senator Lodge direct
ing an investigation by the Senate Finance
Committee of al< the facts and circum
stances connected with the sale of United
States bonds from 1894 to 189U was opposed
by Senator Hill on the ground that it is
not the province of the Senate to investi
gate every subject that might be suggested
by a Senator, and that before the investi
gation is undertaken there should be an
inquiry into the motives that prompted it
and the object to be attained by it.
From the grounds stated it would seem
that Hill's objection can hardly be any.
thing more than an attempt to put a stop
at all hazards to the proposed investiga
tion. Certainly there is nothing in his
argument affecting the real merits of the
issue. Because the Senate is not bound to
make every investigation suggested by a
Senator is no reason why it should not
make this one. The demand in this in
stance comes not from one Senator only,
but literally from the people as a mass.
Senator Lodge was the spokesman of
a large majority of all intelligent Ameri
cans when he asked for this investigation,
and, in fact, the wonder is that tne subject
has been postponed so long and was not
taken up in response to popular demand
as soon as Congress met.
The course of the administration in ar
ranging the bond deals has exhibited
time and again what have seemed to be
unmistakable evidences of something
worse than a blunder. Men have hesi
tated to cnarge Cleveland with deriving
any pecuniary profit from the transactions
because there has been a patriotic disin
clination to associate so base and vulgar a
crime with the exaited office of the Presi
dency. Nevertheless, there has been an
uneasy feeling that scandal has not only
come nearer to that office than ever before,
but has come altogether too near to be
ignored or tolerated.
It is known beyond all controversy that
syndicates of New York and foreign bank
ers have made large profits out of the
loans, that the relations of Cleveland
with these bankers have been very close,
and that a former law partner of the
President has developed suddenly into a
very rich man and a very successful lobby
ist. Along with these salient facts are a
number of allied circumstances that give a
very ugly look to the situation. The3e
have been noted with uneasiness by Dem
ocrats as well as by Republicans. In fact
the people as a whole huve watched the
course of the deals between the Govern
ment and Wall street with a growing in
dignation. They looked for Congress to
begin an investigation at once, and have
been impatient that it was so long de

layed. Tne time to make it has now come,
and any ODposition to it from the friends
of the President will only increase the sus
picion that something is wrong.
THE KENTUCKY CHAETEE-
A correspondent who probably voices ths
perplexity of many other people who have
not studied the railroad tactics in this
State very closely writes to ask: "Won't
you please give us, in a few words, just
how we of this State can in any way derive
any benefit from the repeal by KentucKy
of the Southern Pacific Company charter?
For the life of me I fail to see where our
&am can come in, whether the incorpora
tion be in Kentucky or in some other State
where they own property and do busi
ness."
Certainly it would make no difference to
us whether the Southern Pacific Company
operated railroads in California under a
charter from Kentucky or some other
State. If the present charter is repealed,
however, there will be a time at least when
it will have no charter from another State,
and during that time it will have to ope
rate its roads in California under the char
ters obtained in California. Its roads in
this State, with the exception of the Cen
tral Pacific, will then be under the juris
diction of California laws and subject to
California officials. The benefits to result
to us from that change would include ev
erything that involves litigation, from the
collection of back taxes to the enforcement
of the rates of freights and fares ordained
by the Railroad Commission.
It is not easy to state "in a few words,"
as our correspondent requests, what all of
these benefits will amount to. That cor
porations gain great advantages by operat
ing in one State under charters granted in
other States is made evident from the fact
that almost every unscrupulous corpora
tion in the country resorts to that method
of doing business. The Southern Paciric
Company, for example^ operates roads in
California under a Kentucky charter, but
its roads in Kentucky are managed under
a charter obtained elsewhere. What is
gained in this way by corporations is lost
to the people, and offenses resulting from
such methods have been felt in many
States in the Union hardly less severely
than in California itself.
The repeal of the Kentucky charter
would mean, therefore, a temporary train,
at any rate, and at this juncture the gain
would have far-reaching effects that would
result in permanent benefits. A new char
ter might and probably would be obtained
in another State, but the monopoly would
be compelled to make a long right to get it.
It is not in Kentucky and California only
that the people have awakened to the evil
of outside corporations. There is a grow
ing objection to that system of doing Busi
ness in nearly all the States, and if Cali
fornia once more gets her railroads under
the control of her laws they n*ay remain
there for some time to come, or at least
until the fight with this particular monop
oly is won and settled.
IAVOEING THE MABKET.
Abundant evidence had already appealed
that the farmers in the vicinity of San
Francisco me strongly in favor of the
establishment of a free market on the
water front, or at least of a central free
market and general sales headquarters
there, with subsidiary free markets
throughout the City for retail sales. It. is
significant, therefore, that the Sutter
County Horticultural Society his sent to
the Harbor Commission a s* t of strong
resolutions urging the establishment of
such a market on the water front and ex
pressing the belief that returns on ship
ments will be better than those received
under the present system. It must be
taken for granted that even the farmers of
Sutter County, a comparatively remote
section, are confident that they would re
ceive benefits from such an institution.
Manifestly they would, and the benefit
would not be confined to better direct re
turns. Although the Southern Pacific
Company is reported to have stopped
work on the extension of its line to Santa
Barbara, that line must be put through in
order to secure an adequate return on the
heavy amount already invested. "When
that is done the southern overJand pas
seneer traffic will be brought over that
line. Then the company will undoubt
edly carry out its original intention of ex
tending the road from the present termi
nus at Third and Townsend streets, in
tnis City, along the water to the new
ferry depot. This will concentrate all the
incoming and outgoing travel at the ferry.
The suggestion has already been made to
take advantage of this fact and install a
comprehensive exhibit of California prod
ucts and industries in the ferry building.
A free market in the vicinity would com
plete the usefulness ot such an exhibit and
serve as a practical, everyday display of
the perishable products of this part of the
State. It would lead naturally to inquiries,
would stimulate interest, and would be a
useful advertisement of the sections repre
sented i n the market. That is to say, such
an establishment would not only increase
the profits of farmers and reduce the cost
of products to residents of San Francisco,
but could be made a valuable advertise
ment of California.

proposed by Senator Perkins to the pending
tariff bill, now in the Senate, by which the
duty on sugar would bo raised to a figure that
would give those interested in the protection
of American sugar adequate protection from
foreign competition.

MY LITTLE WORLD. â¢
My little worldâ it lies away
O'er mendows musical with May:
Past pleasant fields where wild doves'wlng
And birds breast-deep in blossoms sing,
And morning-glories climb aud cling.
And there love's banners are unfurled;
Love reigneth o'er my little world.
I pray you mark in the neids and glens
The Curly-headed citizens:
On every brow the morning glows
And every pattering footstep knows
I he way to white .realms of the rose.
And still their steps where'er they be
Wake pathways to the heart of me.
And lo! in fireside lights serene
Her gracious Majesty the Queen!
She weareth love's own diadem. ' â â _.-.
Her gentle hands no jewels gem, -V. .-':-,

And f-uddlPd now In snowy cots;
The twulght Shades and garden plots, ]
But not these suvei forget-me-nots!

Is the voice thatfln the twilight softly sings my
boy 10 aleep.

Oh ! the air la full of angels and their wings around
me sweep.

The New World.â E. D. X. f Indian Hill,
Sierra County, Cal. The steamer New World
was built in New York, by W. H. Brown, and
when she left that port she was consigned to
Everett & Co., of San Francisco. She was 216
feet keel, 27 feet beam and 9 feet 3 inches
depth of hold. Upon her arrival here she was
placed in the Sacramento River trade, In com
maud of Captain Seymour, and later she was
acquired by the owners of the Senator/ and
ran to Sacramento on alternate. days with that
famous old-time vessel. She left New York,
harbor in charge of Captain Ned Wakeman, on j
the 10th of February, 1850. She did not have
any clearance papers, but she did have on
board a Sheriff's 'deputy, who went on her to
serve some papers, and while- he was doing
this she was cast loose and started outward
bound. The deputy wanted to know what it
all meant, and was told that the steamer was
only making a short trip to test her wheels, but
â when off Sandy Hook .the deputy was given
the choice of going on board of a passing pilot
boat or going -to California. As he was
not prepared to go to the land of cold,
he went on. the pilot-boat, and the
steamer continued on. She put in at Rio de
Janeiro, but as the vessel did not have any
papers Captain Wakeman resorted to a trick to
fool the customs officials. He went over the
side of the vessel, carrying a small tin box in
his hand, and while trying to get into the row
boat he fell into the water and tne tin box he
carried went to the bottom. He was rescued,
and when taken ashore bewailed his misfor
tune, as the box that went to Davy Jones'
locker contained his papers. The officials ac
cepted his story and gave him a certificate as
to the "accident," and that enabled him to put
in at other ports without any trouble. He
stopped at Valparaiso on the 12th of May and
reached Panama on the 21st of June. There
she took on some passengers for San Francisco,
but how many, Answers to Correspondents
was unable to ascertain. The steamer reached
her port of final destination July 11, with 217
passengers. . Her last commander was Captain
Gedge, who ran her between this port and
Vallejo. The vessel has been broken up, and
Captain Ned Wakeman, who brought her, nas
passed away. ".. , -. . â 
Soldier's Naturalizationâ Citizen, Santa
Barbara, Cal. Any alien of the age of 21 years
and upward who has been in the armies of the
United States ana has been honorably dis
charged therefrom may become a citizen on
his petition without any previous declaration
of intention, provided that he has resided in
the United States at least one year previous to
his application and is of good moral character.
(It is judicially decided that residence of one
year in a particular State is not requisite.) A
man who enlisted, then deserted, then re-en
listed under an assumed name and in time
was honorably discharged from the army of
the United States would hardly come under
the scope of "and is of good moral character,"
and it is doubtful if he could receive his citizen
papers were the facts made known. A man
who would commit the crime of desertion,
then resort to deceit in order to re-enter the
army, is not the kind of man that is contem
plated when the question is asked by a Judge
"is he a man who is upright, of good moral
character and would he make a good citizen?"
President Harrison's proclamation applies only
to those soldiers who deserted during the Civil
War.
Women's Rightsâ A. S.,.City. This depart
ment does not undertake to comment on the
decisions of judicial olhcers and give opinions
as to the why a Judge decided one way or the
other. As to the rights of women in regard to
property the Civil Code of this State says-
The earnings and the accumulations of the wife
and of her minor children living with her or In her
custody, while she is living apart from her hus
band, are the separate property of the wife
AH property of the wile owned before roarriaee
and that acquired afterward by gift, bequest SV
vise or descent, with the rents, issues and profits
thereof, is her separa c property. The wife may
without the consent of her husband couvev her
separate property. . * " cjr
All other property acquired after marriage by
either husband or wife or both is community
German-A.merica.n-C. H. D., City. An Amer
ican citizen of German birth who has never
performed military duty in Gnrmauy can by
courtesy of the German Government return to
Germany and remain there three months with
out molestation. If he should remain lÂ« w, 1 i

the deal, except, according to Hoyle, rule 45
and rule 50, as follows:
Knle 45. A misdeal does not lose the deal, If.
during the dealing, either of ihe adversaries touch
the cards prior to the dealer's parrner having done

adversaries have subsequently done the same, the
deal is lost. . ,
Kule 50. If the adversaries interrupt a dealer
while dealing, either by questioning the score or
asserting that it fs not his deal, and fail to estab
lish such claim, should a misdeal occur, he may
deal again.
A Mattee of Tasteâ A. P., City. There is no
law of this State that will prevent a man,
whether layman or priest, from appearing on
the streets in any costume he desires to wear
appropriate to his sex. There is a law that
prohibits any one from appearing in the at
tire not appropriate to the Â«ex of the wearer.
Casinoâ A. A., Blue Lake, Cal. If in a game

THE NEW CHARIER
MAY BE INVALID
Only One Board of Super
visors Is Provided
For.
THERE SHOULD BE TWO.
The Union for Practical Progress
Will Take the Matter
Up.
AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.
John M. Reynolds Finds What He
Considers Fatal Defects in the
Instrument.
A defect which is believed by those who
have studied the matter to be a fatal one
has been discovered in the proposed
charter for the City and County of San
Francisco which the Board of Freeholders,
elected on November 6, 1894, drafted dur
ing January, 1895.
One of the stanchest opponents of the
charter is John M. Reynolds of the Union
for Practical Progress, who has been study
ing the matter for months past. Recently
Mr. Reynolds found, as he believes, that
the document is in direct conflict with
the constitution of the State, and, after a
consultation with a number of prominent
attorneys, he has laid the matter before
the organization which he represents.
"I am free to state," said Mr. Reynolds
yesterday, "that 1 am opposed to the
charter, because it puts too much power
in the hands of one manâ the Mayorâ and
I have Deen looking for some defect in it
to prove that it is not the instrument that
will best serve the interests of this City.
"I am satisfied that I have found it.Tho
constitution of this State provides that in
consolidated governments of cities and
counties, where the population exceeds
100,000, there shall be two Boards of Super
visors, or houses of legislation, of twelve
men each.
"See whether sections 7 and 8 of article
II of the constitution of California do not
bear me out. Section 7 reads as follows :
City and county governments -may be con
solidated and merged into one municipal gov
ernment with one set of officers and may be
incorporated under general laws providing for
the incorporation and organization of corpor
ations for municipal purposes. The provisions
of this constitution applicable to cities, and
also those applicable to counties, so far as not
inconsistent nor prohibited to citie6, shall be
applicable to such municipal government. In
consolidated city aud county governments of
more than 100.000 population there shall be
two Boards of Supervisors or houses of legisla
tion, one of which, to consist of twelve per
sons, shall be elected by general ticket from
the city and county at large and shall hold of
fice for the term of four years, but shall be so
classified that alter the first election only six
shall be elected every two years; the other, to
consist of twelve persons, shall be elected every
two years and shall hold office for two years.
Any vacancy occurring in the office of Super
visors, in either board, shall be filled by the
Mayor or other executive officer.
Sec. 8. Any city containing a population of
more than 100,000 inhabitants may frame a
charter for its own governmen iconsistent
with and subject to the constitution and laws
of this State by causing a board of fifteen free
holders, who shall have been at least five
years qualified electors thereof, to be elected
by the qualified voters of said city at any
general or special election, whose duty it shall
be. within ninety days after such election, to
prepare and propose a charter for such city,
which shall be signed in duplicate by the
members of such board or a majority of them
and returned, one copy to the Mayor thereof
or other chief executive officer of such city,
and the other to the Recorder of Deeds of trie
county. Such proposed charter shall then be
published in two daily papers of general cir
culation in such city for at least twenty days,
and within not less than thirty days after such
publication it shall be submitted "to the quali
fied electors of such city at a general or special
election, and, if a majority of such qualified
electors voting thereat shall ratify the same,
it shall thereafter be submitted to the Legisla
ture for its approval or rejection as a whole,
withou t power of alteration or amendment.
"Thus, you see that two Boards of Super
visors are expresslj provided for, and after
the Board of Freeholders has filed its re
port there is no power given any one to
change the result of their deliberations,
even the Legislature being prohibited from
so doing.
"Now, witness how the Freeholders
ignored the constitution and placed the
power of legislation in the hands of a
single Board of Supervisors. Here is what
the charter says in its opening paragraphs
regarding the Supervisors:
ARTICLE 11.
Legislative Department.
CHAPTER I.
Of the Supervisors.
Section 1. The legislative power of the City
and County of San Francisco shall be vested
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26. 1896.
in a legislative body which shall be designated
the Board of Supervisors; sucli body is also
designated in this charter the Supervisors.
Sec. 2. The Board of Supervisors shall con
sist of twelve members, wno shall be elected
by general ticket from the City and County at
large and shall hold office for two years.
Sec. 4. Seven members of the "board shall
constitute a quorum, but a less number may
adjourn from day to day and compel the at
tendance of absent members in such manner
and under such penalties as the board may
prescribe.
'"Only one Board of Supervisors pro
vided for. The charter is clearly in con
flict with the constitution and must fall.
I have consulted Mr. Metson of the law
hrni of Reddy, Campbell Sc Metson, C. A.
Reynolds and other prominent attorneys,
and they all agree with me tuat the instru
ment is invalid.
"It seems incredible that a Board of
freeholders composed of intelligent, think
ing men. some of them attorneys, should
have made such a mistake. I would hardly
like to accuse the corporations with Hav
ing tools in the board, but perhaps they
had, and this fatal oversight may be the
result of their fine work."
DECISION REVERSED.
Important Ruling of the Court, of Ap
peals Affecting Commlssion-
Housos.
The United States Court of Appeals has
reversed the ruling of Judge McKenna in
the case of Dimond et al. against John C.
Quinn, late Collector of Internal Revenue.
It was one of a dozen suits brought by
the Revenue Collector to collect a tax
levied by him on commission-houses for
being engaged in the wholesale liquor
business. The firm of Williams, Dimond
& Co. and others bought liquor in specific
quantities for foreign agents and charged
a commission of ly^ to 5 per cent, plus the
cost of the liquor.
They refused to pay the tax and Judge
McKenna held they were not liquor
dealers. The Court of Appeals reversed
his decision and held that the commission
men might recover from the CoUec;or the
tax illegally collected from them. Judge
Gilbert rendered the opinion, Judge Haw
ley assenting; Judge Morrow dissented.
This will have a bearing on the many
cases of a similar character now pending
in the lower court.
INVADED BY PIGEONS
Myriads of Pretty Birds Have
Destroyed the Madrone
Berries.
So Plentiful That Any One Could Get
Them in Large Numbers â Their
Queer Departure.
C. C. Martin, a pioneer of over forty
four years in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
and who owns an extensive grove of red
woods at Glenwood, on the narrow-erauge
railroad, is at the Grand.
The white-bearded Californian was the
intimate friend of Mountain Charley,
whose head was torn open by a powerful
grizzly in the redwoods, and waited on
him through his illness till he recovered.
It was a great surprise, for Mr. Martin had
many a night watched the pulsations of
his brain.
Mr. Martin says there have for several
weeks past been an enormous number of
wild pigeons in the Sunta Cruz Mountains.
'.The number has fully equaled the swarms
that rilled the mountains four years ago,
when hunters were almost surfeited with
the number which they bagged. They
were as fat, too, as on any former period
when they made their visits.
The pretty birds always seem to know
when the madrone and piona berries are
plentiful, otherwise they do not come.
Their coming is mysterious and without
any previous indication. They have come
C. C. Martin, Who Has Lived for 44 Years in the Redwoods of the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
\Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
in such numbers as to almost shut out the
light of the sun. They have also broken
off limbs in plenty by their weight. The
pigeons have, however, all about got ready
to go, as the end of the berry season has
come.
"There have been a great many birds
this year, indeed," said Mr. Martin. "The
madrone berries were especially tine and
plentiful. There were also a great many
other berries.
"A great many of the pipeons have been
killed. There is a good deal of other came
there, too, as for instance, deer, rabbits
and quail. There are gray squirrels, too,
but I do not allow the latter to be shot
immediately about me. I have eighty
acres of redwoods in one place covering a
glade and some 1200 acres over which tlie
trees grow more or less thickly. 1 should
say there are some millions of trees there,
but I am not cutting any of the redwoods,
but am keeping them as an heirloom to
my family.
"1 have lived in the mountains forty
four years, having settled in them when
there was but one house between me and
Mission ban Jose. Mountain Charley,
who had his head torn open by the
grizzly, had the closest call for his life I
ever saw. The skull was either broken or
raked clear for a space three by four
inches. In the early times grizzlies liter
ally swarmed through my redwoods."
Mr. Martin came to California first forty
seven years aero as a sailor on board the
ship John M. Mayo. "At that time,"
said he, "where the Palace Hotel now
stands was a high sandhill, and it was an
actual fact taut the water came well up
toward the hill."
PANAMA RATES
TO COME DOWN
A Crucial Test Between
the Two Water-Route
Carriers.
PACIFIC MAIL TACTICS.
Everything Done to Discourage
Traffic by Way of the
Isthmus.
SCHWERIN CALLED TO TIME.
The Panama Railroad Company Has
Made a Demand for a Greatly
Reduced Tariff.
Tilings are not as harmonious between
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and
the Panama Railroad Company as they
might naturally be expected to be between
corporations that bound themselves in a
mutual compact only a few months ago.
Ever since the famous Huntington-Sim
mons contract the developments have been
of such a character as to permit the South
ern Pacific and other transcontinental
companies to increase rates and to force
freight over the Southern Paciiic Railroad.
The increase of rates by the transconti
nental lines was at once followed by an
increase in the rates for eastbound busi
ness via Panama. These rates are made
by the Pacific Mail Company, while the
westbound rates are in the hands of the
Panama Railroad people.
In a recent dispatch it was stated that
one steamer of the Panama Railroad's line
on the Atlantic, the Aliianca, had to make
its last trip from Colon to New York en
tirely without cargo.
According to the recently ratified agree
ment the Pacific Mail is pledged to run
aline of steamers to Panama from San
Francisco, and thus to furnish the steam
ers of the Panama people on the Atlantic
with all the freight they require.
The reason assigned by the Pacific Mail
Company for its failure to deliver the
requisite amount of business to the Pan
ama roao is that the Central American
and west coast tralfic is so heavy that
there was not room enough on the Pacific
Mail steamers for through freight.
It is also stated that for its violation of
this provision of the contract the Pacific
Mail Company will have to pay an indem
nity to the Panama Railroad Company,
arbitration to determine the amount.
This arrangement appeared to many
merchants here to be a new way of utiliz
ing the I'anama Railroad Company as a
catspaw for the Southern Pacific by vir
tually paying the Panama Railroad a sub
sidy in the disguise of a penalty.
When E. H. liinton, the general agent
of the Panama Railroad Company in this
City, had his attention called to this situ
ation he emphatically denied that there
was any such scheme with the knowledge
or consent of the company. '-Our people,"'
he added, "I am sure would not them
selves be a party to any such arrange
ment. We are in the held for the business
we propose to have. The trouble has sim
ply arisen from the withdrawal of the Pa-
Cine Mail steamers from the Atlantic side
j and the Panama steamers from this side.
We are both arranging to supplement our
services, and then, I think, there will be
no more trouble."
A different story is told, however, by
others who have knowledge of what is
transpiring between the hearts of the two
companies. It is stated that the Pacific
Mail is deliberately doing everything that
it can to discourage throupn shipments via
Panama, with the view of diverting such
traftic to the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Manager Bchwerin of the Pacific Mail is
often applied to for westbound rates over
the Panama route, which the Panama peo
ple alone have the right to make. Instead,
however, of referring applicants to Mr.
Ilinton, the local general asent of the
company, he has been telling shippers
either that he does not know to whom they
should apply or he has referred them to
the New York office of the Panama com
pany. Yet he has no reason for this pe
culiar conduct, for he with many of the
local merchants have received the circular
of that company stating that Mr. Hinton
is acain prepared to quote rates for west
bound business.
But the best evidence that there is seri
ous friction between the two contracting
companies is shown in the fact that on the
10th of this month the Panama Railroad
gave notice to the Pacific Mail Company
that it desired the eastbound rates reduced
to a figure that would insure business for
the Panama route.
The rates fixed when the recent advance
was made was (JO cents per 100 pounds for
those commodities that were most largely
shipped via the isthmus. This was an in
crease of about 25 cents per 100 pounds,
and developments since then have demon
strated that the advance was too great to
attract business over the longer route.
While according to the contract the Pa
cific Mail has the right to make eastbound
rates, the Panama Company has still a
voice in the matter. The latter compa
ny's position in the matter was thus stated
by Mr. Hinton in an interview published
in The Call of January 15, 1896: "While
the Panama Railroad "may not actually
publish the tariff of rates on eastbound
business, it retains a controlling influence
in determining from time to time what
such rates shall be."
The new tariff suggested by the Panama
Railroad people makes a radical reduction.
It provides that the existing 60 cent rate
be reduced to 40 cents, a reduction of 33 l A
percent. The Pacific Mail people are of
course opposed to this, as their steamers
have ample to do in carrying Central
American freight, and they are conse
quently not desirous of acceding to any
thing that would stimulate the through
business to the decrease of their more
profitable local traffic, to say nothing of
the effect such a reduction would have on
shipments over the Southern Pacific Rail
road. The outcome of this effort on the
part of the Panama Railroad Company to
make the Pacific Mail Steamship Cim
pany live up to the spirit of its contract is
being watched with great interest in ship
ping circles.
BUDD AT THE HOSPITAL.
He Makes an Official Investigation of
the Premises.
Governor Budd paid an official visit to
the Receiving Hospital yesterday morn
ing. He was accompanied by Health Offi
cer Lovelace, Dr. Morse ol the Board of
Health and Sheriff Whelan.
They were received by Police Surgeon
Weil, who pointed out the need of better
and more modern facilities in many
branches of the hospital service. The
Governor found no cau^e for complaint,
except in regard to the insane ward. He
declared it was the worst place he was ever
in, and added, '-I would not kaep hogs in
such a place, and it is an outrage that the
City docs not make better provision for
the unfortunate insane." He promised to
recommend to the Board of Health that
the insane ward be transferred to some
other building, as he did not believe the
hospital should be cumbered with the care
of insane patients.
CRAB-FISHERS TRICKED.
They Took a Tow-Line Which
Pulled Them Into a Jus
tice's Court.
Davis and His Pistol â Four Men Fined
for Neglecting to Pay the State
License.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Al Wilson
and Davis played a mean trick upon four
crab-fishers last Monday. There is a
State law making it compulsory for all
crab fishermen to pay a State license of
$.") a year, the money going to the support
of the commission and the hatcheries.
Around the San Francisco Bay are dozens
of men who make a livirfg by catching
crabs outside of the heads. These men
have persistently refused to pay the State
license and have resorted to all sorts of
tricks to avoid payment.
On Monday the two deputies started
down the bay in the launch and waited
across the bar for the return of the crab
tishing boats. When tlie latter appeared
in a bunch late in the afternoon the
deputies in the launch called out to the
fishermen to throw them a line. The four
fishermen, not recognizing the deputies,
were only too glad to receive a "lift," as
they supposed, because the wind had gone
down and there was every prospect of a
hard pull along the water front from Fort
Point to the Vallejo-street wharf.
Within three minutes four boats were in
tow of the launch, and their occupants
were loud in their expression of thanks to
the men in the launch for their kindness
of heart. The crabbers' faces beamed with
joy as they settled back on their seats
while their boats cut through the water.
Wilson and Davis smiled grimly, and
when well inside of the heads headed the
launch for the Marin County shore. Then
the men in the boats in tow" began to look
uneasy as the San Francisco shore began
to recede. A little later they began to
gesture thai they wanted togo in that
direction, and for the launchmen to cast
off the tow-lines. The deputies laughed
and pointed toward Sausalito. By this
time the crab- fishers began to realize that
there was something wrong, and one got
out his knife to cut the tow-line.
Davis arose in the stern of the launch
and, drawing a revolver, yelled, "If you
cut loose I'll blow your blamed head off!"
That was all the argument the fishermen
wanted, and though they raved and swore
like pirates no one tried to cut his tow
line. The four, whose names are F. Sla
vina, P. Sorantino, N. Slavina and P.
Neroso, were taken to Sausalito under
arrest. The reason for taking them across
the bay was because there would be less
trouble in securing convictions than there
is in the San Francisco police courts.
The men were taken at once before Jus
tice of the Peace Batrue, who compelled
them to pay their licenses and fined them
$18 for the costs.
CENTRAL PACIFIC SUED
Patents to Mineral Land in
Northern Counties in
Dispute.
The Government Commences Action
to Remove the Claims of the
Railroad.
District Attorney Foote yesterday re*
ceived instructions from Washington to
bring suit at the instance of the United
States Government against the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company to relinquish title
to 936G acres of land long since held by
that corporation. The suit will be brought
against ihe Central Pacific as the successor
of the California and Oregon Railroad
Company.
The claim is set forth by the United
States Government that this vast acreage
was erroneously patented to the corpora
tion in question, and action is now brought
to set aside the same, as the time for such
a proceeding would expire under the act
of limitations of March 3, 1891, on neit
Monday.
The land in dispute is located in the
counties of Butte, Sutter, Tehama, Yuba
and Shasta, in the State of California. It
is valued at upward of $1,000,000.
Much of this land was patented because
of the fact that at the time the railroad
company filed its maps of the survey
under the act of July 26, 1866. and the
withdrawals were allowed by the Secretary
of the Treasury, the land was held to be of
a mineral character and was exempt from
the patent afterward issued. Some of the
land had also been pre-empted by home
steaders.
Suit is brought at this time to prevent
the rights of the Government from being
barred.
Watson to lie Chosen.
It has been decided that Ambrose Watson,
late clerk of Judge Conlan's Police Court, will
take the place left by Harry Morris in the
County Clerk's office. County Clerk Curry has
decided not to put Morris back and so Watson
has beeu selected for the place.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Architect Swayne Will Supervise
the Erecting of the
Ferry Depot.
THE FREE PRODUCE MARKET.
Fast Trip of the Oimara to Melbourne
After Losing All Her
Topmasts.
The difficulty between Architect E. R.
Swayne and the Brown estate over the
working plans for the new ferry depot is
almost a thing of the past. At the meet
ing of the Harbor Commissioners yester
day Mr. Swayne presented his contract,
which he wished the board to sign. After
a few modifications suggested by Presi
dent Colnon and which were agreed to by
Swayne's attorney it was decided to sign
the contract next Thursday, when the
architect will furnish a $10,000 bond for the
careful carrying out of the wort. In this
manner another step toward the beginning
of the depot will have been accomplished.
The request of the fruit-growers of Sutter
County for a free market on the water front
led to a long discussion. President Colnon
championed the cause of the farmers and
it was finally left to him to arrange the de
tails of the preliminary work looking
toward the establishment of such a free
market as the farmers seem to desire.
Superintendent Wilder of the Southern !
Pacific wrote in regard to the complaint
of Wells, Fargo & Co. that the latter was
compelled to pay rent at the ferry. Wilder
denied that such was the case and said
that the express company was simply
charged tolls. The Commissioners decided
to allow the two companies to fight out the
toll question alone.
Chief Engineer Holmes drew the atten- |
lion of the board to the fact that the .
steamer Hiawatha had charged $8 for sup
plying water to one of the State's pile
drivers. This he considered about twelve |
times more than should have been charged
accconiing to the rates laid down by the i
Supervisors. No action was taken in the !
matter, as the members of the board will j
await the action of the Grand Jury.
The sealing fleet has been heard from
again. The schooner J. P. Eppingerwas ,
spoken off the Farailones last Saturday i
with 700 skins aboard. These have all been |
taken on the coast and is considered to be
a remarkable catch for this time of the
year. The captain reported having lost a >
boat and three men, but the schooner :
Mary C, which arrived from Drake's Bay j
yesterday, reports leaving the boat and ;
men safe and sound at that point. The .
Mary C also brought down the boat of the
steamer Willamette, which the captain
sent ashore to notify San Francisco that
his vessel was in distress. The men came
here overland and the boat was towed
down.
The reconstructed steamer Al-Ki will
leave for Alaska on March 1 next.
Splendid passenger accommodations have
been built on her and she will be one of
the finest vessels in the fleet that regu
larly run to Sitka. The Mexico and City
of Topeka are already on the Sound and
when ibe Queen joins them next June the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company will
have four vessels plying in Alaskan waters.
Albert Brown, John Burns and Thomas
Clark were all arrested yesterday on
charges of petty larceny by the Harbor
Police. Brown robbed L. Heinrich
while the latter was asleep and Burns
stole three razors from L. Acosta, 515 East
street. Brown and Heinrich are contor
tionists who came here to get an engage
ment at the Orpheum. Clark is a sailor
who stole a knife and a razor from his
boarding-master.
The British ship Oimara, which left here
on December 25 last, made the smart
run of 62 days to Melbourne. Australia.
She was caught in a succession of gales
and lost her fore, main and mlzzen top
masts during the run. ,
Mounteney Jephson, Stanley's able and
faithful lieutenant, has recently been ap
pointed a Queen's messenper, a position of
great responsibility, which may call him
to South Africa.

Authority.
Rev. Donald M. Ross last night, at Met
ropolitan Hall, took up the second propo-
Bidoa of the controversy between himself
and llev. Peter C. Yorke and quoted Cath
olic authorities and argued tnerefrom to
sustain his position, which is that:
" IHe Pope and the priests ought to have
dominion over temporal affairs."
Major E. A. Sherman opened the meet
ing, speaking ab follows:
The audience is the judge In the matter.
You are the judges. I am simply acting as
commissioner to pass upon what Mr. Ross pre
senu and see that his quotations from the
authorities he cites are correct. I shall do this
at the end of the proceedings. But the find
ings and the conclusions will rest with you.
1 nave gone through, them with his" thor
oughly and there is nothing in what he will
at that is not contained in a book printed
by ;he authority of the Roman Catholic church
and approved by the Catholic dignitaries oi
:lus country as well as those of Rome. There
ia not a single sentence or paragraph quoted
by Mr. Ross that is not exactly as j,nnted in
me books.
I am surprised that Rome has gone so far as
t-he has in the direction of using printed type.
And when the linai day of judgment comes I
believe that the devil will get tome credit for
permitting the Savior to save mankind. There
lore the people of this City and of the United
.â -; a;Â« ov.e a great debt oi gratitude to Peter
for bringing out and- exposing what
Home is.
It has thrown down the drawbridge and per
mitted us to enter the fortifications aud find

that has been done in this City and
throughout the United States in arousing the
Protestant sentiment in the laud has been
nothing h:A the merest kindergarten work of
the great battle to be fought.
The power of the Roman church is beyond
description, and the only thing that they rely
upon v the ignorance of the Catholic people,
â¢ :,at they will continue to obey the Pope,
cally and otherwi- â .
w ben ilr. Ross gets through he will have
shown to you in tho clearest manner what he
maintains by the declarations of Rume.
And I will say this, that every man who
- allegiance to Rome has been educated
under the rule of that church. There is no
wan fit to be a true citizen of these United
States, <)T v. prODei officer of the people, who
sen thus educated. 1 only ask you now
-;. :: calmly and exercise your patience
until the whole cxposuie is made.
1 somehow, and i say it with all reverence,
believe that in these circumstances whicn
bare brought us together may be recognized
the hand ot the Aunlghty Father, and the duty
which I owe t<> him, to my country and to niv
family urges me to further indorse ttiis cause.
My ;.Â«it history is secure. I care not wtiat Mr.
Yorke may say against me. I enjoy the confi
deuce of my friends and the organizations to
which 1 belong. 1 am among ether tilings a
Mason, an organization with 7,o<>o,<JOO en
roiled members. We also are interested jn this
thing, as tvery good citizen should be. I only
regret that 1 am not twenty-live or thirty years
younger than I am, so that 1 might "take a
belter hold of this battle.
Jessie Brock Morgan sang the "Red,
AVliite and Blue," and was promptly fol
lowed by Key. Donald M. llo^s, wlio apoke
as follows:
Before 1 bepln I am going to say something.
[Laughter. l Now, I am starting to do some
challenging, and I am just going to dare
Father Yorke to use the man's name he refers
to in the Examiner this morning. I dare Pe
ter C. Y'orke- to name the man with whom I
tite. I simply dare him to name the thief
with whom I associate. Let me read you this
from the Examiner:
He said that lie had a priest helping him in this
controversy. 1 hereby brand him as a malicious
liar. .No priest has helped him In this controversy,
He bun, However, coi^orted with a man who was
ooce a Catholic, a sot and afautor of thieves. Hut
he Is no more a priest than Donald Koss is, and to
all the aid that this befuddled nitrate can afford
1). Kuss is welcome, It becomes a slanderer to
consort with thieves.
A sot! When he was a Catholic, is it? He
Myg that no priest has helped me in this mat
ter. But I will say to Peter C. Yorke that 1 got
help from two i. nests, and perhaps by to-mor
row night I will gel help from three. [Ap
plause.]-
-. Now, I dare him to name the man who is the
thlci, and with whom 1 consort, and there will
be f-onie fun in San Francisco if he names him
[tij.wuuse], and Peter C. Yorke will be the
underdog in the fight, too, it he names him.
And, my friends, 1 tell you right now Peter C.
Yorke can name him, and I dare him to. I
don't say that he is a thief, but he can name
the man I consort with.
to-night I shall prove the proposition that ia
No. 9on the programme. lam going to prove
to you to-night out of Catholic publications
that the Catholic church leaches, claims and
defines that the Pope and the priests ought to
have dominion over temporal affairs.
My body Is a temporal affair. My liberty Is a
temporal affair. My person is a temporal affair
Never mind ray soul. My body mid the use of
it, the freedom of it, the right of it is a temporal
affair. But the church saysâ 1 quote from the
"Elements of Ecclesiastical Law" :
â¢'The church can inflict temporal and even
corporal punishments."â Page 10.
in C. Yorkeâ and lam glad fie published
that letter this morningâ he simply fell back
to the statement that 1 was a liar. He simply
tried to prove that my authorities were not
taken from Catholic sources. You will find
that every quotation I have used or will use is
taken from authoritative Catholic publications
by which the Archbishops, Bishops and the
other dignitaries of the Catholic church are
governed and to- which they must submit.
They are those in which the church takes that
position and declares that the Pope and the
priests ought to have dominion over temporal
affairs.
Bf. DoUinger, the great, probably the great
is* scholar in me church, not excepting Carmi
ne! Manning, during the present century, baid
this:
â¢â¢And eren at Rome executions for Protes
tantism continued down into the seventeenth
century. * â¢ * The revocation of the edict
of Names had the formal approval of the very
beat of all the l'opi-sâ lnnocent XL"
Ann I thick that when the Roman
(atholic church executes a man â chops
oti lag head or chokes him to death
or roa>is him till iijÂ« has fled, it is
taking dominion over temporal attairs. \nd
When the Koman church ohokeg the life out oÂ£
a man or cms off his head we are, of course to
conclude that the church of Homo takes
dominion to that extent over temporal affairs
Jjolliiiger also says :
'â¢LvoX's bull against Luther condemned as
errors such universally familiar truths as that
it is against the charity of the Holy Ghost to
burn, heretics."
Let me explain that in a lew words. The edict
of Vantes gave the Hugenots certain liberties,
among' other thine* to worship according to
their belief. But this was revoked, so that the
massacre of St. Bartholomew could tnke place
and that revocation had the approval of Rome',
according to DoUinger. That surely was tak
ing dominion over temporal tUUur.s. Dollinger
also says this: ' ;
"In all the domains of CAtholic princes Prot
estant worship was suppressed under Jesuit
dictation: it was the professed aim of the
Jesuit order to undermine the treaty of Augs
burg."
la tho violation of this treaty with Germany
many Protestants were burned to death. I
believe that to burn a man to death is a tem
poral affair, ami yet wo are told by this man
that. "Leo X's bull against Luther condemned
as errors such universally familiar truths as
that it is against the charity of the Holy Ghost
to burn heretics." â¢â¢â  â¢ â  - - â - â¢
1 do not make a quotation of any of this mat
ter out of wiy Protestant book. 'l make them
from Catholic publication!! only. How can
Peter 0. Yorke denounce them as forgeries?
Has he seen my library that be can truthfully
say that wnnt '"give is second-hand?
"Germany wns still suffering from the Thirty
Years' W'nr, unit the Jesuits, who were its ar..
thors, were as powerful ac evdr at the courts of
Pftrisand Vienna 1 '
That, too, 1Â« taken from Dollinger. is that
not interfering with temporal affairs? And I
say thai when the Catholic churchâ so long us
i I 'Oppresses the privilege of any man to go
where he pleases and do what he pleasesâ so
long as it is doing this it is taking part in tem
po nil affairs.
Is not wnr a temporal affair? Yet we arc told
by Dolliuger,Â»who was at Rome when Pius IX
was declared infallible and absolutely incap
able of making a mistaKe when speaking of
religious affairs, that the Thirty Years' War was
caused by the Jesuits.
It is not enough to say this is a foreery.
That is no answer. Let him come forward as a
man and ask me to produce that book, and 1
will do it. [Cheers and applause.] If it is not
identical with what 1 read then 1 will admit I
am ii forger. Or let him come to my hotfse if
he does not want to have me present my
authority in public, or let him suggest a place
downtown, and I will W him. read it and
compare the book's text with my citation, and
if there is the slightest difference, even to a
comma. I will apologize to him, and I tell you
it will go hard for me to apologize to Peter C
Yorke. [Applause]
"But it was ehieliy by the oppression and
banishment of the "Protestant ministers, the
forced emigration of those who adhered to
their faith, the destruction of Protestant
Bibles, catechisms and hymn books, and gen
erally the employment of all those means of
coercion which the Jesuits had reduced to a
system tnat the so-called counter Reformation
â¢ * â¢ was brought about."
Now, that is a temporal affair. I Eay that
when a man cannot read books that are clean,
I candidly believe that the church is entering
Into temporal affairs. Nobody denies, no in
telligent man denies, this position of the
church.
A friend of mine called on a friend of his
and he was blackguarded for attempting to
stand by me. His friend is a Catholic, and be
jumped on me because, he said, I w&8 trying
to make out the state is above the church.
"Don't his Grace," said this man, "tell us all
the time that the church is above the state.
Don't he tell us that all tlie time? And there
is that man Ross trying to mate out that the
state is above the church."
Rememoer, I am not saying that it it is
wrong fur the church to be above the state. It
is not my place to cay that. lam simply here
to show that the Crtholic church does take
that attitude. In all my wide reading on this
subject during the past three months I have
not come across a single Catholic publication
that does not assert this. If the Catholic
church is true the Catholic church is right in
this. Assuming that the Catholic church is
liod's representative here, then the Catholic
church is right in assuming it is greater than
any government.
Hut history denies that. The basis they are
working on is wrong. The Catholic church
does not represent God, and never will until it
is purified.
when a man goes home at 3 o'clock in the
morning af ler pouring out what JYter C. Yorke
poured out last night in the Examiner publi
cation-house, and goes from that into the con
fessional-box, 1 tell you, my friends, the Cath
olic church does not represent God. I submit
simply this: that whether Yorke be priest,
minister or blacksmith he t-hnuld have come
ami seen whether the extracts of mine were
right or not, and then pronounce against
them. Bui for him to simpiy look over my ex
tracts and da>h off a letter, while the press of
the Examiner was held back, is evidence of
only a presumption on his part. If he be only
truthful, I can enjoy an opponent and a dis
cussion, but I do not care to be criticized by a
man who simply says, '-Thai is a lie; that is a
lie; that is a lie. 1 ' [Applause.]
Dollimrer in his lecture in Germany said:
"At tlie restoration of 1600 a prospect of
toleration and of regaining their property was
held out to the Irish Catholics on condition of
Ihek- taking an oath of allegiance to the King
aud repudiating all right ol the Tope to depose
him or absolve his subjects from the duty of
civil obedience. A similar declaration had
been required of the English Catholics in lt> 17.
Hut Innocent X had at once strictly forbidden
them to accept any declaration of the kind,
and excommunicated those who had already
subscribed to it."
Don't you think that the government has
the right to demand an oath of allegiance and
fidelity and loyalty it the government so pass,
if there isa law requiring it? But when the
English Government in 1(547 and 1000 de
manded that of its subjects the Roman church
denied the right. Pope Leo said : '"Don't you
dare take that oath of allegiance or you will
go down below," and the ones that had taken
it he sent down belaw.
Again, Pope Pius IX. is the author of this:
â 'All the Bishops in Rome (tiOs) signed an
address to Pius IX on June 8, lSu'2. It de
clared the sense of the whole church to be that
the temporal power was necessary to tlie
supreme Pontiffs and an institution of Provi
dential origin."
Yet I am called a liar and a forger when I
say that the church claims temporal power.
I bare books which will require month;; to
read aud I have read themâ all Catuolic -in
support of this declaration. The life of Pius
IX says â¢:.:;:
"The will of the people does not institute a
supreme law independent of all divine and
human right?."
By divine right is meant the Catholic church
all the time. ConVpare that with Lincoln's
grand saying, "Go. eminent by the people, of
the people, for the people," or Grant's that
"the will of the people is the supreme law of
the land."
I>r. Doilinger, page 78, says:
"This Papal kingdom must be upheld and ex
tended by all means of compulsion and vio
lence and punishments of life and limb, some
times directly inflicted, sometimes by invok
ing the secular arm, which is bound at once
to execute its sentence."
That is pretty plain language, is it not? And
yet that is not interference with temporal
affairsâ the absolute right of liie and death.
When the church says "that man's head must
come off," that man's head comes off.
Again, this from the utteiances of Pope Pius
IX regarding the Papal state:
"As for agreeing with the despoilers, we will
never do it. I can only repeat that any trans
action on that basis is impo'sible. â¢ *** The
Sovereign Pontiff before his exaltation and the
Cardinals at the time of their nomination bind
themselves by an oath not to yield up any part
of the territory of the church."
And yet when I read that out of Pius IX's
own speech I am told that I am lying and
forging when I say that the Catholic church
demands that the church be .set above tne
state. Why this man Peter C. Yorke should
aÃk me to bring these things forth, invite me
to step in and look at the Catholic church as ie
is, I cannot understand. lie challenged me to
seek this testimony and make it public. It was
an easy task, and lie certainly must have
known it would be easy, and therefore why he
should have me do it is not so easy to answer.
Bronson's Review is an accepted authority in
the Catholic church. This is a recent expVes-
Bion :
"Protestantism lias no rights in presence of
Catholicity." This sentence is, we believe,
from our Review and was written by its editor.
We do not deny it, and are prepared to stand
by it. (Ed. lironson's Review.)
That is pretty strong language to be placed
in cold type by the devotees of a church that
does not tamper with temporal affairs, isn't it?
Our church holds that marriage is n temp
oral matter. But the Catholic church Â»aays
"No." On page 01, vol. 1, of their ecclesias
tical law we find this:
"All questions bearing on the sacramental
character of matrimony, c. g., the validity of
rnarriace or betrothals, fall under the church'g
jurisdiction."
They go further and directly declare that civil
marriages is nothing more than legalized pros
titution. [Higses.] Why, not very long ago
a question arose in which the question was
raised as to the legal marriage of a certain
couple. A woman belonging to the Catholic
church had said publicly that they were not
married. The matter got into Judge Camp
bell's court and this woman was called to task
She repeated whet she had said and explained
that sue had said so because they were not
married in the Catholic church or by a priest.
The woman was lined $10 for what was
deemed a slander. The laws of every State in
this Vnion say that marriage is under the
jurisdiction of the State, but the Catholic
church formally declares as a part of its writ
ten law that it alone has jurisdiction, Now
talte that to Peter C. Yorke and ask him if that
is or is not a forgery or a lie? Does not this
alone serve as an answer to his challenge?
The Catholic church has volumes of books on
marriage. They seem to delight in making books
on that subject. We have noneâ save perhaps
a little one that we preachers sometimes give
to the happy couples when we marry themâ a
little book telling them how to love and
cherisU one another. [Laughter.]
We leave that matter to the legislatures.
But, as I nay, the Catholic church has libraries
of books on the subject. Here is something
from "Marriage," page 89:
"liehold, gentlemen, the pretensions of the
secular power. It has thrust itself forward
with so much audacity and persistency, it has
beeu supported by so much sophistry, that it
has ended by disturbing the public mind. â¢ * *
In opposition to the pretensions of the secular
power. 1 maintain that legislation on mar
riage, as to ys very essence and essential prop
erties, belong to God and his church.
Again, from the same book, page 39: "The
Holy Council of Trent has described the sacra
ment of marriage in a few words, which leaves
nothing unsaid. 'It is a grace which rterfects
natural love, strengthens the union Into an
â¢absolute indissolubility,"' etc.
In other words, married by the church, noth
ing can affect the bonds. A woman may li rid
that she has married the meanest thing that
lives, her husband may neglect her, reluse to
provide for her, rob her of what earnings she
in.iv mnke, may use any violence toward her
ana l>e guilty of all unfaithfulness, but the
church will not grant her the right to free her
self.
Is not your home n temporal affair? I de
clare that the marriage thai makes the home
THE SAtf FRAKCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY '26, 1896.
is a temporal affair, and call upon oor hip hall
of records as a witness. When the Catholic
church undertakes to interfere in such it is
interfering with temporal affairs. I am not
saying that divorce is right or wrong. I would
not gtvc you offense 1f you believe it Is wrong.
Hut that Is not the question. I am challenged
to go into the Catholic books and find any
authority for the declaration that the church
claims aud exercises dominion over temporal
affairs. lam doing that thing. Why no intel
ligent Catholic doubts the proposition.
Now let us look at another pointâ let us see
what the law of the Catholic church has to say
about the little red schoolhoOM: Here v
what may be found on page 91, vol. 1,
Ecclesiastical Law: "Experience teaches that
the public or common schools in the United
States, owing to their very Kystem, the text
books used and the class of "children frequent
ing them, in moU cases endanger both the
faith aud morals of Catholic children sent to
them. If possible, therefore, a Catholic paro
chial day school â¦ * * shouid be estab
lished in every congregation."
In other words the Catholic church sayg your
boys will degrade their sons by mere contactâ
the going to the same schools with them.
Think of it; those little boys with four inches
of upper lip [laughter], heads on like monkeys,
playing with cocoanuis down in the tropics.
I'hi y will be degraded by your sons and so the
Church of Rome want their children taken
away and marshaled by themselves. Perhaps
that is not an interference with temporal
affairsâ the schools all being divine.
Here is a declaration from Cardinal Man
ning:
"A starving man commits no theft if he saves
his life Dy eating of his neighbor's bread so
much as is necessary for the support of his ex
istence. The civil law yields before the higher
jurisdiction of the divine as the positive divine
law yields before the natural law of God."
What a picnic for tramps I Perhaps if we
were on the jury in the trial of a man for theit
who was shown lo have stolen what he
wanted to eat because h? was hungry and had
no other meatis-of getting what he needed we
would not be disposed to send him to prison.
I am not criticizing this doctrine exactly
therefore, but you must remember that I am
speaking to the question whether or not tne
Catholic church is not disposed to put its hand
hard down upon the temporal affiiirs of the
people.
By what right, now, would the Pope of
Rome have to ask Grover Cleveland to resign
bis office? And yet tho Pope hag done that
thing to kings. "Here is what the ecclesias
tical law has to say by way of explanation :
Keclesiastical Lawâ "By what right was t c
deposing power exerted by the sovereign pon
tiffs ? There are two opinions among Catholic
writers; the one holds that it was exercised
merely by virtue of the -Jus Publlcum' â¢ * *
of the medieval ages; the other that the de
posing power, as exercised by Gregory VII and
the other pontiffs, is inherent in the primacy,
being included in the indirect power of the
Pope in temporal things. This opinion is thus
expressed in our article on Gregory VII pub
lished in Bronsons Quarterly Review, April,
1375: 'The power itself (i. c. of deposing
princes) in radice, we hold is inherent in the
papacy; the power in action or its exercise de
pot.ds on external circumstance.' "
I have no quarrel with the Catholic laity;
some among them are my warmest friends. I
believe the laity do not understand whither
they are drifting. They do not understand
their real relationship to the church. I be
lieve lam their friend. [Laughter.] I think I
am their truest friend, in pointing out to them
that relationship.
1 am a poor man, a very poor man, and if
you came to my house you would discover
why. Sometimes there are processions there
of poor menâ l think my doorpost is marked.
I do not say it as a retieciion in any way, for the
Catholic church is not responsible for it in
any way. but 1 am sure that very frequently
among the callers are members of that church*.
They are never turned away because of that
fact. They are as welcome as any other. It
has been my fortune to be banqueted several
times in my life, and the very last time it was
a Catholic organizationâ a Catholic literary
society of which I was a member that so
honored me. .So it is not with ttie Catholic
laity that I have any differenceâ it is with the
doctrine of their church, wherein it stands
antagonized to our American institutions.
I now quote from Ecclesiastical Law, volume
1, page 259, a.s follows :
"Pope Pius fX himself in one of his dis
courses says, 'that the right of deposing princes
has nothing to do with the pontifical infalli
bility, neither does it flow from the infallibil
ity but from the authority of the Pontilf. Of
course a Catholic is bound not only to beiieve
what the Pope defines ex cathedra'but aiso to
accept and obey what he otherwise com
inandx.'
Is this not plainly the right of the church to
exercise the absolute right in temporal affairs?
Yet Peter C. Yorke declares that if the Pope
ordered him to go contrary to the Government
of tho United States he "would disobey the
Pope, I say that the Roman Catholic church
teaches that it knows no nations, knows no
continents, but is above the state aud exercises
dominion over temporal affairs.
The Pope declares that the Roman Catholic,
no matter where he ig, whether in the United
.Slates, England, Germany or any other coun
try, is bound to obey the churrh. Dr. McGlynn
disobeyed the J'or>e for a. short time, but he
had to do penance to get back.
Kcciesiastical Law, volume 1, page 257, de
clares:
"The authority of princes and the allegiance
oi subjects in the civil state of nature are of
divine ordinance, and, therefore, so long as
princes and their laws are in conformity to the
laws of God the church has no jurisdiction
against them or over them. Jf princes and
their laws devinte from the law of God the
church has the authority from God to judge of
that deviation, and to oblige its correction.
* â¦ â¢ When a Christian world came into
existence the civil society of man became sub
ject to the spiritual direction of the church."
If the Government of the United States devi
ates from the laws of the Catholic church in
the United States that church has the authority
to exercise dominion over the country. The
church teaches that it has the right to exer
cise authority over every country in tho world.
Cannot the Catholic church, therefore, regu
late the laws to suit itself. H I can make the
Senators at Washington change the lawn to
suit myself, as C. P. Huntington is now trying
to do, am I not exercising dominion "over
temporal officers?
From the same work we read the following:
"On the rights of the supreme pontiffs in
temporal matters there are four different opin
ions, etc. First is untenable. Second is heret
ical. Third advanced by Bellarmine and
others maintains that tho Pope has jure dlvino
only spiritual, but no direct or immediate tem
poral power; that, however, by virtue of his
spiritual authority he is possessed of power in
direct indeed but nevertheless supreme in tem
poral concerns of Christian rulers and people
that he may therefore depose Christian sover
eigns should the spiritual welfare of a nation
so demand. Thus a matter of fact Pope Inno
cent IV In pronouncing sentence of deposition
against Frederick II explicitly says that he de
poses the Emperor auctoritate apostolieuin et
vi clavium.
"Fourth opinion holds that the sovereign
poutill hds full spiritual authority over princeâ¢
no less tlinn over the faithful ; that therefore
he has tho right to ichcli and instruct them in
their respective duties, to correct and inflict
spiritual punishment upon both rulers and
peoples, but that iiue divino he has no power
as asserted by Bellarmine, whether direct or
indirect, in the temporal affairs of Catholic
sovereigns or peoples. * â¢ â¢ â¢
"The third and fourth seem to differ chiefly
as to the deposing power of the Popes, but
agree in granting that the Roman pontiff has
an indirect power in temporal things; both
may be lawfully held."
Tee Pope deposed Frederick II by the au
thority the Catholic church vested in him. A
catechism of Catholic doctrine, approved by
the third plenary council of Baltimore and by
my sick friend, the Archbishop, and also by
Cardinal Gibbons, has some startling things in
it. Now lam going to read for you these ques
tions and answers on matrimony:
Catechism, page 49. (Imprimatur, Arch
bishop ftlordan of San Francisco. Approved,
Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore.) Question-
Can a Christian man *nd woman be united in
lawful marriage in any other way than by the
sacrament of matrimony? Answerâ A Chris
tian man nnd woman cannot be united in law
ful marriage in any other way tnan by the
.sucraincnt of matrimony, because Christ raised
marriage to the dignity of ft sacrament.
Catechism (same): Questionâ Can the bond
of Christian marriage be dissolved by any
human power?
Answerâ The bond of Christian marriage
cannot be dissolved by any human power.
Catechism (same): Questionâ To receive the
sacrament of matrimony worthily is it neces
sary to be in the state of grace ?
Answerâ To receive the sacrament of matri
mony worthily it is necessary to be in the state
of grace, and it is necessary also to comply
with the laws of the church.
Catechism same): Questionâ Who has the
right to make laws concerning the sacrament
of marriage?
Answerâ The church alone has the right to
make laws concerning the sacrameni of mar
riage, though the state also has the right to
make laws concerning the civil effects of the
marriage contract.
Catechism (same): Questionâ Does the
church forbid tne marriage of Catholics with
persons who have a different religion or no re
ligion at all?
Answerâ Tho church does forbid the mar
riage of Catholics with persons who have a
different religion or no religion at all.
Dr. McGlyun was not in good standing in the
Catholic church at one time, and what he said
then P. ('. Yorke" may say is not Catholic doc
trine. But Vr. McGlynn is now in good stand
ing in the Catholic church without taking
back one word of the following:
McGlynnâ "The temporal power, the wealth
lavished upon the church became a most fruit
ful source of corruption of Popes and Cardi
nals and prelates and priests. The Pope to n
great extent became a temporal ruler, enrich
ing his family, providing husands for his
nieces and wives for his nephews. * * * The
Pope as a temporal ruler, making treaties with
Spain against France and treaties with France
against Spain, forming alliances with foreign
powers against Italian principalities, and then
allying himself with the Italian principalities
against those foreign powers. And tnns Lain
olic countries have' had to iook upon him time
and again as a foreign enemy, and, while call
ing 'Holy Fatheiy they hire men and send
them out co shoot this Jioly father.
"This weut *o far that Pope Alexander \ i ot
Infamous memoryâ his Holiness Pope Alex
ander VJ. well known aÂ« RodericK Borgiaâ had
his illegitimate children occupying Ms many
palaces. And Caesar Borgia, a great swash
buckler, a bully, a bnute, a desperado ana aa
venturer, in the name ot" and by the au thorny
of his father, hiÂ« Holiness Alexander VI, was
actually traveline up auu aown the unfortu
nate Italian states killing and robbing and
murdering in the name of his father, the holy
fatner the Pope. And Lucretia. Borgia, well
known upon these theatrical boards, was
anq'her one of the beautiful children of his
holiness Alexander VI And it is significant
that at the time his holiness Alexander M
ruled the Roman church, a chubby, flaxen
haired, little German boy was playing around
the streets of a tovrn in "Saxony, a boy whose
name was Martin Luther.
"All through the middle ages the Pope as
sumed as much as he could of power, tem
poral as well as spiritual. And he asserted
his right to interfere with the feuds of
prince*, protesting that he did not judge con
cerning the fief that was in question, but
concerning the sin ; and in that pretense there
is nothing in human life which priest, Pope
or Bishop could not interfere.
"Ana the Pope is trying to strengthen his alli
ance with England, with Russia, with Prussia,
at the expense every time of the poor Catholic
people oi North Germany, of Poland, of Kng
land, of Ireland. The Pope in politics! Look
at the outrage recently put upon the faithful
people of Ireland by sending a commission of i
two Italian prelates to investigate them at the
dictation of an English lord, in order to obtain
the help of England iv building up his rotUin
temporal throne.
"The Pope in politics! Infallible! Most falli
ble of men. He can scarcely take a step but
what he is sure to make a blunder worse than
a crime because he has no business in politics.
It should be his business to preach the Gospel,
and every man should stick to his own trade,
and the ecclesiastical cobbler, like every other
cobbler, should stick to his last. And a man
who might make a good priest would niafce, as
a rule, a very poor politician."
Peter C. Yorke has quoted Father BurJte, one
of the greatest intellects known in Catholic
history. I would give anything in the world if
I had the Rift of words of Father Burke or
possessed his power of oratory. It was mar
velous. He was a word-painter â a man of
great mind. He had n passport through every
diocese in the United Slates and England, and
no wonder; and if ne wore lecturing in Kan
Francisco I would pay $Â£> to go and hear him.
Father Burke say?:
"Since the day the Catholic church founded
the civil government it has never been able to
stand on its lefts independently of her. From
the time that civil governments first got on its
legs it has never been able to work properly
without the help of the church ; and yet it has
betn coming in and taking up matters of which
it knows nothing and in which its action is
fatal to man's freedom and man's free will.
The civil government is the creation of the
church. And yet after all she has dove for it
civil government has tried to encroach on the
rights and dominion of the church in three
waysâ in education, in matrimony, in the ap
pointment to benefices."â Burke. '.259.
Let us see about Home and the little red
schooihouee. "And here it is that the great
contest begins, which is rogifig all over the
world to-day in every land and in every clime,
the church on the one side crying out, 'i>ei me
get to the children,' and the world on the other
hand saying: "I will educate themâ you stand
aside' There is the great heresy of to-day,
with which the church of God, is contending
with might and mainâ what education can the
world give? It can make an intellectual
monster."â Burke, 323.
"I find great fault with tne political and legis
lative life of iliif! nineteenth century. This age
douies the church's powers to interfere or dic
tate, oi even advise; but the evils of the world
will never find their remedy until this world
and this age return again upon the old track
and kneel down before the church to receive
at her hand the graces of intellectual power
without immorality, of moral virtue audof the
snuctification of its society, until the nations
hear her voice once more, and whether they
put the crown upon her brow or not they will
admit her into theircouncil* and deliberations,
the only voice that for nearly 2000 years has
sounded on the side of justice, mercy and
ciemency, governing the rulers and saving the
people from the wad ambition of kings and
rulers."â Burke, 28KJ.
â¢'Paul V laid the republic of Venice under an
interdict in 1006 because of the insolence of
the Government in prosecuting two priests for
capital crimes and promulgating two edicts:
(1) Prohibiting the erection of any religious
houses without the consent of the Govern
ment; (2) The alienation of property from the
people to the church without the consent of
the republic."â Bullaruin Romanorum Edder
shtm,lO&.
Father Burke said there was a contest be
tween the authority of the church and the
authority of the Government. And when he
comes to this country and says the church
should have charge of the education of the
children I think he is claiming tor the church
dominion in temporal ailaire.
Supposing the Archbishop of San Francisco
got his salary as the Recorder or Sheriff, don't
you think the City of San Francisco should
have a voice in his appointment?
I will come to a close with this extract. You
will not believe it unless you have great faith
in me. I tola my friends that I did not think
the audience would believe it. It is from
"Elements of Ecclesiastical Law," vol. 3,
pages 310. 311, 312,314. 1 will translate from
the Latin. 1 reeret that I was educated in
the English rather than in the Continental
Latin. The pronunciation ia different. The
translation is as follows:
Canonical effects produced by excommuni
cation, even at present.
"The effects on the faithful are that they are
bound, as we have seen, to shun and avoid the
excommunicate (provided he is vitandus) like
a leper, spreading around him moral conta
gion and misfortune."â Ecclesiastical Law,
281).
In what particular social or civil matters is
it necessary for the faithful to shun the com
pany of a vitandus?
"SI pro deiictis anathema guis efficiatur, os,
orare, vale, communio, njensa negatur.' 1
First, by the word os is meant all sneaking
to or conversing with persons, publicly or
privately, by word of mouth or in writing, by
signs or words. Orare refers to private prayers*.
The faithful are bourd to shun tbe company
of a yitandus even in private prayers.
"Vnle" refers to external marks of respect or
friendship or benevolence, such as saluting,
etc. 'â Communio" refers tj every Kind of
daily, civjl intercourse, all association in busi
ness, etc. "Mensu." means eating with him in
the same house, etc.
Hence, also, all those who knowingly assist
at the funeral of avitandus and accompany
the remains to the grave are guilty of forbid
den intercourse with an excoinmunicant and
commit .sin. For intercourse with a vitandus
is forbidden, not only when he is alive, but
also \\ hen dead, until he ia absolved.â Â£cc,
312,310.
(iu<i forbid that any man should bo excom
municated in the Catholic church. The man
dips in the home and there is no one to assist
in washing tho body. Yet Roman Catholic
laymen wiil light for that institution with a
zeal thai is marvelous.
When I read that last quotation in my study
it was five or ton minutes before I could get
my eyes to read another line. I think of my
own family and I think of the Irish Roman
Catholics who are the most loving to their
wives and families and yet they are not al
lowed to have a friend come into their home
when there is a death, and the amazement is
their loyalty to the Roman Catholic church.
Do you wonder that we who read and think of
these things have the right on our side?

MUST TURN STOCK OVER
Five Thousand Shares of the S.
F. and N. P. Railroad
Out of Pledge.
THE DONAHUE ESTATE WINS.
End of the Long Seige of Litigation
Which Has Involved the
Donahue Road.
The litigation over the stocks of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad Com
pany has ended so far as the Superior
Court has been concerned. Judge Heb
bard has decided that the 5000 shares of
stock held by the defendants as security
for the satisfaction of certain claims
against the road or their value must go to
the plaintiff. These 5000 shares, valued at
$101,250, formed the principal feature of
the case.
When the San Francisco and North Pa
cific Railroad Company changed hands
from the Donahue estate to the present
owners, the Seligmans and their connec
tions here and in the East, it was agreed
that certain suits against the road should
be taken up by the old management, and
that the rights of way should be made
clear of all liens. These rights of way
played a most important part in the suit.
To secure compliance with these agree
ments 20,000 shares of the stock were
pledged to the Seligmans.
Soon after the pledging of these shares
of stock 15,000 shares were sold and the
proceeds were distributed. Then the re
maining 5000 shares were sold, but the pro
ceeds were not distributed, and for the
proceeds of this last sale the plaintiffs,
McGlynn and Burgin, as executors of the
Donahue estate, commenced suit. The
question rested upon whether or not the
agreement to secure which the stock was
pledged has been complied with.
The railroad itself intervened in the
suit, claiming that it was a party in in
terest. It demanded that the stocks be
retained from the plaintiffs. The de
fendants answered the complaint from in
formation and belief, and left the contest
of the case to the intervenor, after taking
from it an indemnity to protect them
from any judgment which might be en
tered. As a consequence the judgment
deals most directly with the intervenor.
In rendering decision Judge Hebbard
says:
The stumbling-block in this case has been
the expression in the contract of "liens for
right 01 way." There is such a thing as Hen
for right of way known to the law, which
exists, of course, where a right of way has
been sold and a vendor's lien is acquired lor
the unpaid purchase price.
in some States also, of which California is
not one, when a person is entitled to go into
possession afcter condemnation proceedings
brought under eminent domain, and before
paying the value of the land, the land-owner
then is given a lien for a rignt of way equiva
lent to a vendor's lieu.
But the right to this lien does not exist in
California.
In this case it nowhere appears that any one
has a vendor's lien upon any portion of the
railway company's roads by virtue of a sale
and purchase and non-payment of the pur
chase price, and no lien has been acquired by
any one by reason of the railway company
taking possession under condemnation pro
ceedings in eminent domain, and. therefore,
the railway company either owns all the rights
of way because it lias bought and paid for
them, in which case there would be no Hen, or
it is a trespasser, and if a trespasser only, the
owner of the land can have no lien, but is the
owner of the full title and may maintain eject
ment for its recovery. , .
Philadelphia R. K." Co. vs. Cooper, 105 Perm.,
239. :,<.>---â¢â¢ - '
There are no such liens for right of way
against the San Francisco and North Pacific
Railway Company, as the intervenor contends
is intended by the language of the contracts.
The language used means just the liens and
claims which, have been paid and discharged by
plaintiffs, and it is in evidence that on the Bth
of March, 18'.)5, the defendants, J. & \V. Selig
man and Landenberg, Thalmann & Co. so ex
pressed their opinion of its meaning in a tele
gram to defendant P. N. Lilienthal, and in that

telegram these defendants consented to a de
livery of the 5000 shares of stock, but the
delivery was not made by their agent here in
whose possession the stock then was.
Incidentally it may be said that the inter
venor now has title by adverse possession to all
of its lines of roads, having been in undis
turbed possession for much more than five
year*.
Let a judgment be entered for a return of
these shares of stock to plaintiff's as executors
of the estate of J, M. Donahue, and for plain
tiffs and against defendants J. t fc VV. Seligman
& Co. and Ladenberg, Thalmann A Co., in a
sum equal to the amount of interest on $101,

entry of the judgment, at the rate of 7 per

THE ANNUAL MEETING.
Election of a Majority of the Foster Combina
tion Directors.
The annual election for directors of the
San Francisco and North Pacific Railway
Company was held yesterday, and what is
known as the Foster combination suc
ceeded in electing the majority of tbe
board, while Sidney V. Smith, who repre
sented the minority, was not only left out
in the cold, but was deposed as the attor
ney for the company.
The directors chosen are A. W. Foster,
Andrew Markham, George E. NewhaJl, P.
N. Lilienthal, who compose the majority,
and A. Borel, J. B. Stetson, John L. How
ard, the minority.
After the result had been announced,
the gentlemen named with the exception
of Mr. Howard, who is not, in the City, oi- f
ganized and elected the following officers
by the majority vote: A. W. Foster,
president; P. N. Lilienthal, vice-presi
dent; Thomas Mellersb, secretary and
controller; H. C. Whiting, general mana
ger; the Anglo-California Bank, treasurer.
R. X. Ryan, general passenger ana
freight agent; \V. J. McMullin, his assist
ant, and W. G. Corbaley, superintendent,
are continued in their respective positions,
and, as the president said, "there will be
no change iv the personnel, except in the
office of attorney." Jesse W. Lili-jnthal
was chosen in place of Sidney V. Smith.
It was expected by parties interested in
the road, by reason of recent litigation in
which A. MT. Foster and Sidney V. Smith
figured as opponents, that an effort would
be mane to prevent the election, but no
move in that direction was made.
The capital stock of the company is rep
resented by 60.000 shares. Of this number
46,175 shares were, by the cumulative pro
cess in pursuance of an agreement run
ning for five years, voted for Foster, Mark
ham, Nfcwhall and Lilienthal, and 9195
shares were voted for the otner three.
The balance of the stocK was not voted, for
the reason that the proxies were not
legal, not having been registered ten days
before election.
Sidney V. Smith, who holds a little in
excess of 12,000 shares, voted for himself,
but the chairman, Sir. Foster, refused to
recognize the vote in view of the fact that
under the agreement they had been under
the contract voted by Foster and Mark
ham. By reason of this action, Mr. Smith,
who could have become a member of the
minority portion of trie board, was de
feated.
President Foster after the meeting said
he expects that steps will be taken to have
the election declared illegal, but believed
the action he had taken with retard to
Mr. Smith's stock was correct. He said
also that there was no talk of consolida
tion with the North Pacific Company.
Mr. Smith said he was not disturbed by
the action taken at the meetinc, for he an
ticipated the result, and in view of the re
cent decision of Judge Angelotti he had
prepared for future action. Judge Ange
lotti of the Superior Court of Marin
County was applied to some time ago by
Mr. Smith for an injunction to restrain
those who are parties to the agreement
from voting his stock, but the Judge de
nied the prayer ou the ground that the pe
titioner had ample remedy under the pro
visions of a section of the Civil Code, and
that reni'-dy is to commence an action to
set the election aside. Mr. Smith said this
would be done in the course of a few days,
and in that proceeding the question of the
right to vote the stock according to con
tract will be determined.
J. B. Stetson, one of the new directors,
is the general manager of the North Pa
cific Coast Railroad Company, and he and
others connected with the company own
16,000 shares, and it is claimed that these
in conjunction with Mr. Smith endeavored
to obtain control with a view to consoli
dating the North Pacific Coast and the San
Francisco and North Pacific Coast Railway
â companies.
A SOLAR STEREOPTICON
J. M. Hutchings, Yosemite's
Guardian, Strikes a
Clever Idea.
Utilizes Sunlight by Means of a Re
flecting Glass, in Place of the
Expensive Calcium.
James H. Hutchings of Yosemite Val
ley fame has perfected a very clever de
vice for utilizing the light of the sun for
stereopticon purposes. He calls his in
vention a "solar stereopticon."
It consists of a glass mirror, adjustable
by means of a slide and thumbscrew to
any angle, and the regular lenses of a
stereopticon. Its operation is simplicity
itself.
The stereopticon is set in a window, the
glass reflector extending outside in the
sunshine, while the lens end of it is in
the room. The window-sash is brought
down into the square groove on top of
the machine and serves to hold it steadily
in piace. Curtains are drawn over the
window and about the stereopticon and,
with the light excluded from the windows
and a sheet tacked upon the wall opposite,
everything is ready lor the entertainment,
supposing that the lecturer or showman
with his slides and his audience be there.
Such were the conditions in Mr. Hutch
ings' rooms on Sacramento street yester
day afternoon, the audience being a few
invited friends.
The orient sunlight, flashed through the
lenses by the little reflector not much
larger than a lady's hand-glass, did the
work of the cumbrous and expensive cal
cium lieht. As the sun moved and a
shadow was thrown upon the canvas a
touch of the thumbscrew brought the light
fairly into the cerHer again. The pictures
were thrown upon the screen with re
markable distinctness.
Mr. Hutchings is an expert with the
stereopticon, made so by years of its use
in his lecures upon the "Vosemite, and the
results gained with the reflecting glass givn
him the greatest satisfaction. He has
been working upon the apparatus for three
months past, and has just arrived at wiiat
lie considers Buccess, arid yesterday's little
entertainment was the first practical
demonstration he has given. Mr. Hutch
ings thinks his machine may be used with
great benefit in the public schools.
OPPOSED TO PAVING.
Mass-Meeting of Ninth-Avenue Prop
erty-Ownerg to Sidetrack a Super
visors' Resolution.
The property-owners on Ninth avenue,
between Fulton and Lake streeti, do not
want a bituminous pavement and granite
curbs with the expense incident to such
improvements.
A mass-meeting was held in Mohr
mann'B hall, on Clement street, last night
by members of the Point Lobos Club and
other real estate owners in that part of
the Richmond district to request the
Board of Supervisors to postpone indefin
itely the board's recent resolution to pave
in bitumen and sewer Ninth avenue, in ac
cordance with a petition presented by the
Richmond District Improvement Club.
The proposed pavement would be nearly
a mile long and, together with the granite
curbing, would necessitate an expense of
1150 each to each of the 350 lots along the
line, throughout the length of which there
are but twelve houses and three slieds.
That is why the property-owners object.
Not long ago one style of street for which
they had contributed was supplanted by
the present macadam and wooden curbs,
and the suggestion of a third change does
not meet with the approval of the men
â who have to bear the expense.
A memorial to the Board of Supervisor*
was drafted last night and signed by the
forty or more property-owners present.
The" concluding paragraphs practically de
clare that the expensive improvement is
not necessary nor is it desired by those
most interested, and a request is made to
the Board of Supervisors to file the inten
tion of the proposed work and to let the
whole matter rest until such time as per
sons owning a majority of the lots fronting
on Ninth avenue shall petition to have the
subject acted upon.
The following committee was appointed
by Chairman George R. Fletcher, presi
dent of the Point LobosClub, to wait upon
the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors: The Rev. Father Cayle,
Thomas Farrell, E. I? Dennison, Daniel
Fenton, Edward McGingley, John For
svthe, Felix McHugh, George W. Allen,
\\ llliam Crosby. The executive commit
tee of the Point Lobos CluO and as many
of the other property-owners as possible
will be present to add force to the expres
sion of sentiment.
J. G. Maloney, secretary of the Rich
mond Improvement Club, was at the
meeting. Replying to the insinuations
that the Richmond Improvement Club

was only for the good of the whole district
that last Octooer his club made the re
quest to the Board of Supervisors to have
Ninth avenue declared a boulevard. This
was done because on First avenue there
were two dangerous railroad curves, one
on the Sutro electric line and one on the
Sacramento-street cable line; because Sec
ond, Third, Fourth and Fifth avenues were
intercepted by the Bay District racetrack;
because Sixth, Seventh and Eighth ave

and finally because Ninth avenue was the
only available unfrane.hrsed thoroughfare
to be permanently secured as a driveway.
California Made Boilers.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa

made steam boilers in use as possible, and con
sequently its officers are constantly on the alert
to find prospective purchasers with the view of
inducing them to buy the homemade article,
price and quality being equal. Yesterday As-

do all in his power to patronize home indus
tries in porchasing two new boilers for the
water works of Sacramento.

Permit me to make a few remarks on the
screaming farce which Dr. Ross is now engin
nn^ There is no necessity of answering
his wild tirades against me personally. The
alleged lectures are their own best refutation.
1 he spite, vulgarity and indecency which char
acterize them are not unexpected. The public
knew what was coming, and showed true
American common-sense by remaining away
Monday night he had not 500 to heaT him.
Tc-night the attendance has dwindled down
to about 200.
I have already stated that if D. Ross pro
duced anything worth noticing I would reply
through your columns. I will do so now as
briefly as I can
BTIIE HISTORY OF THE CASE.
Exactly three months ago D. Ross at an A. P.
A meeting pretended to quote Irom a Roman
Catholic publication. An unnaturalized
Canadian, who devotes himself to the protec
tion of our American institutions, must neces
sarily be a fraud and a humbug. The quota
tions which he produced demonstrated that he
was a forger.
In a letter dated November 27 I challenged
the authenticity of these quotations. I denied
that they could be found in any Roman Cath
oUc publication. I went further, and denied
that the substance of them was Catholic teach
ings and I called on Ross to produce his proofs.
In order to make the matter a test, I offered
to submit the evidence to three non-Catholic
lawyers. The question was one merely of the
authenticity of certain documents and was,
therefore, a question with which lawyers would
be familiar.
Ross replied by executing a war dance on
the papers, accompanied by wild whoops for
a debate. I had charged him with deliberate
falsehood when he claimed to read from Rowan
Catholic publications. His answer was, â â¢!â â¢â¢
us argue the matter." If be had a spark of
intelligence or a grain of decency in his com
position he would have realized that his duty
was to produce the Roman Catholic publica
tions irom which he read, and to produce them
instanter. Hut no considerations of intelli
gence or deeenev availed with Donald Ross.
liÂ«* knew ho was telling an uirtrulh, and his
pulv concern was to stave off exposure as Jon;/
as possible. -.'â¢'.:'â¢:
lience [1 was that be deafened the public
with his Â« aoops for a debate. lie fixed a time
which wonld give him a quarter of a year to
prepare, aad with that solicitude for the "ba.x
pence" which characterizes nia kind, pro
ceeded to print ticket? and to sell them.
Tirae and time again 1 stated in my letters
that I weald not debate with him. If he
wl.-bed to produce his proofs in public and to
try to gull the people into paying something
for nothing it was none of my business. I let
him know decisively that I would not be a
party to humbug.
Now that he comes and whines that I have
not treated him fairly he is but carrying out
the unscrupulous and insincere policy which
has marked all' bis actions. This lizzie at the
Metropolitan Temple was Ross' own affair. He
alone is responsible for it; he has no right to
Â»iame me for the contempt which he has la
bored so hard to deserve.
This fiasco at the Temple, was simply a money
making scheme. He and Hubbell thought they
had (to use the common but expressive term)
".-truck a good thing." The good sense of the
community, however, has frustrated their
noble endeavor. The result can only be de
scribed in another slang expression as""a cold
frost."
THE JUDGES.
The scene presented as a curtain raiser on
Monday night when Mr. Hubbellfrom Jackson
ville, Oregon, called solemnly three times for
Mr. -.lie. would be ludicrous if it were not in
sulting. I hereby apologize to .Mr. Foote for
givinif those men a chance to use his name.
km! had already received Mr. Foote's answer
and knew that gentleman's position. Thecere
nnny of calling him solemnly three times to
come and appear were no doubt suggested by
the solemn appeals of the Jacksonville press
to Mr. Hubbell to return and pay his debts.
When the time came for the appointment of
the judges t ) decide the question at issue Ross
outraged decency by selecting a fellow named
Qultzow, who, in the absence of a worse,
presided at the Metropolitan Temple on Sun
days and regularly slandered the Catholic
church, finch, a confession â¢of a bad case
(daggered even the American Protective Asso
ciation. A committee waited on Ross to with
draw Quitzow's name. One of the local A. P.
A. sheets made the same demand. To-night
I: â.-ays that he withdrew Quitzow because
of my objections. Ross lies. I made no pro
test against Quitzow. I have not heard that
Mr. Foote did." Quitzow was simply shoved
into the garbage-wagon because the town could
not endure the smell.
Then Ross produced as his judge a man
named Sherman, whose foul mind ana fouler
tungne have been for many a year one of the
unsuppressible nuisances ot tne Pacific oast.
The public of San Francisco can well judge
of the fitness of this Sherman to act as an ar
biter by the statement he made this evening:
"I would not believe a priest under oath."
Certainly the Rev. Mr. Ross must have prayed
for bit and bridle to bind fast- Sherman's jaw
hen he heard that confession. "I would not
believe a priest under oath," and yet the fraud
lilted up his hand to heaven and swore to do
justice in a controversy in which a priest was
concerned. 1 "I would not believe a priest un
der oath." Let the statement stand on recod
as to the temper of Donald Ross and his un
biased judge.
Â SHERMAN'S FALSEHOODS.
The Monitor denominated Sherman as the
most conscienceless liar from Alaska to Terra
tfaego. Sherman gave evidence this even
.-of that journals discrimination. I have
n lime. Mr. Kditor, to enlarge on the matter,
â¢ et me take up a few of his statements and
(-i.aracterize them as they deserve.
FALSEHOOD NO. 1.
Sherman says that the Jesuits killed Abra
ham Lincoln," This is a he.
.-Herman says W'ilkes Booth received the
â¢Hcrameut from Bishop Spaulding. Another
Sherman says Booth wore a Catholic
i â dm around his neck. A third lie.
Lei me state here that the official records of
trial showed Jnst what was on Booths
dy when he was killed. There was no medal.
â¢ re were letters from the native place of
â  : Ross, â¢â  ho wing that the plot was
hntehed where D. Ross happened to be born.
To cut a long story short, let me repeat a few
facts on wnicli Bherroan might ponder, if he
can ponder on anything except Jesuits.
President Lincoln was murdered on the 14th
< â  r r:\, 1869, at the theater, by an actor
Mimed .1. Wilkes Booth, who entered the box,
m "t the President through the head, crying:
".-ir semper tyrannisâ the Pouth is avenged.
Nowhere in" standard works, neither in the
British nor American encyclopedias, ao we
find any charge that the Catholic church had
anything to do with the foul murder.
The great biography of Lincoln by J. G. Nico-
Ifty ana .John Hay, in ten volumes has not
even an njMnuation about the charge.
The official acts bearing on the entire sub
ject nave been published under the title, "The
Assassination of President Lincoln and the
'J riiil of the Conspirators," compiled and ar-
I by Ken Pittnian, recorder to the com
mission. Yet in them all there is not a single
cnarge against the Catholic church.

Si' t0 murder President Lincoln,
lo clinch these facts allow me to copy a let
ter signed by John G. Nicolay, one of the
biographers of Lincoln. It is in answer to an
inquiry cent by the Rev. P. Guldner ol New
\ork:
Washington. D. C, Dec. 3, 1894.
My Dear Sir: I hare not before answered
your letter of October 30 because I wished first
to consult my colleague, Colonel Hay, who has
been absent from the city until within a few
days.
To your first question, whether in our studios
on the life of Lincoln wo came upon the charge
'that the assassination of President Lincoln !
was the -work of the Jesuits," we answer that
we have read such a charge in a lengthy news
paper publication.
To your second question, viz., '"If you did
come across it did the accusation seem to be
entirely groundless?" we answer, 'Yes; it
seemed so entirely groundless as not to merit
any attention on our part.' Yours truly,
- - 'â  â ;.-. John G. Nicola y.
FALSEHOOD NO. 2.
Sherman brings out the old fiction about
Churubusco and gives himself as witness. In
answer permit me to oiler the following letter.
which proves that Sherman is like Ross and
the truth is not in him:

27,932 A. G.O.J
Mr. rtiilip O' Ryan, 519 Clay street, San Fran

tions to which enlisted men of the army be

prisoners were taken, and the official reports
of the assault and capture do not show that
any deserters from the United States army
were among the prisoners captured. Yours re
spectfully, J. ('. GIUIOBB,
Assistant Adjutant-General.
FALSEHOOD SO. 3.
Sherman then introduced that great and
good man, Chenequy, who, lie said, led forty
thousand Catholics from Romanism to Protest
antism, Of course he was lying as usual. He
did not tell that Chenequy nad been sus
pended, had been turned out of his office for
bad conduct. He did not tell that he was ex
pelled from the Protestant synod of Chicago
lor fraud. He did not tell that the whole
Presbyterian body rejected him. He is Indeed
a lit witness for Sherman and his ilk.
FALSEHOOD NO. 4. *
Sherman then read a long rigmarole about
Bishop Foley and a certain Stephen R. Moore.
1 wish to say here that the thing is a pure fab
rication. Moore is a bigot of the Sherman
stripe, and when the Rev. T. O'Sullivan of Chi
cago called upon him to substantiate his state
ments he admitted that no such records could
be found in the court. I hereby challenge the
whole matter as an outrageous fraud, and I
demand Sherman's proof.
DONALD ROSS.
So much for Sherman the unbiased, now for
Ross. His beautiful mixture of who's and
winch's has complete disdain for the cumber
some rules of syntax, his unprovoked assaults
on the Queen's English all mark the devotee of
the Little Red Schoolhouse.
â  But I have no time to waste on Ross' person
ality. Let us see what he does with the propo
sitions. He opens with the startling statement
that he never used them. They were inserted
in the Chronicie report by some concealed
Jesuit, presumably John P. Young.
If so, how is it they were printed also In the
American Patriot? How is it D. Ross never
came out like a man to deny that he used
them? He imagined he could get a little no
toriety and cash out of the defense of them,
and now, when he finds they are indefensible,
he would repudiate them.
MY CHALLENGE.
My challenge consisted of two parts:
1. That these propositions were not to be
found in Roman Catholic publications.
2. That the substance of these propositions
was not to be found in Roman Catholic pub
lications.
Iâ PROPOSITIONS are not found IN CATHOLIC
PUBLICATIONS.
These four propositions were read by Ross as
taken from Roman Catholic publications.
In their campaign literature the A. P. A.
spread them broadcast over the country as
genuine expressions of Catholic teaching.
In Josiah Strong's book, ''Our Country," they
were quoted from an "Encyclical."
Yet Mr. Editor, the four propositions are
forgeries, and Donald Ross knows it.
He knows it, because Josiah Strong admits in
the second edition of his book that he was mis
led.
He knows it, because he had at hand the
copy of the original propositions, which were
manipulated to produce these forgeries.
He knows that he could not find these propo
sitions in any Roman Catholic publication,
and- therefore he has not produced any Roman
Catholic publication, even though, he has had
a quarter of a year to search.
CONDEMNED PROPOSITIONS.
In order to explain the four propositions let :
me tell how the forgery was committed.
The Catholic church has the mission of teach
ing truth. This mission was given her by our
Lord when he said "Go into the whole world
and preach thÂ«Â» gospel."
This mission the church exercises in two
ways ; first, by asserting the truth second, by
condemning error. Thus she proclaims there
Is only one God. She condemns the statement
that there are less than seven sacraments.
When the church condemns error she gener
ally takes the error as expressed by those who
teach it. She selects a sentence from the works
of erroneous writers which sums up their false
teaching and she says, "Such a sentence is
wrong." These sentences are called "Con
demned propositions."
Now, therefore, when we wish to find out
what is the positive truth taught by the church
we have to consider these propositions very
fully. "Those who are familiar with logic
know that the contradiction of propositions is
a matter which requires very delicate hand
ling.
Thus, for instance, we find a condemned
proposition stating 'it is lawful fora man. to
marry two wives." The illogical man would
at once jump to the conclusion that the doc
trine which the church teaches is, "It is not,
lawful for a man to marry two wives." But
such would not be the mind of the church.
The proposition is condemned because of Its
vague and general character. And it Is just
as false to say "It la not lawful for a man to
marry two wives" a! it is to say "It is lawful
for a man to marry two wives."
, The true teaching is: It is not lawful fora
-man to marry a second wife during the life-
I time of the first. Or, again, suppose the con
demned proposition is, "It never rains in Cali
fornia." We do not contradict it by saying,
"It always rains in California." One proposi
tion is as false as the other. The contradictor
is, "it sometimes rains in California." This
assertion is quite true and contains the doc
trine put forward by the condemnation of the
proposition.
THE SYLLABUS.
Bearing this in mind, let us see where Ross
got his propositions. In IW-i a collection of
condemned propositions was published by
Plus IX. This collection is called the syllabus.
Now, If we turn to the syllabus, we will find
the forty-second proposition to run as follows:
LATIN". ENGLISH.' ."â¢â â â¢
XLir. In conflictu le- -In conflict between
gam utri usque potesta- the laws of the two pow
tis, jus civile pnevalet. era, the civil law prevails.
The proposition is. a universal affirmative,
and it means that always and in every case the
civil law should prevail. It is precisely the
same kind of a proposition as "It always rains
in California." AÂ«<fs*t?B>Â«
Because of its universality it is not true.
The American constitution recognizes cases
where the civil law does not prevail ncainst
the ecclesiastical. Indeed thej%im of the con
stitution is to remove from the domain of the
civil law matters which might cause a conflict.
Thus, for instance, our civil law does not pre
vail in spiritual ail'airp, it does not regulate
tbe services in ourchurches, the salaries of our
ministers. The proposition condemned by the
Pope is also condemned by our American sys
tem.
THE FORGERY.
Now what does Ross do? He takes this propo
sition Mid twists it around. He denies "it
never rains in California" by saying, "It al
ways rains in California."
LÂ«t me put the original proposition and
Donald Ross' version of the same in parallel
colums:
THE OKIOIKAI-. ItOSfi' FOROKRY.
XLII. In a conflict be- 1 In a case of conflict be
tween thiÂ» la <vs of the two tween the ecclesiastical
powers the civil law pre-i and civil poweri the ec
vails. cleslastical powers ought
|lo prevail.
.Let me say that these propositions are both
false, just as the propositions. "It always rains
in California" and "It never rains in Califor
nia" are both false. The true Catholic teach
ing is that in a conflict between laws of both
Powers justice should prevail. If the church
goes outsido her sphere and interferes
with the rights of the state, then the civil
laws prevail. If. the state cues outside her
sphere and interferes with the rights of the
church the church laws prevail. This is plain
common-sense and good American teaching.
In civil things civil laws rule, in spiritual
things spiritual laws prevail.
The history of this proposition is the history
of the other three. Thry are all, as I intend to
.show from day to day, distorted from proposi
tions in the syllabus. They are just as false as
the propositions which ihe church condemned,
and because they are false I denied '.bat they
could be found in Roman Catholic publica
tions.
11. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROPORTIONS. '
I also denied that the substance of the propo
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 2Â£, 1896.
sitions could be found in Roman Catholic puD
lications as expressions of Catholic teaching.
Let us therefore see what is their substance:
"In the case of conflict between the ecclesi
astical and civil powers the ecclesiastical pow
ers ought to prevail."
This proposition is universal. It means that
in every case of conflict between the ecclesias
tical and civil powers the former should pre
vail. It does not matter whether the ecclesias
tical power is a Pope or a beadle, whenever and
wherever it comes in conflict with the Civil
powers the civil power must give way.
It was to produce this idea that Ross read
the proposition at the Metropolitan Temple.
It was to produce this idea that the A. P. A.
distributed the proposition in order to pain
adherents. The church must be defamed at
all costs, and the best way to defame her is to
pretend that she is seeking a supremacy over
the state.
Now in the vain attempt to substantiate his
assertion that the Catholic church is seeking I
such a supremacy Ross produces a mass of
quotations.
He gives no references; produces no books. ;
The quotations are boldly torn from their con
textâ Wendteized in that skillful fashion pecu
liar to preachers. They mean nothing more
than what all Americans intendâ namely,
that we give to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and that we give to God things that
are God's.
The Catholic teaching is nothing more nor
less than that which every American citizen
believes and every American court practices.
OK MARRIAGE.
Ross reproduces the outrageous and vile
slanders of the A. P. A. about the Catholic
teaching concerning Catholic marriage. He
came back to that subject in his second lec
ture. Permit me to explain at some length
what we believe about marriage.
MARRIAGE A CONTRACT.
' The key to the understanding of the Catholic
teaching about marriage is to be found in the
idea that marriage is a contract. A contract
is defined by Webster as "The agreement of
two or more" persons upon a sufficient consid
eration or cause to do or abstain from doing
some act." The Catholic dictionary says
"Marriage is a natural contract between man
and woman." To us, therefore, marriage is an
agreement between man and woman by .which
they covenant to live together as husband and
wife. If we keep this definition clearly before
us it will not be hard for us to understand the
regulations of the church. . ;â¢:.'*
THE MINISTER OP MARRIAGE.
In the first place, then, as marriage is a con
tract, it follows that the contracting parties
alone are competent to make the contract.
Marriage does not consist in appearing before
any official of church or state. It consists
solely of the agreement to live together as man
and wife. Looting at the subject from a mere
natural standpoint, there is no reason why
this agreement should be made in the presence
of witnesses or after any specified mode or in
any particular place. Natural marriage is a
natural contract, and simple consent is suffi
cient to form it. As soon as that consent is
given the contract subsists, just as the contract
of buying and selling goes into effect as soon
as the seller accepts the terms offered by him
who buys.
IMPEDIMENTS.
Now it is well understood that all persons
are not capable of entering into contracts.
The tenant to whom you lease your house has
no right to sell it, because the "house does not
belong to him. If you have agreed to deliver
a certain parcel of goods for a certain price to
one person you cannot sell the same goods to
another person. Contracts made by persons
not in their right mind or in durance have no ,
value. The laws and customs of pecple hedge
contracts round with many conditions, all of !
which must be fulfilled before the contract can
be valid. the same way even in natural so
ciety the contract of inarnago is surrounded
by conditions which must be fulfilled under
penalty of having the contract declared null
and void.
Conditions which must be fulfilled before
the marriage contract can exist may be called
the impediments or hindrances to marriage.
Some of these conditions are necessary for till
contracts, some are peculiar to the marriage
contract. Thus, for instance, insane persons,
children, tho-e who are not free, who are held
by force, who are temporarily deprived of
their reason by drugs or drink, arc incapable i
of making the contract of marriage because
they are incapable of making any contract.
Thus two persons related to each other in the
first degree, though able to make other con
tracts, are not allowed to enter on the contract
of marriage, because, and this is peculiar to
the marriage contract, such closeness of rela
tionship injuriously affects the children who
are the offspring.
CLANDESTINITY.
Still looking at marriage as a mere natural
contract there is another condition or impedi
ment which deserves notice here. As we have
said, marriage Is a contract and in order to
enter upon it nothing more is required than
the consent of the contracting parties. Mar
riage, however, is peculiar in this that the
state or community has an interest in it. ; For
instance, tho transfer of property depends a
good deal on the marriage contract and in j
order to obtain security in titles it becomes i
necessary to take measures to control |
the marriage contract. The case is precisely
that of a man who wishes to sell land. The i
buying and selling can in the natural way be
consummated by the simple I consent of the i
parties concerned. But the state for its own
protection orders that the transaction be
entered on the public records. In the same I
way up to a year ago in this State of California
the contract of marriage was valid without !
witnesses or other formalities; but at the last
Legislature the State interfered and declined
that in mture the contract must be a public
contract made before witnesses under the pen
alty of nullity. This condition is called the j
Impediment of Clandestinity.
In Its highest ideal, and under the conditions
of its primitive constitution, marriage is a
contract which lasts until death, and it can
only be made by one man with one woman,
though by reason of the hardness of men's
hearts both polygamy and divorce have been
allowed. Now we come to another point of
viewâ marriage under the Christian dis
pensation. It is the teaching of the
Catholic church that Christ elevated the
natural contract of marriage to the
dignity of a sacrament called matrimony.
Just as he raised the natural washing with
water to baptism and the natural eating and
drinking to the euchnrist, so he made the
union of man and wife the sacramental em
blem of the union which exists between him
and fiis church. We must remember, however,
that this elevation exists only for Christians.
For tlio.se who are outside the pale of Christen
dornjinarriage is still the mere natural contract;
but for tr.oiu who profess to follow Christ's teach
ing for the baptized marriage is ever and above
this a sacrament whicn is governed by peculiar
laws nnd regulated by the conditions Imposed
by Christ himself. When Christ made mnr
riage a sacrament he did not festroy its char
acter as a coutract. Hence, according to Catho
lic teaching, the priest is not the minister of
this sacrament. The contracting parties are
the ministers. For some time before the
Council of Trent the presence of any wit
ness to the contract was not n< â ces
sary for Its validity before the church.
In other words, th 3 law of the church
on the validity ol '"contract marriages" or
"clandestine marriages" was precisely the
same as that of the Kate of California. The
same reason, however, which lftd the last Leg
islature to abolish "contract marriages" led
ihe Council of Trent to abolish "clandestine
marriages." It therefore decreed that in fu
ture no one could make a valid contract of
marriace except in the presence of the parish
priest and at least two witnesses. Jn order,
however, to preserve all rights the council
added that this law should not be operative
until proclaimed in each -parish. Hence it
came to pass that the law bound
only in countries which were Catholic,
while in the new Protestant countries it lias
never been proclaimed. Later on, when the
movements of jiopulation brought a majority
of Catholics into a Protestant country or a
number of Protestants into a Catheiic* coun
try, a grave difficulty arose. This was the
question of marriages between Protestants, or
between Catholics nnd Protestants, not cele
brated before the parish priest. In order to
meet this difficulty a decree was issued which
declared that the impediment of ciandesiinity
did not bind except where both parties are
Catholic. This decree holds in California,
and to-day if a Catholic marries a Protestant
before a minister or a Justice, though lie sins
grievously and scandalously, the church holds
the marriage to br: binding.
Hence I may sum up the Catholic teaching
on marriage In the following three proposi
tions:
1. The marriages of Protestants in California
(where the Council of Trent binds, and a
fortiori, outside of California where the Coun
cil of Trent does not bind) are valid iii the
eyes of the church-.
2. The marriage of a Catholic and of a Prot
estant (even before a Justice) is a valid mar
riage in the eyes of the church, though we
hold the Catholic party commits grave sin.
3. No marriage is invalidated by the Coun
cil of Trent in America, except the marriage
of two Catholics. As both the contracting
parties are Catholics they are supposed to obey
the laws of the church. If they don't like
these laws they can get out. But they cannot
be Catholics and still violate Catholic discip
line.
In conclusion, Mr. Editor, let me refer to a
wonderful discovery of I). Ross. He states
that the Pope read a. certaiu document to 2155
cardinals. Why did he not mate it 3t>s whiie
he was about it? This example of egregious
ignorance is a fair judge of the caliber of Don
ald Koss.
What he says of me personally does not
trouble me mm-h. lie said, however, that he
had a priest helping him in this controversy. I
hereby brand him as a malicious liar. No
priest had helped him in this controvery. He
has, however, consulted with a man who was
once a Catholicâ a sot and a fautor of Vhieves ;
but he is no more a priest than Donald Ross Is,
and to all the aid this befuddled tngrate can
afford I). Uoss is welcome. It becomes a slan
derer to consort with thieves.
Of course there is some excuse for Ross' pro
fanity and vulgarity, lie has fallen awfully
flat, and no wouder bis vanity is injured. Au
office boy, who now and again dips into poetry,
has delivered himself of the following jingle,
which summarizes the situation and the feel
ings of D. Ross: '.* " ":ii

He lifted up Ills voice, ' ; - 1

His sayings wore not choice.

POSTSCKIFTCM.
The second act of the comedy shows D. Ross
proving that the Pope and the priests ought to
have dominion over temporal, affairs. I re
mark with much surprise that Dr. Ross has
steered clear of the syllabus and has prac
tically confessed that he could not find the
second proposition in Roman Catholic pub
lications. â  " v ;
Let me explain, as briefly as I can, the
origin of this second proposition. Tne
twenty-seventh proposition of the syllabus
runs as follows, in Latin and English:
XXVI I. Eacri ecclc-sifu! The sacred ministers
I minisiri l:orr;nnus<]uejof the church and the
I pontif x ab Omni vcrum]Roman Pontiff should be
j temporatium cura ur entirely excluded from
dominie suut umnlno ail administration and
excJudendi. ownership of temporal
I things.
The word "dominium" means not dominion
1 but ownership and the sentence was written
| by a man who thought that the Pope and the
priests had no right to own even the coats on
i their backs.
When, however, D. Ross got hold of the prop
osition, he treated it as he did the fourth. To
show the unblushing character cf the forgery
I will put the translation and the misrepresen
tation in parallel columns.
The sacred ministers The Pope and the
of the church aud the priests ought to have
j Roman Fontiif should be <:<uriinion over temporal
entirely excluded lrom affairs. .
i all administration and
! ownership Of temporal j
things. I
â  This, then, was the statement spread all over
the country. It means as it stands that the I
Pope and tho priests ought to run everything
I âought to have dominion over temporal af
i fairs. D. Ross now comes with more of his
eviscerated quotations to prove that the Pope
1 and the priests persecuted, that marriage is a
: sacrament, that the city of Rome belongs to
i the Pope. Even supposing that all this was
true, what in trie name of common-sense has it
i to do with a general assertion that the Pope
j and the priests ought to have dominion over
temporal affairs?
The Catholic teaching about dominion over
! temporal affairs 1 have explained time end
time again. The church and the state are two
separate societies. One deals with spiritual
affairs; the other with temporal affairs. The
; dominion over temporal affairs belongs to the
; civil authority, not to the Pope' or tho priests.
This is Catholic doctrine. It is also American .
j doctrine.
No wonder Ross was afraid to face three law
â¢ yers who would not be deceived by the6purlous
j and irrelevant matter which he "inflicts upon
those who pay two bits to be humbugged. No
wonder he preferred to engage in a debate in
stead of producing his proofs.
In conclusion let me reiterate mv assertion
! that Ross is not helped by a priest. He says
! he does not know what a "fautor" of thieves
1 means. Let him sell some of his wonderful
j Catholic books and buy a dictionary.- He will
I there see that fautor means "one who gives
I countenance or support," "a favorer," and
j seeing he will understand what I mean by
j saying that the fuddled renegade who runs
j with him is a fautor of thieves. ,
WARDALL ON POPULISM
The Chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee Diagnoses
the Party.
UNION WITH THE SILVER MEN.
Tbe Leader's Views on the Necessities
and Prospects of the Populist
Faction.
E. M, "Wardall of Los Angeles, chairman
of the Populist State Central Committee,
yesterday gave an exposition of the condi
tion and hopes of the Populist party.
He has just returned from a six weeks'
tour of the East, during which he has
attended officially, as a representative of
the party in California, the meeting of the
Populist National Central Committee in
St. Louis January 17 and the supreme
council of the Farmers' Alliance held on
February 2. He was a member of a special
committee sent from St. Louis to the
silver conference at Washington on
January 22. During his Eastern trip he
met with the State Reform Press Associa
tion of Illinois, (;t Chicago, January 11,
stopped in many cities and talked with
many peonlo and spent a day with Gover
nor Waite at Denver. So he arrived here
last Saturday fresh from fountains of
political information.
When asked yesterday for the sum of his
impressions and an opinion on the party
in this State, he talked as follows:
The party is in good condition. We are con
fident of bie gains this year on our own ac
count irrespective of any affiliation with the
silver men or other reform elements. There
are no factions in our party anywhere as there
are in all other parties, and It is in a growing
condition.
At St. Louis we invited all friends of mone
tary reform to meet with us in St. Louis at the
time of our National Convention, July 22, and
In- subsequent agreement the silver men will
meet there at the same time. There will l>e
separate conventions and each conveutiorf will
adopt platforms expressive of its own views on
the silver nnd other questions, but the silver
men are going to make silver their only issue.
They will fight on thatquestion alone. If they
adopt the money plank advocated at the eoii-
KJCBS, it will embruce the full money question:
First, the unlimited coinage of silver irrespect
ive of international agreement; second, the
Government shall issue all paper money with
out the intervention of banking corporations
third, opposition to the issuance of interest
[tearing bonds In times of peace. It will favor
the issuance by the Government of sufficient
]>uppr money to provide an adequate volume
of currency.
All that is in harmony with our views on
the money question. "We will have other
planks in our platform, but what they will be
I ennnot anticipate. I think, however, that
our National platform will bo more simple,
direct and clear than four years ago. We will
not abandon any important principle, but our
platform will be pruned down in comparison
With our last one. I think that there will be
something* left out this year, but that a plank
favoring "direct legislation" will be iucorpo
rated, as it was not last time. My impression
is tnat our Slate plattorms this year will also
be brief and contain little more than the
National platform.
I anticipate that when tho Populist aud Sil
ver conventions meet at St. Louis there will be
appointed a conference committee to agree
upon candidates and I do not foresee any diffi
culty in effecting such en agreement. It is
anticipated that the PopuMsts and fcilver men
will be able in many States to vote for the same
Presidential electors, and to agree upon Con
gressionul and legislative tickets. In such"
cases the Populists would divide the repre
sentation with the silver men. There may
and likely will be a unioa in some States upon
State officers, but the main combination would
naturally be upon electors and upon legisia
tive tickets.
There is a feeling throughout our party that
we are sure of carrying a number of States
without any assistance. We are particularly
strong in Texas, North and South Carolina,
Alabama ana Georgia, and we expect to be
able to carry those States. In the West we are
similarly strong, in Colorado, Kansas, Ne
braska and North Dakota. In all these States
we will show greater strength than ever before
and, as 1 say, I think we will be able to win
without assistance.
My impression is that the silver men are
thoroughly in earnest and that they will go in
to light for their one principle irrespective of
party, and will not be deterred from it by any
thing. It takvs courage to do that and I re
spect men who will do it. In our opinion the
money question rises in importance above the
tarifr and other questions, We now have ten
representatives in Congress including the five
Farmers' Alliance Congressmen from North
Carolina, and we expect to mske large Con
gressional gains in the coming campaign.
At the session of the Reform Press Associa
tion of Illinois, which I attended, there were
seventeen papers represei.ted, two of which
were Prohibitionist organs, and Mr. Harvey of
"Coin's Financial School" whs there. It was
unanimously decided to advocate a union of
all the forces in the State advocating mone
tary reform. There will this year likely be a
union everywhere to a large extent with the
Prohibitionist element. Our principles are
the same 'with the sole exception of prohibi
tion.
Governor Waite, whom I saw, is not a very
active man now. He is an excellent man. but
too radical to be a great success in politics.
But he is a man of generous impulses aud
honest and true.
In California our campaign will concern
only Presidential electors and Congressmen,
anal cannot predict what will be done here
until after the conference of the silver men
and Populists in St. Louis in July. As far as I
have been able to observe there is the best of
feeling between the Populists and silver men
in this State. No party in this State is in
better condition than ours. It has no factions
and no bosses; it is having big accessions
right along.
In the last campaign our average rote on the
State ticket was (50,000. I can't say how big a
vote we will poll this time, but my opinion is
we will carry the State. The Prohibitionists
in this State will vote for prohibition iirst and
with us next. They are generally Populists,
except on the point of prohibition. There are
10,000 Prohibitionists in this State, and we
wiil get at least half of this vote for our State
ticket, which we did not get before. The lead
ers of the Prohibition element this year favor
getting the reform elements together.
Then the amendments to the Australian bal
lot law paese.l at the last session of the Legis
lature will give us one man In every polling
booth in the State, and that will be worth
many votes to us. The amendments regarding
the voting of illiterates will also give us many
votes. Then I apprehend thnt the silver men
In this State will not ."top at Presidential elec
tors, but will vote with us for Congressional
and Legislative nominees. The natural growth
of the party will give us many thousand votes
without any combination or reform forces,
and for these reasons 1 predict that we will be
strictly in it this year.
1 haven't had time yet to talk to many sil
ver men since I returned, but if the effort at
combination succeeds at the National Conven
tions 1 suppose it will succeed here.
There will not be any great activity in the
party in this State or elsewhere before the
National Convention meets, because our action
will depend so largely upon the action of the
National Convention. In the meantime there
will be little talk about the men who will be
nominated at the National Convention. Onr
nominees there will depend largely upon the
conference with the silver men, and in the
meantime nobody will be boomed for office in
our party.
The State Central Committee held a meeting
last October, at which it was decided that the
State Convention should meet in Sacramento
at a time to be designated by me. Within a
short time 1 shall issue a call for a primary and
fur a meeting of the State Convention early in
May. lieyoud that little will be done soon
besidestliedistributionof literature, which will
especially consist of the speeches of Tillman
and iiutler.
Mr. Wardall will remain in the City for
tv.-o or three days and then return to Lcs
Angeles. . â 
COOK WILL MOVE.
His Courtroom Will Be Given Over to
Police Judge Campbell in
Future.
The Board of New City Hall Commis
sioners at their meeting yesterday decided
to relieve Police Judge Campbell from the
burden of holding court any longer in the
basement of the City Hall and to provide
him with a room on the first floor.
Justice Cook signified a willingness to
move if other quarters were prepared for
him, and it was decided to give his room
to Judge Campbell. Justice Cook will be
given quarters on the second floor.
The Commissioners declined to grant
the application of J. C. Pelton, the pioneer
educator, for quarters for himself and
family in the Hall.

BROWN PRESENTS
NEW EVIDENCE
Deacon Dexter Tells of a
Visit Mrs. Stockton
Made.
"WOULD LIE OR STEAL."
Rev. John Ray of Sonoma Also
Comes to the Rescue of the
Pastor.
MRS. DAVIS' GRAVE CHARGES.
The Story of the Now Famous Turkish
Tea Is Related in Minute
Detail.
Dr. Brown had an innine before the
ecclesiastical council, which, after a four
days' rest, met in the assembly-room of
the First Congregational Church yester-
day. The pastor sprang a surprise in the
person of Key. John Ray, formerly his
associate, but now located at Sonoma, and
followed this up by introducing Deacon D.
Cilbert Dexter.
The testimony of the two witnesses was
in rebuttal in a limit-ed way to the state
ment of Mrs. Stockton, and they succeeded
in throwing many side Lights on the win-
Borne widow's oft-repeated story.
As early as 1 o'clock the entrance to the
lecture-room was besieged by hundreds of
people, mostly ladies. "When the doors
were finally opened there was a wild rush
for Beats, which soon resulted in bringing
about a "standing-room only" state of
things. Men and women were content to
group themselves aloi.g the wall, deter
mined evidently net to miss anything
worth seeing or hearing.
Mrs. Brown, Miss Overman and young
Valentine Brown came early, securing
scats in the front row and immediately op
posite the moderator. Across the aisle,
one seat back, sat Mrs. Cooper, her daugh
ter, Miss Hattie, and Mrs. Lena Blanchard,
the lady who indulged in a lit of hysterics
on the occasion of her last appearance in
the council chamber. Mrs. Stockton was
DOt present.
There were many new but well-known
faces among the tlircng anxious to wit
ness the proceedings. Many had come
.-i to get a glirupse of Miss Overman and
i'r. Brown, while others had been drawn
to the sacred edifice unuer the impression
that Mrs. Davidson would be placed on the
stand.
Ex-Supervisor Burling was conspicuous
in the midst of those who found thenu
telves without cliair^ after the tirst great
rush for seats was over. Archie McMil
lin. whose name has been mentioned in
connection with that of Mrs. Stockton,
was also present.
At ten minutes after 2 the council filÂ«Â»d
into t lie lecture-room and, after a fervent
prayer by Rev. Mr. 'lenney and the reading
of the minute's, proceeded directly to the
matter in hand. Rev. John Kea was the
first witness called, and it \vaÂ« plainly evi
dent that he wa> somewhat of a surprise
to the prosecution.
Though his testimony was not particu
larly strong, yet it was helpful to the pas
tor's cause in showing that lie as assistant
to Dr. Brown iiad never seen Mrs. Stock
ton in conversation with the latter or
knew of her visits to the office. As he was
at the church during the busy hours of the
d ly Mr. Rea did not think it likely that
Mr-. Stockton could have been a constant
visitor without at some time coming under
his observation.
"It seems to me,'' he said, "that all the
sorrow and suffering of San Francisco was
resting on the shoulders of Dr. Brown at
that time. F.very one who had trouble
seemed to come to him for advice and
assistance. The amount of work he did
was nothing short of wonderful. It would
Lave killed me in two weeks' time."
Deacon D. Gilbert Dexter was next
placed on the stand. He told a short,
concise story of a visit Mrs. Stockton paid
him three or four weeks ago.
"She told me." saia Mr. Dexter, "that
Bhe would be willing to lie for Dr. Brown â
yes, steal for him, if he would but keep
still. I gathered from her conversation
that she actually Knew nothing against
him, bxil had been forced into her present
position."
Deacon Dexter said he had told all this
to Dr. Brown, who replied that he had
nothing to conceal, but, to the contrary,
insisted on the fullest inquiry. The wit
ness had heard of the 'lurkish tea ir.ci
dent, but was not then aware that Mrs.
Stockton was a member of the church.
During the afternoon session Dr. Brown
r.iade a formal request that Mr.?. Stockton
be recalled for cross-examination. That
lady has, however, declared her intention
not to a^ain appear before the council.
Mrs. May Davis in the course of her tes
timony-declared that Mrs. Stockton said
6he had used all her arts on the pastor, but
without success. She intended to ruin Dr.
Brown, however, because he would not re
fuse the church to Mrs. French for the
Turkish tea.
Mrs. Davis also swore that Minnie Falk
had declared to her Mrs. Stockton's at
tempt to blackmail Governor Perkins, Dr.
Brown and others, and Mrs. Stockton had
also threatened Mrs. French, and at one
time endeavored to attract the latter's
husband.
Mrs. French told all about the Turkish
tea and a quarrel she had with tne pastor,
in which both had said a good many harsh
things. When Mrs. French had completed
her testimony Dr. Brown made the'some
what peculiar acknowledgment that the
moment he and Mrs. Stockton left the
Louse of the witness he became convinced
that the widow had designs upon him.
Judpe Advocate Wadhams announces
that Mrs. Davidson will be the iirst wit
ness placed on the stand to-day. Her ex
amination will probably consume the en
tire afternoon.
After the council adjourned last night,
an informal meeting was held. A com
mittee of three, consisting of Rev. Mr
Kader, E. C. Williams and Rev. Mr. Ten
ney, were appointed to visit Mrs. Eaton in
Oakland and receive her statement.
Mrs. Eaton has refused to appear before
the council, but is willing to tell what she
knows under the conditions above named.
Dr. Brown will accompany the committee.
Tne council will meet to-day at2o'cioct.
THE PROCEEDINGS.
Deacon Dexter Substitutes a
Long Story About Mrs.
Stockton.
Mrs. Brown arrived after the lecture
room at the First Congregational Church
was well tilled yesterday afternoon. Miss
Overman, however, had reserved a seat for
her and the two women fell to whispering
with each otner, the younger one's face
gradually assuming a drawn and much
perplexed expression. Next to Miss Over
man sat Valentine, the Dastor's son, and
across the aisle, on a line with the mem
bers of the Brown household, Mrs. Cooper
and Mrs. Lena Blanchard occupied adjoin
ing chain* The council opened at ten
minutes after 2, at which time the crowd
had increased to such a degree that the
atmosphere was stifling.
The Rev. Mr. Tenny of San Jose led in
prayer. The petition was brief and con
sisted mainly of an iniploration for the
spirit of wisdom on behalf of the council
and a prayer that the congregation might
be blessed* with the gift of patience and
fortitude.
The rollcall and reading of the minutes
followed. Dr. Brown requested the min
utes be corrected so as to read that he had
asked that press representatives be ad
mitted to all sessions of the council. His
request was granted.
The first witness examined was the Rev.
John Ray, former assistant pastor of the
church, at present living in Mill Valley
He said he had been superintendent of the
Sunday-school from July, 1893, to July,
181)4. lie continued, in answer to a ques
tion by the prosecutor:
"I know Mrs. Stockton slightly. She
was received into membership about the
time of the Nrrvember communion. At
the request of Dr. Brown I made inquiries
about her before her admission, as is fre
quently done in similar cases, and could
lind nothing against her. That is to say, I
made inquiries of a minister about Mrs.
Stockton, but I cannot remember who he
was, or where he lived, or what was his
name."
Un being pressed as to any further con
versations regarding Mrs. Stockton, the
witness admitted that Mrs. Brown had
objected to Mrs. Stockton being in the
choir during the Smith revival meetings
in 1894. Dr. Brown and his wife gave no
reason for this attitude toward Mrs. Stock
ton, and the witness asked no questions.
As to the Turkish tea incident the wit
ness had heard from Mrs. French that she
had notified Mrs. Stockton not to appear
at that event, nor to take part In it under
any pretext. About that time Dr. Brown
appeared very much worried and harassed.
He was much occupied with church busi
ness, and was frequently kept very busy
for several successive hours almost daily.
The doctor did not, however, remain at
hie oHiee in the evening. The study door
was locked when the room was unoccu
pied, lie had never seen Mrs. Stockton
converse with Dr. Brown, as far as he could
recollect.
In response to a question by Dr. Brown
Mr. Ray said he could partially recall
writing to the Rev. Mr. Chase of Sonoma
at Brown's request for information regard
ing Mrs. Stockton. He complained that
his memory was poor and frequently re
ferred to a paper, Which he said contained
notes copied from his diary, but none the
lc~s his usual answer was, "I don't remem
ber."
Mrs. Davidson was next called. The
pastor interposed a vigorous protest to the
admission of Mrs. Davidson to the stand
before the Stockton matter should be thor
oughly ventilated. A warm discussion on
sued, which was only ended when it tran
spired that, though called to testify, Mrs.
Davidson was not present.
Deacon Dexter then read the following
written statement:
At 10:30 a. v., January 25, '96, Mrs. Stock
ton of 014 a Mason street came Into my office,
handing me her card by way of introduction.
Several friends were in the office at the time.
She said she wished to see me alone. I went
into the hall front on Mason street, near the
elevator, on the sixth floor, and she said:
â¢â¢Haven't you a private office?" I replied, "No,
but wo can talk here." She said: "All right.
I wish to talk with you about this unfortunate
affair of I'r. Brown's. I have confidence in
yon, Mr. Dexter, from what 1 hear of you from
others, or should not come to see you at this
time. I sent word for you to come to my
rooms, but not seeing you I finally thought it
my duty to come to see you at your office. I
come only on a mission of peace toward Dr.
Urown that I may be able to assist him in this
hour of his terrible trouble, as well as that of
his family. I have great regard for him and
his family and friends and 1 have no desire to
harm him in any way.
â¢'With the wish to avoid any further trouble
on my part is the principal reason why I have
called upon you. Yes, I may say the only
reason is that you may convey this, my earnest
wish, to him. Tell him not to have me called
into this case any further. Let me say to you,
Mr. Dexter, that I have always had the highest
regard for Dr. Brown in all respects. He Is a
man of great ability, and I believe he is one
who is able to do great good In the world.
Now, let me say that I have come of my own
volition ami have not been prompted by any
one in coming to see you. lam a poor, "weak
woman, all alone In the world, not seeking
notoriety, but desiring peace â peace with all.
1 have been misquoted and misunderstood.
If Dr. hroivu had iir<t let me alone 1 fihuuld
have said nothing, but being attacked I must
defend myseif as a matter of course. You can
see that, and in that 1 consider 1 was not to
blame.
"I may say to you I have friends who would
do a great 'deal for me if I should c-ai! upon
them, but I have not and shall not, unless I
am driven to the wall, then I shall defend my
self, and they will, without doubt, help me "if
I should say so. This Ido not want. 1 desire
peace, and will keep peace if Dr. Brown so
wills it. Yes, more, iet me say, I would be
willing to lie for Dr. Brown or steal for him,
if I could help lift his burdens, provided he
will let me alone. This 1 wish you to convey
to him personally from me, as I cannot reacji
him, but you can, and I come *o you, believing
you to be a just and true man, from all I have
heard of you, Mr. Dexter. I think I never met
you before to speak to you; at least, I do not
remember that I have, but I believe you will
deal justly by me, from all I hear of you."
I told Mrs. Stockton I was not aware that I
had ever met her before on any occasion, ana
should not have known her until she intro
duced herself at my office to-day. I told her I
should try to deal "justly by her and all con
cerned in this unfortunate affair. That above
all things I desired that truth to be known, the
guilty exposed and punished and the innocent
to be exonerated. To that end all my efforts
had been directed and would be to the end.
Mrs. Stockton replied, "I believe you Mr.
Dexter, and that is why I come to you as I do,
believing in you."
Finally she" said, "Now I shall rely upon you
to convey my message to Dr. Brown, and say I
wish to help nim and not harm him and not to
drag my name into matters any further, but
let me aloueâ that is what I desire above all
things, to be let alone."
In response to a question by Dr. Brown,
Deacon Dexter read the following supple
mental statement:
On Monday morning, January 27, 1 -went to
Dr. Brown's house about !) o'clock and told him
what Mrs. Stockton requested me to say to
him. Dr. Brown replied: "If Mrs. Stockton
should call to see you again you can say to her
from me that I will enter into no agreement
with Mrs. Stocktonâ l will make her no
promises. This scandalous matter must be
sifted to the bottom. I shall make no attempt
to keep it from the public, and I defy Mrs.
Stockton."
The deacon could not alfirra that Mrs.
Stockton had made anything like a threat
to injure Dr. Brown in case her name was
dragged into the scandal.
At this point the council retired into
secret session for the space of an hour.
Dr. Brown met a young lady in the vesti
buJe and had an animated conversation
with her, during- which he took copious
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1896.
MRS. DAVIS ON THE WITNESS-STAND.
notes in a small memorandum-book.
Shortly before 5 o'clock the members of
the council re-entered the lecture- room.
No explanation of the mysterious ab
sence was vouchsafed, and when the mod
erator declared the council in open ses
sion once more Dr. Brown asked that Mrs.
Stockton be called. That lady failed to
respond to her name, and then Mrs. May
Davis was requested to take the stand.
Before commencing her testimony on
cross-examination. Mrs. Davis protested
against the unfeeling manner in which one j
of the morning papers had referred to an |
impediment in her speech.
"When I was a voting girl," she said, "I
nursed a family of children through an
attack of diphtheria, and at last caught the
disease myself. I lost my voice as a re
sult of this illness, and have been sensi
tive on the matter ever since. It wounded
mp severely to see that one of the papers
referred to me as having spoken through
my nose. "
At this a titter circulated among a con
tingent of the "baser sort" who tilled a
certain portion of the hall. Pale with in
dignation, the venerable moderator sprang
to his feet and launched a scorching repri
mand at the unfeeling vulgarity displayed
by those who had laughed at the witness'
affliction. He then in courteous tones re
quested Mrs. Davis to disregard the Ha- j
grant exhibition of ill-breeding, as coming i
from persons beneath her notice.
Mrs. Davis then repeated her statement I
of last Friday night, to the effect that Mrs. j
Stockton had told her that she intended I
ruining Dr. Jlrown. Mrs. Stockton swore
eternal vengeance against the pastor and I
against Mrs. French, owing to the Turkish
tea affair. The doctor, according to Mrs.
Stockton, had also aggiieved that lady by
showing himself impervious to her biand- '
ishments. Mrs. Davis was of the opinion j
that Mrs. Stockton was a fallen woman, j
since she had asked who the rich men of
the congregation were.
A long discussion here ensued ns to the
propriety of admitting third-hand testi
mony. The moderator was much against
such evidence being received.
"Why," he remarked, "if you admit
what Mrs. Smith said to Mrs. Jones, and
Mrs. Jones said to Mrs. Robinson, and
Mrs. Robinson said to somebody cisc, you
can easily ruin the best man living."
A majority of the council aereed in this
view and Mrs. Davis was requested to
speak only on matters which had come
under her immediate observation. She
went over a preat portion of her former
testimon}* and said she would never repeat
Mrs. Stockton's ianguage about Mrs.
French. She intimated, however, that the
Mason-street lady, goaded to desperation
by Mrs. French's treatment of her, had
threatened to alienate the affections !
of Mrs. French's husband. Mrs. Davis had
had no quarrel with Mrs. Stockton, but the
little lady's last dress, according to tho
witness, was not paid for. and the Sheriff's I
officer sent to collect the money had not j
been able to effect an entrance into Mrs. i
Stockton's rooms for the purpose of at
taching the piano.
When Mrs. Davis had concluded Dr.
Brown requested that the Stockton matter
be set at rest before any other evidence
might be introduced. This caused some
difference of opinion and the council forth
with retired into secret session.
At the opening of the evening session
Dr. Mooar led in prayer, the petition be
ing for grace to speak and act. in a way
free from malice, fear or prejudice. The
| closing supplication was for light and aid
from on high, so that the deliberations of
the council might result in a complete and
full discovery of the truth.
Mrs. Sarah B; Cooper was the first wit
ness. She identified a packet of letters ad
dressed to herself, which the judge advo
cate showed her as being the communica
tions from Port Angeles in relation to Mrs.
I Stockton's indebtedness in that place.
She detailed Mrs. Stockton's kindergarten
work, citing t-evoral instances of the lady's
devotedness to her labors.
"Do you know, Mrs. Cooper," asked Dr.
Brown, "whether any prominent man in
Port Angeles asked Mrs. Stockton to go to
that town?"
"I do not," was the laconic answer.
Regarding Mrs. Stockton's Port Anceles
kindertra'ten work she said she liad hoped
it would be enduring, but it had. been im
peded by financial adversities. When
asked what she meant by Mrs. Stockton's
being "a little gay," Mrs. Cooper said she
meant nothing seriously bad. Mrs. Stock
ton did not resume teaching after her re
turn from Port Angeles because she did
not wish to do so- The teachers in the
kindergartens under Mrs. Cooper's control
were generally not changed until they

married. The witness said that it would
be far better for the work if half the
teachers were to be married off, but that
they seemed to take their time in assum
ing the bonds of matrimony, at which a
laugh arose.
She had never heard that Mrs. Stockton
had been co-respondent m a divorce case
in Port Angeles, and had never questioned
her as to that matter. As to Nirs. Stock
ton's line feathers, when interrogated by
Dr. Brown, the plucky widow replied: "I
always considered such tbings none of my
business, Dr. Brown."
Mrs. French was the next witness after
Mrs. Cooper left the stand. She refused
to testify unless her picture should be kept
out iif the newspapers. On being reas
sured on this score, Mrs. French, attired
in a simply yet elegantly made calling
costume, half concealed by a sealskin
wrap, and with her head crowned by a
dainty toque of black point lace, took the
oath and seated her^eif on the witnesses'
chair. At times during her testimony she
glanced nervously toward the audience, as
though mutely requesting aid from some
friend amid the sea of bonnets which con
cealed floor, chairs and everything save
the walls and ceiling of the auditorium.
The well-worn Turkish tea episode was
rehearsed in all its details. Mrs. French
acknowledged having requested Mrs.
Stockton to refrain from attending, and
said Dr. Brown had twice remonstrated
with her on that account. He told her
that by suspecting Mrs. Stockton the wit
ness was doing a grare injury to that
lady's reputation. Mrs. Brown was presr
entatthe lirst of these interviews. The
second took place at the witness' house.
She and the pastor both became much ex
cited and angry words were exchanged.
Dr. Brown insisted that Mrs. Stockton's
name should be returned to its place on
the programme.
"I told him I would not let Mrs. Stock
ton take nart in the tea even if he were to
pile the ifoor of the room with gold pieces
and offer them to me, 1 ' said Mrs. French.
The witness further stated that Mrs.
Stockton, who had come with Dr. Brown,
took little or no part in the conversation,
interjecting only an occasional word, but
she appeared to be very much incensed.
Dr. Brown here remarked that Mrs.
Stockton had duped and cajoled him into
goinj; to Mrs. French's house on the oc
casion mentioned. At a later date he sent
a note of apology to Mrs. French's hus
band asking pardon for his excited be
havior.
Regarding Miss Overman Mrs. French
refused to speak, as she claimed to know
nothing of her. She had beiieved her to
be a young girl and was much surprised
to learn of her being a married woman.
Mrs. Davidson, the witness said, had come
to her house on the Saturday night pre
ceding Christmas day, 1895, in a most dis
tressed and disheveled state.
From her the witness heard for the first
time of the pastor's alleged relations with
Miss Overman. On the following day she
asked Mrs. Davidson to dinner and al
lowed her to remain in the house until the
morning of Christmas day. Mr. French
had expressed the idea that Mrs. David
son's mind was deranged, and the witness
invited her to her house in order to save
her from trouble. The story told by the
old woman kept the witness in a continual
ferment, and on Christmas morning Mrs.
Davidson left, having employed most of
her visit in the preparation of two vol
uminous memorials, one intended for the
Rev. Dr. McLean and the other for the
church trustees.
The witness said she did not again see
Mrs. Davidson until the morning of her
arrest, the circumstances of which she
described in detail. The witness was sur
prised to learn the crime for which Mrs.
Davidson was apprehended and asked her
if the charge were true. After being In
terrogated three times Mrs. Davidson
acknowledged that there was some trouble
about a matter of $.500, but did not enter
into any explanation. Mrs. Davidson had
never said anything about money matters
in connection with Dr. Brown, save to
commend him for his charity to Miss
Overman in aiding her with $35 a month.
The witness refused to say who had in
formed her that Mrs. Stockton was an im
proper person to take part in a church en
tertainment, but said it was not Mrs.
Davidson.
Dr. Brown then took Mrs. French in
hand and subjected her to a searching
cross-examination. In answer to his ques
tions she said she had herself placed Mrs.
Stockton's name on the programme of ex
ercises at the Turkish tea, and had taken
it off when informed that Mrs. Stockton
was a woman of questionable character.
The disagreement with Dr. Brown on the
occasion when he endeavored to induce
her to refrain from expelling Mrs. Stock
ton from the Turkish tea episode had, she
said, so upset her that she was unable to
celebrate her silver wedding, which oc
curred a few days later, and she was still
suffering from the effects of that encoun
ter.
On the following communion Sunday,
Mrs. French said, she abstained from re
ceiving the sacrament, as her mind was so
pained and angry that shs considered her
self unprepared. On coining from church
she met Mrs. Cooper, to whom she men
tioned her difficulties and perplexities.
Mrs. Cooper told her to take heart and not
give way to discouragement, as all would
turn out for the best, and that perhaps the
witness might be able to do noble work in
the cause of truth and right.
After Mrs. French had left the stand a
resolution was adopted to the effect that
in future all evening sessions of the council
adiourn at 9:30 o'clock. The council then
retired into secret session.
Struck by a Car.
Peter Economates, who has a confectionery
store at 113 Powell street, was crossing Powell
street la.st night to board an O'Farrell-street
car when he was struck by a Powell-street car
and thrown to the ground. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital suffering from an abra
sion of the right leg and the face and a contu
sion of the left leg.
Dockery'g Salary in Danger.
The chances are that the Finance Committee
of the Board of Supervisors, at its meeting on
Friday, will order Auditor Broderick to refuse
to sign the salary warrant of Milk Inspector
Doekery and that a coullict of authority will
be precipitated between the Board of Super
visors and the health authorities.
TEMESCAL IS FAVORED
Commended by a Committee of
the Eegents for the Wil
merding School.
Mayor Sutro's Site Not Found Accept
able â Governor Budd Vigorously
Booms Stockton.
Repents of the State University met at
the Mark " Hopkins Institute yesterday
afternoon and discussed proposed sites for
the Wiltr.erding School. Without reach
ing a decision the subject was deferred
until March 31 next, when the Regents
will hold a special session on this topic.
The Regents attending yesterday were
Budd, Crocker, Black, Marye, Chase,
Reinstein, Phelps, Keliogg, Bartlett, .Mar
tin, Miller, Hallidie and Houghton.
Timothy Guy Phelps was called to the
chair before the Governor came in.
Regents Miller, Bartlett, Hallidie, Marye
and Martin, constituting the committee on
site, presented an elaborate report, setting
forth that offers of land as follows had been
made:
Adolph Sutro, land in San Francisco.
Citizens of San Leandro, land in that place.
C. A. Hooper, land in Redwood City.
Castro-street Land Company, land in San
Francisco.
James D. l'helan, land in San Jose. â 
P. K. Shattuck, land in Berkeley.
Hugh Dimond and A. C. Brandemuhal, land
in Fruitvale.
F. A. Berlin, laud in Oakland.
W. W. Judson, land in Oakland.
Citizens of Lake County, iand in Lakeport.
Katie Duyer. land in Login, Alameda County.
James Duun, land in Oakland.
Thomas Badger, land In Oakland.
Louis N. Hagar, land at Laundry Farm.
Shainwald, Buckbee i Co., land in Alameda.
The committee reported that the sites
offered at Redwood, San Jose and Lake
port bad been considered unfavorable on
account of the distances from Berkeley.
Concerning Mayor Sutro's offer the re
port of the committee contains this para
graph:
"The site offered by Mr. Sutro is thought
to be too far out of town to ever become
a successful competitor to the Lick and
Cogswell schools, which are supposed to
offer the. same advantages to poor boys
to whom time and car fares must be an
object." â  .-
Mr. Shattuck's offer for land at Berke
ley was understood to be withdrawn, and
therefore the committee had narrowed
down its choice to two sites â one at
Temescal and the other in Oakland.
It was explained to the resents that it
wa3 generally admitted that the $400,000
donated by Mr. Wilmerding should be de
voted to the maintenance of the school,
and not a dollar of the principal should be
expended for land or buildings.
The calculation was made that the land
would be given and that the interest on
$400,000 would provide $2000 a month
toward the building fund.
Judge Wallace did not clearly under
stand the objection offered to the Kutro
site. If the school should go away from
San Francisco he desired to be informed
upon all the facts demanding its location
elsewhere. Should the choice be reduced
to Oakland and Temescal, regents should
be fully advised of the advantages these
presented.
J. West Martin spoke highly of the
Temescal site as the ideal location, under
the eye of the university. The tract of
land, containing seven and a half acres,
was conveniently near two electric-car
lines. AVater was abundant and electric
power within reach.
Ex-Mayor Davis was accorded the privi
lege of presenting the merits of the Oak
land propositions, and he submitted the
case in a style so finished and polished
that even Regents Wallace and Kellogg
must nave commended the composition.
He described four excellent sites, and
assured the board that the Oakland com
mittee had the money at command to pur
chase any one of them. In this order the
sites were enumerated :
Firstâ Land south of Badger Park near an
aria of the estuary.
Secondâ Three and a half acres at Twenty
first and Adeline streets.
Thirdâ One block, corner of Seventh and Ade
line streets.
Fourthâ Seven acres at Temescal.
Mr. Davis directed public thought to
the achievements of the university in the
cause of culture, in the domain of science
and in the field of the humanities, and the
equipment of the institution fot doing
more in the same line, but what he
wanted to make clear was the necessity of
utilitarian work and the advantage of
Oakland for utility. Incidentally Mr.
Davis mentioned the location of the Col
leges of Medicine and Law on the penin
sula and the danger of the university be
coming top-heavy on this side. He
thought the elements of strength should
be gathered about the old home site.
About this time Governor Budd entered
the room, lea%-ing a picture of the Stock
ton Free Library building and a large
bundle of newspaper literature devoted to
booming Stockton $Q a manufacturing
town.
Obviously, he had not heard that part of
the committee's report dropping out Ked
wood and Sun Jose on account of distance
from Berkeley, for he proceeded with de
cided vigor to press the claims of Stockton
for the school. He asserted that Stockton
was the manufacturing centerof California
and the place of all places where a school
of the character contemplated should be
established. Building material of the
most endimng type was readiiy accessible.
The beauty of the marble and its suscepti
bility to the highest polish were shown in
the Corinthian columns of the Stockton
Free Library building. Citizens of Stockton
would be a3 liberal with the, university as
they were with the Valley road. Stockton,
he remarked, had everything desired â even
had the Governor. Sacramento, too, should
be considered, as that city was now gaining
strength as a manufacturing point.
A motion made by Judge Wallace to
postpone consideration of the subject until
March 31 was carried unanimously.
Meanwhile, the newspapers throughout
the State are expected to make the fact
known that the regents will be pleased to
receive additional tenders of land for the
school.
THE BULLET
NOT EXTRACTED.
Little Justin Gunnison's
Physician Postpones the
Operation.
CATHODE RAY RESULTS.
Some New Experiments Being
Made by the University
Professors.
!
WORKING WITH THE SUNLIGHT
College Men Operating Without Elec
tricityâA Photograph Through an
Ebonite Pialeholder.
The professors at Berkeley wbo have
been experimenting with the cathode ray
photography are enthusiastic over their
success in the case of Justin Gunnison,
the San Francisco boy who shot himself
in the hand Jast week.
By means of the second plate taken on
Monday the location of the bullet was
established beyond possibility of doubt;
the location being exactly as indicated less
distinctly in the first photograph.
.Professor S. B. Christy, head of the de
partment of mines at the university, had
the second plate carefully developed yes
terday morning and excellent prints were
obtained from it. The bones of the hand
showed much more clearly tban in the
first photograph, and the show of the
bullet was quite distinct. This is regarded
as the best work yet accomplished on this
coast, if not in the United States, with the
new process, but the professors are confi
dent that still greater success will be ob
tained after desired tests of material and
apparatus are made.
The first plate taken yesterday was un
derexposed, having had only one hour and
a half, but the one used in the night and
which gave the best result was exposed
for two hours and a half. Dr. Greenleaf,
a surgeon in the United States army, saw
the photograph to-day. He stated that he
was certain that the black spot near the
third joint of the small linger was the seat
of the bullet. So certain was he of this
that he said he would feel safe in attempt
ing to cut out the bullet if the case was in
his charge.
No attempt to remove the bullet has yet
been made, however. The boy is under
the care of Dr. John Wagner, and the
latter concluded yesterday to treat the
hand for a day or two so that the inflam
mation and soreness would be lessened
before taking the bullet out. Dr. Wagner
had not seen the photograph yesterday,
but he was confident from his examination
of the Land that the bullet was at the
point indicated in the newspaper draw
ings. He says that the bullet can be re
moved without any difficulty, and he
thinks that there will be no permanent
injury to the hand.
The boy was out at play yesterday, but
with hia arm in a sling, and he is not
troubled beyond a soreness of the hand.
Yesterday he was a sort of a prince
among the boys of his neighborhood, and
to have attained to hia exalted position
some of the urchins would probably have
shot clear through both hands. The story
of the Berkeley experiments was told over
and over, and it is certain that being
eathodographed was a good deal of a circus
to young Justin.
Professor Frederick Slate and Mr.
Drew of the physics department at the
State University are experimenting with
the cathode ray photography at their
laboratory in the hope of doing successful
work by using the sunlight as an agency
instead of electricity.
Yesterday a photograph through an
ebonite plate-holder was taken with good
results.

A Blunder of the Track Officials
Deprived Little Cripple of a
Race.
RED EOOT PLAYED IN LUCK.
Bellicoso Set a New Coast Record for
Seven Furlongsâ Tim Murphy
Won in a Drive.
A blunder on the part of the track man
agement at the Bay District yesterday cost
the race-going public many hundreds of
dollars. The second event on the card was
mile and a sixteenth, selling affair, to be
run over the tortuous inside course, for
which Little Cripple was a pronounced first
choice, backed down from 8 to 5 to 6 to 5.
Opposed to him were a most ordinary lot,
the most likely of the starters being Unity,
Billy McCloskey and Red Root. After' a
deal of bumping and jostling at the first
turn Chevalier on the favorite gradually
worked his. mount to the front and on
a hard drive with the 15 to 1 outsider,
Buchess of Milpitas, won by a head. The
otficial timer hung out 1:48%. The course
being up and down hill precluded any
such lime being made, and upon investi
gation it was. discovered the distance
covered was fifty-five yards short. There
upon the judges ordered the race run over
at the conclusion of the last event on. the
end, allowing all bets to stand. The ring
laid 4 to 5 against Little Cripple winning
the run-off; and he failed to finish' among
the. first three. Prominent in the running
to the stretch he died away to nothing.
And as a lining finale to. a comedy of
errors, it is" dollars to crabapples the
judges made an error in. placing the first
horse. Duchess of Milpitas to ail appear
ance won by a good half length, but Red
Root, who was well backed to win the run- I
off on his good showing m the previous
run, was given the race. The whole affair
caused much adverse comment, and as the
mistake was wholly on the part of the track
officials a decision declaring all bets off
would have been a much fairer one for the
public.
Originally a very good racing card, it was
badly chopped to supply a deficiency
caused by the filth event being declared
off, and the sport was not above medioc
rity. Thousands of dollars were tied up in
tne hands of the pencilers by the decision
of the judges in the Little Cripple race,
end the betting during the balance of the
; afternoon was dull ana listless. Favorites
captured three races..
A six -furlong run ushered in the day's
racing, and was taken by the 2 to 1 favor
ite, Tim Murphy, in a drive from Boreas.
Ollie Johnson's chestnut horse Red Will
was backed down from 6to 5 to 4 to 5 and
won the third race, also a six-furlong spin,
hands down. 11. Martin, who rode Road
runner, grew careless nearing the wire
and was nipped out for the place by Gold
Bug/
But three started in the seven-furlong
handicap. Key del Bandidos was made a
7 to 10 favorite, but found the pace too hot
for him. Bellicoso led the entire way,
winning in a drive from Sam Leake, and
hung up a new coast record for the dis
tance â 1:26. - "â - --H v
The fifth race, run over the short six
furlong course, resulted in a very handy
win for the 3 to 5 favorite. Major Cook,
â¢with Babe Murphy finishing in the place.
Levena C was third.

-1:15V4. ""Disqualifled. *Pulled up.
Time,
chestnut horse was relegated to the stud
once, and should have been allowed to
stay there.
A â¢ ew days a KÂ° Tod Sloan had the mount
on Peter the Second in a mile dash, and
when the barrier was raised failed to get
away, and was left at the post. Yesterday
his brother, Cash, tried his hand at the
bat astride old Toano, and was also lefi.
In baseball it is three strikes and out.
Belle of Stonewall, a long priced outsider
in the Little Cripple gavotte, was alicrhtly
cut down the first time around the elliptic
and was excused from starting in the run
off. At Ingleside Belle Boyd received an
injury at the post and although the mare
was by no means a favorite, when excused
by the judges, all bets were declared off.
Away back in the days of '49 and '50 the
pioneers tell us that flour once sold up in
the mines for $100 a pound. Two pounds
of lead cost Jerry Chorn nearly as much
yesterday. After finishing third on The
Judge he stepped on the scales and found
himself two pounds short of weight. The
horse was disqualified and the judges lined
Jerry an even hundred.
The betting on tbe run-off of the Little
Cripple run wag peculiar to say the least.
A majority of the pencilers gradually
raised tbe odds until Ito 5 was offered
j against the gelding. The next shortest
! priced horses were Red Root and Duchess
of Milpitas, both 8 to 1 shots.
KAIER WAS DESPONDENT
Cut His Throat With a Pocket-
Knife in a Lodging-
House.
Was Apparently Not in Pecuniary Dif
ficultiesâRelatives in This
State.
Fred Kaier, a cattleman of Harlan,
lowa, who came to this City in August
last f'om Centralia, Wash., committed
suicide at the Yosernite House, 1045 Mar
ket street, on Monday night by cutting his
throat with a pocket-knife.
Kaier was despondent from ill health,
and while he was in a jolly mood a few
hours previous to his death he had evi
dently meditated on the deed, for clip
pings from various papers containing
poems on death were found among bis
effects.
When he failed to appear yesterday
morning at the office of the house the
clerk broke in the door and found Kaier
cold in death. The Coroner was at onco
notified and Deputy Maginnis went to the
hotel, where he found Kaier in bed with
the blankets pulled up about his neck.
When uncovered it was found that the
throat was cat from ear to ear, a knife â a
cheap affairâ being still held in his right
hand.
Pecuniary difficulties evidently had
nothing to do with his determination to
die. for the following letter was found in a
pocket of his coat:
First National Bank, )
Lake Charles, La.. Feb. 19, 1896.}
Fred Kaier Esq., I'osemite House, 10!Â£ Market
I street, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: We have yours
i of the 13th inst. The amount of funds to your
j credit is $59 4.4. â¢ Culvert has asked us several
; times for your address, hut he has not paid
; anything on his note. We are sending both
! Calvert and Menoher your address, also telling
j them that you want money.
A. L. Williams, cashier.
A letter from a nephew, who is employed
i on a ranch near Lindsey, Tulare County,
| and one from a niece at Harlan, lowa, told
I of family matters, but gave no hint of
i troubles that would lead Kaier to take his
I own life. He had been a roomer at the
! Yosemite House since December 26 Jast,
! and previous to that lived in a lodging
i house at Fifth and Mission streets.
The Law on Citizenahip,
Nicholas si. Lundin, a native o. Sweden, was
yesterday admitted to citizenship by Judge
Morrow under the law which provides that an
alien who has served five years in the navy or
marine service can become a citizen â without
having previously made a declaration of inten
tion.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1896.
A FRIEND OF PADEREWSKI
The Polish Pianist Falls on the
Neck of a Belgian
Violinist.
HOW MAESICK STARTED WEST.
The Great Artist Gives His Reasons
for Preferring the Violin
to the Voice.
It is said that geniuses are very solitary

individuals, because they may wander
about the world for weeks without meet
ing with another creature of the same
species.
Paderewski had not run across another
long-haired musician of his own variety
since he came West untii Monday; then
Martin P. Mar6ick stepped off the train
and Paderewski almost fell on his neck
and wept for joy. The two have been
friends for years. As soon as Marsick,
who was finishing an Eastern tour, heard
that Paderewski was in San Francisco he
stepped on board the next train San Fran
cisco bound, without a manager, an ac
companist or any of the other satellites
that usually follow in the wake of musical
stars.
It took him longer than he expected to
get out here, but be was cheered by the
Knowledge that he land wired his beloved
Paderewski of his advent, and he did not
believe that the Polish pianist would
depart, learine liira to face the far West
alone and friendless. Marsick was not
mistaken in his estimate of his friend, for
when Paderewski heard that the volatile
Belgian violinist was coming a four days'
journey out of his way to pay him a visit,
he not only ordered his private car to be
sidetracked for another week, but also
promised to appear at Marsick 's first con
cert in order to stand sponsor for him
with the San Francisco public.
Yesterday MarsicK was happier than he

has been since he obtained leave of ab
sence from his class at the Paris Conserva
tory to make the winter tour of America.
He did not lika the East; the coid troubled
him, his manager made him miserable by
rowing with him, he did not know the
language and was a stranger to the cus
toms of the people; but when he came
West he escaped from his manager, and as
he crossed the continent without even an
accompanist to worry him, he resolved to
be happy in hie own way, and Paderewski's
way, "without letting any crumpled rose
leaves in the way of American customs or
language worry him.
"It seeras to me that I have escaped
from a cavern into the lifrht and air," said
the fiery little man, running his long sup
ple fingersthrough a head of hair that even
Paderewski might envy. "I had made
my program mes for San Francisco on the
way here, good classical programmes, with
plenty of solid fare to them. But, Dieu!
When I saw the place, I said: 'This will
never do; we must have something ani
mato, something bright and gay, to suit
tne air and the sunshine.' And now I have
changed all the programmes. Yes! com-
pletely. The music is now all fire and
verve."
"Where did you tirst begin to study
music?" was asked.
"Why in liege," he answered quickiy,
as though surprised that any one should
not be aware of the well-known fact. "As
a boy I s>aiig in tiie cathedrSj, people used
to come from far and near to hear the little
piper, for I was very small â so high," and
the violinist, indicated an altitude about a
foot and a half from the floor. "After
ward I studied the violin. It is better than
singing, for the human voice is limited In
its resources and the violin is almost lim
itless. On occasion I sintr still, not in con
cert, oh, no, that would not pay, but in
private soirees in Paris."
When asked whether he considered the
Paris Conservatory the best school of sing
ing in the world Marsick replied, shrugging
his shoulders expressively," "It is the
least bad, but singing is becoming a lost
art. Is there anywhere in the world now
where they teach the vielie ecole (old
school)? No, there is no art such as there
used to be in the days of Bellini and
Rossini. In their operas artists used to
sintr, but now it is no longer singing; you
may call it what you will, crying or scream
ing, but not sinping.
"If the singer disappears from the worid,
it is the fault of Wagner's music. I' ad
mire what he wrote, it is beautiful, magni
ficent for iristr:i!ue,nts, but Wagner did not
know how to write for the voice. Ask a
Wagnerian diva to sing you a little air by
Mozart, and yon will see. She cannot in
terpret it. Her voice is not capable of
producing the sounds â her sentiment, ex
pression, phrasing, all are wrong for Mo
zart. Waguerianism iÂ« like a mighty tor
rent, it has submerged all the old masters,
and th it i 3 not right by saying give Wag
ner his due, but do not eclipse the old
Italian school entirely."
"When questioned respecting the future,
Marsick said that the mantle of prophecy
had not fallen on his shoulders, along with
the gift for music. "But it is my opinion
that singing, as an art will revive," he
said. "The torrent of Wagner will take its
natural proportions again, and composers
will write operas for the voice. In France
there is a new school, sprung from Wag
ner, but with originality of its own, and in
that school I see hope for the future. Vin
cent Indy is its beÂ«t composer, and Cesar
Frank was its originator. I pee nothing in
the composers 01 o.her nations which give 3
me hope for the future of opera."
Marsick says that the best violin pupils
who come to him are Russians, Poles and
Belgians. "Many violinists come from
Liege," he remarked modestly ; "there are
Monsieur Ysaye and Mnsin. Cjesar Thom
son and myself. Did I study with Wieni
awski? No; but I knew him well. When
I was a student he heard me play. He
was to perform his eight etudes night
at a soiree for the first time, ami he said,
'this young man shall play the second
violin in the etudes.' You know they are
written for two violins, and that night at
the soiree I played the second part" from
the manuscript, reading it at sight, for
Wieniawski had only just finished com
posing the etudes. They have become
famous now, and I am very proud to think
that at the end of the soiree he embraced
me for the performunce.
"But if I told all my experiences I could
talk from now till to-morrow morning, and
still not have told the half of what has
happened in my artistic career. It was in
Paris that I won the prize at the Conserva
tory the first time I tried, Pouff; they
gave it to me without hesitating, and my
headquarters have been in Paris ever since,
though I have^toured all over Europe."
Monsieur Marsick is the very opposite of
his dreamy idealistic friend, Paderewski.
He is so volatile that he might be wound
up with perpetual motion. When he plays
it is with his whole body. He talks like a
Neapolitan, with gestures almost as many
as the motions of big tongue, and he
prances about his room with almost in
fantile friskiness. Marsick is never far
from his beloved violin, for of course, like
all great players, he has a riddle which he
values more than anything else on earth,
except his musical reputation. So much
does he love this dear viol that he never
considers his picture complete unless it is
photographed with him. Even the sug
gestion tnat it makes him look like the
frontispiece of a manual on "How to Hold
the Violin has not proved efficacious in
persuading him to pose without it.
The Belgian violinist has already taken
unto himself an accompanist of local fame,
and he and Paderewski are reveling in
duos in which Wieniawski and kuben
stein used to shine. Their concert on Sun
day will be a remarkable event, as Pade
rewski has scarcely ever appeared in con
junction with another star since universal
lame became hip.
NEW INSITUTE TRUSTEES
Members' Committee Victorious
at the Institute Elec
tion.
Five Out of Seven of the Candidates
Recommended Are Harmoni
ously Chosen.
The annual election of trustees of the
Mechanics' Institute took pi^ce yesterday
at the library building.
Those elected were: Joseph M. Cum
in ing, E. P. Heald, P. J. Healy, Joseph
Leggett. Oscar Lewis, George Pressoc and
G. Howara Thompson.
The result of the election is an evident
expression of the satisfaction of the mem
bers of the present administration, for
five names of the ticket prepared by the
members' committee were elected. Mr.
Leggett said last evening:
"The defeat of Henry Root was undoubt
edly caused by his strenuous efforts for his
friend George it Presson. He worked
hard for Presson and this greatly weak
ened his own chances. His defeat is not
by any means an indication of dissatisfac
tion, as his services are held by ail the
members as exceedingly valuable."
PLEADED " NOT GUILTY."
Peculiar Status of the Higgins Case â Is
It a Criminal or Civil
Action ?
The case of the Pecpie against Hiegins
has assumed a peculiar aspect. It is a
civil action, but it has ail the characteristics
of a criminal action. A plea of "not
guilty" has been entered by Higgins, and
the prosecution has objected. They say
"not guilty" is no answer, and they asked
for judgment in deLault of other answer.
They have appealed from a denial of this
request for judgment.
Henry Gesford, under the guise of the
People, is suing to have M. 11. Higgins
ousted from his position as Insurance
Commissioner, the charge being that while
in offica he accepted a pass from the rail
road company. Judge Sanderson, before
whom the case is pending, has permitted
Higgins to enter a plea of "not guilty" to
this accusation, and his Honor deems this
sufficient answer to the complaint.
Garret McEnerney, counsel for Ges
ford, claims that this is no answer; that
Higgins must file a written answer to the
complaint against him, and so, after ob
taining a default from the County Clerk,
he has asked for a judgment in his favor
on the ground that no answer has been
nl?d within the statutory time.
Judge Sanderson refused to render judg
ment, and McEnerney is now preparing an
appeal from this denial. The appeal is in
the form of an application for a writ of
mandamus compelling Judge Sanderson
to render judgment as prayed fo r .
Gesford was appointed to the position of
Insurance Commissioner by Governor
Â±>udd. Higgius, Markham's appointee,
held the office and refused to surrender,
and so proceedings were brought against
him.
M'KINNOH'S ESTATE.
Frank P. Hooper Has Petitioned for the
Administration of It.
Frank P. Hooper, upon tho request of
the widow, has petitioned for letters of ad
ministration over the estate of John P.
McKinnon, pho died February 12 last.
In his petition Hooper sets forth that
the property which McKinnon left, so
Jar as he knows, is as follows:
Two parcels of improved real estate in
San Francisco, one on Post street with a
frontage of forty feet and the other a
sixty-one-foot lot on Geary street, to
gether valued at about $;JO,000; land in
Tulare County valued at $34,500; corpora
tion stocks valued at $19,000; Buildine
and Loan Association stocks valued at
$2!U0; accounts for money due in the
aggregate, $76,000. The entire estate, he
says, does not exceed in value $250,000.
His heirs are Sarah McKinnon, the
widow, aged 63, and six adult children,
James C. McKinnon, Ellen J. McKinnon,
Leonide M. McKinnon, John L. Mc-
Kinnon, Alfred J. McKinnon and Fannie
A. McKinnon.

YOUNG WAS FORTUNATE.
The Aspirant for Superintendent
of Schools in a New
Role.
AGENT OF THE VALLEY KOAD.
Contract Let For the Merced River
Bridge Which Will Be Over Half
a Mile Long.
Charles Sumner Young, who had aspira
tions for the office of Superintendent of
Schools in San Francisco, has virtually
abandoned his contest for that position.
In Young's case the wind has been tem
pered to the shorn lamb, for although dis
appointed in his ambition to direct the
city's schools, Young has received an ap
pointment equally remunerative.
Monday last he was appointed right-of
way agent of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railway. Before leaving
for the valley he told a friend that the
salary attached to the position was $250 a
month, and in addition to that all his ex
penses were to have been paid. The in
come from the chief position in the San
Francisco School Department is practically
an equivalent of that arrangement, only,
perhaps, it carries with it a prominence
and dignity which many men would like
to possess.
Youne went into a legal fight with Su
perintendent Babcock for the office of
School Superintendent. The case was
laid before Judge Troutt, who decided that
Young'e appointment was not legal, and
forthwith an appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court against the decision favor
able to Babcock. The decision is still
pending in the higher court. In the mean
time Young looked around him for another
field of work, and was fortunate enough to
find the position with the Valley road.
The right-of-way agent has a large share
of responsibility upon hia shoulders, as his
management of the various questions that
arise in the course of securing rights of
way means a great deal to the company.
Young has sper.t years at the real estate
business, and it is said by his friends that
he is peculiarly equipped to carry on the
work he has undertaken. He is already
pursuing the duties of his office down the
valley.
The directors of the road met yesterday
in this City and awarded a contract for the
building of the Merced River bridge to
Cotton Bros.
This bridge will be about half a mile in
length and forty, feet in height above the
water. Most of it will be trestle work, as
the river is bordered with bottom lands
that overflow in winter. There will be
three spans over the river proper, each V2~>
feet long. The spans will be composed of
wooden trusses bound with iron, and will
rest upon piers of piling. Chief Engineer
Storey estimates that the cost of construct
ion will bo between $40,000 and $50,000.
Subscriptions on the tifth assessment
have been coming into the company's
treasury quite satisfactorily, as already
$100,000 has been collected on this one
assessment alone.
Prince Lulgi Injured-
Prince Luigi of the Cristoforo Colombo met
with a slight accident while attending the
sports at Burlinganie on last Sunday. His
Royal Highness slipped on the floor and fell,
striking ids left shoulder in doing so. He paid
no attention to the affnir until the next-morn
ing, when, on examination by Dr. Giura of the
ship, it was found that a painful contusion was
the only result. This slight accident pre
vented his attendance at the banquet at
Jose. He expects 10 be all right in the course
of v few days.

NFW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 25.â Profit-taking by j
local operators and Kales for London account, ac- '
companied by lower cables, led to a rather weak |
opening at the Stock Exchange to-day. The sales
by the foreigners were estimated at fully 5,000
shares. The trading element was quick to dis
cover the change in sentiment and attempted to
brin; about a reaction in prices, and under pres-
Bure from this source the j market declined Sty per
cent 111 the case of Baltimore and Ohio, "3.4 per
cent in Leather preferred and 2% per cent in To
bacco. . Baltimore and Ohio's decline was Sue to
the Impression that the report of the expert will be
. anything but favorable.
Tobacco broke on vague rumors that the com
pany has lost one of the suits brought against it in
the matter of its legal integrity. Leather preferred
was sold by the bears on the idea that the passing
of the dividend must necessarily result in lower
prices for the siock. The directors met to-day, but
did nothing. 'i he belief Ib general, however, that
President Hoyt, in his report to-morrpw, will state
that it has been deemed advisable by thedirectorv
to pass the dividend at this time. This action, if
decided upon, will meet with the approval of
hankers here, who have been more than friendly
to the. company. Snpar and Chicago Gas were
notably strong, and rose to 1175^ and 70, respec
tively. â 
In the late trading the market was â¢ depressed

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111, Feb. 25.â Liverpool cables,
which were 3 farthings higher this morning, again
defined what should be the course of the wheat
market at the opening to-day. Under their influ
ence prices started with a distinct gain over yes
terday's close of 3 s(S' 1 2 c < an< l advanced another
! eighth within a few minutes. Here the improve
ment met with, opposition in the form of moder
ately free selling of long stuff. The posting of the]
world's shipments for the week which, all told,
aggregated 8,200,000 bushels, softened the tone a
little, slight recessions then taking place.
On the whole there was no big trading and price I
Changes were a trifle slow. Northwestern receipts I
are again picking up. To-day 568 cars arrived in!
that section, against 452 last Tuesday and 615 on 1
the corresponding day a year ago. Chicago re- ;
ceived 185 cars and inspected out 210,104 bushels. I
Later in the morning, on reports of damage to the j
Argentine crop, large sales of cash wheat for ex- |
port at New York and a second advance at Liver- I
pool there was fresh buying which communicated
renewed strength to prices, material gains taking i
place.
I". rail. street's reported a decrease in the world's ;
visible supply of 1,456.000 bushels. Thoman esti- j
mated the stock* in farmers' hands at 157.000,000
bushels. Closing continental cables were all
higher. Export clearances amounted to 279,414
bushels. "Shorts" were urgent buyers in the last
thirty minutes, the best quotations of the day
being established just before thÂ«Â» close. It was re
ported that 100 loads were sold at New York for
export. .May wheat opened from b6c to 66i, B e, !
Bold between 66 % c and 674& C, closing at 67-"VsÂ©
i 7 â¢â¢.<â¢. IS/4@iy 8 c higher than yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow. 45 cars.
â¢CORNâ Managed to maintain a fair proportion
of strength notwithstanding the very heavy re- 1
ceipts, 11:66 cars. Of course the firmness of wheat
had the credit of sustaining corn, which apparently !
it did. Withdrawals from store were 99.834 bash- !
els. Liverpool cables were, firm and !,4d higher. 'â 
Export clearances were large at 353.487 bushels.
Bradstreet's reported a decrease in available stocks
of 877.000 bushels. May cord opened at 30 4 c, !
sold between 30%@30%C and 31c. closing at 31c. 1
3'BC higher than yesterday. . Estimated receipts for
to-morrow, 270 earn.
OATSâ Were hardly as strong as the condition
of the other markets and the sympathy existing
therewith would warrant. There was a noticeable
fade of demand, while offerings were rather in
clined to be free. Receipts were 723 cars and 8800
â bushels were taken from store. Braclst reel's re
ported a decrease in stocks of 115,C0i) bushels.
May oats closed X B c higher than yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 225 cars.

PROVISIONSâ The hog market was weak and 1

fact presented little in the way of firmness. Tbe |

ANOTHER GOLD BRICK FRAUD.
Mrs. Harmon Gets the Larger Part

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call )
90S roadway, Feb. 25. '(
All classes of citizens have taken in hand
the. matter of preparing for the Slate Coun
cil of the Young Men's Institute that con
venes in Haywards in May.
A mass-meeting of citizens was held last
night and much enthusiasm was shown.
The people realize that it will be a splen
did opportunity to let the delegates Know
what a flourishing county seat Haywards
would make, and they intend to take ad
vantage of it to the fullest extent. It is
willingly conceded that it is the duty of
all to see that Haywards upholds her char
acter of hospitality.
J. E. Crooks, the banker, has assumed
the chairmanship of the finance commit
tee, and a worthier choice could not have
been made. In addition to the various
committees already published the follow
ing gentlemen were added to the executive
and entertainment committees at last
nisrht'f meeting: A. Dekamp, James
Chandler, 11. Heed, M. Cnrvin, John
<>eary, S. Simon, George Oakes, George
Lansan, W. J. Raraage, F. R. Lemos,
\\ llham Pimental, A. V. Morgan, Dr. A.
J. Powell, H. Turner, T. F. Gray.
At the meeting $850 was promised as a
starter, and as the total amount needed is
â boot $2000 no difficulty will be anticipated
in raising the remainder when the canvass
ing committee gets to work.
"We are meeting with support on all
hands, ' said F. B. Hasson, chairman of
the executive committee to-night. "We
have been most agreeably surprised at the
manner in which everybody is starting in
to make the State meeting a success. I
am sure we shall be able to eclipse the
entertainment provided by Vallejo last
year.'
A SECOND SCHEME.
The Worthless Gold-Brick Man's Ef
forts to "Work E. H. Gale.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 25.â M. G. Richie
of Napa arrived in town shortly before
noon to-day, and went to the City Hall,
here he was shown B. Thompson, alias
Charles Gordon, alias Addisorj Mills, the
gold-brck swindler. He identified the
any named man a3 the fellow who se
cured an advance of $5000 from him on a
gold brick in this city three years ago. He
at once swore to a complaint, alleging that
the defendant had been out of the State
since the offense was committed, for which
reason the statute of limitation does not
run.
" Edward H. Gale, residing at 1574 Eighth
avenue, reported to the police to-day that
almost the identical scheme was attempted
on him recently. On seeing the prisoner
he was confident that he was the man who .
had maue the advances to him. The old â 
etory of a rich mine in Arizona, an Indian I
rartner, old friend ready to divide, etc.,
was worked upon Mr. Richie when
he was taken to Piedmont three years ago
and given a (22,000 gold brick as security
for a loan of $5000, the brick being found
later to be absolutely worthless.
MAY YET BE RICH.
The Church Family Told of a Possible
Fortune.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 25.â Chief Deputy
District Attorney Lincoln S. Church, Su
pervisor W. H. Church and ex-County
Recorder Rod W. Church are deeply in
terested in the New York story regarding
the alleged $40,000,000 estate of Jasper
Cronkheit, who came from Holland and
. settled in that city in early days. The
mother of these officials was a Cronkheit
and they are wondering what share of the
great fortune will fall to them when it is
distributed.
According to the story told here Jasper
Cronkheit with two brothers settled in
New York in 1750, but later he returned to
his native land and amassed a fortune in
the gin business. In his old ape he be
came lonesome and wrote his brothers to
come home, but they refused. He then
made a will directing that his weaitri
should be held by the Rank of Holland
until April â¦>, 1596, when it was to be dis
tributed to the heirs of the Cronkheits
then living. The heirs from the United
States so fat heard of number thirty-one.
THE TIDAL. CANAL.
California Legislators Deplore the Effect
of Controversy. .
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 25.â President M.
J. Keller of the Board of Trade, who left
for an Eastern tour last night, received
letters from Senator George C. Perkins aad
Congressman Hil^orn in regard to the
memorials sent to Washington regarding
the Oakland harbor improvements. Both
say it would be unfortunate if any conten
tion should arise between Oakland and
Alameda, because at best it is going to be
hard to get an appropriation, and it might
be made impossible if the two cities should
quarrel over the method of spending the
money. The Senator and Congressman
agree in recommending harmonious work
for an appropriation, leaving the method
of expenditure to be decided entirely by
the United States engineer in charge.

proprietor of the Halfway House, a Ban
I<eandro road resort near Seminary ave
nue, is in the County Jail with two charges

of promise suit of Miss Carrie Lockyear,
the pretty Berkeley belle, and Major John
F. Hayes of National Guard fame, com
menced nearly a year ago, came up in
Judge Ogden's court to-day, but the at
torneys on both sides seemed to court de
lay, and by consent the case was contin
ued until May 19. The delay, it is said, is
due to efforts that are being made to settle
the trouble between the couple out of
court so as to avoid any further scandal.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1896.
WILL BE NO SURRENDER
Many Grand Army Men Now
Express Sympathy With
Lyon Post.
OPINIONS OF DIRECTOR BLINN.
Governor Budd Is Not Sure That He
Has the Power to Make
Changes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 25. \
The charges made against the Yountville
Home by Lyons Post of Oakland will be in
investigated by Governor Budd.
"I have been notified," said the Gover
nor, "of the charges made by Lyon Post of
Oakland, but i do not wish to say before
hand what I shall do in the matter, save to
Bay that I shall inquire into them. Ido
not know that I have full authority in the
matter. The honie is not a State institu
tion in the same sense that other institu
tions belong to the State."
The interest in tlie dispute bas now be
come general. Two letters were received
by members of Lyon Post to-day from in
mates of the home. Both of the writers
complain of the fact that old men are
required to work, and one says that there
is a difficulty in procuring clothing,
especially trousers and coats, and that
there is a lack of proper food. The writer
of the other letter speaks in the highest
terms of the management of General
Thompson, an>l says that the reason he
was discharged was that he insisted upon
strict business principles in the manage
ment of the tinme, and that there was no
chance for rebates in the purchase of
supplies. A complaint is also made against
the physician.
General Thompson received the follow
ing letter from a member of George H.
Thomas Post c! San Francisco to-day:
San- Fsancisco, February 24, 1896.
General D. W- C. Thompson â Deae Sib and
Comradk: I have read the interview of The
Call reporter with Blinn and also your reply.
Referring to what you say of Currier and Blinn,
I wish to inform you that there are not twenty
five members in George H. Thomas Post who
believe either Currier or Biinn would be in the
directorate of the Your.tviile Homo if they
could not tret something out of it. Neither
has ever 'devoted forty-eight hours to Grand
Army work unless they drew pay for their
services.
Blinn is a parasite. If the truth could be
brought out he has ridden the post like a bar
nacle almost from the night of his muster.
i You do not realize how distasteful he is to its
membership. For one I am disgusted at his
contemptible conduct, knowing or believing
that he is utterly out ol place in the director-
I ate of the Yountville Home, and that his allu
sions to yourself are prompted .solely by a
desire to avert attention from his record. lam
told by a director that your conduct of the
home "has been excellent, ami that he sees no
i Rood reason why your resignation should have
j been asked, but that he felt it had to come to
I enable a ring to supply a pliable character lor
the place.
Thomas Post understands these two Indi
viduals, but prefers to let things remain for the
present rather than force an issue. I think
you have the approval of a majority of G. A. K.
members. Yours truly. - â 
In the last annual report mention is
made of all the improvements carried out
during General Thompson's last year of of
fice. . Tne report concludes:
The home has now more members than ever
before, the men are all well clothed, quartered
and fed, ana are better behaved, more con
tented and healthier than at any previous
time.
More permanent improvements have been
made and larger crops produced this year by
for, for the money appropriated, thau any
previous year.
'"The matters that Director Blinn refers
to are all capable of proof," said General
Thompson to-day, "and I am glad the
Governor has taken the matter in hand.
"The report shows how 1 conducted the
home, and I want every one to know that
this is not a personal light of mine. It is
the expression of the opinions of more <;.
A. K. men than the directors are aware
of."
TROUBLE FOR SANTOS.
Another Little Girl Swears to a
Complaint AgaiDst
Him.
A Railway and Ferry Landmark Be
ing Removedâ Police Court
Notes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 25. -Another
charge has been entered against Andrew
de Santos, who is already confined in the
city jail under a charge of felonious as
sault, the complaining witness to which
is a girl by the name of Petravek, now
14 years of Rge, who claims that the
offense was committed two years ago.
The complainant in the second case is
Paulina Marjrick, a girl 11 years old,
who is a cousin of the Petraveks. The
case is an unusual one, the alleged offenses
having been committed bo long ago. The
true inwardness of the same is impossible
to make out. De Santos has transferred
his homestead on Bay street to his attor
ney.
Dividing the Busineg#.
ALAMEDA. Cal., Feb. 25.â Time out of
mind there have been hard feelings and
quarrels between the two Justices of the
Peace in Alaraeda. A short time ago
Justice Swasey sent a serious complaint to
the Municipal Board, to tbe effect that
there was a conspiracy among the police
to give all the business to Justice Morris.
The board directed that the magistrates
be treated exactly alike. The 1 board fur
ther considered the matter Monday night,
having Marshal Rogers before them, and
the result of it will be the posting of a
notice by which the police will be ordered
to divide legal business equally between
the two courts.
Landmark Passing.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 25. âAnother
landmark iR to disappear. The old land
ing place of the narrow-gauge ferry line at
Alameda Point is being torn down. When
the line was first opened in 1878 and for
five or six years afterward all the traffic
was transferred from ferry-boat to car at
this landing, which necessitated a much
longer water trip up the narrow creek, and
consequently increased the time of the
trip between Alameda and San Francisco.
Finally, the railway tracks were extended
out to the mouth of the creek, makine the
ferry run about the same as on the broad
gauge. The big buildings and sheds have
remained ever since without being put to
any use. Now they will be removed. The
freight transfer is still- maintained at this
point, but that service does not necessitate
the big buildings that were erected for the
accommodation of passengers.
A Summons Brings Response.-
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 25. â Cbarles
Keller, who is trying to get a divorce from
his wife, having obtained lesnl service by

The Dublicity given the case attracted her
attention, and she has retained^ an attor
ney to contest the case. Tnis attorney
has compiaiaed, on behalf of bis client, of
the publicity that the case has attained.
Keller hnd not before for three years heard
of Mrs. Keller's whereabouts.

A NKW RAILROAD.
The Oakland and Livermore Company
FilfH Jt9 Articles.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 25.â The Oak
land and Livermore Valley road tiled arti

counties of Alameda and San Joaquin, with
immediate brunches to such towns or vil
lages adjacent to said route as may be

WANT TWO-YEAR TERMS
It Is Declared That the Supreme
Court Has Again Decided
the Point.
The Only Hope of Restoring Confi
dence Is by an Election in
November.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 25. f
The opinion published in The Call a
few days ago, which it was claimed defin
itely declared against four-year terms for
county officers and the opinion rendered
to-day regarding the primary election law,
are accepted by lawyers as conclusive that
the Supreme Court will declare in favor of
two-year terms when the matter is placed
before them. i 'â¢. :
The language of the opinion is exactly
the same in both cases. It declares that
j legislation in favor of any particular class
!of counties is "special and local" and
therefore unconstitutional. The court also
says that although only one be affected by
an act it is still invalid. This seems to be
particularly applicable to the four-year
clause as it affects every county but Fresno.
County ClerK Jordan says he feels secure
for a four-year' term. There has been no
case yet before the Supreme Court where
the issues are definite on the question. In
conversation to-day Mr. Jordan said:
"There is only one case where the matter
is involved and that is in a Fresno case
which has not yet reached the highest
court. When this can get to the Supreme
Court the issue will be raised. So far as I
am personally concerned I feel that the
people of this county elected me to serve
four years and 1 went into office, with that
understanding." .
The idea that the four-year term has
been knocked out is received with general
favor in this county. There have been so
many scandals connected with some of the
offices that the only way to create a feeling
of security is to test the question of the
incumbents' fitness by letting them go
again before the voters.
PALO IS DEAD.'
lie Was the Mascot of Hay-wards'
Footballers.
HAYWARDS, Cai.., Feb. 25.â The dog
poisoner has appeared in Ha} wards and
all the town would like to meet him. The
last evidence of his work was the poison
ing of Palo. Palo was the mascot of the
11 ay wards football teum and is credited
with being one of the luckiest ones ever
carried on a gridiron. In all the matches
with Centerville, Decoto and Niles Palo
has been the presiding genius and his
presence has inspired the kickers with suf
ticient courage to enable them to win with
big margins.
Yesterday morning Palo was found dead
and there was mourning in the land. He
was a general favorite with all who knew
j him and he was acquainted with every
body. An an to was held and Palo's
stomach contained a mixture of drugs any
one of which would have quenched the
vital spark.
When Palo again mascots the Hay
wards football team he will be stuffed with
stuflw and wire and the betting is even as
to whether a living or a dead mascot cx
i ercises most influence for goals and points.
THREE WEEKS MARRIED.
M. E. Oliver Separated From His
Wife by His Mother
iii-Law.
She Drove Him Out of the House and
Kept Possession of His Clothes
and Tools.
M. E. Oliver, a erainer, is experiencing
the baneful effects of a mother-in-law'? in
terference in his domestic affairs. He is
now without his young wife and his
clothes and tools, and he has asked the
help of the police to secure the latter.
He has been living in the house of Mrs.
Brady, 143 Minna street, and won the af
fections of her daughter Rosie. They
agreed to get married secretly, and ac
cordingly on February 3 Oliver procured a
marriage license and they were made man
and wife by Rev. J. Fuendling. Oliver is
35 years of ' age, and he gave Roiie's a^e
as 19.
Mrs. Bradv remained in ignorance of the
marriage till a few days ago. Then she
opened out upon Oliver for daring to marry
Rosie, who is only 17 years of age, and he
a divorced man. She insisted that he take
immediate steps to annul the marriage and
pay the necessary expenses. Oliver de
murred to the whole proposition, but
finally consented to the annulment of the
marriage, declining, however, to bear the
cost,
Mrs. Brady drove him out of the house
without giving him time to remove his
clothes and tools. He went back on Mon
day and attempted to recover them, but
without success. Yesterday morning he
procured a search warrant in Judge Jo
achirnsen's court and was able to gain pos
session of his effects. But he ia still with
out his youthful bride.
LEACH REFUSES TO TALK
Governor Budd Invites the Jour
nalistic Director to
Criticize.
THE INVITATION ACCEPTED.
The Old Official Will Not Say Whether
or Not He Will Resign His
Position.
Oakland Office San Fbasghod Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 2.3. \
The interest in the Blind Home director
ate now centers about Frank A. Leach of
this city, the only remaining director not
removed by Governor Budd. It was re
ported last night that Mr. Leach had de
cided to resign. When asked abont it to
night, Director Leach said he could not
affirm or deny the statement.
"I do not think it proper for me to say
anything about the affairs of the home,"
he said, "and I decline absolutely to say
anything about Colonel Irish, Governor
Budd or any one else."
Governor Budd was asked this afternoon
as to whether or not he would dispense
with the services of Mr. Leacn. He re
plied:
"Mr. Leach tendered his resignation
either during the latter portion of Mr.
Markham's term or the earlier portion of
mine, and I asked him to withdraw it.
He is a Republican, 'but I will be pleased
to have him on the board if he desires to
remain. He is the editor of a Republican
newspaper and if there be anything
crooked in the management of the insti
tution he will have the opportunity of ob
serving and publishing; it to the world. 1
shall be pleased to have his criticism of
the institution as it goes along. There is
nothing to conceal."
Director Leach evidently "pleases" to
criticize, and although he refused to ex
press a verbal opinion his newspaper to
night contained the following editorial :
The worst thing about the recent change in
the superintendency of the Industrial Home
"for the Adult Wind is the humbug with which
it is sought to cover it up. Superintendent Han
dera was put out and Superintendent Hays put
in because it was a supposed necessity to find
a place for Hays, and the manly thing would
have been to say so publicly. In private con
versations which preceded the recent overturn
there seems to have been no concealment of
the real;purpose. While talking confidentially
none of the powers that bethought It neces
sary to cr.ll a spude anything but a spade, and
it would have been to their credit if they had
displayed the same candor in their public com
munications. There is a worse offense in pub
lic officials than sjoils politics, and its name is
humbug. To go before the people with a pre
tense that a certain movement is for reform,
when it is intended primarily for somebody's
private advantage, is a falsehood. To assign
one reason in private and another in public
lor a given act is hypocrisy and cowardice,
compared with which the frauk avowal of
spoils principles by a political boss is almost
respectable.
And yet, what Colonel Irish calls the "pot
housing" of the Home for the Adult Blind is
deplorable enough in itself. It is the culmi
nation ot efforts which have been in progress
through several administrations of the btate
Government, but have never succeeded until
now. The home has been conducted as a busi
ness establishment would be, ignoring polities;
officials have neither been put out or put in
because they belonged to one party or the
Other; Republicans have voted to retain Demo
cr.'itic dflice-holdcrs, and vice versa. All the
while the politicians huve resented this imin
ner of running the home, and from time to
time they have made desperate grabs to get
control. They were rebuffed repeatedly, but at
last they have succeeded, and the pity of it is
that they should have succeeded through a
board of directors whose new members are all
reputable gentlemen. The policy ot the insti
tution hns been reversed, and in the long run
the change cannot fail to be for the. worse.
Superintendent Jack Hays was seen to
night. He would only say he had not
seen Colonel Irish since the latter returned
from Washington, except at one board
meetinir, and at that time. the colonel and
the superintendent did not exchange a
single word.
DR. LE CONTE'S BIRTHDAY
The Patriarch of Geology at the
University Is Seventy-
Three.
He Brings Out a New Edition of His
"Elements" â Liquor Cases.
Town Trustees.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 25.â Dr. Joseph
le Conte, the venerable patriarch of the
geological science at the University of Cal-
Joseph Le Conte.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
ifornia, will celebrate his seventy-third
birthday to-morrow. To commemorate
the day of his birth he will give his usual
lecture to the geology Bection at 11:15 a. m.
This lecture will be another link added
to the unbroken chain of addresses he has
given to his classes for the past seven
years, it being a fact that he has not
missed a single period for daily recita
tions since March, 1889. In August it will
be twenty-seven years since he took up
his work for the State University, having
been one of its first professors. He took
the chair of the geological departmental
the time of its organization aud has held
it ever since. It was forty-four years last
month since he began teaching the sci
ence.
His first experience as a professor was at
the Oglethorpe University in Georgia,
where be remained for only a short time.
After leavinc there he went to the Uni
versity of Georgia, where he remained
until called to take up the work at the
University of California. Dr. Le Conte is
as hale and hearty to-day -as he was ten
years ago, and his step as he walks across
the campus is as quick and steady as ever.
When called upon this afternoon he was
found deeply engaged in preparing his
birthday lecture on "The Structure of
Mountains." Upon being asiced. what
works he has been lately engaged in pro
ducing, he said:
"It was ju?t last week that I sent to the
publishers the material for the new edi
tion of my 'Elements of Geology.' Tha
geological science is rapidly progressing,
and if I do not bring out a new edition of
my work I will fall behind the times.
Have been at work on it for about a year,
and now that it is off to the publishers I
feel much of a relief. It will be out during
the summer, or perhaps late in the spring.
"My work on ' Light' or 'The Principles
of Vision' will be the next to appear. Am
now awaiting orders from the publishers
to go ahead with it. About half of this
work 13 wholly original. There are some
other things which 1 would likfl to bring
out, but do not seem to have the time to
do so. 1 have on hand at the present time
enough miscellaneous scientific and phil
osophical essays and papers to make four
or five large vulumes. I may write out
my lectures on comparative geologyâ l
feel that 1 ought to do so.
"A nother thing I hope to do soon, also,
and that is to publish another work on
"Evolution"â a continuation of my last."
w hen asked whether his ideas
with regard to the principles of evo
lution had changed since writing his last
work on it, Dr. Le Come said:
"No. not by a considerable difference.
If any thin-, my ideas on the subject have
been greatly strengthened by later study
and investigation. I shall not seriously
modify anything I have suid in the former
work."
Regarding the statements made con
cerning his intentions of giving up part of
his wort at the university, Dr. Le Come
said :
"I have no intention whatever of giving
up my lecture work in geology, but it may
be that next year I will lessen my under
graduate instruction and give more atten
tion to post-graduate students."
Town Trustees.
BERKELEY, Cat... Feb. 25.â A petition
was presented to the Town Trustees last
night asking that another special election
be called to secure bonds for $^0,000 for
school purposes. The petition bore the
signatures "of about .300 Berkeleyans. It
was tiled without action.
The Trustees passed to print the ordi
nance fixine water rates and decided to
hold an aojourned meeting on Friday
evening to finally pass that ordinance.
A. report was made by Trustee Hoff of
the Electric-light Committee that the
Electric-lighting Company is not comply
ing with its agreement to place all lights
in brackets in the middle uf the streets.
Town Clerk Hanscom was instructed to
notify the company to carry out its con
tract.
Contractor John Corbett was granted a
release from his obligation to enter into
a contract to lay a sidewalk on Jones
street. Mr. Corbett stated that H. W.
Carpentier, the principal property-owner
on the line of the proposed improvements,
had decided to refuse to pay any assess
ments, and would cause a long and expen
sive legal contest, which Corbett desired
to avoid. All proceedings in the matter
were rescinded.
The LJqnor Cases.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 2-s.â Town At
torney Hayne is making efforts to brinp
the case of Fred Fonzo, who is charged
with storing liquor without a license, he
fore Judge Greene of Oakland. Fonzo was
convicted in Berkeley and has appealed.
The caee is similar to that of Strieker, in
deciding which Judge Frick of Oakland
declared the ordinance under which the
charges were brought to be invalid. Sev
eral points urged by Strieker and Fonzo's
attorney, M. C. Chapman, were not touched
by Judge Frick, whose decision was not a
written one, among ttiem being the ques
tion as to the validity of the Berkeley Jus
tice courts.
If Judge Greene refuses to hear the case
of Fonzo the Berkeley Town Trustees will
accept the defeat and pass a new liquor
ordinance.
A Driver Injured.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 25.â Elmer E.

party, not only in obtaining speedy control of
the municipal government of this City, but
the apparent lack of unity among Populists in
local affairs will lose mnny votes for our Na
tional ticket, aad bo it further
Resolved, That we desire to place ourselves
on record as opposing any non-partisan scheme
as one calculated to deceive the credulous
voter. We make this assertion upon the hy
pothesis that no man ever did or can rise one
iota above his party in the aggregate, and for
such person or penooa to withdraw them
selves fron their several parties upon the as
sumption mat they are more honest,
patriotic or better qualified to guarantee to
the citizen a clean, honest nnd efficient admin
istration of the municipal affans by calling
themselves "Nou-Partisun party," which in
itself is an enigma and a travesty upon party
discipline, and is, to say tne least, tbsuril
and egotistic, and places the responsibiii'.v
entirely upoa the shoulders of Individuals
who have no party ties and no party to dts
rupt by their acts it they be bad, whicn, in our
. opinion, is in contradiction to ail the perma
nent political evolution of the pfist age*. We
believe that all permanent political progress
in municipal self-government, as well aa State
and National government, must be the result
of certain lurrdamental principles, which
take root primordial, commencing with
the common people in each precinct
and extending through all the
phases of society and political subdi
vision until it has sanctified ..the er
mine of the bench and seized upon 'the dig
nltied positions (j^ Congress and the chief ex
ecutive of the Nation. And this can only be
done by a National party crystallized by the
unification of its membership witn principles
so clear that even the wayfaring man can see
through them, and yet so solid that the finan
cial wolves of the world can hurl themselves
to death against the bland and placid dogmas
without leaving a single mar or blemish upon
the crystal trutn of its face.
The meeting then adjourned for one
week.

CONTRACTS IN JEOPARDY
The Building of the New Union
Depot Ferry at a
Standstill.
BATEMAN BROS.' TEST CASE.
State Controller Refuses to Allow a
Demand Granted by Harbor
Commissioners.
John C. Baternan and Michael Bateman,
through their attorney?, Sullivan & Sulli
van, have petitioned the Supreme Court
for a writ cf mandate compelling E. J.
Coglan, Staie Controller, to allow their
demand for $.53 due for work upon the new
union ferry depot.
The Supreme Court has taken original
jurisdiction in the case and has granted an
alternative writ, returnable March 2.
The amount in itself, although insig
nificant, bears directly on the entire
!ff>oo,ooo of contract value invested in the
construction of the new building, and it
will serve as a test of the validity of all
contracts awarded by the Board of Harbor
Commissioners.
I'ateman Bros, secured the' contract for
plastering and glazing for $48,400. They
performed service to the value if $44. and
demanding payment for this amount they
were allowed by the Commissioners ac
cording to the special statute governing
the commission in such cases, $33, or 75
per cent of the entire amount.
The State Controller, however, refused
to allow their claim, on the ground that
the statute heretofoYu governing the com
mission had been repealed by amend
ments made subsequent to the enactment
of the law. The Kisdon Iron Works has a
contract of ?18S,000 for the erection of steel
trusses and supports in, the structure, but
owing to the uncertainty of the validity of
tiie contract, it has refused to begin work
or sign for work with Eastern firrus.
J. F. Sullivan of the firm of Sullivan &
Sullivan said last evening:
It is claimed by the Attorney-General that
the matter of inviting propo3uls and awarding
contracts has bfcn changed by virtue of
amendments to the general law governing tho
manner of the erection of public buildings.
The general law was passed in lSTtt, and the
amendments to it were passed, one in 1891
and the other in ]895.
Between the plan of inviting proposals
under the special law of the Harbor Commis
sioners and the plan laid down in the general
public buildings law there are essential differ
ences.
In the awarding of public contracts it \g an
established principle that the mode of pro
cedure pointed out by tiio statute governing
in such matters must be followed. The Harbor
Commissioners have followed the special
Btatntes heretofore regarded as governing
them. It is claimed that their course is cou
trary to the general j a w, for the reason as
serted by the Attorney-Cieneral â they have
acted under the wrong statute.
If the position of the Attorney-General be
correct the contract awarded to the Bateraau
Bros, and the other contracts involved in the
construction' of the $t>OO,<X)O improvement
are invalid, and the small demand of the Bate
man Bros, on account of their $48,400 con
tract, if invalid, will in the determination of
that question involve the validity of all the
contracts.
The case is of paramount Importance, and
the Supreme Court has undertaken the hear
ing of the case by the solicitation of Governor
Budd, the Attorney-Geueral, the Harbor Com
missioners and our clients.
MENDEL ESBERG'S ESTATE
Several Charitable Bequests Men
tioned in the Will of
Deceased.
The Remainder of His Property Left
to His Widow and His
Children.
The will of Mendel Esberg, who until
his death was a partner in the linn of Es
berg, Bachman & Co., was filed for probate
yesterday. He left an estate which, in the
petition for probate, is indefinitely esti
mated at over $10,000, but it is certain that
it will reach over half a million.
The house and grounds at Buchanan
street and Pacific avenue were left to the
testator's wife, together with her half of
the community property. To his children,
Alfred 1., Henry, Milton H., Justin and
Bdith, he leaves the remaining half of hia
estate, it to be distributed to them when
the youngest shall have reached the age of
25. In the meantime they n:ay each draw
$i? 5,000 if it be deemed necessary.
To the Pacific Hebrew Orphan Asylum
and Home Society is left $500; to the
Protestant Orphan Asylum $500; to the
Archbishop, to be paid to tlie Catholic
Orphan Asylum as he may direct, $500;
to the Eureka Benevolent Society $500;
to the First Hebrew Benevolent Society
$.500; and to tne Isjraelitischer Frauen
Verein $250.
The testator directs that his widow,
Matilda Esberg, be appointed executor
with full power and without bonds, and if
she needs assistance he suggests that the
sons and his friend Albert W. Scholia
assist her. He directs further that, if the
surviving partner consents, his interest in
the firm of Esberg, Bachman <fc Co. remain
there, so that the business of the firm may
be conducted without interruption.
The will is dated April 15. Ih9o, and ia
witnessed by Mayer Weiland and Joseph
Naphtaly.
Many eyes supposed to be black are only
a deep orange brown.

MURDERED BY HER
FRENZIED HUSBAND
Nick Claussen Shot Down
His Wife in Cold
Blood.
NO MOTIVE IS EVIDENT.
The Killing Occurred in Mrs.
Foley's Home on Everett
Street.
SURRENDER OF THE ASSASSIN.
A Pitiful but Hopeless Attempt Made
by His Eldest Son to Prevent
the Crime.
Nick Clausscn. branded with the mur
der of His wife, is behind the bars of the
City Prison swl the woman who was the
victim oi hiÂ« ungovernable temper lies at
the Morgue with two ragged |buttet holes
in her left breast and one in her left arm.
The tragedy took place last evening at .'>
o'clock in the home of Mrs. Foley at 12
Kverett street. Mrs Cluussen called on
Mrs. Foley early in the afternoon for the
purpose of engaging rooms, as she had
proposed moving irom her late residence
at 120 Pierce street.
About an hour after she had arrived at
the hooae her husband, in a state of in
toxication, knocked at the door and asked
Mrs. Foley if his wife was in. Being in
formed Uiat she was, he entered and went
to a bedroom in the rear part of the house,
in which his wife was sitting.
They immediately began to quarrel, and
Mrs. Foley, anticipating trouble, inter
vened in the woman's behalf and told
Claussen that lie had better leave tne house
until he had sobered up.
He took her advice and left, but in a few

to any one walked to the room where he
had left his wife. He drew his revolver
from his porket and tired three shots at
her in rapid succession from a distance of
about three feet, the bullets taking effect
as before stated.
At the time of the shooting, with the
exception of Claussen's 11-year-old, son,
no one was in the room who co*.ild
throw any light as to the cause of the
shooting.
When the boy saw his father draw the
shining revolver, young as he is, he knew
that his father was about to commit a fear
ful crime and he endeavored to wrest the
pistol from me murderer. He grasped it
with both hands and held on to it with
childish desperation, refusing to release
his hold until after two shots had been
tired. He was then shaken off in time to
see his frenzied father shoot a third bullet
into the prostrate and bleeding form oj
the dying woman.
In a moment the wildest excitement en
sued. Crowds began to gather around the
house where the crime had taken place. A
number of policemen who had been at
tracted by the sounds of the shots forced
their way into the building and captured
the assassin, who was standing over the
body of his wife, the smoking revolver
-till in his hand.
In the meantime Mrs. Merritt, an ac
quaintance of Mrs. r/oley, had .made her
way up the back stairs and into the room
where the shotting had occurred. She
loosened the clothiiig about the neck and
breast of the wounded woman and en
deavored to bring her back to conscious
ness by applying restoratives. Her work
was in vain, for in a few moments the
patrol wagon, which had been telephoned
for, arrived and the still unconscious
woman was started for the Receiving Hos
piial. This proved to be an unnecessary
journey, as the woman died on the way.
Her body was laid on a cot in the hos
pital, and the Coroner notified. The body
was removed to the Morgue.
Claussen, still showing the effects of the
liciuor he had been drinking, but other
wise cool and collected, as if he
hardly realized the enormity of his. crime,
was securely ironed and taken to the City
Prison.
He did not appear in the least conscience
stricken at committiag such a "old
bloodeil murder, but rather acted as if he
had done someth ing that he had no rea
son to be ashamed of.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1896.
In answer to a question as to what
prompted him to kill his wife he said:
"Well, she called me a bad name, and I
shot her." He denied that the deed was
prompted by jealousy, and repeated that
it was simply because she called ;him a
"black dog."
"She was my second wife," said Claus
sen, "and I married her five years ago,
about it year and a half after the death of
my first wife. She was a chambermaid in
tiie Russ House, where I was working at
my trade as a baker, and we became at
tached to each other and got married. I
was then 33 years of age, and she was a
year older.
' My three children, two boys and a girl,
are by my first wife, and better children
never lived. She was always kind to them,
as kind as if they had been her own. I
will say that much for her.
"For the past six months we had not
lived happily together and six days ago
she left me. This afternoon I called at 12
Everett street to engage a room and met
her there by accident. We had some
words and she called me names and I shot
her.
"I have been working at Engelberg's
bakery on Kearny street recently, but have
worked in bakeries in different parts of the
city."
Claussen's sister, Mrs. Mary Christen
sen, wife of a master mariner, who
iives on Dolores street, called at the
City Prison last night to see him. They
conversed together for a few minutes, and
she seemed deeply affected. She has had
Claussen's daughter Lena living with her
since Friday, and she will take the two
boys home with her this morning. They
were asleep in Matron Gillmore's room
when she called, and she thought it better
not to disturb them. The three children
are: Willie, 11 years ot age; Louis 9, and
Leva, 7.
It was learned that Claussen was in
sanely jealous of his wife, and when he
was under the influence of liquor, which
was very frequent, his jealousy became in
flamed and he abused his wife. Three or
four months ago she had him arrested for
threats against life, but the charge was
dismissed as he promised to behave him
self.
On Friday he was drunk and he drove
her from the house. She went to live with
a friend on Powell street, the two boys re
mained with their father and the little girl
went to the house of her aunt.
Yesterday afternoon Willie went to
Powell street to see his stepmother, and
not finding her there he went to 12 Ever
ett street. He was there talking with her
when Claussen and the boy Louis called.
Claussen went out, and when he returned
he told the two boys to go down to the
kitchen and 'fix themselves up. as he was
to take them out with him. When they
left the room to ro to the kitchen Mrs.
Claussen was dressing her hair in front of
the mirror, and in a minute or two later
the boys heard the shots. Such is the
story told by Willie.
The murdered woman wÂ»s, prior to her
marriage, a Miss P^lizabeth Shaw. She
was born in Ireland thirty-nine years ago,
of English parents. If the statements of
her friends are true, she ;had always been
a hard-working woman, and for many
months had been forced to suffer much
cruelty at the hands of her husband, par
ticularly when he was intoxicated. There
was less motive evident and the crime was
committed in a more cold-blooded and
heartless manner than any of the many
murders that have lately shocked this
City.
A CASE OF SMALLPOX.
William Kelly, a Student, Develops the
Disease After Leaving This City
and Going to Napa.
The Board of Health is much exercised
over the faci that a case of smallpox has
developed in this City. Dr. Bazet ad
dressed a communication to the board
yesterday in .which he stated that on
February 20 "William Kelly, a student,
had called at his office and complained
that he was suffering from malaria. He
examined the patient and found him
suffering from fever, but saw nothing
serious in the case and advised a change
of air. Subsequently he heard from Dr.
Taylor of Napa, who notified him that
Kelly, while stopping in that town, had
developed a genuine case of smallpox.
Inquiry developed the fact that he had
stopped one night with a family at 307
Lott street after having been examined by
Dr. Bazet and had tben gone to Napa.
The local physician at once went to the
Lott-street residence and vaccinated the
inmates and notified the Board of Health.
An- effort will be made to ascertain where
Kelly contracted the disease.

GOVERNOR BUDD
ON JOHN P. IRISH
Why the Colonel's Official
Head Went to the
Basket.
A SIGNIFICANT LETTER
Received by the Executive the
Day the Removal Was
Made.
THE LEGISLATIVE INQUIRY,
Colonel N. T. James Expresses His
Opinion of Colonel John P.
Irish.
Governor Budd was seen at the residence
of Harbor Commissioner Colnon on Haight
street last evening. When asked if he had
anything to say in reply to John P. Irish's
statements published in The Call yester
day, he said:
"It is impossible to enter into a public
discussion concerning the removal of Mr.
Irish. If the public, however, deems the
question of sufficient importance for inves
tigation, I can refer to the report of the
joint committee on State Hospitals and
Asylums and Public Health and Quaran
tine of the last Legislature. This report
may be found on page 297 of the journal of
the Assembly, thirty-first session."
"It is significant, " continued Governor
Budd, "that a Republican committee re
commended the removal by a Democratic
Governor of a Republican board of trus
tees.
"On the day that Irish was removed I
received this letter:
Tn James H. Budd, Governor Slate, of California
âSir: We, the undersigned, memDers ot the
Assembly committees, to wit, the Committee
on Hospitals and Asylums and also the Com
mittee on I'ublic Health and Quarantine, that
jointly investigated the Industrial Home of
Mechanical Trades for Adult Blind during the
last Legislature, found the inmates in such a
state of intimidation that to induce them to
speak freely of the affairs of the institution it
became necessary to promise them the protec
tion of the State." This promise was to get at
the facts, thus serving the best interests of the
Btate, and it should be kept inviolate.
The Legislature not now being in session,
yon, sir, are the only person in position to re
deem this pledge; therefore we most respect
fully call your attention to the case of E. B.
Taylor, one of the inmates who was
induced by this promise to give use
ful and accurate information to the
committees, and in a few days thereafter,
without a hearing and without being informed
of the cause of nis expulsion, was discharged
from the home. Now, as he was following his
usual duties at the Dome, and that, too, without
let or hindrance, and also that lie was ex
pelled immediately after our visit to the home
(no charges of misconduct being against him
up to that date) should be taken as prima facie
evidence that he was expelled for giving this
information to the committees, and is entitled
to the protection of the State.
Now, precedents will bear us out in saying
that we believe it is your duty as chief execu
tive of the State topreserve the integrity of
Us representatives by reinstating this blind
man, and no pretext or technicality on the
part of the directory should De allowed to
stand in the way.
He recently made application for reinstate
ment, which was indorsed and recommended
by Superintendent Hays, but his application
was rejected by the board and no reason given
therefQr.
We earnestly urge-your immediÃte action, as
he hos been unjustly deprived of the benefits
of the home for a year or more, and now as he
calls upon the representatives of the State to
redeem this promise It is the duty of the State
to do so promptly.
Some of the members of these committees are
living in the immediate vicinity of the home
and have personal knowledge of the facts
herein referred to.
We suggest that he be permitted the benefits
of the home until such time as he is formally
admitted.
feeling confident that you will take promDt
and vigorous action in this matter, I am, air,
your most obedient servant. #
"The letter is signed by J. H. Glass, J. B.
McDonald, M. Lewis, John O'Day, William
T. Boothby, Robert Gay, Louis P. Zoccbi,
W. G. Hudson and O. H. Huber."
The Governor directed attention to the
fact that Sanders was removed in Decem
ber, "yet Irish served two months there
after, and now asserts that he was dis
charged because he would not vote to dis
place Sanders.
"If further light is needed on the re 7
moval of Irish and the management of
the Institute for the Blind, I refer you to
the Board of Trustees.
"The four directors appointed are: T. C.
Coogan, J. R. Glaacock, N. T. James and
David S. Hirshberc â men of high char
acter."
The Governor positively declined to ex
press his opinion of Irish personally, but
was. willing to concede to the decapitated
the right of squealing and making a great
noise. Said he:
If the public -want to know anything
more about the facts let this extract from
the report of the Assembly Committee of
the last Legislature be.studied :
January 2r) we visited the Industrial Home
of Mechanical Trades for the Adult Blind at
Oakland and we regret the fact that we cannot
make the same commendatory report of this
institution that wo have of others visited. In
this case as in the others we took the manage
ment by surprise and our investigation-was as
thorough as we could make it within the lim
ited time allotted.
The bath and toilet rooms were mostly in
fair condition, but one bathtub was so un
clean h- to be a disgusting sight, and the men's
public toilet was in a similar condition to that
of a public toilet at a railroad station. The
smoking-room is a disgrace to the State. It
has a cement floor, which could not be seen for
the filth, and while the claim is made by the
management that this room is "hosed' 1 out
at least once a week, yet the evidence
would indicate that it had not been cleaned"
for many weeks. Coal for fuel was piled upon
the floor and the seats were in a dilapidated
condition. -Many of the inmates seen in the
buildings and about the grounds were wretch
edly clothed and were so filthy in appearance
as to be absolutely nauseating and "repulsive.
The lowest depraved Inmates of the Stockton
Asylum, incapable of self-control, with drool
oozing from their mouths and noaes, were
clean compared toxonic of these.
There can be no possible explanation for
this condition of things other than bad man
agement. Discontent reigns supreme among
the inmates in regard to the management. The
atmosphere was rife with petty jealousies and
a system of espionage, which we are convinced
does exist on the part of the superintendent
was generally complained of. Practical disci
pline seemed to be absolutely wanting.
But little attention was paid to the ordi
nary complaints and murmtirings of indi
viduals, but a large number of the in
mates, including practically all of the
women, were for some reason or other ab
solutely afraid to talk to the members of
the committee, stating that the spies were
on the alert and that many times they
were treated harshly for speakin^ the
truth.
"To-day," said the Governor, "I visited
the Receiving Hospital in the basement of
the City Hall and the department set aside
for the detention of those who are charged
with insanity. Complaint had been made
that the Sheriff received such unfortunate
people and removed them from the cells
too quickly after being taken to the hos
pital.
c '" r l 1 * investigation showed me that the
bheriff cannot remove the patients too
soon. The place is simply useful for the
purpose for which they are used. The
place is cold, and while the sides are
padded the front part is not, and there is
nothing to prevent them from butting
their heads against the bars. There is no
lire there on Sundays, and then they are
particularly cold, and it is inhnman to
keep people in such a place.
"I shall go south to look into the institu
tions there, including the San Bernardino
asylum and the Whittier School."
Colonel N. T. James, manager of the
Alliance Insurance Company, character
izes Colonel John P. Irishes scathing criti
cisms of Governor Budd published in yes
terday's Call as a display of Billingsgate;
tiiat he himself has no wish further to call
forth by making any retort to the tirade" di
rected at him.
"I do not care," said Cohjnel James,
"what Mr. Irish may either think or say
about me. but I think that the cowardly
and uncalled-for attack against the family
of Mr. Hays is the result of his guilty
knowledge in having gone to Washington
with papers io obtain a position for Mr.
Hays and then taken it for himself.
"Where did he get his title, Anyway? I
think you would find it' was simply'from
having served on the Governor's staff.
"Jack Hays' father was the celebrated
Texas Ranger, one of the history-makers
of California. If he were alive now and
Irish should see him stepping off the Oak
land boat he wouldn't stay on the penin
sula."
LONGFELLOW SCHOOL.
Boards of Health and Education Trying
to Determine Upon a Plan for Its
Reopening.
The Board of Health and the Board of
Education held a joint meeting yesterday
afternoon in the office of Dr. Morse on
Stockton street, the purpose- being to ar
rive at some conclusion concerning the
Longfellow School, which has been closed
by the Board of Health, and the Rincon
School, which ajoins the Longfellow, and
which that board threatens to ciose.
Of the Board of Education there were
present: Clinton, McElroy, Henderson
md Knox. Of the Board of Health: Drs.
Hart, Williamson and Morse and Health
Officer Lovelace.
The members of the Board of Education
declared that it was of the utmost impor
tance to open and keep open the schools,
and the members of the Board of Health
said they recognized that fact, but the
health of the pupils and the City was of
the first importance.
Some plans were presented looking to a
temporary abatement of the nuisance until
the summer vacation, when it is possible
that the Longfellow School may be aban
doned and other provisions made for the
pupils.
>io action was taken, the matter being
deferred until the regular meeting of the
Board of Health this morning, at which
the Board of Education will be present
with iheir plans properly formulated.

DR. MACKENZIE'S LECTUBE.
Presbyterianism and Modern Thought
Diecuiised at Trinity Church.
'"Presbyterianism and Modern Thought"
was the subject of a very instructive and
highly entertaining lecture delivered by
the Rev. Robert Mackenzie in Trinity
Church last night.
The Rev. Mackenzie drew a fine distinc
tion between modern and ancient thought.
The thought of the intellectual man is a?
intense as hunger itself â the intense hun
ger for knowledge.
In Old England plum porridge has al
ways served ..with, the first course of a
Christmas dinner.

doesn't care two straw* about a fine spun
theory of how he should treat himself. He
may be predisposed to scrofula, or consump-
tion. That," he will" tell you "has noth-
ing to do with the case." He wants to ba
well. If he can be cured, I . write out a pre-
scription and send in your bill. So, here's
I the first part of the proposition.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery is
a medicine that permeates the whole body
as water goes through a sponge. It is a mi-
crobe hunter and a microbe killer. It is a
well-known fact that many persons of scrof-
ulous blood, encourage the breaking out
of unsightly sores, to prevent the disease
going to the lungs. There is no need of
living in this state of dread and discomfort
Purify the blood. It can be done. The
"Golden Medical Discovery." will cure 98
per cent, of all consumptive cases, also of
all other lingering, bronchial, throat and
lung diseases. Don't allow a druggist to
persuade you into taking something that
he says is "just as good." Maybe it's bet-
ter for him â better for his profits. .Take
the "Golden Medical Discovery â the
greatest discovery of the age. In addition,
in order to know yourself better, send to
the "World's "â¢ Dispensary Medical Associa-
tion, Buffalo, N.Y., 21 one-cent stamps to
cover cost of mailing only, and get in re-
turn. Dr. Pierces Common Sense Medical
Adviser. It is a book of 1008 pages, illus-
trated, and is full of, common sense talk
that any one who can read will understand.
â¢And here is the testimony of Mrs. K. E. En-
ders, of Carey, Ohio, in regard to the "Golden
Medical j Discovery V 1 : "I had a troublesome
skin disease. I suffered much from surface sores.
Nothing helped me until I tried the Golden
Medical Discovery.' A year or two later I had
: lung trouble. Again the 'Discovery' cured me."
