FEAR TROUBLE TO-DAY.
Governor Bradley Prepares to
Check a Riot in the
Legislature.
DISPUTE OVER ADJOURNMENT.
Presiding Officers in Senate and House
Disagree as to When the
Session Ends.
FRANKFORT, Ky., March 15. The
crowded hotel lobbies and political head
quarters, which had been in a state of
feverish excitement all day over the ex
pected crisis in the Senatorial contest to
morrow, had relaxed into a state of quiet
to-night when at 10 o'clock intense excite
ment was produced by the ringing of the
military call which summoned the Me-
Creary guards, the local militia company,
to assemble at once in its armory on Main
street. The continued ringing of the bell
caused almost a panic, as it was not known
in many parts of the city whether a riot
was in progress or whether a conflagration
had broken out. Several hundred people
collected in the vicinity of the armory and
at first Captain Games and Adjutant
Sharpley, who were in command, denied
that the company was called out for local
Fprvice. and declared that they were
destined to Newport where they were ex
pected to be needed in keeping Jackson
and Walling from beine: lynched should
they be brought to Kentucky.
It developed later, however, that no re
quest had been mede for troops at New
port and that this was only a ruse to avoid
it being known that they had been called
to take a hand to do duty at the State
House to-morrow.
Later in the evening the company
inarched direct to the State Capitol build
ing and is spending the night there. The
i First Regiment of Louisville has been sum
moned and will arrive here at 2a. m. Sev
eral companies of the Second will arrive
to-morrow morning.
The Democrats are highly indignant,
â¢nd a c; nftict bff weÂ«n the Legislative offi
cers, backed up by the citizens on one side
and the military on the other, is expected
to occur to-morrow. The Democrats say
that Governor Bradley's act in calling out
troops is unwarranted by law and that he
has laid himself liable to both fine and im
peachment.
The action of Governor Bradley in call
ing out troops is unprecedented in the
history of the State, and the people of the
State capital are highly incensed. Threats
are freely made of having the Governor
arrested for usurpation of authority, as it
is conceded by lawyers that the order was
illegal. There is no question that the sit
uation has been serious for several days,
but the local officers and legislative em
ployes were fully equal to the emergency
unless a riot should occur between the
members on the floor of the Assembly, and
if this should happen the military would
be powerless to prevent it.
The McCreary Guards, after forming at
their armory, marched in double quick
time down St. Clair street and took posses
sion of the State house. Hundreds of peo
ple thronged the streets on either side and
the soldiers were subjected to continued
guying and jeering by the crowd as they
passed along. Colonel "Jack" Chirm,
â¢â¢Jim" Williams, Sharp ana others of the
personal staff of Senator Blackburn, whom
the 700 soldiers are expected to suppress,
â¢were on the sidewalks, as were many
members of both houses of the Legislature.
The Blackburn men were taken by sur
prise and at a late hour their policy for to
morrow had not been outlined.
Senator Bronston (D.) called on Gov
ernor Bradley to-night and inquired as to
the object of the resort to the militia.
Governor Bradley stated that one of the
ji residing officers of the General Assembly
had made affidavit before him that the
local authorities had failed to prevent
rowdies from intimidating and overriding
members of both houses and, further, that
it had come to bis ears that he (the Gov
ernor) was to be arrested tomorrow and
the State house to be taken possession of
by bullies. All of these allegations were
flatly denied by Senator Bronston, who is
a leader of the Blackburn side, and the
interview ended.
There is a question as to whether to-mor
row's ballot will be the last or whether an
other will w taken on Tuesday. Lieutenant-
Governor Worthington inclines to the
opinion that the Legislature will stand ad
journed at neon Tuesday. Senator Ben
nett (R.) is also of this opinion, as are a
number of other prominent members of
both parties.
Speaker Blandford of the House, how
ever, believes the session does not expire
until Tuesday midnigi/t, and it is his in
tention to run that body up to the last
minute, in order not only to ballot for
Senator, but also to pass as many bills as
possible and atone as far as can be for the
past do-nothing record of the "wild
horses" over whom he has exercised par
tial control.
To-night's trains brought in a good-
Bized crowd of visiting politicians of both
parties, who are here to witness to-mor
row's struggle over the Senatorship. It is
conceded on all sides that the rif ly-second
ballot will be a true forecast of the final
result, and the excitement and suspense
over it is painful in the extreme. Governor
Bradley has given Sheriff Armstrong
orders for the swearing in of a Jarge force
. of deputies, who are expected to assist in
preserving the peace.
iScnator Blackburn spent Sunday in his
headquarters surrounded by his personal
lieutenants, among whom were ex-Con
gressman Phii Thompson, Colonel John
B. Thompson, General P. Watt Hardin,
Colonel "Jack" Chirm, Captain Williams,
The San Francisco Call.
Hon. Walter Sharp and a score of other no
less determined men. Boyle was also con
spicuous at his headquarters, and his lieu
tenants were particularly active all day.
Populist Poor, it is conceded, holds the
key to the situation to-morrow, so far as
the ballot is concerned, and as he has
flirted with both parties during the session
he is a much-watched individual jnst now.
He came here strongly inclined to the Re
publican side, but he cut loose from them
some time at;o, since which he has been
what he himself terms a free lance, voting
at first for Blackburn, but lately at ran
dom, so that he keeps both sides in the
dark. If he votes for Boyle to-morrow
Senators James and Walton will be voted,
and the Boyle men are confident Lieuten
ant-Governor Worthington will declare an
election on sixty-nine votes notwithstand
ing his ruling on former occasions that
seventy votes were required.

Strife in South Dakota Over the Sacking of
a Newspaper Office Grows
Bitter.
. CHAMBERLAIN,' S. Dak., March 15.â
The situation is becoming squally in
Aurora County over the sacking and burn
ing of the Mitchell Mail office, and the
regulars may have to be called out. After
the destruction of his office Editor Mac-
Bride went to Plarikinton, twenty miles
from Mitchell, and two of the newspapers
there promptly took up his fi>ht, the
Standard, in its regular edition, being par
ticularly bitter in its attacks upon the
participants. An extra edition of that
paper was issued by MacÃride and another
attack was made upon the former's
Mitchell enemies.
It having been intimated by some one in
Mitchell that the next bonfire "would occur
at Plankinton, Captain Andrews of the
Standard, going upon the supposition that
the alleged threat was intended for him, in
this week's issue of his paper refers to the
matter, and says that the local undertaker
has on his hands a good supply of coffins,
and that if. an attempt is made to carry
out the alleged threat of burning him out
those who attempt it need \ not carry cof
xins with them, as the expense of . inter
ment b as cheap in Plankinton as in

Collapse of the Episcopal Brothers of the
Chttrch.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 15.â News
reached this city to-day that the semi
monastic order in the Episcopal church
known as the Brothers of the Church,
which was founded by Russell Whitcomb,
known as Brother Hugh, has collapsed.
The order was recently moved from Mount
Jericho, Pa., to Fond dv Lac, Wis.
The news of the collapse of the order
created a mild sensation among the pro
fessors of the General Theological Sem
inary in this city. The fate of the project,
it was said at the seminary, would act as
a serious setback to similar movements
which might be proposed in the future.

PITTSBURG, Pa., March lf>.-The en

gerfest, which is to be held in Pittsburg in
June, have closed with 111 societies on the
list. Secretary C. Saam has not yet re
ceived a complete roster of the individual
singers, but, making a fair estimate, there
will t>6 about 2600 singers. This guaran
tees that the Pittsburg fest will be one of
the largest ever held. At the fest held in
Cleveland, Ohio, in 1893 there were but

WOODS' EASTERN RECORD
Pinkerton Detectives Identify the
Forger as an Old
Offender.
Once Arrested in Boston, But Released
on a Promise That He Would
Depart.
BOSTON, Mass., March 15.â The noto
rious forger who swindled banks in San
Francisco early in January last oat of
$20,000 on a raised draft has been identi
fied by the authorities of this city as a
well-known confidence man named Frank
LI Seaver, but who is better known in this
city by the name of Frederick Stebbins.
Seaver was caught on February 29 last
in St. Paul, Minn., where he gave the name
of D. W. Woods. He was unknown there,
but his picture was forwarded to Boston,
and this forenoon Superintendent John
Cornish of the Pinkerton agency in this
city, and Chief Inspector "William B.
Watts and Inspector Houghton identified
the forger as none other than the man who
was arrested here ou February 1. 1895.
Early in January Seaver, alias Stebbins,
cut a wide swath in San Francisco, where
he was known as A. H. Holmes and A. H.
Dean, representing himself to be a mer
chandise broker. He was arrested on sus
picion in this city on February 1, 1895. He
admitted that it was his intention to beat
people engaged in the mercantile line of
business, but as there was nothing crim
inal against him in this city he was al
lowed to go on condition that he would
leave the city.

autograph request for peace; that Adigrat
be immediately evacuatea; that the
Italians withdraw to the frontiers fixed by

and that Italy shall not accept offers of
alliance outside the colony of Erythrea.
The Tribuna also said tbat Menelik would
agree to oppose the dervishes.
Many of the Italian newspapers main
tain that the Anglo-Egyptian expedition
to Dongola will be of no service to the
Italians holding Kassala or to Italy her

Several brothers named Roy, in St. Lan

came into Opelousas Saturday night with
the avowed iv tent ion of taking the town.
The Mayor appointed five special officers
to 'preserve the peace. About 9 o'clock
they came into collision with the regula
tors and fifteen or twenty shots were ex
changed, resulting in three of the Roys
being wounded. The regulators, four in
number, were placed under arrest. None
of the officers were hurt.

Before the Disastrous Blunder

HAVANA, Cuba. March 15.â An un
toward military accident that occurred
last night, growing out of a misunder
standing of the reply to a challenge, re
sulted in the killing of twelve soldiers and
the wounding of a number of others. A
small band of insurgents had set tire to the
cane and buildings on a sugar estate near
Mariano, province of Havana. The smoke
attracted the attention of two columns of
Spanish troops who were advancing in
search of the rebels. The column which
first arrived on the estate entrenched
itself as a precaution against any sudden
attacK from the insurgents, who were sup
posed to be near.
The second column, consisting of the
San Quintin battalion, arrived on the
scene after dark. As it approached the
entrenchments of the first column it was
hailed by the usual "Alerta" from a
picket, and responded by calling out the
name of the battalionâ San Quintin.
The picket, confused by the sudden ap
proach of the column, misunderstood the
reply, taking it, from the similarity of
the sound, to be "Quintin Bandera," the
name of one ot the rebel leaders. He at
once concluded that the insurgents were
moving to attack the column to which he
belonged, and, without further parley,
discharged his piece and fell back into the
entrerchments. where the report of his
rifle bad caused all the troops to seize
their arms and prepare to repel an at
tack.
The front column had, in the meantime,
continued to advance, supposing that it
had come upon the rebels, for whom it
was looking. It had not gone far before
the first column poured a volley into its
ranks. The second column returned the
j fire, and then, in response to an order,
fixed bayonets and rushed forward to take
the entrenchments by storm.
As the soldiers went over the entrench
ments the first column poured another vol
ley into them, and then when the troops
came into close quarters it was discovered
from the uniforms and flags that a fatal
blunder had been made.
It is reported that the losses on both
sides in killed and wounded were over thirty
but there is a strong sufpicion that they
were much larger.
All the circumstances tended to the mak
ing of the mistake. Besides the darkness
the smoke from the burning canefields pre
vented the combatants from recognizing
each other. The mistake is greatly de
plored, and though it is generally held to
have been unavoidable, it is pretty certain
that the officers in command of the col
umns will be court-martialed.
CARJtIEB ARMS FOR CUBANS.
The Bermuda Makes Its Second Start for
the Island.
NEW YORK, N T . V., March 15.â The
Bermuda, laden with arms and ammuni
tion, left her anchorage about two miles
south of Liberty Island at 8:15 o'clock this
morning and passed Sandy Hook at 10
o'clock. She cleared yesterday for Vera
Cruz and no attempt was made to detain
her to-day as she left the narbor.
The munitions of war are undoubtedly
for the Cuban insurgents. A tugboat fol
lowed the Bermuda and it is understood
was in the employ of the Spanish Consul.
Dispatches from points along the Jersey
coast say the tug followed her out past
Asbury Park, but how far or for what pur
pose is not known.
The Bermuda when last seen had a full
head of steam on and was headed south
ward. If, as was rumored, a steamer is to
meet and transfer men to the Bermuda it
will undoubtedly be some way down the
coast. Captain O'Brien, an old Hell Gate
pilot, who is in command of the Bermuda,
has taken out filibustering expeditions in
years gone by.
Early this morning eighteen men of the
'crew were taken aboard the Bermuda.
About 7:30 the tugboat R. J. Barrett left
the Battery landing for the Bermuda. She
had on board the chief engineer, Thomas
Neilson, the second engineer, Hawden.
and the chief steward, Taylor. They had
previously been held as witnesses when
tbe Bermuda was caf tared an her first
attempt to go Cuba ward early on the morn
ing of February L's.
Another interesting part of the affair is
the fact that Tomas Estrada Palnin, the
head of the Cuban Junta, had suddenly on
Saturday night given up his room at the
Astor House, where he had been for some
time. Suspicious individuals believe that
not only a filibustering exDedition is under
way, but also it is the idea of the Cubans
to get their leaders and chief men together
in the island so that it may be shown to
the United States Congress that they have
a well-established government and are
worthy to have belligerent rights accorded
them.
Among the prominent Cuban leaders
who have been in this city are General
Calixto Garcia, Tomas Estrada Pal ma
and Secretary Perez, who latelj arrived
from Cuba. At the home of General Gar
cia it was said to-day that he left there
about 8 A. m. and said that he would be
home to dinner. It -was said that he had
previously denied having any intention of
going on the proposed expedition. Secre
tary Perez, who is said to be close to
Maceo, could not be found to-day.
Consul-General Arturo Baldassano when
seen at his home to-night said that he was
fully aware of the Bermuda's movements,
but refused to discuss the situation.
TO TIGHT JFOK CUBA.
Liberal Offers Made to a Troop of Chi
cago Hussars.
CHICAGO, 111., March 15.â A morning
paper says: Benor George Gomez, said to
be a uephew of General Gomez, is in Chi
cago on a sucret mission to aid Cuba's in- j
dependence. According to all reports
offers have been made previously, and are
now being renewed, to both private troops
and individuals in Chicago to get them
to go and fight for Cuban liberty.
Two months ago the Black Hussars, a
crack cavalry troop, was selected for a
most flattering offer from the insurgents.
The Black Hussars were offered as a troop
$1000 apiece to go to Cuba and fight on the
insurgent side. Their horses, arms and
uniforms were to be purchased from them
by the Cuban Government and would be at
their disposal uuring their term of fight
ing. In case of success attending the
patriot cause, pensions were to be given to
the survivors and to the families of those
killed.
A number of the members of the Black
Hussars were well in favor of the proposed
expedition. Headed by their captain,
Thomas S. Quincy, they came out plainly
in favor of the scheme. Then the majority,
headed by the cooler and wiser heads in
the troop, suddenly asserted itself. Captain
Quincy was relieved from command in the
middle of his term of office, and Samuel
B. Foster, attorney for the Chicago and
Grand Trunk Railroad, was elected in his
place. Mr. Foster, although absent from
the city at the time, was known to favor
moderate and cool-headed action, and was
opposed to accepting the offer of the Cuban
Government. Since the election of Captain
Foster, the majority against the proposed
expedition has held the reins of govern
ment in the troop, and all efforts of the
warlike minority have been laughed to
scorn.
But the contagion has spread to the
sister troop of the Chicago Hussars, and
many of that body are now considering
similar offers to those made individually
to the Black Hussars.
It was at this point of affairs that Senor
Gomez came to town. He arrived in
Chicago on Wednesday night and is still
here, although his whereabouts is carefully
concealed by his friends. Since his arrival
the talk among the more warlike of the
hussars about Cuba has broken out afresh.
THE 8-EXATK'S ATTITUDE.
May Send the Cuba Resolution Rack to
Conference.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 15.-It is
probable that the week opening to-morrow
will bring the conclusion of the Cuban de
bate in the Senate, for Sherman, in charge
of the conference report, has given notice
that he intends to press the question to an
early vote. Senator Morgan of Alabama,
the ex-chairman of the committee, has the
floor on the report whenever it is called up.
It is not unlikely that he will reply to some
of the strictures upon the members of the
Senate made by Minister de Lome. Others
who intend to speak on the subject are
Senators Platt of Connecticut, White of Cal
ifornia, and probably Butler of North Car
olina.
The chief objection to the conference re
port is the acceptance by the Senate con
ferees of the third clause of the House
resolution relating to intervention. This
identical proposition was submitted to the
Senate Committee, and after mature de
liberation was rejected. One prominent
Senator, who intend* to speak on this sub
ject, says that if the Senate Committee
had reported this clause in its own resolu
tions they would not have received one
third of the vote of the Senate.
The objection to this clause is so bitter
that it is not impossible the report may be
sent back to conference, although such a
contingency is not seriously expected.
One Senator, who has given the^question
careful consideration, is authority for the
statement that the report will be agreed
to, but that the vote against it will be at
least twenty, instead of six, as against the
original proposition.

Lord Salisbury's Course Is Commended
at Berlinâ Dissensions at Wil

BERLIN, Germany, March 15.â Count
Gouichowski, Austrian Minister of For
eign Affairs, has returned to Vienna from
his visit to Berlin. He took the route by
the way of Dresden, where he held a brief
conversation with Dr. Schurig, President
of the Council of Ministers of Saxony, and
Herr yon fcieydewitz, Saxony'a Minister of
Public Instruction, who awaited his ar
rival at the station.
The results of the Austrian Foreign
Minister here have become distinctly
visible in the changed tone of the semi
official press in regard to the relations be
tween Germany and England. The cue
seems to have been given to deny that any
differences have existed between the Gov
ernments at Berlin and London, or else
to ignore the fact of there having been a
strain m their relations which threatened
a definite estrangement of the two
countries.
The North German Gazette, which as re
cently as last Tuesday accused England of
encouraging the French desire for revenge
upon Germany, and the English news
papers of rejoicing at the prospect of a
rupture of the Dreibund, referred yester- â 
day to England's active sympathy with
Italy, treating the matter from the stand
point of approval of England's course.
Still more significant is the fact that the
Gazette has not a single word to say sug
gesting the existence now or heretofore of
any strain in the relations between Eng
land and Germany.
Another example of the German change
of front is shown in the Weser Zeitung of
Bremen, which publishes a Berlin inspired
j nfcje upon the theme, "England wishes to
maintain Egypt.'' "It is in the interest of '
Germany," the note observes, "to preserve
the balance of power in the Mediterran
ean, and this can best be done by main
taining the the status quo in Egypt. The
security of the Dreibund would be in
creased if the naval power of England
should re-enforce the Italo-Austriau posi
tion."
Finally the article argues that the inter
ests of the Dreibund and England are so
mutually independent that no quarrel over
the Transvaal ought to be suffered to im
peril these interests.
The semi -official newspapers in Austria-
Hungary boast of the success of Count
Goiuchowski in achieving a perfect under
standing with the German Emperor in re
gard to the relations between the Dreibund
and England, and also upon other ques
tions. The Pesther Lloyd s<ays, that tLe
Dreibund is safe, and has the corollary of

As regards the prosecution of the Abys
sinian campaign by Italy the Austro-Ger
nian official view of the matter has under
gone a change. Instead of advising the
continuance of active operations in Africa I
until a signal victory shall vindicate the
prowess of Italy, it is now held that it
would be best to limit the scope of Italian
occupation in Africa to the triangle formed
by Asmara, Keren and Massowan, hold
the line co Kassaia and make peace with
King Menehk.

the substance of the opening communica
tion of the Marquis di Rudini, the new
Italian Premier, to the Italian Chambers
upon their assembling this week.
The past week has witnessed an inces
sant round of diplomatic and social fes
tivities. Besides attending the banquets
given in honor of Count Goluchowski by
the Austrian Embassador and Prince yon
Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chancellor, the
Emperor gave a dinner on Thursday in
honor of the seventy-fifth birthday of
Prince Luitpold, Regent of Bavaria, and
was also present at the wedding of his
aid-de-camp, Major Count yon Moltke.
and dined with the officers of the Pioneers
and Guards. The season will virtually
close when the court leaves Berlin next
week.
As the Hon. Edwin F. Uhl, the newly
appointed Embassador of the United
States, will not arrive here before March
2, when the Emperor will start for Italy,
he will not be able to present his creden
tials until the end of May, the time of the
annual review, which the Emperor will
return in season to attend. It is generally
hoped in the American colony here that
Mr. Uhl will rent the vacant residence cf
Prince Stolberg-Wernigerode, in Wilhelm
strasse. which is most adequate in every
respect as a residence, and altogether
more suitable for receptions and other
functions pertaining to the social duties
of an Embassador than any other house
obtainable in Berlin.
Two of the leading aristocratic families
of Berlin bade farewell to Berlin society
on Thursday in consequence of court
events which have rendered their contact
with the imperial circle uncomfortable, to
cay the least.
The first departure, which took place in
the forenoon, was that of Prince and Prin
cess Frederick of Hohenzoilern, who left
the Anhalter station for Dess3U en route
for Munich. The platform of the station
was crowded -with their friends, and Prin
cess Reuss and Princess Hohenlohe, on
behalf of the social circle of the departing
Prince and Princess, presented them with
superb bouquets. An entire compartment
of the car in which the Prince and Prin
cess sat was tilled with floral tokens. The
leave-taking of the couple delayed the
starting of the train several minutes.
Later in the day a similar scene occurred
at the Stettiner station, upon the occasion
of the departure of Prince and Princess
Albert of Sachsen-Altenburg for their new
residence, the castle of Kuchelnuss in
Mecklenburg. Bouquets were presented
to the departing guests in profusion and
the handshakings, embraces and tears gave
the leave-taking the appearance of a life-
long farewell.
In order to maintain the luster of the
court, which is threatened to be dimmed
by these and other recent withdrawals of
society leaders from Berlin, inconsequence
of differences of one kind or another with
the head of the imperial house, the Em
peror has induced Prince yon Furstenburg
to accept the office of chief marshal of the
imperial court. Prince yon Furstenbun;,
Tvho is a South German Prince and a scion
of a mediatized house, was reluctant to
accept the office, and only yielded to the
pressure brought tn bear upon him by the
Kaiser. The office of chief marshal rather
impairs the rank of Prince of Furstenburg,
but his incumbency thereof will add to
the eclat of the imperial court.
Prince Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-
Holstein, brother of the Empress, is again
becoming a favorite in society. He has re
opened his salon and house in Universitats
strasse and receives upon a large scale, en
tertaining his guests lavishly at private
theatricals, dinners, etc.
Society says that the Prince has sown
his wild oats and settled down to a well
regulated and well-conducted life. He
now studies social and political questions
and reads works treating of trades unions,
the labor laws, etc., all of which refute the
recent reports that he had fallen into his
old habits, was spending more money
than he could afford and that his bills
were being offered for sale with no pur
chasers at 50 percent discount. Prince
Ernst has established large paper mills
at Prinkenau and has devoted himself to
the personal management of the entailed
part of his estate at that place, which is
valued at 1,000,000 marks. He is also
building a new castle and it is announced
that as soon as it is finished he will marry.
At a meeting of the Bacteriologic Soci
ety held last week Dr. Koch's tuberculine
was fiercely denounced by many eminent
professors in attendance. Professor Lieb
erich declared that tuterculine had been
discredited by all physicians, even veter
inary practitioners, as its use was directly
dangerous.
Dr. Hausmann said that a greater per
centage of lung diseases had been cured by
allowing nature to help itself than by the
treatment of experts. The debate arose
on the report that Dr. Koch was preparing
a new publication in advocacy of tuber
culine.
Herr Mettermuch, German Consul at
Cairo, has been raised to the rank of Min
ister Plenipotentiary. Herr Mettermuch
was fn the .confidence of Lord Cromer, the
British representative in Egypt, on the
subject of {he new campaign in the
Soudan, and it is believed here that it was
he who suggested to the Government In
Berlin that such a campaign would be op
portune. The semi-official newspapers
concur in praising Lord Salisbury's de
cision to put a complete check upon the
French pressure for the evacuation of
Egypt by Great Britain, and declare that
all civilized nations approved his action.
German cavalry officers have been en
gaged to organize a new Chinese cavalry
service, modeled after the German system.
The Emperor and Empress will pay a
visit to Queen Victoria at Cimiez on March
26. The Queen, it is announced, will not
go to Coburg to attend the marriage of her
granddaughter, Princess Alexandra of
Coburg, to the Hereditary Prince of Hohen
lohe-Langenburg, wnich will take place on
April 20. The Emperor and Empress and
Empress Frederick will be present.
Prince Bismarck has consented to receive
on his birthday, April 1, the members of
the Hamburg; National Union and deputa
tions from Berlin, Leipsic, Bonn and other
places. The ex-Chancellor's son-in-law,
Count yon Kantzau, is authority for the
statement that Prince "Bismarck is in ex
cellent health.
The American tenor, Bavin, will make

Entire family Poisoned.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., March 15.â The family
of W. B. Taylor, a wealthy farmer living
near Craitr, was poisoned last week, the re
sults proving disastrous. Mr. Taylor died
last night. His nephew, Frank Chrisrnan,
who lives with the Taylors, is dying, and
three sons and a daughter are in "a critical
condition. It is not known how the poison
was administered. The authorities are in
vestigating the case, aided by several
prominent physicians.
Pennsylvania's Blizzard.
ALTOONA, Pa., March 15. â With
twenty inches of snow on the ground in
this section, a high wind in thÂ« mountain
districts and the snow still falling heavily,
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company ap
prehends trouble in getting trains over
the mountain. If the snow and winds
continue all night traffic will surely be
blockaded.
CRUSHING OUT
CHRISTIANITY.
Armenian Followers of the
Christ Scourged by the
Sultan.
CRUELTIES TO WOMEN.
Systematic Degradation of the
Wives and Daughters of
the Sufferers.
MEN THROWN INTO PRISON.
Civilized Governments Look Idly On
While the Moslem Outrages
Continue.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, March
15. â Later news from Harpoot shows that
in that vilayet at least some sort of orders
have gone out to discountenance the forced
coversions. When the authorities from
Harpoot telegraphed to Constantinople for
instructions the reply came : "Do not use
force to convert."
The local Governor interpreted the or
ders literally and even announced that
every one was to return. This change,
however, is only in the cities ana large
towns; in villages and hamlets such or
ders will have no effect. Information from
various points in the provinces of Sivas,
Harpoot, Diarbekir, Bitlaa and Van shows
tnat the practice of forcing Christians to
become Moslems is still in active progress.
The purpose to abolish Christianity is
pressed forward with the whole force of
the Government by the indirect means of
depriving the Christian communities of
their men of influence who have survived
the massacres. In every town or city
where the massacres occurred arrests of
such men are now in progress. No charges
are preferred against the men arrested.
Another indirect method of destroying
the Cnristian communities in these devas
tated provinces is the degradation of
womanhood among the Christian commu
nities. A systematic debauchery of Chris
tian women is carried on in nearly all the
devastated districts. It is as if the Turks
wish to make sure that the women,
always conservative in matters of religion,
shall lose their self-respect and the grounds
of their religious hope.
They therefore seize the Christian women
day after day and week after week and
inflict indignities upon them with im
punity.
It seems the Christian governments are
powerless in the presence of a beggared
nation of 9,000 000 of Turks, or they are un
willing to take any peremptory measures
to prevent Christianity from being crushed
out of certain parts of the Turkish empire.
Surely they might take so simple a meas
ure as to appoint Consuls to reside in the
principal cities of the provinces. The
mere residence of a Consul will stop a host
of infamies which the Turks ordinarily dare
to commit only when they think they can
deny them with impunity.
CLARA BARTOA'S WORK.
Supplies Sent to Armenia by Caravan
JFVoÂ»n Alexandrite.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 15.-The
following are extrocts from a report by
mail from Miss Clara Barton to the Ameri
can National Red Cross here. The report
is dated Constantinople, February 25, and
Miss Barton says:
"Immediately upon our arriving here
Judge Terrell, with his customary prompt
ness, lost no time in notifying the Turkish
Government of our arrival and asking for
an audience for me with the Foreign Min
ister. This was most courteously erranted
and held on the 18th. We were informed
that tbe permit was granted for my party
to enter the interior to afford relief to the
suffering people there, and that no ob
structions would be put in the way.
"Mr. Terrell at once cabled that informa
tion to Mr. Olney, but the permit or pa
pers are to be signed by the Sultan. This
is the time of the great fast of Kamazan,
during wbich no work but the ordinary la
bor is supposed to be done, and the papers
have waited until now. Minister Terrell
yesterday demanded through the Russian
Embassador that the papers be attended
to, and he waits in much certainty for fa
vorable action immediately."
Since the date of this letter cable dis-
I patches have announced the signing of the
papers by the Sultan and the issuance of
the necessary permits and passports. The
report continues:
"Meanwhile we are not losing a mo
ment's time. Dreadful news comes in
from the battlefield of Zeitoun. It has not
failed to reach you for it went to the press.
Sir Philip Currie has asked that I send re
lief to Zeitoun and we are getting our sup
plies ready for shipment via Alexandretta
at the first moment the papers are issued.
Our agents are to-day purchasing sup
plies to be taken by caravan from Alex
andretta. There are always delays of
boats, only about one a week going over,
and this occupies a week in the voyage
across.
"Our dragomen are ready, the Turkish
guard will be provided and General Field
Agent Dr. Hubbell will lead the first de
tachment up into the mountains. We
find supplies as cheap here as at home,
some even better. It is said tnat food,
such as grain, flour, etc., can be found all
through the interior, therefore we shall
not have to transport that. Dr. Hubbell
will see what need there is for seed and
other materials for helping the destitute
people to raise something for themselves.
There we shall employ our customary
methods in an endeavor to assist the peo
ple to provide for themselves as soon as
circumstances will permit."

LONDON, Eno., March 15.â The Times

KELLY AN INSOLVENT.
Business Disaster Overtakes a Prominent
Democratic Politician of
Minnesota.
BT. PAUJLi, Mixn., March 15.â 1t was
learned to-night that on Saturday evening
a document was filed in the office of the
clerk of the District Court, which proved
to be the assignment of Patrick H. Kelly,
one of the foremost men of the State. For
a quarter of a century Kelly has been a
leading wholesale merchant of St. Paul, is
at present a member of the Legislature,
was for ten years National Democratic
Committeeman for Minnesota and has al
ways been foremost in the promotion of
public works. The assignment is made to
John F. Meagher of Kankato, a close po
litical and personal friend of Mr. Kelly.
The P. H. Kelly Mercantile Company has
not yet made an assignment, but ft was
announced that it would at once proceed
to adjust its affairs in the same way that
Kelly had chosen. .Kelly was ill at the
Merchants' Hotel this evening and could
not be seen, but a near friend said :
"This assignment should not be regarded
as a failure in the ordinary sense of the
term. Mr. Kelly has been a business man
all his life and has broken down. He has
been ill for nearly a year, although he did
not take to his room and bed until a short
time ago. He has been alarmed about his
condition for some time and has felt that
he had not long to live. His interests are
vast and he concluded that it would be
hest to adjust his affairs through an as
signment. Such a course was really not
necessary, as Mr. Kelly. has ample means.
The P. H. Kelly Mercantile Company will,
it is stated, follow Mr. Kelly's plan and
seek aa adjustment in the same manner."
NORTHERN PACIFIC PLANS
Reorganization Scheme Com
pleted at a Conference Held
in New York.
Traffic Arrangements With the Great
Northern Road Will Probably
Be Made.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 15.â The re
organization plan of the Northern Pacific
Railroad was completed yesterday at a
conference held at the company's office.
The details had been known in high
financial circles for some time. Full ap
proval has been received from the German
bondholders.
The new plan creates a voting trust
composed of J. P. Morgan, August Bel
mont, Dr. Siemens of Berlin, Johnston
Livingston and probably John D. Rocke
feller. The proposed changes reduce the
fixed charges to about $6,000,000. The
common stock and preferred stock are
subject to assessments of $10 and $15 re
spectively.
All the interests are in harmony as re
gards the new plan. These include the
stock and bond holding inteiest repre
sented by President Bray ton Ives, the
Adams committee, which hap close rela
tions with the German investors, and J.
P. Morgan, who represents the financial
interpsts concerned in the new scheme.
It is deemed probable that a traffic
arrangement will be made -with President
James J. Hill of the Great Northern, but
the present plan precludes any consolida
tion of the two companies. The Nort i crn
Pacific has been in the hands of receivers
since 1893. Steps will be taken in ac
cordance with the new plan to reorganize
it on a firm basis.
PLIGHT OF THE IWIAX A.
Cannot Enter the Port Royal Dock Be
cause of Lotv Water.
PORT ROYAL. S. C, March 15.â The
battleship Indiana went up to the dock
this morning, but found only twenty-four
feet of water. The Indiana steamed ud to
within a short distance of the dock, but
could not go in unless there were twenty
five feet registered. The strong westerly
winds that prevailed up to yesterday were
against a high tide. Another effort will be
made to go Into the dock to-morrow, and
if there is a good easterly wind there is
likely to be sufficient water. If there be
no docking to-morrow it is likely to be de
layed until the 28th, when there is a full
moon.
The understanding is that the crew of
the Indiana w r ill go through an extensive
drilling exercise nere, as there are fine
ranges for the guns and excellent opj>ortu
nities for target practice. There seems to
be no foundation for the report that the
test of the thirteen-inch guns was unsatis
factory. On the contrary, Captain Evans
is delighted with the result.
EX-GO VERA OR IRELAND GOSE,
He Filled Many High Positions in the
lione Star State.
NEW ORLEANS, La., March 15.â John
Ireland, ex-Governor of Texas, and one of
the prominent members of the Southern
bar, died in San Antonio to-day after an
illness of two weeks.
Governor Ireland was born in Hart
County, Kentucky, in 1825 and went to
Texas in 1853. He was a member of the
constitutional convention in 1866 and
served aa Representative and Senator in
the Texas Legislature in the early seven
ties. In 1875 he was appointed a member
of the Texas Supreme Court, but resigned.
He was a delegate to the National Demo
cratic convention in 1880, and in 1882 was
elected Governor. He was re-elected in
1884. At the time of his death Governor
Ireland was president of the San Antonio
and Gulf Shore road.
LOVE CAUSES A TBAGEDY.
Murder and Suicide Follow ths Rejection
of a Suitor.
SENECA FALLS, N. V., March 15.â A
terrible double tragedy occurred this
morning, which caused great excitement
in this village. Thomas Pelkilton, a coach
man, shot Miss Minnie Mansell, a < omes
tic, at the residence of Edward Mynderz,
in the northern part of town.
Pelkilton had lately been paying atten
tions to the young woman, who was highly
respected, and she refused to receive them
from him, as he was considered a disrepu
table character. Yesterday she refused to
ride in a cutter with him, and since then
he had been drinking considerably. This
morning he went to the Mynderz house,
and after shooting Miss Mandell twice in
the head blew his own brains out.

POOLROOMS LOST
MANY THOUSANDS

EXTENT OF THE FRAUD
Between a Quarter and a Half
Million Dollars Was
Paid Out.
HAD BEEN PLAYED HEAVILY.
The Deal Believed to Have Been
Planned in New Yorkâ Losses
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, March 15.â 1t will be many
a day before Doolroom men of the United
States will recover from the shock they
sustained Saturday night, when they
found they had been made the victims of
the most stupendous wire-tapping fraud
that was ever perpetrated in this country.
Rough estimates made yesterday indi
cated that the poolrooms had lost between
$250,000 and $500,000 on the racing mare
Royal Nettie, whose name was sent out
from the New Orleans racetrack as winner
of the sixth race, in spite of the fact that
she ran next to last and that the race was
won by a horse named Plug.
Tue total may be increased materially
after the 280 poolrooms that are running
in New York City give out an accounting
of their losses. That they were hit hard
is not doubted by racing men, for the im
pression is general in Chicago that the
fraud was planned in New York and car
ried through with New York money.
The total losses of five Chicago rooms,
according to reports that came from semi
official sources yesterday, will aggregate
about $27,000. James O'Leary of the Stock
yards is the heaviest loser of the five, his
sheets, showing that he paid out nearly
$10,000 on the race. Of that amount he
paid $7000 in a lump sura to a stranger,
who had bet him $1000 at odds of 6 to 1
that the mare Royal Nettie would win.
METRIC SYSTEM FAVORED.
Uniform Weights and Measures to Be
Adopted by the Government.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 15.â An
interesting report has been made by
Charles W. Stone of Pennsylvania in favor
of a bill for the adoption of the metric sys
tem of weights and measures, which has
been for- some weeks before the House
Committee on Coinage, Weights and
Measures.
Referring to the objection that the
words and and terms of the metric system
are foreign and too long for convenient
use, the reply is made that the terms are
not simply for American use; they are for
all nations.
Tbe ease with which other nations, ex
cept France, wrtere vacillating legislation
and revolutionary disorders impeded the
work, have male the change of systems,
has been surprising. Germany chanced to
the compulsory system in two years, Aus
tria in three, withoat friction or trouble.
The conclusion reached by the commit
tee i 3 that the metric system of weights
and measures should be adopted by the
various departments of the Government,
although not deeming it wise to change
the methods of surveying public lands.
They recommend therefore that its adop
tion by the departments be fixed for July
1, 1898, and by the Nation at large, coinci
dent with the dawn of the twentieth cen
tury, January 1, 1901.

REED IS OREGON'S CHOICE
Conservative Eepublicans Prefer
the Maine Statesman to
McKinley.
The Protectionist Not Likely to Get
the Vote of the Northern
Stated
CHICAGO, 111., March 15.â "Oregon's
ten delegates will go to the Republican
National Convention uninstructed," said
J. B. Montgomery of Portland, Or., at the
Great Northern yesterday. Mr. Mont
gomery is an ex-member of the Oregon
Legislature and a constant attendant at
Republican conventions.
There is a division of sentiment in the
State, however, that is not to be over
looked. The mass of the people are for
McKinley, but the more thoughtful and
conservative element is for Tom Reed as
Presidential candidate. This division re
sults from the fact that there is a feeling
that McKiniey's pronounced tariff meas
ures may prove disastrous and may result
in a reaction that will insure Democratic
success four years from the coming elec
tion. People are now so disgusted with
Democratic rule they are apt to be driven
to extremes. The result is, while the ma
jority is shouting for McKinley and want
ing to see him elected, the businessmen
are strongly in favor of Reed, for the
reason that they think they see in him
the conservation of their best interests.
"The delegates to the convention will be
governed, of course, by the exigencies of
the situation, and it is in no wise certain
Major McKinley will get their vote. In
fact, I think McKiniey's chances uncer
tain. You may have noticed when a can
didate has been spoken of so enthusiastic
ally as McKinley has he has in former
years been turned down, and I should not
be at all surprised if this will be the case in
the coming nomination.
"So far as the Democrats are concerned,
they haven't a show in our State. We are
bimetallists, but not on the basis of 16 to
1. We want honest money of international
value, and will stand for that Jrom first to
last."
They Favor MctLinley.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., March 15.â 1n twelve
counties of Missouri yesterday Republican
conventions were held to select delegates
to State and Congressional conventions
Ten conventions passed resolutions favor
ine McKinley for President and one was
non-committal. In Caldwell County no
instructions were given, but a poll of the
delegates showed 92 for McKinley, 3 for
Lincoln and 2 for Reed. The coinage
question was generally ignored.
Fifer to Be a Committeeman.
BLOOMINGTON. 111., March 15.â Ex-
Governor Fifer announced yesterday that
he had decided to accept the position of
National Republican Committeeman from
Illinois; to which he was elected by the
State Committee early in the week. The
announcement was made at the close of a
long conference between the ex-Governor
and Dr. Jamieson, chairman of the State
Committee.
SKIPPED FROM SPOKANE
Manager Dppenheimer of the
Northwest Milling and Power
Company Absconds.
Attachments Levied Against All of
His Property That Can Be
Fonnd.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 15.-An af
fidavit tiled in the Superior. Court yester
day charges Simon Oppenheimer with ab
sconding from the country. Attachments
have been levied against all his property
here tbat can be found.
Oppenheimer has been prominent in the
affairs of Spokane and. has been reputed
quite wealthy and always a good hustler.'
He was formerly connected with the Spo
kane Mill ComDany, whose large plant
was burned several years ago. A couple
of years ago he went to San Francisco and
then to Holland, where he raised a large
sum of money, coming back to Spokane
and organizing the Northwest Milling and
Power Company, which company pur
chased the plant of the Spokane Power
Com pany, some of the best of the river
property in the city. The company then
bogan the erection of a large Phoenix saw
mill, which ia now running, and also com
pleted a new 1000-barrel nourmiil, which,
however, has not commenced work.
At present they are engaged in con
structing large and expensive dams and a
flume, preparatory to putting in an electric
light plant.
It has been generally known for some
time that the affairs of the company were
in bad shape, and some criticized Manager
Oppenheimer. He left a few weeks ago,
ostensibly for the East to raise money and
settle affairs, but it is claimed he was un
successful and will never he seen in Spo
kane again. Members of the company de
cline to discuss affairs, but his friends say
he will be back inside of a' week and settle
matters. The charge has created consid
erable excitement on account of his promi
nence.
SAN DIEGAN LOST
IN A BLIZZARD
The Thrilling Experience of
an Old Miner in the
Mountains.
FAMISHED AND COLD.
He Wandered About for Six Days
Through Several Feet
of Snow.
AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE STORY
Coming as It Does From a Region
Supposed to Be Semi-
Tropic.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 15.â During
the recent storm a miner named J. J.
Green had an experience in the mountains
of San Diego County that sounds Incred
ible coming from a country thai is sup
posed to be semi-tropic. Green was on his
way from San Fehpe, on the edge of the
desert, to Julian, some twenty miles, and
was overtaken by a blinding snowstorm
while on the trail. The trail was soon ob
literated and Green lost his bearings.
Then for six days he wandered among the
mountains, the familiar face of which had
been completely changed, so that he could
not tell where to go. He had the wide
stretch of desert on one side to show him
the directions, but though he kept on the
road toward Julian, as he thought, he saw
no sign of civilization.
The snowfall increased to such an ex
tent that Green had great difficulty in
traveling, often making his way through
three feet of snow. He fortunately had a
little food with him, which he increased
by shooting a rabbit or two.
After battling almost a week with the
elements he ran across a familiar hill that
showed him where he was. Almost ex
hausted, he dragged himself five miles
farther and reached Julian in a famished
condition. Green said that from several
places on the mountain, where he was
wading through snowdrifts, he could see
the desert and make out the long waves of
heat arising. At a point between him ana
the desert the tender young grass was
sprouting, unharmed by the cold. He
suffered intensely from the cold, and will
require some weeks to fully recover from
his trip. _____________
SANTA CRUZ'S RUNAWAY
Myrtle Castello's Family Greatly
Distressed at Being Unable
to Find Her.
The Stage-struck Girl Is Supposed to
Be Living in San Fran
cisco.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 15.â The
father and brother cf Myrtle Castello, the
eirl who ran away from Santa Cruz on
March 6, are in distress over the inability
of the police and the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children to locate
her. There is no doubt that the girl went
away with Mrs. Lulu Hampton, who, with
Harry Hampton, were here for some time
pretending to be stranded actors. They
were accompanied by J. M. Curtis, whom
Hampton introduced as a bookkeeper in
the show business. The two women went
away together by rail and the men re
mained here until last Saturday, when
they left by steamer.
The girl's home is a small cottage in the
rear of the lodging-house where the woman
Hampton and the two men were stopping.
She has often expressed to her brother,
William Fowler Castello, her desire to go
on the stage and he had as often dissuaded
her.- He was suspicious that she would go
with the Hamptons and watched her, and
the day she left he got to the depot in time
to see them board the cars, but too late to
stop the train.
He received a letter from his sister, dated
March 10, in which she told where she
was â 425 Kearny streetâ and asked him to
help Hampton and Curtis to lood aa they
were still in Santa Cruz and broke. She
signed herself Myrtle Curtic, though the
spelling was probably. her error. She wrote
like a girl tliat believed she was doing no
wrong, and the next day wrote to her
father in an affectionate way, asking him
to send her clothing as she went away
with no other articles than those she wore.
She was dressed in a dark green cashioere
gown, with green changeable shoulder
trimmings, and plain black felt sailor hat.
She is about five feet four inches high and
weighs 125 pounds; has blue eyes, brown
hair and ruddy cheeks.
Mr. Castello is the night watchman at
the Southern Pacific roundhouse. Her
father was divorced from her mother and
retained custody of the boy and girl, the
wife's mother, Mrs. Stewart, caring for
them. Mr 9. Stewart is a cousin of John
Blythe, one of the Kentucky heirs of toe
Blythe estate: also a cousin of Senator
Stewart of Nevada. The Castellos speak
of John Blythe as cousin, and the girl
wrote her father that ehe had visited him
in San Francisco and would go this week
(to-morrow) with him to Kentucky. She
said also in her lettler that she was work
ing in a boarding-house at $15 a month
and sleeping at her Cousin John's.

AN OCEAN GREYHOUND.
Its Government and Control, and What
It Means to Bun It.
Just as the government of the city of
New York ia divided among the Mayor,
Aldermen and boards and Commissioners
of various departments, so the adminis
tration of a giant steamship is divided into
specialties. The Mayor is the chief officer
of the city. The captain is the chief officer
of the ship. He is more than that. From
the time she leaves port until she enters
port he is the master of the life and liberty
of every person aboard the -ship, as well
as of all the property in it He is an
autocrat. Of course, he must administer
his authority wise^. Unwise autocrats
don't last long, whether afloat or ashore.
The head of each department is respon
sible for all that goes on in it. The first offi
cer is at the head of the crew, or navigat
ine department. The chief engineer di
rects everything connected with the en
gines. The chief steward has full control
of all that has to do with the comfort of
the passengers and crew. Each of the
chiefs makes a written report at noon
every day. Thus the captain is kept in
formed of everything pertaining to the
ship's welfare.
Every one of the senior officers of the
ship is a duly qualified master, capable of
taking her around the world if need be.
The day is divided into "watches," or
tours of duty, of four hours each. One
junior officer is on the bridge with each
senior officer on duty. The senior officer
directs the ship's course. He never leaves
the bridge while he is on watch. Should
he do so he would be dismissed at once.
There is no excuse possible. It would be
just as if he had died suddenly. His
friends would all feel sorry, but nothing
could be done to help him. Two seamea
are always on watch in the bow of th#
ship, and two more in the foretop. Twice
as many are on the lookout in thick
weather. Observations are taken every
two hours. In the good old sailing ship
days the captain was content to "take the
sun" at noon every day. If the sky was
clouded lor a day or two it really didn t
matter much, for he could jog along on
dead reckoning.
But on an ocean greyhonnd, rushing
over the course between New York and
Europe at the rate of more than twenty
miles' an hour, it is highly important that
the ship's position be known all the time.
Fog may come down at any moment, ob
servations may not be obtainable for ten
or twelve hours. The positions of more
than one hundred stars are known. By"
observing any one of these the ship s
whereabouts can be ascertained in a few
minutes. Of course, the "road" becomes
more or less familiar to a man who crosses
the ocean along the same route year after
year. Yet this familiarity never_ breeds
contempt or any carelessness. No man
knows all the influences that affect the
currents of the ocean. You may find the
current in one place the same forty times
in succession ; on the forty-first trip it
may be entirely chanced. Sometimes a
big* storm that has ended fonr or five
hours before the steamship passes a cer
tain place may have given the surface cur
rent a strong set in one direction. There
is no means of telling when these influ
ences may have been at work save by tak
ing the ship's position frequently.â
Harper's Round Table.
The Women of Denmark.
Danish ladies are, of course, as hetero
geneous, seducing, disappointing and ador
able aa the ladies elsewhere. I scarcely
know if they form a national type of very
clear individuality. The most winsome
of them are English in their ways up
to a certain point, though they have not
the elasticity of movement that an athletic
training gives to our girls. Their features
appeal to an Englishman; he seems to see
in their clear complexions, light hair and
gray or blue eyes something more than the
glimmering of a personal relations hip.They
are, moreover, or certainly seem, delightful
ly spontaneous and fresh. The curse of mau
vaise honte knows them not. This, too,
although at heart they are excessively
sentimental, and by culture in very many
cases devotees of Ibsen. One would ex
pect such an alliance to produce in them
much psychological distress. But I fancy
their hearts are still sounder than their
heads; they would forgiveâ though, per
haps with a pangâ where Ibsen's iron
conscienced heroine would exclaim to her
husband of about two years' standing,
"I have been deceived in you. You are
not nearly perfect, and therefore we must
part. Farewell !" The time may coma
when they will, as a class, be educated ud
to the sublime pitch of selfishness (mis
called self-respect) apotheosized in certain
modern plays and novels, but it will not
come easily. â Cornhill Magazine.

Not a Ship Is in Sight and

Silent.
BARELY A SIGN OF LIFE.
Nearly a Hundred Mechanics
Were Discharged During
the Past Week.
AND THE END IS NOT YET.
Only a Congressional Appropriation
Will Cause the Hammer to
Ring Again.
YALLEJO, Cal., March 15.â The ap
pearance of the water front at the navy
yard reminds one strongly of a deserted
mining camp. For a distance of 5000 yards
from the ferry gate 10 beyond the coal
sLeds there is not a single ship in sight.
The only sign of life at one time Saturday
afternoon this entire distance was a couple
of men with corn brooms in hand sweep
ing the wharf for Sunday inspection and
a few little chippie birds hopping here and
there in search of a grain of food. In some
of the offices clerk 3 were busy making out
discharges of mechanics â shipwrights, fit
ters, machinists, helpers and others being
among the list. No one knew until quit
ting time, outside of those engaged in
making out the list, who were to go. Al
most a hundred men during the past week
have packed their tools and received their
pay tickets. The end is not yet though
in case the money comes that has
been asked for by the bureau chiefs and
for which a bill has been reported to Con
gress. If it passes through so as to be
come immediately available the tide will
be turned and many of the men returned
to work.
The two monitors, the Monadnock and
Coruanche, left the yard Saturday, the for
mer under steam and the latter under tow
of the tug Governor Markham to San Fran
cisco, where, for the time being, she is to be
in the Day off San Francisco for use by the
naval reserves. She canies no ammuni
tion and but one or two shots and shells
for exhibition purposes.
The Monadnock will go down to San
Diego, there to be exhibited as an object
lesson of the skill displayed by Mare Island
mechanics. It can be asserted without
contradiction that in the instance of the
Monadnock she is the first war vessel built
by contract or by the Government known
to have been constructed and placed in
commission on the 23d of one month and
on the 14th of the following month pro
ceeded to sea on a voyage.
The two hulks, the Swatara and Pensa-
{ ical*. are awaiting final dismantling before
appraisal and disposal. As soon as a
few hundred dollars can be secured by
construction for the dockage of the Pensa
cola she will be taken in, her propeller
removed and a large hole cut in her decks
to allow the removal of her boilers and en
gines. The steam engineering department
has funds awaiting use in the removal of
the machinery.
Since the two above-named ships have
been lying in Rotten Row nearly $100,000
has been expended in their care and
preservation, and now they will be sold
for a good many thousand dollars less than
a quarter of that amount.
The Baltimore requires, in addition to
repairs to her machinery, new decks,
much of her electrical gear replaced, and
the |50,000 asked for will but about half
go round the work required.
The Ranger, lying in the stream, will
be converted into a modern cruiser, as
nearly as possible, and supplied with a
modern armament. The $50,000 asked for
her will not be near enough, and the
$5000 for the Mohican and $10,000 lor the
Bennington will haidly be enough for
present requirements.
The Bennington is looked for by Mon
day or Tuesday at the latest. She will be
repaired. Following her comes the Con
cord and Petrel from the Asiatic station.
They will each go out of commission, to
remain until new appropriations are forth
coming.
Anchors and chains are being sent from
the yard down to the battle-ship Oregon.
Each one of the links in the chain being
sent down weighs sixty-two pounds and
the chains when shackled together will be
hundreds of yards long. The anchors are
immense, heavy navy affairs and capable
of holding the Oregon without fear of
dragging or parting.
In the sailloft a number of men are em
ployed on work for the Oregon and ships
in the Asiatic station, and a track is being
laid in front of the anchor park to allow
the locomotive to run cars for the trans
portation of anchors.
All who are now employed in clerical
positions are required to take the oath of
allegiance before they can draw pay from
the Government at Mare Island. Appoint
ments are almost continually being made
at the yard, and for places never here
tofore known of, and now that the ships
are away, and as soon as the accounts are
cleared up, it is feared a reduction in the
force will be made among those who are
not provided for in the yearly allowance of
appropriations.
A leading official at the navy-yard, in
response to a question propounded, in an
emphat'c manner answered : "Yes, by all
means, Congress should recognize Cuba
as an independent republic. 'During our
own war it did not take near so long for
foreign powers to recognize the Southern
Confederacy. It is high time something
should be done toward recognizing those
striving lor their liberty, and their actions
vdll be backed up by every officer and man
of the United State army and navy. By
all means recognize Cuba."
SOS Oil A COUNTY TEACHERS.
They Will Hold Their JVea-t Institute at
the Town of Sonoma.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 15.-The
next Teachers' Institute in this county
will be held at Sonoma. For some weeks
the fight to secure the institute has been
between Sonoma and Healdsburg. Delega.
tions from both places have besieged the
Board of Education several times. In
ducements, both social and financial, have
been offered the teachers, and a great
rivalry nas sprung up between the towns. |
When the board met to-day both towns j
were well represented, and the respective
meritÃof the"two places were eloquently
oet forth. Although Healdsburg made a ]
gallant fight, the claims of Sonoma found
the most favor with the board, who
unanimously decided in favor of the latter
place.
"CAXTI'S LIBBT PRISOS,"
What McCarty Call* the Pen Where Bit
Horses Died.
MODESTO, Cal., March 15.â "White
Hat" McCarty says he will return to San
Francisco to-morrow, but will be in Mo
desto for his preliminary hearing for fail
ing to provide proper sustenance for his
horses before the court next Friday.
Yesterday he counted forty-one dead
animals, and believes there are at least
eighty dead in the brush where he can't
find them yet. Daisy S, mother of Little
Bob, Messitent and Phyllis succumbed
yesterday. McCarty will hoist Crescent to
her feet to try and save her.
In the bunch were seven head belonging
to Rev. Father Powers of San Francisco,
valued at $7000, one of which died. Father
Powers, hearing of their condition, had
them moved on to better feed. One had
starved." Dr. Ruggles also removed one
mare belonging to him.
McCarty appears anxious to have his
examination over. He says he will begin
suit against Canty immediately, and be
lieves criminal as well as civil proceedings
should be begun against Canty. In his
opinion $50,000 would not cover the injury
received by him and his horses and put
them in their previous condition. He will
have subpenas issued immediately for San
Francisco witnesses in the case. He says
W. W. Menenhall, John Garrity and a son
of Assemblyman Richards heard the agree
ment between Canty and him, when Canty
said the stock could have plenty of feed
and could run on the river frontage for
fifteen miles. McCarty calls the sandlot
where most horses died "Canty's Libby
Prison." __^^______^_

was placed the following objects: A piece
of human flesh containing a conical bul
let, a triangular-shaped piece of glaÂ«s. a
steel scalpel, three coins (gold, silver and
nickel), a compass in a morocco case, a
percussion hammer made of hard rubber
ana steel and a lead pencil. The photo
graph that was printed from this negative
is a very interesting study. The piece of
human flesh shows very faintly, trat the
bullet is clearly revealed as a dark object.

Suit to Foreclose a $12,000 Mortgage on
It* Building.
SAN JOSE Cal., March 15.â Otis M.
Tupper has commenced suit in the Superior
Court to foreclose a $12,000 mortgage on
the Young Men's Christian Association
building in this city. The mortgage was
given to secure a note executed April 5,
1892, and there is now $3189 75 interest due
upon the note. The association has been
in financial straits for some time, and in
all probability the building will pass into
the hands of the morgagor. A sbort time
ago efforts to raise a fund of $20,000 to pay
off the association's indebtedness proved
unsuccessful.
SUIT JFOJt DIVORCE.
Eva L. Pratt Deairea Â« Separation From
Oeorge Pratt.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 15.â The testi
mony taken in the suit of Eva L. Pratt for
divorce from George Pratt on the ground
of desertion has been filed by Court Com
missioner Montgomery. The couple were
married in Los Gatoa in 1893 and lived to
gether nearly two years. About a year
ago Pratt deserted his wife, and is now in
the southern part of the State. The evi
dence showed that Pratt was both idle and
profligate. There are no children and
there is no community property to wrangle
over.
SEATTLE SIS A MEN RESTLESS.
Prospects of Another Strike of Union
Sailors.
SEATTLE, >Vash., March 15.â The old
fight between the union sailors and the
Shipowners' Association of this port is on
again, and it is claimed will soon termi
nate in the sailors going ashore on strike.
They say they are only awaiting orders to
walk out from headquarters of the sailors'
association in San Francisco. The ship
owners, through Captain L. M. Garrison,
their agent, declare they will not accede to
the demand for an increase in wages, and
the captain asserts that it will be no
trouble to ship all the non-union men de
sired. Union seamen claim this will not
be so easily done, because of so many sail
ors having gone to the canneries on fishing
trips and to Alaska.

stations and commence his work.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 1896.
AN ENGLISHMAN
BADLY BUNKOED.
Bought a Job in Southern
California to Learn
Fruit-Growing.
COST HIM TEX FOUNDS
And Thousands of Miles of
Travel Only to Find Him
self Tricked.
A BOGUS BUREAU IN LONDON,
Which Is Sending Many Dupes to
the United States and
Canada.
SANTA ANA, Cal., March 15.âSo
journing at present in Santa Ana is a
young Englishman who has been made
the victim of a most barefaced fraud. The
F. S. Meggltt, the Young Englishman Victimized by an Alleged Labor Bureau.
[From a photograph.]
young man's name is F. S. Meggitt, and his
home i 3 at Mansfield, in the north of Eng
land. Meggitt's father died some years
ago, leaving a comfortable estate to be en
joyed by his wife during her lifetime,
while his two sons have been supplied
with modest annuities.
The hero of this sketch was ambitious
to become a master sailor, but after three
years of service, upon attempting to pass
the regular examination, he found that
his defective eyesight was a bar to suc
cess in that noble calling. But during
this three years on the seas he had visited
the Pacific Coast, and after the disappoint
ment of his failure at the examination had
worn off somewhat, Meggitt concluded
that iHie could not make his mark in the
maitttme service he would do the next
best thing and become a fruit farmer in
Southern California.
Hia mother assented readily to the
proposition, and so it was concluded that
young Meggitt should go to California and
learn the fruit-growing business, when,
becoming proficient in that industry, his
mother would also embark for the land of
the setting sun, buy a fruit ranch, and all
would be exceedingly well.
About the time these conclusions were
reached the following advertisement in the
London Telegraph caught the eye of
young Meggitt:
Situations FrimsHEDâ On fruit farms in
Southern California. Best of reterences fur
nished. Correspondence solicited.
C. H. Willmax,
413 Cockspur street.
WiUman's ad was hailed with delight
by the prospective fruit-grower. A brisk
correspondence was established, which re
sulted in Â£10 being shifted from Meggitt
to Willman, in consideration of a guaran
teed situation with T. P. Thompson, a
prominent fruit-grower of Al ham bra, Los
Angeles County, Southern California.
This situation was not represented to
be a lucrative one ; Meggitt had not asked
for such. He was merely to work a year
for his board and what stray bits of infor
mation he could pick up about the fruit
business. Still he was satisfied and paid
his Â£10 without a murmur.
Not long ago Metrgitt arrived in Alham
bra armed with his letter of introduction
to T. P. Thompson, fruit-grower, and
filled with a consuming passion to work
twenty-four hours a day at the fruit busi
ness, pausing only long enough to receive
his salaryâ the afcresaid board.
To his chagrin and alarm, Mr. Thomp
son was unknown at Alhambra. Among
the names of the fruit-growers of that sec
tion that of T. P. Thompson was and al
ways had been missing. It therefore
dawned upon Meggitt that he had fallen
the victim of a new-style shell game, and
with drooping spirits, but yearning still to
learn the fruit business, he finally came to
Santa Ana. He wrote to his mother and
brother of the dismal denouement of hia
long journey, and the latter promptly en
deavored to find the wily Willman, but
Cockepur street knew him no more.
Whether this is to become an estab
lished business in London will, of course,
remain to be seen, although a number of
instances of the same character have been
reported from different sections of the
United States and Canada. Meggitt
doesn't mind the loss of his $50 so much as
the fact that he has not yet found a job for
his board. He will remain in California
at any rate until the eood ship Drumcliffa
at rives from Liverpool, some six months
hence, when he expects to embark with
Captain Davis, an old friend of his, in a
voyage home. He says the next man who
collects a fee from him for a situation on a
Southern California fruit ranch will have
to show some exceptional references in
deed. _____________

LOS AXOELES THRIFT.
Steps Taken to Organize a Mining Stock
Exchange.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 15.â Steps
have been taken here for the organization
of a mining stock exchange, which is con
sidered a long-felt want. Colonel H. M.
Russell, a prominent mine owner, pre
sided over a meeting at which plans were
discussed and the following gentlemen
appointed a committee on permanent
organization : P. L. Griffin, A. H. Judson,
George W. Parsons, Dr. S. H. Bryant, F.
C. Garbutt and James H. Hurid. The
committee will report at the adjourned
meeting next Saturday evening. Such an
organization, it is believed, will be a great
benefit to the rich mining district of
Southern and Lower California, of which
Los Angeles is the center.
LOS A>OELES HEBREWS.
They Lay the Cornerstone of a Magnifi
cent Synagogue.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 15.â The
cornerstone of the new synagogue of the
congregation B'nai B'rith was laid this
afternoon with impo3ing ceremonies. The
old house of worship on Broadway, near
Second street, became valuable as a busi
ness property and sold for a large sum two
years ago. Since then the congregation
has been without a home, but a lot corner
of Ninth and Hope streets was purchased
where a temple costing $40,000 ia now be
ing erected. When completed it will be
the finest Jewish church west of the Rocky
Mountains exceptine the Emanu-EI syna
gogue at San Francisco. The walls will be
of Brick and sandstone, handsomely shaped
architecturally, and the inside will be fur-
nished in an elaborate manner with all
modern improvements.
Harris Newmark was master of cer
emonies at the cornerstone laying. Her
man W. Hellnaan, the president, delivered
an address giving the history of the con
gregation since its organization in 1669.
Rev. M. G. Solomon, the officiating rabbi,
offered prayer and delivered an address on
the progress of Judaism. H. W. Frank,
the treasurer, then deposited the custom
ary articles in a niche prepared for the
preservation of relics, after which Presi
dent Hellman laid the stone and sealed it
with a silver trowel presented for the pur
pose. Rev. A. W. Edelman, the pioneer
rabbi of the congregation, made aome ap
propriate remarks, the choir sang a hymn
and Rabbi Solomon closed the services
with prayer.

THAT FOUR-HANDED DUEL
The Two Survivors of the Fight
on the Desert Taken to
Riverside.
A Rich Mining Discovery Caused the
Tragedy â Story of the
Nicholsons.
RIVERSIDE, Cal.. March 15.âConsta
ble H. M. Carpenter of Banning arrived
in this city to-day with J. J. and P. R.
Nicholson, the men who engaged in a fight
on the desert with James Roop and R.
Conover which ended in the killing of the
two last named. Both the prisoners are
now in the county jail.
The evidence taken at the inquest held
at Banning yesterday was supplied by the
Nicholsons themselves. Their story, as
told to the Coroner's jury, fixes all the
blame for the trouble upon Roop and
Conover and especially upon the former.
According to the story of the Nicholsons,
J. J. Nicholson had made a rich discovery,
and because he had neglected to take
Roop in on the claim, the latter was wroth
and at once started the trouble.
Roop bragged that he had had trouble
before and tliat he was not averse to more,
as the opportunities were good to get out
of the country. Roop thereupon picked
! up a gun and shot P. R. Nicholson, Cono
ver assaulting him with a pickhandle at
the same time. Nicholson called to his
brother to assist him, and the latter then
tired the two fatal shots. J. J. Nicholson,
who did the killing, then carried the
corpses of his victims into the cabin and
| afterward started for Banning with his
wounded brother.
P. R. Nicholson has a badly wounded
arm, a ballet from Roop's rifle entering
near the hand and making an exit near
the elbow.
The Nicholsons are Canadians, and
J. J., who did the shooting, is little more
than a boy, being but 22 years of age.
The men are cool, and claim to regret the
shooting, which, however, they insist was
done in self-defense.
The Nicholsons will be taken back to
Banning to-morrow for preliminary ex
amination. Tne men are charged' with
murder, but they being the only witnesses
to the affray it is not probable that a con
viction will ever be had.

SAUSALITO SENDS OFFICERS.
When the Crowd Left at Night
Many Articles Were
Missing.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 15.â A
gang of toughs from San Francisco spent
Sunday in Mill Valley, and managed to
create more excitement than has been seen
in this place for some time. Among the
crowd were many girls employed in the
laundries of the City. On the trip to Mill
Valley a window in one of the cars was
broken, and when the gang alighted at
Mill Valley it was seen that the police pro
tection here was not sufficient to keep the
picnickers under control if they attempted
to do any damage, and Constable Garrity
of Sausalito was telephoned to ana sent
five deputies to Mill Valley, besides coming
himself.
The touehs had plenty of beer and
whisky, and their noise and confusion de
layed the services in the church. In the
afternoon many of the men got drunk and
a couple of rights started, but were soon
stooped by the officers. One policeman
came all the way from the City with the
crowd.
At the picnic grounds in Mill Valley a
big swing was broken, and one drunken
fellow fell into the icebox.
All the afternoon the revelry was kept
np, and the lar^e force of deputies was
kept on the watch. When the crowd left
to-night they walked off with a number of
articles, among them being a clock belong
ing to Fred Schluter.
The people of Mill Valley are going to
take steps to prevent any more such
crowds coming here, for the residents are
highly indignant that anything of this
nature should have occurred.
The big force of deputies saw the toughs
out of the valley and on their way to San
Francisco before they let them out of their
sight.

MERCED, Cal., March 15.â A woman of
the town known as Emma Hayes attempted
to commit suicide this evening by shooting
herself. The ball struck a rib above her
heart and came out about four inches from
the starting point, making an ugly wound.
The pistol was so close as to set her clothes
on fire. Dr. O'Brien was immediately
called and attended the woman and pro
nounced the wound not dangerous. The
cause of the attempt at suicide was the re
port coming to the girl that her lover, a
cook in a restaurant here, was about to
leave for another town. The would-be
suicide came to Merced from Madera about
two months ago.

NEVADA CITY. Cal., March 15.â
Nevada City, the county Beat of Nevada
County, is the second city of importance
in the mining district, and it has been en
joying an era of renewed prosperity of late
years. This place is situated on hills,
without a level street, yet being so located
possesses a picturesqueness that is notice
able by all visitors and gives many oppor
tunities for sight-seeing.
Nevada City was first located in 1849,
but did not "take its present name until
ISSO, when the first election was held. It
was a most important city in early days,
at one time ranking third in the State of
California as to population. It has passed
through many vicissitudes, having been
wiped out by fire on several occasions.
Its interests are, like those of its sister
city, Grass Valley, centered in the pursuit
of gold mining, and some of the best paying
and deeppst gold mines in California are
here situated. The most notable mine is
probably the Providence, which has been
reopened lately and pays handsomely.
The Champion is also a good example of
â what persistency will accomplish. After
having been worked by assessments for
twenty-six years it is now on the road to
success and its stockholders are reaping
the reward of untiring energy. It was re
cently bonded to a French syndicate for |
$1,250,000. After the bond was signed the '
owners were sorry for their action, and it
was their earnest wish that the bond
would not be taken. It is to-day erecting
a new mill and its prospects are bright for
years to come.
The Mayflower is another mine that is
coming to the front, having been in a stage
of development for years, but now it will
enrich its owners rapidly.
Among other promising properties are
the Mountaineer, Mount George, North
Banner, Spanish, Home, Cadmus, Reward
and Federal Loan, in a number of which
San Fraucisco capitalists are interested.
Gravel mining aiso receives attention in
Nevada City, although quartz mining is
paramount. Among the important gravel
mines are the Manzanita, Odiu and Har
mony.
Nevada City is the terminus of the Ne
vada County Narrow-gauge Railroad,
about twenty-two miles from Colfax. It is
the distributing center for the Ridge dis
trict, where formerly hydraulic mining
was running full blast, and at which time
Nevada City was full of bustle and excite
ment. Sierra County travel and freight
also go by way of Nevada City, and all
the stage companies have their headquar
ters here.
To-day the city numbers about 6000 in
habitants, and not a vacant residence can
be seen. The people are prosperous and
confine their trade vo the home merchants,
and it can truly be said, without fear of
contradiction, there is no more ioyal citi
zens to home interests to be found any
where. The people always present a
united front on matters of public interest.
At a recent election the citizens voted to
bond the city for $60,000 to secure water
worKs, and in a short time the munici
pality will own its water system. Taxes
are reasonable and the affairs of the city
are economically managed Dy the board
of five Trustees.
Its schools are up to the standard re
quired by the State University to be ac
credited schools, and its corps of teachers
are efficent and attentive to their duties.
The city is well provided with electricity
and gas, two separate electric light com
panies being in the field. The streets are
well kept, and the appearance of the city
always strikes a visitor as healthful and
clean. One fact of which Nevada City is
proud is the excellence of its hotels and
the substantial manner in which its busi
ness streets are built.
Of course a great deal of this depends on
the public spirit displayed by the citizens.
Of these Hon. E. M. Preston is of tbe
front rank. He holds the position of presi
dent of the Citizens' Bank, a solid institu
tion, and has been honored by being
elected to the State Senate, and was author
of the bill creating the Preston School of
Industry at lone. He is at present grand
master of the Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons of the State of Califor
nia and a citizen whose integrity is never
questioned, a gentleman whom it is a
pleasure to meet.
Young men are here accorded every op
portunity to display their talents, and in
that regard Leonard S. Calkins, the retir
ing Postmaster, is a bright example. Be
ing bred and reared in journalism, he is a
close student of human nature and is
always cheerful and agreeable. He is
prominently mentioned as a candidate on
the-Repubhcan ticket for State Senator at
the coming fall election.
Nevada City being the county seat, it is
here where most of the officials reside.
The present Sheriff, David F. Douglass, is
a young man who has fully sustained the
trust placed in him by the people, and is
to-day more popular than ever.
John J. Greany, the County Clerk, is
serving his third term. He hails from
Grass Valley, but Nevada County in gen
eral claims him, and a more courteous and
capable official it would be hard to find.
William J. Rogers is the efficient super-
intendent of schools. He is a polished
gentleman, well versed in educational
work. He is a member of many fraternal
societies and is a Knight Templar of high
standing.
Nevada City's early history is early
State history. Many of her citizens have
received honors from the people of the
State and Nation, and they have always
.reflected credit on the State. Her paat
history will always be recalled as long as
pioneers of this Golden State survive, and
then their children will retell events and
occurrences that have made the place
famous. Present prospects are bright,
the future will bring forth much more to
be recorded in history, and her mines will
still keep replenishing the treasure vaults
of this State.
Nevada City to-day stands as an ex
ample of an early settlement changed to a
modern city.

The battery of the battle-ship Oregon is
practically in position. The 13-inch guns
of the after turret were swung into place a
few days ago, and workmen are now busy
in completing interior equipment and ad
justment. On April 26 the ship will g 0 to
Hunters Point dock and remain there
perhaps a week to make preparations for
tne trial trip on the Santa Barbara chan
nel course.
As the Oregon and the Indiana are sis
ter ships, each carrying guns the same
number and caliber, and similarly
mounted, the gun trials which have re
cently taken place on the Indiana will be
studied witn special interest in like experi
ments with the battery of the Oregon.

diana the board of officers found it unsafe
to fire over the 13-inch turrets, or to train
the 8-inch guns nearer than ten degrees to
the turrets. An officer in the turrets dis
tinctly noticed the powerful increase of
the blast as the trainings came close to the
ten-degree limit. *
The "turrets of the Indiana worked
smoothly and with precision. The 13
--inch guns are not more than six feet above
the deck, but they were fired on the keel
line without injury to the deck.
The Indiana made a circle within three
lengths of the ship. The same test will be
applied to the Oregon during the trial ex
periments, which may take place early in
May.
There has been a vast deal of Eastern
newspaper and magazine illustration of
the Indiana and lowa receutly; yet the
fact is that the Oregon is the equal in size,
equipment, armor and armament of either.
The record of the Oregon for speed and sea
going qualities will be awaited with keen
interest.
The Bureau of Ordnance at Washington
has directed the California Powder Works
and the Dupont Powder Company to sup
ply smokeless powder for the 13-inch guns
for the new battle-ships. Recent experi
ments made with CaJifornia powder at
Fort Point must have been successful in
securing the initial velocity of 2100 feet
per second within the prescribed pressure
of recoil.

JUNTA MEN ARE JUBILANT
They Will Place Their Delegates
on the Roll of the State
Convention.
WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAY.
They Charge That Governor Budd Is
Interfering in San Francisco
Politics.
The talk in political circles yesterday
was the temporary victory of the Junta.
Gavin McNab and his followers were elated
and on the curbstones and the street Cor
ners prophesied loudly that the opposition
had fallen to pieces, and that an era of
desertions from the regulars would speed
ily begin.
Mr. McNab talked freely about the out
come of Saturday's meeting, and said that
the effect of the adoption of his resolution
would be to place the Junta's 161 delegates
from San Francisco on the roll of the State
convention. They would then be entitled
to vote on tne election of temporary offi
cers of the convention, and the chairman
pro tern, would be bound to appoint a
committee on credentials favorable to the
Junta's delegates.
"The election of temporary chairman
will settle the whole business," said Mr.
McNab yesterday. "It does not happen
once in a thousand times that the tem
porary chairman is defeated for the per
manent chairmanship. The Buckley crowd
won't have the slightest show of getting
in. They have no strength whatever from
the country, and this fact was proved by
the vote in yesterday's committee meet
ing, only six country" members voting for
the Buckleyites."
Mr. McNab prew facetious at the ex
pense of M. J. Donovan.
"His sickness was caused by indigestion
and pickles. The biegest contract he
ever Had in his life was the one he took to
paint Buckley's reputation white."
Mr. McNab* was asked whether it was
usual for the State Central Committee to
interfere with the local organizations, and
whether that committee had any author
ity to do 80. He replied that such was the
fact and that the State Central Committee
had exercised that prerogative four years
ago. The committee had a right to recoe
nize what it believed to bo the legal Demo
cratic organization of the City and County
of San Francisco. The State Convention
would admit 161 delegates of the Junta
who would vote for the officers pro tern.,
and having thus aided in the secction of
those officers no power could put them
out because the Buckley representatives
would have neither voice nor vote in the
convention.
The question was put as to whether the
Junta would have open primaries or
whether only those on thÃ club rolls of the
Junta would be allowed to vote. Mr. Mc-
Nab replied that that was a matter for the
committee to determine, and that he could
not speak for the committee. He made a
reply of similar import to the question as
to whether the club rolls would be re
opened for additional members.
Isador Alexander of the Sacramento del
egation Baid that he and his colleagues
voted with the Junta because they saw
that the Junta had the upper hand. The
Sacramentans were chiefly interested in
getting the State convention in their city,
and they therefore voted with the bisger
crowd.
"The names of the Junta's 161 delegates
will be placed on the roll of the State con
vention and they will be entitled to vote
for the temoorary officers of the conven
tion," added* Mr. Alexander.
Mr. Alexander was asked as to whether
the State Central Committee interfered in
the faction fight between the rival Demo
cratic organizations of Sacramento County,
the reorganized and the regulars, and he
replied that the State Central Committee
bad referred the matter to the State con
vention. Both delegations were kept off
the roll, but the committee on credentials
by a vote of 14 to 1 recognized the reor
ganized wing, notwithstanding the fact
that it had nominated a Republican for
Mayor.
Mr. Alexander is an appointee of Gov
ernor Budd and holds down a fat berth in
one of the fat State commissions.
The regular Democracy ascribe their de
feat to the machinations of Governor
Budd. They say that he has been doing
and attempting to do politics in San Fran
cisco ever since his inauguration and they
speak of him with the most breezy disre
spect. They insisi that he stands behind
Gavin McNab and pats that braw Scot on
the back, the Governors intention being,
they say, to obtain control of the Demo
cratic organizations throughout the State
in furtherance of his political ambition.
They point in proof of their statements to
the proxies held by the Junta at Satur
day's meeting.
The proxies held by Mr. McNab were
eight in number, namely: R. P. Troy, at
large; A. F. Nelson of Humboldt, J. E.
Parker of Modoc, A. L. Shinn of Lassen, G.
J. Carpenter of El Dorado, T. C. Hogan of
Santa Clara, F. J. Cross of Tuolumne and
A. E. Cochran of San Diego.
P. J. Shields of Sacramento, a deputy in
the State Librarian's office, held three
proxies and voted them. He is a partisan
of Governor Budd. John Markley, who
owes his position as Secretary of the State
Board of Examiners, is an appointee of
Governor Bodd and voted three proxies.
The other proxy-holders were: C. L. La
Rue, 1: John W. Mitchell, 1; J. A. Fenton,
1; J. W. Ferguson, 1; C. B. Stone. 1; J. D.
Coughlin, 1; R. B. Terry, 1; G. R. B. Hayes,
1; J. H. O'Brien, 1: Joseph Rothschild, 1!
M. J. Donovan, 1; F. H. Gould, 2; W. W.
Foote. 1; M. J. Laymance, 1, and W. A.
Murphy, 1; W. K. Prather, 1; J.W. Odtes,
1: W. M. Gibson, 1.
The Occidental Club was in a state of
indignation yesterday. The two promi
nent events of the meeting were what
they termed the bulldozing tactics of
Chairman Gould and the McNab resolu
tion. The opinion was generally ex
pressed that the regulars should have left
the hall as soon as Chairman Gould had
Violated parliamentary law by cutting off
Joseph Rothschild while he was yet oc
cupying the floor. They said' that if this
had been done the effect upon the country
delegates in the State convention would
hayÂ« been better.
W. H. Harrison, Chris Buckley's nephew,
was as non-committal regarding the future
tactics of the regulars as he was out
spoken in his denunciations of McNab,
Governor Budd and the Junta.
'â¢'What is Jim Budd after?" he inquired
fiercely. "Does he want to be United
States Senator?"
Mr. Harrison expressed the opinion very
forcibly to the effrct that Judge J. F. Sul
livan and M. C. Hassett were being used
by the Junta as figureheads for ths cap
ture oi their following.
"Hassett lied when he denied that he
went over to Livermore to see Chris Buck
ley. He did go there to get Chris for Hin
ton. Hassett was to be Hinton's attorney.
Jim Budd 13 no good and Gould is no
better."
Mr. Harrison added that the regular
Democracy wouid pursue tne even tenor of
their way and would send delegates to the
State convention. He insisted that the
country would give the regulars hearing
in the State convention, and he added that
twenty-three country delegates had walked
out of the hall disgusted with the bulldoz
ing methods of Chairman Gould.
A LIBEEALISrs VIEWS.
Dr. J. Li. York Discusses Open Questions
and the Soul of Things.
Dr. J. L. York, the liberal orator, deliv
ered an interesting address to a large audi
ence in Scottish Hall. His subject was
"Open Questions" and "The Boul of
Things." In speaking upon the first prop
osition he denned the attitude of the true
liberal to all beliefs, saying that he does
not place any limit upon possibilities in
nature.
The liberal analyzes all beliefs and dis
cards those that science proves to be with
out foundation. Spiritualism, theosopny,
reincarnation or resurrection are all open
functions that fare not to be lightly laid
aside as nonsense until they are proved to
be such.
The law of evolution proves that man
has progressed upward through many
forms and changes, and it stands to reason
that he has not yet reached his perfection,
but will continue to live after the change
called death in a condition one or more
rounds up on the ladder of progress.
In explaining the process of evolution in
natural and living things. Dr. York
brought out the point in the second part of
his subject, "The Soul of Things." holding
that all matter has life, and said, "If we
search for death in matter, we find only
change and resurrection in another form
of life. If we search for life in matter, we
only find change, modification and trans
formation, and life and death are one, and
simply means change."
In conclusion Dr. York spoke of the
mission of liberalism. It is to produce
rational views of human life, liberty and
happiness; to war against religious super
stition in all forms and to teach the gospel
of science, nature and true reforms ; to
keep the church and state separate and
keep religion out of politics and out of our
schools; to keep the national flag floating
over the schoolhouses and to promote
good government, honesty, liberty, justice,
fraternity and a true moral life among the
people. _____________
i GRANT AND BUOZNEE.
A Memorable Incident of Lee's Ca
pitulation.
It is one of the remarkable matters about
Grant that many of the men who were his
most tireless and intrepid foemen during
the war were his best friends after. There
were Mosby, Longstreet, old Simon Buck
ner and scores of others. Grant captured
Buckner twice, once at Done lson and again
at Appomattox, after battles which in no
sense resembled the play^of children ; and
yet no sadder heart attended to bear the
pall of the great soldier of the North, no
tears fell faster above him as he went to
his lone rest than General Buckner's.
Probably the most sincerely American
incident of the whole bad bungle of a war
occurred at Lee's surrender; or within a
few minutes next following it. No sooner
were the formalities of Lee's capitulation
over than Grant in his ingenuous, single
hearted wayâ they had known each other
since an olden day at West Pointâ took
Buckner one side and inquired into his
finances and money needs. Grant wanted
to lend him whatever his exigencies called
for. That was a spectacle essentially
American, and Grant was never greater
than when utterly forgetting what might
be called "the set of the stage," he was
trying to lend an old comradeâ in arms
against the day before, surrendered to him
only ten minutes beforeâ money enough
to put him out of care and take him home.
And the best part of it was that Buckner
borrowed like a true American and repaid
every stiver like an hone*st man.âWashing

STORIES OF THE STREETS
Mgr. Nugent's Work Among the
Waifs and Strays of
England.
SKETCHES OF LONDON LIFE.
Father Crowley Tells of the Chari
table Enterprises Which the
Monsignor Manages.
"Monsignor Nugent is one of the best
known as well as one of the most popular
men in all England." The speaker was
Rev. Father Crowley, director of the
Youths' Directory at 2030 Howard street.
He was telling of the great charitable
work which the monsignor, now at Los
Angeles and soon to visit San Francisco,
has for years carried on in Liverpool.
"When the Archbishop and I were in
England last year," continued Father
Crowley, "We visited Monsignor Nugent
at Liverpool. And really he is a wonder
ful little man. Though 75 years of age, he
is still very active and attends personally
to the management of the large charitable
enterprises which he carries on in Eng-

Him a World-Wide Fame.

land. He has been engaged in this work
for many years and his name is known
throughout the world. He built and has
for years maintained a home for newsboys,
waifs and strays in the city of Liverpool.
It is not unlike our Youths' Directory, but,
of course, on a larger and more magnrfi
cent scale. He is now building a home for
unfortunate women in Liverpool. His
charitable enterprise is simply boundless.
"Monsignor Nugent was for many years
chaplain to the penitentiary, but is now
retired. In recognition of his splendid
services he was given a pension for life by
the British Government. He is a strong
believer in temperance, especially because
his long years of labor among the poor,
distressed and fallen have impressed him
with the truth that drink has caused the
greater part of all the poverty and ruin."
During his stay in dan Francisco Mon
signor Nugent will be the guest of the Arch
bishop. He is now on a visit to the Bishop
of Los Angeles. This is not his first visit
to the United States, though he has never
been in California before. He crossed the
Atlantic some twenty years ago and made
a tour of the Eastern States.
Father Crowley received a letter from
Mousignor Nugent a few days ago. It
was in response to an invitation to deliver
a lecture on his favored theme, "The
Waifs and Strays, or Pictures of Street
Life in England," while in San Francisco.
The monsignor will probably accept the
invitation. In speaking of his lecture an
English publication say 3:
"Few living men have had more experi
ence among the struggling classes. A
long, active and sympathetic life has been
sptnt among the poot, and one of his
chief aims has been to rescue youth of
both sexes from the dangers of street life
by giving them industrial training. The
story of the 'Waifs and Strays, or No
body's Children.' is not the usual dry
lecture, but a masterly picture of the
struggles of those who pick up their bread
on the streets as best they can, drawn to
lite and told so true to nature, in speech
and manner, that you imagine these gam
ins before you exercising their various
callings. His characters of the London
bootblack, infant acrobat and trapeze per
former, child ballad singer, sidewalk
artist, dramatic troupe and outdoor vocal
and instrumental company, are so real
istic that you almost see before you the
living pictures. This story of the 'Waifs
and Strays' is equal in language and
dramatic pathos to some of Dickens' best
sketches of London life among the poor."
OLDEST AOTOR ON THE STAGE.
Mr. HowÂ© of Irvine's Company Tells
a Story of Keaii.
"Yes, it is true I am the oldest actor on
the stage," said Henry H. Howe of Sir
Henry Irving's company.
One can readily believe it, for Mr.
Howe's hair is snowy, but it is luxuriant,
notwithstanding his years.
A fine old gentleman he isâ full of life
and spirit and tire, notwithstanding his
seventy-six winters and more than half a
century on the stage.
And what reminiscences!
The great Kean, Edmund, advised him
not to think of going on the stage. This
old gentleman was in the original produc
tion of "Richelieu" and "London Assur
ance" ana oh, so many more. He has
played every male part in probabiy ten
plays, among them "The Merchant of
Venice," "Richelieu" and "London As
surance." He was twenty-seven years at
the Haymarket anil was for a long time at
CoventGarden.
"I went to see great Edmund Kean once,
seeking a place in his company," he said.
"It was about 9 o'clock in the morning
when I called the tirst time to see him. I
was informed that he would not be ud for
hours. So I went back the next day at 11
o'clock. He was not up then, nor the next
day at 12, but finally, about the fourth
day, I did get to see him.
"Turning to his manager when I entered
Mr. Kean exclaimed, 'So this Quaker
cockey wants to be an actor?' He had
seen in a moment that I was a Quakpr.
All my people were, but, perhaps. I was
rather a fast young fellow for a" Friend.
Mr. Kean told me not to think of the
stage as a profession. 'Your friends will
all say that you are a vagabond. Give up
the notion.' But I argued against it all.
"Turning on me suddenly he asked
sharply, 'Can you starve, cockey?'
"I replied that I did not exactly un
derstand what he meant and asked him if

food. He answered that he mea.t exactly
that. I remarked tuat starving did not
appear to be a part of the business. He
had before him right then a steaming hot
break ast.
" 'My boy I have gone for six and thirty
hours without food, except a turnip, per
haps, which I found in a Held by the road.
Could you do that?'
"That was true, too. about his starving
in his younger days. It is told of him that
there was one theater on one of the coun
try circuits where he occasionally played
and always to large audiences after be had
made his reputation. Kean wou:d never
speak to the manager of the house, lhe
manager would taue the star's shar<s of the
receipts to him every night and when the
well-known rap came on the door, Kean
would say to his servant, 'See what that
man wants.' Time passed and the once flour
ishing manager lost his house and became
extremely poor. In another town Kean
was playing once when the old manager
applied to Him for a benefit. Kean con
sented and the nieht was fixed. Some
nights previous to its occurrence, he, witn
some of the actors of the company, met at
a tavern in the town. The room was a
public one, where the comedian* an<i many
of the patrons of the theater occasionally
assembled. There, on the occasion in
question, was the old manager. The
jest went round not unaccompanied
by the bowl, of course ; and
the ci-devant manager, thinking ail v
former ill feeling buried, rose, made a
speech alluding to Kean's generosity and
acquainted the company that Kean hav
ing known him in his prosperity had con
sented to play gratuitously for his benefit.
This was received with loud acclamations,
amid which Kean rose (and those who
were present were as little likely to forget
the expression of his countenance at that
moment as in any of his dramatic
understand' one another. I am bound
to you by no tics of former ac
quaintance. I don't play for yotÂ»
because you were once my manager or a
manager. If ever a man deserved his des*
tiny it. is yoi*. If ever there was a family
oi tyrants it is yours. I do not play for
you from former friendship, but I playful!
you because you are a fallen man.' The
effect was electrical, but the person to
whom it was addressed pocketed the af
front and the receipts of the night in ques
tion, which were very great. Kean ex
plained his conduct thusâ l believe I may
say in exactly these words: 'I am sorry
that I forgot myself, but when me and
mine were starving that fellow refused to
let a subscription for me be entertained in
his theater. 1 "âAtlanta Constitution.

Keeps Himself in Hand and
So Controls His Fol
lowers.
DOES NOT FAVOR STRIKES.
Will Give His Attention to the Prob.
lem of Child Labor When the
Strike Is Over.
Robert T. Mclvor, the leader of the
painters' strike, keeps himself well in
hand and so controls his followers.
That is the impression the young labor
agitator makes upon the inquisitive
stranger. The eye wanders from the
slight figure in its neat, gray business
suit, to the youthful face with its keen,
bright eyes and its deferential smile, and
hack asain to the spotless white four-in
hand, and is pleased. He is well but not
offensively groomed. Probably he dresses
with the nice exactness with which he
lays on the final stroke of the brush on a
completed building, and having performed
that office carefully, he is as utterly obliv
ious of his garb the remainder of the day
as though it were of the fabled skir.s of
wild beasts. That is a lesson Robert Mc
lvor can teach some of his financial 'â¢bet
ters."
His features are sharp. Perhaps his an
tagonists might call him hatchet-faced,
but they are strong features, and his large
nose has that curve that reminds us of an
ease's beak. He has reddish hair, mus
tacne and complexion, and eyes that are
brown or blue according to his emotions.
When he talked of the wrongs of the poor
and the need of a remedy for those wrongs
his eyes grew dark and threatening and a
listener could feel the power of the man.
When he waxed diplomatic and said he
did not favor strikes they were keen and
gray, and when he dealt in commonplaces
there were blue lights in them.
There is nothing exceptional about his
appearance. We pass fifty men of his
type on the streets every day. Nothing
exceptional until you watch him in conver
sation or debate. Then, even in panto
mime you recognize the element of leader
ship. There is a quiet force about him
that acts as a magnet to the detached ideas
and theories and plans of others. Such a
man is a loadstone.
He is convincing, though nnimpassioned
in discussion. He never loses sight of the
single purpose in view. Extraneous and
lo him unimportant objections he dis
misses with a miid "I care not a pin far
that," and the objector looks uneasy and
dissatisfied, but cannot take exception to
the even-toned reply. There is something
compellinz even in the low voice and
measured tones of the leader of the
strikers.
He is never needlessly argumentative
nor loquacious. He has confidence in
himself and his cause and inspires it in
his co-laborers. The diplomacy, intelli
gence and force that have won his present
prominence have put him in the front in
other battles between the two powers of
society. Those qualities combined with
his tenacity of purpose will continue to
serve him. He will be a labor leader all
his Jife and will die with his social-reform
U<(ptson.,.; ,_,. ~ .. . . , .. .
He stepped from the hall on Mission
street, where a conference of unionists was
being held, to talk for a few minutes on
novel theme of himself instead of his
cause. A cloud of battle and cigar smoke
and the sound of jarring voices rolled out
after him, but he was in nowise disturbed.
Politeness and a modest disinclination to
talk of self had a short struggle, but the
gentler quality won.
He talked of his Scotch parentago, of his
â¢ coming of a family of painters, of his leav
ing school for work at an early age, of his
residence in Ireland during the home rule
agitation (with which, oung as he was, he
was identified), of his share in the Trafal
gar-square strike for free speech, and of
his aid in preparing the way for the Lon
don dock strike.
"I am always to be found at the radical
end, you may depend upon that," he said,
Bmiling slightly.
There was a call for Mclvor. "Come as
coon as you can," whispered, the messen
ger, and a low-toned colloquy followed.
.Meanwhile the voices in the next room
grew .louder. The chief grew restive for
the fray, and, promising to return when
there was a lull, sought the scene of the
contest. The vocal storm died away and
the calm voice was henrd again stilling the
tempest. Then its owner returned.
He resumed in a methodical way the
Btory that had been interrupted. He
came to this country nine years ago, when
he was a youth of 24. He had worked in
New York, Mexico and San Francisco, al
ways at his trade as painter.
Three months ago he was elected walk-
ing delegate of the Painters' Union. This
was the office of adjuster of claims be
tween employer and employe, an office
that pays $12 a week to reimburse him in
part for the loss of wages sustained by his
attention to its duties.
"Did you precipitate this strike?" was a
question which he skillfully evaded by a
general statement.
"I do not favor strikes except when they
become a necessity. When employers
will pay no attention to the needs of the
employes those employes must be with
drawn" ior a time to create an opportunity
for a conference. I regard a strike in the
light of making an opportunity for an
agreement by relieving the workers for a
brief time. I would regret it if this strike
should extend further; or, yes, if violence
followed. At any rate, if strikes last lone
suffering for the families of the workmen
is sure to follow.
"I believe in settling all differences by
an appeal to the ballot box as arbiter.
Therefore I am in favor of a working
men's party."
The courage of the man showed in his
glowing face as he talked, still in those
even tones, of the wretchedness of poverty.
' We must roaKethe workingman's en
vironments more nearly what they should
be. We must take his children from the
streets and educate them. We must do it
by law.
"The strike will Â§oon be settled, and
satisfactorily so," he said. "After that, I
shall give my attention to child labor,
child education and to allied subjects."
Robert Mcivor is not formidable in
manner at least. He is not of the fire-eater
brand. But he has a forceful personality,
this student of conditions, rather than
books, and when he opened the door of the
conference room and I saw a score of faces
look expectantly toward him, I thought :
'A leader yesterday, to-day and always.

THEY MUST KNOW HOW
Candidates for Public Offices
Should Be Qualified to
.Fill Them.
This Is the Position the State Takes
in the Suit Against Superin
tendent Ashworth.
Henry E. Highton, acting for the State
in the case of the people against Superin
tendent of Streets Ashworth, has presented
a somewhat novel view of the responsi
bilities of an office-holder, but one which
appeals at once to the common-sense of
the average individual.
Mr. Highton, as special counsel associ
ated with District Attorney Barnes, on
Saturday filed nis brief in answer to the
brief of Ash worth's attorneys. In the
opening paragraphs he says:
There is a serious misunderstanding or mis
apprehension as to the nature of public offices.
They are not political rewards. Each incum
bent of such an office is a servant of the State
or municipality with fixed duties, expressed
and implied, and under a contract in which he
and his bondsmen vouch for two propositions:
First, his average or reasonable competency,
and, second, his fidelity.
Apart from any purely moral question, and
without any necessary implication of corrup
tion, the defendant, when he accepted the
office of Superintendent of Public Streets,
Squares and Highways, contracted, first, that
he was fairly qualified to perform and, second,
that he would faithfully perform the duties of
the office, and, if he was incompetent or has
been grossly negligent, he has broken his
agreement and the penalty is removal.
On these points the whole argument of the
demurrer must converge. ,
"This is a position which is supported
by both law and common-sense," said Mr.
Highton in speaking of the matter last
evening and pointing to the long list of
citations of law presented in his brief.
"It is the popular notion," he said, "that
when a man is elected to an office he is be
yond criticism unless he does something
distinctly dishonest ; that his election is the
expression of the voice of the people and
lie can conduct his office as ne sees fit.
That I hold to be a grave mistake and if
my points were more enforced upon the
political parties the public service through
out the country would be vastly improved.
Men in voting for a Superintendent of
Public Street?, for instance, ruay person
ally prefer this man or that man, but they
have a right to expect that all the candi
dates are qualified for the duties of the
office to which they present themselves for
election. If they are not then they com
mit a fraud in accepting it. A man may,
without any intent toward corruption,
bungle bis business ao as to bring great
loss to the peopie.
"In our proposed new charter a system of
civil-service examinations is to ue inau
gurated to test the fitness of applicants for
clerkships in the public service. How
much more important is it that the heads
of departments should be qualified. I
hold that if Mr. Ashworth allowed imper-
feet street work of any kind to be done â
that is, if he knowingly permitted any in
fraction of the specifications whatever â
whether he profited Â£y it or not, he is
guilty as charged and subject to the pen
alty of removal."
The defendant is allowed to reply to the
District Attorney's brief; then Judge
Black will pass upon the demurrer, and,
that being overruled, the case will come to
a speedy trial.
HER CONVERSION.
Hrii Gongar Prepares the Way for a
West Side Woman's Christian
Temperance Union.
"You all know it is my hope thai the
time will come when there will be as
many women as men in the pulpits and
as many women as men at the polls,' 1 said
Rev. W. A. Gardner in introducing Mrs.
Helen M. Gougar to a large audience at
the West Side Christian Church last
evening.
"While the brother was talking I de
cided to use for my text, 'Who knows but
she may nave been raised up fora time
like this,' " said Mrs. Gougar. "I will talk
to you about those magical letters we see
so often in the newspapers and elswhere,
W. C. T. U. Do you Know what those
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 1896.
letters stand for? I will tell you. We are
coming to upset the liquor traffic."
The lady described the genesis of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
which originated in the crusade against
saloons in Ohio twenty-two years ago. "If
the union had accomplished nothing more
in its double decade of life, the work it
has done among the children would more
than reward us for every effort put forth,"
said she. "In all but two States of the
Union temperance instruction in the
schools has been made corrpulsory. Then
there is the Loyal Legion, a children's
band, many thousands strong, whose
motto is. 'Tremble, King Alcohol, we are
growing up." 1
She told the story of 400 men signing the
pledge as the result of temperance meet
ings on a big Atlantic liner, and said : "If I
were a rich man or woman, I would estab
lish a W. C. T. U. superintendent at every
seaport." Mrs. Gougar said: "We have
forty departments of the work. Ours is a
complex system. We work for the child
ren, the men in all trades, and the wome,u
â yes, the fallen women. We have come
to find that a fallen woman is as much
worth saving as a fallen man. We stand
for white living for both sexes. We believe
that a man should be as clean mentally,
morally and physically as the woman he
marries.
"We have made woman suffrage a
branch of work. It was one of the latest
put forth by the parent tree. We were
much inclined to say, 'I have all the rights
I want.' I said it often, and I remember
well the last time I uttered those words I
amended them. I said, 'I have all the
rights I want, but not all the rights I can
make use of.' "
And she told the pathetic story of the
death of her washerwoman at the hands of
a drunken husband.
"I determined then," she said, "that I
would use every power God has given me
to give the death blow to that which
makes such crimes possible â crimes that
are perpetrated, the newspapers tell us,
at the rate of 3400 per annum."
It was arranged at the close of the meet
ing that the ladies of the neighborhood,
irrespective of creed, should meet at the
church at 2:30 p. m. Wednesday to organ
ize a Woman's Christian Temperance
Union. g
The subject of the afternoon's talk was
j a general discussion of the liquor traffic,
the attending evils and the remedy. The
lecturer demonstrated in a clever Way that
rum-selling was the curse of the land, in
that it filled the prisons with convicts,
made husbands' murder their wives, fath
ers Kill their children, and a thousand
other evils almost as bad.
The sovereign remedy for this was the
ballot-box, with the mothers of the land
given the right to vote.
DURRANT TRANQUIL.
A Possibility That the Day of Execu
tion Will Not Happen fop An
other Year.
Theodore Durrant, notwithstanding that
his name and the history of his awful
crimes have been either read of or spoken
of in every section of the globe where the
English language is used, is apparently at
perfect ease in cell 28 at the County Jail,
whÂ«re he is quietly awaiting the result of
his appeal to the Supreme Court for the
murder of Blanche Lamont.
From the wicket of his cell he had a smile
and a pleasant word for the Salvation
Army lasses who visited him yesterday
afternoon.
His eleven months' incarceration has not
told on his constitution. It will be twelve
month? on the 14th of April since Durrant
was arrested in Contra Costa County for the
crime f>f which he has been convicted.
As his case now stands,with the still fur
ther uncertainty of the California penal
law, Durrant will have to see New Year's
day of 1H97. The bill of exceptions, which
will of necessity have to accompany the
appeal in order that the seven wise men
of the Supreme Court may see what, if
any, errors were made by the t-rial Judge,
have not been signed and consequently
have not gone to the Supreme Court.
Until this bill of exceptions is yirepared
and forwarded the Supreme Court can taKe
no action.
Assuming, and in this there ii no cer
tainly, that the bill of exceptions wresent
up now, the case would not, considering
the crowded condition of the calendar 01
the Supreme Court, be set before the July
term.
Assuming: that it should be advanced
ahead of other case* it would not be
readied before August. Then the ninety
days ailowed by the constitution for the
Judges to consider it. Xhia would Driug it
to November. Thirty days after the
decision before the remittiuir would reach
the office of the County Clerk would bring
it into December. Then sixty days would
have to lapse before the date set for carry
ing the execution into effect â thus extend
ing the time for one year from this day and
two years from the time the crime was
committed.
A FOUR-VOLUME LIBRARY.
Wisdom and Information Coi\den&ed for
Those Who Act Promptly.
Many busy men and women have longed
for a ready book of reference, at once an
encyclopedia and a dictionary, an indis
pensable "at one's elbow" servant.
This need is supplied by the Pacific Coast
Newspaper Syndicate, which offers a care
fully prepared work, in four volumes,
under conditions that will commend it to
every discriminating user of books of ref
erence. The Encyclopaedic Dictionary con
tains more than 250,000 defined words â
twice the number in the standard diction
ariesâand is up to date in giving a com
plete definition of the words that progress
has forced into common use. The ori
gin, history, spelling, definition, pro
nunciation and use of every word have
been set forth carefully. Moreover, it
is a comprehensive encyclopedia in all
branches of knowledge, a scientific dic
tionary, making clear terms used in tech
nical articles not familiar to the average
reader, and contains a valuable dictionary
of quotations which embraces the entire
range of Enplish literature. The work,
published in four volumes, is in the most
convenient form for daily use. It repre
sents seventeen years' work by a staff of
editors and specialists of the highest repu
tation, and has been commended by men
whose opinions are "ipse dixits" the world
over.
in introducing: the Encyclopaedic Dic
tionary, its publishers have hit upon a
novel plan. Five hundred sets are offered
upon these terms: One dollar as first
payment, with immediate delivery, of the
four volumes, and monthly payments for
one year of $125. The publishers expect
to make in this manner 500 nuclei of vol
untary advertising for the work. The price
of the dictionary after the 500 introductory
sets have been taken will be from $42 to
$72, according to the style of binding.
It should be borne in mind that this
offer is not confined to San Francisco, but
applies to all sections reached by the great
San Francisco dailies.
FRACTURED HIS SKULL
A Democratic Politician Rendered Un
conscious by a Blow Froni
Charles Gercken.
Over some trivial matter, the particulars
of which are hidden from vulgar eyes, John
Buckley, who resides at 927 Broadway and
who is looted upon as a Democratic leader
in his section of the City, got into a wordy
war with a young man named Charles
Gercken. It occurred on the sidewalk at the
southwest corner of Green and Mason
streets yesterday morning at 10 o'clock.
From words they came to blows, and
Gercken succeeded in getting in the first
blow, which knocked Buckley down. In
the fall his head struck the unsyrupathiz
tng asphaltum sidewalk, rendering him un
conscious, in which condition he remained
all day.
Policeman G. A. Anderson, who lives in
that vicinity, was sent for and removed
Bucklev to the Receiving Hospital. Gercken
was taken into custody later, and is de
tained in prison pending the result of the
injured man's condition.
An examination of the injured man later
in the evening showed that his skull had
been badly fractured, and considering his
advanced age Buckley's chances of recov
ery are regarded as very poor.
Gercken last evening staied to his attor
ney that Buckley was drunk at the time of
the trouble in the saloon. Gercken went
out on the sidewalk, where he was fol
lowed by Buckley. Tue latter struck him.
so Gercken says, and the prisoner claims
that he knocked the old man down in self
defense.

SULLIVAN'S NEW SPREE.
Kept Sober for a Week, Talked
Politics With Chris, and
Then Got Mellow.
He Filled the Baldwin Bar With a
Delighted Crowd Which Envied
His Alcoholic Load.
John L. Sullivan, who had been duly
sober and debonair for a week, got mellow
last evening and made things lively in the
Baldwin Hotel barroom with his husky
roar.
Early in the afternoon he appeared on
the Market-street boulevard as straight as
a string, dressed like a thoroughbred and
with a latest style silk hat whose polish
made the surrounding mirrors darken with
envy. Toward 3 o'clock in the afternoon
Chris Buckley strolled down from the
Occidental Club and stepped into the Bald
win, where he met John L. Sullivan and
Paddy Ryan.
With two or three friends they took
possession of the curtained alcove next the
door, and John L. ordered drinks for all
hands. Then Chris ordered the waiter to
repeat the dose, and Faddy Ryan came in
a good third with the like order.
Chris doesn't get drunk, and he drank
very sparingly. John L. did all the talk
ing, principally on pugilism and National
politics, while Chris proved a patient lis
tener. This lasted for about an hour and
Buckley toos his leave, but John L. kept
the ball rolling and switched from light
wines to whisky.
After dinner "he put on a suit of daik
gray clothing, and walked up to the bar
and husKily roared: "Gimme 'nother
drink!" and invited two or three friends
to join him. Paddy Ryan sat in a chair
against the wail with ii look of disgust on
his face as John L. took whisky at the
speed of two classes to the minute.
The ex-champion was introduced to a
very lightweight jockey, and insisted that
the jockey should drink with him. Then,
placing a hand as plump as a ham on the
little fellow's shoulder, he expressed the
opinion with a whisper like the bark of a
sea-hon that Garrison was the greatest
iockey that ever lived.
Finally Paddy Ryan got out of his chair
and tried to induce the heavy-weight to
leave the room and get away from the
crowd, but Sullivan requested him to go
to the tropics or in that vicinity and let
him alone.
Then an attache of the hotel came in
with "Clear this passageway, gentlemen,"
and the crowd fell back against the wall,
wbile Jonn L., with his left arm around
the jockey's neck, was huskily calling for
" 'nother drink."
When John was finally put to bed, at a
late hour, a quart of bromo-seltzer was
placed on a table within easy reach.
THE THEOSOPHISTB.
Lecture by Dr. Allen Griffiths on Inoc
ulation anil Hypnotism.
The lecture given last evening in Ruby
Hall, Redmen's building, under the au
spices of the Theosophical Society in
America was on "Inoculation and Hyp
notism," delivered by Dr. Allen Griffiths.
The lecturer explained that inoculation
relates to the physical and hypnotism to
the mental plane, and said that the for
mer, while a has a tendency to afiect dis
ease, does not act as a preventive. Disease,
he asserted, has its origin in the mind, or
lower brain,- which is the intellect, and is
produced by the lower passions, such
as anger, envy, a desire for re
venge which cannot be obtained;
that these thoughts affect many
organisms in the body and in that way
produce an unhealthy condition, the re
sult of which is disease. The remedy for
this is cheerfulness and elevating
thoughts.
Hypnotism, he said, is another form of
inoculation. It is one person taking en
tire possession of the mind of another and
making that person his abject slave. He
expressed the opinion that hypnotism is a
mural wrong, and that for one person to
take possession of tho mind of another to
make that individual perform a certain
tiling ought not to be, "for," said the
speaker, "our highest duty is to discbarge
our individual duty, and if we all do that
it will result in greater happiness."
ERIN'S FLAG WILL WAVE
St. Patrick's Day Will Be Ob
served With Music, Song
and Sentiment.
SHAMROCKS FROM IRELAND.
They Come Fresh From Mayo, With
Greetings to the Exiled Celts
in America.
The shamrock of Ireland will hold sway
to-morrow. It will be St. Patrick's day,
and the sons and daughters of Erin in San
Francisco will observe the anniversary of
their apostle with becoming ceremonies.
All arrangements are now complete for the
two big celebrations at the new Wood
ward's pavilion âin the afternoon and
evening. In the morning there will be
masses in all the Catholic churches, and
the day will be relipiously ana patriotic
ally regarded by the Irish people and their
descendants as in days of yore.
The St. Patrick's day convention held its
closing session yesterday. Among the in
teresting incidents of the gathering was
the receipt of a bunch of Irish shamrocks
irom the Sisters of Charity of the County
Mayo, Ballaghadlim, Ireland, sent through
Mrs. A. F. Hunley of Benicia, Cal., to
Hon. J. F. Sullivan, the orator of the day.
The shamrocks, which were presented to
Judge Sullivan, were accompanied by an
illustrated poem of greeting to the Irish in
exile.
Ex-Judge Sullivan was asked to address
the convention. He said that in partici
pating in the celebration of St. Patrick's
day he would discharge his duty as best he
could. He felt that every son of an Irish
man, instead of losing bis identity with the
race, should feel proud that the blood that
coursed through his veins was that of Irish
parentage.
It had become fashionable in this coun
try to belittle the Irish, and it was their
sacred duty to bring to the attention of the
American people the facts as to what those
of Celtic blood had done to build up this
great nation. He applauded the idea of
building a home for the Celtic clubs of San
Francisco, and hoped that a library, con
taining works whicli would tell of the
glory of the race, what it had done for
civilization and for America, would be es
tablished in connection with the hall.
"We sometimes believe tuat every Irish
man is a Catholic," continued Judge Sul
livan, "but we must remember that the
Protestants in Ireland made great sacri
fices for human good, and no man did
more than Robert Emmet, Thomas Davis,
John Mitchel, Charles Stewart Parneil;
no men did more gallant service for their
country. Let us always welcome our non-
Cathohc Irish citizens, for they stood with
us in the great struggles of Ireland for
civil and religious liberty."
John Mulhern, chairman of the commit
tee of arrangements, reported that every
thing had been done to make the celebra
tion (afternoon and evening) on Tuesday
in every way creditable. He felt that the
Celtic people who turned out on the anni
versary would be pleased with the pro
gramme which had been printed and gen
erally circulated. The report was received
and favorably acted urx>n.
All the sub-committees sent in encour
aging reports, and the convention ad
journed for four weeks, when the business
attending the celebration will be closed
and the receipts turned over to the com
mittee havinc in charge the erection of an
Irish- American ball in San Francisco.
EVENING CELEBRATION.
Ball and Exhibition Drill by Callfor-
nla Garrison at the Pavilion.
California Garrison No. 101, Regular
Army and Navy Union, wiil give an en
tertainment on the evening of the 17th
inst- at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
Previous to the ball, exhibition drills
will be civen by a battery of the Fifth
Artillery and a troop of cavalry from the
Presidio and the Second Gun Division of
the Naval Battalion, N. G. C, through the
kindness of General Graham, commanding
the Presidio, and Lieutenant-Commander
L. H. Turner of the Naval Battalion, N. G.
C. On the conclusion of the exercises the
night will be given up to dancing.
The union is composed of men who have
served honestly and faithfully in the
regular army and navy, and was organized
for the purpose of aiding ex-soldiers and
sailors in securing employment and assist
ing those in distress. It is a national order,
with branches throughout the United
States and on ships of war in foreign seas.
The members are taught loyalty to the
country and devotion to its flag.
CATHODE THEOLOGY.
Rev. William Rader Compares Boent-
gen's Discovery to the Penetra
tion of Theology.
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church spoke last evening
upon the "Theology of the Cathode Ray."
His text was: "For there is rtothing cov
ered that shall not be revealed; neither
hid that shall not be known." In part, he
said:
The revelations of science are often the types
of great truths in the spiritual world. What
is known as the new photography furnishes
such a type. This discovery is in harmony
with our times. Discovery, insight and pub
licity are the traits of modern thought. We
do not discover continents, but motives.
Prophecy has surrendered to penetration. The
cathode ray is penetrating the social, political
and religious world ; more ana more tfe are be
ginning to see the iuner life of things.
Science stops with matter. It may look
through iron and stone and flesh, but it cannot
see mind and motive and soul. The new pho
tography cannot see lifeâ only the phenomena
of life. In the conscience of the people, more
over, is written th* revelation that is to come,
for there is nothing covered that shall not be
revealed. There is such a thing as agnosti
cism, a limited and fragmentary knowledge.
There is, too, a theology of the coming trans
parency, when all things shall be made plain.
The revelation of things is the judgment of
men. God's insight is the cathode ray that
flashes beyond our visual range.
This is a world of mystery. The newspapers
only catch a fragment of the mighty life
around us. We do not understand our pain,
our troubles, ourselves. But the day hastens
when shall. All threads shall be disentangled
and the universal life disclosed. The race ap
proaches that awful day. Science is the pro
diction of its dawn. "Now we Fee through a
glass darjf ly, then face to face." The world will
never be happy until its interrogatories shall
at last be wiped away.
He'd Pay for Keeping.
A certain M. P. has a little daughter
who has the making of a great financier in
her.
One day her father called her to h s m.
"My dear,"said he, "a man this morning
offered'xne this room full of gold if I would
sell your little brother. Now that means
gold enough to fill this room from wall to
wall and from floor to ceiling. If I sell
your little brother for that sum I shall be
able to buy everything in the world you
want. Shall I sell him?"
"No, papa," answered the little girl
promptly; and then, before her delighted
lather could embrace her for expressing
so much unselfish affection, she went on:
"Keep him till he's bigger. He'll be worth
more men."â Spare Moments.

A CLOSE SHAVE!
What J. T. Ward of Park Citj
. Saw Close Ahead.

mHE HISTORY OF NO STATE IN THB
THE HISTORY OF NO STATE IN THB
-â -Union a hundred- ylars to come will be
more interesting than that of Utah. The suc-
cessful camping-ground of the Mormons (what,
ever else may be said of them, a greater power
in civilization), it has literally .grown * from 'a
sandy waste to a land "flowins: with milk and
honey," ana now supports a cultured and inÂ«
telligent race, who can indubitably throw the
cap of challenge into the arena of progress with
a good prospect of winning the laurels. Of
course, not all of the inhabitants of Utah are
Mormons, but the settlement of the Territory
primarily cannot be denied them.
Salt Lake City is said to be one of the pret*
tiest cities in the Union, but it is not the only
monument of the go-ahead spirit that Utah
possesses. ; Park City is certainly deserving of
mention. It ha^not a great population, but it
is Deautiful, and its inhabitants are as clear-
sighted and keen people as possible. One of
themâ J. T. Wardâ came pretty near to
making , a most serious mistake not many
months ago, though. He was suffering from a
serious malady, and â  he had neglected itâ
people will sometimes â with the conse-
quence that his health became so impaired
that he was, as the sailors put it, "right in the
breakers." But, to use another nautical
phrase, "he altered his helm Just in time."
Neglect for a few days longer would have been
serious to Mr. Ward, but with his good, gen- ,
vine common-sense he placed his case in the
bands of the famous specialists of the Hudson ,
Medical Institute, that great curative estab-
lishment which has occupied the bis white
building at the junction of Market, Stockton
and Ellis streets for so long. When once he
had given them his confidence he was secure,
and he felt it Instinctively. To say that be was
cured is of course unnecessary, for his case was
a curable one, and all curable cases are cured.
He has written as follows to the management:
PARK CITY.Utah, Sept. 4, 1895. ;
Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco,
Cal.â Gentlemen: I am very pleased to say
that I am cured of the terrible disease which I
had, and I shall always speak a good word for
the Hudson Medical Institute. I forward â â  you
iome money now, and you can let me know in
your next letter what I owe you. Yours truly,
J. T. WARD. â¢
This is plain evidence of the abilities of the
specialists of the Hudson Medical Institute: '
But there are thousands of such letters re-
ceived monthly.
K. C. Taf t of Stowe, Cal., says:. "I am feeling
fine, without a sign of the disease now."
.F. Minturn, St. Louis, Mo. "I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the careful and
conscientious manner in which my case has
been treated by you." .
E. W. Fowler, Kamele, Or., writes: "I am
feeling as good now as it is possible for man to
feel."
Now, when these letters come so plentifully,
and they cover all classes of diseases, is it not
absolutely conclusive proof that if you can be .
cured the Hudson Medical Institute is by far
the best and most reliable place to go T There
relief is CERTAIN.
All the Following Cases Are Curable:

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
We can do no more than feel for Arme
nia, but Cuba is within reaching distance.
This administration has talked on every
thing from religion to Venezuela except
Cuba and the third term.
Get yourself in trim for the campaign for
protection by making a practice of buying
home goods for home use.
The saddest thing about Democracy is
that it cannot get even a favorite son boom
well started before it bursts.
When Bpain sees how slow the Senate
moves on the Cuban question she will
wonder what in the world she got excited
about.
Yvette Guilbert is a dancer, not a
ticker, and she says the United States is
more lite France than any other country
in the world.
The Foraker men in Ohio seem to be
willing that McKinley should get the
nomination provided they get the credit of
nominating him.
The Senate should hurry Uncle Sam up
to recognize Cuba before the Presidential
election gets so exciting as to distract his
attention from everything else.
The Quay boom in Pennsylvania may
not be the biggest thing in the world, but
it is so b:g tbat no statesman in the coun
try is tall euough to overlook ii.
There are not many Democrats in Mas
sachusetts, but there are enough to get
mixed up in a tight to decide whether
Russell or Ulney is the favorite eon.
If Eastern libraries do not quit an
nouncing their rejection of "Jude, the Ob
scare," there will soon be an end to ita
obscurity and Trilby will have a successor.
The New York Sun says the Monroe
doctrine as written in Monroe's message is
Tin^niramstical, but asserts that tbe excel
lence of its Americanism more than atones
for the badness of its English.
If the Kentucky legislators spent yester
day properly they ought to be able to get
together this niurning in fellowship and
love and elect a Republican Senator with
out further devilnnmr.
As soon as the new United Ftates Art
Commission gets itself embodied it should
hasten to this City and draw a soul into
itself by gating on our angel ere she is
transformed to a windmill.
The conviction of an Ohio State Senator
of the offense of soliciting bribes will be a
warning to the rest against soliciting. The
modern statesman should confine himself
to taking things as they come.
Since Kruger has become famous there
has been an inquiry into his history, and
as a result it is made known that when a
young man he was a filibuster himseli and
rode a raid as gayly as Dr. Jameson.
St. Louis is building for the Republican
convention a new hallâ the grandest of
the kind in the world â but for the Demo
cratic convention Chicago has come to the
conclusion that any old thing will do. â¢
A New York theater has provided a tea
room where ladies can get refreshments
between the acts, and as a consequence
there is no longer any objection on the
part of the ladies when their escorts go out
to see a man.
It is now asserted that the little, insig
nificant, evil-smelling Chicago River floats
more freight in forty-eight hours than the
beautiful, grand Ohio does in a whole year,
but the assertion was made in Chicago and
lacks the verification of Cincinnati.
The latest movement for reform in the
atrical matters comes from the stage, and
is directed toward the elimination of what
the reformers call the "encore fiend." Tne
chances are, however, that the most active
in the movement are those who do not get
the encores.
It is the opinion of ex-Governor Camp
bell of Ohio that when McKinley gets to
the St. Louis convention "he will find a
great deal of green goods in his grip," but
then Campbell's experience in Ohio has
been disastrous enough to make him a
morbid pessimist.
According to the St. Louis Republic all
attempts to improve the Mississippi by
wing-dams and jetties have failed, and the
only recourse left is to return to primitive
methods and dig the Band out of the
shallow places in the channel. It is moro
than probable the same experience will be
had when the work begins of improving
the Sacramento.
It is asserted that Italy was induced to
establish herself in Africa by the British
for the purpose of heading off a Russian
plan to obtain a foothold on the shore" of
the Red Sea, and it is said Russia is now
assisting Abyssinia by way of retaliation.
The story is a good contribution to current
literature, but probably was not intended
to be of permanent value.
Senator Cockrell's assertion that Cleve
land has been carrying out the financial
pGiicy inaugurated by the Harrison ad-
nnnistration is an error, for Cleveland has
followed Republicanism neither in pre
cept nor in practice, but if ifc were true it
would show what a bungler he is, sin_ce it
would prove that he cannot keep out of
the woods even when he ha 3 a broad,
straight road marked oat for him and is
trying his best to follow it.
SETTLING THE STATE.
The San Francisco Investor urges a
course of action identical with that upon
which The Call has insistedâ that the
best plan for bringing settlers to Califor
nia is local organizations working through
a central body. The State Improvement
Committee is a central body composed of
volunteer members from various parts of
the State and its scheme is to disseminate
general knowledge at large and particular
information concerning any part of the
State when desired; but these members
are not, as a rule, representatives of organ
ized local bodies. If they were they could
exercise a much greater power and nave
more money with which to work. Under
its present plan the committee is com
pelled to forward the interests of individ
uals who assist it financially. For in
stance, it will assist in sailing the pro
ducts of those who furnish it with sam
ples and money for that purpose. This is
a fair and useful service, bnt it does not
serve directly to induce settlement.
Our contemporary makes this wise ob
servation : "To await the natural growth
of population or the increase of an indif
ferent immigration is a slow development
of them, slow in number, in capital and in
business activity. There are sixty million
people to the east of us to whom Califor
nia offers something practically impossi
ble for the most of them to obtain else
whereâa home in an affluent country,
free from cyclones and blizzards, pests
and cold, and other extremes that make
life burdensome. The sentiment as regards
California is practically a unit among that
sixty million. With a great many of them
it is, of course, a nascent one, but one that
becomes active upon slight provocation."
If Calfornia were on the eastern side of
the Rocky Mountains it would quickly re
ceive a dense population. As it is, its re
moteness makes a preliminary study of its
advantages practically impossible, and in
theÂ» absence of intelligent machinery for
giving information concerning it and for
making settlement easy, simple and safe it
is useless to expect a great influx of immi
grants.
The hard times prevalent in the East
should be regarded as a providential oppor
tunity for securing immigrants. With
millions of people the question of earning
a bare subsistence among the poorest or of
saving what has already accrued to the
well-to-do has become urgent and over
shadowing. We might leave the question
of profit out of the account and still make
a victorious campaign on tne simple
proposition that a eood living can be
made out of the soil of California. What
losses have been incurred came through
efforts to make more than a living â in
short, they were the result of speculation.
The assurance that a simple living can be
made, that the farm will produce all the
food required and a surplus for other
necessities would bring happiness to mil
lions of people.
THE BUCKLEY DEFEAT.
The culmination of the bitter fight be
tween the two factions of the local Democ
racy came Saturday, when, after a fierce
struggle, the so-called "Junta," the faction
opposed to Buckley's dictation, won a vic
tory. This has produced in the party a
split which must either insure the defeat
of the party or such a compromise as will
measurably restore Buckley's power.
From this time till the holding of the State
Convention, on the 16th of June, Buckley's
finest work will be done, and the determi
nation of his enemies subjected to the
severest strain. To defeat him in one
engagement is only to sharpen his wits for
the next conflict. Though defeated, he is
by no means conquered, and with his
shrewdness, leisure and money and with
the heavy backing that he is believed to
have, he is in a superior position to carry
on a relentless fight. The inspiration of
the revolt against him need not be ana
lyzed here. While his methods and the kind
of government which they produce are
familiar to all and are not to be desired, his
opponents have to make good their ciaim
that they have defeated him in the interest
of pure politics and decent government.
Thus far we have only their word for this.
It is to be kept in mind, however, that
political opposition to Buckley has a cer
tain value as a certificate of character.
The purpose of the State Convention is
to nominate Congressmen and select del
egates to the Democratic National Con
vention. The question of a Democratic
candidate for the Presidency is of no partic
ular concern to the people of the United
States just now, but the nomination will
be made as a matter of form. The selec
tion of Congressional candidates is quite
another thine. As a rule the Democratic
Congressmen whom Buckley has not sup
ported have done good work for the State,
but his strongest efforts have been ex
pended to defeat those whom he
could not control. The tactics which
he has pursued in the past will
undoubtedly be followed in the future.
Although his cause seems hopeless now it
is a safe prediction that he will develop a
surprising strength in the State Conven
tion, and thai in any event his position as
the leader of a faction will give him and
his followers an excuse to make trouble
and dictate terms.
EUEEKA'S PBEPEKENOE.
At a meeting of the Eureka Chamber of
Commerce the other evening some of the
members declared that as the natural
trade relations between the Humboldt
Bay region and Portland were closer than
those between that section and San Fran
cisco, it was to the interest of Eureka to
prefer Portland. Tne meeting was an im
portant one, being in a measure the result
of meetings recently held by the San
Francisco Traffic Association to devise
means for counteracting the effect pro
duced by the rate of $1 between Portland
and Eureka and $3 between Eureka and
San Francisco. This difference in rates is
diverting the Eureka trade from San
Francisco to Portland, and this diversion
has been produced by a steamship com
pany which has greater interests in Port
land than in this City.
San Francisco is glad to Bee Portland
prosper and cannot blame the business
men of Eureka for paying attention to
their own interests. The main point in
the whole question is the unrestrained
power of transportation companies to de
terir me for themselves the great economic
questions incident to transportation
charges. The importance of this question
to San Francisco is very great. Our prin
cipal source of lumber is the forests of
Humboldt County, and if this is to be
turned away from us it will strengthen
the combination of lumber men, raise the
price of building material, reduce build
ing operations and throw a large number
of workmen in the building trades out of
employment. It is true that the low prices
of lumber that have prevailed until recently
have overstimulated building and pro
duced rapid improvements out of propor
tion to the increase of population. This
has lowered the rent rate of the older
houses and caused a misleading number
of "To let" signs 10 appear. At the same
time it has given employment to many
workers, has opened numerous parts
of the City to settlement, and by reducing
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 1896.
rents has encouraged the incoming of new
residents. It is true also that we have too
many wooden houses and that wa are
neglecting the building stones that exist
so abundantly and in so great variety
throughout the State.
In losing the lumber, dairy products
and other valuable articles sent out by
Eureka we are losing also the return trade
which our merchants have, enjoyed. Geo
graphically the Hum bold t region belongs
to San Francisco. The extension of the
railroad from Uki&h to Humboldt would
be a far less expensive operation and would
open a much richer country than the exten
sion of the Santa Margarita line to Santa
Barbara. That would not only develop the
wealth of Mendocino and Humboldt coun
ties but would save them to San Fran
cisco, as it will never be practicable to
build a railroad from that section into
Oregon. These considerations are ren
dered all the more important by the
movement on foot to run a railroad from
Eureka eastwardly over the mountains
and across the uuper Sacramento Valley,
and thence northeastwardly to tap the
great systems of overland roads centering
in the Northwest. That presents a far
graver situation 'to us than tbe diversion
of trade to Portland, as such a railroad
would mean a Pacific terminus fox an
overland system and connecting steamers
direct to the Orient. Eureka can be saved
to San Francisco by a plan similar to that
by which the Valley Road is to make the
development of the San Joaquin possible.
In the meantime it is well to ponder the
fact that San Francisco is completely at
the mercy of the transportation com
panies.
SAff EAFAEL PBOTESTING-
A correspondent, writing in Sunday's
Call, makes an earnest plea for a reduc
tion of railroad charges between San Ra
fael and San Francisco, pointing out the
fact that the present rates are 300 per cent
higher than those between San Francisco
and the cities of Alameda County. It
seems patent to all except railroad man
agers tuat, taking into account the superb
natural attractions of San Rafael ana its
environment and the radical difference be
tween its climate and that of San Fran
cisco, its settlement would be rapidly in
creased by lowering the rates and that the
volume of business would quickly more
than compensate for the reduction in
rates. A curious point made by The
Call's correspondent is that the wealthy
residents of that section do not favor low
rates, preferring the exclusiveness which
high rates injure. But there is plenty of
room for all in this beautiful spot nestling
at the base of Tamalpais.
The case seems to be one eminently fit
for the consideration of the Railroad Com
miss; on â unless, indeed, its usefulness
might happen to be seriously crippled by
the determination of the pending suit to
restrain it from regulating the rates of the
Southern' Pacific Company. It at least
seems due from the railroad companies
operated between San Rafael and San
Francisco to make a full statement of their
reasons for maintaining the present rates
and against the possibility of reducing
them. It is exceedingly unfortunate that
any conflict should have arisen between
those companies and the people whom
they serve. There is never any good
reason for such antagonisms if the people
are just and the companies fair, broad
minded and enterprising. Such antagon
isms are exceedingly rare in other States
and have served to inflict serious injury
upon California. The best results both to
the people and the railroads can come
only through friendly co-operation. De
nunciation by mass - meetings and a
haughty scorn on the part of railroad
companies are the worst way possible to
secure the desired result.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
There was a birthday celebration on the
steamer Alameda during her run from Hono
lulu to San Francisco. Purser J. B- Button had
attained the respectable age of 50 years, and
the passengers were determined to not allow
the occasion to pass without some jollifica
tion. A purse was raised and an appropriate
present is to be purchased in this City for the
popular purser.

neer Little and Chief Steward Clark, they
formed the executive of the steamer Alameda
when she was taken over from the Cramps by
Spreckels Bros. Company in Philadelphia.
From that time to this the vessel has never
met with a mishap, and she is now one of the
finest steamers trading to Australasia.
Before joining the Oceanic Company Mr. But
ton was for two years in the service of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company and for thir
teen years previous to that on the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company's line running to
Panama. Wherever his business has taken
him he has been popular, and to-day he ranks
as one of the most competent pursers in Cali
fornia. The genial purser says he is good for
another twenty years of service and his
friends and the traveling public hope his pre
diction will come true.
Aage Jespersen and Gustav Morltz Salomon

from Copenhagen, arrived from the East last
night and registered at the Palace.
They are making an extensive pleasure tour
of the world, and are traveling under royal
passports issued to them by Christian IX him
self.
A month ago they were in Venezuela, which
they pronounce on the verge of a revolution
owing to the extreme despotism of the Presi
dent, who has imprisoned many of the most re
spected citizens. Only on the day of tneir de
parture from Caracas the editor of the prin

months' confinement. The people are men

While at San Domingo the President of the
island gave a swell luncheon, to which the
two travelers were invited. There were 250
guests. 150 o f whom were Americans.
On February 22 they were in Havana. Cuba,
and during their stay made several trips out
from the city. They witnessed plantations
burning and saw a good many insurgent
soldiers, whom they were surprised to find in
excellent military organization and, not at all
the unorganized bands they had supposed
from reading the Spanish papers.
From Ban Francisco the pleasure-seekers,

He was surprised at the size of American
newspapers and showed a copy of the leading
journal of CoDenhagen, a little four-page af
fair without illustrations and well sprinkled
all over with advertisements. It had an at
tested circulation of 12,000 in a city of
400,000 people.
REARRANGEMENT OF THE STARS.
An agreement has been reached by Secre
taries Lam on t and Herbert as to the re
arrangement of the stars in the blue field of
the United States flag, and the rearrangement
has received the approval of the President.
This change in the field of the National stand-
The New United States Flag With the Forty-fifth Star for New Stateâ Utah.
[Recommended by the Secretaries of War and Navy to the President and approved by him.
The forty'fifth star is added to the third line.]
ard is made necessary by the admission of
Utah to the Union of States, which adds the
forty-fifth star to the flag. Under the law the
new star will not be added until July 4, after
which date all Hugs displayed by the various
departments of the Government will contain
forty-five stars. In the field of the present flag
there are iorty.four stars, arranged In six rows.
The top and oottom rows contain eight stars
each, and the four intervening rows contain
seven each. The lines are horizontal, from
left to right, and run obliquely from top to
bottom. Two changes have been made in the
rearrangement ho as to meet the present neces
sity Â»nd to provide for contingencies in the near
future. One star has been taken from the bot
tom and added to the fifth row, and the addi
tional star required for Utah is placed in the
tnlrd row. In this manner the first, third and
fifth rows each contain eight stars and the sec
ond, fourth and sixth rows seven stars each.
When other States are admitted to the Union
stars may be added to those rows that will con
tain seven each, and upon the admission of
Arizona. New Mexico and Oklahoma the six
rows will be complete with eight stars each. It
is expected that the present arrangement will
not be disturbed by the admission of the three
Territories named.
In the first National flag containing the thir
teen stars they were arranged in a circle, and
the union itself was made square. But when
Vermont and Kentucky came in parallel rows
of stars were resorted to, there being three cf
them with five -stars each. The rectangular
field and the horizontal rows havealways since
held favor, although ingenious geometrical
devices have at times been proposed, in combi
natians of circles, diverging rays, and soon;
and one bill in Congress wanted them to take
the shape of a pansy, with a view to making
that the National flower.
THE SUMMER GIRL.

And the Summer Uirl Is looking
T'ward the mountain and the sea,
New engagements she Is booking,
With a grim and savage glee.
Eats and ribbons, laces, flowers,
All of fashion's vaguest rurrors;
Soon amid trie fragrant bowers
You will see her and her bloomers.
What would life be worth without her?
She's the center of the whirl. â¢ . ' â¢

THE FUR SEAL QUESTION.
The bill which Congressman Dingley intro
duced last year, which passed the House of
Representatives, to be defeated in the Senate
through the opposition of Senator Morgan,
and which, if passed, would have authorized
the Government to kill all the fur seal on the
islands of Bering Sea, if itcould not make an ar
rangement with the British, Russian and Jap
anese Governments to have fur-seal killing
suspended for several years' time, bids fair to
become a law before the present session of
Congress is over. Hon. Charles S. Hamlin, the
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, has taken
a great deal of interest in this matter, as the
fur seal islands come under the charge of the
Treasury Department, and from the state
ments recently made by him to the Ways and
Means Committee it is evidently his opinion
that, unless some such course is taken, it will
be impossible to prevent the Canadian pelagic
sealers from possessing themselves of practi
cally all that remains of the once enormous
herd of fur seal. According to the count made
last year by the Government officials, the herd
that will come this year to the islands of St.
Paul and St. George cannot exceed in number
250,000 seal.
When one remembers that on the year after
Alaska was purchased from the Russian Gov
ernment quite this number of seals were cap
tured in a single year, and that in 1874,
twenty-two years ago, there were, as nearly as
could be estimated, 5,000,000 fur seals on the
two islands, the enormous inroad that has
been made by the destructive methods of kill
ing adopted by those who have carried on the
sealing business in vessels becomes too evident
to be doubted. The interest of England should
.be, and probably is, in maintaining the exist
ence of the fur seal nerds, for the reason that
the cleaning, dressing and dyeing of the fur
seal skins give regular employment to 5000 or
6000 people in England who would be thrown
out of their occupation by the extermination
of these animals. In this respect the English
have far more at stake in the matter than we
have. If, with this interest and the constant
diminution of the fur seal herds, absolute ces
sation of killing cannot be obtained, we had
Detter, as the Dingley bill suggests, make an
end of the entire business by killing the re
maining seals, salting their skins and dispos
ing of them whenever the market warrants
such action.â Boston Herald.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE TILLMAN PHENOMENON.
A Stubborn Warrior Fblly Armed With
Moke Stubborn Facts. ;. .
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
After a Eecond attentive reading of Senator
Tillraan's speech lii full as it was delivered,
not in garbled report of the unfriendly
â press dispatches, it seems to me that I can do
the honest readers of The Call a real service
by calling their serious attention to this phen
omenal speech, and I am sure that all who
read it as ne delivered it will â  one â¢ day thank
me for this service. *My memory goes back to
the time when Lincoln made the speech which
made him President, wherein he outlined the
impending conflict between the North and
South.in the Cooper Institute, >iew York Cityâ
i"A House Divided < Against. Itself Cannot
Stand." He was less known wuen he made
that speech than Tillman was two months ago
.When . be awoke the Senate and I aroused the
country by a masterly statement of the present
impending crisis of the country.
Lincoln's great speech evoked a "storm of
abuse and personal ridicule from the defenders
of slavery in the South, and the "conservative"
commercial journals â¢ and financial circles of
the North quite equal to and quite that
poured out upon Tillman by goldmongers and
their faithful newspapers in the commercial
centers ; of the north eastern section of our
country and in a few places in the old North
west. Lincoln was called a "Western boor " a
"rail-splitter," a "baboon" and like -â  names by
"conservative" journuls in the North and pro
slavery journals, in the South. Since Tillman
"broke into > the Senate," as a plain farmer
from South Carolina, and used homely terms
to designate disagreeable facts, the New York
Times s has editorially - named him "a filthy
baboon," \ the *; New York ';, Evening Post "a
political anarchist," and the New York World a
"blatherskite." ;- In \ a letter to the New York
World he challenges these journals to publish
bis ? speech as he \ delivered it and , let their
readers- judge whether he coarse, brutal
blackguard," as would have the public
believe him to be, but they all declined to pub
lishit. vHe â Â£ says: "What â  other Senators have
whispered among themselves I have spoken
aloud, and iv plain words." Thousands of
letters â¢ assure him â  that to i the - people "the
truth bravely told has a sweet and wholesome
sound. .- Â»:- â¢ . .-. - â -..â¢â .'-â :-â -; .â â â â ^.â . v Jr.
-It is no marvel 'that i this notable ipeech'by
people's Government has mide upon the coun
try. But tney have apparently made a mis
take. They have overdone the me
onslaught was savage. It Arrested public at-
Tt has' made an unprecedented demand for
the speech. Enormous editions of Populist
newspapers containing the most salient fea
tures of this two hours' speech have been
printed and told and the demand for it con
tinues to grow. Senator Tillman himself has
finally been compelled to print the speech in
full, with an appendix, in a pamphletof twenty
four pages, which is sold at 1 cent a copy, lor
the Government does not print speeches, n
only permit" Senators and Congressmen to
frank "or send them postage fres. George M.
Stackhouse. 26 Maltby building, Washington,
D. C, mails the speeches at 1 cent a copy to all
who apply for them. "Bimetallism or Indus
trial Slavery" is the tftle of the speech. Ail
who believe in the free coinage of silver -will
find this speech more effective than any other
publication ever issued.
Readers of the daily newspapers will be sur
prised when they get this great speech as Till
man delivered it. The dignity, honesty, vigor
and clearness of the language he used will at
once arrest attention. The absence of rant
and coarse abuse will be In marked contrast
with what the gold-loving newspapers have
led them to expect.
Ordinary readers will use rougher words in
commenting on the speech as they read it than
Senator Tillman used. In fact, they will won
der tjiat he did not use harder words when he
so fully understood the situation, which he
sets forth with so much vividness.
On reading the speech' the second time I
marked a number of graphic passages which I
intended to copy in making this brief review
of it, but the limits of this little "letter" will
not permit it. To do these passages justice too
many words of the context are needed and
they had to be omitted. 1 can only add that
this speech by Tillman marks an epoch. No
man with any real love of country can afford
to forego a candid perusal of this speech, no
matter which ticket he intends to vote next

history that began with an incident in the
turbulent war times of the early Ws.
When the original Calvary Church was
on Bush street, below Montgomery, where
the Telephone building now stands, the
Key. Dr. Scott was its first pastor. He
was a Southerner by birth, but a Union
man in sympathy, although not radically
so. Some comments on Jeff Davis as a
man occasioned a great deal of adverse
criticism and the newspapers took the sub
ject up with the excitable Union partisan
ship then prevalent.
"I was a member of the congregation
from the first," said James R. Garniss
yesterday, "but it is a matter of local his
tory how one Sunday morning a mob col
lected outside of the church on Bush
street. Dr. Scott came out, entered a
carriage, and was driven away in safety,
and eventually went to England. After a
time he returned, but he would not po to
Calvary. He preached in a little upstairs
hall on Market street, somewhere between
Second and Third. That congregation
was the nucleus of St. John's Church.
"Then a hail was hired next to where
the California Hotel now stands. It was
a large hall attached to the old California
Theater, but Dr. Scott was very popular
and the growing congregation made the
change necessary. That is where the
church was organized and where the first
directors and elders were elected.
"Later we got money together and
bought an Episcopal church on the ground
now occupied by the Olympic Club build
ing. There it was that Dr. Scott died, and
we buried him from that old church. The
Olympic Club offered a good price for part
of" the property, and it was sold. We
moved up on the bill and built the pres
ent church.
"The location is a little unfortunate be
cause you have to climb a hill anyway you
approach it. it is in some respects a
Southern church, although it is not called
so, but most of the Southerners that come
here eventually drift into it. There is
about the congregation â and it is composed
generally of pretty well-to-do people liv
ing in the neinhborhoodâ that warm South
ern hospitality and sociability. The peo
ple all come out to the door and talk; it is
like an old-fashioned country congrega
tion. The minute a stranger appears they
go up and speak to him and make him feel
at home.
"it happens that our present minister
and his predecessor, the Rev. Mr. Jrwin,
were born in Ireland. They were school
and college mates. Mr. Kennedy is only
29, but he i 8 one of the brightest young
men I know and speaks without notes and
) a that easy, ready way that seems to be
peculiar to the educated joung Irishman."
The Rev. Samuel J. Kennedy was born
in Coleraine. County Derry, Ireland. He
received his early academic training In the
academical institution of his native city,
and from there went to Belfast, attending
the classes of the Queen's College, which
is affiliated with the Royal University of
Ireland, from wiiicn be was graduated in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 1896.
1886. Afterward he entered the Assem
bly's Presbyterian Seminary at, Belfast,
where for two years he pursued his studies
in theology and kindred subjects.
In the fall of 1888 he came to the United
States and entered the classes of the West
ern Theological Seminary, at Allegheny,
Pa., from which he was graduated in the
sprint; of 1889.
On leaving the seminary he took charge
of two missionary churches near St. Paul,
Minn., where he labored successfully for a
year and then went to Ireland to make a
short visic with his parents. Soon after
his return to Minnesota he received and
accepted a unanimous call to the pastorate
of ttie Presbyterian church of Le Sueur,
Minn., where for three and a half years he
labored with marked success.
In March, 1894, in response to an invita
tion, he visited the Calvary Presbyterian
Church of Seattle, Wash., and after a brief
stay accepted the invitation to become its
pastor, where, according to the Tost-
Intelligencer of that city, he "continued
to grow in favor with the members of his
church and with his neighbors of other
denominations.''
A noteworthy coincidence that resulted
in Mr. Kennedy being called to this City
was tie fact that he had been a life-long
chum of the former young pastor. Shortly
before Mr. Irwin's fatal sickness he had
visited the Northwest for vacation and
rest, and while in Seattle he met his old
friend Kennedy after a separation of eight
years.
When he was on his sick bed he sug
gested to the members of the session that
in case his illness should be of long dura
tion he would like Mr. Kennedy to come
down and till his pulpit, and later when
he learned that death was imminent he
repeated the request.
It ia Mr. Kennedy's purpose to continue
in the main the new work begun by his
dead chum. Particularly is this the case in
regard to having the best voices obtaina
ble for the choir and in the attempt to
popularize the evening services.
"The evening services I wish to make
just as popular as possible," said Mr. Ken
nedy. "And," interposed his wife, smil
ingly, "he believes in beginning on time
and ending on time."
"Yes," he resumed; "'an hour's service;
that's our idea. Though we have a pro
fessional choirâ and I believe the best pos
sible talent ought to sing praise in the
sanctuaryâ we do not depend upon them
for all the singing. Among the congrega
tion there are m:iny good voices, and I hope
to have short, crisp gospel praise services,
in which everybody will take part.
"I am very much pleased with the recent
growth of the Sunday-school, which has
been very successful "under the superin
tendency of big, jovial Mr. Newhall.
"The Christian Endeavor Society is help
ing outside charities and materially aiding
the church. The Ladies' Aid Society and
the Ladies' Home and Foreign Missionary
Society are realizing their purposes, and
the former is planning now to decorate and
refurnish the pastor's study."
Mr. Kennedy's sermon yesterday morn
ing was from the text, "I go to prepare a
place for you," and his development of
it was an explanation for Christ's ascen
sion into his father's house of many man
sions after his vicarious sacrifice in order
that the heavenly gates, closed because of
man's sin, might be opened again. In
closing he reminded his auditors that it is
necessary for entrance into heaven to be
titled on earth by living a life of faith in
Christ.
In the evening Mr. McCarshin, a mem
ber of the China Inland Mission for nearly
thirty years, cave a brief account of his
personal observations iv that field ot Chris
tian work.
AN EARLY MORNING FIRE
The Yellowstone Saloon Scorched and
Flooded, but Fully lu
â¢ured.
Quite a lively fire occurred yesterday
morninp at 5 o'clock in the building at 22
Montgomery street.
When the department engines arrived
the back portion of the second floor was
all ablaze. This 13 immediately over the
Yellowstone saloon, owned by M. Axtell.
whose loss by fire and water will amount
to about $2000. This saloon has been but
recently litted up at considerable expense
by the proprietor and is insured for $10,000.
The floor where the tire originated was
occupied as offices by several persons.
Among them were Stilwell's detective
agency, R. McColgan's loan a?ency, James
W. Coleman's real estate, \V. H. Stack
pole, a lawyer, and a man whose name
none of the other tenants knew, but who
was known as "the assayer." It was in
this person's quarters that the tire origi
nated, as it is supposed from a heated fur
nace.
The cigar-store of C. E. Kelly in front of
the Yellowstone was damaged to the ex
tent of $300. , .
The damage to the building will, it is
estimated, amount to about $30C0.
LABOR ENTERS POLITICS.
Organization of the Central
Trades Labor Alliance
Decided Upon.
TEMPORARY OFFICERS ELECTED
Its Constitution to Be Based on the
Principles of the Labor
Convention.
Out of the recent labor convention, which
on February 14 adopted a declaration of
principles, social and political demands,
there was born yesterday "The Central
Irades Labor Alliance."
In a way the organization is unique. It
is a confederation of organized labor
bodies having forÂ«its prime object the im
provement and advancement of the labor
ing classes, not through strikes, not
through boycotts, but entirely and directly
through the use of the ballot.
"While the nucleus is largely composed of
the unions which constitute the Labor
Council, a body affiliated with the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, the new organi
zation is absolutely independent of any
other local or National body and is there
fore free to take action, political or other
wise, regardless of any outside authority
or influence.
Although announced to meet at 10
o'clock in the morning the Labor Conven
tion was not called to order until about
11:20 o'clock at Federation Hall yesterday.
After rollcall and the reading of the min
utes of the last session communications
were read from and reports made by va
rious Jabor unions on the declaration of
principles, social and politic al demands
adorned by the convention. They were
indorsed by the Carpenters' and Joiners'
"Union No. 483, Brewery Workmen's Union,
Journeymen Coopers' Union, Carpenters'
and Joiners' Union No. 22, Barbers' Asso
ciation of San Francisco, German Bakers'
and Confectioners' Union, Painters'
Union, Sailors' Union, Musicians' Union,
American Railway Union, Bookbinders'
Union and Woodworkers' Union.
The Journeymen Tailors' Protective and
Benevolent Union and the American
Bakers' Union declined to indorse the
political demands, and delegates from the
Ironmolders' Union and Typographical
Union No. -1 reported that their respective
bodies had not yet taken action in the
matter, but would do so shortly. As far
as the vote of the different unions was re
ported it showed 134!) for and 58 against
the declaration of principles, social and
political demands of the convention.
A letter from Labor Commissioner E. L.
Fitzgerald was read in which he called the
attention of the convention to the fact
that the law prescribing eicht hours as the
limit on Government work was being con
tinually violated by contractors who put
men on the work and paid them by the
hour, in this manner circumventing the
objects of the law. He suggested that the
Legislature be asked to amend it by
making it more definite and by adding a
penalizing clause for the violation. It
also suggested the advisability of pro
hibiting contractors who failed to keep
their contracts with the men they em
ployed from being allowed to bid on any
public v?ork, and charged, that the time
check system was being largely employed
by contractors and corporations in viola
tion of the law and recommended tnat a
penalizing clause be attached to the law.
At noon a recess was taken until 1
o'clock to permit the committee on plat
form and organization to present a
written report. On reassembling at 1:35
the committee, through T. F. Burns, sub
mitted the following report:
We recommend that all organizations repre
sented in this convention join the present
Labor Council and elect delegates thereto.
That a new election take place and the pres
ent Labor Council be reorganized under its
present charter, and amend its constitution so
as to admit of the discussion of the social, po
litical and economic questions in all their
phases.
This led to a debate that lasted two
hours, the principal objection to the adop
tion of tue report being that it would sim
ply tend 10 rejuvenate the Labor Council,
which as an affiliated body of the Ameri
can Federation of Trades was prevented
from discussing party politics.
During the debate J. Faleen offered an
amendment providing that a new council
be formed based on the lines and princi
ples drawn up and adopted by the conven
tion a month ago, and N. Blum offered an
amendment to amendment thut a new
body be organised to affiliate with the
New York Socialist and Labor Alliance.
The latter was defeated by an almost
unanimous vote, and then the l'aleen
amendment was adopted by a vote of 27
to 4.
Tbe secretary then read a communica
tion stating that at a meeting of the Brew
ery Workmen, held on the evening of
March 14, the painters' strike was in
dorsed, iinancial and moral support was
tendered them and they were encouraged
to stand out Jor the adoption of the work
ing-card system as the only protection
against the early reduction of wages.
A motion was carried to go into perma
nent organization ot the proposed new
council.
The convention was adjourned and then
Chairman "VV. H. Hutchinson ana Secre
tary J. W. Rose of the convention were
elected as similar temporary officers of
the new organization. To these T. F.
Burns was added as temporary vice-presi
dent.
On motion the name of the new body
was declared to be "The Central Trades
Laoor Alliance."
It was then decided to appoint a Com
mittee", composed of one member from
each union represented in the alliance, to
draft and present a constitution and by
laws.
It was resolved to extend an invitation
(o all labor organizations in San Francisco
to send delegates to the next meeting of
the alliance.
The following were announced as the
committee on constitution and by-laws:
C. F. Sha'lt, F. H. Schurtz, R. Linhart,
Thomas Hurd, G. W. West, Otto Grassman,
Ed Rosenberg, H. M. Saunders, J. Less,
N. Blum, J. K. Phillips, Henry Margdon,
K. Streibig, M. Buckley, R. T. Gough, C.
L. Ames.
Adjournment was taken until April 5 at
10 a. m.
After adjournment Taylor Rogers made
a few remarks. He said: "This is the
most important step labor has taken in
San Francisco in twenty-five years. And
no doubt it will be criticized. Yet the only
possible doorway for the escape of labor
from its present thraldom is independent
political action. I congratulate you on
your work. You have taken the rigLt
step." __________^___
WAR IN THE NATIONALS
Many Members Side With the
Veterans Against the
Trustees.
Trouble Caused by an Order Ejecting
the Exempt Militiamen From
Their Quarters.
Considerable feeling has been created by
the action of the Nationals in notifying
the Veteran Association that they would
be required to vacate the quarters occupied
by them in the Ellis-street Armory.
The Veteran Association is composed of
exempt members of the National Guard,
and on its rolls are borne the names of
those who have served therein from gener
als down to privates. It was organized
several years aeo and held meetings in the
old armory of the Nationals on Post
street. At the time the armory was built
on Ellis street the Veterans were invited
to meet there, and although there was con
siderable opposition to the location of per
manent headquarters, the association de
cided to rent the room offered them and
the Veterans went to considerable expense
to furnish the same.
Last week when companies F and X of
the First Regiment moved to the Ellis.
! street armory, for their accommodation it
became necessary to change the rooms
occupied by the Signal Corps, and to ac
commodate them they were offered and
accepted the room occupied by the Vet
erans. This, it appears, was done with
out any notice to the Veterans, and the
lirst they knew of it was when Com
mander Grimwood received a notice a
couple of days ago that they would be re
quired to vacate By the 15th inst.
Major Grimwood considers that the asso
ciation has not been fairly treated in this
matter. At the solicitation of the Nation
als, he claims, they had rented quarters in
the armory in a room set aside for them
for that purpose when the building was
erected. If they were required to m6ve,
he declares, they should receive such no
tice as is usual under the circumstances,
and he will not permit the furniture and
other property to be moved or stored, and
will retain possession of the rooms until a
meeting of the association, which will be
held on Wednesday, tne 18th inst., when
the matter will be brought before the
members and they may decide what action
to take. In the meantime he has courte
ousiv offered the use of the room to the
Signal Corps.
It is now stated that while these changes
and removals have been made under the
direction of the trustees of the Nationals
they do not meet with the approval of a
large number of the members of com
panies C and G, who compose the quasi
organization known as the Nationals, and
there are decided objections on theirpart
against the act>dn of the trustees. They
claim that when the building was erected
it was intended for the sole occupancy of
companies C and G, the upper portion to
be rented for social purposes, and to that
end considerable money was expended in
the nature of embellishment.
Lively times may be expected at the con- :
templated meeting wfaeu the Veterans
meet to air their grievances, and still more
lively limes when the C and G opponents
to the trustees get to work.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW
A Demand for Five to Twenty
Acre Tracts in the
Country.
AUCTION SALES ANNOUNCED.
The City Asked to Pay for Sprinkling
the Streetsâ The Week's
Record.
There is a perceptible increase in the
demand for small tracts of from five to
twenty acres each in the country. This is
thought to be due to the fact. that a
greater proportion of the strangers com
ing to the State at present to resiie are a
class seeking homes in the country rather
than in the city. It is an encouraging
sign, however, for all movements that tend
to increase the population of the rural dis
tricts have an ultimate healthy and stable
effect on real estate values in the city.
A number of firms that have not paid
any special attention heretofore to the
handling of country lands are arranging
for departments for that purpose in antici
pation of a brisk trade in this line of realty
in the near future.
The past week has not been productive
of much that is new in the market except
s general report of increased inquiries and
more of an inclination on the part of sel
lers to meet offers of intending purchasers.
Three different auction sales were held
during the week, and the prices realized
â were considered satisfactory. The aggre
gate amount of these sales was about
$100,000.
STHEET SPRINKLING.
The Merchants' Association is still la
boring with the Board of bupervisors to
induce them to let the contract for street
sprinkling in the same manner that the
contract is let for cleaning the streets.
The chief opposition to the movement
comes from those who claim ownership to
the different "sprinkling routes," so
called, in the City. They claim that if the
Citr undertakes to do the sprinkling it
â¢will be a confiscation of property rights
that they hold is vested in tnese routes.
It is hardly necessary to say that there is
no legal foundation for snch a claim.
What sprinkling is done at present is
paid for by the various merchants,' who
contribute a certain stipulated sum per
month to the respective owners of these
routes. This is entirely voluntary on the
part of the merchants, but as they are not
the only ones benefited they deem it un
just to foot the bills alone. The occupants
of the upper floors of buildings as well aÂ«
pedestrians derive as much benefit from
well-sprinkled streets as the merchant.
It is, in fact, a matter of such universal
importance to all that the merchants say
there is no justice in forcing them to pay
individually for a service tnat is properly
one of the duties of the municipal govern
ment to maintain.
In the last tax levy was included $20,000
to be devoted to street-sprinkling expen
ses. This tax was collected but never
used for the purpose for which it was
raised. As the fund is said to be still
intact in the treasury it is believed there
is no special reason why the Board of
Supervisors should not heed the often pre
ferred petitions of the Merchants' Associ
ation and relieve the latter from the un
just expenditure they are now compelled
to bear in order to keep the streets free
from dust through proper sprinkling.

week, aggregating $302,645. The principal

The number of deeds recorded last week
was 125.
Sixteen building contracts were filed the
past week aggregating's42,s49.
BUILDING KOTES.
Contracts were let last week by Dr.
Charming H. Cook for the construction of
a very handsome residence for him on the
west side of Baker street, between Wash
ington and Jackson, of which the accom
panying cut is an illustration. It is to be
quite out of the ordinary style of architec
ture and will present a picturesque and
attractive appearance â¢when completed.
The roof will he pitched, the entrance of
the colonial style and the entire . house
will be covered with, oiled shingles. There
will also be French windows with dia
mond pattern transoms in leaded glass.
The doctor will have his offices located
In the basement, the entrance to wnich
will be close to the gateposts, the latter
being built of clinker brick. The entrance
to the dwelling will be by a front door into
a large vestibule, from which easy steps
lead to the main living-room. This apart
ment, which will measure 18 feet by 19, is
to be finished in Oregon pine, with a
wainscoting six and a half feet high and
paneled ceiJinc. In the rear will be the
parlors and drawing-room. The second
floor will contain four bedrooms, bath
rooms and other conveniences, while the
attic will be devoted to billiard-room and

FIGHT OVER A TRANSFER.
William E. Johns, Stockbroker,
Thrown Off a Post-Street
Car.
He Had Walked a Block From the
Transfer Point, Which Caused
the Trouble.
William E. Johns, a young stockbroker,
was thrown from Post-street car No. 708
yesterday afternoon by the conductor, C.
L. Healy, and the gripman, and at Hea
ly's request Policeman Coughlin arrested
Johns for battery.
Johns left his home at 756 Oak street
about 1 o'clock and boarded a Hayes-street
car to go to the Olympic Club, of which he
is a member. At Hayes and Polk streets
he got a transfer to the Post-street cars,
which was punched good tFll 2 o'clock.
As there was no Post-street car in sight,
Johns walked along to the corner of Grove
street, and when car 708 overtook him he
boarded it. Healy asked him for his fare
and he presented the transfer.
Without looking at it rfealy said, "That
is no good; I want your fare."
"Why," said Johns, "the transfer is good
till 2 o'clock, and it wants twenty-live min
utes to the nour yet. Look at it and see
for yourself."
"I won't look at it," retorted Healy.
"You should have come on at Hayes and
Polk. Give me your fare or I'll throw
you off the car."
Johns refused to give him another fare
and Healy signaled the griDtnan to stop.
There were a number of ladies in the car
and on hearing Healy's threat they started
from their seats. Johns sat patiently
waiting developments, and they came
soon. Healy and the gripman grabbed
hold of Johns and forcibly ejected him
from the car. Then the fun began. Healy
lost his temper and struct Jolins on the
jaw. Johns promptly shot out his right
and left into Healy's face, and Healy
staggered as if hit with a sledgehammer.
The gripman ran across the street, and
Johns with a well-directed kick accelerated
his speed.
A car approached from the Post-street
terminus, and Healy got the conductor
and gripman to come to his assistance.
They advanced upon Johns, but after siz
ing up the athletic young stockbroker the
re-enforcements beat a retreat.
By this time a crowd had gathered and
Policeman Coughlin, who was returning
from the branch postorhce, went along to
see what was the matter. Healy ordered
him to arrest Johns on the charge of
battery, and Johns was followed to the
City Prison by a crowd of sympathizers.
He'was soon released on bail.
Peter Mullin, Twenty-first street and
Potrero avenue; Albert Windt, 1424 Ne
braska street; Samuel A. O'Hara, 1229
Howard street, and Harold H. McCallum,
214 Eleventh street, who were passengers
on the car, will appear as witnesses for
Johns.
It is likely that the affair will result in a
civil suit agaiiret the company, which will
test the question as to whether a passenger
is compelled to stand at the transfer point.
A CANE FROM THE HARTFORD.
Major Fahey's Present to Captain John
K. Gleeson.
John E. Gleeson is the proud possessor
of a walking-cane made from one of the
live-oat ribs of Commodore Farragut's
flagship Hartford. The presentation was
made at a little banquet given that gentle
man by Major William Fahey of the Cos
mopolitan Hotel. In presenting the stick
the Major said it was the only one that
had been secured from the hard wood of
the old cruiser, as he got the only piece
without a blemish that was long enough
to furnish such a cane. Gleeson, who is a
veteran, received the present amid ap
plause, on the condition that he would not
part with it as long as he lived.

Nealon Defeat T. F. Bonnet and
Al Pennoyer.
Several good games were played in the
handball courts yesterday. The rain in
terfered with the attendance at the Union
court, but the San Francisco court, which
is covered, was crowded to suffocation.
The principal attraction at the San Fran
cisco court was a match between P. T.
Donnelly, the amateur champion, and J. C.
Nealon and T. F. Bonnet and Al Pennoyer.

rel*BROWN'S JUDGES
MEET TO-DAY
Little Probability of a Ver
dict Being Rendered
Soon.
NEW DIFFICULTIES RISE
Miss Overman's Flight to Ense
uada to Be Made the Sub
ject of Inquiry.
LOOKS DARK FOR THE PASTOR.
Some of the Members Think Mrs. Tun
nell Is None Other Than Jane
Elizabeth Baddin.
The ecclesiastical council convenes to
day at 2 o'clock to again take up the bur
dens incident to the problems before them
lor decision.
It is intended to continue in session un
til the weighty matters are disposed of,
taking recess only for dinner and lunch.
In view of complications which have arisen
â within the last forty-eight hours, it is now
thought that at least two. and possibly
three, days will be required to complete
their deliberations.
It is among the possibilities that a ver
dict will be rendered before the day is
ended, but such an event is not looked for
by Dr. Brown or his friends.
There is a great deal of ground yet to
cover, for while immaterial matters have
been segregated and disposed of, the vital
testimony has been touched on but lightly.
There is only one point connected with
the Stockton episode which has made any
impression on the mind 3 of the jurors.
The incident considered unfavorable to
Dr. Brown is one of his own making.
When, after the accused pastor had such
a peculiar, and, according to his state
ment, shocking experience with the charm
ing widow on the occasion of his first visit
to her, he found it impossible to tell the
Btory to his wife until nearly a month
later. In the meantime, in fact, three or
four days after the kissiug affair, the
widow called at the churcu study and
made ample apologies for her unseemly
conduct. The council contends that then
was the time Dr. Brown should have gone
to his wife and confessed that his lips had
been touched by others than her own.
This incident is, of course, not of suffi
cient importance to come under the head i
of unministerial conduct, but will be made '
the subject of a slight reprimand.
The night of Mattie Overman from this
City last Thursday causes no end of un
favorable comment among the members j
of the council. The matter has not in any
way been considered in the executive ses- i
sions, but will form an important part in j
to-day's deliberations.
A committee will be appointed to wait |
on Dr. Brown with a view of hearing what |
that gentleman might have to offer in the â 
way of a plausible explanation. Thecoun- ;
cil "now recalls with great vividness Miss
Overman's oft-repeated statement that she
did in it know the hiding place of Mrs.
Tunnell.
At the very- moment when the council
would have liked to have had Miss Over- i
man once more before them that young j
lady was traveling toward the Mexicau i
border as fast as steam coi^ld carry her.
She was making directly for Ensenada,
Mexico, where Mrs. Tunnell has been for |
nearly a month. The members of the
council will not believe for a moment any
statement which Pastor Brown might !
make carrying with it the idea that Miss |
Overman's trip across the border is a sort j
of pleasure excursion, and that her subse
quent meeting with Mrs. Tunnell was an
accident pure and simple.
There are some who profess to believe
that Misa Overman's trip was made in the j
hope of securing an affidavit from htr j
aged friend which would tend to strengthen j
her story that Dr. Frown's affection for her
was of a purely platonic character. It is !
hardly possible to get such a paper back to i
San Francisco before the council reaches a j
verdict, but Dr. Brown desires to present j
such a document to his congregation re- I
gardless of the findings of his twenty
Judges. He is being propped up with the
belief that if an unfavorable verdict is
handed in, an affidavit of the character re
ferred to would more than offset it. If the
pastor is let off with a mere reprimand,
then a paper from Mrs. Tunnell would, he
considers, remove all shadow of suspicion
from his name-
The hasty departure of Miss Overman
for Ensenada has had the effect of continu
ing a distinct suspicion in the minds of
several members of the council that Mrs.
Tunnell is none other than the elusive Jane
Elizabeth Baddin.
To substantiate this theory the peculiar
manner in which Dr. Brown paid the $500
hush money is referred to. As to the time, j
manner and place of paying the money
both Mrs. Davidson and the accused man
agree. That is, the receipt given by the
alleged extortioner in the name of Mrs.
Baddin was in Dr. Brown's possession
nearly eighteen hours before the money
was actually paid.
With this document in his possession |
and with no knowledge of such a person as
Jane Elizabeth Baddin, believing in Mrs.
Davidson and conscious of his own inno
cence, the occasion for paying the $500 is
not understood nor appreciated by at least
five members of the council. This matter,
therefore, will cut a big figure in the final
deliberations of the council.
There are three distinct counts against ;
Rev. Dr. Charles Oliver-Brown, namely, in- j
timidation, non-ministerial conduct and im
moral conduct. A conviction on any one â 
of these charges is sufficient to cause the
accused man's withdrawal from the pas
torate of the First Congregational Church. |
It is not within the province of the council, j
however, to advise his church what action
they shall take in the premises.
The council was called for the single
purpose of inquiring into the truth or
falsity of the charges. It is conceded that j
if Pastor Brown is adjudged guilty of non
ministerial conduct, unqualified in any j
wny that it meaus his retirement from ;
the ministry so far as the Bay Conference
is concerned. '
In the face of such a conclusion the First
Church -vould hardly dare retain Dr.
Brown as their pastor, for if they did and
Dr. Brown were expelled from the confer
ence the church wouldof necessity be sub
ject to the same ruling. . ,__,
It is not thought probable that the First
Church would be willing to incur the dis
pleasure of the conference by retaining a
mini&ter not recognized by the associated
churches.
The condition of Dr. Brown was an
nounced last night as slightly improved.
He is not yet sufficiently well to leave the
house.
Professor Lloyd as usual presided at the
First Congregational Church yesterday.
MRS. DAVIDSON WRITES.
She Reviews Her Case Enter-
talnlngly to a Boston
Friend.
BOSTON, Mass., March 15.â A letter
was received in this city yesterday by an
old friend of Mrs. Mary A. Davidson, now
under arrest in San Francisco for alleged
blackmailing, in which Mrs. Davidson re
views her case in a somewhat defiant man
ner. The woman who received the letter
was quite intimate with Mrs. Davidson
when the latter was a member o! the Rev.-
A. A. Williams' congregation, and is one
of the very few people who stood by Mrs.
Davidson during here troubles here. When
Mrs. Davidson was arrested she began cor
responding with her, and this is the sec
ond letter received.
In the letter she says:
SANFRANnsco, March 8.
My Bear Sister in Christ: Your dear letter
reached me yesterday. I was so glad to hear
from you and your goodness I'll never forget.
There are so very few of my old lriends who
care to know me now that I cau't help feeling
good to knpw that there is one friend of mine
left in Lynn. The rest forgot me when I was
unfortunate there.
I am feelitig much better now than 1 was
when I wrote you last. I cannot talk much
about my case, because my lawyer 6ays not
to. but 1 can tell you that I'm going to be vic
torious. Dr. Brown is having a)l he can handle
before the church council, and he's lucky If
the council, in spite of his poweriul friends,
don't find him guilty.
Another girl besides Miss Overman will be In
it, I guess.
Anyway, he's convinced by this time that I
told "him the truth when 1 said the people
would- believe him guilty. They do and will.
whether the church clears him or not. So far
as I'm concerned when the court takes up my
case he'll be very sorry he was so smart. Not
half has come out in the church favorable to
me that will come out in court. My lawyer
says no jury in California will ever con
vict me.
Cora's husband (Edgerley) has been shown
up again, this time for a new club he's formed,
and one of the papers here printed it under,
big headlines because he was my son-in-law.
I felt bad at that, because ii may make people
think my whole family are disreputable.
But then He will look out for us all.
No; I shall not leave here. When this case is
over I shaU resume my usual life and live
down this scandal. I can do it, and I know
when the people know the truth they will
not blame me. They will be more Christian
than Dr. Brown. Had I been less of a Chris
tian, and not done by the doctor as I w.ould
have him do by me, I would have been all
right, and never had this trouble. Bat, then,
no cross no crown.
She then goes on to speak: of her friends,
family and of the Rev. Mr. Williams and
other Lynn acquaintances, and closes:
So good-by, dear sister. I shall hope to hear
from you soon again. Please send me what
the Lynn and Boston papers Bay about me.
Yours "in Christ, Jlary a. Davidson.
MAJOR RYAN'S ORATION
Discussion of the "Juggling Je
suit" at Metropolitan Tem
ple Yesterday.
Jesuits Held Responsible for Armenian
Massacre and the Venezuelan
Dispute.
The Sunday afternoon meeting of the
A. P. A. brought another large gathering
of people to Metropolitan Temple yester
day.
After the organ voluntary by Professor
Werner the opening address was delivered
by H. W. Quitzow. "America 11 was sung,
prayer was offered by Key. Dr..C. A. Rab
ing, and then Baby Wearns, the pretty
â  little girl of five or six years, sang two of
! her songs, "The Little Red Schoolhouse,"
and some anti-Catholic sentiments set to
the music of "Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the
i Boys Are Marching." She was vocifer
ously applauded.
W. F. Barnes, the State secretary of the
I order, sang "The Mustering Drum."
Major F. C. Kyan was again the orator,
! and he stated as he took the platform that
I it was probably his last Sunday here,
though he is to lecture next Monday even
ing.
Then he complimented the San Francisco
newspapers for their fairness in publish
ing both sides of the religious controversy.
He declared that the secular papers in all
the other large cities of the country,
': enumerating them from Denver toÃostpn,
will not give the A. P. A. a hearing.
"The Juggling Jesuit, or the Experi
i enced Powers of St. Peter's Bark," was
! the subject of Major Ryan's address.
The history of the Society of Jesuits was
! presented by Major Ryan. Then the
! Turkish persecution of the Armenians was
j taken up, and the orator inquired whether
I the Jesuits may not be the power that in
spires the murderous work of the Turks.
"No word of protest has been heard from
Rome," he said. "May it not be that be
i hind all these butcheries stand the Jesuits
; with their banners unfurled?"
The denunciation of the Jesuits in France
and other countries was reviewed. The
French Parliament declared the order to
be perverse, seditious and contrary to the
spirit of religion, though every member of
that Parliament was a Roman Catholic.
An analysis of the Jesuit constitution
followed, Major Ryan quoting to show that
the novitiate of the order is required to re
gard his superior in the order as Jesus
Christ.
"Talk about the patriotism of O'Con
neil!" was the point made in another part
of the address. "When O'Connell left
Ireland and was about to die, what did he
do? He ordered that his heart should be
cut out and sent to the Pope of Rome and
that his heartless carcass should then be
taken back and buried in old Ireland.
What kind of patriotism is that?"
Major Ryan declared that the time had
passed when a man must be a Catholic be
cause his father was one, when a man
must be a Methodist because his father
was one, when a man must be a Repub
lican because his father was one, or when a
man must be a Democrat because his
father had first voted for Andrew Jack-
Bon.
"Retain your conscience, retain your
will power, retain everything in your
nature tnat goes to make of you an honest
and independent man or woman."
The speaker declared that in spite of all
that had been said, "there are Romanists
who stand up, before priest and bishop,
for God and home and children, men who
do not give up the freedom of their indi
viduality. These are the men who have
their children in the public schools."
The declaration that ''therearefew Web
sters in Congress to-day" was applauded,
but there was no applause when the
speaker declared that "few governors in
the United States climb to their places
honestly." The audience became uproar
ious, though, at the suggestton of putting
in a penitentiary cell every man who sells
Lis vote, and with him every man who
buys a vote.
Among, other things charged against the
Jesuits, following the record of numerous
historical events, Major Ryan asserted
that the order to divert attention from
what it would wish to conceal is trying to
throw this country into a war with Eng-
Sby means of a dispute that began be
this country waa established. "But,"
the orator, "Jesuitism has not power
enough to throw us into war with Eng
land,'* and loud applause was given in re
sponse.
"The religion of infidelity with intelli
gence is better than the religion of Jesuit
ism witn ignorance," was one of the con
cluding thoughts.
The closing musical number was "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic."
Next Sunday Rev. Dr. Ray Palmer is to
lecture in the temple at 3 o'clock on "Criti
cismof the A. P. A."
The Dog-Killers of Japan.
Quite a new departure in insurance has
been devised in Kioto. The dogs of that
city, as in many other places, are (theÃrit
is!i consular report says) harassed by their
inveterate foes the dog-killers. Some
shrewd persons have, therefore, conceived
the idea of starting a dog insurance com
pany, which professes to insure the loss or
death of a dog by payment of a small
monthly premium. Death from natural
causes is, however, not insured; it must
be death at the hands of dog-killers. What
the "killers" do with the dogs is nobstated.
In the neighboring empire of China they
would eat them.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 16, J896.
THE BANNER OF ANARCHY
Pietro Gori's Followers Promise
Fidelity to the Red
Flag.
IS A BADGE OF SUFFERING.
Great Enthusiasm in Washington-
Square Hallâ Will Make the
Propaganda.
"Let others call anarchy folly and mad
ness. Heed them not but remember that
in past ages the greatest scientists and dis
coverers were called crazy. We are few,
but we can band together for the happi
ness of the world and the well-being of hu
manity."
It was with these words that Pietro Gori
presented the red and black flag of an
archy to the members of the new
Federation of Anarchists yesterday
afternoon in Washington-square Hall.
Mrs. Gaffe Swearing Allegiance to the Anarchist Banner at the Meeting in Washington-Square Hall.
The new organization numbers nearly
00 members, and most of them were
present, with a following of friends
and admirers of Gori and of his eloquence.
The enthusiasm was immense, for Gori's
farewell address had just been delivered,
and when his remarks culminated by pre
senting the banner, the red and black
bunting was received with as many ac
clamations as if it had been a flag round
which the audience was rallying to fight
for hearth and home.
The flag of the anarchists proved to be
of a blood\red color, tastefully bordered
with deep black, and on the red ground
was inscribed in black the legend, "F. S.
A. L. I. N. X. Allianza Socialista-
Anarchica di San Francisco" (Socialistic-
Anarchical Federation of the Italian
W r orkmen of North America, San Fran
cisco branch).
The banner was handsomely mounted
on a black staff tipped with gold, and it
presented an extremely picturesque and
imposing appearance.
When the acclamations which greeted
the flap had subsided enough for Pietro
Gori to make himself heard he presented
Mrs. G. Gaffe, the best-known lady orator
in the Italian colony, and asked her to say
a few words from the feminine side of the
question.
This young lady, who spoke with re
markable earnestness and conviction,
said, among other things: "Weak of
voice but strong of soul, I bow to the great
populace. Salve! to you, fellow-laborers.
To-day we clasp our hands in eternal fra
ternity. To you, fellow-laborers, I consign
this flag, red with the blood of the popu
lace's martyrs, the symbol of suffering
and of future triumph. To this banner,
the only one in the world that is not a
symbol of tyranny, I solemnly swear love,
fidelity and respect. When the day of
struggle and of vindication shall have
come, this banner will conduct you to
the noble ideal for which we all ardently
sigh."
Another wild burst of applause foil owed
this invocation, after which Gori exhorted
his followers in more elegant phrases,
however, not to "heilo!" till they were
out of the wood. "It is useless to delude
yourselves; you cannot fight in the van-
gnard of a great movement if you are not
ready to make sacrifices. The greatest
bitterness will come to you from those to
whom you wish well and who will not un
derstand you. Buffoons will laugh at
our simple ceremonies, but heed them not,
for you are to work for the future welfare
of humanity. We are an association of
propagandists, not a shop for the dissem
ination of bombs. We can offer you no
hopes of office; you will never become
Senators, Congressmen, not even school
directors. All we can offer you is a dose
of precaution. Oa this banner are written
the words of Dante:
" 'Ognl vilta convien cbe gui sla morta.' "
As these words were pronounced a band
situated in the rear of the hall struck up
the "Marseillaise." SomÂ»* of the audience
applauded wildly, others took up the
strains of the terrible hymn and sang the
refrain, "Aux Armes, Citoyens, Formez
Vos Bataillons, Marchons" (To Arms, Cit
izens, Form Your Battalions, March),
and, with the "Marseillaise" ringing in
their ears, the audience was about to dis
perse, when F. Bairbaris sprang forward
and asked the members of the federation
to express their sense of gratitude for the
propaganda Pietro Gori had made among
them. The response to this was a storm of
applause and "Evvivas!"
In his address, which preceded the in
auguration of the banner Gori summed up
all his argument used in previous lectures
and aimed some special shot at some mem
bers of the Socialistic League who have ac
cused him of being a confusionist. "Your
Order and* Our Disorder" was the title of
his discourse, and he labored to prove that
Governments, by their examples of armed
force, are responsible for all the sin, crime
and misery in the world.
SOME LOCAL CARICATURES.
Gori Puts Members of the Colony
on the Stage.
Pietro Gori exhibited himself in the di
verse characters of playwright, actor, cari
caturist and poet last night in Apollo
Hall.
His purpose drama, "Senza Patria"
(without country) was a touching de
scription of the sorrows inflicted upon an
old ex-Garibaldi soldier who ha 3 become
imbued with the principles of anarchy and
is banished, with his daughter, in his old
age from the country for which he had
spent the best years of his life fighting.
Gori was thoroughly effective and dra
matic as the old soldier, and Airs. Bianci
Gaffe gave a graceful interpretation of the
daughter's role. E. Bonini showed con
siderable dramatic ability as Don Andred,
the kind old village priest, and F. Bar
beris, G. Vezzetto and P. Pedretti were all
good in their respective parts.
It was the "Fantocci Coloniali," how
ever, which proved to be thÂ« sensation of
the evening. These comic sketches, com
posed for the occasion by Pietro Gori, were
skits on some of the leading members of
the colony.
The scene was supposed to pass in the
foyer of a ballroom, witii a number of dis
tinguished officers and other guests danc
ing within. The make-up of the actors,
who kept passing back and forth, was im
mediately recognized. An orator of the
colony, who likes to reduce social ques
tions to "equations," was at once recog
nized in his prototype on the stage. So
were two distinguished "cavalieri," who
wore ribbons and orders and were called
upon by the populace to make speeches.
Among the other characters were a
bright young journalist with a passion for
photography and a gentleman of social
istic tendencies, who strongly disap
proved of anarchists. Taken altogether,
the skits were amusing, without being cal
culated to wound the feelings of those car
icatured. Mrs. Bonini, who .had played
the mother in "Senza Patria," showed her
versatility by giving a sprightly inter
pretation of a masked dancer. The enter
tainment ended by Gori reciting his fine
poem, "Addio a San Francisco."
FIRED AT THE CROWD.
John Holmes, an Intoxicated Sailor,
Discharges His Pistol on the
Water Front.
A drunken sailor with a loaded pistol
and a howling crowd of men and boys at
the Broadway wharf was one of the Sun
day afternoon excitements.
The arrival of the police brought the
circus to an end, not, however, until the
sailor had discharged one shot at a man
named Jackson. The latter imagined, at
least, that the shot was intended for him.
Sailor John Holmes was locked up at the
California-street station, with a charge of
an assault with a deadly weapon against
his name.
TWO SUDDEN DEATHS.
The Bodies of Max tery and James
McCarthy Taken to the Morgue.
Two sudden deaths were reported at the
Coroner's office yesterday. Tne first was
that of Max Levy, aged 58 years, who was
found at 7:30 o'clock in the forenoon at
the residence of his sister, Mrs. Michelson,
1206J4 Turk street, where he had been
stopping for some time. The deceased
had been in poor health for some time
previous, and when found by his nurse,
A. O. McMaster, he was fully dressed and
lying across the bed.
An examination of the body by the
Coroner showed that death had resulted
from apoplexy.
Officer Jennings discovered the dead
body of James McCarthy, aged 38 years, a
horseshoer, in the vegetable market on
Pacific and Front streets at 2 o'clock. It
is supposed that his death resulted from
natural causes, as he had been dissipating
of late.
THEIR SPRING FESTIVAL
Shooting Tournament of the
Grutli Verein Marks
men.
PHILO JACOBY A WINNER.
The Popular Rifle Shot Leads in the
California Schuetzen Club Con
testâShell Mound Park.
There was some lively shooting a t Schuet
zen Park yesterday, although the disa
greeable weather interfered materially
with the attendance. The main event of
the day was the: spring festival of the San
Francisco Grutli Verein Shooting Section.
The marksmen of this organization com
menced shooting at 9:30 a. m., and there
was a goodly attendance of their friends
present to witness their prowess. About
$250 in cash prizes had been hung up, and
this fact proved an incentive to a Dumber
of outsiders, who were freely invited to
enter the match. At 12 o'clock lunch was
served in the park restaurant, on which
occasion impromptu speeches were the
order. Philo Jacoby made the principal
address, in which he highly complimented
the Swiss people, of which the Grutli Ver
ein is composed, for the impetus they had
given to marksmanship over the entire
world.
The Swiss people, he declared, were the
originators of target contests, and it was
mainly due to this fact that they had been
enabled to maintain their liberty against
numerically superior forces. He recounted
an incident after a lamous battle where a
Swiss soldier expressed great chagrin be
cause he had fired fifty shots and had seen
only forty-nine of the enemy drop. In the
afternoon the shooting was continued.
The California Schuetzen Club, the Ein
tracht Schuetzen Club and the ladies of the
California Schuetzen Club also held
matches. The light was excellent, and the
club members showed their afjpreciation
by running up very good scores. The fol
lowing were the winners in the various
contests of the Grutli Verein members'
target: Alf Gehret 70, Robert Hauser 62,

AT SHELL MOUND.
Fairly Good Scores Made in the
Rain and Mist.
For all the rain and the mist yesterday
there were a goodly number of riflemen at
Captain L. Siebe's range at Shell Mound.
Early in the day the light was excellent,
and it was a noticeable feature that those
who shot before 1 o'clock did better
work than they did after that hour. From
about noon there were intermittent show
ers which lasted until dark.
The principal event was the monthly
medal contest of the Red Men's Shooting
Section, and before the targets were closed
fully fifty men fired their scores. TJie
winners and scores were as follows:
Champion class medal, John Zimmermann,
369 rings; rirst-class medal, H. Bach, 369; sec
ond-class medal, P. H. Rulffs, 287; third-class
medal, J. A. Mohr, 242; fourth-class medal, G.
Wagner. 124.
Medal for first best shot, C. G. Bolsdorff, 22;
medal for last best shot, J. A. Mohr, 19.

were on the range and the scores made by
the several comnanies are annexed :

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Purchasers of the Sharpshooter
Find They Own a White
Elephant.
The Monitor Comanche Will Be
Open for Inspection Next Sun
day Morning.
The purchasers of the British bark
Sharpshooter are just beginning to find
out that they have a white elephant on
their hands. The vessel was dismasted in
the Gulf of California and after many
vicissitudes finally reached port in tow of a
Mexican revenue cutter. She was after
ward towed to San Francisco by the tug
Fearless and the trouble over her insur
ance and freight money has not yet been
settled.
Captain Watts tried aeain and again to
come to an understanding with Grace &
Co. and the underwriters, but failed and
finally the bark was sold to the highest
bidder. A syndicate of which J. F. Cun
ninerham and A. P. Lorentzen were the
principals purchased the wreck, but they
now find that instead of $3000 or $4000 for
repairs it will cost all of $9000. When it
came to chipping the rust from the hull it
was found that many of the plates were
worn through and in consequence over
sixty new ones had to be put in. In order
to strengthen the vessel a layer of cobbles
has been laid along her keelson and this
has been cemented over making one solid
mass, which will be hard to dislodge.
When her repairs are completed the
Sharpshooter will appear as a barkentine.
She will be as good as new, but then her
owners could have built a new vessel for
iust about what she haa cost them. Tne
Sharpshooter will take the place of the
schooner Viking in the South Sea Island
trade and Captain Luttrell will probably
go out in command of her.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Umatilla sailed for Puget Sound ports yes
terday with over 270 passengers. Of these
nearly 100 are men bound for the Alaskan
gold fields. Hundreds more are on the
way, and there is bound to be much suf
fering as the ice and snow around Sitka
and Juneau have not yet begun to melt,
and it will be another month before any
body can- make a start for the mines. The
Government officials are well posted as to
the j-easons in the north, and the Secretary
of the Treasury in fixing April 15 as an
early date for the cutters to start for Ber
ing Sea from Port Townsend said it was
the necessity of keeping a clo3e watch on
poachers that entailed such an early de
parture. Half a dozen vessels are now fit
ting out for the mines, and It is safe to say
that over 1000 men will leave San Fran
cisco for the YuUon, without counting
those who will go from Alameda, Fresuo,
Stockton and Sacramento via this port.
The steamer Bouita arrived from south
ern ports yesterday morning. As soon as
her cargo was discharged she was steamed
up to South Vallejo, where she took aboard
300 tons of flour for Newport. The San
Francisco mills are reaching out for the
southern trade, and this will hot be the
last cargo the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company will carry.
The monitor Comanche was visited by
almost every member of the Naval Reserve
yesterday. They were all particularly well
pleased with the vessel, and by next Sun
day will have her ready for inspection. On
that occasion they will run the launch
Amy and the steamer Caroline, besides all
tne boats owned by the battalion. The
usual charge will be made, but in this in
stance the profits will all go into the treas
ury of the Naval Reserve, as its officers
are anxious to raise money enough to put
their steam launch in thorough repair.
During yesterday afternoon a squad of
men from the second company fixed up the
moorings of the monitor and got every
thing shipshape. Three men from the

CRACK PIGEON SHOOTING.
Grassing lave Birds Near Mountain
Viewâ Carroll's Long Shot.
Notwithstanding the inclemency of the
weather yesterday quite a number of pig
eon shooters assembled at Mountain View
to witness a special live-bird shoot, got
up by J. R. Carroll of the Olympic Club.
Although it rained in this City it was
pleasant at the shooting grounds. After
the contests were over the contestants ad
journed to a pretty site under an old oak,
where a grand feast of good tilings was
enjoyed by the rusticators.
During the shoot Fanning scored thirty
four straight, which was considered excel
lent shooting considering the speedy flight
of the birds from the traps. The most as
tonishing event of the day was Carroll's
long shot with a 16-bore Klin. He killed a
fast flying bird dead at seventy-live yards
from the trap, and needless to say that the
gentleman who accomplished this trick
received quite an ovation. The result of
the shoots will be found in the following
scores.

Pet Bear of the Seventeenth Lancers.
There is an excellent photograph in ihe
latest number of the Navy and Army
Illustrated of "Lizzie," the pel, bear of the
Seventeenth Lancers. Of the many regi
mental peta in the army not many, prob
ably, have a more interesting story. Her
mother was shot in Cashmere eight years
ago by Prince Adolphus of Teck, who
brought the cub to Lucknow, where the
regiment was stationed, and gave her as a
present to his troop. Shortly after this
the cub was lost for a year. Then one day
a man came round with a performing bear,
which was recognized as "Lizzie." Since
then "Lizzie" has remained with the Sev
enteenth, with whom she came to England
in 1889. She is a great &et with all ranks,
for her own part reciprocating the affec
tion, specially in favor of Corporal Baker,
her particular guardian. "Lizzie" lives on
bread and milk, jams and fruits, and goes
every day to the canteen for a pint. She
takes no water, and enjoys a swim in the
summer.â Westminster Gazette.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it.it any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted sndw in incbes and buodredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
When the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north' and
south along the coast, rain is probable; but when
the "low" is inclosed with isobars of marked curva
ture rain south of Oregon is improbable. With a
"high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these conditions will produce
an Â©pposite result.

Elk 3lonument in the Elks' Rest at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland, Unveiled Yesterday by
Fr ederick Warde.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
to witness and take part in the unveiling
of the monument and the dedication of
the Elks' Rest.
At noon it looked as though the demon
stration would take place under umbrellas,
but the sunshine and the showers alter
nated during the afternoon and a compar
atively large crowd was attracted to the
cemetery. At times it seemed as if nature
had entered into an alliance with the
speakers to mdke the dedication as impres

being hoisted from the bronze elk a light
shower was falling, but before the stars
and stripes had reached the masthead a
golden beam of Bunshine illuminated it
and brought forth a murmur of approba
tion.
Several times during the eulogy of
Frederick Warde and the oration of
Thomas Clunie tne same thing took place.
When the speakers were referring to
solemn topics there seemed invariably to be.
a cloud overhead, but when they launched
forth on the beauties of fraternal love and
protection the sun peeped out from be
tween the dark layers of nimbus and
seemed very appropriate.
As early as the noon hour Elks began to
congregate at the lodgeroom at Twelfth
and Franklin streets. Among the first to
arrive was Golden Gate Lodge No. 6 of San
Francisco. Among the visitors were: Ex
alted Ruler J. O. Reis, Esteemed Secretary
Knight, H. D. Schlam, Esteemed Loyal
Knight G. Helgard, Secretary J. R. How
eli Treasurer \V. C. Dutton, Esquire J. O.
Hawes. Tiler A. A. Terry. J. V. Peterson,
T. Alexander, C. S. Hoffman, R. J. Pres
ton, J. P. Dunne, A. Perrier, C. W. Kevin
and about sixty other members. Golden
Gate Lodge also brought with them a band
of twenty-five pieces and figured very
prominently in the procession.
Delegates were also present from Ta
coma, Olympia, San Diego, Sacramento,
Stockton, San Luis Obispo, Cincinnati,
Minneapolis, New York City, Fair Haven
(Wash.), Hartford (Conn.), and St. Lpuis.
Five past grand exalted rulers were pres
ent They were: C. W< Nevin, W. C.
Dudley and Ernest Ullman, from Lodge
No. 6; J. H. Tom from No. 218, and
George de Golia from 171.
A preliminary service was held in the
lodgeroom, at "which. Mayor Davie pre
sented the district deputy of California
and Arizona, Ernest Ullman, with the key
to the freedom of Oakland. A brief reply
was made and the procession was formed.
After an escort of police were all the dele
gations from visiting lodges, many of
them in carriages, and all wearing the in
signia of the order. Mayor Davie, Freder
ick Warde, Thomas J. Clunie and the
officers of various lodges and the invited
guests of honor came next. Following
was Oakland Lodge No. 171, which turned
out in great strength. The procession, ac
companied by two bands, and with the
banners of many lodges flying aloft,
marched out to Seventeenth street, and
then proceeded in cars to the cemetery.
The Elks' Rest is one of the prettiest sec
tions of a pretty territory. When the vis
itpjs arrived they found the large elk coy- j
ered with an American flag. The same
decoration was used for the platform,
which was on the south side, facing the
statue.
After Chaplain F. P. McFeely had in
voiced a divine blessingon all present the
ritual service of the Elks was rendered.
The exalted ruler and officers of Oakland !
Lodge and the quartet, composed of Messrs. |
Graham, Smith, W. A. Melvin and Mac
Baine, conducted the service, and their
voices seemed to take on an unusually
solemn a*nd impressive tone as they sun?
the responses, which were echoed back
from the hilis inclosing that vast city of
the dead. When the Rest had been dedi
cated, Miss Flossie Sloper, daughter of Di
rector H_ N. Sloper of the Elks' RÂ«3t As
sociation, walked to the halyards that
were dangling adown the mast that is
placed near the platform. The large flag
over the bronze elk had been so placed
that as the statue was unveiled the flag was
hoisted to the masthead.
"By request of Oakland Lodgetof Elks,"
said Miss Sloper in a firm voice, "I take
great pleasure in unveiling the statue that
is symbolical of charity, justice, brotherly
love and fidelity." As she spoke she
pulled at the hazards and a minute later
the large elk was exposed to view and as
the flag mounted to the top of the staff
the sun subdued the rain and shone glori
ously.
As soon as the flag was clear of the elk
the assembled brethren, with uncovered
heads, sang in harmony the lodge ode :
Great Ruler of the universe,
All seeing and benign,
Look down upon and bless our work,
And be all glory Thine;
Oh ! bless this spot of hallowed earth,
Preserve it as our shrine
Our tribute to departed worth
For "Auld Lang Syne."
Very impressive, full of meaning and
strikingly artistic was the scene in Moun
tain View Cemetery while the ode was be
ing sung. The 'gathering around the
statue sang with uncovered heads. On
the right side of the silent elk that looked
down upon the people shone the sun upon
the sparkling drops of rain, with which
the noble animal had just been baptized ;
overall, presenting a marKed contrast to
the gloomy sky, the brilliant colors of Old
Glory flew out in the fresh breeze as the
hundreds of voices ascended yet higher to
the throne of the Great Exalted Ruler of
the Universe, and on all sides were the
white tombstones marking the last resting
places of thousands who have gone before.
Brother Thomas J. Clunie of Sacramento
Lodge No. 328 delivered the oration. Ho
said:
If I had my way we wouia have no silent
cities; the good would live forever, and the
bad would never be born. But the supreme
exalted ruler of universe has decreed that
all must die, and from nis decrees there is no
appeal; hence, the exercises of to-day. .' ; ;
The embarrassment that I feel in attempting
to speak to you Is more than compensated by
the pleasure that we shall have in listening to
the eloquent remarks of Brother Frederick
Warde, upon whose shoulders the mantle of
Booth has surely fallen. Busy with tho ardu
ous duties of his noble profession and his well
known efforts in behalf of ' "sweet charity,"
1 with not an idle moment on his hands, yet, at
the call of his brother Elks, Frederick Warde,
whose ability is recognized wherever civiliza
tion exists, and whose burning eloquence has
excited the admiration of the world, threw
aside the cares of life, and comes here to do his
duty as an Elk.
The founders of our beloved order belonged
to a profession that for more than two thou
sand years has entertained, educated and up
lifted humanity. In its early struggles for ex
istence its enemies jeered at It, because the
little band that composed its membership
wished rather to worsnip at the shrine of pe
nius than at the altar of the god of Mammon.
Unjust and ungenerous imputations were cast
upon our order, but I am nappy to say to-day
that we have outlived their reproaches, and
have grown. I believe, Brother Warde, from a
little lodgerooin ten feet square, in the city of
New York, until the home of tho Elks can be
found in every city of the United States.
Our ceremonies and our principles have a
common origin with- those of other kindred
societies. We have the same grand natural
truths witn them, the same splendid resolu
tions. It is entirely natural that -this should
be so, because we have sipped words of wisdom
from the same well, and we regard history,
with its magnificent examples, its glorious
illustrations, as the common property of all. .
' We are friends of religion, but we do not be
lieve that all goodness is confined to the sa
cred precincts of the churches, and, while -we
accord to them great credit for the good that
they have done and are doing lo<r the world,
we claim for our order its full share in insur
ing the welfare of humanity and ameliorating
the human sorrows that mankind i 9 heir to.
The PÂ»iblo is our sheet-anchor, the welfare of
humanity our hearts' greatest desire; next to
that come the works of the immortal. Shakes
peare, the great educator of modern times, the
man whose golden â  sentences are engraven
upon mankind.
And what shall I say of this band of brothers
comprising the membership of Oakland Lodge,
who have paid this beautiful , tribute to the
memory .of their : departed brothers? We all
share in the feelings that have triven birth to
this magnificent monument â not a cumbrous,
curiously cut stone, that time shall shatter and
future ages be unable to decipher; not a cold,
forbidding mausoleum, indicative of death and
decayâ that beautiful elk, emblematic of
our order. .
What could be more beautiful? Majestic in
carriage, swift of foot, with an eye as soft and
beautiful as the morning, timid . and shy as a
maiden, incapable of doing harm, yet firm in
the maintenance of its rights. The entabla
ture on -which it is placed shows that our de
par brothers are not forgotten by the mem
naxs oi Ue lodge, â We uope that Uie sunshine' ,

of peace will rest upon it forever and that a
glance at the Elks' Rest will furnish a key that
will unlock the noblest feelings of the human
heart.
The quartet sang "The Eye That Never
Sleeps/ after which Brother Frederick
Warde of St. Louis Lodge No. 9 pronounced
the eulogy. Mr. AVarde said:
The proper and appropriate disposition of
the dead has been from time immemorial an
honored custom in all countries, in all climes,
in all communities, in all ages.
The ancient Egyptians, who held the burial
of their dead as a very sacred duty, wrapped
them in bands of linen, inclosed them in per
fumes and spices and laid them away in the
grim vaults that were afterwards raised to
pyramids.
The aboriginal sometimes places his dead In
the limbs of some tall tree, or here the
original Inhabitant of this country erected
platforms upon which they placed their dead.
So that at all times the most reverent love land
care has been directed to their disposition.
It is an inherent human trait to pay respect
and esteem to the body and the spirit of the
departed. The great soldier, the statesman,
the poet, is carried to a grand cathedral,
whose lifted dome and pinnaclo pierces the
air, and with appropriate ceremonies is buried
within the chancel of that sacred pile.
The prince and the king, with all the pomp
and circumstance of majesty and pride, is laid
within his coffined rest with magnificent
ceremonial; the peasant who has passed away
is carried to the village church, and with the
simple burial service of his church is laid to
rest in "God's acre," where "each in his nar
row cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of
the hamlet sleep."
The sailor who passes away at sea is rever
ently wrapped within his country's flag and
committed to the deep, where the crested
wave is his monument and the everlasting
surge his requiem.
The soldier that dies upon the field of battle,
or dies in the discharge of his duty, is carried
upon a gun-carriage to his grave; if he is a
cavalryman, his horse marches behind him,
and over his remains his comrades fire a fare
well volley.
So each have their ceremonial of interment,
but we, as brother Elks, have chosen this
beautiful spot to place our dead. Here, upon
this rising ground, where the gentle breezes
from the Pacific pass sweetly over it, where
the sun gently kisses it in the morning, and,
ere it bids t li v world good night, leaves a gentle
loving kiss behind.
Here is no majestic Abbey, no grand resting
place for monarcbs, but in a sweet, gentle
simple spot, protected by these beautiful trees
on one side, these grand old hills upon^he
other, we reverently lay our dead to rest with
simple ceremony, but with hearts that go with
them into the silent tomb.
And, brothers and friends, here may they
reet. May the flowers bloom sweetly o'er their
graves; may their perfume be an incense to
accompany iheir souls to heaven above; may
the stars that look down upon them in the
silent watches of the night protect their
Bpirits from harm, and may this monument
that stands above them, emblematical of the
sentiments that were held to them in life,
continue to them in death. As a silent sen
tinel he stands, an emblem of fidelity, charity
and brotherly love, with the flowers of charit
and those plants that entwine themselves to
gether, symbolical of brotherly love. Sweet
be their rest, gently may the rain from heaven
fall upon their graves. Perfect be their repose,
and may the peace of God that passeth all un
derstanding be with them and remain with
them now and forevermore. Amen.

In spite of the threatening weather, a
big crowd of coursing enthusiasts assem
bled at Ocean View Park yesterday and
witnessed coursing the quality of which
was far above the average.
The crowd was in a betting humor, and
the winning of several shortenders at 5
and 6to 1 made the speculation lively. A
phenomenal dog made his appearance in
King Carlo, who, at 6 to 1, beat Mascot
almost pointless. Maud G's defeat of
Captain Morse also hit the talent ham.
Toward the close of the day the favorites
won with great regularity, and revived the
flagging spirits oi the long-and players.

HOW ALAMEDA STARTS OUT
A Presidential Campaign Begins
With a Republican
Rupture.
MARKS OF MYSTERY SOLVED.
Why There Is No Star "13" Among
tlie Members of the Oakland
Police Force.
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 15. f
The stanch Republicans of Alameda
Countyâ those whose party fealty excels
their personal desiresâ are expressing un
qualified regret that at the outset of a
Presidential campaign there should be a
schism in the ranks. It has been hoped
for nearly two years that under the Na
tional war cry of the campaign of '96 the
many dissatisfied elements of the Kepub
lican party in this county would coalesce
and win for Alameda the banner which
was carried, draped in black, to Los An
geles two years ago. Local jealousies and
numerous internal dissensions have broken
the Republican party into numerous
cliques to such an extent that, although
the prevailing Republican majority is not
less than 4000, the highest offices are now
held by Populists, whose luck was entirely
due to the warfare in the ranks of the old
parties. The Republican party being so
disorganized everybody hoped thac this
year would witness a return of the wander
ers to the ranks. Now it seems they are
to be disappointed. There was more than
enough Baid at last night's meeting, and
after the meeting of the district Congres
sional members, to show plainly that the
campaign starts out with a divided front.
The present trouble presents many sides
to the intelligent observer. It centers on
who shall go to St. Louis to represent this
section. Senator Denison wants to go,
and ex-Mayor George C. Pardee also wants
that honor. There is much to be said in
favor of both men. Denison has always
been an unswerving Republican, and has
spent money freely for the success of the
Earty; consequently he has a large num
er of friends. Pardee has earned honors
in local politics and is above suspicion in
all that he has undertaken. Either would
honor the party at St. Louis. But the
tight is between the respective factions
that are supporting the two men. In this
respect Senator Denison is at a disadvan
tage. Many politicians who live in his
district, and who would "queer" a political
angel, flock around Denison, announce
that they are "out" for him, and do him
more harm than a hundred reputable sup
porters can do good. Yet these hang
ers-on present such a plausible proof of
their claims to the right to tight under the
Senator's banner that Denison would be
accused of ingratitude by one-half of the
Sarty were he to disclaim them. This is
is misfortune rather than his fault.
Dr. Pardee has no such element to bear
him down. If he remains in the political
arena long enough he will undoubtedly
have the same enervating influence to
contend against, as it prows in each suc
cessive campaign and never decreases.
Denison's friends want the committeemen
to name the men who snail elect a St.
Louis delegate. Pardee's supporters want
primaries, and although a compromise
motion was worked through last night to
day the breach is wider than ever. It is
under such unfavorable conditions that
Alameda County starts out on a Presi
dential campaign.
The mysterious markings on the sides of
doors throughout Oakland that caused
much interest during the past two days
appear not to be a very simple affair. Con
sidering the ominous importance attached
to it, the sequel may be considered humor
ous. The markings are interesting, un
doubtedly, and even after the following
explanation they will still remain mysteri
ous, except to those in the secret. They
are somewhat of a directory of what the
residents are worth, how many children
are of school age and in what direction the
literary tastes of the inmates tend. The
marks, it has been ascertained, were left
in some instances by deputy assessors
making inquiry of personal property; in
others the offenders have been the school
census marshal. Quite a large number of
the marks have been made by the news
paper carriers, and tramps and canvassers
have supplied the remainder. Judging
from the appearance of the marks, many
of them have been made for months anil
few are really new. There was apparently
no foundation for the chargeÃ and counter
charges that the marking was done by
rival secret societies, as the same marks
were found on the residences of people
wno are opposed to each other in all such
matters. The roost significant point in
connection with the whole mattor is that
such an apparently simple thing should
create such sudden general interest.
Superstition is rife in the Oakland po
lice force, and at present there is no one
willing to wear star 13. The circumstance
is not an accident but is due to a very pro
nounced aversion to wear the number that
is proverbially unlucky. The hostility to
the star originated with Policeman Sill
about a year ago. For some trivial matter
Sill was called before the commissioners.
His examination was set for the 13th day
of the month, and Sill remarked that it
would not be an easy matter to forget the
dateâ he had only to look at his star. The
day came, and as Sill was in the board
room a fire alarm was sounded. Sill
counted the blasts carefully and turned
pale as a ghost when he heard that the
alarm was from box 13. Sill made up
his mind that 13 was his hoodoo and de
cided at once to have a change, made.
When he told of his trouble to Captain
Fletcher, Sill said : "For Policeman 13 to
be before the commissioners on the 13th
day of the month, while the lire alarms
blow out box 13, is altogether too much."
Sill surrendered his star and has since
been known as number 45.
When Officer Stokes was made a per
manent policeman he pooh-poohed the
idea of there being any hoodoo about star
13 and signified his desire to wear it. He
was accommodated and proudly carried
the emblem of superstition for a few
months. A few weeks ago charges were
made aerainst him and Stokes is no longer
on the force, having been dismissed. Now
no one will wear the star, and although
there is every other number in useuo to
50 there is no 13 in the local force.
.; , An officer of the Salvation Army made
a very significant remark this week in con
nection with the cleaning out of the deni
zens of Morton â  street, Â» in San ; Francisco.
"Some time ago', 1 ; said the officer, "we
tried to rent a hall near St. Mary's street.
"We were about to close a deal ; with â  the
agent when he ; said we ' : could have it on
such terms were : mentioned only if_we
promised one â -thing.* I asked what it was
and he replied, 'That you do not hold any
meetings : near ; St. Mary J street, because
we can onLy rent = those houses to a certain:
class and we do not \ want any of them to
remain emDty.' â¢ ' From i present prospects
it looks as though the agent would now be
| glad to rent to anybody." . :S. W. B. ; .

',-.' r ' â  - ; ness Man. .â â¢':'â 'â '"}' :
.; OAKLAND, Cal., March 15. â Jacob
gamm, the founder of the milllDg firm of
Westphal & Samm, died at Los Angeles yes
terday. The deceased was engaged in
business in this city for a quarter of a cen
tury, and stood very hign in the com
mercial world. He was an ardent sup-
Dorter of several German societies. About
two years ago Mr. Samm went to Los
Angeles to try and regain his health, which
had been poor for a long time. He sold
his interest in the milling business to his
partner, Mr. Westphal, for $70,080.
Mr. Samm's illness toot a serious turn
recently, and the marriage of his two
daughters was postponed in consequence.
Friday, his illness became worse, and
Saturday he died. Mr. Samm was about
55 years of age and was always very active.
He leaves considerable property, a large
portion of which is Oakland realty.
Wanted as Curios.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â Abe Ma
jors, the boy burglar, has sent to his
mother a disaffirmation of the assignment
he made to Attorney Ned Ayers of the
pistols and burglar tools found on him
when arrested. Majors has also sent his
mother an assignment of all his earthly
possessions. She has handed it over to
G. W. Npvin. Attorney O'Brien, repre
senting Mrs. Wiilmore, has joined issues
with Nevin to beat the claim of Attorney
Josephs, who has brought a replevin suit
to decide the ownership of the burglars'
outfit. It is conceded on all sides that the
goods are not worth much in themselves,
but it is said that they are valuable as
relics, hence the struggle for possession.
Rev. Mr. Hudelson Speaks.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â Rev. B. F.
Hudelson, State President of the A. P. A.,
introduced local politics into his lecture
at Elite Hall thi9 afternoon. The speaker
said tbat the position of the Congressional
district in regard to this county is ridicu
lous and un-American. "It is all non
sense for six men to get together and say
who shall appoint the men who shall
nominate the next President. We all want
a hand in it, and we all intend to have a
hand in it. Onr cry is, 'America for
Americans,' and when a handful of men,
more or less responsible, get the idea that
they can dictate to a community it is
time it is stopped." The speaker's re
marks were loudly applauded.
St. Patrick's Day.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 15.â The class
of ' 96 of St. Mary's College will hold a St.
Patrick's Day /celebration at the colicee on
Monday evening. There will be orations
and poems by the class poet. The college
quartet will also appear on the programme
and a first-class entertainment is promised.
The exercises commence at 7:30 p. m.
ACTION OF LAW STUDENTS
The Senior Class of Hastings
Will Not Graduate at
Berkeley.
A Call for Citizens to Register to Vote
on School Bondsâ Baseball
Trophy.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 15.â The
decision not to come to Berkeley for
graduation, which was taken yesterday by
the senior class of the Hastings Law
College, growing out of the disposition of
the Berkeley ftlumoi to exclude graduates
of the Affiliated Colleges from full privileges
of the University Alumni Association, has
Riven rise to much comment among both
graduates and undergraduates on this side
of tne bay. The prevailing opinion among
those who arc in attendance at the Berke
ley colleges'seems to be th*t graduates of
1 the purely technical departments of the
university, such as the colleges of law,
medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and vet
erinary surgery, should not be accorded
the same privileges in the Alumni Asso
ciation as those who have spent four years
in the academic course and three in the
professional.
President Kellogg was interviewed to
day with reference to the action taken by
the law college men, and stated that he
did not attach much importance to their
proceeding, as what they had done was a
matter for the Alumni Association to look
after and a question between themselves
and the faculty o' tnc law college.
"The Academic Council at Berkeley,"
said he. "will probably take no band in
the affair, but will leave it for the faculty
of the law college to consider. We have
too many things of our own over here to
look after to take up such questions. It
has only been the custom of the law col
lege graduates for the past two years to
come to Berkeley for their' diplomas, so
that if they do not come this year no very
great breach of precedent will be made." *
The alumni have oeen considering for
some time past the proposition of ad
mitting the graduates of the Affiliated
Colleges to part of the rights and privi
leges that have been accorded the gradu
ates of the academic department, but no
definite conclusion seems to have been ar
rived at.
Citizens Urged te Resistor.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 15.-P. R.
Boone, president of the Board of Educa
tion, has issued a circular letter appealing
to the citizens of Berkeley to register in
time to vote on the school bond proposi
tion, the election for which will be held on
April 4. According to the law every citi
zen who desires to vote at the election
roust register fifteen days prior to the date
set for it. The amount to be voted for at
this election is $00,000. which will be ex
pended in the erection of and equipment of
two new buildings in the High School
district. March 19 will be the last day on
which citizens who desire to vote at* the
coming election can register.
Phi Delta Theta Banquet.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 15.â The

Blue and Gold Concert.
BERKELEY, Cal,, March 15.â 0n
Thursday evening, March 19, the class of
'97 will give a coucert in Stiles Hall for the
bonetit of its annual, the Blue and Gold.
The glee club will sing, and Charles Par
cells '95 will be the violinist. The others
who will take part are Miss Evelyn Henry,
mezzo-soprano; Mrs. Louise Humphrey-
Smith, dramatic reader, and Miss Hilda
Newman, pianist.
Hitherto the Blue and Gold has re
ceived a part of the proceeds from the
theater party on Thanksgiving night, but
the present class has not had this assist
ance, so it is forced to raise the necessary
money in some other way.

ning the championship baseball game yes
terday and the silver cup which goes with

Municipal Ownership league.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 15.â There was
not a large attendance at the meeting held
Saturday" night at Linderman's opera
house, to form a municipal ownership
league, having for its object the furthering
of the idea of municipalities acquiring,
owning and operating their own light and
water systems. Petitions had been circu
lated for the call, but only a small per
centage of those who signed came to the
meeting. The object or the organization
is to create a public sentiment to justify
the large expenditures that have been
made and are now being made on the city's
electric light system. City Clerk Lamborn
is one of the prominent movers, as is also
Chairman Forderer of the Municipal
Board. Others prominent in the move
ment are B. C. Brown, N. J. Mauson, W.
M. Cuberv, Green Majors and Dr. G. A.
Moore. A. A. Dennison of Oakland ad
dressed the gentlemen assembled. Another
meeting will be held in the near future, to
complete organization. It is the purpose
to induce other municipalities to form
similar leagues.
Anna Shaw and Bob Bardette.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 15.â Alameda
during the week will listen to lectures from
two people of world-wide reputation. On
Wednesday evening at Linderman Opera
house Rev. Anna Shaw wilt talk aoout
"The Coming Man," under the auspices of
the Political Equality Club. On Saturday
evening at the same place Robert J. Bur
dette will lecture at the same house under
the management of the Baptist society.
A Club's Entertainment.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 15.â The En
cinal Yacht Club will formally open its
season on the 18th prox. with a vaudeville
entertainment at its clubhouse. The com
mittee on entertainments has fixed the
dates for all the parties for the ensuing
year. They will be as follows: May 22,
August 21, Septemeer 18, November '20,
January 15, 1897. and February 19. The
social feature of the club is now greater
than the nautical feature.
Poor Acoustics.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 15.â There is
plenty of room in the new City Hall for
everybody who is entitled to an official
habitat therein. The council-rooms and
the courtroom are especially large and the
ceilings lofty, so much so that the acous
tics are bad. It is difficult to hear the pro
ceedings of the Municipal Board while sit
ting without the rail. There is some talk of
correcting this, especially as to the court
room, by the stretching of wires.
THE DAY AT THE PARK
Sutro's Baths Were Well At
tended in Spite of the
Rain.
Music and an Entertaining Aquatic
Programmeâ Work at the
Museum.
In consequence of the W3ather yesterday
Golden Gate Park was almost deserted.
There was no music, the drives were va
cant except for a half a dozen yonng cy
clers, who seemed to enjoy the mud.
However, John McLaren, the superintend
ent, was happy.
"This is a glorious rain," said he, "just
what we needed at this time. Yesterday
afternoon the men finished planting a lit
tle forest of trees on the artificial hill south
of the grand court, which is to serve as a
break wind, when down came this gentle
rain which will invigorate the trees."
Considerable work has been done in the
court in the past week. A large number of
tall shade trees have been set out and
when they are in foliage they will furnish
ample shade for those who will gather un
der them to listen to the music.
The grounds around the new lodge are
being laid out by the gardeners and the de
signers will make them very attractive.
Some of the trees that stand in front and
obstruct the view of the main driva will be
cut down.
Work on the annex to the museum has
been delayed on account of the strike
which has been on several days. This de
lays the inside work. As soon as it is fin
ished the work of placing the new exhibits
in. position will be commenced under the
suggestion* of Director-General de Young,
who is expected home this week.
Travel to the ocean beach in the fore
noon was very light. In the afternoon the
cars of all the lines were carrying many
passengers, all bound for the entertain
ment in the Sutro Baths. During the
afternoon there was, considering the day.
a very good attendance off spectators and
bathers. Up to 4 o'clock over four hun
dred had robed themselves in bathing suits
and tested the temperature of the clear,,
invigorating water from the ocean. Colonel
T. P. Robinson had provided a pleasing
programme, which was given between 1
and' 3 o'clock. It was an exhibition by
members of the Olympic Club and in
cluded a 100-yard race, water polo, tub
race, candle "race, spring-board diving,
trapeze diving and high diving.
During the afternoon tbe spectators were
greeted with delightful music by Cassasa's
Exposition Band, choice and popular selec
lions being rendered until 5 o'clock.
In the evening the baths were brilliantly
illuminated wim electric lights and there
was given an exhibition of fancy swim
ming and diving by members of the Olym
pic Club and the Pacific Swimming Club.
There was also a grand concert by Cassa
sa's Band.
There will not be any performance to
night, but there will be a gala night to
morrow, when a special programme in
honor of the day will be offered.
On account of the moisture the Haight
street grounds were not opened yesterday.

ARRIVAL OF A
NATIONAL LEADER
The Advent of General
John S. Clarkson in
San Francisco.
THE CAMPAIGN OUTLOOK
McKinley Shows the Greatest
Strength at the Present
Time.
ALLISON WILL BE THE MAN.
â He Comes From the West and Is the
Man Toward Whom the Pacific
Coast Must Look.
General John S. Clarkson arrived here
yesterday afternoon from Los Angeles.
He is here neither as the Republican
Jeader he is conceded to be, nor as a man
â¢who is looking for a chance to make profit
able realty investments.
He has taken quarters at the Palace
Hotel with State Senator William 11.
Anderson and Major E. M. Ford, two
Eastern friends, and they propose, while
they stay here a few days, to enjoy the
glorious climate before returning to the
Eastern snows.
General Clarkson is a man of strong in
dividuality and of personal magnetism.
Twenty-four years ago he was a reporter
en one of the newspapers of Dcs Moines.
He has risen ever since steadily to the*
jMnacle where he stands to-day. He is a
gerious man and is thoroughly an Ameri
can. His ideas are clean cut and cannot
be misunderstood.
That b.6 is broad can be seen from his
views of the coming political campaign.
He believes that the West js fully entitled
to the recognition the .East has had, and
that a Cabinet position in the next admin
istration should be granted the Pacific
Coast.
In speaking of the political situation,
General Clarkson said:
"The strong men in the Presidential race
are McKinley, Reed and Allison. The
strong probabilities are Quay. Morton, I
Cullom, Davis, Manderson and Bradley. !
McKinley is at present in the lead and will
lead on the first ballot. My judgment is
Allison will lead on the last ballot and in
lowa we prefer the lead of that ballot. The
McKinley people are confident. They have
called their conventions on certain ground,
or what they deeuned certain ground, ear
liest and got before the country with a i
boom and a hippodrome movement. The I
other candidates are going along more I
easily, organizing their lines and getting
delegates. It is the delegates that will nom
inate the President, and practical men
want practical things. My own judgment
is that Senator Allison of lowa, having a
strong affirmative support at the
Btart, without enmities. with an
â¢unblemished record, with the universal
acquiescence in his fitness for the office, is |
so strong in second choice that he will win,
for it is going to be a second choice nom
ination. Allison is a strong candidate be
cause he is a broader candidate than Mc-
Kinley. McKiDlev lias made a record on
the tariff. Allison is as great in hiÂ« in
formation and ability as to the tariff as I
McKinley, and has qualifications in his j
thirty years in Congress and on the Ways ;
and sleans Committee of the House and
over twenty years on the Finance Commit
tee of the Senate, in resard to financial
matters, that McKinley has not and that
no other man in the country except Alli
son has, with the exception of John Sher
man. I think he is stronger, too, because I
he is the westernmost candidate among
the probabilities. The majority of the
Nation is in the Mississippi Valley. It
has the power to nominate. It has in Al
lison a man fit for the Presidency in his
own ability, ripened and strong
by over thirty years in Congress,
giving him such an acquaintance
"with all National interests as very
â¢iew men in tmbiic life now have. We can
elect anybody we nominate this year. We
can elect some men more easily than
others, and some men can thus give the
Darty the very largest insurance of success.
Jly judgment is tdat the strongest man is
the one who is strongest on most ques
tions â not the statesman of one idea, but
a man who is strong and well informed on
all the present issues, and also strong for
the creation of new issues, the re-enforce
ment of the strength of his party and the
re-enforcement of the strength of the
Nation. In my opinion Allison, because
of his long public experience, fulfills these I
requirements. I have no wish to dis- i
parage the greatness of McKinley, for he
is very great, but tie has achieved his
reputation on one idea and 3long one
line. Reed is one of the masterful and
very great men of the Nation and
would make a great President. So
would Governor Morton. Senator Quay,
who is in my judgment the ablest man in
actual ability and possessing the best use
of his ability of any man in public life,
would also niaKe a strong President, ren
dering great service to the country and
greatly strengthening his party. Senator
JDavis will be fqun-1 to have the equipment
of statesmanship for the office if he reaches
it. Senator of Illinois, contem
poraneous with Lincoln, one of the ablest
men in public life, would,make a safe and
popular President. The field is rich with |
candidates of worth, and the party has a
great reserve of material nearly or fully as
good, if it should be necessary to call upon j
it at St. Louis."
"Are you in this country in the interest
of Senator Aliison ?"
"1 am not. I am visiting the coast on
business. I am not averse to talking of
the Presidential matter, as it is the topic |
of greatest public interest and political J
consequence at the present time."
â¢What is the extent of your personal ac
quaintance? Are you belter known with
Allison or McKinley than Reed!"
"I know them all alike, in lowa we
have none of the disposition that is mani
fested by some of the candidates of preju
dice in regard to favorite sons. We con
cede the right of every Htate to present a
candidate. We feel that any State has
the same right to present a dandi
date that lowa ha?, and we have
none of the disposition of Onio in this
canvass, which seems to resent the liberty
and the right of any State that wishes to
present a candidate. We believe that the
party should De left to the freest choice. I
nave neither a request to make nor advice
to pive to California Republicans. They
know the field uf National politics, They
Highest of all in Leavening Power. â Latest U. S. Gov't Report

know the interests of every State. They
know these candidates as well or better
than I. I can only say in broad
terms that I hope the Republicans of Cali
fornia and of every other State will send
strong men to the St. Louis convention
unpledged and uninstructed. In lowa we
never have instructed our delegates. We
did not on Wednesday last, when we
elected our twenty-six delegates to St.
Louis. We do not believe it wisdom for
any State to go to the convention pre
judged and precommitted. A National
j convention is a National conference. The
| Republicans from the certain States and
the Republicans from the hopeless Demo
cratic States should confer with the Re
publicans from the doubtml but necessary
States before deciding who will be the
strongest candidate and command the
votes necessary to win. California, a great
and splendid State, the Empire State of
the coast, can group about it the smaller
: States and Territories around it and go
into the St. Louis convention with a power
as great as that wielded by any other
great section of the country, if
it shall go unrestricted to act for
j its own interests and for the
I interests of the party. California, if
j I were free to pay it, has been too generous
| with its power heretofore. It has generally
| given it freely out of hand, committed
itself to someone, and bravely ffone down
with him. and made no terms if it suc
ceeded. 1 ara^ thorough Westerner; have
enough interest in California and the West
ern and mountain States to wish to see
them bear their part in National politics.
There is no need of a LState which is
sovereign in the party as well as the Na
tion giving away its power. California
and its sister States on the coast can go to I
this convention, can sit down at the coun
cil table, help in selecting the candidate
and help in making the platform, and at
the same time make sure that its power
will be continuing, that it will have a
potential part in the conduct of the cam
paign, that it will have a potential part
and its own representation in the
National administration if the ticket is
elected. The general Government is more
necessary and more helpful to the new
or Western States than to the Eastern. The
Eastern and Middle States are largely fin
ished communities, and the General Go
vernment has little to do with them. In all
the Western States, with tlmr resources
undeveloped, with their public works un
completed, with their destiny as yet
merely hinted at, the General Government
is more necessary. Take the great ques
tion of irrigation, which has been sug
j gested to my mind by two or three days'
ride through the desert. Take the ques
tion of the Nicaragua canal, the faie of
which will be decided for this generation
in the next four years of the incoming ad
ministration. These and many other
questions are of vital concern to the West.
The Nicaragua canal means a water route
for your people and for Oriental trade
10,000 miles shorter to New York. A
Western man, such a man as Senator
Allison, who lives on the banks of the
Mississippi River, who has aided in the
improvement of that great river until the
sea can bring its ships now to lowa
towns on the river, can see that with
this canal and the improvement of the
Mississippi St. Louis, for instance, can be
made as good a seaport as New York, and
even Chicago, with the Hennepin canal
constructed, can be made as good a seaport
as Boston, Eastern men or Presidents
with Eastern sympathies would not strive
to serve this canal and these other im
provements as Western men would. A
Western President, fully informed as to
Western needs and ambitions and in .sym
pathy with its people, it would seem to me.
would be far preferable to California and
all other Western States to any Eastern I
man."
"Is the popular cry for McKinley not an
evidence of his superiority as a candi
date?"
"The best answer to that is to cite re
cent history in the party. I do not con
cede, however, at the start that McKinley
lias an actual -popularity with the masses
of thinking people over either Allison or
Reed. There is an excitement in his sup
port that may be taken for such popular
ity. We have had many proofs in America
that a popular idol in a party is generally
the weakest candidate at the polls. A
popular idol always creates a faction in
his party. Often it has 80 and even 90 per
cent of the members of the party in it,
but inevitably he always creates a faction
of antagonism, and the smaller this mi
nority faction is, inevitably the more bit-
THE SAN, FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 1896.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
I ter and intense it is. I was one of the men
! that stood for fifteen or twenty years with
the most splendid men of California and
! of every other 'Western State cherishing
i t he one ambition to see Mr. Blame Presi-
I dent. We finally succeeded in nominating
I him, but he failed because of factional dif
' feiences and enmities in his own party of
j carrying enough votes to carry the doubt-
I ml State, and so the party failed and
Blame with it, to xhe sorrow of the whole
Nation and to the great grief of all of us
who followed his flag. The strong candidate
is tbe one who has the least enmities. In
I this campaign every protectionist will vote
for the Republican candidate, whoever he
is. For it is the party itself that is the
champion of protectionâ not any one man.
If McKinley had not lÂ«en in the Congress
that enacted the McKinley bill the bill
i would have been just as strong for pro
| tection. We are all for tariff. It is the
{ settled American policy. We are all for
high tariff, we may say. bnt for my part
I want to see it as high in the West as it
! is in the East, and tbe next tariff will be
\ one, in my judgment, which will care as
I much for Western and Southern interests
:as for Eastern. The fault of the late
. tariff was that it cared more for Eastern
j schedule?, made too high a tariff for the
j East and too low for the West. The new
tariff will not be one letting the Western
i farmer's wool go into the Eastern manu
facturer's machine free-trade wool but come
out protected cloth. It will be a tariff
| which will protect the farm and mine of the
! West and the plantation of the South
| as mnch as the factories of the East.
i The American farmer, far more than the
! American manufacturer, must be the one
most to be benefited by the new tariff when
i the Republican party comes into power.
j The greatest statesmanship now de
! nianded is not to provide a tariff, for that
is an easy and clear thing to do ; but we do
want a statesmanship that will put more
American shipping on the seas and find
larger markets for the surplus products of
American farms and factories. We also
want a statesmanship that will make of
this whole continent a home market, and
through reciprocity establish such rela
tions with the South American States
that we shall handle and control their
commerce instead of England. Reciproc
ity, by the way, the greatest part of the
McKinloy bill, was the work of Blame, and
not of McKinley. I was in Washington
in that year, when the great Blame was
carrying reciprocity around like a found
ling in his arms, trying to get somebody
in Congress to adopt it. McKinley was
unwilling to accept it as a part of his bill.
I was present at many interviews between
Blame and Allison. Allison favored it
from the lirst, and finally he and Aldrich
took it up and led to the end of having it
adopted in the McKinley bill."
"What has been Mr. Allison's attitude
on the funding bill for Pacific railroads?
What are his opinions on it?"
"I do not know his views on the funding
bill. I have never discussed it with him.
I know that lowa, the State which Allison
has controlled in its politics for nearly
forty years, was pioneer in the control of
railways, and has to-day the most radical
and systematic railway law of any State
in the Union. All the* schedules are fixed
by the State Railway Commissioners, who
are elected by the people, and Allison has
always followed out, by snch evidence as
the interstate commerce act and all others
so far as I remember, the lowa policy of
rigid public control of railway and all cor
porations."
"There is no question in your mind but
that a Republican will be elected ?"
"Well, I am confident of that."
"And in your opinion, while you are not
advocating the nomination of Mr. Allison
more than you are anybody else, you be
lieve he would be the better man to
choose?"
"My belief is that the St. Louis conven
tion will make a platform so wise and
practical and choose a candidate sowoithy
that our success will be certain. My pref
erence is for Allison as the more available
man, but I believe we can elect any of the
men who are discussed, or any man likely
to be chosen. We have more than the
strength of the Republican party to insure
this. We have the tremendous power of
the great National desire to get back to
eood times; and that peculiar feeling that
has always existed in the American re
public â a feeling which demands a chance
to bring good timesâ will this time operate
to the advantage of the Republican party,
as it has at times heretofore operated
against it. We shall poll our full strength
as a party, and have the Democratic re
enforcement or help of many Democrats
in the hope that a change from the present
condition will bring good times."
"In the event of Allison getting the
nomination, what do you think would be
the chances of the coast as to Cabinet and
other positions?"
"I should say to that that Allison would
do wivat Harrison ought to have done in 1889
âgiven the coiÂ»st, this great region that
lias so many interests over which the Gov
ernment has control, and which has such
a lur^e population iv the several States,
representation in the Cabinet. Of course,
I have no right to speak for anybody, but
I have my own record to say that 1 have
advocated for many years that the coast
should always have a representative in the
I Cabinet. It is remote from the General
I Government, nearly every interest that it
has is affected by ihe action of the
General Government, and it has never had
.such representation m the Cabinet and in
! the Government bureaus at Washing
ton as it was entitled to have and as the
Government itself wa9 entitled for it to
have. 1 was in the Government service at
Washington, in the Postofh'ce Department.
It is a fact to bn learned there that the
W r est, new, grovung, developing, does not
have the immediate recognition, the fos
tering support, the governmental facilities,
given to it that it requires and justly
needs. The older States are finished.
They have their postal service
and their other Government ser
vices perfected nearly. Yet it is true
that when a great appropriation passes
Congress, say in the postal service, nine
tenths of which ought to be devoted to
getting fast mails and larger mail service
west of the Missouri River, it never reaches
that good object, but is dissipated in im
provements that are not needed in the
older States. I would say that the coast,
or the sixteen or seventeen States west of
the Missouri River, should mas 3 their
power and go into the St. Louis conven
tion and bear a potential part; that it can
with such a power back of it, both in
choosing the candidate, in making the
platform and in not surrendering itsj>ower
then, make sure that it will be continued
and recognized in the appointment to the
powerful public places at Washington of
enough of its people to make sure that the
administration will be fully informed as to
all the needs and rights of every one of these
Western States, and the administration
itself enough informed to greatly improve
its service in all its departments in these
States. This is what the Eastern States
do. They never give away their power as
a Christmas gitt in any National conven
tion. The Western States should follow
the example of the wise and thrifty breth
ren of the East."
ONDRICEK PLAYS.
The Bohemian Violinist Arouses Fresh
Knt Inniium at the Audi
torium.
Many of the audience who attended the
Auditorium concert last night were ready
to say that Paganini almost lived again
when Ondricek played. His magnetic
music again thrilled the auditors and
roused them to a state of enthusiasm sel
dom witnessed in cold, critical San Fran
cisco.
After the rendition of Ondricek's first
number (Concerto No. 1, Paganini) he en
tranced his audience by playing as an en
core the dreamy sweet "Evening Sonfr,"
by Schumann, which his admirers said he
performed in a manner calculated to call
up visions of angelic harps.
Hisown"Fantaisie"on Smetana'9 "Bar
tered Bride" is a work requiring great
technical ability, besides possessing
snatches of the weird, fascinating melodies
which have given the opus such popularity.
After Ondricek's last number, Bozzini's
"Rondo dcs Lutens." the local musicians
rose en masse. This is a work of extraor
dinary difficulty and is very rarely at*
tempted. The perfect ease with which the
music "tripped?" off Ondricek's bow was
delightful. His wonderful harmonics, his
perfect intonation, his versatility, all go to
make him a veritable wizard of the bow.
Materna was in glorious voice. Her ren
dition of the aria from "Tannhauser" is
something not to be easily forgotten. Her
beautiful organ is free from the inevitable
tremolo met with so often. Hers is a voice
that veritably thrills the listener.
For an encore Materna (by request) sang
"Die Boten," by Gericke, and the audience
seemed to lose its head, no to speak, after
the "Oberon" aria, "Ocean, Thou Mighty
Monster," and vociferously demanded an
encore, calling her out from five to six
times. But upon her eloquently touching
her throat the greater part of the audience
ceased applauding and drowned by hisses
those who persisted. The accompaniments
were ably played by Luckstone.
HIT WITH A SUGARBOWL.
A Religious Controversy Lead* to a
Seriowi Result Between Two Mini.
John Rilcy and & NÂ« Pratt, while dis
posing of some refreshments in a resort at
the corner of Third and Howard streets
early yesterday morning, got into a dis
cussion over which of the many is the best
religion for the welfare of the human
family.
Neither of the controversialists being
sufficiently informed in theology Riley un
dertook to enlighten his adversary by the
forcible method of knocking his side of
tne argument into Pratt's head with a
sugarbowl, and in so doing he split his
scalp open. Thig brought Policeman
lueittothe scene, with the result that
Pratt had some wire stitches drawn
through the gap by the physician, and
Riley was permitted to study theolocy in a
cell in the City Prison.
Judge Campbell will, doubtless, expound
the difficult passages as to which the dis
putants could not agree.
A TEMPEST AT
THE HOSPITAL.
The Cruel Matron Has Pro
hibited All Tender
Glances.
NO MORE FLIRTATIONS.
It Is Whispered That Miss Pat
ton's Prohibition Has Been
Ignored.
DR. STAHLE AS A CHAMPION.
The Head Nurse Prohibits Association
of Nurses and Internes, but Dr.
Stahle Interferes.
Miss Mary A. Patton is cruel.
At lease so say the pretty young nurses
and the gallant young internes at the City
and County Hospital. The lady in ques
tion is not of the ferocious order of femi
ninity, as far as appearances go. She is a
plump, pleasant little person, butâ the
nuraes and internes say â she is too profes
sional.
She has posted up on the walls of the old
building a notice to the effect that there
shall be no social association between the
nurses and physicians of the institution.
And that rule has been held until re
cently to be as inflexible as the oft-quoted
laws of the Medes and Persians. It inter
dicted any coquettish glance that a be
capped and aproned maiden might desire
to bestow upon some new and interesting
interne.
It put an embargo upon any surrepti
tious handclasps in the wards or corridors,
or any sweet, stolen conversations behind
doors half ajar. As to the internes joining
their fair enslavers at an impromptu tea
when the}' were off duty, that was beyond
the confines of propriety, and as "to a
merry evening at the theater and a plate
of succulent oysters at a downtown res
taurant afterward, there were no words
to describe such a violation of etiquette.
Thus the victims of her severity define
the attitude of the little lady from Phila
delphia who is at the head of the San
Francisco Training School for Nurses.
The fair contingent supplement the story
of their wrongs by such effeminate little
characterizations as "Mean thing!" "She's
perfectly horrid!" and the masculine rep
resentation use stronger expletives.
Of late a champion has arisen, they say,
and he is none other than the superin
tendent, Dr. F. A. Stahle. And his posi
tion was declared in an unequivocal
manner.
The story goes that in a test case of a
fortnight "ago Dr. Stahle ruled that when
nurses were off duty it was nobody's busi
ness what innocent amusements they
chose; neither might any one interfere
with their choice of a companion at such
times. One of the youngest and liveliest
of the probationers applied for a pass, and
written permission to be absent from the
building until 11 o'clock was granted her.
She extended the time of her cessation of
duty two hours, and this aroused the in
dignation of her instructor. Miss Patton
alleged that the lengthened absence was
willful, and therefore called for discipline
of the offender.
Her companion in the protracted stay
was one of the internes, or house physi
cians. It appears that he was amenable
to no one for lingering 120* minutes longer
in the society of bis charmer, but the
charmer, being a student of the training
school, was, and the head of the school
hela her strictly accountable. According
to the rigid rules that obtain in the insti
tution the young lady would have been
dismissed. She, however, appealed to Dr.
Stahle, and the superintendent "gave her
another trial."
Her tears changed to smiles and those
.smiles have been reflected by a dozen or
more of the busy young people at the hos
pital. The precedent delighted them, and
they have since liberally taken advantage
of it. Nobody looks at the posted notice
except in derision, and it is no uncommon
sight, that of a proud and happy interne
escorting a blushing nurse to and from the
theater, ana as for tender little passages at
the bedside of a patient, who shall forbid
them, we would like to know?
Who knows how many happy matches
that cruel rule of Miss Patton's might
have prevented ? Considering the fact that
Dr. Titus, the former superintendent, met
his fate in the form of a charming nurse
in the institution, it is not to be wondered
at that Miss Patton's unfeeling stand for
"professional association merely" was in
dignantly resented.
A musicale for the benefit of fie training
school is to be given shortly, and it may
be that at that time the final decision in
the case of discipline vs. affection will be
announced.
TWELVE MILLION DEAL.
Henry A. Butters Buys the Tramway
System of the City of
Mexico.
Intelligence comes from the City of Mex
ico that a former Californian, Henry A.
Butters, has just computed negotiations
for the purchase of the entire tramway or
transportation system of the City of
Mexico.
It is reported that the rights-of-way,
franchises and rolling stock were valued
at 512,000.000, which Mr. Butters and his
associates decided to pay. It is known
that the City of Mexico has in progress a
complete system of drainage, and now the
introduction of modern facilities of rapid
transit, sucb as electric cars give, will
mark another step in metropolitan ad
vancement.
Mr. Butters, who has just concluded
these important negotiations, made con
siderable money in mining enterprises on
the Pacific Coast. A group of Oregon
mines owned by him and his brother
yielded a large revenue for several years.
The brothers were well known in. mining
circles of California, as they resided much
of the time in this State.
About four years ago the brothers But
ters went to csouth America. Like many
other practical mining men, they were
active in the development of the rich
mines of that region, and as a result ac
quired immense wealth.
At last accounts one of the brothers was
in South Africa and figured among the
Americans who had been detained for in
citing revolt against the peace and dignity
of the Boer republic.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry A. Butters, accom
panied by their daughter, Mrs. Robert
Augustus Bray of Fruitvale, arrived in the
City of Mexico in February and have been
sojourning there since. They expect to
arrive in San Francisco the latter part of
this month or early in April.
The inference is plain that Mr. Butters
has decided to withdraw from mining ven
tures in South Africa and engage in the
transportation business in Mexico.
