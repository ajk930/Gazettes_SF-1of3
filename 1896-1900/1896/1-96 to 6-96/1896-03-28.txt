HAVANA, Cuba, March 27.â The news ;
received from the western province (Pinar

Government troops are pursuing Maceo :

vicinity of Los Palos.
AO WORD FROM THE VESSEL.
Much Speculation Over the Alleged Sink
ing of the tiermuda.
NEW YORK, N. Y. March 27.â The
Herald this morning says locally: No
â¢word has been received by the Cuban
Junta in this city relative to a report re
cently circulated to the effect that the
Bermuda had been fired upon and sunn by
a Spanish warship and the Cubans genei
ally discredit the rumor. Several promi
nent leaders who were discussing the
Garcia expedition expressed their fears
that the report of the arrival of the Ber
muda was a mistake. They thought the
expedition which landed was another and
smaller one than that which sailed :n the
Bermuda.
One of the men who organized the ex
pedition said:
"We have received as yet no confirma
tion of the Bermuda's landing in Cuba,
nor can we reasonably expect it until her
captain reaches some port away from the
island, Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, or
Vera Cruz, Mexico, from which she can
cable us direct. It may be some days yet
before positive information reaches us,
but in the meantime it iÂ» hard for us to
believe that she has landed on the north
coast of the island.
"When the Bermuda left the Jersey
coast a week ago last Tuesday she did not
follow the Atlantic coast line, but in ac
cordance with Captain O'Brien's plan
steamed straight to sea, laying a course
that would carry her several hundred
miles to the eastward of possible interfer
ence from either Spanish or United States
cruisers which were known to be on the
lookout for her.
"General Garcia and his party boarded
her off the Jersey coast from "a tug on
General Calixto Garcia, the Noted Cuban Patriot, Whose First Ineffectual Attempt
to Reach the Disturbed Island Was Made on the 111-Fated Steamer Hawkins.
With His Party He Was Placed Aboard the Bermuda From a Tug Off the

â¢ "The Bermuda's course would carry her.
j far to the southeast, Watlings Island lieht
! being the first land which Captain O'Brien
I expected to make. As General Garcia mi
i tended, to, take command >of the Depart
ment of the Orient there is every reason
i to believe > that the Bermuda's captain
j would try to land him near Santiago de
Cuba, or perhaps as far west as Camaguey.
It is hard for us to believe that Captain
O'Brien either changed his original plan
and ran down between, the Bahamas and
Florida, or that after reaching Inagua
Island he would sail west through the en
j tire length of the old Bahama Channel,
j thus running the risk of being intercepted
! by at least a dozen Spanish men-of-war.
"We have the greatest confidence in
Captain O'Brien's judgment and have
i little doubt that he has ere this safely
landed his party in Cuba, but hardly on
the north coast of Pinar del Rio."

MINISTERS ARK WORRIED.
i They Decide JVot to Interfere in the Com
' ing ', Election*.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 27, via Tampa,
i Fla., March 27. â Madrid cablegrams of to
j day refer to a meeting between Prime Min
| ister Canovas del Castillo and Senor
Romero v Robledo, ex-Minister of Grace
and Mercy. It is reported that following
the conference Senor Romero y Robledo
telegraphed to Havana that he would ab
â  stain from any intervention in the ap
proaching elections.- Yesterday's cable
grams from Madrid report that 'the
i autonomists of Puerto Rico have agreed to
; take no part in the approaching elections.
Senor Castellanos, Minister of the Colo
| nies, fears that the autonomists will like
i wise refuse to act. Senor Castellanos re
' grets the stand taken by the reform party,
i particularly because of the importance
] that may be attached to such action by
\ other nations.
i Much comment has been caused in
Madrid by the very weak denial given by
the official press to the report that General
Weyler will return to the Continent. El
Imparcial has published a notice of his
early return.
READY JFOR EMERGENCIES.
The Spanish Indignation Over thâ¬ Action
of Congress. .
MADRID, Spain, March 27.â The most
! moderate papers in their issues to-day cx
i pressed great indignation at the action of
j the American Congress anent the belliger
ency of the Cuban insurgents, and asked
the Government to spare no effort to pre
pare for any development. The action of
Captain-General Weyler in deciding to
treat the insurgents as bandits is almost
| unanimously approved.
Public indignation is running so high
; that the Government will find it difficult
to control the national exasperation. The
j Republicans advocate the granting of
autonomy to Cuba, and declare they will,
| with a view to avoiding responsibility, ab
\ stain from taking part in the elections for
members of the Cortes.
BATTLE-SHIP I\I>IA>A.
Successfully Docked at Fort Royal After
Many Delays.
PORT ROYAL, S. C, March 27.â The
big battle-ship Indiana was successfully
docsed here this morning. She came
through the caisson of the dock with fully
fifteen inches to spare. The official report
on the docking will be made in a day or
two. The maintenance of the Indiana in
commission, omitting all other expenses
of officers and men and coal burned, is put
at something over $1000 a day. On this ac
count alone, from her arrival at the dock
entrance at 8:30 A. m. March 14 until this
morning, the expense incurred was $15,
--000, which was practically thrown away.

GREAT MYSTERY
OF A MURDER,
An Autopsy Made on the
Body Found in a
Trunk.
THE SKULL FRACTURED.
At Salt Lake It Is Believed
That the Remains Can Be
Identified.
TWO RICH MEN DISAPPEARED.
One a Rancher and the Other a
Frenchman Who Left a Bank
Account.
CHICAGO, 111., March 27.â The police
believe they now have a clew to the identi
fication of the body found in the trunk in
Wakem & McLaughlin's bonded warehouse
last night. To-night two men, who gave
their names as Henry Devere and Bas
Marcel, viewed the remains at the morgue
and told Captain Fitzpatrick they
believed the body to be that of Jane
Prosper Chazzell, who disappeared from
Salt Lake, Utah, in February, 1893.
They based their assertion on the fillings
in the teeth of the dead man, and say they
identical with those in Chazzell's teeth.
The two men, of whom nothing is known,
excepting that they are Frenchmen, said
they recollected distinctly one of the fill
ings, which was steel. Cbazzell, they
said, formerly lived with a Mrs, llolande
in Salt Lake.
This afternoon post mortem examination
was made of the corpse found yesterday in
the trunk bought among some unclaimed
freight. It resulted in the finding of two
fractures in the skull, which appear 4o
have been made with a hammer. The
inquest will be held to-morrow morning.
SALT LAKE, Utah, March 27.â Very
little can be gleaned here throwing light
on the identity of the man whose remains
were found in a trunk sold at auction as
unclaimed property in Chicago. A theory
has been advanced that the box was
shipped to Salt Lake from Laramie and
that the remains are those of a wealthy
rancher namedlCrawford, who disappeared
mysteriously about three years ago and
has never been heard of since.
Crawford was in partnership with a man
named Booth, who was murdered in his
own Darn about a year ago, and for the
crime a man named Crocker was recently
convicted in the Wyoming courts, but was
granted a new trial, which is now pending.
Late in the year 1892 or early in 1893 a
Frenchman named Proshir Chazzell came
to Salt Lake from his native country. He
appeared to be a man of considerable
means and nad thousands of dollars' worth
of diamonds and jewelry. He lived with
a French woman of the demi monde, and
for safekeeping placed his valuables in a
lackbox of a safety deposit company. He
also had $2500 to his credit in the
Deseret National Bank of this city.
Early in the month of February, 1893,
about the time the mysterious box was
shipped, Chazzell disappeared and so far
has not been seen since. The woman with
whom he lived, claiming to be his wife,
notified the police, who instituted search,
but in vain. The lockbox, which was
known to contain his jewelry, was opened
by order of the court and was found empty.
Certain compatriots of Chazzell were sus
pected of murdering him, but nothing
tangible could be got hold of.
A few weeks after Chazzell's disappear
ance they went to Chicago. About a year
ago the Chief of Police of this city received
a letter from a lady in Paris, France,
claiming to be a sister of Cbazzell and
asking for information of her brother, of
whom she had not heard since early in
1893, when he was in Salt Lake. There is
at present $2400 standing to his credit in
the Deseret Bank of this city. The detec
tive who worked principally on the case
three years ago says that he is convinced
the body found in the trunk at Chicago is
that of Proshir Chazzell.
WHEX MARRISOX WILL WED.
Mrs. Mtnmick 1m to Become Hi* Bride
on April S.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 27.â Ex-
President Harrison will leave here on
Tuesday next for New York, and will be
married to Mrs. Mary Dimmick April 6.
He will be accompanied by D. M. Hans
dell, ex-Marshal of the District of Colum
bia, who appears to be the only one from
this city who has received an invitation.
It is not known what arrangements have
been made for the wedding, but it is be
lieved that it will be a very quiet, unosten
tatious affair and will take place at the
residence of the bride. Mrs. McKee has
been here for several days, and visits her
father almost daily, but she is stopping
with her husband's relatives.
FIRE JaY A FVRXITURB MOVBE.
Considerable Damage Vone to Stock in a
Tall liuildinq.
DES MOINES, lowa, March 27,- -Fire in
the six-story furniture house of L. Har
bach this afternoon damaged the building
and stock to the extent of $65,000. The
fire started on the fifth floor and for a
time the firemen were unable to reach it.
For two hours the total destruction of the
building seemed probable, and adjoining
buildings near were threatened. The loss
on stock is about half covered by insur
ance; that on the building is fully covered.
The total loss after insurance is paid will
be about $30,000.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa., March
27.â 1t is not at all probable that the out
break in Matabeleland will be very serious
or long continued, as vigorous methods are
alreudy being taken to stamp it out. Ac
cording to the latest reports received from
the district where the trouble occurred,
there have been seven white men killed
and a large number wounded. It is feared
that this statement is not exaggerated,
and that later reports will show a large
number of murders.
As soon an the news of the outbreak be
came generally known, a force of colonists
was organized, and under F. C. Selous,
started for Matabeleland with the inten
tion of quelling the revolt.
It is reported that a fifht has taken
place two miles from Buluwayo between
a force of the Matabeles and a party of
mounted patrols.
Advices received here are to the effect
that several whites in outlying place* are
reported to have been Killed by Matabeles.
It is assumed that the outbreak is partly
due to the stringent measures recently
adopted to stamp out rinderpest in Rho
desia. The fondness of the Kaffirs for
their cattle is well known and the killing
of them in efforts to stamp out rinderpest
has excited much discontent.
A dispatch from Johannesburg says that
the wildest rumors are in circulation there
regarding the rising. It is hinted that the
Boers stirred up the Matabeles against the
British, but this rumor is declared here to
be baseless.
Cecil J. Rhodes, late Prime Minister of
the Cape Colony, has started for Buluwayo.

<?OXFIDJEXCE IA ROSEBERY.
Pointed Words of the Â£x-Premier on the
Soudan Expedition.
LONDON, Exg.. March 27.â At to-day's
session of the conference of the National
Liberal Federation at Hudderstield Robert
J. Price, M. P., moved a resolution re
cording its confidence in Kosebery, and it
was adopted unanimously. Only forty
Liberal members of the House of Com
mons were present. Lord Rosebery was
the only member of the late Liberal
Cabinet in attendance.
A public meeting was very larpely at
tended that was held in the Rowley Music
Hall this evening. The principal speakers
were: Lord Rosebery, Right Hon. Herbert
J. Gladstone, M. P.; Dr. R. Spence Wat
son, president of the National Liberal
Federation, and Sir James Wodehouse,
member of Parliament for Huddersfield.
In the course of his speech ex-Prime
Minister Rosebery denied that the Lib
eral officials had exerted undue influence
upon the federation. He would be glad if
the federation were more guided by offi
cialdom.
Lord Rosebery then touched upon
foreign relations. He complained that the
Government had not divulged its reasons
fer undertaking the Soudan expedition
and declared that it seemed that the coun
try was being footed. Even omens abroad,
he added, warned Great Britain to con
centrate her energies, yet the Government
was locking her resources in a desert.
In the House of Commons to-day George
N. Curzon, Under Secretary to the For
eign Office, stated that the Government
did not intend to send a British expedi
tion to Dongola next autumn. This state
ment was made in answer to a question by
a member of the opposition. He further
said that the sanction of the advance of
the Egyptian reserve fund toward the cost
of the Nile expedition now under way did
not rest with the powers, but with the
commission of the Egyptian public debt,
which had the right to decide whether the
advance should be made. By a vote of
a majority of the commission, he said, they
had. so decided.

DUMPED IN THE SUBURBS
An lowa Hospital Sends a
Dozen Lunatics to
Chicago.
One Way of Getting Rid of Patients
When the Institution Becomes
Too Crowded.
CHICAGO, 111., March 27.â According
to a story told this morning in the County
building by James T. Turner to several
County Commissioners, a dozen lunatics
were brought from the lowa Hospital tor
the Insane at Clarinda and dumped in
Chicago and its suburbs one at a time thi
morning by subordinate officials of the
asylum there. Turner says the presen
instance is not the tirst one of the kin
which he has known of since he was con
fined in the asylum at Clarinda a litil
over a year aco. He alleges that it ba
been a practice to deport patients when
ever the institution became crowded and
that he and the other eleven insane men
who were taken on the present dumping
trip were threatened with death if they
exposed the asylum people responsible.
Assistant Superintendent Appleeate and
two asylum attendants named Peterson
and Johnson are charged by Turner with
bringing a party of lunatics from Clarinda
last night over the Burlington route clad
only in the asylum "strait clothes,"
which were hidden by overcoats. Turner
says the other victims of the alleged
scheme were too far gone mentally to ex
pose it, if they chose to do so. The police
are investigating the story and trying to
find Applegate, who left Turner at the
Union depot, saying he was going to
Indianapolis.

Bandit Brown's Application
for Clemency Proves
Disastrous.
IS UNLAWFULLY ALIVE.
A Former Commutation of His
Sentence Found to Have
Been Illegal.
THE CONVICT SHOULD HANG.
Governor Budd Discovers an Error
Committed by a Predecessor
in Office.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 27.â 1n ex
amining into the merits of the application
of H. E. Brown, the Mendocino outlaw, for
a pardon Governor Budd has discovered
that instead of beine entitled to a pardon
the former death sentence, as imposed by a
jury, is in full force and effect, and Brown
should be hanged.
Brown was convicted of robbery in 1875
and sentenced to the penitentiary, but he
had influential friends and they succeeded
in persuading Governor Irwin to pardon
him. Upon obtaining his liberty, Brown
re-entered his career of crime, which
eventually culminated in hia ambushine a
posse of officers who were pursuing him
and killing two of themâ T. Dollard and
William Wright. After a chase which
lasted sixty days Brown was captured,
tried and found guilty of murder in thÂ«
lirst degree and sentenced # to be hanged.
The case was appealed to the Supreme
Court and the judgment of the lower court
reversed on an error made by the Judge
of that court in instructing the jury.
The case was then transferred to Sonoma
County, where a new trial was held, and
again Brown was convicted and sentenced
to be banged. While awaiting sentence in
the county jail Brown was instrumental in
preventing a break of prisoners and saved
the life of the Sheriff. For this action
Governor Perkins commuted his death
sentence to life imprisonment in San
Quentin.
In looking up the matter of the pardon
Governor Budd finds that the murder for
which Brown was twice convicted was
committed after the new constitution went
into effect. It was committed in the fall
of 1879, and the constitution went into
effect on July 1, 1899. Article VII, section
1, of the constitution says:
Neither the Governor nor the Legislature
shall have power to grant pardons or com mvÂ«
tations of wntence In any case where the con
vict has twice been convicted of a felony, un
less upon the written recommendation of a
majority of the Judges of the Supreme Court.
The language here, the Governor be
lieves, is very strong. A pardon for a first
offen se would often remove all disabili
ties, but in this section of the constitu
tion, which was in effect at the time Gov
ernor Perkins exercised the pardoning
power, the words "in any case" are used.
Governor Budd's opinion of the matter from
his review of law is, that Governor Perkins
did not have the power to commute the
sentence of H. E. Brown, and, as the Su
preme Court did not take part in the com
mutation, as required by the constitution,
the death sentence as imposed by the So
noma County jury upon H.- E. Brown is
still in full force and effect.
WILL LEES GET IT?
Examiners ,- in â¢ Doubt aa to the Kovttle*
Reward.
.. SACRAMENTO, - Cal., March 27.â At
the meeting of the State Board â¢ of Ex- .
aminers this afternoon several, opinions
from the Attorney-General in regard .to
matters which had been referred to him at
previous meetings were read. One was to
the effect that summons in foreclosure
proceedings against delinquent purchasers
of school lands were legal if published five
times in weekly papers, this being all that
was required by law. ; , : .
,;â  In the Kovalev reward case the Attorney-
General's opinion was that, owing to Cap
tain Lees' official \ position, he had ' grave
doubts as to whether Lees was entitled to
handle any portion of the reward, and he
believed the matter should be referred to
the Supreme ; Court. ; In ; discussing this
case Governor Budd stated that he was in
favor of allowing Hamilton $100 and Cap
tain Lees $900. \ Secretary of State Brown
believed Lees should have the full amount,
in -', order to encourage officers in such
cases. V - , 'â¢- . â¢ -.#-â â â  ( . â¢
Governor Budd : said, in speakine of
I slanders, that the evangelist who slandered \
[. the community of .Fresno several days ago

I had' made a suggestion, to the code com- .,
missioners, and a law would \be drawn , up ;

CLOSING IN ON SEOUL.
The Government Cannot Raise
Troops to Cope With
the Insurgents.
AN INSUPPORTABLE SITUATION
Departure of the King From the Rus
sian Legation Will Cause the
Cabinet's Downfall.
TOKIO, J.kvky, March 13.â Returns com
piled by the Japanese authorities covering
the period from May 26 to November 15,
1595, while the Formosan rebellion was in
progress, show the Japanese lost altogether
195 men in battle and had 579 wounded,
but so severely did they suffer from sick
ness that 234 were thrown out of service
daily on the average. The Cninese, dur
ing the same interval, are supposed to have
had about 7500 kilied, but the number is
probably below the truth, for 6760 bodies
were actually found by the Japanese and
undoubtedly many wounded men crawled
or were carried away to die in the bush
or elsewhere.
The state of affairs in Korea goes from
bad to worse. Politicians in Seoul insist
that by taking refuge in the Russian lega
tion anu remaining there the Kins; has
virtually quitted his own dominions, since
the precincts of a legation are extraterri
torial. A similar view is held by the lead
ing citizens of the capital, who naturally
see that very ' little power of govern
ing can be accredited to a sovereign and
his Cabinet so long as they dare not ven
ture beyond the shadow of a foreign flag.
As for the insurgents in the provinces
they have adopted a new tone, dictated of
course by adherents of the prince-parent's
party. They say that the men by whom
the King was persuaded to seek asylum in
the Russian legation are traitors to the
country and must be exterminated. But
they also proclaim that all foreigners must
be expelled from the kingdom, an an
nouncement probably intended as a blind.
They have pushed to a point not more
than ten miles from Seoul, and the Gov
ernment has no troops to cope with them.
Tne raising of several new battalions
of royal guards has been ordered by edict,
but money to pay them is not forth
coming, even if they could be organized
so speedily as to meet the emergency.
Something like a panic was caused in
the Japanese settlement of Gensan,
owing to the apparent imminence of
an attack by the insurgents in great force,
there being only â  mere handful of Japan
ese soldiers in the town. But calm was
soon restored, and a Japanese man-of-war
is now ancnored in the port. Frequent
encounters take place between small
parties of Japanese and greatly superior
bodies of insurgents, but the courage and
discipline of the former always prevail
unless the odds are overwhelming.
The whole situation, however, is rapidly
growing insupportable, and a general idea
gains ground that the departure of the
King from the Russian legation will be
the sienal for the downfall of the present
Cabinet. It has been pretexted by the pro-
Russian party that the King's residence in
tke palace is out of the question so long as
Japanese troops have their barracks in the
immediate vicinity. The troops were
located there orieinally by desire of the
Korean Government, but aa the Japanese
authorities have neither need nor occasion
to keep them there they are about to be
removed. This state of confusion and tur
moil contrasts vividly with the tranquility
and good order that existed while Count
Inouye was in Seoul. His tact ami ability
never failed to stiil the strife of factions
and to guide the country quietly into the
paths of reform. Russian interference has
produced exactly the opposite effect.
The United States' representative in
Seoul is winning golden opinions among
the Japanese at this crisis. His influence,
they report, is steadily exerted in the cause
of right and justice. Strong, and in great
part successful, efforts are said to have
been made by him to mitigate the cruel
ties practiced by the Cabinet against its
political opponents and to lessen the bru
talities resorted to by the legaL tribunals
in their examination of prisoners.
The Japanese Government has an
nounced another issue of the war loan.
Power to raise 200,000,000 yen was origin
ally vested in the Government by the
Diet, but of that amount only 80,000,000
was put upon the market. The resources
actually at the Government's disposal to
defray war expenditures were thus only
81,000,000 yen of the loan (the bonds having
sold at a premium); 35,000,000 yen of
accumulated surplus revenue, and 4*000,000
yen voluntarily contributed by enthusias
tic persons, or 120,000,000 yen in all. On
the other hand, the accounts up to the
present show an expenditure of 235.000,000
yen. By borrowing money from the Bank
of Japan, temporarily diverting funds
from special accounts, and issuing war
checks, the Government was able to pay
its way, but the deficit of 115,000,000 yen
had ultimately to be met. For that pur
pose 80,000,000 were taken from the Indem
nity paid by China, and a third iÃsue of

the war loan, amounting to 35.000,000 yen,
is now made. Only 10,000,000, however,
are offered for public subscriptions, the
remaining 25,000,000 worth of bonds being
taken by the Bant of Japan. The mini
mum selling price of the bonds is to be
their face-value, and the rate of interest
5 per cent, as before.
Contrary to expectation, the Japanese
Diet has passed all the taxation measures
proposed by the Government for raising
the public revenue to a figure commen
surate with the increased expenditures en
tailed by the country's altered circum
stances. Having voted the budget, in
which augmented expenditures are in
cluded, it followed that the Diet must
consent to some means of increasing the
revenue correspondingly. But the means
contemplated by the Government evoked
much criticism, especially a new registra
tion law, imposing payments on occasions
of birth, death, marriage, succession, and
so forth ; a law raising the taxes on trades
and a law providing for an official monop
oly of the sale of leaf tobacco. The special
committees of the House of Representa
tives charged with the duty of examining
and reporting upon these measures de
voted a long time to the task, and their
hesitation was construed as an indorse
ment of the bills' unpopularity. But they
finally reported in a favorable sense and
the measures were passed with very trifling
alterations.
The old question of freedom of the press
has again brought about a collision be
tween the upper and lower houses of the
Japanese Diet. Under the present law the
executive is empowered to suspend a jour
nal for an unlimited time merely on the
ground that its continued publication
would be detrimental to public peace or
morality. The incriminated article or
articles need not be specially indicated.
Against this law a majority in the lower
house has always remonstrated. The
Government, on its side, was willing to
meet the House half way, but unwilling
to divest itself altogether of a power
the occasional exercise of which appeared
absolutely essential in the present state of
Japanese newspaper development. This
session the Cabinet introduced a new
project of press law, in which the period
of suspension was limited to one week,
and it was provided that the objectionable
matter must always be indicated. But
these concessions, though large, did not
satisfy the politicians in the lower house.
They amended the new project in the
sense of abolishing the power of suspen
sion altogether, and they also introduced
various other liberal changes. When the
bills reached the Peers they rejected all
the amendments introduced by the Rep
sentatives, and restored the law to the
form in which it had been presented by
the Government. Thus the uncompro
mising attitude of the lower house im
pedes the progress of the reforms that it is
so anxious to effect.
A document purporting to be a transla
tion of a secret treaty concluded some
months ago between Russia and China
has been published in Shanghai. It is a
strange and scarcely crediole agreement.
China, in consideration of the Northern
power's good offices in backing her bills
upon France for a paltry sum which Eng
land would have supplied unconditionally,
and in ' combining with Germany and
Franttto drive the Japanese out of Liao
tung, places any or all of her harbors at
Russia's disposal for belligerent purposes,
and also permits Russia to secretly raise
levies, buy horses, and obtain coolies in
Chinese territory. These various priv
ileges, if challenged by another power, are
to be ascribed to force majeure, China
pretexting inability to oppose Russia's
action. But, at the same time, China is to
enjoy the pleasure of openly attacking
Russia's enemies, should 6he so desire.
Further, when the Siberian railway is fin
ished, Russia is to be at liberty to build a
branch line to Talien, on the northwest
coast of the Gulf of Pechili, or to any
other point she pleases, and will be al
lowed to occupy and fortify an island for
the better protection of the terminus of
the line. Sbe also obtains leave to select
and entrench favorable positions on the
Chinese coast opposite Vladivostock and
to attack Korea via Manchuria, should
difficulties arise with Japan about the
peninsula. Per contra, Russia promises to
use persuasion, or force if necessary,
against any power attacking China; to
lend several hundreds of officers for the
drilling of 100,000 Chinese troops in Man
churia and subsequently in the five north
ern provinces of China proper, and to hand
over the branch railway built to her in
Manchuria should China, at the end of
fifteen years, have proved herself compe
tent to manage it.
The opinion of intelligent observers in
the East is that no such treaty can have
been concluded. Were China in ex
tremis sbe could scarcely pay a higher
price for rescue, nor is it conceivable that
Russia should have played so uniquely for
her own hand without any regard for her
allies, Germany and France. However,
short-sighted and emotional the Peking
Government may beâ and it has never
exhibited such traitsâ it can scarcely have
consented to the conversion of the whole
Chinese empire into a Russian military
basis, or made such concessions in Man
churia as must inevitably bring the whole
of that vast district under Russian sway at
The Japan Mail Steamship Company
has opened a line of steamers to Europe.
Special boats of high speed and great
carrying capacity are being built in Eng
land for the service, but at present steam
ers of from three to four thousand tons,
acquired by the company during the war,
will be employed. The intention is to
compete with the Conference lines, cargo
being the chief aim. But excellent accom
modation for passengers will also be pro
vided, and as a first-class passage to Lon
don will cost only 350 yen, against 700 yen
charged by the Peninsula and Oriental
Company, and over 500 yen (plus heavy
extras) by the Pacific Mail Company, a
very sensible effect may be produced on
the passenger traffic of the two last com
panies. There can be no doubt that all
Japanese traveling or sending cargo to
Europe will give the preference to the

sels, and as Japanese merchants now ex
port to Europe and import thence no less
than 24,500,000 yen worth of goods annu
ally, without the intervention of foreign
ers at the treaty ports, the steamers of the
new service should not lack for cargo. They
have also the advantage of a tolerably
liberal state subsidy, which may be
roughly stated at about 100,000 yen for
each all-round voyage, that method of
encouraging navigation having been just
established by law.
| |Coastwise freights in Japan have fallen
to an exceptionally low figure, owing to
the greatly increased number of steamers
employed in the carrying trade. Many of
these steamers were acquired during the
war and chartered by the Government for
transport purposes. The release from that
duty has rapidly pulled freights down by
as much as 40 per cent between January
and March. Going further back for a
standard the comparison is still more
striking, for the figures now quoted are a
hundred per cent lower than they were at
the corresponding period of last year.
The customs revenue raised on the im
port of opium into Formosa aggregates
$2,000,000 annually. That whole sum the
Japanese Government is willing to devote
to measures for eradicating the opium
vice. It is impossible to put any drastic
measures of prevention into immediate
force. To suddenly cut off the supply of
the drug would produce terrible suffering
among habitual smokers. Such persons
only will be furnished with licenses to
purchase a limited quantity, the use of
opium by all others being strictly inter
dicted.
To carry >out that programme the Gov
ernment must monopolize the trade; must
establish a refinery; must appoint compe
tent medical experts to examine applicants
for licenses; must institute strict control
over opium-sellers and opium-smoking es
tablishments, and must organize a special
force of opium police. It will be a most
difficult and arduous undertaking, but the
Japanese authorities believe that by vigi
lance and perseverance they may hope to
eradicate the vice completely in twenty or
thirty years. It is alleged that the use of
opium is necessary to persons living in the
malarial regions of the island, but Japan
ese physicians do not share that view.
In view of its greatly increasing opera
tions in foreign trade the Yokohama
Specie Bank has decided to double its cap
ital of 6,000,000 yen. The 100-yen shares
of the bank are now selling at 333 yen in
the open market, and as the six millions'
worth of new shares go entirely to the
holders of the old the latter will find the
transaction very profitable.
The Salvation Army's doings in Japan
j have been disfigured by dissensions among
the officers. At the outset the commander
instituted a programme of wearing Japan
ese dress and eating Japanese food only.
It is impossible for Occidentals to subsist
en Japanese food without detriment to
health, and the wearing of Japanese cos
tume by persons coming to Japan as apos
tles of a creed seems to the Japanese a
mere burlesqueâ they do not want to have
their intelligence approached by such
\ routes. Apart from the question of policy,
I however, the diet and manner of life
| proved too much for some of the married
officers. They resigned, and one couple
j had to be sent back to England by public
subscription. It is not to be supposed
that they were left destitute by the army.
| The commander was prepared to pass
them on to Australia in tne regular rou
tine of service. But they wanted to go to
England, and the charitable people that
subscribed to send them there took such a
vivid view of their hardships that quite a
scandal was created.
Detailed accounts from Kiangyinâ which
lies midway between the mouth of the
Yangtze and Chingkiangâ show that a
mutiny on a large scale among the soldiers
there was only prevented by the explosion
of a magazine. The disaffected troops
were Anhui men who had been stationed
at Kiangyin for twenty years. Last year
an officer of some military competence and
honesty was sent from Nanking to com
mand a portion of the troops. His re
forms soon created discontent, which
j reached a climax when at his suggestion
orders arrived from headquarters to dis
band the superannuated braves. An in
surrection was planned, the programme
being to kill the general in command, get
i possession of the magazines and rifles, and
1 then master the city, the foreign instruc
j tors in the forts being sent away by boat
jto Shanghai. Already the work had coni
j menced.
Rities had begun to crack and the muti
neers were removing the contents of the
magazines, when the principal of three â
containing about seven tons of gunpowder
I â blew up. The cause of the explosion is
not known, since all in or near the maga
zine, to the number of about 300, were
! shattered to pieces. The catastrophe was
so terrible that it completely cowed the
soldiers and they desisted from further
acts of violence. But tiiey had attained
their object. The general in command
was replaced, the too-conscientious cap
| tain was put under arrest and the sentence
iof disbandment was revoked. Chinese
I soldiers can apparently get anything that
they insist upon having.
It is difficult to Know how matters are
really faring in Kansu. News received on
one day that the Mohammedan rebels
are as strong as ever is followed, on the
next, by statements that their strength is
completely broken. The laiest intelligence
is a telegram from Lanchow, the capital of
the province, dated February 28. It rep
resents the insurgents as quite unable to I
cope with the imperial forces under Gover
nor Wei of Shensi, who recently arrived
in Kansa. The. principal chief of the
rebels is said to have been captured in
January and many of the Mussulman vil
lages have had to hand over a number of
their elders by way of alternative to hav
ing their homesteads abandoned to the
fury of the soldiers.
American and Russian kerosene is to
meet a new competition at Hongkong.
Tanks are in course of construction there
for storing Lankat oil, which will be con

than its rivals.

Passage of the Bill in the

Argument.
DISPOSES OF MILLIONS.
Hill Succeeds in Defeating an
Item for Expenses in
New Mexico.
SAYS IT WAS "SNEAKED IN."
Chairman Allison of the Committee
Makes an Appropriate Ex
planation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.â The
legislative appropriation bill passed the
Benate to-day after occupying the atten
tion of that body every day during the
present week. It appropriates in round
numbers $25,500,000. There was much de
bat* upon it â first, on Senator Sherman's
motion to strike out all the sections relat
ing to the compensation of United States
Marshals, Clerks and District Attorneys
(putting them on a salary system instead
of the present system of fees); second, on
Senator Hill's motion to strike out a pro
viso changing the time of meeting of the
Legislative Assembly of New Mexico.
Sherman's motion was defeated â ayes 18,
noes 30 â so that the bill remains, in that
respect, as it passed the House. Hill's
motion developed a political controversy, I
and notice was given by Gorman of Mary
land that the discussion could not be cut
off, but would assume pretty large di
mensions. With the object of avoiding
this threatened political debate, Cullom of
Illinois, who was in charge of the bill,
moved to Jay Hill's motion on the table,
but Cuilom's motion was disagreed toâ
ayes 21, noes 29.
The Democratic Senators were aided by j
the votes of the Populists and of two Re
publican Senatorsâ Frye and Wolcott.
Thereupon Cullom withdrew all opposi
-1 tionto Hill's motion and it was agreed to.
That practically ended the consideration
of the biil and it was passed without a
division^
The legislative appropriation bill was
taken up after some minor business had
been disposed of, the question being on
Sherman's motion to strike out all the
paragraphs relating to the compensation
of United States District Attorneys, Clerks
and Marshals.
Pending action on Sherman's motion
Vilas(D.) of Wisconsin moved'to strike
out the section in relation to District At
torneys and insert in lieu of it this: That i
the United States District Attorneys for
each of the judicial districts of the United !
States (except the Southern district of I
New York, which shall continue under I
existing law) shall be paid an annual sal- |
ary of $4000, except that in the district of j
Massachusetts, the Eastern district of
Pennsylvania, the Eastern district of
Louisiana, the Northern district of Califor
nia and the Northern district of Illinois
they shall be paid an annual salary
of $t>ooo.
Vilas' motion to amend the sixth sec
tion and Sherman's motion to strike out
all the sections relating to the compensa
tion of judicial officers were discussed at
length. â¢
Allison (R.) of lowa, chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, expressed
his entire concurrence in the arguments
made yesterday by Sherman and Hill
against general legislation on appropria
tion bills, but the committee, he said, re
garded and was compelled to regard this
case as exceptional and had so treated it. -
After some discussion the Senate de
feated â 30 to 18 â Sherman's motion to
strike out of the legislative bill all the
sections relating to the compensation of
United States District Attorneys. Clerks
and Marshals.
The amendment offered by Vilas was
rejected without a division.
Hill moved to strike out of the para
graph makine appropriation for the legis
lative expenses of the Territory of New
Mexico a proviso that the next session of
the Legislative Assembly shall commence
on the first Monday in May, 1897. He
said that this was another instance of
general legislation, that it wns a political
amendment "sneaked in" on an appro
priation bill, and that it was a small,
mean, contemptible, silly attempt to gain
a political advantage.
Elkins (R.) of West Virginia asked Hill
what he meant by the phrase "sneaked
in."
"I thought," Hill replied with anima
tion, "that I would etir up the Senator
from New Mexico â I mean the Senator
from \Vest Virginia, but it is about the
same thing. The Territorial Legislature
will, under existing law, assemble nexe
December, but this little trick is to post
pone the meeting till May, 1897. when there
may be a Republican President of the
United States and a Republican Governor
and Republican Territorial officers."
Cullom (R.) of Illinois in charge of the
bill, made an explanation of the matter,
and made a remark as to Hill getting into
a "spasm" about it. Hill declared that
the "spasm" was on the other side of tho
chamber.
Carter (R.) of Montana made an expla
nation of the proviso, and stated why it
should be enacted.
After further discussion Cullom moved
to lay Hill's motion on tne table. The
motion being undebatable, Gorman ap
pealed to Cullom not to persist in it, and
he repeated the remark which he had
already made as to the question being a
political one, adding that it was one on
which Senators were entitled tp have a
discussion extending far beyond the
bounds which it had taken.
Cullom said his object was to have a test
vote.
"If you want a test vote," Gorman said,
"we are ready for it now."
"You can beat us," Frye remarked in an
undertone.
The result of the vote showed Frye to
be right. It was, ayes 21, noes 29.
On this aye and no vote the Populists
voted with the Democrats in the negative,
and there were also two Republican Sena
tors voting in the same wayâ Frye and
Wolcott.
Then Cullom withdrew his opposition,
and Hill's motion to strike out was agreed
to. The bill was then passed without a
division. It appropriates $25,500,000.
The Senate then at 4:oQ o'clock pro
ceeded to the consideration of executive
business and Boon afterward adjourned till
Monday.
PROCEEDINGS IX 'i TB.B SOUSE.
Consideration of the Civil Appropriation
Bill Is Refuted.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.â Quite
unexpectedly the House of Representa
tives to-day by a vote of 142 to 77 refused
to consider the civil appropriation bill re
ported yesterday, adopting the motion of
Hepburn (R.) of lowa to take up bills in
private calendar for the first time this ses
sion. The adoption of this motion ex
hausted an hour and another hour was
spent in discussing a motion by Pickler
(R.) of South Dakota that only pension
and private relief bills reported from the
Committee on Military Affairs be consid
ered. This was finally agreed to. Only
three bills were considered and they were
reported to the House with a recommenda
tion that they be passed.
Before a vote could be taken on them
Hepburn (R.) of lowa moved that when
the House aijourned to-night it adjourn
until Monday next. Despite the strenuous
opposition of Cannon (R.) of Illinois,
chairman of the Committee on Appropria
tions, the motion was carried to â 103 to 25.
The House then at 5 o'clock was de
clared in recess until 8 o'clock, the even
ing session to be devoted to the considera
tion of private pension bills.
The evening session of the House devel
oped a family row among the Republicans
regarding pension legislation. The first
bill taken up was that discussed last Fri
day night â a Senate bill granting a pen
sion of $30 a month to Charles E. Jones, a
photographer, for injuries resulting from
a wound received while taking a picture
of Longstreet's fortifications at Suffolk,
Virginia.
Connelly (R.) of Illinois antagonized the
bill, and in the course of his speech se
verely criticized the Committee on Invalid
Pensions for bringing in bills of this class
to pension men who were not enlisted.
Pickier (R.) of Sotth Dakota bitterly re
sented the criticism of Connelly, declaring
that it was not fair, and that his assertions
were a base slander upon the Invalid Pen
sions Committee. The committee had
recommended nothing for which it had
not the precedent of many Congresses
past. After amending the bill so as to
give the man a pensionable status and
leaving to the Pension Bureau the deter
mination of the amount to be paid him,
the bill was laid aside with a favorable
recommendation.
Subsequetly Mahon (R.) of Pennsylva
nia, apparently laboring under suppressed
feeling, said that a statement ha.d been
made on the floor which ought not to go out
uncontradicted. When the gentleman
from Illinois (Connelly) had charged that
a certain gentleman whom he need not
name, but whom all Republicans recog
nized as their leader [applause], had inter
fered to suppress legislation in behalf of
the old soldier he spoke, without founda
tion. The Speaker of the House, Mahon
asserted, had always given preference in
grauting recognition to members to those
having bills for the old soldier. The
House has spent fifty-five hours this ses
sion in considering private pension bills
and had passed forty.
.Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio followed in a
similar strain, advising Connelly before
he undertook to arraign the Republican
majority to have more data to go on than
he had at present. Connelly, responding,
said that with a great Republican major
ity in the House a Republican quorum
failed to appear at these Friday night ses
sions, and there were too many candidates
for the Presidency and their friends in
this Congress engaged in promoting their
interests to do justice to the old soldiers
in the matter of pension legislation.
The committee rose after having favor
ably acted upon four bills, and at 10:30
o'clock adjourned until Monday next.

Much Money Believed to Be
Appropriated for Santa
Monica Harbor.

Perkins and Hilborn Pleased With the
Prospect of a Public Building
for Oakland.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.-Al
-tbough the rivers and harbors bill has not
yet been reported it is known that $100,000
is appropriated for Santa Monica harbor.
Representative McLaculan was requested
by the river convention delegates, who
were here several weeks ago, not to oppose
an appropriation for Santa Monica for fear
of prejudicing chances of San Pedro, but
McLachlan is in a dilemna, for he hears
the Southern California papers are criticiz
ing nim for not attacking the Huntington
scheme. The California Congressmen aay
they can tell better what course they will
pursue w nen they have seen how much the
river and harbor bill carries for San Pedro
and Santa Monica respectively.
Senator Perkins and Representative Hil
born are very much pleased over the re
port of the Senate Committee on Public
Build ings and Grounds, recommending an
appropriation of $350,000 for a public build
ing at Oakland, their home town. The
bill will undoubtedly pass the Senate, and
as Mr. Hilborn is an influential member of
the Public Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee of the House it is altogether prob
able the bill will pass that body also. It
is for Speaker Reed to say whether any
money snail be appropriated for public
buildings, but it Is safe to assume that if
any bills are passed in the House Oakland
will be one of them. Perkins and Hilborn
are both natives of Maine, and are both
quite friendly with the Speaker. Hilborn
especially, who knew Reed when he lived
in California.
The remains of Sam B. Solomon of San
Francisco, who died here last night, will,
by request of his relatives, be shipped by
Senator Perkins to California to-morrow.
The hospital surgeons were anxious to lo
cate the bone in Solomon's throat by
means of the Cathode ray, and think they
miiitit possibly have saved his life; but be
fore an apparatus could be secured the
patient was too far gone to render such an
operation of any avail.
Mrs. Ida Harte Merritt, whose family
resides at Oakland, Cal., died here to-day.
Her body will be cremated on Sunday by
her own request.
The House Committee on Public Lands
to-day directed Representative Bowers to
report favorably Senate bill granting Cali
fornia 5 per cent of net proceeds from cash

EXPLAINED BY
WARNER MILLER
Facts Presented to Show
the Feasibility of the
Canal.
SURVEYS IN NICARAGUA
Report of the Government Com
mission Scored in Telling
Words.
THERE IS NO DISADVANTAGES.
The Government Asked to Take the
Construction Under Control or
Let It Alone.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 27.â Ex-
Senator Warner Miller of New York ap
peared before the House Commerce Com
mittee this morning and gave a history of
the Nicaragua Canal Company from its
inception down to the present time. He
said his appearance was not for the pur
pose of advocating any Nicaragua canal
bilh After traveling extensively in Eu
rope and the United States in an endeavor
to educate the people to the necessity of
the enterprise he said he found that capi
talists believed the canal ought to
be a Government affair, and that
the Government would sooner or
later take possession of it, thus
leaving no profit to the private investors.
He related these experiences to the Senate
committee and suggested that the Govern
ment guarantee the bonds of the com
pany, and for this guarantee take stock to
the amount of $70,000,000 and $80,000,000,
the company being capitalized for $100,
--000,000. A bill to this effect was reported
and passed the Senate. The company
now felt that they have a grievance acainst
the Government, because from its action
in the matter it has become impossible to
get the money to construct the canal,
either at home or abroad.
Mr. Miller then paid his respects to the
Government commission, which went to
Nicaragua last summer to inspect the
route of the canal. He asserted without
qualification that the movement to ap
point the commission was made by the
enemies of the canal enterprise. He as
serted that the commission had estimated
the cost of the canal not as practical busi
ness men, but as men who had the great
wealth of the Nation behind them. The
company, on the other hand, estimated
the cost at its lowest figure and with a
view to keeping the expense within the
limits prescribed.
While the rainfall was great, Mr. Miller
continued, the records show that there
has never been a serious flood in Nicara
gua. No danger from floods was to be ex
pected. Referring to the reports of the
earthquakes, be said that in the knowledge
of men there had never been a shock in the
neighborhood of the canal which would
have damaged it.
The commission criticized the surveys of
the river and lake, but these, he said, were
made by officers of the United States navy
and not in the interest of the company.
Referring to the prospects of the canal,
he said commerce sought the cheapest
route, under which conditions he thought
the canal would get much business. The
canal would develop the industries of
the Pacific Coast, especially the wheat and
lumber, and would double in a short time
the population of that section of our
country.
He assumed that 4,000,000 tons of freight
per year would pas? through the canal
shortly after its completion. At a tax of
$1 50 a ton this would give $6,000,000 per
year. And, after further argument, he
said, in concluding, that the company felt
that the Government should now say that
it would take the work under its control,
or say to the world that it did not intend
to enter it. This should be done in fair
ness to the company. If the Government

DEBTS OF PACIFIC ROADS.
Bills Relating to the Subject
Will Be Considered This
Session.
It Is Evident That the Frye-Smith
Bill Will Be Reported With
Modifications.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.-The
managers of the House hare aereed to
consider the Pacific roads bills at this ses
sion. This information is given to The
Call correspondent to-night by one who
is in close touch with Speaker Reed and
his lieutenants. The news comes as a
great surprise to the California colony
here, who have felt certain all along that
as a matter of political expediency as well
economy of time Pacific roads legislation
would go over until next winter's session,
after the elections have been held. But
Speaker Reed has ordained otherwise,
and it is probable that bills will be con
sidered in both the Senate and House in a
tew weeks. Senator Frye, as is well
known, is Huntington's right-hand man.
Frye, by reason of long service and of his
position as president pro tempore of the
Senate, is a power in that body, and can
bring the Pacific roads bill (his own meas
ure) to a vote if be wishes.
The joint committee on Pacific roads Is
making slow progress in framing a bill.
A majority of the members of this sub
committee are ignorant of what is being
done. Kyle. Faris and Sulzer stated to
The Call correspondent to-day they had
no idea of what was being done. The two
chairmen, Powers and Frye, have the
matter in hand and are trying to frame a
bill which will satisfy both roads. Chair
man Powers said to-night that they were
tryine to frame a bill that would go
through both houses.
"There will be no trouble about the Sen
ate, 1 ' said he. "Most any kind of a bill
will pass the Senate, but the House is al
together a different body."
The Call correspondent learns that the
Frye-Smith bill will certainly be reported
with some modifications. The time will
probably be reduced from 100 to 60 or 70
years with interest at 2 per cent. TheÃeilly
bill was for fifty years at 3 per cent. Tha
Californians are to-night more confident
than ever of beating the bill. The joint
committee meets again to-morrow.
The Senate Pacific Railroads Committee
this morning appointed Senators Frye
Walcott and Brice a sub-committee to act.
with a similar sub-committee of toe House
Pacific Railroads Committee in drafting
the bill providing for a settlement of the
debts of the bond-aided Pacific railroads to
the Government.

- BIGAMIST ASO EMBEZZLER.
Many Crimea Are Charged Against
Arthur J. Goodwin.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 27.â Arthur
J. Goodwin, who is charged, the police say,
with bigamy and robbing several firms by
whom he was employed, was arrested
Wednesday night, and in the police court
yesterday he was remanded until the police
of Cripple Creek, Colo., are heard from.
It is said that on March 1, 1895, while an
agent of the Continental Oil Company at
Cripple Creek be disappeared with $1200.
He was arrested in St. Louis on September
30, 1895, and was taken to Cripple Creek,
where he was to have had hia hearing on
January 20, 1896. He again disappeared,
and it was learned that he sailed from this
city to Europe on the steamer New York.
He returned here a short time ago. His
presence in the city was discovered and his
arrest followed.
The charge of bigamy against him comes
from Brooklyn. It is stated that on Aueust
7, 1890, he was married to Mary Gallagher.
She is still living, and it is charged that on
November 21, 1891, Goodwin married Sadie
O'Neil, also in Brooklyn.
The police say Goodwin while employed
by the firm of Perkins & Edwards in this
city in 1892 fled with $400 belonging to the
firm. They also say he stole $150 from
Spencer & Son of Brooklyn.
SEIZED JEWELS TO BE BOLT).
At Public Auction the Zeroux Gema Will
Be Ditpoeed Of.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 27.-United
States Marshal Hayden has been author
ized to advertise and sell at public auction
the famous Leroux jewels, which were
seized by the customs authorities in 1893.
This will be the largest sale of the kind
ever held in Brooklyn. The property con
tains about 1300 pieces. The actual value
of 'he diamonds is about $14,000. ..
The story of the seizure is interesting.
In May, 1893, Jennie Ball, a young French
woman, was arrested in Brooklyn while
trying to pawn a number of diamonds. It
was suspected she had stolen them. De
tectives found on her person and in her
jewels worth $125,000. She was arrested to
gether with a man named Eugene Leroux,
who was mixed up in the affair, but it was
afterward found that the jewelry had been
smuggled into the country by a French
jeweler named Fleischman, who, getting
into debt in France, had packed up all hia
jewelry and deserting his wife fled to
America. Fleischman returned to France
before he could be arrested, but the dia
monds were confiscated by the Govern
ment.
Pearl Bryan's Burial.
GREENCASTLE, Ind., March 27.â The
remains of Pearl Bryan were removed
from the vault and buried in the Bryan
lot in the cemetery to-day.
Is the season for purifying, cleansing and
renewing. The accumulations of waste
everywhere are being removed. Winter's
icy grasp is broken, and on all sides are
indications of nature's returning life,
renewed force and awakening power.
Is the time for purifying the blood, cleans-
ing the system and renewing the physical
powers. Owing .to close confinement,
diminished perspiration and other causes,
in the winter, impurities have not
passed out of the system as they should,
but have accumulated in the blood.
Spring
Is therefore the best time to take Hood's
SarsapariHa, because the system is now
most in need of medicine. That Hood's
Sarsaparilla is the best blood purifier and
Spring medicine is proved by its wonder-
ful cures. A course of Hood's Sarsaparili*
now may prevent great suffering later on.

FOR TOM REED
Favored at the Republican
Convention of the
State.
DELEGATES PLEDGED.
The Platform Opposes the Free
Coinage of Silver and
State Banks.
MANLEY DOES SOME FIGURING.
By His Showing the McKinley Forces
Will Be Defeated at St.
Louis.
BOSTON, Mass., March 27.â The Repub
lican convention to elect delegates to the
St. Louis convention was called to order
shortly after 10 o'clock this morning by
the chairman of the State committee.
Most of the delegates wore Reed badges,
a: d Mr. Lyman's reference to the Maine
ptatesman in his opening address elicited
hearty applause. Senator Lodge also re
ceived a warm greeting when he appeared
on the platform. The committee on per
manent organization reported as their
choice for chairman Hon. Samuel "NY. Mc-
Cold of "Winchester.
The speech of the chairman was fre
quently interrupted by applause, and
especially well received were his insist
ence upon the policy of protection and
adhesion to the National standing of the
commercial world.
Senator Lodge, in rising to present the
report of the committee on resolutions,
â was again warmly received. The platform
declares for protection and reciprocity,
Â»nd demands especial protection for our
merchant marine, which, it declares,
would revive our shipping and cause ray
for American freight to be paid to Ameri
cans. It insists uoon the entire separation
of church and state, demands a restricted
immigration and sympathizes with the
Cuban revolutionists. The currency plank
and that championing Reed's Presidential
aspirations are as follows:
"We are entirely opposed to the free
and unlimited coinage of silver, and to any
change in the existing gold standard ex
cept by international agreement. Each
dollai must be kept as gooii as every othe
dollar. The credit of the United States
must be maintained at the highest point,
so that it cannot be questioned anywhere,
either at home or abroad. Every promise
must be rigidly kept, and every obligation
redeemable by coin must be paid in gold.
"We are opposed to the unsound and
dangerous system of State banks; we sup
port the National banking system and be
lieve that it should be so amended as to
give it room for expansion and oppor
tunities to meet the demands of the grow
ing business and population of the coun
try. We present to the National Conven
tion for nomination as President and we
urge all our delegates to give their earnest,
active support to a fearless leader, tried in
many hard conflicts â a man of National
reputation, of unblemished character, un
swerving Republicanism and great abili
ties, the Hon. Thomas B. Reed of Maine."
Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge, W. Murphy
Crane of Dalton, Hon. E. S. Draper of
Hopedale and Curtis Guild Jr. of Boston
were unanimously elected as deiegates-at
large to the St. Louis convention. Alter
nates were elected as follows: R. H.
Boutwell of Belmont, L. C. Southard of
Boston, R. F. Hawkins of Springfield and
S. E. Courtney of Boston.
The convention adjourned without
formality.
FIGURED OUT BY MAXLET.
gaya McKinley Will Go Down Before
Spanker Reed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 27.â J. H,
Manley sent to TV. Murray Crane the fol
lowing telegram to-day:
Washington, March 27, 1896.
Hon. W. Murray Crane, Republican State Con
vention, Boston, Mast.: In answer to your in
quiry thin is the situation as it will stand at
the end of tttis week: At the close of your con
vention there will have been 393 delegates
elected. Governor McKinley will have 162
delegates, provided you assign to him the en
tire delegations from Wisconsin, Indiana and
Minnesota. But there should be taken from
this number twelve delegates from the States
who have declared since their election in favor
of Mr. Reed, and as they were not instructed
they should be taken from the McKinley col
umn and placed in Mr. Reed's. This gives
Governor McKinley 150 delegates, Mr. Reed
72, Governor Morton 64, Senator Allison 38,
Penator QuaÂ£ 26, Senator Cullom 10, con
tested 36.
You will see that this gives Mr. MoKinley 150
delegates against 210 anti-McKinley delegates.
The situation is precisely as it was twenty
years ago. You will remember that three
months before the convention met at Cincin
nati we were confident of Mr. Blame's nomin
ation. He stood then as the apostle of protec
tion, but he bad opposed to his nomination
Senator Conkling of New York, Senator Mor
ton of Indiana, Secretary Bextow, Governor
Hayes of Ohio and Governor Hartranft of
I'eunsylvania. We felt so sure of Mr. Blame's
nomination that we regarded it as settled and
yet he was defeated in the convention and the
Maine man went down before the Governor of
Ohio.
History will repeat itself at St. Louis. Gov
ernor Mi Kinley is and will be the leading can
didate before the convention, but he will have
opposed to him as candidates Governor Morton
oi New York, Senator Allison of lowa, Senator
Tullom of Illinois, Senator Quay of Pennsyl
vania and Mr. Reed of Maine.
You will find that the tables will be turned
and the Ohio Governor will go down before the
man from Jlaine. J. H. Manley.
HAVE yO SECOND CHOICE.
Prpublirant of lowa Are Solidly Arrayed
for Allison.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 27.â
Governor F. M. Drake of lowa and party,
who are to be present at the launching of
the big warship lowa to-morrow, arrived
in town to-diy. Tne party comprised
Governor Drake and his staff. Secretary of
State W. M. McFarland, State Auditor C.
C. McCarthy, State Treasurer John Her
riot and other prominent citizens and a
number of ladies, in addition to Miss
Mary Lord Drake.
Governor Drake was interviewed this
af-ernoon with reference to the Republi
can Presidential nomination. He said:
' We are all for Allison in lowa, and we
* re going to do all we can to secure him
the nomination for President by the Re
pubjcan convention at St. Louis. We be
lieve he is the man for the place and for
ttiÂ« times, and thai he will faithfully
serve all the best interests of the country."
"Have you a second choice?' 1 he was
asked.
"No, we have no second choice. Any
one from lowa who would go to the Na
tional convention with a second choice
would be anathematized."
REGISTRATION FRAVBB.
Thuga Are Operating Rather Boldly in
the City of Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., March 27.â Charges of
wholesale registration frauds have been
brought against Republicans and Demo
crats, notably in the First and Second
wards, where lodcing-house "colonizing"
is the alleged method of stuffing the regis
tration lists, and in the Seventh and Eight
eenth wards, the latter being full of cheap
lodging-houses. Arrests are expected
within twentj'-four hours.
The Election Commissioners were in
formed this morning that the Eighteenth
Ward registration books had been stolen.
While John Bellair, a Republican clerk of
election, was engaged in examinine the
books with a view to discovering fraudu
lent padding a gang of lodging-house
toughs broke into the room, knocked him
down and escaped with the official records.
The alleged frauds in th* Second Ward
are charged to the Republican candidate
for Alderman, and in the Eighteenth W T ard
to the Democratic candidate.

DENVER, Colo., March 27.â General J.
S. Clarkson of Dcs Moines. lowa, return
ing from a tour which embraced all the
Western and Pacific Coast States, stopped
over in Denver for the day to attend to
some business matters. In an interview
he declared that the McKinley boom has
been pushed too hard and would
end in disaster to the Ohio candi
date; that the West will sup
port a Republican candidate upon a con
servative protection and sound-money
platform, though they ask for silver, and
that Allison is the logical candidate upon
which the whole party can best unite. He
considers New York and Connecticut
doubtful Slates, and believes the Solid
South will once more vote the straight
Democratic ticket.
Democrats trill Holt.
DALLAS, Tex., March 27.â A meeting
of sound money Democrats was held here
to-day in which about 200 prominent poli
ticians took part. They practically deter
mined to bolt the party if a free silver
platform is adopted by the State Conven
tion, which action appears very probable.
WAR VESSELS ARE IDLE
Ships of the North Atlantic
Squadron Now Held Near
Old Point Comfort.
All the Officers, However, Detained
on Duty Ready for instant
Service.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 27.â A Snn
special from Washington says the annual
winter cruise of the North Atlantic squad
ron having been abandoned weeks ago for
fear that its presence in the West Indies
might be construed as an unfriendly act to
either Great Britain or Spain, the Navy
Department is now considering what is
best to do with the ships until the weather
grows milder and the summer tour cf the
New England summer resorts can be
made. With the exception of short runs
outside for target practice none of the ves
sels of the fleet have been to sea for any
length of time, and as there is no better
place to keep them than Hampton Roads
the department has retained the entire
squadron there throughout the winter.
There will soon be several additions to
the force, and it is now perplexing the
authorities how to employ the time of
the vessels until June or July, when it
generally proceeds to Newport and the
Maine coast. It is conceded that so long
as the Cuban situation is prominent
it will not be possible to send any
of the ships even to the Gulf of Mexico
for landing drills and target practice,
and as the weather will probably be not
suitable for open sea drills for several
weeks it seems improbable that the de
partment can rind other duty for the
fleet than to keep it near old Point Com
fort.
At present the ships are well supplied
with all the equipments the)' would re
quire for an extended cruise and have
been held in readiness throughout the
winter to move on a few hours' notice.
No officer has been permitted, under
orders of Admiral Bunce, to get beyond
signal distance or the sound of a gun,
and when it has become necessary to
give the men liberty it has been necessary
to take the vessels separately either to
New York or Norfolk for brief stays. For
several weeks the admiral has per
sistently declined to grant requests for ex
tended leaves, and except for short runs
up to Norfolk few officers or his command
have been absent from the fleet since De
cember 15 last.
Fleeing From a Suitor.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 27.â Two
young women, giving their names a? Miss
A. H. O'Hearn and Miss C. A. Smith of
New York, left yesterday on the steamer
Comanche for New York. They reported
that a rejected lover of Miss O'Hearn, a
New York broker, had been made insane
by his disappointment, and was pursuing
the young women with the avowed inten
tion of killing Mies O'Hearn. Detectives
were stationed at the whart to prevent
him boarding the steamer, but he did not
appear. The names given by the women
are believed to have been assumed to
avoid notoriety.
Heath of Frank Sweeney.
CHICAGO, 111., March 22. â Frank
Sweeney, ex-grand master of the Switch
men's Mutual Benefit Association, now
the National Switchmen's Union, died at
his home here this morning after suffering
a long time from consumption. He was
compelled to relinquish the high position
which he held in National labor circles as
grand masier of the switchmen's organiza
tion on account of the defalcation of the
National treasurer, which ruined the union
financially and finally disrupted it.
Passed as Langdon's Niece.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 26.âAn
other feature of the celebrated . Langdon
and McGrath case was made known to
day. The young girl, Miss McGrath, while
practically living upon Langiion and pos
ing as his" niece, was playing ; fast and
loose with another man, and to the latter
Miss McGrath was the promised wife. His
name is Fitzsimmons, and he is a wealthy
jeweler in Westchester, Pa.
Avoided. Another Strike.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 27.â The
employes of the Union Traction Company
claim that the company has violated the
agreement made after the recent strike
and will lay their grievances before the
citizens' peace committee. At a meeting
last night a motion to begin another
strike was avoided by the 1 nanow margin
of 16 to 14.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1896.
CHEROKEE FLAT
MINE SUIT ENDS
Judge Prewitt's Decision
in the Spring Valley-
Litigation.
THE BONDHOLDERS WIN
Defeat of the Bank of California
After a Battle of Eight
Years.
OPERATIONS TO BE RESUMED.
Famous Hydraulic Property From
Which Over $13,000,000 Has
Been Taken.
OROVILLE, Cal., March 27. â Judge
Prewitt of Placer County, sitting as a
Court of Equity, to-day handed down his
decision in the big mining-bond suit which
The Famous Spring Valley Gold Mine at Cherokee, Butte County, Which lias
Been Closed by Litigation for Eight Years.
[From a pholograph.\
involved the possession of the famous
Spring Valley mine at Cherokee Flat. He
has decided in favor of the bondholders
and against the Bank of California and
Hideout & Smith. He orders the fore
closure of the bonds, representing $150,000
in principal, with $130,000 of interest that
has accumulated since the suit was begun
eight years ago, and directs that Receiver
â \Vhitcomb, who is in charge of the prop
erty, shall proceed to advertise the sale of
the mine in accordance with the foreclos
ure proceedings.
In the opinion filed to-day Judge Prew
itt holds that the deiendants are estopped
from questioning the validity of the mort
gage; that the plaintiffs are entitled to
have and recover a judgment against the
defendants, the Spring Vallej Gold Com
pany, for the sum of $151,000 principal and
$129,759 33 interest due to February 1, 1896,
and interest on said principal sum from
February 1, 1896, until judgment; that the
property rights ana easements are subject
to the lien of the mortgage ; that the plain
tiffs are entitled to a judgment and decree
of sale of the mortgaged property, ritxhts
and easements according to law and to
apply the proceeds to the expenses of the
sale and of the receiver, both before and
after judgment, and the compensation of
themselves and their attorney and to the
payment of the principal and interest due
on tile mortgaged debt; that the defend
ants and intervenors and all persons
claiming # or to claim under them subse
quent to the execution of the mortgage be
barred and foreclosed of all right, claim or
equity of redemption; that the Spring
Valley Gold Company pay any deficiency
which may remain after applying all the
proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged
premises; that the plaintiffs are entitled
to an order continuing in office the re
ceiver: that his bond be fixed at $10,000,
and that it be executed to the State of
California, with ar. least two sufficient
sureties; that his powers continue the
same as heretofore; that he be authorized
and directed to sell the mortgaged prop
erty in the manner provided by law; that
the plaintiffs submit to the court at least
once each year a detailed statement under
oath showing the disposition made by
them of the tiust funds received under
these findings, and that they do not re
move from the jurisdiction of this court
any fund or funds held by them in trust,
and that all payment of bonds be only
upon the actual surrender of them and
physical cancellation of the bonds and
coupons at a point within this State, un
less upon supplemental motion or petition
the court sball otherwise order.
The litigation over the well-known
Cherokee mine, which ha 3 produced over
$13,000,000 in gold, has been going on for
more than eight years and has become
one of the notable mining suits in the
State. A number of prominent attorneys
in San Francisco and Butte County, where
the property is located, have been con
nected with the case. The counsel for the
bondholders has been T. Z. Blakeman of
San Francisco. Arrayed on the siue of
the two banks has been C. W. Cross, J. M.
Allen, F. C. Lusk of Chico and Major A.
F. Jones of Oroville. The decision is a
decisive victory for Attorney Blakeman,
who alone has fought the case from the
atart. Every possible point has been bit
terly contested by both sides.
The principal holders of the bonds are
Louis Glass of San Francisco, David Gage
of Oakland, A. Foster Higgins, Charles F.
Post, C. M. Fry and W. L. Jenkins of New
York.
The suit to foreclose the bonds was filed
in 1888, and it is only now that the de
cree of foreclosure is judicially granted.
While nominally ehe suit has been be
tween the bondholders and the Bpring
Valley Company in reality it has been
maintained by the bondholders against
the Bank of California and the Rideout
& Smith bank, the property long ago
having passed into the possession of these
two institutions.
The grounds of the contest madeagainst
the bonds by the banks were of a technical
nature, it being admitted that the bond
holders paid in their money in good faith,
the proceeds of which was used in the bet
terment and development of the com
pany's property.
The Cherokee mine is one of the largest
and richest hydraulic mines in the State.
The records of the company show that
over $13,000,000 in gold has already been
taken out, with the yield apparently inex
haustible. Since the commencement of
the litigation the operation of the prop
erty has been suspended and the once
booming mining camp of Cherokee Flat
has gradually been given over to the
ground squirrel. At the time of the final
shutting down the mine employed 200 men
and consumed three times as much water
in a day as does the City of San Francisco.
The company owns its own system of
ditches, which are the most extensive in
the State. It has over 100 miles of tese
ditches, embracing one of the largest
water sheds of the Sierras. The system is
capable of supplying 5000 miner's inches
in the driest Beason of the year. Tiie
original cost of the pipes, ditches and
flumes was $750,000. A system of canals
thirty miles long and 1500 feet wide, which
cost o ver $500,000, conveys the "debriÃ"
out across the Sacramento Valley onto the
tules bordering on that liver.
Some eminent mining men have been
connected with the property during its
operation. Its last manager before the
beginning of the litigation was Louis
Glass, now the general manager of the
Sunset Telephone Company.; His prede
cessor was Garney Williams, the present
manager of the world-famous Kimberley
diamond mines of South Africa, Mr. Wil
liams resigning his position at Cherokee
to accept the African offer.
The mining bonds were originally issued
by a New York corporation which was
the owner of the Butte County mine. Sub
sequently the stockholders formed a com
pany under the laws of California, which
were believed to be more favorable to
mining companies, and transferred all its
assets to the new company. The new
company, in consideration of the transfer,
agreed to assume all the debts of the old
company and especially that created by
the bonds.
The mortgage became matured in 1884,
but suit in foreclosure was not instituted
until one day of the lapse of the four
years' statute in 1888. At the time of the
riling of the suit the company was in
debted to the Bank of California and Ride
out & Smith for $50,000. The banks insti
tuted a search for possible technicalities
in the issuance of the bonds, and thinking
that they had discovered one, they ob
tained judgments against the company
and proceeded to sell the property at
Sheriff's sale. Owing to the question as
to the validity of the bonds the Danks ob
tained possession for the amount due
them, no one else caring to bid on the
property.
The main point raised by the banks, as
to the validity of the bonds, was decided
by the Supreme Court in favor of the
bondholder.
The statute of limitations which was
also raised and which Judge Prewett has
just now decided in favor of the bond
holders is considered by the attorneys to
be of minor importance and it is not even
known whether an appeal by the banks
will be considered worth taking.

announcement that C. A. Sayre, a well
known mercantile agent, representing C.
P. Weber & Co. of San Francisco,
had eloped with another man's wife and
his employer's money. The sum was said
to be $6000, but it has since developed that
this part of the story is not true. At least
a friend of Sayre purports to have received
a telegram from Weber & Co., stating
that Fayre's accounts with the firm are
straight.
The rumor about the money originated
from the fact that Sayre secured for Weber
& Co. from the City Board of Edu
cation a contract for furnishing some of
the new schoolhouses. A demand for
$6000 on this contract was cashed a few
days ago, and this money, it was rumored,
Sayre had made away with, but the firm's
denial seems to set the matter at rest.
Sayr^, however, has to all appearances
eloped with another man's man's wife.
The woman is Mrs. Smith Oliver. The
husband admits that she ran away with
Sayre and he is heart-broken. Oliver is
an attache of the Sheriff's office and is
well thought of. He and his wife boarded
at the St. Lawrence House, where Sayre
also had rooms. It is alleged that an in
timacy sprang up between Mrs. Oliver and
Sayre, whoijis also married, which ripened
into love awd they planned an elopement
and are now supposed to be in
Mexico. Sayre paid his room rent
at the St. Lawrence Jast Saturday,
drew $1000 which he had on deposit in
a bank, disposed of a stock of spectacles
valued at $300 and has not since been seen.
On the same day Mrs. Oliver pretended
that she was going to Pasadena to visit
friends, and she, too, never returned. Oli
ver began a quiet inquiry and soon came
to the conclusion that his wife, to whom
he had been wedded thirteen years ago,
had played him false, but shunning public
disgrace and hoping she would return he
confided his trouble to only a few intimate
friends. Sayre's friends supposed he had
left town on business, so the story of the
elopement was kept quiet for nearly a
week.
Sayre's wife and daughter, the latter 17
years old, and a son aged 13, live on a bee
ranch at Nordhoff, Ventura County. Mrs.
Sayre never suspected infidelity on the
part of her husband, whose business kept
him from home most of the time. The
news of the elopement was a great shock
to her. Only recently Sayre took Mr. and
Mrs. Oliver to Nordhoff to visit his family.
Mrs. Oliver's parents, who live at High
land Park, are greatly grieved over her
course and have invited Mr. Oliver to
share their home.
JUOGE RETMERT'S CAREER.
Secured a Fortune From thm Jh'amnut
Silver King Mine.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 27.â Judge
James de Noon Keymert, who died at his
home at Alhambra Tuesday evening of
Bright's disease, and was laid to rest to
day, had a notable career. He was a na
tive of Norway, and claimed close ki.iship
to the royal family of that country, being
able to trace his lineage back to
King Canute of Denmark. After working in
the copper mines in Wales and srraduating
from a law school at Edinburgh, he came
to America when still a very youne man.
He settled in the wilds of Wisconsin and
began life there as schoolteacher, after
ward devoting himself to the practice of
law. Owing to the prominent part he took
in framing the constitution of Wisconsin
as a State he became known as one of the
"fathers of Wisconsin." After the State
was admitted he served five years in the
As-embly and three in the Senate, repre
senting Milwaukee city and county. He
was for a number of years i" charge of the
United States land office of Milwaukee and
in 1860 ran for Congress on tlio Douglas
Democratic ticket and was defeated.
When the Civil War broke out Reymert
went to New York City and practiced law,
his income from this source amounting to
$50,000 a year. While in New York he
was elected Judge of the Circuit Court of
Appeals and served one term. His health
failing in 1877 he went to Chile, where he
engaged in mining and ranching on a
large scale until 1884, when he went to San
Francisco and resumed law practice.
Being threatened with pulmonary
troubles he soon removed to Arizona,
where he prospected, located and opened
the famous Silver King mine, which made
him a fortune. In 1889 he gave up active
mining and came to Los Angelea, again
devoting his attention to law. He pur
chased a fine suburban Dome at Alhambra,
where he died suddenly on Tuesday at the
age of 74.
JACKSOX, THE STRASGLER.
Captain Lee* Askt That the Sentencing
of the Culyrtt Â¥te Postponed.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 27.â Frank
P. Jackson, who throttled a woman in a
disorderly house last night and is sus
pected of being the San Francisco stran
gler, pleaded guilty to the charge of cat
tery in the Police Court to-day and will be
sentenced to-morrow. As he was inter
rupted before he left any marks of vio
lence on the woman no more serious
charge than battery could be placed
against him. Jackson has little to say
about the matter and answers questions
evasively. The police are still of the opin
ion that he is a dangerous man.
Captain Lees telegraphed to Chief Glass
to-day to postpone the sentence until he
had time to communicate with Glas3 by
mail. It is understood that Lees tele
graphed at the request of Jackson's brother,
who has an explanation to offer. The
police are reticent about the matter, and
interesting developments are expected
when L es' letter arrives. The denizens of
the tenderloin district are greatly excited
over the occurrence.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 27.â E. L.
Campbell and R. C. Goodspeed, the di
vorced husband of Mrs. Lucy C. Good
speed, were appointed administrators of
the latter's estate this morning, and, in
her place, the administrators of the will of

the sum of $36,000. Charles P. Hanlon,
who was attorney for Mrs. Goodspeed,
was in court, but he interposed no oDjec
tion to anything that was done.
BORN MM WASHIXGTOti'S TIME.
Death of a Colored Woman at the Age of
108 Trmrm.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 27. â Mrs.
Lucy Arthur, said to have been the oldest
woman on the Pacific Coast, died this
morning. Born in slavery and having
lived in bondage for a half century; the
mother of seventeen children, of whom
but two survive, the younger being 50
years old; died at the remarkable age of
108 years, 3 months and 23 daysâ that, in
Drief, is the history of the aged colored
woman whose longevity has been the as
tonishment of all who have known her.
She possessed all her faculties to the last
and up to yesterday could thread a needle.
Mrs. Lucy Arthur was born in Knox
County, Ky., and for fifty years did not
know what it was to Dreathe the air of
freedom. For over thirty years she had
lived in this city and was known as
"Auntie" Arthur. She had seen several of
her children grow to manhood and woman
hood, become fathers and mothers and
finally die of old age. Recently she
buried her only surviving daughter, old
"Auntie" Cleggett, who had attained the
age of 73 years. Her eldest surviving son
is three score and six.
Mrs. Arthur was born when the Revolu
tionary War was fresh in tne minds of
everybody, and a year before Washington
was inaugurated as the first President of
the United States. Besides her own chil
dren, six grandchildren survive her. She
will be buried from the colored Baptist
Church on Sunday.
HAIL AKJ* LIGHTA'iyO.
Damage Done to Stockton Fruit Trees by
a Storm.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 27.â Stockton
was to-night visited by a terrific hail
storm, accompanied by thunder, lightning
and wind. The hail fell in large quantity,
and some of the fruit orchards now in
blossom will suffer severely.
ljyndall Miller, a prominent real estate
man, was on his way home whtn over
taken by the storm, and took refuge under
a large tree. An electric current passed
down the tree and struck him, throwing
him to the ground and stunning him. He
was taken to his home and will be con
fined to his room for several days.
A number of chimneys were cracked
and broken by the lightning.
ARRESTED AT GRAYSON.
Rancher Canty and His Brother
in-Law Are in a Serious
Predicament.
Arraigned for Taking "White Hat"
McCarty's Horses Out of a
Receiver's Hands.
MODESTO, Cat.., March 27.â Another
chapter TOM to-day added to ihe disgust- i
ing horse-starving episode on the J. M.
Canty Ranch, near Modesto. Rancher
Canty, who allowed over half a hundred of ;
"White Hat" McCarty's horses to perish
and 240 others to become so feeble from I
lack of nourishment that they will never i
fully recover, all because McCarty failed j
to advance money for their pasturage, was j
arrested. His brother-in-law was also !
taken into custody. The two had taken I
the remainder of McCarty's horses out of ;
the hands of a receiver and driven them
to a corral in Grayson.
Several weeks ago McCarthy was ar
rested for failing to pay for food for his \
band of thoroughbreds, many of which j
have jow records as trotters and sprinters, j
He was acquitted, but the horses were
attached and placed in the hands of a re
ceiver. He removed them from the barren
corral in which they had suffered the
pangs of hunger and which contained the
carcases of dozens that had succumbed
and placed them in a good pasture.
District Attorney Fulkerth and County
Assessor Campbell were notified to-day
that Canty and his brother-in-law, Mc-
Donald, had taken the horses from this
tield and driven them to Grayson yester
day. These officials at once procured war
rants for the arrest of the pair for illegally
removing property under attachment by
the county. They were apprehended and
arraigned. McDonald was released on his
own recognizance and Canty gave bail,
with J. M. Ritchey and \V. A. Funck as
sureties.
Tue charge against them is considered a
grave one, and it is believed that Canty
will at last be made to suffer, in a meas
ure, for having deliberately starved dumb
brutes to death.
The remainder of McCarthy's horses
will be sold for personal-property tax on
Monday next.
GIFT TO SAyiA. CRUZ COVMY.
Claua Spreckela Donates Valuable Land
for a JPubtie Highway.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., March 27.-Clau3
Spreckels has evidenced his interest in the
welfare of Santa Cruz County by donating
to it a strip of land fifty feet wide and a
mile long, extending from the county road
to Aptos Beach, to be used forever as a
public highway. This donation is an
preciated, from the fact that a few years
ago the strip was the subject of litigation,
the county claiming it as a public high
way, while Mr. Spreckels contended that
it was his private land. The result of the
litigation proved that Mr. Spreckels' con
tention was correct. Now he has donated
the strip to the county without considera
tion, his only desire oeine that the public
shall use it. The land donated is very
valuable.

Ranches Are Inundated by
an Overflow of the
Mokelumne.
MISTAKE OF A FARMER.
Cuts a Levee for Irrigating Pur
poses and Fails to Control
the Torrent
GREAT DAMAGE IS EXPECTED.
Efforts to Repair the Break Prove
Unsuccessfulâ Hop Crops May
Be Ruined.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 27.â W. 8.
Montgomery, who lives about a mile from
Lockeford, yesterday cut the levee of the
Mokelumne River, which passes through
his place, and as a result the country for
several miles around is under water. Sev
eral farms are inundated, and the loss will
be heavy.
Montgomery cut the levee for the pur
pose of letting the water in on to his Jand
to irrigate it, but in the meantime the
river rose suddenly as a result of the re
cent rain and it was impossible to mend
the cut before the water had spread OTer
the country. It continues to pour through
the cut, which is becoming larger, and
there is danger of the hop region, which is
on higher ground, being also flooded. In
that event the loss will be very great. The
water is creeping up to the more elevated
ground, and the hop-growers are greatly
alarmed.
The break in the levee is now twenty
feet wide and eight feet deep. An attempt
is being made 10 stop it, but it is almost
impossible to do an3'thing so strong is the
volume of water pouring through the cap.
A small levee recently built by Rancher
Kerr on the side of the main levee was not
strong enough to cneck the rush of watera
and was washed away.
As yet it is impossible to estimate the
loss. If the river should fall in the next
few days and the water p"ass off the land
damage to the crops might not be so great
as is feared. It is possible! that a damage
suit will be brought against Montgomery
for cutting the levee.
A telephone message from Lockeford at
a late hour this evening says: The watera
in the inundated district are still rising
and the trouble is greatly aggravated by
the heavy rainfall in the upper country
this afternoon. The farmers are greatly
alarmed, and it is feared the levees below
the original break will give way before the
pressure of the water running through the
place where the cut was made. The warm
weather for the past few days has started a
large volume of snow water down from the
mountains. The people about Lockeford
will make an effort to-morrow to stay vhe
flood by placing artificial filling across the
cut and then pumping the water back into
its original channel.

REQUEST FOR TROOPS.
Acting Governor Sadler Asked
to Invoke Government
Protection.
SHERIFF WILL DO HIS DUTY.
The Executive Says the State Cannot j
Furnish a Private Bodyguard
of Soldiers.
CARSON, Nev., March 27.âCorrespond
ence that passed between Attorney W.
T. Baggett and acting Governor Sadler
to-day leads to the conclusion that an at
fempt will be made to return H. W.
Tangerman as superintendent of the Hala
& Norcross mines at Virginia City. Tan
german was recently escorted from the I
town by a crowd of miners and warned |
never to return. Governor Sadler received
the following to-day:
San Francisco, March 25, 1896.
Dear Sir: The unlawful conduct of certain
citizens of your State In kidnaping and by
force compelling H. W. Tangerman, a reputable
citizen of this State, to leave Virginia City, has
naturally met the condemnation of all right
thinking, law-abiding people. Mr. Tangerman
has informed me that he conversed with you
concerning this matter, with a view to seeing
what, if any, protection you, as the chief ex
ecutive of the. State of Nevada, could afford
him In case 'he should insist upon his lawful
right to continue his busiues-ti as superin
tendent of the Hale & Norcross Mining Com
pany. I am not certain what your conclusions
were from Mr. Tangerman's statement tome.
I would therefore, as .his attorney, and as at
torney for the Hale <fc Norcross Mining Com
pany, respectfully ask you to now inform me
whether or not the State of Nevada could or
would furnish sufficient military force to re
instate Mr. Tangerman in his position at
Virginia City as superintendent of the Hale â &
Norcross Mining .Company and insure him
protection from personal violence.
It is known that the application to the Sheriff
of therounty on behalf of Mr. Tangerman met
with either a direct refusal or a confession of
inability on the part of that officer to ufford him
protection from the outrage which he received
ou last Saturday at the hands of certain indi
viduals claiming to be members of the Miners'
Union at Virginia City. If it is impossible for
the State of Nevada to afford the necessary pro
tection to Mr. Tangerman to conduct his lawful
business, as is guaranteed by the constitution
of your Stute and every other State in the civil
izf-d world, then I ask if you will aid us in
making the proper representations to the Fed
eral Government for such aid as may be neces
sary under the circumstances of this aggravated
case.
Mr. Tangerman spoke very highly of you nnd
your sympathy for him in the embarassing
position in which he had been placed, for
which, allow me. on behalf of him and his
friends here, to thank you. Will you be kind
enough to answer this communication at your
earliest convenience, as I desire to to take some
action in the m;:tter! I should be very much j
pleased to meet you if you could find it con- i
venient to be in Pan Francisco at any very early j
date. Again thanking you for your considera- i
tion and sympathy, I remain yours very re
spectfully, \V. T. Baggett.
Acting Governor Sadler sent this reply:
State of Nevada, Executive Chamber, J
Carson, Nev., March 27 j
W. T. Baggctt, Esq. San Franciscoâ Sir: Your
communication of the 25th inst. duly received.
In reply would respectfully refer you to section
18 of an act approved March 6, 1893, Nevada
statutes, entitled "An act relating to the
National Guard and the ec rolled militia," and
further state that the Sheriff of Storey County
has personally assured me that he will extend
all the protection in his power to the Hale <fc
Norcross Company or to any person connected
therewith. Up to this date the executive
department of this State has received no official
notice oi any insurrection, riot or resistance to
the laws of this State, or any request from any
proper source for assistance In the execution
of the laws. You can readily understand that
It is not In the power of the chief executive or
of any officer to furnish a special bodyguard
for private purposes, and until the require
ments embodied in section 18, heretofore
referred to, are complied with I can take no
official notice of the matter. Respectfully,
Reinhold Sadler, Acting Governor.
8 AST A. ROSA'S UAlt-Ii SUIT.
Mock's Application for an Injunction
' .Submitted for a Decision.
SANTA ROSA, Cal..' March 27.âAn
other phase of the celebrated suit of Wesley
Mock against the city of Santa Rosa was
ended here to-day. This particular Dart
of the litigation was the application of
Mock for an interlocutory injunction to
restrain the city from accepting the new
â¢waterworks. The case was tried before
Judge Daingerfield of San Francisco, who
is holding court in place of Judge Dough
erty, the latter Judge being disqualified
by reason of his " being a taxpayer. Five
days was occupied in taking the testimony,
and about the same amount of time was
consumed by the six attorneys interested
in the arguments.
Attorney Lynch of San Francisco opened
for the plaintiff and talked for nearly two
days., He -was followed by his colleague,
C. ,8. Farquar, who consumed . several
hours. Judge DeHaven then presented
briefly his view of the case for the city in
a terse and vigorous speech of two hours,
leaving the details of the defense to Judge
Butledge and; the City Attorney. Attor
ney Goodwin of San Francisco, for Con
tractors Perkins and Robert Effey, also
addressed the court in behalf of his clients,
and the long war of words was ended by
the plaintiff's lawyers in another day and
a half of talk. â  :

L.ITEI) IX SAXTA BARBARA.
Career of Judge Huse, Kotc in an Insane
Asylittn.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 27.â
Judge Charles S. Huse, the Highlands
asylum inmate, to free whom a strong
effort is being made, was a well-known
resident of this city, and once a man of
great wealth. Judge Huse was sent to the
Napa a3ylum from this place about twelve
years ago upon the complaint of his wife.
He was a prominent attorney here, in
active practice for many years.
Judge Huso was a man of great natural
ability, a craduate of Harvard, and at one
time owned considerable land here. Both
the Judge and his wife were held in high
esteem, being generous to a fault, and it
was through his excessive liberality that
their large property was dissipated. When
about 55 years of age, he broke down men
tally, being harassed at times by strange
delusions, his one predominant fancy
beinir that there* were "devil threads" in
his clothing. The authorities at Napa
afterward declared that it was almost im
possible to keep him in clothing, nothing
but the stoutest duck being capal>le of re
sisting his constant hunt for "devil
threads." This peculiar habit is still
noted. Press reports state that his brain
appears to be perfectly clear, the only
peculiarity notable about him being a per
sistent picking at his clothes.

MADERA COUNTY JUSTICE
j An Arbitrary Assessment Levied
Against "Cattle King"
Henry Miller.
Disastrous Result of Swearing Falsely
to the Number of His
" Stock.
MADERA, Cal., March 27.â The largest
arbitrary assessment ever made in Cali
fornia was to-day placed on the rolls of
this county by Assessor Lou Hoskins.
The assessment was against Henry Miller,
the cattle king.
Miller came here a short time ago and
cave to the Assessor his statement of the
number of cattle owned or controlled by
the firm of Miller <t Lux, and which were
in this county at 12 o'clock on the first
Monday in March of this year. The state
ment was sworn to, and was to the effect
that the firm had only 3000 stock cattle and
500 calves in this county at that time. The
Assessor discovered that there were in this
county at that time 5000 stock cattle, 500
calves and 1300 beef cattle, in addition to
the 3000 stock cattle and 500 calves sworn
to by Miller. The Assessor then made the
assessment arbitrarily at the values and
sums named, as follows: Five hundred
calves, $12,000; 5000 stock cattle, $320,000;
1808 beef cattle, $208,000.
It is believed that the Assessor got his
information some time a^o, when he and
his deputy went down on the Columbia
ranch presumably on a fishing trip.

MISS SARA HALL, LEADER IN TUE SANTxV ROSA CONTEST.
[From a photograph.]
\ that balloting will now commence in ear
j nest. Next Wednesday has been selected
I for a general voting day, when every one
I in town will be asked to deposit one ticket
for his favorite candidate. It is believed
that fully 5000 will be cast on that day,
and there may be many changes in the
list. It is generally conceded that the race
will be between Mrs. L. W. Burris and
Miss Sara Hall, though Wednesday's vote
may upset all calculations. There are now
nearly 10,000 people in this city and sub
urbs, and one ballot from every third per
son would cause a change to come over the
spirit of some one's dreams.
All efforts are now being concentrated
to make the floral ball a success. Many
unique features will be introduced, among
them a complicated grand match to be led
by Charles Rohrer. This gentleman is a
past-master in ballroom tactics, having
carried off the first prize at a fashionable
"cake walk" given here several years ago.
and he will lead the merry dancers
through some evolutions not down in the
"Chambiiss Diary."
The first lot of 10,000 carnival envelopes
is exhausted and the committee has or
dered 20,000 more o! the same design. The
committee on decoration has ordered
several cases of fancy-paper decorations,
in carnival colors of green, red and yellow.
They will consist of shields, horseshoes,
stars and welcome mottoes, so constructed
as to allow the floral decorations to be
added.
It has been decided that special invita
tions to the floral ball will not be issued,
but that a general invitation will be ex
tended for all to attend, either upon the
dancing floor or as spectators.
SAN JOSE'S PAGEANT.
The Floral Procession Will lie Two Miles
Long.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 27.â The floral
parade on the opening day of the Carnival
of Roses in this city, in May, will be the
most magnificent pageant that ever
threaded the streets of a Pacific Coast city.
At least that is the outlook as judged from
the success with which Colonel A. K.
Whitton and other members of the parade
committee are meeting and the enthusi
asm displayed in carnival matters by the
people of the city and county. So far
thirty-six floats have been ordered, and it
is certain that twice this number in addi
tion will be in the parade, which will be
over two miles long.
A feature of the parade will be two com
panies of floral laucers, partaking of the
nature of cavalry. The companies will
appear in floral baldrics and the horses
will be covered with floral housings and
trappings. To add to this fine military
effect the lancers will carry floral lances
resting on their stirrups.
There will also be a large representation
of coaches, T-carts, dogcarts and other
fancy gigs owned and driven by the promi
nent ladies of the city and the county. A
large number of ladies have already en
tered upon this work. Their outfits will
appear to the very heighth of floral deco
rative work, and the effort is to be made
the greater because of valuable prizes that
will be offered.
The parade will consist of five divisions,
each headed by a band, and most of the
displays of the surrounding towns will be
preceded by* musical organizations. It is
estimated that the floats alone will make
a parade a mile long. Besides these there
will be private carriages and hundreds
upon hundreds of school children who
will be afoot.
The Santa Clara County Floral Society's
exhibit will be one of the most attractive.
Over $400 will be spent on it, and it will
require some 15,000 roses of one variety
alone to make up part of the decorations.
Other societies will have fine floats in the
parade. Grand Marshal Wright has ap
pointed Fred W. Moore as his chief of
staff and C. C. Derby of New Almaden as
his chief aid.
HEAVY TOTE AT HEALDHBURO.

HEALDSBURG, Cal., March 27.âPrep
arations for Healdsburg's floral festival
are progressing admirably, and the various
committees are already hard at work ar
ranging for the fiesta. To-day the heaviest
vote thus far was cast in the queen's con
test. Miss Alice Haigh, one of Northern
Sonoma's belles, jumped from eighth
place in the contest to third, and Mrs. C.

SXOW AT THE SUMMIT.
Hearleit Storm of the Season Raging on
the Mountains.
SUMMIT,,CaI., March 27.â The heaviest
snowstorm of the season has prevailed
here for the past two days. It is estimated
that nearly five feet of snow has fallen
since the storm commenced, late Wednes
day night. Previous to the snowstorm a
heavy ram prevailed for nearly four days,
robbed the Sierras of their white mantle,
and caused mother earth to manifest itself
in manj' places where its presence was
hitherto unknown at this season. The
present snowfp.ll redeems the name of the
Sierra Nevada. Haa it not occurred the
right to the title of "snow-capped' might
have been questioned.
No damage has occurred to track or
sheds in this vicinity. The snow was set
tling on the track this morning, near Tun
nel 13, but a flanger soon cleared the
track of all obstacles and trains are run
ning as usual. Â»

DULL DAY FOR STRIKERS
The Situation Among Painters
Was One of Peace and
Hope.
VISIT TO THE CITY HALL.
Incompetent Workmen, Bad Materials
and Poor Work Said to Have
Been Found.
The situation in the painters' strike re
mained unchanged yesterday, which fact
was due largely to the rain and the partial
victory of the strikers. Many union paint
ers who had been working for some days
were compelled to desist yesterday be
cause of tne weather, but they made use of
their enforced idleness by meeting fellow
union men at 115 Turfc street and ex
changing cheerful views of their success.
There was a meeting of the Painters'
Union in the morning at Turk-street
Temple. It was an executive session. The
attendance was noticeably less than at re
cent gatherings of the union, but every
man present understood that this wa3 one
of the most hopeful and healthful signs of
the struggle. Indeed, one member re
marked that he wished there were fewer
present, meaning that in such event more
union painters would be working for in
creased wages and on the card system.
The decrease in this meeting was ac
counted for by the fact that a respectable
proportion of the members were engaged
in union shops about town upon indoor
work.
Practically no action of importance bear
ing upon the strike was taken at the meet
ing, for the reason there was nothing to
be done. So the time was profitably occu
pied in making and listening to short
speeches on the present condition and out
look of the strike. Harmony was a pre-
dominant feature of the discussions, mixed
with words of mutual encouragement and
something of an inclination to be con
gratulatory over success achieved so far.
"We are on the winning side," said R. T.
Mclvor, business manager of the union,
"and we know it.
"We expect that to-morrow and Monday
many bosses will ask us to come back to
work for them. Of course our union men
will accept, although on the understand
ing that everything required by the union
in regard to wages, working hours and the
card shall be adopted.
"While there are but a few shops belong
ing to the master painters in the associa
tion now employing union painters,
we have positive information that several
association bosses are growing dissatisfied
and are thinking of employing union men
immediately-' 1
"DOPE" ON THE CITY HALL.
Jobbery and Bad Workmen Said to
Be Found on the New Dome.
As an incident of the strike R. T. Mc-
Ivor paid a visit to the City Hall yesterday
just to ascertain what was the condition of
the men employed on the tower. What
he observed was enough to cause a vast
deal of trouble, and certainly it was a
revelation to the union workmen.
"I found a number of men painting, or
more correctlj daubing, the roof of the
tower," said he, "with some stuff that
looked like paint. It was evident from the
first glance that they were not tradesmen,
that they had not learned the trade of
painting, but were simply nothing more
nor less than laborers. And they were
.working for $1 a day. Think of it, men
putting a covering that looked like paint
on part of the roof of the City building for
f 1 v day !
"Their work made me suspicious thatall
was not quite right on that contract, so I
went downstairs to make an investigation.
I dug up the contract and found that it
had been grossly violated. The contract
was between the" City and Lewis & O'Con
nor, and, I believe, was sublet to some one
else. Its specifications provided that the
iron roof should be scraped and cleaned on
old and new work and should then be cov
ered with one coat of paint.
"When I went up there on the roof to
day I found that these laborers were put
tins: on the stuff over everything â rust,
dirt and water. They had not scraped or
cleaned the roof and were not doing so.
Besides the mixtures they laid on was not
paint; it might be a mixture of oil and a
little metallic, but it was no good.
"I shall see the superintendent of con
struction to-morrow and lay this matter
before him. If he does not choose to do
the right thing we shall make a stir about
it that may surprise people. In the event
that he would refuse to replace the men
at work with competent union painters,
we should call off the cornice-workers
now employed on the dome.
"While the Cornice-workers' Union is
not yet affiliated with the Building Trades
Council they are with itt to a man. There
are not more than eighty or ninety cornice
workers in San Francisco, but nearly every
one of ttiem is a member of the union, so
they are well organized and are expected
to come into the Building Trades Council
almost immediately. Of course I have rot
the power to call them off a job, but as
they are all in hearty sympathy with us I
hare their assurance of their support.
"If the superintendent do not pay any
attention we can only conclude that he is
not in sympathy with us. Anyhow, a
man in his position ought to know the
difference between a novice and an
experienced mechanic, not to speak of the
jobbery that was apparent."
EVASION OF THE CARD.
Master Painters Claim to Have
Found a Way Out of a
Dilemma.
The master painters will not admit that
the journeymen have anything the best of
it, but on the contrary are inclined to be
positive that the victory is on their own
side. Their president, E. H. Black, stated
that so far but one association shop had
acceded to the demands of the union, and
that was McCord's.
"McCord had to do it," said Black. "His
contracts were in dwellings, where the
carpets were all torn up and furniture
packed away, and the people demanded
that the jobs be finished.
"It was like getting an extension of time.
The day this work is done McCord can tell
his union men he has nothing more for
them to do, but at the same time he can
have non-union men on another job.
"The journeymen complain that the
card is not properly understood. One can
have different views on the subject. For
instance, the card provides that no mem
ber of the Painters' Union shall work on
a job with a non-union painter. It does
not say anything about not working in
an association shoo. Now, members of
our association might accept the card sys
tem, though I don't say they would, and
have only union painters employed on a
job where union carpenters, etc., were
working. At the same time the same
master painter may have a job over on
North Beach, and there is notning in th 6
card to prevent him from having four or
five non-union men doiug the work. You
see tbey could work by themselves, for
while union painters would object to york
on a job with non-union men there could
be no objection to this arrangement. So
â¢we have concluded that this cant is not
such a wonderfully clever thing after all.
"All the men who canâ in and out of the
unionâ are getting work some place or
another. They have come to realize that
if the master painters should give in there
would not be any more men employedâ at
most not more than fifteen to twenty men.
There is no work for all, so what can be
done either way, anyhow? Whatever
surrender there may be on the part of the
master painiers it will only be as an expe
dient that certain pressing contracts may
be finished. And then the union journey
men will be no better off than before."
CARPENTERS ASSIST.
The Powerful Union, No. 22, Lends
a Helping Hand to the
Painters.
Carpenters' Union No. 22 met last night
in Odd|Fellows' Hall, and without debating
the auestion decided to take 350 tickets for
the Painters' Union benefit to be given In
Bush -street Theater next Wednesday
night.
The carpenters also took notice of the
open mass-meetint? of the unions affiliated
in the Building Trades Council to be held
Tuesday night. At this meeting the im
portant question of putting the card into
effect on April 1, as already decided, will
be fully discussed.
As many as fourteen carpenters took aa
vantage last night of the present low ini
tiation fee of Union Xo. 22 and joined.
For the present the fee is ?2, but one
month hence it will be raised to $10.
SHOT IN A BARROOM.
â¢â¢Bull" Harrington Probably Fatally
Wounded by Saloon-Keeper McNulty.
James alias "Bull" Harrington, a team
ster living at 1445 Minna street, was shot
and probably fatally wounded by James
McNulty, a saloon-keeper on Sixteenth
and Mission streets, last night. The
wounded man was carried to the Receiving
Hospital about 9 o'clock, Dr. Bunnell at
tending him.
Yesterday afternoon Harrington and
one William McNamara, both well known
in police circles, made a tour of the Mis
sion-street saloons, reaching McNulty's
place about (J o'clock. From the best evi
dence obtainable it seems that the two
men were excited and inclined to be de
cidedly belligerent. They called for
drinks in a very insulting way, and not
being served quite as quickly as they de
sired, began to abuse McXulty. The shoot
ing ensued with the result stated.
Harrington was found to be dangerously
wounded, and it was advisable to remove
him to the Receiving Hospital. The ball
lodged in the back, but the feeble condi
tion of the man would not admit of its
being probed for.
At 10 o'clock last night McNulty was
arrested and lodged in the Seventeenth
street station, charged with assault to
murder. He claims that the shooting was
done in self-defense.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 27.â 0f 500
Italians -who arrived from Naples on the
steamship Hindostan 100 have been de
tained at Ellis island because t^hey have no
money and no definite idea of what they
are going to do in America. The 100 had
an average of only $7 each, and many were
without baggage.
On the Chateau Yquem, which arrived
on Tuesday, there were 1205 Italians, in
cluding only thirty women, only four of
whom had railroad tickets west of Phila
delphia. They were a part of the multi
tude that hibernate 3in Italy and whan
warm weather comes here set sail for New
York. Most of them have no intention of
becoming; citizens.
Commissioner Senner has detained 400
of the Chateau's emigrants. The ship was
chartered by a man named De Lucia of
Naples from Funch, Edyee & Co., her
agents, and as Commissioner Senner does
not know anything: about De Lucia the ex
penses of the detention will fall on Funch,
Edyee & Co., who neglected to make a
contract with l)e Lucia providing that he
should assume the responsibility for de
tained and deported emigrants.
MIXI&TER WARD'S SPEECH.
Argued Against the JEttabllahtnent of a
â  j Sinking Fund.
LONDON, Enq., March 27.â A dispatch
from Wellington, New Zealand, says that
the report of the speech delivered at
Wintoh on Tuesday last by the Hon. J. G.
Ward, Minister of Marine, was inaccurate.
Mr. Ward was arguing against providing a
sinking fund, predicting that within fifty
years it would be necessary for the British
colonies to obtain millions of pounds to
assist in maintaining the floating defenses
of the empire. The original dispatches
lr-om * Wellington said that Mr. Ward de
clared that New Zealand must shortly ex
pect to have her debt largely increased.
The colony could not always expect Great
Britain to protect it, and. it would
soon be necessary to : obtain millions of
pounds to provide its own fleet. .V ;

OUT OF HIS SKIN.
: An Oregonian Who Says That Bo
Might Be in That Pre- .
dicament.
He Proposes to Help In a Very Good
Work, and Has Good Reason
I to Do So.
: : â "*
Some people in this world who are brimful
of happiness have the faculty of keeping that
fact to themselves, as though they were afraid
that some of it might escape and they would
be a little poorer on that account. But there
are sensible folks, thoughâ enough to make up
for these poor misers, and one of these bright,
whole-souled men is Mr. E. W. Fowler of
Kamele, Or. Some time ago Mr. Fowler, who,
as has been noted above, was celebrated on ac-
count of his good nature and bis vivacity, be-
gan to droop a little. His smile had not that
sunniness nor his laugh that hearty ring as of
yore. Those who knew him began to sympa-
thize with him, to tell him how sorry they
were to see him "going down the hill," and Â»
hundred other equally dispiriting things.
And then they had Mr. Fowler as good as
under ground. But they were reckoning with-
out their host. I They forgot that be was a man
of good sense and knew where to look for help,
and they had neglected to remember that thÂ»
grand old Hudson Medical Institute was still
in existence, and that its corps of great special-
ists were dally, nay, hourly, working wonder-
ful cures. The following letter will show how
wrong these prophets were:

gence in not writing you before. Ido not think:

'to you for your valuable treatment. 1 can and will
distribute about a hundred of your new circulars.
Yours gladly. . E. \V. FOWLER.
You see, all the Joy has come back to that
man's heartâ the'llfe and hope. And there
are many hundreds of hearts on this Coast that

S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles: "I now feel as
though \ was a cured and well man."
Mr. J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah: "I am
cured of the terrible disease that I had."
Now, when there is a never-ending stream of
testimony like this continually pouring in to
the management of the great Hudson Medical
Institute (the grandest curative establishment
on this continent, if not in the world) how can
it be doubted but that there, is HOPE FOR

FBOM EVERY QUARTER.
A Day Spent Among Some of the City's
Big Men on Various
Streets.
"You say that you are interviewing the
big merchants of the City," remarked a
friend of mine this morning os I was com
ing over on the boat. Like a score or more
of other people I have the fortune, eood or
bad, to live in Oakland, and recognizing in
me the individual who had been searching
for information as to the merits of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla he thought fit to
continue his query with this: "There is
no man better known in town than Colonel
Andrews; why don't you go and see him?"
I replied. "I should be delighted to, if I
could happen to catch the genial colonel."
"You would not wait for him, I sup
pose?"
I paid: "No; my business is to get at
haphazard the opinions of people whom I
may find, and to make an appointment
with a man would possibly give him time
to prepare a speech. I have found that
off-hand a man generally tells the truth,
and that happens to he jnst exactly what
is looked for in this inquiryâ nothing
else."
"Well, I think it would be a satisfaction
to me at any rate," said mv friend, "if you
could quote so well known a man as
Colonel Andrews." And so I decided to
see him if I could.
In no instance, excepting this one. have
T gone back for an appointment. Time is
money, and it might savor a trifle of in
tention if I were to make arrangements to
meet any one at any specified time for a
particular purpose, and the plain aim has
neen to make these interviews the genuine
gist of popular opinion about Joy's Vege
table Sarssparilla. For the sake of variety
I trotted from one street to another, and
took the following interviews absolutely at
random:
THE OI.DFST OTTICTAN.
T got off the car just above the Examiner
office and wandered in a sort of aimless
way into the store â one micrht almost call
it a palaceâ of Mr. C. Muller, 824 Market
street. A man of my years feels if not a
sense of nwe at any Y.i'te a sense of deep
respect when interviewing a man like Mr.
Muller. No one who knows anything of
local history is not aware that he has been
foremost in promoting in San Francisco
the oculist's science. He has not been
backward in advancing moi. y for that
purpose, and since 1863 (just a mere mat
ter of thirty-three years') he has been
recognized as our best optician. Mr. Mul
ler is enthusiastically a Californian. It is
scarcely necessary to say that he was not
born here, but tie could hardly be more
"gripped with hooks of steel" to California
than he is. I asked Mr. Muller if he had
ever used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
He said: "Yes: I have used, I thintt, a
number of bottles." Then was question
and answer for about ten minutes, and the
gist of what Mr. Muller said was this:
"Some five years ago I was very mnoh
rnn down. I felt that change of life which
man sometimes feels; my health was j
fairly eood, but my energy was lacking.
I could attend to my business, but not in
the same way a" I had been accustomed
toâ it was a little hit of a labor. I tried to
overcome the feeling, but could not, and
some one suggested to me that 1 should
try Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I did,
and its effects were so satisfactory from
the first bottle that I thought it best to
take another, and I can assure you that
for five years I have never been without it.
Don't imagine from this that I have taken
it continuously, or that I have taken the
dose prescribed of it re?nlarly. I found it
did me good and then I brought my com
mon sense to bear on the matter, and
eventually I found that a thimbleful was
enough to make me feel well enough to go
to business and to attend to it without
worry. In a word, it made a new man of
me. Should any one ask me as to the
benefit? that I have derived from its use,
why of course I should be more than
pleased to add my word of praise to the
score of people who have testified to you
about it. I have no hesitation in saying
that in my opinion it is the best pro
prietary remedy that we have, and 1 say
this simply and solely because it has done
me personally so much good."
Mr. Muiler has done a good deal for
science and for humanity in confining
himself exclusively or almost exclusively
to correcting errors of refraction in eve
pight. The oculist seems to have a dis
tinct objection to the optician going out
side of his given position of fitting glasses
to weak eyes, and so Mr. Muller has been
a little hit handicapped in his professional
investigations. Many of us remember
well (when he examined the eve with in
struments especially prepared by himself)
that he was able to detect Bright's disease
as clearly as Professor Barnard can see the
spots on the sun. But for some reason or
other he evoked , the jealousy of some
prominent oculists, and now Mr. Muller is
devoting his life to perfecting the business
or profession of an optician. That he
stands at the head of the men who follow
him can scarcely be doubted.
DIAMONDS DROPPING LIKE RAIN.
Faithful to the promise made. Colonel
Andrews was visited at his Diamond
Palace on Montgomery street, close to
Pine. He was in a somewhat reminiscent
mood, but was willing to talk of every
thing from the Mexican war to the Mc-
Kinley tariff. "I believe," said the
colonel, "in everything Californian. I
have my clothes made here; I have my
shoe's made here; I have my hats made
here, and my wife gets her things made
here. I do think that once I bought a
dress for my better half in Boston, because
it was particularly beautiful, but so far as
I know there is nothing that can be had
in California that 1 do not buy here. I
have made my money here, and I intend
to spend it here."
Then, asked as to his opinion as to Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla, he said: "Of
coarse I have heard of it, who has not,
tut I have not had occasion to use it. I
r.ever spent two dollars in medicine in my
life, but you may quote me as saying that
if I wanted a sarsaparilla I certainly would
use Joy's, for it is a home product. You
mÂ»>" further state that I say that I have
heird it spoken of enthusiastically, and I
Bm really glad to know that any home pro
duct is thought so highly of as Joy's Veget
able Sarsaparilla appears to be." The
colonel said a whole lot more, but he
wished to be quoted shortly, and there is
no gaod reason for ignoring his request.
j(R. BENEDICT OF "THE HASTINGS."
Twi'Hog round on my heel 1 started
south having an intention to go to lunch,
and as the north side of Market street
offers iome inducements to the hungry
man I had that point in view, but when I
reached the corner of Sutter street the
attractive display in "The Hastings"
clothing-store "brought me up with a
round turn," as the sailors put it. I
dropped in TÂ»nd met Mr. C. S. Benedict, one
of the proprietors who has been associated
with the house since 1862. "The Hast
ings" occupies a tvosition in the clothing
world of Â£aB Francisco which no other
house does. They have a factory in New
York at 24 Â»nd 26 West Fourth street and
the/ self here in the wild and woolly West
all the clothes that are made in the hard
and frosty East. They sell nothing that
they do not make themselves, and if any
one wants to wear for general business use
a better suit of clothes than Mr. Benedict
showed me yesterday, and which by the
by he sells for ?10, I think that individual
must be slightly hard to please. It was
really a suit of a nice modest pattern,
woolen goods and tailored as well as one
could expect an ordinary work-a-day suit
to be. We are not all leaders of fashion
and most of us want serviceable clothes.
"Have you ever heard of Joy's Vege
table Sarsaparilla?" I asked Mr. Benedict.
"1 have certainly heard of it. and I have
used it." said Mr/Benedict, "but I thins
probably if you want to know anything
about it, if I give you a living exhibit, it
will be much more to the point."
Then he stated in anticipation : "I havp
a son who is in the store at this moment
who was weak and a little bit run down,
and nothing that we did for him seemed
to help him at all. A couple of years ago,
however, he took Joy's A egetable Sarsa
puriila, and when you" see him you will be
able to judge better from his appearance
than from anything I could tell you as to
what it has 'done for him. He weighed
about eighty-five or ninety-five pounds
when he commenced to take it." Then
Mr. Benedict beckoned his eon. Mr. Bert
Benedict.
"What the pater says is true," said the
young gentleman. The frank, blue eyes
and stalwart frame and the altogether
healthy looking face, betokened a constitu
tion which nine out of ten of us would be
mighty glad 'o have. To say tÂ»>at Mr. Bert
Benedict ha? a military air would be incor
rect. He walks with that easy grace which
characterizes a man who has been born
and knows that he has been born with good
blood in his veins, and he talks with the
confidence of a man who knows that he
has ability. "Yes," he said, "I have quite
a good deal to thank Joy's Vegetable Sar
saparilla for, I suppose. At any rate it
did me a whole lot of good. It produced
no boils, it produced no sores on my face,
and in a word it did me unmixed good."
And his father added, "We had this sat
isfaction, we knew from what we had been
told that there were no iodides nor mineral
poisons in the remedy, and our experience
has proved that our friends did not mis
lead us."
It is a little bit of pleasure to quote gen
tlemen of this type. They are few and far
between. They would no more indorse a
patent medicine or a remedy of any nature
for money than they would indorse or
support an ordinary bunko-man game.
They are clean, bright, honest, business
men. They have the confidence of the
community, and while I cannot assert it
as an actual fact, for I do not know, I
should be willing to gamble about fifty to
one that no man evei got anything from
"The Hastings" under misrepresentation,
and I will gamble one hundred to one that
every man who goes there gets as good
value for his nioney as he can get any
where.
THE INSURANCE SIDE OF IT.
After leaving Mr. Benedict I went to
lunch, and I confess to a rather satisfied
feeling alter the particular waiter whom I
chose to fee in the Palace grillroom had
finished bowing his thanks. I started
across Montgomery street a^ain, and just
as I reached the western sidewalk L met Mr.
Harry Baehr, the well-known city acent
of the Phoenix Insurance Company of
London and the Providence Insurance
Company of Washington. Mr. Baehr hap
pens to be one of the handsome men
about town, and his Maker provided him
with as sunny a disposition as one finds in
a month's walk. Mr. Baehr is a well
known Mason. He is secretary of King
Solomon's Lodge, F. and A.M., and he
also is a member of the California Chap
ter of the Royal Arch Masons. Shaking
him by the hand, I asked him how busi
ness was.
"Not very good," he said, "although it
is picking up, and I have no doubt that
insurance circles very soon will feel a
great deal brighter than they do at this
moment. What are you writing about
now?" he queried.
"Wen" I replied, "I have been detailed
to find o ' n t from the principal City mer
chants what they think of j o y's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla."
"Want to know wn *t I think? he
asked, briskly.
"Why, surely, I had no idea that you
knew anything about It."
"No? Well," he continued, "six months
ago my stomach was all out of order. I
had no appetite and I got up of a morning
with a bad taste in my mouth. H seemed
as though I had a bad case of the blues.
There wasn't anything for me to get Blue
about, but I always felt a little bit de
pressed. Somebody suggested to me that
I take Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. At
first I thought the proposition was
absurd, but eventually I tried it â and how
do I look to-day?"
It must be confessed that Mr. Baehr was
the picture of health.
"Why," he continued, "I took one hot
tie ana it did me so much good that
if the second one had cost me a thousand
dollars lam perfectly certain I should
have found the money one way or an
other to get it. I have taken three bottles
in all, and my wife takes it now, too. It
is an excellent remedy for any man who
is ran down, whose work is of a sedentary
nature, or for any one whose liver or
stomach is affected. Jnst say that I said
this, nlease. Whoever tbe people are who
put it up, I consider that they do a pub
lic service, and I am neither afraid nor
ashamed to say so." And with that this
healthy, happy insurance man went on
his way to hunt for big premiums which
he would probably get. The Phoenix In
surance Company is one of the largest fire
insurance companies in the world, and as
a City representative it could have no bet
ter man than Mr. Baehr. And why? Be
cause he is known as a dependable man.
This is not on my hearsay alone. Any
business man will indorse that.
THE LADIES TAKE A HAND.
There is a shocstore at 129 Montgomery
street that is noted for the excellence of
its styles. It, too, has the reputation of
producing shoes of home manufacture,
and while the prices one pays there are
not the highest in the world the shoes
that one gets are not surpassed for wear or
for fit. It is owned by Mr. JnmesGutberlet.
Mr. Gntberlet has been in the business in
San Fraticisco for the last twenty-five
years, and during that time he has done
all that he could to support California and
her industries. He is an enthusiastic be
liever in home industry. AsKed as to his
opinion of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla he
said. "I have none."
"Did you ever hear of it?" I asked.
"Did those young ladies who recom
mended it to me tell you they had done
so?" he queried.
I said. "Certainly not. I want your
opinion."
"Well," he replied, "I have been under
the weather for quite a little while and my
wife, who uses Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa
rilla, I believe, said, "You had better use
it,' but I declined. I aont want medicine
if can avoid it. The next day I was out
and happened to be thrown into the com
f>any of four young ladfes. We talked fora
ittle while, and one of them was solicitous
as to my welfare. I felt down and blue, and
you know when a man feels that way he
invariably shows it. One of them said,
'Why, Mr. Gutberlet, why don't you take
some Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla? lam
certain it would brace you up and make
you feel an altogether different man.'
'Are you sure?' I asked her. She said,
â¢Yes, I know.' She spoke so very strongly
in its favor that I almost made up my
mind to take it, and probably I would have
been better off if I did. Please say for
me that if I ever use a sarsaparilla I shall
certainly use Joy's, and Joy'? only. It is
not entirely because it is a Californian
remedy that I say this, but when my
wife and intimate friends of mine recom
mend it to me as an excellent thing it ap
pears to me that there is no choice left in
the matter."
And so it does not seem, to matter as to
what street one chooses, Joy's Vegetable
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1896.
Sarsaparilla is spoken of highly every
where. Some people are more impressed
with its merits than others, it is true, but
in no case do you find any one who is will
ing to say that they have found it do them
harm. That sarsaparilla is good is un
doubtedly true if it is what it pretends to
be, but a preparation of iodides put up
under the name of sarsaparilla seems to
me to be somewhat of a fraud. 1 don't
know of my own knowledge that there is
any such sarsaparilla, but I do know that
with most of the people I have inter
viewed that seems to be the prevailing
opinion, and one of the reasons why they
indorse Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla so
heartily, so uniformly, and so clearly and
so distinctly is that nine out of every ten
people seem to know that it is a pure
vegetable product, and from its use they
need fear no bad after effects.

OUT OF CIRCLE CITY.
The 600 Persons There Expect to Find
Much Gold This Tearâ Four
New Districts.
Casper Ellingen and Joseph Cooper of
Circle City, Alaska, who made the long
trip down the Yukon River on foot, arrived
here yesterday. Mr. Ellingen is a young
man formerly from Wisconsin. He has
been in Alaska for several years, but only
about a year ago went up to the far Yukon
diggings. He said at the Russ yesterday,
where he is staying:
"There is a big rush to Alaska now, but
they are not all going to the Yukon.
Many are settling along the coast, where
they expect to get gold. I don't know
where they will find it, but that is their
intention.
"This winter 560 men and eleven women
are in Circle City, and they were all well
and happy when I left. They all expect
an active summer, and are looking forward
to making a good deal of money. I have
been mining, but don't know whether I
will continue it or go into some kind of
business there.
"Four new creeks have been opened
contiguous to Circle City. They are from
fifty to sixty-five miles off and "head close
together. The four creeks are Harrison,
Eagle, Bonanza and Greenhorn. The two
former empty into Birch Creek and the
latter in Crooked Creek. All of the new
gulches promise well as far as prospected."
Mr. Ellingen will remain here for prob
ably two weeks.
SINGS HIS LAST SONG
Sankey's Farewell to Young Men
at the Y. M. C, A.
Hall.
The Story of "Ninety and Nine" and
the Last Rendering of the
Famous Song.
Mr. San key had sung his last song at
his last meeting of the long series in this
City at the hall of the Y. M. C. A. last
evening. He was saying that perhaps
this was the last time that he would ever
have the pleasure of meeting the young
men who were gathered before him. There
was a pause for an impressive instinct,
and then, picking up his little morocco
covered hymn book, he said: "I have been
asked to sing just one more â that old-time
favorite, 'Ninety and Nine.' "
The
audience
broke
into
applause.
Mr. Sankey then held the audience for
another ten minutes with a very pretty
story about the song; how he had sung ft
at a Quaker meeting, in the very heart of
Quakerdom in England, an organ having
been introduced into that unaccustomed
place for the first time for the especial pur
pose. After the song the Quakers had
asked him to "Keep on singing all even
ing." Then he told how an energetic
Quaker woman had become interested in
the work of Mr. Moody and himself and
followed them nround to their several
meeting places in London and, finally, be
ing compelled to go to SoutLern France
for her i ealth, had taken a great number
of the little song books with her, distrib
uting them in public places, and how this
same woman sat at a public meeting and
heard told the story of a young man who
hid been saved by* finding a copy of the
little book where she had placed it and
reading the beautiful "Ninety and Nine."
Then he went over to the organ and,
himself playing the accompaniment,
thrilled the audience with his familiar and
beautiful rendering of the song.
While his last notes still trembled
through the hall he rose and asked all to
"bow their heads for a moment,' 1 and
straightway began asking for a blessing
upon his hearers. A benediction was said
and the campaign of Sankey and Stebbins
that has been in progress for some weeks
came to a close. The evangelists go East
at once.
FORREST'S RING.
How James O'Neill Came to Wear This
Noted Finger Ornament.
James O'Neill, the actor, who is soon
to appear in this City, and James Connor
Roach are fast friends. Some time ago
they met in Clark's Cafe in Boston, to
gether with a number of other theatrical
people. After a while the talk naturally
led to Mr. O'Neill's forthcoming appear
ance in "Virginius." Reminiscences of
Forrest and McCullough were in order,
when Mr. Roach pulled a big seal ring off
his finger, handed it to Mr. O'Neill, say
ing: "There, Jim, is the ring Forrest al
ways wore; I want you to wear it next
Monday night when you play 'Virginius'
for the first time in Boston. May it bring
you the luck you deserve, and which fol
lowed Forrest when he wore it. I have
had it for many years, and for a long time
it has been my intention to give it to you.
Your reappearance in tragedy is a fit oc
casion for the gift. Ido not consider it
proper for me, a comedian, to wear a ring
that should grace the finger of a tra
gedian."
The ring consists of a solid; gold band
with a large stone of cornelia. The head
of Forrest is engraved in bas relief,
with "Edwin" and "Forrest" on either
side. The ring was first bought at an auc
tion sale of Forrest's effects in Philadel
phia about twenty years ago by Mr. Rver,
who sold it to a Mrs. Lynch. She after
ward parted with it for a considerable
sum to Louis Louthier, a famous collector
of antiquities. He in turn presented it to
Mr. Roach as a token of his esteem for the
author of "Rory of the Hill."
Mr. O'Neill feels pleased over being the
owner of Forrest's ring not only because
it was a gift from his friend Roach but
also because it recalls to him dear mem
ories of the Jupiter Tenans of the profes
sion, in whose company O'Neill served so
long and honorably when he wus the
youngest leading man in the country.
In this connection it may also be of in
terest to note that James O'Neill played
"Icilius" to Edwin Forrest's "Virginius"
for quite a long time. This may also ac
count for the fact that "old timers" de
clare O'Neill's "Virginius" to be nearer
that of Forrest's than any other actor who
has played the part since the demise of
that player.
Mr. O'Neill commences a two weeKs' en
gagement at tne Baldwin Theater next
Monday night. He will present during
the first week of his stay a repertoire made
upas follows: Monday "Monte Christo,"
Tuesday "Virginius," Wednesday "The
Courier of Lyons," Thursday -'Monte
Cristo," Friday "Hamlet," Saturday mati
nee "Virginius" and Saturday and Sunday
nights "Monte Cristo."

RAINEY'S POLITICAL TRIP
He Will Do Politics by Going
Away an<U Giving Himself
a Chance.
A NEW DEAL IN DELEGATES.
The Buckleyites Will Recognize
South-of-Market in a Revised
Apportionment.
Sam Rainey is going to a health resort
in San Bernardino County next week and
leave his oyster, the Junta, to his lieu
tenants, who will guard it until he gets
back to open it.
Rainey has mixed health and politics in
his journeys before. He is going away to
give himself a better chance. If he is
down in the San Bernardino mountains
his workers can do better in some
directions and the opposition to him will
not be so vigorous or so concentrated. The
selection of delegates to the State Conven
tion is probably sevaral weeks off, and he
will be back before time for the show
down. He has his fences in good condi
tion now, and the pulling and the holding
to be done in the general committee is well
mapped out.
Chairman W. P. Sullivan says that he
will announce the committees on griev
ances and on constitution and by-laws to
day. These committees will be apt to peg
along for some time before they produce
anything definite. The last-mentioned
committee will be closely watched by the
Raineyites because it is expected that
from this committee will come the expected
coup in the shape of an arrangement to
appoint delegates. It appears certain that
this will be attempted, as the hopelessness
of winning a delegate at a primary elec
tion is recognized by the "decent ele
ment," as the anti-Raioeyites loudly call
themselves.
The Buckleyites are taking a rest for a
few days, and Buckley is again at Ravens
wood. Since the meeting of the general
committee the other night the leaders
have figured out a new distribution
of State Convention delegates among
the eighteen Assembly districts. The
distribution of tbe 161 delegates appor
tioned to San Francisco by the State Cen
tral Committee, according to the resolution
adopted Monday evening, was eight to
each district, leaving seventeen at large.
At the meeting a minority, representing
strong Democratic districts south of Market
street, contended that thedelegates should
be apportioned among the districts ac
cording to the Budd voie. The plan now
is to apportion the delegates ojti the basis
of one delegate to every 200 isudd votes,
taking no notice of fractions. This will
give several districts nine votes, and will
leave ten delegates at large.
MARTIN KELLY'S MEETING.
A Weak Effort to Organize a Fac
tion In the Forty-
Fifth.
It was a picturesque crowd tnat com
posed the "Republican" meeting at Gari
baldi Hall on Broadway last evening. The
affair was the weak effort of Martin Kelly
and Jerry Mahoney to organize a dissent
ing faction in the Forty-fifth District, and
a more typical Martin Kelly political
meeting has not been seen for many a
daj.
Kelly and Mahoney have put forward
Joe King and J. B. O'Brien as district
manipulators of an opposition in that dis
trict to the regular party organization,
and last night's meeting was to organize a
club, with King as its boss. In order to
create a crowd several kegs of "steam"
were placed in the barroom at King's ex
pense, the magic proclamation, "Beer!"
was put forth, and Martin Kelly herded a
lot of his south-of-Market "push"' and
sent them across the City, under
the leadership of Jimmy Lennon.
Kelly's old junkshop partner. Jack Hoey
of Brannan street, Denny Coleman, the
bruiser, and others. There were toughs
from the Mission, and City Hall janitors
and Police Court habitues from all over
the City. The rest belonged mainly to
the neighborhood, and there was a slight
sprinkling of respectability. With these
efforts the hall was not filled.
T. B. O'Brien was made president of the
club, W. Engram secretary and Joe King
treasurer. O'Brien made a speech amid
the uproar from the barroom, during
which he lauded Martin Kelly and Joseph
King, talked of the A. P. A. and declared
that the Republicans of the district
needed a general. A resolution was read
and adopted appointing Joseph King the
"leader," "to whom should be. intrusted all
negotiations appertaining to the guidance
of Republican policy in the Forty-fifth
District." After a signing of the v roll the
proceedings consisted of ribald songs and
obscene stories.
MISSION REPUBLICANS.
The Thirty-Fifth Assembly District
Entertain Their Friends
Socially.
The Republicans of the Thirty-fifth As
sembly District held a very enjoyable
social gathering of their members and
friends at 1339 Valencia street last nieht.
The officers of the clubâPresident V. T.
Northup, Vice-President C. M. |Depew,
Secretary R. H. Stafford. Treasurer C. L.
Hedemark and the twenty-seven members
of the executive committee â resolved
themselves into useful members in seeing
that all visitors were properly provided
with light refreshments during the recess
in the musical and literary programme.
Short speeches were made by John T.
Dare, who dwelt on the tariff question,
citing the example of England, by which
Japan, seeing the opening made in this
country and thÂ« countenance given the
importation of manufactured goods by the
Democratic party, started to improve its
labor condition by shipping ready-made
articles into our market in competition
with our industries. He said that England
would forfeit her colonial territories rather
than lose the commercial trade of tne
United States.
C. W. Kyle, the eloquent speaker, gave
a glowing account of the history of the
Republican party during it 3 existence in
power in this country. He compared it
with the destructive policy of the Demo
cratic party for the Drief period in which
it has been intrusted with the roanage
ment of public affairs. The Cobden Club
of England, he said, formed the com
mercial policy of England for the last
fifty years, but after next November this
club would cease to form the commercial
or moneyed policy of these United States.
jApplause.]
Major John A. Whiteside and W. D.
Kingsoury followed with short but cut
ting remarks upon the mismanagement of
the Democratic party under Cleveland's
administration.
The Hawaii quartet rendered some
choice selections. These, with an excel
lent band, made the evenine's entertain
ment very enjoyable.
INSTALLATION BANQUET.
A Band of Happy Elks Assembled at
Delinonico's Last Night.
The annual installation banquet of Gold
en Gate Lodge of Elks last night as
sembled 175 members and guests. The
banquet tables, richly decorated, were
, spread in the large hall on the fifth floor
of Delmonico's. At the head of the feast
sat J. 0. Reis, past exalted ruler, to whom
was presented a beautiful set of silverware.
The address of presentation was made by

VAN NESS BOULEVARD.
John DlcGovern Thinks the Plan Will
Be Successfulâ Mr. Law's
Departure.
Herbert Law, president of the Van Ness
avenue Improvement Club, left for Chi
cago last evening. Prior to his departure
Mr. Law said: "We can do nothing in
the boulevard question until we learn what
the property-owners are' in favor of, and
this will probably not be until my return
about ten days hence. No definite action
in the matter will be taken until that time.
"Mr. Spreckels informs me that there
will, in all probability, be some op
position, as some of the property-owners
appear to think the street will not be given
proper attention and kept in decent con
dition after it is turned into a boulevard."
John McGovern. who has taken an ac
tive part in the proceedings, said:
"Mr. Law and I have been strenuous in
our endeavors to get the avenue turned
into a boulevard, and I think we will
finally be successful.
"I bought my property January 10, 1853,
when Fremont, Haskell and others lived
right over, there on Black Point. Einile
Grizar, a Frenchman, bought a lot of
property in this region in 1859 or 1860, and
wouJd not part with a foot of it for r.ny
consideration.
"In 1863 the Government took all his
property, but afterward relinquished that
part south of Bay street and East of
Van Ness avenue. When this occurred the
matter of streets â and, in fact, of any real
estate improvements whatever â was lost
sight of for some time, because along with
the confiscation of so much of Grizar's
property that of all men of ambition was
seized at the same time.
"About' six years ago we got a bill
through the Legislature to Day property
owners for the land required to extend
streets through the 100-varalots known as
the Lagoon Survey. Things once more be
gan to brighten.
"Two years ago Senator Fair purchased
the water lots and swamps and graded
much property free of charge. Interest
has been steadily reviving ever since.
'"The contract was let to pave the avenue
from Union street to Bay with bitumen
several months ago, and the contractors
are simply awaiting propitious weather.
The property-owners will bear the whole
expense of this.
"Some of those residing south of Union
street may not regard it as feasible to run
a 21-foot lawn through the center of the
avenue. The property-owners from Union
street to Bay have unanimously signed the
petition for the lawn in the center of the
street, but wish the Board of Supervisors
to guarantee that it will be kept in order
by the City. If it will guarantee thatsucQ
will be done the owners of these six blocks
will place the lawn in from Union street to
Bay, and those south of Union can follow
their own inclination in the matter."
WISE AND FOOTE CONFER
Hot Words Are Followed by
Compliments From Both
Sides.
The District Attorney Refused to Pre
sent Evidence Favorable to
Williams.
Collector Wise and United States Dis
trict Attorney Foote had some hot words
in the oftice of the latter yesterday after
noon over the manner in which the Wil
liams investigation is being conducted be
fore the United States Grand Jury.
Though they are brother Democrats and
friends of many years' standing there has
been a coolness between these two func
tionaries for the Government for some
time. It has all grown out of the indignities
which the District Attorney declares the
Collector of the Port has heaped upon his
branch of the service.
Collector Wise has warmly championed
the cause of Inspector Kichard Williams
through all of his troubles and will prob
ably stand by him to the end. It was
therefore quite natural for the Collector to
become irritated when Judge Foote re
fused to regard the virtues of the inspec
tor with any large degree of favor. The
former wanted the District Attorney to
present to the Grand Jury certain docu
ments in support of the splendid character
which the writers declared Williams in
harited from a long line of uncorrupted
ancestry and of which he himself is a
shining example. Foote remarked with
some warmth that the virtues of the ac
cused Customs Inspector could not be
found with the Roentgen cathode ray.
The Collector took exception to what the
District Attorney said of his favorite in
spector, and the office-boy cleared the deck
for action.
But tnere were no hostilities. The Col
lector, however, was unable to swerve the
District Attorney from his purpose to do
anything that would in any way lighten
the burden under which the unhappy
Williams is now struggling, So tfte con
ference, which lasted irom 4 o'clock until
after 6, with F^ote telling the Collector
that he was the foremost Democrat in the
State and should get the nomination on
the Democratic ticket for Governor two
years hence. Then they went over to
lime-juice corner and made astronomical
observations through the glassware.
It is'said that Collector Wise did not
attempt to play his tattoo â on which be
has a patentâ on the breast of Judge Foote,
sa in the case of the now famous interview
with Major Moore.
Collector Wise was before the United
States Grand Jury yesterday. He went
over the whole tight between himself and
Major Moore, Special Agent of the Treas
ury Department. He said that Moore's
hatred of Williams had gone beyond all
reason, and amounted to persecution.
I n his opinion Williams had violated no
regulation "of the department nor com
mitted any wrong. He had investigated
the charges made by Moore, but was un
able to hnd any evidence, except the
irresponsible evidence of Chinese high
binders, against the accused. For that
reason he believed in the innocence of
Williams and would continue to do so
until he had been proven guilty beyond
any reasonable doubt.
Charged With Manslaughter.
The case of Charles Gerken, charged with
manslaughter, came up before Judge Campbell
yesterday. He was held to answer in the sum
of $10,000. On March 15 Gerken met John
Buckley on Mason and Green streets and,
without the slightest provocation, pushed him
violently to the ground, causing a fracture of
the skull.
Writ of Habeas Corpus.
George T. Bohen, president of one of the local
cemetery associations, arrested a few days ago
for violating the ordinance restricting the sole
of cemetery lots, was convicted and fined $20,
with an alternative, in Judge Low's court
yesterday. He surrendered himself to a Deputy
Sheriff, and will to-day sue out a writ of habeas
corpus.
BROWN SENT A DISPATCH
He Informed KalamaZoo Friends
That He Had Been
Acquitted.
HIS NAME WAS SIGNED TO IT.
Meeting of Members of the Congrega
tion to Request Him to Tender
His Resignation.
There was a large meetine of anti-
Brown members of the First Congrega
tional Church in Dr. McDonald's office last
evening for the purpose of considering fur
ther measures to protest against Dr.
Charles Oliver Brown's continuance as
pastor of the church.
Reporters were excluded, Dr. McDonald
explaining as the reason that nothing of
public interest was about to take place, the
meeting being simply advisory. He re
ported that considerable progress had
been made in the matter of getting signa
tures to the request for Pastor Brown's
resignation, and that everything looked
favorable for the rolling up of the number
to 200 or more.
The KUarnazoo Daily Telegraph of
March 18 contains the following dispatch:
San Francisco, Cal., March 8, 189 G.
L. M. Gate* and Othersâ Dear Friends: lam
acquitted on every charge. C. O. Brown.
In another part of the same paper is a
verbatim report of the findings of the
ecclesiastical council.
Certain persons in Kalamazoo have
written to persons in this City giving the
purported details of Dr. Brown's record in
tbat city.
The testimony taken before the ecclesi
astical council, together with a synopsis
of that in the Police Court and in the
Superior Court at the Davidson trial, have
been furnished the District Attorney. This
matter will be condensed and properly
arranged, after which it will be presented
to the Grand Jury, which is ready to
undertake the investigation.
At the meeting in the rooms of Dr. Mc-
Donald last evening a communication was
received which stated that the Christian
Endeavor Society had left the First Con
gregational Church in a body. Until Dr.
Brown's withdrawal from the pulpit
of that church the society will hold
their regular meetings in Native
Sons' Hall, on Mason street, near Geary.
This may be considered a movement that
the faithful adherents of the pastor must
certainly deplore and view as an indica
tion that the breach between the two fac
tions of the First Congregational Church
is growing wider.
At the meeting last night it was re
ported tbat the pew-holders were getting
up a petition with the same object in view
as that of the church members. It was
agreed that the names of the signers would
not be made public, as many of them ob
jected to any publicity. A vote of thanks
was extended to the press for its fair and
clear statements of the great trial.
Another meeting will be held in the Co
lumbia building in the near future.
FLEISHMAN PLAYS.
A Concert by the Symphony Orchestra,
With Four Soloists.
One of the features of the Symphony
Orchestra concert in Golden Gate Hall,
yesterday afternoon, was the number of
soloists. S. Fleishman, a well-known
local pianist, played a concerto, Miss
Nellie Guisti sang, C. W. Loyde. played a
cornet solo and Gustav Rowan rendered a
vocal solo of his own composition,
Fleishman's playing was one of the
most attractive features of the conce r t.
He gave the Chopin-Nicade "Concert Al
legro," for orchestra and piano-forte, and
rendered his score with breadth and
artistic feeling, as well as with excellent
technique. The orchestra, on the whole,
did good work in this concerto, though
more familiarity with the score on the
part of the conductor would probably have
made the passages written in syncopated
time go more crisply and tersely. There
is always a danger, in such passages, of
the soloist appearing to pull one way and
the orchestra another. Mr. Fleishman
was most enthusiastically encored for his
work in the "'Concert Allegro," and the
audience would not be satished till he had
played an encore.
Gustav Rowan, a local musician, ap
peared both as composer and vocalist.

David Manlloyd was to have sung Rowan's
"0 Salutaris." but &c a telegram was re
ceived from him stating his inability to be
present the composer sang the "0 Salu
taris" himself. The number was written
with violin obligato, which N. Lands
berger played very well. The impression
made by Rowan as a composer was very
favorable, and would undoubtedly have
been more so if Manlloyd had sung, for
Mr. Rowan, although the possessor of a
tine voice, has not yet learned how to
use it.
Miss Nellie Guisti sang the grand scene
and. aria from Ambroise Thomas' "Ham
let." The scena is a display of tvocal fire
works which is usually supposed to tax
the ability of a Calve and was a very am
bitious piece of work for a debutante. It
served, however, to show that Miss Guisti
has a sweet, flexible voice, which she uses
easily and well, having too much tendency
to indulge in the tremolo.
C. W. Loyde played "The Lost Chord"
very well as a cornet solo, and the orches
tra performed three selections under the
direction of James Hamilton Howe, the
overture to "Tannhauser," which went
very well with the exception of some un
certainty in the bass during the opening
bars, and Waldteufel's "Summer Even
ing" waltz, which was charmingly played.
Crespi Sentenced.
Judge Wallace, after denying a motion for *
new trial made by Cesare Crespi, who was
convicted of libeling G. Almagia, sentenced him
to three months in the County Jail. His Honor
said if he levied a fine Crespi's frieDds would

LOTTERY NOTICES.
President Andrews of the Brown Uni
versity pivos, in the current number of
ScriDner's Magazine, a deserved credit to
the members of the Fifty-third Congress
who were instrumental in bringing about
the passage of the anti-lottery bill, which,
as he says, "was carried through Congress
in spite of perhaps the most powerful and
enterprising lobby influence ever organ
ized."
The credit given to the advocates of the
bill is well deserved, and yet it is apparent
to every observant person that the battle
against the evil has been but half won and
the lotteries are not yet suppressed. Evi
dence of their existence is to be found con
spicuously displayed in the advertising or
the news columns of every newspaper ex
cept the few which, like The Call, honor
law more than money and refuse to pro
mote nn illicit traffic, by advertising it for
the sake of gain. If, therefore, credit is.
due to those who struck the first blow at
the evil, still more credit will be due to
those who devise a measure that will crush
it altogether.
It is not creditable to American journal
ism that newspapers aspiring to have good
repute and influence in the community
should consider themselves justified in
taking advantage of a defect in the law to
advertise a trade which it is a criminal of
fense to carry on. To do this is to make
journalism the reÃort of professional
swindlers and the deceiver of the public.
It is to violate the spirit of law while pro
fessing to keep the letter and to afford a
iuenns by which a traffic that otherwise
could be confined to the slums and hidden
places of the City can find an entrance
into every household and be a temptation
to the inmates of every home.
Of course, our lottery advertising con
temporaries do not sin for nothing. The
men who were able to concentrate at
Washington "perhaps the most powerful
and enterprising lobby influence ever or
ganized" are equally able to diffuse
throughout the country a corrupting in
fluence hardly less powerful. Lottery no
tices command the highest prices for ad
vertising that are paid. There is big money
in them for tbose who publish them. The
Call knows very well the pecuniary sacri
fice it makes in refusing them. The very
greatness of this power, however, is all the
more reason why it should be opposed at
every opportunity, by every means and by
every cit-kjen, for the fact that it can af
ford to pay so high for notices is a proof
that the trade continues to flourish and
make enormous profits, despite the law
that condemns it as a crime.
In the absence of a law making the pub
lication of lottery notices an offense sub
jecting the publisher to a heavy penalty
the only recourse the law-abiding people
of a community have against the intro
duction of the corrupting evil into their
homes is to refuse to receive there any
paper that publishes such notices. Police
officials have repeatedly stated tuut if
they could stop the advertising it would
not be long bpfore they would be able to
rid the community of the evil altogether.
It remains, then, to be seen whether such
publications cannot be checked by the
exercise of the moral force of the com
munity. If the decent homes of the City
will reject the lottery papers The Call
will not long stand alone in its light for
the law. That rejection Bhould be made
without hesitation. The homes, the
churches and the press should unite with
the police and the courts to uphold the
law of the land and suppress the swindlers.
USING THE GOVEBNMENT.
All the .dispatches from Washington
agree that the House Committee on Har
bors and Rivers has pledged its members
to secrecy and agreed to embody in the
bill a large appropriation for the improve
ment of Santa Monies harbor. There is a
disagreement in the news concerning" the
appropriation for San Pedro harbor, one
telegram intimating that such an appro
priation is to be made, another asserting
positively that it is not. It is not at all
likely if an appropriation is to be recom
mended for Santa Monica that one will be
recommended fur San Pedro.
The question of an appropriation for
Santa Monica harbor would never have
been raised had not the Southern Pacific
'built a wharf there at a cost of $1,000,000
and demanded that the Government should
make it useful by building a breakwater.
The wharf runs out into the open road
stead, for, as a matter of fact, there is no
harbor at Santa Monica in the proper
sense. There is no bay or shelter of any
kind. During the winter months the
safety of the wharf is threatened Dy storms
and ships cannot tie up alongside with
out great risk. A breakwater would render
it comparatively safe.
San Pedro has a well-sheltered harbor
inclosed in a snug bay, but the inner har
bor is too shallow for all purposes and
would need extensive dredging in order to
be useful for general shipping. If prop
erly improved it would be open to all.
The improvement of Santa Monica would
place all shipping at the mercy of the
Southern Pacific Company's wharf and
would serve to increase the business and
revenues of the company. It would be of
far greater benefit to the company than to
any other interest. It may be assumed
that the Southern Pacific chose Santa
Monica instead of San Pedro in order to
get the Government to make an improve
ment which would give the xailroad com
pany a monopoly of shipping in the south
ern end of the State.
This presumption is borne out by the
fact that all the Government engineers
and commissions sent out to inspect the
two harbors always and invariably re
ported in favor of San Pedro and against
Santa Monica. None of the California
delegation recently appearing before the
House committee asked for an appropria
tioa for Santa Monica, but all asked that
San Pedro be improved. The report from
Washington that Santa Monica is to be
preferred has an ugly look and calls for
prompt investigation. The improvement
of San Pedro would benefit California;
that of Santa Monica would be in the In
terest of the Southern Pacific.
GUAED THE REGISTRATION.
Connty Clerk Jordan of Alameda County
has discovered the facility with which per
sons of foreign birth may get their names
placed on tue great register by swearing
that their fathers were naturalized citi
zens. This practice is permissible under
the law, but heretofore, by reason of the
indifferent safeguard provided against
fraud, a simple affidavit has been accepted
as sufficient to procure the registration. It
is obvious that unless a much stricter
practice is started the great register of
all the counties may be abused. It is the
duty of the leading committees of the par
ties to take the matter in hand and ascer
tain what may be done to put some check
on the possibility of fraud.
The cases in which wrong may be per
petrated in the absence of a very strict in
spection are those in which foreigners live
in communities and adhere closely to the
language of their native country. This
produces a narrow circle of interests and
erects a barrier against outside inspection.
Unaer these circumstances it would not
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1896.
be difficult for young men recently arrived
to be fostered by naturalized voters as their
sons. Thus the difficulties created by the
educational qualification made by the con
stitutional amendment adopted at the last
State election could be easily avoided and
adopted sons placed on the great register
without being tested concerning their
Knowledge of the constitution in the
English language? That this is an im
portant matter has been recently proved
in AJameda County, where large numbers
of foreigners have been refused natural
ization by reason of their inability to com
ply with the requirements of that amend
ment.
LABOR AND CAPITAL.
The resolution adopted by the Building
Trades Council on Thursday evening com
mending Glaus Spreckels for his action
in giving the contract for the 2200 tons of
steel to be used in the construction of the
new Call building to a local manufacturer
(the Pacific Rolling Mills) exhibits one of
the aspects of the relation between labor
and capital that is too often overlooked.
It shows that in one point, at any rate,
there is a harmony of interest between
the two, and that whatever tends to the
advancement of home industry finds ap
proval from the more Bagacious repre
sentatives of both.
Mr. Spreckels' devotion to the industries
of California has been demonstrated in too
many instances by the strong arguments
of accomplished facts to be doubted by any
one. It is nevertheless pleasing to see that
what he has done in the way of advancing
the local welfare has been recognized by
the workingmen of the City and State.
Labor councils are often required to criti
cize the actions of capital, and it
is therefore all the more fitting that
they should be equally prompt in
giving commendation where good work
is 'done. The resolutions adopted
in this case are a credit both to Mr.
Spreckels and to the Building Trades
Council. They manifest a sympathy be
tween the workers and the capitalist in
the common purpose of upbuilding Cali
fornia and all her industries, and we
count it a good omen that this display of
harmony between labor and capital has
been occasioned by a step In the work of
erecting that stately building which is to
be the permanent home of The Call,
whose aspiration it is to be the ever stead
fast champion of all Pacific Coast interests
and all Pacific Coast men.
WHERE COMPETITION HURTS.
Judge Morrow's decision that Zante cur
rants are dutiable from whatever foreign
source they come means a great deal of
money in the pockets of California raisin
growers. That the board of appraisers
could ever have placed any other construc
tion upon that clause of the tariff law was
a matter of surprise. The small raisins
commonly called Zante currants and bo
largely consumed in this country are pro
duced successfully in California, as well as
in Greece and its islands, and nowhere else
to so great perfection. In the absence of
the import duty of I}Â£ cents a pound it
would be impossible for this great indus
try to be profitably conducted in Califor
nia against the competition of Greece, lor
the reason that the expense of production
and transportation here is so much greater.
The curious part of the matter is that
this import duty was provided in the Wil
son bill and without any idea of affording
protection to an important American in
dustry. That measure merely provided
for raising a revenue on an article of large
consumption in the United States. It
happened that California had developed a
special adaptation for the production of
raisins of all grades and varieties, and that
the duty on Zante currants operated un
intentionally as a protection of an indus
try growing out of a natural advantage.
It is true that the transportation com
panies controlling the industrial interests
of California have the power to adjust their
charges so as to overcome any special pro
tection that an import tariff charge may
afford to any particular industry, but it is
none the less comforting to reflect that in
a broad sense protection is welcomed as
the beginning of prosperity.
This decision will have a very pro
nounced effect on that branch of our
raisin industry which had been coming in
competition with Zante currants. As
Fresno is the center of the raisin industry
and as it will have in the Valley road
competition in transportation this year,
the outlook ia exceedingly bright. Raisins
of all kinds will receive the benefit.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Distinctively racy of the soil is The Suit
pay Call, and that is why every CaJifor
nian who wants his Eastern friends to
know what California is and who wants to
give the State a lift always sends them a
copy of The Sunday Call. The paper is
not modeled on the lines controlling East
ern journalism. It is distinctively a Cali
fornia publication and is as welcome abroad
as at home.
The Salvation Army is attracting special
attention at present, and hence a group of
sketches, showing the experiences of local
workers in the cause, will be found accept
able. This article, which will appear in
to-morrow's issue, will have the additional
charm of presenting scenes peculiar to the
slums of San Francisco, as they are known
so intimately by the patient and persistent
workers in the Salvation Army cause.
The varied experiences of Orrin Hickok,
the famous trainer and driver of trotting
and pacing horses, will form a carefully
prepared study that will interest a large
number of readers.
An addition to the series of articles de
scribing the lighthouses of the coast will
be one devoted to the lights of Oakland
harbor, in which some very important
history bearing on current events will be
told.
Adeline Knapp, in an article entitled,
"Our City's Approaches," will present a
picture that could have been painted only
by a combination of artist and philosopher.
A clever sketch-writer will offer an inter
esting study of character in a dissertation
on the habits of the human wharfrats who
thrive at the Eastern base of Telegraph
Hill.
W. C. Morrow will relate a personal ex
perience indicating a source of enjoyment
in San Francisco, concerning which few
residents seem to have au adequate knowl
edge.
The general departments special to the
Sunday issue will receive the careful treat
ment which has made them so valuable in
the past. Although the regular summer
season in fashionable circles has not yet
opened, it will be interesting to read of the
contemplated movements of the select.
Equally interesting will be the department
discussing fashionable clothes for women
and men. As children are always coming
into the world and in time will become
the governors of human destiny, their im
portance is recognized in a special depart
ment devoted to their elevation, books
and magazines still are published, and
likery will continue to be published a few
years longer, and so a wide-margin de
partment is devoted to them. As the
tendency of the age is toward X-rays and
other startling achievements of science,
the department devoted to odd, interest
ing and instructive things that the cathode
eye can discover will receive very particu
lar attention in to-morrow'a Call. '
rtJEL OIL Iff THE SOUTH.
Within tne past week dispatches from
Los Angeles have reported a heavy short
age in the oil supply of that section and a
consequent increase in the price of that
commodity, with a prospect of a further
advance. These developments are purely
local in their effect. The oil referred to is
obtained from wells in the immediate vi
cinity of the metropolis of the southern
part of the State, and is suitable for fuel
purposes only.
The shortage is due rather to the in
creased consumption of the product than
to any lessening in the supply. Neither
the refined product, used for illuminating
purposes, nor the fuel oil obtained from
other sources, has been in the least affect
ed by the rise recorded on the Los Angeles
Oil Exchange. Aside from the direct pe
cuniary profits resulting from the present
situation, it will undoubtedly tend to
greatly stimulate this valuable and grow
ing industry.
NO CABINET BIKES.
The ladies of the Cabinet
Are weeping briny tears,
And sounds like those of martyrs' cries
Fall on the nation's ears. -
A shadow as of blasted hopes
Has fallen on their lives,
And they regret with might and main
That they are Cabinet wives:
Because, forsooth, the Prssident
Has stated that he feels
It's not the proper thing for them
To fly around on wheels.
And anything he says must be
The law in Washington;
A single word from him's the Ten
Commandments bunched in one.
He knows the streets of Washington
Have power to entice
The blkesters, till they think they're on
The streets of Paradise.
And yet, despite the cnarrn, he sayi
They must not ride. Alack !
Are women cowards, not to hit
The tyrant in the back?
They do not raise a hand to strike!
Their courage ia a clam !
Ye gods! and do our women think
"Sic semper" is a sham?
It must be so. We only hear
These ladies weep an I wail,
As every woman tamely bangs
Her bloomers on a nail.

RELICS OF AN EPHEMERAL STATE.
The short-lived republic of Formosa was
equipped with a good many of the appliances
of civilization, although it was established by
Chinamen and presided over by a Black Flag
chief. It was called into being: when the Chi
nese Taotai left the island iv order to surren
der it to the Japanese. On the departure of
the Taotai the literati of Tainanf v bent to Liv
Yung Fu, the Black Flag chief, who was then
at Takow, and asked him to come to the city
with all his available forces and defend it
against the invader. Liv came, and a Parlia
ment was at once elected. Seven Senators
were formed into a Cabinet, and the Presi
dency of the republic was offered to Liu. At
the end of a few weeks the republic passed
away. The Japanese planted their flae at
Tainanfu* and Liv fled no one knows whither.
Among the relies of this ephemeral state are
a considerable quantity of paper moneyâ
very depreciatedâ and â  two issues of postage
stamps, which are at a .-.
high premium. Th 3 post
age stamps are all of one
design, a fac-simile of
which is reproduced
from the Chinese news
paper Hupao. This is a
10-cent stamp of the face
value of 100 cash. On
the top are characters in
ancient Chinese for "Re
public of Formosa"; on
the right, in modern
Stamp of the Parmesan
Republic.
Chinese, "One hundred
cash," and on the left
"Stamp," or sitan, a pho
net i c rendering for
stamp â "paper." In thÂ» center, and oc
cupying about three-fourths of the surface
of the stamp, is the emblem of the
republic â a ticer. According to the Hupao
the first issue ot these stamps was all bought up
by foreigners from Hongkong, Arnoy ana Foo
chow, and the present one is a representation
of the second issue.
Philatelists will no doubt be interested in
further particulars of this very curious issue
of stamps. The first of the two issues were
impressed from a locally cut silver die, and
were printed on thin tissue paper unperfor
ated. About 5000 only of these were issued.
The colors were green, violet and red. The die
was then melted and attempts made to get a
more perfect one stamped. Failing this a new
die was obtained from Canton, and a new
issue of stamps impressed from the Canton die
made. These were also in three colors, blue,
violet and red, but are all perforated. The
face values of the different stamps were for
both issues three, five and ten cents respect
ively. It should be noted that the legitimate
manufacture of Formosan stamps ceased with
the existence of the republic, and it is neces
sary that very careful precautions be taken to
avoid forgeries, as already the demand for
first issues especially has called the forger
into tho field. Liv decreed that all Chinese
letters posted through the local offices should
be stamped, and the bags were duly vised to
insure this Having been done.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Yesterday an odd-looking old gentleman, his
head bound around with broad, white bands, 9
and from the side of whose face was a protuber
ance, indicating toothache, boils, carbuncle or
what not, as the imagination might suggest,
walked â  into the Palace. Leaning against the
counter, he intently studied the pages of the
register for a few moments, and then grasping
a pen he wrote: :',.'â 
â¢ &. N. Bbockway. :
: ILL H. A>" PERSON. ' ;
: Call at Bass House. â¢
; Having done this he leisurely contemplated
his writing, as though entirely satisfied with it,
and walked up and down by the desk. The
arched eyebrows, and other symptons of Bur- '

prise which were molded in the face of Clerk
Ruckex, indicated that this experience was oi
a novel character. He braced himself, how
ever, and asked, as though to break the ice and
get some sort of a reason for the queer act:
"Do you wish a room, sir?"
"No," was the reply. "I merely put my name
down there bo that my friend Anderson will
know where to find me in case he comes to
this hotel."
Mr. Rucker asked v.hy he had not left him a
Dote for his friend instead of making a bulle
tin board of the register. In an acerbic tone
he told the old gentleman that now he must
be put to the trouble of scratching that out.
â¢'Oh, I'll do it," said the old gentleman, and he
proffered his services, but Mr. Rucker was
inoiified and proceeded to scratch it all out
himself.
"This is the worst yet," he W9nt on. "I've
had most all kinds of experiences hitherto, but
ii's the first time I ever had a stranger walk in,
make a bulletin board of the register for his
friends and walk out again, all the time stay
ing at another hotel."
it turned out afterward that the odd visitor
with the white bandages was a tourist, from
Garner, lowa, who had got here ahead of his
lowa neighbor, Anderson, who was also from
the same town. Mr. Anderson discovered Mr.
Brockway later at the Russ, where he regis
tered himself, and all was serene again. The
two Dromios were as contented as the Athe
nian travelers, who asked of each other about
talcing their ease in their hotel.

third "Flight of Birds of Passage." The com
pletion of "Tales" on his sixty-sixth birthday
may have given rise to this poem. Longfellow

LAbY'S NIGHTGOWN.
The gown shown here is a shape that wears
extremely well, for the part that usually gives
way first (the yoke) is made double.
It may be worn with a small turn-over collar
or maybe trimmed with a large collar of the
goods, or embroidery.
For muslin gowns a collar of the same with a
ruffle of Hamburg embroidery sewed on with
an open work border makes a neftt and Inex
pensive trimming.
A band of insertion with an open, bead efige
let in between the ruffle- and collar makeÂ» a
dainty looking gown. The Insertion is b#st
joiiied at the corners by cutting off square and
overhanding the edges together carefully. If
the pattern Is in zigzag lines it is better to cut
it cornerwise and join the edges in the same
way.
For dainty gowns of batiste the collar may
be exquisitely trimmed with a frill of Valen
ciennes or "point de Paris" lace, by rolling the
edge of the collar between the thumb and fore
finger, and sewing the lace right on the edge,
the stitches holding the tiny roll and the lace.
It takes but a little patience to learn to do thiÂ»,
and then one can make at home, at little ex
pense, comparatively (excepting time), very
exquisite gowns, such as come from the French
convent*.
Heavy lawns with a tiny dot in pink or blue
are used for night dresses. Collars of plain
pink or blue lawn make a pretty trimming.

TRAIL OF FORGERY
AND PERJURY
The Grand Jury Gets New
Light on a Cele
brated Case.
AN IMPORTANT WITNESS
Mrs. Sarah R. Spencer, Formerly
Mrs. Owen, Tells Her
Story.
SHE WAS FALSELY ACCUSED.
Sequel to the Forging of Harriet P.
Christy's Name and the Trial
of C. yon Tiedeman.
The Grand Jury is on the trail of a gang
of perjurers and forgers and several in
dictments may follow. In March, 1894, an
attempt was made by forging the name of
Harriet P. Christy to record a fraudulent
mortgage on her property and raise
thereby $15,000, but the scheme was dis
covered and C. yon Tiedeman arrested and
tried for complicity in the transaction. It
was alleged that he endeavored to get Mr.
Mulcahy, a cigar-dealer near the City
Hall, to rile the fradulent instrument.
There was testimony on Yon Tiedeman's
trial before Judge Belcher of the Superior
Court that a lady representing herself to
be Harriet P. Christy signed the docu
ments in the presence of Lee D. Craig.
The picture of Mrs. Sarah R. Owen, living
at Twenty-fourth and Shot-well streets,
was produced at the trial, and four or rive
witnesses swore that it was the photograph
of a lady who signed the name of Harriet
P. Christy.
This testimony was vigorously con
tradicted, and proof was offered that Mrs.
' Owen was not in San Francisco on March
i 8, 1894. when the forgery was committed.
Judge Frederick Adams of Oakland
knew then positively that Mrs. Owen was
{ in Chicago, for he was in constant receipt
i of letters from her, but his knowledge did
not change the current in favor of the
accused Yon Tiedeman, who was acquitted.
That a woman associating with a gang
lof swindlers did personate Harriet P.
I Christy there is no doubt. That the
i woman -was not Mrs. Sarah K. Owen was
J fully established by evidence presented to
; the Grand Jury yesterday.
The chief witness yesterday was Mrs. Sa
rah R. Spencer,formerly Mrs. Owen. When
i she lett San Francisco in February, 1895,
she was Mrs. Owen, widow of Mr. Owen, a
former rancher residing near Red Bluff.
In March, 1895, at the Fifth-avenue Hotel,
New York, she married Mr. Spencer. Her
husband was one of the witnesses yester
day. Mrs. Spencer is a lady who has
property and money. She is an invalid,
and had to be carried to the jury-room in
an invalid's chair, but she told her story
in a manner which fully convinced every
one of the jury that her statements were
true.
She produced board bills and receipts
from the Palmer House, Chicago, showing
conclusively by the hotel stamp that she
was there on the very day that the name
of Harriet P. Christy was forged in San
Francisco. Tracing her line of travel, she
produced a record of extension of her
tick*ets at Hot Springs, Ark. She was sus
tained by the testimony of two ladies who
accompanied her across the bay on her de
parture from San Francisco prior to the
time the forgery was committed.
Judge Frederick Adams of Oakland pro
duced letters from Mrs. Spencer with Pal
mer House envelopes, addressed in her
own handwriting and bearing Chicago
postmark of mailing and Oakland post
mark of receipt. One letter was written
two days before the forgery and one two
days a*fter. These proofs of Mrs. Spencer's
presence in Chicago on the day in March,
1894, that the false witnesses swore that
she was at the office of Craig, the notary,
were submitted to the Grand Jury.
E. D. Piexotto, Assistant District Attor
ney, who conducted the prosecution of
Tiedeman in Judge Belcher's Court in
May, 1895, was a witness. Other witnesses
were L. A. Souc, real estate man; James
Nagle, Mrs. Bpencer's attorney ; Oscar
Tolle, clerk of Judge Belcher's court, and
J. J. McGinniss, stenographer of that
court. The notes of the stenographer
were produced to show the names of the
witnesses who swore that Mrs. Owen
signed the papers at the notary's office.
Mr. Abbott, the railroad ticket agent
who sold Mrs. Owen her ticket East, gave
testimony showing the date the ticket was
sold.
The strong chain of evidence presented
was linked together by Detective Tho mas
Dillon. In the hearing of witnesses, Alfred
P. Black, Assistant District Attorney, at
tended the session of the Grand Jury.
Detective Dillon has two women under
suspicion in this case. One of them is
Kittie Fletcher, who was accused of steal
ing property. She subsequently jumped
her bail and went away with her husband.
John Desmond, who was on her bond, got
fourteen years in the penitentiary for
swearing that he owned real estate on
Minna street, which, in fact, belonged to
the Treadwell estate.
It is not clear at present just how many
people were connected with this gang of
swindlers. The forgery of Harriet P.
Christy's name did not succeed, as a simi
lar game did in the celebrated Emma Dick
case. There is proof now before the Grand
Jury which may send some of the gang to
prison for perjury and compel others to
disclose the name of the ringleader.
The committee on water and gas corpo
rations of the Grand Jury, consisting of
Cornelius O'Connor, C. S. Laumeister and
A. F. Price, recently received a long letter
from Joseph B- Crockett, president of the
San Francisco Gas Company. It is set
forth in the communication that the gas
company's customers number 30,000, and
that the deposit fund does not exceed $35,
--000. The president explained that it was
formerly the custom to exact a deposit
from every customer, whether known or
unknown. Now a deposit is not required
from any customer who can give a guar
antee.
The Health Department committee of
the jury, P. F. Butler, Louis Feldmann
and E. Â£. Cheever, will visit the Alms
house next Tuesday.
DR. GHISELIN'S ESTATE.
Fred Sasscer, a Nephew, Here From
Maryland to Look After It.
Fred Sasscer of Upper Marlboro, Md., a
nephew and executor of the estate of Dr.
James T. Ghiselin of Portland, the retired
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1896.
army surgeon, who recently died at the
Occidental, arrived here yesterday on busi
ness in connection with the estate.
It is said Dr. Ghiselin's estate will reach
a valuation of several hundred thousand
dollars. The doctor was an old army sur
geon, end was stationed in the early days
at Fort Vancouver. He invested in Port
land real estate, and on his retirement set
tled there, gradually accumulating a for
tune. In later years he resided here.
ME. BUNNER OF PUCK.
His Fever Has Decreased, He Is a Lit
tle Stronger and Hopes to Start
for Home Wednesday.
H. C. Bunner, the editor of Puck, who
has Deen seriously ill at the Occidental for
about three weeks, â has improved materi
ally during the last day or two. It is be
lieved now by his physician, Dr. G. E.
Sussdorff, that he will be able to start for
his home in New York on Wednesday
next. Dr. Sussdorff said yesterday in re
gam to him :
"His fever has been reduced, he has
gained a little in strength and he is feeling
first rate. If no relapse occurs he will be
able to make the trip without mishap and
in comfort. The journey if made straight
through would require about five days,
but if Mr. Bunner gets tired he wiil stop
at Kansas City or St. Louis for a little
rest."
Editor and Mrs. Bunner and their
cousin, W. C. Bunner, of this City, who
will accompany them, will go East via
Ogden and Denver. Editor Bunner has
complete confidence in his ability to rally
from the tuoerculosis. He expects to direct
the destinies of the comic weekly Puck for
many years yet and does not regard the
fears of his friends as being well founded.
Mr. Schwarzman who, with Mr. Kepp
ler, is proprietor of the journal, has sent
many telegrams of inquiry and proffers of
assistance if it was in his power to render
any since Mr. Bunnei's illness.

DRUGS FOR THE LEPERS
The Goto Remedy Will Be Pro
cured From Yokohama Im
mediately,
Supervisor Benjamin Will Advance
the Sum Needed to Compete
the Fund.
The following is the complete list of con
tributions to the leper remedy fund:
Mayor Sutro, |20; Supervisor E. C. Benja
min, $20; M. H. Heyneman, 33 Battery
street, $20; subscribed through The Call,
$54 50; Mrs. L. Wilkins, Ran Rafael, $10;
H. J. Crocker, stationer, 215 Bush street,
$5; W. W. Montague & Co., stove firm, 309
Market street, $5; George A. Newhail,
autio neer, 309 Sansome street, $5; F. E.
Benjamin, $2 50; C. G. Church, with A. C.
Deitz & Co., $10; Mrs. Garthwaite, Oak
land, $1; O. B. Smith, 301 Front street, $1:
T. H. Bowling, $1; Jim Salts, $1; X. D.
Barnstead, $1; C. W. Benjamin, $2 50. To
tal. $159 50.
Supervisor C. E. Benjamin, who has
taken an active interest in the charitable
plan of supplying the lepers at the Pest
house with the Goto remedy will not wait
to collect the rest of the money needed.
He will advance that sum, about $50, and
send immediately to Yokohama for the
Japanese medicine.
"I am more than anxious to see that cel
ebrated remedy tried here." said Mr.Benja
min yesterday, "and I want those unfortu
nate beings at the Twenty-sixth-street Hos
pital to get the benefit of the treatment as
soon as possible. I have no doubt that the
Treasury Department will let the package
of drugs come in free of duty that we may
get as much for our money as possible. Of
course we cannot expect to have a foreign
drug admitted. free all the time, but as
this is only a trial I hope to eet the
duty omitted. If the medicine is a suc
cess ararngements will be made in the fu
ture to have the drug here for constant
use."
As Mr. Benjamin has advanced the
necessary sum to complete the price of the
medicine it is to be hoped that the chari
tably disposed will continue to make their
donations, great and small, to the fund.
A more worthy object never recommended
itself to the generous-minded, as the
lepers at the Pestliouse are totally with
out medicine. Nothing whatever "within
the means of the .Board of Health or any
physician in this country can help them,
nence the necessity of sending abroad for
the medicine. The Call will continue to
receive and acknowledge all contributions
made through its office.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Unlucky U. S. Government
Tug Unadilla in Trouble
Again.
SHE DAMAGED THE BALTIMORE
Captain Nordling of the Christina
Steffens Tells His Story of
the Collision.
The new United States tug Unadilla
seems to be running in' hard luck. Cap
tain Redstone seems to have a penchant
for running into wharves and steamboats,
and in consequence a number of damage
bills have bad to be paid. In docking
yesterday morning the Unadilla struck
Jackson-street wharf a blow that almost
threw her passengers off their feet, and on
her initial trip she ran nearly five feet
into Washington-street wharf. On her
second attempt she ran between the dol
phin and the wharf, but no damage, out
side of the loss of some paint, resulted.
On the occasion of her next visit the
Unadilla very nearly cut the quarantine
tug Governor Perkins in two. The latter
was lying at Clay-street wharf, and, the
Government vessel having too much head
way on, made direct for the Perkins, and
had it not been for the presence of mind
of W. Gatley a disaster would have re
sulted. He saw the Unadilla coming, and,
casting off the mooring lines, pot the
quarantine boat away from the wharf.
The Unadilla pushed her away when she
came along, and no damage was done.
Next she nearly ran down a schooner
loaded with powder, and had that collision
occurred there would have been no United
States Government tug and one schooner
less.
The latest escapade of the erratic boat
happened last Thursday afternoon. The
Baltimore was being moved from the Mare
Island dock in order to make room for the
Bennington. Captain Redstone got too
much headway on his vessel and in conse
quence ran the Baltimore into the sea
wall and carried away quite a number of
piles. The cruiser received a severe shak
ing up, and she will be put back in the dry -
dock as soon as the Bennington comes out
to see what damage has been done to her.
As soon as the Bennington is overhauled
she will be sent to the Asiatic station.
As she lav at the foot of Jackson street
{'esterday the Unadilla presented nothing
tut a peaceful and handsome appearance.
As far as construction and material goes
she is one of the finest vessels of her class
in the bay. Nevertheless she seems to be
unfortunate, and there must be a hoodoo
somewhere.
The yawl yacht Arcturus, the first pleas
ure craft launched from Stone's shipyard
this year, had her trial trip on ttie bay
yesterday. She is very fast but will not
be seen much on the bay, as her owner is '
going to take her to Colusa. She is listed |
among the Corinthian yach ts and will race i
in the annual regattas, but the greater
part of the year she will be on the Sacra
mento. When the artist was sketching
the Unadilla he caught the Arcturus just
as she was passing Jackson-street whaif.
The schooner Christina Steffens, which
was in collision with the schooner Helen
Merriam, arrived from Timber Cove yes
terday. Her port rail, martingale and
figurehead were carried away ana her jib
torn. Captain Nordling asserts that his
vessel baa her lights burning, and in sup
port of his contention produces the follow
ing affidavits of the two sailors of the
Merriam, who came down with him:
I, Julius Paul, am a sailor on board the
schooner Helen Merriam. Ou Sunday morn
ing, thirty miles northwest of Point Reyes, I
was at tne wheel, sailing about eight knots aii
hour. Was alone on deck. The weather was
hazy. Just came on deck from takiDg coffee.
Sailed across the Christina Steffens' bow. Had
no time to do anything. The Christina Stef
fens was hauled to, sailing against the wind.
After we collided I put the wheel hard to port
and tried to shove her clear. We finally got
the vessel clear in about a half hour. We
packed our clothes and weiit on board the I
Christina Steffens.
The lights were burning on the Christina
Steffens when we struck. Just came on deck
and could not see anything when we struck.
When we went on deck of the Christina Steffens
the lights were burning. Captain Krugcl did
not ask the captain of the Christina Steffens to
stay by his vessel, but the Christina Steffens
stayed by until we packed our clothes and went
on board. Julius Paul.
March 26, 1896.
A. Norem, A. Nordling, Witnesses.
I, Donald Clow, was mate on board of the
6Choonor Helen Merriam. On Sunday morn
ing, March 22, 1896, was three sheets before
the wind. Was sailing about six and a half
knots per hour. Was in my bunk when tho
vessel struck the Christina Steffens. Went on
deck when I heard the crash and started to
lower sails. The bowsprit of the schooner
Christina Steffens was between our mainmast
and rigging. Went and put the wheel hard
down. Tried to lot the jib down, but every
thing went overboard. Then tried to shove
her off. Then packed my clothes and went on
board the schooner Christina Steffens. When
1 came on deck of the Helen Merriam 1 saw the
port lights of the schooner Christina Stefl'cns
burning. That is the only light I could see
after we collided. The starboard light was
then taken from its place and moved aft to
give light to the Helen Merriam.
Donald Clow.
Witnesses: A. Norem, A. Nordling.
The testimony in the case is very con
flicting, and it will take a court of inquiry
to place the blame.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamer J. D. Peters will
resume tier running between here and
Stockton to-morrow. She has been thor
oughly overhauled and is now in first-class
condition for the summer trade. The City
of Stockton, which has been filling the
place of the Peters, will probably go to
Sausalito, where she will be used, as afloat
ing home for the directors of the company
during the summer.
The little Sacramento River steaffier
Fruitvale is being put in order for the
summer season. She went on the Mer
chants' drydock yesterday and in a few
days will be ready to resume her runs be
tween Rio Vista and Sacramento. In the
meantime the Belvedere has taKen up the
running and Captain Parker is reaping a
golden harvest.
The yacht Lucero with Charley Fair
aboard had a race witn the ferry steamer
Tiburon yesterday afternoon. The yacht
held her own for a short distance, but then
the Tiburon put on a spurt and simply
ran away from her. Mr. Fair will take his
first cruise outside ihe latter part of this
week.
Another American ship has arrived with
a tale of cruel treatment on the high seas.
Thomas Olsen, a sailor on the Aryan, has
sworn out a warrant for the arrest of First
Mate St. Clair. He ?ays the latter beat
and maltreated him and that ihe crew was
only half fed. Captain W. R. Dickinson
says the charges are unfounded, and the
chances are that Olsen will not be able to
Erove his case. When it comes to trial
is witnesses will have either changed
their minds or disappeared.
Problems in Mathematics.
At the Mark Hopkins institute this morning,
at 10 o'clock, Professor M. W. Haskell of the
University of California will deliver the first
of six free university extension lectures on
' 'Historical Problems of Mathematics." While
the lectures are intended primarily for teach
ers of mathematics, all interested in the sub
ject are invited to be present.
Fair Case Continued.
Owing to the death of Judge Slack's father
the Fair will case was yesterday continued for
a week. The Judge is much affected by the
sad bereavement, as he was devotedly attached
to his venerable pareut.
USED TOO MANY TURKEYS
Supervisors Criticize City and
County Hospital Ac
counts.
Unless Checked the Poultry Account
Threatens to Swell to Enor
mous Proportions.
Either the patients of the City and
County Hospital are being better fed than
usual or the internes, nurses and officials
generally are living at a much better table,
and which of these is correct is just what
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors is trying to ascertain at the
present time. No matter which way the
question is decided the committee intends
to curtail the poultry bill of the institu
tion.
Under previous administrations the
commissary department of the hospital
was permitted to run a bill of $25 per month
for fowls, that amount being deemed suffi
cient to purchase all that was necessary
for thepatients who required strengthen
ing broths and to furnish an occasional
change for the officials' table.
Recently, however, the poultry account
has Deen growing larger and larger until
it threatens to reach four times its former
size.
The fact that the hospital expenses were
increasing came under the notice of the
committee and the expert of the board was
sent to look over the accounts of the insti
tion and ascertain the reason.
His practiced eve struck one bill, that of
a fowl merchant, that looked very large,
and he called the attention of Chairman
Taylor to it.
From the showing of the account
chickens, turkeys and other fowls must
be plentiful in the larders of the hospital,
and the idea struck the committee that it
would take many patients in need of
broth and dainty wings of fowl to use up
so much meat.
"I think we had better send the superin
tendent of the hospital a quiet intimation
that turkeys and chickens in such profu
sion are a ittle out of season when funds
for absolute necessities are in demand in
many institutions," said Chairman Tay
lor. "I don't see where so many chickens
and turkeys go to, and we will have to re
quire the superintendent to keep within
the appropriation."
CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS.
A Grand Exposition 'May Be Held in
Mechanic*' Pavilion in the
Near Future.
There still seems to be some likelihood
that a grand exposition of California prod
ucts will be held in the near future. It
will be recollected that some time ago the
project was broached, but little besides
talk came of it. The consideration of ex
pense alone seemed rather disheartening.
The Mechanics' Institute refused to let the
Pavilion for the exposition, and a building
at adequate size would cost a sum the
mere mention of which flung a wet blanket
over the whole scheme.
Now, however, thou h no definite action
has been taken, it looks as though matters
might take a different turn. A conference
is to be held between the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association and the direc
tors of the Mechanics' Institute, during
which it is hoped that arrangements may
De^effected for the engagement of the Pa
vilion. In this event the association
promises to open a display which in com
pleteness and interest will be a revelation
in its way.

Benjamin C. Austin Jr. Charged
With Committing a Grave
Offense.
HE IS SHOWN UP IN A LETTER
The Chorister and Violinist Accused
of Trifling With Two Con
fiding Women.
One wife is said to be fully enough, and
sometimes too much, for a man to handle,
but when there are two of them the hus
band may as well resign himself to all the
horrors which so grave a violation of the
law involves.
Benjamin C. Austin Jr., who is well
known in town in the triple role of choris
ter, violinist and insurance clerk, is a very
dashing young gentleman, at present re
siding with his father, General Austin, at
1104 Pacific avenue, Oakland. In 1889 he
led to the altar Miss Fannie Oneida Druf
fel, and went with her to live in the Druf
fel residence on Hyde street. Austin was
then earning about $125 a month as clerk
in an insurance office, but soon after
started in business by himself, doing better
by the change. But uccording to his wife's
complaint, tiled in an action for divorce,
which she commenced on February 8 of
this year, he began by degrees to drink to
excess. Then, in 1893, he met a Mrs. Wil
cox, keeper of the Auzerais, or, as it was
afterward called,- the Annandale, a lodging
house on California street. The meeting
resulted in a protracted tcur wherein Mrs.
Austin did not figure, her spouse and Mrs.
Wilcox being the only voyageurs.
Something akin to repentence would
seem to have pricked young Austin's ten
der conscience some "time in 1895. He
made overtures to his wife and she was
seriously thinking of forgiving her truant
husband and resuming love's young dream
so rudely interrupted. A letter prevented
her softening a.t this stage. The letter was
as follows :
â Pceblo, November 28, 1895.
Mrs. Austinâ Dear Madam: I received a
letter from a friend of mine from San Fran
cisco a few days ago in answer to a letter I bad
written her some time in July, asking her to
go and see Ben's mother and find out where he
was. You, of course, know all, so it is no use
oi me going into detail any further. I was
never so surprised as when slie wrote she had
seen Ben's wife and that he had never been
divorced. It is hÃrd to believe. When I first
became acquainted with him he told me he
had been married, but that he had to marry,
and that he took to drinking and travel to
compel you to get a divorce, and that you got
it on the srround of intemperance, and even
told me the court it was granted in and before
what Judge, and that I could so and nnd out.
It does not seem possible that he could tell
me such a lalsehood. I should have thought
if he was a married man he would have been
afraid to play his game in Hold, for we were
together 60 much, and in fact he spent most
all of his time* at my house. I wont to San
Francisco before we left Sacramento on our
trip. I called at his iatner's house about 5
p. M. to inquire for him.
He came to my friend's house about 7 p. M.
He wanted to know what kind of a looking
lady I saw. Oh, that was his sister Fannie, he
said. Well, there is no use of me writing you
any more on the subject. All I ask of you is
to please answer and let me know If you are
really B. C. Austin Jr.'s wife. B. C. Austin
and I were married in Carson City, Nevada,
the 21st day of June last, 8 o'clock in the
evening, by Judge Hawthorne. I have my
marriage certificate, also a letter from the
County Recorder saying it wnson record there.
Ben also registered at the Nevada State Prison
on the visitors' book as B. C. Austin and wife,
on the 22d June. He must have felt rather
shaky if he was already a married man when
he married me, knowing that he had laid him
self liable to be put behind the bars. I am
only waiting to hear from you before I do any
thing. I sent a letter to Ben, to 1235 Hyde.
Has he received it? Very respectfully,
Blanch Austin Je.
Pueblo, Colorado, 113 Second street.
P. B.â ls your name Oueida? I received a
letter from Van Tarsel, a friend of Ben, in
San Francisco, that Oneida usea to be an old
flame of Ben's that he lived with, but that
she was living with a sporting man now in
San Francisco. Strange that Van Tarsel never
told me that Be*n was a married man.
He was to my home with Ben often. I under
stand Ben denied marrying me. I can easily
prove our marriage. And that I was an ad
venturess and blackmailer, he would never
say that to my face. Of course, he had to say
something to you. And lam very little older
than he. I can always return wherever 1 have
lived and not have a bill presented. I do not
owe one cent in San Franciscoâ that is more
than Ben can say, and I def> tnat person liv
ing who can say I am either an adventuress or
blackmailer and prove it.
After receiving this letter Mrs. Austin
No. 1 sued for a divorce, which was grant
ed, the letter above copied being intro
duced in evidence. The cause alleged in
the complaint was failure to provide, the
petitioner stating that her husband's busi
ness went to pieces through his dissipated
habits and that when he left her his only
income was $5 a Sunday which he received
for singing in the choir of "St. Patrick's
Church. Thus far the allegation of big
amy contained in the Wilcox-Austin letter
has not been given any judical attention.
Mme. de Brinvilliers had large blue eyes,
the upper lid of which almost concealed
the pupils.

IS THIS A STRANGLER ?
The Boy Arrested for Assault
Upon a Woman of the
Tenderloin.
TERROR IN THE DISTRICT.
Laura Petit Tells of Her Experience
With a Man With Twitching
Fingers.
There is this to be said of the stranglerâ
that he has paralyzed with fear the entire
tenderloin.
There is a question in the mind of the
Police Department whether the more re
cent alarms are really the interrupted at
tempts of the man with the deadly grip;
whether they are the amateur efforts of an
understudy, or the results of the alarmed
imagination of the women themselves.
Compelled by the necessities of their traffic
to encourage the advances of every stran
ger they are constantly on the alert for
every move that might indicate personal
danger.
Three alarms have been sounded within
the past few days of attempted violence
upon as many different women by a man
following the methods of the strangler.
A man is in jail as a result of the latest
Robert Boyd, Arrested as a Snpposed
Strangler.
charge. He does not answer the descrip
tion of the man in any of the cases where
the woman has lived to give it.
It is only proper to say that the man in
the lockup does not look like a strangler;
that is, does not meet the accepted notions
of what a strangler should look like.
He is a young man, employed in the
California Wire orks on Bay street; has
been working there at night for some time.
He wears the clothes of aworkingman;
his hands are seared with nis labor. He
is in great distress because of his arrest,
and spends his hours in weeping.
His name is Robert M. Boyd. He is 24
year? of age. He is an Englishman from
Liverpool, entirely friendless, he says, and
is charged with assaulting a young woman
named Rose Martin on Pine street, near
her home, last night. The girl says he
attempted to strangle her.
While he does not look the conventional
Btrangler, neither does he tell an abso
lutely straight story; but he is eztremelv
nervous and distressed and can scarcely
talk at all for the tears that are constantly
ready to flow.
Rose Martin was taken before Captain
Lees yesterday morning and made this
statement of her encounter with Boyd:
"I was going up Kearny street toward
Pine at 2 o'clock this morning, when I
noticed a man following me. I >\ent up
Pine street and got to Pine and Dupont, j
and stood on the corner a minute or so, j
until the rain ceased, and 1 noticed the
man go up ahead of me. He made some
remark to me â 1 do not recall what it
â was â when I stopped in front of my
house, 603 Pine street. He then saidj |
Lanra Pettit, Who Had an Experience With a Man With Twitching Fingers.
'Come on up to Stockton street; nobody i
is going to hurt you.' I told him I was
not afraid of anybody and started to go
into the hallway of my house.
"The hallway is about ten feet long
from the first step. I stood in the door
way about three minutes talking to the
man.
'â 'â â 'â "I then turned my bach, and just as I
did so he ran and tried to grab me. He
would have grabbed me by the throat if I
had not shoved him away. I said. "Leave
bo of me.' He would not do it. "So when
t saw I could not get away from him I be
gan to holler for assistance, and a young
man named Jim Neil, a friend of mine,
ramp downstairs and asked me what was
the matter. Before Jim came down the
man turned his back and tried to run out,
and I grabbed him by the coat. He
Dragged .me out to the sidewalk and then
out to the street, and he then gayÂ« my arm
a wrench and 1 had to let go. I , told Jim
that a fellow bad tried to choke me. He
siid, 'Where did he go'!' and I said, .'Don't
you see him running?' And Jim then
ran after him. The man who * stood
across the street â I do not' know
who he is or what his name is â
said. 'There's his hat.' I took the hat
and brought it up to my room and then
took it down to the -California-street sta
tion. I ; told a man who was standing on
the corner of California and Quiucv streets
that I had his hat, anyhow. Hs was
standing there talking to some girls about
me. The hat was found about in the
. middle of the block,, where the man lost
it -while 'running away. I met some ofii
rei â¢â I 'do not . know who he wasâ and he
I told me to go down to the California-street
Station; that they had arrested some man,
â  - â  â  . . . â  â  : : â - â -' â â  Â«/â â  -;-- j
and they wanted me to go down and see
if I could identify him.
"I went down "and saw the man (Robert
Boyd), and identified him as the man who
had the trouble with me. He sat down on
a bench and started to cry and said that
he was hungry and had no room to sleep
in. I asked him what he tried to injure
me for, and he said he -was out of work
and that he had no room and nothing to
eat. He did not ask me for any money.
Boyd, in an interview yesterday after
noon, said he met the girl on California
stieet, near her home. He insisted that it
was California street. "We talked to
gether and went into the hallway. I put
mv arms around her neck, but 1 meant no
harm. Then she pushed me from her and
commenced to scream. I saw a fellow
coming down and I started to run. I
dropped ray hat and when 1 was trying to
recover it a policeman arrested me. That
is ail there is to it. I meant no harm and
I want to get out of here and go back to
work."
Questioned about his place of residence,
he said he had no home; he had been Jiv
ing with an Italian family on Stockton
street, between Lombard and Greenwich,
but had not been there for three days.
Asked where he had been living those
three days, he said, "Nowhere, just
around; I have no home."
In answer to further questioning he said
that he was born in Liverpool and his
parents still lived there; that he had come
to this country and this City a year and a
half ago and had no friends here and no
money. He was anxious that the Italian
family with whom he had lived, named â
as near as he could give itâ Fopiana,
should not be disturbed about the matter.
The books at the wire works show that
Â±soyd has been working on the night shift
there for six months. Yesterday he was
discharged.
.Rosa Martin would not respond to a call
at her place of residence at 603 Pine street,
a cheap tenderloin rooming-house. A tall,
thin cadaverous man in slip-shod dress,
looked in the rooni and said she had noth
ing to add to her statement made to the
police.
"I wish you would say there is no lover
in this case," he said. "Be sure of that.
There is no lover here."
He repeated the girl's story, telling how
Boyd had thrown her down, and then
when he attempted to run she bad caught
his coattail and he had lost his hat on the
sidewalk. He was arrested several blocks
away, on Commercial street, and the girl
herself took the hat to the California-street
station, so that his arrest could hardly
have been due to his efforts to recover it.
Laura Pettit, Jiving at 212 Ellis street,
was alarmed on Thursday night by the
conduct of a man who called upon her.
He said he had been given her address by
a friend of hers, and was admitted, whea
he immediately began to demonstrate
what appeared to be a passion for stran
gling. He placed his hands on her neck,
his ringers twitching nervously all the
while. The woman protested against his
conduct and he left. She thinks that the
light shilling through the crevice of the
shding-doors from the adjoining room
saved her from an encounter with a real
strangler. She was very much frightened.
This woman lived in the adjoining
house to Mamie McDermott when she was
murdered on Morion street. She moved
from the neighborhood immediately after
the trageay.
She described the man with whom she
had an encounter Thursday night as
small, well dressed, with a slight mus
tache and large blue eyes, which were
slightly bloodshot.
Sbe too was anxious that no "lovers" be
mentioned" in connection with the affair.
Indeed she objected very strenuously to
any publicity in the matter.
Boyd will be tried on the simple charge
of assault.
JUMPED INTO THE BAY
Body of Edward A. Hatherton
Recovered From the
Deep.
He Disappeared From Home a Month
Ago With a Threat to Commit
Suicide.
The body of Edward A. Hatherton was
recovered from the bay at the foot of Lom
bard street yesterday morning. Hather
ton disappeared a month ago and it was
thought at the time that he had destroyed
himself. He had threatened to commit
suicide and the rinding of the body,
weighted down with stones, as it was,
showed that he had carried out l.is inten
tions.
Hatherton, who was a native of England
and GO .years of age, being a member of
the firm of Hatherton & Ross, architects,
916 Market street, Â»San Francisco, lived
with his wife at 1308 Leavenworth street.
He was at one time a draughtsman in
the employ of this City. In 18yo he vent
to Tacoma, and, establishing himself in
busiuess there, soon accumulated a good
deal of property. Fortune, however,
turned against him, and in 1893 he lost all
his wealth. Coming to this City, he again
engaged in his profession, forming a part
nership with T. P. Ross. The business of
the firm was not prosperous, and Hather
ton became despondent. He often threat
ened to commit suicide. On February 29
he wrote a letter to his partner notifying
him of his intention to end his life. On
the evening of that day he disappeared.
Two or three days later two of his cards
were found at the end of Powell street
wharf.
Mrs. Hatherton took charge of the re
mains of her husband yesterday. They
were removed from the Morgue to her
home, whence the funeral will take place
to-morrow. Coroner Hawkins will hold
an inquest next week.
Wants a New Name.
The Lick Old Ladies' Home has petitioned
the Superior Court for leave to change its
name to "The University Mound Old Ladies'
Home."

district during the coming week:
You are cordially invited to attend a masF
meeting of the citizens of the Eleventh Ward
to be held in Mission Turn Verm Hall, Eigh
teenth street, above Valencia, on Saturday
evening, April 4, 1896, at 8 o'clock, for the
purpose of securing ft High School and Park at
the Mission and for the further improvement
of that portion of San Francisco. If unable; to
attend the meeting please communicate tout
views upon the subjects indicated. Address
communications to the chairman of the com
mittee, at 26 Montgomery street. Very-respect
fully, F. W. Van Reynegom, Chairman,
George Walcom, Secretary,
A. B. Magcire,
Daniel Kelly,
John A. Le.vnan.
Committee of Arrangements.
In addition to this general invitation
Mayor Sutro, the Board of Supervisors
and the Board of School Directors will be
specially invited, together with suchÂ»other
public officials as have resident or prop
erty interests in that section of the City.
Judge Van Reynegom, the chairman of
the committee on arrangements, is busily
engaged in laying out a fine of action. In
speakiug on the question of the needs of
the Eleventh Ward, the Judge said:
"The Eleventh Ward, including all that"
portion of the City and County west of
Seventh and south of Thirteenth streets
ana Golden Gate Park, comprises nearly
two-thirds of the area of all San Francis.o.
It is largely a district of homes, and con
tains about 25 per cent of the voters of San
Francisco. It is sadly fettered and most
inadequately represented in the City gov
ernment by the provisions of the consoli
dation act, which only gives to it one
representative in the Board of Supervisors.
"The result is that the Eleventh Ward
practically gets nothing in the annual ap
propriations for public improvements. Its
position toward the rest of the City is
analagous to that of a conquered province
which has to pay heavy tribute for the
dubious privilege af being snubbed when
it asks for anything in return. A small
percentage of the taxes paid by the section
that would be benefited by making a park
of the old Jewish cemetery grounds would
not only pay for the land but would make i
it the handsomest park in the City outside
of Golden Gate fork. This is the only
nance the City will ever have to get suit
ble land for a park in the Mission."
a At the mass-meeting James D. Phelan
will be asked to act as the honorary chair
man and principal orator of the evening.
It is the intention of the several clubs
heretofore existing: in the southern por
tion, comprising the San Miguel Defense
Association, the Noe Valley Improvement
Club, the High School organization, the
Mission Defense Association and the
Park organization, to consolidate into one
general Southside improvement associa
tion.
The Folsom-street boulevard organiza
tion, of which body A. B. Maguire is th 9
president, having succeeded by dint of
nard work in obtaining their end, will dis
organize as a distinctive body and assimi
late with the genera} progressive organiza
tion.
Since the inception of the High School
movement it is amusing as well as in
structive to notice the exertions mani
fested by real estate speculators in picking
out suitable sites for the school and
buzzing the promoters of the scheme with
the advantages of each and every location
picked out.
Mr. Phelan, it is said, favor 3 locating the
High School as closely as possible to the
California School of Mechanical Arts, bet
ter known as the James Lick School, on
the block bounded by Sixteenth, Nebraska,
Utah and El Dorado streetsf his reason
being, among others, that the Mechanical
School has now an attendance of 350 pu
pils. With the High School close by, pu
pils could, if they so desired, avail them
selves of the benefits of both.
A CHARGE OF MURDER.
John Lynch Says Michael Costello
Caused the Death of His
Wife.
John Lynch, 38 Gilbert street, applied
yesterday to Thomas F. Graham, warrant
clerk of Police Court Department 2, for a
warrant allowing ihe arrest of his son-in
law, Michael Costello, on a charge of
murder.
The alleged crime was committed March
9, 1895, and Lynch's suspicions are based
on the fact that his wife was found in bed
dead with many peculiar marks on her
throat, indicating foul play. At the in
quest Costello said his wife had been ill
for some days, and that her death was
occasioned by heart disease.
Lynch, the father of the dead woman,
placed the matter in the hands of Attorney
Henry E. Highton, who, through the as
sistance of a private detective, secured cer
tain evidence. When Lynch asked for a
warrant yesterday he was not prepared to
swear positively to certain details, and so
the matter was allowed to rest for a time.
Attorney Highton and the complaining
witness Lynch stated that the complaint
might be sworn to to-day.
Another Railroad Victim.
Mrs. McEntee, an inmate of the Old Ladles'
Home, suffered a fractured hip yesterday as
the result of carelessness on the part of a
Third-street clectrlc-car imotorman. Mrs. Mc-
Entee desired to transfer to Market street, and
being less active than other passengers, had
only reached the bottom step when the car
started off. The sudden jerk caused the old
lady to lose her balance, throwing her against
the curbing, with the result stated.
THEY DOUBT ASHWORTH.
Folsom-Street Improvement Club j
Fearful of His Last
Move.
Believe They Detect a Desire to
Thwart the Completion of
Their Boulevard.
Street Superintendent Ashworth's an
nouncement to t lie Board of Supervisors
and the Merchants' Association that funds |
for street work are exhausted aud notify
ing the board that no more contracts
should be awarded for special work has
aroused the vigilance of the members of
the South End Improvement Club to such
an extent that they believe they detect a
premeditated design on the part of Mr.
Ash worth to thwart at the eleventh hour
the repairing and improving of Foisom
street, between Third and Sixth.
J. J. McEwen of the executive commit
tee of the Folsom-street Improvement
Club said yesterday: "Mr. Ashwcrth tried
to do this same thing when his deputy
appeared beioTe the Street Committee and
endeavored to prov" a lack of funds for re
pairing Foisom street, between Sixth an-!
Nineteenth, nut we furnished figures that
completely refuted his. These were ob
tained from his own office, and proved to
the satisfaction of the Street Committee
that there were funds sufficient to do this
much-needed work, and the committee,
in accordance with the facts furnished,
awarded the contract.
"We feel satisfied that an equally favor
able showing of funds could be made to
complete the work.
"We feel that he is putting men on the
street at day labor whose work is often un
necessary and siows no permanent im
provement. An example of extravagance
in this line is the sewer lately placed at
the corner of Sixteenth and Foisom streets.
When the sewer was put In the men were
directed to tamp down the old paving
blocks instead of leaving the street un
paved for the laying of bitumen."
I. Schwartz, also of the executive com
mittee, said: "We feel that Mr. Ashworth
has always been against us. We claim
that no permanent showing has been made
with the money expended for street re
pairs. It is the intention to cease all further
Btreet work, then the three blocks on Foi
som street, between Third and Sixth, must
remain as they are, although only about
$10,000 would be necessary for the work,
$3300 of whfch remains from the original
appropriation of $35,000. It is much to the
merchants' advantage to have this" work
completed. Then a well-paved thorough
fare, with the exception or one block, will
extend from the Mission down into the re-
I tail district in the heart of Keariiy street.
OUT OF BUSINESS.
The Los Angeles Branch of Thomas
Day & Co. Closes its
: Doors. '.
Frank J. Symmes, president of the
Thomas Day & Co. corporation of this
City, has gone to Los Angeles to wind up ;
the affairs of the company in the branch
house which it established there two years
ago.
The impression in local mercantile
circles is that the Los Angeles branch died
from excessive railroad freight rates
charged â by the Southern Pacihc, just as
other houses in Southern California have
been ' crushed by the " excessive freight
tariffs. " â  * : : .' 'â "â â  â  -. .â¢ ' .- â â  \ â  :
It i* a well-understood fact among local
jobbers tuat the Eastern bouses sending

market both in the north and in the south
because their drummers can undersell the
California mercantile tourists, owing to the
favorable discrimination made them by
the railroad, hence many of the San Fran
cisco houses nave taken their travelers off
the road, v ;v-v'. VV: =i- ':>">â - - ''.â â¢â¢â â¢â ;â 'â¢â¢- -i-j

THEATRICALS IN SOCIETY
Preparations Are Complete for
Mrs. Hager's Enter
tainment.
THE FAVBE-BABCOCK NUPTIALS
Married Quietly in the Beautiful
Church at San Mateo on
Saturday Last.
Preparations for the Hager private
theatricals are now completed and soci
ety anxiously waits to applaud the belles
and beaux who will don the sock and bus
kin for their entertainment. Rehearsals
are progressing steadily and the partici
pants will doubtless cover themselves with
glory. The play selected for the occasion
is a merry three-act comedy entitled "A
Modern Ananias." The comedy has never
been "done" here before, but has had sev
eral very successful fashionable amateur
productions in the East. The scene of the
play is laid at Newport and affords the op
portunities for handsome interior and ex
terior settings.
The play also affords excellent opportu
nities for elegant costuming, a fact the
ladies -will be sure to take advantage of.
The cast Las been selected with especial
reference to the amateur's talent. To
Miss Minnie Houghton has been intrusted
the joys and (comedy) sorrows of the de
licious heroine, Myss Nellie Goldengate.
Miss Houchton has developed surprising
talent and is sure to astonish as well as
surprise her warmest admirers.
Miss Rose Hooper, the charming debu
tante, will take off the soubrette's role,
Kitty, and Miss Goodall will play Pru
dence Mayflower; Frank Matthieu will be the
hero and Frank Owens is going to discount all
the famous female impersonators in his cre
ation of Baby.
The complete cast of the play is as follows:
Lysander Lyon M. D. (with a vivid imagina
tion), Frank Matthieu ; Colonel Lyon (with a for
giving disposition), Dr. Redding; Derby Dash
wood (with a Piccadilly accent), Edgar Peixotto ;
Francesca (with an elastic conscience), George
de Long; Baby (a little tootsie wootsie), Frank
Owens; Nellie Goldengate (with a fickle fancy),
Mi^s Minnie Houghton; Prudence Mayflower
(with New England notions), Miss Goodall;
Kitty (with so much a month and board), Miss
Rose Hooper.
The amateurs rehearse on Mondays, Wednes
days and Fridays at the residence of Mitt
Ho'ughton on California street. Leo Cooper is
coaching the performers, and has entire charge
of the stage management.
Invitations to the theatrical will be limited
to 200, and the guests will all be young people.
Light refreshments will be served, and if the
young folks wish to dance, there will be music
and the hall at their disposal. Mrs. Hager has
set the dtite for her delightful entertainment
for Monday evening, April 13, at the new Na
tive Sons' Hall.
Mrs. Favre and Harry Eabcock â were quietly
married on Saturdaylast at the little church |
at San Mateo, Bishop Nichols officiating.
There were no invited guests at the wedding
no briaal attendants, no decorations. The many
friends of the happy couple were aware that
the nuptials were to be celebrated before the
expiration of the Lenten season, but -were
given no other clew as to the date of the happy '
event. Alter the ceremony the newly Redded :
pair went to Mrs. Babcock'3 pretty cottage at <
San Mateo, which has baen recently refitted
and refurnished. There they will pass their
honeymoon and later in the season go to Clear
Lake.
A Queer Story.
Some four years ago, in Teheran, an
English sailor was caught in the act of
carrying off some precious stones from the
Shah's palace. The thief was brought be
fore the "King of Kin^s," who swore that
the next time the sailor crossed his path
he would at once put him to death. It is
a curious fact that this very sailor was
crossing the street when the Shah was
driving in Berlin, now some years ago,
and was knocked down and instantane
ously killed.

AS A DRAMATIST
Young Leland S. Ramsdell's
Comedy to Be Played
To-Day.
AN AUTHOR AT FIFTEEN
Schoolboys Will Produce the
Work at Armory Hall for
Charity.
FARMER PUMPKINHEAD'B WOES
The Ingenious Way That a Mortgage
Was Paid Is the Soul of
the Plot.
A playwright of the age of 15 years is
Leland Stanford Ramedell of 1100 Morton
street, Alanieda.
This afternoon, at 2 o'cloce, a comedy
that lie has written will be put on the
htage at Armory Hall, Alameda, for the
benefit af several poor families in the city
beyond the bay. The boy has produced
little plays before, and he and three of his
schoolmates have had a dramatic associa
tion of their own for two or three years,
but to-day's performance is by far their
most ambitious undertaking.
The boys associated in the work with
the young author are Herbert Clark, a
14-year-old boy of 1003 Morton street ;
Clarence Henry Oliver of 812 West street,
Oakland, who is 13 years of age, and
George Macauley, aged 14, of 1421 Santa
Clara avenue, Alameda.
The play that these boys are to present
this afternoon is a comedy entitled:
"Fifteen Thousand Dollars, or a Lottery
Ticket." Young Ramsdell has, in thi3
production, told an entertaining story of
the trials and tribulations of good old
Farmer Pumpkinhead and his wife with
their ultimate triumph over misfortune,
and their unique reception, at last, in the
home of the Vanderbilts.
For a boy of just 15 years, the comedy is
regarded as highly meritorious, and the
rehearsals during the week have shown
that the four young actors can present it
to the public in a truly attractive manner.
There is first the home scene of the
Pumpkinheads. with Mr. Pumpkinhead so
abstracted on account of a threatened fore
closure that he asks such questions as why
h is wife is making bread.
Hardhearted Deacon Brown declines to
leud money, and while the farmer is away
trying to argue the case with him a lot
tery ticket rascal, Dick Smart, comes
along to the mortgaged homestead and
imposes on nonest Mrs. Pumpkinhead by
taking her last two brts. '
The farmer, returning m despair, de
tects the two chairs close together and
knows that his wife has been gossiping j
with somebody. He begins an investica- j
tion, but Mrs. Pumpkin head retains her !
presence of mind and convinces him that !
Bhe has used the two chairs to hold the
bread-pan, though she skilfully avoids
telling an untruth. Finally, in a tit of
patnetic desperation and possibly antici
pating a request for the two bits, she con
fesses that she has bought the lottery
ticket.
Consternation sweeps over the weather
beaten face of Mr. Pumpkinhead, but the
shrewd farmer finally comes out a winner
of $15,000 by mesmerizing the lottery man
and a rich bit of humor is produced by the
youthfuf playwright in making his agri
cultural hero ask of Mrs. Pumpkinhead:
"Can you keen a secret?"
With the $15,000 in his shoe Mr. Pump
kinhead takes his wife to New York. He
is encountered by a bunco-steerer who
tries to get at the $15,000 by appealing to
the old gentleman's fondness for tiirtation.
Pumpkinhead is saved from the bunco-
Eteorer by a policeman and from the
policeman by Mrs. Pumpkinhead.
The last scene is in the mansion of the
Vanderbilts once an asylum for the in
sane. Young Sam Vanderbilt does some
practical joking and is sent to bed by his
father and then a cordial welcome from
the head of the house is extended to the
â Pumpkinheads.
In the performance to-day Leland
Ramsdell will take tne part of Mr. Pump
kiihead. Mrs. Pumpkinhead will be rep
resented by Herbert Clark, Mr. Vanderbilt
and the bunco-steererjby Clarence Oliver,
and Dick Smart and Sam Vanderbilt by
George Macauley. Following is the full
text of the comedy:

we do?
Mrs. P.â Why don't you try ana find some
one who will lend you the money? Here's
Deacon Brown. He's got plenty of money; why
don't you ask him?
Mr. P.â Xo. Deacon Brown is too stingy; he
wouldn't lend you a cent.
Mrs. P.â Well, that's the last thing left to do,
and If you don't ask him I will.
(Rising and going toward the door.)
Mr. P.â No, don't you go. I will, and if he
doesn't let us have the money we must give up
the farm.
(Leaves the room.)
Mrs. Pumpkinhead returns her attention to
the bread. A knock at the door.
Enter Dick Smartâ Well, madam, I came to

Mr?. P.â No, thaak you; candles are good

Mrs. P.â l never heard of auy such thing.
What do they cost?
D. S.â Some cost $1 and others cost 25 cents.
Mrs. P.â Well, I have but 25 cents in the
whole world and I guess I will buy one this
time if you will give me my money back if I
don't win $15,000.
D. s.â l can't do that, but I am quite sure you
will win something.
Mrs. P.â Well, 1 will take it this time.
Just then Mr. P. is heard coming, and Mrs.
I', puts the lottery-dealer out.
(Enter Mr. P., and, seeing two chairs near
each other, says:)
â¢'Mrs. Pumpkinhead, what are these two
*bairs doing so near together?"
Mrs. P.â Why, l have been making bread.
Mr. P.â Why, of course. How could I have
thought anything else?
Mrs. P.â Well, did you succeed in getting
any money?
Mr. P.-No; Deacon Brown said he couldn't
lend us any.
Mrs. P.â Well, what else can we do?
Mr. P.â Nothing, nothing! We must give up
the farm.
Mrs. P.â Have you ever heard of a lottery
ticket ?
Mr. P.â A what? A lottery ticket? Why,
those are fearful things!
Mrs. P.â l htve bought one, and the drawing
takes place in three hours.
Mr. P.â l will tell you what I will do. Can
you keep a secret ?
Mrs. P.â l guess so. What's up now?
Mr. P.â l will mesmerize the lottery-ticket
dealer.
Mrs. P.â What? You wicked creature! What
would Deacon Young say if he knew that?
Mr. P.â l don't care what he would say. 1
will do it anyhow.
(Knock at the door. Enter Dick Smart. Mr.
â  Pumpkinhead begins to mesmerize him.)
Mr. P.â What did you come for?
D. S.â To tell you that you have won $15,000.
Mr. P.â Please give me the money.
D. S.â Not until you sign your name.
Mr. P.â But 1 can't write. I only can make
;ny mark.
D. s.â Well, do so, a"hd that will be sufficient.
(Hands Mr. P. the money.)
D. S.â Where do I come in? Don't I get any
thing?
Mr. and Mrs. P.â No. You can go.
(Kick him out.)
Mr. P.â Now, Mrs. Pumpkinhead, what will
we do with the remainder of the money after
we pny the mortgage?
Mrs. P.â Let us take a trip to New York.
Mr. P.â That's a go, Mrs. Pumpkinhead; go
and pack up and we will go at once, for we have
$15,000 and
Mrs. P.â A lottery ticket.
(Curtain.)
SCENE 11.
Fifth avenue, New York. Mr. and Mrs. Pump-
! kinhead looking at the buildings.
Mrs. P.â l feel very hungry after our long

Mr. P.â There is a restaurant right down the

Mrs. P.â Won't you come, too?
Mr. P.â No, I will be on this spot when you

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1896.
JAPAN'S FIRST SOLDIER.
Arrival of General Marquis Ya
magata on the Steam
ship Coptic.
ON HIS WAY TO RUSSIA.
The Japanese Emperor's Delegation
to the Coronation of the
New Czar.
Japan's greatest generalâ the hero of
Ping Yangâ the father of the modern
Japanese system of war â arrived from his
native country on the Coptic last evening.
General Marquis Yamagata is on his
way to Moscow to attend the coronation of
the new Czar. He is accompanied by his
suite, and will meet in Moscow Prince
Fnshimi of the imperial family, with three
officers of high rank, who are also bound
for Moscow, but by way of the Indian
Ocean. The embassy will represent the
Emperor of Japan at the ceremonies.
The Marquis is a small man, slightly
gray, and with a gray mustache. His is a
true Japanese face, but his complexion is
not so dark as the average of his country
men, and his bu?hy, gray eyebrows re
lieve his eyes of their Oriental character.
He is pleasant and communicative to
those who can speak to him in
his own tongue, but he seems not yet

[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
to have acquired the knack of talking
through an interpreter, on the spur of the
moment. He is one of the foremost diplo
mats and statesmen in Japan, and his
mission to the court of Kussia is fraught
with much interest. There is not much
doubt but that the Korean problem will
be discussed with the Russian Ministers,
and the visit of ceremony may bring im
portant results.
The Coptic was spoken from Point Reyes
about half-past 5 o'clock last evening. She
arrived off the barge office at Meiggs
wharf a little before 8, and by that time
the quarantine tug with a welcoming
party on board was out in the stream to
mest her. Hon. Sabaro Koyaj Japanese
Consul to this City, who is a son-in-law of
the Marquis, and Tetsutaro Aabri, mana
ger of the Yokohama Bank, were present
to represent the Japanese consulate; Lieu
tenant-Colonel Will E. Fisher of the Gov
ernor's staff was there to present the com
pliments of the executive and to extend
courtesies, and William D. English and S.
J. Ruddell represented the Custom-house.
By the courtesy of Dr. Chalmers the party
was taken on board in his boat.
General Yamagata, dressed in gray and
with no outward mark of his high rank,
was at the supper table when the party
arrived. He arose from his seat and met
the members at the dcor of the saloon,
and then, after presentations, the general,
his suite and the delegation from above
adjourned to the library. Here Colonel
Fisher, who was in full uniform, pre
sented the compliments of the Governor
and tendered the general every courtesy
that the executive could extend. Through
his official secretary, K. Tsudzuki, he re
turned thanks to the Governor, anu asked
to have his compliments presented. Mr.
English then extended the courtesies of
the Custom-house and then the party from
shore talked to those of the general's
suite who could converse in Engliab.
The Coptic docked at once and the gen
eral and his attendants proceeded to the
Palace Hotel. He himself was not will
ing to submit to an interview, but Mr.
Tsudzuki met the newspaper men, and
talked freely of the ruovenients of the
party.
They will remain here but a few days,
perhaps three or four, and will then pro
ceed to New York. They may stop some
timo in Washington, but they will aim to
arrive at Moscow just before the cere
monies. These will occupy about three
weeks, and soon after they close the gen
eral expects to be on his way honle again.
He will probably return through this
country.
As to the further intentions of the dip
lomat in Russia, Mr. Tsiklzuki would
make no comment, nor would he say
aught of the attitude either of Russia or
Japan on the Korean question. As to
the war he says the country has almost
entirely recovered from it. The Japanese
think they have won all they fought for;
they wanted the independence of Korea
and Korea is free. As to what Japan con
siders her own standing among the war
rior nations of the earth the secretary
modestly declined to say.
General Yamagata is 56 years old, and
for nearly three-fourths of that time he
has been a soldier. For years, however,
his position has been one of high author
iiy in the Government of the country.
He was Prime Minister just after the
reformation, and subsequently was made
Minister of the Interior. While in that
position he visited the United States and
Europe, inspecting the military systems
of all the countries he visited. He took
back with him a thorough knowledge of
all that was good in what he ?aw, and at
once began to model the Japanese army
upon the lines of what had best stood the
test of experience in other countries.
At the beginning of the war he was the
ranking marshal, and his handling of the
troops showed him to be a strategist of a
high order. After the victory of Ping
Yang his army went into camp
on the Yalu River, and there he
was taken seriously ill. By order
of the Emperor Le returned to the
capital and he was made Minister of
War in recognition of the distinguished
services he had rendered in the field. He
resigned his position as Minister of War
some time ago, but when the Emperor
needed a statesman and a soldier to repre
sent him in the court of his neighbor, the
Russians, the general was given the honor,
and he is now on his way to fulfill his mis
sion.
The gentlemen with him are : K. Tsud
znki, Keeper of the Imperial Archives;
Major Oshima of the Japanese Artillery ;
H. Kawasaki, Secretary of the Foreign
Department, Surgeon Kirai and Messrs.
Terazaki and Kadji, subalterns. The
legation which will meet this party in
Moscow is composed of Prince Fuchimi,
Colonel Ikida and Lieutenant; Colonel
Tuizo.
THE LABOR COUNCIL.
Affiliated Unions Decide to Stand by
Itâ Opposition to Convict-
Made Goods.
The Labor Council held a brief session
last night at 1159 Mission street, T. F.
Burns, vice-president, in the chair. Dele
gates from the Brewery Workmen, Ameri
can Bakers' Union No. 51 and from the
Coast Seamen's Union reported that the
associations which they represented would
stand by the Labor Council "through
thick and thin," to quote the language of
one of the delegates.
The executive committee had visited
seven unions affiliated in the council for
the purpose of receiving opinions on the
question of continuing or disbanding the
council. It reported that three weeks at
least would be needed to finish the work
and was instructed to appointed sub-com
mittees to continue visiting.
The executive committee was requested
to address the Coolcs' and Waiters' Union
next Tuefdav night on "Trade Unionism."
Thomas Hurd, George Swahel, J. Cra
ven and C. A. Landslrom were appointed
a committee to confer with the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association to
secure its support in a popular movement
against introduction of convict-made
goods. This action was taken on the mo
tion of Thomas Kurd of the Ironmoulders'
Union, who announced that a local hard
ware firm had bought molds and business
of an Eastern stove concern with the in
tention of making 400 stoves a month in
San Francisco. If convict stoves were ad
mitted, however, this new and very
promising enterprise would be destroyed*
A coaimittee from the recently organized
Garment-workers' Union requested that a
committee from the council would attend
their next session s>.nd give advice on the
management of a union. The garment
workers are novices in organizing, but are
anxious to do the right thing under proper
direction. The executive committee will
send a sub-committee to pave tne way for
the tailors.
HINTON IS CALLED AWAY
The General Agent of the Pan
ama Railroad Summoned
to the Isthmus.
His Departure Relieved to Mean the
Reorganization of the Trans*
continental Lines.
Commercial and shipping circles were
agoe yesterday over the report in circula
tion that E. H. Hinton, the general agent
of the Panama Railroad Company in this
City, had been called away from the City
by his superiors and that the office of ths
company was to be closed in consequence.
Many expressions of surprise and regret
were heard â surprise that such a course
should bÂ« taken without some notice to
shippers, and regret that Mr. Hinton was
to go from among them, for that gentle
man by his uniform courtesy and his earn
est efforts to promote the welfare of his
company has won the regard and esteem
of evtry one who came in contact with
him.
Investigation of the rumor proved, how
ever, that while Mr. Hinton was to leave
for Panama this morning on the San Bias
the office of the Panama Railroad Com
pany would not be closed, but would be in
charge of the Johnson-Locke Mercantile
Company.
Mr. Hinton was summoned by wire yes
terday to go to Panama to there meet G.
Whaley, the vice-president and general
manager of t:.e company, for the purpose,
it i? believed, of looking into the Central
American traffic question. Mr. Hinton I
will be pone not less than sixty days.
It is conjectured in railroad circles that i
his departure may have some significance |
in connection with the Transcontinental
Traffic Association that is in process of
formation at New York, and gives reason
to believe that that body is certain to be
reorganized, if that object has not already
been accomplished. It is argued that if
the Panama road was likely to be a com
peting factor in the through freight traffic,
so energetic, shrewd and capable a man as
Mr. Hinton proved himself to be would
not be ordered to leave his important post
in this City.
Althouah westbound freight rates are
to remain the same via Panama until at
least the Ist of May, it is believed that the
eastbound schedule, which now quotes as
low as 30 cents per 100 on some commodi
ties, will be advanced after the departure
of tlie steamer, which will sail on the Bth
of April.
The valleys of Cashmere in Northern
India and of Quito in Ecuador possess
climates which are almost perfect, but
they suffer the disadvantages of great dis
tance from the sea.
LIKENS WOMEN TO CATS
Mrs. Nolte Says Thousands Have
No More Regard for
Results.
VOTING WITH BLIND EYES.
Ministers Who Unite Divorcees Should
Be Punished by Ten Years'
Imprisonment.
Woman suffrage was the subject of dis
cussion, although not of debate, at the
monthly meeting of the Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union of the Third Con
gregational Church yesterday.
The president, Mrs. C. B. Williams, had
assigned the topic for consideration, but
requested that there be no debate, and to
prevent such she asked that each lady
read an expression of her opinions,
whether written by herself or as she had
seen them reflected in print.
The arguments with which suffragists
convince and convert were repeated by
the lacfces with a good deal of enthusiasm,
and there was remarkable unanimity of
sentiment in favor of tne franchise for
women until Mrs. Isabel Nolte rose, and,
smilingly squaring herself to meet forensic
foes, said:
I think, firstand foremost, the W. C.T.U. have
in view the making strong their position in
every way.
It would be good sense to endeavor to enlist
! the pood will and co-operatloa of the men of
; our families and otherwise.
I am fully convinced that we endanger all
the good that might be done by lugging in at
all times suffrage for women. And >ou ask for
| too much. Suffragists are always asking some
i thing from the Legislatures which they don't
Bet. It would be wiser and more dignified if
they confined themselves to some necessary
law which wonld probably be given them, and
then endeavor to strengthen their position on
that line.
Of course the idea is if we could vote the sa
loons would be closed. Do you think that our
vote would close them when we have not beeu
able as yet to educate our sons to keep out of
them?
Suppose the right to vote were ours. There
are thousands of women belonging to the
foreign class who partake of beer and wines,
and yet do not make a practice of becoming
intoxicated. They would be a detriment to
the temperance cause, for they would consider
any prohibitory laws an infringement upon
their rights; and, as a matter of course, they
would vote their own way.
Bishop John H. Vincent, founder of Chau
tauqua, says the curse of America to-day is the
dominated partisan vote, the vote of ignor
ance and superstition. Shall we help matters
by doubling this dangerous mass?
Until we fully master our own dominion,
rule our children and our households wisely,
cope skillfully with the warring elements
there and make living a little easier, charity
more intelligent and education a shade more
practical, it seems as if we might well spare
ourselves other irksome duties and confine
our attention to obtaining more conspicuous
mastery of our own province. There is enough
to do in general charities and reformations
and in schemes for education to occupy those
whose energies demand a wide sphere.
Simple voting can be done without any great
expenditure of force; but to attain any real
power a woman must affiliate with men, at
tend meetings and caucuses â she must enter
into politics just as a man would.
To me it seems as though that would not be
pleasant to most women.
I have heard women say, with a great deal
of decision: "Oh, certainly, we should not
hold office. The men should do the work of
governing, but it would be our duty to see
thai good men were put in office. It's our
duty to vote, because that's the best way to
show what we think oueht to be done by the
men who govern."
This, from my point of view, is very unequal
suffrage. Half the controlling power to be
ours, and all the work and responsibility to be
theirs.
And how should we know when good men
were nominated except by a knowledge of
their phases of character, gained by hard work
before elections, going to primaries, pulling
wires, etc. ?
You cannot simply vote for the candidate
you consider the best man, without regard for
anything but his personal trustworthiness and
ability, I'ou have got to know something be
sides.
The best man, where a political office is in
question, is the ore who will have the most
power to legislate for us toward the best result,
and that makes it necessary for us to know
something of his ideas and habits, bis wisdom
and tact, and what influence he might have on
other politicians and with the people, as well
as with regard to his knowledge and con
scientiousness.
In fact, it means work that the generality of
women are not fit for and have not the time
forâ if they are good wives and mothers. And
if they do not do this, and more, they simply
vote with blind eyes, for men whom they had
no share in selecting, or they duplicate the
vote of men they consider intelligent. I, for
one, would not wish to vote in this manner
just a mere echo.
I think if suffrage is ever given to us, you
will rind there will be more bitter animosities
among women, just as much deepicable wire
pulling and jealoules, as among men.
If the good women vote, the bad, depraved
women of the slums and the demi-monde will
also vote.
There are more of this class who will avail
themselves of suffrage than of the other, and
they will be under the control and in the pay
of vicious men, who will use their influence
for the worst, to be sure.
Then there are thousands of women who will
vote just because they can, without regard to
anything elseâ with no more regard to the re
sult of their vote, than a cat; and none of you
blessed women here need say:
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Mrs. Molte,
to run down your sisters?"
It's the truth. I don't mean to say there are
not women capable of voting intelligently
(notably the sisterhood here at present), but
they are few and far between, and I don't be
lieve but what the majority of the dear, good
woman are content to let the men take care of
the laws ot the land, while wÂ« bring up our
children to respect them.
The paper was received with mingled
smiles and frowns, but as debate was not
permitted there was no reply.
A little ripple was caused by one lady's
statement in connection with her com
plaint of the injustice of existing laws, that
there should be a legislative enactment
making a minister who united a couple,
either of whom had been divorced, liable
to imprisonment for ten years.
RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND PROGRESS
SELF-CONTROL.
To conquer one's self is the successful
achievement only of those who have been re
deemed by the precious blood of Christ and
who are his divine disciples.â Rev. E. Trum
bull, Presbyterian, Cincinnati, Ohio.
THE CHVRCH MILITANT.
We sometimes speak of the church triumph
ant and the church militant. This is not so.
The church militant is the church triumphant
and the church triumphant is the church mili
tant. â Rev. James V. Vernon, Christian
Church, Augusta. Ga.
FAITH-
Faith finds its most intelligent expression
not in words but in actions. There is always a
reciprocal protection between the believer and
his belief. A good man is himself everywhere.
A godly man takes God p.long.â Rev. J. I.
Scott, Presbyterian, Philadelphia, Pa.
LIFE.
I would Dainta bright picture of life from
birth to the grave. I have no sympathy with
that pessimism whicn makes youth a blunder,
manhood a struggle and old ace a regret.â
Rev. J. M. Cromer, Lutheran, Kansas City, Mo.
INDIFFERENCE.
If the American Republic falls it will be
through indifferenceâ our accursed "good na
ture which binds us to our dangers." Indiffer
enco is the besetting menace to the perpetuity
of our form of government.â Rabbi Joseph
Stolz, Hebrew, Chicago, 111.
DESPONDENCY.
Almost all men of great and stirring deeds
have had their seasons of discouragement and
doubt. All life is a struggle, and doubts and
difficulties seem to be the necessary concomi
tants of life and progress.â Rev. J. \V. Lyell,
Baptist, Camden, N. J.
HEATHENS.
In this world there are 1,000,000,000 of peo
ple :of these 800,000,000 are heathens. In the
remaining there are many Christians, but
there are many who, though they are not
heathen, are far from good Christians.â Bishop
Coleman, Episcopalian, at Westchester, Pa.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
The Catholic church is now and ever has
been the altar of every sacrifice, the home of
every charity, the asylum for every misery,
and they who reject and hate her reject and
hate her divine founder, Jesus Christ.â Rev.
Father Dwyer, Catholic, Cleveland, Ohio.
LOYALTY.
Above all party is country, and above coun
try is humanity. It is in politics as in ecclesi
astic*. Denominational fealty is a good thing ;
but it is by no means the first thing. That
man serves his denomination most truly who
serves Christ most loyalty .âRev. R. Thomas,
Congregationalist, Brookline, Mass.
DECAY IN CIVILIZATION.
Ours is a civilization that is beginning to
decay. We do not practice the religion of
natural law. The wealthy from their idleness
and indulgence of self, are beginning to de
cayâto lose that stamina and sturdy manhood
and womanhood of our sires.â Mrs. Althea B.
Stryker, Independent. Tupeka, Kans.
LOVE.
There is one virtue that is superior to all
others, and that is love. You may possess
every grace and every virtue, but if you lack
this one your life is worthless. If love is not
paramount in our lives, all our benevolence
and self-sacrifice protit us nothing.â Rev. G. \V.
Partridge, Baptist, Cincinnati, Ohio.
CtBA.
It is not so much a question as to who shall
govern Cuba, so long as the Government is a
good one, but as to whether there shall exist a
tyranny in Cuba. When Spain rises in anger
at our protest she should remember that her
own honor should protest against her own
tyranny and broken promises.â Rev. T. E.
Schumacher, Baptist, Pittsburg, Pa.
AMVSEMENTS.
Avoid amusements that the church in gen
eral condemns, is it not better to be in har
mony with the main body of good Christians
than with the few exceptions? I think a man
may dance, play cards and attend the theater
and still be a Christian, but his influence will
be weakened and his soul fettered.â Rev. Dr.
Humason, Methodist, Duluth.Minn.
WOMEN IN POLITICS.
Victoria doesn't rule England. It is the
freest land on the face of the carth â that is,
for Englishmen. And why is this so?
Simply because the dear, good old lady
doesn't interfere in politics. And let me say
that it might be better for this country if the
ladies did not interfere in politics.â Rev. 11.
11. Con well, Congregationalist, Philadelphia,
Pa.
DOCTOR ALBRIGHT.
A BROAD-MINDED PHYSICIAN
WITH PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.
Believes in Recommending Any Medi
cine That He Knows Will Cure His
Patient* â Thinks Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills a Great Dlncoveryâ
He Cites Some Marvelous
Cures.
From the Examiner, Lancaster, Pa.
"Akron, Pa., April 24, '95.
Dr. Williams' Medicine Co. :
Gentlemenâ While it is entirely contrary to
the custom of the medical profession to indorse
or recommend any of the so-called proprietary
preparations, I shall, nevertheless, give you an
account ot some of my wonderful experiences
with your preparation, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
for Pale People The fact is well known that
medical practitioners do not, as a rule, recog
nize, much less use, preparations of this kind,
consequently the body of them have no defi
nite knowledge of their virtue or lack of it, but
soundly condemn them all without a trial.
Such a "course is manifestly absurd and unjust,
and I for one propose to give my patients the
best treatment known to me lor the particular
disease with which they are suffering, no mat
ter what it is, where or how obtained. I was
first brought to prescribe Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills about two yearÃ ago, after having seen
some remarkable results from their use. Reuben
Hoover, now of Reading, Pa., was a prominent
contractor and builder. While superintending
the work of erecting a large building during
co!d weather, he contracted what was thought
to be sciatica. He having first noticed it one
morning in not being able to crise from his
bed. After the usual treatment for this dis
ease he failed to improve, but on the contrary
grew rapidly worse, the case developing into
Hemiphlegia, or partial paralysis of the entire
right side of the body. Electricity, tonics and
massage, etc., were all given a trial, but noth
ing gave any benefit, and the paralysis contin
ued. In despair he was compelled to hear his
physician announce that his case was hopeless.
About that time his wife noticed one of your
advertisements and concluded to try your
Pink Pills.
"He had given up hope and it required a
great deal of begging on the part of his wife to
persuade him to take them regularly.
"He, however, did as she desired, and if ap
pearances indicate health in this man, one
would think he was better than before his par
alysis.
" 'Why, 1 says he, 'I began to improve in two
days, and in four or five weeks I was entirely
well and at work.'
"Having seen these results I concluded that
such a remedy is surely worth a trial at the
hands of any physician, and consequently
when a short time later I was called upon to
treat a lady suffering with palpitation of the
heart and great nervous prostration, alter the
usual remedies failed to relieve, I ordered Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills. The result was simply
astonishing:. Her attacks became less frequent
and also less in severity, until by their use for
a period of only two months she was the pic
ture of health, rosy-cheeked and bright-eyed,
as woll as ever, and she has continued so until
to-day, more than one year since she took any
medicine. I have found these pills* specific
for chorea, or, as more commonly known, St.
Vltus' dance, as beneficial results have in all
cases marked their use. As a spring tonic any
one who, from overwork or nervous strain dur
ing a Jong winter, has become pale and lan
guid, the Pink Pills will do wonders in bright
ening the couutenance and in buoying the
spirits, bringing roses to the pallid lips and re
newing the fountain of youth. Yours respect
fully, "J. D. ALBRIGHT, M.D."
SEIZED HER HORSES.
A Pitiful Tale That Brought Belief
From the Board of Supervisors.
Mrs. Amelia Sternseher told the Health
and Police Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors a pathetic tale yesterday that in
duced that body to release from the cus
tody of the Poundkeeper her three horses.
She stated that the animals were the sole
support of herself and iamily, and that a
few days ago they were ueized while graz
ing in a vacant lot in charge of her young
brother.
Her household furniture and even the
horses were mortgaged, and now that she
could not obtain any income from them
her lamily was threatened with absolute
destitution. The committee ordered the
horses released at once and without
charge.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The uncertainty of the weather during
the past week has caused the wheel
rcen to alter their plans icgarding pro
posed road races in the country. As soon
as the roads are in condition to wheel
over several club runs will be held to
points of interest in the interior.
The anglers are in hopes that the trout
streams will be in good condition on
Wednesday next, when the season will
open.
Sportsmen who fancy live bird and
bluerock shooting will be present to
morrow to witness the race at the -Oakland
track between the Olympic, Lincoln and
Empire Gun clubs.
A wrestling tournament will be held at
the Olympic Club Monday exening. The
athletes of the University of Berkeley will
send a strong team Last this year to com
pete in the intercollegiate championships.
Coursing, rowing, handball, boxing,
rifle-shooting and other pastimes are en
joying first-class patronage.
THE WHEELMEN.
All the Fast Club Riders Preparing I
for the Annual Relay Race.
The annual relay rare around the bay is j
the one event to which the wheelmen are j
now giving all their attention. The date j
lias been set for Bnnday, April 12, and all
the intervening Sundays and week days j
will be devoted to training and other pre- j
parations. There will be a number of ton
mile road races held to-morrow over the San
Leandro course, which will in reality be
try-out? to aid in the selection of men for
the variousteams. The Bay City, Olympic,
California. San Fram-isco and Acme clubs
will hold these practice rides. The Reli
ance men will ride ten miles on the
Oakland Trotting Park track, and down at
San .lose the Road Ciub and Garden City
Cyclers will use the East San Jose course.
Chairman Stratton of the road racing
committee of the associated clubs intended
to ride over the last fhty miles of the relay
course Thursday, to measure and lay it put
accurately, but the rain prevented the trip.
He wiil go to-morrow, accompanied by the
other two gentlemen on the committee, H.
F. Wynne and A. P. Swain.
In spite of the many vague reports and
rumors fivine around there is really very
little news regarding the relay race. This
event is looked upon by the club wheel
men as the greatest race" of the year, and
their best efforts are put forth into it. It
is easy enough to take some prominent
club, like the Olympic, for instance, and
pick seven or eight of its best men and say
they will surely be on its relay team this
year. That would be true, but until the
team of ten men is thoroughly completed
its strength could not be estimated, cer
tainly not by eight men. It has been said
that a team of ten average riders could
beat 8 team of eight crackajacks and two
poor men. and it is probably so. When
each club is ready to name its full comple
ment of ten men Then the respective mer
its of the various leanis and their chances
of winning can t>e> co a certain extent esti
mated, but not bsfiore.
The opinion was general a week ago that
the Bay City Wheelmen would not consent
to a postponement of the date of t lie race
one week, but it appears now that that is
just what that club wanted. Though pos
sessing an immense number of racing men
none of them are in their best condition.
and the club has not even held a try-out as
yet to decide who are entitled to positions
on its team. It loses one powerful rid^r,
W. A. Terrill, who is now a professional.
The relay rules admit of only amateurs
competing in the race, and last year Ter
rill as a class B man rode his ten miles in
splendid style. However, the club now
has K. L. Lonj, who rode for the Olympic
Club Wheelmen a year ago, and if he can
be got into condition in time will be one of
its best men. Then there are Ulbricht,
kacey. Hatton and McCrea in Southern
California, all members of this club, who
could be called upon if needed, all four of
whom are phenomenally fast riders.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen's team
this year will undoubtedly be stronger
than it was in 1895, while the impression is
that the Garden City Cyclers of San Jose
will be weaker. The Acmes will be about
the same as last year, except that they
will not have Castleman and Burke of
Los Angeles. It is between these four
clubs that the race is supposed 1o lie,
though unforeseen incidents may change
the programme. It will at any rate be a
hard-fought contest, and the San Fran
cisco and San Jose Road clubs, Alameda,
Imperial, Reliance and California clubs all
have good men and are liable to change
places with some of the admitted leaders.
A map will be issued early next week by
the road racing committee which has
charge of the race, showing the new routes
through San Jose and into Alameda.
Printed rules governing the race will also
be sent out to the various clubs intending
to enter teams.
The Garden City Cyclers of San Jose
have appiied for a sanction for a race meet
to be held on their three-lap cement track
on Saturday, M*y H, the last day of the
San Jose rose carnival.
The Olympic Cyclers have announced
that they will give a minstrel show at
Native Sons' Hall on the evening of May
14, the proceeds to be used in fitting up
their rooms and expended on picnic runs
for the members.
C. N. Ravlin and L. C. Hunter, R. A.
Smyth and F. W . Fuller will nave a tan
dem race from Fruitvale to San Jose next
Saturday, starting at 2 o'clock.
R. M." Welch, member of the National
Racing Board in this district, has issued
his bulletin No. 5, dated yesterday, which
is full of items of interest to the racing men.
It is as follows:

The undersigned has been placed by the !
National Racine Board iv direct control of
North and South California, Nevada, Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Oregon
and Washington. Wherever practicable a local
representative will be appointed in each divi
sion to whom applications for sanctions may
be made, and who will otherwise give atten
tion to the local racing interests. Divisions
have been assigned to the charge of local r.p- |
resentatives as follows: Soutn 'California, H.

geles; Arizona and New Mexico, W. L. Pin
ney, Phoenix, Ariz.; Washington. E. G. Dorr,
postoffice box 143,5, Tacoma. Other appoint
ments will be announced as made.
The attention of racing men is directed to
the bulletin issued by Chairman Gideon under
dale of the 19th inst., and especially to the
warning that men competing as amateurs
under false pretenses will, when detected, be
punished not alone by transfer to tJie profes- j
fiional clacs but by suspension from the track. I
There is no intention oi using the professional
class as r. penal colony for unworthy men.
Under the direction and control of the league
it is intended that the racing man who
desires to derive an income from his
eflorts on the track shnl! deserve the
confidence of the public and be protected
in his relations with his fellow - riders
and race-meet promoters, t'nworthy men in
either class will be punished by exclusion
from the track for a period commeilsurate with
the offense committed.
Race-meet promoters are reminded that the
prizes in eÂ»ch event must be specified on the
programme. Amateurs must accent the prizes
so specified and nothing else. The exchanging
and bartering of prizes or the accepting of

Since the New York World saw fit to

The Alameda Cyclers will'have a try-out

Inferior tubing in a bicycle is the worst
of ooustrdbtive faults. No matter how tine
the enamel which may cover it and the
superior luster it possesses, the inherent,
weakness of the frame presents an element
of danger, atul the manufacturer who uses
tubing of this character is criminally neg
ligent. The worst phase of it all is the
policy of deception which floods the mar
ket with bicycles of inferior character
under the guise of "high-grade wheels."
This season, owing to the difficulty of
securing high-grade tuDing, buyers of
wheels cannot exercise too much care. It
is not safe under existing conditions to
choose hastily from the large number of
new makes daily making their appearance
on the market because the}' look nice on
the surface.
Bloomers are rapidly passing into a de
cadence, from all we can judge by a pe
rusal of the Eastern cycling press reports.
Last year there were bright prospects for
this style of garment, and the costume
was accepted with general favor. But
when a certain class of women adopted the
apparel and misused it, the strong-minded
women all over the land discarded it at
once. Now a compromise has been made
on the bloomers ana short skirt. This
costume will be very generally adopted
the coming season. It is neat and emi
nently respectable. It has been asked
whether this suit will be practicable on a
diamond-framed wheel or tandem. As
bloomers will be worn the same as hereto
fore, and the skirt over them will be short
and of very light material, it will be quite
feasible to wear the co&tunie on a man's
wheel. Ladies who have ridden men s
wheels would not care to go back to the
drop-framed style of ticycle again, and
there is no reason why they should, as the
skirt they are now asksd to wear will be
only the length of the bloomers and is
really only intended for appearance sake
when off the wheel.
Physicians' certificates relating to the
merits of new patterns of bicycle saddles
in the majority of instances are far from
oeiug infallible, and should be accepted
with the greatest caution by intending
purchasers. Doctors oiten judge a saddles
merits upon its theoretical basis, without
witnessing the results of practical tests or
making the tests themselves. Softness
and elasticity are by no means the prime
requisites of saddle construction, and
where these features are pronounced the
saddles possessing them have proven use
[ less when the rider is called upon to do
I even an ordinary amount of riding. â¢
A fifty-mile ride will best test the vir
tues of a saddle, and how many of the new
! freaks which are marketed under the
name of saddles will stand the test to the
satisfaction of the rider? A firm seat is
1 tne essential ttiing for easy riding, and
! only by the use of a firm seat can a bicycle
be kept under proper control.
The saddles last year furnished with the
| standard makes of wheels were of leather
; top, firm and durable, elastic enough for
the purposes desired, and purchasers of
1895 bicycles of that character had no
cause for complaint. It will be wisdom to
| select the same class of saddle this year, as
freaks are destined to have a brief and in
glorious career.
J. N. Brittain, the well-known wheel

Most of the leadine colleges of the coun

cycling is the favorite sport and is en

wise move for Stanford or the University
of California to hold such a tourney.
The San Francisco Koad Club will hold

relay team be decided upon, other reports
to tne contrary notwithstanding.
The Fowler sextet has been taken to
Portland by John Plows, who has it in

return here with it before going East, as
Mr. Plows is trying to secure an all-Cali

cuit, and arrangements are now being
made with several of the noted local rid
ers. There will probably be four or five
men on the team, all or whom must be
extremely fast. Mr. Plows knows the ma

The Bay City Wheelmen is not a body

no good-luck fetich or other symbol of for
tune around the ciubhouse. * But one of
the members claims to have had a premo
nition that the club was going to win the
coining relay race and he is willing to bank
on the reliability of his information. It
seems he attended one of the spiritualistic
sessions of Anna Eva Fay tne other even
ing. When she made the customary re
quest for questions from the audience
upon pieces of paper he sent up the query,
"What club will win the 100-mile relay
race next month?" What was his sur
prise and delight to hear the answer, later
on, "Some one in the audience wants to
know what club will win a certain bicvele
race; it will be won by the Bay City
Wheelmen." From the assurance of Pres
ident Kerrigan and Captain Plummer ever
since I am half inclined to think they De
lieve it will be so, but, nevertheless, they
will hold their try-out to-morrow at San
Leandro.

name implies, it is a hook of condensed
records, vest-pocket size, and also contains
half-tone ciits of the leading record

THE ANGLER.
Streams to Be Fished Next Week.
Ready for the Opening: Day.
If thou art worn ana hard beset
With sorrows that thou wouldat forget,
If thou wouldst read a lesson, that will Keep
Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from .sleep,
Go to the woods and hills! No tears
Dim the sweet look that nature wears.
.LONGFELLOW.
"The rod, the rod ! A kingdom for a rod
worth having."
It was that thorough and enthusiastic
disciple of angling, James Watt Esq., who
thusly addressed Henry Skinner, the
champion long-distance tfy-caster of the
Pacific Slope, yesterday afternoon at the
laiter's place of business on Market street.
While the twain were engaged in con
versation relative to trout streams and
trout fishing, and especially the new spoon
recently invented by Scott Watt, which ia
guaranteed to land successfully a 10-inch
fish when artistically handled, in walked
Fish Commissioner Emeriti with his care
fully waxed imperial. He was accom
panied by Mr. Mansfield, Mertiano Allen,
Albertano Cumming, and a few other dis
tinguished members of the Fly-casters'
Association.
The conversation on flycasting, trout
streams, small fish, spoons and flies and
the prospects for big baskets of lish on the
opening day of the season. April 1, waxed
very warm while the authorities on every
thing that pertained to fish scales and
fingerlings were in action, so to speak.
After much discussion on weather and
wate- and long distance castingâa science
by the way that must be thoroughly
mastered by an angler before he can suc
cessfully whip any of the "large" coast
streams that empty into the oceanâ the
anglers agreed tna"t there would be first
class flyfishing in April, provided the rain
king would keep the floodgates closed. So
much for the prospects of good angling on
the first days of the open season of 1896.
Trout fishing is at any rate a most fas
cinating pastime. If the sport consisted
solely in the capture of fish the majority
of anglers would quickly tire of it, but
fortunately there are greater pleasures in
angling than the killing of fish, otherwise
it would be far cheaper and less laborious
to tramp to the nearest market and catch
your fish with silver hooks.
True anglers never grow tired of the pas
time, and generally speaking they delight
in reading any instructive and entertain
ing matter that relers to the gentle and
quiet pastime.
Those who have read Derm Swift's book
on salmon-fishing can readily understand
the underlying current of sentiment that
stirs the anglers' soul when there is a ref
erence made to trout streams and salmon
rivers.
Somehow there seems to be a free
masonry about angling that will cause
strangers who meet on the banks of a
mountain stream to feel like brothers with
in fifteen minutes after they have dis
cussed the merits of some of the most
popular and extensively used flies.
When the season for trout fishing ap
proaches one of the greatest pleasures
enjoyed by anglers is in chatting over the
prospects for the inaugural outing, and
the expectation of once again hearing that
dear old lullaby of the mountain creeks,
, which is and always will be the sweetest
j of music to the true angler's ear.
As the season . advances and the first
I signs of spring appear preparations for
excursions that have been planned and
talked of for weeks begin in earnest. The
tackle is overhauled, rods are varnished,
reels oiled thoroughly, and fly book re
filled. ,^
What a pleasure it really is : after the
weary winter months of waiting to stand
at last on the bank of a favorite trout
stream, " threading the : line anxiously
through the j rings of an , eight-foot) rod,
.while overhead the woodrobin is singing
the .' same old . song it , sang the, previous
spring and the sunbeams flitter through
the delicate green foliage flecking the rip
ples of the water over which you intend to
wet your first cast,' with a beautiful golden
hue. r
Judging from the long spells : of dry
weather that have been experienced this
winter, it would be somewhat hazardous
to predict what the first week or two of the
season will bring. v ;
According to the predictions of some of
the old weather prognosticators, who pro
fess to know all about our s beautiful ; cli
mate and * its ? lightning changes, we will
have heavy rains in April. â¢
; At any rate the, present appearance; of
the weather does not justify the statement
that old Jupiter intends to shut ; off the ;
sluice box of 1896 until he has had an op
portunity t [ of ? putting a damper on the
baskets of some of *. those overzealous
anglers who will be out on the first days of
the ; season regardless of wind or weather
conditions.;
According to reports , recently , gleaned
from the country, the sport of trout-catch
ing should be good in April, but the rise
in the rivers, owing to the late rains, may 4
upset the: calculations of those who are
positioned to foretell. ;
,"â¢:': It 5 can i be ' taken 'â  for granted, however,
that if the fishing next week is not as gooa
as a large majority of { the anglers expect,
those Â; who '?; avail of ?: the opportunity ;of
wading s f through cold '( mountain streams
can rest assured *. that Mf' they ; fail to fill
their baskets with fish, 'â¢ they /will ! return to
their homes ? thoroughly invigorated and
with % appetites \ that : will % astonish / their
good wivesâ that is if â¢ they should be so
lortunate as to be members of the family

The trout streams in the vicinity of
Highland Springs, Lake County, will be
fished extensively this year as good re
ports have been received from anglers who
reside near the springs.
McMath of Hullville, Lake County,
writes that excellent trout-fishing will be
had this year in Soda and Salmon creeks,
as steelheads had access to those waters
during the past winter and several of them
remained over.
William Fuber of Pieta writes that the
dam in Pieta Creek still remains, but that
the basket which prevented a large num
ber of fish from ascending the stream has
been removed
Should the weather remain fine during
the next week the Paper-mill and Laguni
tas creeks should be in pretty fair order
for tisuing by Sunday, April 5. The late
rains have discolored these streams and
the refuse stuff from the hills will supply
the little finny inhabitants of the creeks
with food of all kinds. According to the
following letter received from Joseph F.
Bertrand of Tocaloma, the prospects for
good sport when the Paper-mill Creek
resumes its normal appearance is first
class. His letter reads:
Sporting Editor Call: The present outlook
for the opening of the trout season on the
Paper-mill Creek offers a more favorable oppor
tunity for a "good run" of steelheads and large
trout than has been known to anglers for many
years past.
The recent rains have so raised the stream
that the late run of steelheads has made good
headway in reaching the far end of the head
waters. By the Ist of April it is presumed that
they will be ready to make good the return trip
by slow stages. Should the weather remain
passive the state of the water will be in a splen
did condition for excellent fishing.
Since the closing of the paper-mill at Taylor
ville, which is now over two years, the water of
the stream has become free from all those
poisonous ingredients that were so injurious to
small fry, and together with the clearing away
of the old dam, that was such an obstruction to
the free access of incoming runs for the upper
waters, the little fingcrlets have now fairly
doubled their growth under the thriving nutri
ment peculiar to these waters.
Joseph F. Bertrand.
Tocaloma, Cal., March 24, 1896.
There can be no gainsaying the fact that
during the months of April and May the
streams which invariably give the best re
sults are within easy reach of stations on
the San Francisco and North Pacific Coast
Railroad, which line taps all the tribu
taries of the Russian River.
THE GUN.
Inanimate Target and Live Bird
Shoots to Be Held To-morrow.
The Olympic, Empire and Lincoln gun
clubs will meet to-morrow at the Oakland

John R. Carroll of the Olympic Club
will give a second shoot on Sunday to his
friends at Mountain View. Forty dozen
live birds have been secured.
On Sunday the San Joaquin Valley Gun
Club will hold an inanimate target shoot
at Stockton, unknown traps and angles.
The shoot is open only to residents of San
Joaquin County.
Commencing on April 10 the California
State Sportsmen's Association will hold its

several interesting items concerning trap
shooting and angling.
The inaugural excursion and picnic of
the Sportsmen's Protective Association
will be held at Schuetzen Park, San Ra
fael, on April 12. The president of the as
sociation says that tickets are selling like
hot cakes and that a good time is guaran
teed to all who will attend.
A New "York paper says:
The performance of Rolla 0. Heikes in break
ing 100 bluerock targets with Winchester re
peating shoteuns in 5 minutes 35J<j seconds
was considered wonderful. This he did at the
tournament of the Kentucky Gun Club in
Louisville on Washington's birthday. The
time taken was so brief that it seems impossi
ble that he could beat that record by a minute
and a quarter, but this he did February 26 on
the ground." of the Limited dun Club in In
dianapoli", Ind. He broke 100 targets out of
12*2 shot at, but the number of misses WB.Â« in
creased by some bungling on the part of the
assistants in loading. Out of the first 25 he
broke 21: the time was 1 minute. In the sec
ond 25 he missed 3. broke til out of 75, and 83
out of 100, and still had a fraction of time left
before the expiration of 4 minutes. He scored
100 out ol 122 shot at in 4 minutes 20 seconds.
The guns used were Winchester repeating
shotguns, live in number. After giving an ex
hibition of fancy shooting, in which pairs, four
and six bluerocks were broken when all â were
thrown into the nir at one time, Mr. Heikes
broke 124 out ol 125 bluerocks shot at.
THE OARSMEN.
Enthusiastic Members of the South
End Clubâ Races, Etc.
If all the boat clubs about the bay had
the interest of rowing at heart that the
South End Boat Club of this City possess
it is safe to predict that boatracing on this
coast would ever be to the fore making a
strong bid for public appreciation.
It will be remembered about a year ago
a regatta was held at El Campo under the
auspices of the South End Club. It was
the tirst regatta of any note held on the
bay for almost a decade and was a pro
nounced success.
At the time the club gave the regatta it
was in debt and raised $500 by popular
subscription to carry the affair turough,
but had It proved a failure the South End
Boat Club would iiave been a thing of the
past and its boathouse and boats sacriliced
to pay the expense iacurrea.
But with such energetic members as
Johnny Herget, Billy Ackerson, Alfred
Fritz and William F. Humphreys, presi
dent of the P. A. A., in the club, success
is assured.
It was mainly through the South Ends'
endeavors that the Olympic Club became
interested in boating.
It has been noticed that when a
regatta is held here the South Ends arj
always represented, a fact which cannot
be said of the other clubs, and invariably
the South Ends carry off the honors of the
day, for defeat means disgrace to them,
"Win or die" being the motto of the club.
The oarsmen of the club who are to rep
resent California in the Northwest and
East are practicing daily and say as far as
the rowing end of the affair is concerned
that they will do their best to uphold it.
On the Sunday subsequent to the tirst
Tuesday of every month (be club will hold
a regatta. A sum of money will be put up,
which, together with the entrance fee paid
by each oarsman, will be expended in the
purchase of suitable prizes.
The Arifcis and Dolphins are working
hard to advance the interest ot the sport.
The Ariels will begin next Sunday with
their system of try-out races, as already
published, and the Dolphins have two ex
cellent crews in training for the coming
Ei Campo and Stockton regattas.
W. A. McGrill is organizing a four-oared
crew over at Elmhurst, Alameda County.
At present the boys take their practice in
a large skiff, going two and a half miles
down the bay to row.
When the Elmhurst Athletic Club is
organized they will join the Pacific
Athletic Association and row in all re
gattas. The members of the crew will
probably be: Jess Swalley, stroke; Billy
Barks, afterwaist; William Carter, for
wardwaist; M. Moran, bow; and Louis
Stehm, coxswain. It is the crew's inten
tion to purchase a racing barge as soon as
convenient.
The crew composed of T, F. Barry, b.ow;
H. Smith, iorwardwaist: Dave Cam bell,
afterwaist; George Bates, stroke; and
Tommy Guilfeather, coxswain; who made
such a good showing against the South
Ends' big crew last Sunday, have chal
lenged their victors to a return match.

Long Bridge course.
Arrangements for tbe South Ends' re
ception, to be held at Native Sons' Hall,

programme will be announced during the
coming week. The committee of arrange
ments consists of J. E. Scully. J. D. \ta

O'Brien and Al Fritz.
Precedine the South Ends' reception. will

Mr. Berry of the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation is the recipient of a letter from the
Pacific Northwestern Association in re
gard to the arrangement for holding the
championship games and regattas, but
nothing definite has been arranged as yet.
ATHLETIC.
Wrestling at the Olympic Club.
Boxers and Swimmers.
The Olympic Clubs wrestling tourna
ment will be held on Monday evening in
the gymnasium. The entries for the
events closed hist evening. Professor
Meihling, the instructor, says that the
contests which will be witnessed on Mon
day evening will prove more interesting
than anything in the line of wrestling that
has taken piace in the club for many
moons, as there are several high-class
men among the entrants.
The first of a series of sprints and long
distance races which have been arranged
by Captain Gill, will be held at the Olym
pic athletic grounds ou Sunday, April 5.
E'lgreu, the crack hammer- thrower and
weight-putter of the University Club, is
authority for the statement that Berkeley
will .-end a team to the East this year that
i_e the cobwebs from the eyes of
ro college boys, who have been under
the impression that the wild men of the
Vest could not raise anything better than
pumpkin* and "sich."
'Â« c will Biraply clean up the dust with
thosa Eastern chaps this year," remarked
Edgren with a setting sun smile.
Ihe Larline Swimming Club will give
an excellent exhibition of swimming and
polo playing on Thursday evening next.
* 'ne of the principal features of the even
ing will be a polo match between two well
drilled teams.
The Olympic Club propose to select
only the very best talent from among the
army of boxers for its special boxing night
at the Pavilion. Try outs will be held on
Monday evening, when the good will be
segregated from the bad. The bouts will
be worth seeing.
HANDBALL.
Amateur and Professional Games
Slated for To-Morrow.
It was expected at the last meeting of
the Olympic Club directors that the pro
posed new handball court controversy
would be settled.
The energetic and enterprising director,
B. E. Short, stated he had collected $1000
from members who are interested in the
new enterprise, but the president, Mr-
Eaton, stated that no action could be taken
in the matter until the club had held an
other meeting with the owner of the prop
erty on which the proposed court is to ba
erected. There is evidently some hitch in
the agreement entered into between the
club and the property-owner in Question
and if matters be satisfactorily ad
iusted before the next meeting of the
board, which will be on Wednesday even
ing next, the future of the new handball
court will be made known.
The managers of the courts on Howard
street have prepared the following pro
gramme of games for to-morrow:
At Phil Ryan's court â W. Manion and
M. McNeil will play P. Ryan and G.Me-
Donald, M. Edwards and J. Collins to play
R. Murphy and W. Stansbury, P. Kelly
and J. siattery to play P. Kutchinson and
J. Nelson, AlPeunoyer and J. McEvelley
to play J. Lawless "and D. Connolly; P.
Donnelly, the amateur champion, and G.
Hutchinson to play J. Harlow, the coast
champion, and W. Williams.
At Alc-Manus' court the principal event
of the day will be a match berween T. J .
Bonnet and James C. Nealon against J. J.
Feeney and R. Lenihan. Tnis match
should prove very interesting.
THE RIFLE.
California Schuetzen Club Spring
Festival at San Rafaei.
One of â if not the principal â event of the
season will be the great spring- rirle
shooting festival of the California Schuet
zen Club at San Rafael Park.
Over ninety prizes have been received by
the secretary of the club for the honorary
target contest, wh;:h promises to eclipse
in the way of remarkable scores anything
that lias heretofore been attempted.
T'lere will be no end to the noise of crack
ing rifles and the smell of burned powder.
In the language of Billy Jordan, the
famous master of ceremonies of prize
â¡gbt;-, it will be the event of the season.
The total amount of prizes which will be
shot for on this auspicious occasion
amounts to $1500.
F. Schuman, the proprieor of the park,
is arranging an excellent programme of
games, etc., for Sunday, April 5, in con
junction with the great shooting festival.
Itifle-shooters from all parts of the State
will be present.
The following item recently appeared in
the Banffshire Journal, a Scotch paper,
concerning some wonderful shooting:
Mr. Edward Charles Russell Ross, who won
the first Queen's prize at Wimbledon in 1860,
â when he was only 19 years of age, and who
afterward became one of the most cele
hrated deer-sialkers of his time, died on the Ist
inst. at North Berwick. He was 55 years of
nge. His great skill as a pisiol shot may be
gathered when it is mentioned that one occa
sion, for a bet, he brought down nineteen out
of twenty-one swallows on the wing, and on
another occasion entertained an Austrian visi
tor, Prince Esterhazy, by hitting butterflies
fluttering in his garden.
SACRAMENTO SPORTIN
Kimble and Upson Trap-Shooting
Tournamentâ Reel and Rod.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 27.â The
roadrace of the Capitol City Wheelmen
has been postponed indefinitely, owing to
the fact that the roads are too heavy to at
tempt to maKe time over. The next thing
of importance in wheeling circles will be
the roadrace between the Stockton and
Sacramento clubs, for which event relays
have already been established.
April 1 will usher in one of the most
successful fishing seasons vhich have ever
been known on the Sierra slope, so say all
the old-time knights of the rod and gun
â who for years have frequented the moun
tain streams in search of the "speckled
beautie?," and many are already making
preparations for a trip to the hills, as the
season will open early owing to the fact
that there is but little snow in the moun
tains this year in comparison with former
years, and the streams will run down
rapidly.
L. U. Upson, who has just returned
from a business trip, reports that ttie
Grass Valley sportsmen are mak'ng ex
tensive preparations for the opening of
the fishing teason in Nevada County, and
are expecting great sport.
The Supervisors of Placer County have
extended the close season until June 1.
B.- this time the spawning season is over
and the streams will not be depopulated
so speedily. Parties who have been in
the vicinity of the Rubicon and Truckee
rivers report that trout are more plentiful
than they have been in yeans. Salmon
are being taken in large quantities beiow
Rio Vista, on the Sacramento River, but
very few are being caught above this
point. Striped bass are more than plenti
ful and are increasing rapidly. Game
Warden Helms has charge of the stocking i
of a chain of lakes a few miles below this
city with black bass, and as they will be
preserved iocal wielders of the rod are
looking forward to good sport in the
future. This energetic official has put an
entire stop to the sale of speared trout in
this city by the Indians. Finding that
they do not come within the pale of the ,
the lair he notified all, through the
medium of the press, that he would
prosecute auy person whom he found
purchasing trout from the Indians.
Then ha watched the trains, and
whenever the nomads brought in
trout he followed them around and
warned any one attempting to purchase
them. As this ruined the demand, tne
Indians have stopped bringing the slaugh
tered fish to market, but during former
years thousands of pounds of speared
trout have found a ready sale in this city.
Helms declares that it will no longer be
permitted. He also stated that there are
larger quantities of duck and quail breed
ing this year than has ever been known in
tnis vicinity before.
Fish Commissioner Morrison, who has
I just , returned from a trio to the Scott
! River district, in Siskiyou County, declares
that to be the Mecca of sportsmen, al
though as he states the game laws are
totally disregarded; still all kinds of game
and fish are so plentiful that no diminish
ment is perceptible. Steelheads are being
taken in that vicinity in larger quantities
tnan ever before known.
Doves are reported to be making their
appearance in large numbers, and many
pairs are already nesting. The Grass
Valley Gun Club is issuing invitations to
I sportsmen turougnout the State to attend
a bluerock tournament which will be
given under its auspices within the next
month.
The Ximble and Upson opening shoot
will take place next Sunday. No entries
will be made until the meeting at the
grounds, but Woodland, Wneatland,
Stockton. Marysville, Oroyille, San Fran
cisco and Oakland clubs will all have rep
resentatives present. The Spoonbill Club
meet will take place the first Sunday in
April at the Eckhardt shooting grounds at
Agricultural Park. As yet the list of
prizes has not been announced. The Swiss
and Sacramento rifle clubs have consoli
dated and will tackle the butts every Sun
day.
That enthusiastic sportenaan, W. E.
Gerber, has procured twelve pairs of Mon
golian pheasants from Eugene. Or., and
has placed them on his rancn on Paynes
Creek, in Tehama County. If the birds
I propagate he will introduce them through
j various portions of Sacramento County.
I He has a crack place to raise the birds, as
I his ranch lies in a valley between high
mountains, and with but few shotguns in
I the vicinity. Kutherfoed.

to have many a pleasant cruise in her this

The Olympic Club's wrestling tourna
ment will be held on Tuesday evening, the

MANSLAUGHTER IS CHARGED-
Daniel Dunn Held to Answer for the
Killing: of C. A. Maria.
The preiirninary hearing of the strikers,
Daniel Dunn, James Hoirnes, William
Potee, John Drugan, Michael Shine and
William J. Dowiing, charged with murder
ing Charles A. Marrs, took place before
Judge Low yesterday. Dunn was held to
answer to a charge of manslaughter in the
sum of $5000, the other five being dis
missed.
While there was abundant evidence to
show the presence on the scene of all tbe
men charged with the murder, there was
nothing to connect any of them directly
with the act except in the case of Dunn.
Several witnesses swore to having seen the
latter strike the deceased several times
with his fist.
The case against Henry Rothgang,
charged with participating in the same
crime but who had asked for a separate
hearing, was also dismissed. There is
still a battery charge resting against him,
but that will probably be withdrawn also.
Dunn furnished bail and was released at
10 o'clock last night.

The judges officiating in the stand at

to 1. Realization opened an Bto 5 favor
ite, receding in the bettine to threes. He
failed to run into a place, and the judges,
thinking him capable of making a better
showing, called his rider, Eddie Jones,
and the owners of the horse, Hoag and
little, into the stand. Jones explained in
a manner that was satisfactory that he
was badly interfered with soon after
the start, being compelled to pull up to
avoid being thrown, and Charles Little,
one of the owners of the sprinter, produced
a ticket showing that be had backed tha
horse to the extent of his capital. The
track, which was heavy, was exactly to
Perhaps' liking, and as the bookmakers'
sheets showed nothing of a suspicious
character bets were paid as the horses had
finished. Easel, aloto 1 chance, captured
the place from Faro. The decision gave
general satisfaction.
The overnight cards announced Magnet
and Libertine as starters in a condition
event, but their presence caused all of the
other'entries to scratch, and general disap
pointment was expressed among the
crowd. Two favorites were all that cap
tured purses. . '
Dodd's uncertain horse, Mt. Air, had
slight call for favoritism donors in the
opening six-furlong run, but he was
j afflicted with a loss of staying powers and
tramped in among the "also rans."
Road Runner, with Shaw up, was always
in front, and won easily from Charles A,
another outsider.
The seven-furlong event for mares
proved rather an easy thing for O. Ap
pleby's Flirtilla. backed down from evens
to 3to 5. She made all of the running
and won handily from All Smoke, the sec
ond choice.
A "sleeper" was unearthed in the two
year-old four-furlong spin. Lena, an 8 to
1 shot, showed in the lead soon after the
barrier was raised, passing the wire an
ea^y winner, with the 2 to 5 choice Koselle
finishing in the place.
As usual the favorite was beaten again
in the seven furlongs decided over the in
side course. Tonino was figured a good
thing on his easy victory of Wednesday,
the talent backing him at odds of 8 to 5.
Decision, the second choice, always had
the lead on him and looked a winner up to
the last furlong, when Iko L came with a
rush and took the race by half a length.
Tonino was a poor third.
With but eighty-four pounds on her
hack, Sallie Clicquot, the 7 to 10 choice in
the last race, a seven-furlong condition
race, experienced no difficulty whateverin
disposing of George Miller, who was well
supported at 8 to 5, defeating him with the
greatest ease by fully eight lengths.
CONTRACTORS ARE LIABLE
Commissioner Fitzgerald Says
That They Defraud the
Laborer.
OVER $75,000 OWING HIM.
Proposed Bill to Be Introduced at
the Next Session of the
Legislature.
If Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald car
ries out bis present intentions, and tbose
who know him best do not doubt the
tenacity of his purpose, a bombshell will
be exploded in the camp of a large num
ber of prominent contractors within the
next few days.
Mr. Fitzgerald has the uamÂ«s of well
known contractors in his possession wbo
owe over $75,000 to laborers in the various
trades. His acquaintance with the labor
element of the City and State and his
knowledge of certain conditions which
prevail long eince convinced him of the
necessity of some legislative action. That
action would take the form of a law pre
venting any contractor who owes money
for labor performed from taking a contract
for public work until his former laborers
have been paid in full.
But it will be some time before the
meeting of the next Legislature, and in
the meantime Commissioner Fitzgerald
has made up his rcind to move on the
recreant contractors in the interests of the
laboring men who have been deprived of
their honest earnings.
"I have the name's of all these contract
ors who owe this $75,000 and more, and if
after due warning they refuse to pay the
wages of their former employes I shall
have them published. Suits will also be
brought against them on behalf of the
men who have been kept out of their
money.
"As an instance of the manner in which
some of these contractors would treat their
labor creditors I reed mention only a
single case. Bowers, who has the con
tract for tearing down the old American
Exchange Hotelon Sansome street, when
questioned by me with regard to the pay
ment of certain back wages, calmly and
impudently told me to perigrinate to that
region where fur-lined topcoats are a not
able superrluity. He further informed me
that if I tried to interfere with him or
his work he would punch my head.
"It was a great bluff on his part, for
when the interference occurred be went to
the City Hftll with me and made provi
sions for paying his men. This is merely
an isolated case quoted for illustration,
and there are many others.
"I am convinced that there should be a
legislative enactment. We can make the
contractor do what is right with a great
deal of trouble and needless bother, but if
there was a law on the statute-books the
laborer would get his due and without the
need of a lot of legal formulie. No con
tractor should be allowed to accept a con
tract for public works who owes a cent for
prior labor. The laboring men in the sev
eral trades are amply protected in their
work on private contracts, and this bill
which I shall have brought up in the next
Legislature will refer only to tmbiic works.
"I think it will be advisable to incor
porate a clause providing for the appoint
ment of an attorney to prosecute all cases
under the new statute for a moderate com
pensation. There are many able and
reputable attorneys here who, with their
regular practice, could afford to take such
an office for $600 or $709 a year.
"And, again, the majority of the con
tractors are with me in the move. They
freely admit that such a law would be in
the interest of honest labor. As long as
men who dodge the payment of a large
percentage of their labor bills are permu
ted to compete with the contractors wnose
conduct is governed by a different code of
morals there will be suffering on all hands.
Cheaper work will be done, wages will be
kept down and the worker for wages will
have trouble in getting his earnings, if he
gets them at all.
"A very prominent builder came to me
the other day and waxed enthusiastic in
his indorsement of my purpose to have a
bill passed at the next session of the Leg
islature. 'Yes,' he said, 'push it for all it ia
worth; we will furnish the money.' I
told him I did not need any money to
push such a bill. Neither do we. All we
ask is protection to the workingmen.
Think of it! Over $75,000 owing to the
laboring men of this City, and most of
them of the skilled class.
"This bureau has saved thousands of dol
lars for the laboring men so far, and the
figures will multiply before we finish."
FEE BILL OF 1895.
Sheriff Whelan Obeying the law in All
Its Provisions .Except as to Keepers.
Horace D. Dunn, the expert of the Grand
Jury, is still working in the office of the
Recorder. He has not officially visited
the Sheriff's office. Sheriff Whelan says
that every facility will be extended to t&e
expert whenever the latter is ready to begin
his investigation.
in regard to the new law known as the
fee bill of 1895, Sheriff Whelan yesterday
said: "There is a misapprehensioii about
the law and its relation to the Sheriff's of
fice. lam not ignoring the law, but am
not following that particular provision of
the act relating to the payment of $2 a day
for keepers. The provisions of the law,
however, which relate to the payment of
fees into the treasury, are respected and
followed.
"As the case i 3 on briefs before the Su
preme Court, I have been advised, for the
protection of myself and bondsmen, to fol
low the old law in relation to attachments
until the court points out some way to
compensate keepers under the new law."
"You will see by reading ihe new law,"
continued Sneriff Whelan, "that it pro
vides that keepers shall receive no greater
sum than $2 per day, but it does not say
who shall pay the money. No provision
is made for collecting the money from the
party attaching the goods, and neither
does it say that the Auditor and Treasurer
shall make the payment. Under the old
law, I can release the attachment if fees of
the keeper are not paid, but here another
proposition is presented. lam simply
waiting for the Supreme Court to interpret
the new law." _
City of Oakland Enjoined.
The London and San Francisco Bank has en
joined the city of Oakland from opening up
Fallon street, on the ground that it is not a

plainants. The case will be heard in the United
States Circuit Court cm April tt.
BANK PRESIDENT BEALS.
The Great Financier Found Health in
Paine's Celery Compound.
v/ * â  cÂ£Z* â ._. /**--â¢" :â â â ââ¢â  . â  Â.;
Prominent among the New England men
whose brains and energy have helped to
make the Western States rich and power-
ful is General David T. Beals, president of
the Union National Bank of Kansas City.
Successful in his many enterprises, he lives
to-day in a fine mansion at the corner of
Independence and Wabash avenues.
The work and the resDonsibility incum-
bent on the president of so important a
banking institution as the Union National
would endanger the sturdiest health.
General Beals' clear-headedness and good
sense were as manifest in the choice of a
remedy as in bis business enterprises. He
strenfthened his tired nervous system by
the use of Paine's celery compound. Its
invigorating, health-giving effects justified
bis expectations, and showed in his own
case the remarkable power of this much-
discussed remedy for thoroughly reEtoring
and strengthening the "run-down" system.
"I found Paine's celery compound an
agreeable tonic and soothing to the nerves, "
says General Beals.
These are the concise words of commen-
dation characteristic of the conservative
business man and the influential banker,
who has learned well to weigh his words.
The scanty sunlight, and the stagnant,
used-up air of living rooms during the
winter, reduce the strength and nervoii3
ARE GROWING NO BETTER
Socialistic View of the Work
in gman's Condi
tions.
Professor John Monteith Attacks the
Deductions of a King's College
Â» Economical Authority.
Professor John Monteith addressed the
weekly meeting of the Society of American
Socialists last evening. The speaker's re
marks were directed mainly to disproving
the assertions of Professor Leon Levy, the
head of the department of economics of
King's College, London, that the laboring
classes of England had obtained their full
share of the prosperity which the nation
had enjoyed. Professor Levy's deductions
were based upon statistics compiled from
the income tax reports. These, Professor
Monteith argued, were, for many reasons,
misleading and inaccurate. Chief amone
the faults of the statistics, he pointed out,
was the fact that only those whose incomes
wÂ«Â»re derived from trades and professions
were included, leaving out the class that
the people were most interested in, the
multi-millionaires, whose incomes were
derived from possessions in every part of
the globe. These people, he maintained,
upon authority of leading economists, had
practiced such comprehensive fraud in
making out their income returns that no
adequate idea could be gained of their
wealth.
"Figures are not facts," said the profes
sor, "only the signs of facts. The dif
ficulty of them is that many people have a
superstitious belief that anything quoted
in figures must be true. The increase of
the averaee income or the average wealth
tells nothing about the average distribu
tion of either. Averages are for almost
every purpose. If another man and I,
both on the verge of starvation, are walk
ing down the street and some one eives
him a loaf of bread, the average of each of
ua is half a loaf, but he gets it all."
The speaker then showed by what; he
claimed reliable statistics that half the
families in England to-day have no accu
mulated property. According to General
Booth, in London 10 per cent of a popula
tion of 38,000,000 are idle, and other econ
omists have placed the number nearly as
high.
In spite of this dismal showing for Eng
land the professor scouted the idea which
he declared politicians would in a few
months be declaiming from the rostrum,
that the working classes of the United
States were immeasurably belter situated
than their fellows across the water. In
answer to questions by members of the so
ciety he stated that socialismâ liberal in
that it is comprehensive and radical from
the fact that it contemplates a complete
revolution of existing social institutions â
was the only logical remedy.
Next Friday evening the society will
discuss the new city charter.
LABOR IN THE SOUTH.
Los Angeles Trades Unionists Are In
.' Favor :of Having a Resident
Commissioner.
Friends of : organized labor in Los Ange
les, are apparently desirous of having a
resident - Deputy Labor Commissioner in
the southern metropolis. â¢ Complaints .'are
being made by several of the unions that
the workmen in Los Angeles are not being
treated quite fairly. Apropos of p. this
strained condition there has been consid
erable correspondence between the State
.Labor Bureau and several of ; the trades
union ; officers of ;-â  Los -Angeles, " the last
letter. 4 received being: the following from
President Phillis of the Los Angeles
Typographical Union 6, which arrived
yesterday :
" Los Akgkies, March 25, 1896.

energy, especially of persons employed
constantly indoors. The needâ the abso-
lute necessityâ of a genuine invigorator at
this spring season has impressed itself on
the attention of all thinking people.
In the famous laboratory of Dartmouth
Medical School. Prof. Edward E. Pbelps,
M.D., LL.D., discoveied the formula of
Paine's celery compound, a remedy that
has become the standard nerve restorer,
blood purifier, and strenethener from one
end of the country to the other, a prepa-
ration that stands unrivaled as the medi-
cine that makes people well.
It is a fact much commented upon that
men and women of national reputation
and prominence, like Gen. Beals, State
Treasf Colvin of New York, Mr. Carlisle's
private secretary, Mayor McShane of Mon-
treal Rev. Fr. Oueliet, Com. Howell, ex-
Minister to Austria John M. Francis, and
a host of others who are careful what they
employ when eicK, and have the amplest
opportunities for finding out what is best,
have of their own accord sent letters de-
scribing fully their permanent recovery
from rheumatism, heart weakness, sleep-
lessness, debility, kidney troubles, and
diseases of the stomach and hver. In all
these cases Paine's celery compound was
the one remedy that was able to com-
pletely and permanently bring back health,
make"poor blood agaiu rich and pure, and
regulate and build up tne nervous system
when weakened and deranged.
Dear Sir: You may have noticed in the.
papers of the early part of the week that at
the labor conference held in this city last Sun
day a resolution was passed favoring the
giving of more power to the Commissioner of
Labor, and also the appointment of r deputy
in each city of the State having over 30,000
population. . â¢ .
Will you kindly send me a copy of the law
by which your office was established, and also
the amendments which have since been mader
There is a widespread feeling among intelli
gent labor leaders here that when we have a
commissioner who is so earnest and true to
labor's interests as you are believed to be, ha
should have all the help which we can give
As the originator of the movement which
brought this about, I hope to meet you aud
present to you some of the grievances of the
typographical union here. Respectfully yours,
3y s . Joseph Phillis.
Commissioner Fitzgerald intends paying
an official visit to Los Angeles in the near
future, during -which he will do all he can
to arrive at a correct understanding of the
exact condition of things. As for the
remedy, that may be more difficult to
obtain* and apply, owing to the limited
resources of the bureau. At all events Mr.
Fitzgerald promises to make a searching
investigation and apply what remedies he
may find at hand.
Europe produces on average about 55
per cent of the world's yearly wheat crop.
North America grows yeariy about a quar
ter of it; the United States more than 20
per cent of it.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V.. March 27.â Speculation at
the Stock Exchange continues quiet, the transac
tions to-day amounting to only 137,750 shares. At
the opening the market for stocks was weak and
lower, London having turned up as a seller. It is
estimated that the foreigners parted with nearly
10,000 shares of St. Paul. Louisville and Nash
ville and other issues with an international mar
ker. Local operators were disposed to sell moder
ately on rumors that there will be exports of gold
next week. It is understood that a Broad-street
commission firm which was quite a factor last
fall in the foreign exchange market bad received
at) order to forward 500,000 gold next week.
This could not be confirmed, and it was thought
thai if the Treasury Department shou'd make an
other call on tie depositor.- banks for a part of the
money he'd by them on bond account, or if the
premium for gold bars were again advanced, ship
ments of the metal will .be prevented. The early
decline ranged from Vi to 1 percent. .Sugar, the
Grangers, Louisville and Nashville, Chicago Gas,
Leather preferred, Manhattan and Pacific Mail
scored the 'atest losses. In the afternoon trad
in : Tobacco was the feature and rose from 83 Vis to
fe7Vj on vague rumors that the company will re
sume the payment of dividends next week, and
that the difficulties with the outside concerns had
been ad.v ued. â 
Baltimore and Ohio also met with better sup
port, and rose to 18%. Speculation closed firm.
Net changes were merely fractional ' except for
Louisville and Nashville, which declined y g . and
Baltimore and Ohio and Tobacco, wnich gained
13/g and 3/ g respectively.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 27.â Wheat was In- \
fluenced for weakness thi3 morning by the fine \
weather, and at the opening and for over one j
hour thereafter prices ruled lower than at the I
close yesterday. About 11 o'clock quite a little j
bulge occurred, the "short 1 sellers having Im
prudently got themselves into a position where
they were obliged to cover just at a time when :
1 offerings were scarce. Receipts in tie Northwest ;
; were fair, but not as heavy as they have ;
been running. They amounted to 392 cars, j
against 509 last Friday. and 337 a j
year ago. Chicago received 12 cars . and in- :
spected out 117,900 bushels." Incidental to the j
advance it was reported that the English Govern-
I ment had issued some important commands to the |
1 army.
Liverpool cables were quit and steady at i/id j
advance. Trade became quiet later, most of the ,
advance disappearing during the inactive period. |
| Closing Continental cables were lower. Export ;
I clearances were extremely light at 81,504 bushels.
i At the close the leeling was weak, ear.y buyers
becoming anxious sellers. May wheat opened i
from 831.4 cto 63i,4@633/ B e. sold between 63%@ ;
64c and U3c, closing at 63VsC bid, s /s c under yes- |
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow twelve j
cars.
CORNâ Was In its usual phlezmatic condition, j
responding in a moderate degree to the quicker |
action of wheat, bnt presenting nothing of really j
noteworthy interest. receipts were 261 cars, 26 j
more than expected. There was no corn taken
from store. Liverpool cables â¢ were easy at un
changed prices. Export clearances amounted to
251/2-22 bushels. May corn opened at 295/Â« c.
advanced to 2934@29%c. declined to and closed
at 29%e. a shade under yesterday. Estimated re- j
receipts for to-morrow, 350 cars. ,
OATSâ Were quiet, trading being moderate. At j
the opening prices were easy and lower, but later j
they showed some firmness and recovered the loss, \
bnt the close showed a decline. I Sympathy with
wheat was of course the governing power. Re
ceipts were 210 cars, and 9500 bushels were taken
from store. May closed VB@Vic lower. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 205 cars.
FLAX-Was easy. Cash, 89i4<a89Vic; May,
593/i@9oc; September, 92%@93c. Receipts 3*2
cars.
PROVISIONSâ Were afforded relief this morn
ing, the selling pressure being more moderate, and
the demand from "shorts" contributing strength
to prices. The run of hogs was light, and prices
I were up 5c at the yards. Naturally that affected
product favorably. May pork closed 7y 2 (3)10c
higher, May lard !2i/2<&sc higher, and May ribs 6@
7%c higher. â

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 27.â R. G. Dun &
Co. will say to-morrow in their weekly review of
trade: The returns of failures are somewhat dis
appointing. Several of magnitude were mentioned
a week ago, and they have swelled the aggregate
of defaulted liabilities for three weeks of Marcn to
$1 â¢2.363,614, against $11,271,121 last year. A
heavy failure in Texas will also swell the aggre
gate of returns for the past week, which includes
259 in the United States, against 234 last year,'
and 39 in Canada, against 42 last year.
No important change has occurred in the general
condition of business during the week, and if trade
in some respects looks worse, in other respects it
seems better. .
There have been somewhat less favorable fea
tures In the dry-goods market, but in iron and
steel conditions are slightly improved, and in
boots and shoes . considerably < more hopeful.
Foreign trade is a little more satisfactory. In gen
eral the course of domestic prices tends to favor
the marketing of staples abroad. ' Wheat has
gained about a point, but corn and cotton remain
unchanged. Cotton . had a . lively rise . with the
covering of short sellers, but began to decline
again a week ago, and has been lagging ever since.-
In the dry-goods market the last indications do
not warrant expectations that the mills will con
tinue full production throughout the season. The
demand for women's, dress goods the best feature
of the woolen . markets. The sales of wool have
fallen to less than half an ordinary week's full
consumption, amounting lust week to only 2,926,
--750 pounds at the chief markets. A striking fea
ture this week has been a sale of 350.000 â¢ pounds
of American wool for shipment to England.
The iron and steel markets have disclosed a
similar feature, fora little Alabama pig has been
sold for export. â¢ There has been a little more ac
tivity in steel this week and the Carnegie works
have sold 10,000 steel rails to Japan, but In the
main the market is about as Inactive and insuffi
cient as it has been. ' â¢
â  There has been no trading worth the name; in
railroad stocks during the past week and scarcely
any in the industrials so that fluctuations in prices
are scarcely worth noting. The earnings of the
railroads have been rather less promising than, in
previous months, averaging only 3.4 per cent bet
ter than last March thus far MM the tonnage from
Chicago, which has so long been much in excess of
previous years, has now fallen | short of the move
ment in 1893. Something is expected in stock ex
change circles from important negotiations which
Mr. Morgan is endeavoring to make abroad. -But
on the whole little is none at present and little ex
pected for . some time to come in the security
market. ' .- ; >:â <::-' ' , - < ; â  :

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been eight arrivals from the Coast
collieries with 14,329 tons of Coal, 6693 tons from
Australia. The light arrivals for several days have
served so deplete stocks in yard, at the same time
there is amplo here to satisfy all Immediate re
quirements. Another Coal disaster tooic place a
few days since, caused by the cargo of the bark
Alexandra catching fire; it Is a new grade of
Colonial Coal. There is another cargo of the same
grade now en route. A few months hence wo are
promised shipments of Corral Hollow Coal from
Livermore; it will then be ascertained for what
uses this character of fuel is best adapted. Latest
cabled quotations for Swansea Anthracite for
future shipment show a marked decline, the free
arrivals of tonnage there has caused a shrinkage
in Coal freights: there is also a softening of Co o
nial values for loading several months hence. It
is singular that shipowners should seek this port,
with the present ruling uuotations for grain
freights." Wfllincton $8 ft ton: New Welling

assorting old fillings on the sixth floor and saving
the bunches of pay in places lying to the west of
the old stope. In the south stope near the old
J'otosi shaft they are opening to the south on some
fair-grade ore and turning over the old fillings at
â  that point, from which they are able to save about
half as pay. On the 100 level the south drift from
west crosscut 2 has been stopped, the face remain
ing in low-grade materia'. They saved during the
past wees 54 tons and 800 pounds of ore, the aver

BOLD ROBBERY AT STEGE.
Three Masked Highwaymen Loot
the Safe at the Lonely
Station.
MADE A VERY SMALL HAUL.
Agent Thompson, Surprised While in
Bed, Is Ordered to Open the
Strong-Box.
Oakland Office San Frakci6co Call,)
90S Broadway, March 27. f
The little railroad depot at Stege station
was robbed this morning by three masked
men. The booty only consisted of $45,
some money orders and a watch. The
notes are not negotiable.
Agent Thompson telegraphed his ex
perience to Superintendent Wilder early
this morning and Deputy Sheriff White
drove out to the scene of the robbery,
which is about two miles across the lice,
in Contra Costa County. To them Thomp
son related the incidents of the eventful
night.
The agent slept in a small room adjoin
ing the station. Though he had a shot
gun by his bedside, be was awakened so
suddenly that before he could gather his
senses there was a masked mail beside him
with a revolver in his hand. A little dis
tance off were two other men. They told
him to get up and open the safe, but he
said he was not the regular agent and did
not know the combination. One of the
men stood guard over Thompson while
the otner two went into the station.
Thompson heard them boring the
safe, evidently intending to blow
it up, so in order to save the
safe he unlocked the door. The robbers
took what valuables they could rind and
departed after tieing up the agent.
An examination this morning showed
that the men had first tried to pick the
lock of the door to the station, but were
unsuccessful. They then took a railroad
tie and smashed in the door.
Thompson cannot furnish a very good
description of the men, for they were ex
ceedingly careful. Ha did not see the two
that robbed the safe at all in thelieht,
and the one who guarded him carefully
hid his face with his mask. After they
had gone be soon succeeded in releasing
himself.
"We do not believe that the men were
experts at safe-blowing," said Deputy
Willard D. Thompson, U. C. '95, President Thirteenth Department of the Univer
sity Republican League.
[Uepioduced from a photograph.]
White, after returning from Stege station.
"Instead of boring on the door near the
combination they used their bit on the
side of the safe. On the way out we met
several tramps and questioned them, but
we found no one who had seen the rob
bers."
Tnere is . no town at the depot and
Stege's . ranch is the nearest residence.
The night was stormy, and the circum
stances are very favorable for a successful
' robbery. Thompson is about 20 years of
age.
COUNTY MONEY LOST.
1 Licence Collector Ballard'n Commis
sions Were Illegal. "â 
OAKLAND, Cal., March 27.â At the
meeting of the Board of Supervisors next
Monday James W. Ballard's appoint
ment as Collector of Licenses, wbica
he has held for the past- two - years,
will be revoked. This was made a
certainty to-day by a decision received by
District Attorney Snook from the Supreme
Court in the Ventura County case. The
decision sets forth by an exposition of the
meaning of the word "such" as appears in
section 154 of Ihe county government act,
denning the duties of the county Tax Col
lector, that it iB the duty of that officer to
collect the license fees paid in the county
for the sale of liquor.
* It also holds that in Ventura County the
payment of a warrant to the license collec
tor would be illegal, that the Supervisors
have no right to authorize such a claim
and that the lower court in that county is
required to join, the County Treasurer
from the payment of ; the Auditor's war
rant in the premises. â  '.'â -'.",' .
District Attorney Snook said to-night:
"Of course the board cannot pay Bal lard
any more, but I do not think the money
can be recovered that is already paid, be
cause their "bondsmen are not liable for
that. Of course if any one tried they might
make a light? against the Board of Super
visors for the : amount paid out, bat with
out a ( careful looking into the matter I
could not say with what ; success. ; I don't
think it advisable."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 189(5.
BECAUSE OF HIS POVERTY
The High School Editor's Ex
planation of the Faculty's
Disfavor.
M'CHESNEY'S FLAT DENIAL.
Though Popular With the Pupils Wil
lis Ketcham Is Peisona Non
Grata to the Teachers.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 27. -.).
Willis Ketcham, a pupil of the High
School and editor of the iEgis, the ' school
organ, has been sent away from the insti
tution by Principal McChesney.
Ketcham says he was suspended because
his position as editor was not agreeable to
certain members of the faculty on account
of his humble circumstances. Professor
McChesney says it is because the lad is not
securing the average amount of good
marks; but this is disproved by the facts,
for there are several pupils whose marks
are no higher than Ketcham's and some
that are lower.
'â I never was so surprised in my life,"
said Ketcham to-night. "Of course I knew
that I was not so forward as many of the
scholars, but I j never had any fear that I
could not get through. My last report
card contained three C's and a B, and I
know of others having a lower standard
who are allowed to remain in the school,
and students sometimes get through on
five C's, and I have been 'promoted before
on the same marking as my last card '
shows. Of course I could not help but
wonder at my abrupt dismissal. I am
here from Indiana, living alone on the
least possible pittance, trying to fit my
self for something in life, and when I was
told that my work was not satisfactory 1
naturally wonder why others are allowed
to stay in the school whose standard is no
better than my own in their respective
studies, I don't think I was treated right
by Professor McChesney.
"There are two classes of pupils in the
High School. One ' class has wealthy
parents and are well dressed. The other
class is composed of pupils like myself,
who barely manage to get enough to eat
to enable them to study. When I was
elected editor of the 2Egis by a large ma
jority the faculty at once expressed dis
approval. A resolution was passed that
in future all 'nominations: must, be sub
mitted to the faculty for approval prior to
election. This was not thought of until
after my election, and simply meant that
the faculty would have blackballed me had
my nomination been submitted to them."
''The story that I tried to subsidize the
editor of the iEgis and such talk is all
false, as anybody knows without being
told," said Principal McChÂ«sney. "Why,
instead of being prejudiced against
Ketcham, I have been his friend. I never
interfered with the Jsgis, as every teacher
intbe building will say. WithjKetcham it is
this way: His studies have been so poor
that his teachers have continually com- i
plained, and he is only one of a lot who
were â  dropped. For the same reason sev
eral more are on the docket now. I can't
expel anybody ; that is for the City Super
intendent to do.
"After many unfavorable reports I
called Ketcham to me and talked with
him. He said he would do better, so I
gave him a second trial. But 1 it finally,
became necessary to take some decided
action .on the recommendation of his
teachers, so I again called him to my
office. Then I said: 'See here, Ketchani;
you are doing nothing; why don't you
withdraw from the school? There is no
need of fooling your time away here to the
injury of the school. Go somewhere else
and prepare your studies for the univer
sity.'
"I would consider the proposition of his
coming back if he can give a satisfactory
pledge that he will go to work faithfully,
In this regard I am acting on the advice
of Superintendent McClymonds. He has i
I often told me to get rid of the pupils that !
don't do anything, and so I have sent out
more than ever this year. I felt com
pelled against my wishes to tell Ketcham
to drop nis studies, for I was trying to
help the boy out and now he has caused I
all this fuss. With regard to the iEgis
business and those marks, that is all
false."
The system of electing teachers to the
Oakland High School is. partly responsi
ble for the social class lines that exist.
T tie teachers are elected every June for
one year only, and every year the\ have
to be re-elected. This system necessi
tates that each teacher and his* or her
friends must make a right for their places
among the School Directors prior to elec
tion night. Last year three teachers of
marked ability failed of re-election after
long terms of service, and as the election
approaches the feeling of uncertainty in
creases- It has been stated teat the most
natural way for teachers to make them
selves solid politically is to begin in the
classroom.
It is said that this has . been done.
Ketcham's contention- is that the faculty
would rather have some one of the su
perior social class to edit the; High School
paper, and that his hand-me-down suit is
not an acceptable sight to those more
favored with this world's goods than ho is.
All the professors and teachers unite in
saying that â  Ketcham is \ very backward
and does not make reasonable progress.
That he is very popular with the majority
of the pupils is proven by his election two
months ago to the position of editor of the
JEgis.
FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM
The Gold Brick Man Defeated
on Two More Writs of
Habeas Corpus.
His Attorney Will Make Another
Attempt to Get His Client Out
To-Morrow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. March 27. J
Andrew W. Root, alias Raymond, alias
Wood, alias Hiller, alias Miller, the gold
brick &winu!er, had two rounds m the Su
perior Court of Alameda County to-day
and is still in the City Jail. His attorney
is not daunted by these failures, however,
but will appear to-morrow in Department
1 with another application for a writ of
habeas corpus. It is announced to-night
that he will try each Judge in turn and in
case of a failure will then try the Supreme
Court.
When the case came up at 10 o'clock this
morning before Judge Ellsworth, S. A.
Hofstra of San Jose, one ot the defendant's
victims, nad arrived and sworn to a new
complaint. This was also made a part of
the returns of the District Attorney on be
half of the Chief of Police. Attorney Nus
baumer said he had expected that the re
turn would be based upon the warrant
upon which his client had been arrested
immediately after his discharge. But it
appeared that a new warrant had been
sworn to by Hofstra based upon the same
acts as those in the case upon which
Root had been discharged. He thought
the District Attorney should show there
was new evidence to warrant the rearrest
of the defendant.
The District Attorney said that the only
question for the court to inquire into was
the regularity of the process, and not the
matter of proof or evidence upon which
the second warrant was issued.
Mr. Nusbaumer declared he expected a
new warrant upon a new charge. "I
claim," he said, "that there is no new evi
dence, and that the second charge is the
same."
Judge Ellsworthâ You must concede
that it there is no valid process we cannot
turn him loose.
The District Attorney knew nothing of
the facts, but the presumption wa9 that
there was new evidence and that the offi
cers were doing their duty.
Mr. Nnsbaumer wanted to amend the
writ, but Judge Ellsworth thought it
would require a new proceeding anil re
manded the prisoner. The attorney at
once secured a new petition, returnable at
1 o'clock. The District Attorney at once
attacked it as not stating facts sufficient
to constitute a cause for the issuance of a
writ. Nusbaumer thought it too late to
make objection after a return had been
made. Judge Ellsworth ignored this point
and proceeded with the questions of inter
fering at that stage of the proceedings and
cf the claim that there must be new evi
dence. He thought the only question was
whether the defendant was rearrested
upon sufficient proof. This was finally ad
judged in the affirmative, and the pris
oner remanded for the second time the
same day.
RARE CHURCH CEREMONY
Part of an Alameda Church
Edifice Deconsecrated by
Bishop Nichols.
The Inspection of Company G Some
thing More Than a Perfunctory
Proceeding.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 27.â A very
unusual service was held in Christ Church
last night by Bishop Nichols. It was im
mediately after the interesting ceremony
of consecrating the chalice and paten, and
consisted of the ceremony of deconsecrat
ing the old church structure, which had
been built in with and formed apart of the
new. Deconsecration is necessary in
church law, to permit its use for other
purposes than those of holding divine ser
vice.
There will be considerable improvements
made to the old structure, which formerly
stood on a part of the site of the new City
Hall. The costs of the improvements will
approximate $2000. The exterior will De
aliered so as to conform in architecture to
the main structure. In the rear a two
story building will be erected, and the
added rooms will be used for Sunday
school and for the accommodation of the
societies connected with the church, and
for the many semi-religious gatherings of ;
the members.

Stockdale of Petal uma; Lieutenant Bor
lini, battalion adjutant: Lieutenant
Hendy, regimental quartermaster, and
Lieutenants Hunt and Cobbiedick ot Oak
land. The inspection was very thorough j
and somewhat trying. It was just the re- j
verse from the perfunctory maneuvers â¢
that such occasions usually bring forth. |
One of the unexpected innovations was ad- !
dressing the men abruptly in the rants, \
asking their age, nativity, and reasons for j
enlisting. This is done to test their alert- |
ness and general intelligence.

and this afternoon he sent the following
letter to District Attorney Snook for a legal
opinion:
My Dear Sir: To-day bas been presented to
me affidavit of registration made by Manuel
Garcia de Serpa. An examination of the affi
davit shows that he was naturalized on the
29th day of October, 1894. Accompanying his
affidavit of registration I find a copy tÂ»t the
certificate of naturalization issued to him in
the Superior Court of the county of Santa Clara
of this State.
Will the provisions of Chapter 27, Statutes
of 1895, page 453, especially that portion
which reads as follows: "And no person who
shall not be able to read the constitutibn in
the English language and write his own name
shall ever exercise the privilege of an elector
in this State; provided tnat the provisions of
this amendment relative to an educational
qualification shall not apply to any person
prevented by physical disability from comply
ing with its requisitions, nor to any person who
now has the right to vote, nor to any person
who shall be 60 years of age and upward at
the time this amendment shall take effect,"
justify me in placing' the name on the Great
Register of the county? Inasmuch as registra
tion closes Saturday for the San Leandro elec
tion I would like an answer at the earliest
possible moment.
Again, subdivision 4 of section 1097 of the
Political Code has reference to the rights of
citizenship acquired through the naturaizatiqn
of the father before the applicant attained his
majority, where applicant was bora in a for
eign land and came to this country under the
age of 21 years. A great many affidavits have
been filed wherein the statement is made, "by
virtue of. the naturalization of his father." It
seems to me thut the affidavit is insufficient,
and I desire to kuow whether I can insist upon
an affidavit being made showing the time and
place of naturalization of father and the date
of naturalization and such other facts as may
be necessary betore placing the name on the
register. '
An early answer to these questions will
greatly oblige. Yours very truly.
Frank C. Jordan, County Clerk.
"I intend to protect the Great Register
at all hazards," said the County Clerk to
day. "Many names have been put on the
register by deputies who were paid so
much a name that never ought to have
been there. I don't want any man to be
kept, off that has a right to be there; but I
don't want a single name to be there that
should not be."

TO CELEBRATE PESACH.
The Hebrew Feast of Passover
Will Commence This
Evening.
Interesting Ceremonies to Be Observed
in the Orthodox Jewish
Household.
Israelites throughout the entire world
will this evening begin the eight-day cele
bration of the feast of Pesach or Passover.
To-day is the 14th day of the Hebrew
month Nissan â the day upon which tradi
tion fixes the exodus from Egypt. It is
?n celebration of the freeing of Israel from
me tyranny of Rameses that the festival
is held.
The history of the Passover is admit
tedly one of the most complicated sub
jects in Hebrew archaeology, and lias for
centuries formed as it were a great battle
field of Pentateuch criticism. Sonleof the
original Passover customs and traditional
usages have too been deleted from the
modern Hebrew ritual. The reformed or
progressive element among Jews is largely
responsible for this.
The orthodox Hebrew welcomes the
Passover with much ceremony. On the
eve of Pesach his wife sets the supper cer
emonial table while it is yet light. Upon
it she places dishes containing the shank
bone of a lamb, to commemorate the Pas
chal sacrifice, horseradish, which typifies
the bitter servitude of Israel in Egypt,
and a curious compound of chopped al
monds, apples and spioes, supposed to
represent the mortar used by the ancient
Israelites in building. In addition to these
in a separate dish are placed four cakes of
unleavened bread, called matzos. This is
in fulfillment of the Scriptural command
that "there shall be no leaven throughout
your habitations."
Upon arrival from synagogue on Pass
over night the master of the house chants
the sanctification prayer. He then raises
the Passover bread to the view of all as
sembled at his board and reads in Chal
daic the opening words of the service:
"Like unto this was the bread of affliction
which our fathers ate in Egypt. Let all
who are hungry enter and eat-" It is
notable that, the better to carry out the
spirit of the invitation, the door of the
orthodox Jew's residence is hospitably left
ajar during the progress of the service.
More than this, if there be in his house
hold any servant of the Hebrew faith he
is entitled to a seat at the iable.
The ritual proper for the Passover even
ing is a quaint mixture of history, poetry,
legendary lore, archaeology and philoso
phy. The Seder, as it is termed, has been
contributed to by rabbis and scholars for
ages, till it resembles nothing so nearly as
a moss-grown and lichen-covered castle
full of interestine souvenirs of bygone
times.
At stated points in the service the mas
ter of the house exhibits the bitter herbs,
"mortar," and unleavened bread. This he j
does in response to the queries of the
youngest male member seated at the table,
who inquires in a set form, "Why is this
nijrhtdistinguished from all other nights?"
and many other questions equally to the
point. Four classes of wine are also
drunK during the service, and carry an
allegorical meaning to the orthodox He
brew.
Supper is eaten during a short recess in
the service, which is afterward resumed
with the chanting of the hallel, or hymns
of praise, set to tunes as ancient as the
compositions themselves.
The Seder is read by the orthodox the
first two nights of the festival, but the
celebration is continued for eight days.

FOSTER'S CONTEMPT.
He Will Be Obliged to Answer for I*
Before Judge Seawell Next
Monday.
On Monday morning President A. W.
Foster of the San Francisco and North Pa-
cific Railway will appear before Judge
Seawell of the Superior Court to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt.
President Foster ia charged with failing
to. recognize Sydney V. Smith as a di-
rector of the company. Smith was re-
cently adjudged a director and P. N. Lil-
ienthal ousted from the directorial board
in virtue of a judicial opinion rendered by
Judge Seawell in an action brought by
Smith to have his status in the board de-
fined. President Foster is accused of hav-
ing denied Smith the occupancy of a seat
in the board. Foster has appealed the
matter to the Supreme Court, and claims
his non-recognition of Smith was neces-
sary, in view of his contention that Smith
is not a legally constituted director. In
! any event, the Supreme Court will be
j called upon to finally adjudicate the case.

TO IRRIGATE THE VALLEY
Route of the Proposed Grand
Canal From Redding to
Suisun.
FOR ALFALFA, CORN AND HOGS
Fertility Will Revisit the Parched
Plains of the Great Sacramento
Valley.
Frank Adams of this City is still busy
on his project to run an irrigating canal
from the Sacramento River above Redding,
through tlie Sacramento Valley to Suisun
Bay.
The canal will be 7."> feet wide and 6lÂ£
feet deep, carrying 5 feet depth of water,
the quantity of water to i>e taken being
about 2000 cubic feet per second.
The canal will start from a dam one nrile
north of Redding, and its elevation below
the dam will be 498 feet above the levei of
the sea. The dam will be about 18 feet
high. From Kc-diiing the canal will flow
southward, skirting the foothiils with an
average fall of a foot and a half to the
mile. Thence the route will be as follows:
Crossing Olney Creek and Clear Creek,
thence two and a half miles west of An
derson, thence across Cottonwood Creek,
three miles west of Cottonwood; along
Hooker Creek and over the Hooker divide
down Dibble Creek, where the canal- bed
has been built for rive miles, two miles
west of Red bluff ; thence down the Sac
ramento Valley on the 300-foot contour
line, two and a half miles west of Corning;
thence easterly about two and a half
miles to the west of Kirfcwood; thence
three miles west of Orland, three and a
half miles west of Germantown, four miles
west of Willows, two miles west of Max
well, three miles west of Williams, one
mile west of Macy. three miles west of Ar
buckle, three miles west of Harrington,
two miles west of Dunnigan, through
Blocks, through Madison, thence follow
ing the east line of the railroad, thence
crossing Putah Creek one mile east of Win
ters, thence through Vacaville and on to
Suisun Bay.
If sufficient capital cannot be enlisted to
carry the work through it will be done on
the co-operative plan. The company will
issue 500.000 shares of stock at $1 per
share, and at the same time issue $125,000
worth of bonds at |5 per bond, the bonds
to draw interest at a quarter of 1 per cent.
Laborers will be paid $1 per day, one-half
in bonds and one-half in stock, or for
every ten days' work on the canal a man
will get a *$o bond and $5 shares of
stock and his board. These bonds
will be guaranteed to buy land
under the ditch with a perpetual water
richt at the rate of $75 per acre, or they
will be redeemed after seven years at
their full face value.
At the same time the company will
issue $125,000 worth of bonds at the par
value of $100 drawing 6 per cent interest.
These bonds will be sold to raise money
with which to buy iron and cement and
build bridges.
The canal will also furnish power for
mills and other manufacturing plants,
and it is expected that green fields of ai
falfa wiil follow the silver thread of water
down the valley.
OFFICER ROURKE'S NERVES
Best and a Quiet Beat Prescribed
for Them by Chief
Crowley.
,
His Services Highly Commended by
Captain Lees â Mrs. French Was
Very Angry Indeed.
Captain Lees yesterday investigated the
item published in yesttrday morning's ;
Calt. to the effect * that Mrs. Rose M.
French intended to bring cha-ges against
a prominent police official and an officer l
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelt3 f
to Children for having attempted to dis
credit Mrs. French's efforts on behalf of !
the prosecution in the case against Cap
tain Lane and for having obstructed the
prosecution in its efforts to secure a con
viction.
Captain Lees said that the affair had
been satisfactorily explained. Carroll I
Cook bad called upon him and told of a 1
visit made to his office by a woman named
Wilson. She was a stranger to the law} er
and suggested to him that she would in- '
terview the children who were to appear !
in court as the complaining witnesses, and j
if they should tell a different st'>ry on the
stand she would contradict it under oath..
Mr. Cook had called his clerk to overhear j
the interview in caÂ«e that there might be
a sinister plot behind the woman.
Cook at once hunted up Policeman j
Rourke and told him what had happened. |
"When the woman was described to Rourke i
he said that he had seen her in conversa- |
tion with Mrs. French, and the revelation
made to him by the lawyer caused him to
Buspect that Mrs. French was working i
against him.
Captain Lees added that he was con
vinced that Rourke was an honest, faith
ful and industrious oflicer and that Mrs. I
French was an honest, well-meaning I
â¢woman. There was no suspicion in the I
minds of the police authorities that either j
of them had neglected the duty with 1
which they had been intrusted.
The captain was asked why Rourke had
been removed from his old downtown j
beat to one in a lonely part of Hayes Val- |
ley. and he replied tnat the officer had j
overworked himself on the Lane case by
hunting for evidence and following up
clews day and night, in consequence of
which his nervous system had been shat- j
tered. It was he who had discovered and
reported the rim evidence asrainst Lane.
In order to allow Mr. Rourke all the op
portunity poi-s'Lle to wcrk up the case,
Officer Graney was transferred from Hayes
Valley to Clay and Washington streets,
from Kearny to Battery, the beat patroled
by Rourke, while Rourke and Detective |
By ram were detailed to look alter the Lane j
case.
With Lane's acquittal Rourke's detail
ceased and Chief ol Police Crowley, desir
ing to give him a chance to recuperate
from his arduous labors, requested Captain
Wittman to give bin a quiet beat, and
Rourke was sent to Graney's beat in
Hayes Valley, where there are no drunks
or tougns or he ilthy beggers, and where
the midnight sons: of the homeless dog
might soothe his shattered nerves.
Mr. Rourke declined to be interviewed \
on the matter. He said that what he had |
to say had been told by him to Captain j
Lees, and that he (Rourlce) desired to have
the subject dropped. When asked as to
the condition of his nerves he replied that
they were all right.
Mrs. French was in a non-communica
tive mood, and was very angry because
The Call had published the story. She
ilatly refused to talk any further.
IMPURE PARIS GREEN.
Professor TVickgon'g Lecture Before the
Monthly Meeting of the State
Horticultural Society.
At the regular monthly meeting of the
State Horticultural Society yesterday after
noon in the Mills building the constitution
was changed so as to allow meetings 011
the second Friday of each month in Sac
ramento, as well as on the last Friday in
San Francisco. The next meeting will be
held in the State Capitol, bacramento. B.
P. Walton, H. B. Stabler and R. D.
Stephens were appointed to arrange for
the Sacramento meetings.
The president, Mr. Lelone, cave an ex
tempore talk on the use and adulteration
of paris green. Since the last meeting
many samples have been tested and sev
enteen were found heavily adulterated.
Professor E. J. Wicks'on of the State
University addressed the society on the
subject of paris ereen, showing liovr adul
teration can be detected by co-or tests and
microscopic examination. Under the
microscope paris green has a character
istic gloDiilur form, while the adultera
tions appear as whitssh dust or minute
crystalline forms. When these are pres
ent in any considerable amount the paris
green loses its brilliant green shade.
B. F. Walton of Yuba City, B. N. Row
ley of San Francisco and R. D. Stephens
of Sacramento were appointed a commit
tee on legislation and resolutions.

HAD TO PAY EXTRA FARE
Why Two San Francisco Ladies
Are Suing a Steamship
Company.
Refused a Stateroom That Had Been
Previously Agreed Oa With
the Agent.
An interesting case, involving the lia
bility df corporations to carry out oral
contracts made through their employes,
was tried before Justice of tne Peace
Groezinger yesterday. Mrs. Dora Peyser,
who conducts the Hotel Montrose, corner
of Geary street and Van Ness avenue, and
Miss Julia Lewi?, a teacher in the Clement
Grammar School, took a trip to Europe in
May last, and engaged passage from the
local agents of the Hamburg American
Packet Company.
The laoies, being subject to seasickness,
engaged a stateroom amidships, the num
ber and location of which was noted in the
receipt given for their round-trin passage.
According to their testimony the local
agent expressly agreed that they should
have the same apartment on their return
voyage.
"When the fair tourists presented their
tickets at the European port from which
the ship sailed for the return trip and de
manded their old stateroom they were re
i fused, and in order to secure suitable ac
commodations were compelled to pay $47.^0
extra. Both testified that, though the re
turn trip was no more stormy than the
outgoing journey, they were* made very
seasick through the unfavorable iocation
of their stateroom. â¢
They sued for the extra passage money
paid and lor enough more for damages to
make up the limit of the Justice Court's
jurisdiction.
The company denied that its agent had
the right to promise the passeneers that
they would be furnished the same state
room, and also claimed that even had such
a stipulation been agreed upon it would
not be binding on the corporation.
Justice Groezinger intimated that he
considered the plaintiffs entitled to a ver
dict, at least, for the amount of the extra
passage money paid, inasmuch as they
had every reason to suppose that they
would receive as suitable accommodations
on the return as on the outward journey.
The matter was taken under advisement.

__ CONSULT THE GREAT CLAIRVOYANT,
PROF. P. EUGENE,
FOR 50c AND $1. FOR 50c AND $1.
People of San Francisco,' as well as other cities,
marvel at his power. Lawyers, speculators, busi-
ness men of all grades, and ladles from every walk
in life, together sound his praise for the benefit
they have received. All are . pleased. Professor
Eugene gives advice on business, speculation, in-
vestments, love, courtship, marriage and divorce;
settles lovers' quarrels, reunites the separated and
causes a speedy and happy marriage with the one
of 'your choice. He locates mines and buried
treasures, tells of your friends and enemies, re-
moves evil influences, gives advice pertaining to
lawsuits, locates and recovers old estates. The
troubled and unfortunate should seek his counsel.
Thousands of families long separated have been re-

THEY WILL GO
ON THE STAGE
William. Dailey Will En
gage Mattie Overman
as a Heroine.
THE PLAY OF A CENTURY
In Which Mrs. Tunnell Will
Also Appear as Dr. Brown's
Friend.
CONTRACTS TO BE SIGNED.
Richard C. White Writing a Play
That Will Eclipse the Interdicted
Durrant Case.
A play is now being written in
â which Mattie Pverman and Mrs. Tunnell
are to have the star parts. Of course the
play will follow very closely the rather
dramatic incidents of the recent careers of
the Rev. Charles O. Brown and Mrs. Mary
A. Davidson.
Richard C. White is the author of the
play. He says it will eclipse even the fa
mous Dnrrant play.
Billy Dailey has gone to Mexico to bring
back .Mattie Overman and Mrs. Tunnell.
They will be the heroines of the play. The
hero will pose as Dr. Brown, the wronged
pastor, while Mrs. Davidson will be the
arch villain of the plot.
It is only the other day that the Su
preme Court, in its own legal way of ex
pressing things, said, practically, that Su
perior Court Judge Murphy had no right
to go and interdict the production of that
great play, "The Crime of a Century," a
lyric gem, based on the murders of Blanche
Lamont and Minnie Williams by Theo
dore Durrant.
The play, written by Richard C. White,
the veteran actor, and promoted by Billy
Dailey, who tried to produce it on a stock
company basis, was staged at the Alcazar
on Monday night, July 19, 1895.
The bouse was crowded with people,
whose morbid curiosity had been aroused
by newspaper reports of the Durrant trial,
then in progress. Hundreds of people
were unable to secure seats or even stand
ing room, and a season of unusual pros
perity was promised.
White, the rising playwright, saw him
self as a Hoyt, and Dailey, why â well.
Abbey or any of the greatest would not be
in it with him. Dailey felt assured of this
because he had once managed the great
James J. Corbet* in the latter's initial
stage venture, and he knew what was what.
It was at this juncture that Judge
Murphy did what the Supreme Court has â 
said he should not have done and caused
the Sheriff to step on the stage during the
second act and stop the performance.
Manager Dailey was angered, that goes
without saying. For months he fumed
over his and his friends' arrest and threat
ened all kinds of suits for damages, which
he claimed had been caused by the un
timely interference.
Still, when The Call correspondent in
terviewed Mr. Daiiey in Los Angeles the
day the decision was rendered, he was in
a most pacific mood. Judge Murphy had
done him a wrong, he said, but he rose
above that; he soared, in fact, and said he
forgave the man who had prevented him
from making a fortune.
"I am sorry," he said, "that I ever
went into a venture calling upon me the
disapproval of the public. - I do not want
to engage in anything more of. the kind,
hence I will not attempt to again sta;ge
'The Crime of a Century.' Anyhow it l is
too late now, and the public are no longer
interested."
"Dailey is all right," asserted one of his
friends in Morocco's Theater last night.
"He's just pulling, somebody's leg. He
doesn't want it to be Known that he is
having Richard C. White writing a play
on the evidence and . story from the case
of Dr. Brown and Mattie Overman.
â¢'Dailey has been in communication
; with- Mattie Overman ever since she dis
appeared from this City for fear of having
to testify at the Davidson trial. ShÂ«Â» went
to Tia Juana, across the border into Mex
ico, and then she went to Knsenada, where
Mrs. Tunnell joined her by steamer from
San Diego. .
- "The last I heard from Billy he had ar
ranged to meet the " ladies in San Diego
a day or two after Mrs. Davidson would be
acquitted, and they were to arrange then
on what terms the two stars would con
sent to an engagement;
I "Miss Overman especially, Dailey writes,
is anxious for the engagement, and she* has
â¢won over Mrs. Tunnell, who was diffident
at first. They are both clever women, with
much self-control, good voices and they
are intelligent. There is no reason why
Dailey should not have trump cards in
that kind of material.
"Dailey proposed that Mrs. Davidson
should also be engaged, but it did not meet
with the approval of the other ladies. It
seems they are at outs. I did not follow
the Brown scandal very closely, i>o I can
not tell exactly where the hitcb comes in.
It is too bad, however. Mr*. Davidson,
and in fact Dr. Brown himself, could not
be brought into the cast with Overman
and Tunnell. MrÂ«. Davidson, I hear, will
JgÂ«_i'* on hÂ»r own account. She is coins to

don't know what Brown intends doing
after this. But if he wants a job 1 know
Dailey will treat him right.
"No, I do not know exactly the plot of
the play. I heard some of it the other
day, but it has slipped my memory. There
are some strong situations. There is the
meeting of Brown and Miss Overman in a
Pullman north bound. He, a very sick
man, is tenderly nursed by the young girl,
who, as a result of her nightly vigil, falls
quite ill. The d6ctor, having recovered, is
recalled to this City by a clamoring
congregation and, although his heart
is almost breaking, he must leave
the young woman in a pub
lic hospital. Reaching this City he
sends Mrs. Tunnell north to care for Miss
Overman. The two form quite an attach
ment for each other, and likewise both
nurse in each other a worship for Dr.
Brown. Jealousy follows when they dis
cover this. At this time Mrs. Davidson,
the villain of the plot, steps in. Kind and
good natured from outward appearance,
but dark as night wiihin, she learns ttre
love secret of the two other women and
decides to tatce advantage of the situation.
She joins the pastor's congregation and
causes herself to be liked by him for her
good work as a Christian teacher,
lv I hi* way she has three unsus
picious people under her thumb. She
has her entree everywhere and
manages to abstract letters and shift them
to suit her villainous purpose from one
household to another, and then she drops
her mask and demands a king's ransom
for her silence.
"In the meantime the pastor's wife, who
knows a thing or two herself, has been
playing a bit of diplomatic detective work
on her own account. She unravels the
whole scheme of the Davidson woman and
when the ransom is to be paid over she
steps in and causes the woman's arrest.
"Of course I mention all these names
because they are familiar, but tne people
playing the parts will be called something
else. It will be a great show, won't it?"

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1806,
SOURCE OF THE
ROENTGEN RAY.
Berkeley Professors Still
Guarded in Their
Statements.
THEIR GREAT DISCOVERY
X-Rays May Come From the
Anode or Glass of the
Tube.
ALL THE WORLD INTERESTED.
Experiments of Cory and Le Conte
Sustain the Theories of the
English Physicists.
Although nothing further was done yes
terday by the university experimenters at
Berkeley toward advancing the discoveries
as to the source of the wonder
ful X, or Roentgen, rays the state
ment of Professor Cory published in The
Call yesterday has awakened great inter
est in scientific circles, not only in this
City and State, but all over the world.
It is no exaggeration to say, in fact, that
the eyes of the whole world are now turned
to Berkeley and scientific men of almost
every complexion are awaiting with keen
interest the further results of Professor
Cory's and Mr. Le Conte's experiments.
The discovery of the. real source of the
Roentgen ray, often miscalled the cathode
ray, is of almost as much importance, or
at least second in importance only to the
primary discovery of Professor Roentgen
itself. For when the source of the strange
ray has been laid bare such experiments as
those already made by the Wizard Edison
âthat of seeing through a solid substance
for instance â will no longer be mysterious
and occult, but will take their places in
regular order as an established science.
To-day the experiments will be resumed,
when, it is confidently expected, the re
sult" already obtained will be still further
corroborated by additional proof.
Professor C. L. Cory and Instructor
Joseph Le Conte of the department of me
chanics at the university received many
congratulations yesterday because of their
success in tracing the source of the X-ray
farther than has been done by any other
experimenters, either on this coast or in
the East.
Dr. Joseph Le Conte, the veteran geolo
gist at the university, has been almost as
deeply interested in the work of the expe
rimenters as they are themselves. At the
first experiments with the ray at Berkeley
when photographs were taken of coins in
a leather purse, Dr. Le Conte was present
and offered suggestions as ' to : how the
methods might be simplified. In the re
cent partial discovery he has been equally
interested, and seems to believe that the
two young men who have - been â  develop
ing the new theory are on the right track.
Professor Christy has also been an inter
ested party and has rendered service in the
matter of developing " the photographic
impressions.
In the first work which was begun at
Berkeley about six weeks ago, Professor
Frederick Slate and Mr. Drew of the de
partment of physics were in constant At
tendance and consultation with Professor
Cory and the others at the Mechanics'
building, but they have been so com
r pletely oÂ«;upij*d wit.il vtWir Wurk r*c*t*ily
1 that they have been able" to give but little
! time to the itoentfteti ray and its possibili

origin, which >â¢ of Â«uÂ«b wide importance,
ban been conducted wholly by Protestor
Cory at*4 Mr. I* rente.

i iaÂ»<Urnl .r.Â»alu*4>iÂ« services in the matter

the tiegatiires produced by the Roentgen
ray. At was stated in this morning*
Call no one ban yet made or, at least, is
reported to have made the progress
tor rd the solution of . the origin of the
wonderful ray equal to that of the Berke
ley experimenters. The results whir they
have attained thus far verify the theories
advanced by Lodge, Hicks, Porter and
other English ptrysicists that the origin of
the ray is where the negative stream first
impinges against the solid and gives up
the negative charge.
The experimenters did nothing yesterday
but to make rontt mathematical computa
tions ana get the bulbs and mechanical
devices into condition for further develop
ments. The apparatus for making tests is
much more complete now than at first, so
that their work has been greatly facili
tated.
"What we can yet do," said Professor
Cory, *'in the way of arriving at an abso
lute solution of the problem of tne source
of the cathode ray, we are unable to say,
but we intend to keep on trying until we
either find it out or prove to our
selves that it cannot be deter
mined. We are rather careful about
giving out any extended reports as to
our developments for fear that our fabric
will fall before we have it fully complete.
Scientific men should use much precaution
in the matter of making statements before
they are absolutely sure of their ground."
WANT A WRIT.
The Supreme Court Asked to Interfere
in Judge Troutt'a Recent De
cision.
The Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar
Company has petitioned the Supreme
Court for a writ of prohibition restraining
Judge Troutt from enforcing the decision
he recently rendered in the suit of Claus
Spreckels against the company.
Spreckels sued to have the company re
strained from bringing an action against
him in the courts of Honolulu, and Judge
Troutt decided the case in his favor. A
temporary injunction was issued arid a
stay of execution was granted pending an
appeal. The appeal has taken the form of
an application for a writ of prohibition
restraining Judge Troutt from inaking the
temporary injunction permanent, and re
straining the plaintiff in the suit from
taking advantage of the decision rendered.
The Body Identified.
The body of the man who shot himself in
Golden Gate Park on the 26th inst. was iden
tified at the Morgue yesterday as that of Henry
Monferran, a window-cleaner, aged 42 years,
and formerly a resident at 1002 Pacific street.
He had been despondent over the death of a
sister.
A WAR AMONG THE ROSES
Choicest of Cut Flowers Offered
at Fifteen Cents Per
Dozen.
Violets and Lilacs as Cheap as Ordi
nary Cabbages â Some Florists
May Become Bankrupt.
There is a merry war among the San
Francisco roses.
Florists have piled . their shops full to
the ceiling with the choicest flowers of the
season, and are offering them at prices
which would make a London, New York
or. Paris dealer drop dead with amaze
ment.
â¢ The war is being fought with roses. The
fragrance of the. queen of flowers is the
odor of battle, and the only blood that is
shed flows from the pocketbooks of the
dealers pricked with the thorns of undue
competition.
Too many people are in the business
too many flowers are grown in and around
San Francisco, say the dealers, and the
end must come â  soon. Many must lie
down in the bed of bankruptcy on a mat
tress of rose leaves, mixed with caterpil
lars and thorns.
Early in the season several dealers, pla
carded their shops with the announcement
that the choicest cut roses" would be sold
in quantities to suit for 65 cents per dozen.
The other dealers saw the cut and put out
bigger signboards, ' offering roses ,at 50
cents. ,-'.-â 
--' Violets ; were put to the front also, and
were offered at 10 cents per bunch, and
finally down to two buncnes for 5 cents in
some places. Each bunch contained as
many violets as a man could cover with a
large-sized ' hand opened to its fullest ex
tent. - â¢ â¢
When lilacs came in they also were en
listed in the war, and yesterday they were
being offered in the florists' shops on Sut
ter. Post and Geary streets at 10 cents per
bunch, each bunch being as big as a flat
Dutch cabbage of adult growth.
Hotter and hotter raged the battle, and
lower and lower fell the prices until roses
were _ offered yesterday " at : 25 â¢ cents per
dozen and in two or three shops at 15 cents.
Nor were they stale or wilted specimens,
or of u the common varieties. They com
prised all shades of tint, perfume and ele
gance. Among" them were la > France,
Jacqueminot, Gloire de ". Dijon, Marecbal
Kiel ! and the gorgeous deep velvet blush
rose, whose perfume is so rich and gener
ous that it renders the air almost burden
some, tea and moss roses, and yellow, and
white,' and pink,' and crimson and purple
were } massed in the general slaughter Jof
prices. . .
The war was a revelation for the tourist
from abroad. At this time : of year fhe
would ' : . cheerfully pay 1a : guinea, or five
solid dollars, for a boutonniere in London
or Paris, but in-; San Francisco ; to-day he
may, bare his pick iof the choicest flowers
with maidenhair fern and -tinfoil thrown
in for 5 cents.
Around Lotta's fountain the air is sweet
with the fragrance of roses, lilacs and vio
lets, the boys selling them to the passers
by at 5 and 10 cents a bunch. : What lovely
woman with the instinct of her sex for the
beautiful things on earth could :. refuse ; to
provide herself with a corsage ; bouquet of
violets margined with mountain fern when
she can get it - for a - nickel! And she
doesn't 'refuse, either,: as . the absent
minded man learns to his confusion when
he bumps bis nose into a bunch of violets
and scatters perfume and bad temper all
over the indignant woman who wears
them. BfM
"This war of cut rates on cut flowers
can't last long," remarked a florist yester
day. "The big dealer* are losing money
anil the â¢mall fry are barely making a liv
ing. Sum. thin* will have to drop pretty I

many people in the bu^in?** and too many

that's what knocks the business."

RULED OFF THE TURF
The Sentence Meted Out to
Plunger Little Pete" and
Two Jockeys.
A CHINESE CONFEDERACY.
Jerry Chorn, Chevalier and Hinrichs
Pulled Horses and the Wily
Celestial Cashed Tickets.
'After a reverie k lasting over . a period of
months the i officials of â  the . California
Jockey Club finally concluded that some
element stronger than luck figured in the
phenomenal successes met J with by the
Celestial plunger, Fong Ching, or as he : is
more ? familiarly Known, ."Little Pete," in
landing on winners >at the Bay District
track.; Detectives ' " were detailed to
solve the ; system , and ; as ', a \ result Jerry
Chorn, the very capable colored rider under
contract to ride I for Bookmaker â  Barney
Schreiber, and V Hippoly te " ; Chevalier, v a
.clever lightweight, also colored, find them
selves ruled off the turf for life. The same
sentence was meted : out -to the cunning
Chinaman who caused their fall, but to him
that matters but little. Jockey Hinrichs,
the "St. Louis Garrison," - who < during the
summer months was the Chinese plunger's
right bower, was treated most ,' consider
ately ; the board of stewards directing that
a | refusal to - again ride â a . horse : over 1 the
Bay District course would about fix his
case. \: Dan Williams, the i colored' trainer,
and owner of the horses .Venus, Midas and
Sport ' McAllister Jas \ well " as â - being . the
guardian of Chevalier, â  and - who ;it â ;> is
claimed was pretty cognizant of the lad's
wrong-doing has, together with his racers,
been warned off the track:
By many it is claimed - that the Chinese
confederacy has been operating with suc
cess for a period of many months, but that
it is only of late, when some of the asso
ciation books at the Bay ' District track
were getting hard hit, that the
otli'ials decided to probe the mat
ter. Then :it was found that . certain
jockeys were in the habit of visiting China
town at night . and at a rendezvous were
| met by Little Fete, wnere the next day's
TSCi"j; r>ant.-wiÂ»-Â« rtti^rJaiflwiJs- Aft*P J'l^il,*!
I decoctions of China gin, a highbinder cigar
and a few broiled rats, horses were nicked
out to play and the riders received tuÂ«-ir
instructions. The following day thÂ« pub
{ lie played 'the none in â¢ certain raca that
I figured to Â«nt, the planner* had their
I choice, but after the race little l'ete was
found in line.
Finally, the stewards claim, one of Hmm
in on the "know," and whose name they I
refuse to divulge, Ift the cat out of the
bag, and the whole schema was laid bur*.
It was corroborated by ; Heinrichs, who
admitted pulling horses to the gain of the
Chinese plunser. Others -are also under
suspicion, ana may be compelled to Quit
the turf before the stewards complete their
investigation.
Coady, who rode the favorite, Cabrillo,
in the run won by Sir Kichard on March
2S, has < also earned a rest, the stewards
â¢Â©â¢pending him indefinitely for failing to
ride . the horse according to the orders

The running \of Fairfaitb â  has also got
steeplechase rider Andy Ulakcloy into
difficult!**. The first time our the bong
ran last and at hi- HnM appearance won
handily, so it was decided by the stewards
to refuse any more entries from Mr.

It is a strange fact that the Bay District
track was chosen by the jobbers for exe
cuting their schemes. The investigation
pointed to the fact, it is claimed, that but
one job was attempted at Ingleside, and
that failed. The conspirators' coin went
on Ed Nearny in a seven-furlong run, ana
Derfargilla captured the race. In this
event Thelma, ridden by Chevalier, was
left at the post.
THE VICE-PRESIDENT'S SON.
1.. G. Stpvennon on His Way Home From
an Asiatic Trip.
L. G. Stevenson, son of Vice-President
Adlai E. Stevenson-, arrived on the Coptic
from Japan last evening. He will start
East to-night.
Mr. Stevenson has been visiting Oriental
countries for the past five months, but has
spent most of his time in Japan. He
likes Japan, he says, better than any of
the Asiatic countries, and he does not see
why more people from California do not
go there. Everything is cheap, the peo
ple are industrious and enterprising and
the country is growing fast.
Korea, the scene of the late war, is quiet
again, and except ior the humiliation of
having Russia step in and destroy the
fruits of her victory, Japan is entirely
satisfied with the results of the war.
Mr. Stevenson was in poor health dur
ing part of his stay in Japan, but he has
(juite recovered and" will arrive home much
improved by his Asiatic trip.
MISSION CLUBS COMBINE
One General Improvement Club
; to Work for High School
and Park.
The - Proposition Fully Discussed at a
' Meeting of the Mission High
School Club.
Before " the regular, meeting of i the Mis
sion High School Club last night in the
Native Sons' Hall, on Seventeenth street,
the executive committees of this clnb and
of the Mission Defense Union discussed
the proposition of consolidating the Mis
sion Park and the High School clubs.
It was discovered that there was no Park
Club in existence, the efforts to obtain a
park in that part of toâ n being simply, a
-fe*lurÂ«- ._â ' iha_Hlsslqn_-. Defense UolcnÂ»
I therefore thÂ» consolidation- i.i it..- .-â¢â¢... .
â  witn another which hut never been !
created was oijt of the question.
A 1. Magnlre, member of both tbe ;
High School Club and the Defense Union,
advocated a union of the two interests*
After ranch animated discussion it was
re*olvÂ«l to defer tho question of de
ciding until after the mass-meeting to be
held 00 Kichte^nth MrÂ«-<-t a week from to-
I night.*- The matter will then have received
' the attention of all the members of both
I clubs and something definite can be re*
solved upon.
~.t H. OGrady, president of the High
School Club, stated that the final settle
ruent of the whole matter woul i probablr
be the divorcement of the park proposi- j
tion from the Mission Detente Union and
the consolidation of die Park and Mission
high school clubs.
On motion of W. J. Hardy a resolution
was pasted expressing thanks to the
Hoard of Education for the resolution |
{ said to have > been - passed by that body j
I promising a high-school class for the Mis
sion at the commencement of the next 1
school term. A resolution of thanks was I
also tendered the press.

CONGREGATION BETH ISRAEL.
Kabbl Levy Closes the Fifth Series of
Friday Evening Lectures.
The fifth ; annual series of Friday even
ing lectures was brought to a close last
evening at the "Geary-street Temple by
Kabbi Levy of the Congregation Beth Is
rael, who lectured on the "Aftermath." '
j Five years ago, the rabbi said, Congrega
tion Beth Israel had thrown open its doors
to ail classes' and "instituted tbe Fri
day evening lectures to counterbalance a
seeming lack of interest in Jewish religious
circles. The result had been beneficial in
the extreme, Interest had revived at
once, and since that time he had delivered
over 100 lectures and addressed j between
40,000 and 50,000 people. And so manifest
were the results that the example set by
Beth Israel had been followed by every
congregation in the City.
Judaism stands .for what is positive in
religion; not for the negative. Therefore,
it would survive only by clinging to con
servative orthodoxy, and it could not
afford to approve of the reformed Judaism,
which sanctioned the marriage of persona
of different religious faiths and the burial
of Jews in non-Jewish cemeteries. So also
must be preserved the Jewish Sabbath. If
the men, for business reasons beyond their
control, could not observe it ;. the women
mu>t observe it in their homes.
The rabbi closed by thanking bis people
for their uniform hearty co-operation and
support of the Friday evening services and
by wishing \ them - health -â â¢ and V happiness'
during the year to begin with the Passover
holidays. ' â¢
