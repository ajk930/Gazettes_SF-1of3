BARATIERI'S FATAL BLUNDERS.
It Is Reported That the Retiring
Commander-in-Chief Committed
Suicide After Defeat.
ROME, Italy, March 3.â The . Italian
campaign against the Abyssinians threat
ens to become one of the most disastrous
in which the Italian army has ever taken
part, and what the final outcome will be
it would be hard to predict.
It was rumored to-day that the latest
defeat of the Italians by the forces of
King Menelik had compelled the Ministry
to resign, owing to the popular disap
proval of the Government's policy, but to
night this report is denied.
Details received here to-day of the de
feat on Sunday of the Italian army show
that the Italian losses were very heavy,
they, being placed by some at 3000 killed.
It is still impossible to ascertain the pre
cise losses, but popular opinion credits
the report that the number of killed is
not. overstated. Thus far the reports
make no mention of the number of
wounded.
Among the dead are General Albertone,
commander of the left brigade, and.Gen
eral Dabormida, commander of the right
brigade.
The news of this latest disaster has
caused the greatest- excitement through
out Italy, and the opposition party is
taking advantage of it to make violent at
tacks upon the Government's policy in
attempting to extend the sphere of Italian
influence in Abyssinia.
KING MENELIK OF ABYSSINIA.
The scenes in the streets to-day were
very exciting, the populace being greatly
incensed against the Government. De- i
nunciations of the Ministry could be heard j
on every hand. The Pope is greatly dis- j
turbed by the news. He has ordered the ;
suspension of the.Te Deum and also the '
diplomatic banquet that were to be given
in connection with the anniversary of his
coronation. * *
A meeting of the . Cabinet was sum- I
moned last night immediately upon the !
receipt of the news of the Italian reverse.
The Ministers met at midnight and sat in j
closed session until late this morning dis- j
cussing the situation. They will meet in j
the Chamber of Deputies to-morrow and j
make a statement regarding the position
of affairs and their intentions.
A persistent rt^rnor circulates that the
Cabinet will retire. King Humbert to
day baa interviews with Prime Minister
Crispi and Signor Farini, president of the
Senate. The subjects discussed at the in
terview were presumably the Italian de
feat and the course to be pursued by the
Government, but what if any decision
was arrived at is unknown.
As stated in the United Press dispatches
last night, General Baratieri, Governor of
Erythrea, and at present commander of
the Italian forces operating against * ; the
Abyssinians, made an attack on the latter
on Sunday. The reserve Italian force took
possession of the passes leading > to Adowa
without any opposition from, the: enemy ;
This force was commanded by General El
lina. General Albertone, with four bat
talions of native levies and four mounted
batteries, then engaged the Abyssinians,
but was soon overcome by overwhelming
â¢dds and was forced to retreat. -
The San Francisco Call.
General Arimondi, the commander of
the center brigade/was ordered to. cover
the retreat of the last brigade, but his posi
tion was such that he was prevented from
carrying the order out. In the meantime
the Abyssinians, flushed with success,
made an energetic attack upon the whole
Italian front, and enveloped both wings.
The Italians made a desperate resistance,
but could not withstand the attack, and
finally orders were given for them to fall
back. Their positions were speedily aban
doned. The fighting lasted all day. Gen
eral Baratieri, with the wounded General
Ellina and his command, together with
the men under General Arimondi, retired
to Adecajo, 100 Kilometers from Adowa.
Since General Baratieri returned to
Abyssinia from his visit to Rome, on which
occasion he was decorated with the order
of the Red Eagle by Emperor William, his
conduct of the campaign has been very
harshly criticized in certain military cir
cles. His decision to break his line in this
battle and the tactics subsequently pur
sued by him are regarded by military ex
perts as inexplicable. The Italians are
said to have lost sixty guns ami all their
provisions. Even the Government ac
knowledges that when General Baratieri
was compelled to order his army to re
treat from the positions held by it he was
forced to abandon many of his guns. The
nature of the country prevented the guns
from being used against the enemy, and
later prevented the Italians from taking
them with them in their retreat. These,
of course, have fallen into the hands of the
Abyssinian., who . will undoubtedly use
them against their former owners. The
captured guns will enormously aid the ar
tillery forces of the Abyssinians, already a
factor that has ' had to be taken into ac
count by the Italians.
The situation is regarded as being so
serious that the Government has called out
all the reserves of IST-. ' Every effort will
be made to hasten the dispatch of re
enforcements to Abyssinia. Orders have
been issued for all the available transport
steamers to assemble at Naples on Satur
day next for ' the purpose of taking on
board troops for immediate dispatch to
Massowah.
General Baldissera, who was recently
appointed* to succeed General Baratieri in
the chief command of the Italian forces
in Abyssinia, has arrived at Massowah.
It is reported that General Baratieri's at
tack upon the Abyssinians Sunday was
the result of his desire to make a grand
military coup and rehabilitate his reputa
tion before he was superseded by General
Baldissera.
Among the many reports current to-day
was one to the effect that General Baratieri
had committed suicide, being unable to
endure the humiliation of his defeat.
This is the sjcond crushing defeat th.,t
the Abyssinians have inflicted upon the
Italians since the latter attempted to ex
tend their power in the dominion of King
Menelik. About three , months ago five
companies of Italian troops under com
mand of Major Tosselli were surprised and
surrounded by a force of 25.000 Abyssin
ians. The Italians made a desperate re
sistance and fought until their ammuni
tion was exhausted, when the Abyssin
ians charged upon them and massacred
nearly the whole force. Fourteen Italian
officers and over 700 men were killed.
Only a small number of the Italians suc
ceeded in breaking through the beleaguer
; â ;â¢;. THE FORTRESS OF MAKALLE.
This fortification was considered capable of^withstanding almost any force that, the
Abyssinians could bring" against it, but it was besieged by an army of 80,000 men.
. After a desperate resistance, in the. course of which the ' garrison suffered severe, priva
. tion, the Italians .made 'overtures ' for .'. terms. Somewhat to their 7 surprise,' Menelik
permitted them to march out with all the honors of war. The loss i of this stronghold
was one of the many severe blows the Italians have met with in this campaign.

Subsequently the Abyssinians besieged
Makalle and after practically reducing it
allowed the garrison to evacuate the place
with their arms and baggage. Afterward
several minor -engagements were fought
with varying success until Sunday, when
the forces of King Menelik inflicted another
and worse '..defeat upon the .combined
forces of the Italians. 1 : ;:.
ALL DETAILS SUPPRESSED.
Italian Leaders Expelled Correspondents
From the Lines.' â¢
ROME, Italy, March 3.â The Govern
ment still lacks or is withholding full de
tails of the disastrous battle with the
Abyssinians. Orders were given some
time ago for the exclusion of newspaper
correspondents from the Italian lines, and
a strict censorship has since been main
tained over press dispatches which makes
It difficult for the full story of the Italian
defeat to be made known. As a result, the
comparative scantiness of news causes the
wildest sort of speculations, and all kinds
of undoubtedly exaggerated reports are in i
circulation.
The newspapers here teem with reports,
deductions, estimates and comments. All
of them, with the exception of the Eser
cito, a military journal, ascribe the dis
aster to General Baratieri's supposed rash
ness and bis desire to achieve a victory
that would offset his being superseded in
his command. It is the opinion here that
General Baratieri's forces. numbered 15,000
men, opposed' to whom were 80,000
Abyssinians.
A late dispatch from Massowah states
tnat General Arimondi is also missing.
LONDON, Esq., March 3.â The Daily
News will to-morrow . publish a dispatch
from Rome saying that, the Cabinet ten
dered their resignations to King Humbert
Monday, but that his Majesty refused to
accept them. The dispatch adds that
General Baratieri will be recalled from
Abyssinia and will be tried by a military
court-martial. Military experts regard the
retreat of the Italians as worse than their
defeat, hey having abandoned more than
100 miles of territory. ,It is uncertain
whether they still hold Adigrat. .

SPAIN RECEIVING
OFFERS OF AID
Apparent Determine- iojj to Keep
" Cuba -as a Dependent
Colony.
TRANS - ATLANTIC STEAMERS.
Vessels Accepted for Use as Cruisers
or Privateers in Case of War
With Uncle Sam.
MADRID, Spain, March The Gov
ernment has received a number of offers
of pecuniary and other aid in the event of
a war with the United States, growing out
of the attitude of the latter on the Cuban
question. The people appear to be de
termined to uphold the Government in its
intention to keep Cuba a Spanish colony,
no matter at what cost. The Cabinet is
greatly encouraged by the attitude of the
Continental press, which, generally speak
ing, expresses much sympathy with Spain
in her determination to resent what is
termed Yankee aggression.
One important . factor in the support
accorded the Government which * is
sedulously kept in the background is that
Cuban debentures and other securities
depending for their value upon the income
derived from Cuba are held to a large
amount by foreign capitalists. With a
free Cuba these securities would be prac
tically worthless, and this accounts in a
very great measure for the attitude of
many of the foreign newspapers, which
speak not so much because that the
United States has any ulterior motive in
recognizing the Cubans as belligerents as
because they are defending the financial
interests of capitalists of their country.
In * Spain, however, * the support of the
Government is due to pure patriotism.
Among the offers of assistance, the Gov
ernment , received one from the Spanish
Trans-Atlantic Company, which has offered
to place its entire fleet of steamships at
the disposal of the Government, "making
no condition whatever. ; t The offer has been
accepted, and eight of the steamers will
be armed with from nine to twelve centi
metre guns, if 'events shall necessitate
such action, these vessels will be used as
cruisers and privateers.
: The Government has ordered that large
quantities of coal be stored in Cuba for the
use of the warships. Military prepara
tions are being hastily but' systematically
made. ' Orders have been : issued for the
dispatch to' Cuba of re-inforcements from
the < Balearic, Canary and Philippine
islands. '
At the meeting the Cabinet to be held
to-morrow Admiral \ Beranger," Minister of
Marine, will ask for a credit to complete
,the[ armament of r the : warships Pelaya;
Oquendo, Vizcaya and Maria Teresa. T
. The diplomats here had long interviews
to-day with â  Senor Elduayen, Minister of
Foreign Affairs. :
T Three hundred students of the univer
sity . attempted this morning to make a
demonstration. A number of working
men joined them. The rector of the uni
versity took prompt action to restore order
and caused the arrest of fifty or more of the
most demonstrative "of the crowd. They
were soon liberated upon promising to be
have themselves.' The police arrested two
of the workingmen.-
The day was otherwise /peaceful.'*. Many
of the . shops of the .city, on which there
were American names nave taken the pre
caution to have them ; effaced, fearing that
in the; present unsettled state of , public
temper the names would [ invite an attack.
The Catholic party, which was" formerly
the Carlist ( party, but which, is now inde
pendent, has adopted a resolution protest
ing against the attitude *of . the United
States and offering to support the Govern
ment with men and money. . '.,-
A report was current here to-day that
Captain-General Weyler bad resigned . his
command in Cuba. , The report was un
true. ;; ... - T: ..:'.,.

BATTLES WITH IXSURGEXTS.
Spanish Troops Claim to Have Won
Every â  Engagement.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 3.â General Al
decoa reports that he found 1500 men be
longing to the command of Maceo occupy
ing houses in the town of Nazarono, in the
province of Havana, and also in ths hills
surrounding tne town. His troops opened
fire on the rebels with cannon and rifles
and drove the enemy out of the town and
occupied the positions formerly held by
them. The troops later found the enemy
encamped at -the Bayamo, a small town
east of San Felipe.
They ; were : attackM and forced to re
treat. The troops in this engagement also
used their cannon. The Spanish loss was
one lieutenant killed and four soldiers
wounded. The rebels left one dead on the
field and are said to have carried many
dead and wounded with them when they
retreated. /'/
- Lieutenant Moreno, in command of a
column from' General Linares' forces, met
at about the same time the vanguard ot
rebels commanded by Castilo at Seibon,
near Managua, in the center of the prov
ince of Havana.
i The vanguard was pursued along the
road. from Nazarono to La Chusa, where
the main body, of the rebels were found.
In the fight â  that followed the rebels lost
eight killed and many wounded. Another
column of troops from the San Fernando
regiment from Havana, commanded- by
Colonel/ Figueroa, combined with the
Linares column, and had a fight with an-
other group of rebels at Las Guasimas, on
the . highway, to r Havana. The fighting
ceased at nightfall. T The rebel loss is un
known. * Aid for .the , troops who were
wounded in this encounter was sent from
Jesus del Monte..- T;
,/ Colonel Tort encountered the. forces of
Masso, Maestre and Portugalete on an
estate , near San , Jose de Las Lajas. The
rebels were intending. to make a junction
with Maceo. They set fire to the cane to
cover their retreat.

St. Louis a Recruiting Rendezvous for
Volunteers.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 3.â For some
time a whispered suspicion has been circu
lated here that St. Louis was the common
center or recruiting rendezvous for Cuban
volunteers. Since the decided action of
Congress favoring Cuban independence
this suspicion has become a certainty.
Since February *20 over 200 volunteers
have been enlisted, armed and sent from
here by various routes to Cuba. About
February 1 two men appeared here, repre
senting themselves as capitalists from New
Orleans buying horses and mules. Both
were native Cubans, but spoke English
and' had plenty of money. To-night the
local agent of these men, casting aside the
secrecy heretofore maintained, said his
patrons were agents of the Cuban repubJic.
For three weeks the recently abandoned
horse market at Broadway and Cass ave
nue has been the rendezvous of the volun
teers. Strangers would enter the place by
dozens, exercise the horses bought by the
Cubans and disappear. "The local agent
says the men are enlisted '"for the war."
They receive military scrip for pay and are
fed, clothed, and armed. The Simmons
Hardware Company admitted to-day that
it recently sold hundreds of small arms
and ammunition to -the strangers,' besides
a Tot of repeating rifles. The agent closed
to-night's interview by. saying: ;
"To-day we enlisted four of the Country
Club (polo players) of this city. They
furnish their horses and arms and will be
given commissions. ,We now have 150
men, who will be shipped at once. Our
men have been snipped in small squads
through Louisiana, Florida and points in
Mexico. The capse is just and the flimsy
barriers of conservative diplomacy will not
resist the tide of liberty that is sweeping
across the gulf to make Cuba free."
The agent exhibited a letter from El
Paso. Tex., stating that 300 volunteers had
left there within twenty days.

PRESBYTERIAN
AND PRESIDENT
Grover Cleveland at the
Rally of the Board of
Home Missions.
RECEIVED WITH CHEERS
An Interesting Address Made by
the Chief Executive of
the Nation.
INFLUENCE OF TRUE RELIGION
Vast Importance of Christian Teaching
and Endeavor in New
Communities.
NEW YORK, N. V., March The
opening gun of a big home mission cam
paign was tired to-night at Carnegie Music
Hall by the i Board of Home Missions of
the Presbyterian church.
The announcement that President
Cleveland was* to preside at the meeting
was of itself sufficient to draw an immense
audience to the hall. The doors were
opened at* 7:15 o'clock, but long before
that time the l crowd began to gather.
Five minutes after the . doors were opened
every seat in the immense hall was filled.
The audience was a very enthusiastic
one and the remarks of the various
speakers were cheered to the echo. The
object of the rally was to stir up public in
terest in the work of home missions and
to raise : funds for i completing the pay
ments on the new building of the society
on Fifth avenue. The meeting to-night is
the first of a series to be held all over the
United States. â 
It was â¢ exactly 5 minutes after 8 o'clock
when Mr. Cleveland appeared on the plat
form. He was dressed in a black frock
coat and wore a turned-down collar and a
black tie. The moment the President was
seen the immense audience rose up and
cheered wildly for a few minutes. There
was another burst of applause when the
Rev. Dr. John Hall introduced President
Cleveland as the presiding officer of the
meeting in a brief speech. Dr. .Hall in in
troducing the President said : : ':7.'7. â *.
* "My Christian friends: We have with us
here one who has .been twice called by the
. 1 voice of his fellow-citizens to :: the-- highest
official position in this United States, and
one who has, I understand, some happy
family associations with our Board of
Home Missions. I have the pleasure,
therefore, by the direction of the Board of
Home Missions, and I count it an honor
able duty, to invite the President of the
United States to preside over our present
meeting." ,
President Cleveland then came forward.
He was received very warmly, but the
cheering was by no means boisterous.
His remarks on the foreign missionaries'
sufferings were loudly cheered. He spoke
as follows:
"I desire to express my appreciation of
the privilege of participating in this con
ference and : of the opportunity thus af-
forded me of testifying to the value and
usefulness of the work undertaken by.the
Board of Home Missions [of the Presby
terian church. My interest in this sub
ject and my familiarity with home mis
sionary efforts are ; not newly acquired.
They early came to me in the surround
ings of a Christian Presbyterian home and
were stimulated by a father's faithful
labors in the cause.
"My early impressions are not, however,
the only basis of the testimony I give to
night â : in *'; favor of : home missions. As
your fellow-citizen; interested, I hope, in
all things that deepen the religious senti
ment of our people and enlarge Christian
influences, I fully realize the transcendant
importance of this agency in its operation
upon the hearts of men for the salvation
or ; their souls. The long roster of those
who have been Jed into the way of^right
eousness : through the instrumentality [of
'.he heme missions are rich trophies iof
successful endeavor.
" "But it is not only as your fellow-citizen,
but as chief ; executive officer of your Gov
ernment that 5 I desire to speak, for I 'am2
entirely certain that I serve well our en
tiro people, whose servant I am, when I
here testify to the benefit our country has
received through home missionary effort
and when I join you in anattempt to ex
tend and strengthen that effort.
"No one charged with the duties and re
sponsibilities which necessarily weigh
upon your chief executive can fail to ap
preciate the importance of religious teach
ing and Christian endeavor in the newly
settled portions of our vast domain. It is
there where hot and stubborn warfare be
tween the forces of good and evil is con
stantly invited. In these sections the van
guard of the occupation in a new settle
ment is never without its vicious and crim
inal element. Gambling-houses and dram
shops are frequently among the first estab
lishments in a new community. It must
also be confessed that removal from old
homes and associations to a new and more
primitive home has a tendency among
honest and respectable settlers to smother
scruples and to breed toleration of evil
and indifference to Christianizing and ele
vating agencies.
"The conditions if unchecked and un
corrected fix upon the new community by
their growth and expansion a character
which, while dangerous to peace and order
in their early stages of settlement, de
velops into badly regulated municipali
ties, corrupt and unsafe territories and
undesirable States. These are serious con
siderations in a country where the people,
good or bad, are its rulers, because the
conditions to which I have referred would
certainly menace within a section con
stantly enlarging the safety and welfare
of the entire body politic. If we could
now hope that churches and religious
teaching would from the first be on the
ground to oppose the 'evil influences that
are apt to prevane the beginning of or
ganized communities.. These churches
and this religious teaching were never
more needed than now on our distant
frontiers, where the process of forming
new States is going on so rapidly, and j
where newcomers who are to be the citi- i
zens of new States are so rapidly gather- j
ing: together.
"For these instrumentalities at the out
posts of our population so vitally impor- j
tant in the view of Christian men as well !
as patriotic citizens we must depend to a j
very great extent on home missionary ex- I
ertion. How can we excuse ourselves if |
we permit this exertion "to languish for
lack of proper, support. If we turn, from
the objects of home missionary labor to
the situation of those actually toiling in '
distant fields for God and humanity and a
purer, better citizenship, our sympathy j
with their work must be further quickened
ann our sense of duty to them and their j
cause actively stimulated. These are the !
men and women who have left home and
the association of friends under the direc- â 
tion of organized mission boards to teach
Christianity in sparsely settled sections '
and to organize churches where none ex- i
ist, enduring, discomfort, hardships, pov- j
erty and danger for the sake of a cause to 'â¢
which, in a very comfortable and inexpen- â 
sive way, we profess to be attached. These
are our soldiers at the front, fighting our '
battles, and we who stay at home cannot :
escape the duty of providing for them and ;
re-enforcing them in every way if we are
to continue them in our service.
* "Our hearts have recently been pro
foundly stirred by the dangers that
threaten the devoted men and women
who have gone from among us to preach
and teach Christianity in a foreign land.
Our sympathy with them and those with
whom they labor and suffer is made more
painful because the arm of complete re-
lief has not thus far been able to. reach
them. Our missionary impulse should be
large enough and strong enough for both.
"While we will not turn away from
them nor allow discouragement to destroy
activity in their behalf let us not forget
the missionaries in our own land who
need our aid, to whom we owe a duty and
who can be reached.
"It seems tome that if the Christian
people of our land estimate at its real
value the work which the Board of Home
Missions has in charge, and if they can be
made to realize its extreme importance,
the means to carry on and extend this
work will be easily forthcoming, and I
hope that such an unusual interest may
be aroused in behalf of the cause by the
movement of whj:h this meeting is a part
as will suggest to many heretofore in
different that among the most comforting
of their possessions will be a share in the
triumphs and achievements of home mis
sions."' :T'T
When the President had concluded Rev.
William G.Roberts, D.D., offered prayer.
Then Rev. Sheldon Jackson, D.D., super
intendent of missions for Alaska, made an
eloquent address. President Cleveland
then introduced the Rev. Dr. Talmage,
who received a great ovation. He said:
"Our glorious Presbyterianism is in full
bloom to-night.. This will be a historical
meeting and far down the years it will be
told in the commercial metropolis oi â¢ this
Nation that the man who has on him the
highest honors this world can give, and
twice received these honors from the
American people, in-this great mass-meet
ing for God and righteousness put down the
grandeurs of bis office at the feet of Jesus
Christ; and if they, know in heaven what
is done on earth, then amid the rejoicings
before the throne is the gladness of one of
the early ardent friends of home m ission,
the consecrated pastor, Mr. Cleveland,
once of Caldwell, N. J., but now among
the great cloud of witnesses. bending over
this triumphal scene."
The Rev. Charles L. Thompson was the
next speaker and at the conclusion of his
address the ushers took up the collection,
after which President Cleveland intro
duced Booker T. Washington, principal of
Tuskogee Institute, Alabama, as the last
speaker.
At 10:30, shortly after Mr. Washington
began, . President , Cleveland left, after
which the interest in the meeting seemed
to an extent. have gone.
The amount of the collection ; was not
announced, and after the benediction the
meeting adjourned: President Cleveland,
accompanied by Private Secretary Thur
ber, took the midnight train for Wash
ington, r V \*
President Cleveland arrived in Jersey
City at 5:15 this afternoon. William R.
Worriil and Colonel A. P. Ketchum, a sub
committee appointed by the committee of,
arrangements cf the Home Mission, met
the President.
The parly was driven to the Hotel
Netherlands. President Cleveland had
scarcely disappeared within his room
when Bourke Cockran was ushered up and
was calmly greeted by the President. The
two remained- in earnest consultation for
nearly half an hour. Mr. Cockran told a
United Press representative that the call
was purely a ; social . one, and declined to
say what the conversation was about. Mr."
Cleveland declined to be interviewed.

CUBAN RESOLUTION CORRECTED
Allen Introduced a Measure "To Pro
tect the Treasury and for
Other Purposes."
WASHINGTON. D. C, March The
principal subject before the Senate to-day
was tne agricultural appropriation bill,
carrying appropriations to the aggregate
amount of $3,262,652. It was passed with
I very little opposition or discussion, and is
| the sixth regular appropriation bill that
has passed both houses. The only other
I appropriation bill that has been received
J from the House is that for the Indian De
| partment, and it is now in the bands of the
| Committee on Appropriations.
Somebody having blundered in the for
i mal message notifying the Senate of the
! passage of the Cuban resolutions in the
| Houseâ the message indicating entirely in
j dependent action by the House, instead of
the fact that the House resolutions were
passed as a substitute for those of the Sen
ateâthe mistake was corrected to-day by
the withdrawal of that message and the
substitution of one making the correct an
nouncement. The matter was then re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions.
The only important item in the proceed
ings in the Senate to-day (in addition to
the passing of several bills) was a motion,
submitted by Gorman (D.) of Maryland,
for a reconsideration of the .vote of yester
day passing a bill authorizing the enlist
ment of additional men in the navy. The
motion is a privileged one ana may be
taken up at any time. '
At 5:15 o'clock the Senate adjourned
until to-morrow.
During the business of the morning hour
a bill was reported from the select com
mittee on the international exposition
and was passed, authorizing the Secretary
of the Treasury to distribute medals and
diplomas awarded to exhibitors at the
World's Columbian Exposition not yet
distributed, and appropriating $15,000 to
defray' expenses.
The conference report on the army ap
â  oropriation bill was presented and agreed
i to.
A bill entitled "To protect the Treasury
Department and for other purposes", was
introduced oy A ''en (Pop.) of Nebraska and
referred to the Committee on Finance. It
provides for the retirement of all National
banknotes and the substitution therefor
of United States legal-tender notes, to be
issued by the treasury to the banks, the
bonds now deposited as security for the
redemption of National bank notes to be
retained in the treasury as security for
those legal-tender notes.
A resolution was also offered by Allen,
and went over until to-morrow, declaring
that under existing laws all United States
bonds and legal-tender notes are redeem
able in gold and silver coin.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire, from
the Committee on Privileges and Elec- !
tions, reported a resolution for the ap
pointment by the President of the Senate
of a select committee of five Senators to in
quire into the fact and circumstances of
the election in the State of Alabama on
the first Monday in October, 1894. The
resolution went over without action, Gray
(D.) of Delaware stating his intention to
make a minority report. (,] v
A motion to reconsider the vote by which
the Senate passed the bill authorizing
additional enlistments in the navy was
submitted by Gorman - (D.) of Maryland,
and went over to be called up hereafter.
Attention was called by Sherman (R.) of
Ohio to a blunder committed in having the
House Cuban resolutions reported to the
Senate, not as a substitute for the Senate
Cuban resolutions (which was the inten
tion and the real fact), but as independent
action on the part of the House. He asked
to have the journal corrected. After a
good deal of colloquy Sherman admitted
that the proper remedy was to wait for the
House to send to the Senate an authentic
report of its action of yesterday.
The agricultural appropriation bill was
then taken up. The committee amend
ment striking out* of the bill the provision
for a change in the methods of supplying
tobacco to foreign countries was disagreed
to.
T A committee amendment striking out
j an item creating a "division of agrostol
! ogy,'' with a chief at $2500 a year, gave rise
l to a pretty long discussion, in the course
| of which the whole scheme of running the
j Agricultural Department was character
' ized by Hale (R.) of Maine as an abuse.
j Finally a compromise ' adjustment was
j made between the advocates and oppo
nents of the division of soils and of the
division of agrostology.
The committee amendments having all
been disposed of, an amendment was
offered by Warren (R.) of Wyoming ap
propriating $15,000 for an investigation,
under the Secretary of the Interior, as to
the best modes of irrigation.
After a long discussion' the measure was
modified so as to appropriate $4500 for con
tinuing the gauging of streams and deter
mining the water supply by the geolog
ical Survey up to the 30th of June,; 1896,
and as modified it was agreed to. The bill
was then passed. '*â 
A message was received from the House
withdrawing the House Cuban concurrent
resolutions of yesterday and announcing
the passage of the Senate Cuban concur
rent resolutions with a substituteâ the
substitute being ; the House Cuban resolu
| tions. They were referred to - the Com
! mittee on Foreign Relations.

CUSSED APPROPRIATIONS.
The House Struggled With the Question
of Fees and Salaries.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3.âTo
day's session of the House was almost
wholly devoted to a discussion of the
amendment proposed to the legislative,
executive and judicial appropriation bill
io make the offices of district attorney and
United States marshal salaried ones in
stead of paying the incumbents with a fee.
It was supported by several members, and
opposed by none. But Hartman (R.) of
Montana and Gardner (R.) of New Jersey
attacked the inequalities in the bill, which
they asserted discriminated' unjustly
against the officials named in those States.
The matter will be further considered; to
morrow under the five-minute rule, when
amendments will be in order.
A mistake having been made in the mes
sage conveying the Cuban resolutions
passed yesterday in the Senate, whereby
they were described as House concurrent
resolutions, instead of a substitute for the
Senate resolution, a resolution was
adopted on motion by Hitt (R.) of Illinois
asking a return of them in order l*f make
necessary corrections. They were shortly
returned in accordance with the request.
Senate amendments to the House bill
regulating anchorage of vessels in St.
Mary's channel were agreed to.
The House in committer of the whole re
newed consideration of the fee and salary
amendment to the legislative, - executive
and judicial appropriation bill.
Updegraff (R.) of lowa, who reported
the amendment as an independent meas
ure, further explained its provisions arid
the reasons actuating the Committee on
the Judiciary in coming to the conclusion
expressed in the bill. The bill, he said,
had no partisanship in it, and had re
ceived the earnest support of Attorney-
General Harmon and the j Department of
Justice.
The amendment was further advocated
by y wan son (D.) of Virginia t McÃae (D.)
of Arkansas, Brown (R.) of Tennessee and
Burton (R.) of Missouri. :i\ 7 T'T .-; .:.
The discussion was interrupted by Hitt
(R.) of Illinois, chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs, who asked the adop
tion of a resolution asking the Senate to
return the Cuban resolutions agreed to
yesterday. They were reported, to the
Senate as House concurrent resolutions
instead of a substitute for the Senate reso
lutions, and they were brought back to be
corrected in the manner indicated. The
resolution was agreed to.
- The debate on the fee and salary amend
ment was resumed. Most of the speakers
expressed regret that the bill did not go
further and put United States Commis
sioners in the list of salaried officers, be
lieving that that step would do more to
discourage and preys-nt frivolous and un
warranted prosecution than any other, but
they were willing to take the amendment as
the best thing that could be obtained at
present. ;'TT _â¢
Hartman (R.) of Montana, while giving
his approval to the purpose and principle
of the amendment, attacked the inequali
ties of salaries carried in: the measure.
These inequalities, he asserted, affected
the officials in Montana most seriously.
Of fourteen States Montana returned the
largest net amount of fees to the treasury,
but the salaries provided in the bill for the
attorney and marshal for that State were
lower than those of all the other thirteen
save two. He gave notice that he would
move a series of amendments intended to
correct thjese faults.
While Gardner was speaking the Cuban
resolutions were returned to the House
from the Senate in response to the request
made some time previously. .
General debate on the amendment was
closed by Connolly (R.) of Illinois, who
advocated its adoption. He would wel
come, he said, the day when the entire
system would be wiped off the statute
books. Â.,.'-â '
At 5:45 o'clock the committee rose and
at 5:50 o'clock the House adjourned.

NO DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS.

Promptly Disproved.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3.â With
reference to the report that the British
Embassador and the Venezuelan Minister
at the capital have entered into direct nego
tiations for the settlement of the so-called
Uruan incident, which was "learned" by
the Â§ Chicago \ Associated v Press and tele
graphed from Washington to-day to various
papers, Sir Julian Pauncefote is authority
for the statement that he has entered into
no negotiations with Venezuela's represen
tative on any subject, nor has he had any
instructions regarding any Uruan incident.
Minister Andrade is also officially un
aware of the existence of any so-called
Uruan incident, and is at a loss to account
for the invention thus set afloat. The
whole thing has been a matter of news
paper discussion only, and has never been
officially brought to the attention of either

LONDON, Exc, March 3.â ln the House
of Commons to-day Right Hon. Charles T.
Ritchie, President of the Board of Trade,
was asked in regard to the reports of - mis
conduct on the part of the crew of the
British steamer Ailsa, after the collision
between that vessel and the French steamer
La Bourgogne in New York harbor last
Saturday, resulting in the sinking of the
British ship. Mr. Ritchie said the Gov
ernment has not as yet obtained the fullest
possible information, to . secure which a
searching inquiry would be needed.
George N. Curzon. Under Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, replying, to questions,
made a statement that the Government
had heard nothing of the Porte having
declined to issue passports to persons
desiring to go to the distressed districts of
Asia Minor, Turkish officials there having
seized for the payment of taxes moneys
which had been sent for relief purposes.
Sir Philip Currie, British Embassador to
Turkey, he said, had been instructed to
make inquiries.
Samuel Smith, Liberal member for Flint
shire, then opened the debate on a resolu
tion of sympathy with the Armenians.
Mr. Curzon followed Mr. Smith and in
timated tliat the Government would ac
cept the latter's motion. He argued that
the reasons against Great Britain's inde
pendent action in the Armenian matter
were as much geographical as political.
Between any port at which Great Britain
could land an armed force and the scene
of the outrages there must be encountered
200,000 Turkish troops.
The crusaders of the nineteenth cen
tury, he added, must have a practical as
well as m. chivalrous aspect. The Govern
ment would not in the future abate its
efforts in behalf of the Armenians. Re
garding the past, Mr. Curzon said he
expected the House was convinced that
I the Government could not have gone fur
' ther than it had.
The debate lasted well into the night, the
House finally adopting the Armenian res
olution without - division.
Stomach, sometimes called waterbrash,
and burning pain, distress, nausea,
dyspepsia, are cured by Hood's - Sarsa-
parilla. This it accomplishes because,
with its wonderful power as a blood
purifier, Hood's Sarsaparilla gently tones
and strengthens the stomach and digestive
organs, invigorates the liver, creates an
appetite, gives refreshing sle and raises
the health tone. In cases of dyspepsia
and indigestion it seems to have "a magic
touch."
"For over 12 years I suffered from sour
Stomach
with severe pains across my shoulders
and great distress. I had violent nausea
which would leave me very weak and
faint, difficult to pet my breath. These
spells came oftener and more severe. â  I
did not receive any lasting benefit from
physicians, but found such happy effects
from a trial of Hood's Sarsaparilia that I
took several bottles and mean to always
keep it in the house. I am now able to
do all my own work, which for six years
I have been unable to do. My husband
and son have also been greatly bene-
fited by Hood's Sarsaparilla â for pains in
the back, and after ; the grip. 1 gladly
recommend this grand blood medicine."

IN A BLIZARD
George Work Defeated by
Murphy, the Irish
Giant.
AN EXCITING CONTEST.
During the Fierce Winds Slain
Pigeons Were Carried Out
side the Bounds.
THE FAVORITE LOST BY TWO.
Seldom Has a Live Bird Match At
tracted More Attention by the
Shooters.
BABYLON, L. 1., March Edward G.
Murphy, the Irish giant, defeated George
Work in a very exciting match of 200 birds
at the Westminster Kennel Club's grounds
to-day. The atmospherical conditions
were anything but favorable to the match.
A bitterly cold westerly wind which swept
across the ground whirled the tine snow
off the ground in gusts, and in a good
many instances carried birds dead out
of bounds that would have otherwise been
scored.
The betting shortly after the start was 3
to 1 on Work, and at one time bis lead of
seven justified the odds. When the seven
ty-fifth bird was shot Work had a lead of
five, the scores being: Work killed 53,
lost 17; Murphy killed 53, lost 22.
After the fourth round Work's lead was
reduced to one, the card reading: Work,
73 killed; Murphy, 72. Even money was
the best price obtainable then, and from
this until the one hundred and ninety
â¢ eighth bird was grassed it was a close, ex
citing duel.
The score was even up to the one hun
dred and fifty-sixth bird. Murphy's one
hundred and titty-ninth, a fast rignt
quarter, fell dead out of bounds, but Work
missed the next two, leaving the Irishman
one in the van. The one hundred and
sixty-second, however, was too much for
Murphy, and the one hundred and sixty
third took both barrels and fell dsad just
out of bounds. This left Work again ahead
by one bird, and he kept it up to the one
hundred and eighty -fifth bird, which
Murphy missed, and thus increased Work's
advantage to , two. Both lost their one
hundred and eighty-sixth bird, Murphy's
dropping dead just outside of bounds. The
one hundred and eighty-ninth bird beat
Work, and his lead again dropped to one.
Work had hard luck in losing his one
hundred and ninety-first, which was hard
hit and was helped over the fence by the
wind. The one hundred and ninety-second
got clear away, leaving Murphy in the
je_d.' * Â» "_"'-T :â¢ _i '- I
' From this to the one hundred and i
ninety-fifth both killed straight and it was
anybody's race. The excitement waxed
high until a murmur of disappointment
from his supporters announced that Work
had failed to bring down the second last
bird, thus clinching the win for Murphy.
Both grassed their last birds and Murphy
was the winner with 152 killed and 48
missed to Work's 150 dead and 50 lost.
Murphy made the best run of seventeen
successive kills, which he followed up with
sixteen soon after. Work's best contribu
tion was ten straight kills.
A Sinking Ball Fund.
ST. PAUL, 'Miss-., March 3.â After a
long debate this afternoon the Western
League decided to return to the old plan
of sending 10 per cent of the gross receipts
of each game to the president as a sinking
fund to pay for umpires and to pay the
salaries of players in weak clubs if neces

being to restore the vessel- and contents to
their exact condition at the time of the
seizure. As far as the Government is con
cerned, the Bermuda was practically free
early this afternoon, but there yet re
mained upon her the libel obtained by the
J. N. Rem sin Company, drydock and out
fitting firm, for eleven hundred and some
crdd dollars. The suit upon which this
was obtained was settled shortly after 4
o'clock this afternoon, and the Bermuda
is now free from all. detention.
Lawyer E. R. Olcott, who represents
General Garcia and his associates, who are
awaiting examination on the charge of
having violated the neutrality laws, said
to-day that the seizure of the explosives
upon the J. S. T. Stranahan would be con
tested upon the claim that the boxes had
been properly marked. The case will
come up in the United States Court
March 17. Â§Â£Â§_f-I
Late this afternoon Marshal McCarthy

$500, and pending the filing of bonds the
men were detained in the' Marshal's office.
After waiting until 5 o'clock for bail bonds
for the three men detained as witnesses
the Marshal allowed them to go into the

WILLI A 31 S HAS RESIGNED.
Several Reasons why the Consul-General
Leaves Cuba.'
â¢ .. WASHINGTON. I). C, March 3.â The
report that Raman 0. Williams has ten
der*!! his resignation as United Slates
Consul-General at Havana cannot be con-
.firmed officially, but it is understood on
excellent authority that it is true and that I
the letter of resignation was delivered; at [
; the State Department within the past j
-three days. j
The desire of Mr. Williams to withdraw
from the consular service at this critical
aspect of the relations of Spain and the
United States is somewhat surprising, par
ticularly as he returned to Cuba not many
months ago with the understanding, as it
was supposed here, that he would remain
until the insurrection had reached some
definite settlement.
It was understood at that time that Con
sul-General Williams had become persona
non grata to the Spanish authorities in
Cuba for the reason that through a West
Indian express agency in Brooklyn, with
which his brother was connected, an al
leged underground method of communica
tion had oeen opened with the insurgeuts.
It was also saiu that while this was put
forward unofficially as a reason for Mr.
Williams' desired retirement, another
very potent factor in his unpopularity was
his insistence upon the rights of American
citizens to fair trial and treatment in
Cuba. On this latter question, as to
the right of the United States Consul-
General to act in a quasi-diplomatic ca
pacity and present remonstrances to the
captain-general of Cuba when liberties
of American citizens were involved, some
very pointed correspondence took place
between Secretary Olney and the Spanish
Minister in Washington.
In a letter dated September 26, 1895, and
laid before Congress by the President Feb
ruary 11 last, Secretary Olney distinctly
asserted the rights of the Consul-General
to make representations where the rights
of his countrymen were involved, "simply
as the local depositary and delegate of the
sovereign power for the purpose and to the
extent of the usages fixed by treaty," and
he said to the Spanish Minister: "I ad
dress this note to you in the expectation
that the direct relations known to exist
between yourself and the superior author
ity in Cuba will enable you to set the Gov
ernor-General right upon this important
point."
The Governor-General was set right, and
Consul-General Williams, who awaited a
decision on this matter at his home in
Brooklyn, N. V., returned to his post of
duty with a distinct recognition of his
power of remonstrance in the name of the
United States.
Mr. Williams came on to Washington in
response to a request, and at the solicita
tion, as it is understood, of the President
and the Secretary of State, decided to re
turn to his post.
Mr. Williams has been in continuous
service in a consular capacity at Havana
since 1874. He of course speaks Spanish
fluently, and has discharged the duties of
his position with marked ability, though
alternately charged with favoring first one
side and then the other in the insurrec
tionary troubles on the island. The pre
cise reason for his resignation at this time
is a secret carefully guarded at the State
Department.
ASSETS ARE VERY HEAVY.
But the Central Trust Bank Is
Forced to Make an As
signment.
Slow Liquidation, Hard Times and
Misplaced Confidence Cause
the Failure.
CHICAGO, 111., March The Central
Trust and Savings Bank of this city made
i an assignment this afternoon to the Chi- ,
' cago Title and Trust Company. The bank j
has done a large business for a number of I
years, principally among . the Scandina
vian population of the city. Frank S.
Weigley, the bank's attorney, stated that
there were $350,000 of assets with which to
meet $80,000 of liabilities, not including a
claim of $30,000 which is in litigation,
the Atlas National Bank, through which
the Central Trust cleared, holding Vice-
President William A. Paulsen's personal
note for that amount secured by the bank's
indorsement. The deposits are estimated
between $50,000 and $60,000. There is in
cash in the bank 20 per cent of the total
amount of deposits, and the assignee,
after a cursory examination, sent a cir
cular letter to all depositors announcing
that the bank appeared to have assets
more than ample to pay depositors in full.
An order from the court will be asked for
to-morrow to pay a dividend on claims of
depositors. The bank's building is valued
at $100 000.
The immediate cause of the closing of
the bank was the fact that the Atlas Na
tional Bank sent their clearings back an
hour before the time required to send them
in order to protect itself. It was expected
up to 1 o'clock this afternoon that an ar
rangement would be made to dispose of
the stock to responsible parties so that the
bank could settle all claims, as the action
taken by the Atlas Bank was expected.
Mr. Paulsen wrote to the directors of
the bank, in which he holds $125,000 of the
$200,000 of stocks, last Saturday, advising
an assignment, because the bank was pur
suing a losing method of slow liquidation
and charging the failure to hard times and
misplaced confidence in President Grannis
of the Atlas Bank.
ENGLAND'S FOREIGX POLICY.
Ex-Premier Rosebery Says It Is Xow
Greatly Troubled.
LONDON, Esq., March 3.â Speaking at
a meeting in London to-night ex-Prime
j Minister Rosebery said that Great Britain's
I present foreign policy was more troubled
j than it had been since the peace of 1815.
He acquiesced in the Government's na

Lord Rosebery again attacked the lurk
ish policy of Prime Minister Salisbury.
| He said that when the Liberals left office
! Russia and France had already concurred
jin the British scheme of reform for

| its control of Ottoman affairs.

that it was best not to make a nomination
until the dissatisfied ones could be got
back into line.
They concluded to meet again to-mor

One ballot was taken to-night to see what
was the will of those present- The ballot
was as follows: Holt 23. Stone 16, Bennett

After Inflicting Deadly Blows With
an Iron Bar He Committed
Suicide.
BANGOR, Me., March 3.â Two miles
from Old Town, at 6:30 o'clock this morn
ing, Luther Antoine, ; aged 28, assaulted
Grace D. and Jennie M. Irving, leaving
them for dead. He then blew, out his
brains. The women wil! both die. The
Misses Irvine are aged about 70 and 62

Other members of the household were
an older widowed sister, a nephew named
Hopkins, older than Antoine, and a little
girl of 12 years, but recently adopted.";'..
Hopkins was in the barn milking when:
the assault was committed. The scene of
the crime was an outbuilding where An
toine, who' was of weak mind, attempted
to criminally assault the younger sister.
He knocked her down and had bound her
hands behind her when Grace Irving, who
had heard her sister's cries, appeared on
the scene.
Then Antoine went at them with an iron
bar and beat them into insensibility. Then
he went to their room, where he knew a
revolver was kept, ; procured it, ran to his
own room and shot himself through the
head, dying instantly. Hopkins, informed
of the crime by the little girl, removed the
unconscious women into the house,
mounted a horse and went for a doctor.
FIRE AMD STRIFE AT A MINE.
Superintendent Strong Refused to Leave
the Camp and Secured Assistance
From the Sheriff.
LIVINGSTON, Mont., March 3.â Sheriff
Young and a posse of ten men went up ,to
the Horr coal mines last night in response
to an urgent request from that point. The
posse found that a mob of 75 to 100 had
notified Superintendent Strong to quit the
camp at 7 o'clock last night, but Strong
instead of going secured the assistance of
three other men and barricaded his cabin.
The only reason assigned for their action
was that the weighmaster discriminated
unjustly against the miners in weighing
coal.
Warrants are out for seven of the osten
sible ringleaders. The fire is raging as
fiercely as ever in the Bozeman tunnel,
and from present indications the engine
timbering, both old and new, will be con
sumed. The tunnel has caved in at the
point where the skyline crosses and some
f reightcars have been precipitated from

LOS ANGELES, Cat,., March The
storm continued steadily all last night,
and almost without intermission to-day.
Showers of hail fell at intervals, and un
doubtedly caused some damage to budding
fruits. No washouts are reported, : but a
heavy fall of snow in the Cajon pass pre
vented the passage of trains there to-day.
Travelers who arrived from the north
this morning stated that from Mojave
south to Newhall the ground was covered
by from four inches to a foot and a half of
snow. At Beaumont, on the Southern Pa
cific, on the edge of the desert, up to 7
o'clock this morning four inches had
fallen, and more was coming as fast as it
could tumble down. The downpour of
rain extended as far out on the Colorado
desert as Mammoth Tank, while at El
Casco the showers were frequent and
heavy. No damage is reported, except for
a few minor accidents at sea, from the vio
lence of the storm. Enough rain has
fallen now to make good crops certain, and
as the mountains are filling up with snow
there can be no question about the water
sources being all filled, so as to make the
supply for next summer assured. The
weather bureau predictions are: Rain and
probably light snow to-ni^ht; continued
low temperature.

SANTA BARBARA IS SUED.
Attempt of the State to Restore
, the Lines of an Old
Survey.
Property-Holders Â Believed to Have
Instigated the Action in
Court.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 3.â A
peculiar suit was to-day instituted in the
Superior Court by the State of California,
through Attorney-General Fitzgerald,
against the city of Santa Barbara, assert
ing that the defendant has unlawfully
erected and maintained an obstruction
; across Mission street, on Hollister avenue,
and threatens to erect similar obstructions
across the same street at points where other
streets intersect, the alleged obstruction
being a redwood plank set on edge and
spiked to posts.
Inquiry into this mysterious complaint
reveals ' the fact that the obstruction in
question is the curbing lining the sidewalk
adjacent to residence lots near those inter
secting streets, but wholly outside of the
open thoroughfare now known as Mission
street. Residents of this city owning
property in the vicinity are said to have
instigated the suit, which is really a re
newed effort to restore the lines of the
Norway survey, which would move Mission
street forty-five feet back from its present
line. A_W-__S__i

SANTA BARBARA. Cal., March 3.â
The Monterey left for the north at 4:30
o'clock this afternoon. To a few who
boarded her it was stated that she was
under orders to proceed at once to San
Francisco, but a mysterious reticence has
been preserved ,by her officers while in
port and no officer or seaman has come
ashore, with the exception of the postboy.
Dispatches were received and sent while
here and every circumstance points to the
unusual activity being due to Cuban com
plications.

SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 2.â A sin
gle highwayman to-day held up two Japa
nese a mile beyond Arno, a station twenty
miles south of this city. They resisted
and one was shot and killed,, while the
other received- a bullet through the left

man describes the outlaw as a dark-com
plexioned man of medium size and wear
ing a black derby hat. He had met the
Japanese on the road from Gait and ac
companied them toward Arno. -
The news of the hold-up and murder
was brought to Arno by a tramp. He told
Hugh Maguire, a storekeeper, that three
Japanese were traveling along the railroad
track when they, met a man with a rifle.
The latter stopped the Japanese, and
as they showed right, he shot and killed
one and wounded another. : The Justice of
the Peace at Gait went to the scene of the
tragedy, and on his return telegraphed to
Sheriff, Johnson that the supposed
murderer was heading toward Sacramento.
The dead Japanese was taken, to Gait
and the . wounded one put on a train and
sent to the County Hospital.
On bis arrival here the wounded Jap told,
a different story from that sent from Gait.
He says there were only two Japshim
self and the one that was killed. They
were coming this way. from Stockton with
the stranger, who was . armed with a rifle. .
When near Arno, their companion stopped
them and demanded their money. Tney
showed fight and he used his rifle. ,

BENEFITS OF THE FIRE DRILL.
Children Retain Their Presence of
Mind and Implicitly Obey Their
Teachers' Commands;
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 3.â When
the fire alarm was sounded this morning at
the San Pedro-street School, near Seven
teenth, by Miss Adelia Anderson, the
principal, the hearts of 400 children and
seven teachers jumped and beat wildly,
but not a child moved. At a word all
arose and marched out of the building.
At times they were almost blinded by the
smoke. It was less than seventy seconds
after the alarm was sounded that the
children were standing in martial array
like soldiers, in the pelting rain, out in the
schoolyard.
When Miss Anderson opened the door
to the short hallway leading from her
schoolroom to her private office, at 10
o'clock this morning, she discovered
smoke issuing through the floor. She at
once rushed into the main hall of the
building and sounded the firegong. In an
instant the children all over the building
were receiving commands from their re
spective teachers, as they had received
then, almost daily in the fire drill. Not
one little tot lost his or her head. There
was not a sound save that of the tapping
of the bell, the commands of the teachers
and the measured tread of the children.
By the time all were out of the building
the volume of smoke issuing fro - the cel
lar, where the fire was located, was very
dense and almost blinding. Th lire en
gines subdued the incipient blaze, and only
a nominal damage was sustained.

YOLO CO IX I CR USADER 8.
Temperance Petition Again Ignored by
the Supervisors.
WOODLAND, Cal., March The rep
resentatives of the anti-liquor petitioners
of Yolo County, who have secured 50 per
cent of the signatures of the voters of this
county calling for an election on the saloon
question, were before the Board of Super
visors this afternoon. For the third sue- 1
cessive time the board laid the matter over.
The attorneys for the saloon men filed
an answer which contained a number of
objections that had already been argued,
but claimed that on account of the peti
tions not being arranged alphaoetically it
had been impossible for them to find cer
tain names and procure affidavits that the
petition was signed under a misapprehen
sion of the fact that the city of Woodland
was not included to present before the
board at this meeting. They prayed that
the matter be continued until the April
meeting of the board, and they would then
be able, they said, to procure nearly 200
affidavits of signers who did not under
stand the situation when they signed the
petition.

SEATTLE, Wash., March 3.â ln the
matter of the Northern Pacific receiver
ship to-day the Farmers' Loan and Trust
Company of New York, through its attor
ney, ex-United States Senator John B.

low and McHenry, with the addition of
Galloway, be declared a receivership board, i
Counsel" for the company said that this

have revenge if it takes him a lifetime. He
was placed in jail.
THE CARSON TRIAL OPENS
General Clarke Outlines the
Evidence Against John T.
Jones.
The Prosecution Will Attempt to
Prove Complicity in Bullion
Thefts.
CARSON, New, March 3.â Twenty min
utes after the assembling of court to-day
in the case of John T. Jones, charged with
embezzlement of mint bullion, the two ad
ditional jurors were secured. They were
E. C. Butler and James Farley of Reno.
This completed the panel and the case
opened.
The indictment charged John T. Jones
with having stolen $23,000 worth of gold
bullion from the United States Mint on the
15th of June, 1593. General Clarke, on be-
half of the Government in the opening
statement to the jury, gave a detailed ac
count of the events which led up to the
discovery of the shortage and a full his-
Tory of the Bodie Standard bar known as
No. 77; its journey from the Standard mine
into the bullion bank, into the United
States Mint and through the minting-room
until it was assayed by Inspector Mason.
He stated that he would show that the de-
posit sent in from Bodie originally con
j tamed $20,000 in gold, and when assayed
at the mint it was so entered, but when In
spector Mason assayed it last summer it
contained only a few hundred dollars in
gold. The Government expected to show
that the bar had been locked up in a vault
with a combination lock ; that no one could
enter the vault except the meiter and. re
finer, Zabriskie, or his assistant, John T.
Jones; that Zabriskie was sick most of the
time and that Jones had full charge of the
office, and the $20,000 in gold could not
have been abstracted from the bar with
out his knowledge."
General Clarke declared that the ac
counts were mutilated by tearing out
leaves, and false entries were made to
cover the theft, while the tags and books
by which the melt could be readily traced
were removed from the mint and destroyed
by Jones. On the 13th of June, 1893, gold
bar No. 14 was reported to the assayer for
remelting, when there was no necessity
for such remelting, and it was reported to
the assayer for the purpose of deceiving
the workmen and covering up the making
of a spurious melt. On that day the
workmen were kept two hours overtime in
order to complete the work.
It would also be shown, said Clarke, that
Jones came to this city in debt, and soon
began to lead an extravagant life. He
lived far beyond his means, and spent $5
for every dollar of his salary. After Feb
ruary 9, 1895, Jones left Carson and re
mained away about ten days in San Fran
cisco. During his absence the gold in the
vault was weighed, and a bar of gold (No
i!**'), valued at $700, was missing. It had
been left on the shelf in the vault, but the
day after Jones ' departure it had disap-
S eared. Having presented such proof the
Government would ask for a conviction.
Warren Noteware, the chief clerk of the
mint, was on the stand all the afternoon.
The most important thing he testified to
was the fact that the books kept by Jones
showed that he had returned about 4000
ounces more than he had received, but the
extra metal was silver that had been sub
stituted for gold, and the bars represent
.ng the extra metal were spurious.

three suits in the Federal court here to
day against the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy and Burlington and Missouri rail

grants attacked comprise 35,000 acres and
settlers and owners are made a party to
the suits, although they, purchased the
land of the railroads. The grounds for
the action relate to the adjustment of the
land grant claims law of \ 1887. It is al

Army.
The American Spirit Rampant Among
Officers and the Rank

MONTCLAIR, N. J., March Staff
Captain Crafts, who is the head of the
financial department of the Salvation
Army, met in conference with Commander
and Mrs. Booth and their attorney this
afternoon to negotiate the transfer of the
Salvation Army funds.
The question of liabilities came up, and
it was determined before turning over the
money on deposit to secure the creditors.
Liabilities that can be paid at once will be
paid, and sufficient funds will be retained
to secure liabilities not yet payable. The
balance will be transferred to the account
of the new commissioner, Eva Booth.
A statement of the liabilities will be pre
pared by Staff Captain Crafts, who has
had charge of the army's finances for the
past three years.
y A prominent Salvationist is authority
for the statement that the American spirit
is rampant among the officers and rank

PALO ALTO STILL REJOICING.
I
Students Apply Cardinal Paint as an
Evidence of Their Glee Over
. the Result.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March â Because of the favorable de
cision of the suit on which the fate of this
university seemed to depend, a general
holiday was allowed the students to-day.
Everything was quiet and subdued, for
nearly every enthusiast exhausted his
activities yesterday. An occasional boom
of the cannon was about the only re
minder that the suit has finally been dis
posed of.
All dwellings on tbe campus are deco
rated with flags and bunting, and the uni
versity postoffice presents a curious spec
tacle. Last night some students, animated
by fiery zeal, procured a supply of cardinal
pain and repainted the nostoffice build
ing. The job was hurriedly performed,
and the rain, which began about the time
of the application, resulted in streaking
the walls in a manner painful to behold.
There is a general sentiment in favor of
giving the building a second coat as soon
as the weather allows.
Just what the results will be, now that
the litigation is ended, calls to mind cer
tain plans which Dr. Jordan announced
some weeks ago. At that time, in ad
dressing the students, he said that all
future progress of the institution after a
favorable decision would largely depend
on Mrs. Stanford's own arrangements.
Among oher things which, he hinted,
would probably be given first attention
and which he felt would be necessary as
soon as obtainable, were an enlarged
library building and increased number of
volumes; the completion of a large audi
torium or chapel; the improvement of en
gineering facilities, especially for the elec
trical, mechanical and architectural de
partments, and numerous additions to the
faculty in all departments. He also sug
gested that a number of new departments
or branches would probably be opened at
an early date. .
Just when this work will begin depends
on Mrs. Stanford, and the prevailing
opinion here is that renewed building may
begin during the summer. It is quite
probable that inside of a year or two the
capacity of the college will be increased 50
per cent. , At the.present time there are
1000 students in attendance, and a' large
freshman . class will undoubtedly enter
next fall. I** is certain that the next class
that enters Stanford will see an expansion
in the ; now richest university. in the
world which has never been witnessed by
any other class in college history.
STOEIES OF LINCOLN.
The Very Last Law Case That ; He Was
Engaged In.
"Speaking of Lincoln's birthday," said
Senator Palmer yesterday, â¢-,' ' reminds me
that the very last case Lincoln ever tried
was one in which I, too, was engaged. It
was in Springfield, in Jane, 1860, after Mr.
Lincoln had received the . Presidential
nomination. Old David Baker, who had
been a Senator in the early days, had sued
the trustees of Shurtleff College, my alma
mater, for expelling his grandson, a lad
named Will Gilbert. Mr. Lincoln appeared
for the prosecution. I was the college at
torney. Mr. Lincoln came into court and
the Judge said to him: 'Mr. Lincoln, I'll
argue this case for you. You have too
much on your hands already. You haven't
any case.' And he explained the law and
application.. .TT'Ti'T-^vT 1
".'Well,' said Mr. Lincoln, with a smile,
'don't you want to hear a speech from me?'
" 'No,' said the Judge, and the last case
Mr. Lincoln tried heâ well, he didn't try it
at all."
"The first time I met Mr. Lincoln was in
1839, when I went to Springfield to be ad
mitted to the bar. He was already recog
nized as a Whig leader. He wore, I re
member,. a suit of linsey woolsey, that
could not have been worth mbre than $8
even in those days. The last time I saw
him was in February of 1865. 1 had come
to Washington at the request of the Gov
ernor, to complain that Illinos had been
credited with 18,000 too few troops. I saw
Mr. Lincoln one afternoon, and he asked
me to come again in the morning.
"Next morning I sat in the anteroom
while several officers were relieved. -At
length I was told to enter the President's
room. Mr. Lincoln was in the hands of
the barber.
" 'Come in, Palmer,' he called out, 'come
in. You're home folks, I can shave be
fore you. I couldn't before those others,
and I have to do it some time.'
"We chatted about various matters, and
at length I said:
- " 'Well. Mr. Lincoln, if anybody had told
me that in a great crisis like this the peo
ple were â ; going out to a little one-horse
town and pick out a one-horse lawyer for
President I wouldn't have believed it.'
"Mr. Lincoln whirled about in his chair,
his face white with lather, a towel under
his chin. At first I thought he was angry.
Sweeping the barber, away he leaned for
ward, and placing one hand on my knee
said: ;
;-â¢:" 'Neither would I. But it was a time
when a man with. a policy would have
been fatal to the country. I have never
had a policy. I have simply tried to* do
what seemed best each day, as each day
came.' I .
"Lincoln was not an eloquent man. He
was a strong lawyer, and an ingenious one.
His stronghold was his ability to reason
logically and clearly. He was a very self
contained man. and not easily excited. I
remember the night when the news of his
election was received at Springfield. The
patriotic ladies of the town were serv
ing a lunch in an upper room opposite the
Capitol. Mr. Lincoln was there, and read
the returns as they, were ; brought to him.
The returns from New York decided the
day. Mr. Lincoln -stood up and read the
telegram. He was the calmest man in the
room. When he had finished he said,
simply, 'Weil, I must go and tell my
â¢wife.'*-', â â  " â â  . 'â  â â -: v .**. .
"Mr. Lincoln never told a j story except
for a purpose. - I remember one thai ho
told " , in my s presence. A certain .Judge
Krum, a lawyer, had been complaining of
the treatment he had 'received from local
Judges. He swore he meant to carry his
case to the Supreme Court and: humiliate
the upstart Judge who had decided against
him. Mr. Lincoln spoke in his: quiet, dry
way : - * â¢
; "'That â  makes me think of ;; a story.
There was a certain man who dreamed
that a treasure was buried, and that to
find it he had but to dig in a certain spot.
His labors were to be crowned with suc
cess only on condition that he kept silent
while* he was digging. He began to dig.
A terrific battle was washed near him. A
naval encounter was fought near by. In
numerable tried to engage him in
conversation. Still he kept â¢ silent. A
great giant passed, walking very rapidly.
The digger did not even turn his head.
After a while a dwarf came' prancing
along, walking as if he were nine feet
high. . â¢ T
'"â¢'Say," he said to the digger, "did a
giant pass here?"
"'The digger did not answer. The
dwarf -repeated his inquiry. No answer.
T. "Can't you answer a civil question?"
asked the dwarf. No answer. -
"â "Oh, well," said the dwarf. "I'll just
walk along and overtake him."
" -Then the digger broke his silence.
" "The h â you will !'' be said.' " V T
PAMILIAE â  MISQUOTATIONS.
Passages Should Never Be Cited at
Second Hand.
Of the many causes of misquotation the
most fruitful is citing a pas-age at second
hand. Hundreds of familiar quotations,
however, which are continually dropping
from men's lips and pens, nave not even
the advantage of being taken literally at
second, but are taken from the third or
thirtieth hand. If in the former case they
greet their authors with "a certain alien
ated majesty," what must be their look in
the latter? Must not a writer be com
pelled to disavow even if he does not fail
to recognize the children of his brain when
they are thus mutilated or metamor
phosed? Familiar as all educated persons
are supposed to be with Shakespeare few
English authors are oftener misquoted.
The lineâ
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
is continually quoted as though the poet
meant to say that a single trait of natural
ness in the character outbalances all the
artificial of modern life, and is an evi
dence of the underlying kinship of men,
whereas, as another "has said, Shakespeare
meant that nature has implanted in hu
manity one characteristic, which shows
that all men are really of one stock,
namely, the universal tendency to run
after novelty, and to prefer superficial to
concealed virtues. How rarely is the
speech of Lady Macbeth quoted correctly.
"But screw up your courage to the stick
ing place!" For "place" the word "point"
is substituted.
Mr. Lowell is usually careful as well as
felicitous in quotation, but there is a
lapsus penn-ein his quotation of a familiar
line of Goldsmith's when the critic says of
Drummond's ''Gondibert" that "it is re
mote, unfriendly, melancholy and, above
all, slow." Another passage from Gold
smith's play, "She Stoops to Conquer,"
namely, "Ask me no questions and I'll tell
yon no fibs," Is usually misquoted, "lies"
being substituted for "fibs." Butler's
couplet: "vTT
He that complies against his will
Is of his own opinion still,
is usually transformed into
A man convinced against his will
â¢ Is of the same opinion still.
In quoting the well-known passage from
one of Morton's plays, "Approbation from
Sir Hubert Stanley is praise indeed," the
word "praise" is* usually substituted for
"approbation." The charm of Tennyson
lies so much in the curious felicity of his
words and in his exquisite rhythm that
the ear of one of his admirers is tortured
more than it usually is by misquotation,
when other words are substituted for his,
, or their collocation is changed; as, when
"My good sword cleaves the helms of men"
is substituted for "My good blade carves
the casque"*- of men," etc.
A passage in Virgil that has often been
misquoted is the following from the
.Eneidll, 723:
Dextrje se parvus lulus
Implicit sequiturque patrem non passibus scquls.
When these lines were quoted some years
ago by a speaker at a convention in
Faneuil Hall General B. F. Butler, who
presided, undertook to correct him, telling
him that .he should have said, "hand
passibus I acquis.'! The speaker insisted
that he was right, as he was, albeit in the
collection of quotations from foreign lan
guages .in Worcester's Dictionary at that
time authority might have been found for
Butler's assertion.
..Two noted maxims of Christian life
ascribed to St. Augustine have been shown
by Dean Stanley not to be his, namely,
"We believe the miracles for the sake of
the gospels, not the gospels for the sake of
the miracles," and "In necessarius unitas,
in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas."
The substance of the former saying may
be found m various writers far less famous
than Augustine; the latter is due to Ru
pertus Meldenius, nn obscure German
divine of the seventeenth century. It was
the Abbe fioileau, not Boileau, the French
poet, as some suppose, who said of the
Jesuits that they lengthened the creed and
shortened the decalogue.â Springfield Re

The Napoleon Dynasty.
Feeling himself sufficiently strong, Na
poleon .clearly intended to gratify in
others the weak human pride .which, as
Montesquieu says, desires the eternity of
a name, and thereby to erect a four-square
foundation for the perpetuity of his own
dynasty. The brothers Joseph, Louis and
Jerome were now no- longer Bonapartes,
ruling as Joseph Napoleon, Louis Napo
leon, Jerome Napoleon, over their respect
ive fiefs. Murat, the brother-in-law, was
already provided for in the same way, and
there were three reigning princes among
the satellites of the imperial throne. All

Is usually the fixed and unyielding rule that
obtains, and It is a pretty good one, too. A
gentleman from St. Louis, who was asked re-
â  cently for his < pinion on' the Hudson Medical
Instituteâ that grand establishment which is
known as "the big white building," and which
stands on the corner of Market, Stockton and
Ellis streetsâ said : "I was treated there, and I
know what I am talking about when I say it
has no equal in the Union." And another gen-
tleman from the same city has expressed his
opinion in a letter to the specialists practicing
there as follows:
*Â ST. LOUIS. Mo., August 9. 1595.
Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco, Cal.â
Gentlemen: A few months ago I placed myself
under treatment with the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute, sb I had been a sufferer for a lone time with a
complication of diseases that seemed to success-
fully resist all treatment. I must confess that i
was at first a little bit skeptical about placing my-
self under the care of physicians nearly three thou-
sand miles away, but I had reached a point where
something hÂ«d to be done, as i could neither sleep
tor eat with any degree of comfort. My whole
system seemed to be out of order and I was com-
pletely worn out. I now desire to express my
sincere thanks to you for the careful, conscientious
treatment that you gave my case. I am a very-
different man to-day, and I have not felt as well in
five years past as Ido now. I wish to say. too, to
those who may be suffering from diseases of long
standing, no matter of what nature, that if they
write or apply to the large white building at
the corner of Market, Stockton and Ellis streets I
am sure they will find the relief they seek, and
that they will receive the same careful and skillful
treatment that I have at the hrindso? the physicians
Of the Hudson Medical Institute.
Wish ins: you continued success in your efforts to
aid suffering .humanity, I remain very truly yours,
FRANK Ml NT URN.
There is nothing really surprising in this
letter, though no doubt many people might
think so. In his good opinion of the Hudson
Medical Institute Mr. Minturn is sustained by
"a vast cloud of witnesses." The good that is
done in all cases is so prompt and so lasting
that patients feel bound to be grateful for what
has been done for them.
â¢ Kobt. Ashurst Jr. says: "My brain is clearer and
my intellect brighter, and I would not take $500 to
relapse into the state I was in before commencing
treatment."
Geo. H. Bent of Rochester, Cal.: "From the way
I am feeling now, I don't thin- I will need to take
any more medicine than what I have now."
S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles: 'â¢! now feel as
though I was a cured and well man."
And so the letters comeâ all about in the
same tone, and all grateful for what has been
done for them. There are thousands of people
all over this Union who bless the day when
they first heard of The Hudson Medical Insti-
tute, and if they could be marshaled together
they would make a most imposing army. And
they "one and all" say that if you are suffer-
ing, and yon want to be cured SAFELY and
CERTAINLY, the great and grand old HUD-

BEST PLACE TO GO TO.

;N_^22o MARKET S.T.S.f!SS__^THE SNOW THAT
SAVED THE STATE.
Nature's Ingenious Way of
Heading Off a Cold,
Cruel Frost.
FRUIT NOT HURT A BIT.
Buds and Blossoms Kept Warm
Under the Big, White
Weather Blanket.
THE SCENES ABOUT THE CITY.
All the Suburban Hills Were Covered,
and the Views Were More Glorious
Than Ever Before.
It was a snowstorm that saved the State
from frost.
That might sound absurd to people un
acquainted with the climate of California,
for in the Eastern States, and even in some
of the high Sierra districts, snow is usually
followed or accompanied by weather so
: cold that people burn their houses down
i by overtaxing the heating abilities of the
family stoves.
Yet every cold weather man knows that
snow is warm. He finds it out when the
neighbor's villainous son reaches him un
der the ear with a missile of the beautiful,
and his own boy, pitcher for the baseball
nine at school, tackles him from ambush
oh the other side. Shoveling snow away
from the sidewalk within three hours after
sunrise. according to city ordinance require
ments, is another thing that gives an im
pression of the warmth, but that is not
strictly scientific.
Sheep buried in snow would not freeze.
That has been taught in New England
schools. . The plan of thus burying the an
imals for protection from the cold has
never been resorted to by the New Eng
land farmer, however, for it would be too
much trouble to go out and dig them up at
every feeding time.
It is the snow that keeps the grass from
destruction in the lands of the severe win
ters. It is the snow that is a blanket for
the gentle violet, and sometimes for the
belated and storm-bound calf. The fra
grant, the incomparable arbutusâ the
flower that greeted the Pilgrim Fathers
when they were looking for something
good to eat raises its tiny bud even be
fore the lingering snow has got out of the
way. Then the boys and girls come troop
ing along and the fragrant and incompar
able arbutus wishes that it|hadn' t bloomed
so soon.
Even in California the red snowflower
has its existence among the winter-looked
mountain crags, and scientific men and
other people of culture risk their necks in
climbing to capture it.
So snow is warm, though unlike a good
many other things it can never be warmed
over.
Its coming saved the fruit crop, for it
kept the frost away. Of course the Cali
fornia snow did not bury the fruit trees,
buds and all, in order to keep them warm.
It did not act as if it had taken a season's
engagement to save the grass, nor as if it
were promoting the sheep industry or try
ing to hatch out trailing arbutus. The
operation in this State was to moisten the
ground and warm up the atmosphere in a
meteorological way.
This gentle process wouldn't do at all in
a colder climate, for the snow would only
protect what it could cover, and the ac
companying cold would destroy the buds
and blossoms that shoot forth in a Cali
fornia March. But it was sufficient here,
and the fruit is saved.
Yesterday morning the streets in some
sections of the city were covered, and snow
remained on the roofs until late in the
forenoon. \ "
The hills about the City liked their new
mantles and kept them on all day. Tam
alpais presented a majestic appearance,
and* storm-clouds hung over it all day.
The view from the San Francisco hilltops
and from the high buildings was as im
posing as it was novel. Twin Peaks
seemed higher than ever, the Mission
Range looked like an importation from
the Sierras, and the foothills beyond Oak
land and Berkeley could not have been
prettier than they were. PS
Distant Mount Diablo loomed up grand
and radiant in the sunlight.
Only one inch of snow fell, but a careful
estimate shows that even that amount of
snow, placed within the reach of the small
boys, broke 856 windows in the center of
the City.
Snow fell at sea as fast as on land. The

crews of the Progressist from Victoria, B.
C, and the George Loomis from. Ventura
say that it was so cold outside the bar that
the flapjacks froze on the pan.
'â¢I never saw the Pacific Coast line pre
sent such a near approach to the Atlantic
Coast as it "did Monday morning," said
Captain Pinkham of the Progressist.
"There was snow in all directions, and the
vessel was plentifully besprinkled with it.
The snow was not so bad,' but when the
hail came down the men began to growl,
and all hands wanted to seek shelter. It
was the coldest reception I have yet re
ceived on this coast."
"You bet your life it was cold," said
Captain John Johnson" of the schooner
Shasta. The vessel was lying off Sausalito,
and when John awoke and started to get
under way he found the ropes froze in the
blocks. The skipper had just got back
from a trip to Vallejo, and while there had
learned a wrinkle or two from Commodore
Aden of the Piper, Aden, Goodall & Co.
fleet. He seized the kettle of boiling water,
and at once proceeded to thaw out the ice.
He finally succeeded, and the Shasta got
under way.
With the schooner in the foreground and
a fishing-boat trying to make up lost time,
the Marin County hills with their snowy
tops and Alcatraz standing out bold and
defiant, the passengers from San Rafael,
Sausalito and Tiburon were able to enjoy
one of the finest panoramic scenes seen in
San Francisco in years.
A coal famine was tnreatened in the New
City Hall for a few hours yesterday morn
ing, and more than one official did his
work wrapped in his overcoat until a new
supply of fuel had been nurried to the
municipal building by the contractor who
furnishes it.
The first janitor who went into the base
ment to replenish his scuttle saw that the
bunkers were very nearly empty, and to
be sure of keeping his part of the building
warm he built a rousing fire and rushed
back for more. The other janitors soon
heard of the scarcity and grabbing their
buckets flew to the basement.
Within a few minutes there was a wild
scramble for the few remaining chunks,
and dust-begrimed but triumphant janitors
toiled back up the stairs laden with the
precious fuel. Those who came late were
compelled to be content with screenings
and dust, and more than one fire smold
ered and smoked in consequence. Later,
a new supply arrived, and the chills were
chased out of the offices.

908 Broadway, March 3. 1
Alameda Count}' was completely cov
ered with snow at daybreak this morning.
Such a night has not been witnessed here
for ten years. The snow fell during the
early morning and the air continued so cold
that the hills were white throughout the
day.
The fall began about midnight and con
tinued until 4 o'clock when it began to hail
and rain. About 5 the storm cleared off
and left the county enveloped in a white
covering. Hundreds of people arose early
and went out on the cars to the foothills

to indulge in* the pleasure of tramping in
ana palying with snow. In the
city the snow was beaten down
by the rain until it was not
more than two inches deep, and this dis
appeared when the sun came out. Out in
the foothills there was snow in the drifts
several feet deep and people were enjoy
ing the unusual freak of the elements
throughout the day.
The old residents of the city are begin
' ning to recall all former experiences of the
! same nature. One old resident said to-day
! that on December 31, 1832, there was a
heavier fall of snow and the thermometer
went down to 18 degrees below zero. Sleds
j were built and all Oakland went for sleigh
1 rides New Year's day. This experience
has never been repeated in Oakland.
The spectacle of the city enveloped in
snow drew out the amateur as well as the
professional photographer, and there will

be hundreds of mementoes of Oakland's
snow experience. One of the prettiest
sights presented was the view out Broad
way with the Grizzly Peak in the back
ground.
Senator Beard of Warm Springs says the
fruit ha** 1 not been injured in his vicinity
by the storm. ,
P. J. Keller, the nurseryman, thinks
that very little damage has been done to
fruit.
J. B. Merriman, the grocer, said he did
not think the fruit trees were injured to
any extent, as the snow protected the
blooms from frost. *â¢ He did not believe
there had been any weather severe enough
to nip fruit or nut trees as yet.
There was a violent hailstorm at Hay
wards this, afternoon, and its effect was
seen on the apricot trees. About an inch
and a half of hail fell, and the storm lasted
nearly an hour.
ON BERKELEY CAMPUS.
The University Co-Eds Think That
[ Snowballing Is Not Proper
Sport.
BERKELEY, Cal., March The sev
eral inches of snow that were on the
ground this morning seemed to make the
day a lively one on * the streets of Berke
ley. Snowballs were flying at: an early
hour, and each "pedestrian or driver of a
wagon was greeted with a volley of the
cold missiles.
On several buildings of the town a quan
tity of snow was gathered, and people who
passed along the sidewalk beneath were
vigorously pel tea.
The sport was kept up until late in the
day, new supplies of snow being received
from the hills , after the snow within the
town had all melted, and as a result of the
day's amusement there are many spoiled
hats and a ! goodly quantity of damaged
neckwear in the town.
A large number of people . climbed the
hills where the snow was much deeper and
where it remained throughout the day.
Among the co-eds of . the . State Univer
sity there is a good deal of indignation at
an account published in : a: morning paper,
of to-day :of a "snowball battle," which
never took place, between freshmen and
sophomores. : The story. tells of a defeat of
the sophs by. bloomer girls, and the co-eds
are inclined to resent the implication that
they indulged in such diversion. T

' The suggestion that -was offered at a re

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Water Question Before the
Harbor Commissioners
Again.
Sailing of the Monowai Delayed on
Account of the English

The Harbor Commissioners did not hold
a meeting yesterday. President Colnon
was on the sick list, while Colonel Chad
bourne was on a visit to Sacramento. Com
missioner Cole was the only member of the
board on hand, and he at \ once adjourned
after receiving a telephonic message from
the president.
There was very little business to be trans
acted in any event. Superintendent of
Towboats and Dredgers Brown was ready
to report that during -February the Mark
ham and the Irwin and dredgers 1 and 2
has used 105,830 gallons of water. This.'at
City rates, would have cost the State over
$185, while Goodall, Perkins & Co. are
only charging $97. The full statement of
the matter will be { discussed at the next
meeting of the board. : -

come; up,' but nothing new could have
transpired.' ;. San Joaquin County sent in a
petition signed by 122 farmers, and Tulare

ing the Commissioners to act. The secre
tary of the board will send the stereotyped
answer to the effect that the board has lo

Jeremiah Deasy spoke strongly in favor
of the proposition to build a hall, lie
said that a building should be put up that
would at once be a credit to the Irish citi

TO GET HARP FEES BACK
Jere Lynch Is Suing the Hale
& Norcross Direct
ors.
AN ANTAGONISTIC ATTORNEY.
His Appointment Said to Be Needless
and Opposed to the Company's
Interests.
Jere Lynch has commenced suit against
the directors of the Hale & Norcross Min
ing Company to recover, for the company,
$5000 paid to W. H. H. Hart as attorney
for the company in the big Hale & Nor
cross suits.
The defendants in the case are Nat I.
Messer, Charles H. Fish, William F. Lyle,
George R. Wells. W. H. H. Hart, Herman
Zadig, John W. Twiggs, William Edwards,
A. G. Garnett, M. A. Cachot and the cor
poration itself. The first-named defend
ants have been directors.
Inyiis complaint Lynch alleges that on j
June 16, 1892, the board of directors then
in office retained Hart as attorney for the
company in the suits then going on. The
company was a defendant, but, the com
plaint says, it was only a nominal defend
ant, and the suit itself was brought in the
company's interests. This being the case,
the company, although a defendant, was
well represented by counsel for plaintiff,
and there was no need of having any spe
cial counsel to protect it.
â¢ In the .ace of these facts, the complaint
>oes on to say, Hart was retained by the
directors as the attorney for the defendant
corporation. The resolution, the passing
of which retained Hart, provided that he
was to receive $2000 in cash, $1000 when the
case came before the Supreme Court for
argument and $2000 when the case was
finally decided. Afterward when the de
fendants, the Hale & Norcross Company,
should pay into its own treasury a judg- j
ment against itself lor not less than $200,
--000, then Mr. Hart was to get $5000 more.
* On March 9, 1895, the complaint con
tinues, Hart was paid first $2000 and then
$1000, and then when the decision of the
Supreme Court was rendered he was paid
$2000 more, even though the decision did
not end the case.
This money was paid to the defendants,
who form two boards of directors, and the
suit is to make them personally liable for
it and to compel them to pay it back into
the treasury.
It is alleged that Hart was retained
mainly to protect the interests of H. M.
Levy, against whom a heavy portion of the
big judgment rests, and that Hart was
given a seat in the board of directors by
Levy's influence and was selected as attor
ney by vote of Levy's stock. His employ
ment, it is charged, was not only not
necessary, but was directly antagonistic to
the interests of the company. The suit
brought by Fox, it is stated, was not
'brought for his individual benefit, but for
the benefit of the corporation, and the em
ployment of Hart under the circumstances
was an injury to the cause of the stock
holders.

NATIONAL .FINANCES.
The financial statement issued :by th?
: Treasury Department on Tuesday shows
! that during the month of February there
â¢ was an increase of the interest-bearing debt
! of the Nation to the amount of $75,252,350.
In the non-interest-bearing debt there was
a decrease, but not sufficient to overcome
i the other/and the net result for the month
' was an increase in the public debt, less
cash in the treasury, amounting to $15,
--978,764 83.
The total deficit for the current fiscal
' year is now in 'excess of $36,000,000, and
1 "but four months of the year remain. "What
I chance is there on this showing for the
fulfillment of Carlisle's prophecy of a sur
plus at the end of the year? With what
I sort of face can the administration or its
j supporters in Congress any longer pretend
' that the existing tariff is sufficient for the
revenue needs of the country and that
I further tariff legislation is not necessary
\ for the public welfare?
The condition of the gold reserve, more
i over, is almost as bad as that of the reve-
n ues. It is true the statement shows the
i reserve has now the full sum of $100,000,000,
l at which it has been fixed, but while of
1 the $110,000,000 for which the recent bond
j issue was sold, $05,804.7-2 has been paid in
j gold on account, the net gain for the
â  treasury in gold coin and bars for the
: month amounts to only $03,002,041. Very
' little gold, comparatively speaking, re
mains to be paid on the loan, but the drain
I goes on continually, and it is only a matter
of time when the reserve will be br#_en
i again and a new loan will be called for.
It will be remembered that when in the
recent debate on the tariff it was stated in
the Senate that Cleveland had said no
further revenues are needed, Senator Sher
man replied: "I do not care what the
President, says. Every one " within the
hearing of my voice knows there is a de
ficit in the revenue and that it is increas
ing every month." At that time Sherman
estimated the total deficit for the current
fiscal year would exceed $30,000,000. -It is
in excess of that amount now and is hardly
likely to be reduced. It acts along with the
export of gold in draining the reserve and
the two combined keep up the endless
chain that dra_s new bond issues into be
ing and increases the National debt by
leaps and bounds.
In the face of these deficits Mr. Carlisle,
who has repeatedly declared there would
be no deficits, has been put forward as the
Cleveland candidate for the Presidency. If
he estimates public opinion in the same
way he estimates public revenues he may
think there would be no deficit in his vote,
and it would be pleasing to have the
Democrats give him a trial.
IN THE EVENT OP WAE.
Should war occur between the United
States and Spain, which, to say the least,
is not impossible, Cuba would not be the
sole objective point for the assaults of this
country. There lies in the Malay archi
pelago a group consisting of some 1200
islands, of which about one-third are in
habited, known as the Philippine Islands
and composing one of the most cherished
and valuable possessions of Spain. These
islands contain a population of ne_rly
7,000,000 and have been for many years a
never-failing source of revenue to the
Spanish Government. Spain took posses
sion of these islands in 1504. Manila, the
capital, was taken by the British in 17G2
and the city saved itself from plunder only
by agreeing to pay a ransom of $5,000,000.
These islands are known chiefly, it need
hardly be said, for their production and
export oi the cigars known generally as
Manilas, or cheroots, in which an enor-
j mous business is done, especially with
; China, Japan and the Orient generally;
j but tobacco is not the only export from
j the Philippines. A few years ago (the
latest figures available being used) these
islands exported hemp to the value of
$5,460,451, sugar to the value of $7,995,000,
cheroots and tobacco $2,025,000, and coffee
$2,093,518, the total annual expert being
in pesos or practically silver dollars $25,
--254,140.
If, then, war shall come about between
Spain and this country the Philippine
Islands are certainly too rich and ripe a
plum to be left for Spain to gather. The
defenses of Manila are so insignificant as
to be unworthy of comment, and the Span
ish troops in the islands are hardly more
than a force of police or gendarmes. 'We
could spare two, three or four ships from
the China squadron to blockade Manilaâ
and Manila is to the Philippines what
Paris is to Franceâ and submission would
necessarily follow. We do not want the
Philippines, whatever may be the popular
sentiment as to Cuba, but if we must fight
Spain it is clearly the part of wisdom to
cut off at once all her available sources of
revenue, and in this regard the Philippine
Islands should not be neglected or over
looked. With Cuba and these islands cut
out of the circuit Spain would find it next
to impossible to maintain her home Gov-
eminent, to say nothing of meeting the
expenses of a war with such a Nation as
the United States.
THE TRANSPORTATION PAOTOR.
The fact that no single question of in
dustrial concern can be considered apart'
and treated as a separate entity has been
curiously proved by the commission of
seven employes in the British iron indus
try and seven representative workmen in
other trades, who recently visited Belgium
and Germany for the purpose of ascertain
ing why those countries could underbid
England in neutral markets. It had been
assumed that the case was explainable on
the ground of lower wages in those coun
tries than in England, and hence there was
sympathy for the underpaid operatives of
the Continent. "
' But the commission has reported that
while wages are lower in Belgium. than in
England they are not appreciably lower in
Germany, and that as a matter of fact the
rate of wages is an inconsiderable
item in the problem. The simple ex
planation lies in the lower rates of trans
portation that prevail in the Continental
countries. These rates are one-half those
for long hauls in England. Thus the Bel
gians can send iron by rail a hundred
miles to Antwerp at a lower rate than is
charged in England from Staffordshire to
London. This is largely because the Eng
lish roads form combinations for keeping
up rates. As a result England cannot com
pete with the Continent ami , is losing the
business of supplying even its own colo
nies.'
The excuse for traffic arrangements
among railroads is that they prevent ruin
ous competition. If they can accomplish
that, they certainly can govern the welfare
of manufacturing industries and all other
industries by means of their tariffs, and
hence control the question of competition
between countries in these industries. This
is a formidable power, holding the inter
ests of commerce in its grasp. That is to
say, the rate of wages is by no means the
sole determining > â¢ factor governing >?. the
; profit of industries; transportation rates,
more comprehensive and powerful in their
regulation than any possible result Of la
bor combinations to control : the rate of
wages, are a most serious mat! er.
Aside from railroad rates are other items

. value of their own. The cost of . trans
! portation over wagon roads is itself a seri
| ous thing. 3 While the country is being
i stirred over the idea of making. good
i wagon roads in order to reduce the cost of
| transportation over them, we are informed
I by an intelligent body of English work
j men that railroad traffic arrangements in
; England are causing thai country to lose

I such arrangements, and which as a conse

\ position. _____________________
ME. HARMON'S HASTE.
The present trend of affairs at Washing
ton with reference to the adjustment of
the debt of the Pacific roads is to regard
the matter as a "business proposition" and
ignore the knaveries out of which all the
existing evils have come. Attorney-Gen
eral Harmon has stepped forth valiantly
in support of this idea, and in doing so
has exhibited a haste which overturns the
precedent of his office and ties his hands
if the Government should decide to pro
ceed against the roads on a plan taking
cognizance of their old rascalities.
In reply to questions 'addressed to him
by the House Committee on Pacific Koads
he has expressed the opinion. that if the
officers or directors of a company make an
unlawful issue of stock they are amenable
to the lawful stockholders and not to a
creditor of the company; that in plunder
ing the company by means of fraudulent
contracts made with themselves for con
struction they are amenable to the com
pany and not to the United States as a
creditor; that if the Government should
intervene as a complainant in order to es
tablish the rights of the company and the
liability of the dishonest officers or di
rectors it would merely be representative
of the -company, would- raise no issue
that the company could not have raised
and would be bound by the statute of
limitations applicable to the company.
This is exactly in line with the conten
tion that Mr. Huntington makes and that
Senator Morgan of Alabama opposes. Its
purpose.is to shut off inquiry into the way
in which the Central Pacific, by, means of
its Contract and Finance Company, misap
propriated shares that could have been
made to apply to the debt owing the
Government if the company had desired
to extinguish that debt. Mr. Harmon
cites with evident satisfaction the decision
of the Supreme Court in the Credit Mobil
ier case, -but it should be remembered
that at that time the point vital to the
present case had not been made promi
namely, that by reason of the
swindles perpetrated by the construction
company the Government was defrauded ,
and that such was the purpose, or at least
the inevitable result of that company's
practices. â¢ ; â  *'â -
In any event i; was exceedingly bad
taste for the Attorney-General ' to answer
the inquiries made by the committee, just
as it was altogether out of place for , the
committee to propound the inquiries. Mr.
Harmon's corporation affiliations are no
torious,-but no one ever ' believed that he
would have the hardihood to tie the hands
of the legal branch or the Government by
a hasty and almost flippant opinion on a
subject involving the Government's claim
to many millions of dollars. The admin
istration wili be in a ridiculous plight if
circumstances should require it to proceed
with foreclosure against the Pacific roads.
THE NAVAL BESEKVE.
William Thaw Denniston has published
a highly suggestive plan for developing
the efficiency of the American naval re
serve. It contemplates an organization
and functions altogether distinct from those
of the regular navy and occupying a posi
tion about half way between the army and
the navy and serviceable to both. He
points out the folly of expecting to make
marines out of bodies of men by giving
them a short cruise on a man-of-war once
a year, declaring properly that the busi
ness of a marine is one requiring years and
constant practice to master. His idea is
simply to abandon the plan of giving the
reserve a sea training and to make it pro
ficient in the art of defending the coast.
, In case of a war with England that
country would have two convenient bases
of operations from which to assail our At
lantic seaboardâ Halifax ana the Bermu
das, each only two days. distant from our
coast. Not only are the heavy commer
cial and manufacturing interests of the
United States centered largely in exposed
cities directly upon or lying near the At
lantic Coast, but the great manufactories
of arms are there situated, and their cap
ture and destruction by an enemy would
paralyze our defense. In the one city of
New Haven, for instance, absolutely un
protected, are the Winchester Arms Com
pany, the Martin Firearms Company and
the Ideal Manufacturing Company, while
the investment of New York and Wash
ington would be an unthinkable calamity.
Whatever account the navy may give of
itself in defending the coast, the fact re
mains that the fortified defenses them
selves are ridiculously inadequate and
that there is such an enormous stretch of
coast to u'uard that it might be impossible
to assemble our vessels promptly at any
particular point threatened with a formid
able fleet. Now it is not the business of
the navy to have a thorough knowledge of
every point on the coast to be defended,
and as' the local garrisons have all that
properly belongs to them as soldiers there
is no adequate provision for an arm of the
service which the naval reserve might be
made to represent. The business of the
reserve would be to make a special study
of the coast and its defenses, and to per
form the work of scouting, signaling, dis
patching, torpedo laying and working,
organizing mosquito fleets, training volun
teers and the like. : 33
â¢ For carrying out the general idea of a
coast defense the writer suggests that the
coast be divided into zones, the Atlantic
Pacific, Gulf and Lakes; each zone divided,
into districts and each district divided into
a twofold defense, one being active, in
cluding the cruisers, 'torpedo-boats,; dis
patch-boats and the bodies of the reserve,
the other passive, including fixed tor- :
pedoes, batteries and bodies of soldiers.
That seems a comprehensive scheme of
coast defense.
Because the president of the University
of Wisconsin has been' accused by the
people of that, State of being too aristo
cratic, the Detroit Tribune advises him to
meet the requirements of Wisconsin so
ciety by "expectorating ; in his whiskers
and ; trying to smell like a wolf." If
this does not lead to an interstate i war ' it
will be because the weather of ; the lake
States is too cold for , anything up there
to get red hot. 3*3 /.'*â 
The estimates submitted to the British
Parliament on Monday call for more than
$100,000,000 : for ; naval purposes, and Mr.
Goschen stated that the exchequer could
supply the . money without 3 borrowing.
Compare that showing with the deficit in
our own treasury and .it will be seen what
country has derived most benefit from the
free-trade tariff. 3

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE STEVENSON MONUMENT.
' A Suggestion That It be Built in tub Form of

To the Editor of the Callâ Sir: On examining
the pictures of the proposed fountain to be
erected 'on Portsmouth square that appeared
in The Sunday Call the one by Tilden is un
questionably the most artistic of the five, still
that does not satisfy our ideal of the subjectâ a
beautiful and artistic fountain is very rare.
Would it not be appropriate to erect one in the
form of a lighthouse substituting a ship for
the usual lantern on the top? The immediate
base representing a rocky cliff with water
trickling down between * "the < rocks. But if
there should be an objection to the , waterfall
on account of waste this could be arranged so
as to be turned on when occasion might re
quire; the basin might be made ornamental.
Let there be no hurry, but take time to con
sider the subject, for we had better not have
anything thai; a clumsy unsightly object to '
regret. â¢ It should not only be Â« monument to
a scholar, but an ornament to the neighbor
hood. By all means let the monument be
placed In Portsmouth square, for the plaza* af
fords plenty of room and the fountain would
be a great convenience. Subscriber.
: THE WILMERDING DONATION.
Why the School for Which It Provides
â¢ Should Be Located in San Francisco. ' *
ITo the Editor of The Cat!â 'In your 1 paper'
of a few days ago appeared a notice of a meeting
Of the State University Regents, held to con
sider the selection of a site for the school pro
vided for by the Wilmerding donation. In the
report of the proceeding.*- it is stated that a
very great numoer of. free sites were offered
to the regents from various places in the State,
and notably from towns across the bay, re
questing* the establishment I there of the pro
posed institution ; and while the promoters of
the *:! various sites ; were - lavish in advocacy of .
their locations no one appeared to represent
San Francisco in the case. . V ' 3
â¢ Now, ,Mr. Editor, as a "mere , looker-on in
Vienna,' ' the writer of this â¢ dares, to say that
whatever claim or fitness can be alvanced In
favor of any or all other sites will apply with
at least equal force to a site in San Francisco,
while to the selection of - site here San Fran
cisco â  has a - claimâ if not a positive rightâ of
character and strength to which no other place
in California can make any pretence. * ? 'â â¢:Â»
This "Wilmerding bequest or donation" is of
San Francisco j originâ the donor's life * was
spent here, all his business interests were here,
hit associations and friendships. -His large
fortune was made here, and ; we must suppose
his great gift was meant- in beneficent mem
ory of the prosperous life afforded him here. -
,But beyond all thl3 the conditions of putting
into active use this great bequest should 1 in
sure its location here. The beneficiaries of this
gift are to be the working class, the mechanics
and artisans of California and their children,
and nowhere have we or can we have a work
ing class in '. the ' State, except in this City,
which is the head and center of the mechanical
and industrial enterprise of the State.* Shall
, we have to send over to Alameda, Contra Costa
or other.county our contingent of pupils to re
ceive instruction under this bequest at cost of
time and money, while from here comes the
means of instruction and the great majority to
receive it?
To assume this would shock common sense
and to thus subordinate : to a very inferior
interest : the workingmen and their families
here, â¢ would be not merely a gross injustice
but a ludicrous monstrosityâ to use the homely
phrase, "the tail, indeed, wagging the dog "
Nor Is there any argument in requiring the
new institution to bo near , the State Univer
sity. The two courses of instruction, or curri
culums, are widely apart, with little, if any,
mutual relation, and as regards the govern
ment of the new institution, Ban Francisco has
been found sufficiently convenient for the re

DUSTSTOH-w AT SEA.'
! Singular Circi-mstano. That OlC''l.B"D OFF
. 'Hi* African Coast. â .*_:*â¢.âº'
To the Editor of the Sain Francisco Callâ Sir: I
\ notice in an issue of your journal an account
of a "duststorin" experienced at sea. Think
i ing it would be interesting to the public, I re
i late a similar occurrence that happened when
! I.was in command of the British bark Flora in
1878. We were bound from Cardiff to Monte
! video. When in latitude 20 de_.- 00 mm. north,
j longitude 27 deg. 00 mm. west, being about
I GOO miles from the coast of Africa, the weather
being fine and the wind moderate from north
east, a peculiar kind of haze appeared,
and in a short time we found the rigging, sails
â¢ and deck of the ship covered with a very fine
) red sand. We came to the conclusion that the
I dust had been raised by a sirocco in the deserts
of Africa, and carried to the position where we.
encountered it. - ' r : B. K. Holman. n

An Unjust Tax.
Los Angeles Herald.
To the man of wealth the mini payment of
a two dollar tine called a poll tax a trifling
matter, but to the man who is scarcely able to
procure the necessities of life it is a hardship.
There is no foundation in justice for any such
tax. . : '
Governor Budd's Proposition.
Tulare Register.
Governor Bndd has made a proposition which
is likely to be "catchy.";: It is that inasmuch
as liquor selling and liquor drinking have
caused much of the insanity and imbecility of
the State, therefore there ought to be a uni
form liquor license throughout the Slate and a
portion of such license ought to go to the sup
port of the State's asylum.

AN ATTRACTIVE COMBINATION.
The very newest shape in bodices is the coat
basque in the Louis XVI style. .; -. '.i
The waist and skirt are generally of different
materials, the latter being usually of satin or
smooth one-toned cloth; A handsome model
seen had a skirt of gray cloth. The jacket was
of tender leaf green with bright flowers strewn
sparsely over its surface. The vest was of soft
yellowish lace. The collarette revers and
jacket edges were, trimmed with a fringe of
storm marten fur. Above the crushed collar
of the silk was a ruff of rosy ribbon that
matched in hue the flowers.
With a skirt of chameleon silk there was a
coat of Petunia velvet, the rest being of gui-
pure lace over rose-colored silk to tone in with
indistinct shades of the same in the skirt. The
collar and revers were of the same heavy lace.
Large and handsome designs of flowers on
satin are much used for these coats with black
satin or colored cloth skirts. -
A brown cloth, with waist of brown satin
showing blush roses in natural tints, had a
vest of chiffon . that was novel. It was com
posed of three stripes of different colors
pink and then two shades of rather light
green, matching the foliage in the brocade. A
yellowish lace collar ended in revers in the
front. The collar was of pink miroir velvet
with a ruche of the same lace standing out of
the top of it. "*â¢ '
Less . expensive gowns of one fabric are
charmingly trimmed by a collar of silk or
velvet, with the vest to match. A -mixed
tweed in nut brown had the collar of sea
green velvet. This was edged with neutria
fur. The full vest of velvet had four-inch
bands of the fur set down its length. A cir
cular piece of velvet set in the top of the col
lar formed a frill tnat parted, about three
inches in front. "".7-7. .7 -.-'.*â¢'*. ..-*-â

Sky-scraperâ E. G. S., Livermore, Cal.
"Sky-scraper'' was originally intended to ap
ply to anything that would scrape "a sky,"
which word when first used meant a cloud,
and at this day that is the Swedish word for
cloud. Chaucer, the father of English poetry,
who lived in the fourteenth century, wrote:
And let a certain winde goe
Thai blew so hideously and hie
That it no lefte not a skie
In all the welkin long and brode.
Welkin is the plural of the obsolete term
welc, for cloud. The term sky-scraper was
afterward used to designs te.au imaginary sail,
feet alongside of the moons ail, : sky-grazers and"
the like, and was jokingly assumed, to be car
ried ig the days when sail power was the sole
reliance at sea. United States vessels at that,
time were considered the fastest afloat, and as
a reason for their speed it was asserted that
they carried sky-scrapers.

SCHOOL ON GOAT ISLAND
The Training Station of the U. S.
Navy to Be Located
There.
FOR THE PACIFIC COAST BOYS.
It Will Be Similar to the Naval Insti
tution in Operation at New
port, R. I.
The Senate of the United States day be
fore yesterday passed the bill providing
for a naval training station on the island
of Verba Buena (Goat Island) in the har
bor of San Francisco. The bill is pending
in the House of Representatives, with
Congressman S. G. Hilborn as its cham- j
pion". There is hardly a doubt of its final
passage and its approval by the President,
as the measure has received the commen
dation of the Navy Department.
The bill provides for the appointment of
two officers of the navy and one officer of
the army to select such part of Goat Isl
and, as is not used for other purposes, for
a naval training station.
It is the purpose of the Navy Depart
ment that this school on Goat Island shall
do the same work for the boys of the Pa
cific Coast that the school at Newport, R.
1., does for the youth of the Atlantic sea
board.
Commodore Matthews of the United
States navy looked over the field when he
: was here some time since, and recom
mended Goat island as the best site for
the station. His recommendation was
approved by Admiral Ramsey, and the bill
was drawn by Senator Perkins at the sug
gestion of the Navy Department.
Lieutenant Fechteler, U. S. X., who has
charge of the hydrographic office in this
City, speaks highly of the project and says
it will open for the boys of the Pacific
Coast a fine opportunity to acquire instruc
tion in seamanship. The Newport school
is doing excellent work in training young
men for duty as warrant officers in the
navy, but the distance and the expense of
a trip across the continent preclude the
young men of California from the advan
tages offered by that institution. A school
conducted at Goat Island on the lines that
govern the Newport station must result
to the benefit of the coast.
Congress proposes to go further than the
establishment of training schools. It is
provided in a measure now pending that
the most progressive young men of these
schools may De eligible to commissioned
rank in the United States navy.

MISS FAY'S SOMNOLENCY.
The Woman Who Reads People's
Minds and Calls It Mental
Telegraphy.
She Talks About the Discoverer of the
Crookes Tubes Used in Opaque
Photography.
There was a crowded bouse at the Audi
torium last night to witness the initial
performance given by Miss Anna Eva Fay,
who introduced a number of startling ex
periments, and closed the exhibition with
what is designated on the bills as "somno
lency."
The first part of the performance, in
which she was assisted by Mr. Pingree,
was devoted to the cabinet tricks con
ducted under the supervision of Edgar B.
Haymond, attorney at law, and P. S. Beel
of the southeast corner of Clay and Davis
streets, who volunteered as judges.
The cabinet tricks were neatly per
formed. In one the 'woman was held by
the two judges, and in the other she was
tied by linen bands knotted, sewed to
gether and then secured to an iron ring
secured into an uprieht board nailed to the
floor in the presence of the audience.
Her neck was fastened by bands of linen
cloth to the same board, and while in that
position she was inclosed in a very small
wooden box, leaving only her head ex
posed. The trick was performed by some
agency that to the audience was hot ap
parent.
An intervening performance was one
given by Litchfield, who makes up in
many characters before the audience and
presents many amusing portraits of peo
ple.
The audience was requested to write
short single questions, sign each with the
full name of the writer, fold the paper
without letting any one know the con
tents and place the paper out of sight.
Then Miss Fay gave an exhibition of
"the talking hand," and then she showed
a very neat trick of causing a hand
kerchief borrowed from one of the judges
to stand on end and move about at her
command.
This was followed by the "Somnolency.'
Miss Fay was seated in a chair in the mid
dle of the stage and her eves blindfolded
with a dark-colored handkerchief.
She declared that she saw names written
on pieces of paper and saw questions
asked. She called name after name and
repeated the written question, and in eacn
case when the name was announced and
the question stated Mr. Pingree called for
the paper held by the person named.
He read it, and in almost every instance
the spoken question was identified with
the written one. To each ; she gave one
answer; some were serious, others amus
ing and others sarcastic. Some fifty
questions were announced and answered
by Miss Fay.
After the performance Miss Fay was
seen by a representative for The Call.
She was still attired in the costume she
wore during the evening, an elegant white
silk trimmed with ermine, that once be
longed to Mme. Blavatsky, and over her
shoulders was a large ermine cape, as a
protection against the nipping cold. . . -
She is rather tall, slender, weighing but
eighty-seven pounds, has blonde hair,
light eyes that scintillate like gems and
become animated when she converses.'
She has passed the forty-year mark and
talks with a strongly marked English ac
cent.f^g^SaMÃMfcaMJÃÃl
"There is no such thing as humbug,"
said Miss Fay, who is a tbeosophist, "for
there is a cause for every effect. This
somnolency is not spiritualism; it is men
tal telegraphy. My brain is in a constant
commotion. It works with lightning
rapidity. When a person fixes his or her
mind on the question asked I can read it
as quick as I can print.
"Professor William Crookes, who discov
ered the Crookes tube that is Uoed in the
cathode ray process, often told me, when I
was a guest at his home in 1872 and later
years, that he would like to photograph
my brain when it is active. â  -..*.
" 'Yes, Anna,' he said to me, 'I will in
vent something that will photograph the
whole interior of ; the human -body,' and
what has been produced has been the re
sult of his research after making . that
statement*. . He is such a dear old man,
for he* is over 70 now, tall, thin, with a
small head and with snow white hair.'!
The Body Identified.
. F. Gamier of 285 Palmer street called at the
Moigue yesterday and identified the body of
the unknown man found on the Mission road
on Monday a that of Jean Louis Ader, aged 54
years, and formerly keeper of the King House,
on Bush street. Tne deceased had lived with
Gamier since he became dependent. The
body is still at the Morgue. An inquest will
be held by Coroner Hawkins.
.Excessive Damages.
Judge Hunt, has ordered' a new trial in the
case of A. Vardelli against the Grays Harbor
Construction Company, the order to be void,
however, if the plaintiff will accept a reduc
tion of $2500 from the verdict of $7500 ren
dered. The suit was one for damages for the
loss of an arm by the plaintiff while in de
fendant's ; service. The court considered the
damages awarded as excessive.
Death of Rev. Aereden.
The death jat Martinez iis recorded of Rev.
James - Henry Aeredeu, O. P., rector; of St.

TRADESMEN EASILY DUPED
Extensive Operations of an Ex-
Waiter at the Stanford
University. .
HE IS CLEVERLY CAPTURED.
By Means of Forged Letters and
Checks He Swindled Several
Hotels and Firms.
Emile Beck, an ex-waiter .at the Stan
ford University Boarding Club, has been
for the past two weeks swindling a large
number of hotel-kerpers and jewelers by
means of forged letters and forged checks
in the name of John T. Euller, treasurer of
the club.
His method was simple and not origi
nal, but' it worked well. To the jewelers he
wrote a letter from Palo Alto that the stu
dents proposed to present a diamond stud
or watch to one of the instructors, and
Charles Sutter, the advertising agent of
the university paper. The Sequoia, would
call upon him to select the article. Beck,
who was "Charles Sutter," called in a day
or two upon the jeweler, selected the stud,
and paid for it by a forged â  check on the
Emile Beck, ex* Waiter of the Stanford Club, Arrested for the Wholesale Swind
ling of Hotel-Keepers and Jewelers.
[From â ' a ' photograph.]
Palo Alto Bank in the name of John T.
Euller. The amount of the check was, as
a rule, larger than the amount oi the pur
chase, and Beck got the change.
r To the hotel-keepers he wrote that the
students' football team would visit the
City to play a game and would stay at
their place. "Charles Sutter" would call
and make arrangements.' He called, paid
for the night's lodging with a - forged
check, and pocketed the change.
Mr. Euller became aroused at the num
ber of forced checks that the bank at Palo
Alto kept advising him about and he came
to the City and consulted Captain Lees.
As it was Believed that Beck would call on
other firms with which the club had deal
ings it was decided to notify them to be
on the lookout for Beck and inform the
police at once when he called.. Detectives
Gibson and Wren were also detailed on
the case.
On . Monday S. L. Braverman, jeweler,
121 Post street, received a letter announc
ing that the students were desirous of
giving President Jordan a birthday pres
ent of a diamond ring and Charles Sutter
would call for the ring. George C. Borne
man, a dealer in diamonds and watches in
the Thurlow block, received a similar let
ter, but the article mentioned was a dia
mond stud. Braverman: and Borneman
compared notes and the police were noti
fied.
Yesterday morning Beck called at
Brjiverman's store with a forged check
for $150 and asked for the diamond ring.
Braverman requested him to wait for
few minutes while he procured the ring,
and while Max M. Baden and M.J. Pren
dergast kent him in conversation Braver
man telephoned to ,'; the California-street
police station. Lieutenant Esola was
quickly at the store and placed Beck under
arrest. He was later handed over to De
tectives Gibson and Wren and taken to
the City Prison.
' The police have so far been notified that
the following firms and hotels are the .vic
tims of the swindler: Pleasanton Hotel,
$25; Yoseroite House, $40; Hughes House,
$40: Ahlborn House, $45 ;3 Hackmeier's
Hotel, $45; Cosmopolitan Hotel, $40;
Golden West Hotel, $40; New Western
Hotel, $40;. C. Hansen, < 110 Geary street,
$I*3 35; Glindermann & Schweitzer, jewel-,
ers, valuable diamond stud;'Curren & Co.,
220 Sutter street, diamond stud ; Hammer
smith & Field, gold watch, and a firm on :
Kearny street, "H.S.& C 0.," $30.
Beck confessed that he worked the game
himself, and said it was the, "softest snap"
he had ever struck. v .;> Detectives Gibson
and Wren recovered $305 of the money he
had received as the difference between the
amount of the checks and the purchases,
two diamond studs, a' gold 1 watch, a dia
mond ring and a diamond locket. 3
3 Beck is 42 years I of age. and about ten
years a_o kept ; a restaurant at ; Sixteenth
and Valencia streets." For some time he
was a waiter at the university, where; he
gained the knowledge that enabled him to
carry out his swindling scheme. . . ,
The letters have the type-written head
ing, "Students' Boarding Club, Encina
Hall,. Stanford ; University," which of it
self,: the police say, should have aroused
the suspicions of the dealers.

NEW COURSING PARK.
It Will Be Located Near the Ingleside
"â¢"" Track â The Interstate
Club.
Coursing is now assuredly becoming a
popular pastime and it goes without say- !
ing that within a few years it {, will
be one of the leading features of 'outdoor
sport, provided, of course, that the meet
ings are carried out in a straightforward
manner. ' * â¢
It is now a settled fact that a new cours
ing demesne will be opened to the public
in the very near future. A gentleman
prominent in coursing circles said yester
day that a piece of ground which is most
suitable for coursing purposes and which
is situated within close proximity of the
Ingleside racing track had been leased for
a term of seven, years for a coursing park,'
and that men will be working on its con
struction within a few days. ;
A nine-foot fence will be erected around
the park and a grand stand, which will ac
commodated 2000. people, will be built in
a suitable - location, where the spectators
can see every course from start to finish.
The ground is half a mile in length and
a quarter of a mile in width, which is suf
ficiently spacious to guarantee splendid
coursing. It is said that the first meeting
will be held in the latter part of April and
that racing will result on every Sunday
subsequent to the inaugural meeting of
the club, which will be known as the In
gleside Coursing Club.
The Interstate Coursing Club met last
evening and settled all business matters
connected with its lat â¢ meeting at Newark
Park. President DominÂ»ck Shannon made
a few brief remarks in which he eulogized
the officers of the club for their untiring
efforts in bringing about such a successful
meeting; he hoped that the sport of the
leash would remain untarnished, and
stated that it was the duty of each mem
ber of the club to instruct the sport-loving
public to uphold dean sport.
The Interstate Club will hold its second
race meeting at Newark in; April, and a
grand day's snort is guaranteed to all
sportsmen who attend.

STANFORD SUIT IS ENDED.
Judge McKisick Says There Is
Nothing Further to Do hut Bow
to the Decision.
REVIEW OF THE 810 CASE.
May Be Other Forms of Procedure
Under Which the Stockholders
Might Be Made to Pay.
In speaking of the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in the suit to
recover from the estate of Leiand Stanford
the proportion of the railroad debt to the
Government 3 represented by Stanford's
stock Judge McKisick said :
"That ends it, so far as this case is con
cerned. I am accustomed to fighting a
cause to its furthest limits, and when.it is
decided there to suomit. This case was
decided by the unanimous judgment of the
eight justices who heard it. A rehearing
can be secured only by one or more of the
concurring Justices changing his mind.
That was done in the income tax case. I
do not think it will occur in this case.
Therefore I say the decision settles the
matter so far as this action is concerned.
' "There are many people, however, who
believe that tne Government â¢ has good
claims that may be collected under a dif
ferent course of proceeding. Some people,
laboring under a misapprehension of the
facts, were inclined to criticize me for
bringing the action in the form that it
took.- They did not seem to know that I
had nothing to do with the institution of
the suit. The Attorney-General brought
the suit and I was enlisted to conduct it.
My duties were definedâ they were to prose
cute this particular action.
"No, I have no opinion to express in the
matter. It would be very improper for me
to criticize the decision. Neither have I
anything to say as to any other form in
which proceedings may be brought. lam
only calling attention to what others have
said about it.
"The claim upon which the suit just
decided was brought was filed in May,
18&4, against the Stanford estate asa stock
holder of the railroad company under the
laws of the State of California. The claim
was rejected by Mrs. Stanford in July,
1894. â :'â :: 'v*-.^ ;-â -: â â -,-â¢â -..
"The action could not be brought until
the bonds matured, which occurred in
January, 1895. Within two months after
that time, as required, the Attorney-
General began the action, and in March I
was appointed to conduct it here.
"There had been no attempt to prevent
the distribution of the Crocker or Hopkins
estates, but this action prevented the dis
tribution of that or Stanford.
"I have no doubt that the action was
brought in perfect good faith, and it was
carried forward and presented to the
United States Supreme Court for all it was
worth by Hon. Holmes Conrad, Solicitor-
General, and Mr. Dickenson, Assistant
Attorney-General. In their presentation
of the case argument made before the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
was included.
"The theory of the Government in argu
ing the case was that there was a contract
between the United States and the Central
Pacific Company; that the contract on
the part of the railroad company was
made under and by virtue of its California
franchises. It is a plain principle of law
that a corporation cannot make a contract
without the power , so to do, and that it?
power is the franchise derived from its
sovereign ; State the State that created it
by charter or under the general laws
of the State. And the theory of the
Government 3in this case was that
when ' the Central Pacinc Railroad Com
pany of California went to Washington
and entered into a contract with the
United States to build part of its : trans
continental line it carried its charter with
it to Washington, and as that charter ex
isted under the laws of California those
laws * were written into the charter as par
ticularly and specifically as if the Legisla
ture had chartered the company by an act
incorporating all those laws into the char
ter. The constitution and statutes of Cali
fornia in existence when the contract was
made with the Government expressly
provided that each stockholder of a rail
road corporation should be ] individually
and personally liable for his proportion of
the debts and liabilities of the corporation.
"The Supreme Con of the United States,
as I gather from the newspaper report of
the opinion, took the view that there was
no : contract before the court to "be con
strued, no laws of California to be con
strued, but simply the Pacific Railroad
acts. And as they could not find a pro
vision in either of those acts imposing in
dividual liability upon the stockholders of
the railroad corporations mentioned in the
acts, the court conclusively presumed that
Congress did not intend to hold the stock
holders of the California corporations lia
ble for the debts which they owe to the
Government."' -

UNDER THE FIRE
OF THE COUNCIL
Miss Overman Stands the
Test of Cross-Exami
nation.
IS CALM AND COLLECTED.
Declares Now That She Has
Only Extreme Pity for Her
Former Hero.
DR. BROWN IS SERIOUSLY ILL.
Attending Physician Says the Rev
erened Gentleman Is Threatened
With Paralysis.
If the five hundred or more spectators
gathered in the lecture-room of the First
Congregational Church yesterday expected
to hear Miss Overman contradict herself,
hesitate before answering pertinent ques
tions, or if pressed too closely seek refuge
in hysterics they were doomed to disap
pointment.
Altogether, the witness was on the stand
something like five hours, and though she
was led through a perfect labyrinth of
questions she stood the cross-fire of her
examiners without the least outward evi
dence of mental disturbance.-
Whenever the young lady was in the
least doubt over any question propounded
she did not touch the quicksands of un
certainty, but tripped lightly to the safe
ground of "I do not remember." If by
chance the question was a little too per
sonal she would parry it with another, and
in that would generally rest her answer.
It was twenty minutes after 2 o'clock
when the council filed into the lecture
room and assumed their accustomed
places on the platform. Deacon Morse
asked the privilege of stating that Dr.
Brown was too ill to appear. He would
not ask that the council postpone
its deliberations, but would be willing that
Attorney Nagle should look after his in
terests. On motion this was readily agreed
to.
Miss Overman then assumed the witness
chair, and in response to a question as to
what became of the original letters re
plied that they had been thrown into the
ash-barrel in the back yard. The letters
which Miss Overman claims that she
forged at the instigation of Mrs. Davidson
were '.ben read. Judge Advocate Wood
hams stated to the council that he would
indicate such passages as had been in
jected into the letters at the request of
Mm Overman's erstwhile friend.
During the reading the witness listened
to the damaging charges she had made
against Dr. Brown with apparent calmness
and absolute indifference as to what the
people or the council might think of her
strange, not to say peculiar, utterances.
Miss Overman said that the letters had
been changed not in words but in spirit.
These alterations, however, were of a
purely immaterial character and made no
difference as to their direct effect in her
alleged relations with Dr. Brown.
During the reading of one letter it de
veloped that Miss Overman was much giv
en to bicycling during her last days in Ta
coma, tut she neglected to say if she had
taken to bloomers as well.
During the reading of the third letter to
Mrs. Tunnell this paragraph occurred: 'â¢_
can plainly see that B. does not wish to see
or hear from me." Miss Overman was
asked if this had appeared in the original
and without the least hesitancy replied
that it had.
At this stage of the proceedings the wit
ness produced a letter, or rather a portion
of one, said to have been written by Mrs.
Tunnell disclaiming any knowledge what
ever of the famous Overman-Tunnell let
ters. On cross-examination, the young
lady gave as a reason for not reading the
full letter that she wished to save, her
friend the burden of reporters.
It was brought out during the afternoon
that Miss Overman assisted Dr. Brown in
his study, and also in his studies. She
helped him prepare sermons and lectures,
but was not very clear as to what com
mentaries she had consulted during this
eventful period. She admitted that this
Work in the study caused her former pla
tonic friendship for the pastor to ripen
into deep-seated affection, with the result
that her reverend friend has been nearly
ruined thereby.
She said that Dr. Brown never recipro
cated her affection in the slightest so far
as she knew, though she naively admitted
she had vainly hoped he would. She did
not attempt to reconcile this hope with
Mrs. Brown's position as the wife of the
object of her unsolicited affection.
Miss Overman admitted, under pressure,
that she had told Mrs. Thurston of her
high regard for Pastor Brown, but de
clared with great empbasis that her con
fession extended no further than this.
Mrs. Thurston might have urged her to be
careful, but of what she could not recall,
because she had never told that lady that
Dr. Brown reciprocated her love. The
witness also disclaimed, with a smile, that
she had ever confided to Mrs. Thurston
that she was the sunshine of the pastor's
home. ;" '->'-;. v'*;-
At this stage of the proceedings Miss
Overman said that.' altogether too much
stress was being laid upon her love for Dr.
Brown. It was not a wild, absorbing pas
sion which dethroned her reason, but a
calm proposition which she had at all
times had under her control. She ad
mitted that she had hoped that the doctor
wonld hug and kiss her, but had given no
thought as to what would follow such a
demonstration.
Mr. Tenney wanted, to know if Dr.
Brown had ever taken her in his arms or
even squeezed her hand. The witness re
plied with a smile that she was sure he
lad never done the former. He might
have given her a warm pressure of the
hand because he was that kind of man,
but if he had it. was of a purely platonic
character.
She could recall only one occasion when
he had ever touched her further than a
mere handshake. "I was lying down on
the sofa,"said the witness, "when he passed
by. The doctor tapped me on the head
lightly, saying, as he did so: 'Are you
tired, little girl?' "
At the evening session Delegate Williams
put the witness through a severe cross-ex
amination. He asked her among other
tilings if she had not felt for some time
that her feelings for Dr. Brown bad been
such as no virtuous woman should enter
tain toward a married man. 'Miss Over
man replied with much apparent indigna
tion that she had felt no such thing. ; She
admitted, however, that she did not wait
for the pastor to tempt her, but fell of her
own accord;
Mr. Williams led her through a long
lane of misty, hazy questions, covering
that period I beginning . with the meeting
on Pine and Kearny streets December 19,
and ending with her entry into the doc
tor's study the same afternoon when , the
alleged blackmail of Mrs. Davidson was
revealed to her. Mr. Williams wanted to
know if the old feelings came back in the
darkness of the room. The witness, how
ever, did not get an opportunity to reply
to this, for Dr. Pond entered a serious ob
jection to what he termed peculiar and un
necessary cross-examination, and said if it
was continued he would certainly with
draw from the deliberations of the council.
Rev. Mr. Sirik wanted to know what her
feelings toward Dr. Brown were now.
"Sincere pity, and that only," was the
reply.
Miss Overman admitted that it was
Mrs. Tunnell she met after that famous
visit to the Chronicle office, though she
declared that her friend knew nothing of
the object of that call. She confessed that
the explanation she gave to Mr. Simp
son later on was false, but her reason for
doing this was that she hoped Mr. Simp
son had forgotten the minute details of
her first appearance in his office.
The witness said that the money which
took Mrs. Tunnell to Tacoma had been
furnished by her. It came from her sister,
who often helped her when in need. At
this stage of the proceedings tne moderator
announced that he had been called to the
bedside of Deacon Frank, who was very
ill, and that the council would adjourn
until _ o'clock to-day.
Between the afternoon and evening ses
sions Dr. Hoyt, Professor Foster and Deacon
Morse visited Dr. Brown, with the view,
first, of ascertaining his exact condition,
and, second, to secure his co-operation in
securing the presence of Mrs. Tunnell be
fore the council.
Dr. Hoyt announced that Dr. Brown
was a very sick man. He was suffering
from loss of memory, accompanied by
severe pains in the head, and that the at
tendant physician, Dr. Palmer, had assured
him by telephone that the reverend gen
tleman was threatened with paralysis.
Dr. Brown, however, did not think the
situation quite so bad as that, but de
clared his intention to be present at to
night's session of the council.
The pastor said to Dr. Hoyt that noth
ing would please him better than to have
Mrs. Tunnell testify. Miss Overman was
the only person, he said, in his household
who had heard from this important wit
ness, but he did not think that even she
knew the lady's present whereabouts. A
'week ago she was staying with a Mrs.
Tansey, 921 Olive street, Los Angeles, but
had since left there. A telegram was sent
to this address last night by Dr. Hoyt, at
the request of the pastor, in hope of find
ing some trace of Miss Overman's com
panion and confidante. At a late hour last
night nothing had been received from Mrs.
Tansey.
Miss Overman will resume the witness
stand to-day and it is thought that her
cross-examination will consume the entire
afternoon session.
The committee on charges will meet to
day at 1 o'clock. Mrs. Cooper is expected to
produce the witness she intends to offer in
rebuttal, though the nature of this testi
mony will not be given to the public at
this time. The meeting of the committee
yesterday resulted in producing nothing
new in the way of evidence against the ac
cused pastor.
HER LETTERS.
Mattie Overman Points Out to the
Council the Portions She Says
Were Interjected.
The Cold spell had not the slightest effect
upon the attendance at the Dr. Brown in
vestigation yesterday afternoon. The day
was not only cold, but gloomy as well.
The ground-glass windows on the west
side of the meeting-room were closed and
the ostrich and chanticleer plumes of the
women spectators stood out in inky black
silhouettes against the dead gray light
that oozed dejectedly through the win
dows.
There was a constant babble of conversa
tion, which, strange to say, was not ail
i about the Brown case, and when the gas
was lighted at 2 p. m. and the yellow glare
struggled with the frosty gray light, the
scene was not unlike that of the dress cir
cle at a theatrical matinee.
There was a vacant place in front facing
the middle of the platform, and the four
cane-bottomed chairs that stood there ren
dered more conspicuous the absence of
their usual occupants â Dr. and Mrs.
Brown, Miss Mac Davis and Mattie Over
j man. The late comers among the audi
! ence or congregation or whatever it might
be called ranged themselves along the
* wall almost out of sight and altogether out
[ of mind, like unblooming chrysanthemums
i in the shadow of a summer hedge.
At 2:20 o'clock Mattie Overman walked
from the council-room to tne platform
and took her seat in the wicker-chair near
j the front, and facing Judge Advocate
Woodhams. The members of the council
took their places immediately afterward,
and after the usual announcements had
; been|made I. H. Morse stated that Dr.
Brown was unable to appear, he not being
! well, and that he (Dr. Brown) had author
j ized Mr. Morse to say that he agreed that
â¢ the examination and cross-examination of
! Miss Overman mieht be conducted in his
i absence.
Judge Advocate Woodhams produced a
page of a morning paper containing what
purported to be conies of letters written by
MiÂ«Â«s Overman to Mrs. Tunnell, and asked
Miss Overman whether she had marked
in pencil those parts of the letters which
she had interjected or remodeled by advice
of Mrs. Davidson.
Mr. Dodge asked as to the whereabouts
of the original letters for which the letters
in evidence had been substituted, and Miss
Overman replied that after having written
and changed them to suit the purpose of
the blackmail conspiracy she bad torn up
the originals and thrown them into the
ashbarrel. She explained that the letters
which were about to be read were those
which she had put back into the envelopes
and replaced in Mrs. Tunnell's room.
Mr. Woodhams then proceeded to read
the letters, pointing out as he came to them
the passages marked by Miss Overman as
having been interjected or remodeled by
her. In the first letter the following par
agraphs were pointed out:
Do not fear. The moth will not flutter about
the flame in this case. lam prepared to prove
my strength, and feel competent to carry out
any plans that may be developed. * *â¢:'*
Have no fear for my life. As long us B. lives I
shall. I think he owes me that; aud don't feel
that lam doing wrong in insisting on justice
from him. Understand, my dear friend, I con
sider this my opportunity for a higher educa
tion and calmly consider what can be done, for
I have the will to do it. lam not angry or in
sulted or. ashamed to rise above such a spirit,
proving my womanhood in all I do and say.
In the next letter, dated June 18, 1895,
Matties interpolation is that she was dis
appointed that the party referred to could
not see "8.," but she supposed he pur
posely avoided her.; The writer promised
to explain later why she thought so. ,*/.
; Miss Overman interrupted by saying
that Mrs. Tunnell had seen T Dr. Brown,
but that the interview was of a different
nature from that which the letters might
seem to imply. ~
Mr. Woodhams continued with the read
ing of the interpolations.
She said he seemed altogether changed and
that he told her he had a noble, good, dear wife
and every one knew that to be true. He asked
her if I was keeping company with any one,
and he tried . to make me , believe that he felt
sorry. She said she believed that he regretted
everything and that tnere was great weakness
some place. *â -.'â¢ * My heart is filled with re
bellion that I should" be so. played with, so
scorned, and the end is not yet. There is a
tragedy ahead ; my heart Is hardened. To put
him to the test I immediately wrote him for a
small sum and he refused it. . Had be sent it I
would have been in San Francisco by this time.
When I went to their house I was enjoying the
sweet presence of the Holy Spirit and as I grad
ually yielded to him 1 lost that Spirit. Goo. for
give him. * * * He knows only one side of me.
Oh, 1 think of such men standing before the
people, pointing at the right path, pleading
for virtue and teaching morality! It makes
me sick. He shall help me constantly in the
future. He has ruined my life and has made a
toy of me. â 
Mr. Tenney asked whether there was an
original letter bearing on the same subject
which made it possible for Miss Overman
to interpolate and change part of it.
The judge advocate suggested that that
inquiry would be part of the cross-exami
nation. 'â ' 77:7 7
"That is the trouble," said Mr. Tenney,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1896.
"we have no letters with which to com
pare them, and we must carry all these
things in our heads."
Mr. Wood hams proceeded with his read
ing of ; the alleged interjected parts of the
letters. .
I will live at Dr. B.s, and if objections are
raised he will have to be responsible for my
education. '.**â¢ * 'â '* I. perhaps, will arrive
there about the first of July, and we will meet
again there, and you may be able to convince
me of the error of my ways. Don't say to any
one that lam coming back there ; let us keep
it a secret until I have time to get there.
The next interpolations were in the let
ter dated Tacoma, June 21, 1895:
I am glaa you see. as I do, that - Dr. Brown
owes me something. That which I have given
him can never be repaid, and 1 am shocked
that he, at times, does not seem right. - * * *
He has been surrounded by his enemies in the
churchâ Mrs. French, for instance. Did Mrs.
Davidson suggest anything to that effect ?
* * * Now I have determined that I shall
never allow any demonstration from him of
any kind. I was wrong ever to have allowed
it, ana I shall never allow it any more. * * *
I have written to BÂ» for $20 and have â¢ not yet
received an answer. 1 think he will send it.
If not I will raise it otherwise.
The following is an alleged remodeled
portion:
F. wrote me that she was greatly annoyed at
B. when she last saw him ; that he looked well
and had no trouble, and was getting along
nicely. * * * If you see B. and he asks you
what I want money for tell him everything,
but advise him to send it.
Under date of June 26, 1895, the follow
ing alleged interpolation occurs:
I can borrow $20 at any time of a lady friend
who knows nothing: but thinks much of me.
* * * You said if I had the daring to go
ahead and do what I proposed, or something
like that. lam afraid I have too much daring
to always act wisely, arid I will not again re
main away from San Francisco on his account,
and when I get there he will know it. God
permitting, I will be there ere â  long. Yes. I
can get enough vouchers for character. The
doctor will do whatever I wish. * * * My
heart's best love is trampled and slighted and
1 am not worthy of so much as his recogni
tion, i could easily go into utter collapse and
hate every man on earth. If it were not an or
dinary threat I would make it. * * * I trust
some day you may meet B. and learn that he,
at last, has risen higher and that he is happy.
Let me know this.
The judge advocate read the following
from a letter dated July 24:
I can plainly see that B. does not care to see
or hear about me, but you better not say any
thing about it. . /-â ":-'.'â â â '-
At this juncture Attorney Nagle asked:
"Is that interjected?"
"It is not so worded," replied Mr. Wood
hams. 7y. *'â¢â ;
"it is the original?" inquired Nagle anx
iously.
Miss Overmanâ sir.
Mr. Nagle gazed at the back of Miss
Overman's head and made no further re
mark. â¢
Under date of August 1, 1895, the fol
lowing interpolation was read:
Very kind of him, don't you think? Lulu
said in her letter that when she was there she
thought him infatuated with the captain's
wife. * â¢ * Â» He is a cad and I don't think
anything of him. . "777
The following was read as having been
remodeled: #
Now I Judge by the papers that things are
warm for a certain party, and soon there will
be no fat salaries to maintain a figure-head in a
certain society. * * * So far as loving a cer
tain party any longer, I will not do it any more.
* * * I have thought B. strong and deter
mined to live true to himself, and to God first
iof all. : * * * How I pity him in his weak
ness, perhaps hereditary from a long succession
of lustful forefathers. There is no life in the
religious skeleton called the church. It is im
possible to teach morals and practice bestiality
at one and the same time. * * *
I will return to my trouble. . I don't think I
can come right away. I shall wait proceedings
there. Yes. a little while will determine things.
Don't avoid any onejon my account anymore.
Don't be afraid to speak your mind. lam sur
prised at 8.., knowing how much he Is in my
power, that he would dare to act so. He must
bo out of his mind * * *; I cannot go unless
I get my fare. It should come from 8., but, be
ing absent, 1 cannot force matters.
This ended the reading of the letters.
In reply to a question hy Mr. Tenney
Miss Overman said that she had received
one or two letters from Mrs. Tunnell since
the date of the last letter read and that
there was also a letter printed in The
Call dated February 11. Mr. Logan of
The Call had received the original of
that letter, but he could not hnd it.
J. \V. Logan was sworn and testified that
he had placed the letter among his papers,
and when he made search for it he could
not find it... Mr. Logan went on to say
that The Call had secured an interview
with Mrs. Tunnell on the evening of Jan-,
vary 9 at Visalia, and this interview was
published in The Call of January 10.
Mrs. Tunnell saw Jo P. Carroll, Visalia
Correspondent of The Call, the next day.
and gave him a written statement in the
shape of a letter which he telegraphed to
The Call. The original letter came by
mail and was handed to Mr. Logan, who
accidentally lost it.
Mr. Woodhams read the report of the in
terview. He then introduced a portion of
a sheet of notcpaper, the top of which had
been torn off. lie said that it was a por
tion of a letter received by Miss Overman
from Mrs. Tunnell.
Mr. Tenney expressed his opinion that
it would not be proper to receive a portion
of a letter in evidence.
Moderator McLean asked Miss Overman
whether she was in possession of the other
portion of the letter.
"I am not," replied . the witness, "I am
sorry to soy. Wishing to save Mrs. Tun
nell from being hounded by the reporters,
I destroyed it." " ,
Mr. Tenney suggested that there might
be in the destroyed portion of the letter
statements which might directly bear
against the person in whose favor she was
testifying. "Shall we receive that which
is in favor when the other is against?" he
asked.
' Mr. Fond reminded Mr. Tenney that
Miss Overman was under oath. "She
makes oath that this * comes from Mrs.
Tunnell. It seems to come with whatever
credibility attaches to Miss Overman's
sworn statement." â¢
A vote was taken, and the council de
cided to receive the mutilated letter by a
vote of 11 to 4. pESjglggjglluAjl
The letter was then read. It expressed
the hope that everything would come out
all right with Miss Overman and the
doctor, and adds: "Of course, you and I
know those letters you wrote me were
changed. I have no idea who could have
taken them, unless you did. You felt free
enough to take them if you wished. They,
were never in Oakland, surely."
"What's the date?" asked Moderator
McLean.
"There is no date on it,' ! replied Judge-
Advocate Woodhams. ']';
"They were dated the 10th of February,"
said Miss Overman.
Another letter purporting to be from
Mrs. Tunnell to Miss Overman, under date
of February 20, 1896, was offered in evidence.
Miss Overman said that it was enclosed in
the same envelope with; the mutilated let
ter and was addressed to the editor of a
morning paper with the request that Miss
Overman might have it published in that
newspaper if she deemed-; proper. The
witness did not send it to the paper speci
fied. The letter was a brief note purport
ing to refute the testimony, of Miss Cooper
to the- effect that Mrs. Tunnell had been
secreted in Dr. Brown's house. Mrs. Tun
nell said that there was no' authority for
that statement.
i Lawyer Nagle asked : "Did the destroyed
part of the letter contain any reference to
the subject matter of the part that you
have produced or to this case?"
"No," was the reply. "There were some
names in it which I didn't care to have
made public."
Mr. Tenny asked whether the witness
did not destroy the other part of the letter
containing the address for the purpose of.
shielding Mrs. Tunnell from being sum
moned before the council.
â¢ "My desire was to shield her from re
porters and inquisitive people who might
pursue her," ' continued 'Miss Overman.
"1 would like to have ' her here. . She does
not want to come and I won't force her to
comeâ that is, I won't â¢'" request her to
come," hastily added the witness. 3 ;â 
â  Moderator . McLean asked the witness
whether she was willing to give the council
the address whence the letter came.
"If I can remember it I will," was the
reply. .'"lf I have it at home I will.'*
This contradicted her statement made a
few moments before that she had destroyed
the other part of the letter. Then she
added: "As soon as I learn her address I
will give it to the council. 'V ;
7 She ; said ; that she received s the letter
pefhabs" a week ago, and that she destroyed
the missing part of it two or three days
ago.
'â¢Have you written Mrs. Tunnel! any
letters since she went away?" asked the
moderator. * n * --* â¢ â¢-â â â¢-â¢-- \
"I have written her a few," was the
answer. â¢""'-â "* r T- 3;3- '777-
"How of ten?"
"Only two." '333/ :
"To her directly or through friends?"
"Through friends."
"Have you learned her address through
her friends?'' .;.
"I learned her address a short time ago
for the first time since she has been away
for certain, but she said she was going to
move immediately.'' v . - *
"Is there any arrangement between yon
by which you can communicate with her?"
"Yes. A friend wrote for some things
and I sent the letters through this friend."
Mr. Tenney asked if she would object to
give the council the name of that friend.
;"I would," was the reply, in a very de
cided manner, because she knows nothing
about the case at all.'!
Mr. Tenney remarked that there seemed
to be a great deal of mystery on the point
regarding the whereabouts of Mrs. Tunnell.
What was called a cross-examination was
then begun. She was asked for the title
of the books which she read while on the
trip to Tacoma with Dr. Brown, and she
replied that one was "The Blythedale
Romance." by Hawthorne, and a copy of
the current number of "The Arena."
"Here is a witness very vital to the
case," said Mr. Tenney. "Now, the ques
tion is, have we the right to find out as far
as we can the reliability of this witness
and her past life. I should like to ask
some questions along that line. I would
like to ask with reference to your life
previous to your coming to San Francisco
what your occupation was?"
"Dressmaker," was the reply in a faint
voice.
"Yes, madame," pursued Mr. Tenney
with a courteous smile; "and your -busi
ness was followed in what place?".
"Helena, Montana; Tacoma, Seattle. I
began at home."
She replied to another question that she
was bom in Alsea Valley, Oregon.
"For whom did you work in Tacoma?"
inquired Mr. Tenney.
"For a great many 'different ladies; I
could not name them all. It would be im
possible."
"Did you work for any establishment
there?"
"I never did." -
"You were never employed by Mrs.
Lynch in Tacoma?"
"No, sir."
"You are very sure of that?" .
"Perfectly sure." ''-.-*: "I* â¢
"Do you know Mrs. Lynch?"
â  "I met Mrs. Lynch just before I left
Tacoma." * ; :*: :y
--â¢ "Did you ever do manicure work in Ta
coma?" --/< -,-,-â  .- â *.
"No, sir." . '3" : 3' : '.
"Did you in your dressmaking work ever
have occasion to solicit custom from wo
men of ill repute in Tacoma?"
"I never did."
"Did ycu ever go into any of their
houses for the purpose, of soliciting cus
tom?"
"I never did; never."
"Never did any work for them?"
"No, sir." :
Mr. Pond asked: "Was your work
brought to you, or did you go to families?''
"I went to families."
"Have you ever been married?" asked
Mr. Tenney. .**â¢â¢
"I have."
"How long ago!"
"In May, 1885."
"Were you divorced?"
"I was." '
"Did you secure the divorce?"
"I did."
"On what grounds?"
"On the grounds of non-support."
"How long ago?"
"I forget. I think it was in 1889."
' She proceeded to say that the court al
lowed, her the privilege of resuming her
maiden name. She came to San Francisco
for her health and not for the purpose of
seeking business.
"Where did you live when you first came
to San Francisco?" was asked.
"I have forgotten exactly; 1 was not well
at the time."
She had known Dr. and Mrs. Brown in
Tacoma, and she went to make dresses for
Mrs. Brown about the first of August, and
she remained there through the pressing
invitation of Mrs, Brown. When she be
came an inmate of that home she did not
make any more dresses. She had been
kindly invited to remain there until she
got well and she stayed there four months.
About that time she became interested in
the Allen lectures and attended them five
nights in each week for thirty weeks. Mrs.
Tunnell used to see her on board the cars.
"When did you become strongly at
tached to Dr. Brown ?* '
"Not until after I began staying at his
house. I assisted him in his study in
looking up references and reading to him
sometimes when he was tired."
"How frequently in the week was this
assistance rendered?"
"Well, sometimes in the morning, some
times not for two or three days at other
times every morning. The study was in
the front room on the second story, over
the parlor. It opened on the hallway and
opposite Mrs. Brown's bedroom."
"Was Mrs. Brown ordinarily in that
part of the house?"
"She was in her roomâ in and out. Not
always in her room, but passing back and
forth."
"Did it not occur frequently that her
duties on the first floor would call her
downstairs while you were with Dr.
Brown?"
"Possibly. Mrs. Brown did her sewing
in the back room on the same floor."
"Was Mrs. Brown in and out of this
room all the time while you and Dr. Brown
were there?" asked Lawyer Nagle.
, "She was at liberty to come in and out
as often as she chose," was the reply.
"Did she?"
"Yes. The doctor made all his sermons
in the morning. He was never in his study
in the afternoon. He went out." ..-;./
"Will you give us the nature of some of
these references?" asked the Judge Ad
vocate.
* "That would be hard, because it is over
a year. I could give you the names of
some of the books."
"Well; give them."
Mr. Nagle here called attention to the
fact that it was 4 :30 o'clock, and requested
the council to adjourn until 7 p.m. He
wanted time to prepare for the cross
examination.
The council refused to grant the request.
Miss Overman named " Cowles En
deavors," " Smith's Dictionary of the
Bible" and . "Smith's Dictionary of An
tiquities" as some of the reference books
consulted by her.
"How much of the morning used the
doctor to spend in his study? " was asked.
"All the morning from 8 o'clock until
noon. He was away from home in the
afternoon, and he used to return just be
fore dinner at 6 o'clock. I assisted him a
very few times in \he evening. Sometimes
he worked till midnight. 1 He was always
a very hard worker."
"Were you in the habit of making trips
alone with him to the seaside or the Cliff
House or the park!" 3 :.
â "I never did. â  I did with him and his
wife." - .*3: -.3*. ; ' *
"Do you remember any special instance
when you went alone with the doctor to
any place in this city?"
"No, sir; not at present."
Moderator - McLean % asked: "Is ;it '.'â  not
correct that Mrs. Thurston warned j you to
lie careful about thinking too much of Dr.
Brown, and you made some reply that
led her to think that you thought a good
deal of him?" 3 . .
; "Yes; that was correct." .3 3 ; ,
"That you looked upon him as a hero;
that he was a different man from any you
had ever associated with?" v
il "I don't think I said that. I was never
associated with a minister before. was
expressing ' my admiration * for Dr. Brown
and she advised me to leave the doctor's
house."* '*."â â '-,â¢:.',-â¢ *,*.*- â ;â¢â ,â¢'â¢ '-ââ â :â 
Mr. Tenney asked: "You stated that
he interviews; and the companionship of
'he doctor in' the study were what led up
o that?" r
"Did I say that? I : think it quite likely
that it encouraged that feeling."
7 "What was there in the work that en
couraged that feeling?" .
"I don't know." . ;
, "And the fact that you saw him con
stantly?"
"I suppose so.'.'
"What was his attitude?"
"Very kind." 3
"Any expression on his part of any un
usual interest in you? -Didn't he indicate
to yon a reciprocity of your feeling, not in
words, but in a subtle way that a woman
would understand?"
"I ÃBed to hope at times that his kind
ness might mean a little more." |
"You never had any intimation on his
part that your admiration was recipro
cated?"
I "No,- sir." <'3 .:â â >â¢:-, 3
"How did you dare, then, to write him
that letter which you- said you wrote to
him expressing your admiration for him?"
"I wrote him how much I missed his
home! I didn't tell him that I . loved
him."
"You said you hoped his attitude meant
something. What did you hope that it
meant?"
.* "I don't understand what you mean. It
is very natural to hope in such a case that
one's feelings should be reciprocated."
"How did you expect to reconcile that
hope with your regard for Mrs. Brown?"
"I didn't expect to reconcile it."
"You are perfectly sure that that hope
never came to any assurance in your mind
that there was the desired response on the
part of Dr. Brown
"I am perfectly sure of it."
"Is it an ordinary thing for a lady to ex
press a warmth of feeling for a gentleman
without some warrant for it?"
"I didn't express it."
"You expressed it in a letter?"
"Yes, I expressed it in a letter. I don't
think it is usual." .
"And your affection was so great that
you could not contain it without express
ing it?" - â  v
"I don't think that you ought to put it
that way. It was indiscreet, I admit. I
received a book from .Dr. Brown, and the
marginal notes were very familiar: so
homesickness came over me and I ex
pressed myself too warmly in that letter."
"Did you ever tell any one that Dr.
Brown reciprocated that affection?" .
"Never." :
"Can you explain then how Mrs. Thurs
ton got that idea and expressed it?"
"What was her expression?" 7*'.i 3
"You said that you told Mrs. Thurston,
and that Mrs. Thurston advised you that
the man who would express himself in
that way toward a woman meant no good
to her."
"It is human nature not to let a person
think that you are doing a thing altogether
foolish. I might have allowed her to
think that he possibly reciprocated, and
that possibly there was some reason for it."
Mr. Woodhams here read from the trans
cript of Mrs. Thurston's testimony the
following: "She has told me time and
again how he has , professed his love for
her, and told her that she was the sun
shine of. his home." Did you make any
remarks of that kind?
"Not in regard to Dr. Brown."
"And that Dr. Brown could not preach
well unless she was in the congregation?"
continued Mr. Woodhams, reading . from
the. transcript. .
"I never did say that," responded Miss
Overman tartly. "I am not quite an
idiot." * â 'â  . 33;-' 7i
By Mr. Sinkâ How do you reconcile your
answer to that question with the answer
you gave me when you answered no to
my question whether you had surrendered
your character, mentally, with the wish
that your love might be reciprocated with
all that would naturally follow ?
"It is quite natural when one is in love
with another person that you should hope
that it might be reciprocated. I think
there is too much stress laid upon this. I
was not wildly nor passionately in love
with Dr. Brown. There was nothing wild
about it.
"Might not a woman admire a man for
intellectual attainments, even though he
is a married man, without it being
wrong? .; . . ;.:â¢*.Â«
'â¢I have admired other ministers, but I
never came in contact with ministers be
fore or with a man like Dr. Brown."
â¢ "You felt," suggested the moderator,
"that it was not really the right thing to
have this feeling for Dr. Brown on account
of the regard you had for Mrs. Brown?"
- "Yes." â ;: 'â¢â  3^l '
"You said on one occasion that you
wished he would nave bugged and kissed
you?" . .v-*v. r
"Probably."
"What would you have done?"
"I don't know what would have oc
curred. I have no idea. I hope that I
would not do anything wrong, and 1 don't
believe Dr. Brown would."
"Did you have a feeling tnat you strug
gled against somewhat?" inquired Mr.
Pond, soothingly.
'â¢Yes; at times."
By Mr. Tenneyâ Do you state emphati
cally that Dr. Brown* never took your
hand ; never took you in his arms?
"He never took me in his arms."
"Ah! but he took your hand?"
"Yes; but not secretly."
"Was not that clasp of the hand expres
sive of a very kindly and special feeling
for you? Didn't he reach back and take
your hand while you were walking with
him and Mrs. Brown?"
"1 have no recollection." .
"You never told Mrs. Thurston so?"
"I have no recollection."
Miss Overman said that on one occasion
she was lying on a couch in a room in the
presence of Mrs. Brown when Dr. Brown
came home. As he passed the couch he
patted her on the head and said to Mattie:
"Are you tired, little girl?"
"When I was in Tacoma," resumed Miss
Overman, "I worked very hard, and Dr.
and Mrs. Brown knew that. All of my
money was given over to the support of
my heme and I was often deprived of food
that I really needed on that account. I
bought a piano and paid for it myself and
I paid for my sister's music lessons."
Mr. Hatch asked why, if public intimacy
between Dr. Brown and Mattie did not
exist in Tacoma, she did not think it
would be discreet for her to arrive there on
one day and Dr. Brown on the next day?
She replied that the doctor was well
known and she was well known in
Tscoma, but that it was known among
her friends that she was residing in ' the
doctor's house. She explained the
watch incident by saying that she had
lost a watch given her by her sister and
that Dr. and Mrs. Brown presented her
with a gold watch.
At half-past 5 a recess was taken till
7 P. M.
EVENING SESSION.
Miss Overman on Cross-Examina
tion by the Councllmenâ Mr.
.3. Merchant's Testimony.
While waiting for the arrival of Miss
Overman Joel Merchant was called to the
witness-stand and his testimony was
drawn out by Examiner Woodhams.
Witness said he had been on the vesti
bule committee and was also on the door.
"While acting in that capacity you had
an . opportunity of . seeing * many persons
pass in and out and also those who were
introduced to one another?" , -#
"Oh, yes, sir." _Â ..
"Did you ever notice Dr. Brown and
Miss Overman or Mrs. Stockton alone in
the church?" * : ; -'v
;.;' ' 'I') never did. In fact, he was here,
there and everywhere, and it would be
hard to keep track of those with whom he
stops to converse."' '^^pSÃMÃnaiSEfeÃ^
"Did you ever see Dr. Brown introduce
Mrs. Stockton to any member of the con
gregation?" * ....
. "Not that I can recall."
. "How about Mrs: Davidson?" . .
: * "I heard him (the doctor) introduce
Mrs. Davidson i by saying that: 'This is
Mrs. Davidson, our second Mrs. Cooper.' "
3 On cross-examination by Mr. Dodge, the
moderator, and the Rev. Mr. Tenney wit
ness * recalled that Dr. Brown * called on
Mrs. Davidson as late as last December to
make a few remarks or lead in prayer
at the weekly meetings. ,3: .:;>,. ;
; ' Mr. â  Merchant 3 repeated -3 himself 3 em
phatically -in .the matter of not having
seen Dr. Brown .and Miss Overman or
Mrs. Stockton alone in the church at any
time. ; ; . 'â ' â ' 'â¢. ' 333-:.
"I wish, to repeat that I never saw Dr.
Brown in the church alone with any
woman except his wife on any occasion.
And I think I know as much about him as
any man; I have been out riding with
him and .; about the City in his company
many times. No, I never saw him with
Mrs. Stockton ; or Miss Overman on the
street. I am on the street a great deal, and
very often meet the pastor, but never
have I seen him with any woman to my
definite knowledge or remembrance."
While waiting for the arrival of Miss
Overman the council withdrew to private
chambers.
An idea of what took place during the
secret conclave of the council was fur
nished the audience when Dr. Hoyt, in re
sponse to a request of the moderator, ad
dressed the council and audience concern
ing the condition of Dr. Brown.
"He is very much prostrated and his
physician, Dr. Palmer, fears there are
symptoms of incipient paralysis. He. is
suffering from severe pains in the right
arm and right leg, and there seems to be a
loss of memory. The chances, the phy
sician says, are about even whether he is
able to go on with the trial to-morrow
night or have it postponed tor one week.
Unless there should be a change for the
worse, however, I â¢ think we can confi
dently expect to have the doctor with us
to-morrow night at this time."
Miss Overman had arrived during the
reassembling of the council, and having
taken her seat on the rostrum in her cus
tomary attitudeâ face to the council
and half back to the audience moder
ator suggested that in order to. facilitate
the cross-examination and expedite the
proceedings it would be wise to let the
council members proceed with their ques
tioning of the witness in alphabetical
order. â *'.'â¢
The scribe noted the suggestion.
D. C. Williamsâ l would like to ask Miss
Overman previous to . her journey. I
understand, Miss Overman, that prior to
your journey there was considerable com
ment about your taking the proposed trip
with Dr. Brown to Tacoma. Were you
not advised that ' your reputation was at
stake, and that if you were indifferent
there was likely to be unpleasant conse
quences to Dr. Brown?
. "There . never rose a question in my
mind," was the reply.
Did not Mrs. Thurston raise a question?
Yes; she spoke about it, I believe.
â¢ Were there not at this time rumors about the
alleged relationship existing between you and
Dr. Brown? â â 'â â¢ -â : â "â 
Not to my knowledge.
Did not Mrs. Thurston and Mrs. Davidson
refer to those rumors?
They may have done so, but as long as Mrs.
Brown did not see anything out of the way and
urged my going with her husband I certainly
could not be expected to see any wrong in the
trip.
You talked . with . Mrs. Thurston and Mrs.
Davidson, did you not?
Yes; I asked Mrs. Thurston's advice. But
she did not insinuate that she thought there
was anything wrong in my relationship with
Dr. Brown.
Then you accepted the escort of Dr. Brown
on that trip? -:."-'.'.*
Yes, sir.
You were aware that your feelings were not
such that you should had entertained for a
married man? â¢*' ..**'. *
I thought a great deal of Dr. Brown, without
thought of his being married.
What were your feelings toward Dr. Brown?
I think they would have been hard to define.
Did you ever say that you wished he could
squeeze your hand?
1 may have made that remark once.
You were despondent, then, when he did not
make those advances?
I did not say so. .
Was there not a time when you felt offended
that he did not did not squeeze you hard,
and otherwise demonstrate a warm feeling for
you?.
,No; I do not know that there was; my pride
may have been hurt, as that of any other
woman who may have felt under the circum
stances.
Did not Mrs. Thurston bring forth the best
reasons and advice against your going to
Tacotna with Dr. Brown?
It depends on how one feels about those
things. ' â -'g-ffBgBBHraBaB
Were your feelings toward Dr. Brown in
creased or lessened during your journey ?
: I don't know. .;.;â * .*
â¢ Did you teil him that you wished he did not
have a wife and children and that the caresses
he bestowed on them might belong to you? '
I don't know. I don't think I ever expressed
such a feeling.
On your returning to this City did you write
him? ; *
Yes, sir.
Did you frame any such thought in your
language as that given above?
I may have expressed my-Â«elf warmly.
Your" letters, then, were full of warm senti
ment? ;
Yes, sir.
Which do you wish us to oelievo, that Dr.
Brown made improper advances to you or that
you threw yourself at bis feet?
1 do not wish you to believe either.
At this juncture Dr. Pond Interrupted
the cross-examination by saying that the
ground had' been all gone over. Con
tinuing be said: "If this thing goes on I
feel that I must resign. We have had all
this thing before and I can see no use in
making the witness iterate every para
graph of her testimony."
The moderator opposed Dr. Pond's ob
jections and referred the same to Judge
Advocate Woodhams.
3 Mr. Woodhams said: "While the ex
amination is not strictly in accordance
with the rules laid down in such cases,
and while I would check an attorney in a
like course, I have much preferred to
leave it to the discretion of the council."
Mr. Moderatorâ Mr. Williams says he is
leading up to important points.
The objection was sustained and Mr.
Williams proceeded with his questioning
leading up to the letters defamatory of
Dr. Brown.
Then anger was your motive for writing
those letters? was asked.
Yes, sir. But mostly at myself.
You were angry with yourself, then, for hav
ing committed yourself In your feeling toward
your pastor?
Yes, sir. v Â»
Did not this feeling of anger Influence your
feelings on your return to San Francisco?
I did not say so.
Did you not so testify on direct examina
tion? .
Not quite.
Are you not sure that this feeling influenced
you rather than Mrs. Davidson to blackmail
Dr. Brown?
I am sure it did not.
Then you carried on this scheme until you
found that your own character was involved?
I did not wish to go any further, as I have al
ready explained. . ......
â¢ In your letters to Mrs. Tunnell did you not re
fer to wrongs done you by Dr. Brown?
You speak of those letters as though they
were the originals. "â  i"..-;:". . '-
Yes, ma'am.
a Then I don't acknowledge them to be such.
Did you ever write Mrs. Tunnell anything
about Dr. Brown doing you wrong.
I never did.
i Did you write Mrs. Davidson about your let
ter to Dr. Brown?
I never did. â¢
Did you not tell Mrs. Davidson that you
wished to spare him (Dr. Brown)?
It may have come out in conversation.
Did Mrs. Davidson place any great depend
ence >in her blackmailing scheme upon your
testimony regarding your illicit relations with
Dr. Brown?
Not so much what I would say as upon the
letters which were to be used as evidence.
You were relying upon your ability to prove
the authenticity of those letters?
Yes, sir. \ â¢ -.*
If the letters were not authenticated the alle
gations would fall to the ground ?*.'-*â 
, Yes, sir.
Did she represent that if you did not assist
her she would be hopeless of success?
â  Yes, sir. : -
Did she make you believe that if you drew
out of the scheme she could do nothing with It ?
; â  No. sir. ' --.-â ;- ."
, What power did Mrs. Davidson exert upon
Dr. Brown, to coerce him into the payment of
the money except through the threat that she
would expose the improper. - relations you
alleged you had with him ?
C J think i that . anyminister i would be fright
ened at the threat she made to Dr. Brown. Â
- â  You say she adopted this plan without know
ing Whether you would confirm or deny the
truth of her charges. ',
;* She did, evidently, for she did not tell me
anything about it.
T- Did Dr. Brown give you any reason why he
did not ask ' you if you would sustain these
charges against him before he paid the money
to Mrs. Davidson?;
I do not believe he did. I will correct that.
His reason was that if I was guilty for him to
ask me about it would put him still ; more In
her power.
He did not come and ask you?
* ;â  No, sir.
â¢: . Was it before or after he *. knew you would
deny such a statement that he had Mrs
Davidson arrested?
'â¢â¢. After. ,v

her at the corner of Pine and Kearny
street; that school was out at 4 o'clock;
that the day was storm y; that they walked
up Pine, street to: Mason, then to the
church and that it. was light when they
arrived at the church. The witness could
not tell how long they were in reaching
the church, nor whether there was a light
in the doctor's office while they were in it.
The examination then continued:
Did you find the old-time feelings returning
while you were in the office?
No, sir. â¢ â ;- .â¢â¢-â¢Â».â¢*â¢.' 7.
Your anger and sense of wrong all had
vanished?
I don't think it would be natural that I would
be thinking about those matters.
What produced so great a change in your
mind with reference to Dr. Brown?
You don't seem to understand that my re
pentance was sincere.
No, I don't.
Evidently not.
Was it dark when you left the church?
It was not dark.
How long were you in the office?
Possibly five minutes.
Did you know who supplied Mrs. Tunnell
with money for her journey when she left?
I did.
Has any question risen in your mind whether
your last explanation of these Tunnell letters
as made before this council would not be be
lieved?
I am astonished that all the people have not
believed it.
Mr. Williams here announced that he i
had the Weather Bureau report for the I
19th of December, and stated that it showed
that the 19th of December was rainy and j
foggy; that it rained through the after
noon and all night; that there was a new
moon on the 15th; that on the 19th the
moon was three days old and that the sun
set at 4:55 P. M. "This closed his ques
tioning.
Rev. Mr. Sink then asked the witness j
how she felt toward Dr. Brown, and she
replied that she had only "sincere pity"
for him. He continued the cross-examina
tion as follows:
In view of what you have done and or the
trouble you have occasioned, are your feelings
so strong with pity that you would be willing
to do most anything to protect Dr. Brown?
My feelings are such that I will tell the truth
in the matter.
You are not making misstatements as a par
tisan to defend Dr. Brown?
No, sir. _ ; ,",
You would tell the truth, no matter what its
effect would be?
I would. ..
Are you a Christian?
I try to be. I don't like to say so because it
would sound ridiculous to say so under the
circumstances.
You believe in a future life?
I do, sir.
You believe in the existence of an all-wise
and heart-searching God?
Yes, sir.
Do you believe that in that future life there
Is to be an accounting given of the deeds of
this life?
I do.
Do you think that at that time the state
ments* you have made here to-day would have
remained unchanged?
Yes. sir. . _ .
Did Dr. Brown furnish you with the money
for your schooling?
Not to mv knowledge.
Tenneyâ Did Mrs. Davidson furnish the
money for you to go to Tacoma ?
No. sir.
Did you occupy the same section with Dr.
Brownon that trip ?
Yes, sir. *
Sinkâ When you went to the Chronicle office
to sell a certain story you met a woman when
you came out. Was "that Mrs. Tunnell ?
After considerable beating about the
bush the witness finally admitted that
this woman was Mrs. Tunnell; that she
had me from. Mrs. Tunneli's to Mrs. Da
vidson's, and then to the Chronicle office.
She iurther stated that Mrs. Tunnell
knew nothing of the nature of her errand
to the Chronicle office. The witness fur
ther admitted that she paid a visit recently
to the Chronicle office accompanied by Dr.
Brown and attempted to make Mr. Simp
son, the city editor of that paper, believe
that her original errand was concerning
more the sale of other writings of Mrs.
Davidson than the story of the scandal,
but that her effort failed', as Mr. Simpson
was emphatic in declaring that his recol
lection and hers of that incident were
widely different.
She excused herself for attempting to
make Mr. Simpson believe something
wh'efi she knew was untrue by stating that
she could hardly be blamed for attempting
to protect herself the best way she could
under the circumstances. Rev. Mr. Ten
ney continued the cross-examination as
follows: 33*333^33
Is Mr?. Tunnell Mrs. Baddin?
it is folly to think such a thing. She is not.
MrÂ«. Davidson is Mrs. Baddin.
What was it that ally led you to believe
that your first explanation of the Tunnell let
ters was not satisiactory?
I heard rumors that people believed I was
not telling the truth in regard to them, and
Dr. Brown came home one day and said he
ha/1 not read the letters until that day and
asked me whatever induced me to write those
letters. I then retired to my room and de
termined that! would tell the whole truth in
regard to them.
Did not Dr. Brown say to you, "If that ex
planation (meaning the first one) goes to the
council it will never satisfy them in the
world"?
Dr. Brown said he could not imagine what
could have induced me to write those letters. .
You had no conference with him about the
letters'.'
No, sir; he never heard the full explanation
of those letters until it was made in the pres
ence of Mr. Woodhams.
You are fully convinced that that other ex
planation would not be believed?
I felt that only the truth would do, and I de
cided to tell it,
Do you know how your letters to Mrs. Tun
nell were obtained lor publication?
1 have no positive proof of how they were
- obtained. Information came to us in a letter
recently that they were found in a satchel in
Mrs. Tunnell's room and taken to an attorney;
I do not remember the exact details; they
were correct as published in The Call a few
â¢lays ago. The attorney would have nothing
- to do with them and . they took them to the
Examiner. This information came to us in a
' letter unsought.
Did you make a second attempt, after the
one you told us of, to secure the letters?
I made a second attempt after I left Mrs.
Davidson. I went to 1041 Mission street and
either the landlady or the landlord, I forget
which, told me Mrs. Tunnell had gone and
taken everything with her. Then I went to
Oakland, at Mrs. Eaton's, and found Mrs. Tun
nell just- ready to go out. When she left I
looked Into her trunk, but failed to find the
letter?.
Was the money you furnished to Mrs. Tun
nell furnished to you by anybody?
I have a sister who always helps me when I
am in need.
Did she furnish the money to you? â¢
Yes, sir.
Did you have any conversation with Mrs.
Tunnell in the presence of Dr. Brown before
she went to Mrs. Eaton?
Not a word.
Is Mrs. Tunnell's reported statement, that
she could not stand up for Dr. Brown, well
founded.' . . . . * .... ...
I don't see what foundation she had for that.

Mr. Finerty is lecturing under the aus

will speak in Butte and on the 17th in
Anaconda.
He has the reputation of being a fluent
and able orator. He has been a war cor
respondent during Indian troubles in the
Northwest, and altogether has had an ail

almost any work.
He is a large, distinguished-looking man.

Several of the gentlemen are members
of the Knights of the Red Branch, in
which organization Mr. Finerty is a
leader.
"I believe that Ireland should be abso
lutely free," said Mr. Finerty, "and this
is what I am advocating in all my ad
dresses. I take the widest view of it. It
should be as free as this country is. Eng
land should have nothing to do with it
whatever."
Mr. Finerty will speak on -'Robert
Emmet" in connection with giving his
views on the Irish question, to-day being
the anniversary of the birth of the patriot.
Mr. Finerty says he will touch on the
general phases of the Irish question, the
condition of the country and the people as
existing to-day and their hopes for the
future. He says home rule does not meet
theft-equireroents of the case. England,
he claims, has not even the shadow of a
claim to Ireland's allegiance.
He was here once before, in 1881, and re

THE OFFICE-SEEKING HORDE.
Harrison Says It Makes the Position
of President One of Many Trials.
At the beginning of every administra
tion Washington fills up with persons who
desire some office either in' the States, in
the departments or in the foreign service,
writes ex-President Harrison in March
Ladies' Home Journal, discussing "The
Presidential Office." Many of these per
sons have a limited purse, and as the days
pass on this is exhausted, and impatience
and ill temper come in. Many of these
persons are deserving and well ' fitted to
fill the offices they desire. But it is impos
sible to-find places for all the deserving, and
position of the President is full of trial.
The suspense and uncertainty that the
office-seeker suffers is' illustrated by
the case of a man from my own State who
thought he had good reason to expect an
appointment from President Garfield.
After he had been weeks at Washington,
and had brought to bear all the influence
he could command, I met him one day on
the street and asked him how he was get
ting along. His answer was, "Very well,
very well, but there is nothing focal yet."
It was wonderfully expressive, and has re
mained in my memory as a type of the
state of uncertainty, which accompanies
office-seeking. "Nothing focal yet," but a
hope that is hard to kill. Â»
There are few offices at Washington the
salaries of which enable the incumbent to
save any money, and the average ex
perience of those holding places in the
departments, I am sure, is, if they would
express it, that private business offers
better returns and gives a â¢ better chance
for advancement.
A DEEAM DISOOVEEY.
Mrs. Borer's Vision Helped a Scientific
Man to Ilia "Missing Link."
A very curious instance of what may be
called thought transference, or telepathy,
was related recently and is unquestionably
authentic, since: the narrator was herself
the medium through whom a very strange
bit of lore was communicated to a scien
tific man, whose most persistent researches
in that direction had failed to discover
what he sought.
. Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer related the in
cident. She was at the time sharing a
summer cottage in the woods with the
Cushingsâ Cushing of the bu
reau of ethnology of the Smithsonian In
stitution and his wife. They were domi
ciled in one of those camp lodges, where
the partitions between the rooms are only
about eight feet high and serve merely as
a screen since they do not obstruct ventila
tion, conversation, nor (it seems) the cir
culation of that subtle current which is
commonly called "magnetism."
Mr. Cushing was occupied in the prepa
ration of a history of "The Evolution
of the Arrow.' ', There was a gap in the
chain of succession which he seemed un
able to till. . It came between the "throwing
sticks" of the mound-builders and the Tar
tar arrow, and a diligent search failed to
find the missing link. This worried him
greatly. His .perplexity had been the
subject of conversation one evening be
fore the family separated for the night.
"Of course, we couldn't be of the least
service," said Mrs. Rorer, '/only, to sym
pathize; but that we did most heartily."
She continued in these words: "I fell
asleep as soon as I was in bed, and then I
had a strange dream. Some one came to
me. I seemed to know he was a venerable
man, but I cannot describe him except as
a presence, though I saw with absolute
distinctness what he held out to me. It
was a bow and arrow, different from any I
had ever seen. The bow was bent some
what after the manner of the Tartar bow,
but the lacings were peculiar. They were
crossed to form a six- pointed star in the
center. 'What does that mean?' I asked.
And the presence answered: .'The four
points are the four directions of north,
south, east and west; the other two som
bolizo the upper and the under worlds.
The arrow passes over them all in its
flight, and, crossing this star, is sped on its
way with the blessings of the gods. This
is the arrow you seek.'
(|"Then I stretched out my hand to take
it. The vision vanished and I awoke. As
I opened ray eyes I heard the stroke of a
match, and 1 saw its flash in an adjoining
room. I knew by that sign that Mr. Cush
ing was awake, smoking and worrying
about the missing link. I called out that
I had just dreamed of â an arrow, and told
him what; I, had seen. When I came to
the lacing of : that â  bow '; and its meaning
his excitement was great, for the whole
thing proved to be exactly what he was in
quest of. â 
â¢â¢In some mysterious way the revelation
which his alert, anxious, active brain
could not receive had been brought to my,
mind as I lay, passive asleep. That arro
went into the history, and ever since, be
cause of that dream, I have regarded my
self with a certain pride as a sort oi latter

FAVORITES SNOWED IN
Ricardo at 25 to 1 Headed the
Odds- On Choice Lobengula
Home. -
HIDAGO THE LONELY FAVORITE
The Hot Favorite, Cabrillo, Beaten Out
by Ike L, a 50 to 1 Shotâ Bra
Scot Wins Again.
The downfall of snow and the , corre
sponding tumble of mercury worked a
most chilling effect on the favorites at the
Bay District yesterday, and it will be some
weeks before numbers of the talent get
thawed out. Of all the favorites sent to
the post Hidago alone was the only one
that finished in front. The most startling
upsets were the defeat of the 1 to 3 favor
ite Lobengula by the 25 to 1 shot Ricardo,
and the taking into camp of the 1 to 2
choice Cabrillo by Ike L, a 50 to 1 outsider
in the betting. The ring was little winner
by the dumps throughout the day, for the
majority of the winners received consid
erable backing.
The splendid showing of Lobengula on
Thursday last, when he finished second to
Vinctor in a seven-furlong run, made the
second event on the card yesterday, a six
furlong spin, look a veritable Cakewalk for
the brown horse, especially as there was
little class to the company opposed to him.

The bookmakers thought that way, and
held him a3to 1 chance. When the bar
rier was raised, Chevalier on Ricardo, a _.>
to 1 outsider, was quickest away, and
heading the favorite throughout, won at
the wire by a long neck. Highland was a
poor third. '.'_*"_-
The second hard knock backers of . o ,"'
priced horses received occurred in the hfth
race, a seven-furlong combination over the
inside course. On class Cabrillo looked
away and above the best and 1 to 2 was con
sidered a liberal price. The odds-on choice
was unable to shake off the 50 to 1 shot,
Ike L.who keot him close company during
the trip, and in a hard drive succumbed to
the prowess of the rank outsider by half a
length. The winner was ridden by Joe
Piggott.
Five started in the mile handicap, with
Rey del Bandidos ruling a slight favorite
over Braw Scot at post time, the three-year
old closing at Bto 5. Chartreuse II made
the running to the stretch, where Barney
Schreiber's gray took the lead and in a
drive with the favorite, who came fast the
last furlong, won by half a length. Char
treuse II was third. .
The opening event was a five and a half
furlong scramble, with eleven starters.
Coleman and Red Bird was in the greatest
demand, but neither managed to show.
University, an 8 to 1 choice, led from the
jump, running easily from Sligo, with
Jack Atkins finishing in the show.
The black horse, Hidago, opened a 1 to
2 favorite for the mile and seventy yard
event, but the crowd were now a trine shy
of hot choices ana he went back in the
betting to 15 to 20. Of the other nine
starters, Trix was the one that commanded
the most support. ; Charmion and Tar and
Tartar led the procession to the stretch.
Straightened for the wire, Coadv, on Char
mion, hugged the rail, while Shields on
Tar and Tartar, turned wide, taking the
better going, being soon joined by the
favorite. In a ding dong finish, it took
Chorn's best effort on the favorite to beat
the 10 to 1 outsider half a length at the
wire. Charmion was a close third.
The concluding five and a half furlong
scramble was captured by Mainstay at 10
and 12 to 1 in the betting, who took the

lead when the barrier was raised and won
romping from Toano, the; second 'choice.
Babe Murphy, the 4 to 5 favorite, failed to
get a mark. _________

This is the last day at the Bay District.
To-morrow Ingleside track will reopen ,
with an excellent programme and ."Ladies'
day" as the attraction. . ...*.
The Montana â  turfman Pierre Wibaux
was very successful in bis ventures yester
day. He backed University, the winner of
the opening race, extensively and got
aboard the outside Ricardo.
The poor showing made . by Collins, who
was heavily played to get the place in the
second race, caused the judges to ask an
explanation as to the cause of it. Coady,
who rode the gelding, said , his mount was
cut off by Highland just as the barrier
was raised, throwing him out of the race.
The boy was exonerated from any wrong
doing. â  â¢ â  . _.
In his preliminary gallop Agitato pulled
up lame, and was excused by the judge,
twenty minutes being allowed the ring to
make a new book.
Josh Ward, an exercise boy, was severely
injured while galloping a green two-year
old yesterday at the track. At the" first
turn of the inside track the youngster
i bolted to the outside fence, and jamming
the lad's leg against it caused a bad frac
ture below the knee. He was taken to the
French Hospital.
Mainstay, winner of the last race, en
tered to be sold for $500, was bid up to
$1500 by Ed Wallace, the bookmaker. His
owner bid an additional $5, but was una
ble to "find" the run-up money during the
specified time allowed, and the horse was
again put up at auction. There was no
bidding, and the animal rightfully reverted
to the association. The owner was let off
with suspension until the amount ot in
debtedness, $705,' is paid the Jockey Club.
After a flying trip to Chicago and several
of the Southern cities, Edward Corrigan
arrived in the City last evening. Mr. Cor
rigan states that great interest is mani
fested among the managers of the differ
ent Western and Southern tracks in regard
to tbe|workings of the Australian starting
gate, and thinks its adoption on the ma
jority of them but a question of a very
short time.'
ONE PRACTICAL CHARITY
What the Youths' Directory Has
Accomplished in the
Past Year.
Report of Rev. Father Crowley That
Is at Once a Record and an
Appeal for Support.
Following is the annual report to date of
Rev. Father D. 0. Crowley of the Youths'
Directory, submitted to the Archbishop
and the members of St. Joseph's Union:
Since the Ist of March, 1895, the Youths*
Directory has offered shelter to 461 children.
Many of them were sent to us by parents and
relatives, a large number by members of St.
Joseph's Union, and not a few were received
from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children or were taken from the streets.
Four or five came to us through St. Vincent's
Asylum and the various aid societies.
Below Is presented a table showing the num
ber entered upon our books during each quar
ter for the past twelve months
March 1, 1895, in Directory 58

Total.. 414
There are therefore forty-seven remaining in
the Directory.
A glance at the first division of the list
printed above will show that our work has
widened month by month, entailing larger
demands upon us for room and money. We
are restricted by lack of room. The accommo
dations of the house will not allow of our lodg
ing more than seventy-five boys at one time,
and even that number uncomfortably over
crowds our space. We did think at one time
that 100 lusty lads could be conveniently con
fined within an area of 70 by 175 fee; of City
property, but that idea has long since been
abandoned. As we have explained our limit
of efficiency has been reached in our present
quarters, and the work must stand still until a
larger house can be obtained.
It is incredible that in a State as wealthy as
California an institution li_e the Youths'
Directory, which is unique of its kind on the
coast, should long need money wherewith to
extend the work of saving the little ones and
forming good citizens for the community. We
are confident that we thall not find the people
of the State less generous and charitable than
they were when nearly ten years ago the pres
ent home at 2030 Howard street was built.
Last year was rather hard for us. The bad
times rendered many of our kindest friends
unable to assist us as much as they nad
hitherto done or as much a., they would like
to do. But 189l> promises to bring more pros
perous days for them, and' consequently for
the Directory, and there is -no fear for the
future. However, we cannot get along with
out their earnest co-operation. Neither State
nor City has ever granted us the slightest ap
propriation, and we depend for support en
tirely upon the voluntary offerings of the mem
bers of St. Joseph's Union, together with occa
sional donations from the charitably inclined.
It will please you to learn that the children
have enjoyed excellent health since last March,
thanks to the intercession of our holy patron,
to whom we are indebted for innumerable
favors.
Our visiting physician, Thomas L. Mahoney,
M.D., Attorney Matt I. Sullivan, Frank I. Kane
of the Pacific Coast Society for the Suppression
of Vice, Officer Coleman and Mr. Holbrook of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, merit honorable mention and our
gratitude for many services rendered during
the past year.'g-j^iMi'llJlli -,
In conclusion we thank the â¢sacrificing
solicitors and members of St. Joseph's Union,
through 'whose efforts and generosity our
mission has been made fruitful. God, who
loves the poor and helpless, will reward them
a hundred fold on the last day.

CALIFORNIA GOODS.
Complaint That County Institutions
Discriminate Against Home Products.
The following is a copy of "a letter sent
out on Monday by the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association to each county
Board of Supervisors:
Gentlemen: The fact has been brought to
the attention of this association that in a num
ber of county institutions throughout . the
State the schedule of supplies required dis
criminate in many items against California
manufactures and products and in favor of the
Eastern article.
The particular subject to which our attention
has been called is that of pharmaceutical
preparations for use in the county hospitals.
There are many cases where, in calling for cer
tain items, the name of an Eastern manufac
turer of that particular item is given, and in
such cases, as tin schedule calls for & certain
â¢make (and that Eastern), the bidder cannot bid
on California articles.
There is manufactured in California as high
a class of pharmaceutical preparations as are
produced in the United States, and in view of
this fact we feel fully justified in addressing an
appeal to every citizen of California, and es
pecially to the public institutions of tne State,
to arouse; a. loyal, home feeling and State pa
triotism for pharmaceutical as well as every
product of California. manufacture. We ask
that this be done in all cases where prices and
quality are equal.
If. among the schedules! lssued periodically
Dy your board for pharmaceutical preparations,
groceries, stationary or any other class of sup
plies, there are items specifying an Eastern
brand we? most respectfully request that you
look Into the subject, and : hope you will de
termine to change the specification . so as to
give ; the preference to California manufac
tures. ",.Â« ,<***-- â¢.'-â .->;.--
We hardly think it necessary to â¢ call your at
tention to the good that can be done to the in
dustries of the State of California if all the citi
zens and institutions, both public and private,
would adhere strictly to the line of "Patroniz
ing borne industries, price and quail tv equal."
You can readily see that it would i result in re
taining within the ; State, and â¢ causing to be
circulated at home, a large amount of money
which would otherwise help to enrich another
community. . v v v
Trusting that this matter will receive the
consideration at your hands that ! its import
ance deserves, I am, for the association, yours
truly, , L. R. Mead, Secretary.
THE A. P. A. CONVENTION
Delegates of the State Council
Meet at B'nai B'rith
Hall.
DELIBERATIONS IN SECRET.
Address of President Hudelsonâ
cess of the Order During' the
Past Year.
The third annual convention of the State
Council of the American Protective Asso
ciation met at B'nai B'rith Hall on Eddy
street yesterday at 10 o'clock.
President B. F. Hudelson called the con
vention to order and appointed the differ
ent working committees. There were 222
councils represented, with 500 delegates,
many of the lodges sending their full
quota of three delegates.
The utmost secrecy prevailed regarding
the proceedings of the convention, no re
porters being permitted to penetrate
farther than the door of the building. A
press committe appointed by the president
gave out the meager news of the session.
Following is the address of President
Hudelson: .
To the Officers and Members of the State Council
of the American Protective Association of Cali
fornia, Greetingâ Friends: Another State Coun
cil year of the A. P. A. is closing, in conse
quence of which we meet to review the work
done and plan for the work to do. An unseen
hand and all-seeing eye has led and guided us
in our efforts and undertakings and in all of
the relations we bear our loved American in
stitutions until patriotic hearts stand ready to
admit that our Government, in every depart
ment where the influence of our order has
been felt, is more honestly and efficiently ad
ministered. An abiding confidence in what is
to be the result of the great patriotic uprising
of our people Is more noticeable as the days |
goby.
One year ago we were invited to assume j
the great trust and responsibility growing out I
of 'he office of the chief executive of the â¢
A. P. A. in and for the States of California and
Nevada. We accepted with a hesitancy which
ever grows out of an appreciation of one's own
inability, and whatever the result of our labor
may be we have comforting consolation in the
consciousness of having done our whole duty
at all times up to the measure of our ability as
we saw and understood that duty.
Soon after entering on the discharge of the
duties of the office to which I had been pro
moted I recognized a danger confronting us I
which threatened our overthrowâ a danger |
which could be averted only by true Amer- |
icans appreciating the greatness of our cause j
and the weight of their responsibilityâ a dan- |
ger growing out of the -following conditions :
State, Congressional and county elections had
resulted in the selection for various political j
positions of men who owed their election to the
vote of our friends. These men were just en
tering upon the discharge of their various offi
cial duties; we were congratulating ourselves
on victory; much was expected of those to whom
we had willingly and gladly given our suffrage,
and many of our friends were to meet a disap
pointment for which they were not preparedâ a
disappointment that was occasioned by men
violating their sacred promises to adhere to
the principles and practices of purity. Others
displayed a willingness to convert our beloved
order into a patronage club, hoping for per
sonal gain, while designing political manipu
lators had seen and learned something of our !
strength and were ready to take advantage of j
the â  situation and make tne most of every j
point that would assist in the accomplishment (
of the disruption of our councils, they realiz- |
l ing that our success would be their "Waterloo." j
This class of individuals were relentless, j
We found them in our council meetings, on i
; the streets and in our committee gatherings. I
i The time seemed opportune for the accom
; .plishment of the purposes of dishonest and de
signing men. It being a year when there were
â¢ no general elections in our State and nothing i
i of a character which breaks the monotony of
routine work, to hold our friends : in- solid |
phalanx and nerve them for the Internal bat- i
tles which for a while "seemed inevitable was a j
task of no small proportion. Upon my shoul
ders, as State president, rested a responsibility
which all but caused me to shrink; but believ
ing in American patriots and the justness of i
our cause and the security of our principles, j
and realizing that I was not alone, I was \
nerved to meet and face the conditions, and j
not because of my efforts but because of the j
self-sacrificing spirit of our friendsâ because of I
the determination which ever characterizes i
men who are lifted above self by the demands i
of a great causeâ we come together to-day 600 ;
delegates in this State meeting, instead of 150 i
as one year ago.
The argument of the great patriotic gather- |
ing, such as we are permitted to witness on
this occasion, is clear and convincing, proving !
beyond cavil and doubt mat the American |
Protective Association Â£as passed the danger j
lines of 1895 and with some victories that en
courage and assaults that stimulate she comes
into battle trim for . the great campaign of
1896â rested, encouraged and ready and anx
ious for the affray. We believe that agitation
wisely directed will accomplish the settlement
of any political question. Believing this we
have endeavored to force the discussion of the
questions in which we are particularly Inter
ested. So successfully has this been done that :
the foremost issues confronting the citizens of I
California to-day are the ones occasioned by
"boss" and "boodle" rule in politics and j
Roman Catholic attacks on our American in- !
stitutions and encroachments on the great un
derlying principles of our Government. We as |
an order occupy the first place among the
States of America in respect to aggressive work I
along this line. It is encouraging to our f
friends and discouraging to our enemies to l
know that while differing often upon what !
may be considered important questions under
other circumstances, and affected locally by '
questions and conditions of a peculiar local I
character, causing momentary discontent in
some few councils, we are united every- i
where and aggressive on the main
and vital issues. The relations that
have existed and are existing between
the State office and the subordinate councils
have been marked with kindly interest, cor
diality and courtesy. I have visited as many
of the councils as I could owing to the amount
of work to be done and the time in which I
had to do it; have given over 200 addresses,
very many of them being public; have rather
professed to be the forerunner preparing the
way for new councils than to be the organizer,
believing that our work as State president was
to mold sentiment and leave the work of or
ganizing quite . largely to organizers, being
persuaded that they were better acquainted
with the men of their localities, respectively,
there would be less danger of bad men getting
into the councils as charter members. In al
most every instance the wisdom of such a
course has been manifest, and here permit me
to make special mention of the faithfulness
and the wiedom of the organizers who have
worked with me so â  self-sacrificingly . during
the year now closing. To demonstrate that
the work of organizing new Councils has been
made a special feature : I mention the fact that
eighty new councils have been instituted, and
all of them, with one exception, are in good,
healthful condition. We have revived a num
ber of councils that ; were dead at the begin
ning of the present State Council * year, and
they are now in line and active; have called
in the charters of three councils and have sus
pended none. From the best information that
we can obtain our initiated membership will
not fall much, if any, below 50.000. .
' We â¢â  have occasion, . therefore,' for great re
joicing to-day. With the : exception of i small
dissensions, which affect us locally only, we
are united and strong. - Never has the enemy
to any organized effort worked* more persist
ently and unscrupulously to disorganize than
lias worked the enemy of the American Pro
tective Association. ; The footprints of aggres
sive work upon the part of our enemy are dis
cernible every where.
We have been called* upon to behold some
things in high places within the last 'few
months which cannot be brushed aside, and
which are calculated' to awaken the Ameri
cans who have slumbered on during the tre
mendous agitations of the past few years. We
have seen representatives in the hall? of our
National legislature branding as un-American
and inhuman leffortsI efforts to; separate church and
state by cutting off all appropriations for sec
tarian institutions. We have : witnessed - the
sad spectacle of : seeing . the unwritten law of
America, which has governed heretofore in
the appointment of ' officers *in the army and
navy, set : aside without ; a , blush, excuse , or
apology. We have seen a *.â¢ man who, a* hench
man, to Pope Leo XIII,, fought against Italian
unity in the Garibaldian wars and | for | the
Popeâ who came to the United 1 States at the
instigation ; of ; Archbishop Hughes and t for
thirty . years drew a ) salary from our Govern
ment, without being a citizenâ picked up by
President Cleveland, thrust forward over the
heads of thirteen colonels in the United States
army who were his seniors lin rank and made
a brigadier-general in the United States army
and confirmed jby * the United Spates j Senate,
oyer a vigorous protest," with % but seventeen
dissenting votes. We have seen military com
panies and regiments forming under the stars
and stripes, making a membership in the Ro
man Catholic church a necessary qualification'
for enlistment, receiving orders that emanated
from the Clan-r a-Gael, ; secretly plotting and
planning under the pretense of freeing 're
land. We have seen priests testify in courts of
record without oath or ' affirmation being ad
ministered, free speech assaulted and our
country's flag torn to shredsâ and yet some
would say that the time is Inopportune for an
American organization such as ours.
Friends, in the â  face of great ; and pending
issues, the , face of that which we have been
called upon to behold, where doth our duty
lie? We cannot do ; the work that remaineth
by * congratulating ourselves over some few
small victories . 1896 is a year which will pass
down into history and be accorded a place
which makes it distinctive, because of intense
political activities. * We stand before the peo
ple on the grandest platform of principles that
has ever been formulated. We have directly
and by implication made great professions and
promises, and the time is at hand when we
will be given an opportunity to prove our sin
cerity. We have no principle that can be
abandoned; none that can be compromised,
and he, who, as an A. P. A., cannot rise above
self, and above party prejudices and party en
vironments, if the time comes when our order,
standing for principles which underlie it,
clashes with his political party, is not worthy
to be counted with us. In fact, he is with us
for party or personal advantage only, and cares
not for our perpetuation as an order. To be a
political organization, such â¢as ours, and
not a political party, ,is difficult. Com
posed of men who have heretoiore affili
ated with the various political organizations
it will of neessity require a self-sacrificing de
votion to country upon our part to be enabled
to forget party and be willing to vote for the
nominees of that political organization against
which we have pitted. ourselves in the years
running up to the present rime. Yet this is
one thing that we must.be willing to do if we
are true to our obligations, where in the
judgment of our order it is for the best interest
of our cause and country for us to do so. Some
of the dangerous rocks around which, we must
steer will be found in that desire for patronage,
upon the part of some of our members which
makes this subject one that supplants prin
ciple. Should the time come when patronage
not principle, actuates us we are on the thresh
old of disintegration and in the throes of death.
Our weakness has been and will be found first,
in our failure to realize the force and cunning
of our enemy; second, in our Inordinate desire
for numerical strength and consequent loose
ness in admitting members; third, in allowing
our personal prejudices and preferences to In
fluence at times when the individual should
merge into the order for the good of a great
cause. i^B_S__
We cannot study too carefully our weakness,
for the order or organization that studies well
its weak points builds most substantially for
the future. This is a critical moment in tne
history of our country. The leaders of the
Romanists are aggressive, cunning and deter
mined. They realize that the struggle is on
and that it is one which means the ultimate
defeat of the Roman Catholic church in the
politics not alone of the United States, but of
the world, or the overthrow of her opponents.
They recognize, furthermore, that if tney can
succeed in defeating or disorganizing the
American Protective Association in so doing
they shall have won a victory the tidal wave
of which will place upon our statute books
laws conferring privileges such as exemption
from taxation of certain properties; secure
continued and additional appropriations for
their institutions; divide the school money
and enable the church to dominate and direct
in the distribution of patronage to her own
advancement until her every post and posi
tion will be so strengthened that her political
power will be almost omnipotent. Hence the
critical moment. Rome's victory is America's
defeat.
I deem it fitting at a time like this to direct
your attention to needed State legislation, and
how best to accomplish it. Before another
State Council convenes we shall have elected a
Legislature in California; during the time that
will elapse before that election our attention
will be given very largely to the Presidential
campaign. We should never lose sight, how
ever, of the very important fact that some of
the questions in which we are most interested
as citizens of California are questions that
properly come before our State Legislature for
settlement. I am fully persuaded.that the
school law of California should be so amended
as to require a uniform standard in the exami
nation of all applicants for teachers' certifi
cates and a uniform series of text-books in all
branches taught in our public schools; also
that the State furnish text-books free to the
children who attend our public schools, and
that the State Board of Education require all
private schools in their primary departments
that teach the English language to use the
same text-books that are used in our.public
schools; also that the high school be made a
public school, supported out of the State and
county school fund. This last recommenda
tion 1 make for the reason that the time has
come, in my opinion, when our public school
system should be complete, from the primary
department to a university course. The high
school is the people's college, and should be
supported by the State.; v **
'All private in name," but . quasi-public in
fact, institutions should be open at all times to
public inspection, and a law should be placed
upon our statute-books to that effect. All
asylums, reformatories, schools or other insti
tutions receiving any aid from the State by
public appropriation of money, under what
ever pretext, should be under State control.
I believe, furthermore, that very much evil
often results from the fact that designing men
furnish bonds for city, State and county of
ficials, thereby placing said officers under obli
gation to them and then taking advantage of
that obligation, and if some law could be en
acted whereby, this source of evil could be
stopped much good would be accomplished
thereby.
Wo are organized in a cause which is des
tined to lift governments from their hinges,
therefore let us be careful in the formation
work. We must be sufficiently far-sighted to
look beyond Immediate effects in the midst of
abnormal political conditions; be deaf at times
to the clamor of sentiment, and with steady.cool
calculating statesmanlike determination inau
gurate methods and systems that shall beget
normal political conditions resulting in
the enactment of laws that shall mold and
build for the future. Personal consequences
weigh with cowards only at a time when great
principles are in the balance.
With pleasure we mention the W. A. P. A.
work within our State. During the year a
State Council of the W. A. P. a. has been or
ganized and that most helpful auxiliary has
entered upon the grand work of its mission in
a way that commends the zeal, patriotism and
self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of hu
manity on the part of our noble American
women to all lovers of liberty.
Mrs. M. E. Richardson, the most worthy State
president of our auxiliary, is working earnestly
and wisely for the i. holding of the order, and
we trust that the American Protective Associ
ation councils within this jurisdiction will ap
preciate the value of the W. A. P. A. and lend
all assistance possible. .
The junior A. P. A. councils are organizing
and we believe much good will be the outcome!
oi this department of our work.

,* I would recommend some few changes in the
organic law of our. order. Each subor
dinate council in my opinion should be free
to fix the dues of its members and the State
constitution should be so amended.
: The office of trustees and auditing committee
being separate offices in many respects, but
filled by one set of officers, *it would, in my
opinion, often avoid confusion if the . constitu
tion were so amended as to more specifically
define the duties, rights, etc., of the trustees
and auditing committees.
I believe, further, that the State and subor
dinate council are circumscribed to a greater
or less degree by limitation fixed by the su
preme constitution. While we recognize that
the supreme council should ever be the guar
dian body, yet we are fully persuaded that a
greater latitude granted State and subordinate
councils would very materially help in our
woik.
And now comes the discharge of a duty
which Is fraught with pleasant associations
and the memories that bring restful moments.
To the presidentsof the subordinate councils of
California my gratitude, which cannot 'be ex
pressed because of the poverty of language at
my command, is yours. For the way in which
you have labored in assisting me in performing
the arduous duties of my office may your re
ward be commensurate with your labors.
Then indeed will your cup be full. I mention
the names of W. F. Barnes and 51. T. Brewer,
his deputy State secretary. Never have they,
or either of them, been too busy to render any
assistance asked, Friend Barnes having been
with me at many points in the State, rendering
valuable services at all times. Friend Brewer
has been in my * absence from the State office
not alone recording secretary, but executive
secretary as well.
Friends, my work for the State Council year
just closing is done. With clean hands and a
true heart I accepted the office of State presi
dent one year ago; with clean hands and a loyal
heart I give it back to you. I regret the mis
takes that have been made by meâ are
manyâ but permit me to have a becoming
pride as I hand back to the giver this jewel of
trust in the fact that your order is stronger nu
merically in California alone by 50 percent
than it was with California and Nevada com
bined one year ago, your State Council ont of
debt and money in the treasury.
To all the State officers and boards I say
thank you for all that you have done to make
my work lighter, and to the members every
where I say, "In the name of home, country
and God go forward."
The afternoon session was taken up in
hearing the reports of the various commit
tees and State officers upon the work of
the American Protective Association dur
ing the past year. Discussions upon the
method of conducting the coming political
campaign will take up much of the session.
The council will elect State officers, also
delegates to the National convention, to be
held in Washington during the latter part
of May. For president of the State coun
cil B. F. Hud el .son will in all probability
succeed himself, there being no other
prominent candidate for the position in

LITTLE INFANTS' SHELTER
Those Who Care for Babes and
Tots Meet and Elect
Officers.
Contributions That Will Enable the
Officers to Erect a Comfortable
Homeâ Neglect of Parents.
The ladies of the Little Sisters' Infant
Shelter held their annual meeting yester
day afternoon at 512 Minna street, for the
purpose cf hearing the reports of officers
and the election of directors. - 333
This institution, conducted by charitable
ladies who number sixty-four and con
tribute to the support of the shelter, re
ceives the children of parents who work
: out during the day and takes care of them
! at an . expense of 5 cents a day, giving
i them two meals daily and looking after
their welfare, besides giving them kinder
garten instruction. Children are also re
ceived and cared for by the month for
parent or parents who cannot by reason of
their occupation pay them attention. * :
"Here," said Mrs. M. Fell, the matron,
pointing to a tot of 7, "is a little fellow
who is motherless, and his father is em
ployed on one of the ocean steamers. He
leaves him here, and every time he comes
ashore he comes here to see him."
"If they all did as he does," said Miss
Josie Kenley, the kindergarten teacher, "it
would be well, but there are some parents
who leave their children here and never
come to see them. It is too bad that there
are some people who are so heartless as to
forget their children. Yet, while these
parents do not seem to care for their little
ones, they will not consent to the placing
of their children with people, who would
I gladly adopt them. A well-to-do couple,
! who have a splendid home in San Mateo
i County, wanted to adopt a little five-year
j old, and she. would have had all the com
| forts that any one could desire, but the
j mother would not hear to it, y^t she never
j comes here to see her, and for more than a
i year has not contributed to its support,
and the good ladies who conduct this place
have to keep her. ' */â¢*..
"Yes, and here is another case. We keep
children here until they are 8 years of age,
but we have one little girl who is now
9 years old," added Mrs. Fell. "We
cannot turn her out on the street, so we
have to keep her."
The meeting was presided over by Mrs.
H. E. Fisher, president, who in her report
reviewed the work of the year and ex
pressed the hope that in the near future
the society would be able to enlarge its
scope for good and with contributions that
are to be paid in at no distant day a new
shelter may be built.
Mrs. G. F. Richardson, the secretary,
said in her report, the twenty-second since
he organization of the society, that mem
ben _S Son^to feel proud, that during
the Past year they nad been able to help
[hose who are willing to help themselves.
During the year the health of the children
has been good, only two deaths occumng
and these * children were .puny and -sickly
when received. The society received $100
from the Eobinson fund, $2000 by the Pat
ton will, and arrangements have; been
reached by which $2500 will be received
from the Lux estate and a sum not yet
designated from : the Washington Ever
estate. The American Guild made pre
sentations of considerable clothing foi the
little ones. : , Â -
The following named were chosen direc
tors- for the ensuing year: Mrs. M. lil
den, Mrs. E. Cooper, Mrs. W.B. Fisher,
Mrs. H.E. Fisher, Mrs. H. T. Heywood,
Mrs. J. M. Margo, Mrs. J. F. Eichardson,
Mrs. J. A. Sampson and Mrs. T. G. Taylor.
Mrs. A. E. Fisher declined a renomina
tion for president, but she was continued
until the next meeting in that position.
Mrs. T. G. Taylor was elected vice-presi
dent; Mr 3. G. F. Eichardson, secretary;
Mrs. H. T. Heywood, treasurer, and Mrs.
H. M. Tilden, corresponding secretary.
A vote of thanks was tendered to Assist
ant Chief Engineer John Dougherty for
detailing a number of men last Thursday
to remove the children from the shelter in
case of need, as a fire was raging a few
door* - above. .
After the meeting Mrs. Fisher, presi
dent, said that the shelter is not what it
ought to be, but that when fund 3 are avail
able a home bright, airy, sunny and cheer
ful will be â¢built. "We will build a good
comfortable home," she said, "and we
hope that some kind charitable person
who has plenty of means will donate us
the furniture to fit it up as it should be."

THE
BICYCLIST
WANTS
Not any wheel, but THE wheel,,
How shall his choice be governed?
What has put the golden stamp of
popular favor on the Steams
wheel? To begin with, the
Steams is a structural unity. The
relation and adjustment are as ex-
actly fine as the human body or an
accurate watch. Its very color,
so attractive and pleasing to the
eye, is merciless toward any de-
fect of workmanship re*
fusing to mask badness. Under
the exposure of its own light it
proves to be the epitome and
quintessence of all the qualities
that go to make the perfect wheel.

REPLIES TO ROSS
He Declares the Church Does
Not Want Temporal
Power.
METHODS OF THE A. P. A.
â¢
The Priest Says They Are
Fraudulent and Entirely
Un-American.
THE POPE AND THE PRESIDENT.
Meaning of the Quotations Made by
the Leader of the American
Protective Association.
In a second letter in reply to the Metro
politan Hall lectures of the Rev. Donald
M. Ross, champion of the A. P. A., the
Rev. P. C. York* says:
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sip.: The four
propositions which D. Ross pretended to reaa
out of a Catholic publication are as follows:
"The Roman church has the right to exercise
its authority without any limit's, to it by the
civil powers. The Pope "and the priests ought
to have dominion over temporal affairs. The
i .oman church and her ecclesiastics have a
right *â¢ immunity from civil -law. In case of
conflict ween ecclesiastical and civil powers
the ecclesiastical ought to prevail
As I havo already stated, these four proposi
tions ere scattered broadcast over this State
by.the A. P. a. before the last election. That
U u"'~ Vmer "** an society is organized for the single
object of introducing a religious test into our
political; commercial and social life. In its at
tempt to defeat all Catholic candidates and ail
Protestant candidates who had Catholic wives
the A. P. A. printed a broadside giving the re
ligion of each candidate and the religion of his
wife.-- On the Dack of this document were
-printed various pronouncements ascribed to
* : tbe. Catholic church. Among them was the
. extract quoted above. The tenor of these pro
,'rto_.ll cements was that the Catholic church
claimed civil jurisdiction over this country,
and that therefore it was the duty of every
patriot to cast his ballot against all Catholics
and against all who might be fricndlv to Ca
tholicism.
. â  I need not say that all these pronouncements
were forgeries. The A. P. A. can thrive only on
trend and misrepresentation. Apolitical soci
ety which gathers in the sub-cellars cannot be
composed of men who love the light. Con
spirators who sneak Into lodges with their hats
pulled over ttieir faces and their coat-collars
turnea up around their jaws are not expected
to be of a high order, morally or intellectually.
Hence the methods of the* society have been
fraudulent from the beginning. Forgery has
been its favorite weapon, and forgery scares
irorn every line of the publications sent out by
the A. P. A.
THE MEANING OF THE PROPOSITIONS.
â¢The meaning which the A. P. A. Intended to
convey by the four propositions is; not far to
seel-c. The Catholic church was represented as
trying to obtain dominion over the Unite**
States. Dominion means sovereign o.- supreme
authority, and when it was asserted that the
Pope and the priests ought to have dominion
over temporal auairs the reader was led to be
lieve that the Catholic church taught that the
only lawful governor of this country was the
Pope. The propositions were produced as con
firmation out of the mouth of Cath
olicity itself that Leo XIII was con
templating an advance on Washing
ton.; The propositions that the Roman
church had a right to ;e*xerciÂ«e its autiu*<rity
without any limit set to it by the civil powers,
tijat it nad a rijfct to trom'tinity'' from civil.
i_ws ?.nd that the ecclesiastical powers -ought
to prevail over ' the civil, all supported the
same idea. Rome now. as in the middle ages,
WB.s plotting to steal away our liberties, to de
stroy our institutions and to set the foot of the
Pot* on tne neck of the President.
SHijfffll : '- P.OSB' FIRST _o___BOX.
Of course these ideas are puerile. The Cath
olic church has net the slightest thought of
inculcating such doctrines, but then the num
ber of fools is infinite; and they are joining the
a. P.. A. every day. Men believed these calum
nies aud looked upon them as proof positive
tnat the Pope was on his way to gobble us all
up. When, therefore, I challenged D. Ross to
I rod nee the publications from which he pre-
IMnded to read these propositions I added that
! would be satisfied if he produced the sub
stance of them. During the four nights he
conducted his performance at the Metropolitan
Temple he made no attempt to produce the
four propositions. a3 they were printed by the
A. P. A. He thus admitted that when sent
iorth by his organization they were forgeries.
He and Hudelson and the other dark-lantern
patriots are before God and man guilty of bear
ing false witness against their neighbors.
THE mi -sum â 
1 have already shown the origin of the propo
sitions. I may mention here that in the first
edition of hie book, "Our Country, Dr. Josiah
Strong printed these four propositions as a por
tion of an "Encyclical." In the second edition
he acknowledges that he had been misled.
Mountebanks, however, will acknowledge
nothing, end D. Boh had neither the wit nor
â¢iecency to apologize to the community for
fathering forgery.
On the contrary, he attempted to prove that
the substance of "the propositions was true. He
attempted to show that the Catholic claims
were, inconsistent with true loyalty, and that
the church was only waiting, for an oppor
tunity to possess herself of this Government.
Then'this unnaturalized protector of America
broke out into the following syntaxlass har-
angrier 5599~8-PWB(
**i believe It is an awful necessity, and when
such a thing as this can be true, that a body of
men claiming 10,000,000 in the United States
caS declare and teach and affirm and practice
%hat an oath of allegiance can be broken in
stantly, without sin or wrong; when it is the
'lawor'the wish oi that organization that these
people go out from America and pass over to
therri, id case of a conflict, I tell you, my
friends, in view of the fact that Rome's eyes
are. on America; in view of the fact that
Koine's purposes are on America; in view of
the .fact that, from every land under the sun,
from every Government under the sun, there
is spewed: "out into America the dregs of those
lands, if only they are Catholics, there is an
awful danger showing the difficulty of Ameri
canizing those whose bath of allegiance even
does not bind them."- [Applause.]
I intend now to take up the quotations which
he- produced from Catholic authorities and
show what their true meaning is and how D.
Rosa has tried to make dishonest capital out of
them;- * . .
THE first -ECTUSE.
For reasons best known to himself D. Ross
treated the fourth proposition first.
â¢In case of conflict between ecclesiastical
and civil powers the ecclesiastical ougnt to
prevail." **,*'" Â3 **
Though he claimed to have a large library of
Catholic books and though he quoted from
some ten be never attempted to produce that
proposition as it stands. 7 â¢ '..'Â« T
But did he produce the substance of it? Let
us see what is the substance. A power la de
fined bvWehetcr as "an individual invested
with authority; an institution or government
which exercises control.'! The "civil powers'
therefore are civil government-* or civil insti
tutions, or persons invested with evil- au
thority. . The ecclesiastical powers are church
governments, orehurcb institutions or persons
invested with church authority. The proposi
tion signifies that whenever there is a conflict
on any subject whatsoever between any eccle
siastical power and any civil power the civil
power must always step aside and make room
for the church. ...
D. ROSS' VERSION. â¢
I*. Ross' version of the substance of the
proposition is curious and Instructive. I copy
it out In order that it may be preserved unto
future generations: 3 - . , ... Â*.,
"In ca-*> of conflict between the ecclesiastical
and the civil powers the ecclesiastical ought to
prevail, *ays the. Catholic church. In case of
conflict -ween that mighty * organization,
the mightiest organization on the face of God a
earth to-day, that knows no national bounda
ries, that knows no tongue or language, that
might* organization that is around the whole
globeâ the Roman Catholic church when the
powers-, wheu the will; when the desire of that
organization runs against the government of
any One nationâ l- declare that the cry of the
. Catholic church is that the ecclesiastical ought
v io prevail.
"Peter C. Yorko says that- In case of conflict
between the church and the government the
church does not say that the church ought to
win. Look at it for Aye minutes. In case Peter
C. 1 orke and 1 should so far forget onrsctlves as
to take our coats off and get into conflictâ think
of itâ who do yon think ought to win, accord
ing to Peter C. Yorke. â  .â .'â¢..---,â -,
i
(A voiceâ Why, you.)
"Me, of course. * â 
"In case of conflict between you and me I
say you ought to win. That is Peter C. Yorke's ;
statement here, because he says that' in case '
the church and the government oppose each \
other the church says, 'Oh, the government
ought to win." %â  .
It is hardly necessary, Mr. Editor, to com- j
ment on this extraordinary and ludicrous de- j
scription Of my denial. When I deny the state- |
meat that it never snows t in California i
no sensible person supposes that the present '
aberrations of the weather-man are the normal, !
condition of things in our State."
CASES OF CONFLICT.
When we bear in mind that the '"civil pow
ers" are civil governments or civil institutions
or persons invested with .civil authority, and j
that the "ecclesiastical powers" are church ,
governments or church institutions or ecclesi- â 
astical persons, we can well imagine that many
cases of conflict may occur. There might be a
conflict between the United States Govern- ;
meat -and the whole church, there might be a â 
'dispute, between a parish aad a county, there
might be trouble between a Bishop and a
Mayor, there might be a row between a police- "
man and a sexton. According to the proposi- j
tion, in all these cases, the United States Gov
ernment, the county, the Mayor and the police
man should quietly and submissively step
aside and make room for the ecclesiastical
powers. ". _*"-'â '_
Even an A. P. A. can sec the absurdity of
such a statement. Evidently D. Boss saw it |
himself. Instead of trying to prove the sub- !
stance of tne proposition he neglected all j
. other ecclesiastical and civil powers and con- j
centrated bis attention on trie legislative ;
- faculty and triumphantly declared that he had
! proved his point when he discovered a quota
' tion which said that in _ conflict of laws the
' civil law should give way.
SÂ§E|P - SPECIMEN.
i This is his last ditch. He has given up the
claim that he took the propositions out of
i Catholic publications. He has abandoned the
; attempt to prove the substance of the state
' ment. He hopes, however, that ii he can show
: one case in which the ecclesiastical prevails
against the civil he has won his point.
His first quotation and his first proof I give
in his own words and wonderful words they are:
"Bronson say. this, speaking of the church
and the Government: -The state is only an in
ferior court, bound to receive the law from the
supreme court (the church) and is liable to
have its decisions reversed on appeal.'
hen there is a conflict between one power
which claims to be the supreme court and the
decision of the superior court, the superior
court is the one whose judgment shall be
laid aside, and the interior court has no power,
over the superior court, but that the superior
court is the one whose judgments and whose j
decisions ought 10 carry weight, and the other 'â 
ought to go down. Yet Bronson declares that
the church is the supreme court and the state i
is the inferior court. Place them thus against |
each other, showing at once the supreme j
court, the church ought to prevail, and has '
the right ot altering the decisions of the- gov- j
ernment of. the state when those decisions !
differ from the decisions of the will of the
supreme bodyâ the church."
Let us see what Brownson is talking about.
D. Boss swore before high heaven that he was
absolutely honest and that he strove in every j
case to give the true spirit of the writer. Let
the reader judge. 4BSf_*U*&~ :
The extract is taken from a long article treat
ing oi the church and state, which may be
found in the tenth volume of Brownson's j
works, page 129. Browns) a is speaking not of j
civil law or of ecclesiastical law, but of the
i natural and moral law. Webster defines moral ;
taw as "the law of duty, as regards what is
right and wrong in the sight oi God; specifi
cally, the ten commandments." His thesis is
that this "moral law is as obligatory on em- i
perors, kings, princes, commonwealths, as j
upon private individuals, upon politicians as |
upon priests or simple believers." In other '
words he is demonstrating that a state has no \
more righÂ» to steal than an individual, and i
thai a politician is as much bound to be hon- |
est in politics as the merchant in business.
I do not suppose that any one will seriously |
dispute this proposition. Now he holds that
the church has the right to teach this moral I
law, and consequently has the right to say j
when it is broken. Every Sunday-school in the i
country exercises this right and every
preacher. When Dr. Case gets into his pulpit I
and declares that the Supervisors are violating
the moral law in allowing certain advertise
ments to offend our sense of decency, he is only
doing what BrowÃsoa claims for the church.
Now comes the question, Whose duty is it to
declare this law or where are we to find the
moral law? Dr. Case would say in the Bible.
The Bible, therefore, is the supreme court for
the moral law. He interprets the Bible to ;
â â  command such and such actions, and he claims
the right to judge, to warn, to rebuke when â¢
he finds these actions neglected.
If the Supervisors took it into their heads to
I declare that stealing was lawful Dr. Case would
quickly protest. Armed with his Bible he |
would reverse the declaration of the Super
visors and iv his own words he would "cry *
aloud and spare not." , "â *-*'
>;ow, Mr. editor, would any one think, that.
If these things happened, Dr. Case was Consti- ;
luting himself Mayor or a supreme court ! .
with civil authority over the Board oi Super- 1
visors? Would any sensible man refer to Dr. ' .
Case's action as a conclusive proof that the I
Methodist church is trying to gobble up the '
State?
Yet this is all Brownson claims for. the ;
church. I will copy out the whole passage so â 
that you may see that Brownson's teaching is
good, sensible, American doctrine. The quo- !
tation, it is true, is somewhat long, but I am \
not an adept in the art of seizing two or three
words in an argument and presenting them as
the spirit of the author:
'â¢The state holds under the law of nature.
and has authority only within the limits of .
that law. As long as it confines itself within
that law and faithfully executes its provisions
it acts freely, without" ecclesiastical restraint
or interference. But the church holds from
: God under the supernatural or revealed law, j
which includes, as integral in Itself, the law of !
: nature, and is, therefore, the teacher and !
guardian of the natural as well as of the re- <
: vealed law. She is, under God, the supreme ;
judge of both laws, which for her are but one :
law"; and, hence, she takes cognizance in her
tribunals of the breaches of tbe natural law as
well as of the revealed, and has the right to j
take cognizance of its breaches by nations as j
well .- of its breaches by individuals, by the !
prince as well as by subject, for it is the su- !
pre me law for both, The state is, therefore,
only an inferior court, bound to receive the j
law from the supreme court and liable to have ,
its decisions reversed on appeal.
"This must be asserted if we assert the su- ;
premacy of the Christian law and hold the j
church to be its teacher and judge, forno man
will deny that Christianity includes the natu
ral as well as the supernatural law. Who with !
any just conceptions or any conceptions at all
of the Christian religion will pretend that one ;
can fulfill the Christian law and yet violate '
the natural law?â that one is a good Christian 1
if he keeps the precepts of the church though j
; he breaks every precept of the decalogue.or that '
I Christianity remits the catechumen to the
i state to learn the law. of nature, or what
we term natural morality? Grace presupposes
nature. The supernatural ordinances of God's
j law presuppose the natural and the church,
; which is the teacher and guardian of faith and
! moralsâ can no more be so without plenary au
thority with regard to the latter than to the
! former. Who, again, dares pretend that the
; mural law is not .as obligatory on emperors,
kings, princes and commonwealths as upon
i private individuals, upon politicians as upon
; priests, or simple believers ? Unless, then, you
â  exempt the state from all obligations, even
I to the law of nature, you must make it amen
* ble to the moral law as expounded by the
; church divinely commissioned to teach and
: declare it. * * * We nyed hardly say that j
I we advocate no amalgamation of the civil and i
ecclesiastical administrations: they are in j
i their nature, as we have said, distinct, and the i
supremacy of the church which we assert is by
DO means a supremacy of the clergy as politi
cians. We have no more respect for clergymen
turned politicians thau we have for any other
class of politicians of equal worth, perhaps not
quite so much; for we cannot forget that they
in becoming politicians descend . from .their
â  sacerdotal rank as a judge does in descending
; from the bench to play the part of an advocate.
; We have had political priests ever since there
was a Christian state, and many of them have !
I made sad work of both politics and religion. j
j We. have nothing to say oi them but that they j
! were politicans, and their censurable acts were i
â  not performed in their character of priests. |
The principle, we assert, does not exact that j
the church should turn politician, and thus ;
from the church become the state, or that the i
; clergy should turn politician; it exacts that l
I both she and they should not. The clergy as j
i politicians fall into the category of all :
| politicians, and their supremacy as politi
| cians would still be the supremacy of the
state, not of the church. The state is
supreme, if politicians as such be supreme, let
; them be selected from what class of the com
i munity they may. The principle exacts in
deed the supremacy of the clergy, but solely
as tbe church in their sacerdotal and pastoral
I character as teachers, guardians and judges of
1 the law of God, natural and revealed, supreme
! for individuals and nations, for prince and
', subject, king and commonwealth, noble and
I pleblan, rich and poor, great ana small, wise
i and simple; not as politicians, in which char- |
! acter they have and can have no pre-eminence j
| over politicians selected from the' laity,
; and must stand on the same level
i with them. We do not advocateâ far from itâ
: the notion that the church must administer - !
: the civil government. What wedo advocate is l
' her supremacy as the teacher and guardian of > |
â¢ the law of God as the supreme court, which j
must be recognized and submitted to as such I
l by the state, and whose decisions cannot be j ;
| disregarded, whose prerogatives cannot be ;
: ; abridged or usurped by any power on earth
without rebellion against the divine majesty j
and robbing man of his rights. As Christians ;
wo must insist on this supremacy; as Catholics !
it is not only our duty but our glorious privi- i j
- lege to assert it, and to understand and prac- j
tice our religion as God himself through his ;
own chosen organ promulgated and expounds 'â 
it." â â -:â â  7 -':.
\ You see then, Mr. Editor, whs' Brownson's j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1896.
teaching is. There (a such a thing as the!
moral law. That law ii independent of the i
state ; it is above the state. The state doe? not :
make it and the state is not the judge of it.
The judffe of the moral law is either the In
dividual conscience or the organized con
science known as the church. When, there
fore, Brownson attributes to the church what
every Protestant claims for himself, how
absurd it is to say that the church is seeking to
crush the state under its heel, or that the
church claims the right of altering the de- ,
cisions of the government of the state, when j
those decisions differ from the decisions of the
will oi the supreme government.
You can see. too, the absolute honesty of D.
Ross and his "pal," the soi-disant Major Sher
man. He had all this quotation before him.
He had read Brownson's reiterated statements
that he did not believe in the church interfer
ing with tne civil power. He knew the opin- i
ions expressed of clerical politicians, yet he |
suppressed all these things, no doubt, to get
the true spirit of the author. He had time in
his lectures to repeat the same old quotations
â¢three or four times, yet h? had no time lor a
few sentences which would explain Brown
son's meanings. No wonder it took him three
months to pick out a word here and a word
there to hiatfe capital against Catholicity. He
took a sentence which by itself is misleading,
and to make it the more misleading he put an
interpretation on it which he knew was false.
CARDINAL MANNING.
Ross' next argument seems to be an estray.
Logically it belongs to the third proposition,
but D. Ross did not bother much about logic.
As long as he ilunjr chunks of quotations at the
public he imagined the right effect was pro- !
duced. 1). Rosa should remember that all the ;
people in Sail Francisco are not by their stu
pidity eligible for the A. P. A.
Let me give the quotation and Ross' own
â words as they appear in the stenographic re
port. 1 must confess I cannot say whether the
reporter or Ross slipped fi cog, but the sen
tences are rather enigmatical. However, one
can gain an adumbration of what he means:
"Speaking of the laws of Germany, under
Bismarck, Manning quote? these words: 'And
now the Berlin Government it is said, is about
to attempt to impose on every bishop ihe fol
lowing oath':
"Just let us lcok at the oath and see how
reasonable it is. 'The bishops are henceforth
to swear obedience to the laws of the country,
to bind themselves by oath to exhort the clergy
and the laity to be loyal to the Emperor, patri
otic and obedient to the laws and not to per
mit the clergy under their control to teach or
act in opposition to these principles.'
"Manning says of that attitude of the Berlin
Government this: 'The cynicism oi that oath
is as clear as day.' Is thatnot conflict between I
the church and between the state? Manning, i
the authority of the church, says that they
ought not to be r ul to the bishops, but that
they cught to be free, absolutely free to do as
they pleased."
.Now as a matter of fact Manning says no
such thing and D. Ross knows it. Manning
is speaking of definite laws and what is more
he describes them:
"The result, then, of these laws is that no
'official function,' as the Berlin Government
puts it, that is no spiritual act from the ex
communication of a heretic down to the teach
ing of the catechism to school children, can be
performed without the sanction of" the civil
power under pain of fine or imprisonment,
aud this failing,*, of deposition. The Ober,
President of Posen has already called on the
Archbisiiopof Posen to resign his archbishopric
for numerous offences aeainst the Falck laws,
â¢which offenses are so many high spiritual
duties. If he refuses to resign within eight
days he is to be cited before the royal tribunal
of "Berlin. The act 24 and 25, Henry VIII,
made the King outright head of the church
and by one stroke all jurisdiction formerly be
longing to the Pope was transferred to' the
crown. This was intelligible. The Falck laws
are indirect and circuitous. They compass
what they do not claim. They suspend all spirit
ual jurisdiction on the civil power and make
the sovereign absolute in the matter of
religion." *." -
Manning says, and every American will
agree with him. that it is brutal cynicism to
ask Bishops to take an oath to obey such laws.
One might as well ask D. Ross to take an oath
to obey all the.laws of the Catholic church or
to askan early Christian to take an oath to
offer incense to idols. That Manning com
mends the German Bishops for their heroic
resistance to enactments which were viola
tions of the German constitution is a pretty
proof that the Bishops most always have their
own way. If a lawyer in this City breaks an
unconstitutional law to create a test case for
the .Supreme Court does his action prove that
he can ride roughshod ov^r the civil law ? If
there had been a Supreme Court in Germany
the Falck laws would not have stood ten min
utes. The Bishops, therefore, were compelled
to appeal to the court of last resort, the peo
ple, and I am happy to say they succeeded in
spite of Bismarck and Falck. Yours truly,
P. C. YOP.KK.
A HUNGRY MAN'S DEVICE
Thomas Williams, a Shoemaker,
Breaks a Window in the
v City Hall.
He Wanted Justice and Thought it
Better to Destroy Public
Property.
A "shabbily dressed little man with wild,
staring eyes went into the north corridor
of the City Hall leading from Larkin
street about 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon,
and when he was opposite the office of the
police property clerk he stopped and de
liberately threw a cobblestone through
one of the windows, 'smashing the glass
in pieces.
Policeman Wagner heard the crash and,
running along the corridor, placed the
man under arrest.
â¢"What "did you do that for?" asked
Wagner. â¢
"I want justice," was the reply. . "I am
out of worn and starving and don't know
where to go."
. '.'But why did you break, the window?"
"Weil, I thought it was better to destroy
â¢public property than private property, as
no one in -particular would suffer by it.
Up to this time his reasons were intelli
gible, but when Wagner took him before
Captain Healy and he was asked the same
questions he talked wildly about being
swindled out of his worldly possessions in
Sacramento four years ; ago by the help of
the detectives and police there.
"I want justice.' he kept repeating,' "for
the wrongs done me, and I mean to have
it."
Captain Healy instructed Wagner to
take him to the City Prison and placea
charge of malicious mischief against him.
He gave his name as Thomas Williams, a
shoemaker, 49 years of age.

MAJOR T. C. RYAN.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
politan Temple to hear Majov T. C. Ryan's
lecture; given under the auspices of tho
W. A. P. A. Council No. 17. 3
The meeting was opened by the
audience singing "America/ after, which
J. Mearnes played on the piano a medley
of patriotic airs. 3-V:'3
Rev. Dr. W. W. Case,^acting. in the
capacity of chairman, introduced; the
speaker of the evening, Major Ryan,' but
before doing so made a few preliminary
remarks, in which he took occasion to
congratulate the A. P. A. cause on draw
ing so large a house on such a blustering
night.
'There would be more here," said he,
"were it not for the reason that so many
of our A. P. A. friends are out digging our
opponents out of the snow banks, for we
are well assured they are all snowed under.
â¢ "It is well known," he continued, "that
we are not contending against political
Romanism and Jesuitism.
"It is not our wish to injure the feelings
of our Catholic fellow-citizens or to stir up
the bad side of/human nature. Protest
ants recognize equal rights among all
classes of citizens, irrespective of creed or
color.
"There are tens of thousands of Roman
Catholics in San Francisco ho deserve
and command universal respect.
"The Roman Catholic church does not
consist of these nor of the laity at all. It
is - composed of a lordly and tyran
nical priesthood, certain members of
whom, the archbishops, own all the
church property and dictate the entire
policy of the church subject to a foreigner
in' Italy who has never set foot on - our
shores, and who never will.
"It '3 the unchanging purpose of this
priesthood to destroy the public school
system of this country.
"They must have exclusive control of
the education of their children or they
will lose their power over them. They
live for Romanism.
"I fancy the* priests would willingly give
the whole of Lone Mountain could they
but get the power thereby to blot out the
exposures and revelations of monstrosities
of Romanism which have appeared during
the last six months." â¢ The speaker con
tinued: â ""- 3**3- " ' -â¢ ''
Does some one cry out, Cvi bono? What
good? Has any one been convertedjjto Prot
estantism? I answeryesl But that is not the
test. The last six months has been -a seed
time. The seed has been **' sown broadcast.
Hundreds have begun to think more closely
than ever before. They will go on thinking,
and as they think they will get light, and in
the light Romanism cannot flourish. Many a
young Catholic is getting; his eyes open, and
no priest or Pope can shut them.
- As a young Italian said to me the other day,
"The priest, he no damn get me to confess to'
htm some more; he got nuff to confess he
self." â¢â *. All honor to D. If. Rossi D. M. D.
must stand for David. Like the shepherd king,
he has slain the arrogant and boasting Goliath.
Or, if not slain, he has taken to the woods,
thinking, perhaps, that "He who fights and
runs away will live to fight another day" or
runaway/ ; . ..-;,
But we would not be harsh. We rather pity
him. He : had : a bad. cause. : Perhaps none
could have done better. No I man can I make
out his * case **â  in ; favor of ' Romanism in this
country and in this age before the great grand
juryâ the people. I rejoice with you in ** the
splendid results of this discussion. -Untold
good will result. A gentleman of note in Glas
gow, Scotland, who | read one of my addresses
in this temple same ' months ago (how it
reached him I cannot tell), wrote recently to a
friend of his in this country, and his letter was
forwarded to me, said: "Tell Dr. Case we have
no fear of Rome in Europe, for when she lost
her temporal power she reached her day of
doom. She will never rise again." *So we be
lieve. â¢ â *--â¢â  . /:'â¢;-â¢*":â¢'â¢ '7-7: 7 -> 7y
But 1 came not here to talk. I came to intro
duce the distinguished orator of the evening.
A minister once introduced brother minister
to his congregation to preach something after
.this; manner: "The Rev. Dr. Blank will now
preach to us on the subject of the Devil, and I
am sure we shall have an" able discourse for I
know the brother is full of his ; subject/: , The
speaker of the evening will address you on the
principles | of | true Americanism,* and, without
any left-handed compliment, I can assure you
he is full of his subject. r-iV. â. 33-
Major Ryan then spoke as follows:
. The subject I present to you to-night was born
out of au incident, r I*, was .present at the
Roman â Exposition ' : -' at i Chicago, commonly
known, as the World's Fair. I- remember the
day when -the President of the United States
opened this exposition *â  by -J one of the most
patriotic speeches I ever listened to.'- "-.'. "â¢'*â *" 7';:;: *-â¢
i i I believe this speech will 5 ? be handed down
for generations to come as a classic of Ameri
can patriotic literature.'. â¢ .... .*â¢â¢*'
; Cleveland said in the course of his speech,
"The best Â°of all â¢is*; we , educate people â in
America who are able to govern themselves."
He then planted his- thumb on the button
that set in motion the machinery- of the great
exposition. When this ; was done flags began
climbing the flagstaffs, but ' the first flag that
rose was a flag of no countryâ the Papal flag;
the second, the flag of Spain; the third, (Old
Glory. . â ;:.:;. '
And when I saw my flag sandwiched between
these two flags I said: "Certainly history re
peats itself. A symbol of truth and purity was
likewise placed on the hill of Calvary."
Under which flag shall we liveâ under which
shall our children live? This is a very impor
tant question.
> But if there be anything at all in the signs of
the times it is going to require all the effort
and power of the American people to perpetu
ate the flag in all its glory. r I go back to the
time when our Government was organized.
I follow our early fathers through their
ancient deeds down to the time they made the
British lion bow down at York town. Remem
ber when Washington said, "Put none -but
Americans on guard to-night."
When he said this he did not only mean
native-born Americans; he was broader than
that, for many born on foreign soil are often
times more patriotic than those reared here. "
The foreigner is one who loves the institu
tions of other lands better than our institu
tions of America. The foreign-born who be
comes a citizen loves, the institutions of this
land better than any other land ou earth.
In the organization 01 our Government our
fathers builded more wisely than they knew,
yet at the same time they planted the UDas
tree, whose poison we now inhale.
..They said we should Invite the inhabitant of
every land to come and make a home with us.
And this was wise. All they required of these
.visitors was that they absolve themselves from
allegiance to any foreign potentate or king.
To those people who come here to educate
their children and to labor for tne good of our
institutions are we indebted for our mighty
"Nation. , These people who came from 1789 to
1320 did not come to settle down for the good
of our form of government, but rather the re
verse.
So the Congress of that year (1820), discover
ing this, set a check on the incoming of people
to our shores. That Congress of 1820 was a
body ot men who legislated not for a favored
few, but for an entire republic.
.'lf you go to Washington you can^most hear
. \ them tramp in the corridors of your Capitol.
â¢ Another Congress has now convened, and if
it is not careful people will shout; derisively
when it dies. There is a cifference between
' the Congresses of now and that of 1820. â 
A different motive sends men to Congress in
this age. Nov v,c think |of the candidate's
i bank account. We are to a certain extent to
j blame for this, for I tell you that the good, the
protestantism of a countryâ is in the majority.
It is necessary to judge of the character of
I the people who.would come here in order to
: know what flag they should be under. ; J -
The German is the best educated man on the
* face of the earth. .
He is the lover of liberty, and on every one
| of the 252 battlefields of the last civil war the
i German took his gun and sword, and all can
attest to his devotion to the stars and stripes.
These German people being, therefore, intelli
gent and industrious are eligible to American
Â» citizenship.
From England we have received 2.501-.973 of
their people between the years 1820 and 1892.
And as far as my observation goes an English
man makes as good a citizen as . the German.
The flag suffers no danger in the hands of i
these men. * " . â .., - .
We have received from Scotland during this
same period 888,652. It is said these Scotch
men are raised ou oatmeal porridge and
Solomon's proverbs, and if that diet makes
such sturdy, honest men, I pray God to intro
duce it everywhere. To Scotchmen we are in
debted for the Held of blue that adorns
flag. They are intelligent and industrious and *
loyal.
I pass to another little country that has been
cursed from time immemorial by an ecclesi
astical government.* We received from this
country 3,0-14.239.
When my father came to this country from
Ireland and set his toot on our shores he lost
his identity and became an American. I say
now that as a man of Irish descent I say let no
man come to this country from Ireland until
he is able to read and to write.
It "is quite well known that out of this ig
norant contingent is born the worst element
of our Nation.
The worst men standing between the gates
of hell and sing Sing prison are those of the
Tammany gang. And this Tammany gang
came from this uneducated contingent.
From every nation on earth we have received
some good people. From Italy we have re
ceived 597,911 in the last seventeen years. , â 
| The blue bosom of the sea is whitened with
the sails of vessels bringing these people here,
and these fellows, many of whom can neither
read nor write, are taking the ballot in their
hand and trying to dictate to us as to our edu
cation. - -7: ' â¢ â â¢â .-' ."'â

MEE'OEB CROSSED THE - TEAGK.
It's Against the Japanese Raw, and So
â¢ He Missed the Train. '
The true story of how* Congressman ;
Mercer of Omaha caught, the, train at !
Tokio, Japan, last summer has never been
told. It was like this: _. .'
In the first place there is a law in Japan
against crossing a railway track. If the
train you want to take is on the other side
of the platform you cross a viaduct, which
lands you on another platform next to i
your train. To cross the track ala Ameri- ,
can is not only unlawful, but sacrilege in
the eyes of the Japanese. To see a man
swing himself upon a moving train stamps
him with a tendency to paresis. 3 .
' Mercer had been delayed in making \
change to pay fare for himself and party
to the next station, fifty miles distant, j
and the ladies had crossed thy viaduct and
taken their seats. Just as the >"ebraskan '
came running* out of the waiting-room the j
train was pulling out. In Japan the trains !
always move faster when they start than
when they are under full headway. To j
the religious dismay of the crowd of Japs
en the platform Mercer made a dash for
it, right across the intervening track, and
landed on the platform of the departing
train with a graceful bound.
In a moment panic and pandemonium
were rampant among the crowd of officials '
and onlookers, and some say the Imperial
Guard of Japan as well as a regiment of
sharpshooters were called out. At all
events the excitement produced by Mer- j
cer's daring feat was as great as if the Chi- j
nese had thrown a company of tirailleurs j
into the flank of the spectators Mercer
saw that there was violent signalling with
a red flag from the engine cab, and an
swering signals with red flags by the
switchman ahead. And then the train
slowly came to a stop. He was vaguely ;
conscious that all the confusion and ex- ;
citement was about him, but blissfully J
ignorant of the cause of the great sensa
tion he had produced.
He had never studied the revised stat
utes of Japan and the municipal laws of i
the city, and the gravity of his offense
never occurred to him. As soon as he
stepped down on the ground he was im
mediately encircled by a cordon of sol- ;
diers, police and train officials, all gesticu- j
lating and gibbering in one grand sym
phony of protestation. It looked blue for
Mercer. His friends say he told them in â¢
English that he was a member of the Fifty- ;
fourth Congress of the United States and
his person was sacred. He denies this. '
But fortunately at this critical -juncture an â 
| American elbowed his way through and
i called out to him:
"Stronger, you're all right. Keep a stiff
! upper lip." '
'â¢What in thunder is it all about?" asked
Mercer.
"You crossed the railroad track, and
that's against the law," said the American. |
. "Oh, is that the cause of all this excite
ment?" said Mercer; "I thought 1 had \
committed lese-majesty or was suspected
of wanting to hold tip the train." r? -
The Jai>s * kept crowding.- around and :
Mercer began to edge up against a coach
to protect his back. ;â¢. ;
"Don't let 'em touch you," shouted the
American, "tbey have no law for that." .
I'll lay out the first man that puts a
j finger on" me, if I get shot for it," said
Mercer. "By the great horn spoon there
goes the train, and "my wife's aboard."
. "That's an old trick of theirs," said the
other, "but you can telegraph her to wait
for yon at the next station." t
Mercer saw the train disappear, and
after a short delay the' American brought j
in an interpreter, and in rive minutes the !
difficulty was in course of adjustment. i
The Japs by this time had recovered their
politeness and were making bows on every
side to show they were sorry for what hap- ;
pened, and in a short time the station
agent, or whatever the man's position was, : â¢
brought out tea and cake to the offended
Congressman to sl_pw that they harbored
no ill-feeling. Mercer telegraphed his
wife at the next station to wait for him
and took the next train to meet her. She
was there, but the telegram had not
reached her. However, the operator had
received it. He ptUled it out of his vest j
pocket and handed it to the Congressman j
with a broad grin. "^^Sg^*SgÃ^fflaÃ^^

the way we do in the United States. You
people are rapidly becoming American- j
ized." â Washington Post.

at station indicate maximum temperatuye for the :
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of i

therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
When the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north and
south along the coast, rain- is probable: but when

falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these conditions will produce
an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial. -
NEW YORK, N. V., March 3.-There was a
material falling off in the volume of business at
the -tock Exchange to-day, and dealings only ag
gregated 201.500 shares. The decrease in business
was due chiefly to the fact that operators in stocks
. have not recovered from the scare produced by
the Baltimore and Ohio receivership and the action
.' of Congress on the Cuban question. Finding the
supply of stocks small recent short sellers en
deavored to cover, and this ' with moderate buying*
for the long account led to an advance near the
opening of %@2 per cent. In the rise Cotton Oil
preferred, Louisville and Nashville and Tennes
see Coal were the most conspicuous. An incident
â¢of the day was the rise in St. Paul 1077V_. and the
decline in Burlington to 76"/ 2 . This re the first
time in the history of the Stock Exchange that St,
Paul stock hi's crossed Burlington. In the after
. noon trading Tobacco dropped from 77">4 to 76 on
reports from St Louis that the outside companies
intended to go into tne cigarette business- This
gave rise to a rumor which could not be confirmed
that the American Tobacco Company had sold
$1,000,000 new prefsrred stocic. The break in the
stock exerted an unfavorable influence on the gen
eral lis:, but the decline, except in the case of Rub
â¢ ber was unimportant. The stock named dropped
8 percent to 2->A on the revival of the reports of
Internal dissensions. Toward the close a steadier
feeling obtained in the general market. St Paul at
this time exhibited considerable strength. Balti
more and Ohio securities were less active and if
anything somewhat steadier. The market closed
steady to firm in tone. Net changes show advances
of *V4_il per cent. General Electric leading.
Tobacco lost *"4. Burlington %, Rubber preferred

' CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 3.â Moderate firmness
was seen at the opening of the wheat market this
morning, lighter receipts in the Northwest receiv
ing the credit of producing the strength. The re
ceipts referred to were 399 cars, against 568 last
Tuesday and 557 a year ago. Very soon after the
opening offerings assumed greater proportions than
the demand was able to absorb and prices were
forced to decline under the pressure. Receipts at
Chicago were 74 cars and 100,497 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables were easy
and of course gave no encouragement to buyers.
The weather predictions of snow in the winter
wheat States were partly responsible for the in
creased offerings, in the market to-day. As the
session proeressed prices became weaker until a
decline of a cent from the outside was recorded,
after which there was a short rally with the close
fairly steady. Export clearances were 195.207
bushels. Closing Continental cables were irregu
lar. May opened from 673 cto 67% c > declined to
66y2C, closing at Sbs-gwebS+c. R*,c under yester
day. Estimated receiu'.s for to-morrow 72 cars.
CORNâ Was confined to restricted limits. Price
changes did not indicate air thing particularly im
portant. Larger receipt* than expected. 670 cars,
imparted weakness to the tone at the start, and as
wheat was In anything bot a buoyant condition
corn found no excuse for a stronger feeling later.
Withdrawals from store were 144.147 bushels.
Livernool cables were quiet and steady. Export
clearances amounted to 217,338 bushels. May
corn opened at 305 B e. declined to 303 B'â 8 'â  closing at
30y>C 1 /B@ l /i c under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 400 cars.
âGood receipts of oats tended to weaken
the market for that grain, and in that respect the
corn market was resembled. Tne lack of firmness
in wheat was also an adverse influence. Receipts
were 423 cars, and 49.555 bushels were withdrawn
from store. May oats closed ygc under yesterday.
1- Â«-ima'ed receipts for to-morrow 260 cars.
FLAX-Was easy: cash, 90c; May, 89 /_Â®9oV_c.
Receipts were 22 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The receipts of hogs this morn
ing were less than half the number expected and
the natural consequence was a stronger market at
the yards. Product promptly reflected the feeling
at that place and ruled higher. The close was
5@7L-,c higher than yesterday for May pork and
May ribs and 5c higher for May lard.

THE COAL TRADE.
The private circular of 1. Steuart gives the re
ceipts of Coal at this port thus far this .year at
219,500 tons, against 255,800 tons during the same
time in 1895, and says: "The deliveries of Coal in
port during the month have been light, especially
from Great Britain and Australia. Stocks, conse
quently, are considerably reduced. Owing to the
keen competition for trade prevailing among
wholesale dealers consumers continue to be sup
plied at extremely low prices, although all the Coal
from Great Britain and Australia now afloat has
passed from first hands and cannot be replaced,
especially from the first-named source, unless at a
considerable advance in price."

He Swallowed Leeches.
What imagination will do I can show
from my own experience, says a writer in
Good Words. When a boy, in the
Pyrenees, I once drank from a spring and
saw, to my horror, when â¢ I had already
swallowed a mouthful, that the water was â 
alive with small leeches. I toad a bad
time of it for two or three days. I firmly
believed I had leeches alive and Bucking !
my blood inside me. I felt them. â¢ I
became ..languid... I believed they would
drain my blood away.'* Happily, my father
beard what was the matter with me-and ;
explained to me the corrosic nature of the
â¢ gastric fluid, and assured me that nothing
living and of the nature of a leech could
resist it. "My dear boy," said he, "from
personal observation of your proceedings
at meal time I am convinced you could
digest a pair of boots, and no leeches could i
stand a moment against the force of your
gastric fluid." I believed him and forgot
all about my imaginary fluid. .

The New Commissioner Writes
to the Pacific Coast
Auxiliaries.
I
AEMY DEARER THAN FAMILY.
A Strorg quest That the Auxiliary
Â° - i
League Stand by Ballington
Booth's Successor.
Oakland Office Bah Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 3. f
Every auxiliary member of the Salvation
Army on the Pacific Coast received their
first letter from the new commander, Eva
C. Booth, to-day. It is as follows:
Auxiliary Department, P. A., ;
New York City. j
Dear Friend: You will have heard with deep '
sorrow, I am sure, of the resignation of Com
mander and Mrs. Ballington Booth. who for
nine years have arduously and devotedly
striven to advance the work of the Salvation
Army and uplift the sunken, Christless, church- ,
less people of your country.
This resignation constitutes nothing short of !
a worldwide sorrow to our movement, and, iv j
its personal aspect, delivers a blow at the aged |
and honored head of our belovered general as
well as at his family, the extent of which it is
impossible to describe.
There is not one of the general's seven chil
dren righting under our flag who would not
gladly lay down his or her life to avert such a i
catastrophe, not only for their own sake;, bat
for what is dearer to them than the ties of flesh
and bloodâ the welfare of this movement.
which is admitted by Christians in all parts
of the world to be the most practical and sue- !
cessful in reaching, reforming and saving the ;
lower orders of society. But when, as in the
case of your friends, Commander and Mrs. Bal- ;
lington Booth, the very foundation principles
. of our order are at stake, 'henâ painful, aye, J
terrible as the consequences may beâ have
but one course fo pursue, one thing only to i
which to adhere. We must sacrifice personal j
â¢ considerations and stand by our principles.
* . And this, I desire to assure you, is the main
. issue between international Headquarters and j
Commander and Mrs. Ballington Booth.
They ascribe their resignation, which was
dated as far back as January 31, to loss of con- j
. fi _ence in the general a:. lin our international i
. system of administration. Into the history of i
the proceedings which thi3 resignation caused \
1 do not propose to go; you will not ext>ect me,
I am certain, as I have no power to decide upon
the merits of the case. I come to your country j
as a sister to plead with a brother that he j
*. should see his father or confer with interna
â  tior.al headquarters upon his differences. I j
. was ably seconded by my brother, Com
. mandaut Herbert Booth, and also by a trusted j
representative of the general. Our united ef
* â¢ forts failed, however, and now the entire con
troversy, with its original cause, has been
.-.- transferred to London for decision.
* Just when 1 was thinking of returning to
.England with a broken heart I received orders
. take command of the forces la the United
â ' States until the Commissioners appointed by
the general arrive, i had not the slightest
idea when I left London a fortnight ago that I
â¢this stupendous, responsibility would be the!
* outcome cf my mediatorial visit, and as I write j
1 air. deeply conscious of my ow:i insufficiency
and weakness for the task. But lam a soldier, j
and already the prompt response of my new |
officers and troops have cheered me beyond j
â¢ measure. The Drigadicrs to a man have j
pTedg-ed iniinii i *nÂ«jr devotion to the army. '
â¢ Every hour brings assurances of confidence j
from field officers, and among some of the let- j
ters which will be tasting treasures to me are i
tacse from the great army of auxiliaries, which i
3 "has been so successfully enrolled in this coun
triy.
â¢ ;AII this comforts me, and 1 am sure that I
. may rely upon you, during my short stay, to
continue to help us to cairy -joy to the sorrow
ful, rest to the weary and help to the poor, |
arid I think also that I may count upon your i
â sympathy and prayers.
. . The importation of so many foreign ques- !
tions to the agitation which has raged round j
. the commander's "farewell" and resignation
.*' will make my command a far more easy one. ;
Still, with the conviction of the wisdom and j
- Tightness of our position, I shall do my best to :
show the spirit of a true Christian and a val
iant soldier.
God is with us. The flag of the Salvation
Army is with us. My comrades are with us,
and from ail that I can gather, I believe that*
you will stand by us. May I?
Yours, in sorrow and faith for the salvation
oi souls ad the welfare of America,
Eva C. Booth, Commissioner.
The general feeling in army circles in
this City is in favor of the new com
mander, ami no hindrance is anticipated
from the change.

AN ALAMEDA INJUNCTION.
The Right of the City to Go Into
the Business of Selling Light
to Be Tested.
' Death of Mrs. John T. McLean, Wife of
Alameda's Health Officerâ Hitch
Over a Deputy Assessor.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 3.â There is a
growing impression that if legal proceed
ings are pushed the Board of City Trustees
will be bothered considerably to have its
contracts carried out to enlarge the city's
electric plant. There are plenty of men of
standing and good judgment, some of
them lawyers of repute, who are of opinion
that the board has transcended its powers
in levying a direct tax to raise $30,000 or
thereabouts with which to enlarge the
city's electric plant, so that the munici
pality may _o into the commercial busi
ness of selling light, and that without sub
mitting the proposition in any way to the
people for approval. A conference was
held between some of Ihe contractors and
the municipal board on Monday night
after the regular meeting of the " board.
Three contractors were represented.
Asked if they would be willing to go on
with their contracts in the face of the liti-
I gation that was threatened they replied
j that they would, ana that some of the
! machinery contracts- were already under
way of being tilled. There is little doubt
but the board's legal right to enter into
these contracts will be fully tested, and if
it shall be determined that they have ex
ceeded their authority there promises to
be a nice question of liability for somebody
10 settle as a result of the large transac
tions already entered into.
Death of MxÂ», McLean.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 3.â Mrs.Mary
Eliza McLean, the wife of Alameda's
Health Officer, died this morning at 4
i o'clock. Sue had been for ten years a
j chronic sufferer from diabetes, but had
I been dangerously ill for only two weeks.
â  Deceased was a native of New York City
and OS years of age. She was married to
John T. McLean In 1862, and came to Cali
fornia with him the same year. She leaves
a son, Sterling, and two daughters, Mary
H. and Elizabeth . M. The lirst-named
daughter is a teacher in the public schools.
Dr. McLean, is in Washington, where he
went on official business. His son and
daughters have advised him to remain
until his mission is finished, as he could
not reach home in time for the funeral
under any circumstances.' The funeral
services will take place to-morrow after
noon from her late residence, and it is
expected that the Rev. Dr. Briggs will offi
ciate.
Municipal Assessments.
ALAMEDA, .'Cal./- March The City
Trustees have enacted an ordinance by
which property-owners are required to re
turn valuations of their property within
thirty days, on pain of an arbitrary as
sessment by the Assessor and of forfeiting
the right to appeal therefrom. The As
sessor has been granted permission to em
ploy a deputy to assist aim at a salary of
$75 a month. A deputy had already been
employed by the board, which the Assessor
refused to accept, and then he was empow
ered to appoint his son.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1896.
DIRECTOR LEACH RESIGNS
! A New Surprise Last Night at
the Home for the Adult
Blind.
OLD EMPLOYES EEINSTATEI-*.
Max Glass of Alameda Appointed Clerk.
A Statement by Ex-Mayor
Spaulding.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 3. f
Director Frank A. Leach oi the Homo
for Adult Blind created a surprise when
the board met by announcing that he had
mailed his resignation to the Governor
this evening. Mr. Leach made no remarks
further than to say that he informed the
beard so that they would not appoint him
on any important committee with instruc
tions to report at the next meeting.
The directors of the Home of the Adult
Blind at their meeting to-night reinstated
the three men removed by the former
trustees about eighteen months ago. They
were Messrs. Taylor, Tuck and Nelson.
Max Glass of Alameda, who has been night
watcbtna'n since Superintendent Hays
assumed control, was made clerk, vice A.
Dice, removed by flays. The latter
named Mr. Flood of Alameda for the posi
tion, but when the latter visited the insti
tution he refused the position. *
L. A. Mulialy, a clerk in a local grocery
store, was appointed to succeed Glass as
night watchman. A former employe, one
Teddick, was appointed to a position in
the broom factory, displacing Dan Weider
and T. Ploughman, two blind inmates.
The change saves the wages of one man.
At the last meeting of the directors a
question regarding the funds of the home
was discussed at some length, in which
Directors Irish and Leach were in the
minority. The former said he would pre
pare a statement embracing the former
action of the directors, which he would
present and have placed on file so that it
might be had for future reference. Just
before the meeting closed to-night Director
Leach called this to the attention of the
board, and remarked:
"For obvious reasons, which you all un
derstand, Colonel Irish cannot present the
report to-night, and as I have it here I
will offer it as my statement, and ask that
it be read and be placed on file."
The report was read and filed as re
quested.
In speaking of his resignation Mr. Leach
said that it was very evident that it is the
intention of the present board to entirely
ignore the work done in the past.
' "I have been working for the good of
the home since it was first started,'' said
Mr. Leach, "and it has been a labor of love
with both Colonel Irish and myself, and I
think we are entitled. to a little considera
tion on account of our experience, if for
nothing more. At the first meeting after
Budd's appointees took their seats it was
very evident there was a desire to ignore
ail the precedents of the board. Even in
little things this disposition was mani
fested, ana it hurt my feelings. Superin
tendent Hays took upon himself to upset
ail the rule* that we had formulated as
the result of thirteen years of experience.
I went to the home when it only contained
about six inmates and I have watched its
growth, and- I think that both Colonel
Irish and myself are entitled to some con
sideration.
"The trouble that culminated in the dis
charge of the three men reinstated tonight
was the result of having to enforce disci
pline. The men were among the earliest
inmates, and when the manner of conduct
ing the home as a large family was Im
practicable on account of the large increase
in the number of inmates it became neces
sary to adopt a system of discipline.
"The men rebelled, made themselves ob
noxious, and we had no alternative but to
fire them. Another rule we made with re- !
gard to the visiting between male and fe- !
male inmates was rendered - necessary.
Where such risks occur discipline must be
maintained in accordance.
"Hay 3 has abandoned some of these
rules, and their speedy abolition is not a
very gentlemanly position to take toward
those who have --pent year, in framing
them. I thought perhaps the Governor
might treat me as he did John P. Irish,
but when I convinced myself that he did
not intend to, I concluded to resign." .
N. W. Spaulding, ex-Mayor of Oakland,
and formerly treasurer of the United States
at San Francisco and trustee of the Chabot
Home, who was removed from the Blind
Home, director}* by Budd in November
last, was interviewed and made the follow
ing statement about the affairs of that in
stitution:
I have read what has been published of late In
regard to the management of the Home for the
Adult Blind. J I served as a director about one
year and took a ereat interest in its manage
ment. J, like Mr. Morrow, entered upon my
duties with doubts concerning the methods
which had been employed by the directors
and superintendent in conducting the institu
tion.
The impressions were formed from the com
plaints of Rome of the inmates who had been
disciplined and suspended or expelled and
from newspaper articles criticizing the man
agement of the home.
Several years ago I spent about seven months
visiting the penal and charitable institutes of
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
. Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri, Massachu
setts an 1 Maine, where I acquired. much infor
mation concerning the management of the
deaf and dumb and blind, the reformatory
schools, the homes for old pcoole, and tbe
schools and homes for the feeble minded and
orphanages. v 7 . '%.'
These claimed the most of my attention and
sympathy, hence when I became one" of the
directors of the Home for the Adult Blind in
California I felt in some degree competent to
judge what should be done for the 'best in
terests of those unfortunate men and women,
for whose comfort and support the State bad so
bountifully provided and who are entirely de
pendent upon those in whose charge they are
placed.
These people (the inmates) are of all na
tionalities and from all stations in life, with
and without educationâ from the happy home,
from the hovel and ; from the gutter, of ages
from 21 to 75 years. Many of them had long
been neglected and were addicted to intemper
ance and other bad habits which are hard to
control and were unaccustomed to restraints
or discipline. 3
Nearly one hundred of these people congre
gated together in an institution require ex
perience, thought, patience, J judgment, for
i bearance and untiring care in order to do the
j best that can be done for the welfare of such a
heterogeneous mass. Discipline, order V add
obedience to rules and regulations must be en
forced.
When entering upon my duties as one of the
directors, in justice to all concerned I made a
careful investigation of its affairs as they then
existed, and was pleased to approve of all that
had been done. * "
3 I found that the inmates , were well fed with
good food, having a plenty at all times and of
the best I have ever seen ,at any similar insti
tution; they were in good health. Every de
partment, from cellar to garret, was absolutely
clean and tidy. The directors and superin
tendent were attentive and considerate, re
luctantly suspending or expelling those who
persistently violated the rules, and only then
in cases where it was absolutely necessary for
the protection of the other inmates and the
good of the home.
The institution was managed just as the
good people of the State would be likely to de
sire that it should beâ in a kind and humane
manner in every detail. Every complaint was
listened to and considered, from whatever
source.
Colonel John P. Irish, the chairman of the
board, has been a director since the institution
was put under a distinct board over nine years
ago and has devoted much of his time in the
interest of the home and its inmates. He was
present at the home in and out of season,
never tiring of doing anything to promote the
welfare of all.
After all that can truthfully be said in praise
of the devotion and attention given to the in
stitution by Colonel Irish, Mr. Leach and Mr.
Morrow, I accord most praise to the blind su
perintendent, Mr. Sanders, to whom more than
all others we are indebted for the social, moral
and financial success of the Blind Home. He is
really a remarkable man. In ear\y life he was
deprived of his sight; he acquired a good edu
cation, spent several years in the Blind Home
In Philadelphia, where ne mastered such trades
as the blind could work at, and for many years
taught these trades there. Ten years ago he
came here and was employed as a teacher in
the home, from which position he was pro
moted to that of superintendent.
Since then he has been slandered and abused
because ho could not be made a tool of by de
signing parties who had private interests to
further. His position has been coveted by
others, not for the good they could do, but for
the private gain they hoped to acquire.
I found Mr. Sanders to be a gentleman of
refined manners, good morals and sympathetic,
with a good word for every inmate with whom
he came in contact. He understood their needs
and cheerfully administered to their wants.
He put the institution in perfect order and ad
ministered it with great economy. He acted
for years as teacher without extra pay, and
when the seeing foreman of the broom shop,
who had been necessary under seeing super
intendents who were ignorant of the business,
died, he took upon himself that duty.
In this way I estimate that he saved the State
during his term in salaries alone between
â¢SSOOO and $6000. His record was truthfully
stated by Colonel Irish in the speech nominat
ing him for re-election last November. Neither
the Governor nor any one has contradicted
that record, nor can they, for it is a part of the
official documents of the State. His wife, a
noble woman, served during his superin
tendency as matron of the home, also without
a penny of pay. and her record of sacrifice and
devotion to the blind and unfortunate, and her
unselfish and unrequited work by the side of
her husband, deserved better than the cold
hearted treatment both have suffered at the
hands of high authority.
I notice that the inmates have signed a let
ter to the Governor thanking him for the re
cent "reforms" in the home. Among them are
many who chafed at salutary discipline now
entirely withdrawn, and many who, in their
helplessness, feel their dependence on their
officers. By such a letter no one should be
deceived. The inmates without exception fur
nished a truer index than this to their feelings
that sorrowful night last December when the
blind superintendent, his wife and little child
left the home. He was stricken down by the
hand of party greed and unthinking lust for
place. He was no longer in power, over them
and all these inmates gathered and sobbed
their farewells, making a scene which the
new officers did not care to face.' v
That was the touch of nature from the
hearts of those find men and women, not pur
chased by promises, for he had none to make.
The thinking people of mis State will offset it
against present expressions procured by any
means by he person who is enjoying posses
sion of a blind man's place. * v
The expulsion of Mr. San'ljrsifcould bring a
blush to tne cheek of every man concerned in
it. It was a step toward the wrecking of this
institution, and all for the purpose of giving a
place to one without the experience or
knowledge necessary, but who was out of a
job, for the purpose of paying a political debt,
ft! was never more dumfounded than when
Witnessing the cold-blooded, deliberate : and
prearranged decapitation of Mr. Sanders by
Budd's directors, who, circumstances show,
were appointed for this purpose, and who must
have known the sacrifice they were making to
carry out this nefarious scheme.
SUICIDE BY HANGING.
A Lii verm-re Lad Takes His Life and
No Explanation Can Be
Offered. ,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, March 3. f
News was received at the morgue this
afternoon of the suicide of Eddie Mc-
Caw of Livermore, who hanged himself
at that town after luncn.
When one of the employes of Robin
son's cigar-store went into a rear room he
saw the body of McCaw suspended from
the roof. It was at once seen that he was
dead. The lad was about 21 years old and
a son of Daniel McCaw, barkeeper of the
Hayward3 Hotel. Some years ago the
family lived in Oakland.
No letter or message was left by the de
ceased to explain his act, and the only ex
planation that can be even guessed at is
that he had been in a depressed state of
mind for several days, caused by hearing
that his mother was sick. McCaw was
considered rather a wild young man and
it is considered strange that the illness of
his mother affected him as it did. This
forenoon he was not at work, but at noon,
after getting his dinner, he went to the
shop and took off his coat, as if to go to
work. He then went to his room, and
when he did not at once: reappear it was
supposed that he had gone out by a rear
door. Nothing was suspected until he was
found by Robinson hanging from the ceil
ing, dead. His mother is believed to be
in Pleasanton. She and her husband sep
arated some time ago. The inquest will
be held to-morrow.

The friends of the boy burglars who were

If this statement be true, the Governor could
not act upon the pardon application until four
Justices of the Supreme Court recommend the
pardon. In the next place, if this were a case

The Junior Order of American
Mechanics Opens Its State
Convention.
A FUND TO ASSIST MEMBERS.
Exclusively for Those Who Lose Their
. Positions Because of Joining
the Order.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 3. )
The State Council of the Junior Order of
American Mechanics convened in Festi
val Hall this morning. Tne State officers
present were: Councilor H. C. Schaertzer,
Vice-Councilor E. F. Howe, Junior Past
Councilor L. S. Butler, Secretary George
E. Terry, Treasurer C. N. Wilson, Conduc
tor W. S. Post, Warden C. M. Baiiy, In
side. Sentinel L. C. Judkins, Outside Sen
tinel C. H. Thomas. . â  . 3- .
The first business of the session was to
give the State Council degree to those who
had never taken it. After this the State
Councilor read his^report. It was very
lengthy and gave the details of the history
of the order in this Slate.
"The officers of the State Council," said
the councilor, "have assisted in many
ways. I can find no adequate words in
which to express my thanks to our State
Council Secretary, Brother George E.
Terry, and our State Council Treasurer,
Brother C. N. Wilson. Every task im
posed on either was cheerfully and quickly
performed, and I owe them a debt of grat
itude for their -assistance and uniform
courtesy which it will be" hard to repay.
During'the past year the membership of
the subordinate couucils has steadily in
creased and wo have to-day over 2300
Americans in this State pledged to main
tain the principles of our order."
The closing of the report recommends
that provisions be made in the constitu
tion for chaplain in the State and subor
dinate councils; the requirement for a
charter to be raised from fifteen to twenty
six applicants, with twenty applicants
present on the night of institution; com
pensation for the incoming State Coun
cilor; - increase of salary for State secre
tary to $150, and several minor matters.
The report of the secretary shows the
number of councils in the State to be
25, charters issued during the year 9 and
number of members 1968. With an esti
mated gain of members of 275 since De
cember 31: makes the gain for the year
1234.
In closing the report the secretary says:
"Noting with regret ; that many of our
members have hesitated about joining with
parades when celebrating "Washington's
birthday and the Fourth of July through
fear of losing their positions, I would rec
ommend that this State Council suggest to
the subordinate councils of this State the
advisability of the several councils creating
a sinking fund for the purpose of assisting
members of this order -who may lose their
positions on account of their membership
therein until another position may be found
for them. Such fund to be raided by regu
lar monthly dues of 25 cents or such an
amount as each council may determine."
Regarding the order in Alameda County
the State councilor said : "About the lat
ter part of November the councils of Ala
meda County took up the matter of bring
ing the members more closely together and
organized a county " union committee.
That committee, under the efficient lead
ership of Brother P. Salisbury, the chair
man, has outlined a plan of work which,
if closely pursued and persevered in, will
ere long make Alameda County the ban
ner Jr. 0. U. A. county in California.
They are providing for union meetings of
councils and the placing of a council in
each town of that county which can sup
port one."
To-morrow there will be three sessions
and an election of officers. At noon the
delegates will be given a lunch by the local
branch of the Daughters of Liberty.
FOR A SCHOOL ELECTION
Berkeley's Board of Education
Votes to Call for $60,000
Bonds for Schools.
Students' Experiences With Governor
, â  Buddâ Regarding Regent Rein
steinâNews Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., . March 33â The
Board of Education passed a resolution
last night calling a special election for
Saturday, April 4, to secure bonds for
*fOO,OOO to be used in the erection and
equipment of certain needed school build
ings. Some little discussion took place
before the adoption of the resolution,
Director Norton having favored the special
election plan. The election, which they
finally voted to call for. will be held under
the school district plan. There will be
one polling place, at the Kellogg School,
and one set of election officers, so that the
expense entailed in this election will be
far less than that of .a municipal election.
J. 3 Donahue and H. T. Greenough were
named , as * judges of election and W. H.
Kerrison inspector. . : r . - -
The board appointed a committee of
three to report on the matter of teachers'
salaries,' with a view a possible read
justment of salaries when the time comes
for r appointment of teachers. The com
mittee will collect statistics from all parts
of the State and - country on the matter
of salaries paid by other municipalities to
teachers, . and i will report *to the 3 : board
before the end of the school year, at which
time the question of : appointments \ and
reappointments is considered. ; It is possi
ble that the salaries paid *> to '? Berkeley
teachers may be readjusted at that time. * -
Several cases of insubordination in the
schools of this district were reported to
the board by Principal "Warnick. 'â â  Four
boys had been expelled; on that; account.
The action of the principaL in expelling
the boys was upheld. , One \of those who
had been' required to leave school was
present, and asked that he be .again
allowed /to attend. ,3 Permission was
granted to him* after ; having t promised
not to repeat his unruly conduct. ;*,;
students "Petition the Governor. .
'. BERKELEY; Cal., March 3.â*? We can' t
return to/the .university until you have
given us your word that Regent Reinstein
will be apnoint-d to a long term." These
are the words 5 spoken to Governor ; Budd
yesterday by; the committee"; of two/ con
sisting of Fred W. Koch and A. W. North,
who were appointed by the students of the
university to carry a -petition: from; them
to the I executive,' asking for the appoint
ment of Reinstein to a term of sixteen
years as regent,' to fill one of the vacancies
made by ' the/ expiration>of; the; terms of
Regents Bartlett and Phelps Marco 13* 3 â ;
The . Governor, they say, took ; up': the
petition;/ bearing 3 two *. signatures, and
glanced i it /over J in his usual ;: meditative
way, 3 without showing any signs of the
manner in which â â  it impressed him. "I
will * consider * the matter," said % he, "and
see what can be" done." ;"* "But we ; cannot
return tocolleee,'' replied the representa
tives of the student body, "until we have
j your word th at Reinstein will get a long
j term." Finally the Governor acquiesced,:
to a certain extent, and said, ''We will see
that he gets it somehow." The news was
at once telegraphed; to Berkeley, where it
was ; heralded v with delight ; among the
students, since they realized that Mr.
Reinstein could not- do all he has in mind
for the welfare of : the institution in the
four years of the unexpired term which he
is now serving. *â¢"
3 The two messengers of the university
returned to Berkeley at noon to-day, and
have been telling of the. experiences with
the Governor and the great difficulty they
had in getting to see him. They went to
Stockton on Sunday morning, and upon
arriving there found that the Governor
was off on a duck hunt. * * -
Late in the afternoon word came that he
had arrived in town. They went . to his
hotel and to his house, but could not find
him. â - Later they found; that :he was at
home, but could not be seen until Monday
morning. Report reached the two dele
gates that the Governor intended going
south on an early train, but this was after
ward disputed. Going to his house early
Monday morning they got to see him, after
waiting for a considerable time. Soon
they left the house bearing the tidings
that the petition of the 600 would have its
desired effect.

NO WATER COMBINATION
President Dingee Says There Is
No Truth in Reports to
the Contrary.
In Proof of This Contracts Are Now
Being Made for Three Years at
Present Rates.
Oakland Office San .Francisco Call,!
908 Broadway, March 3. â  f â 
President Dingee of the Oakland Water
Company denies that there is any pros
pect of a consolidation of . his company
with the Contra Costa company.
"There is to be no combination with the
Contra Costa stockholders," said Mr.
Dingee today, "and there is no prospect
or possibility that there ever will be. We
have no use for the Contra Costa and
there is nothing to justify a rumor that
a combination will be made. It is true
that there is little or no money being
made in the water business in Oakland,
but everything that now is I anticipated
when we crn barked in our enterprise.
"As to the City Council reducing rates
I have little to say. Of course Ido not
care to see our income curtailed any,
but I have confidence in the Council.
It is its policy to reduce the price paid
per month per hydrant and to increase
the number of hydrants. I believe that
this will work no hardship.: Mr. Davis,
the attorney for our company, presented
our idea* to the committee in a public
way, as we have a right to do. I do not
intend to argue the matter with the j
Councilmen. I have seen none of them ;
about it, nor will I, for, as I said before, I
am perfectly satisfied with what they do.
"We are now making contracts with our
customers for a term as long as three years
at legal rates. That does not indicate com
bination, does it? A few days ago we sent
to each of our patrons an address. We told
them to stand by us and we would stand
by them. That our company is making a
strong bid for popularity with the people
I admit. The story that we were about to
combine and raise rates would not add
much to our popularity, hence it is easy
to be seen who is interested in circulating
the falsehood."
At last night's meeting of the City Coun
cil the rates for hydrants were reduced
from $ 2 25 to $1 75. There is an ordinance
in course of passage providing an addi
tional number of hydrants so that the
unions of the water companies will remain
about the same.
BRETZ IS SLATED TO GO
He Discards His Wife and the
Commissioners Discard
Him.
Wishes His Hasty Marriage Were
Already Set Aside, as He
Greatly Regrets It.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
008 Broadway, March 3. f
Clifford Bre'tz wishes he were not mar
ried. He says it was all a joke and that he
was married while he was in a stupor. His
sole anxiety now is to retain his situation,
and he does not seem to have much regard
for the feelings of the lady who is only his
wile in name. . Â
3 Speaking of the affair to-day, while con
fined to his bed with pneumonia, he said:
3' I was drunk and had been for "several days.
1 had been drunk for I two or three days, and it
all came from a friend advising me to take
whisky and gum because I was feeling sick. ? I
am not in the habit of getting intoxicated, but
the whisky and gum started me. and I was un
der the Influence of liquor for several days. I
don't - remember clearly 'how* I 'went to the
Itsell home or anything about what happened.
I remember after the ceremony >we all drank,
and Judge Groezinger; raised his right hand
over a cocktail and promised to keep the affair
secret. ; I "don't know who asked him to keep it
secret perhaps the girl did. - ; ,
ft I never- knew * Miss Itsell .very; well. I met
her about six months ago, and have called at
the house two or three times, but never alone.
I - never made love to > her, or ' proposed â¢' or
thought of marrying her.*- She may be consid
ered by some a pretty girl, but she is not the
style I admire. ,**-,, . â -.*_- 7 .-. ."â 'â â  .*".-. '
.;! did not marry her or get . drunk because I
was piqued with another young lady. I never
was i engaged to any young lady on Van Ness
avenue or anywhere else. Of course I have
been â :â¢ on â ' friendly s terms :' with ;a â¢, number of
young ladies, but it was not on account of any
lover's quarrel , that I was married; to Miss It
sell. It was simply because I was drunkâ in a
sort of a trance, as it were. . â¢..â¢*. :
;.â¢-. I have never met the girl's father and ' have
never said anything to him. I saw the girl
when I came back' from my trip and i guess
she is as willing to have the affair forgotten as
lam. I did not go away because I repented of
my action or am thing of the kind. 1 went on
the trip 1 â  had originally planneu, ami it was
on private business. The thought of my mar
riage came â¢ over me once in ; awhile like the
report of a Chinese firecracker, but it was all a
misty remembrance for the most part. "
I have not planned anything for the future.
I will try to go back to my position in a day or
two. What the girl will do about the mar
riage, 1 don't know. The whole thing was all
a josh, anyway.
It was reported at the Board of Works
to-night that the resignation of young
Bretz will be asked to-morrow, and a
young man named Hall will be appointed
his successor.

SEIZED MAYOR
SUTRO'S LETTERS
Missives to Congressmen
Held at the Post
office.
DEPARTMENTAL ORDERS.
Senator Chandler and. Other Rep
resentatives Asked for
Protection.
INSCRIPTIONS OBJECTED TO.
The Envelopes Stated That Hunting
ington Would Not Steal a
Red Hot Stove.
On orders from Postoffice Department
headquarters at Washington a large num
ber of letters sent out by Mayor Sutro's
Bureau of Information, which he has been
using to warn the Nation's representatives
at Washington of the schemes of C. P.
Huntington, have been seized by Postmas
ter McCoppin and refused passage through
the mails.
â Shortly after the story had been printed
that the concurrent resolution passed by
the last Legislature aeainst the Reilly re
funding bill Pad failed to reach the eyes
for which it was intended the Bureau be
gan sending out fac-similes of a cartoon
representing President Huntiugton hold
ing the resolution behind his back to pre
vent the members of Congress from see
ing it.
Across the top of the envelopes was
printed in bold red letters:
tC. P. HUNTINGTON* WOULD NOT STEAL A BED-:
: hot stove. :
The letters had hardly reached "Wash
ington when various members of the
Senate and House of Representatives sent
complaints to the Postoffice Department,
objecting to such missives being delivered
to them, and asking protection for the
future.
A telegram was at once sent to San
Francisco, instructing Postmaster McCop
pin to stop all such letters delivered at the
office under his charge for mailing. This
was accordingly done, and several hun
dred envelopes bearing the words to which
the department objects are now held in
Mr. McCoppin 's care.
"The words printed on the envelopes of
Mayor Sntro's inclosures to the members
of Congress were plainly objectionable/
said Postmaster McCoppin last evening,
"and are also non-mailable under the post
office regulations.
"A week or so ago we received word from
the Postoffice Department that Senator
Chandler and other National representa
tives had complained that they "were re
ceiving communications which they ob
jected to and the authorities at headquar
ters were requested to prevent the delivery
of any more envelopes containing such in
scriptions. As the rules of the department
not only prohibit the passage of envelopes
inscribed with libelous or scurrilous
words, but give the person fer whom they
are intended the right to refuse to receive
them, we were instructed to see that no
more of the kind went through the post
office.
"That is why they were held and, fur
thermore, we shall hold any or all that
contain words equally or more objection
able.
"I do not remember now just what the
words were, except that they referred to
C. P. Huntington and stealing, but I do
remember that I considered the matter
carefully when it was brought to my at
tention and that at the time I was satisfied
that the letters were non-mailable and in
violation of the regulations."
Outside of Postmaster McCoppin and
the clerks who received the letters few of
the postoffice employes were aware that
the letters had been seized. When told
the nature of the inscription on the letter
last evening, however. Night Inspector
Alexander M. Cox at once said that enve
lopes containing such matter were non
mailable, and that any person mailing
them or causing them to be mailed was
violating the postal regulations and was.
liable to prosecution for the offense.
He called attention to the following sec
tion of the postal laws and regulations
bearing on the subject:
Sec. 332. Scurrilous matter. All that mat
ter, otherwise mailable by law, upon the en
velope or outside cover, or wrapper of which,
or any postal card upon which any delinea
tions, epithets, terms or language of an inde
cent, lewd, lascivious, obscene, libelous, scur
rilous,defamatory or threatening character, or
calculated by the terms or manner or style of
display, and obviously intended to reflect in
juriously upon the character or conduct of
another may be written or printed, or other
wise impressed or apparent, are hereby de
clared non-mailable, and shall not be conveyed
in the mails, nor delivered from any postoffice,
nor by any letter-carrier, and shall be with
drawn from the mails under such regulations
as the Postmater-General shall prescribe, and
any person who shall knowingly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, for mailing or delivery,
anything declared by the section to be non
mailable matter, and any person who shall
knowingly take the same, or cause the same
to be taken from the mails, for the purpose of
circulating or disposing of or of aiding in the
circulation or disposition of the same, shall
for each arid every offense, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not more than .SSOOO, or im
prisoned at hard labor not more than five
years, or both, at the discretion of the court.
(Act of June 18, 1888, as amended September
26, 1888.)
Mayor Sutro had received no notifica
tion from the Postoffice officials that his
iuclosures to the members of Congress had
been seized when told of the matter last
evening.
"1 am sorry the letters have not reached
their destinations," said he, "but I am
more than pleased at the reasons of the
seizure.
"It shows that we have them scared.
They know that if people see such letters
addressed to them they, will think they

and that is just what we want. We want
to scare them into doing what is right and

men who kick are railroad men and do
not want the public at large to know it.
If they were ' upright men and above sus
picion they would not object to receiv

schemes to rob the people.
"Bui you can rest assured that we will
not stop warning them of their danger of
being known as railroad tools. We will
go them one better occasion requires.
Those letters contained cartoons showing
Huntington in the act of robbing the
people of the effect of the concurrent reso
lution passed by the Legislature, ana such
things have their effect. It lis one of the
best weapons we have of fighting the oc
topus, and we are not going to lose it
without a struggle.
"Now, I think the Postoffice people are
wrong about stopping those letters on the
ground that the envelopes contained libel
ous and scurrilous matter. I have con
sulted attorneys on the subject, and am
told that there is nothing actionable in
such a statement. We shall see whether
our bands are going to be tied in this mat
ter or not. ; i
"There are 100,000 men in this State who
know that if Huntington would not steal a
red-hot stove there are other things
against the law that he would do, and we
want the members of Congress and the
world at large to know just what Kind of a
man he is.''
THE DANIELS TRIAL.
Opening of the "Examination Before the
Court-Martial in the Federal
Building.
The trial of Lieutenant Daniels began,
before the court-martial in the Federal
building yesterday afternoon. Lieutenant
Reynolds acted as Judge Advocate and
Lieutenant Ross appeared for the ac
cused officer of the Revenue cutter. It is
asserted that a very weak case was made
out aeainst the young lieutenant and
there is general belief that he will be ac
quitted.
Among the charges preferred against
Daniels was one of "nervous disorder."
This was to be inferred as a mental de
rangement, but Dr. Blue was called and
testified that he had examined Daniels and
did not find him suffering from any mental
disorder at the time specified.
The other charges against Daniels in
clude drunkenness and insubordination.

GUARDSMEN WERE RIGHT.
They Are Voluntarily Offered the
Rebate That Was Agreed
Upon.
The Southern Pacific Company Not
Anxious to Be Sued for Big
Damages.
The Southern Pacific Company has de
cided that rather than face the alternative
of answering seventy-five suits which
members of the National Guard threaten
to bring because of the treatment received
on the occasion of their recent visit to the
State shoot at Sacramento it will return
the amounts paid by the guardsmen in
excess of the $4 15 agreed upon as the
round-trip fare.
As the time for the State shoot ap
proached the company was asked to make
a rebate in view of the fact that it was a
State affair and a large number of guards
men would attend. An agreement was
reached by which the company promised
to give a rebate equal to two-thirds of the
return fare. This would bring the return
fare to 85 cents for each man from San
Francisco and make the total fare $4 15.
In order to prevent, as the company
claimed, residents of Sacramento then in
this City from taking advantage of the re
bate and getting to their homes for $2 10,
the company exacted $3 30 for the going
trip from each of the guardsmen, giving
each a receipt for that amount and an
agreement to sell a return-trip ticket for
the one-third rate on a certificate from the
inspector-general of rifle practice that the
holder had been in attendance at the
shoot.
In spite of these facts and the further
fact that the certificates mentioned were
made out in due form the agent at Sacra
mento refused to deliver any tickets un
less full fare was paid, and the San Fran
cisco boys were compelled to produce $2 50
each or $5 80 in all' for the round trip.
Those from distant points were also com
pelled to pay full fare.
The guardsmen considered this an im
position and decided that unless the com
pany refunded the money paid in excess
of the amount agreed upon" they would
sue for the excess and also for damages.
. These matters came to the ears of Gen
eral Passenger Agent Goodman a few days
ago and he promptly began an investiga
tion that resulted yesterday in the guards
men being notified that if they, would pre
sent their receipts for the money paid the
agents at San Francisco and* Sacramento
the amount in excess of $4 15 would be
refunded to them.
The Sacramento agent is blamed for not
carrying out the agreement printed on the
back of the receipts.
LOST HUSBAND AND LOT.
Peculiar Suit of Mrs. Josephine Titus
Against Her Fiance.
Mrs. Josephine Titus â¢ is suing James

company from her in a peculiar way. Sue
says that in December last Pedlina asked
her to marry him, and when she consented
he suggested that she deed her lot on Mis
sion street to him and that he would put a
house upon it. When the house was finished
he would marry her, he said. She deeded
the lot and the house was built, but Pedlina
has not married her, nor does he seem in
clined to do so. . She, therefore, sued for
the recovery of her property.

There will be an interesting and exciting
meeting of the local Passenger Agents"Asso

H. W. Lounsberry, the Oakland agent of the
Burlington and Missouri, for having violated
the passenger agents' agreement. It is under
stood that the Santa Fe is behind the prosecu

lated the agreement, and the association may
have two cases to hear.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1896.
HOPE FOR THE
CITY'S LEPERS.
They Will Be Treated
With the Japanese
Remedy.
FUND FOR THE MEDICINE
Supervisor Benjamin Will Col
lect $200 to Buy the First
Trial Lot.
THE GOTO CURE TO BE TRIED
City Physician O'Brien Favors the
Experiment in the Leper
Hospital.
The fact that some hope remains for
lepers through the efficacy of a compara
tively new remedy discovered in Japan
for the dread disease has aroused consid
erable interest among people who read
about it in The Call. The remedy has
been quite well know ; to physicians,
although its character and specific effects
on leprosy are as yet but poorly under
stood or appreciated in the medical science
of Western civilization. It has proved
singularly beneficial in Asia and the
Hawaiian Islands, and, indeed, is freely
used in the Orient and at Honolulu. But
here, in the leper hospital of San Fran
cisco, on the very threshold of the Orient,
whence the medicine comes, there are
fourteen afflicted human beings waiting
for the end and denied the benefit of this
last straw.
The one serious drawback is, there is no
municipal fund from 'which a sum of
money could be appropriated to buy
enough of this leprosy remedy for as
much as a full and satisfactory test. That
is to say, the Board of Health and the
Board of Supervisors, willing as they are
to make the experiment, can find no way
of getting money for the purpose. The
total amount needed is about $200, but
even that cannot be had through the usual
channels.
So in the presence of this helpless con
dition of the municipal autnorities to do
anything for the unfortunates in the
Twenty-sixth-street hospital, some gener
ous and sympathetic citizens have offered
to contribute to a fund which is to be used
in buying the wonderful remedy from
Japan. The following letter was received
by The Call in response to a letter from
one of the lepers to Supervisor Charles E.
Benjamin begging for treatment, and to
the Supervisor's reply that, as there was
no provision for an appropriation he would
endeavor to collect $200 and procure the
medicine by that means:
Mr. Charles M. Shortridge, Editor The Callâ
Dear Sir: It would be appreciated if you will
have the inclosed sglO placed in the proper
nands for the benefit of the lepers in whose be
half assistance is asked. Respectfully,
M. Râ , M. F.
San Francisco, Feb. 26, 1896.
The money inclosed was given to Steward
Keating of the Twenty-sixth-street hospi
tal and it is held as the nucleus of the
medicine fund.
Mr. Benjamin has been compelled by an
accident to desist in his purpose of col
lecting the $200. He is confined to his
room, but hopes to be out in a few days,
when he will start out among friends to
collect the money required.
"I have talked with many physicians
about this remedy," he said yesterday,
"and they all agreed that the experiment
would do no harm, but might result in much
good to the unfortunates in the leper hos
pital. Dr. Fitch, who used the remedy in
Hawaii, told me that it was the only medi
cine he ever found to have done any good
for the lepers. He also said that $200 worth
of the medicine would be quite sufficient
to give it a good fair trial and to show the
people of San Francisco what it could do.
"If it prove to be what I hope it is we
might be able to provide for it in the
Board of Health appropriation next time
it is made.
"My idea of handling the contribution
fund is to put it into the hands of Mayor
Sntro, who could send the money through
Wells, Fargo & Co's express to Japan; or
we might get the remedy here, cash on de
livery. I have in sight $90. An old friend,
a dry-goods merchant on Battery street,
told' me he would give $20, and $10 has
come through The Call. If we get a lit
tle more than $200 the excess can be ex
pended in purchasing many things that
the lepers badly need, such as under
clothing and personal effects, which they
are absolutely deprived of now. The
remedy cannot be got here; it must be
brought from Japan.
"All of the members of the Board of
Health said to me: 'Go ahead, we would
like to try the remedy.,'
"My idea is to turn the medicine over to
the Board of Health, and let them admin
ister it as they see tit through a physi
cian."
Dr. A. P. O'Brien, city physician, after
having seen the condition of the lepers, is
deeply interested in the remedy. "It is
known as the Goto remedy," he said, "a
Japanese medicine which has been used
in Japan with much success;, but there are
no authentic reports of cures resulting
from its use. It has been used also in the
Hawaiian Islands in the Receiving Leper
Hospital at Honolulu. Reports from there
are that doctors have seen patients get rid
of spots on the . body, characteristic of
leprosy; the thickening of the skin and
the peculiar sensation on the soles of the
feet have disappeared. So if it does noth
ing else it makes patients extremely com
fortable.
"There are two white boys in the leper
hospital who have been there for ten or
eleven years. They used the remedy to
some extent about nine years ago, and the
disease has maue no apparent progress on
them since then. When I was at the City
and County Hospital six years ago I saw
those boys at the Pesthouse, and I can say
there has not been a symptom of develop
ment in their case since.
"It is claimed also that in the tubercular
form of the disease the remedy is effective.
This form is 'distinguished I by large nod
ules and thickening of the skin. The
nodules are . scattered â  over the face and
bands, and in later stages become ulcera
ted. The result of treatment by. the Goto
remedy is these nodules to disappear and
the ulcers are healed.
"The remedy consists of herbs, some â of
which, are taken internally in the form of

"The full course of treatment ia about
one and a half to two years.
"One Chinese patient in the Twenty
sixth-street hospital succeeded in getting
some of the medicine through friends from
Japan, and he undoubtedly shows signs of
improvement. ! There is a healing "of . the
ulcers and a disappearance of the itching,
the spots; and also of > the thickening of
the skin. There are three cases in com
parative incipiency at the hospital, and if
such good results" have- been reached in
that one I am inclined to believe that the
remedy would help these materially.
"The cost of the full treatment for all
the lepers would be about $500. But there
Is no fund from which this money can be
had, and it would be impossible for the
Health Department to expend that sum at
present. * ".' * I }*'-3'"--
"Almost everything has been tried at
the hospital that has been suggested to the
medical profession since" the , institution
was established, but without other results
than that of a mere palliative of a tempo
rary nature. On- account -of the utter
hopelessness and horror of the disease it
would be a wise thing to try this new rem
edy if we could get the : money to buy it.
The remedy should be administered under
supervision of a physician, but should not
be left to the steward. This is the least
that might be done for i the ; unfortunate
outcasts, if not to cure them, at â  least to
alleviate their sufferings."

The Creditors of Henry Sherwood Are
Suing Him on the Ground
of Fraud. '
The London, Paris and American Bank,

MENT.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
the American Bank and Trust Company
and several other similar institutions are
suing the Sherwood estate to set aside cer
tain deeds made by Henry Hamilton Sher
wood to William R. Sherwood, on the
ground of fraud.
Sherwood filed a petition in insolvency
in November, : 1893, in which he alleged
that he owed something like $30,000. and
he had .but $1500 worth of property to
secure his debts. He had just succeeded
to a legacy, of $150,000, his share of his
father's estate, so the creditors hunted
around to find why it was hi 3 property had
disappeared so fast. .: X*
They found that on March 10, 1895, the
day before the will was filed for probate,
Henry Sherwood had deeded to his
brother, William R. Sherwood, all his in
terest in the property of the estate. Sub
sequently, just before he filed his petition
in insolvency, he filed a deed of similar
import. It. is these two deeds that the
plaintiffs want set aside. â 
The complaint charges that the deeds
were made to fraudulently escape from
the payments of his debts. The. claims
represented in the suit are the London,
Paris and American Bank, $0278; D. V. B.
Henarie, $7500; Josephine E. Bruguiere.

THE BEAR FINDS FAVOR.
Design That May Grace the Floor of the
Rotunda of the City Hall Tower.
City and County Attorney Cres well was
smitten with the charms of . a mosaic bÂ»ar
at a meeting of . the City Hall Commis
sioners yesterday, and declared emphatic
ally in favor of such a design for the floor
of the rotunda of _, the tower in preference
to the star that had previously found favor
in his eyes. '" 3
He objected at first to the absence of a
tail in the design, but when the agent of
the mosaic . manufacturers 3 said , that. a
tail of any proportions could easily be
added, he : gave up and : stated .: that he
would vote for the bear. ''-'
â¢ It was decided, however, to defer a final
decision on the "matter until Auditor

Peter Lane, â¢ accused of â *? a ; felonious assault

MARSICK NOT MOVED
He Can See No Art in the Labors
of the Chinese Musi
cians.
DIFFERS WITH PADEREWSKI.
Says the Instruments Are False in
Tone and the Chinese Are Una- '3
hie to Make Music.
MarsicK shrugged his shoulders when
Chinese music is mentioned. Then he
says : .
"But is it music?"
His tone indicates very decidedly that
he thinks it is not. He does not hesitate
to assert' that , such is the case. What is
more, he declares that there is absolutely
no art in their .playing, though Pader
ewski was as certain that there was.
"There are few ideas that Paderewski
has in regard to music and musicians
which I will not subscribe to most enthusi
astically," said M. Marsict yesterday.
"In fact, I Know of nothing in which we
differ widely except his admiration of the
Chinese music.
"There is only one standpoint from
which it seems interesting to me, and that
is in the nature of a curiosity. And then
it would be more correct to say that it is
amusing. We see in it the primitive music.
As to modern music, however, there is
none. How could there be, with those in
struments? They areas primitive, as the
music. The only one that could be called
a musical instrument with truth was the
flute, and it was but a piece of bamboo,
several points in length, pierced with
holes. The tone of this was false, though
it was not bo bad as the others."
If. Ma/sick explained that he was
more interested in the instruments than
in the results the Mongolian players
achieved with them. . He, too, intended to
get a job lot of them and learn their pecu
liarities and possibilities. They would be
of especial value in showing from what
the finished instruments of to-day had
been evolved.
"Art? No, no. It is not art. Every
effect is entirely mechanical. At least it
seemed so to me. ' 33 ; V r 3;
"The men , played without conviction.
There was no feeling, no soul, in their per
formance. Their stolid .faces showed as
little thought as would be exhibited in
whittling a piece of stick. They had just
such motions to make and just so many
and such notes to produce in a certain way
and they did it. There can be no art with
out feeling.
"They did not move me in the least.
They excited no new ideas. They touched
nothing responsive in my inner self. They
aroused no slumbering fancies. - Putting
feeling into their music '.' they caused
none in me."
."Was there any discernible tune in their
music?" was asked. 33313
--"Oh, yes: There ; was an air, often â¢ re
peated, that ran through it continuously."
"And what was that?"
The noted, violinist paused for a mo
ment.' Then with head nodding the time
he sang the air of the Chinese music as it
had impressed him. Asked to put it on
paper he complied readily, and then added
the five notes of the Chinese scale and:
Annotation fantaisiste de la gamine Chinoise.
% M. P. Maksick.
Translated this reads, "a fantastic an
notation of a Chinese air."*33
When this was completed M. MarsicK
was asked if there was - anything of har
mony in ; the arrangement of the Chinese
music. 'â '..'â¢ 333' â¢'â â ..
"How can there be?" he asked in return.
"They have only five notes in their scale.
Their instruments :â¢ are ; not true. That
their strings -> may; be faulty and tuned in
different keys seems not to bother them in
the least. Does not that answer you?" .

STILL TO REMAIN CHIEF.
Crowley Will Not Retire From
Office for Nearly Three â 
Years Yet.
INELEGIBLE FOR . A PENSION.
It Has Been Decided That He Must
Serve Twenty Years Con
tinuously.
Chief of Police Crowley will not retire
and his resignation will accordingly be
withdrawn at the meeting of the Police
Commissioners to-night.
This decision of the Chief has not been
caused by the lust of office, as he craves
for relief from the cares ana responsibili
ties of his position, but because he is a
poor man, and, should he retire now,
would have practically no income on which
to live.
It has been definitely settled that the
Chief's seven years' service by election
cannot be included in the sum total of his
service so as to make him eligible to be
placet- on the retired list.
Ex-Senator Murphy, who was the father
of the pension act and framed it, called
upon the Chief yesterday afternoon and
regretfully informed him that the intent
and meaning of the : act was for twenty
years' continuous servic* in the depart
ment. As there was a break of six years
between the Chief's holding office by elec
tion, and by appointment, he yet wants
two years and nine months for his twenty
years' continuous service.
'â¢There is no doubt," said the Chief, later,
"that Senator Murphy is correct. ;At
lunch to-day a prominent Judge spoke to
me to the same effect and told me there
was a decision in the Supreme Court which
covered the point.
"WeH, I must just take off my coat,
literally speaking, and buckle to the work
again for two or three years more if I am
spared.
"I shall do so the more readily owing to
the kindly and flattering way * in* which
the press has spoken of my . past \ services
and other tokens of appreciation that I
have received.
"I shall continue to do my duty as faith
ful.} and fearlessly as ever. Of that the
citizens can fully rest assured." V
The decision of the Chief has been hailed
with the greatest gratification by the de
partment and will "be coroially approved
by the citizens at large.
THE COMING REGATTA.
A Yachting Association Will Be Formed
to Compete for the Mac
donough Cup. -
Representatives from the different, yacht
clubs met Monday night at 310 Pine street i
to take preliminary steps toward forming
an inter-yachting association. Charles G.
Yale acted as chairman and stated at the
opening that the; principal object of the
organization was to combine all the clubs
on the bay â  in; the Macdonough cup re
gatta, which is to be sailed every year. â â¢?-*â¢;
â 'â - It was finally; agreed that September 9,
Admission day, would be the date set for the
race for the '96 cup. A committee of five,
one from each club, was appointed upon
; organization and another committee to
i draw up the permanent rules for the con-,
test. ;
3 Joseph Macdonough will prepare a new
cup, costing $250, every * year :: to ;be com
, peted for by ail the smaller â  yachts of * the
association. The larpf vessels, of the Jes
sie-Lurline-Chispa class, will probably not
take part in the races for the trophy, as
their class is too high above tne small-fry
craft for proper arrangements for fair con
tests.
At the next meeting, which will take
place in a few weeks, the organization will
be perfected and preparations for the re
gatta inaugurated.
Barton "Was Drowned.
The result of the autopsy by Dr. Barrett as
to the cause of the death of A. M. Barton, who

on Tenth street, was to the effect that the de

quest will be held. :."â¢
Upson Pleaded Guilty.
Joseph Upson, the lottery swindler, pleaded
