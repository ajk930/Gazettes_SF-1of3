will to men.
Mr. Reid referred to the Turkish and
other problems that had disquieted the
world and predicted that there would be a
great partition of territory or a great war
owing to the changing political conditions
on the three continents. Continuing, Mr.
Reid said:
"Kven our level-headed cousins in
America have caught the contagion of
universal unrest. 1 fear there are thous
ands of Americans who are willing to
plunge the whole Anglo-Saxon race into
what would be the most wanton and dis
astrous war of the century over a few
miles of fever- breeding jungle, where not
one sane citizen of the United States
would send a dog. I cannot believe that
such a stupendous crime is possible. The
hearts of the race are too full of kindred
blood.''
Referring to the question of federation
Mr. Koi'l said there was a united Britain
and a united Canada, and he trusted that
they would soon add a united Australia.
The Australian nation might soon baVQ to
stand shoulder to shoulder if it were to
stand at all. He hoped that an enduring
federation would be achieved calmly and
voluntarily, but he could not ignore the
fact that if the colonies did not come to
gether willingly they might soon be drawn
together by the sheer force of events.

j Harsh Tactics Adopted in Denting With

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, (via Key West,
FiiA.), Dec, 31.â Great alarm prevails here
on account of the latest measure taken by
Lieutenant-General Pando. The towns
and villages of Palma Seriano, San Luis
Dos Canunos, iron^o, Cristo, Dos Bocas
and San Vicente, all on the American rail
road line, have ail been left inhabited by
women, children and a few Spaniards. All
the Cuban men of the places have been
arrested and lodged in the jail of this city.
The steamer Baldomero Yglesias sailing
from this port this morning for Africa took
many prominent persons from this city,
i Guantanamo and other towns to hard labor
i in Ceuta. About fifty men were brought
i here this morning from Cristo accused by
the priest of that place of getting ready to
rise, kill the garrison und poison the water
and bread. Everybody thinks it i 3 an
infamous calumny.
On the loth instant, Tamal, the only
village I hat escaped the tire in theÃaracoa
district, was taken and burned by Leader
Ruen and his party. At the beginning of
the attack the Spanish colonel, Tarnora,
with 500 men appeared with the object of
defending the place and its forts. The
tight lasted two hours, after which time
the Spaniards retreated to Baracoa, los
ing nineteen soldiers killed, and fifty
wounded. The rebels had three killed and
eleven wounded, and captured from the
troops 20,000 cartridges and thirty guns
that wore in the fortresses. More than
100 men, useful for the war, joined Ruen's
party, forty of them volunteers, with arms
and ammunition.
The coiumn oi General Canollas had so
many wounded in the battle of Ramon
de Las Saguaa on the L2th instant that,
owing to the difficulty of carrying them.on
the 17th they had not reached Guanta

Spaniards.

CRTPPLE CREEK, Colo., Dec M.-A
shooting affray to-night in the Union
Theater in the little mining camp of Vic
tor, a fow miles out, threw thiÂ« j tee into
great excitement. Early in the evening
the toughs of the town gave it out that
they would clean out the Union, and when
Manager Smith of t:.e theater accused Tom
Pascoe, one of the audience, of being tlie
leader, a pitched battle was precipitated.
The killed: (ieorjre Smith, manager of
the theater; Tom Pascoe.
The wounded are: George Ferguson, will
die; "Shorty" Johnson, bartriuttr. shut .
in leg, and ex-Deputy Marshal William
Mathen-.y, shot in chest; will recover.
Several others received flesh wounds.
Victor has always borne an excellent
reputation as a raining camp, free from
saloon brawls and shooting affray-. Ba
loons and dance halls have been running
night and day ever since the camp was
started, and to-night's affair is the first se
rious trouble the town baa had. Ihe va
riety at the Union was progressing as
usual and the programme was about half
finished when Manager Smith came in
from his orlice and walked to a table at
which were seated five or six men.
One of them was Tom Fascoe, a well
known man about the camp. Smith ac
cused him of being the leader of a gang of
toughs which were scattered about the
theater and "told him he had heard the
toughs had come to clean out the place.
The lie was passed instantly and in i
jiffy a dczcn pistols were flashing in tiff*
â¢pasiiglii. -Before anyone could interfere
Pascoe had brought hit, pistol to a level
with Smith's head and baa let its contents
go. Smith dropped on bis knee and as he
fell he was seen to draw his gun.
A report rang out and 1-as.coe reeled and
fell almost directly across Smith. The
shooting then became general and when
the smoke had cleared away the extent of
the damage was known. Nearly every
light in the place had been shot out and it
was some time before sufficient lamps
could be obtained to allow the Marshal to
see who had been killed.
It is remarkable that but two were
killed, as bullet marks are everywhere.
Some of the wounded left the place for
their camps without saying who they
were, and a full list of the injured cannot
be obtained.
All the men were more or less drunk.
Smith and Ferguson were old-time ene
mies, and this fact is given as tiie caus*'^
for the trouble. Twenty-three shots we
exchanged.
The town is all exciteiyrht over tm
shooting to-night, and further bloodshed
is not improbable. Se<v>n4 street is being
paraded by men armed with Winchesters.

NEW TO-DAY.
One reason why women are so gener-
ally troubled with some derangement of
the distinctly feminine organism is that as
girls they learn nothing about their own
physical makeup. Parents are waking up
to the importance of education of this kind,
and young women are becoming more and
more able to take care of their health.
Carelessness in girlhood causes the great-
est suffering and unhappiness in after life.
Little irregularities and weaknesses in girls
should be looked after promptly and treat-
ment given at once. Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription promotes regularity of all km-
inine functions, makes strength and builds
op a sturdy health with which to meet the
trials to come. The "Favorite Prescrip-
tion" is not a universal panacea. It is
good' for but one thing. It is directed
solely at one set of organs.
"I have been a sufferer from 'female weak-
ness" for six years. I grew worse; had severe
cutting pains in left ovary, also in left side and
stomach. The pair, to left side was constant. I
would have lignt spasms previous to monthly
period and when the spasm would leave I would
suffer from severe soreness all over and could
'bear, nothing to touch me. 1 also suffered from
â¢everc headaches; burning pressure on brain
which almost caused me to be insane. I could
not lay my head down without smothering. My
face was poor; eyes looked dead; wasted in flesh.
I was constipated and suffered severe pain when
bowels would act. I could not cat for the full-
ness in region of stomach. I had tried three of
the best doctors here but they only gave me tem-
porary relief. I had given up all hope of ever
getting well again. At last I concluded to give
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription a trial. I have
taken two bottles, one of the 'Golden Medical
Discovery ' and one of ' Pellets.' I have not felt
any signs of ray old disease; headache all gone;
menses regular without ache cr pain. Indeed i
feel like a new person." Yours truly.

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 31.â The re
port that the bond syndicate contract with
the Government for "the sale of $100,000,000
naw 4 per cent bonds had been signed is
premature, so say leading bankers. The
subscriptions for the new loan, according
to banking officials, foot up anywhere from
$100,000,000 to $155,000,000. Report has it
that J. P. Morgan has secured $25,000,000
of this amount and James Stillman of the
City Bank an equal amount. The Deutsche
Bans of Berlin is credited with being
ready to take another $25,000,000. A rumor
was current that Russell Sage was person
ally interested in the syndicate to the ex
tent of $10,000,000, but this was subse
quently denied.
STRIKERS NOT SATISFIED
Disappointing Terms Made by
the Union Traction Com
pany.
An Appeal for Assistance Sent to the
Leading Societies of Phila
delphia.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. 31.â When
tin- street railway strike was declared off a
week aeo and the strikers returned to work
it was the understanding that they were to
have a hearing from the Union Traction
Company officials, at which hearing the
grievances of the men could be presented.
This hearing was given last night, a com
mittee of the employes having a confer
ence witn General Manager Beetem which
lasted several hours. The result of the
I conference was disappointing to the men,
I particularly the refusal of the general
j manager to grant them $2 for a ten-hour
workday.
Mr. Beetem consented to give the men
who struck their old runs and to pnt the
non-union men on as extras. The propo
sitions of Mr. Beetem will be submitted to
a meeting of the strikers for action.
Meanwhile the strike leaders anticipate
considerable opposition from the men to
these propositions, and this afternoon the
executive committee of the strikers met
and drew up an address to the Christian
League, Tonbee Society, Universal Peace
Union, Woman's Health Protective Ass'o
j ciation, Woman's Union in the Interest of
Labor, Single Tax Society, Wesleyan
Brotherhood, Young Men's Congress and
Mrs. liora Worthington Bellows. The ad
j dress is as follows :
"Acting upon the advice of yours and
many other leading societies in Philadel
phia in bringing to a close the strike which
wae inaugurated to bring a 1" 'it our just
demands, being assured that- if we would
peaceably return to work that they would
assist us in every way in their power to
secure our demands, which they felt were
just and right, we now appeal at this time
for your assistance, a? we have been mak
ing every effort in our power to secure
these demands, but so far have been un
successful. Our men have become rentless
and impatient. We fear the worst and
would kindly ask you to lend us your as
sistance and aid in bringing about a just
and amicable adjustment of these ques
tions."

"Open House" .AÂ© Longer a yew-Tear
Day Feature.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 31. - An
effulgent evening, giving promise of a
brilliant New Year's day to-morrow, ushers
in the opening- nf festivities and official
ceremonies of 18:*;. New-Year receptions
in their old conventional sense have been
gradually fading in Washington, and
the tradition of "open house" in its old
meaning is waning fast. The receptions
of citizens outside of official circles to
morrow will be confined almost entirely to
intimate friends.
The official ceremonies will be ushered
in with the President's reception at 11
o'clock in the forenoon, when, fallowing
the greetings from the Vice-President, the
Cabinet officers and the members of the I
diplomatic corps, army and navy officers
and other distinguished retinue and citi
zens generally, the President's reception
at 2 p. m. will end. The President will,
following the precedent of years, be as
sisted in welcoming his callers by Mrs.
Cleveland and the ladies of the Cabinet.
Merging into the time of White House
ceremonies will come, as soon as the offi
cial callers have reached their homes, the
reception of foreign Ministers, Cabinet
officers and others prominent in official
station. These, with many citizens, will
be at home at certain hours to accept and:
respond to the felicitous salutations of the.
New Year's greeting from many friends.

LONDON, Eng., Dec. 31.â The Times to
morrow will say:
The New Year opens with mingled
omens. At home the auguries are in
every way favorable. The outlook of ex
ternal politics is most serious, even alarm
ing. The revival of the war spirit in the
Tnited States, or what stimulates it, and
the prolonging of the uncertain position
in the East are almost equally disquieting.
The long-impending crisis in South
Africa has become acute. We are bound,
therefore, to be prepared for the contin
gencies which may call for a vigorous ex
ertion of power, that last report that must
be relied upon to hold the British empire
together. Happily it is certain that the
nation is fully capable of meeting the
probable demands or. its resources.

THK SA\ li-ANCISCO CALL, V.EDNESDAY, JANUARY 1, 1896.
PAGUE IS DISMISSED
Approval by the President
of the Lieutenant's
Sentence.
PUT OUT OF THE ARMY.
Failure of the Attempt to Justify
the Shooting of Colonel
Crofton.
GUILTY OF ALL THE CHARGES.
Convicted of Drunkenness on Duty and
an Assault to Kill a Su
perior Officer.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 31.âLieu
tenant Samuel S. Pague of the Fifteenth
Infantry Regiment was to-day dismissed
from the United States army in accordance
with the findings of a court-martial. The
charge on which Lieutenant Pague was
tried was based on an attempt made by
him on the life of the commanding officer
of his regiment, Colonel Crofton, at Fort
Sheridan, near Chicago, where the Fif
teenth Infantry is stationed.
The verdict of the court-martial was
"guilty," and yesterday afternoon Presi
dent Cleveland approved this finding. The
attempt made by Lieutenant Pague to kill
Colonel Crofton was sensational. At the
time of the happening last summer, it
was stated at Fort Sheridan that tin; lieu
tenant had rushed upon Colonel Crofton
while the latter was commanding the regi
ment on dress parade, and fired at him
with a revolver.
At the trial, however, it was shown that
the attempt was made in the apartments
of Lieutenant Pague, where Colonel Crof
ton was making a call on Mrs. Pague.
Lieutenant Pague tried to shoot the colonel
but was disarmed. He managed to fire a
shot, however, when Crofton had left his
quarters, and the bullet passed through
the colonel's coat. S
In his own defense Lieutenant Pague
claimed that Colonel Crofton's attentions
to Mrs. Pague had not been proper. After
the conclusion of the trial*a medical
examination of Lieutenant Pague, to de
termine his sanity, was held, but the re
sult indicated only that the lieutenant
was addicted to the use of intoxicating
liquors.
There is much sincere sorrow felt for
Lieutenant Pague among army officers,
who describe him as frank, manly and
courageous. He was born in Ohio, and was
appointed to the military academy from
that State. He was graduated in 1876.
The general order dismissing Lieutenant
Pague from the service was promulgated
this afternoon, and takes effect immedi
ately. It shows that he was found guilty
of every charge and specitication pre
ferred. The charges were drunkenness on
duty, attempt to kill a superior officer, and
assault with intent to murder.
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY
CJose of the Successful Exposi
tion of the Cotton
States.
During the Last Day at Atlanta All
Ceremony Was Dispensed
With.
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 31.â The final day
of the exposition opened with a clear j-ky.
During the early morning the temperature
was very low, but as the sun rose it
moderated rapidly and the cars to the ex
position were well filled.
The grounds were thronged with people
and the buildings were full. Many of the
exhibitors had a small harvest in the sale
of souvenirs, while the Chinese village
auctioned off its bric-a-brac. The exhibits
were all in good shape and were not dis
turbed until after dark.
During the afternoon camels and don
keys of Cairo street were driven out, but
most of the places on the Midway were
wide open and doing a good business.
Altogether the crowd was one of the
largest during December. There was no
ceremonial. There had been so much of
ceremony heretofore that it was determined
to let the last day be a free and easy affair
so that the visitors might make the best of
their time seeing tire exhibits.
This evening, as dark came on, the beau
tiful illumination was eiven and the elec
tric fountain for the last time displayed its
charms. Although there was a large
crowd the best of order prevailed and
everybody seemed to be in a good humor.
The directors held a meeting at 4 oxlock
and transacted some business of import
ance, mainly directed to fire and police
protection for the buildings.
To-night, at 6 p. m., a force of experts
began packing up the pictures in the art
gallery, and at the same time a similar
work was begun on the Government ex
hibits in the Mines and Forestry building.
It is expected that the work of packing
and shipping exhibits in the Government
building will proceed rapidly. In the
Manufacturers' building the foreign ex
hibitors will attempt to dispose of their
wares as far as possible before packine up.
Mr. Inman, chairman of the finance
committee, said the exposition, when all
the debts are paid, will have cost Atlanta
about $200,000, or less than 10 per cent of
the money expended on the fair. This in
cludes the original stock subscription and
the appropriation by the city. This i s re
garded as very satisfactory. It is esti
mated that the immediate benefit to
Atlanta in money expended here by expo
sition visitors amounts to $5,000,000 and
that the ultimate benefits to the city and
the cotton States are immeasurably beyond
this or any other conservative figure that
could be made.
SQUABBLE OVER A DEATH MASK'
Sculptor Trentatiove and Collector But
ton Cannot Agree.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. 31.â There is
a heated controversy going on between
Laurence Hutton of New York and Signor
Trentanove, an Italian sculptor of Â°this
city. It is on account of the death mask
of Eugene Field, the dead poet. Trenta
nove secured a death mask of the poet
and Hutton, who is a collector of death
masks, wrote to the sculptor to see if he
could get a duplicate of it. In reply he re
ceived a letter saying that no copie
would be made, but that the mask itself
was for sale for the sum of $1000.
In the January number of the Bookman
appeared what purported to be a copy of a
scathing reply by Hutton. Trentanove
denies t At he received any such letter,
and publishes the correspondence. In the
letters ti.ere is nothing in line with the
letter in the Bookman, Elutton merely
writing that he cannot pay the price
asked.
DESERTED WIFE ASD CHILDREN.
Rev. JUr. Dillon Left His Family in a
Destitute Condition.
EMPORIA, Kasb., Dec. 31.â The Rev. J.
B. Dillon, who has been missing for some
time, was heard from to-day. A letter
from him mailed on the cars near La Jun
ta, Colo., was received by his wife in which
he informs her that he is never coming
bacic. He left her and two children, one
of them a deaf mute, in destitute circum
stances. In fact, when their condition
was discovered the family were on the
verge of starvation, but they were soon
placed in comfort.
Dillon is an evangelist of considerable
celebrity in the Christian or Campbellite
church and is known throughout the
Union. He obtained some notoriety in
California, and for a time was suspended
from the ministry, but was reinstated pre
vious to coming to Kansas. The church
people here are much agitated over the
matter and are desirous that the facts be
made known to the public.
THE IXVESTHi ATIOX CLOSED.
Enough Testimony Received to Refute
Jfunraven's Charge*.
NEW YORK, X. V., Dec. 31.â The spe
cial committee of the New York Yacht
Club, sitting as a court of inquiry into the
charges made by Lord Dunraven against
the people in charge of the Defender, con
cluded its labor of taking testimony in the
case to-day.
The hearing opened with the examina
tion of the riggers who did not testify yes
terday. Mr. Askwith exhausted his skill
as a cross-examiner in his efforts to tangle
the sturdy workmen, but without avail,
and their evidence went on the record un
shaken, as has been the case with all the
Defender testimony.
The committee finished the investigation
at 11:25, when Mr. Choate and Mr. Ask
with, opposing counsel, then left the clnb.
EXTENDING THE LINES
Enterprise of the Missouri, Kan
sas and Texas Trust
Company.
Race of the Road to Get Into Kansas
City Ahead of Its
Rivals.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 31.â The
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Trust Com
pany of this city has practically gained
control of the Omaha and St. Louis Rail
road, which extends from Pattensburg,
Mo., to Omaha, Nebr., a distance of 145
miles. The road will be made a part of
the Kansas City Northern connecting
railway system, one of the Missouri,
Kansas and Texas enterprises. Its ac
quirement assures Kansas City new con
nections with Qoincy, Omaha, I)es Moinei
and other Northern citie?, and is one of
the last moves neces?ary to bring the
Baltimore ann Oh'< - . iv<? Illinois Central
and the Chicago Northwestern to th's
city.
The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Com
pany has pushed ahead zealously since it
started to extend its railway enterprises
north of Kansas City, and expects to have
trains running into its grand central depot
before the Kansas City and Atlantic Rail
way, the rival enterprise, completes its
brid.e across the river.
The Kansas City Northern connecting
company will either use the Milwaukee
bridge or build another one close to it.
The Omaha and St. Louis road will be
sold on January 27. and will be imme
diately boucht in by the Missouri, Kansas
and Texas Company. Contracts will be
made at once, and twenty-seven miles of
track laid between Pattensburg and
Trenton, Mo. The Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Trust Company has already ac
quired the Quincy, Omaha and Kansa3
City, which extends from Quincy, 111., to
Omaha, a distance of 136 miles, and will
control the Dcs Moines and Kansas City
line, which runs from Dea Moines to
Cainesville, Mo. They are the important
links in the company's northern chain of
railways, and they will be connected as
quickly as time and money will permit.
The purchase of the Omaha and St. Louis
will ultimately give Kansas City a short
and fast line East.

Queen.
TENNYSON'S SUCCESSOE.
For Over Three Years the Office
and Title Had Been
Vacant.
OTHER TITLES CONFERRED.
Sir Frederick Leighton and Henry
Hucks Gibbs Elevated to the.
Peerage.
LONDON", 'Em, Dec. 31.â 1n accordance
with the usual custom of conferring hon
ors on the occasion of the New Year, the
Queen has elevated to the peerage Sir
Frederick Leighton, president of the
Royal Academy, and Henry Kucks Gibbs,
formerly a member of the House of Com
mons and later a director of the Bank of
Eneland, and has knighted the Hon. H.
P. P. Crease, Senior Puisne Judge of Brit
ish Columbia. Henry 11. Gibbs has been
a large donor to the purse of the Conserva
tive party.
Her Majesty also appointed Alfred Aus
tin poet laureate, an office which has been
vacant since the death of Lord Tennyson
on October 6, 1892.
Alfred Austin, the new poet laureate, is
a poet, critic and journalist. He was born
at Headingley, near Leeds, May 30, 1835.
His father was a merchant and magistrate
of the Borough of Leeds, and his mother
was the sister of Joseph Locke, the emi
nent civil engineer and member of Parlia
ment for the Borouuh of Honiton, of
which he was lord of the manor. Both his
parents being Roman Catholics, he was
sent to Stonyhurst College and afterward
to St. Mary's College, Oscott. From
Oscott he took his degree at the University
of London. In 1853 and in 1857 he was
called to the bar of the Inner Temple.
But the publication, although anonymous
ly, of a poem entitled "Randolph," when
he was 18 years of age, showed the bent of
his disposition, and it may be stated, on
the authority of Mr. Austin himself, that
be ostensibly embraced the study of law
only in deference to the wishes of his
parents, and from his earliest years was
imbued with the desire and determination
to devote his life mainly to literature.
The expression of this resolve is found
in a novel written and published while he
was yet a minor. On the death of his
father, in 1861, he quitted the Northeast
Circuit and went to Italy. His first ac
knowledged volume of verse, "The Sea
son, a Satire," appeared in 1861. A third
and revised edition of "The Season" ap
peared in 1809. His other poetical produc
tions are: "The Human Tragedy," 1862,
republishea in an amended form in 1876,
and again finally revised in 1889; "The
Guldeii Age, a oati.e,'" ion; â¢â¢Interludes,"
1872; "Rome's Death," 1873; "Madonna's
Child," m 1873 ; "The Tower of Babel, a
Drama," in 1874; "Leszke, the Bastard, a
Tale of Polish Grief," 1877; "Savonarola, a
Tragedy," 1681; "Soliloquies in Song,"
"At the Gate of the Convent," "Love's
Widowhood, and Other Poems," "Prince
Lucifer" and "English Lyrics," all pub
lished between 1881 and 1890.
He has published three novelsâ "Five
Years of It," 1858; "An Artist's Proof,"
18t>4, and "Won by a Head," 1866; also
"The Poetry of the Period," reprinted
from Temple Bar, 1870, and "A Vindication
of Lord Byron," 1869, occasioned by Mrs.
Stowe's article, "The True Story of Lord
Byron's Life."
He has written much for the London
Standard and for the Quarterly Review.
During the sittings of the .Ecumenical
Council of the Vatican he represented the
Standard at Rome, and he was a special
correspondent of that journal at the head
quarters of the King of Prussia in the
Franco-German war.

stock Drict; is increased /ruin $100 to*? 150 a
share. The mortgage provision of the
other measure lias been eliminated.-also
the provision guaranteeing the bonds of
, the Maritime Company, providing instead
for the issuance of Government bonds suffi
cient in amount to construct the canal. This
action was taken in consequence of the de
cision in the Stanford .case, under which
tuc part taken by the Government in 'build
in u r the canal would only be a venture, so
that if the enterprise is a failure the mort
gage would he of no avail. If it is success
ful, ti^ei Government,, under the present
bill, will receive back its money and not be
left to the doubtful proceeding of fore
closure, which, under the concessions

- CHICAGO, 111,, Dec. : 31.â A morning
paper says:. Chicago gamblers are weary :
and disgusted.: They are turning their eyes,
longingly toward the gold lields and min- .
ing ;camps of Colorado and the West.
Witjiin the week twenty-five or thirty of
the 5 cleverest men in. the business, men
. better known in Chicago than elsewhere,
will; go to Cripple Creek v Co!o. They are
.{joii^g with John Condon and "Sam Dahl,

opened. ' . â¢ ' â â¢; â¢" â¢ : " ' ;' " â¢â¢.
Three weeks ago I)ahl left Chicago for a
visit to his ranch in Southern Colorado.:
While in that State he determined to. look
upon' Cripple Creek and its wonder.-.
After a sojourn thereof one week, during
â¢which he .had .ample opportunity to in
vestigate the free and open _ gambling go
ing on, he saw what he believed an oppor
tunity to get some of the "easy money."
Returning, to Chicago last Saturday;
Dahl at once consulted John Condon, and
the decision was to open a bisr faro bank
and gambling- house with all "games at
Cripple Creek. Forty-eight hourd elapsed
before Clark street knew of the proposi
tion in a general way. Word' was sent out
to old friends of Condon. and Dahl and the
selection of twenty suitable men was
commenced. .

. ' Captain After Parting From

. SEATTLE; Wash.. Dec. 31.â Proof of tfte
safety of the Canadian Pacific Company's
Australian liner Miowera is accumulating.
Valuable information was cabled this after
noon from this city to the steamship offi
cials, having been obtained to-day from
I Captain Pillsbury of ttie steamship Mine
tola. . The captain has a chart which he
procured from the master of the schooner
George W. Watson showing the relative
.positions of the vessels when, as claimed,
I the Watson signted the Miowera at 10
j o'clock in the morning on December 23.
j At that time trie Watson's position was
| southeast (magnetic) thirty-seven miles
j from Tatoosh, which gives Destruction
| Island bearing east three-eighths north
I (magnetic) twenty miles, the Miowera being
; then three or four miles to the northeast,
Mind, as supposed,, searching for her lost
tow: â â¢ . .;â 'â¢â â¢' 'â â¢:
. As the Stratnnevis did not anchor until
2 o'clock in the morning of the 24th, and
had been drivintr broadside at the rate of
four miles an hour, she must have
been out of sight of the Miowera at
the time. The relative positions of the
vessels place the Miowera nearer land
than the Strathnevis, and t<-ivl to show
j. that thc.foriier w-i-s searching for the dis
â¢ abled ship.
. This news, and the sighting of what
I certainly must have been the Miowera by
! the schooner Compeer later in the day on
'â 23d, southeast of Cape Flattery, proves
that the Miowera is safe almost beyond
i question. â¢

She Learned When Too Late That She
Had Married ajoliet Ex-
Convict.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 31.â Mrs. Frances
S. Bourne of San Francisco is in this city
in search of her husband, who deserted
her two months ago. She arrived here
last Sunday, in answer to a letter from a
private detective, who desired her pres
ence here to drive the fugitive from his
lair. After Bourne fled from San Fran
cisco, Mrs. Bourne placed her affairs in
the hands of a detective, who communi
cated with a professional brother in this
city, whither Bourne is supposed to have
come.
Mr?. Bourne is not so anxious to regain
possession of her recreant lord as she is to
compel him to disgorge $12,000, of which,
she claims, he robbed her just prior to his
flight. The stolen property is alleged to
consist of an absolute deed to $HOOO worth
of improved property in San Diego, an in
dorsed certificate of deposit in the Bank of
California for $3500 issued in her name,
and $2500 in ready cash.
Mrs. Bourne, whose maiden name was
Lillas, first met Bourne in Santa Cruz,
Cal., in the summer of 1894, where she was
visiting with several Eastern friends.
Bourne, who is almost seven years her
senior, represented himself as belonging
to a prominent family in Carrullton, Md,
He had a quite distinguished air and man
ner. He and Miss Lillas were married
just one year ago to-day in San Rafael,
Cal.
Bourne turned out to be a fortune
hunter, and a few months later she discov
ered that he had deceived her as to his
family and himself. He represented to
the confiding wife that he had an opportu
nity to engage in a business enterprise
that would yield enormous profits. All he
wanted was $10,000. Mrs. Bourne, ignor
ing her husband's first deception, became
a pliant victim to his rascality. Without
investigating the status of the new .busi
ness venture, the confiding wife transferred
San Diego property and a certificate for
$3500 to Bourne. Two days later she re
ceived $2,500 on account of her share in an
estate, which Bourne also, succeeded in
wheedling out of her for the same "busi
ness" enterprise. The following week he'
stf\tpd that he wonld have to viÂ«. ,â¢
sound on business connected wiiu his yen '
ture, promising to return in ten days. But
Bourne never came back.
Mrs. Bourne has discovered that
Bourne's right name is Howard Calligan,
and that he is an expert forger, who had
been released from ttie Joliet prison only
six months before she met him. The wife
is determined to return him to prison.
Bourne is believed to be in biding j
where in this city and die detectives are
confident he cannot elude them.

; . [From a photograph.] â¢â â:..
"\Vingfield denounced the Rev. Mr. Pierce,
all protest that the Bishop did call the
aged pastor an unmitigated liar. Even
ttibse of the vestrymen friendly to Bishop
Wingfield will not corroborate his state
ment to the contrary. . In fact, the con
sensus of opinion among the local congre
gation is that if the Bishop's statement in
the article printed in Tin: Call relative
to the occurrence in the Masonic Temple
stands as his version of the proceedings in
the church last Sunday, there can be littie
doubt as to the superiority of Mr. Pierces
veracity. That is the sentiment of JMacer
vHle, and Piacerville, orthodox or infidel,
is defending a Christian old man who has
won the love of capitalist and horny-,
handed miner by a life filled with philan
thropic acts. ': . .' â  . . '
At the meeting of the Bishop with the.
vestry the prelate apologized for the lan
guage used In the morning, and said he ..
did wrong. H& disclaimed any further
intent to remove Mr. Pierce, saying that
whoever might; succeed him the church
would, become. :t he habitation of' owls.

the Bishop, as the congregation expected
them to do. . â  â  â  â '.::â â :â

the whole community. The charitable I
hint of the Bishop as to the pastor's men
tal condition met with a bland smile. and a
shrug of the. .shoulder from the aged
clergyman, who charitably refrained from
any comment upon the subject. But, on
all sides, Bishot> Wingtield's statement in

the situation had been misrepresented,
evokes increased indignation.
BELIEVES I'IEJtCE INSANE.'"'-
JSia/iop Ifinff field Again Denounces the
l'astor'B Affidavit.
BENICIA, Cal., Dec. 31.â Bishop "VVing
field's answer to the published statements
from Placerviile concerning his misunder
standing with the Rev. Mr. Pierce of that
town is vigorous and denunciatory. To
day ho consented to another interview for
The Call, in which he said :
"I have known Mr. Pierce for some
twenty years and have never in all that
time had any trouble with him whatever.
This trouble has arisen in the distempered
brain of a man who has given his whole
life to a people who think everything of
him. He has bought their affections' by
spending all his money upon them. In
fact, some years ago he told me that he
had then spent thousands of dollars buy
ing tracts and books and distributing them
around the country, and such actions will
make any man worshipped by his people.
"Regarding the affidavit I can say only
that it reaffirms what he has already said,
and which is absolutely false in every par
ticular that pertains to what occurred in
the Masonic Temple. To prove this it is
only necessary to say that on the day I was
with him and after the visit to the temple
or hall Mr. Pierce took luncheon with me
and in the rao^t friendly manner after
ward we spent the time in the hotel parlor
until 11 o'clock that night in conversation,
and not one word of a disagreeable nature
was uttered. The affidavit itself bears on '
the face of it its own condemnation, for if j
I had treated him In the manner he says I I
did he certainly would not have acted j
toward me in the friendiy manner which
he did afterward.
â¢No person is in the habit of using the
expressions he says I used, and at the
same time committing an assault, and any
person that knows me knows that under
no circumstances will I so far forget my
own dignity as to act in such a familiar
way With any one. I have correspondence,
which I can produce, that leads me to
thinkâ and so I hive thought for some
time â that Mr. Pierce is not realiy in his
right mind, but whether he is or not, 1
positively affirm that I never beat or as
saulted him in any way. I simply laid
my hand on his arm, saying: 'Dear
brother, this is all very nice, but this don't
bring any men to the church.'.
".Regarding my opinion of the Masons,
which 1 see has been mentioned in the
paper, I will say that while I am not a
member of any secret order, my father
was a Knight Templar, and I have nothing
against tne association whatever. I have
devoted my whole mind to the church and
have no time for anything else."

BUTTE COUNTY'S FRUITS
Seventy-Five Carloads of Oranges
Will Be Shipped This
Season.
New Orchards Coming Into Bearing
Supply Work for the
'â â¢â¢â¢! Unemployed.
CHICO, C.v., Dec. 31:â Over 9000 boxes
of oranges have been shipped from Oro
viile this season and 7000 from Palermo.
It is estimated, that about .f>ooo more will
be shipped from birth places. by the Ist of
January. The demand is far in excess of
the supply, as the quality of the fruir is
very line. $an Francisco, takes a great
many consignments, and heavy shipments
go to Portland and other cities up- north.
This is equivalent to" nearly fifty-rive car
â is, and the indications are that not less
. t seventy-five carloads will be the total
season's shipments.
When it is considered that the orange
groves of this county are but. just coming
into bearing, it can be realised what an
important industry it will become in a few
years. "When the trees now on the gronnd
are in bearing there will be a product of
not less than 1500 carloads yearly and
probably more.
Oranges have brought the growers this
year high prices, and there is every indi
cation that this rate will be maintained for
several yeara to come. The fruit is all
grown, too, on lands that ten years ago
were given up to pasturage and thfl roving
coyote. The enterprise and perseverance
of a few men have made possible an in
dustry of lasting ami continual benefit.
Ihe olive industry in this county is also
one of great importance now, and of
which but comparatively few people have
any idea. The hundred's of acres in these
trees along the foothill belt are rapidly
coming into bearing, and thousands of
gallons of berries are being pickled and
thousands of gallons being ground for oil.
At the present writing the orange and
olive orchards give employment to many
people at a season of the year when labor
is not required in the extensive deciduous
orchard* in the valley. It may in truth be

BRITAIN'S EMBASSADOR.
J. W. Wurburton, the New Con
sul-General to San Francisco,
Is Here.
A TITLE CREATED FOR HIM.
He Was Formerly in Chile and Was for
Thirty-Seven Years in the London
Foreign Office.
Among tho arrivals at thÂ« California is
the Hon. J. W. Wurburton. the newly ap
pointed Consul-General from Great Britain
to San Francisco.
Consul-General Wurburton has come
from Chile, where for a year and a half he
was Consul-Genenil, and for the last nine
months Charge d'Affair^s at Valparaiso.
Prior to his goin.^ to Chile Mr. Wurburton
was for thirty-seven years in the Foreign
Office at London.
The oflice of Consul-General is new here,
the title of the British representative
hitherto being merely Consul. Lord Kim
bcrley. however, in whose department Mr.
Wurhurton served so long, had a high re
gard fur him because of special services,
and created the place for him. He will re
ceive a salary of Â£1200 a year.
The Consul-General is a medium-sized
gentleman of something over 50 years,
with hair and mustache tinged with gray.
His daughter, Miss Wurburton, accom
panies him, and will remain with him
here.
General Wurburton told a Cat.l repre
sentative yesterday that he came from
Chile via Colon and New York.
"1 am very glad to be here," he added.
"It is the first time I have ever visited any
of the States, and I am very sure from
what I have seen that I shall like it here.
I will take charge, of the office to-morrow,
retiring at once Vice-Consul Weilesley
Moore, who lias been acting since Mr. Don
pboe. : â :.â¢-â .,
"As to the oifice itself I cannot say any
thing till I take charge",, as I do not ex
actly, yet know the 'situation. .1 was
charmed with ..Valparaiso, but I think 1
shall like San Francisco fully as well. â¢.-â â 
;. "The whole of Chile : : js very prosperous
now.. Ever- since, the war ; it has made
steady advancement. Tiie last census- of
Valparaiso, I believe, showed a population
of. 115,000 people, tmt i made an estimate
when I was thure, which if I remember
rightly, showed an increase to 130,000.'. '.
.. "â¢i'here.is so muchprosperity throughout
the republic that .you hardly ever see a
beggar. .It is reailiy phenomenal. Then
the climate is all that could be desired.
The only slightly bad feature was .the
earthquakes." ;â¢â¢â¢-.
General Wurburton is an Irishman by
birth, coming of a very old family in
Kings County. His sister is the wife of
lION. J. Vf. WIRBIKTON, THE NKYVJ.Y APPOINTED IiRITISU CONSUL-GENERAL
AT SAN IKANCISCO.
[From a recent photograph.]
the Earl of Kingston. His uncle, Sir
Frederick Btoven, was nt the batt;e of New
Orleans. Sir Frederick had the title of
Grand Commander of the Bath, ana <;. <.'.
M. G. He was also for. many years Groom
in Waiting to the Queen.
Another General Stoven, uncle oF the
Consul-General^ mother, was in the Black
Hole of Calcutta. Barke'a "County
Families of England and Ireland," and
"Landed Gentry," t/ace Consul-General
Wurburton'a family as far back as the
time of the Norm an invasion.
His lather was the Dean of Elphin, in
Roscommon, Ireland. The Sir Frederick
Stovcn alluded to was asked by the Queen
to be governor to one of the princes, the
Duke of Edinburgh, when he went abroad.
The Consul-General's wife is not living.
Talking about his family, he said: 'I
have live daughters and one son. Four
of my daughters are married, one in
Ireland, two in England, and one the
other day in Valparaiso. My youngest
daughter is with me, and I hope will re
main.
The Consul-General received Â£900 a year
at Valparaiso, with Â£100 additional, at the
suggestion of Lord Kimberley for ex
ceptional services. The appointment to
San Francisco is in every way a promo
tion. The Consul-General is a very
pleasant, affable gentleman.
He had many callers yesterday, es
pecially among the British residents, who
came to pay their respects to him.

ST. JACOBS OIL..
After completing his studies in: a German
university, a young American named Charles
A. Vogeler returned to the United States, with
the intention of engaging in business. ll is
father was a wholesale druggist of Baltimore,
Mil. Full of enthusiasm, and having in mind
many similar tilings he had Investigated while
abroad, Mr. Vogeler conceived .the idea of in
troducing a line of German remedies in his
own country. About the year 1870 his plans

made his -firm exceedingly popular with news

The recipient of many favors from the pub

HOOD'S SARSA PARILLA.
Once upon a time (or more definitely about
sixteen years ago) an enterprising young man
was conducting a retail drugstore In the city
of Lowell, .\iii--.. . By a. careful attention to
detail he managed to "build up a very success
ful little bustnosV Bui hisambi extended
beyond, tin; . sphere of a simple drug com
pounder and local merchant. He finally hi <
upon the irle.i of putting up a sarsai.arilta and
naming It after himself: This he did, and de
termined from the outset to devote every cent
of hi< proOts. over and above his actual "needs
for living expenses, to pushing its sale among
the general public.
These were slow at first, but gathered in
creased ]â >!., as I hey proceeded; lie soon began
to branch out beyond 'his own city, and it was
not very long before he had covered 'lie State
of Massachusetts.^ Kromthis he began to reach
out into Xew England generally. Ho adver
tised to a limited extent In the newspapers,
issued a small folder, pamphlets, etc., mi id pros
pered. TakiniMhe profits from the territory

finally", the entire country was covered, ana
hi< sal" have long since reached enormous
proportions. ;
Mr. Hood's success has stimulated innumer
able rivals in his particular line, some of whom
have, in ii local way, interfered with his trade
In certain sections: but his sales are so enor
moun that he completely overshadows them.
Willard Everett and Georpe,Taylor have ma

WARNER'S SAFE CURE.
Seme twenty-live year-; ago a young ihmii
cami lo Rochester, N. V., and began selling
bank locks for St\rs"ant A: Greenleaf. He was |
qiiite succo*hful so much so that, in connec
tion with the snle of locks, he combined the
pale of B re- proof safes, v. iiie'i safes he secured
I rincipally from < Incinnati, Ohio. By unusual !
enterprise lie succeeded in securing a compe

the panic ol l^T^i occurred. Mis partners at
thnt time became apprehensive oi result-, us
the safe business was one ol the first to suffer
by rftason of the panic. He at once offered to I
buy cm t their Interests, which they were quite
willing to -ell. For the next two years he lost
money rapidly; but with unflinching courage
lie continued in the business, and kepi ins
traveling men constantly on the road. When
the tide ai last turned he reaped a rich harvest
of profit, being the only concern prepared to
meet the emergancy. The expenditure of his
energies in those few yeurs, however, had told
upon his health, and thedoctors warned him
that hi- life was in danger. Some one

exceedingly fertile in novel expedient* for at- >

SOZODONT.
Way back in war times Pr. Buskirk, a New i
York physician and j>hr.rmacisi, discovered a
preparation for cleansing the teeth which con
tained properties never before used in com- :
pounds employed for this purpose, lie named I
it "Bozodont." Notwithstanding the In
auspicious times in which it was introduced
Dr. Buskirk was impressed with the idea that :
there was a good future foÂ» his preparation.
He managed to get Hall & Ruckell, the well- !
known wholesale drngliouse, to place it on the
market. Some time nftcr the doctor sold out
bis interest to this loncern. Bozodont was ex
tensively advertised <!nring the war, but for i
some reason this policy was not continued
vigorously. About, sixteen years ago, however,
the firm commenced to advertise In 'a very
liberal manner, and with such good results
tns>i agencies were established In Europe,']
which developed a considerable export trade.
This linn hnÂ« a very thoroughly organized
advertising department and their matter is
always tasteful and well displayed.
BAKER'S COCOA.
Walter Baker & Co. were one of the first con
cerns in America to appreciate the value of ex
tpnsive ndvertisine and for many years their
announcements have appeared regularly in
the leading periodicals. Their trademark,
Belle Ohocolataire" (the copy of a celebrated
painting in the Dresden Gallery), is doubtless
familiar to the reader. '-
The cocoa and chocolate manufacturing es
tablishment of this firm at Dorchester, Mass.,
is not only the oldest, but the largestof its
kind on the continent One of their smaller
mills in which the business was first begun at
the same place in 1765, is said to have been
the first of its kind in the British Provinces of
North America. The plant then established
came into t lie possession of ]>r. .lames Baker in
1780, who was succeeded later bj Walter
Baker, his grandson, in whose name the busi
ness has since beea conducted. The com pony's
plant now comprises five large mills (having a
floor space of about 315,000 square teet;
equipped with all the latest and most im
proved machinery. Among the nnmerousspe
dal advertising plans employed by Baker*
Co. fire clhk ohite buffets at exhibitions, where
their beverage is served free of charge to visi
tors by pretty girls attired in the costume of
the damsel represented in the company's

AYKIt'S SABSAPARIXI.A.
Way back in the fifties a young, vigorous
STew Euglander, who had learned the profes
sion of an apothecary in all its details, con
ceived the idea, of putting up a line of â medici
nal preparations. They consisted of "Ayer's
Cherry Pecioral," "Ayer's Earsaparilla" and
Myers rills."
For feveral years J. C. Ayer acted as his
3 wn chemist, bottler and salesman, and car
ried Ids goods from house to house and from \
-ii.if to store. As "business increased this same
general plan amis closely adhered to, and even |
to-day the large bulk oi the business of ihis I
house is done by the aid <>! traveling men, who
call upon druggists ami general storekeepers
and place the goods on consignment. In late i
years this plan has been ably supplemented
by vigorous advertising in both local mid gen- i
â r.-.i publications. The preparations have been
introduced abroad, in South America; Aus
tralia and India, and are considered standard
remedies.
The laboratory of the JJ ('. Ayer Company at
Lowell; Slass., is complete In every detail of
cleanliness and labor-saving machinery. Bach '
medicine has its own special department and
lorn* of workers; and,. although compounded
ill such enormous "amities, the ingredients
hi each bottle are as accurately gauged as if ;
prepared singly.

CARTER'S LITTI.K LIVKR -II, LS.
Brent Good was born in Rochester, X. V.,
in 18i{7, -and wos taken by his parents to Can- â 
ada and reared on a farm located near the Bay j
of Quinte, out. Ills school life was followed !
by an apprenticeship to the drug business at
Belleville, Out. Toward the end of the year
1856 he made his way to New York and ob
tained a position with Dems. Barnes i\r Co.,
who were at that time the largest handlers of
proprietary medicines in the world. HiÃ dili
gence was soon rewarded by his employers and
he was placed on their traveling stall", and j
tiiLfilly, In IH>;{, he was taken into the firm. I
In lHt>!>, however, the partnership was dis- ;
solved by the selling of the stock and good i
will to John T. Henry & Co. and Mr. Good be
came a member of the firm of Good, Roof & Co.
for the purpose of importing wines. But he
still retained a predilection for his old business !
and in 1878 he purchased an interest in the
valuable pill made by Dr. Carter of Erie, Pa.,
who was at that, time doing a business of
810,000 a year with it. Mr. Good formed |
the Carter Medicine Company and became
its president, treasurer and general manager. i
For several years be confined his efforts to the I
United States and Canada, but in 1886 he
opened a laboratory in London and gave our
British cousins an example of Yankee enter
prise that they did not relish. The English
newspapers especially denounced his enor
mous colored posters, and as a sequence a bill
was introduced in Parliament to prevent all
such advertising display. But this action was
like a boomerang and hit two ways at once. It
advertised the pills so thoroughly that they at
once became popular. and are now considere 1
as standard. .Mr. Good possesses the rather
rare faculty of knowing a good thing when he
sees it. This is, evidenced not only by his
numerous fertile advertising ideas, but by Ins
successes, in other lines of business. . As an in
stance of this may be cited the Writing Tele
graph. Company, which he organized and
which sold out in ISO 2, paying, the. original
stockholders an enormous profit on their origi
nal investment. Mr. Good owns the Lyceum
Theater in New York and .is connected in
dive.rs' capacities with several large commer
cial enterprises. _______' â ,- : '' v .-^
C ASTORIA.
Among the men who have graduated with
high honors in the proprietary medicine busi
ness wo must surely- number. Charles^ H.
Fletcher, the president and general manager
of the Centaur Company, the manufacturers
of the world-renowned "Castoria." Mr. Fletcher
attained bia 5,,;-,,! knowledge under Denies
Barnes, whose name was as well known some
feu decades aeo as his modern followers are
to-day. Mr. liarnes was a man of great ability,
wonderful energy, and he had the happy
faculty of securing a class oi men who were
able to carry out his plans. Mr. Fletcher or
ganized the Centaur Company in 1870 and
put forward Centaur Liniment. Weideman's
Catarrh Cure and a number of otner prepara
tions. They cijuld â¢hardly be considered as
pronounced successes, and the company finally
concentrated all its energies on pushing Cas
toria. The work was done very thoroughly
and systematically, but it required a number
of years and the expenditure of a large amount
Of money to fully establish it upon the market.
Mr. Fletcher's interest iv and attention to the
business of the company is jusi as thorough as
before the goods became so popular. The re
porter of The CALL was particularly charmed
with the easy cordiality of the man and tlie
smoothly working office machinery under his
personal supervision. He is assisted in the ad
vertising department by J. <;. Ham.
The Centaur C unpany issue a Castoria alma
nac each year, and are reputed to spend in the
neighborhood of $300,00U per annum in ob
taining publicity. Of this a very large propor
tion is expended in daily newspapers.
I BOI'AL BAKING FOWDSB.
This preparation was put upon the market
by John C. Hoagland, the present president
and general manager of the company, some ;
thirty oad years ago. Mr. Hoagland was at i
that time proprietor of a retail drugstore at
Cleveland,; Ohio, and conceived the idea of
providing a convenient substitute for the old
ldohioned saleratus that our mothers were ac
customed to.
The Koyal Baking Powder Company is one i
of the most standard advertising concerns in
America, and out of the twenty odd thousand
publications in America to-day there are but
a comparatively small number that do not
carry its announcement. For a great many
years it made few if any changes in
the style of its advertisements, but of â 
late it has . branched out into a style
of display advertising, many of the de- â 
signs of which have been both original and
progressive. Its advertising bureau is finely
equipped ami systematically conducted, and
its dealings are exclusively conducted direct
with the publishers:
' During; the baking powder wars of the past
1 there have been many personalities and bitter [
| assertions on both -sides, but this seems to |
â  have all been forgotten and a state 01 armed !
; neutrality prevails.
The Koyal Baking Powder Company claims
to have made a strong tight against personal!
ties in advertising and to have Impressed upon !
the minds of publishers that one advertiser
should not be permitted to defame another
patron <.i the paper through its advertising
columns.
The advertising department Is conducted by '
j II A. I.a I it:n and K. P. Call and expends
. about a half million of dollar* annually. iThey
a so issue a very complete cookbook, which is â 
i distributed among housewives generally. The

| best-selling plasters upon the" market.
The Porous Master Company, as the concern
is now called, are very liberal newspaper ad

neighborhood of 9100,000 annually. This de

j Mr. Brandretu and is placed through the
agency of E. N. Erickson.
j (|,KVKI,AM) BAKING POWOSB.
This business whs originally established by
Messrs. Cleveland Bro*. in Albany, N. V., in
1870. In 1889 the o'd firm was succeeded by
a stock company, tncorpoiated under the laws
Of New York. with Dr. ('. N. Iloagianfl ns its
president. Froi i's very inception this con-
I eern has hren a consistent user of newspaper
| space and has been conducted on the broad-
I gauge lir.es of enterprise mid push. Of course,
they ha<! a thoroughly reliable Mrtiolc to com
me nee with, but it has been judicious advertis
ing alone that nas made ihc merits of the
powder bo witfely known, and bus thus caused
v general demand for it. The advertising de
partment is In charge of Mr. Keweomb'Cleve-
I land, who is held in hif{!> estimation by all the
j craft. Mr. Cleveland won the first prize in a
competition got up by Johnson it Johnson,
the proprietors of Wood's Penetrating Porous
I'inster, some few years ti^o. The desired object
was a clear, reliable plan, as well as copy, for
an aggressive advertising campaign.
Mr. Cleveland's contribution was wonder
fully complete in all its details and showed the
firm head of n master mind. He has also come
prominently forward in the question of type-
I display, but of course his practical work with
j his own company overshadows all these minor
attainments.
The advertising in newspapers and periodi
cals of the Cleveland Baking I'owder amounts
to considerably more than a hundred thousand
dollars annually, and another large appropria
tion is spent in poster and sig-n work. In ad
dition to this, circulars and samples are dis
j tribiHed, as well as the Cleveland Cook Book,
which has already reached its fifth million.
The company has an immense factory in
Brooklyn, N. V., whence their product is
shipped to all ports of the Union, Canada,
Europe and South America.
SCOTT'S EMULSION.
This business was started upon an extremely
conservative basis in 1870 and was only ad
vertised at first in publications reaching the
medical fraternity.
The first general advertising was done in the
Spanish papers of South America, Cuba and
Panama. This produced results so satisfactory
that the policy was extended to general pub
lications in the United States, Canada, Eu
rope, India iir.d Australia. There has probably
never been another concern who have com
menced in just this way, nnd ihe results re
corded speak volumes for South American ad
vertising, which many people ore too ready to
look upon (is an altogether unpromising (ield.
The houso hns laboratories in New York City,
lJplleville (Canada), London, Paris, Barcelona
and Milan.
Tlu-ir advertising is now in charge of Mr. A.
E. Rose, a gentleman whe has made fortune as
well as reputation in spreading the name and
fame of Hornby's Oats throughout the land.
His personality is plainly discernible in the
new style of matter and display that they are
now running, and it requires but slight trift of
prophecy to state that the Miles ol Scott's
Emulsion will not fall off under his manage
ment.
OK. J. H. SCHENCK & SON.
This house has been prominently before the
public as medicine advertisers lor a great
many years. Their preparations include Put
monic Syrup, Mandrake Pills, Seaweed Tonic,
etc.
It was the practice of the Poctor to visit cer
tain cities at regular intervals, and advertise
himself as located at some particular hotel
where consultation with the atllicted could be
carried on. In this way the sale of his prep
arations were promoted and a regular clientage
built up. A atriking feature of ibis firm's ad
vertising, aside from general newspaper work,
hfis been their wall display. In one Instance
they leased a!l the barns on the various farms
along the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad,
between Philadelphia and New York. These
barns are completely covered with brown and
while paint, giving the names of the various
preparations controlled by Dr. Schenck. It
ha" been called the most striking line of wall
work ever done in America.
PAIN KIXIJER.
Nearly half a century ago there lived at
Providence, K. L, a man who had become
afflicted with Inflammatory rheumatism. He
suffered intensely but patiently, and during
his sufferings succeeded in compounding a lin
iment which first relieved and then entirely
cured him. In deciding upon a name for his
preparation he became impressed with the
idea of its killing pain, anil from this small
beginning: came Perry ltavis' Pain Killer.
After his own recovery Mr. Davis became Im
pressed with its. real value and began going
about the country celling it at retail. He was
also a very religious man and arranged with
all missionaries who were going abroad to take
a supply of his Pain Killer with them. From
the introduction abroad that the missionaries
originally gave it Perry Davis' Pain Killer has
become one of the largest selling preparations
throughout the torrid zone. F.specially Ik this
true in cholera countries, where the "natives
call it "Hangala."
The business is still conducted by the heirs
of its original founder, all of whom are very
liberally endowed in this world's goods.
HKI.LS & KM 'HAKIISON COMPANY.
In iÂ«7J Messrs. Edward Wells, A. Rich
ardson and W. .1. Van Patten ontanized under
the style of Wells, Richardson & Co. to conduct
a wholesale drug business at Burlington, Vt.
In IHT'.i Henry Wells was admitted to partner;
ship, and in 1881 F. 11. Wells. The business
prospered, and the firm eventually supplied
i he State oi Vermont and adjacent counties in
New York and New Hampshire with nearly
their entire stock of drugs and. medicines. They
goon entered extensively into the manfaeturfl
of pharmaceutical preparations which gave the
fullest satisfaction to their large trade. The
success which their manufactures met with in
this limited territory stimulated a wish for
larger Holds.
In 1870" they placed their well-known butter
color upon the market ana expended about
$4000 in advertising it. The success whs al
most instantaneous. In 187H they purchased
Kidney Wort, a remedy possessing^ undoubted
merit, which was also liberally advertise and
thus achieved a large and widespread sale.
About this time they became Interested in
the manufacture of dyestufls, and the result
<>t their investigation and experiments in this
department of industry was the introduction
of a full line of dyes for domestic use under i he
name of "Diamond Dyes." These dye* gained
one of the most decided successes of anything
in the line of proprietary articles that have
been piaced upon the" market in the
last few years. Their fame spread quickly and
the suit's soon mounted up to thousands of
gross monthly. This was only accomplished
by extensive and judicious advertising, both
In newspapers as well as in other lines. Among
these was an issue of over G.000.0u0 Diamond
Dye almanac*.
In 1885 this company became interested in
the manufacture of sugar of milk and adopted
ii new process of preparing this commodity,
which finally resulted in the introduction of a
food for Infants and invalids of which the
pure American Milk Sugar was ihe basis. It is
now known as I.acittted Food; and has it large
and extensive sale.
Another specially that was geenred by the
company and which has for several years sus
tained ;i high reputation throughout ti:e coun
try, is Paine'- Celery Compound. Tins rem
edy, which owes its origin io the researcnex of
ProfeÃÂ«or Pl. dps oi Dartmouth College, bus
been largely advertised, and being possessed

SAI'OI.IO.
The bouse of Enoch Morgan's Sons Co., at i
439 West street. New York, has been promi- j
nent in the soap business for nearly a century.
The above well-known article is a silicate soup
for scouring purposes, and Is probaDlyont* of j
the most widely used articles of American
manufacture.
Its great success, has been to a considerable
extent achieved by tbe. versatility and unique
method* of the linn's advertising manager,
Mr. A ! tennis Ward. It WOUld take a lair
sired volume to chronicle the varied achieve
ments of Mr. Ward in the line of suc
cessful publicity. He has had cowboys cross
the prairie, small boats the ocean, nd has
lately announced that the planet Mars is in
contemplation. But in spur of all these more
or less sensational methods he Kives ample
proof of his faith in the all- pervading news
paper press.
This ti rm has agents in many foreign coun
tries, especially in England, where a large
trade has been developed. They spend In the
neighborhood of #400,000 yearly in advertis
ing and pushing Sapolio.
HI IKY's MALT WHISKEY.
The above is its popular title, although the
real name and trademark is Daffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey. It is the only medicinal whisky
advertised and sold extensively in America.
The margin upon whiskies is so small that ad
vertising, except upon extremely conservative
lines, is m racner dangerous expedient.
Duffy's, however, has been before the public
as an advertised medicinal whisky so long that
ii has a linn hold which can readily be held
Bg(\inst all competitors, The original com
pany, which was located in Baltimore, was un
successful lor various reasons. The present
company, however, is a permanent and un
doubted success. This is mainly due to judi
cious management and advertising. This is
mostly done in the newspapers, although the.
company has a small pamphlet which ii mails
to parties upon request.
Mr. W. 11. Gelsheneu. who owns the majority
of the stock of the company, personally con
trols and directs the business", and although he
is a man of affairs, with extensive interests in
other lines, he is conversant with all the de
tails of the institution. They spend some
where in the neighborhood of $100,000 annu
ally in the newspapers.
CUTICURA.
This name, which has become so familiar to i
the people of the country by reason of its con
stant repetition in divers periodicals, is used
by the Potter Drug and Chemical Company to
descrlDe their specialties. About a quarter of ,
a million dollars is expended annually in this i
way, and a small book treating of skin and
blood diseases is also issued for gratuitous Dis
tribution. â¢
George White, the manager, has shown ex
ceptional ability as a medicine advertising
man, and it is largely through his instrumen
tality that the concern has been so successful.
HORSFORD'S ACID PHOSPHATE.
This well-known preparation is one of several
put out by the Rumford Chemical Works of
Providence, R. I. The founder of this impor
tant industrial concern was Professor Eben
Horsford, who died in the early part of 1893.
He was born in Moscow, Livingston County,
N. V. . in 1818. He studied chemistry
under Liebig-at Giessin, Germany. When he
came back, he was appointed Rumford pro
fessor of applied sciences at Harvard Uni
versity. He remained at Harvard some six-
I teen years, and at a time when others would
have begun to settle comfortably in their pro-
I fessional seats he resigned his position.
While at Harvard he was constantly making
experiments and putting new ideas into prac
tical use. He secured no less than tnirty
patents; and more than half of these on com
pounds like his now well-known Acid Phos
phate.
After he left Harvard he engaged in chemi
i cal manufacturing that was based on his own
inventions and he became a very rich man.
He started the Rumford Chemical Works and
introduced a number of preparations to which
his name has been given.
ADVERTISING AGEXTS.
These are a most important feature in adver
tising economics, and may be crudely divided
into two classesâ the general and special
agents. The former are understood to repre
sent the advertisers, to he their brokers as it.
were, in buyine space and ideas for their r>n
trons.and in seeing that they get what they are
paying for. By a strange anomaly, they
r.^ually receive their pay in the form or a com
mission from the publisher. There are many.
however, who hold the view t hat this la merely
a discount for wholesale trading, and that the
agent is entitled to it by reason of the number
of customers he controls. However this may
be, the agent is an extreir, ely valuable acces
sory, and his ideas usually bring a rich flow of
dollars into his patron's coffers.
The special Rgent, on the other hand, repre
sents the publishers. He exerts his influence
wholly upon obtaining business for the paper
or papers i hat he may represent,. afid- fie il
recompensed by the publisher alone fo"r his .

(iKOKGK P. ROWSIL.
Mr. Rowell was born at Concord, Yt.. July 4,
18H8, but resided at Lancaster. N. H., until
1855. Ho graduated from the Lancaster Acad
emy witli the highest honors v.' his class. He * : ,
first commenced business in a Boston retail
store, but finally found a calling to his liking
in the business department of the Boston Tost.
Early in lSb7> he established the firm of
George P. Rowell & Co. at 23 Congress street,
and although without any considerable capital
he did an extremely good business: It is said
that one of the firm's first customers was
a concern that wanted to advertise in the
newspaper:) ol Nova Scotia. As there was no
list of any sue] publications at that time the
young firm was in somewhat of a quandary,
but accepted the order without any demur.
It. Immediately began to canvass among its
"Bluenose" acquaintances as to i!:Â«- papers
published in their respective neighborhoods,
and by carefully following up the information
so obtained it was enabled to place the order
in an extremely satisfactory manner.
la 18<>7 .Mr." Rowell moved to New York,
where he soon attained the prominence he has
ever since occupied in his particular line-
In 18<>1> lie commenced to issue the yearly
publication known as me "American News
paper Directory," which has been an invalu
able aid to every advertiser and "publisher of
the country. In 1888 be decided to publish a
weekly paper devoted to advertising called
Printer's Ink, and it has been most aptly
termed "the little schoolmaster in the art of
advertising." In 1892 Mr. Rowell conveyed^
jus agency business to a corporation styled the
George P. Rowell Company, the Mock of which
is largely owned by his former e.nployes. Ho
still retains the Directory and Printer*! Ink,
however, and concentrates most of his ener
gies upon them.
N. W. A} IK Â« SON.
It Is not strange to find in Philadelphia an
advertising agency thai has probably achieved
a greater measure of success in handling
American advertising than any other. This
city has always led the van in progressive
methods of publicity, as may be instanced by
mention of such names as Wanamaker, Frank
Siddall and J. K. Powers.
.Messrs. N. \V. Aver it Son have been in busi
ness for something over a quarter of a century
and are a Living example of their well-known
motto that "keeping everlastingly a; it brings
success."
Ayer's newspaper directory is considered by
many to be the best publication of its kind
extant.
Among their clients are inch well-known ad- -.
vertisers Â»v L. K. Fairbanks Company (pro
prietors of Cottojene and Gold' Dust Wash*
ing Powder), Dra. Starkcy & Pa.'en and Brown

DAUCHY & CO.

straightforward business methods that serve it ' ' !
in good part in its extensive dealings with the ,
newspaper publishers of the land. Amor"?. â¢ â 
some of its clients may be instanced such ** v >Â£l

OTHER AGENCIES.
There are such a number of first-class agen

SOME SUCCESSFUL ADVERTISING
AGENTS FROM AMONG THE FAIB
SEX.
A few years ago there was published In New
York a German paper called the New Time.
Mrs. M. C. Well became connected with it in
the capacity of advertising solicitor, and, al
though the paper soon succumbed under ad
verse conditions, she fought her way along the
line and is now a successful advertising agent. â 
She occupies a handsome suite of offices in the
Times building, and handles some very large
accounts, including; Humphrey's Homeopathic
Remedies and the Imperial Hair Regenerator.
Miss Mary Compton is another lady who has
made a marked success in this business. Her
specialty is the advertising of schools and col- "v ,
leges. " \v
Miss N. Volkman. who also has her office in \,
the Times building, has an extensive clientage \
among amusement enterprises. I
SPECIAL AGENTS. J
Probably the two best known and most bril
liant examples of the successful special agents
are Messrs. A. Frank Richardson and S. C. Beck
with, both of whom represent a long list of
leading newspapers.
California is also well represented in this
field. First there is Sydney P. Palmer of the
San Francisco Evening Posi, San Jose Mercury
and Los Angeless Express; then we have E.
Katz, who has accomplished great things for
the San Francisco Examiner, and last, but cer
tainly not least, The Cai/l's own special East
ern representative. David M. Polls. All these
gentlemen are weil known in California, and
it may be confidently stated that their chosen
State "has no need to complain of the loyalty of
her absent sons. Pekcie W. 11 art.

NEW YEAR'S DAY.
Man is a conventional animal. He not
only puts garments on bimsell, but he
clothes everything around him with an
artificial jzarb. Nature Ikis furnished no
reason why any particular day should be
celebrated as the beginning of the year.
The revolution of the earth is continuous,
and one day to its ordered course is no
more than any other. To the human
mind, however, conventional usages are
facts as important as those of nature her
self, and, despite all that reason may urge,
men will feel that a now year begins to
day, and that with it they enter upon a
new epoch in their lives.
Man is a ceremonial animal. When
ever lie desires to confer distinction on
I something nature has not distinguished, he
lishee a ceremony for the purpose.
Thus, he provides a special etiquette for
conduct in the presence of a King or a
Justice of the Peace, in order that they
may not l>e confounded with other men as
nature has a fashion of doing. When,
therefore, for convenience in arranging
dates and recording the time of the occur
rence of events, a particular day was
agreed upon as the beginning of a new
year, there grew up instinctively a desire
to mark it by some ceremonial observance
and make it a great day.
Man is a superstitious animal. He is
the creature of his own creations. When
ever he has. surrounded some individual
with an etiquette, or some day with a cere
mony, then he straightway begins to feel
some mysterious significance emanating
from the forms he has fashioned. At times
he even comes to believe there is something
divine in them, lie regards them with
solemnity or joyousness according to his
mood, but always he reverences them
and has a suspicion of the sanity or moral
ity of any one who moefc<at them or even
neglects them. Thus, having endowed
New Year's day with a ceremony, he
straightway began to feel an .influence in
it affecting his individual career. It be
came to him a new era, a new start in life,
a time to begin all over again and be dif
ferent from what he was.
Man is an aspiring animal. As soon as
any inlluence is felt in his inner life he
seizes upon it as a means by which he can
lift himself to higher things. Even his
superstitions are used as wings by which
he hopes to mount, if not to divinity, at
least to a loftier humanity. When he be
gan to conceive of New Year's day as the
starting of a new life he at once became
conscious of a desire for a better life. He
resolved to repent, to atone, to redeem
himself and be regenerated with a nobler
nature. Therefore he consecrated the day
to good resolutions. He roÂ«e to greet the
world with the glad salutation of "Happy
New Year" and determined within his
heart that he would help to make it so.
Man is the godlike animal. He has in
him the creative power to will into ex
istence much of the force by which his
destiny is made. It matters not to him
whether the inspiration that moves his
will comes from some vast substance splen
did as the sun or some poor pomp and
vanity of his own imagining. It is suffi
cient for him if his will be roused. To
him who has resolved with clear mind and
brave heart to serve the State, the City,
his friends and himself to better purpose
this year than last, it will matter little
that in tbe natural order of things to-day
is not more of a starting point than yester
day or to-morrow. It will be to him a
true New Year's day, the beginning of a
new epoch of life, the dawn of anew era.
CONSOLIDATING EFFORTS.
The Half-million Club has taken a wise
step in retiring from the field as a sepa
rate organization and determining to de
vote its energies through the work of the
individuals composing it to the furthering
of the purposes of other organizations
having kindred aims. This club was
formed to increase the population of San
Francisco to 500,000. The growth and size
of a city depend on elements wholly dif
ferent from those which concern the de
velopment of the interior. There are only
two ways in which the population and
business of a city can be increased. One
is by extending its commerce and the
other by developing the country immedi
ately contributary to it.
For the first purpose we have the Traffic
Association, which looks to the securing
of reasonable transportation rales, and the
numerous unions of producers which are
constituted largely to extend the area of
their markets. For the second purpose we
have the State Development Committee,
which is advertising the State abroad and
working to secure immigration; and the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, whicL aims principally to promote
prosperity by encouraging the consump
tion of home products. An organization
not directly related to either of these pur
poses, but equally as important, is the
Merchants' Association, which is seeking
to improve the physical condition of San
Francisco, and still another is the Civic
Federation, which aims to .secure political
honesty and efficiency in municipal affairs.
Hence there was really no room for the
Half-million Club as an independent or
ganization. It could not hopeÂ«directly to
increase the population of the City. That
could be accomplished only indirectly by
developing the resources of the interior,
making industries of all kinds profitable
by resort to various means, and improving
the physical and political condition of the
City. The work of its disbanded members
will be far more effective when devoted to
these various other movements.
This disbanding represents the exceed
ingly useful idea of concentration. Even
as it is we can hardly hope to accomplish
the best results. We have no central gov
erning board harmonizing the efforts of
the various separate organizations and
concentrating all efforts on definite lines
of restricted purpose. Such a consolida
tion would be a powerful agency at present,
when we have before us the Nicaragua
canal, the railroad debt and the extinction
of the Panama Railway as a competing
transportation line. It is not too late to
effect some central organization, which, if
formed, would represent an enormous
power. The Half-miliion Club by dis
banding has given a hint in that direction.
THE TWO CANAL BILLS.
The bills introduced in the Senate and
the House of Representatives for the
promotion of the Nicaragua canal are
different only in the amounts for which
the Governments of the United states,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica shall become
responsible. The Senate bill, introduced
uy Mr. Perkins of California, provides that
these amounts shall be 50 percent larger
than are provided for in the House bill.
That is to say, the Perkins bill provides
for 1,000,000 shares of the value of $150
each; of this amount the United State*)
shall take 915,000 shares, Nicaragua ttO.ooo
and Costa Rica 15,000. There is at present
no reason for doubting that Nicaragua
and Josta Rica will agree to these terms
if the bill is passed by Congress.
It would be difficult to convince the
public that the bitter light against the
canal project is not inspired by the re
cently consolidated interests of C. P.
Huntiiigtou and the Panama Railway.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY I, 1*96.
The agreement at which they recently ar
rived makes the Nicaragua canal matter
of vital importance to them. The con
struction of this canal would break the
monopoly which has thus been created
and enable traffic between the eastern and
western sides of the United States to be
conducted openly, with the novel element
of partial Government control as a regula
ting factor and a bar to traffic arrange
ments which would operate in restraint of
trade.
Not only these important results, but
also others of equal value, would be accom
plished by the construction of the canal.
England, alive to the importance of crip
pling the Monroe doctrine, sees in the
financial backing of the canal and its vir
tual control oi the situation a solution of
the problems which are now worrying
it with regard to its position in South
America. It is doubtless ready to lend to
the canal company all the money required,
and the company is merely holding off in
tho hope that the United States will prove
equal to the gravity of the situation. This
canal ia really more important than the
Venezuelan Commission, or any of the
other great matters which are now absorb
ing the attention of Congress.
As a highway for traffic the canal would
offer inducements with which it would be
impossible for the Panama Railway to
compete. By means of it ships could pass
across the isthmus without the expense
and delay of unloading upon cars and then
reloading at the other end. Still another
important consideration is that Lake Nica
ragua, being fresh water, could be utilized
by ships for cleaning their hulls of barna
cles, and the rich territory contiguous to
the lake would develop a producing ca
pacity which would constitute in itself a
very important item of the canal's traffic.
The greatest urgency should be employed
in pushing the canal project through Con
gress.
CAUSES OF FAILTJEE.
It never would have been possible for
the railroad and steamship interests of
Mr. Huntington to hold control of the
traiiic of California had not the merchants
of San Francisco contributed to that re-
puW, They have done this through no
love for Mr. Huntington, but because they
lacked his business shrewdness. For more
than a quarter of a century they have
been toys in his hands. Now and again,
when such a daring scheme as his recent
arrangement with the Panama Railway
was carried through, they have made
desperate efforts to- shake off his power.
In every instance he has outwitted them
and beaten them down, largely using their
distrust of one another to that end.
Powerful railroad companies desiring to
build into California and have San Fran
cisco as a terminus have in the past sent
agents into this City for the purpose of
ascertaining what the people were willing
to do. Generally all that was asked was a
contract for shipping freight for a term
of years at a figure lower than the rates of
the Southern Pacific. The Southern Pa-
ciiic would immediately offer stili lower
rates, generally to those who were showing
a disposition to make contracts with the
proposed new road. The shippers would
instantly fall into the trap and the opposi
*'on road would be kept away.
The North American Navigation Com
pany was a conspicuous example of the
way in which our efforts for freedom are
thwarted by the superior shrewdness of
Mr. Huntington. The company was
formed by San Francisco shippers, and
rates much lower than those charged by
the Pacific Mail were established. As
these rates were hardly sufficient to meet
the running expenses of the company, it
was a simple matter for the Pacific Mail to
step in at the proper moment with greatly
reduced rates. Shippers immediately
abandoned their own enterprise, patronized
the Pacific Mail and let their own cÂ©m
pany go to ruin. And yet they say to-day
that they saved the State millions of dol
lars above the losses of the Navigation
Company.
Our merchants now realize that they
themselves have made possible the recent
deal between the Panama Railway and the
Pacific Mail, whereby Mr. Huntington has
a fuller control than ever before of our
traffic. They unanimously declare with
perfect wisdom that clipper ships round
the Horn offer the only solution of the
problem, and they rightly believe that
rates overland and by way of the isthmus
will be inevitably raised.
But unless ihey make long-term con
tracts with clipner ships, so as to bind
themselves as well as the vessels, they will
more than likely meet the fate of the past
â they will be led into the trap of low rates
made by the Panama and Sunset routes,
and will abandon the means which they
have devised for their deliverance. They
fear that some merchant not binding him
self to an opposition line will receive ad
vantages which they may not enjoy. It is
this fear that explains the whole mystery
of Mr. Huntington's grasp upon the com
merce and industries of the State.

OFFICERS ARE ANXIOUS.
The County Covernment Act Will
Bo Tested in the Supremo
', Court.
The County officials who hold office un
der the consolidation act are preparing to
make a test of the powers of the county
government act before the Supreme Court.
Under the consolidation act their tenure
of office is but two years, while under the
recently enacted iaw four rears are the
term.
A question has been raised whether or
not the new act applies to San Francisco
and it is this Doint which the officials de
sire to settle.
A- number o f officials desired to hold a
private meeting to. discuss the matter, but
among them Police Judge Low, de
clined to attend such a gathering, on the
i ground that such action might be con
strued as a conspiracy to keep them in
offices whether entitled to them or not.
A public meeting will beheld during the
next week, at which all the officials are ex

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Thomas Barry, a rich cattle and sheep grower
of Custer County, Montana, who, as he says,
drove horses out of here for Montana as early
as '70, is at the Russ.
Mr. Barry's headquarters in Montana is at
Forsytne, fifty miles this side of Miles City, the
county seat of Custer County, an old Indian
outpost. He has come back ana forth trora
Montana to California so much in recent years
that he feels almost as much a Calif or nian as a
Montanan.
Moreover, he has lately purchased of ex-Min
ister to Japan F. A. Coor \>s, and other heirs,
the old and well-known Coombs ranch, one
mile north of Napa. He is now building on it,
and improving it in other ways besides setting
out a grove or walnut trees.
"This has been a pood year in Montana for
cattle," he said. "We have shipped more cat
tle out of the State than we ever did before.
"Prices have been good, too. The cattle have

averaged about $37 each. We have made a
rough estimate that 40,000 have been shipped,
which is a much greater number than last
year. There has been good grass, however,
and cattle generally have been in good condi
tion.
'â¢As for sheep tlicv have been in better <lt'
mand than last year. The wool brought from
ten to twelve cents a pound, and the mutton
brought 50 cents a head more than formerly.
"There are a great many sheep in Montana â
something like 3,000,000 of them. You may
be sure 1 am in favor of a tariff on wool, and I
know scarcely a grower in the new State that
is not. They all want it. and believe the con
ditions demand it.
"I have been spending a good deal of my
time in California now for ten years. The
Coombs ranch which I have bought, I shall im
prove to some extent and hereafter I shall con
sider California my home."

THE NEW VOLUME.
Come, open the book of the new-born year,
All stainless, white as the snow-
Not an evil blot nor a painful tear,
Nor a written line of woe.
The old-year volume had many a ta!Â«
Were better by far untold:
Too often a word with an echo of wall.
A dearth of the heart's pure gold.
May the book new opened be all replete,
When its pages are closed at last,
With poems of deeds, whose memories sweet
.Shall be joys when the yoar is past.

The Christmas edition of the San Francisco

resources of our State. It is an excellent edi

A Marvel.
Couiterville Miner.
The 52-page Christmas edition of The Call
is a marvel of newspaper enterprise. It is
California clear through, and handles every
detail concerning our wonderful State in a
Flaiu, truthful and highly interesting manner.
t may well be termed a California encyclo
pedia, and people can do no better service for
this section than to send a copy to their iriends
throughout the world.
Xcver One Like It.
Bakersfleld Californian.
One of those papers which are laid away for
reference and preserved for the fund of valu
able information afforded is the Christinas
Call. There has never been an issue of any
California paper like it, and in every detail it
shows that the man at its head is a thorough
newspaper man in every sense of the word.
The Call is rapidly growing in circulation
and bias fair to become the leading paper on
the coast.
Of Value to Ail.
San Jose Xcv.s.
The Christmas edition of the San Francisco
Call was a paper that reflected great credit on
the manager who conceived it and did honor
to the State. There was absent from Its
columns the skyrocket razzle-dazzle usually
found in extra holiday editions, and its place
was filled with interesting and useful informa
tion, valunblo. to ell classes of people. It was a
paper that instructed, while it entertainedâ in
fact, it was a model newspaper.
A World's Kecord.
San Luis Obisro Tribune.
The San Francisco Call made a new world's
record for phenomenal editions in its Christ
mas number and established a new and incon
trovertible claim to leadership among the
great metropolitan journals of the country.
It was a demonstration that great bulk was
not necessarily destructive of excellence- in
quality; that to i:.ultijÂ»ly volume it is not
necessary to useshoddy and refuse filling. We
would say that the edition had reached the
standard of a high-class magazine, but that,
after all, might be a dubiouscompliment. The
Christmas number of The Call was rend.
That is higher praise, editions are
usually only "hefted" and glanced at askance.
It "Was a "Stunner."
I'kiah Herald.
The Christmas edition of the San Francisco
Call was a "stunner," loaded with the best
selected statistics to be derived from the history
and progress of our wonderful State. Every
page, from the lirst to the fiitv-second, was
filled with matter of the most importance
facts that are bucked up by preponderance of
evidence. .Every article was from the pen of
men who. .are familiar with the great Suite oi
California, and more especially those from
each county. Every reader in California
should forward this edition of TiifCai.l to a
friend in the East; it will bring to us a larger
population and one whom we will welcome as
a needed addition. It is not a boom sheet, but
one devoted to the interests of our glorious
State and the kind that places us before the
ceople as we are.
Fascinating Reading.
Mission Journal.
The Christmas edition of the San Francisco
Call, although of enormous size, was beyond
doubt the most interesting, instructive and
valueble holiday paper published. The char
acter of the numerous articles contributed by
men of such high standing in the community,
(â¢! unquestioned authority in their respective
spheres, gives the paper" a value that must
create an unusual demand from all true Cali
forniaus who are interested in me welfare of
tlie State. The almost complete absence of the
business, that is. the paid-for portion, and the
literary value of the contributions, together
with the pruning of statist ienl bristles
makes the reading most fascinating. C. JH
Bhorjtridge, the enterprising proprietor and
eriitor, has added another laurel to his wreath,
nnd continues to win eolden opinions from all
lovers of fair play and true enterprise.
MARRIED IN 1835.
Mr. and Mrs. Geuilar Celebrate Their
Sixtieth Anuiver-
sary.
Mr. and Mrs. E. F. Gendar of 543 Steven
son street celebrated their sixtieth wed
ding anniversary last Monday evening.
They were married in New York in 1835,
and the marriage certificate, issued by
Rev. George Benedict of the Baptist
Church, was displayed at the anniversary
celebration. Mr. Gendar is 82 years of age
ami his wife is two years younger. The
husband belongs to a family that was
prominent at New York in revohuionary
times, and his grandmother won distinc
tion by raising the first American flag at
her city in a sort of Barbara Frietsche
style after General Howe had capitulated.
Mrs. Gendar's aunt, Barbara Brave, figured
in the revolution by rowing out to an
English ship at night and tossing food
through the portholes to the American
sailors imprisoned there.
Mr. and Mrs. Gendar moved from New
YorK to this City in 1856. Mr. Gendar was
formerly in the fruit business, Edward
Sanderson, a son of the ex-Mayor, being
his partner. Three sons reside in this
City, the only surviving children.
THE FERRY DEPOT.
Attoi-ney-Geiieral Fitzgerald Says That
Oregon Stone Must Be UÂ»i>d.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald and the
Harbor Commissioners are at outs over
the erection of the new ferry depot. Mr.
Fitzgerald says the Oregon gray stone
called for in the contract must be used,
while Governor Budd, ex-Attorney Strat
ton and the present attorney, Tirey L.
Ford, of the board are of the opinion that
the Com missioner? have full power to sub
stitute any stone they think best so long
as the extra cost does not exceed $.SOOO.
President Colnon and Commissioners
Cole and Cbadbourne were chagrined over
the turn. affairs have taken and all the
waiting contractors were told to return
again to-morrow. .lust what steps will
be taken it is hard to say, but the
chances are that the bonds wiH'be accepted
in spite of the adverse opinion of the At
torney-General.
In regard to the offer of the granite com
pany to supply granite and marble in
place of Colusa site stone the Commis
sioners find that the extra cost will be $40,
--000. This shuts out the granite and mar
ble and the Colusa stone still leads in the
estimation of the Commissioners.

CENTURY CLUB RECEPTION.
Booms Beautifully Decorated to Receive
Guests To-Day â 3liisic and Posters.
The advent of the new year of 1896 will
be recognized io-day by the Century Club
in the form of a reception tendered by
members of the club-to their friends. The
Century is a prosperous, although a some
what exclusive institution, to which 200
or more of the leading ladies of Saa Fran
cisco belong, hence an opening of its doors
to admit men for a few hours is a depart
ure attaining the dignity of an event.
The reception will begin to-day at 3
o'clock p. m., and if the programme is not
broken the functions, so far as it applies
to non-meiubers, will end three hours
later.
Yesterday many of the ladies were busy
turning evergreens about the chandeliers
and pacing posters â bizarre and beauti
ful, French and Americanâ on the inner
walls of the club. Some New Year offer
ings in ttie line of posters have been de
signed especially for the Century. One of
notable excellence in drawing is the Joint
production of Miss Lester and Miss Leach.
Something equally attractive is expectel
from Mrs. o' Sullivan and Miss Hyde.
These ladies^ are members of the club,
therefore their work as artists is doubly
valued.
Mrs. John Swift, president of tho club,
was at the Century House yesterday, but
observing the constitutional prohibition
against making the affairs of the institu
tion public, cleverly evaded an interview
as to the significance of the reception, rfo
far as she cum judge there is harmony in
the club, and >he la surely one to know if
discord lias crossed tin 1 threshold.
The ladies visiting the club to-day, as
well as the members' of the other sex, will
have music to beguile them and refresh
ments to allure them. But the show will
only last three hours.

The Imperial Cycling Club enjoyed a
tlieater party at the Tivoli ilonday night
Jast. They eneatred lour boxes, which
were tilled with members of che cluh and
draped in their colors of purple and white.
Ihe Olympic Club Wheelmen of this
<^ity, Garden City Cyclers of San Jose and
Acme Club Wheelmen of Oakland all
liave century runs planned for to-day, and
all three are desirous ot beinc the hist to
complete the journey around the bay.
They will therefore 'start at 12 o'clock
Wednesday mornin<r. New Year's day,
and hope to have the ride completed
about the time most people will be arising
for breakfast, for a century is hardly
worthy of tne name if it is not completed
withm seven hours. The roads are not in
the best of condition, however, and the
trip will be a hard one on the men.
The National assembly of tie League of
American Wheel men will be held in Bal
timore next February.
The Bay Cily "Wheelmen had a theater
party at 'the "Tivoli last evening. Ferris
Hartmann took advantage of the occasion
to get off a number of jokes at the expense
of the cyclers, which were thoroughly en
joycu, and the club members In-lped to
make the evening enjoyable with their
own antics. Between the wheelmen and
the opera the audience at the Tivoli last
night must have had a merry time.

My charge against Justus.' H. Nelson was,
Mr. Editor, that while lie represented hirrifel
as persecuted/for saying that, tne wor^hipo
the Virgin Mary was idolatry; in reality .'.(a) He
was not persecuted lor conscience sake, .(^lie
was guilty of blackguardly. behavior'^n.^the.
public streets, 'c) He was jailed for
â writing in the public prints. 'I-'rioiv proceed Ap

science sake. '-â¢.---; â¢ â¢â  .;'.'.-.. .'â â¢â 'â¢' :â -â â¢;.
To demonstrate this proposition- I Offe-r three
proofs taken from Dr. Case's letter, : . â "â¢'â -.'" : .â â â â ;â â : ;
1. The law in Brazil does not. inflict: pena
ties for religious belief.- In fact its 'provisions,
are the same as with us. ' The Mcthodist.Chri
tian Advocate confesses this In its opening sen T .
tence: . -.-. .-.- â 'â â â 'â  'â¢â .'â¢' â¢""â¢i-' : ' -â¢'.-â 
Under the empire the established; religion .was
Roman Catholic, but under the republic the con-:
uection between church and state lias been abol
iflbea, mi! an absolute equality has been .declared
between all forms of religion. 'â â '.-.-:'.â¢ â¢â¢.'-.â 
Yet the veracious Dr. Case cries hysterically
at the'end of his letter, "Catholic-law! which
concedes no rights or privileges to those who
teach Protestant truth against papal novel
ties!" The fact is, by his own autnority, that j
Protestants have precisely the same rights
under the law as Gathollcs. . . ; . â â¢ â .:;..-'â â¢.;
2. This fact becomes more evident when we
remember that, according to the Methodist
Christian Advocate, J. H. Nelson ard his com
panions had labored without let or hindrance^
for ten years in Brazil. They engaged â 'â¢in
evangelical, educational and mission work."
Tney preached, prayed and published new*--.
papers, and until 1893. we do not hear a word,
of opposition. If it be true that Brazil is a
persecuting country and the Catholics, intol
erant, is it not strange that they took so long
,to wake up? Of course the truth is that, there
were no laws in Brazil to hinder Mr. Nelson's
work, nor are there any now. "Catholic lawâ
which concedes no rights or privileges to those; .
who teach Protestant truth against papal nov
el lies" â conceded Justus H. Nelson rights and
privileges enough to allow him to teach all .he
pleased, unmolested for ten years. '. *
3. Theret>ortof the. United States Minister, as .
quoted by Dr. Case, makes- no reference what
ever to religious persecution. It merely states
that the condemnation was "according to the
jaw." The-law is not, as .Dr. Case calls it,"
"Catholic law," but is; as the Advocate con-.
fetses, a law" which declares ''an absolute equal
ity between all forms of religion." It is, there
fore, in American eyes, a just law, and your'
readers will remark. Mr. Editor, the significant
words with.'which the United States Minister
clones his report: "No denial of justice being
made evident." It is clear that this unbiased
American considered that the Rev. Justus had
received his just deserts.
Hence, 1 conclude, from the opening words of
the Christian Advocate, from the ten years'
unhindered work of .J. 11. Nelson and iroin the
report of the United .States Minister, that,
whatever may have been the cause of Mr. Nel
bo i â  imprisonment, that cause could not have
been religious persecution.
(&) "Justus H. Nelson was guilty of black
guardly conduct in the public street-.' 1
Mncaulay says -'A man whose manners and
sentiments are decidedly below those of his
class deserves to be. called a blackguard." I
shall have proved my proposition if I" can show
that the conduct of the Rev. J. H. Nelson on
the public streets was low and indecent. r
For proof 1 quote his own words:
I have been twice mobbed on tire streets for not
paring reverence to images of saints chat wore
being carried [broach the streets in procession.
â¢ * * The two mobs did me no barm, i hough
canes and umbrellas were brandished furiously and
there were threats enough shrieked and shouted to
annihilate a regiment If carried into effect. In
both cases my hat was jerked or knocked off, but
triendlv persons with whom l waa acquainted at
the time interposed and warded off further vio
lence,
This reads very nice and straight, and it is
the story of the dear injured innocent himself.
However let the judicious reader peruse it
once more and then consider.
(1) In Brazil the images of the saints are not
carried promiscuously round the streets, but
only on great feasts, in -solemn procession,
afler neb preparation and with due notice.
(2) Therefore the Rev. J. H. Nelson did not
meet the obnoxious images, a.s it were, by ac
cident when he was going quietly along the
street attending to his own business.
(3) As a matter of tact J. H. Nelson came of
his own free-will to view the procession, and
betook his .-T':iid in the 'midst of the people
who lined the streets to see the procession
pass. " â¢
(4) These people were all Roman Catholics,
who looked upon the procession as a religious
ceremony, and who considered their own at
tendance tb.sreat as a religious act.
(5) .'When, therefore,. J. 11. Nelson -took his
Stand-in- the street,- in the- midst -of these
Rbriian Catholics; be was of -.his own free-will:

To (he Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Bib: Peter C. Yorke: of County Galway, Ire
land, Chancellor archdiocese of Saii Francisco.
religious editor Monitor/,/ still sustains his
billingsgate reputation. It is. indicative: of a
ver. unclean mouth in the confessiou box.
Our last letter made Peter C. Voi.ke sick. He
k:. j :\\ 8 what's behind it. No wonder he- simply
3'eUed "new forgeries." He wants to .rest his
case on his yell of "Forgery, forgery?' or "You
you are a "linr, you arc a 'liar!" Or upon the
affidavit of a Jesuit niadY- in behalf'of himselfâ
a witness who for truth and veracity would not
be accepted before the Dar of any civilized na
tion in the world. This, in our recent letter,
was exemplified where we. showed that all the
civilized countries oi the world iiad run these
Jesuit priests out. . :
Peter 0. Yorke knows full well that the fol
lowing quotation is the law of his church, and
thai it governs the actions of Bishops and
Archbishops In changing or removing- priests
from one parish to another. It is the law and
the practice of the Roman Catholic church.
Of course Peter C. Yorke is terribly displeased
that the Roman Catholic laity have found
out what miiy be the cause of a new priest
coming to them. This is the law:
"Questionâ ls it allowable to transfer priests
of bod morals from one parish to another in
stead of deposing them? Answerâ lf the char
acter of such priests is unknown in the new
parish, and tf there is a reasonable hope that
by the change they will reform, it is unques
ti( tmbly lawful to transfer them to another
pariah."
The above is the canon law of the Catholic
church, and is found in the standard text
book of ecclesiastical law in the United Str.tes,
called "Eminent* of Ecclesiastical Law," by
Smith, vol. 1, p. 171.
The above simply gives the people who be-
Loiig to the Roman Catholic church to under
Btand thai anything in the shape of a priest
must be good enough for them. Will Peter (J.
Yorke tell us when and where did Priest
Becker die? lie was certainly alive when he
was trar.sferrt-d to Urcen Bay diocese, M'cui
gnu, for his ''health."
Peter C. Yorko shows his poor judgment
when he undertakes to defend the nefarious
Jesuits, especially in a great popular newsLm
per like The Cam.. He ought to see that there
is a pre-ii expo are jusi ahead,
feter c. Yorke haa mtule another blunder.

inform the rectors and try all winning ar

our affairs turns on tnis point, viz., that all
our members, by studying a compliance with
every one's humor, work themselves into the
good graces of their penitents and others with
whom they converse; to which end, where
places are inhabited oy the rich and noble, let
the provincials take care to send a consider
able number. What a plentiful harvest- is
likely to crown their endeavors!"
"If it happens that rich married people, who
are friends, have daughters, let these be per
suaded by our members to make choice of a re
ligious life. But should there be an only son,
let,no means be omitted to b ing him over to
the society and treeing him from the fear of
his parents; show him how acceptable to God
should he desert his parents without their
consent; and if this be effected, let him enter
the novitiate in a remote college, having first
given information to the general." â  . -, ? -

leave 1 the selection to laymen. : About the '
wholestory is told in this open letter, that \
it.would be.'a farce ; to elect .a' "butcher to '

; . â¢ 'It is quite proper and very necessary to I
have a professional programme in compe
titions. . Ire: the case of the Affiliated Col
leges the : ereatÃst. amount of information
should be given to the architects so that
they might intelligently consider plan?. . I.
know from Experience when a draughts
man-working on . plans for â â : the college:
of agriculture Vof the â â¢. university, that
there .was a vast amount of : technical
knowledge required ; before : the architect
was able to design the ; building properly.
It is not. likely that the architect would
have technical knowledge to build a inedi- : I
cal college or a laboratory. ,v. Building and 1
fitting them , up requires years of study
from doctors and chemists. For illustra
tion, suppose a man came to me and said:
'Build me a : furnishihg-gobds. store.' : How
could I tell what he wanted? How design
shelves and drawers, without full knowl
edge : ; and 1 instruction . from him ? The
same thing applies to the colleges, and we
don't know anything about.them. ; : â -â â _:
â  â - "As I understand this college matter,
the. : regents employed two architects to
travel and get facts concerning most im
proved colleges and make a. report to the
board,' ;. , ; .:'. \- y â â ... \';; : :'â -'. â¢â¢â â  â ; .' ..â 
"The law provides that the contract shall
be open to competition, and when a row
was . made recently the regents advertised
for plans to be in by. the middle of Janu
ary. No : human being could get plans in
.by. that time. â¢.'â ;.".:*;â .â â¢'. '.'â¢ ;â "â¢.â .'.
"I consider that a prize of 1^ per cent
for. the competition is fair. We generally
charge 1 per cent of the proposed cost f or
preliminary sketches; but in this case the
money has been distributed among a num
ber of people, so 1% per cent is probably
about right. .;â â¢.. .â¢â¢.' â â¢. ;
"I believe that the. committee of archi
tects chosen to act as judges should be al
lowed to co-operate with the regents, or
with" other committees having control of
public buildings, in passing judgment on
the. plans, because there are so many.tech
nical points involved about, which nobody
but the architect knows anything. \ .
"It is usually the case in competitions
that the bigger the design or drawing sub
mitted the bigger the men intrusted with
selection imagine it to be."
Bryan J. Clinch remarked that the agi
tation for competent judges was an old
story. "Public architectural works ought
to be judged by experts," said he. â 
"The first condition of an intelligent
competition is that it should be conducted
by intelligent and competent judges. Who
is to choose the judges? The Legislature,
the Supervisors or committee, or whoever
is the manager of the competition. But
we cannot it-sue a general mandate with
out knowing to whom it is addressed.
They should appoint . architects to judge
the competition. Providing for competi
tion without providing for competent
judges is simply absurd."
A. C. Schweinfurth, who has created a
stir over the Affiliated Colleges competi
tion, was of the same opinion in nearly
every particular as the writer of the open
letter to members of his craft. - ,
"A few of my friends and myself," he
said, "thought it time we should* stop this
sort of thing. . We are bound to see a fair
stand made; therefore, yesterday il: for

mally retained Roger Johnson, a gentle
man well up in building law, to watch
the case as it stood. We propose to make
a test case of the Affiiliated Colleges. A
full programme should be presented to
architects, as in the East, so that they
might know what they would have to do.
We expect fair play and that the plans
shall be passed on by uninterested parties.
The judging should be done by outside
architects not interested in tue. competi
tion. â "."' / â "â 'â 'â 'â :

by the regents must give up the knowledge

little improvement did she show that only
on Monday her trainer, Daggie Smith of
the Oakland stable, resolved to ship her
back to Mr. Follansbee's ranch. How
over, she was a starter in yesterday's race,
along with nine other maidens, with
"Skects" Martin in the saddle. When her
trainer fell heir to a $20 gold piece and
proceeded to bet it on his charge in the
ring the bookmaker banded him the
ticket with a look of compassion on his
face. Mt. McGregor II was an even
money favorite in the ring, but when
challenged in the stretch by the rank out
sider, who was always prominent during
the running, fell easy prey to her sud
denly acquired speed and was beaten out
easily in the excellent time of 1:U1^.

THE BANDITS TO BE HELD
Judge Conlan Believes Middle
miss, Welch and Gardi
ner Guilty.
Captain Lees Has Evidence That the
Robbers Intended to Wreck
the Car.
Police Judge Conlan has virtually made
up his mind that he will hold to answer
before the Superior Court the three men,
Gardiner, Middlemiss and Welch, who are
under arrest on charges of robbery in con
nection with the Ingieside car "hold-up."
"The accusation against these men is
too serious for me to assume the responsi
bility of discharging them, no matter how
strong an alibi they may prove," stated
the Judge yesterday to a Call reporter.
â¢'lt makes no difference to me if the
Superior Court discharges them ten min
utes after I hold them to answer, my duty
is plain, and I must see that they get be
fore the proper tribunal and are tried." â 
The Judge was fresh from his moonlight
ride to the ocean beach with Detectives
Cody and Gibson, where they showed him
the circumstantial evidence pointing to
the guilt of Joe Middlemiss and Gardiner.
Continuing, Judge Conlan said: 'â  '.
'I saw the spot where the bag of money had
been hidden in the sand at the foot of the
seventh support to the pier. Mirtdlemiss and
1 rardiner were seen to go to the very spot ami
rake up the sand to find the bag. The place
â  before they arrived there was. all smoothed
ever, and of all that wide expanse of ocean
beach only this one. spot was disturbed. Then
when the police closed in on the pair they
climbed onto the pier and ran out to its end,
where they lay down. No one can make me
believe now after, seeing that pier that these
men were, drunk'/ When I got, up there I re
fused to go out to the end of it on account of
the danger of failing off. No, those men must
have been sober, and they knew just what they
were.doing. Â«.â â â . â â -;.-. â â¢*.â  a :.:.â¢â¢
Under the circumstances, it is not
probable that the three prisoners will be
liberated on the strength of the strong
alibi they are depending upon until a jury
passes upon their cases in. the Superior
Court. More than ever is Captain Lees
positive he has the right men. He is ad
verse, however, to telling exactly how he
expects to secure their conviction, but his
conversation clearly indicates that while
he does not pretend to claim the men were
the direct robbers who shot Cashier
Clarke and his companion Bronner, he be
lieves that the prisoners assisted the rob
bers. Captain Lees said :
Do you remember when Jimmy Hope was
caught in his attempt to rob the Bather Bank,
at the corner of Montgomery and Commercial
streets? Hope was upstairs trying to bore his
way into the roof of the vault. . Tied to his arm
was a string leading to the street, and his pal,
a man named Cummings, was supposed lobe
on the outside to pull the string" and notify
Hope in the event of the approach of the po
lice. Cummings did not attend to his busi
ness or else we would never have captured
Hope. Instead of looking out for his confed
erate, Cummings stepped into a saloon oppo
site the bank and got drunk with a lot of
printers. - â  â¢ â¢
This Ingleside case is only a repetition of the
Hope case. These prisoners, Middlemiss, Welch
and Gardiner, got drunk. They did not give
the proper cue to their confederates and the
robbers tackled the car on which, there was
but $1400, when they were looking for the
$6000 carried in by Assistant Secretary Gullen
on a car or two ahead. .â â¢â â â¢ ;. â  â  â -. .
It has come to the notice of the police
that on the night of the robbery some mis
creants had pulled the spikes holding
down the rails of the Ingieside track. The
purpose, no doubt, was to wreck one of the
cars. Whether the attempt was made for
the purpose of robbery or with intent only
to do mischief can only be surmised. Cap
tain Lees, however, believes that the deed
was part of the programme of the robbers
he has in the toils. ' "â¢ .
DIED FROM HIS INJURIES.
Charles Hook Charged With Man
slaughter for S. XV. Cook's Death.
G. W. Cook, tne employe of J. A. Folger
& Co. who was run over by an express
wagon on Market and Spear streets Mon
day evening, died at the Receiving Hospi
tal yesterday morning from his injuries.
Charles Hook, the driver of the wagon,
was arrested and charged with battery.
Yesterday morning Chief Crowley on learn
ing of Cook's death ordered a charge of
manslaughter to be entered against Hook
and the bonds were iixed at $3000.
Hook says he was driving along at an
ordinary rate of speed. He was looking
around watching an electric car and did
not know that he had run over any one till
somebody yelled to him.
The deceased was an elderly man and
was on his way to the ferry when the acci
dent occurred. He lived on Linden street,
Oakland.
Corneille would have died of want had
not Louis XIV accidentally heard of his
condition and sent him a sura of money.

appalling sternness.

that I had asked "so many people to din

The books of the Health Oince show that
d vi ing the year 7~<24 deaths occurred in
this City, and that during the same period
there were 5435 births. During the six
months ending yesterday the number of
deaths was 3344; during the same period
for 1894 the number was 3471, showing a
decrease lor 1895 of 127. During the same
period of this year the number of births
was 2185, and during the last six months
of 1884 the number was 1964, showing an
increase in 1895 of 221.
From figures furnished by Secretary
Casey and Librarian Clark of the Free
Public Library an idea is obtained of the
labors of the year in that institution. The
figures are up to December 30. Number
of books issued to borrowers outside,
183,544; number of books issued for use
in the library, 145, 101, making a total of
335.705; number of visitors to the news
paper department, 176,889; number of visi
tors to the periodical room, which was es
tablished in April, 48,985; number of bor
rowers' cards issued to enable patrons to
take books out of the library, ~\r-',l.
The records of the Police Department
show that during the year the total num
ber of arrests was 20,129. That is the record
up to 8 o'clock yesterday morning.
The books of the Auditor's office show
that during the year the collection of taxes
from all sources was $6,337,865 58, of which
$439,582 02 was for personal proDerty and
$(59,433 for Doll-tax. A few days since the
Auditor's office transmitted to the State
Treasurer the sum of $1, 031,000, being the
State's portion on the lirst installment of
real estate tax.
MONEY COINED.
Uncle Sam's Dollar Factory In This
-'. _:".. City Did Big Business
â .â¢.â â¢â¢". â¢:? â  Last Year.
The coinage at the United States Mint
at San Francisco for the calendar year is
over $2,500,000 greater than for the pre
vious year, the denomination of coinage
being as follows:
Double eagles $22,870,000 00
Eagles 490,000 00
Half eagles 660,000 00
Standard d011ar5..... 400,000 00
Half dollars. .' 654,043 00
Quarter dollars 441,170*25
Dimes..' 112,000 00
Total $25,427,213 25
The increase in. the gold coinage is due
to the fact that the deposits of gold were
greater than in the previous year, owing to
the revival of gold mining all over the
Pacific Coast. The indications are that
there will be still greater gold deposits
and consequently a larger gold coinage at
the San Francisco Mint during the coming
â¢ year. - \ ;

As tlie event was announced in The
Call of Monday; morning, a large throng
of spectators from the CCitsy s assembled: on
the margin of . the lield to view the ma
neuver? and see . the high officers' ;of ..the .
army and navy in uniform. Many of the
visitors were ladies. whoit^jjearedAo take
great delight in the BpeÂ«jtÃcle.;,.One stal
wart young lady . with an ielociUioniiry,
voice pushed the guard, off ; :hi : s i line, in her'
resistless determiiiation.'to; get an unob
structed view of the admiral. :^/Â»;.".; : ;-" = .'c
The crowd was-gp'od-na'turcd and easily
managed, however, by . tli" guards,' who
had only to admonish*', ,the.:v-.suectators
against invading the ': field. 'â  - â  .. .i;;v-.':-'V. ;â¢' .'â¢
At 10 o'clock the troops were- formed 1 for
review. The column consisted of a bat
talion of four fool batteries of the Fifth
Artillery, commanded by; Major John A.
Par i i two. â  batteries pi ..light â¢' artillery,
<:oxnman(!ed by :Major T;;!ly >.lo<Jrea t aiid
four troops of the Fourth Cavalry, com- '
manded by Colonel Samuel B. M. Young.
The reviewing position was indicated by |
the group of distinguished .officers to whom ,
the review was given and the equally dis
tinguished officers who paid the compli- i
111! Jit. = , ;'â¢"â - â 'â ; â¢".
The admiral's flag, a broad blue field," j
bearing two stars, was placed on a pike ;
planted near the American regulation flag.
A sergeant guarded it, and when the ' rer i
yiew was finished, it was folded up.for
duty again on the Philadelphia. It isa j
saying that the admiral's flag goes with
the admiral, and wherever ft floats, the ad
miral is supposed to be. This must be so,
for the sergeant placed it in the admiral's
carriage yesterday. ''Â-,
The rank of admiral in the navy corre
sponds to that of major-general in the
army, and therefore Admiral Beardslee
yesterday received the compliment of a
salute of thirteen guns.
The review was not all the ceremony j
at the Presidio yesterday, although it '
embraced maneuvers by infantry, cavalry :
and artillery- Regular monthly, inspection â 
and muster. for pay followed the exercises
on thÂ© field, hence the soldiers had all the
duties they wanted to perform in one 'day. !
The weather yesterday-forenoon was
simply delightful. There had not been
a better day in the year for field evolu
tions. The well-groomed and high-spirited
horses were on their mettle and evinced a. '
desire to go that could hardly be re- i
strained. Major Darling's prancing steed [
delighted the spectators. Passing the
reviewing stand, the horse fancied that he i
should show the admiral .a trick in high
stepping and gained more than passing at
tention. . â¢'â¢ â¢
At the conclusion of the review. General
Graham escorted Admiral Beardslee, Cap
â¢ tain Cotton, commanding the flagship
Philadelphia, Captain Cochrane of the I
marines. Lieutenant Stoney and other
officers of the admiral's staff to carriages.
The officers visited the dynamite and mor
tar batteries ami other fortifications of the \
post. After the ride General and . Mrs. j
Graham entertained the guests at their
post home.
Life at the Presidio is not altogether a I
dull routine of reviews, guard mount and
inspection. .The social diversions are j
quite enchanting. Last evening a pro- i
gressive euchre party was given at the
Â©ozv Presidio home of Major and Mrs.
Darling. The attendance was large and ;
braced many officers in uniform. The
tkcorations in" red, the color of the artil- j
- lÂ»ry, imparted warmth and good cheer to
the assembly.
Yesterday Captain Benjamin K. Rob- \
arts, Battery A, Fifth Artillery, was waited
Bpon by a delegation iron: the Oakland
Division No. 283 of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers. The 'legation
consisted of J. Jordan, Emits Prick and
W. R. Hatfield. The object of their visit
wan to place a wreath on the now famous
monument in the National Cemetery; The
committee said : "We want to show that
we are not unmindful of the soldiers who I
died with Brother Samuel Clarke, and we
have come to place a wreath of flowers on
their tomb."
The Moral offering was accordingly
placed at the base of the monument which
has been erected to the memory of soldiers
who perished in the train wreck, near
Sacramento, during Hie strike of 1894.
Mr. Jordan of the committee is a memb
er of Gettysburg Post, (I. A. R., Tulare;

HOW GAS BILLS PILE UP.
In Six Weeks Charles H.
Keeling's Had Quadrupled
Itself; â¢
He Refused to Pay the Last Bill and
Has Been Arrested for Steal
ing Gag.
Judge Campbell and a jury will soon
have to wrestle with a problem that has
been a source of perplexity and annoyance
to almost every householder in the City.
Charles H; Keeling,, a. saloon-keeper, on
TROOPS PASSING IN REVIEW BEFORE ADMIRAL L. 11. BFARDSLEE, U. S. N., AT THE PRESIDIO.
the corner where Green and. Stockton
streets and Montgomery avenue converge,
lias been arrested on the extraordinary
charge of stealing gas. â  â¢..-.. ;.,â¢â¢'
ife appeared in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday moriiing and was represented
by Attorneys Kenny and Rose. The gas
.company, which is the complaining wit
ness, Avaa represented by the lirrn of Gar
ber, 3oiilt t\: Bishop. ...... â¢-. - â 
When the. case was called, the.de
fendaht'a attorneys pleaded not guilty and
: demanded a jury. The J udge Bet the case
for trial on January 22.
Reeling's attorneys explained. the. nature
of the charge against him. When he first
took possession of the saloon he refused to.
put up the usual deposit of $5 fora meter,
but as he could not get a supply of gas
without it he finally made' -the deposit.
The bill for the first two weeks' con
sumption of gas amounted to the reasona
ble tJgure of $3 50, whion he willingly paid.
For the next two weeks the bill had almost
doubled itself, being $7 50. This sudden,
and alarming increase was a surprise to
Keeling, as he had been burning the same
number of lights and for about the same
length of time. He paid the bill, but could
get no satisfaction as to its size.
Keeling say? he made up his mind to be
economical in the use of gas, so he stopped
using it on the second floor of the place
and only used it on the first floor. Sus
pecting that some one might have been
tampering with the meter, he kept the
door giving access to it locked, and carried
the key in nis pocket. At the usual time
an employe of the com p.inv called to ex
amine the meter. Keeling was downtown
with the key of the door in his pocket, so
the man had to go away without inspect
ing the meter. .'...'
Keeliiig'a astonishment can be imagined
when he received h bill for the two weeks
amounting to' $14 ii r \ notwithstanding all
liis precautions in tne way of economy and
keeping the meter flecurely locked up.
Besides he claims that trie company's em
ploye had nut examined the meter at all.
When the collector called Keeling was
mad, and positively refined to pay the bill.
The company shut off his supply of gas,
but he turned it on again, and for this he
lias been arrested and will De tried by
twelve of his peers.
Captain Whitney'.* Companions.
An account was published last week of the
drowning in Half Moon Bay of Captain Whit
ney and two young men. Wil'.iuia I'rim;lc of

Tiie ;v..< young men who were drowned with
Captain \\ liitney lust week at Draffint beaco
were George BhoultÃ, who was about \'A
years of age. a native of Missouri, und Charles
Wmeky ot Si. Louis, age cot known, but quite
a young man. Neither bod; haa been re
covered. A diligent s- arch is being made by
the residents along the beach.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 1, 1896.
TOWNE ISSUED THE PASS
An Inference That Attorney Foote
Failed to Take Proper
Action.
A LATE EEPORT TO HARMON.
Statement Made by Frank M. Stone
That Huntington Did Not Give
Him His Ogden Pass. . ..â¢â¢''.
The result of United States tMstrict At
torney Henry S. Fdote's investigation of
; the allegations of Attorney George V\V.
Monteith that the management of the
! Southern Pacific violated the interstate
! commerce law in giving Frank M. Stone a
i pass to Ogden a year ago February is that
| the pass was issued by A, N. Tbwne and
| that Mr. Towne is lead.
When Mr. Monteith's letter was received
by United States Attorney -General Judson
; Harmon that om'cial instructed Mr. Foote
forthwith to look into the matter. Mr.
Foote's reply has been mailed to Wash
ington and he says that a letter has been
; sent also by Mr. Stone to Mr. Harmon.
The burden of the charge made by Mr.
Monteith was that Frank M. Stone bad
ridden out of this State and into Nevada
on a pass issued by President Collis P.
Huntington. Mr. Monteith stated in sup
port of this that on February a, 1894. Mr.
Stone left Oakland on train 3 at 6:30 p. m.
over the Southern Pacific line, bound for
Ogden; that he passed through Sacramento
late that evening and arrived at Truckee
| the noxt morning. At Truckee there was
: a change of conductors, and thence Mr.
! Stone was carried on to Carlin, Ney., and
ultimately to Ogden on his pass.
All this, with the exception of the pass
having been issued by Mr. Huntington,
Mr. Foote has found to be ..substantiated,
] but he has learned from the Southern Pa*
; cific Railway Company*s office, and from
Mr. Stone, himself, according to an ex
< planation given by him yesterday, that.
! Mr. Towne issued the pass, and not Mr
! Huntington.
The Huntington pass, says Mr. Foote,
was not i.-xiied to Mr. Stone until April 8,
and on that, declares the Government at
torney, Mr. B tone rode no further than
Redding, in this State. Mr. Stone has not
been out of the State since his trip to Red
ding, so Mr. Foote states, and to consti
tute a violation of the interstate com
merce law it would have to be shown that
Mr. Stone bad ridden from one State into
ano'theri In the case of the Towne pass,
the District Attorney declares, -there. â ran
not.be any prosecution because the person
who gave the pass is dead. . .;'â ..
The reason given by Mr. Foote for Mr.
Towne issuing the pass was that Mr.
Huntington was absent from the City,
Frank M. Stone has always refused to
speak on the matter, but yesterday was
induced, tvith the greatest reluctance", how
ever, on his part, to tell the story of the
two passes. Mr. Stone's statement would
appear to give the inference that United
States District Attorney Jb'oote was cogniz
ant, during the lifetime of Mr. Towne, of
the fact that Mr. Towne had issued the
pass to Mr. Stone, thereby violating the
law, yet had taken no action to bring the
offense to the attention of the Grand Jury.
Mr, Stone's version of the matter follows:
Judge Foote has called upon me on three
SPpnTate occasions and lias been fully advised
as io the exact lacts. Mr. Foote has always
known that the pass referred to (that issued by
C. I. Huntington) was never used outside of
the state of California.' I received it oriihe
Bth day of April, 1894, and I have not been out
of the State since some time before that date:
I receiyed; a special-pass, *ood from January
1, 1894, to March 31, 1894, from A. N. Towne,
I presume in return for many courtesies which
he may have thought-} had extended to him.
As between Judge Foote and myself our long
friendship would preclude my offeriiiÃ to suj>
port in? statement by.proof. But realizing he
wai ana is a Government official 1 have mi!>
mftted to him documentary proofs that f diet
not possess the i>Â»ss In question until after my
return from the East.
With all of these fnrts within the knowledge
of Judge Foote it would se-em unreasonable to
pursue the subject further on to the extent of
attempting. in the i ace of Judge Brown's de
cision to reindid Mr. Huntington, Judge Foote
well 'Knowing thai the pass in Question was
never used outside of the State of California.
Judge Foote has at all times expressed to me
his determination to carry out the law, no mat
ter who might be involved, and has been earn
est in his desire to ascertain the exact iacts re
garding the. use of the pass in question.
It is true thai I made the trip ;<> the Last on
a pass, as Stated in a letter addressed to Attor
ney-General Harmon by George \V. Monteith
but it whs made on the pass issued to me by
Mr. Towne.
"How do you account for the initials
'C. P. H.' which appeared on the pass used
on the Kastern trip, as shown in the record
of the conductor? 1 ' was asked.
'Whether or not that pass was issued to
me on account of Mr. Huntington I can
not'definitely state, but I know that it
was not issued by him.
"The information I have given to Jud<*e
Foote is within Ihe personal knowledge of
at least three people "
A School for Barbers.
The Barbers' Association has called the at-
tention of the Labor Commissioner to a matter
of groat interest to men in their calling. A
committee composed of J. K ll tech, 8. Miller, H.
Sohenuert and E. Solomon called upon me
Labor Commissioner ana informed him that
on Eleventh street a man had establi-hed a
school for barbers, where he undertake to
tench the business in eight weeks for $40. The
association believes that there are more poor
workmen in this line in tliis City than the
public can stand and it is the desiroto prevent
any more of that class from getting Into the
business. The Commissioner stated that he.
would look into the matter and see what he
could do in the premises

i investigation of the Foundling Hospital of !
i Sacramento at the requeat.Of the Governor, I
I is, on. file in the executive office..:. The,,
report does riot disclose wretched manage- j
ment by any means; but -the 'inquiry lias
cauÂ» d iiii â improvement: in the manner of :
â conducting the. hospital. The beds were

I Ruggles to remove the evidence of such
infection. â ../:.â .:.
The mortality among children under .
two years of age was iound to be 50 per I
'cent. This is not a ; higher rate, it is said,;
than is shown in similar institutions in- 1
! the East. The infants coming to the in- I
j stitution for shelter." generally suffer from . j
exposure and neglect before they are rer i
ceived, hence they do not pos-ess the
I strength to survive the ailments as chil-
I dren nourished at home would. This in a
measure accounts for the high percentage
of deaths in foundling hospitals.
Thfi report of Dr. Ruggles does not show
'neglect of the foundlings to an extent that !
would cause deatli to follow.
In the matter of supplies some improve
ment in the quality of food purchased may
: be recommended. .
The Foundling Hospital at Sacramento
1 derives some aid from the State under the
provision. relating to half-orphans, but the j
i amount appropriated i* not large. The
I charges touching the management were j
! brought to the attention of tne Statt- Board j
â¢ of Examiners-, and this examination by
Dr. Ruggtes -was. .the result. The doctor i
was selected because as a non-resident of |
Sacramento he would not be subjected to j
! local prejudice or feeling. Governor Budd .j
is confident that he has in his possession a
complete and fair report of the manage
ment of the institution, although he has
not had time to give it thorough consider
ation.
FATALLY INJURED.
A Horrible Accident on the Cars at
bombard and liattery Streets.
Charles Dougherty, a sailor, met with a
: fatal accident last night on Lombard and
Battery streets.
Freightcars were being run along Loin
| bard-street wharf to the steamer Ukiah.
Half of the train had been run along the
' wharf and they had just commenced to
| shove aJong the second half when a cry
I was heard. The cars were instantly
| stopped and Dougherty was found about
the middle of the train with both legs
mangled. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and riiÂ« d in about an hoar.
D. (ioodricli, the yardmaiter, said that
no one saw the accident, but it is supposed
Dougherty had been attempting to cross
i between the cars and had been caught.
NO COMPROMISE FOR IT
Union for Practical Progress
Criticizes the Committee
of Fifty.
REYNOLDS GOES ON RECORD.
Tha Union Wants the Committee to
Draw Up an Absolute Fore
closure Bill.
President John M. Reynolds, of the
Union for Practical Progress, who is also
j a member of the committee of fifty,
i chosen by the mass-meeting of December
! 7, is of the opinion that the committee of
! fifty is not carrying out the purpose for
! which it was appointed. The chief aim
' and work of the committee of fifty, accord
; ing to Mr. Reynolds, were to draw up a
bill and forward it on lo some member of
the California delegation in Congress op
posing the funding of the Pacific roads.
i Mr. Reynolds is an emphatic advocate of
the Government ownership of public utili-
tics, and he believes the present financial
condition of the. Pacific roads affords the
people of the United States an opportunity
to secure actual ownership of these great
highways by mortgage foreclosure, pure
and simple â and foreclosure, and nothing
short of it, is what Mr. Reynolds wants.
There was a meeting of the Union for
Practical Progress last night in Ceres
Hall, at 621 O'Farrell street. There were
not many present, but those that were
went on record with a resolution that be
tween its lines politely informs the com
mittee of fifty that it is not doing what it
ought to do. .:
The resolutions were not agreed to until
thoroughly discussed by F. W. L,ynch, J.
8. Reynolds, F. W. Potter, J. F.'Wetzel,
John M. Reynolds and several others, but
finally they were adopted without a dis
senting voice. They are as follows:
Whereas, 200,000 citizens have petitioned
Congress to enact such measures as will col
lect the debt due the; American people from
the corporations known as the Pacific railroads,
and to hold those men who have become mil
iouaires by robbing those roads responsible
for their acts; and whereas, all petitions and
all resolutions adopted at the many mass-meet
ings held to consider this subject have asked
of Congress .that the Government mortgage on
the Pacific railroads be foreclosed and mat the
roads be bid in oy the Government and oper
ated in the interests of the people; and
whereas, on Saturday, December 7, at a mass
ineeting of citizens of San Francisco the de
mand was repeated by resolutions, regularly
moved and passed, that the Government should
assume control of these roads and operate
tlu-m, and a committee of fifty was provided
for ill those resolutions, and said committee
was instructed by the same to prepare a bill
that was to be submitted txt the people for rati
fication, and then, if indorsed, such bill was to
be forwarded to our representatives at Wa.-h
--ington; and whereas, the committee ot" fifty
has been anointed by Mayor Suiro. who was
chairman of said meeting of December 7. now
be It
Resolved, That the Union for Practical
Pmpress in view of these past events respect
fully demands in the name of the voters who
have expressed their wish that the Govern
ment shall assume control of the Pacific rail
roads, that Congress shall listen to and obey
the voice of its constituents; and
Betolved further. That we again demand in
the name of the people, who have by petition
and resolutions, asked that no funding bills be
passed; that our representatives strenuously
oppose all refunding bills in theinterest of the
Pacific railroads', and
Kf solved further, That we call upon the
committee of fifty to faithfully carry out the
expressed wishes of the mass-meeting of
December 7, and we hereby publicly request
them to piepare a bill providing for the Gov
ernment ownership and operation of the Pa
cific railroads, which have defaulted in re
funding to the Government the loans granted
to them; and we further asK that the bill be
submitted to the citizens of San Francisco at a
mass-meeting within two weeks for their rati
fication or rejection as they have requested by
Jhe resolutions to which Vhat committee owes
its existence ; and
Jteaolved further, That the president of this
society is authorized to appoint a committee of
five to forward these resolutions to our repre
sentatives in Congress, to present this request
to the committee of fifty and, if in their judg
ment it may be expedient aud necessary to
call a mass-meeting of the citizens of San Fran
cisco or a convention of the State, they are
hereby authorized and requested to do so.
The committee of five provided for will
be selected later on. While discussing the
matter Mr. Reynolds made the following
statement of his position last night:
I am determined in my purpose to preserve
and extend, as far as I can, the ability, power
and right to rule of the common people. All
my work in the direction of reform has been
and will be devoted to that end. Xo man is a
good* citizen of a republic who in any way
.stifles the voice of the people or attempts to
do so.
AH our institutions are founded upon the
principle that the wishes of the majority of the
people shall be the law of the land. But such
is not the condition. Our lawmakers and of
ficials have been corrupted by a lot of un
scrupulous men, and the result is that oppress
ive monopolies like the Southern Pacific have
been created by bribery, perjury and robbery.
And now when the common people see this
and when from long experience they have
learned that no release can be had by turning
one set of rascals out and placing another set
in who will be subjected to the i-ame t.nnpta
iions;now thatmore than 200,000 voters have
definitely and decidedly asked that the Gov
ernment take the Central Pacific and other
railroads which are indebted to thepeople.it
is in my opinion a flagrant breach oi trust tor
any committee to advocate a different policy
or 'to demand anything less than what the
people have asked "for.
It is something more, it is a dangerous Unng.
The common people are the only real and true
and lawful rulers of .his Nation. When a com
mittee of our own private citizens refuses or
neglects to properly present the case to our
representatives as the people have demanded
to be done they are not doing what is right, and
it will inevitably lead to trouble.
I am hopeful that the committee of fifty will
be inclined to look at the matter in a public
spirited light, but, if tlie j do not, and if from an
error of judgment or ignorance of theadvant
tape of public ownership or from an .exagger
ated idea of the dangers of attempting to do too
much they neglect to fulfill the duty imposed
upon them, 1 shall say they have not a proper
regard for the will of the common people. I
maintain they have no right to present the
case to Congress in a different light than the
resolutions which were passed prescribed.
I mi determined that the matter sball be car
ried out strictly as the people have demanded â
that is, that a bill shall be formulated provid
ing for the Government ownership and opera-,
tion of these railroads. Then if Congressmen
dare to vote contrary to their constituents,
wishes upon them let the responsibility rest. .
Mr. Reynolds added that now the Union
for Practical Progress had tacen a stand in
opposition to the seemingly compromising
attitude of the committee of fifty it would
keep insisting that the wishes of the mass
meeting be carried out to the very letter.

town demonstration of bidding adieu to
the old and welcoming the new year as
thronged the mile and a half of thorough
fare extending from Jones and Market

In such numbers did. they turn out. that
the ample width of the sidewalks of these
streets were inadequate to accommodate
and there was a considerable overflow
into the street. .' .:;.'. '"â¢ ..;f-' : .-..'C-.= ,'-^ : 'V-'';'V=
The turmoil of the combined efforts of
men, women and children was one long,
and continuous roaring ami shrieking,
clamor from all sizes and styles of horns,,
gongs, rattles and any kind of device that
could be made to create a noise. '. . \
Old age and infancy alike were infected
with the carnival spirit, that was abroad.
Ordinarily sedate young ladies vied with
the most boisterous hoodlum in their; ef
forts to do their share in creating the deaf
ening uproar. This condition of things
began about 10 p. m., and rapidly grew in
intensity and volume until the New Year's
advent was marked by tLe midnight hour,
when it reached its height. '.V
No less than 50.000 people were abroad;
the great outpouring being largely due to
the attractions to our outdoor promenade
created by the beautiful moonlight night.
All manner of pranks were indulged in,
and the victims in ail cases showed the
greatest good nature, nobody dreaming of
resenting what at any other time and any
other occasion would be deemed the great
est impertinence.
A few of the instruments that contrib
uted an ear-splitting chorus were fishhorns
from a few inches in length to six feet or
more, many of them decorated in the most
fantastic manner; conch shells, cavalry
trumpets, drums, big rattles, bagpipes,
hurdygurdies, cow bells, dinner bells,
pongs, frying-pans, oil cans, skillets, grid
irons, tinpans and many indescribable hut
effective rural disturbers. One ambitious
group engaged a wagon, and from a sus
pended sheetof tin contributed generously
to the din. Another vehicle was utilized
for the amus ment of a crowd who labored
industriously on a huge triangle to give
Father Time a damorous send-off.
Up one side of the street the intermin
able procession went and down the other,
unwearying and unremitting in their noisy
efforts. Any attempt at conversation was a
simply impossible.
One of the most notable exhibitions was
large papier-mache horn, about eight feet
long, and with the larger aperture at least
a foot in diameter. This was carried by
four frolicsome young men, each in turn
taking a turn at literally "blowing his
horn."
Another feature was an oil-can brigade,
about twenty strong, headed by a horn
corps.
Even the cyclists were not able to resist
the spirit of revelry that was abroad, and
those who were unprovided with the pe
culiar screeching whistle they use as sig
nals did not disdain to resort to the hum
ble and sonorous horn.
Robert Wieland, instead of his usual
dainty cane, sported a six-foot horn, and
his whereabouts was readily indicated by
the volume of noise he added to that of his
fellow-revelers.
B. J. Hyland, the well-known capitalist,
headed a band of about thirty, fully
equipped with horns.
C. J. Gardner, who was a candidate for
the Assembly on the Populist ticket, was
as noisy as the noisiest.
H. Hermann blew his horn with una
bated vigor during his entire two hours'
promenade, taking occasional respites, of
course, to wet his whistle.
A group of jack-tars from the Philadel
phia displayed t::eir patriotism in keeping
a cornet in pretty steady blast, while a
party of ladies and tfteir escorts had a
merry time with Chinese fiuclles and cym
bals.
At the stroke of midnight the revelers,
with almost one accord, lined up, facing
the street, and then went up a din that
was almost deafening, and which was
augmented by tlie blowing of steam
whistles from the downtown factories.
The Berlin Exposition.
Great progress lias been made lately in
the preparatory work for the Berlin Indus
trial Exposition of 1896. Questions of prin
ciple very important for visitors have been
decided, viz. : The hour of the day until
when the exposition buildings are to be
illuminated and the prica- of admission.
The wishes of the public have been largely
considered in the settlement of the^e ques
tions. The entire exposition erounds, in
cluding all parts devoted to entertainment
as well as the great hall 3of the main
building, will be radiant with light to a
late nour at night and a uniform rate of 50
pfennig will be charged. Only on one day
of the week an admittance fee of 1 mark
will be charged up to 5 o'clock in the after
noon.
As the grounds are of vast extent it was
deemed of great importance to provide for
rapid transit, and so a railway will be built
just inside of the fence surrounding the
grounds, with about ten stations at the
most prominent points.
In short, thousand* ol skillful hands are
busiiy engaged in tlie effort to present on
the Ist of May next an exposition to the
world which will be ready and finished in
allitsparts.

Mayor Sutro called a special meeting of

ensue, and the proper thing to d<> was to
get early into the right, if right it was to
be. The other members of the commis

views, and after a short discussion it was
decided to call upon the assistance of Del

Their Annual Ball.
The annual ball of the K. K. B. Rifles at Odd
Fellows' Hall last niglu was a pronounced suc
cess. There was a very large attendance and all
lied a mo,.t enjoyable evening. There was an
exhibition drill by the Rifles under command
<;f Captain Sheeny. The men presented a
good appearance and their movements, were
cleverly executed.
The largest structure on the eartb, when
compared with the size of the builders, is
the anthill of Africa. â¢ Some of these
mounds have been observed 1& feet high
and 9 feet in diameter. If a human habi
tation were constructed on the same scale
it would be more than seven miles high.
For the healthy a nap in the afternoon
is not necessary, and the brain will not
demand it. If a man finds himself napping
at that time, either he ha* eaten too much
at his miJday meal, or his cerebral circu
lation is feeble.
New silver coinage, of the value of
nearly $750,000, has been sent from the
mi:it"to the Scottish banks, in view of the
deficiency of silver in the North. Th;Â«is
the largest supply of new coins ever intro
duced into Scotland at one time.
The Bank of England has 11G0 officials
on its payroll, which amounts to about
$1,500,000 a year, and 1000 clerks. If a
clerk is late three times he receives a warn
ing, the fourth time he is discharged at
once.

%Fk%QL O a
CONTEST FOR THE GIRLS.
Louise Paille and Edna Hunting
ton Wanted by Two Reform
Institutions.
GENERAL M'COMB IS OPPOSED.
Mrs. French Says That He Should Not
Send the Girls to the Magdalen
Asylum.
Mrs. Rose French of the Hill-street
Home and Training School for Girls, ap
pears determined to get two new board
ers for her establishment. She expresses a
conviction that the 17-year-old damsels,
Louise Faille and Edna Huntmgton, now
detained at the City Prison on various
charges, are not bad enough to be sent to
the Magdalen Asylum, and should he taken
to the place over which she and her associ
ates preside.
"We have ten girls at the home at
present," said Mr.-. French last night, "and
all seem happy and ut ease. The Magdalen
Asylum is i.ottue place for a girl who is not
thoroughly bad. There, I understand, all
the girls are thrown together, and all ef
forts for their reformation are rendered
fruitless-by the corrupting influence of the
older und more degraded girls upon those
less versed in the ways of evil. Now,
tnese two girls do not seem to be altogether
bad, and our home is just the place for
them.
'The Hill-street institution is eminently
and distinctively Protestant, while the
Magdalen Asylum is just as; thoroughly
Catholic. I know of a case in which a girl
was committed to the latter institution on
a Friday and was baptized and received
into the Catholic church on the Monday
following. Tne gin was a little wayward,
but not really bad, and her sudden step
was a great shock to her relatives. In our
home no such work is carried on.
â 'We have no Slate or City aid as the
Magdalen Asylum has, hence we cannot
make a showing on paper approaching in
voluniiuousness the reports of the estab
lishment, but we can say one thing at
least, and that is our tirls u:o not come out
of the home worse in morals and more cor
rupt in mind than when they entered. I
repeat, the Magdalen Asylum is no place
for those girls, and I shall do what 1 can
to hinder their going there."
Mrs. French was ably seconded in her
remarks by a Mrs. Oldman, who is also
connected with the Hill-street institution.
The two women were in the conidoT of
the City Prison, whither they had gone
to visit their possible wards. Mrs. Old
man, it will be; remembered, was promi
nent in the a ivement lor the prosecution
of the old men accused of immomi con
duct toward little girls at North Ueach.
Secretary McComb of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children takes a
different view of the mutter. He seems to
consider the Magdalen Asylum by all
means the best available place for girls
who have fallen into evil ways or are in
danger.
"The thing most in favor of the Magda
len Asylum," he said, 'is, in my judg
ment, the well-ordered and systematic
method employed in the preservation and
reformation of its inmates. Day and
night the inmates are under unremitting
vigilance. In the dormitories a separate
monitor has charge of two beds, being in

do not believe that in any other local female
reformatory are any such measures of
vigilance and correction observe i. In the
liili-street place, for example, the girls are
allowed to go out, and I know of cases
where they have omitted the formality of
returning." Now in the Magdalen Asylum
the inmates are detained. I know of only
two escapes from that institution.
"One was rather interesting. The girl
looked a mere child, bat waa old in wick
edness. She boasted that she had escaped
from all other places of detention in which
she had been confined, and their name
was legion. Accordingly 1 warned the
sister In whose department the girl was to
remain, and extraordinary precautions
were adopted to prevent her escape. Es
cape she did, however, and to this day no
one knows how.
"I am willing to express my sincere
opinion that the Magdalen Asylum is the
place where those two girls should go, and
I hope ttiey will be sent there, for if there
is any chance of tht^r reformation it is
there that they will {j-i t i tie best show. 1 '
Meanwhile the two lanes arc in durance.
speculating upon the outcome of the pro
ceedings in which they are so intimately
concerned. They are sullen and unooin
inunicative when addressed in reference to
the affair, and refuse to express any pref
erence regarding the place to which tuev
may by remitted. The Paille girl is of
French origin and seems rather bright, but,
like her companion, she refuses to discuss
her uifaira with any one so far as known,
lioth, it is expected, will be sentenced by
Judge Conlan to-morrow.

( AGO, 111, Dec. M.â lt was just such a
day's business In wheat and other speculative arti
cles as every one expected for the closing up of the
year. N.i.licr buyers nor sellers could boast of
having gained any particular advantage, although
the o;;r'y rÂ« .â¢â  <â ! prices was below the close of
y-ester.la.r. The hulk of the light trading repre
Â«en Â«xl the winding up of old business and very lit
tlÂ»- i.evv >vas rausacted. even by the scalpers. The
he -sio:i closf-d h. full hour before lhÂ« usual time to
I- nun ihtfcasrylngoui of a programme Of enter
tH'.rimcnt tor the members. Liverpool cables were
quiet lid (inn. North crn arrivals were 4</8
cars, sgatnsi 259 on the corresponding day a year
11. <â  Cliica?o received 15f2 < ars and inspected out
* 67.971 . bushels. Kxport clearances at Atlantic
jior:s<were li.ree at 6 -3.1 -7 bushels, the major por
tion of which was slipped by Ne'v York.
1 he world's shipcmms.lasi week, as compiled by
the Board 01 Trade, aggregated 5 752. u00 bushels.
I Ne\vÂ°York estimated them at h.000.000 bushels.
1 1. the last'half hour the tone e.\mt>ited consider
iible - reusnli. reports of gold returning to this
country and of an arrangement by the President
, lot a $50,000-,000 cold loan imparting eiitourug';
ment Uradstreet's report, which arrived after the
close, showed a decrease of 7,000.000 bushels in
the world's available supply. May wheat opened
from 59S' 8 c i 0.59y B e, sold between 59c and HOc,
Closing at 59% c, 14@%C higher than yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow fc'O cars. .
CORNâ Was dull, the holiday, spirit anddisin
cluation to do business resul ing in an extremely un
interesting Imif session. The opening was easier
on larger receipts than expected (540 cars') and in
sympathy with wheat, a rally took place later,
after which a quiet and steady feeling existed.
There were no withdrawals from store. Liverpool
cables were i,4d lower. Export clearances amount
ed to 586.1b5 bushels. Bradatreet's reported an
increase of f>43,0'.)0 bushels in." available*: stocks.
May corn opened at 28' .Â«<â¢. sold .between 28c an
d 28Vs(Â§Â»2tjyic, closing at the outside, unchanged
from yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
176 cars.
OATSâ Were steady, nothing different from the
general apathy was noted. Prices changed but lit
tle, and the tone was governed by the larger mar
kets. Receipts were 335 cars, and 2H.000 bushe.ls
were taken ironi store. I'.rurisirees reported an
Increase of 626,000 bushels in stocks. May oats
dosed a shade higher than yesterday. Estimated

. . : THK COAL TRADE.
The Year 1895 Distinguished by Its
1 -â¢ . . Cheap Fuel.
The annual circular of I. Steuart gives the re
ceipts of Coal at San Francisco during 1895 at
1,1115,200 tons, against 1,339,100 tons in 1894 and
1,287,100 tons in 1893. Prices ranged as follows:
Australian (cargo lots), $4 76@6 80; Great Britain,
I $4'Bo@t> 25. These were considerably below ihe
I range in 1894. The circular says:
I . |-Du ring the year now ended the people of the
J| State may be congratulated upon having had the
I advantage of cheaper fuel than ever before known
: in the history of the state. The best qualities of j
coal have been imported from Australia and Knit
t land and sold at the lowest figures on record. This,
Of course, 10 the heavier industries of the State
(wnich are the largest employers of labor and
whose existence -depends upon imported fuel), has
. ben a great boon, and has. helped them compete :
and market their products' against 'heir Eastern !
competitors, who are fortunate in having suitable
un'taxed fuel almost at their doors, and at nominal
prices compared to the charges our heavies; manu
facturers are forced to pay for suitable fuel.
. "The State in importing foreign coal derives a
two-fold benefit. '1 lie farmer, ' without coal ships
r coming to this port, would be compelled to pay-
I double if not greater freight rates to transport bin
; I wheut to a foreign market, which at present is the |
1 only one open to him. It is therefore clearly- the ;
j interest, of the farmer to encourage In every possi- I
. ble wav shipping to come to this port, thus aiding
I himself and the heaviest class of manufacturers, i
I who are forced to depend upon imported fuel until j
a superior coal to that now known Is discovered
: somewhere on the Pacific Coast. There is also 1111
--other.pleaiing feature to note in the coal trade of
! the y> ar. and turn Is the increased consumption, â 
which is good evidence of healthful actlvliy :

WOOI IKAIJIS IX 1895.
The annual circular of George Abbott gives the j
crop of Wool In California in 1895 at 35,856.690 lbs,
j against 36,068,400 11. in 1894. This year's crop,
j except that of 1894, was the largest since 18b6.

j follows: Spring clip, 24,018,110 lbs: fall clip, i
I 10.080,580 lbs; pulled Wool, 1, 758,000 lbs. The

HER LIFE OF ROMANCE
An Oakland Belle the Wife of a
Millionaire Merchant of
London.
DESIRED TO BE A WIDOW.
She Will Soon Visit California to
Attend to Her Property
Interests.
Oakland Office Pax Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Dec. SL )
Within a few weeks Miss Frankie
Brown of this city, now the wife of a Greek
millionaire cizarette merchant of London,
will visit Oakland to look after her prop
erty interests.
Few people have enjoyed so romantic or ;
so fortunate a history as Miss Frank ie
Brown. Miss Brown's father was a pio
neer who lived on Telegraph avenue and
at his death she inherited about $100,000.
Miss Brown became possessed of the idea
-MISS FRANKIF. BROWN OF OAKLAND, WHO IS NOW THE WIFE OF A
GREEK MILLIONAIRE CIGARETTE . MAKES OF LONDON.
[From a photograph.]
that she would like to travel on the conti
nent of Europe. One of her notions was
that a female would be subjected to
curiosity and criticism wnile traveling
abroad if she were a widow. This idea was
communicated to Richard Apgar, who at
that time wr.s bailiff of San Francisco
Court 2, and through his influence she was
married to a print* r named McKee, whose
death was shortly expected, as he was a
victim of consumption. On the very day
of their marriage Mrs. McKee refused to
live with her husband.
Her figure and the lavish manner in
which she entertained made her promi
nent in Paris, London and Algiers". But
while she spent money freely she also
made lucky investments that yielded
handsome returns, she was credited with
being worth a million dollars, and a story
came over the wires from Paris that her
band was sought in marriage by a wealthy
French Duke, who had been deceived into
an offer of marriage by the widow's w^eds
which the bright Californienne wore. She
opened the Duke's oyes to her true stand
ing as a married woman, whose busband
was yet Hvintr, and he promised that if sbe
would come to Oakland and get a divorce
he would marry her.
A few weeks later Mrs. McKee returned
to Oakland and was at the deathbed of her
husband. She was greatly affected when
the last hour c.tme and expressed much
regret that she had acted in such a ro
mantic manner. She provided a costly
funeral, but after it was over the sensa
tion-loving young willow made several
heart conquests on both sides of the bay
and Beemed to take great delight in .le-
Pt roving the pence of mind of everybody
whom she could influence.
As sne was an expert banjo, violin and
piano player, and was possessed of a rk-h
soprano voice, her friends tried to induce
her to go upon tbe sta&e, but she refused
and declined all kinds of theatrical offers.
Several theatrical speculators ir'md to jjei

to run any such risk of financial ruin.
About this time she met Arthur Brans

agreed t<> marry him. He was forced to
hurry off to Chicago to keep an engage
ment, and a few days later the widow fol
lowed, intending !u wed the young actor.
While en route she learned that he had a

on the journey to Europe.

FUSILLADE BY MOONLIGHT
A Sunol Hotel Man Makes a
Wild Attack on a Chinese
Hut.
He Was Refused Opium, so He Went
for His Shotgun and Shot a
Chinaman.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call, )
Â»08 Broadway, Dec. 31. |Â
Thomas Ward, proprietor of the Sunol
Hotel, wantonly fired seventeen charges of
buckshot into a Chinese hut early this
morning, and it is yet likely that he may
have to answer a charge of murder.
About midnight, Ward, who had been
drinking heavily of late, went to the house
of the Chinese and asked for opium, but
was refused. ; This angered him, and he
demanded the drug, but with no success,
and he then returned to his hotel:
About 1 o'clock this morning Ward took
his shotirun, loaded up with cartridges and
advanced oa the Chinese washhouse, which
is situated almost in the heart of town. The
four Chinese who lived there had retired,
but a light was burning.
Ward walked till he was about ten yards
from the frail hut and opened fire. He
fired as rapidly as he 'could discharge and
reload. The noise awoke the inmates, and
one of them went to extinguish the candle
that burned in the window.
This act of precaution may cost him his
life. He received a charge of shot in the
abdomen. As the shooting continued tiie
Chinese screamed in terror like so many
rats in a trap. They dared not to leave
the place as the moon was shininjc
brightly, and to expose themselves meant
certain death. They had nothing with
which to return the fire, so tiiey huddled
together in one corner of the shack, ex
pecting that each succeeding shot might
reach them. When the shooting ceased
the Chinese ran out, and the inhabitants,
who had been attracted by the shooting,
looked for a Constable to arrest Ward,
who had rushed back to his hotel. The
local Constable was not in town, so one
of the bombarded Chinese started on a run
for Pleasanton, which is six niile9 away.
He made the distance in an hour, and re
turned with Marshal Donnelly and Con
stable Lester.
Ward had locked himself up, but he
finally consented to surrender if Charles
Hadeil would accompany him to Pleas
anton and arrange for his bond. This was
agreed to and "\\ ard was locked up. His
bonds were afterward fixed at $25,000.
An inspection of the Chinese hut by ex
pert shooters showed that not less
than seventeen shots had been tired by
Ward. The residents of Snnol say it was
the moat cowardly attack on unarmed
men ot which they had ever heard.
Ward was brought to the County Jail
to-night and charged with assault to mnr
der. It is not yet certain that the Chinese,
whose name is Wing Hop, will not die.
THINKS HE IS BOYCOTTED
Judge Swasey's Complaint About
the City Oificers of
Alameda.
The Municipal Board Determined to
Make Important Street
Extensions.
A.LAMEDA, Cai.., Dec. 31.â Justice of
i the Peace Swasey has a standing com
plaint, which he periodically makes
known to the authorities. He is a town
: ship ofheer, co-ordinate in power with an
other Justice and with a Recorder, elected
|as a municipal officer. He has the author
ity to try petty offenders against city or
dinances, as well as against general Taws,
and, as his emoluments come in the way
of ices, it makes a difference how much
business he gets. His complaint is that
the two constables and the entire colice
| force divert all the business from his
' court to that of the other Justice. The
I fees of the other Justice in eleven months
i have been $771, wbi1Â« those of Swasey have
[ been but $237. There is no law by which a
constable or police ollicer is required to
[ swear to his complaints before one magis
; trate instead of another, but the board was
; impressed with Bwasey's complaint sulli
; ciently to order an investigation of the al-
I legations.
Shooting on th<> Marsh.
A I -A.MKDA, Cal., Dec. 31.â The Munic
ipal Board supposed it was doing exactly
what the resident? of Bay Farm Island
wanted when it caused to be prepared an
ordinance prohibiting the discharge of
firearms In thai portion of the city which
had heretofore befn exempt. There was
SOmethins of a surprise, therefore, when
on the eve of the enactment thereof there
appeared a Bay Farm Islander who ob
jected to the law. Tie represented that
such a law would be a hariship on the
islanders themselves, aa it would prevent
them shooting game for their own use on
their own land. The objection did not
prevail, however, as the complaints of reck
less shooting on the Bay Farm marshes
are of years' standing and the board had
iully determined to put a stop to it.
Extension of Streets.
ALAMEDA, Cm.., Dec. 31.-The West
End, or western portion of Alameda, has
nut progressed anil improved in the same
ratio as the remainder of the city The
reason for this is believed to be that so
many large tracts are owned there that the
building of houses is discouraged and re
pressed thereby. Lately the Municipal
Trustees have taken up the subiect of
opening streets through some of" these
tracts, and have succeeded. They now
propose to open other streets, and "to gel
that section of the city as thoroughly sub
divided as any other.

MANY NOTED EDUCATORS
They Will Attend the State
Teachers' Association in
Oakland.
WOMEN TO BE PROMINENT.
New Year's Day Will Be Given Up to
Receptions, Reunions and Or
ganization.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 31. f
The State Teachers' Association will
meet in this city to-morrow and continue
in session over Saturday New Year's day
will be spent in reunions and receptions.
The Alumni Association of the San Jose
State Normal School will hold a reception
from 3 to 5 p. m. at their headquarters, at
the Crellin Hotel, and all visiting teachers
and friends are cordially invited. In the
evening at the same place a joint social
reunion of the Chico, Los Angeles and
San Jose StaU Normal schools will be
held, and teachers and their friends will
be welcome.
A banquet will be given at the Metro
pole to-morrow to the alumni of the Uni
versity of California who are active
teachers.
Though some Eastern politicians have
been accused of forgetting that California
is on the map, the educational men of the
Nation know that the State is here. There
are some schoolmen who would be a
credit in any country, and who are in some
cases the envy of the Atlantic side. Le
Conte, Howison, Jordan are names that
rise first in the public mind, perhaps, but
there is Stringham of Berkeley, who fig
ures more than he talks, who is a Euro
pean authority on mathematics. There is
Sanford of Stanford, prophesied as a
leader in science in 1900. There are Hud
son and Gayley, equal in critical acumen
to the finest essayists in their especial
lines.
In pedagogy Earl Barnes, Elmer Brown
and P. B. Dresslar are reckoned leaders in
the United States. C. H. Keyes of Pasa
dena is known in the South as a man of
affairs and the president of a polytechnic
school that ranks with that of Troy or St.
Lonis. P. W. Search, editor of the Ad
vance in Education and the apostle of in
dividualism in education, aroused the
whole educational world a year or two ago
by his revolutionary doctrines.
Then there is W.H.V. Raymond, an all
asound schoolman, with just the finalities
that mark the editor of a great daily.
Again, there are C. W. Cbilds, E. T. Pierce
and R. P. Pennell, each at the head of a
preat normal school, stamping his individ
uality upon scores of teachers and through
these upon hundreds of pupils ud and
down the Stale.
Among the women teachers are MiÂ«s
Lucy Wash barn, one of the best trained
women in California, who might write sev
eral groups of letters after her name if she
would; Mrs. Mary Sheldon Barnes of Stan
ford, who has written the best general his
tory we have; Miss Elizabeth Packard, one
of ti.e tinest organizers on the coast; Miss
Jean Parker, whose name in San Francisco
is a household word for wisdom and
strength, and many another.
All of these and some hundreds of other
educators are to meet in this city to dis
cuss ways ami means to increase profes
sional usefulness. This wiil be the twenty
ninth annual meeting of the California
Teachers' Association, which every year
prows more earnest In efforts to reach the
highest standard.
Last year the association, meeting at
Santa Cruz, discussed the teaching force
and its preparation, the curriculum of the
.schools and the dilliculties in the way of
employing tne ideal teachers and applying
the ideal curriculum.
President Kleeberger's plea for educa
tion that will give ability to discover
knowledge, to appreciate knowledge, to
use know. edge for the world's progress *nd
for the understanding of ones own ruhi
tion to the resr of the universe was the
keynote of the discussion, which will sound
again this year.
The mornings of the sessions will be
given to reports of standing committees
appointed last year. The Council of Exu
dationâthe highest body in the State â will,
through its committee, occupy Thursday
morning, dealing with the correlation of
studies.
The manual training schools of the State
will be heard from on Friday morning,
and an exhibit of work will be a feature.
The committee on hygiene will occupy
Saturday morning in exploiting the bett
health conditions availabie in California.
The afternoon sessions will, no doubt,
attract a large concourse of laymen also to
the Congregational churca. The psycho
logical side of educational matters will be
the predominant theme. The great enthu
siasm manifested all over tne country in
studying the child himself in the same in
telligent way that bees and ants have been
studied by naturalists is awakening all
thinking people to a great, region of hith
erto unexplored knowledge. The old dog
mas of education are being swept aside
under the discoveries of the new searcu
lights.
The questions: What do we want the
child to become? What is the nature of
the material we have to work upon?
What is the effect of different studies on
the mind? These are the problems that
psychology is pondering over to-day and
which California may study with the
Teachers' Association at Oakland.
The morning nession of the convention
will be heid in th-j High School building
and the afternoon and evening sessions in
the First Congregational churchy
BARNES TALKS.
The Stanford Professor Speaks of the Im
portance of the Meeting.
Professor Earl Barnes of Stanford Uni
versity, president of the California Teach
ers' Association, is at the Grand in San
Francisco.
The professor says the twenty-ninth an
nual meeting of the association, which will
convene in Oakland at 9:30 to-morrow
morning, will be a very important one.
He expects from 700 to 1000 teachers from
different parts of the State. Papers will be
read and discussed by representative
teachers.
"Kvery phase of modern educational
theory and nractice is represented in the
programme laid out for Thursday, FrUay
and Saturday," said Professor Barnes,
"and the social side is not forgotten. There
will be a promenade concert in the High
School building Thursday evening, with
normal and high-school receptions in the
hotels and in private houses all through
the three days.
"Nowhere in the world is the convention
spirit so highly developed as in America,
and among no class is it more highly de
veloped than among the teachers. The
great national associations in the 3iimmer
have from ten to fifteen thousand attend
ants, and the associations of Southern
California last sprint: had a thousand
teachers in attendance for three days. The
great value of these meetings is undoubt
edly to be found in their social side. In
the hotels and lobbies and assembly halls
Siskiyou jo-itles San Diego, and as the
teachers listen to addresses of representa
tive men concerning t jeir common work,
there rises in their hearts a consciousness
of their strength and solidarity, and they
co back home to a year's work backed by
the consciousness "that in their often iso
lated lives they are representing the great
commonwealth of California and that they
are part of the advance guard of higher
civilation. We live by our beliefs, and it
is well to have a realizing sense of the
strength ana power that is in us.
"But the knowledge gained is itself well
worth the efforts and the money expended.
Representative teachers will carry back to
all the schools in California the" ideas of
the revered Joseph Le Conte on the effects
of the theory of evolution on education.
The foremost experimental psychologists
in the Stateâ Bailey of the University of
California, DresslaV of Los Angeles and
Smith of San Joseâ will give their latest
and best thought on lines of educational
work which they are prosecuting. The
best men and women in the State will
spend one morning discussing the physical
conditions of school life, using' the
splendid new school buildincs of Oakland
as an object-lesson. Another morning
will be given up to the problem of manual
traiuing."

MIDNIGHT AT ST. LUKE'S
Solemn Service Held in the
Episcopal Church on Van
Ness Avenue.
Rev. William H. Moreland, the Pastor,
Addresses the Congregation on
Timely Themes.
A midnight service of solemn character
was held last night at St. Luke's Episcopal
Church on Van Ness avenue and Clay
street, which, as the Rev. William H.
Moreland, the pastor, explained, was in
tended to accentuate the significance of
the passing of time. The church was
comfortably filled, and it was evident that
all present entered into the spirit of the
occasion with a just understanding of its
solemnity and importance.
At about 11:20 the service began with a
full vested choir of boys and men singing
hymns appropriate to the season. Such
hymns as "A Few More Years Shall Roll,"
"Alive With Me" and "Fast Fulls the
Eventide" wore given. Mr. Moreland de
livered an address a few minutes before
midnight, and at live minutes to that hour
bade the congregation to kneel in silent
prayer, urging penitence for failures and
shortcomings of the past year, and a re
newed consecration to the service of God.
He said:
We are assembled, my friends, to watch â  the
dying of the old year and the birth of the new.
It is a solemn hour. The passage from one
year to the next is in some sense like the
entrance of the soul of man from this world to
the next. The book of 1895' crowded with the
experiences of the past, is about to close for
ever, and its record is before God, finished now,
and never to be recalled. Not one of. you
present before me bin received from the new
year, which you welcomed twelve months ago,
opportunities -of improvement and of happi
ness. To every one of you God has offered day
by day gift after gift; on each he has again
and again pressed his forgiving love, his
abounding grace, inspiring you to higher,
nobler living; to each he nas sought to reveal
himselt in numberless ways. Think of the
voices that have spoken to youâ the voices of
children calling you to a life of purity and
love, the dear voices in your own lamily, the
tender warnings of mother or wife or husband'
or friend, voices that perhaps to-night whisper
to you from a grave or from loved ones far
awayâ all have been the voices of God to your
conscience, drawing you to.a life of goodness,
holiness and love. . â¢â 
Do you not feel guilty as you look back upon
what you might have been? Have we not all
more or less neglected these opportunities of
walking close to God? Oh, if there oe one
among you who has altogether scorned his
proffered love. haÂ» rejected his continual reve
lation of himself or has been blinded to all his
mercies, let him now, in these last momenta of
the year, while we are gathered to seize a
blessing from its departing sands, let him fall
on his knees bÂ»fore God, and among his people,
penitent for opportunities never to return,
and confess his failure. It is not too late even
now, before the old year is dead, to gather
from it the rich blessing with which God
charged it generously when he sent it on its
mission a twelvemonth ago. Penitent for past
failures, let us all even now consecrate our
souls to God for th* past and for the future.
When we kneel m silent prayer, as we shall do
in a few moments, before midnight strikes, let
each of you spend these departing moments in
deep repentance and earnest faith, saying to
the old year, "1 will not let thee go except thou
bless me." So will you sain even at the elev
enth hour the blessing God is bending over you
and waits to give.
Standing now between the old year and the
new, can we not hear them as they are crying
aloud to one another? Listen to their voices.
The old year is saying to the new, '-Take this
child of God and give him more of life. Show
him greater things than 1 could show him. He
has a weak and humble spirit and bewails the
mistakes and losses of the past. Now you open
to him. the richer, fuller life of the year to
come." " ' â 
And the new year answers to the old: "I
will take him and lead him into new experi
ences such as he expects not, as he sits here
dreaming. I may lead him into valleys of sor
row or.to shining peaks of joy. But every dis
pensation will be lull of Jesus Christ coming to
enrich his life. Every experience maybe to
him a blessing and a glory, however sorrowful,
if he receives it as a gift from the hand of
God." ' -
Oh, my friends, the old year is slipping from
us. We cannot stay in it if we would. Let us
go out of it nobly, acknowledge our failure,
redeeming the past by going forth to greater
deeds, more consecrated life. I
Think of Jesus Christ waiting to receive you
on the steps of the new year. Go forthwith
bravery and hope and give yourself to him.
After 12 p. M. the preacher said:
I extend to you, beloved, the greetings of the
new yoar, welcoming you to itn new experi
ences and responsibilities. Whether vonr fed
are to lie led into the furnaces of affliction
or into tne feasting roo:us of life, it will be a
happy yesr if you carry in your souls the abid
ing presence of the Almighty Helper. Every
moment of this new year may be precious,
every incident bring fresh revelation oi God, if
only ttie loving eon.secrntion is genuine, if the
sacred dedication of the soul to Uod in these
jirst moments of the now year is carried into
its most trivial momeuts. God be with you
and bless you In 180 G.
After the discourse the choir sang as a
recessional hymn, "Awake, My Soul,
Stretch Every Nerve," and the service was
at an end.

STEELHEADS ARE WANTED
A Merchant Who Has Sent
Orders to Duncans Mills
for Fish.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Will Now
Arrest All Persons Found Sein
ing the River.
The decision as rendered by Judge Low
on Monday last dismissing the charge of
exposing for sale steelhead trout out of
season, and which was placed against A.
Paladini by Fish Commissioner Bubcock,
has given the merchants some grounds
upon which to pursue a vocation which
will eventually rid the const rivers and
streams of their anadromous fishes,
namely, the steelhead troutâ that is, it the
catching of the^e fishes for marketable
purposes by the use of nets is resumed.
The Commissioners will certainly uppeal
the case to a higher court, as the question
of whether a steelnead is a salmon or a
trout is of particular interest to many
people.
Professor David Starr Jordan of the Stan
ford University is an acknowledged
authority on the classification of fresh
and salt water tishes. He is looked to in
the same light as an authority on
piscatorial questions by the American
people as is Blackstone and other famous
authorities on matters that pertain to the
treneral law of the country when knotty
questions are involved. Consequently the
surprise is all the more great at the "deci
sion as rendered by his Honor Judge Low,
after having read the opinion of tne d is
tinguished professor, which was clear and
beyond any possible doubt as to what the
steelhead really is.
Professor Jordan stated that the steel
head was a species of the trout family,
but the Judge nevertheless dismissed the
case because the definition did not appear
particularly clear to him.
The result of the dismissal of the case is
that A. Paladini has telegraphed to fish
ermen in different parts of the country
where the steelhead may be taken, to ship
to him all the fish of that variety they can
catch. As the Russian River has been
one of the principal fishing waters of fish
ermen who use nets, the fish merchant is
in hopes of receiving large consignments of
steelbeads from Duncans Mills, which is
the principal shipping point on the river.
The Fish Commissioners, however, have
sent to their deputies, now located at
Duncans Mills, instructions to arrest all
fishermen found in the act of seining the
river and to confiscate every net found in
their possession while illegally fishing.
The Commissioners contend that the dis
missal of the case by Judge Low does not
prove that the steelhead is a salmon. Two
years ago, when the net fishermen of the
Russian River were arrested for trans
gressing the law, their cases were heard in
Santa Rosa, and the Judge of the County
Court decided against the fishermen be
cause of a decision rendered by Professor
Jordan, the leading American autnority on
questions of this kind.
It is presumed that in case the fishermen
attempt to catch steelheads in the Russian
River with nets, arrests will follow and a
second trial will be held at Santa Rosa,
which is the county seat of Sonoma.
CANNED GOODS BURNED.
A Fire in the Overland Warehouse
Causes a Loss of Several Thou
sand Dollars.
A tire in the Overland warehouse, at the
corner of Third and King streets, yester
day damaged a lot of canned goods owned
by the California Canneries Company to
the extent of about $3000. Tho loss on tfeft
building, owned by G. Newlands & L' v > ,
will not exceed $300. When the report oi
the fire came in several deputies of the
Internal Revenue office hastened down
thinkine that the fire was in the Overland
bonded warehouse, which is in the ham*;
building and where is stored over a quarter
of a million dollars' worth of liquor.
The alarm was turned in at about 12:30
and Engine Company .">j responded and
soon had the lire under control. It was
supposed to have originated in a work
man's coat from a hot pipe placed in the
pocket. 'Che loss is covered by insurance.
Upset the Lamp.
Mrs. Foster, 112 First street, drank too much
liquor last night and while in her room,
knocked over a lamp. Her screams brought
her assistance. She was found on the floor
with her clothing on tire. The flames weie
exttngaisbed'and she wa* taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital. She was badly turned about tha
arms, neck and back, but not dangerously.

uo You Use IF
A Battery? 3"
AN ELECTRIC BATTERY, BY THE
exercise of much patience, you spend
fifteen or twenty minutes in its application
daily. You get good results from it, ol
course; but the time 9pent, the inconveni-
ence, the jarring, jolting sensations it gives
your nerves, unpleasant, and not always
satisfactory. The battery sometimes
causes injury.
THIS IS WHY
It is like trying to force a big foot into a
small shoe â sometimes it will go, but it
hurts the shoe, and the foot. The shock
from the battery jars the nerves and the
cood it does is in the shaking up you get,
not that you absorb any strength, for you
don't. 'â '-; :.â :'
DR. SANDEN'S
ELECTRIC BELT
DOES what the battery aims to do; it
soaks strength into the weakened nerves.
There is no shock, only a steady, even cur-
rent. You feel it all the time, and it givei
you Electricity slowly for hours at a time,
as you wear.it while you sleep. You ab-
sorb this current and it stays in the body.
IT CURES
All nervous or chronic weakness, kidney
trouble, torpid liver, weak stomach, lama

There are many American sculptors, trtie wor

In reply to this letter Mr. Bundschu set
forth what be considered strong reasons
for the action of the Monument Associa
tion as follows:
San Fiianci.Â«c o, Dec. 23, 1895.
Jajncs D. Phelan,. Esq. â DEA.B Sir.: Your
favor of the Ttli Inst. came to band. Please ae
Â«â â â :Â»t sincere acknowledgment for the interest
you manifest in our undertaking. Truly it is not
my intention to refute the reasonable and well
meant arguments advanced by you as ehani
of hoMie art and original production.
Neverthele us under the existing circumstances
I .niniint fully admit the force ot your allega
tions.
The committee is bound to apply the funds
. thus far collected to the erection of a copy of
the Rietschel sta'uc. "In view of the fact"
that the funds for this primary condition are
inadequate you counsel a more econouric mon
â  to be made by a California artist and
from California material. From your point of
view this proposition may appear quite ac
ceptable, but I am convinced that the altera
tion therein involved would not be to the taste
of the originators of our undertaking, and
would !h- mci by tneir energetic protests.
Not hing less will satisfy them than a statue of
b< roic Bice.
Now we sire fully aware of the cost of original
works c; sculpture in California. The monu
ments of K. y and of Lick have swallowed
immense. sum's; even the modest wnitcnietal
statue tor the dome of otur City Hall Dronrtses
to be v very expensive matter. Ii would be
>U8 w-cre we to 'attempt, with the modest
sum of $10,000, to erect a monument whiett

THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY I, 1896.
nient'.' Whatever this conception may be lack
ing in strength of argument is amply compen
sated by considerations sentimental in their
nature.
A copy of this kind could not be b target for
your criticism, which deems it infra dig "to
appropriate other people's ideas," for it will
always be looked upon as the Rietschel monu
ment. Though this monument is fifty years
old, that does not detract from it unless we
place art on a level with mechanical voca
tions, which, as may oe conceded, are expected
to progress from time to lime. But even our
tin de siecle culture does not dare, in matters
of art and literature, to deny the superiority of
former centuries.
If individuality were under all circum
stances of greater merit than a "copy it
would involve a preference for that "gawty
extravagance" standing in front of Lincoln
School, intended to represent our (nunorta]
martyr President, toacopj of one of the sub
limest works oi Grecian or Roman sculpture.
WÂ« have, doubtless, domestic artists compe
tent to make a good statue, especially if ample
funds are placed at their disposal. Their work
will have the distinction to t c "original," and to
lie expressive of the spirit, the art-culture and
resources of California. It is a peculiar fnct,
however, tnat here in San Francisco we often
come across "original" works of artwhicb nave
been made in foreign countries, from foreign
material and by foreign artists.
I here may be weighty reasons for this, but
the layman is justified in being skeptical and
in drawing the inference that certain classes o_f
art creations here are not as well developed as
in older centers of art, otherwise our domestic
artists would not be compelled to go abroad
for the purpose of cither beginning their work
there or putting the finishing touches upon it.
The higher conception of art makes it inter
national and universal. We may stand by our
home industries and purchase none but home
made shoes and brooms, but art and literature
occupy a higher level. This remark 1 make
because I have not been able to shake* off a feel
ing of indignation, which came over me on
reading an article contributed by one of our
local artists; to one of our dailies, a few weeks
ago, wherein he makes the attempt to lower
iii t to the level of a "trades union" and manu
facturers' association.
I need not assure you that this controversy
will not be influenced by prejudice or personal
feeling on my part; the' unpleasant feature- In
this matter has not been railed forth by you,
but by certain influences emanating from out
siders. Your serious endeavor to promote
California art and culture deserve recognition
and encouragement. I have given you here

of your letter as a final termination of. this
discussion. So. tar as the Art Association is
concerned I have undertaken this discussion
of this question less reluctantly because I con
sider that the subject-matter involved is not at
all a private undertaking. The money for this
undertaking was raised by means of a public

1 considered it one of the duties of the Art
Association 10 interest itself in art matters
generally and particularly in the exhibition
of works of art in public places. My brief ar
gument was made mainly from an artistic
point of view, as you have seen, and as you
view this matter in a different light, that is to
say, you intend merely to honor the poets in
your own way, therefore it would be difficult
for us to enter upon common ground without
going into further details, I i:ickse herewith
an article which I have written for the Christ
mas News Letter, which briefly treats of the
matter in question. 1 quite agree with you
that art knows no ege or country and 1 would
consider it narrow-minded and bigoted to ex
clude any work of art from a public park on
tneground that it is the work of a foreign artist.
The Art Association, gladly welcomes the
work of a foreign master. â¢ If it were to order
the creation of a work of art, it would on
merely patriotic grounds give the preference
to a competent American artist, for there are
American artists who are fully. a- capable as
those of any other country... Our objection to
the Rietschel monument .is not directed,
against the work of art, but to the proposition
that the acceptance of a duplicate of H would
belittle and deny oii; claim: to artistic skill,
and we assert thai 8 copy of such is worthless.
You cull it replica, 1 beg to Call your atten

VAN GUELPEN'S STEAL.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of the De
faulting Treasurer of tiio Oigar
niukers' Union.
President T. P. Burns of the Cigar
makers' Union appeared in Judge Joa
cbiinsen'fl court yesterday and swore out a
warrant for the arrest of Georpe W. Van
Guelpen on the charge of embezzling $800
of the funds of the union.
Van Guelpen was for years the secretary
and treasurer of the union, and iniplici't
confidence was placed in him by the otii
cers and members.
On September 12 his disappeared from
the City, and an examination of his books
showed that he wits a defaulter to the ex
tent of between sHuÂ© and $1100. The union
at a subsequent meeting agreed to pay an
assessment per month till the amount of
the treasurer's defalcations was liquidated
so that the funds of the union would not
be depleted.
The probability is that Van Guelpe.n has
rptuined to the City, hence the warrant for
bis arrest.
CONCORDIA CLUB BALL
Brilliant New Year Event En
joyed by Fashionable Jewish
Society.
PRIVILEGES OF LEAP YEAR.
After Supper the Ladies Change
Places With the Gentlemen.
Season's Greetings.
A brilliant New Year's ball was given
last ni^ht at the Concordia Club on Van
Ness avenue, and as in former years on thÂ«
sume occasion the club sustained its high
reputation as an entertainer. Though all
the arrangements were delegated to spe
cially selected committees that earned out
the trust of receiving the ladies and their
friends in a way that left nothins to be de
sired, members assumed the pleasant duty
of assisting as hosts.
The clubrodms were lavishly decorated
with seasonable evergreens and flowers.
Chandeliers wÂ«re transformed into sus
pended bowers of greenery, ferns, smilax
and Christmas greens, having been deftly
woven to represent natural clusters that
might be looked for in some baaky dell.
The halls were beautifiedâ indeed it were
possibly to further adorn themâ with fes
toons of green leaves and " wreaths, from
which red berries gleamed prettily. -But
above all the ballroom and the supper
room appeared in the loveliest of winter
garbsâ the walls festooned with flowers of
brilliant hues, intertwined with light
touches of evergreen, while here and there
were great masses of blossoms and Christ
mas Derries amid green wreaths or gar
lands. ' '.:-.â  '. ''.
The puests began to arrive shortly be
fore 5) o'clock, and for fully iwo hours a
constant stream of fashionable people
rasseii through the doors of the ballroom.
The ladies fairly outdid themselves in the
elegance and beauty of their costumes, for
rarely, if ever before, was such a variety of
exquisite gowns seen at any ball in this
City. And there were so ruany guestsâ
fully 300â the baliroom seenetvas indeed
brilliant. It was the bull of the year in
fashionable Jewish circles.
Dancing began with a march and the
lancers, which" were followed by a waltz,
a deux temps and tine extra numbers be
fore midnight, when all withdrew to the
supper- room to enjoy a dainty supper.
Promptly at the midnight hoar all pres
ent exchanged New Year's greetings, ac
roii;named with a general shaking of
hands and expressions of good wishes.
1 lie following menu was discussed with
out the formality of toast, but as if the
guests and hosts constituted one large
family party:

MRS. DAVIDSON RAKES UP A NEW SCANDAL
Makes Another Sensational
Charge Against Dr.
Brown.
AN AFFIDAVIT IN DENIAL
The Pastor Explains an Embar
rassing Situation Into
Which He Fell.
MISS OVERMAN'S ADMISSION.
Detective Harry Morse to Go East to
Investigate â The Doctor's
Accuser Undismayed.
Little by little the true fact? of the great
Brown-Davidson scandal are coming to
light.
Dr. Brown is working with desperate
enertry to show up Mrs. Davidson's true
character, thereby tending to weaken her
charge of gross immorality.
Mrs. Davidson, undaunted by the efforts
of the pa-tor to bring into the controversy
event.- of the dead past, comes again to the
front with another charge, as serious and
direct in its nature as the first. Dr. Brown
explains this charge and supports his
claim with a lengthy affidavit. It is not
denied that 'he sum of $6DO was paid Mrs.
Ftockton. the new woman in the case, but
it i- strongly insisted that it wa3 done only
through fear Â«>j each a story, true or false,
hurting the church.
A prolonged conference of attorneys, de
tectives and the individuals directly inter
ested in the prosecution of Mrs. Davidson
was held at Dr. Brown's study ill toe
church at the corner of Mason and Post
streets. There were present Captain Lees;
Colby, Detective Seymour, Reu
ben Lloyd, Dr. Brown, Mrs. Brown, Miss
Overman and a male friend whose name
could not be ascertained.
Four hours were devoted to arranging
the evidence to be presented to-morrow,
the conference not ending till 7 o'clock last
eveuin.L'. â . ' ..- â¢ â¢
Harry Morse, thedetectiTe, has been em
ployed by Dr. Brown to investigate Mrs.
Davids | I record. The sleuth started
for Boston by the t> o'clock train last even
ing, and Dr. Brown was at the station to
â cc him off.
Mr?. Davidson bears up well under her
confinement. She insists that everything
wilLcome out right in the end, though she
is not unmindful of the tact that the
- hovering about her are dark and
menacing. .She was inclined to laugh at
\ue interview with Miss â¢Overman, as pub
. in a morning paper, though she was
not unmindful of the seriousness of many
of the young lady's statements.
Miss Overman has admitted thai she
â¼isited the office of the Chronicle to sell
a story of a wrong done to her, but states
that she was acting at the instigation of
Mrs. Davidson.
A LONG CONSULTATION.
Miss Overman Tells Her Story to
Captain Leesâ What the De
tective Thinks.
Dr. Brown and his atcorney, Reuben h.
Lloyd, had a long consultation in the
former's study yesterday afternoon, at
â which Captain Lees and Detective Sey
mour were present. It lasted from 1 till
close upon 6 oclock.
The case was reviewed at length pre
paratory to the hearing in Judge Camp
bell's court at U o'clock to-morrow after
noon. Miss Overman was present and
told her story freely.
"Any one who will listen to Miss Over
man's story,' said Captain Lees last nieht,
cannot but be thoroughly impressed with
its truthfulness. I have listened to the
stories told by a good many people, but
none so impressed me as that of Miss
Overman. She has nothing to conceal,
and I am morally convinced that she is a
good woman in every sense of the term.
"She is a young woman who is excep
tionally bright and intelligent, and she is
intellectually superior to most women of
her ace. She feels intensely the attempt
to blacken her character, and it has roused
all her faculties to defend her womanhood.
"The brave little woman is being crushed
between two forces, the enemies of Dr.
Brown and the enemies of the old woman,
.Mrs. Davidson. They do not seem to
think of her at all, but she will come out
of the ordeal all right.
"Just think of her leaving that woman's
house at 11 o'clock at night rather than
stay one minute longer after she knew
â¢what she had accused her of. She packed
up her trunk and valise, dragged them
out into the hall and went out into the
street, not knowing where to go. She met
a policeman and told him her story and
he got a hack for her. She told the hack
man exactly how she was placed, that she
was a stranger in the City and had no
friends to go to.
"He suggested taking her to a lodging
house at '-I Kearny street, I think that
was the namber, but her woman's instinct
came to her aid, and she said to him she
did not think that was a good locality for
a young and unprotected woman to stay,
and lie took her and her trunk to the
Carlton on Geary street. Was that the
way a woman of the class Mrs. Davidson
would make Miss Overman out to be
â¢would have acted? Xc, sir; it showed
how keenly she was smarting under the
insult cast upon her.
"She says she has been grossly misrep
resented in the Bulletin this afternoon,
and has been made to say things she nsver
dreamed of, far less uttered. She went to
the Chronicle office at the request of Mrs.
Davidson, and asked what they would

allow for a story in which the names of
several prominent men would be men
tioned.
"Mr. Simpson, the city editor, told her it
all depended upon the nature of the story,
and be would require to see the manuscript
before he could give a decided answer.
Nothing was said about $$000 or any other
sum, and nothing was said about her being
personally connected with the story. She
did not know who the prominent men
were and simply repeated to Mr. Simpson
what Mrs. Davidson had told her to say.
The prominent men, T know now, had
nothing to do with the present case. It
was not Mrs. Davidson she met after she
left the Chronicle office, but a lady who
accompanied her. She asked that lady to
go with her to the Chronicle office, but the
lady preferred to wait for her outside.
"When she left the office she did not, meet
the lady on Market street, and that part of
Mr. Simpson's statement is wrong. Mr.
Simpson tried to get the name of the lady
from her who wanted to sell the story, but
he was not successful and that was. 1 pre
sume, why he sent some one 10 shadow
her."
STILL UNDISMAYED.
Mrs. Davidson Refuses to Speak of
Past Events-Talks About Dr.
Brown.
Mrs. Davidson, undismayed apparently
at the sudden revealing of her Eastern
career, greeted visitors who cailed yester
day with that same confidential and con
vincing air which she has borne since her
arrest. From outward indications the aged
prisoner is not the least disturbed over the
events of the past 50 far as they reJate to
her Massachusetts record.
"So far as the present case is concerned,"
she said yesterday, "my 'Eastern record,'
as it is called, is not at all material. It
does not lessen Dr. Brown's infamy nor
falsify my charge. There is very little to
add to the statement as published in Thk
Call of yesterday, except as to minor
details. It may be of interest, however, to
recite another incident which plainly
shows the man's true caliber.
"I think it was about one month after
Mrs. Tunnell went to Tacoma that Dr.
Brown made a very peculiar request. He
came to see if a room could be secured
over Liebes' furstore, where I was
for Mattie should she return with
Mrs. Tunnell. I told my partner, Mrs.
Meyer, of it, and tiien went to the janitor
and the superintendent in the store. He
vetoed it utterly.
'â¢Dr. Brown offered to fix up the room
and pay the rent if it could be obtained.
He wanted a, duplicate Key, but I pro
tested against that, as it would compro
mise our moral character and luin his
reputation in the end. I stood up before
him and said that I haa been trained by a
Christian mother in the path of virtue and
to avoid even the appearance of evil, and I
would not submit to such a proposition.
All the time I prayed that God would de
liver Dr. Brown irum evilâ l could not at
that time believe he had yielded. In the
light, however, of his confessionsâ the
crimes of adultery and child murderâ l
was forced to accept him for what he was.
"I talked very little with Mrs. Tunellâ
only on general matters relating to Mattie.
The latter told me her own mother dis
liKed her, and while at Tacoma for three
months she staved much of her time la
Mrs. Tuneil's room. In ail probability
the latter was guardian of the unholy
cause of Miss Overman's flight from here
in November last. If the learned doctor
put the fatal cup first to Miss Overman's
lips to destroy the new life of their pas
sions, then Mrs. Tunnell was sent- to min
ister on the result of Dr. Brown's hellish
designs.
"in a careful retrospect of what both
have confessed to me I judge that they
were both vile creatures lonir before they
were brought together. Dr. Brown did
not wreck an innocent life, nor she cast a
spell upon an innocent man. Slow indeed
have I been to see this terrible crime,
which by the confession of their own lips
and the ready acquiescence of Dr. Brown
to pay the money to hide even the appear-
ante of evil is now all plain to me. I give
as my judgment, based upon past experi
ence, that their inner lives were long ago
removed from the lines of morality and
virtue."
WHAT MRS. SILSBY KNOWS.
Speaks Highly of Mrs. Davidson as
She Knew Her Thirty Years
Ago.
Among those who were acquainted with
Mrs. Davidson before she left her birth
place in Bucksport, Me., is Mrs. Anna
T. Silsby, who resides on Oakland avenue,
Linda Vista terrace, in Oakland. She was
seen at her home last night, and speaking
of her acquaintance with Mrs. Davidtoji,
said :
''Mrs. Davidson and myself were born in
Bucksport, Me., and though she was a
number of years my senior, I knew her
very well through being an intimate
iriend of her younger sister. She and Mrs.
Curtis of Sacramento, whose letter ap
peared in this morning's Calx,, and myself
were schoolmates for a number of years.
Mary Abbott, as she was then called, was
an exceeding fine-looking woman. She
was very tall and of splendid figure, and
besides having a very intelligent face she
also appeared to be exceedingly rehned.
"Her manners were charming and she
was in every respect a lovely woman. Her
family wasoneof the first in Bucksnort.
While not wealthy, they were well-to-do,
and because of their culture and refine
ment held a high social position. Mrs.
Davidson, with the other members of her
family, uiwuys moved in the very best so
ciety, where she was counted a shining
light.
''With her iirst husband, who wns Frank
Pierce, I was well acquainted, our families
being quite intimate. He was a very
handsome man and a man of unusual
character and ability. He came of
tine family and was also wealthy. I
shall nevertorget what a handsome
couple they made. He did not live but
a few years after they were married. I
was in Bucksport at the time of his death.
Several years later she married Mr. David
son, whose family was also one of the first
in Bucksport. He was a very tine man.
'â¢It is nearly thirty years since I came to
California, and 'on leaving Maine I lost
sight of Mrs. Davidson entirely. I heard
nothing of her until the report of her dis
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. JANUARY 1, 1896.
honesty and subsequent arrest in Lynn,
Mass., was written to me by friends in my
former home. My surprise could not have
been greater than when I heard that such
a charge had been laid to Mary Abbott.
"The words in every letter were, 'Can
you believe that a woman of Mary Ab
bott's character could be guilty of such a
crime?' and I could not find it to be
lieve.
"I have never heard of the rumor veri
fied. The friends who wrote me in regard
to it only knew of it by reading the news
paper story, and if they ever learned that
the charge was proven they never let me
know. I did not know that she had been
imprisoned at that time until I read it in
the paper a day or two ago. and, of course,
cannot say I believe this Mrs. Davidson to
be the same one, as 1 do not know.
"As 1 say, it was only a report that was
written to me and was never verified. It
must have been eight or ten years ago that
I heard of it, and I do not remember the
cause of her arrest more than that it was
in regard to obtaining money fraudu
lently.
"I have not read anything in regard to
the case of Mrs. Davidson and Dr. Brown,
and do not know anything except what I
have heard said of it, as one will hear such
a scandal spoken of. T have met Dr.
Brown, but do not consider that I am ac
quainted with him. Certainly he is placed
in a very trying and embarrassing position,
and I hope for his sake and for the sake of
his church that he is not guilty of the
charges brought against him.
"However it may be it seems incredible
that the woman I knew in my girlhood as
so refined and of such a beautiful charac
ter could instigate such black charges
against any man for the sake of gain.
Her family and that of each of her hus
bands was so highly connected, people of
such high moral standing, that it does
not seem as if any connection of theirs
could go wrong.
"John Farnham of the Crystal Baths
and Mr. Doane of Doane & Henshelwood,
in San Francisco, came from Backsport,
and must remember her well. We were
all young people there together. I should
be very sorry to have it proved that a
woman whom I thought so beautiful as
the Mary Abbot 4 [ knew years a;_-o could
have degenerated into so low a nature as
one needs must be to perpetrate such a
dastardly crime."
MISS OVERMAN'S STORY.
Admits That She Offered to Sell
the Chronicle a Sensa
tional Item.
"Both Captain Lees and my lawyer have
made me promise not to speak to re
porters," was Miss Overman's preface,
"and I musi of course act in accordance
with their instructions. As for the pur
ported interview in one of the morning
papers, it never took place. A woman re
porter came after a picture snd took oc
casion to speak with Dr. Brown.
"All the part I took in the conversation
was to complain of the manner in which
my marriage and divorce had been misrep
resented, and to give a brief statement of
the truth concerning these points. This
affair has made me suffer deeply, and 1
feel almost unnerved by it."
Miss Overman's appearance certainly
bore out her assertion. She looked old
and haggard, as though she had passed
through a long illness, while her sunken
eyes spoke silently yet eloquently of bitter
tears.
She seemed much depressed in view of
the manner in which her name had been
dragged before the public, and accuses
Mrs. Davidson of being at the bottom of all
the trouble.
"That dreadful hypocrite," she resumed,
"has used me as a tool. When I remem
ber how she used to kiss and fondle me as
though I were her own daughter, the very
recollection sickens and disgusts me. She
is an artful, designing woman, and 1 was
murh deceived in her.
"She was present when Dr. Brown first
mentioned to me the foul charges which
have since been sown broadcast through
the papers. Mrs. Davidson was so self
possessed and unconcerned at the recount
ing of her villainies that I felt fora moment
like killing her. As for a confession, I
never made one to her nor to any one in
this connection, for 1 am wholly guiltless.
As. for Dr. Brown giving me medicines
calculated to produce certain physical
effects, the whole story is a lie through
out.
"Yes; it is true that I offered to sell the
story to the Chronicle, and that is the only
ugly feature connected with the case. I
wrote the story, and then at her suggestion
visited the newspaper office. It was none
of my doing, for I was guided by her en
tirely."
MR. GILLIE'S DENIAL.
Flatly Contradicts Mrs. Davidson's
Statement Concerning the Sixth-
Street Lodging-House.
The following letter from Mr. Gillis ex
plains itself:
JBRAxrH 105, i
INTKUNATIONAJ. MaU.KKS' LEAOITR,
J. Gillie, Manager, 244 Sixth street, (
San Francihco, Dec. 31, 1895. J
Editor Morning Call â Dear Sir: In the
charges made by Mrs. Davidson against the
Rev. Dr. Brown through her attorney, Walter
Gallagher, in this morning's Call, she states
that Mrs. Badden claims to have been stopping
at 803 Bryant street, where Mrs. J. A. Gillie
was living at the lime, and hints that there are
points that can be worked up.
In reply to the above, I wish to say that thp
house referred to is not a lodging-house, but a
private dwelling, part of which was then and
is now occupied by the owner, Mr. Zeigle
meyer, we having the other rooms, and no suc h
woman as Mr.s. Badden was ever known or
heard of by any one in the house. Further
more, there was no room in the house for
strangers or women to occupy.
Aa for Dr. Brown meeting a woman there ho
would not be likely to risk his Christian repu
tation by going to a house in which he was
likely to encounter such radical infidels as Mr
and Mrs. liillie.
My confidence in Christian ministers and
Christianity is not very etrong, and I would
not be surprised if the charges made should
prove to be true, but if Dr. Brown, to my
knowledge, was as black as Satan himself 1
would deny every untruthful assertion madr
against him.
I hnvc no desire to injure Mrs. Davidson in
any way and hope she will be able to prove
her innocence, but I do object to any insinua
tions tending to reflect upon the "moral re
spectability of the people whose houss we oc
cupied while residing at 803 Bryant street,
where the mythical Mrs. Badden claims to have
lived.
If she is really in existence it was no difficult
matter for her to get possession of one of our
cards, as hundreds of them are mailed and cir
culated every month, and if Mrs. Davidson had
not been too pious to investigate this matter
she might have saved herself much trouble.
As it is she may realize that "trusting in God
is chasing the leil-end of nothing."

THE WOMAN'S NEW CHARGE
Mrs. Davidson Revives an Old Scan
dal â Dr. Frown's Denial Sup
ported by a Strongr Affidavit.
In addition to the sensational charge
preferred by Mr*. Davi-on against Dr.
Brown of criminal intimacy with Miss
Overman, the aged prisoner now comes
forward with a statement which more than
parallels her first accusation.
The charge is made by Mrs. Davidson
that some months ago Dr. Brown forcibly
entered the room of a well-known woman
on Mason street, and that, in order to hush
the matter up, he paid the sum of $tSOO.
Dr. Brown denies this only as to the ob
ject of his visit to the woman.
Mrs. Davidson, in a statement made just
prior to her arrest and later placed in the
hands of her attorney, makes substantially
the following charges:
"I had known Mattie Overman some
time, when one day in a burst of indigna
tion she told me of another event in Dr.
Brown's life which convinced me more
than ever that he was a base hypocrite. It
was nothing less than an attempted assault
on a Mrs. Stockton. He was caught in
the very act, however, and forced, under
fear of exposure, to give up the sum of
!SOOO.
11 'I think it a perfect shame,' said Mat
tie,'that this woman should be paid $tioo,
while I am put off with a paltry $35 a
month. I can swear this money was paid
to Mrs. Stockton through her adviser,
Lloyd Tevis,' she added, 'because I saw
it.'"
Concerning this matter, and also the
Sixth-street lodging-house episode, Mrs.
Davidson mailed the following unique let
ter to Dr. Brown on December 26:
Let C. O. Brown read and ponder upon these
words, "Other foundations can no man Iny,
save those that are laid in Christ Jesus." lie
that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
them not shall be likened unto a foolish man
who built his house upon the sand. And the
ruin descended and the floods came and the
winds blew and beat upon that house and it
fell, and great was the fall of it. The house oi
C. O. Brown is built upon the ''sand."
The Stockton "rain" descended and the Sixth
street "floods' came, and when C. O. Brown
attacks Mrs. Davidson the cyclone of God's
wrath will scatter it to the four "winds" of
heaven, and great will be the fall thereof.
Thus far the prayers of God's people, here and
there, to your Godly father, have entered the
Divine ear, and God's great mercy alone tem
pers the storm around your tent. Your sud
den distinction scatters tne sheep of the fold
you do not keep and the lambs of the flock en
tirely perish.
In future C. O, Brown cannot (in person)
communicate with Mrs. Davidson, and things
will take their own course, through the chan
nel of thp flood which leads direct to your own
office, and where Mrs. Davidson as mediator
by God's mercy cannot appear.
Dr. Brown does not deny the charge
that he paid Mrs. Stockton $GOO, but says
that he did so, not because lie was guilty
of a crime, but fearing that the church
would be injured if such a lie was made
public.
"Mrs. Stockton applied for membership
to my church," he said, "and on the occa
sion referred to by Mrs. Davidson, I did
visit her house. She sent me word that
she was ill, and without any hesitancy I
called. I walked into the room and found
Mrs. Stockton in bed. I extended my
hand, which she took, and then before I
could realize what was being done, she
had her arms about my neck, and then
some one came into the room.
"I saw through it all in a moment. It
was a clear case of blackmail, and rather
than subject my church to the possibili
ties which could arise from such a story
becoming public property, I paid the sum
demanded, $()00. That is all there is to the
story, and 1 nold here a receipt and ack
nowledgment that it was a blackmailing
scheme."
Mrs. Stockton is a handsome blonde, of
rather petite figure, and a worshipper at
the shrine of fashion. Most any fine day
she can be seen on the prominent thor
oughfares. Her elegant wardrobe includes
sealskin and diamond.
Mrs. Stockton resides at 615 Mason street,
but was not at home to visitors last night.
'â¢I am not going to be interviewed on
this matter," she sang through the speak
ing tube." It is an unreasonable hour and
besides that there is nothing new I can
tell. The story is absolutely true, so there
is no need to rehash old stuff. So good
night."
It is stated on good authority that Dr.
Drown and Mrs. Stockton were frequenters
of a popular French restaurant prior to
the unfortunate scene in the latter's room.
In addition to Dr. Brown's own denial
pf the charge, the following affidavit is
submitted :
State of California, /
City and corNTY of Bak Francisco. t
George D. Gear, being first duly sworn, de
poses and says that he is and was at all tile
times hereinafter mentioned an attoruey-at
law in the City and County of San Francisco.
State of California: that during the spring of
the year 1894, in the month of April or May,
tho exact time affiant does not remember,
there came to him in person a certain Mrs. M.
A. Stockton, then and for some time prior
thereto residing in the City and County
of San Francisco, and informed your
affiant that she nan a claim for dam
ages against a prominent citizen of
this City, whose name your affiant for numer
ous reasons does not at this time wi=h to dis
close; that the said Mrs. M. A. Stockton wished
your affiant to visit the snid gentleman and
make a demand upon him for a large sum of
money for an alleged wrong done the said Mrs.
Stockton; that your affiant had reason to be
lieve and did believe that the said alleged
claim was groundless and without right and
was in the nature of blackmail, and that said
Mrs. M. A. Stockton had no claim of any kind
or nature whatsoever against said gentleman:
that your affiant considered the matter for
some time, and upon investigation found that
the said claim was blackmail pure and simple,
and your affiant, believing it his duty as an
officer of the law and in furtherance of justice
to do all in his power to frustrate said scheme
of blackmail, immediately informed said gen
tleman of said scheme and plot; that after
consultation and advice with, said gentleman
it was deemed advisable by both your affiant
and said gentleman that your affiant should
not^ let the Mrs. M. A. Stockton know
of ;the said last - mentioned interview or
of the fact that the affiant was trying to stop
said blackmailing scheme, and your affiant led
the said Mrs. M. A. Stockton to believe, to the
best of your affiant's knowledge and belief and
in the furtherance of justice, that affiant was
co-operating with said Mrs. M. A. Stockton;
that the gentleman above mentioned offered to
retain your affiant hs his attorney in the said
matter, but your affiant refused and ever after
ward refused to accept any money or other
thing from said gentleman, and affiant never

matter one cent of money or any other consid
eration, believing it to have been his duty to
act in the premises without reward of any
kind or nature from cither of Â«aid parties; that
affiant had numerous conversations with said
Mrs. M. A. Stockton, and also numerous letters
from ncr, all of which were told and read to
suit the gentleman ; that your affiant, after In

demand had been made, instructed the said
gentleman to write to your affiant informing
him that he, the snid aforementioned gentle
man, would not in any manner accede to the
proposition of the said Mrs. M. A. Stockton,
made through your affiant ; that the demand
was blackmailing demand and one he would
not fora moment recognize; that thereupon
the said gentleman wrote a letter to your affi
ant Informing him that the snid proposition
was infamous and to let the said Mrs. M. A.
Stockton attempt to carry out threats made by
her against said gentleman, and further
saying: "I fear your client will land
where she least expected." That after show
ing said letter to snid Mrs. M. A. Stockton the
said Mrs. Stockton to the best of your affiant's
knowledge and belief desisted from any further
efforts of attempting to get money from said
gentlemen through said scheme and plot; that
your affiant in investigating the mutters wa
informed and believes that prior thereto s,aid
Mrs. M. A. Stockton had attempted another
blackmailing scheme and plot against another
gentleman of high standing in this community,
whose name your affiant knows but does noi
wish to mention in this connection; that said
last-mentioned scheme was nipped in the bud
by one of the most prominent geutk-men of this
; City, to .vhom your affiant is informed and be
j lieves the said Mrs. .Stockton was under great
j obligations, and to whom the said last men-
I tioned intended victim of said Mrs. Stockton
immediately went and laid the said plot be
fore him; that thereupon the said gentleman,
to whom said Mrs. Stockton was under great
obligations, immediately sent for said Mrs.
Stockton and denounced her actions as out
rageous and calculated to land said Mrs.

gentleman never again to attempt any like
action against any one; that your affiant has
been informed of said last-mentioned facts

obligations, and who thus successfully stopped
said blackmailing scheme; that after the said
first-mentioned scheme of blackmail of said
Mrs. M. A. Stockton the said Mrs. Stockton, be-
I Moving as ycur affiant believe* that your
affiant had acted in her interest in said matter,
and endeavored to obtain snid money for her to
his utmost ability, and believing that your
affiant would help her in her nefarious scheme
and plots, again communicated with your
affiant informing him that she had a scheme
to gei some money from the Rev. C. O. Brown
of this City, the present and then pastor of the
First {Congregational Church of the aforemen
tioned city and county; that the said Mrs. M.
A. Stockton then said that she had joined the
said church to get in with some of the mem
bers and get some money out of
them, and further informed your affi
ant that she, the said Mrs. M. A.
Stockton, "lived by her wits" and tnat she in
tended to get money from said Dr. Brown by
j threatening him with troubie; that your
â  affiant, deeming it his duty in the furtherance
! of justice and right and as his duty as an offi
cer of justice as an attorney of this State to see
that justice and right should be done, imme-
I diatcly went to said Dr. Brown and informed
the said Dr. Brown of his interview with the
said Mrs. Stockton; that after a few days the said
Mr*. Stockton lo>t faith in your affiant, and as
she was In desperate straits as to money mat
ters, as your affiant was informed by her and
believes, wrote to your nffiant and informed
him that she should place it in other hands, as
she was determined to make said Dr. Brown
Rive her some money ; your affiant thereupon
informed said Dr. Brown of said facts and
instructed the said Mrs. Stockton to slop j
her actions in the matter and not to pur
sue the said matter further; that thereupon tho
said Mrs. Stockton became aware of the atti
tude of your affiiant an.l procured another at
torney, to whom she told some tale of which
your affiant baa no knowledge; that thereafter
said attorney called upon baid Dr. Brown at '
his residence, "and immediately upon breaking
the subject to said Dr. Brown was forcibly and
summarily ejected by said Dr. Brown,
U your affiant is informed and be
lieves; that thereafter the said attor
ney, according to affiant's information
and belief, (railed upon said Dr. Brown at his
study and apologized to said Dr. Brown for his, â 
the said attorney I*,1 *, connection wit li the mat- :
ter, and further informed the said Dr. j
Brown that he, the uud last mentioned attor
ney, would do anything in nis power to help :
the said Dr. Brown, as he, the said attorney, ]
was convinced that the said demand :
of said Mrs. Stockton was unjust and
without any basis; that thereafter the
said Mrs. Stockton used her every
endeavor to harass and annoy the said Dr.
Blown, and has since made many threats
against him; that affiant Is aoout to leave the
State of California, and expects to be absent
therefrom for a long period of time, and for the
protection of the said Dr. Brown In the event
that the said Mrs. M. A. Stockton shaU again
renew her attacks upon said lir. Blown,
your affiant on his own accord ana in I
the interests of justice, makes this
affidavit; that affiant lias never re
ceived for his services from the said Dr.
Brown any reward or money whatever, but
has acted wholly for the sake of right and
justice, although the said vr. Brown has many
times offered your ftfliant payment for bis >er
viees; that your affiant has not received any
money from the said Mrs. M. A. Stockton
lor his actions, as affiant in his peculiar
position deemed it unwise and unprofes
sional to accept money from any of the
aforementioned persons for his services,
and has not done so from them or from
any one on or fur their account; that affiant is !
absolutely certain the aforementioned de
mand.- and schemes have been the vilest
blackmail, and well knowing an accusation of
any character against a minister of the gospel
[a Likely to find believers, even thouch utterly
groundless and without the shadow of a
basis, makes this affidavit in order to
help an innocent and persecuted servant
of the Ixird and to avert the odium which usu- j
ally follows charges against members of the j
church oi God in the minds of unchristian!
and godless men and women of the world.
In witness whereof affiant has hereunto set
his hand this 15th day of November, 1895.

TALK IS CHEAP.
Easy to Make Rulesâ To Observe
Them Is Another Thing.
Mr. Blank closed the book impatiently and
flung it away. It was a learned treatise on
hygieneâ how to preserve perfect health. "i-i f<
"If I have to observe all these rules I'll have
no time for anything else. Who'll pay the
landlord, the butcher and the baker?"
Bo many "rules of health" seem to presup-
pose a social system where everybody can take
the best care of his body; where overexertion,
exposure, irregular diet, impure air, food arid
water and a thousand other disease-breeding
conditions can be totally avoided.
That is impossible, even for the wealthiest.
Make your system nearly impervious to mor-
bific influences and disease germs; store up a
sort of sinking fund of reserve strength and
vigor to resist unusual drains on your vitality.
Peruvian Bitters will accomplish this. They
not only cure indigestion, loss of appetite, las-
situde, malaria, colds, etc v but they tone up
the system to resist their appearance. Peru-
vian Bitters give â¢ such efficiency to the diges-
j tlve system tnat it produces surplus nutrition
and vitalityâ something in excess of daily
needsâ that keeps us up in the "hour of trial*."
