WAR CERTAINLY
EXISTS IN CUBA
Nearly Forty-three Thou
sand Patriots Are in
the Field.
LACK OF AMMUNITION.
How the Insurgents Have Often
Overcome Some Tremendous
Obstacles.
A DAREDEVIL AEMY, INDEED.
Graphic Description of the Forces
Whose Recognition as Insurgents
Is Demanded.
HAVANA, Ci-ba, March 14 (via Tampa,
Fla.. March 17). âThe present strength
of the insurgent army is close to 43,
--000. Cubans themselves estimate the
number of men in the field as high as
60,000, but even if unarmed camp follow
ers, men in charge of provision trains,
hospitals and camps were counted it is
doubtful if that number could be found
actually in service. There are thousands
of Cubans who would willingly cast their
lot with the patriotic army, but lack of
arms and ammunition prevents.
The insurgent forces operate as a rule in
tones or districts and are organized on
military lines. The columns of Gomez,
Maceo, Lacret and Banderas are, however,
limited to no one province, but pass from
one to another under direct orders of
Gomez. The commander-in-chief is now
in Matanzas and the others have rein
vaded Havana province.
The following iÂ« a statement of the
strength and location of the forces of the
principal leaders: Maximo Gomez, in
Matanzas, 6000; Antonio Maceo, Miro
Zalas and others, in Havana, 500 l); Serafin
BaHches. in Santa Clara, 4000; Jose Maceo,
Kojas. Rodriguez, in Santiago, 3500; La
cret, in Havana, 3000; Quintin Banderas,
in Havana, 9000; Masso Alvarez, Castillo,
Mestro, Nunez, in Havana, 3000; Delgado,
Bermudez, Sanchez and others, in Pinar
del Rio, 2600; Aguirre, Diaz, Hernandez,
Palacios, in Havana, 2500; Maria. Rode
rignes and others, in Camaauey, 1500;
Reyes, Benitez, \~axa, Wilaon, Mendicita,
in Santiago, 1000; Rafael Cardenas, in
Matanzas, SOO; Verona, Ruperto Sanchez
and others, in Pinar del Rio, 800; Oliva
I*4 M&6TS, in Pinar del Rio, 600; Carillo.
Joaquin Garcia and others, in Santiago,
600: Roloif, PaiM-ho, Perez, in Santa Ciara,
500; Mirabel, Fprrez.Veita, in Santa Clara,
500; Rego, Sixto, Rogue, Palao. Sanchez,
in Santa Clara, 500; Cortuna, Vidal,
Juan Bravo, in Santa Clara, 400; Juan To
ledo, El Ingle^ito, in Santa Clara, 400;
Matagasin Matanzas, 400; Robau, Cebreco,
Ruen, Planas. in Santiago, 400; Borroto,
Lancno, Sardinas, Eduardo Garcia, in Ma
tanzas, 400; Aulit, Mosjon. Demas, Mar
tinez, Sorolongo, in Matanzas, 400; Vil
lancoa, Acosta, Aguilar and others, in
Havana, 300; Munez, Chapotin, Sosorro,
Lino Perez, in Santa Clara, 200; total,
42,800.
The distribution according to provinces
is: Havana. 16,800; Matanzas, 8000; Santa
Clara, 6500; Santiago, 5500; Pinar del Rio,
3900; Camaguey. 2100; total, 42,800.
In addition to the foreeoing there are
innumerable local bands from fifteen men
to fifty or even 100. * These do not form
part of the righting force and should not
be counted as part of the army.
Their chief functions are to carry out
the orders of Gomez, prohibiting the
grinding of cane, the movement of troops
and supplies by rail, the shipment of pro
visions to cities, the suppression of "pla
teados," who rob, burn and commit other
crimes. These small bands serve as re
cruiting agencies, and when they grow too
large for local operation they are attached
to one of the army columns. Of the army
proper, fully two-thirds are well mounted
and about half are well armed. The others
are armed with shotguns, revolvers or
machetes. Some of Maceo's men have
old-style muzzle-loading guns, and lead is
so scarce that telegraph wire chopped into
short lengths is used for the charge. Span
ish surgeons have on several occasions re
ported soldiers wonnded with bits of wire.
The insurgents have a few pieces of
mountain cannon captured from Govern
ment troops. There are perhaps a dozen
of these guns, which have been used with
disastrous effect against the small wooden
forts which the Spanish troops have erected
at various points. The Cuban army of
liberation, as it is called, has grown to its
present size in the face of almost insur
mountable difficulties. From the begin
ning it has been outnumbered by the army
of Spain in never less than four to one.
It has escaped annihilation in many en
counters when ammunition ran out. It
has lived on forage, been almost constantly
under fire and is to-day a reckless, dare
devil army with but one idea in view, and
that is to free Cuba. What comes after is
not given a thought. J. Frank Clark.
MORGAX'S PLEA FOR CUBA.
Demands That Justice Be Accorded the
Struggling [Patriot*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 17.â 1n a
four- hour. speech to-day Senator Morgan
of Alabama closed his defense of the action
of the Committee on Foreign Relations in
reporting the Cuban resolutions. He re
plied to the criticisms of Senators Hale of
Maine and Hoar of Massachusetts in con
nection with ; the statements from the
Spanish Minister, and he placed against
these arguments Yon the side of Spain the
statements of .Queseda, the Cuban repre
s ntaiive in. Washington, â¢ and various
newspaper publications, besides varioun
written communications detailing stories
>1 atrocities practiced in Cuba during the
fast insurrection. His speech to-day and
festerday occupied altogether seven hours,
tr will "be Vfollo *{ to-morrow 'I with ': a
â¢peech .on the -same â¢ subject by Mills of
Texas.
The resolution offered yesterday by
fc:ki;i3 (R.)of West Virginia, instructing
The San Francisco Call.
the Committee on Foreign Relations to re
port material facts as to the war in Cuba,
was laid before the Senate, but at the
suggestion of Elkins it went over till to
morrow.
At 2 p. m. the Cuban resolutions were
taken up and Morgan (D.) of Alabama
continued his speech in support of them.
Morgan began by speaking of the super
sensitiveness of Spain because she felt the
sand slipping from under her feet while
"the ccm of the Antilles was passing out
of her grasp." He sent to the clerk's desk
and had read -what he called the Spanish
Minister's "diatribe against the Senate
and Senators." He spoke of Senor de
Lome as "a supercilious foreign Minister,"
and said that it was high time for the
House and the Senate to close their doors
against such attempts to influence them.
Morgan spoke of the censorship of the
cable between Cuba and America by the
Spanish authorities, and said that, so far
as the mails were concerned, he hart been
informed yesterday by a Catholic priest,
who knew perfectly well both Spain and
Cuba, that the mails between Cuba and
the United States were constantly opened
and their contents examined. He charac
terized Senor de Lome's statement to the
press as l- a flagrant abuse of privilege."
It was certainly time, he added, that the
diplomatic affairs of the United States
were withdrawn from public tinkering and
tampering. If the Senate was to be con
tinually kept in "uproar and confusion by
telegrams coming from the Premier of
Spain to some newspaper editor in the
United States to be read iv the Senate as
authoritative statements, the State De
partment might as well be abolished, leav
ing the people to rely on those men who
had acquired eminence in newspaperdom
for the purpose of gaining knowledge of
what is transpiring in foreign countries."
Morgan then discussed the point of the
constitutional guarantee against Senators
or Representatives being held to account
for words spoken in debate. He might, in
his place in the Senate, calumniate any
citizen of the United States having some
connection with public affairs without be
ing accountable for libel.
Gray (D.) of Delaware asked Morgan
whether tne citizen in question would not
have the same freedom of speech?
Morgan admitted that he would, but it
turned out in this case, he said, that the
Minister from Spain was not a citizen of
the United States. He was entirely pro
tected by the law of nations against any
proceeding to hold him accountable for
libel, either criminally or civilly. There
was where the rub came in which sealed a
Minister's lips.
Morgan read the historical incident of
the interview between Jefferson and the
French Minister, Sevet, and exclaimed
passionately: "Would to God that we
had somebody here now who had a ju*t
conception of the constitutional rights of
the different parts of this Government!"
"I have not asked," he continued, "for
the dismissal of this Minister. Let him
stay if he wants to, but I have a right to
claim the protection of the constitution of
my country against any assault that may
be made upon my votes or speeches. I
have a perfect indifference to what Senor
de Lome â  may say, but I am not going to
subordinate myself quietly to an v man in
the world, but more especially to a foreign
Minister whose country is now being made
a subject of serious examination in the
councils of the Senate."
Hale (R.) of Maine called attention to
the fact that the chairman of the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations (Sherman) did
not share in Morgan's opinion as to the
Spanish Minister's statement, and read an
extract from Sherman's last speech in the
Senate to the effect that De Lome hart a
perfect right to defend his Government
and people anywhere.
Morgan said he had not proposed to
notice that position of Sherman, but now
that it had been brought forward he would
say ttiat he did not agree with Sherman on
that subject. He would now place against
Mr. de Lome's statement that of Mr.
Quesada, the representative of the Cuban
republic to Washington, who sent the
case in behalf of Cuba to the Department
of State, which statement the Secretary of
State sent to the Committee on Foreign
Relations.
"Strip Mr. de Lome," said Morgan, "of
his royal commission and put him on his
Spanish blood, on his Spanish character
and his history (of which I know nothing).
Then bring Mr. Quesada here on his his
tory and Spanish blood and character (of
which I know nothing) and confront them
as they are confronted through the news
papers, and let them both speak."
Morgan sent to the clerk's desk and had
read Quesada's letter to a Washington
paper describing several horrible atroci.
ties alleged to have been perpetrated in
Cuba during the last rebellion, in which
General Weyler is represented as having
had ladies stripped naked, whipped and
given up to the lust of his troops.
The reading was interrupted by Chand
ler (R.) of New Hampshire on the ground
that the statements were too indecent for
public rehearsal, but Hale insisted that the
reading should be proceeded with in order
to show how utterly unworthy of credit
the statements were.
Then Morgan had sent to the clerk's
desk and read a story from the New York
Tribune â high authority, he said, on ac
count of its anti-Cuban sentimentâ as to
the execution of seven students in
Havana in 1878 on suspicion of havinc
desecrated the grave of a Spanish general
in the cemetery.
Hale inquired what name waa signed to
the article, and was told thatih ere was no
name signed to it. He said that he
thought that some authority should be
given for such statements.
Morgan disagreed with him on that
point. It was like a statement in any pub
lic history. The Tribune was the historian
in the rase. It selected extracts with the
view of informing the people of the United
States, and it would not publish such a
story unless it was clearly authentic.
Morgan read communications about
barbarities by the Spanish troops during
the las> rebellion, also an interview with
General Daniel E. Sickles, who was at that
time United States Minister to Spain, re
cently published in the New York Sun,
and which Morgan admitted had been
politely sent to him by General Sick! s.
Morgan said he might have rested the
whole casn on that interview with General
Sickies. He did not choose to incumber
the record with more of these statements,
further than to show that a state of open,
horrid war exists in Cubaâ a war involving
the property, rights, liberties and lives of
American citizens who happen to be there.
The line of action for Congress to take was
to declare that open w T ar exists in Cuba
and that the laws of war shall apply to it.
He had expected to have an opportunity
to answer some of the llings thrown at the
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MARCH 18, 1896.
" Now for the shearing."
Committee on Foreign Relations by the ]
Senators from Massachusetts and Maine j
(Hoar and Hale), but the occasion was one
of too grea: solemnity and too great im.
portance to permit him 10 thrust himself
into the debate, either personally or as a
member of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations. The committee had most faith
fully and attentively examined into the
great mass of petitions referred to it and
had undertasen to confirm its opinion to
that expressed by the great body of Ameri
can citizens.
In winding up his speech Morgan was
very severe on "American emigres in the
great cities of Europe" (who owned or con
trolled newspapers in London, Paris and
New York, and who flared up when the
Se?iate uttered a v;ord of sympathy with
Cuba), and he referred contemptuously to
"the rec nt fiasco" of publishing an al
leged dispatch from the Spanish Premier.
He would commend to the Spanish Pre- |
mier the ptoverb about the fleas which tor
meot those who would consort with the I
canine race. He stated without hesitancy
that the cry of Cuba for justice, humanity
and mercy had not (in his case) fallen on
dumb ears and hardened hearts. Every
movement in favor of Cuba had the same j
effect, he said, on excitable Spaniards as a ;
banderillo in the neck of a Spanish bull.
He suffered the taunts which he had re
ceived in communications from the North
a? to his sympathy with negro insurgents
in Cuba, and he declared that he would
rather be in the cabinet of a government
with Gomez and Maeeo than in a cabinet
of a government with Valmasedaand Wey
ler. He preferred and the American peo
ple demanded that Spain should not de
prive American citizens in Cuba of their
property.
If neither party to the struggle in Cuba
could defend the rights and property of
American citizens who were there, then he
proposed that the Government of the
United States should intervene to protect
them at the risk of shocking the refined
sense of propriety with which some Sena
tors seemed to be troubled. When the
American people and Congress had ex
pressed their opinion in a way which was
practically unanimous if the President did j
not concur (as he, Morgan, believed he
would), the President would simply have
to assume the responsibility. Now that
Spain was engaged in a war with Cuba
that was perfectly hopeless, he thought
that Congress might be pardoned for ex
pressing the opinion that war prevailed
there; that the Cubans were entitled to
tne rights of belligerents and that the
people of the United States were entitled
to the opportunities and duties of neutral
ity.
He did not want to give such an appar
ent ground for criticism, but if that fanatic
and deluded monarchy committed acts of
hostility against the United States, then
the United States would be compelled to
take up the gage of war.
Morgan spoKe for nearly four hours, and,
after Mills (D.) of Texas had occupied the
floor on the Cuban question for a short
time, the Senate at 5:40 adjourned until
to-morrow.
GEXEIiAT, GARCIA GETS AWAY.
With His Son Hr Will Join the Insur-
gent Army.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 17.â The Re
corder will to-morrow say: When the case
of the Cuban filibusters implicated in
the Bermuda, Laurado and Hawkins ex
peditions is called in the United States
court next Monday General Calixto Garcia
will probably be missing and his bail for
feited. It is now certain that he has left
for Cuba. General Garcia did not leave on
board the Bermuda, as was generally
thought. He left in a tug and was trans
ferred to the Bermuda far out at sea.
With him were other patriot s bound for
Cuba.
Others went to Fiorida and sailed from
there to meet the Bermuda. Among those
who went to Florida was Dr. Carlos Gar
cia, General Garcia's son, and among those
who left ta a tug from New Yorfc with the
general was Dr. Hernandez. He is going
to be the chief ot the surgeons' staff in
the Cuban army, which is the only sal
aried body in the insurgent camp. Dr.
Garcia left his home ten days ago for
Florida. Friends of the Garcias say that

"EVER LASTING
AND FOREVER."
Adjournment of the Wasted
Session of Kentucky's
Legislature.
SENATOR NOT ELECTED.
There Was Also a Failure to
Pass the Urgently Required
Revenue Bills.
REVIEW OF THE STATE TROOPS.
With the Disgruntled Statesmen the
Militia Retired From the
Capitol Grounds.
FRANKFORT, Ky., March
lasting, eternally and forever," according
to "Cy" Brown's motion, the joint as
sembly of the Kentucky Legislature ad
journed to-day. Tjhe entire session has
been devoid of results. Primarily, the
chief business of the body â the provision
of proper means and the enactment of just
laws for the conduct and administration
of goveriimentâ has been neglected in the
absorbing interest attendant upon the
Senatorial contest. During the session
the rare spectacle of a State Capitol filled
with troops and the enforcement of mar
tial law was pres ented.
The revenue bills failed to pass to-day.
The urgent necessity for their passage is
apparent from the fact that the present
indebtedness of Kentucky is $860,000.
The militia leaves to-morrow. There
was a grand review on the Capitol grounds
this afternoon, at which Governor Bradley
made a speech, thanking them for their
services.
The proceedings of both branches to-day
were pretty much like those of other Legis
latures, being marked by a disposition on
the part of members to do as little as possi
ble. In the Senate nothing of particular
importance was done. From 10:30 until
noon the members lounged about the
chamber, while the clerks read some bills
that had been enrolled.
When the Senate reconvened after the
joint assembly. Senator Clark called atten
tion to the fact that the revenue bills were
still unpassed, and appealed to his col
leagues not to adjourn until they had
made laws. The Senate then adjourned
till 3 o'clock.
When the enrolling of the bills had been
completed Senator Elliston (D.) of Grant
County made the second appeal of the day
to the Senators not to adjourn until the
revenue bills were disposed of, but it
availed nothing, filibustering being kept
up for an hour until the special committee
appointed to investigate into Governor
Bradley's action in calling out the troops
presented its report. It was very volumin
ous and wound up with the "censure" of
the Senate.
Following is the closing sentence :
"Your committee therefore find and de
clare and recommend tt at by the adoption
of this report the Senate of Kentucky de
clare that the use of the military power of
the commonwealth by the Governor was
unnecessary for the preservation of the
peace or for any other lawful purpose;
that said military force was not used by
the Governor for theV ur pose of preserving
the peace, but was used only for partisan
political purposes; that said action of the
Governor was wholly without warrant of
law, and was and is a flagrant subversion
of the civil authority to the military power
of the commonwealth."
The report was adopted by a strict party
vote.
Shortly before 6 o'clock, the hour to
which the session had been extended, a
committee was appointed to notify the
House that the Senate was ready to ad
journ.
A similar committee appointed in the
House was received by the Senate and both
proceeded to inform the Governor. While
they were absent 6 o*clock arrived and
Lieutenant-Governor Worthington, with a
rap of the gavel, announced the Senate ad
journed.
''Is it sine die?" asked a member.
"It is," replied President Worthington,
and so ended one of tie most remarkable
legislative sessions in the history of Ken
tucky. There wan an absence of the usual
noisy scenes which attended the breaking
up of the Senate.
The struggle for United States Senator
from Kentucky which has just closed will
go into history as the most remarkable
contest ever waged in any State in the
Union. The contest really began and was
fought at the same time the campaign for
State officers was being conducted. Al
though there were numerous candidates
for the nomination by each party caucus,
no one had any show from the start except
Dr. Godfrey G. Hunter for the Republican
nomination and Senator Blackburn for the
Democratic.
The two Houses were evenly divided on
joint ballot, the Republicans having a
majority of six in the House of Represent
atives and the Democrats controlling the
Senate by the same majority. From the
beginning of the session acrimonious
bitterness governed each body, and to these
nwho know the disposition and quick ter-
per of Kentuetcians the gravest results
were feared. From the first ballot to the
last this remarkable contest has held the
interest of the entire country. Replete
from ttart to finish with sensational in
cidents the final act in this great political
drama was a fitting denouement and the
spectacle of a legislative body of a great
commonwealth being guarded under mar
tial law by the State troops will go down
to posterity as a lasting stain upon Ken
tucky's escutcheon.
BLACKBURN'S BITTER WORDS.
Scores Governor Bradley and Denounces
the Democratic- Press.
FRANKFORT, Ky., March 17.â The
Blackburn people held a meeting in the
opera-house this evening. A feature of
the occasion was a speech from Jack Chirm,
which was loudly applauded.
Senator Blackburn's address had to do
with the different phases of the strange
political drama just closed here. He was
rather bitter in his denunciation of what
he termed "the traitors in the party," and
warmly eulogized the Populists for their
support of him. Ho scored Governor
Bradley in a bitter and impassioned man
ner for calling out tho militia, character
izing his action as despotic, cowardly and
tyrannical. He also fired some hot shot at
the press. Said he: "There has not been
one single line, original, copied, borrowed
cr stolen, in the Democratic press of Louis
ville for the past twelve months that was
not a lie."
SU>K IX A I>EX'SE FOG.
Loss of the Norwegian Bark Siam With a
Cargo of Sugar.
LEWES, Del., March 17. â During a
dense fog the Norwegian bark Siam,
Captain J. Jacobson, struck a submerged
wreck on Fenwick Island shoal and sank
yesterday afternoon. The crew was res
cueJ.
The Siain was loaded with sugar and was
121 days out from Java. The estimated
value of the cargo is $73,000. The vessel is
a steel bark of 658 tons.
COSTICTEU OF ABDUCTION.
Three Men Carried Off a Girl and Tied
Her to a Stake.
SUMMERVILLE, Fla., March 17.â
James Hopson, Dabney E. Palmer and
Bill Henderson were convicted yesterday
of the abduction of Miss Grace Darrell,
after a trial lasting nearly a week. The
three men and Miss Darrell are residents
of Center Hill, a small railroad station in
Surater County. Miss Darrell is a pretty
girl. 17 years of age, and is from Fort Erie,
Canada. Hopson and Palmer are promi
nent young men (white), Palmer being a
nepbew of W. B Lamar, Attorney-General
of Florida, and Bill Henderson is a negro.
Miss Darrell was abducted on Thursday
night, February 20, and was not discov
ered until Saturday. February 22, when
she was found tied to a tree in the woods
about three miles from her home, nearly
dead from fright and exposure. Her cloth
ing had been torn from her.
When she revived she said that on the
night mentioned she was seized and gagged
and borne into the woods, where she was
stripped and tied to the tree. She recog
nized her abductors as Hopson, Palmer
and Henderson. No motive for theabduc
tien was brought out during the trial.
TWO MISSIONARIES PERISHED.
Stanley S. Harvey and Wife of Boston Among
the Victims of the Explosion on
ihe Matadi.
BOSTON, Mas?., March 17.â A cable
gram received by Rev. F. L. Piper of this
city, secretary of the American Advent
Mission Society, confirms the news re
ceived of the loss of the steamer Matadi by
an explosion of gunpowder on the Congo
River.
The missionaries who lost their lives
were Mr. and Mrs. Stanley S. Harvey of
Boston and members of the Advent Mis
sionary Church and both missionaries of
ihe American Advent Mission Society.
They haa just started on their way back
to America for rest.
Mr. Harvey was about 30 years of age.
He spent two years at the missionary
training school in this city, established
by the late Rev. A. J. Gordon, D.D., and
sailed for the Congo in 1891. His wife
joined him there shortly afterward. They
were stationed on the south side of the
Congo, near the Baptist stafton at Kimvika.
COLLISION OF TWO TRAINS.
Fire Follows the Wreck and the Flames Are
Extinguished by Snow.
HARRISBURG, Pa., March 17.â News
has just been received here of a bad acci
dent on the Pennsylvania Railroad early
this morning near Steelton, a few miles
west of this city. The fast line express
train, which leaves Harrisburg at 3:45
a. m., ran into a livestock train at Steel
ton, and a bad wreck resulted.
Two men were killed and about a dozen
hurt. Several of the cars of the cattle
train were smashed, and fully 100 sheep
were killed or so badly hurt that they were
killed to put them out of pain.
To add to the danger, the wrecked cars
caught fire and began to burn fiercely.
The uninjured passengers organized them
selves into a fire department, and by
throwing snow on the burning wreckage
succeeded in putting out the tire before it
had gained mucn headway.
BEFORE THE ARISTOCRACY
Examination of Jameson and His
Raiders Resumed in the
Bow-Street Court.
Troopers Who Participated in the
Expedition Give Some Impor
tant Testimony.
LONDON, Ek, March 17.â The exam
ination of Dr. Jameson and his fellow
ofricers in the Transvaal raid was resumed
in the Bow-street Police Court this morn
ing. As at the previous hearings, the
courtroom was filled with members of the
aristocracy, friends and admirers of the
defendants. Sir Robert T. Reid, M.P.,
Q.C., watched the proceedings on behalf
of the Transvaal Government. Associated
with him was Sir George Lewis, who pre
pared the ca?e for Mr. Parnell and the
Irish party against the London Times be
fore the Parnell commission. Among the
spectators were Lady Cranborne, Lady
Raleigh and Mrs. Asquith, wife of the late
Home Secretary.
. Sergeant Ruck, who took part in the
raid, was called to the witness-box and
described the pi-ogress of the expedition
into the Boer country. Several troopers
who took part in the fieht with the Boers
at Krugersdorp were called to the witness
box and narrated their experiences, the
facts of which have already been pub
lished.
The lawyers for the prosecution laid
great stress upon admissions made by the
witnesses that stores, relays of horses,
arms, ammunition, etc., awaited the Jame
son expedition at various points on roads
converging upon Mafeking, showing that
the raid had lone been planned and was
not due to the Johannesburg committee's
letter, which was read after the expedition
arrived at Krugersdorp.
Several witnesses testified on behalf of
the Government that they had acted in the
capacity of messengers. When they found
the wires had been cut behind Jameson's
party so that they could not be communi
cated with, the witnesses were obliged to
pursue the party on horseback. They over
took Jemeson and tried in vain to induce
him to return.
The hearing was adjourned for a week.
POLICT OF THE PORTE.
Tries to Tliroiv the Blame on the Artnen-
ian Patriarch.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, March
17. â The Porte has demanded that the
Armenian Patriarch write an autograph
letter, admitting himself blamable for the
outbreaks in Armenia, and it is the inten
tion of the Porte to print the letter, in the
event of its being written, in a red book,
the purpose of which will be to show that
the statements contained in the British
blue book on Armenia are false.
The Porte has also informed the Patri
arch Ihat his continuance in office will
provoke further massacres. The Armen
ian Patriarch can resign his office only
with the consent of the National Council,
which the Sultan fears to call together.
A number of deputations called upon the
Patriarch on Sunday and Monday and be
sought him to remain in office. The mem
bers of the mixed council have threatened
to resign if the Patriarch resigns. Russia
is using strong pressure to force the Patri
arch to do so.
Many J'rrsons Frozen to Death. â¢
ST. PETERSBURG. Russia, March 17.â
The Government of Orel has been visited
by a terrific snow storm. Reports received
here state that 130 persons were frozen to
death in one night. Large numbers of
horses and cattle were also frozen.

Chamber, said :
"Our first thought turns to the brave
soldiers who have fallen in Africa in de
fense of the flag. Let us send a message
of sympathy and hope to those who are
still maintaining the honor of Italy in that
country. Event* of which Parliament
will have to judge have led our sons to
disaster, due to want of military prepara
tion, and whoever is responsible for the
disaster will be punished."
Continuing he denied the truth of thÂ«
rumors of the Government's acceptance of
proposals of peace with Abyssinia and an
nounced that the Government would ask
for a credit of 140,000,000 lire for the pur
pose of continuing the campaign until
Italy bad obtained an honorable situation.
He rejected the policy of colonial expan
sion, but he said it would be dangerous to
Italian interests to renounce the ter
ritory of the Tigre. Still, the Gov
ernment doe? not wish to impose an
Italian protectorate upon Abyssinia. The
Government, he declared, sought order in
ternally and fidelity to the triple alliance
externally.
The Premier's speech was greatly ap
plauded, the Radicals having been especi
ally well pleased with his statement in
opposition to colonial expansion. Other
groups, however, found the Government's
intentions in Africa, as outlined by the
Premier, obscure and contradictory.
"The late Ministry," the Premier said,
"ordered the opening of negotiations for
peace. We have continued the negotia
tions and will still continue to treat, but
we will not accept any conditions except
such as will reinstate the national honor."
In the Senate a motion supported by the
Marquis di Rudini, thanking the British
Parliament for its sympathy, was passed
amid great cheering.
The Italian press is very enthusiastic over
the statement made by George N. Curzon,
Under Foreign Secretary, in the British
House of Commons in regard to the British
expedition into the Soudan. The Popolo
Romano says it is impossible to exaggerate
the importance of the statement. For the
first time, the paper says the British Gov
ernment proclaims to Europe her alliance
with Italy. .

PARIS, France, March 17.â M. Berthe
lot, Minister of Foreign Affairs, had an in
terview with rue Marquis of Dufferin, the
British Enibassador, this afternoon. He
asked the reason* for Great Britain's send
ing an expedition to Dongola. He
pointedly called Lord Dufferin's attention
to the gravity of the consequences of such
a step.
Baron Mohrenheim, the Russian Em
bassador, today visited M. Berthelot,
Minister of Foreien Affairs, and discussed
with luru the matter of the Anglo-Egypt
ian expedition to Dongola.
LONDON, Eng., March 17.â The British
expedition toward Dongola continues to be
a subject of discussion in political circles,
more as to its possible effect on European
politics than as to its result in Africa. The
excuse given for it, that it was intended to
help tbe Italians at Kassala, is generally
discredited, and it is believed to be merely
an attempt to increase British possessions
and British power in Africa, and incident
ally to head of France and perhaps Italy.
France evidently looks on it in this way,
as shown by the strong protest already
made.
CAVSES ii ME AT SURPRISE.
French Statesmen Sot Pleased by Eng-
land's Attiludf.
LONDON", Ehg., March 17.â The Morn
ing Post will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Paris stating that the decision of the
British Government to take part in the
Sond&n expedition has caused great sur
prise. The painful impression in Govern
ment circles has been intensified by the
decision, inasmuch as it wa9 hoped that
the recent efforts to remove the cause of
friction between France and Great Britain
would lead to durable and friendly rela
tions between the two powers. The pres
ent decision is likely to embitter the
French against the British.
A semi-official bulletin embodying the
substance of the interview between M.
Berthelet, the Foreign Minister, and Lord
Dufierin, the British Embassador, caused
a sensation in the Chamber of Deputies,
owing to an allusion it contained to the
serious consequences of the step taken by
the British Government.
The Standard's Paris correspondent
dwells upon the sensation caused by the
serai-official bulletin. He says that in
quiries led to the belief that the threat of
M. Bertheiet to forcibly thwart the ex
pedition was not intended. The difficulty
turns, upon obtaining the sanction of the
Debt Commissioners to employ Egyptian
money for meeting the expenses of the
expedition.

a dispatch from Paris which says, referring
to the semi-official bulletin of the inter
view of M. Berthelet with Lord Dufferin :
"This note, a la Oiney, has aroused
strong press enthusiasm. If M. Berthelet
should submit a patriotic order of the day
to the Chamber of Deputies it would be
carried unanimously, no matter what its
terms might be.
"The danger of the situation lies in the
ignorance of a majority of the Deputies of
foreign affairs. M. Berthelet knows more
on this subject than the whole Chamber
together. I believe that hia influence will
restrain the Deputies. I dread to think
what might happen yrith a warlike
Foreign Minister."

Sir Henry said :
"It is my opinion that Shakespeare has

SOME OPPOSITION
TO BIMETALLISM
But a Motion to Secure an
International Agreement
Is Adopted.
DEBATED IN THE HOUSE.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach Objects
to Departing From the
Gold Standard.
HAD BUILT UP THE COUNTRY.
First Lord of the Treasury Balfour,
However, Favors the White
Metal.
LONDON, Eng., March 17.â 1n the
House of Commons to-day Herbert
Whitely moved a resolution declaring that
the House was of the opinion that the in
stability of the relative value of goM and
silver since the action of tbe Latin Union
in 1893 has proved injurious to the best
interests of the country, and urging the
Government 10 do everything possible to
secure by international agreement a stable
monetary par of exchange between gold
aud silver.
Sir Michael Hicks-Bench, Chancellor of
the Exchequer, reminded the House of the
passage of a resolution at the last session
urging the Government to co-operate with
the other powers in s conference aiming to
remove the evils arising from ' the fluctua
tions in gold and silver. The present Gov
ernment did not wish to recede from that
resolution. The Government was willing
to enter into negotiations "with the powers
for a conference, but on the understanding
that it was not prepared to abandon the
gold standard in the United Kingdom.
[Cries of "Hear! Hear!"]
Some of his colleagues, notably the
First Lord of the Treasury (Mr. Balfour)
were pronounced bimetallista, but all
agreed in thinking that they would not be
justified in departing from a gold standard
in tbe United Kingdoji. The prospects
of an agreement between the European
nations in favor of bimetallism were not
great. There was no doubt if the powers
could agree regarding the use of silver
that the Indian Government would re
consider the question of reopening its
mints. All the leading English monetary
experts held that the wealth of the coun
try had been built upon a gold standard
and that its permanence and prosperity
were dependent upon the existing system.
In view of that opinion no responeible
Government would propose to change the
present conditions.
A loner debate followed.
Sir "William Vernon Harcourt said he
welcomed the declarations of Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach that the Government did not
intend to depart from the established
monetary system. It was not creditable to
England, he added, that until now doubt
had existed as to the views of the Govern
ment on this question. This ought to be
the last appearance of the bimetallist in
Parliament.
The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour followed
Sir William, and made a somewht lengthy
defense of his known views as a bimetallist.
The resolution was then adopted with
out a division being taken.
Mr. J. M. White, member for Forfar
shire, asked Mr. Walter Long, president of
the Board of Agriculture, whether he could
not postpone the permanent exclusion of
Canadian cattle until the report of the
remonstrances of the Dominion Parliament
should be received.
Mr. Long said he could not see any way
of postponing the exclusion.
Sir C. J. Pearson, Lord- Advocate of
Scotland, replying to a question by Henry
Seton-Karr, Conservative, said that the
state-aided crofter colonizing scheme in
the western part of the Dominion of
Canada had not been attended with much
success up to the present time. The
colonizing board, he said, had Â£5000 still
unexpended, but the Government- was not
prepared to start any further schemes of
the kind.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, replying to Mr.
Labouchere, said that the objections made
to the continuance of the chartered South
Africa Company ought to be removed by
the decision of the Government to take the
whole military police into its own hands.

GEXERAL MILES A QUEST.
Celebration of St. Patrick's Day by Loyal
/ otlotcerS'
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 17.â The
loyal followers of St. Patrick did honor to
their patron saint to-day. The Ancient
Order of Hibernians celebrated the day
with a big street parade. To-night the
Hibernia Society held its annual dinner at
the Hotel Walton. Nearly 300 guests were
present, and the toasts and those who re
sponded to them were as follows:
"The United States," Congressman
Amos J. Cuniniings of New York; "Ire

"The Press," SVilliam M. Singerly, propri

General Nelson A. Miles, who was also
one of the puests, was unexpectedly called
upon to speak. In opening his speech
General Miles said he was of the opinion
that the army and navy of this country
should be increased until it was commen

DIPL OMATIC COUR TEHIES.
They Are Extended by the British atid
Venezuelan Minister*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 17. -Sir
Julian Pauncefote received several copies
of the Parliamentary Blue Book on the
Venezuelan boundary dispute in his mail
this morning, and one of his first acts was
to promptly send a messenger with a copy
and his compliments to Senor Andrade,
the Venezuelan Minister, who had already
extended a similar courtesy when the offi
cial Venezuelan correspondence was issued
in book form a weak ago to-day. These
incidents indicate that while there are no
direct diplomatic relations between the
two countries, cordial personal relations
exist between the official representatives
at this capital.
FOUR NEW BATTLE-SHIPS
Their Construction to Be Rec
ommended by the House
Naval Committee.
At the Same Time Provision Is Made
for Fifteen Very Swift Tor
pedo-Fioats. s
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 17.â At
to-day's meeting of the House Naval Com
mittee it decided to recommend in the
naval appropriation bill the construction
of four battle-ships and fifteen torpedo
boats. The battle-ships will have a dis
placement of about 11,000 tons and shall
cost not to exceed $3,750,000 each, exclusive
of armament. The appropriations to begin
the work on the battle- ships "will be in
keeping with the amount which Secretary
Herbert stated he could expend nest year
for that" purpose.
Five of the torpedo-boats will be of large
size and will cost in the aggregate $850,000,
while the appropriation for the remaining
ten, which will be of smaller di
.mensions, will be $800,000. In view
of the expedition with which boats
of this character can be built $1,256,
--250 of the entire amount will be provided
for in the present bill. The large boats
will have a speed of twenty-six knots as
as against twenty knots for the smaller
vessels.
This conclusion was reached only after
a two hours' discussion, participated in by
the thirteen members present. Hall of
Missouri, an absentee, in a letter to the
committee requested that his vote be re
corded in favor of the largest number of
ships which it might be regarded neces
sary to recommend, but his request was
not granted.
Hilborn of California finally moved that
tbe committee recommend four battle
ships.
Hanly of Indiana offered an amendment
fixing the number of battle-ships at six.
The first vote was taKen on the amend
ment. It was defeatedâ 7 to 6. The affir
mative vote was cast by Hanly of Indiana,
Cummings of New York, Meyer of Louisi
ana, Money of Mississippi, Tate of Georgia
and Hart of Pennsylvania. Those voting
in the negative were: Boutelle of Maine,
Hulick of Ohio, Hilborn of California,
Bull of Rhode Island, Wilson of New
York, Foss of Illinois and Dayton of West
Virginia.
The vote on the Hilborn proposition for
four ships was then carried unanimously.
The principal items of the bill have been
given heretofore in these dispatches and
the measure a 3 agreed to, without the al
lowance for the new ships, will carry an
appropriation of $28,454,784.

The Acting Secretary of the Treasury to
day submitted to Congress a letter from
the Chief of the National Academy of Sci
ence, asking for an appropriation of $25,000
for the establishment of a National forest
policy for landÃ of the United States.
Representative Hilborn presented the
petition of lodge 206, Sons of St. George of
California, favoring the passage of the

also made on Representative Gamble's
bill so as to have 5 per cent payments

GEORGE DIXON
IS VICTORIOUS
Bests Jerry Marshall at the
Boston Music
Hall.
MAKES A GAME FIGHT.
But the Weaker Pugilist Is
Seized With Cramps and
Finally Gives Up.
OUTCLASSED FROM THE START
Considerable Heavy Punishment Was
Inflicted Up to the Close of the
Seventh Round.
BOSTON, Mass., March 17.â 1t took
Champion George Dixon but seven rounds
to get the decision over Jerry Marshall at
Music Hall to-night. Marshall did not
meet the expectations of the 2500 specta
tors present, but there was some excuse
for him, as he had to take off considerable
weight yesterday and weighed in at 126
pounds, or four pounds over weight.
Dixon, was, however, a pound and a half
overweight, too, so no forfeit was required.
After the first round it was evident that
Marshall was outclassed by Dixon, who
showed throughout the bout that he is far
from being a back number. Dixon forced
tbe fighting from the start and Marshall
narrowly escaped being put out in the first,
the gong alone saving him. In the mid
dle of the second round his legs became
cramped, and despite the rubbing they re
ceived from his seconds they continued to
grow worse, and Marshall ordered his sec
onds to throw up the sponge in his corner
at the end of the seventh round. Dixon
was seconded by Tom O'Rourke and Sun
Ashe. Marshall's seconds were Patsy
Kerrigan, Billy Hennessy and Jack Ed
wards.
At the call of time Dixon feinted a few
seconds, then rushed in with the left on
Marshall's wind and got away without a
return. Then he came with another left
and the right on the jaw, followed rapidly
with both hands on the face. Dixon
landed rapidly, and finally Marshall coun
tered on the ribs and the two clinched.
When they broke away Dixon landed a
staggerer on Marshall's jaw, and then kept
up his blows with the rapidity of a wind
mill. In the second round Marshall re
covered somewhat from the onslaught, but
Dixon gave him no rest, and the spectators
looked to see Marshall go out every sec
ond.
In the third Marshall's glove became
untied, and Dixon eenerously stepped
back to allow it to be fixed. In this round,
as well as in the fourth, Dixon put up a
rapid fusillade which Marshall was unable
to successfully resist. The men clinched
several times, but Dixon invariably got
the best of it. Marshall was kept on the
run all the time.
The fifth round saw considerable sharp
in -fighting, Dixon's left playing a decid
edly dangerous part, although Marshall
made a plucky fight
In the sixth round Dixon's left swings
wore always stopped by Marshall's body
or jaw, and finally Marshall got in a hard
return on Dixon's ribs with his right, then
a left on George's jaw and received a
stinger from Dixon.
In the seventh round Marshall surprised
everybody by the way in which he stood
up before Dixon's rushes. It was hard
punishment, though, but Marshall man
aged to plant several telling blows on
Dixon's wind.
Dixon continually scored on Marshall's
face, wind and jaw, but the round was cut
short by the gone. Marshall then crossed
the ring and shook hands with Dixon,
saying he had finished, and the referee
had nothing to do but award the bout to
Dixon.

BIG BUSINESS FAILURES
Assignments Made by Some
Leading Merchants of
Philadelphia.
Many Complications Growing Out
the Suspension of James Long
Bros. & Co.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 17.-Sev"
eral big failures were announced here to
day. Oliver N. Long and William H.
Long, trading as James Long Bros. & Co.,
manufacturers of dress goods, made a gen
eral assignment to-day for the benefit of
their creditors to David C. Nimlet, who
also is a manufacturer. The assignment,
it is said, was partly precipitated by judg
ments on notes entered yesterday against
the firm aggregating $89,9-19. Oliver N.
Long secured judgment against William
H. Rhoades on a note for $75,000 dated
February 20, 1896, and payable in three
days. In addition to the assignment of
the firm Oliver N. Long individually as
signed to David C. Nimlet.
William Rhoades, against whom Oliver
N. Long obtained a judgment for $75,000,
also assigned and named Henry Laughlin
as assignee.
Frank H. Rhoades, against whom O.
N. Long obtained judgment on a note for
$100,000 and William H. Long against the
same for $50,000, also assigned, placing his
affairs in the hands of Henry Laufchlin.
It is stated that notes held by the Longs
against the Rhoades was on money loaned
the latter for building operations.
The failure of the Longs is said to have
been caused by dullness of trade and an
overstock of goods. The firm consequently
was unable to meet its notes promptly and
its creditors were pressing. The liabilities
could not be ascertained this afternoon.
H. R. Schoch entered up judgment against
William and Frank Rhoades on five notes
aggregating $175,000.
Execution was issued this afternoon on
a judgment note for $18,000, issued in
favor of Rachael Blank against William
Harvey & Co. The note is dated March
17, payable in one day.
Counsel for Albert Callaghan, trustee for
Elizabeth Callaghan, this afternoon issued
an execution from the Common Pleas
Court against Robert Callaghan on two
notes, one for for $221,856 and the other for
$7533, both dated the 12th inst., payable in
one day.
Robert Callaghan is a manufacturer of
ginghams. His attorneys say he will
probably be able to pay off all his in
debtedness.
SOCIAL SEATTLE SHOCKED
Dr. Lewis R. Dawson Brings
Suit Against His Wife
for a Divorce.
Twelve Prominent Young Men Are
Named in the Complaint as
Co-Respondent.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 17. â The
social struoture of this city will receive a
severe shaking up m the trial of an action
for divorce begun by Dr. Lewis R. Dawson
against his wife, Mamie C, Dawson. The
papers in the case have already been
served on the parties litigant and will
probably be filed in the Superior Court to
morrow.
Socially Dr. and Mrs. Dawson have for
many years been prominent, occupying a
most enviable position in the rank of
Seattle's "400. If Added to the shock con-
sequent upon the announcement that
steps are being tanen for a separation, Dr.
Dawson makea further sensational charges
of inndelity.naming twelve co-respondents,
among them Charles Esplin Jr., Frank
Carroll and A. C. Hess.
Those who were dragged into the case
are young men equal in rank and social
prominence to the doctor and his wife.
Some of them are members of families
representine the greatest wealth and aris
tocracy of the city. They were often enter
tained at social functions given by Dr. and
Mrs. Dawson.
Mrs. Dawson (nee Kauimann) was mar
ried to the doctor eight years ago. She
was young, beautiful and possessed many
charms and womanly graces. Meanwhile
she has lost but little in attractiveness.
In addition she possessed a fortune of
about $100,000, inherited from her father,
one of the pioneers of Seattle.
Save for two childrenâ boys aged 4 and
5 years respectively â born of the nnion, a
peaceable separation would undoubtedly
have been arranged. But over the little
ones the parents will struggle, trying to
do their worst each to prove that the
other ia unfit fo"r the custody of their off
spring.

ON THE GALLOWS
Cherokee Bill Dies Just as
He Had Lived, Game
to the Core.
DEATH MET WITH SMILES
Neither the Notorious Outlaw Nor
His PareDt Flinched or
Shed a Tear.
WAS A DESPERADO FROM YOUTH
Murder Merely an Incident in the
Career of the Daring Craw
ford Goldsby.
FORT SMITH, Ark., March 17.âChero
kee Bill was haneed here at 2:13 o'clock
this afternoon. The drop fell at 2:13, and
he was dead in ten minutes. He never
moved a muscle, and smiled when the cap
was adjusted.
Cherokee Bill died as he lived â game to
the core. He walked unflinchingly from
the jail to the gallows, and met death with
a smile on nis lace. His mother was
brought out of his cell at 1 :53 o'clock, and
Bill said then that he was ready to go at
any time. Promptly at 2 o'clock ne was
brought out of his cell, and at the jail door
was joined by his mother and aunt. He
walked between them unsupported to the
g.llows. On the gallows, in reply to the
question if he had anything to say, he
answered: "No; I came here to die, not to
talk."
Turning he 1 kis6ed his mother goodby
and with a smile on his face walked to his
place on the trap. Father Pius said a
grayer while the doomed man was being
rinioned. Bill recognized friends inside
the inclosure and calling them by name
bade them goodby. To Ed Reed, Bill
Starr's >on, he called out: "Goodby, Ed;
good luck to you old boy. Take care of
Dt.llie."
He caught sight of a kodak in the crowd
and asked that no pictures be taken of
him.
He was smiling when the cap was drawn
over his head. The noose was adjusted
and at 2:13 Turnkey Eoff sprung the lever
and threw the trap. Bill's wonderful
nerve was inherited from his mother, who
stood by him on the gallows without flinch,
ing or shedding a tear. She took the body
to Fort Gibson at 3 o'clock.
Crawford Goldsby was the euphonious
name conferred upon Cherokee Bill when
he wa? born at Fort Gibson, I. T., Febru
ary 8, 1S7Â»). He was one of the few rob
bers who infested the Indian Territory
during tin reign of terror of 1894 and he
belonged to the Cook gang.
He worked with Bill Cook on the
ranches in the Creek Nation, near Tulsa.
Cherokee Bill became an outlaw at the
age of 14. He shot a man with whom he |
bad quarreled and irom that time until j
hib arrest he was on the scout, suspicious
of every one except his mother and sister,
and counting no friend so dear as his
trusty Wincnester riflie.
Bill's last robbery was the one which
cost him his life. On November 9 he and
Verdigris Kid were robbing Lenapah,
when Ernest Melton 'loosed out of his
window to see what was going on. Bill
saw him and sent a bullet through his
brain. For this he was convicted on Feb
ruary 27, 1895, and on April 15 was sen
tenced to be hanged on June 25.
One of the many murders charged to
Bill was that of Agent Richards of No
wata. Bill strenuously denied this charge.

A CASE OF RULE OR BUIJi.
STany Cuban Tou>ns Destroyed During
the War* Frogress.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 14 (via Tampa,
Fla., March 17).â Some idea of the devasta
tion already wrought fay the war in Cuba
may be gathered from the following list of
towns which have been destroyed in the
four western provinces: Benjucal, Jaruco,
Wajay, Helena, Del Sur, Bainoa, Le Cata
iina, San Nicholas, Nueva Paz, in Havana
Province; Cabanas, Caijabos, Palacios.
Paso Real, Sun Diego de los Banos, Vi
nales, San Juan Martinez, Montezuclo, Los
Arroyos, Cuane, Bahia Honda, San Diego.
Nunez, Quiebra, Hach, in Pinar del
Macagiia, San Jose, Los Ramos, Rogue,
Torriente, in Matanzas, and Amaro, Sala
manca, Maca, Flora, Mai Tiempo, San
Juan los Yeras, Ranchuelo, in Santa Clara.
Besides these over twenty-five towns
Lave' been half burned. Most of these
towns have been burned by the insurgents
lor resisting attacks or because they were
being used as: depots of supplies for Gov
ernment troops. In some cases, like that
of Cabanas, the troops demolished the
town to prevent the insurgents from occu
j.ying it. Very little "of the destruction
has been done wantonly by either side.
When the insurgents, led by Maceo, en
tered Pinar del Rio every, town in the
province, except the capital city, welcomed
him w.th open arms and no property was
injured. Later the Government troops
entered the province, and, moving in
Btroug columns, dislodged the insnrgents
from town after' town, establish ing their
own garrisons there. Thereupon the in
habitants burned their own towns and
*n early the entire province is nov7 in ashes.
anlsb> troops occupy the < city of Pinar,
del Rio, the towns of Candelaria, Arte
misia and the port of Colima. All the
rest of the province is in the hands of the
enÂ«mv.
General Weyier's decree in ordering the
confiscation of property in . Havana and
Pinar dd Bio provinces of all who fail to
report allegiance to Spain has = produced
great indignation. His decree against
planters and others who contribute funds
or aid to the insurgents in anyway applies
to the case of American owners of estates
who have paid money to the insurgents
for the protection of their property.

Officers of the Horsa to Be Wined and
Imprisoned.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 17. â
Judge Butler, in the United States Circuit
Court this morning, overruled the motion
for a new trial in the case of the officials of
the steamer Horsa, convicted of being en
gaged in a military expedition for carry
ing men and arras to Cuba, and passed
sentence upon the prisoners. Captain
Weborg was sentenced to a fine of $300
and imprisonment of a year and four
months. Mates Peterson and Johnansen
were fined $100 and sentenced to imprison-
ment to eight months each.
Subsequently the sentence, of the two
mates was changed to one year each, so as
to enable them to go to the Eastern Peni
tentiary instead of to the County Prison.
This makes their offenses what the law
terms as infamous and gives them a better
status before the Supreme Court.
The case of all three of the defendants is
to be taken to the Supreme Court upon a
writ of error and a special allocoitur asked
for to enable the defendants to be liber
ated upon bail pending the argument be
fore the Supreme Court.
BANNOCKS TO SEEK REVENGE.
Settlers in the Jackson Hole Country Re
ceive Warning of a Raid by
Redskins.
EVANSTON, Wyo., March 17.â The set
tlers in the upper portion of Uintah
County, embracing the Jackson Hole
district, are very apprehensive of trouble
with the Bannock Indians from the Fort
Hall reservation. A number of them re
ceived letters from people in the vicinity
of the reservation to the effect that there
is an organized plan by the Bannocks
to raid the Jackson Hole section in the
spring, in order to be avenged for the ar
rest and killing of Indians in that section
last summer by the settlers. The settlers
are removing their families to a place of
â safety.
PANAMA CANAL COMPANY
Counsel Cromwell Explains That
There Has Been No
Consolidation.
The New Organization Is Not Backed
by France and All Nations
May Co-Operate.
IN EW YORK, N. V., March 17.â William
Nelson Cromwell, the American counsel
for the new Panama Canal Company of
Paris, referring to recent statements, to the
effect that a consolidation of the Panama
and Niearaguan companies had been
agreed upon or was under negotiation,
made the following statement:
"I confirm the fact that I have just filed
with Secretary of State Olney a formal
declaration in behalf the new Panama
Canal Company, that there does not exist
nor is there in contemplation any agree
ment, arrangement or plan for the
consolidation or acquisition of the
Panama Company with or by ibe
Nicaragua Company, under any form of
ownership or control ; and that there has
not been any negotiation to that end.
Without commenting in any way upon the
Nicaragua project my client unequivocally
denies that there is any foundation in fact
or in design for the rumors referred to.
"As the Government of the United
States has chartered the Maritime Canal
Com pany of Nicaragua, and has given it
governmental countenance, it becomes our
duty to advise this Government of these
facts, that there might be no possible mis
apprehension by the Government and the
people of the true position of the new Pan
ama Company. In view of these allusions
to the new Panama Canal Company, a few
facts concerning it may pc of interest.
"It was popularly supposed that the
new Panama Canal Company of Paris is a
governmental organization. This is an
error. It is a private corporation, organ
ized about two years ago under the gen
eral laws of the republic of France, just
as any business corporation may be organ
ized under the general laws of any State of
our Union. Its directory is composed of
the representatives of the strongest finan
cial institutions of France prosecuting the
enterprise purely as a business under
taking.
"It is also a popular error to treat the
new Panama Company solely as a French
enterprise. Being purely a private under
taking and having no political character
the people of the United States will be
afforded fair opportunity for equal parti
sanship. It is decided that .the canal shall
be neutralized, as was done in the case of
the Suez. That is, the nations concerned
in its operation may # by common agree
ment, make this as a neutral waterway for
the commerce of the world. Thus the
United States can secure the gieat advan
tages of the canal without financial obli
gations or serious political responsi
bilities. 1 '
THEIR JVJSH' UXIFORM.
How God's American Volunteers Are to
lie Attired.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 17.â The
first weekday meeting of God's American
Volunteers was held last night in the
Union Tabernacle. Major Glenn presided.
There was a sprinkling of Salvation Army
uniforms in ihe audience, and when at the
close of the meeting Major Glenn requested
all the soldiers present to remain as he
had some instructions to give, fully two
thirds of the whole number gathered below
the platform.
It has now been definitely settled, Major
Glenn said, that the uniform of the women
volunteers shall be of a dark russet tint, a
shade warmer than seal brown, but equally
serviceable and becoming. The point has
become quite a burning question, and for
the first time since t!iey put away worldly
garments the fair Salvationists who have
seceded are exercised about spring head
gear. It is probable that the choice will
be made of a form resembling that in the
old-fashion plates called the "cottage
shape."
It will be done in brown straw, with
silken trimmings to match, and cannot
faii to be exceedingly becoming to Mrs.
Booth, whose delicate complexion and
cbestnat hair it jrill suit admirably, while
some of the blonde lassies will also look
charming in it. The uniform of the men
will be darkest blue. The officers are to
wear cavalry hats and the soldiers peaked
caps.
Uhl Sails for Germany.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 17.-Hon.
Edwin F. Uhl. recently appointed to tne
place of the late Theodore Runyon, United
States Embassador to Germany, sailed
this morning on the Lloyd steamer Saale.
The new Embassador was accompanied by
his famiiy. He received many handsome
floral tributes from those who went to
Hobokeu lo see him off.

Delegates.

Convention.
PLATT AT WORK IN GOTHAM.
At a Dallas Mass-Meeting of the
"Black and Tan" Wing Several
Men Arft Stabbed.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 17.â 50 far
as Presidential preferences are concerned,
the Republican State Convention to-mor
row will be in the nature of a love feast.
Two-thirds of the 700 delegates and a regi
ment of political workers from the respec
tive Congressional districts are on the
ground to-night and with one accord ihey
are singing the praises of Ohio's candidate
for the first place on the National ticket.
No second choice is talked of, the senti
ment being that Wisconsin's delegation
should stick solidly to McKinley until he
is nominated or his race is proved hope
less, in which latter event the delegates
should be at liberty to follow their indi
vidual inclinations. While all are agreed
on the main point, however, it is evident
that the contest for the four delegates at

The fight is Detween the old element or
State machine, of which the venerable ex-
Senator Philetus Sawyer is the principal
representative on the ground, and the
younger element, which has had its bat
teries trained on the machine for several
years. But six delegates are regarded as
in the race. These are ex-Senator Sawyer
of Oshkosh, ex-Governor Hoard of Fort
Atkinson. State Senator Stout of Meno
minee, Edward Scofield of Oconto, and
Eugene S. Elliott and ex-State Chairman
Henry C. Paine, both of this city.
The convention will be called to order at

INVENTION OF A SEATTLE MAN.
Country Travel to Be Revolutionized by the
Introduction of Steel Wagon-
Roads.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 17.â Colonel
J. D. Mclntire, an irrigation and civil
engineer if this city, believes he has solved
the good roads question. He predicts that
he has an invention which will revolution
ize country travel. According to the in
ventor, who refers to the product of his
genius as the "steel wagon-road," it was
obtained from his observing that drivers
of every kind of vehicle seek streetcar
tracks in preference to the best gravel or
paved streets. The track on which Mcln
tyre proposes to have wagon wheels run 13
a steel rail of the thickness of boiler plate
and five inches wide, constructed in the
shape of a gutter, with a square, perpen
dicular shoulder one-half inch high, then
an angle of one inch outward, slightly
raised. This furnishes a condit to carry
off rain water and makes an easy course
for wheels to run in. By this plan the
wear on tires is reduced to a minimum
and loaded wagons can easily go on or
leave thÂ«> track. It is estimated that a
horse will draw on one of these road
(which will not cost more than $1500 per
mile, as against $6000 for macadamized
thorougiifares) twenty times as much as
on a dirt road. One of the most interest
ing features in connection with the inven
tion is that bicycles as well as wagons can
be used on the road.
WOODLAXD EXTRADITIOy.

WOODLAND, Cal., March 17.â J. P.

Chambers, the escaped convict and stage
robber.
The habeas corpus proceedings instituted
by Chambers' attorney failed to convince
the court of the prisoner's innocence. The
Idaho official took the stand and posi
tively identified the defendant as Charles
Chambers. He remembered the features of
Chambers, especially his forehead, eyes
and nose. __^__________
COMOX TARGET PRACTICE
Petty Officer Rowd of H. M. S.
Royal Arthur Breaks
All Records.
Small Bullseye Hit Eleven Times
Within Two Minutes With a
Rapid-Firing Gun.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 17.â At the
recent tiring practice of H. M. S. Royal
Arthur at Comox a wonderful score was
made with a quick-firing gun by first
class Petty Officer Rowd. A canvas tar
get about twelve feet in diameter with a
five-foot bullseye was fixed on shore and
buoys were placed to mark the range,
wnich was some IGOO yards.
Time limit of two minutes was allowed.
The object was to see how many shots
could be effectively fired at the target in
that time, the ship moving at twelve knots
an hour.
Rowd is captain of the 6-inch quick
firing gun on the forecastle starboard bow,
and in the two minutes allowed he fired
thirteen shots, eleven of them striking the
target, and a fourteenth shot being in the
gun before time was called. The gun
squad assisting him did splendid work, for
as each shot weighs 100 pounds it meant
the raising of 1400 pounds and the firing of
thirteen shots in the short time of two
minutes. It is understood that this beats
not only the royal navy record, but the
world's record with n G-inch gun. The
skillful marksman and his squad received
a substantial prize in money irom the Ad
miralty for the achievement.
The gun itself is a fine one. for the petty
officer, who has since gone to England and
been raised to a warrant officer, made a
record with it last year.

_______
The Train-Robber Unperturbed When
His Doom Is Pronouncedâ Starts
for the Prison.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., March 17.â "Kid"
Thompson, the Roscoe train-robber, is at
last on "his way to San Quentin to be
banged for his crime. A remittitur from
the Supreme Court denying the appeal
from the judgment of the lower court was
received a few days ago, and tbe prisoner,
after eighteen months' confinement in the
County Jail, was taken before Judge
Smith to-day to hear the final order for
carrying out the judgment of the court
that he should.be hanged. The Judco set
May 22 as the datÂ« of the execution and
directed the Sheriff to deliver the culprit
to the Warden at San Quentin prison
within the next ten days, with instruc
tions to carry out the sentence.
Thompson's attorneys attempted to se
cure a further stay of execution pending a
hearing of the second appeal to the Su
preme Court, which is set for April 22.
This is an appeal from an order denying
a new trial, but the court refused to take
cognizance of it, as judgment had already
been affirmed. The date of the execution
was, however, act later than the hearing of
the apDeal, so that Thompson will not be
hanged before the Supreme Court has fully
passed upon his rights.
Sheriff Burr started north with the con
demned man this afternoon. Thompson
appears indifferent as to his fate. His
nerve never deserted him. The novelty of
being hanged seems to please him, al
though he still denies his guilt.
"My lawyers try to give me hope," he
said, "but I guess the jig's up with me.
I'll show them that I have sand. They
can break my neck, but they can't break
my heart."
STOCKTON ASYLUM SHORTAGE.
Legal Action Against the Bondsmen of Major
Orr WiU Be Prosecuted Vigorously
by the State.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 17.â Attorney-
General Fitzgerald has written to Presi
dent Southworth of the board of directors
of the State Asylum in reference to the
shortage of Major Orr while treasurer of
the asylum board. Mr. Southworth had
written a letter to the Attorney-General
urging him to take some action in the
matter, notwithstanding the fact that he
had been informed by Attorney Louttit,
representing the asylum board, and by
Governor Budd and Mr. Steffans, Mr.
Fitzgerald stated in his letter that he had
not acted because he had no official cogni
zance of the fact that there was a shortage
of over $10,000.
In his communication to Mr. South
worth the Attorney-General said that the
action would have to be commenced by
the Controller of the State, acting under
the direction of Governor Budd, and ad
vised the board to send a formal report of
the shortage to the Governor, in order that
tne latter micht direct tlie Controller to
institute proceedings against the bonds
men of Major Orr. Attorney Louttit will
be selected to prosecute the case for the
directors, representing the Attorney-Gen
eral in the proceedings.
Governor Budd, Attorney Louttit and
President Southworth had'a consultation
this afternoon relative to the communica
tion from Attorney-General Fitzgerald.
The matter of endeavoring to compel the
bondsmen of the former asylum treasurer
to make good the deficit; will now be
pushed, and they will either have to pay
the deficit or stand suit.
JSAMTA If Alt IS All A. ARKI'ST.
Alleged. Persecution of a Los Angeles
Mnti'a Girl- Wife.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 17.â A
newspaper reporter named Spencer was to
night arrested for disturbing the peace and
at a late hour was looking for bondsmen
with af air prospect of spending the night
in the city jail. A sad story is back of this
arrest. . .
Three years ago Spencer married a pretty
Santa Barbara girl named Mary Tucker,
the daughter of respected residents. Now
he is accused of having neglected his wife
and abused her and their baby. A few
weeks ago, when the young wife was ill,
her parents went to Los Angeles and
brought her and the child back to their
comfortable home. Spencer immediately
followed them and has subjected them to
series of petty persecutions and annoy
ances, including a card inserted in a local
paner warning people not to trust his wife
on his account. ,
To-day Spencer forced an entrance to the
house and undertook to gain forcible pos
session of his child, threatening his wife's
mother and sisters who came to her pro
tection. He was immediately placed under
arrest.
RELEASED AT JtAyNING.
The Slayer* of Miners Conover and Roof
Are Freed.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., March 17.â The pre
liminary examination of J. J. and T. R.
Nicholson on the charge of murdering
Miners Conover and Roof at the Lost
Horse mine was held before Justice Mor
ris at Banning last evening. The only evi
dence that could be adduced in the case
was the testimony of the Nicholsons, as
there were no witnesses to the tragedy.
Their story of self-defense seemed clear,
and the Justice decided that there were
not sufficient grounds for holding them for
trial in the Superior Court, and accord
ingly dismissed the case.
District Attorney Gill returned from
Banning this morning. He states that he
is satisfied that a trial would have resulted
in acquittal, and that it would therefore
have been unwise to put the county to the
needless expense.

TORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 17.â
The steamer Topeka arrived this morning
from Alaska after the most pleasant trip
since last summer, although three feet of
snow on a level is reported in Juneau and
Sitka. Among the passengers was Edward
McConnell, who is one of a party of four
that arrived from the Yukon just in time
to take the steamer for Puget Sound on
business and he will return north on the
same boat, going direct to the Yukon again.
His party brought out an outfit weighing
800 pounds with a sledge and six dogs, and
the mercury during: their 900-mile tramp
averaged 60 degrees below zero. They av
eraged nearly twenty-four miles a day, but
would not care to make the trip again. On
the way out they stopped over night with
the Ogilvie Canadian boundary survey
party, which treated them royally. At
times the mercury went as low as 72 de
grees.
McConnell will take six horses back with
him and establish a nacktrain between
Circle City and the diggings. He says the
official census of Circle City is 560 persons,
instead of about 1200 as claimed heretofore.
McConnell says that a Yukon miner
named William Fee and known among
all the miners there as "Missouri Bill,"
has made more discoveries than any other
ten men combined, two of his finds, at
Independence and Deadwood creeks, hav
ing already yielded over $100,000, and
"Bill" is stil! climbing over the moun
tains with a pack on his back looking for
new claims. He says the prediction made
by some people that the Birch Creek dig
gines would soon be worked out and that
Circle City would dry up and blow away
sound very funny to an old-timer like
himself. There is now enough in sight to
keep things humming for ten years, and
the surface of the ground has been but
barely scratched in a few places.
The number of women wintering at
Circle City this year is sixteen, most of
them being wives of traders or miners.
Those who are single remain so of their
own choice, as it is declared they could
have the pick of the entire camp.
McCi.iiieil predicts considerable suffer
ing and hardship among the Yukoners
during the present year. There are only
about forty-five days when actual opera
tions can be carried on and those who
strike nothing then will be helpless, as the
stores can sell for cash all the supplies on
hand, and they Lave entered into a com
pact to trust no miners. Wages, however,
run from $7 to $10 a day., teamster^ with
their teams getting $25 a "day. Quotations
are as follows: Flour $5 per 100 pounds,
bacon 40 cents a pound, su^ar 20 cents a
pound, beans 10 cents a pound, whisky 50
cents a glass, beer 2-5 cents a glass. A shave
costs 50 cents and a haircut $1.
Captain Healy of the steamer P. B.
Weare, which was reported in a dangerous
position in the ice at the mouth of Porcu
pine River and liable to be broken up with
the spring thaw, says she could not be in a
safer position and will again be in the ser
vice during the coming summer.
The steamer Topeka brought down a
box of bullion valued at $7-,000 from the
Douglas Island mines.
LEGAL STRIFE AT SANTA ROSA.
Lawyer Lynch Tries to Have Editor Ltm
mon died for Con
tempt
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 17.â The
case of Wesley Mock vs. Santa Rosa, grow
ing out of the water works contract dis
pute, was on trial here to-day before Judge
Dangerrield of San Francisco. Somtehing
of a sensation was created when Attorney
Lynch for the plaintiff read an editorial
from the Daily Republican of March 6, 1896, \
entitled, "Democratic Opposition." The
article is from the pen of A. B. Leramon,
editor of the Republican, and accused
Lynch, Judge Dangerrield and others con
nected with the case of being Democrats.
These statements, Lynch declared, were
false and contemptible. The language
used in the editorial, he said, was calcu
lated to bring the court into contempt, as
being biased by political motives. Lynch
wanted Editor Lemmon cited to appear
before the court to show cause why he
should not be punished forcontempt.
Judge Dangerrield said, in discussing the
editorial, that while it might be contempt
he did not believe it worth considering, and
consideration of it might aggravate the
case.
Falling in this direction, Lynch turned
his attention to Attorney Goodwin, the
counsel for Mayor Effcy of Santa Cruz, to
whom the contract for constructing the
water works was awarded, and a great part
of the afternoon was spent in trying to
get Goodwin to answer certain questions
regarding the Mayor's transaction with
the City Trustees. This the witness re
fused to do. on the ground that as Effey's
attorney all communication to him on
this line were privileged. An effort was
also made to prove that the Effey and
Garratt <fe Company bids for the con
struction of the water works were in the
same handwriting, and experts on hand
writing occupied the stand a part of the
day.
Public interest in this remarkable trial
is abating, and all of the political parties
stand pledged by their platforms to use all
honorable means to stop the litigation.

Closing Arguments to the Jury in the
John T. Janet Case.
CARSON, New, March 17.â Closing ar
guments to the jury in the case of John T.
Jones, on trial for complicity with Convict
James Heney in the theft of $23,000 worth
of bullion from the United States mint, |
occupied the entire day in the United
States court. Attorney Dennis for the de
fenae charged the shortage to Heney. j
Mr. Woodburn, leadine attorney for Jones, !
stated to the jury that the stealing of the
bullion lay between H^rsch Harris, the i
present melter and refiner, and Jones, the
defendant. General Clarke and United i
States District Attorney Jones took up the
â¢accusation and showed by Jones' accounts
that he was short $34,000 in 1893, before
Harris came to the mint.
Clarke, in his address to the jury, i
claimed that Heney stole ?29,000 in 1893, j
and vet Jones made no report of the short- f
age, because he was short himself and had i
to make bogus melts to cover both steal- â 
ings. The defense made the assertion that \
Harris made the bogus melt in March, yet (
his letter reporting a shortage and calling ,
for an investigation was written on Feb
ruary 15.
Clarke was talking for the Government
at 4 o'clock and willfinish his address to

WARDE AT PALO ALTO
Stanford Students Addressed by
the Favorite of the
Stage.
Evolution of the Drama Described and
the Great Actors of the
World Discussed.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., I
March 17. â The university chapel was â¢
crowded this afternoon as it has seldom
been before by an audience eager to hear
Actor Frederick Warde lecture on "The
Evolution of the Drama." Long before
the hour for the lecture arrived students
be.-an reserving their seats, and when ;
Warde was introduced, shortly after 2
o'clock, the room was tilled to the point of
suffocation.
Warde's discourse was delivered with all j
the grace, fluency and humor of which the
accomplished actor was capable. He said :
that from the earliest times a community
demanded amusement and the drama had
been created as a popular form of intel
lectual pleasure. As early as 500 B. C. â :
almost dating back to the Homeric era â
the drama couJd be traced back. In its
origin it was usually a song to the ruline
deities. These songs were sung or chanted
by bands of chorus singers. The Grecian
Thespius was the originator of a story in
verse. Half a century later J2*cbyius
introduced two persons with a chorus.
Sophocles and Euriptdes later introduced
the entire dramatis per-onae, perfecting,
as they believed, the drama. Music pre
dominated in the early drama, but has dis-
appeared now.
From Greece the drama went to Rome,
where it was patronized by the wealthy
for a time. Then it sank from sight, only
to be revived and fostered by the church.
It was uitilized to illustrate churchly
miracles and portray the sufferings of
Jesus Christ. Later the church became
antagonistic to the drama. Not until the
age of Elizabeth did the drama take its
rightful place as an art and an institution.
Shakespeare, the Immortal, then came
with that galaxy of wonderful dramatists.
The sovereigns, Elizabeth and King
James, became the patrons of the drama
which flourished as it had never done be
fore. Its growth was rapid until a check
came under the Puritan commonwealth.
When restored the drama lost its purity
and became vulgar and depraved, but for
tunately this did not last long.
Tragedy and comedy were the prevailing
plays of the time. Then arose Sheridan*
Knowles and his comedies. Realism en
tered to the disadvantage of art. A light
farce came to preface heavy tragedy, and a
low comedy closed the performance
French plays with social motifs were in
troduced with the burlesques; then came
the pantomime â all action being expressed
without the aid of the voice.
Realistic drama reached its height in
the railroad, water-tank, sawmill and
horse-race plays. Lastly, then, was the
farce-comedy, which combined the worst
elements of the farce, the burlesque and
the oomedy. Specialty performances are
most popular at the present day.
Mr. Warde closed with a discussion of
the great actors of the world and the char
acters in which they excelled.
INTJSitHED AT JTJtKSIfO.
The Bodies of Douglas K. and Francis V.
Mott Laid to Heat.
FRESNO, Cal., March 17.â A large con
course of Fresno's citizens took part in a
sad event to-dayâ the funeral of Douglas
K. and Francis C. Mott, brothers, who died
within three days of each other at Berke
ley, the elder, Douglas, going first. They
had lived in Fresno nearly all their lives
and were universally liked. With their
widowed mother they removed to Berke
ley, where recently Douglas K. Mott en
tered the university and his brother the
High School. Consumption claimed both.
The bodies were embalmed and brought
here last evening. The funeral took place
from thp Episcopal church. The proces
sion started from the church at 2 o'clock
p. M. The bodies were interred in one
grave in the town cemetery. The elder
brother was for more than a year a re
porter here on a local newsoaper. A sister
of the two young men died from con
sumption a year ago. A mother, sister
and brother survive them.

End* Life With a Bullet.
SANTA ROSA, Cai... March 17.â
Joseph Kirsch, a native of Germany, aged
58 years, committed suicide here to-aay
by shooting himself through the head.
Kirsch had resided in Santa Rosa for more
than thirty years, and for the past quarter
of a century had owned a barber shop
near the Grand Hotel on Main street.
FIRE ON DRUMM STREET
The Warehouse of Ames & Harris Seri
ously Damaged This
Morning.
The large warehouse of Ames & Harris,
at the northwest corner of Sacramento
and Drunim streets, was badly damaged
by fire this morning and the stock suffered
heavily' both from fire and water.
About la. m. flames were seen breaking
I from the windows in the fourth or top
story. An alarm was instantly erven at
the Harbor Police station, in an adjoining
block, and Policeman Cayot turned in a
signal from the tire box at California and
Drunim streets.
No time was Jost, but the flames made
great headway before the engines arrived.
A second alarm was then sounded, as the
fire began to assume alarming proportions.
Presently a dozen firemen were clamber
ing up the iron ladders or fire escapes of
the high brick building. They dragged a
hose line and a ladder to the roof and pro
ceeded to work, but hardly were they well
begun when flames burst from windows on
both sides of the iron escape and threat
ened to cut off their retreat.
Chief Bullivan ordered them down and
the men responded hurriedly, for they had
to pass between two .vails of name that
made the ladder almost unbearably hot.
The water tower was then called into
use, and with three combined streams
pouring through the top windows the fire
was soon under control.
The building was used as a bag, twine
and linen store by Ames& Harris and con
tained a large and valuable stock. The
loss was variously estimated at $25,000 to
$50,000, but no cause for the fire could be
ascertained.
John T. Doyle is the owner of the build
ing, which was erected in 1889. The fire
was confined to the fourth floor. How it
started is not known. The loss on the
building was $2000 and the loss on the
stock was about $20,000.
FOUND IN THE BAY.
The Body of an Unknown Man Rescued
From the Deep by it Fish
erman.
Nicholas Sylvania, a fisherman, found
the body of a man floating in the bay off
Fisherman's wharf yesterday. The Coro
ner's office was notified and the body was
removed to the Morgue. Ths hands were
tied with twine and the pockets of the
dead man's clothing were filled with
stones.
The body was that of a man of about 50
years of age, 5 feet 10 inches in height,
and weighing 160 pounds. The clothing
consisted of a dark coat and light trousers.
The body had been in the water some
time, as the features were greatly disfig
ured. Thouph the case is somewhat
strange, it is believed tnat the man com
mitted suicide. The body was not identi
fied in the afternoon.
Late last evening G. B. Larkin, who re
sides at 1124 Howard street, called at the
Morgue and recognized the remains as
those of William Giles, whom he had at
one time employed as a teamster. He
says that Giles was born in Boston and
was 55 years of ape at the time of his death.
Giles had frequently threatened suicide,
and told his friend that in case he was
missing not to worry as he intended to do
away with himself. Mrs. Barker, who re
sides at 309 Capp street, is a sister of de
ceased. She was informed by the Coroner
last evening of the death of her brother,
but she refused to have anything to do
â¢with the burial of the body.
OCEAN VIEW COURSING.
A First-Class Day's Sport at the San
Mateo County Resortâ The
Winners.
In spite of counter attractions the cours
ing men assembled at Ocean View Park
yesterday in large numbers and witnessed
running that has not been equaled for
months past. The hares were in the
finest possible condition and the high
grade hounds that were on the ground
gave the spectators a first-class day's
sport.
In the unfinished stake left over from
last Sunday D. Tweedie's dogs demon
strated their superiority by winning every
thing in sight without" a contest. White
Rustic beat Mascot and was withdrawn so
as to claim third, Tempest and Dublin
Stout taking the large end of tho purse.
A twelve-dog consolation followed in
which Snowbkd won first, Tempest second
and Bobolink, a Captain Morse pup, third.
Then a four-dog match at $2 50 each was
run, as follows:
Maud G beat Foxhall, Dublin Stout beat
White Rustic. .
Finaleâ Maud G beat Dublin Stout
Next Sunday a $1 stake, the drawing for
which will take place at 915 Market street
on Thursday evening, will be ran.
IRISH NATIONALISTS.
Brilliant Festivities of the Knights
of the Red Branch at Odd
Fellows' Hail.
The twenty-fourth grand anniversary
ball of the Irish Nationalists of San Fran
cisco under the auspices of the Knights of
the Red Branch was a success last evening
in every way.
Odd Fellows' Hall was resplendent with
yellow and green. Long streamers of
these colors hung from the center of the
ceiling to the galleries, and along the latter
was arranged green and yellow bunting,
varied by the flags of Erin and the stars
and stripes. The stage was banked with
flowers, the predominating colors being
the yellow and the green. Suspended
across the arch in yellow letters was the
iegend 'Knights of the Red Branch."
The shamrock was on every coat lapel
and in the corsage of every evening toilet.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of W. B. Shorten, chairman; J.
Murphy, P. J. Sullivan, M. Mannix, P.
Donohue, Ed O'Reily and J. Tracy.

November 9 and her captain reported that
on the following day the ship encountered
a very heavy gale with a very high cross
sea, which went clean over the vessel.
Six of the crew were injured and one,

The bark Columbia got into port last
night after severe weather on the passage.
PAINTERS AGAIN
ON A BIG STRIKE
Every Union Journeyman
Ordered to Quit Work
To-Day.
VERDICT OF THE BOSSES.
They Refuse to Comply With the
Demands Made by the
Union.
THE WOKKING-CARD SYSTEM.
The Building Trades Council Will
Without Doubt Take a Hand
in the Fight.
The Master Paintera' Association bas de
clined to accede to the terms of the union j
journeymen painters. This action will
probably Drecipitate one of the largest
trade union strikes ever witnessed in this !
City.
As previously stated in The Call the
journeymen demanded $3 as a minimum for
a day's wages for eight hours' work and a
recognition of the building trades work
ing card system. By the working card all
union workmen are prohibited from work
ing with non-union men. In other words
none but union men shall be employed.
The master painters have held several j
meetings of late ami sent a committee to j
confer with the Executive Board of the j
Painters' and Decorators' Union. That
meeting was held on Monday and last
evening the master painters committee |
made its report. Among the features in j
this report was that there may be one ap- j
prentice to every journeyman, one fore
man to eight men and one laborer to six
men.
The master painters after a long debate
decided not to adopt the committee's re
port, but to take the bull by the horns, so
to speak, and decline to comply with the |
principal demand of the union men, a rec
ognition of tne working-card system.
Their ultimatum was as follows:
San Franctsco. March 17, 1896.
At a special meeting of the Master Painters' ;
Association of the Pacific Coast, held March 17 ,
at the Builders' Exchange, after a due and I
careful consideration, it was unanimously
Resolved, That the demands of the Journey
men Painters' Union in regard to the card
system will not be recognized.
E. H. Black, President.
H. F. Wagner, Secreiary.
There were at the meeting master paint
ers Black, Kuss, Wagner, Onadt, Sulli- j
van Phillips, Herringer, McGovern, Me- |
Cord, Fraser, St. Denis, McCauly, C.
Staten, W. Eaton and about, ten others.
President E. H. Black after the meeting
was over said:
The men in reality have brought the trouble
upon themselves. From 1878 to 1880 they j
were working ten hours for $3. They struck j
for nine hours and then for $3 50. Later on :
they struck for eight hours. All of their de- |
mands were granted. A year ago vraces dropped j
through no fault of ours. While the standard
wages were $3 the men themselves fixed their ;
wages at $2 50 a day by offering to work for |
that amount. Even at this amount they are
tetter situated than they were when they were
getting $3 and $3 50 for nine and ten hours'
work. Living and ciOthing is much cheaper
now than then and more than makes up the
actual differecce. ,
They threaten us with t.he Building Trades |
Council, of which the Painters' Union is a
member, and talk about tying up all the build
ir.K trades in the City. With very few excep
tions, such as the Parrott building and one or
two similar jobs, the Building Trades Council
c&rd system cannot aflict us. All the carpen
ters, lathers and others are through witn a!
building before the painters can go to work, !
so they cannot tie up everything before there
il something to tie up. A lot of our other work !
Is painting where none of the other trades j
have been a,t work, such as old houses, etc. â¢
There is no doubt about our winning, for the j
public is with v.Â«.
Much has been said about the boss painters \
giving in, but those statements are badly ex- j
agge rated.
PAINTERS CALLED OUT.
All Union Men Ordered to Quit
Work at Once.
A copy of the foregoing decision of the
Master Painters was handed to Rose. Me-
Ivor, Merrill and others of the executive
board of the Painters' Union soon after
the meeting adjourned. The latter held a
caucus at once and a decision was quickly
arrived at.
It was decided to call out every union
painter on a general strike this morning,
and by 8 o'clock it is expected that every
job in the City will be tied up. The lead
ers are determined not to yield a single
point, and they claim that the support
promised to them will enable them to stop
all branches of the building trades until
the troubles are settled.
Another call has been made for all
the striking painters to meet at the Tem
ple for the pupose of further organizing
for aggressive work. Ibis meeting will oe
continued all day and the strike system
atized. â¢ The most important will be the
calling of a special meeting of the Build
ing Trades Council for. 8 o'clock to-night.
The council's working card system is to
go into effect on Aprill, and it is the pur
pose of the painters to have the council
order it to go Into effect at once. If this is
accomplished it will throw many thousand
men into the strike instead of 1100 or ll^OO,
the present strength of the painters. The
council has already pledged itself and its
union.? to do this if the occasion de
manded.
A UNION MASS-MEETING.
The Painters Will Hold a Great
Demonstration Next Saturday
Evening.
The meeting of the striking painters in
the Temple at 115 Turk street was not so
large yesterday as usual. This was not
because they were losing interest in the
strike, but because the large majority of
the union men are at work in the union
shops, where the bosses have given in to
all union demands. There was no lack of
interest, however, and several important
measures wtre discussed, and consequently
there were fewer reports made than usual.
J. F. Keefe of Sutter street was reported
as havine given in to all demands of the
union. He has been one of the most stub
born of all the bosses in holding out
against the strikers.
H. A. Hernnger of 813 Larkin street
states that he never declined to p.iy less
than the union's ruling rate of wages.
The polishers 1 committee reported that
another visit had been made to the Par
rott building, and that the committee had
found William A. Henry of 11 Clinton
street, "Russian Sam" and a man from
Oakland imported by Kuss. These
three men defied the "union. There are
four mim working for Breskcy of the San
Francisco Furniture Company. It was
recommended that immediate steps be
taken to tie up the work in all its branches.
It was deemed inadvisable at present to
take such a step with regard to the Parrott
building. On April 1 the Building Trades
Council's card system will go into effect
and then the council will act.
The following letter was read and
caused the painters to applaud heart
ily and extend a vote of thanks to the
Berkeley carpenters:
United Brotherhood of Carpenters*
and Joiners of America,
Berkeley Union No. 22. March 16. J
To R. T. Mclvor of Painters' and Decorators'
Union. San Francisco: Whereas, at a meeting of
L. U. 23 of Berkeley, U. B. of C. and J. of A. it
was brought to our notice that the painters
and decorators of San Francisco were on a
strike for living wages and the recognition of
the card system, it was resolved to extend a
donation of $50 to. the painters and decorators
to help carry the strike'to a successful issue.
We have been organized but a short time, so
our donation is necessarily not large. Wish
ing you every success and hoping for an early
settlement of your troubles, we remain yours
fraternally. J. T. Langlais, president; P.
Steedman, secretary; J. V. McSheehy.
R. T. Mclvor, the walking delegate, in
troduced a resolution which was heartily
supported by the painters. It was that a
big inass-meetine be held of all the unions
under the auspices of the Painters' and
Decorators' Union next Saturday cv. ning
in the Metropolitan Temple. He said that
he was sure that all the unions in the
building trades would turn out in a body,
and he was confid nt that the other labor
unions would do likewise. For over a
week the painters have been making a
fight to better their condition and they
have been moraliy and financially sup
ported by every union man in the City.
The mass-meeting, he believed, would be a
fitting celebration of a victory whirh will
no doubt be a fact by that time. If by any
chance the victory is not won by Saturday
night, it will be a fitting occasion to show
the people of the country the strength of
the union and how it is supported by the
other labor unions. Every union in this
State has some grievance that should be
corrected, and now that the first heavy
blow has been struck, is the right time to
impress upon the minds of all workire
men the importance of regulating their
differences. In brief, if the present fight
is won the mass meeting will be a celebra
tion of the victory. If the strike is still
on it will be to further enlist the sympathy
of the public In general.
The motion was carried unanimously.
President Hutchinson of Carpenters'and
Joiners' Union No. 483 stated that on Sat
urday evening there will be a mast-meet
ing of all the carpenters' unions at 115
Turk street to elect a business agent, vice
Johnson, resigned. He said that the busi
ness would no doubt be hastened if the car
penters should attend the painters' mass
meeting in a body.
It was decided that all the painters as
semble at 115 Turk street at 7 o'clock Sat
urday evening, and with band and banners
march through the principal streets and
then to Metropolitan Temple. A commit
tee was appointed to arrange the details,
consisting of Mclvor, Danielson, Merrill,
Bean and Postler.
One of the painiers, who had become im
patient at the delay on the part of the
master painters to make a settlement of
the troubles, moved that every painter at
work in the City be called from his work
pending a settlement of the strike. His
motion received no support, as the painters
declared that it woulu be breaking faith
with those who have acceded to all the
terms on the journeymen's promise that
they would not be moiested.* Besides, an
answer is expected from the bosses at any
hour.
Another resolution was passed that will
be a severe blow to all non-union men who
have ignored the union and may in the fu
ture desire to become a member. It was
thut after Monday next the initiation fee
shall be raised from 25 cents to $10. Ever}
one favored the resolution. A similar law
has been passed by several of the carpen
ters' unions. This increase in the fee is
intended to prevent backsliding on the
nart of those union men who frequently
join a union when they have a desire tb
better their condition and drop out when
they have gained their point.
A resolution to start a strikers' relief
fund by assessing those who are at work
was laid over, as the situation i.Â« not yet
serious enough to warrant such an action.
A vote of thanks was extended to the
Labor Bureau Association for the use of its

STRIKERS DEFIANT.
Ready to Compete and Take Palnt-
Ingr Contracts.
R. T. Mclvor as spokesman for the exec
utive board last night made the following
statement:
While we expected a different ver.Uct from
the master painters we are not so very greatly
surprised at their actton. It was a unanimous
verdict, as I have been informed. However,
since they have declared for a battle we will
give them all they want and more, too.
We will hit them a hard blow by entering
into the market with them and making con
tracts with the property-owners direct. We
will take all unfinished contracts and make
new ones wherever we can at terms that they
cannot meet. We will work 'or SI a day if neces
sary, the property-owners .urnishing the ma
terial, and we will do better work than was
ever done before.
We have nothing to lose, for we are not mak
ing over $7 a week on an average, and we have
everything to gain.
As to our plnns for the present we will do
just as we have mapped out â call out all of the
painters in the morning and call a meeting of
the Building Trades' Council. We will invite
io this meeting representatives of all sympa
thetic unions in the City.
I have no doubt that we can stop all building
work in this City and force the bosses to come
to terms or go out of business altogether.
This verdict by the master painters is not by
them alone. The delay in giving an answer to
us was to enable them to confer with the other
building contractors.
This verdict is the verdict of all the contract
ors, and means no thi tier but a slap in the face
at the Building Trades Council working-card
system. It has roachea this point that our
fight is the council's flght, for if we fail they
will go down with us, and they, line the paint
ers, have everything to gain and nothing to
lose.
STRIKERS IN COURT.
Tho Preliminary Examination of D.
J. McÃea Commenced Before
Judge Low.
The first case against the striking lathers
in connection with the affray on Post
street, near Larkin, on Tuesday of last
week came up before Judge Low yesterday
afternoon.
1). J. McÃea appeared for his prelimi
nary examination on the charge of assault
.with intent to commit murder, the com
plaining witness being Peter Trade. Attor
ney Coleappeared as special prosecutor and
Attorney Gallagher represented the de
fendant.
All the other defendants were in court
and a large number of their friends.
The witnesses examined for the prose
cution were Walter Trade, Peter Trade and
James McCluskey, who testified to the
assault upon Peter and that McÃea struck
him with a lath. Dr. Johannsen testified
as to Peter's injuries, and Christopher
Moorehonse, who has the contract for
plastering the house, testified to discharg
ing McKea and employing Trade and
Cahill. He also admitted that he had
employed special counsel to prosecute the
defendants.
As the defense intimated there would be
about fifteen witnesses to testify it was
agreed to continue the case till Wednesday
of next week.
AGAINST THE RANCHES.
Petition Presented to the Board of
Health by South San Francisco
Property-Owners.
The efforts of the South San Francisco
property-owners to have the hog ranches
removed to limits beyond the residence
districts have not been abated, and peti
tions to the Board of Health calling atten
tion to the vile condition of the ranches
are sent in daily.
The following communication from the
residents south of Butchertown was re
ceived by the Board of Health yesterday:
To the Honorable Board of Healthâ Gentlemen:
We, the undersigned residents of this City and
County, and living near the hog ranch con
ducted by Charles Juhl and Henry Seimerg. on
the corner of Eighth avenue and H street
south, do hereby respectfully petition your
nonorable board to take action in regard to
the nuisance hereinafter mentioned. The said i
hog ranch has proved very offensive to us.
Wo are reliably informed that a member of the
family of one of the owners of said ranch is
now seriously ill.
We believe said sickness to have been caused
by the unhealthy surroundings of the place.
We are apprehensive of our own health, and
we find the stench arising from the pens on
tne establishment to be very offensive to us,
and if the present nuisance is not abated we
will be forced to move elsewhere. A large
amount of slush is created there, and one of
the children of one of the undersigned was
nearly drowned in the same a short time ago.
We could make other complaints in regard
to said ranch, but the same being easily ob
served by any one who may go there, we
know that a short inspection of said place will
convince you of the merits of our complaint.
We respectfully ask that you take immediate
action in said matter. Respectfully,
J. P. Peterson, G. F. Remniers. H. T. Gilberry,
Mrs. T. Remmefs, E. J. Stone, H. Anderson,
Mrs. F. Siemer, Dan Larsen, C. J. Jorgensen,
H. Hunter, Harold Paine, Thomas Gable, Mrs.
F. Freitas, Mrs. Burnell.
Inspector Kinney will investigate the
matter to-day and report to the board at
its next meeting.
MAHONEY WAS UGLY.
The Pusilint and Ex-Fireman Attacks
Theodore Van Buskirk and
Eddie Hanlin.
Daniel Manoney, pugilist and ex-fire
man, was arrested yesterday morning by
Policeman F. W. Riley on the charges of
assault with a deadly weapon aud battery.
Theodore Van Buskirk, the champion
heavy-weight of the Olympic Club, and
Eddie Hanlin were on their way down
town from their rooms at 1109 Larkin
street when they overtook Mahoney at the
corner of Ellis street. Mahoney was in
toxicated, and either purposely or acci
dentally brushed against Van Buskirk, who
stepped aside. As he did so Mahoney
pulled a revolver out of his pocket and
flourished it in a threatening manner in
front of Van Buskirk.
Being unarmed, the Olympic Club
champion hastily placed a telegraph pole
between himself and Mahoney. This dis
concerted Mahoney and he turned his
attention to Hanlin, pushing the barrel" of
the revolver against his breast. Hanlin
grabbled with him and threw him to the
f round. Van Buskirk then stepped from
ehind the telegraph pole and helped
Hanlin hold Mahoney till Policeman Riley
appeared and placed Mahoney under
arrest.
Neither Van Buskirk nor Hanlin seemed
willing to prosecute Mahoney, but upon
the advice of JudÂ«e Joachimsen, who was
passitig at the time of the arrest, they
changed their minds. They could give no
reason why Mahoney should have shown
a desire to shoot them, as they are ac
quainted with him.
VALLEY ROAD FINANCES
Not a Single Delinquency in the Call
for the Fifth Assessment on
the Stock.
Every dollar levied by the fifth assess
ment on the stock of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railroad Company
has been paid. It was a call for 10 per
cent of the full amount of the stock issued;
or $244,000. The assessment was made
payable on the 9th inst. and would become
delinquent on the 26th, but every stock
holder had by yesterday met his obligation.
There has now been paid in just half of
the total amount of the face value of the
stock that has heen' issued, or $1,220,000.
All of this has gone to pay for actual con
struction of the road aiui apart of its equip
ment. It has provided for, among other
things, the material used in construction
as far as Fresno, the locating or surveying
of the road to Bakersfield, three locomo
tives, 150 freight cars and the boarding out
fit for the men at the front, consisting of
two dining-room cars.
Owing to the absence from the City of a
number of the directors of the road the
regular weekly meeting, which is usually
held on Tuesday, was postponed yesterday
until to-day.
THE FAIR CASE.
Judge Slack Decides That It Shall Go
On To-morrow Morning.
The Fair case has gone over until to
morrow morning, when the exact position
of the proponents of the pencil will will be
argued and perhaps ascertained.
All the attorneys were present in court
when Mr. Delrnaa rose and asked for a con
tinuance. He had not been supplied with
a copy of the proceedings of the day before,
he said, and he could not go on intelli
gently without thatinformation. Mr. Pier
son objected, but Mr. Delmas reminded
him that he had waited fourteen months
before offering the will, and that an ex
planation of his sudden nastb would be in
order.
Then Judge Slack announced that he
would take the case up to-morrow morn
ing, and in the meantime Mr. Delmas will
be given a copy of the testimony.
For Stealing Cattle.
Ella Keith, alias Garcia, was arrested yester
day on a warrant issued by a Benicia Justice
of the Peace charging her w ith felony embez
zlement. She formerly worked on the ranch
oi S. Rossi, Van Sycklen Island, Sacramento
River. About three months ago she shipped
fifteen head of cattle belonging to her em
ployer to this City and sold them, appropriat
ing ihe proceeds. She claims that she worked
on the ranch for two years at .foO per month
wages, but Rossi ouly paid her $60, and she
toot the cattle in part payment of what was
due her.

Grass Valley the Home of
the Happy One.
But it Was Not in Gold That
He "Struck It."
IT IS FUNNY TO WATCH THE MAN WHO
goes out to make his fortune in a way that
Is ' 'out of the groove." Sometimes he will ap-
pear in the guise of a lottery fiend ; again ha
will appear as a dabbler in stocks ; anet he is to
be found as a gold mine prospector, and he has
been heard of as trying to find gold on goose-
berry bushes. In any case he is a man without
an objectâ a careless, reckless and usually
worthless chap, whose duty to humanity (in
his mind) is made up of getting rich at some
one else's expense. That is not the type of
man, though, who carries his life in his hand
from day to day, and who really works hard to
secure fortune's favors. He is usually a ster-
ling, whole-souled fellow, fearing nothing,
though he risks much. One of the sterling sort
of searchers after "luck" who has recently
"struck It rich" is Mr. A. Burton of Grass Val-
ley. He was unable to pursue his arduous call-
Ing as a miner because he was prostrated with
a serious disease. He thought there was no
relief for him and he began to look at death as
a certainty. He had not heard cf the grand
old Hudson Medical Institute then. But he
went there and he is cured now. ''Health is
more than wealth." His good fortune was
health. In a letter to the managers of that
great institution he, says :

See how with "hard times" practically stariu*
him in the face, this decent fellow expresses
his thanks for what has been done for him by
the skilled physicians at the great institute
which is located at thecornerof Market, Stock-
ton and Ellis streets. And he is only one
among many thousands of decent, grateful
men. For instance, among those who have re-
cently felt impelled to thank the specialist*
for what had been done for them:
S. J. Bailey of Weaverville says: "After two
months' treatment by you I feel fully restored
to health."
K. C. Taft of Stowe, Cal., says: "I am feeling
fine without a sign of the disease now."
J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah, writes: "I am
very pleased to say that I am cured of thÂ«
terrible disease I had."
There is not a single State or Territory in thÂ«
Union from which equally satisfactory indorse-
ments do not come, and it is now becoming to
be a proverb (for it is pare aDd unadulterated
truth) that if you are ill and can be cured TH^

Argument of the Attorney-

AGAINST THE RAILROAD
A Day Devoted to Defense of
the Railway Commis

THE LEASES AND CONTRACTS.
Review of the Laws Bearing on the
Consolidation of the Western
Lines.
Attorney - General Fitzgerald argued
through the entire session of the United
Attorney-General Fitzgerald Arguing the Railroad Case Before Judge Mckenna in the United States
Circuit Court Yesterday.
[From a sketch by a ''Call " staff artist.]
States Circuit Court yesterday, presenting
to Judge McKenna the side of the defense
in the case of the Southern Pacific Com
pany aeainst the California Railway Com
mission.
This case is the fight of the railroad
company for a permanent injunction to
restrain the commission from ordering re
ductions in the wheat transportation rates.
The railroad representatives were pres
ent in force, and several other lawyers re
mained in court to listen to the eloquent
piesentation of the arguments for the
people.
The Attorney-General began by review
ing the story of ths great Western railroad
system, with the consolidation of the Cen- i
tral Pacific and Union Pacific roads, the |
California Pacific road, the South Pacific
Coast road and the Northern and Northern
. California roads.
But for the consolidation of this system
of roads each of the railways would be an

independent power, and would be in com
petition with the others. The rivalry
would make the roads better for the
people.
Some of the leases, he stated, he would
hold to be void, because they were exe
cuted without the express authority of the
powers granting the franchise. The Cali
fornia Pacific and South Pacific Coast
leases would be regarded as void, because
they were executed prior to the legislative
amendment of the charter in ISBB.
At that time, he would hold, the com
plainant had no power to enter into that
kind of contract in this State. He ex
pected to show that the Southern Pacific
Company of California is operated at a
profit and pays deficits of the other di
visions.
The Central Pacific, he averred, is both a
Federal corporation and a State corpora
tion. In the Government bill of in
tervention it was held to be a Federal
corporation. It is different from the Union
Pacific, which is wholly a Federal corpora
tion. In the view that he presented it is a
California corporation, but is also operated
under important and valuable franchises
from the United States, which brings it
under the Federal control.
The Southern Pacilic Company of Cali
fornia is alleged in the bill of intervention
to be a California corporation, which is
true in the same sense of the Central Pa
cific. On account of its franchise the lease
could not be executed without consent of
the Government.
Mr. Fitzgerald then took up the consid
eration of the right of Federal corpora
tions or State corporations acting under
Federal franchises to convey by lease for a
long term of years all their property and
franchises to another corporation, or to
the Southern Pacific Company. He ar
gued that the execution of these leases
without permission from the powers cre
ating the corporations was void.
"Has the State of California ever given
power for the lease of these railroads?"
was the point of the argument at the be
ginning of the afternoon session. The
Attorney-General discussed the question
at great length and cited case after case in
support of the position maintained by
him. The quotation of authorities occu
pied the entire afternoon.
The argument by Mr. Fitzgerald will be
resumed this morning.
POVERTY AND DRINK.
Mrs. McNamara Arrested for Cruelty
to Children.
Mrs. Kate McNamara, 41 West Mission
street, was arrested yesterday by OfficeTs
Holbrook and McMurray of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
on the charge of cruelty to her children.
Recently her husband, James McXamara,
a painter, fell off a scaffolding and his leg
was so badly injured that it had to be
amputateo. Since then he lias not been
able to support the family, and they have
been livine in filth and squalor, while the
mother was in a constant state of inebriety.
There are four children, Mary, 16 years
of age, John 11, Katie 7 and Annie 5.
Mary ran away from home about a week
ago.'and yesterday the officers found her
in the house of Mrs. Smith, 213 Twelfth
street. There are only two beds in the
house and Mrs. Smith, her three grown-up
daughters, the girl McNamara and a man
named Gorman, who claims to be Mrs.
Smith's husband, occupied them.
Mary McNamara was booked at the City
Prison for the Magdalen Asylum and Mary
Smith, 17 years of age, one of Mrs. Smiths
daughters, was booked for vacrancy. The
three other McNamara children were sent
to the Youths' Directory.
WAS IN GOOD STANDING.
An Interesting Decision Rendered by
Judge Hunt.
Judge Hunt has rendered a decision of
considerable interest to lodge members.
He says when a man is not given the
chance to pay his dues he cannot be held
in arrears.
The decision was in the case of Mrs. F. j
Miller, who was suing the E : .ntracht Bund â¢
for $800 due upon the benefit policy of her j
husband, who was before his death a mem
ber of the bund. The policy was rejected j
because Miller was said to be delinquent, i
His death occurred on January 12, 1895, !
and he had not yet paid his dues for the |
December before; but Judge Hunt holds !
that his dues, while due on the first meet
ing in December, were not delinquent until
the last meeting. The day for the last I
meeting fell on Christmas and the first j
meeting in January fell on January 1, a j
legal holiaay. Miller was dead before the
next meeting night and Judge Hunt ruled
that he was in good standing, having had !
no chance to pay his dues before the time â¢
of payment expired.

The negotiations for the consohda- |

the estate is contained in a promissory note
made by Maurice Dore for $5446 80. There
arebther smaller notes and quite a number of
no value. Most of these notes grew out or the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, J896.
ENERGY IN THE MISSION
A Progressive Spirit Permeates
the People of the South
ern Side.
AND TAXATION IS NO OBJECT.
Schools, Parks and Boulevards Wanted
in the Warm Belt
District.
The people of the Mission were over
joyed yesterday on learning through Thk
Call that their hopes in regard to im
proved school accommodation were in a
fair way to be realized. The district has
long needed a hinh school. The prospect
of securing a public park also deliguted
the residents.
Joe Scheer, who resides at 412 Liberty
street, was overjoyed at the prospect of the
contemplated advancement now being
pushed with vigor on behalf of the Mission.
He said : "We have for the past thirty
five years contributed more than our share
of taxes for the benefit of the western por
tion of the City. We have without grum
ble or grudge paid our assessment for the
purchase of and the continuous improve
ment of Golden Gate Park. And yet, until
quite recently, vre could not take our fami
lies there without being compelled to pay
C. P. Huntington's compauy two fares,
which to a workingman with a large fam
ily made a big hole in his week's wages.
"We have been neglected in our supply
of water and gas, and with the exception
of a few streets on the lower section, be
tween Valencia and Harrison streets, had
really no good streets.
â¢'Had it not been ior sucn men as Judge
Van Keynegom and others we would yet
be without car accommodation west of
) Valencia street. Churcn street was opened
to fifteenth only. By the assistance of
Judge Van Keynegom the Mission people
purchased from the Roy heirs sufficient
land to extend Church, street, and after
buying the land they deeded it to the City
for a public street. The amount of money
j raised b} r the property-owners between
! Seventeenth and Twenty-sixth streets, on
J the line of Church street, was about $2500.
I This we paid out of our pockets rather
I tnan go arguing with the Supervisors for
I an appropriation.
"Now, we want something in return,
| and what we do want is a high school for
our big children and a park for our little
ones and their mothers, so that we need
not go out to Golden Gate Park for a lung
ful of good, pure :iir."
James D. Phelan, one of the progres
sive youiig men and extensive property
owners, added his views to the subject in
the following words:
"The Mission has many claims on the
City at large and should receive the atten
tion of the City Fathers.
"The early missionaries chose it as the
most desirable spot on the peninsula for
residence and it is historic. Electric and
other railroads are drawing San Francisco
closer to San Mateo and better roads are
demanded, and through the Mission all
this new traffic must pass. It is on the
line of growth. Its climate and the extent
of its territory, running indefinitely south,
is the only outlet to the City, and it
should be made attractive so that growth
may be stimulated. The City will get the
benefit in increased population and values
for taxation. The population will come
from the bay towns, as Oakland. Alameda
and San Rafae!, where people go for
climate. But we must have a high school,
as we now have other schools, and a
branch library; and we must have a park
for children and families who are neces
sarily compelled to live on narrow lots.
Other parts of .the City are so favored and
we simply demand our rights and fair
treatment."
George D. Shadburne, a prominent at
torney and a moving spirit in improving
the southern portion of the City, gave his
views on this subject as follows:
"We of the southwest portion of the
Mission are twenty-five years behind the
age. Had it not been for Judge Yon
Reynegom, Major B. Kinney, T. V.
O'Brien and a few other go-ahead citizens
we of the outside Mission district would
be burning tallow candles or coal-oil and
drawing water out of wells with a bucket
and rope unless we were able to erect a
windmill.
"Even now there are not water mains
throughout the entire Mission district.
Where I live, on Twenty-fifth street and
Hoffman avenue, the Spring Valley Water
Company is just putting in pipes, and it is
but a short time since we got the gas out
there.
â¢'So disgusted over these things have I
got that 1 have made up my mind to sell
my property in that section and move into
the City, so to speak. I have bought a
home on California street, where I intend
to live the balance of my time. I have got
tired fighting for improvements in the
Mission, yet 1 am glad to see The Call
take its present stand in aid of improving
not only the Mission but the whole City.
"The southern portion of the City covers
one-half of the area of the City with two
thirds of its population, and yet there is
no high school or public park, while the
Western Addition, that was not inhabited
when the Mission district was well settled,
has parks and schools and good streets.
"Even proper police protection has been
denied the people out in the Mission until
very recently. With all this many of our
progressive citizens throw back their
shoulders and say, 'Time and patience
will make all things right.' This may be,
but we of the Mission have doubts as to
the principle and rather believe in 'Dura
vivimus vivanaua' (Let us live while we

live). This is our home, and we should
make it attractive and worth living in.
"The boulevard that we are going to
have od Folsom street from Sixth to Nine
teenth is a movement in this direction.
This will cost about $35,000. Bat this is a
small recompense for the thousands of
dollars that the Mission property owners
have paid in taxes for improving other
portions of the City."
Ex-Sheriff C. S. Laumeister is in full ac
cord with the spirit of improving the
southern portion of the City. He said
when spoken to on the subject: "Why,
of course 1 am in favor of the high school
and of the park and of everything that
will tend to improve San Francisco and
make it attractive.
"Suppose that the taxes are a few cents
in excess of what the people have been
paying. This is nothing as compared to
the amount of money that is taken out of
San Francisco yearly by her own people
who go traveling looking for pleasant
places to spend the summer. If this or a
portion of it were spent at home to make
improvements and beautify this City we
would more than make up what we pay in
taxes by having F,astern people come out
hereto see our beautiful City. And when
they did come and see for themselves that
in addition to our climate we had an ele
gant city they would settle here and invest
their money in our products.
"The time has come when San Fran
cisco should cast off its boys' clothing and
assume man-like proportion. We are
no loneer an overgrown village, but a big
city. Therefore let us get to work and im
prove every portion of it, the Mission in
cluded; build schools, open and improve
the public parks, pave the streets with th 6
very best material, and make San Fran
cisco an ideal city in fact as well as in
name."
Ex-Supervisor C. W. Taber of the Mis
sion is in fuil accora with those of his sec
tion of the City in desiring to improve
not only the Mission, but the entire City.
He said :
"We should have a boulevard running
from the Mission out to the park and
round the beach to the Presidio, where
another park should be. Again. Park
Hill should be improved and a sloping
drive made into the proposed park in the
Mission.
"The people of one accord should wake
up and bring San Francisco in touch with
other big cities. See what progress and
improvement has done for Los Angeles
and other places throughout the State,
and all this time San Francisco is retain
ing its round-headtd cobblestones and
wooden sidewalks, while the people who
ran afford it go elsewhere to hunt for nice
cities.
"But I am pleased to see that there is a
movement on foot to wake the people up
from a quarter of a century sleep into
which they have fallen, and while they
were asleep the City has been growing in
patches. The portions occupied by poor
people have had poor improvements and
the rich the reverse, until there is no simi
larity between any two sections, eicher in
the buildings or the condition of the
streets.
"It is time to change this mode of mak
ing a city great and attractive so as to at
tract the attention of strangers who come
among us."
The bedrooms of the Orient are far dif
ferent from those of Christendom. Fully
half the women of the world sleep upon
the floor of the ground, and even the rich
est of the ladies of Asia have never known
the luxury of hair mattresses and spring
beds. Most of these Mongolian beauties
do not know what a feather pillow means,
and the Japanese pillow consists of a
lump of wood about the size of a loaf of
bread, with a piece of soft paper tied on
the top of it, so that it will just fit into
Yum Yum's neck, and prop her head off
the floor.
Railway extension in Burmah is carried
on under exceptional difficulties. Tun
neling and rock-cutting work on the last
section of the Ma Valley Railway exten
sion has been stopped in consequence of
the Indian artisans and Burmah laborers
having absconded, the insalubrity of the
place and the high price and scarcity of
food supplies.

appearance in this City in combination.
For the past two years the clubs have not
been on exactly friendly terms, and the
feeling between them was aggravated last
year when the mandolin club went North
with Berkeley. All this has been changed,
and the clubs start on a triumphal tour
Thursday. AftÂ«r the concert in this City,
the clubs play in Oakland, Saturday night
in Fresno and Monday in Los Angeles.
Towns in the vicinity of Los Angeles will
be played next week, and on the return
trip Stockton will be visited.
Last year the San Francisco audience
was sent almost into convulsions over the
impersonations of Mile. Calliope Cardi
nale of the Mandolin Club. This year an
equally gifted humorist, Charles I. Dillon,
will take his place. Dillon has an inimit
able way of telling how "Christopher
Columbus Discovered America." It is said
to be worth walking ten miles to hear.
Two other soloists will appear. These are
Messrs. Phillip F. Abbott and W. Bittle
Wells. Abbott has a barytone voice with
much power and expression. Well 3 plays
for a violin solo one of his own composi
tions, a nocturne. Besides the solos there
will be numbers by the combined clubs
and special numbers by each club. The

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL..
It was a good day for St. Patrick and
everything was lovely.
If King Menelek were at all civilized he
would never lose this chance of making a
speech.
The Abyssinian crisis seems liable to
cave in at any moment and engulf all
Europe.
The Supreme Court is with the Ken
tucky company some of the time, but not
all of the time.
The Democratic State Committee cer
tainly ripped the local fight up the back,
but failed to kill it.
The Junta will find a profit in shearing
the Buckley lambs, but a bigger and safer
one in skinning them.
If the Cubans do not quit burning towns
they will not leave enough of the island
for anybody to recognize.
Senator Cannon of Utah began his Sena
torial career by firing hot shot at Hoke
Smith and the target was riddled.
If Kentucty Democrats had their way
there would be very little difference be
tween a Senatorial contest and a lynching
party.
Since the recent experience with the
State Committee Buckley's little lambs
have grown just about old enough to feel
sheepish.
The funding scheme has been so weak
ened in committee it will hardly be able
to get into the House, much less pass
through it.
England will march into Central Africa
to help Italy out, and perhaps Russia will
take a hand with Abyssinia to bounce
England out.
As that distinguished Kentuckian, Jack
Chirm, is less famous for talking than for
rutting, he should get his name changed,
to Jack Knife.
As the game looks at present McKinley
is standing pat on protection and Allison
is going him one better as the champion
of protection and reciprocity.
People who once thought Quay's candi
dacy was only a joker have now had time
to remember that the joker sometimes
takes the last trick and wins the game.
In placing the grand cordon of the Order
of St. George upon the breast of King
Menelek the Czar has shown his hand and
Europe sees it is against the Dreibund and
almost ready for war.
The Southern Pacific victory in Ken
tucky has been more than offset by the
people's victory in the Supreme Court.
The monopoly keeps its charter, bnt Cali
fornia can collect taxes.
Carlisle has written a letter on the
money question, but as no one can make
head or tail of it, there is no telling
whether it was intended as an entrance to
the Presidential campaign or a back out.
The settlement of the Venezuelan con
troversy has got far enough along for the
British Embassador and the Venezuelan
Minister to meet with Olney at dinner and
diplomacy has achieved another triumph.
From the promptness with which all
leading Democrats are declining the Presi
dential nomination it seems evident that
for that party at any rate it is going to be
a yellow dog year by the mere force of cir
cumstances.
As the Supreme Court has held that
California can collect taxes from railroads
within her borders, there is reason to ex
pect it will also sustain the right of the
State Railroad Commission to regulate
freights and fares within the State.
Notwithstanding the protests from the
provinces the French Chamber of Deputies
has approved the scheme fox an inter
national exhibition in 1900, and now if
France can only keep the peace of the
world until that time Paris will have her
show.
The expedition up the JJile seems foolish
and is sure to be costly, but after his re
cent experience of the isolation of Eng-
Jand Lord Salisbury may be willing to pay
even a greater price than that for the sake
of getting into touch with the Dreibund
and having allies in time of need.
Though there are no new developments
in the funding bill fight, and though Mr.
Huntington seems to have concluded to
keep his mouth shut for a while at least,
there are still urgent reasons why the
people should bear the light in mind.
When the monopoly is most silent is the
time when the people should be most
watchful.
As an illustration of the way the Demo
cratic tariff is helping farmers it is worth
noting that the wool shipments from
Great Britain to the United States aggre
gated over 13,000,000 pounds last January
against little more than 0,700,000 during
that month of the previous year. That
much of trade was lost to our sheep-raisers
and foreigner got it.
The Inter. Ocean is a Cullom paper, but
in commenting on the canvass of Senator
Allison it says: "Instead of fool friends
he has had friends who are as level headed
as they are loyal. Such a campaign Dolicy
doe* not foment trouble nor embarrass the
post-nomination campaign whoever bears
off the prize." To this praise it may be
added that Allison has won such friends
because he has been worthy oi them.
THE FUNDING TIGHT.
The contest over the railroad refunding
scheme has now reached a critical stage.
It has been so long protracted that to the
general public it has become as wearisome
as a twice-told tale. No new features have
developed of late, and there is danger of a
loss of interest on the part of some who
should be most interested. It is a time,
therefore, when all resolute opponents of
the scheme should be on their guard and
watchful of every move. There is no tell
ing what the cunning managers of the
monopoly interests may attempt as soon
as they believe the people's representatives
are no longer alert and determined.
Ie has been evident from the start that
I the policy of the railroad lobby has been
' to confuse the issue and divide public
I opinion as much as possible. Every con
â  ceivable trick likely to accomplish that
has been resorted to. Many different
schemes of refunding have been advanced
at one time or another. Persistent at
; tempts have been made to raise the ques
tion of Government ownership of the
j roads or some similar plan to distract
j attention from the one issue at stake.
i Over and over airain tne motives of the
! papers and of the men who oppose refund
ing have been aspersed, denounced and
s maligned. Almost every form of evil has
j been attributed to them and every effort
j made to weaken their influence with the
people, and particularly with Congress.
The one object of all these efforts has
been to so distract or confuse the minds of
the members of Congress that they would
become impatient with the subject and
adopt some scheme of the monopoly
simply to get rid of it. The railroad
organs in. Washington and in this City
have been working to that end >with great
vigor and with as much astuteness as they
are capable of. The words of prominent
men in different parts of the State have
been distorted and in some cases deliber
ately falsified for the purpose of mislead
ing Eastern Congressmen as to the pre
vailing sentiment of the State, and every
slur or slander that Huntington could put
forth against the supporters of law and
justice has been repeated and harped on
by his organs in this City with the hope
that even in this State men might be
divided in opinion and rendered the more
easy victims of a scheme that would place
their industries and their commerce in the
power of an exacting monopoly for a cen
tury to come.
The incessant repetition of these mis
statements or deliberate slanders are but
repeated warnings to the people of what
they may expect if they become divided
or cease to be vigilant. Though no new
developments may arise to-day or to-mor
row, there is no telling when the monopoly
may attempt a great stroke and try to rush
a bill through Congress without giving
time for debate or full consideration. That
is the danger ahead. That is the feature
of the contest which to all resolute de
fenders of the people makes it more inter
esting in this seeming quietness than it
has ever been before.
REGULATING STREET RAILROADS
The Oakland City Council is considering
and will doubtless pass an ordinance pro
hibiting the passing of streetcars at street
crossings and requiring that the speed of
meeting cars shall not exceed three miles
an hour. This is well so far as it goes, but
no provision for fenders seems to have
been made. Even as it is, however, Oak
land has gone considerably beyond San
Francisco in protecting the lives of the
people.
The report made by the committee from
the New York State Assembly appointed
to investigate the methods of street rail
way management in the larger cities of
the State should make very good reading
for the Merchants' Association of Ran
Francisco. Passing over that part of the
report which recommends measures pro
hibiting the excessive capitalization of
roads and the adverse report on municipal
ownership, we may glance at the part de
voted, to other matters of particular local
interest. The committee found that the
payment of a lump sum or a percentage of
receipts for franchises was very undesir
able, and that the experiment of having
companies bid against each other for
franchises by offering a percentage of gross
receipts had been found a failure.
In lieu of all other means for disposing
of franchises the committee recommended
that franchises be sold by lease for a stated
periodâ say thirty yearsâ at public auction
to the company offering the lowest rate of
fare, further reductions to be provided for
when justified by receipts, the State Rail
road Commission to be the arbiters in case
of disagreement between the city and the
company. Further recommendations ad
vocated the sale of thirty tickets for $1,
good between 6 and 8 a. m. and 5 and 7
v. m. whenever the roads' finances enable
them to pay 5 per cent dividends on their
capital stock. Fenders were strongjy
urged. On petition of fifty citizens the
Mayor should have the power to compel
an improvement of the service.
The effect of such regulations would be
a radical change from the unrestricted
power which the companies of San Fran
cisco are now permitted to exercise. The
practical operation of our jaw requiring
franchises to be sold to the highest bidder
has been found to be a failure. The sug
gestion that the company offering the low
est fare should be given the franchise is a
recognition of the principle that any
charge levied by the municipal govern
ment for the exercise of the franchise is a
direct and indirect tax on the people and
that the plan of the lowest fare is a
straightforward way of letting the people
enjoy the benefit of any competition which
may arise for a given franchise. Placing
the franchise on the basis of a lease in
stead of a perpetual right permits of
periodical adjustments by the municipal
ity in the interest of the people.
A LAST MESSAGE.
Among the reports from Armenia none
has been of a nature to cause a profounder
or more lasting impression upon the
Christian world than that whicb has just
made known a letter prepared by the
Gregorian clergy at Urfa at a time when
they stood in the shadow of impending
death and knew that within a brief time
the fearful fate the fanatic Moslems had
dealt out to their brothers would fall upon
them.
Only a brief extract from the letter has
been telegraphed, but that is full of solemn
significance to the civilized world. "A
short time ago," wrote the doomed priests,
"nobody could have believed that at the
end of this nineteenth century a Christian
people could, on account of their loyalty to
Christian civilization, under the very eyes
of Christendom be exterminated by Mos
lem power. Yet just this fearful tragedy
is being consummated to-day and we are
the unhappy victims. We see no signs of
relenting on the part of our destroyers and
no hand is raised or reached out to rescue
us. We have only to say farewell to any
wbo have loved and cared for us and pre
pare ourselves for death, counting our
selves honored in being called to seal our
faith with our lives."
A few days after this letter was sent out
the archpriest and four of the clergy who
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 1890.
signed it were put to death. The letter,
therefore, was almost literally sealed with
blood. It comes to the Western world as a
message from the dead and draws an
added influence from the martyrdom of
those who wrote it. The apoeal it contains
will be sure to find a response somehow
and some time from the great heart of
humanity. Evil triumphs for a time, but
sooner or later justice is done and all the
sooner when the evil becomes so great as
to render itself intolerable and abhorrent
to the common instincts of men.
THE SECRETAKY'S LETTEE.
The letter addressed by Secretary Carlisle
to Congressman Patterson of Tennessee
was evidently intended for publication,
and was doubtless the result of an under
standing between the two gentlemen. Mr.
Patterson had written to Mr. Carlisle ask
ing for his statement concerning the
charges made by Congressman Crisp that
the Secretary had abused his power in dis
criminating against silver and in Tavor of
gold in the handling of treasury funds.
Mr. Carlisle has made the desired state
ment, and its publication would not have
occurred without his consent. The Secre
tary has made a very able defense, which
on its face appears to be a refutation of
Mr. Crisp's charges. He asserts that in
stead of discriminating against silver he
has really favored it, going to the length
of making the Government bear the ex
press charges on silver seat out in redemp
tion of silver certificates on treasury notes
of 1890, deposited for that purpose, while
requiring all who demand gold to pay for
its transportation.
as Secretary Carlisle is understood to be
the one particular candidate of the Cleve
land administration for the Presidency,
thi.s amusing letter has a special interest.
If it prove 3 nothing more it shows that
the pressure of silver advocates is hurting
the golden coVns of the administration
and that the Cleveland wing of the Dem
ocracy is anxious for the friendship of the
silver men. But the Secretary's ingenious
letter will hardly deceive the South and
the North. Nothing that he can write
will undo the blazoned record of the ad
ministration of which he is the chief lieu
tenant. It is even conceivable that the
able Secretary, while supporting tbe single
gold standard on the broader lines which
have so firmly established it, deliberately
performed all the minor acts friendly to
silver which he has narrated, for the sole
purpose of being able to produce for pub
lication the interesting letter which Con
gressman Patterson has given to the pub
lic.
It is remembered that a severe pressure
on the gold , reserve in the treasury has
existed for some time, and that the Cleve
land administration has been compelled to
adopt desperate measures for maintaining
it. â A large "popular loan" to protect it
was one of them. It is hardly conceivable
that the Secretary would recklessly squan
der this reserve and deliberately violate
the law by paying out gold when silver
was demanded, especially in view of the
fact that the maintenance of - the reserve
was a more . important consideration with
the administration .than any fear that ad
herence"" to the gold standard would
antagonize the "silver fanatics" of the
South "and West. i The administration,
sitting down quietly to count its golden
toes, now finds some of them bruised, and
is seeking to heal them with a plating of
silver. The Secretary's letter is a special
plea for the support of the silver wing of
the Democracy in his candidacy for the
Presidential nomination, and is an un
worthy exhibition by the goldbugs' idol.
THE TOSEMITE ROADS.
The disclosures made in Tuesday's Call
concerning the probable intent and in
evitable effect of the passage of the bill in
Congress for the purchase by the Govern
ment of the Yosemite toli roads requires
minute investigation by those whose duty
it is to protect the Government against
trickery. The matter seems to have been
brought to the public attention first by
A. C. Maude, a member of the California
Bureau of Highways. The proposition of
the bill introduced in the House by Con
gressman Grove L. Johnson is that the
Government buy the four toll roads run
ning "ovsr" the Yosemite National Park
at a cost of $2G8,G50 and make them free,
leaving the parts of the same roads out
side the reservation in the present owner
ship and subject to tolls. It is believed
that this pleasant arrangement would re
lieve the owners of the expense of main
taining the most difficult parts of the road
and not disturb their power to levy tolls as
at present on all who visit the valley.
If this is the truth it is shameful and the
project Bhould De defeated. There are
much better ways for the expenditure of
that amount of money in California by
the Government. The amount provided
for in the Johnson bill is nearly $20,000
more than that asked for by the Miners'
Association to be added to the appropri
ation made by the State of California for
the construction of works for impounding
debris. It is so difficult to secure money
from Congress for really useful improve
ments in California that the apparent
readiness to make the appropriation for
the purchase of the Yosemite roads does
not bear a very pleasant aspect.
Of course the purchase of these roads
would be only the beginning of the
expense connected with them. They will
have to be kept in order, and that means
an annual appropriation. The project for
the construction of a steam road up the
Merced River is now assured and is in the
hands of responsible capitalists. Such a
road will greatly weaken the argument for
the Government purchase of the wagon
roads, as the expense of entering the valley
will be bo much reduced both for freight
and passengers that the necessity for
wagon roads will be practically eliminated.
It may be merely a coincidence that the
proposition to purchase these roads comes
concurrently with the project of the steam
road, which -will seriously impair their
value, but the whole affair has not an
agreeable look. These remarks are made
merely as suegestions. The case seems to
deserve fuller consideration than it has
received. At all events the California
delegation should be made acquainted
with the matter in its entirety.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
James Hickey, who nsed to be a member of
the stock board here and who has mined in
different parts of California and the coast, is
attheÃuss. For some time past he has been
interested in mines at Silver Peak, Eamerulda
County, Nev.
Esineralda is a large county with varied in
terests, but tbe silver mines, he say*, can
scarcely be worked now when silver is as low
as it is. One other thing that is somewhat
detrimental besides the existing price is the
distance from a railroad.
The Silver Peak mines are forty-five miles
north of Candolaria, which is in the same
county, but unlike tbe latter they carry a good
deal of gold. Not far away are the Silver Star
properties, the most noted of which is the
Hardscrabble.:
These properties carry gold entirely, there be-

Peak.

ing no Bilverorlead, so he says. One of the
Yerringtons got a bond on this same mine some
months ago, and for a time it was reported the
Hardscrabble group was Bold, but such does
not appear now to have been the case.
"They are not doing anything at Candelaria
now," said Mr. Hickey. "The mine of that
name is closed down and has been for a long
time. Not a pound of ore is coming out.
"I don't suppose either there are over twenty
five men in the camp. You see the mines are
all silver and therefore nothing is being done.
The miners will have to wait a little while till
things get better.
"But Esmeralda is a great county and has
vast areas of wealth, notwithstanding these
things. Part of the wealth is in borax beds,
which are in different localities and which are
nearly all owned by Smith of Oakland, the
borax king."
Mr. Hickey is a miner of many years experi
ence and is said to be a good judge of mines.
He is well known on the Pacific Coast.
Robert J. Burdette, the humorist who made
the Burliugton Hawkeye famous, will be here
in a few days. He is on a lecturing tour.
When Burdette was on the coast last, which
was some three or four years ago, he preached
In some of the churches. It is said that on this
trip, however, he will be simply a humorist.
it wa9 a strange career that Burdette and
the Hawkeye had. Burdette went on the pa
per in the little lowa town at that time almost
unknown and in a brief time attracted such
attention that bis stories . and boa mots were
quoted | all over the country. . This . ,waa , long
before the days of Bill Nye and before his pa
per in Cheyenne, the Boomerang:, was ever
heard of. ' Lewis of tne Detroit Free Press, bet
ter known as'M. Quad, was a contemporary of
Burdette, and aside from those there was only
Bailey of the Danbury ; News ' and the genius
who scintillated in the Oil City Derrick, who
had any prominence ma similar style of writ
ing. - ....
Petroleum V. Nasby of the Toledo Blade,
who wrote his celebrated "Confederate X
Road" stories, and Josh Billings attained
celeDrity in somewhat other lines. Their
articles were much fewer and longer, and addi
tional interest was added by the queer spell
ing they used.
As for the Hawkeye, under Frank Hatton as
the managing editor and fiurdette as the
humorist, it was only a brief period until it
attained fame. The character of the paper for
extraordinary business was maintained for
many years. There came a time, however,
when the Hawkeye had to take a back seat.
Fast mail trains were put on, reaching to and
from all principal cities and towns, and these
delivered the big Chicago and St. Louis papers
into Burlington when the Hawkeye was barely
off the press.
This was competition strong. The papers
from these great cities could and did print far
more special and general news tnan the Bur
lington local paper, while they also gave suc
cinct reports of important local news.
It was a new era in journalism in the river
cities of lowa. Mr. Burdette about this time
changed his residence to the Atlantic Coast.
Mr. Hatton went to Chicago and Washington.
Ever since then the humorist of the'old Hawk
eye has made his home in New York and
Brooklyn, though he has, as formerly, trav
eled a great deal, and delivered many lectures.
He is to speak in this City on March 24.

A CAVE OF TREES.
One of the most curious and beautiful sights
in Contra Costa County can be found on the
hills of San Pablo Point, only a few hundred
feet from the bay shore and about fifty feet
above ihe tide level. It is a natural cave of
oak trees, and its existence is largely due to
the presence of a spring that flows from the hill
side.
At first glance the cave would not impress
a person as particularly unusal, &a it has much
Cave Formed by Oak Trees on San Pablo
Point.
[Sketched by a " Call" artist.]
the appearance of hundreds of other groups o
oak trees that can be seen in the vicinity. It
is in the bottom of a ravine that runs from
north to south, and on being approached
closely presents the appearance of a cavern of
inky blackness. There is a large pooi of water
at the entrance, and several old oaks spring
from among bowlders on either side, the
branches meeting overhead and also extending
out on both sides until they completely fill the
ravine.
It is the inside of the cave that is the most
curious, however. Stepping back a few feet
and looking up not the faintest ray of light can
be seen, so dense is the growth of leaves and
branches. Ten feet back from the mouth of
the cave one stands in a soft twilight, and fifty
feet back the entrance can scarcely be seen.
At the end of the cave where the spring is it is
as dark as midnight. The entrance cannot be
seen from this point as the ravine makes a
slight turn. It is impossible to proceed
farther because the spring comes from beneath
a large rock that completely blocks the way.
It would be impossible fora person to tell
what the sides of the cave were made of even
ten feet back from the entrance. They appear
so dense the impression Is that there must be
rocks on all sides. But a careful examination
with the aid of a lamp reveals a most in
tricate Â«etwork of leaves and branches. The
abundance of water supplied by the spring has
given the trees a phenomenal growth. It has
also been the means of causing a growth of
vines of different kinds. These are so thick
they form a perfect wall that it would be im
possible to get through without cutting a pas-
sage.
The cave is about eight feet wide and seven
feet high and is the same size from end to end.
of ita sixty feet. The stream of water at the
bottom is so wide that it is necessary to step
from rock to rock to avoid walking in it.
Even on hot days the temperature of the cave
is cool and pleasant.
CONFUSION ON THE CONTINENT.
Abyssinia is justifying its name. It is, in
deed, the "Land of Mixtures." It is causiug a
prodigious mixture of affairs among the great
powers of Europe. Not for many years have
the dissolution of the Triple League, the forma
tion of new alliances and the general redistribu
tion of the balance of jpower seemed co immi
nent as now. A single decisive victory of King
Menelek's forces has thrown the whole conti
nent into confusion. It is also a pretty bit of
what we call the irony of fate that the power
which first adopted' extreme militarism as a
system should now strike that system in Eu
rope so staggering a blow. That power was
Abyssinia. Long before Sedan, or even
Sadowa, King Theodore made of his realm
one mighty camp. He organized the stand
ing array on a greater scale, propor
tionately, than that of any European
power to-day. It was that fact that
aroused disaffection toward him amone his
own people, made the conquest of his capital
by the British so easyâ a curious paradoxâ and
drove him to suicide. And now European
militarism conies into contact with the rem
nants of his system and is almost shattered by
the shock.
The utter selfishness of the Great Powers
was never more strikingly shown than
in this crisis. Italy had been impov
erishing herself and shedding her very
heart's blood for the sake of her
allies. And now, in her dire distress, those al
lies pass by on the other side, offering her not
even their sympathy. Their only message is
the brutal remark that she is beaten and
ruined and may as \re.l own up to it. To-mor
row they will be as ready to. prey upon her and
despoil her as they have hitherto been to use
her for their own ends. No wonder
King Humbert resents their so-called
advice and resolves to stand or fall on
his own chosen jrround. But what a pity it is
that he will not at once sever the fatal bonds
that bind him to his cynical and self-seeking
allies, and raise the standard of "Italy for
Italians and for Italian interests." Then he
might restore prosperity and prestige, and
make his Kingdom once more worthy of its
old renown.â New York Tribune.

To Drill Glassâ W. W. 8., Oakland, Cal. A
writer in an article on drilling glass says:
"Wet an ordinary drill with petroleum or ben
zineâturpentine will answer, but not so well.
It will then bore common glass as rapidly as
steel. If it is intended to bore through, the
glass should be first countersunk on each side
with a drill dressed off so as to form a very flat
three-nded pyramid. Flint and plate glass are
very difficult to bore. It has been ascertained
that dilute sulphuric Â»oid is much more
effective, with less wear of the tool, tuan oil of
turpentine. It is stated that glass castings for
pump barrels, etc., are drilled, planed and
bored like iron ones, and in the same lathes
and machinery, by the aid of sulphuric acid.
Big Bugâ E. G. 8., Livermore, Cal. "Big brig"
is an Americanism' which Is a disrespectful
bitt common allusion to persons of wealth or
with other claims to distinction. Its variants
are "bift dog," big wig" and "great gun." In
Widow Bedott's papers is found:
Samson Savage is one of the big bugs, that
is. she has got more money than almost anybody
in town. '
In 1851, the New York Times, in commenting
on English affairs, used the following:
The free and easy manner in which the hair
brained Sir Robert Peel described the big bues at
Moscow brought him into difficulty.

A regular meeting of George H. 'i'homas

of Lincoln Post.
It is not violating any secrets of tbe ses

form, the comrades ass-enibled admired

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Long â¢ Distance Speaking
Trumpet Given a Prac- .
tical Test.
IT WAS A GENUINE SUCCESS.
St. Patrick's Day Was Duly Honored
by the Shipping Men and
Sailors.
The Alaska Packers' Association has de
cided to equip all its vessels with the new
Test of the Long-Distance Speaking-Trumpet From the Tug Fearless. It Was Easy to Talk to a Boa
a 31ile Off and to the British Ship Reliance and Monitor Camanche.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
speaking-trumpet that has been so thor
oughly tested on the big tug Fearless. In
order to satisfy themselves as to its merits
S. B. Matthews, the company's cannery
superintendent, and Sydney S. Smith,
chief-clerk, went out in a Whitehall boat
yesterday and took one of the instruments
with them. When away beyond the British
ship Reliance they couid hear every word
distinctly and Captain Dan Haskell and
Mr. Matthews kept up quite an animated
conversation although fully a mile apart.
The monitor Camanche was within hail
ing distance and the watch aboard was
ordered to go below and take a stiff horn
of whisky in honor of St. Patrick. The
men looked around in bewilderment but
they did not go below as the demijohn
was empty. The Reliance was decked i
with flags in honor of Ireland's patron
saint, and Captain Haskell turned the tube
on the ship while Messrs. Matthews "and
Smith awaited results a few boat-lengths
away.- "Reliance,- ahoy!" called Captain
Dan, and the men on deck ran to the side.
"Hurrah for ould Ireland!" and the crew
took it up and the answering cheer was
heard at Folsom-street wharf.
The AlasKa Packers' Association is so
pleased with the new instruments that it
will equip all its vessels with them.
There will be one for each boat and when
the men are away from the vessel and
caught in a fog they will have no difficulty
in reaching the schooners.
The Alameda was docking at Folsom
street yesterday after finishing discharging
â¢at the sugar refinery. One of the speaking
tubes was aboard and with its aid and that
of the one on the tug Fearless the steamer
was docked- in a few minutes, in spite of
the fact that the fog was so thick that the
lookout could not see twenty feet ahead.
In honor of St. Patrick's day the men on
the British ship Reliance were given a
holiday and Captain Robinson saw that
they enjoyed themselves. The men on the
State dredgers and all the street-sweepers
were given a half holiday by Chief Wharf
inger Root and the men thoroughly appre
ciated the privilege. The officers of the
. revenue cutters were all in full dress and
the sailors were togged out in their Sun
day clothes. Very little work was done
and Main street was crowded by people
anxious to get a look at Uncle Sam's reve
nue protectors when everything is on
"dress parade."
The Harbor Commissioners held a very
short session yesterday. President Colnon
is in Los Angeles, and as there was very
little business to transact Commissioners
Cole and Chad bourne cut the meeting
short. Secretary Keegan drew the atten
tion of the board to the fact that English
vessels had beentiodging the payment, of
dues on their full tonnage. Captain
Beechlng of the ship Ellesmere put in a
rebate for. 130 tons. He said the ship
turned out that much less than the Cus
tom-house papers showed she carried.
Commissioner Chadbourne said they could
not go behind the official record. Captain
Beecham got angry and said he would not
Eay the bill. "I move that the attorney
c instructed to at once begin action to
recover the amount," said Commissioner
Cole, and the motion was carried.. The
Ellesmere will now have to move Into the
stream and either her captain will pay the
bill or the ship will be libeled.
Some time ago President Colnon discov
ered that contractors when they were not
using their barges and pile-drivers moored
them at the foot of Second street. As they
wera taking up valuable space it was de
cided to charge them wharfage. A bill
was therefore sent to James McMahon, as
ne was the only one occupying the space
last month. McMahon paid* it, but yes
terday he entered a vigorous protest. The
matter went over for a week, until Presi
dent Colnon gets back, and then it will be
thoroughly discussed.
The secretary was instructed to adver
tise for proposals for the erection of a new
shed over Howard pier 2.
The bark Empire will have a new stem
put in and will get a thorough overhauling
at Main street. She will then sail for the
sound in ballast, and there will load lum
ber for Australia.
There was quite a quantity of salt ruined
on the old whaling bark : Emma Herri-,
man yesterday. When her hull was being
tested two auger-holes were bored and the
men forgot to plug them up. When the
salt sunk the vessel to the level of the
holes the vessel filled and. sank into the
soft mud. At low water. theHcrriman was
pumped out and the holes plugged. The
loss was only about 100 tons of salt. ,
The rush for Alaska still goes on. The
steamer Dora is being overhauled, and the
bark Electra and â¢- ship Two Brothers will
be ready to sail in a few days. ; -All of them
are, bound for the canneries, but passen
gers for Cooks Inlet will be carried. The
miners on the.Yukon and Douglass Island
are short of blasting powder, so the steamer
Yaquina' has been chartered to take a full
cargo of the explosive to Alaska. â  The ves
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 1596.
sel will be overhauled and will then load
in the stieam.
Charley Middleton, a Telegraph Hill
boy, nearly lost his life at Vallejo-street
wi.arf yesterday. He fell overboard, and
had it not been for James Olden of Oak
land he would surely have been drowned.
Once oh the wharf Charley soon recovered
and made tracks for home.
Captain Shaw of the red-stack tug Red
mond did a very clever piece of work yes
terday morning. The ship Two Brothers
was to dock at Main-street wlmrf, but on
account of the heavy fog Wharfinger Dry
den advised the towboat people not to
move her. They answered that the job
would be put off until this morning. The
Redmond had already taken hold of the
ship, however, and while the conversation
was groing on he had run her into the slip
in spite of the fog, and in seven minutes
the vessel was tied up at the wharf and the
tug was on her way back to Vallejo street.
It was a very; clever piece of towboating in
the circumstances.
The sealing schooner Emma and Louisa
changed hands yesterday, but who her
purchaser is Ross & Hewlett will not tell.
Captain Wyrnan wanted to buy her, but
when he -went to the owners with the
money he was told she was already sold.
The schooner will be fitted out for a trip
to the Alaska gold tields.
MAY END THE RATE WAR
A Possible Adjustment of the
Portland-San Francisco
Differences.
C. J. Smith Expected to Act as
Mediator Between the Two
Warring Carriers.
There is now a prospect of a settlement
of the differences between the Southern
Pacific Company and the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company relative to the
passenger and freight traffic between this
City and Portland, Or., and which have
led to a most bitter rate warfare for the
past five months.
Incidentally the Oregon Improvement
Company, which owns the stock of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, is in
volved, as the latter company operates not
only a line of steamers to Puget Sound,
but has the State of California running
between this port and Portland. And on
all the vessels on these routes the rates
have been cut in order to protect the busi
ness of the company from the cut rates of
the two active combatant companies. In
consequence the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company lias been a large loser and will
continue to be so while the situation re
mains as it is.
Ilefore the battle was opened between
the railroad and steamship lines the Ore
gon Improvement Company was called
into the conference in the hone that its
representative might suggest some means
by which harmony might be maintained,
but, as events proved, without having
been able to do so. â¢ '
C. J. Smith of the Oregon Improvement
Company arrived here from the north
yesterday and it was reported from Ta
coma that -his visit had for its object the
consideration of the troubles of the war
ring transportation companies and a pos
sible solution of them.
When Mr. Smith was seen by a Call
representative^he denied that his coming
was for the purpose of acting as mediator
in the matter mentioned, but added that
his company would certainly be willing
and glad to act in that capacity in order to
bring the rate-cutting to an end, as all
parties concerned must certainly be tired
of their strained relations. He stated that
he had not been approached on the mat
ter, but could not tell what would happen
during his stay. He will leave for San
Luis Obispo this morning, but will be back
in a few days.
Among the railroad people it is confi
dently stated ttat his visit portends the
early adjustment of the pending rate war
on Portland-San Francisco business.
The Southern Pacific people claim to be
getting more business than they can take
care oi on the Portland special or steamer
trains. On last Saturday they claim to
have sold tickets to 254 peopleâ all tbat
could be accommodated on one train â and
to have refused at least one carload of pas-
sengers.
At one time Mr. Stubbs agreed to come
to an agreement with the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company on the basis of
each being allowed 50 per cent of the pas
senger business. Since the war began,
however, he has come to the conclusion
that his company should have at least two
thirds of this business. It is due to this
lack of agreement upon what proportion
each company shall enjoy that the rate
war continues.
SCALDED HIS MOTHER.
Tom Shaujfhnessy Behind the Bars,
Charged With Battery.
Tom Shaughnessy, a husKy individual,
27 years of age, was arrested last evening
by Policeman Rainsbury, at the instance
of his mother, Ellen Shaughnessy, who
lives at 1219 Kearny street, and detained
at the Caliiornia-street police station on a
charge of battery. Mrs. Shaughnessy al
leges that her son has been in the habit of
abusing her, but last evening he capped
the climax by throwing a bucket of scald
ing water on her. In corroboration of her
statement she exposed her right hand and
am, which were swathed in cotton, it be
ing badly burned and blistered. She says
that she stood his abuse as long as possi
ble, but finally decided to have him ar
rested.

THANKS FOR YELLOW CARS
But the Merchants Are Not

WANT MORE PRIVILEGES.
Committee on Streetcar Transfers
Send a Well- Worded Reply to
Mr. Vining.
At a special meeting held yesterday by
the committee on streetcar transfers of the
Merchants' Association the letter of Man
ager Vinine dated March 3, embodying his
reply to the first communication sent by
the merchants to the Market-street Rail
way Company,* was considered and a reply
fully covering the points at issue was sent
to Mr. Vining.
The original communication of the
merchants suggested certain additions to
be made to the present transier system,
the principal result of which would be to
benefit the merchants on Kearny street by
according to them an equal footing with
merchants of other streets of the City
more favorably situated in the matter of
transfers.
The Merchants' Association further
stated that if these additions were made
they would petition the Board of Super
visors to make traffic in transfers illegal.
Mr. Vining replied that from the com
pany's standpoint such a proposition
would involve the placing of the company
under a perpetual obligation, because tbe
existence ot a certain condition of affairs
leads the public to regard it as the proper
condition ar.d any unexpected change
from this condition is considered by the
public an injustice, although the company
might be suffering a great loss.
He further stated that the company
would be willing to give transfers from
eastbound Mission-street cars to north
bound Kearny- street cars and vice versa,
if it could be safely done without financial
loss.
Finally the only solution of the trans
portation of passengers irom Mission Dis
trict to Kearny street in the mind of the
company, alter carefully considering all
points in connection with it, was the in
troduction of a line of cars from some
point on Mission street, either Twenty
second or Twenty-ninth streets, via Mis
sion street, turning northerly at Third
street and running thence north on
Kearny street at least as far as Jackson
street, and possibly to run as far north on
Kearny as Broadway, thence east on
Broadway to East street, and thence via
East street to the ferries, thus absorbing
thr- present Broadway tine.
Mr. Vining also staled that enrs were
already ordered and being built for this
line. They are to be. of a different color
from the 'Kearny-street cars, and that
probably two months would be necessary
to complete them.
In reply to Mr Vining the merchants
by their special committee, consisting of
A. B. Baldwin, W. T. Doane, M. S. Kohl
herp:. H. D. Keil, Frank A. Swain, C. S.
Benedict, S. W. Dixon, F. P. Dv Rose,
John Farnham, A. S. Hallidie, Frank
Markey, H. H. Taylor, George D. Toy, D*.
W. Dorhmann, J. Richard Freud, M. Hart,
Charles Keiius, formulated the following:
E. P. Vinir.g Esq., General Manager Market
street Bailway Company, Cityâ Deak Silt: Your
favor of the 3d lnst., addressed to the Mer
chants' Association, relative to transfers to
and from the Kearny-street line, has been re
ferred to us as the committee appointed by
that association upon the subject of transfers.
We suggested that the transfers existing on
Kearny street were within your general trans
fer system and principle governing the same,
and have therefore become, as it were, part of
the value of the property and business on
Kesrny street and should not have been en
tirely abandoned when the trolley system was
inaugurated on that street. We fully realize
that not all transfers can become permanent
and changes of transfers must be made when
circumstances governing the same make dif
ferent arrangements necessary.
We note that your company disclaims any
promises alleged to have been made to the
merchants along Kearny street relating to the
transfer system of that thoroughfure; and.
while we are creditably informed that certain
promises were made by Mr. Reid, a solicitor in
the employ of yoiir company, who was dele
gated to obtain the signatures ot the Kearny
street merchants and property-owners to a
petition for an electric road on that thorough
lare, we are willing to assume that such prom
ises were not authorized by your company,
and are desirous of eliminating from the prop
osition of transfers the question of moral obli
gation, and will, therefore, discuss it from a
business standpoint.
As far as we call see it is one that involves
only two questions: First, whether the reve
nue of your company will be increased, or, at
least, will not be diminished, and second,
whether the transfers asked for will be a con
venience to your patrons and will not be
abused by them.
The transfer system which the property,
owners and a large number of people engaged
in business not only on Kearny street but in
hD area tributary thereto, as well as a number
of people residing at the Mission and in the
Western Addition north of California street,
ask to have adopted by your company is as
follows:
Firstâ From southbound Kearny and Third
street cars to Market and Mission eÃstbound,
and Clay and Mission street cars eastbound.
Secondâ From northbound Third and Kearny
street cars to Mission and Market street cars
eastbound and westbound, and Clay-street cars
westbound.
Thirdâ From Sacramento and Jackson street
cars eastbound to Kearny-street cars south
bound only.
Fourthâ From eastbound and westbound Mis
sion-si Â»x*et cars to Third-streetcars northbound
and southbound.
Fifthâ From Market-street cars eastbound
to Third-street cars southbound, but not to
Kearny-street cars northbound.
Sixthâ From ferry via Market and Kearny
street cars northbound and Third-street cars
southbound.
We understand from your several communi
cations 0:1 this subject thai niica a t-y.st- in is
objectionable, from the fact that a passenzer
taking the cars at the Third and Towme id
street depot, for instance, will be permitted to
transfer at Clay street for the westbound cars,
again transfer at Clay and Powell to a south
bound Cfir and transfer acain at the intersec
tion of Powell and Market and thus, by your
present system, return to the starting point by
paying only one fare. We think that you will
admit that the number of people who would
be likely to make such an excursion is infini
tesimal. We realize, thousrh, that while the
original passenger may not De inclined to
make a round trip for one fare, his iransfer
may be passed ;o some one else and thus two
pnssengers ftre enabled to travel in opposite
directions for one fare, which we assume is
the most serious objection to giving transfers
from tne Kearny street cars to westbound Sac
ramento and Jackson-street cars. It seems to
us tliat this can be obviated by abolishing the
transfers on the southbound Powell-street
cars from the westbound Jackson and Sacra
mento street car?. It would also be necessary
to abolish transfers from the northbound Pow
ell-street cars to eastbound Sacramento-street
cars to prevent a contiuuous passage from
Third andTownsend oy way of Market and Pow
ell-street lines and return on Sacramento and
Kearny-street cars. If transfers are issued to
and from the Kearny-street line and the Sacra
mento Bud Jackson street cars, people residing
in the Western Addition, between California
and Pacific avenue, traveling to and from the
center of retail trade, will be enabled to reach
their homes and places of business more con
veniently over yoirr system than by taking the
Manet-street cars, which are usually very
much crowded, going five or six blocks out of
their way, necessitating a transfer at Powell
street, and et certain times of the day and
week another transfer to toe Sacramento and
Jacks- n street cars. In aodition to this a
much more convenient and direct route would
be afforded to them in traveling to a;id from
thp depot at Th rÂ»l md T< wisend streets.
We appreciate ihe fact that it would be nec
essary to adopt some method to prevent resi
dents of the Mission, eastbound. from transfer
ing to your Third-street line and agttin trans
feirlne at Third and Market to your west
bound Market-street cars, thus making a trip
from the Mission and reiurn posfibie. If your
new system will prevent this it seems to us
that you can prohibit the it-suing of transfers
at Market and Third streets to westbound
Market-street cars to those passengers who
have? been transrerred from the Mission. street
line.
In conclusion we have only to add that if
transfers are given as requested by us the fol
lowing would be the result:
Residents of the Western Addition would be
enabled to travel to ana from the Southern
Pacific depot (at Third and Townsend streets)
at a saving of fully live minutes in time over
the present roundabout route by way of Powell
street. <
A route from the Mission to North Beach
would be established without involving the ex
pense of additional cars which is contemplated
in your through line system.
Those starting from the terry and desiring to
reach any point on Kop.rny street, between
Sacramento and Post, would travel over your
line rather than walk as they do now to the
California-street cars or patronize the Sutter
street horsecar line. All of which, in our
opinion, would result in profit to your com
pany and convenience to your patrons, besides
materially assisting in restoring Kearny street
a trade which it is i.-ist losing by reason of an
unfair discrimination against It in transfer
privileges.
We do not underestimate the advantage in
the through line you propose to inaugurate
from the Mission to and along Keamv street,
as compared to the present system, and will be
glad to see it estnbiished.as it will save passen
gers the annoyance of transfers at Thiid and
Mission streets, as we suggest. We confess,
though, this is the only point we can see in
favor of it, and if it is to be regarded as an ex
periment involving an additional expense in
the operation of your system as now run, we
are somewhÃt apprehensive that it may not
prove satisfnetory, in which event you would
naturally discontinue it. There may, how
ever, be good reasons and factors unknown to
us which enter into the proposition that ne
cessitates separate and distinct cars to and
from the Mission, in which event we are sure
the Merchants' Association will doubly appre
ciate your response totheappeal madethrongh
it in behalf of thejpublic, as your acquiescence
means an expenditure not contemplated in our
request. As there could be no abuse of such a
privilege at this transfer point we take it for
granted that you contemplate giving transfers
at Broadway and Kearny streets to North
Beach upon the proposed new line from the
Mission, thus giving North Beach the corre
sponding transfer privilege to the one it for
merly enjoyed.

THE FESTAL DAY
OF ERIN'S SAINT
Brilliant Observance of the
Feast of Ireland's
Apostle.
ORATORY, MIRTH, SONG.
Religious Services at the Cathe
dral and the Other
Churches.
JUDGE SULLIVAN'S ORATION.
Military and Navy Drill of the
California Army and Naval
Union.
The sainted memory of Ireland's apostle,
the noble history of a doughty race, and
the unborn glories of a nation yet to come
âthese were the centers about which the
words, the songs and thoughts of many a
San Franciscan clustered yesterday.
St. Patrick's day was right royally ob
served. Mirth and song, oratory and
poetry, dancing and feasting were the or
der of the day for Erin's sons and daugh
ters within our gates. Nor did religion
fail to bless with hallowing touch the anni
versary wfaicb means so much for many of
those whose sweat and money have helped
to make this City and this State what they
are.
At the cathedral a solemn mass was
celebrated, and similar services were held
in St. Patrick's and many of the other
English-speaking churches, the congrega
tions being very iarge and the music un
usually fine. There was no parade, and
perhaps no one missed it, as the omission
was amply supplied by a continued round
of entertainments of various kinds.
At the old Woodward's Pavilion the
afternoon was devoted to a fine vocal and
band concert and exhibition of stereopti
con views, while io the evening the
Hon. J. F. Sullivan deliveied an oration
rilled with true American patriotism,
albeit tinged with a romantic veneration
for the home of his ancestors.
The Knights of St. Patrick gave a sump
tuous banquet, while those of the Red
Branch neld their twenty-seventh anni
versary ball. The young ladies of St.
James parish gave an entertainment, the
California Garrison of the Reeular Army
and IS T avy Union field a military and naval
drill and gave its third anniversary ball at
the Mechanics' Pavilion, besides which
other entertainments were given by several
of the various religious and Irish patriotic
associations.
The day was perfect, though a little
warm, and the night clear and cool. So
many people in gala attire were on the
streets that the City had quite a festive
look. Everywhere the verdant folds of
Erin's flag floated in the air, while on fair
bosoms and on brawny chests reposed the
little shamrock which* St. Patrick used in
The tlarp of Green and Gold That Covered the Menu Cards at the Banquet of the
Knights of St. Patrick-
order to explain the mystery of the holy
Trinity to the pagan Celts fourteen Ion"
--centuries ago.
AT WOODWARD'S PAVILION.
Musical and Literary Programme,
With a Fine Display of Stere
optlcon Views.
Old San Franciscans, and there were
many of them at the St. Patrick's day
celebration at Woodward's Pavilion/found
it difficult to remember that they were
getting on in years, and that the ancient
glory of the "gardens'" had departed. The
interior of the old pavilion had assumed
the festal grace of days gone by and, rilled
with a crowded but good tempered throng,
seemed to have become itself again.
Festoons of snowy white and Jiving
green, bespangled with golden stars, in
tcrrwined in close embrace with the red,
white and blue of the land which has since
revolutionary days opened its portals to
the oppressed of every creed and nation.
The shnmrocK of Erin and the palm of Cali
fornia, the harp of Celtic bards of old and
the Dannerof the stars and stripes, grouped
themselves gracefully about the American
eagle, whose outstretched wings were ir
radiated by the golden Â«lory of Hibernia's
sunburst.
The afternoon programme was a nov
elty in its vcay. Tnere wore no speeches, |
no poem, no oration; but the volleys of .
applause, which at .frequent intervals i
| shook the old pavilion to its foundations,
' certainly went far to prove that the cele-
I bration was a success. Roncovieri, the
! man who as a trombone-player used to j
| make artists and ladies rave, was there |
with his weli-driJied band of forty pieces, !
and under hi> able direction the overture j
of Irish airs was a delicious dream of per- |
feet harmony combined with melodies j
which all the audience knew by heart.
The overture terminated with a glorious I
fortissimo rendering of "The Harp that
Once Through Tara's Halls," the louder |
instruments carrying the melody, while
life, piccolo and flute vied with each other
i in producing a pearl-like cascade of in
! tricate variations.
As t!ie first bar 3 of the ancient son;;
were heard the pavilion was suddenly
darkened, and on a canvas 35x35 feet in
area appeared a stereopticon picture of
Ireland's apostle. The majestic pose of
| the noble figure, robed in the dignified
attirements of the early Christian epis
copate was striking in its simple yet im- I
posing beauty. A magnificent series of
views then followed each other in rapid
succession,'all of Ireland's most famous
| monuments and scenes of beauty passing i
I in review before the beholders' "delighted j
! gaze, while the band rendered selections
j from the compositions of Celtic musicians,
i ancient and modern.
At intervals the light was admitted in
order to give the musicians a breathing I
spell and to give place to the numbers of a
well chosen vocal and literary programme.

iianre," and retired from the stage with
i her arms full of lovdy Moral tributes.
A magnificent exhibition of Irish ji<r and
hornpipe dancing was then given by
Messrs. Keller and O'Connor. Both gen
tlemen were in full dress with green
I cravats and knee-breeches. Their dancing
was a marvel. Few queens of the ballet
j would be able to keep time to the peculiar,
! exacting measure of the aucient dance as
well. Many of the evolutions were moat
intricate and difficult, while all were erace
| ful, and bursts of applause rewarded the
| dancers for their skill.
Mr. Hood then sang "A Hundred Fath
i onis Deep," being followed by Miss Kir
j by in "Erin, the Tear and the Smile in
j Thine Eye." The singers were aecompan

organist of the old Cathedral.
A spirited picture history of American
j war times was then thrown on the canvas.
j The applause during the Irish views had
been loud and lone, but when the more
familiar scenes of the Union's struggle for ]
I freedom made their appearance cheer
j upon cheer made the Pavilion ring. Sev
eral portraits of American generals and
war-heroes were next displaj'ed, the en

ing view in the midst of which the
Nation's eagle flapped his wings to the
measure of the '-Star Spangled Banner,"

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 1896.
THE THRONG AT THE PAVILION LISTENING TO ORATOR SULLIVAN.
IN THE EVENING.
The Programme Includes a Poem
by Howard Sutherland and an
Address by Judge Sullivan.
Though well filled during the afternoon
I there was hardly standing room in the
I old pavilion at night. The well disciplined
ushers had all they could do to pack late
; comers in places where they would be least
| uncomfortable and be most unlikely to in
commode others. The brilliant illumina
, tion set off the beauty and good taste of
; the decorations, rendering the scene one of
i rare loveliness.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the participants
! took their places on the stage. The guest
; of honor was his Lordship the Bishop of
' Victoria, the Right Reverend Dr. L,em

An overture, consisting of a fantasia of j
Irish airs, rendered by Cassasa's orchestra i
opened tbe evening exercises. Mr. Ban- I
nerrnan then made a brief introductory !
address, bidding welcome to all present in \
a few well-chosen words, and expressing |
the hope that all might enjoy themselves. !
Mr. Woods then gave a spirited render- j
ing of McCann' s typical Irish song "O'Don- j
neil Aboo," after which the following i
poem, written for the occasion by Howard I
V. Sutherland, was read by Leo Cooper:
THE MESSAGE FROM THE WEST.
Like trumpet sound from the western landâ this fair, fond home of oursâ
This song goes forth to an old-world land, a i em in a stormy sea;
A land beloved of the wind and sun, caressed by the gentle showers
That fall like tears from the angels' eyes to lighten her misjry.
A land whose sons with their mighty thews long ages since tore down
The banners of opposing hosts and proved their efforts vain.
And placed o'er thankless England's brows the priceless, bloodstained crown
Which made her Europe's arbitress on land and on the main.
To Ireland, then, this song goes forth, in the Westland's tones of thunder,
To Ireland loved with a western love by men who have loved her long;
Nor Time nor the world's wide breadth can rend those miuhty ties asunder
Which come to men in their golden youth and grow with age more strong.
The winds that play on our mountains' tops shall carry the Westland's greeting
And strengthen her with their fragrant breath, made sVeet by the morning's dew;
Shall give her the Westland's message that the hour of trial is fleeting.
And soon shall shine lor her the light that clouds now hide from view.
I see her stand with her cool, low brow, her lips apart in pleading,
With God's sweet sunshine in her eyes, undimmed by her countless tears;
Her hands outstretched for the gift she cravesâ those hands that are worn and bleeiiinÂ»
By keeping clear from her sister's '.>ath the thorns of a hundred years.
And near her wait her illustrious dead, whose names shall outlast all ages
Her soldiers, poets, artists, priests, whose brows wear the deathless bay;
And countless others whose deeds nor namts are found on history's pages
Whose lives are spun in their own land's woof forever and ahvay.
Long years she pleads with impassioned voice the gift she so much desiresâ
The right to rule with her own ri^ht hand her country's utmost inch ;
J*ut in her heart there are smoldering still the unqnenched, hunerv tires
That lony to leap to her patient eyes to make cold England' flinch."
And though her arms are as white as snow she knows full well the power
That in them lies, like a brooding god, alert for the trumpet's call ;
She feels full sure of her hidden strength, lons stored for the final hour
When heaven itself may hide its face in the frightened storm-cloud's pail.
For well she knows that her beck will bring, from hillside and from valley
Ten times ten thousand mighty men as brave as those of yore.
Who watch and wait for the coming storm, in eagerness to raily
About the colors that shall lead the mighty van in war.
She knows the offspring of the men who fought and died for others
In foreign lands, 'neath foreign flags, and gave no sign of fear
â Will right for Irish liberty like one great band of brothers '
From Malm Head to Inishmore, from Dublin to Cape Clear.
And we of these mighty western lands, beloved of Hie sun and ocean
Who know the sweets which Freedom gives, bid Ireland's cause God-speed i
1 he flag that flutters above our heads was won by the devotion
Of true-souled men to one idea in times of greatest need
One country's cause is now the world's when freedom is imrwriled
And we, who hold God's greatest gift, wait eagerly to see '
The dawn-bnrst lieht the darkened sky with radiant rays that herald
Deliverance to a sister land from long-borne tyranny. '
And though we trust that the wardrum's roll nor the bucle's call shall waken
The drowsy fields where the son-birds sing and the ahv-faSed JowAds hSle
Yet Right is Right, and maintained must be. though aVtho wwld bS Vhaken
That in the end true liberty within each land shalllide shaken,
The Western men and the Western maids this greeting then ire Â«pnrlin<*
To patient, thorn-crowned Ireland, beloved for her â¢ fa th aiid ?o?l
And pray to God that she gain fresh strength to aid her in defending
Her rights until her sons shall own, and rule, their native soil.
Moore's ballad. "Let Erin Remember,"
and Lover's rollicking song, "The Low
backed Car," were then given in a charm
ing style by Miss Mary I. Sullivan, who
was enthusiastically encored.
The Hon. J. F. Sullivan, orator of the
day, then delivered the oration. As the
Judge's well-rounded periods and glowing
wonis flooded the old pavilion, cneers and
applause were frequent.
Judge Sullivan said:
We are here to proclaim that Ireland is not
dead, and to add our annual testimonial to
the unyielding strength of the Irish race. In
common with millions of the race, we conse
crate thM day to the memories, and the hopes
of that greenest isle of all the seas, sweet Innis
failâthe island of destiny. Though seven cen
turies have run their cycling course since Mc-
Murrouffh's treachery and Strongbow's blight
ing invasion, the robber conqueror has not
stripped the Gaei of the sacred feeling that the
toil he treads on is the immemorial inheritance
of uncounted generations of heroes and legis
lators and baints.
Who are we here assembled? We are citi
zens of the great Republic, some, like myself
)/orn u,-on the soil to the heritage of liberty
and others by choice and assumption of alle"
--giam-e admitted to and charged with all the
duties and responsibilities of American citi
zenship; all of us bound up In ourselves aud
our posterity with the destinies of the Ameri
can Republic.
But some will say, What have American citi
zens to do with the political condition of Ire
land ? We are free men, sharers of the great
cst civil and religious liberty ever vouchsafed
to men, enjoying a freedom distinguished from
every other landâ "ruling without power, yet
unresi.sted and irresistible: undisturbed by
anarchy, yet completely obeying the will of
the governed."
In the very nature of things the American
heart should beat in unison with every at
tempt at popular government wherever made.
Appreciating fully the Dlessinjrs we enjoy we
naturally take a pride in the development In
other lands of the republican principles which
We profess and practice. Wherever there is
oppression of the masses we sympathize with
the oppressed. Wherever there is well-regu
lated, earnest, gradual development of the in
telligence and rower of the masses and con
certed endeavor to place government in the
hands of those most concernedâ the people
themselvesâ we rejoice at it.
Whenever a chieftain in the ever-continuing
conflict for human liberty falls, whatever his
faith, his tongue or his lineage, whether he die
upon the snowy plains of Poland, among the
Classic isles of Greece, under the mild Italian
skies, upon the vineclad hills of France or
amid the mountain fastnesses or emerald val
leys of Ireland, America hastens to attest her
love of liberty and her affection lor the hero
who wages battle in her behalf. Shall we,
as Americans, who have achieved our own
freedom by sacrifice of blood, our own, and of
blood freely drawn from other lands; shall we
who have freely lent sympathy, money, arms
and men to other revolutionary States, refuse
our sanction to the peaceful, heroic, sublime
effort of Ireland in the cause of human liberty?
Freedom, magnanimity, humanity, Christian
ity, blessed memories of the past, irresistible
impulses of the present, iofty hopes for the
future throughout all generations, in all climes
â earth and heaven forbid.
In this connection I have often thought that
this sentiment was most beautifully and ap
propriately recognized in the conduct of the
French people in the offering made to the i
people of the United States of the colossal
statue of "Liberty Enlightening the World."
At the entrance to'our grandest metropolitan
harbor this symbolical figure stands as the
embodiment of the Nation's sentiment, as the
expression of the Nation's voice, as a reprc- '
sentative of the Nation's hopes and prayers for
the universal emancipation of human kind.
As the symbol stands, facing the storms and
billows of the Atlantic, bidding welcome to its
storm-tossed travelers, so may in reality the j
heart and voice and sentiment of the Ameri
can people look out upon the ocean of popular
strife for self-government, and so may they
welcome the peoples ot the world into the haven
of popular government after they have thrust
aside the trappings of tyranny, and so may
they continue to do
Till the war drum throbs no longer and the battle
flags are furled
In the parliament of man, the federation of the
world.

battled for ; that i cause .< to which they * had
pledged their lives, r their fortunes and their
sacred honor. They traveled all the blood y
pathway of the struggle. ,, They crossed with
Washington the frozen Delaware. Some stood
barefooted and in rags at Valley Forge, and
with him they shared the crowning glories of
Yorktown.
In v later day, they stood with shields in tne
fierce conflict of Cherubusco. With Scott they
climbed the Heights of Chapultepee and as
sisted in carrying the glory of American arms
into the sacred precincts of the Montezumas:.
And again, when the grandest governmental
fabric of the world's history seemed to be
trembling in the balance, and when it whs
fearer) it might be dissolved into its constitu
ent elements, men of Irish blood went forth
in companies, in regiments, in brigades, by
thousands upon thousands, to battle for the
integrity'of the Republic and the perpetua
tion of our liberties. We know that they stood j
in solid phalanx beside that hero Thomas j
Francis Meagher when rivalling the charge of
Balaklava; they scaled St. Mary's Heights at j
Fredericksburg 1200 strong and left a thou
sand dead upon the Held in proof of their loy
alty to the Republic.
We know that their stout hearts and brave
arms were with that herowho never knew defeat
on that eventful day.when picking up the strap
fling remnants of a routed army in his ride
from Winchester to Cedar Hill, Phil Sheridan ;
immortalized himself and endeared himself â 
forever to his countrymen. And besides their j
services on land and sea, we know that men of â 
Irish blood rendered distinguished service in j
thnt council chamber from wnieh issued j
the second Magna Charta, the greatest charter
of human liberty ever formulated, which de- '
clared that "the American colonies were, and j
of right out to be, free ana independent j
stntes."
During the time of their severest struggles '
the people of this country have always had i
the moral support and encouragement of the ;
Irish people. When, 111 1771, Benjamin Frank
lin visited Dublin and came in contact wlih ,
the leading patriots of the Irish Parliament, I
he wrote to his friends in America:
"I find them disposed to be friends of I
America in which I endeavor to confirm them !
with the expectation that our growing weight ',
might in time be thrown In their scale and by j
joining our interests with theirs a more equi- j
table treatment from England might be ob- ;
tamed for themselves as well as for us."
In 1775 Chntham asserted that Ireland on
the colonial question was with America to a
man. In the same year the colonists set such
a high value on Irish sympathy and so truly !
understood its extent and influence that the :
Continental Congress addressed the Irish peo- j
pie in this language:
"You have been friendly to the rights of ;
mankind and we acknowledge with pleasure j
find gratitude that the Irish nation has pro- I
duced patriots who have highly distinguished j
themselves in the cause of humanity und Of j
America. We know that you are not without ;
your grievances. We sympathize with you in I
your distress. We hope' that t!ie patient abid- j
ing in the weak may not always be forgotten.

The Power
Of Manhood.
Strong: Muscled Men Are Not Men of Strong *
Nerve Power.
When you see a man whose muscles stand out like the
I coils in a rope you envy him. He looks like one of Na-
ture's noblemen, and his strength is so overpowering it
brings, from you an exclamation of wonder. And yet maybe
he would gladly sacrifice that muscular, power for the
recovery of another element that he has lostâ nerve force.
Muscular strength is not everything. The muscular giant
is sometimes the most veritable coward at heart â weak,
nervous, afraid of his own shadow. It seems ridiculous,
but it has been proven in our experience that the largest >
men are always the weakest in nerve and vital power.

1 here are few Americans, 1 trust, so ignorant
oi their country's struggle for legislative inde
pendence as not to know that a distinguished
irishman stood on the floor of the English
House of Commons and contended tor concili
ation and justice to the colonies. There are
lew who do not know that the eloquence and
ability of Edmund Burke were on that side on
kH â¢as iie once well said, "Eloquence and
ability ought ever to be ou the side of liberty
and jus'iee."
The 5,000,Ct00 of the Irish race that inhabit
Ireland are not the bulk of its representation.
â¢I think it hardly any exaggeration to say that
more than twice that number of people of
Irish blood may be found in the United States.
The sentiment of that number of people must
largely moid the sentiment of the people
among whom they live. Its influence was
foreseen 100 years ago by the master mind of
that pure patriot and impassioned orator-
Henry Grattun. In spf nking in the Irish House
oi Commons in favor of the legislative inde
pendence of Ireland he said, among other
things:
"Do you see nothing in that America but the
grave and prison of your armiei? And do you
not see in her range of territory, her cheap
ness of living, her variety ot climate and sim
plicity of life, the drain of Europe? Whatever
is bold and disconsolate to that point will pre
cipitate, and wuat you trample on in Europe
will sting you in America."
The anniversary that summons us here, it Is
true, is that of an honored Baint on the cal
endar of the Catholic church. In this, it seems
to me, there is a sort of poetic justice. The
English Government, in spite of the teachings
of universal history, has sought by all the in
penuity of her statesmen to destroy a religion
by persecution, as if it dreamed that the re
ligion which, under the persecutions of Rome,
nourished in tho recesses of the catacombs,
could not, under the persecutions of Britain,
flourish in the fastnesses of the Irish moun
tains in the hearts of a race which knows no
â uperior in fidelity to faith and principle.
Of the fidelity of the Irish people to their re
ligion under unparalleled pen-ecution Eng
lish history bears ample testimony. The Eng
lish Protestant historian, Lecky, says:
"They clung to their old faith with a con
stancy that has never been surpassed during
generations of the most galling persecution
at a time when every earthly motive urged
them to abandon it, when all the attraction
and influence of property and rank and pro
fessional eminence and education were
arrayed against it. They voluntarily sup
ported their priesthood with an unwearying
zeal when they were thus sunk in the most
abject poverty, when the aeonies of starvation
were continually before them."
It is not to be wondered at that the Irish
people, proscribed mainly on account of their
religion, should prize the mystic bond that
held them together in the embrace of an en
during nationality. It is not to be wondered
at that the festival of the man of God who
planted in their hearts that religion which
has, as it were, imparted in own perpetuity to
them as a race should be selected as the day to
â¢ing their songs of sadness and to prefer their
orisons to the God of justice and of nations for
their ultimate deliverance from injustice and
oppression.
lo the American whose religion and nation
ality are so distinct as they are required to be
under the divine injunction to "Render unto
Caesar such things as are Caesar's and unto
God the things that are God's," it seems
strange that an Irishman's loyalty to his race
and his faith should be blended in a manner
bo unique. This must be attributed to the op
pressor and not to his victim. It is not because
the Irish Catholic doe? not understand and
fully appreciate the relative allegiance that he
owes to his government and his God. It is not
that he wishes or would consent to the ascena
ency of any church within the state or the
imposition of its ceremonials or its support up
on thi masses of the people. He would be the
first, and rightly so, to resent and resist such a
wrong. Too long has he suffered from such a
Eystern, too ftrenuously .has he opposed it to
regard it as in the smallest degree defensible.
Whenever he has been permitted to voice his
sentiments on the subject he has been in favor
of religious liberty. When in 1689 the short
lived Catholic Parliament under James at
tempted to leeislate for Ireland one of its first
acts was to pass a law estab:ish:n? perfect re
ligious liberty in Ireland and, to use the lan
guage of Leeky, "Its enactment at Btich a mo
ment of excitement and passion reflects no
small credit on the Catholic Parliament."
When In more recent days, In the enlarged
enjoyment of the franchise, Catholics have
largely named the representatives for Ireland
In the imperial Parliament strong Catholic
constituencies have returned Protestant mem
bers, and we all know that for years the Catho
lics of Ireland stood as one man behind their
representative and leader in their struggleâ
the Protestant, diaries Stewart Parnell.
The Irish Catholics recognize that the strug
gle for Irish rights has largely been made by
their Protestant fellow-countrymen, wno hail
the vantage of the franchise and representa
tion in Parliament. They know that it was
the Protestant Grattan who uttered the noble
s-entiment, -'That we hold the risrhtsof private
judgment in matters of religion to be equally
sacred in others as ourselves," and who an
' * snotner time that "the Irish Prot
cs'ant could never be free v itil the Irish Cath
olic had ceased to be a slave."
Whatever national failing's Irishmen have,
ingratitude is not one of them. The memory
of the gentle-mannered Emmet, of the impet
uous Wolfe Tone, of the brilliant Fitzgerald, of
John Mitchel, of Thomas Davis, is as strongly
revered by the Irish Catholic as by his fellow
Protestant patriot.
The Catholic renders willing tribute to the
sentiment bo beautifully rendered by Thomas
Davis:
What matter that at different shrines
We pray unto one Qod?
What matter that at different times
' Our fathers won the sod?
In I'ortiiiie 'and in name we're bound
By stronger links than steel.
And neither can be sale or sound
But in the other's weal.
Oh. it were a sallant deed
To snow before mankind
How every race and creed * â 
Alight be by love combined ;
Might be combined, pet not forget
The fountains whence they rO3e,
As tilled by many a rivulet
. Xhe stately Shannon flows.
It has recently been suggested that this sen
timent, so well respected by Irishmen, is not
to obtain in this American Republic. 1 enter
tain no apprehension upon the subject. Eng
li.Â»h sympathizers or emissaries, for motives of
their own, may attempt to build up religious
discord among the citizens ol this Republic.
But their efforts must iail. Liberty of con
science is a principle Imbedded in'thevery
foundation of our form of government. Its
guarantees cannot be - disturbed wnile the re
public endures. The law of this land is the
law of universal emancipation, so eloquently
des>cril>ea by Curran. To adapt the language
O if: 1:1 , we may say that the soil of the Re
public is consecrated to the genius of universal
emancipation, alike for the native, the stran
ger, for the sojourner.
"No matter in what language his doom may
have been pronounced, no matter what com
plexion incompatible witii freedom an. lndian
or an African sun may have burned him, no
matter in what disastrous battle his liberty
may have been cloven down, no matter with
. â what solemnities he may have been devoted
upon the altar of slavery, the first moment
that he touches this sacred soil the altar ana
the god Kink into the dust. His soul walks
abroad in her own majesty, his body swells be
yond the measure ol its chains 'that burst
around him, and he stands forth redeemed, re
generated and disenthralled by the irresistible
â¢ genius of universal emancipation.'
This American Republic shall not retro
grade. It shall continue in the evolution of
its destiny and shall develop within its con
fines a race of people who shall stand foremost
in the world as exemplars of intelligence,
moral worth and of justice to fellow-man. The
people who struck down, the manacles from
the hands of four millions of black slaves will
not now countenance tbe disfranchisement or
â¢ proscription of ten millions of their fellow

Put Ireland's fate In the hands of the ad
vancing democracy of Great Britain, already
alive to the labors that lie between It and Its
ultimate triumph. Ally the Irish cause with
the party of popular rights. Of course this
movement will be opposed by those who dread
the power of the masses, anil who fear to en
trust them with the political power which be
longs to them. It will be opposed by the titled
aristocrats who demand U an hereditary en
joyment the right to live in idleness, luxury
and lust at the expense of the toiling millions.
1 do not fear the ultimate result of the strug
gle. The cause of human progress and human
liberty will triumph; the Irish nation will be
emancipated.
As we stand here to-night, linked in senti
ment with the living millions of the Celtic
race, we look with reverence upon the Gaelic
race and the Gaelic faith. Glorious Gaelic
land, too long hast thou been chained to thy
mountain rook, the bound l'ronietheus ot the
nations! Too long have the vultures of for
eign hate aud religious rancor gnawed upon
thy vitals! Full well hast thou guarded
through the centuries the sacred lire secured
from heaven and spread by thee among thy
fellow-peoples of the earth. In the lullncss of
time h new Hercules has come to thy deliver
ance.
Oh, glorious Gaelic faith, ingrained beyond
the blood into the spirit and the utmost at
tainable recesses of the Celtic soul, thou hast
preserved the race for the hour of deliverance.
And as we, living children of the race, wait
and watch for that hour of deliverance we
may imagine that out of their Gaelic heaven
, tiie ancient heroes look down upon us to-day
with infinite tenderness ana love for the chil
dren of their race in whom neither time nor
men could destroy the national character and
the national piety toward the immortal dead
who ouilt up that character stronger than
ribbed steel and stancher than the bedrock of
the world.
And the countless saints of Ireland and the
scribes and teachers, the high-souled bards
and dauntless chieftains look on. Aye. all the
empurpled legions of our martyrs" through
every century, who lived and diedfor the old
faith and the" preservation of its glowing treas
ures, all these stand together in paradise and
view thi3 scene with a boundless sympathy.
They recognize now that vast, patient, cosmic
justice of God which makes the very tongue of
the oppressor the broad channel by which the
whole world is filled with the "ardors and fan
cies and sympathies half divine 1 ' of the op
pressed Gael and by which his faith, his
strange, mystic, spiritual sense, hi? high tena
cious idealism, his deathless chivalry, his dar
ing, his valor and almost feminine delicacy of
feeling, are borne abroad and mingled with
the best elements oi humankind.
D. Manlloyd then sang Moore's "Minstrel
Boy" accompanied on the piano by Sydney
Hopecraft. Mr. Manlloyd has a silvery,
ringing tenor voice, which displayed its
power and ranee to great advantage in the
old song. As an encore he gave Joseph
Murphy's pathetic ballad, "A Handful of
Earth.'*'
The orchestra rendered an arrangement
of "Kathleen Mavourneen" with varia
tions, which was followed by the "Last
Rose of Summer," charmingly sung by
Miss Black, who gave in response to a cor
dial recall "The Four-leaved Shamrock."
John McAuliffe followed in "Kathleen
MaVourneen," with "The Cruiksheen
Lawn" as an encore. Miss Roney next
sang "The Bells of Shandon," accom
panied on the piano by Miss Giorgiani,
and to such purpose that nothing less than
"The Star-Spangled Banner" would sat
isfy the audience.
Then came "The Dear Little Sham
rock," sunc by Aliss Kirby, and a fine
rendering cf "Come Back to Erin," as a
quartet, by the Misses Sullivan and Black
and Messrs. Manlloyd and Wcods, after
which the programme ended with a bril
liant and ornate fantasia on American and
Irish National airs by the orchestra.
KNIGHTS OF ST. PATRICK.
They Celebrate the Day With a BMI-
llant Banquet.
The Knights of St. Patrick celebrated the
Irish national festival after their wonted
custom with a banquet last night in the
Delmonico. It was the twenty-first annual
gathering of the Knights around the festal
board in San Francisco and probably the
most successful of those brilliant events
for which the Irish society has become
justly (^ekhrated in the commemoration of
St. Patrick's day.
The guests to the number of 150 assem
bled in the parlors, off the banquet hall,
about 8 o'clock, and for fully an hour en
joyed themselves passing compliments of
the day. Each one was decorated with a
neat bow of orange and green, tied with a
bit of white silk ribbon. The orange and
green, of course, were intended to repre
sent the two colors carried by Irishmen,
and the white was emblematic of peace.
When all present entered the banquet
ball in pairs an imposing spectacle met
their gaze. The classic walls were draped
with white and green very lightly and
gracefully, and behind the president's
chair a quite pretentious display was
made. There hung an emerald green Mag
fringed with gold and emblazoned with a
gilt ha.rp and a wolfdog on one side, and
this emblem bore the legend, "Gentle
when stroked; fierce when provoked."
Opposite was a large American flag, and
between them both an altogether origi
nal conception in green, white and the
tricolor with shamrocks strewn over
them. A great floral harp occupied a
niche as a central piece for it all. The
tables were arranged in ttiree rows and
beautifully decorated with flowers scat
tered upon them and roses of spring
blossoms. For a menu card a golden harp
with a bright green background was at
each plate â a unique idea that contained
the toasts, the lull membership of the
Knights of St. Patrick, and a concluding
vcr^e from Moore's "Minstrel Boy."

Jeremiah Deasy, president of the
Knighs of St. Patrick, presided. In calling
the guests to order he welcomed them in a
happy if brief speech. "We are gathered
to-night," be said, "to do honor to Ire
land's patron saint, and I am glad to have
you around us here. I may remark that
the Knights of St. Patrick is anon-sec
tarian organization. I'm glad to have
Rev. Father Crowley at my right hand,
representing the Catholic church (ap
plause), and the Rev. Mr. Brewer, repre
senting the Episcopal church (cheers).
We have with us also the genial president
of the Caledonian Club, and also the popu
lar presiding officer of one friendly Celtic
club, the Cambrian Society, Mr. Thomas
Price."
The speaker was warmly applauded as
he concluded by directing the secretary to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 1896.
read letters of regret from Governor Budd,
Archbishop Riordan and Rev. P. C. Yorke
at their inability to be present at the meet
ing of the Knights.
"The Day We Celebrate" was drunk
with fervor, and James R. Kelly respond
ed to the toast. He Â«aid : "In every por
tion of the globe, wherever the children of
the Irish race are found, they will this day
turn longing eyes across the ocean and
with longing hearts think of the green
fields of Erin. . Itisadav on which the
holiest and noblest emotions spring up in
the Irish soul. Memories come back to
the Celt wherever he may be."
The lesson of fidelity to faith an 1 father
land presented by the Irish people, Mr.
Kelly said, was a shining mark to the
world, and something of which Irishmen
might well feel proud. Turning to the
political aspect of Ireland, he declared that
the scene was changed, and had changed
from one of dire oppression of 100 years
ago to the dawn of liberty of to-day. But
Ireland has not completely freed herself
from the grasp of her despoilers, much as
her condition has improved. Ireland,
however, will never rest until, through her
indomitable courage and will, she becomes
the mistress of her own destiny.
The speaker held that Irishmen should
not forget the past because it was en
shrouded in gloom and sorrow. That
made it dea/er, and it would be a power
ful factor in the trend of the future for
Ireland's advancement and freedom.
Never has the feel'.ng been more unani
mous throughout the English-speaking
world than to-day that Ireland should
have emancipation, that she should be al
lowed to govern herself and be a nation.
May God hasten the blessed day, and when
it shall come a cry of joy will "go up from
the nations and Erin will throw on" her
mourning robe and become what blessed
Patrick intended she should beâ the pride
of civilization of Western Europe. Mr.
Kelly was enthusiastically applauded as
he sat down.
When "The United States of America"
was proposed as a toast by the chairman
the hall rang with loud and hearty hur
rahs that were repeated and grew in
warmth and enthusiasm until the toast
was drunk. Colonel Thomas F. Barry re
sponded. In his introduction the speaker
declared that when the tirst great struggle
for American liberty came the Irish were
to be found with Washington. The Irish
regiment in the War of the Rebellion had
as its motto, "No retreat."
He paid many high and eloquent, trib
utes to the United States for her greatness
and her doctrines of liberty and equality.
All that is noble and sublime in civiliza
tion and advancement is to be found in
the United States. But the material qual
ities alone were not enough to sustain a
nation in her high place, there was some
thing more â the spiritual. The noble
quality that made Americans right at Val
ley Forge.
America owes it to freedom, to peace, to
justice, that she stand for Cuba's rights,
for Venezuela against the oppressors.
Colonel Barry, continuing, suid ttuit it was
due to* Ireland that America stand up
against Eneland and thereby give the suf
fering country, if not absolute independ
ence, at least home rule.
The orchestra played "Hail, Columbia"
while the merry party gavo three rousing
cheers.
James D. Phelan spoke in response to
the toast, "The Poets and Orators bf
Ireland."
"Civil and Religious Liberty," was pro
posed and James H. Barry in an able" ad
dress responded.
"California," was the next toa*t, to
which John .1. Barrett replied.
"Celtic Unity," was drunk with great
cordiality and received responses from D.
It. McNeil, chief of the Caledonian Club,
and Thomas Price, president of the Cam
brian Society.
"The Ladies," the last toast, received a
response from Colonel John O'Bryne.
LUMPS SHONE BRIGHTLY
Fair Women and Soldierly Men
at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Mechanics' Pavilion la9t night was
bright with the faces of three thousand
fair women and glittering with the silver
and gold accouterments of as many
soldierly men.
The third anniversary ball and military
and naval drill of the California Garrison
No. 101 of the Regular Army and Navy
Union was a brilliant success.
The ball was opened by the Fifth Artil
lery band rendering "Under the Double
Eagle." Then Commander F. G. Wisker
welcomed in a short, appropriate speech
the Krieger Verein, under command of
Captain Wincker, and Captain Wincker
responded briefly and appropriately.
After the interchange of these military
courtesies a battery of the Fifth United
States Artillery asinfantry. under com
mand of Sergeant G. \V. Harvey, Fifth
Artillery, went through several evolutions
I with much precision and brilliancy. The
men carried the new Krag-Jorgensen
rifles.
One of the most interesting features of
the programme was the evolutions by the
Second Gun Division, Naval Battalion,
N. G. G., under command of Lieutenant
Junior Grade \V. F. Burke. The skill of
the white uniformed men and their rapid
movements with the Hotchkiss gun pro
voked great applause.
Following this was a paber drill by a
troop of the Fourth United States Cava l ry,
under command of First Sergeant L. \V.
Moflitt, Fourth Cavalry. In the interims
of the drills the Fifth Artillery band
played '-The Lily of Killarney,'" "The
Rage of Ireland" and the national pot
pourri.

LIQUOR MEN WANT
HIGH LICENSE
Are Desirous of Being
Permitted to Regulate

The Governor, They Say, Is
About to Steal Their
Thunder.
OFFER TO ACT AS CENSORS.
The Movement Backed by a Member
ship of 8000, Employing 65,000
People.
In the California State Protective Asso
ciation this State has a most powerful and
energetic influence at work, according to
the statement of its president, J. P. Edoff,
for the taking of the liquor traffic out of
politics.
Briefly outlined the plan of the associa
tion is to secure a high license in every
county of the State. It is thus hoped to
keep out of the retail liquor business irre
sponsible individuals from a commercial
standpoint, and those who do not bear a
thoroughly good reputation in the com
munity in which, they intend to carry on
their business.
Incidentally, the policy includes a sort
of censorship over the issuing of licenses
throughout the State. But this feature of
the work of the association is made clear
a:id unmistakable by a clause included in
a recent petition to the local Board of
Police Commissioners, and copies of which
petition, suitably modified, have been sent
to every liquor-licensine power in the
State. It raads as follows:
It is to be presumed that your honorable
body has at hand the ready means, through
the instrumentality of your police force, to
ascertain the places and establishments in the
City whose past methods and present practices
forfeit the right to license privileges, bat. in
case our co-operation in this behalf is desired,
our organization will furnish you the names
of Biich places as we believe are unworthy to
hold a liquor license by reason of their abuse
of its privileges.
President Edoff, on being asked 3'ester
dey to give a full history of the associa
tion and its proposed line of action and
the motive actuating its creation, was at
first loath to speak of the matter, but on
further consideration said he would go
thoroughly into its status nnd proposed
plans and then ieave it to the public to
judge of the justice and fairness of the
work of the association. Thiswashis tale:
"About two years ago the wholesale
liquor dealers of San Francisco formed the
California Protective Association. That
association had as members every repu
table wholesale liquor dealer in San Fran
cisco and California. The object of that
association was two-fold.
"First â To get the entire whisky prob
lem out of politic*.
"Becondâ To elevate the traffic.
''By elevating the traific we mean this:
We recognized that we were better able to
handle the traffic In our particular line of
business than any temperance organiza
tiou or those back of any temperance
movement could handle it.
"The outgrowth of that association was
the present organization known as trie
California State Protective Association,
which takes in not only the wholesale
liquor-dealer, out also all reputable retail
liquor-dealers in the State. This new
organization was formed in December, 1894.
"We take in the reputable retail dealers
for the purpose of being better able to pro
tect the trallic throughout the State, and
with the further object in view of getting
the various local governments to join with
us in a movement to prevent a license be
ing issued to any man who does not bear a
good reputation, and for the revocation of
tne license of any man who does not
properly conduct his place.
"In order to make the situation perfectly
clear I will have to go back a little. We
went before the last Legislature and asked
them to pass two measures. One was to
amend the County Government act so as
to permit of local option. The other was
to pass, not a uniform license, but a law
that would fix the minimum license at
$300 a year. In our argument before the
Senate Judiciary Committee we demon
strated that if this minimum license was
insisted upon the revenue of the State
would be increased by $2,800,000, and that
only three localities in the State would
have their revenue decreased. These
would be the city of Oakland and the
counties of Ik>s Angelos and San Diego.
"The Senate Judiciary Committee ad
mitted that the recommendation was a
good one, but they refused to recommend
a bill containing .it because it would be
considered a legal recognition of the liquor
traffic. We claim, however, that they
have recognized it legally by delegating it's
control to local boards.
"And now comes Governor Budd follow
ing up the movement we started. He is
now engaged in sending out a circular to
all the County Clerks in the State for the
purpose of compiling statistics with the
view of recommending this very plan that
we were the first to suggest. He may thus
be truthfully said to be stealing our
thunder.
"It seems inexplicable to us why our
recommendation was not favorably acted
upon. We represent some 8000 members,
giving employment to 05,000 people, auil
have a joint capital invested of more than
1100,000,000, and still the Senate commit
tee would not recommend the very thing
that the Governor is now going to recom
mend to the Legislature in his next mes
sage, as we believe.
"One of the arguments advanced for the
failure to act favorably on our measure
was that it would take away from the
local boards the power of local govern
ment, yet the Governor is about to recom
mend the same thing. Surely we should
be recognized in Vis matter. Our mem
bers, 8000 strong, extend from Siskiyou to
San Diego, and they are entitled to some
rights in the matter under consideration,
particularly when we are honest and
anxious in our endeavors to reform the
traffic within ourselves. We can refer to
the City councils of Oakland and Los An
geles and to the Board of Police Commis
sioners of this City as to the sincerity of
this association, and whether or not we
have been a help in handling this matter.
"It is my personal determination, so far
as this association is concerned, to keep
the movement out of politics in the en
deavor to accomplish the desired result,
but if it requires going into politics, we
will go into it. It is a matter of protection
to us. And we will not go into politics as
supplicants either. And neither will we
allow any party to use us as their catspaw
to pull their chestnuts out of the fire.''
'â¢Has any action been taken by the local
authorities on the proposition of your asso
ciation to aid them in determining to whom
licenses shall be issued?" was asked.
"No," was the reply, "the action of
Chief Crowley in tendering his resigna
tion has drawn attention away from most
ell other matters, but in a few days there
will be an interview between the trustees
of the association and the Board of Police
Commissioners to take up the matter."
President Edoff then explained more in
detail how the association expected the
measure that it advocated would take the
liquor traffic question out of politics.
'â¢In the past when an election was near,"
he said, "it was not unusual for the whole
sale liquor-dealer to be approached by a
candidate for election as a member of the
Board of Supervisors of some county with
a request to render him assistance in his
political fight. This was not always made
directly by the candidate, but more fre
quently came through one of onr custom
er* in the particular county and district in
which the candidate resided. If we re
fused, which we usually felt it our duty to
do, and the individual whose fight we re
fused to aid was elected, the newly elected
Supervisor awaking some morning with a
bad taste in his mouth, remembering our
failure to eive him support and being
aware of the public sentiment against the
liquor traffic, would introduce some drastic
measure aimed at our interests, and the
chnnceÃ would be that it would be passed.
"With the traffic regulated, as we sug
gest, all this will be done away with, as
only reputable men will be able to go into
the' business, and the local legislators will
no longer have power to blackmail the |
wholesale liquor dealers.
"It is not the purpo-e of our association
to encourage the infraction of the laws j
that have been passed to regulate the re- |
tail liquor trade. On tne contrary, it is
onr desire to see those laws strictly en
forced, and we shall do everything to help
the authorities in that regard. Let
me recite you a case that will well
illustrate what our position in this
matter is. Not long ago a saloon-keeper
in Oakland named Vananee was arrested
on a charge of selling liquor to a minor,
lie was a member of our association and
at once hurried over to this side and called
on me to aid him. I asked him if he had
sold liquor to a minor and he tried to evade
the question, but 1 insisted on an answer.
He finally said : 'I guess I did.' lat once
ordered him out of the office and told him
that I would instruct the counsel of the
to aid in his prosecution. which
'idid.
"If the law providing for a $300 minimum
is passed a State commission should also
be provided for to act as a board of
licenses, whose duty it will be to deter
mine who are proper persons to hold
licenses. Senator Sherman has said that
it was only a measure of this kind that
removed the whisky traffic from politics in
Ohio. The passage of such a law would, j
of course, obviate the necessity of the
existence of our association.
â¢ "We have now in good running order
thirty-eight county auxiliary associations
in the State, in as many counties, and hope
to extend the branches' to every county.
"One of the important qualification's for
membership is that the applicant shall be
of good reputation and shall never have
been convicted in any court of a crime."
According to the by-laws of the associa
tion its power is permanently centralized
among the wholesale liquor dealers of this
City. The board of trustees, which is the
governing body of the organization, can
only be elected from the locnl wholesale
merchants in the liquor business. The
trustees at present are: J. P. Edoff, presi-
Ident; E. It. Lilienthal, vice-president;
William Alfs, treasurer; J. H. Mundy,
Fred Staude, Joseph M. Loew, Thomas
Kirkpafrick, Rudolph Tanssig, Henry M.
Campe and John Wolf. Wintield Scott is
secretary of the association and George W.
Baker is the attorney.
Absolute and complete control over the
entire business of the association is vested
in the board of txustess. One of the by
laws says: "They shall determine its
policy, shape its course and manage its af
fairs in such a manner as shall seem to
them to be most conducive to the welfare,
advancement and business prosperity of its
members."
Another by-law relative to county aux
iliary associations reads : "Theylshall.un
der no circumstances in the name of the
association espouse the cause of any polit
ical party or candidate, unless such action
is necessary to protect the interests of the
association, and then only of such candi
dates for such offices as directly affect this
association or its members."
The political restriction on individnal
members is thus prescribed: I *AH mem
bers of this association are absolutely pro
hibited, under any and all drcuni stances,
from taking up, .as firms or individuals,
any matters of State or local issues.
â¢ â¢ * In the event of any member of
the association violating this article the
penalty will be a line of not less than $500,
and, if not paid, expulsion from this asso
ciation." ____________

OPEN REPUBLICAN
PRIMARIES GO
The County Committee Will
Have Charge of the
Election.
SPRECKELS WINS AGAIN.
The Fifth Congressional Com
mittee Acts in Hearty
Accord.
CLARKSON AND PARTY LEAVE.
The Allison Boom Has Found Fruitful
Soil in California and the
Pacific Coast.
The Republican affairs of the Fifth Dis
trict relating to the State Convention were
harmoniously and definiteU settled at a
meeting of the Congressional committee of
that district yesterday forenoon.
The committee unanimously referred to
the county committees of the district the
selection of delegates to the State conven
tion, deciding with practical unanimity
that this was the wisest and fairest course
and the one most in harmony with the
spirit and methods of the party.
This action was another decided victory
for John D. SprecKels and the policy he is
endeavoring to carry out in the interest of
clean politics and party harmony.
The representatives of Santa Clara and
Pan Mateo counties in this committee and
the State Central committeemen repre
senting those counties were inclined at 1
first to constitute a faction by themselves,
and there was Jast week some danger
that a lack of harmony in the committee
would result. Yesterday, however, they
joined with the friend* of John D. Spreck
els in all that was done.
The committee met at 11 A. M. in the law
office of John E. Richards in the Crocker
building, and the meet fng lasted a little
over an hour. Six of the seven members
were present, as follows: Chairman J. W.
Rea of Santa Clara. Secretary John E.
Richards, Robert L. Toplitz, A* L. Stetson
and C. S. Laumeister of San Francisco; W.
B. Lawrence of San Mateo. William Moir
of Santa Clara was represented by Louis
Montgomery, proxy.
The minutes were approved and then
the resolution referring the matter of the
selection of delegates to the county com
mittees, which was informally discussed at
the tirst meeting, last Saturday, was pre
sented by John E. Richards.
C. S. Laumeister offered an amendment
to the second section of the resolution, the
amendment providing that selection of
delegates be under the exclusive manage
ment of the individual county committee
men from the respective Assembly dis
tricts. Discussion showed that the amend
ment would take all power and supervision
from the county committee?. Tne repre
sentative of each Assembly district in this
City, for instance, would have exclusive
control of the selection of delegates. The
amendment was defeated by six votes,
Laumeister's being the only affirmative
one.
The original resolution was then put and
carried by six votes. The resolution is
as follows":
Whereas, At the meeting of the members of
the Republican State Central Committee from
the Fifth Congressional District of the State of
California, duty and regularly called and held
on the 12th day of March, 189G, at Redwood
City in the county of San Mateo, State of Cali
fornia, at which said meeting all of the said
members from said district were present, a
resolution was duly and regularly adopted
providing tha.t the following named seven
persons, electors and residents of said Fifth
Congressional District, should be and were
thereby appointed as the committee of seven
persons from the residents of such district who
should act as Con} ressional committee thereof,
to wit: Robert L. Toplitz, John E. Richards, A.
L. Stetson, C. S. Laumeister, W. B. Lawrence,
James \V. Rea and William Moir; and whereas,
at the said meeting a resolution was also duly
and regulariy adopted providing "that it is the
sense of this committee that the manner and
supervision of the selection of delegates to the
State convention should be left in the hards of
the county committees oi the several coun
ties" ; and wh3reas, it is the sense of said com
mittee that local self-government should be
maintained and accorded to the electors of
each political subdivision of this State and
district within which elections are to be held,
anu that the management and control of such
elections should be placed in the hands of the
regularly constituted committees of the Re
publican party within such ai.strict, subject
only to the supervision of this committee and
in accordance with this resolution and call of
the Republican National Committee and of
the iState Central Committee duly and regu
larly passed at the recent respective meetings
thereof, now, therefore, it is hereby
Resolved, Firstâ That it is in harmony with
the principles of the Retiublicau party of the
Slate of California, and it is essential to its
success in the coming State and National ca-n
--paign, that every effort should be put forth
and every means adopted, by the regulariy or
ganized agencies and committees of the Re
publican narty to secure an honest selection of
delegates to tiie State mid District Republican
conventions oi the State of California, and to
the Republican National Convention. â¢
Secondâ That to tnat end It shall be and is
Hereby ordered that the Republican County
committees in the several counties, and por
tions thereof, constituting the Fifth Congres
sional District of the State of California, shall
be and are hereby given the power and discre
tion to determine within their respective coun
ties the manner and supervision of the selec
tion of delegates to the said Stnte and district
conventions, and to provide for the selection
thereof by appointment or by primary elec
tions within the ; r respective counties as in
their eaid discretion shall seem best, in order
to carry out the foregoing purposes.
Thirdâ That the test tor voters at such pri
mary election as may be held shall be: "I be
lieve in Republican principles and indorse the
Republican policy, and intend to support the
nominees of The Republican party."
Fourthâ That a Congressional district con
vention of the delegates to be selected as above
set forth shall be and is hereby called to meet
at the City of Sacramento, State of California,
on Tuesday, May â , 1896, for the purpose of
selecting two delegates to the Republican Na
tional Convention to be held at the city of St.
Louis, in the State of Missouri, on Tuesday,
June 16, 1896, and to represent the Raid Fifth
Congressional District ot the State of Califor
nia in such convention, and for the selection
of two alternate delegate! to act in case of the
absence of the delegates tirst chosen, and to do
and perform such other business as may come
before said district convention.
Fifthâ That the details of holding and con
ducting such above-named primary elections
as may be held in th-j various election pre
cincts "of the said Fifth Congressional. District,
and of appointing and equipping the election
officers required under the law to conduct
said election within said district 'and of pro
viding all necessary assistance to such election
oflieers, and the ballot-boxes, ballots, registers
and other material and paraphernalia f or the
proper conduct of such primary election shall
be and is hereby delegated and intrusted to
the membersot the present Republican County
Central Committee of the the counties of
San ta Clara and San Mateo respectively, and
to those members of the Republican County
Central Committee of the City of San Francisco
from the several Assembly districts within said
Fifth Congressional District, said Republican
County Central commit tees, or portion thereof,
respectively, to conduct said primary election
within their and each of tlieir respective coun
ties under the genera! supervision and control
of this committee, aud that the said membersof
the county committee, respectively, shall be
and are hereby authorized and empowered to
provide for the time and place of holding and
to conduct said primary election within their
respective portions of said district and to cer
tify the vote cast et their primary election
from the various election precincts within
their respective counties in said district and
the names of the delegates selected ;n their re
spective counties and portions thereof to this
committee, w hicn will act as a returning |
board thereon and will certify the result there
to the aforesaid State and district conven
tions.
Sixthâ That all contests arising out of or
concerning said primary election must be
tiled with the secretary of this Congressional
committee in writing, with a full statement of
the ground of contest, at least fifteen days
preceding the meeting of said State Conven
tion, and this committee shall determine such
contest and shall have the power in its dis
cretion to call and hold another primary eiec
tion in such contested precincts and to can
vass, declare and certify the result thereof.
The feature of the above resolution,
which gives the power to select delegates
to the county committees, was in part suz
gested by J.W. Rea of Santa Clara and
George C. Ross of San Mateo. The sug
gestion embodied in the resolution above
quoted was adopted last Thursday on mo
tion of George 0. Ross at the meeting of
State Central committeemen in Redwood
City, at which the Congressional commit
tee was appointed.
The secretary was instructed to officially
notify the county committees concerned
of the action taken and to instruct them to
promptly transmit to the Congressional
committee returns of primary elections
when any such elections are held.
There was considerable discussion of the
question of the number of delegates to the
State convention and their correct appor
tionment. Samuel M. Shortridge, who
was present, called attention to the uncer
tainty of the apportionment, and the call
adopted by the State Central Committee
left the matter somewhat indefinite. This
call provides that each Assembly district
shall be entitled to one delegate, and in ad
dition one for each 200 votes cast for M. M.
Estee for Governor or a fraction of 100 votes
or over. There was a discussion as to the
proper authority to officially declare the
apportionment, and it was decided that it
was the executive committee of the State
Central Committee. The secretary was in
structed to request the executive commit
tee to make the apportionment.
The committee then adjourned to meet
at the call uf the chair.
By the action, then, of this committee
yesterday the county committees of the
Fifth District are given full power to select
delegates in any manner they deem best â
either by primary elections or by appoint
ment. In Santa Clara County there are
three Assembly Districts and San Mateo
County is one Assembly District.
The ' Fifth district includes seven of the
eighteen Assembly Districts in the City
and County of San Francisco. They are
"the Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth, Thirty
sixth, Thirty-seventh, Thirty-eighth, For
tieth and Forty-first. The County Com
mittee of San" Francisco will not have
jurisdiction as a whole over the selection
of delegates from these districts. The bus
iness will be done by that portion of the
committee representing Assembly districts
in the Fifth Congressional District. For
I this purpose the seven county committee
men from the districts named will practi
cally constitute a county committee.
The county committee men who will
manage the selection of delegates in that
portion of the City lying in the Fifth Con
gressional District are: Tbirtv-fourth Dis
trict, John Jackson; Thirty-fifth, I. H.
Thompson; Thirty-sixth, C. W. Manwar
ing; lhirty-seventh, James Alva Watt;
Thirty-eighth, Grove Ayers; Fortieth,
Jesse E. Marks; Forty-first. C. G. Clinch.
Whether the County Committees of San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties will ap
point delegates or hold a primary is not
definitely determined.
The County Committee of San Francisco
will proceed to hold an open primary for
the selection of delegates from this City -to
the State Convention or, more accurately,
the aggregation of seven Congressional
conventions. The members of the County
Committee, John D. Spreckels and the
large majority of the local party favor this
pJan without reserve. The County Com
mittee will be officially notified at once of
its powers and duties as expressed in the
resolution adopted yesterday. The com
mittee will hold a meeting during the j
latter pan of this week or early next week |
to issue a call for a primary and to other- j
wise prepare for the election.
As the regular Congressional committee |
of the Fourth District has already referred
the selection of delegates to the County
Committee, this committee now lias the
primary for the entire City in its hands in
the regular and usual way. The same
policy and method will be pursued un
doubtedly in both districts, but the united
sentiment and decision of the committee
will be officially segregated between the
representatives of tne two districts, each
body issuing a call and appointing election |
officers.
A CLUB WITH A RECORD.
The Howard Republican Club Is
Booming and Ambitious.
The Howard Republican Club held a
rousing meeting in the largest hall of
Pythian Castle at 909 Market street last
evening. There were more numbers pres
ent than there were chairs and genuine
Republican campaign enthusiasm was dis
played.
The main features of the evening's pro
ceedings were addresses by Colonel T. V.
Eddy and others, sones by Messrs. Gal
lagher, Barrett and others, and the adop
tion of a strong resolution in favor of an
open primary election. Speeches, songs
and resolutions were vigorously applauded.
The resolution was as follows:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this club that
it is lor the best interests of the Republican
party and essential to harmony and success
thatin the selection of delegates to the Na
tional, State and Municipal conventions, open
primaries be held with equal representation to
all parties.
The Howard Club is one of the oldest, !
largest and best known Republican clubs j
in the City. It was organized twelve years '
ago by Phil Crimmins, and for sometime j
its membership was largely confined to the i
district south of Market street. It has i
grown, prospered and widened, been a j
strong factor in every Republican cam
paign for years, and now its 300 members
represent nearly every district in the City
and include a" large number of leading
Republicans. It proposes to be the lead
ing uniformed club of the City during the
coming campaign, and to be a* central club
rather than one representing any particu
lar section of the City. It includes a great
many of the friends of John D. Spreckels,
and its members unanimously indorse the
policy which Mr. Spreckels is endeavoring
to see carried out in the party.
The club resumed its bi-weekly meetings
in December last, and on December 17
elected the following officers for the en
suing year: President, C. E. Newman;
first vice-president. Fred Fry; second vice
president, Ernest Litchen ; third vice-presi-

HOW "JIM" REA STANDS.
Approves the Leadership of John
D. Spreckels and Foresees
Party Success.
James W. Rea of San Jose, chairman
of the Fifth Congressional Committee, was
asked by a Call reporter after the meeting
yesterday how the action of the committee
ana the situation in the Fifth District
suited him.
"I am pleased with the situation," he
said. "At first I was not inclined to join
the forces of Mr. Spreckels, but after hav
ing talked with him, and become more
fully acquainted with his plans. I found
that he waÃ for clean, straight politics, and
that he advocated open primaries, thereby
recognizing local self-government by
means of which a full expression of public
sentiment may be had.
"And beyond this, 1 recognized in Mr.
Spreckels a man of education and train
ing, fit to lead the forces of the Republi
can party; a man possessed of great force
of character and successful in large busi
ness enterprises. He has displayed in
whatever he has undertaken the qualities
of leadership.
"The politics of the State of California
has long needed such a leader, and, recog
nizing his abilities in that direction, I
have concluded to join forces with him.
He has come up logically as the leader of
the Republican party in this State, and it
is universally admitted that he possesses
character and ability to treat all interests
fairly and justly, and harmonize all ele
ments of the party."
"You are pleased, then, with the condi
tion of the affairs of the Fifth Congres
sional District?"
"Very much, indeed," said Mr. Rea. "I
am satisfied that the people will approve
of the action of the committee, ana that*
the Republican party will carry the dis
trict by a- large majority."
GEN. CLARKSON DEPARTS.
Goes North With His Party to
Talk Business and
Allison.
General J. 8. Clarkson of lowa and
his party, consisting of State Senator W.
H. Andrews of Pennsylvania, Major Ford
of Dcs Moines, lowa, and JL W. Barnes,
stenographer, departed for Portland last
evening.
B. F. Allen of Los Angeles, an old lowa
friend of Mr. Clarkson, who accompanied
the party northward from Los Angeles,
will return south. On the northward trip
the party will be accompanied by H. A.
McCraney, deputy clerk of the State Su
preme Court, and one or two other friends.
The stay of Clarkson and his party has
been brief, they having arrived on Sunday.
The members of the party have worked a
little pleasure into their bu?<y hours, but
their time has been mainly occupied in re
ceiving callers and attending to private
business matters, those of Mr. Clarkson re
lating^to his California mining interests.
During Sunday, Monday and yesterday
there was a constant stream of visitors to
the Palace Hotel quarters of the party.
Tne visitors included nearly all the lead
ing Republicans of the City and a great
number of lowans and others who called
as friends of General Clarkson or Senator
Allison, or both. Many Pennsylvania's
too called upon Senator Andrews, who is
handsome, magnetic and politic.
General Clarkson has firmly planted in
California the Allison boom, wnich he is
looking after as he proceeds on hia tour.
What he has said in the course of the in
terviews with him published since his
arrival in the State has been widely noted,
and the wisdom of the main things he has
said has been generally recognized. Mr.
Clarkson's discussion of Senator Allison
as a strong Presidential candidate has
somewhat brought out the extent to which
Mr. Allison is esteemed on the Pacific
Coast and the immense number of personal
friends and admirers he has out here.
"I have found that the Pacific Coast
States and Territories contain friends of
all the men most prominently talked of
as Presidential candidates," said Mr.
Clarkson as he stopped to talk a minute
! before leaving; "but there is also a gen
i eral disposition to wait and see wriat is
I best for the party. I think that seven of
| the Pacific Coast States â those of the
j Rocky Mountain region and westward â
! will send unpledged delegations to the
I National Convention and will wield there
j a power they have not wielded before.
j The Republican party is going to be
i guided this year by sense instead of senti
j ment, as General Williams of Indiana said
|to me recently. Nobody will be nomi-
I nated on the first ballot. McKinley will
j get between 280 and 300 votes on the first
| ballotâ not more than 300. There have
I been 100 delegates elected in the South,
i and he has not got more than half oi
j them. Well, the time will early come,
i when the hurrah subsides and the fire
| works are out, that the convention will se
! riousiy think of what is best for the party
and be guided by that judgment."
"I observe that Allison is very strong in
this State," said H. A. McCraney, who is
j one of the Californians from lowa. "Mc
; Kinley and Reed have many friends, too.
| There are a good many Maine men in this
State, and they are naturally friendly to
j Reed, while he has many other admirers
j through the party.
"But the Slate is fullof Allison's friends,
especially the southern part. There are
thousands of lowans here. In Pasadena
and neighborhood alone there is an associ
ation numbering 2600. Every lowan is
with Allison from the jump.
â¢'A very great number of them have
known him personally, and everybody
that has every known him loves him. He
has-a great big heart in him. When he
says that he will do anything for a friend
he will probably do more than was asked,
and he is always loyal to his friends. No
man in public life has so unblemished a
record. His life has been clean. He is a
statesman, a man of intellect and
character, loved by those who know
him personally ana respected and ad
mired by others. So besides the
lar^e sti re. It is finished in first-class
stj'le thr( uehout ard is supplied with all
modern conveniences, including elevator.
lowans in California there is a
great number who have great admiration
and esteem for him and who recognize his
worth and the many things that would
make him a popular and available candi
date."
Allison buttons have been dispensed in
wholesale quantities to callers at Clark
son's headquarters. The party will visit
Tacoma and Seattle, then go to Montana,
returning to Chicago by way of Salt Lake
City.
The McKinley Club.
The McKinley Club of the Forty-first
Assembly District has issued a circular of
appeal to the Republicans of that district
inviting prompt co-operation in an effort
to arouse early interest, in the broad issues
of the coming campaign. The appeal urges
party harmony in the interest of the prin
ciples of tne party and states that though
the club was given the name it bears in its
organization three years aco it has no pre
ferred candidate. It invites attendance at
a meeting to be held to-morrow evening in
Pixley Hall, corner of Polk and Pacific
streets, at which speeches will be made.
H. C. Firebaugh is president of tne club
and John S. Daley secretary.

Ellis street last niaht and elected two
lieutenants.
This company, one of the oldest in this
City, is the historical one of which Captain
Bacon was the first commander. Previous
to the reorganization of the guard under
the present administration, it and Com
pany X formed part of the Second Artillery
Regiment, and these were merged into the
First Regircent. When this was done the
companies decided to leave the armory at
Page and Gough streets and quarter with
the Nationals in the Ellis-street armory.
By the consolidation of regiments and
the many changes following the company
found itself without lieutenants, and for
that reason an election was called for and
Captain Weeenerof Brigadier Warfield's
staff was detailed to preside.
Ninety members out of ninety -nine
answered rollcall last night, and the result

pany X, First Regiment. N. G. C.
[From a photograph.]
of the election was the choosing of F. A.
Nippert for the office of first lieutenant,
promoted from second lieutenant. Private
W. A. Masury was elected to second lieu
tenant.
Lieutenant Nippert has been connected
with the company for six years. After the
first year he was appointed corporal, the
second year he was promoted to first ser
geant and in September was elected sec
ond lieutenant.
Second Lieutenant Masury enlisted six
years ago, but for a time left Company F
to serve in 1 roop A. In '93 he returned to
the company. Both men are very popular
amone their comrades.
After the result bad been declared Cap
tain Miller called upon Lieutenant-Colonel
Victor Duboce and Major C. L. Tilden.who
each made short addresses.
Six members of the company who speak
the Hawaiian language and call them
selves the Hawaiian sextet sang several
Sonus of the islands and there followed an
old-time "smoke."
Company F has turned out more general
officers than any company. Brigadier
Last of the First Brigade, Brigadier Muller
of the Third Brigade, Colonel Macdonald
<>f the First Repiment and Lieutenant-
Colonel Duboce have all been members of
this company.

see. and 67 years of age. He came to Cali
fornia in 1849 by the isthmus route, and
settled at first in the Santa Clara Valley.
He was for years interested in the lumber
business in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
residing at Saratoga. He was a partner of
Doughtery, also well known in the lumber
business of Santa Cruz. In 1865 they
transferred their base of operations to
Trinidad, Humboldt County, and in 1872
Mr. Smith returned to San Francisco and
for eight years thereafter controlled the
lath business of the coast. When in 1880
he retired he was accounted to be worth
half a million. Owing to unfortunate land
investments in Contra Costa County and
in an unremunerative stock farm in Fresno
this fortune was dissipated, however, so
that lie iiied a poor man. He was very
active in politics in his active days, and
was largely instrumental in securing the
nomination of H. H. Haight for Governor
a quarter of a century ago. He also spent
money like water to secure the election of
J. H. Pudd to Congress in the memorable
buckboard campaign of 1882. Mr. Smith's
circumstances were so limited that he
sought a political appointmentof Governor
Kudd a year a^o, and was promise t one,
but the promise, his friends claim, was
ignored.

NEW PUBLICATIONS.
Thomas Carpenter and E. L. Marshall,
proprietor of the Telegram, had an alter
cation on the street this evening that
almost came to blows. Marshall has been
saying harsh things of Carpenter's Ameri
canism, as Carpenter is prominent in the
A. P. A. agitation. Carpenter jumped
from his buggy on Park street as he espied
Marshall at the southeast corner of Park
street and Santa Clara avenue, and marie
for him in a menscing manner. The two
men jawed and called each other names
for awhile, when Carpenter drew off as
though to strike Marshall. The latter
drew back and declared that if Carpenter
struck him he would be sorry, and then
the quarrel was dropped and the parties
went their respective ways.
Attempted Suicide.
ALAMED4, Cal., March 17.â A man
named Hayes attempted to commit suicide
to-night by swallowing a dose of carbolic
acid. The man's rash act was caused by
despondency, brought on by drink. He
conducts a plumbers-shop on Park street.
His identity could not be learned. Dr.
Zeyn pulled him out of danger.
Do Not Relish It.
ALAMEDA. Cal.. March 17.â Alameda
does not relish the idea of having the
"nasty" cases of Oakland brought here
for trial. J. B. Morrison, a sailmaker,
charged with assaulting a young girl
named Stella Dietrich, was arrested on a
warrant issued by Justice Morris, sworn

to by Mrs. Prescott of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 'Mor
rison has a sail loft on the Oakland side,
near Alice-street, bridge. Warrants are
i out for two other men, one of whom is a
| sailor on theElectra and the other a rno
| terraan. None of the parties reside in
Alameda, nor were the offenses as alleged
committed in the city limits.
Hyacinth Thief.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 17.â Alameda
is worried by a flower thief who has a
i penchant for hyacinths. He goes around
in the dark and with the unerring instincts
of a gopher discovers and despoils the
finest plants though in the dark. He may
have takÂ°n note of and marked the places
where there were the finest plants before
nightfall. At any rate be is worrying the
householders who have gardens. One in
dignant gentleman offers $20 for informa
tion that will lead to the apprehension of
the miscreant.
School Census Marshal.
ALAMEDA. Cal., March 17.â J. J. Bal

Irish national colors conspicuous. Many
of the track officials were resplendent in
bright green scarfs, with the shamrock
and "Harp that once through Tara'a halls"
displayed on the coat lapel. The pro
gramme was priuted on green cardboard,
as were the admission tickets. Certainly
the heart of every Irishman present must
have been stirred by the display in honor
of Erin's Isle, which, no doubt, in a way
accounted for the extra heavy wagering.
Excluding "ladies' day," the crowd was
the largest of the meeting. Seven full
events were run off, which included a PÂ°lo
pony handicap for gentlemen riders. The
weather was perfect for racing purposes
and the sun's rays had worked wonders
toward putting the track in its usual
superb condition. Three favorites, three
second choices and a fourth choice drew
down the purse?.
The attraction especially prepared for
the occasion was the Shamrock handicap,
notable as marking a reunion and family
gathering of the Murphy family of sprint
ers, Pat. Tim and Babe, which trio tried
conclusions at five and a half furlongs. In
the judges' stand Captain Kees, presiding
judge, resigned temporarily in favor of
Tim Murphy of "Texas Steer" fame, who
officiated with the dignity of a veteran,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAHCH 18, 1896.
ably assisted by the regular associate
judge, Joe Murphy. Mr. Caldwell also
had a few leisure moments, for the well
known farrier, Tom Murphy, "the man
that plated Rey El Santa Anita for the
Derby," took his place on the starter's
stand and at once showed himself
an adept. Babe Murphy, the 7 to
10 choice in the ' betting, captured
the race after a hard brush with
Pat Old Tim hustled himself
along in lively manner to the stretch,
where he was obliged to give way to the
younger generation. Suspended from the
wiie was a handsome green silken bag,
gayly embellished with the Irish and
American flags. After Earl Cochran had
weighed in, he again remounted the back
of the winning Babe, and, lifted up in the
arms of Captain Kees, pretty little Lucille
Murphy, daughter of the associate judge,
presented the fat-faced jockey with the
prize. Earl graciously dotted his hat, the
band played the "Wearing of the Green,"
the crowd cheered, and the Shamrock
handicap was a thing of the past. May
its memory long be kept green.
Hardly less attractive was the pony
event. Eight diminutive bangtails packed
their heavy weights over a distance of a
mile and a half, and saucily took the
jumps. In the betting the Hobart trio.
Conejo, Brandy and Tripe, were selling
favorites at 1 to 2, bacKed down from even
money. Mr. Hobart himself rode Brandy,
while Conejo and Tripe were ridden by
Mr. Wain wright and Lieutenant Smedberg
respectively. The Tobin dvo 1 , Aladdin and
Galloping Dick, with Mr. Simpkins and
Mr. Bagot as pilots, commanded second
call at lives.
Barbara, ridden by Mr. McCreary, was
next in demand with J. Talbot Clifton's
puir, Jumping Jack and Li Hung Chang,
the outsiders at 12 to 1. Mr. Clifton be
strode the back of Jumping Jack and met
with his usual hard luck. When the bar
rier was raised Jumping Jack, who dis
played a fractious disposition going to the
post, at first refused to break, but finally
changed his mind and his lordship en
joyed an excellent view of the race from
the far rear. There was but one spill in
the race and that unexpectedly happened
to Mr. Hobart. As his mount took the
fourth jump the pony appeared to over
jump and his millionaire owner gracefully
slid over his head, escaping without
injury. Mr. Simpkins on Aladdin,- out
riding Mr. Hensliaw astride Li Hung
Chang, got his pony past the wire first by
a couple of lengths, with Barbara a dis
tant third. Mr. Clifton on Jumping Jack
also finished and was accorded a great re
ceDtion from the crowded grand stand.
It was like breaking sticks for King
street to defeat the other youngsters in the
two-year-old event. He was alto 3 favor
ite and won easily from Dolore, with In
narumator a poor third.
The Judge appeared to outclass his field
in the second race, a six-furlong run, yet
tne good price of '1)4 to 1 was laid against
him. He came very near striking a tartar
in the 10 to 1 shot Starling, who was beaten
but three-fourths of a length in a drive.
The seven-furlong run that followed re
sulted in a rather unexpected victory for
Mobolosca with 5 to 1 about her in the
betting, the 2 to 1 choice Mt. McGregor II
finishing second. The favorite, with
Shield bearer as close company, made the
Tunning to the stretch, when Mobalasca
gradually forged to the front, winning
easily by a couple of lengths. Kamsin was
a good third.
An unforeseen accident at the post in
the sixth event, another seven-furlong
run, deprived those who had placed their
coin on the 7 to 10 favorite. Sister Mary, of
all chance to get in line. Shields had the
mount on the mÂ«re and was again afflicted
with an attack of "previousness." Break
ing with hia mount slightly before the
lever releasing the barrier was pressed, the
mare caught the webbing under her chin
and the field started away without her.
Sir Vassar, once as good as 4 to 1 in the
ring, hadthinss his own way, winning as
he liked witn Joe Terryih the place.
The Corrigan entry* Olive, closed a 9 to
5 favorite in the betting on the final six
furlong sprint, but ran unplaced. The
going suited old Toano, who headed Artist
in the stretch, and ridden out beat the
Darebin horse a length. Gallant, who,
with the winner, vied with each other for
second choice honors, was a good third.
Track and Paddock items.
As is customary at Ingleside this will be
"ladies' day" at the new track. It is also
the closing day of the two weeks' meeting,
and the card is one for racegoers to en
thuse over. Special cars will be run over
the electric road for the accommodation of
the fair sex.
Jockey Willie Martin, who has earned
for himself a most enviable reputation
among California racegoers for his great
ability in the saddle, left for Memphis.
Term", last evening to join the stable of
Pat Dunne, for which horseman he will
ride the coming season.
The chestnut gelding Red Root, in the
string of Dick Ledgett, has been very sick
for several days, and it now transpires
that some miscreant poisoned the aged
racer. Stories of horse "doping" are be
coming quite plentiful of late, and if
caught the maiafactor will be severely
dealt with.
The well-known horseman, Pete Weber,
will arrive in a day or two from Los An
geles with a string of seven horses, includ
ing, among others, the two good perform
ers, Suurise and Jerome b.
Chevalier rode Thelma some days back
in a race and was left at the 'post, for
which feat Mr. Caldwell set him down.
The colored lad points to the fact that
other boys were left at the post and went
unpunished and tbinks he is entitled to
the same consideration.
The poolroom joint on the corner of
Fourth and Mission streets still continues
running in open violation of the law. The
Messinger & Co. and "commission" fake
has been exposed; Judge Wallace has de
cided against them, and there is no excuse
for the police in allowing them to keep
open.
It may be said of Shields, who got en
tanglecTin the webbing and was left at the
post with the 7 to 10 favorite, Sister Mary,
in the sixth race, that he was not a sub
ject of censure. Just as long as starters
will permit boys to attempt running 1 starts
with the Australian machine horses are
bound to be left at the post. At the latter
trick Shields has been very successful,
having on several occasions beaten his
field away through anticipating the start
er's movements.
In former days complaints were frequent
from jockeys about stkrters giving them
the worst of it, still with this new innova
tion several of the very smart ones among
them are not willing to accept an equal
break, but like the tin-horn gambler want
a "shade." At the first trial given the
gate, the horses breasted the webbing and
the start was such a perfect one as to send
the crowd into ecstaeies. Since that time
with the suggestions of our own starters
attempted, we have had few like it. If
Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Caldweli would
give the horses time to get to the post and
wait until they are "set," few would be
left at the post.
ARMY BICYCLE SQUAD.
It Does Some Effective Practice Work
Out at the Pregidio.
The bicycle squad of the First United
States Infantry, Angel Island, gave some
practice riding at the Presidio yesterday
afternoon. Composing the squad are First
Sergeant James PhiJlipsen, Corporal James
Lamb, Privates James Connaughton,
George Chirk, Adolph Anderson and seven
others, but as only those named have be
come expert in military maneuvers on the
wheel they alone gave exhibitions of their
riding.
The Presidio reservation roads are well
adapted for such practice as was indulged
in, and advance guard, flying retreat and
messenger movements were well demon
strated by the members of its squad. A
slight mishap occurred, however, by the
men while at full speed running into a
party of picknickers near the Pacinc-street
gate. No one was hurt, but the bevy of
young ladies was badly scattered, if not
frightened. Again when Sergeant Phillip
sen was delivering- a supposed message to
Connaughton, both men passing on the
fly, a collision was the result. Aside from
this the maneuvers were very creditable to
this new military force.
MANY ANXIOUS
TO FIND BANKS
The Missing Police Officer
Prepared for His De
parture.
CHIEF LLOYD DECEIVED
He Is Now Almost Convinced
That the Bribery Case
Was a Job.
BANKS' ARREST THREATENED.
Some People Are in San Quentin on
Testimony Mainly by
Banks.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 17. j
The disappearance of Officer Banks is
causing Chief Lloyd much uneasiness.
Banks' actions for years have been re
garded as suspicious, and when Loui3
Schaff er was Chief of Police he saw many
things he did not like, but was unable
to get them in such shape as to warrant
prosecution.
When Chief Lloyd tooK office Schaffer
brought some very serious charges against
Banks, and after they had been practically
proved the case wns thrown out by the
Polics Officer Banks.
Commissioners on a tecbnicality. Chief
Lloyd was thoroughly deceived by Banks
and supported Him to some degree. While
the cases were pending Banks appeared as
the hero of a Chinese bribery case.
Regarding the bribery case Chief Lloyd
said to-day :
"If it be true, and it looks very much as
though it was, Banks has placed the de
partment in a very peculiar position. I
have investigated the matter just a little
and will investigate it more, but of th^
much I am satisfied: If all things said in
the case are true, as I said before, Banks
has need to keep out of the way.
"When Banks tirst came to me "in the
bribery case he told me a Chinaman had
offered him $10 to stand away from the
door. I told him to pay no attention, but
to go on and do his duty.
"Again Officer Banks came to me about
the lottery men and sain they wanted to
pay me for protection. This time we went
to Prosecuting Attorney Melvin. Banks
told him the story, and acting under his
instruction a nice time was arranged for
between Ah Shing and myself at Banks'
house. The money was paid into Banks'
hands in the presence of witnesses and
Ah Shing was arrested for bribery.
"It looks now as though this Chinaman
was led into the thins and made to believe
that I would accept the money, and if that
be the case, I have no desire to prosecute
him further."
There is some talk among policemen
who knew Banks well that he has taken
his family and gone back to his old home
in Somerville, Mass., but this much is
sureâ he is not in Oakiand and it is doubt
ful if he ever will be again.
There are all kinds of rumors afloat to
account for BanKs' disappearance. The
friends of Schaffer state that he skipped
out because he was afraid to face certain
cases of perjury that have been worked
up against him. A great deal has come
to light within the past few weeks that
has placed Banks in a very unpleasant
light.
It was ascertained to-day that Banks
made very complete preparations for his
departure. He sold all hia furniture,
pawned his bicycle ana his pistol, and re
deemed his diamond. He also forgot to
pay his house rent for the current month.
A very suspicious circumstance in regard
to the" officer's disappearance is that he
sold his full salary claim lor March to E.
Barrett, who buys up city warrants. By
the terms of his resignation he would be
entitled to only sixteen days' pay, so
Barrett is short $50. Barrett has an
nounced his intention of swearing out a
warrant for Banks' arrest.
When Banks handed in his resignation
he was given three days' vacation. Under
these terms he should have returned to
day. As he did not do so he was at once
placed on the delinquent list.
One of the most serious features of Mr.
Banks' trouble is that if his career as an
officer has been as unsatisfactory as hun
dreds of people swear it has been, there are
people now suffering from his actions. As
a result of some of Banks' detective work
some years ago, a young fellow named
Donley was sent to San Quentin and is
there yet. Several police officers said Just
night that the worst thing Dotiley ever did
was to get drunk and raise a disturbance.
There are other cases in which Banks was
concerned, and an investigation into his
conduct is looked for with great interest.
ACCUSED MRS. PRESCOTT
A Girl Openly Charges the President
of a Benevolent Society With
Falsehood.
OAKLAND, Oal., March 17. â Edelia
Everett, tne 15-year-old girl who pleaded
guilty to the charge of vagrancy in the Po
lice Court several days ago and who had
numerous young men call at the City
Prison and offer to marry her, was tried in
the chambers of Judge Green this after
noon on the petition of Mrs. Hobart, her
grandmother, that she was incorrigible.
During the examination quite an un
usual scene was witnessed by the specta
tors. On cross-examination of Lydia A.
Prescott of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children Attorney Ayres for
Edelia Everett endeavored to have Mrs.
Prescott testify that she coerced the
girl into pleading guilty to the charge of
vagrancy in the Police Court. Mrs. Pres-
ANOTHER GRATEFUL FAMILY.
Mr, Miller Considers Paine's Celery
Compound a National Blessing,
</v v^.^N *
There is no spring remedy equal to
Paine's celery compound.
Sufferers from debility who find their
convalescence too slow are joyously sur-
prised by the brisk impetus toward re-
covery that comes from Paine's celery
compound. Its healing, nerve-restoring,
blood-making, nourishing powers go so
directly to the root of the trouble that the
progress toward health and strength is
steady and uninterrupted.
No relapses come when Paine's celery
compound has once fairly begun its health-
ful action.
With a' stronger appetite, sounder sleep
and better digestion (results that every
one has experienced who has taken Paine's
celery compound), the weak and sore kid-
neys and the tired stomach cease to trouble,
and the nerves allow one to worK unvexed
by day and to sleep by night without dis-
turbance. This is what physicians mean
when they say that Paine's celery com-
pound cures nervous diseases permanently.
For disordered liver, and for all blood
diseases physicians use this great formula
cott denied that she even suggested to her
to plead guilty. At this point Miss Everett
became very "much excited and it looKea
as though there waa going to be a hair
pulling match.
"It's false, it's false. W r hen you say you
never recommended to me to plead guilty,
you tell that which is false," said Miss
"Everett.
Mrs. Prescott blushed, and if it had not
been for the interference of the girl's at
torney, Miss Everett would probably have
struck Mrs. Prescott.
When Miss Everett took: the stand she
testified that the testimony of all the other
witnesses was true even though it was ad
verse to her interests, but that the testi
mony of Mrs. Prescott was false from be
ginning to end. It is believed that the
girl was led by excitement to do an injus
tice to Mrs. Preseott.
After all the testimony was in, Judge
Greene decided to commit her to the Re
form School, as her mother and father were
dead and there was no one to care for her.
When the girl was informed that she was
to be sent to the reform school, her attor
ney endeavored to impress upon her the
advantage of reforming, but she persist
ently refused, saying that Mrs. Prescott
had railroaded her into the reform school.

has investigated the possibilities of trans- !
planting oaks and says that oak trees
thirty feet in height can be transplanted

Lowe Fined 890.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 17. -George
Lmve, who was found guilty last Saturday
of selling liquor within the mile limit of
the university contrary to the State law,
was to-day fined $90 by Judge James, with
the alternation of spending ninety days in
jail. Lowe immediately gave notice at
of Prof. Edward E. Phelps, M.D., LL.D.,
of Dartmouth College â Paine's celery
compound. It has lifted thousands from
beds of sickness. It does what nothing
else ever did for the sleepless, the dyspep-
tic and the despondent â it cures them
once and for ail.
Here is a testimonial from Mr. E. A.
Miller of Columbus, Ohio, accompanying
the photograph of his family.
"For two years past I have been a con-
stant sufferer with severe nervous head-
aches, ofttimes being compelled to go to
bed when my business necessitated my
personal attention. Last week my physi-
cian recommended Paine s celery com-
pound. I have taken now four bottles,
and have not suffered with headache
since. This Government, in my mind,
should pay the discoverer of " Paine's
celery compound a sum of money sufficient
to keep him and all his relatives in luxury
during their natural life."
Mr. Miller is the son of Dr. J. D. Miller.
His wife is the cranddaughter of the late
Governor Lucas of Ohio. Mr. Miller's
praise of Paine's celery compound is
equaled by that of thousands of others who
owe their health and strength to this
greatest of all remedies.

.Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top figurs*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, eqnal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low"
refers to low pressure, and ts usually preceded and
Rcrompanled by cloudy weather and rains. â¢â¢Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
When the pressure Is high in the interior and low
siong the coast, and the Isobars extend north and
south alonz the coast, rain is probable; but when
the --low'" is Inclosed with Isobars of marked curva
ture rain south of Oregon is improbable. With r
"high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these condition* will product
â¢ii opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. K. V., March 17.â Speculation
at the Stock Exchange to-day was quiet, the . deal
ings aggregating only 151,100 shares. While the
course of the market was irregular until near the
close, the undertone was decidedly . firm. London,
which has been rather indifferent of late, tamed
up as a buyer of St. Paul, Louisville and Nashville
and Northern Pacihc preferred. The buying for
foreign' account was attributed to . the prevailing
mpression that the Venezuelan boundary ques
tion will be settled amicably. Covering of short
contracts had considerable to do with the improve
ment in Northern Pacific preferred and Baltimore
and Ohio. ThÂ»* rise in the latter at one time was
equal to 1C/ B per cent.
The greatest improvement, however, was in the
industrial group. Su::ar rose I^fa to 1173/Â»; Gen
eral Electric. 13/g to 37Va; Cotton Oil preferred,
I*4 to 64. . Bogara strength was due to statements
that the company had acquired Immense quanti
ti> sof the i-aw .liwi-rinl and waa in a position to
dictate terms so far as the product is concerned.
General Electric was bought by brokers who
figured prominently in the recent rise to 39^.
Tobacco and Leather preferred were erratic
throughout, but finally closed %@1 per cent lower
on the day. The market closed hrm in tone. Net
changes show advances of 1 /tÂ»@< !3 cent.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ilt-, March 17.-Wheat was much
steadier this morning than at any time yet. It
looked as though the bears were satisfied, for the
present at least with the progress they had made,
while the bulls w^re feeling their way cautiously
for a rally. The conditions showed no particular
change and nothing very favorable to prices could
be urged. Some attention is attracted to the re
ports from Argentine. Advices to the oiTect that
shipments from that country will soon cease have j
been received, and if they prove accurate it is ex
pected to improve the foreign demand iv this coun
try.
Liverpool caoles this morning were quiet and
steady. Receipts in the Northwest were large at j
567 cars against 467 last Tuesday and 376 a year
aeo. Chicago received 51 cars and inspected out
121,230 bushels. Export clearances were light at
185,260 bushels. Bradstreet's reported a decrease
in the world's available supply of 677,000 bushels.
Closing Continental cables were all lower. The
market increased in strength late in the session,
reootts of a good export demand at the seabeard
being received. May wheat opened from 523/ g c to
S'-'VaC sold between 62c and t>3i c. closing at 63<a
63y 8 c 3,i@7/ 8 c higher than yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 32 cars.
CORNâ The tone of the Corn market was not
very strong at the opening, the receipt of 755 cars
where but 700 were estimated tending to exert a
weakening influence. The steadier feeling of
Wheat, however, contributed a somewhat better
tone later and checked the declining inclination.
Withdrawals from store were - 37.652 bushels.
Liverpool cables were steady. Bradstreet's re
ported an increase in available stocks of 450,000
bushels. Export clearances amounted to 172,549
bushels. May corn opened at- 29y 2 c, sold between
29 5 /ic and 293/ c. closing at the outside, y @Vic
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 625 cars.
OATSâ There was steadiness in oats. Lighter
arrivals than estimated, 384 cars, and the firmness
of wheai both combined in communicating the
strength. Withdrawals from store were 1100
bushels. Bradstreet's gave an increase In stocks of
175,000 bushels. May oats closed lie higher than
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 216
cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 90c; May, 90y 2 @
903/ic. Receipts, 31 cars.
BARLEYâ Choice to fancy barley . was scarce
and firm, but the poorer kinds were in liberal sup
ply and easy. Receipts were 109 cars. Poor to
fair sold from 24yÂ»c to 29c, good to choice from
30c to 34c and fancy was nominally 35@36c
â  PROVISIONSâ hog market was higher this
morning and on that knowledge product presented
a fair measure of strength at the opening, but with
the Improvement in prices the selling disposition
grew in importance and very soon declines were
noted. May pork closed 7yÂ»c lower; May lard
and May ribs each 2Vjc lower.

A DEMAND FOR
OPEN PRIMARIES
A Mass-Meeting Called at
the Tabernacle Thurs
day Night.
THE BREACH WIDENS.
Many Positive Opinions Ex
pressed by Republicans
on Both Sides.
VETERANS ARE IN REVOLT.
The Army and Navy League Re
solves That Only Primaries
Will Satisfy Them.
Oakland Office Sas Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 17. j
RESOLVED, That it is the sense ol
this committee that the delegates to tin
State Convention fur the purpose of se
lecting delegates to the National Con
vention be appointed, and that the ap
pointments be made by and the responsi
bility rest upon the committeeman from
each Assembly district, and such ap
pointment must be ratified by this com
mittee.
Tne above resolution is the rock upor
which the Republican party of Alamed*
County has split.
The action of the Alameda County dele
gation of the Third Congressional Dis
trict Republican Committee Saturday has
aroused considerable feeling. Nothing
else is talked on the streets by those
men who usually fail to take active part ir
these matters.
President P. M. Fisher of the Second
Ward Republican Club has issued a cal]
for a mass-meeting of citizens on Thurs
day evening. Senator Guy C. Earl, mem
ber of the Congressional Committee, will
give an account of its proceedings. Others
who. will speak are Colonel Babcock, presi
dent of the Regular Republican Club oi
Alameda; ex-Mayor William R. Davis,
Dr. P. S. Bodle and Rev. R. F. Coyle.
The Army and Navy Republican League
will also meet Thursday night and will
march to the Tabernacle in a body. The
members are requested by their officers
to meet earlier than usual, so as not to be
late at the Tabernacle. Tue clubs of the
First, Second and Seventh wards, all that
are yet organized, will also attend in a
body. A big delegation is also expected
from Alameda and Berkeley.
The Army and Navy * League have
.adopted the following resolutions which
were to have been presented to the com
mittee before they decided the manner of
selecting delegates, but as no public an
nouncement was made of the meeting they
failed to get them to the committee. They
read :
"Eesolved, That it is the sense of the
Army and Navy Republican League of
Oakland that primary elections should be
called for the election of delegates to our
State and Congressional conventions as
the only true Republican method of giving
expression to the will or the people com
posing the rank and rile of the Republican
party of the S:ate. Therefore, this camp
demands an expression of the party in the
choice of delegates by primary elections
lor all delegates to all conventions held by
the Republican party, whether State or
Congressional."
A number of prominent citizens seen to
day express themselves regarding the com
mittee's action as follows:
Ex-Judge S. G. Nye â Thi3 manner of
selecting delegates is contrary to tbe tradi
tions of the party and the traditions of a
representative form of government. If it
is carried into effect by the committee it
will result in a loss of 1200 Republican
votes in this country. But that is not the
worst of it. This plan of securing dele
gates violates every principle of representa
tive government. If the argument is that
we cannot trust the people in the choice of
their delegates representative government
is at an end and we had better have an
absolute monarcny at once.
Dr. R. F. Coyleâ l have been so aroused
over this action of the committee that I
Lardly know how to express myself. This
is a matter in which every citizen, regard
less of his politics, is vÂ»taliy interested.
Tne stability of our form of government
depends U|"on the people choosing their
own representatives.
Attorney J. B. Richardsonâ l agree
moat heartily with tbe views expressed by
the Enquirer, that the committee in this
matter are not allowing tne people to send
a representative delegation to Sacramento.
It is establishing a precedent which is not
safe.
Major E. A. Shermanâ l will say, in the
words of General Grant, "The will of the
people is the law of the lanu."
Councilman W. O. Bucklandâ lt seems
to me tbis sort of business is the exercise
of gag law. It is tbe act of half a dozen
men, and will not be tbe act of the people.
I am not saying Unit tnis committee is not
iike Caesar's wife, but I don't think they
have any right to take upon themselves
uulies which belong to the entire people.
Supei visor W. H. Church â If we had
a primary law I would say t hat it would be
advisable to hold them, but at present it
would be impossible to tret a real ex
pression of tbe Republican sentiment at a
primary, as practically any one could
vote. I think under the circumstances we
will get as fair an expression by the com
mittee as through a primary.
Justice F. C. Cliftâ As a general propo
i lam in favor of primaries. In this
particular instance I sliail be perfectly
satisfied as far as the Third Ward is con
cerned to have Senator Earl make the
appointment. I*,1 *, as the result will be the
same in either case.
John A. Sandsâ l think that the action
of tiie committee is an unwarranted as
sumption </f powr, and should not be
â  1 to pass without protest.
Jam^.- E. <_'rane~You may say I am for
anything tnat wiil beat George C. i'ardee;
1 don't care what it is. â 
I A. Campbellâ l believe in party
1 don't believe In consulting
Partisan! and Populists about Repub
lican primaries. The people who are do
king arc the ones who have
â¢ I;< publican banner in the
anu'dii from the poei
: the banner Republican county to a
doubtful county.
â¢*! ia ' 1 believe if we arc to re
mam ;i i<-; Ã¼biic we- should have a Repub
lican form <j! (.ovcTiiment at all times.
Judge J. i-.lisworthâ l have an opinion
on the subject, but under the circuin-
Btaneea I do not m.^ire to become involved
in any way.
J. ki. \\ . Rileyâ I am for primaries every
time. I lay this one-man power is retro
graoipg toward a monarchy.
\V. A. Dowâ The opinions I have heard
Â«>x pressed were very K enerally in favor of
holding a primary.
Manuel Stoneâ I bid in favor of pri- 1
manes. I think that it is the fairer way]
of getting an expression of the will of the
people.
Joe Dieves Jr.â l think that it would be
better to hold a primary. It's more satis
factory.
Leslie Blackburn â Of course I was
friendly to Eli Denison. He hart done me
some favors and I said before I knew that
any one else would be in the fight that I
would do what I could to help him. I
think that primaries would be the better
plan. Even if the result was the same the
people would accept it and say we bad a
chance to express ourselves. This appoint
ment is a bad precedent. If it can be done
once it might be again. A committee
might take it upon itself to nominate a
whole county convention and put up the
whole ticket.*
Supervisor W. S. Pelouzeâ There is not
one man in the First Ward that I have
spoken with who is not in favor of pri
maries. The whole affair turns on the
question of these fellows getting them
selves returned on the Congressional Com
mittee. They are weil aware thut if the
people could express themselves a set of
delegates would be named who would see
that representative men were placed on
the committee. They want Denison be
cause he is in a position to reward them
by supporting them for positions. If there
was a primary I might vote for Denison,
but that does* not alter the fact that the
committee has no right to force him on
me.
John Mitchell, member of the City Re
publican Central Committee from the Sec
ond Wardâ l am strongly opposed to the
assumption of so much power by any set
of men. They may be doing everything
in good ia;tb,"but the people have some
rights in this matter. No candidate can
be forced on the people, for if there is
there will be a rebellion that will have no
uncertain sound at the polls.
F. K. Shattuckâ lt seems to me that the
action of the committee was inadvised. I
believe that it is better to consult the
wishes of the party through primaries.
James A. Johnson â The action of the
committee is arbitrary, dictatorial and
unwarranted. I think the people should
be consulted. It looks as though five
members of the committee had concluded,
"We are the people." The action of the
committee is apparently put up in the in
terest of some person.
Ex-Mayor William R. Davisâ The funda
mental principles of our Government is
that the people shall have a voice in being
governed. Ido not think it is a matter of
who shall represent us in the convention,
but whether the voters of the party shall
have the privilege of expressing themselves
in the matter.
W. S. Harlow â I am opposed to the com
mitteemen selecting the delegation in this
case. It is a matter of the rights of the
people and not one as to who shall go to
the National convention. The citizens
have some rights which must be respecte.l.
It is hoped by many Republicans that
the Congressional Third District Commit
tee, which meets in San Francisco next
Saturday, will refuse to ratify the action of
the Alameda delegation and will order
primaries.
HONORED ERIN'S FLAG
Rev. M. J. Whyte of Sonoma
Makes an Address on
Patriotism.
Teach a Man Love of Country and It
Will Not Matter Where He
Worships.
Oakland Office Sax Fraxcisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 17. \
St. Patrick's day was observed by a suit
able celebration and entertainment at
Germania Hall to-night. The stars and
stripes with the National bunting and the
flag of Erin constituted the decorations.
Father McNally of St. Patrick's Chu/ch
made the address of welcome. There
were songs, Irish ballads and recitations
by W. C. Wilson, Miss Jettie Noone, Misses
Marthy, Miss Kate O'Neill, Miss Mc-
Namara. Miss Sabina Flanagan, Alex
Rosborough and Ed Flanagan.
Rev. M. J. Whyte of Sonoma gave the
oration, his subject being "Patriotism,
False and True." In his remarks he said:
The three civilizing influences in this coun
try are tbe school, the church and the news
papers. Any considerable and permanent im
provement in our political condition can only
be the result of a determined, systematic and
harmonious co-operation of these three forces.
Unfortunately the churches and the news
papers are not remarkable for mutual esteem.
The newspapers point to tne front pews in
all the churches where kneel and pray the j
richest scoundrels, the most successful |
thieves and the most distinguished rascals of |
each community. Teach each younger gen
eration reverence for age, for authority and
for other forms of ability besides the talent for
money-grabbi:iK. Teach him that manly inde
pendence of character is not necessarily asso
ciated with the manners of a savage, and that
a free man may actually be a gentleman.
Teach him to be, not a Californian, nor a New
Yorker, nor yet an American, but only a man.
Then you teach him true patriotism," no mat
ter what land gives him birth, no matter what
race he may spring from, no matter what
church, he prays in.
Want Better Wages.
OAKLAND, Cal.. March 17.â The Oak
land painters and decorators are consider
ing the advisability of attempting to se
cure a raise of pay from $2 50 to $3 a day
for eight hours' work. However it is
likely they will await the result of the
crafts strike in San Francisco before doing
anything here. The local union wants rec
ognition by the master painters a* well as
the workins-cari system so popular across
the bay. It iÂ§ rumored that a new plan of
arganization among the journeymen paint
ers will take place shortly, but just what
the pian is none of its supporters will say.
Gier's Slander Suit.
OAKLAND, Cal:, March 17.â Theodore
Gier, the wholesale liquor dealer, is to be
the defendant in a $7500 slander suit to be
tiled in the Superior Court by August
Krueger. This is the result of an attack
by Ger on Krueger in a meeting of the di
rectors of the Merchants' Exchanee.
wnerein the latter was charged with try- |
ing to square cases on which he h;id
worked up evidence in behalf of the Li
cense Inspector. Later these Charges and
interviews with Gier were published i:i a
local paper.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 1896.
RIGHT OF WAY
IS NOW CLEAR
Vandercook Will at Once
Proceed to Build to
Corral Hollow.
TO SKIRT THE FOOTHILLS
Must Supply Electric Lights for
the Whole Length of
The Line.
THE BUSINESS IS ASSURED.
Within a Year It Is Expected That
Coal Will Be Landed at Oak
land's Wharves.
Oakland Office Sa?j Fbancisco Call,(
903 Broadway, March 17. I
The decision of the Supreme Court bus-
I taining the Supervisors in awarding the
! franchise from this city to Livermore to
E. P. Vandercook has removed the last
obstacle in the way of the construction of
the road.
A few months ago Mr. Vandercook went
East and received many pledges of support
for his road when the cloud on the fran
chise was settled. Now that the franchise
has been affirmed the construction of the
road will be pushed with all possible
haste.
The new road will start at the terminus
of the present system managed by E. P.
; Vandercook at Frui tvale. From there it
j will go along the foothills toward Hay
wards, only keeping well to the north of
the county road, which is traversed by the
Haywards electric line. A branch will
run from the main line to Haywards. The
line will run to Livermore and thence to
the Corral Hollow mines and will be oper
ated by electricity and will be adapted so
as to carry both freight and passengers.
It will open up much new territory and
such a line has been in demand for several
years.
The rights of way over such parts of the
route as are not county-roads have been
willingly donated by the owners, with one j
or two exceptions near San Leandro. The
opposition in this neighborhood is attril>
uted to the agency of the Haywards road,
which is of course^ not anxious to see any |
portion of its route paralleled. For sev
eral months surveyors have been in the
field and the route is all selected. In some
places there are two or three routes pro- |
posed, but a choice will soon be made now j
that the matter of the franchise is settled.
For some time the directors of the com
pany have been trying to close a contract
with the Corral Hollow people by which !
the new line shall have the exclusive ritrht
to haul coal to tide-water in Oakland for a j
stated period of years. It is the trade j
from the vast developments of Corral Hoi- ]
| low that th"s new line is chiefly depending
upon, as the freight will be enormous
I when the coal mines open up for business.
| It has been calculated that coal can be de
livered at one-half the prevailing prices.
The contract, however, has not yet been
made.
Air. Vandercook states that as soon as
the preliminaries are completed work will
be commenced. It would have been difti
sult to have worked throughout the past
winter, and the directors are elated that
the Supreme Court has reached such an
early decision, as it will enable work to be
prosecuted under the most favorable con
ditions of weather. Tracklaying will com
mence in a few weeks at several points
along the proposed route, and it is ex
pected that within a year the road will be
in operation.
The terms upon which the franchise was
granted was considered by the Supervisors
to be very favorable.
The company has to provide electric
power for lighting and heating the County
Infirmary on the sloue back of San Lean- |
dro where the new road will run. It will i
also maintain electric-lights along the road j
at stated intervals, and must pay one-quar- I
ter of 1 per cent of the gross earnings of j
the road into the county treasury and a i
cash amount of 125.
The bid of A. D. Thompson which was
taken before the Suureme Court was 2 per
cent of the gros? earnings of the line. The
court ruled that Thompson's offer was not
a cash one, as contemplated by the act.
PATTI9ON-TAI LOR.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 17.â The <jn- ;

HILL TELLS HIS TALE.
The Wife-Murderer Pleads That He
Was Temporarily Insane.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 17.â Benjamin
L. Hill, who shot and killed his wife a
couple of months ago at Twelfth and Kirk
ham streets, in this city, faced a jury to
day in Judge Ogden's court and detailed
the story of his life.
District Attorney Charles E. Snook and
Prosecuting Attorney H. A. Melvin of the
Police Court represented the people, while
Tom M. Bradley appeared for the de
fendant. Hill manifested considerable
nervousness. He seemed very anxious to
say as little as possible, and rarely did
more than answer in a concise manner the
questions propounded.
Hill had only just begun his testimony
when an elderly lady, bearing in her arms
a boy about two years of age, entered the
room. They were not noticed by the de
fendant, but as soon as the baby saw the
defendant he gave evidence of recognition
by smiling and making an attempt to go
toward the witness. It was the accused's
son. The resemblance was remarkable.
Several times the little fellow extended a
small bouquet which he carried toward
his father, but the tribute of affection was
unnoticed.
Hill said his father was a man of violent
E. P. VANDERCOOK.
j passion and caused a great deal of trouble
!at home. "I was in the hotel at Minneap-
I olis," said he, "at the time mv father
: killed himself. He went into a closet off
| the office and shot himself. I went with
i the crowd and saw my ; father .lying dead
, with blood coming from a pistol wound in
I the head. He had been acting in an un
{ certain manner for some time before the
: tragedy. The Corf ner's jury returned a
I verdict of suicide while laboring under mi
i sanity." !
The witness then told of his troubles with
j his wife, of her being deficient in truthful- \
| ness, of her fondness for : dancing parties
' aeainst his wishes, of her keeping company
I witn other men, of her going out riding bi
j cycles . in bloomer costume regardless of
| his remonstrance and, finally, or her ad
i mission of infidelity and rur desire to have
: no more to do with him and declaring she
| would not live with him.
He then repeated the story told at the
â¢ time of the. shooting, how he had in a fit
j of insane jealousy shot her as she was tell
ing him this last.

IGNORANT OF
HER DESERTION.
Pretty Little Fay Stetson
Is Taken to the Hu
mane Society.
A CHILD QF WEALTH.
Her Unnatural Parents Said to
Have Disappeared From
Oakland.
LEFT AT THE CHABOT HOUSE.
If Not Claimed at Once Mrs. Prescott
Will Take Out Letters of
Guardianship.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 17. )
When Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott, secretary
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, arrived at her office this
morning a pretty little blonde girl 18
months old, with all her wardroDe
wrapped up in a newspaper was awaiting
her.
Matron Glud of tne Chabot Home for
Children, on Oak and Seventh, had
brought the child to turn her over to the
Humane Society as being deserted by her
parents.
Two weeks ago, Mrs. Glud said, the little
one had been brought to her private board
ing-house by a stylishly dressed young
man who said he was the father of the
child ; that the mother was staying at the
Oak-street Sanitarium and that he wished
to encage board for the child.
The arrangement was made to care for
it for the sum of $7 monthly. The man
gave his name as Stetson and said his
business was that of a painter.
He made a deposit of $2, promising to
call in two days later with the other $5.
He has failed to show up, or communicate
with Mrs. Glud, and she fears, as two
weeks' time has elapsed, that she has been
duped.
Further, she has inquired at the Sanita
rium and discovered that the lady calling
herself Mrs. Stetson has also disappeared.
The circumstances are considered suspi
cious, and unless the parents of little Fay
Stetson make their appearance she will be
placed in some charitable institution as an
abandoned babe.
She is a remarkably pretty child, and
several persons who have seen her have
been won by her cute ways and are
anxious to adopt her if she becomes the
ward of Mrs. Prescott.
Mrs. Prescott is making a vigorous
search for the parents, and if found will
compel them to care for and support their
child.
The clothes worn by the child are of
fine texture, and this is taken to indicate
that her parents are people in good circum
stances.

Gentlemen : Ono box of No-To-Bac cured me Â»t

desire to be emancipated. :": - ' \ i

DEFENDING THE CHARTER
A View of the Duties and Powers
of the Board of Public
Works.
BUYING COMMON UTILITIES'.
Ernest McCullough Explains the- Value
of the Charter Clauses Relating*
to Municipal Ownership.
The following communication is self
explanatory:
To the Editor of the Callâ Sir: Unfortunately
another attack ou the proposed charier has
ui>i>eared in print in the public press. It is an
attack on an article from the writer which
appeared in tne Examiner last Sunday.
in that article the statement was made that
it was not necessary for the Board of Public
Works to Ret unanimously in recommending
estimates to the Board of Supervisors for the
cost of building or purchasing water works or
other public utilities. The writer still holds
to that opinion for the reason statedâ that U,
the Board of Public Works Is only an advisory
body when the purchase of such utilities comes
r.p tor consideration. It is a body ot trained
men who shall assist the Board of Supervisors
in technical matters: their duties are advi
.-ory, the Supervisors' duties are legislative.
To imist that the public utilities cannot be
purchased or that the Supervisors are not em
powered to submit the question to a vote of the
people without the concurrent unanimous
opinion of the Board of Public-Works that the ]
i">umaies are correct and reasonable and the
proposed action is right, makes the Board ot
i'ublic Works a portion of the Board ot Super
\ isors with e^ual powers of seemingly a legis
lative character.
The individual who takes the ground that
the Board of I'ublic Works is thus a part of the
Board of Supervisors quotes section 3 of chapter
1 of article VI, in proof of his misstatemems.
A portion ot said section says "No order or res
olution shall be passed or business transacted
involving the approval of bonds, awarding of
contracts, appointment; of employes, or reso
lutions of intention recommending work or im
provement, except by the concurrent vote of
the Commissioners."
Tnis section just quoted cannot by any
reasonable man oe understood as making it
mandatory upon the Commissioners to ap
prove the issuance ot bonds to purchase water
works or street railways. It merely refers to
section 2 of chapter lof article VI preceding,
where it is stated that the Commissioners may
require employes to furnish bonds and that
said bonds mutt be approved by the Comniis
slonero.
The following section where it requires the
concurrent vote of all the Commissioners to
approve bonds might lead the ordinary man
s ing common sense to believe that the
section referred to the bonds of employes
spoken of in the preceding section. Some
very ordinary men, however, do not seem to
possess common tense. Let us examine care
fully section 8 of chapter 1 of article VI,
wherein the duties of the Commissioners of
the Board of Public Works are set forth in the
matter of municipal ownership.
The section in full reads as follows: "It shall
De and is hereby made the especial duty of the
B;>ard of Public Works to prepare, at least
three months previous to every City election,
an e-timate of the value of the various street
railroads of San Francisco; the value of the
gas, electric or other plants or methods for
lighting said City in all portions, both public
and private, thereof; the water works of said
City; tne telephones of said City, and all other
franchises granted and in use in such City and
County. The estimate thus made shall be the
basis upon which may be submitted to the
electors of said City and County the question
whether or not said electors desire to purchase
such properties, or any of them."
There is nothing in mat section which states
that the Board ot Public Works shall recom
mend the purchase or that they must act as a
unit in submitting the estimates of cost. It is
their duty to submit the estimates and, as the
writer before stated, the task of making the
estimate is an immense one. In practice it
will undoubtedly be arranged between the
Commissioners that one of them shall have
that especial duty to perform. If his esti
mates do not suit the other Commissioners
they have the privilege of submitting a ma
jority or minority report. It is optional with
the Supervisors to submit the question to the
people of voting upon the purchase or con
struction of works. But if the Supervisors do
submit the question to the people they must
do so upon the estimates submitted by tne
Board of Public Works and upon no others.
It is not anywnere stated in the charter that
the Board of Public Works must unanimously
vote upon the desirability of possesing the
works before submitting the question to the
Supervisors or the people.
And furthermore, In reference to estimates of
cost it is well to remember that section U-i of
chapter 2 of article II says the estimates of
value of existing plants must not exceed the
cost of duplicatine: such plants by construc
tion. The Board of Public Works must submit
to the Board of Supervisors the reasonable cost
of constructing such works and the Supervisors
6ubmit to the people the alternative of con
structing them or of purchasing the present
ones. If the people decide to purchase the pres
ent works the Supervisors have the power to
condemn and purchase them at the valua
tion set by the Commissioners.
If the "associated villainies" cannot take
better care of themselves than to draw up a
clause like that to insert in the charter they
need to be taken care of. It puts them where
all franchise-owning corporations should be
at the mercy of the people and in their full
power. At present the corporations seem to
own San Francisco, according to our friends
who object to the charter, but when the char
ter is adopted the corporations will be careful
not to ottend the people as now frequently
happens, for it will be possible for the people
to revoke the privileges granted by the fran
chise and vote to run things themselves. If
the charter were of no use in anything else,
the clauses relating to municipal ownership
alone should make every citizen vote for it.
Yours respectfully, Ernest McCullough.

MRS. HARMON
IS WEDDED AGAIN.
The Man at Whom Harmon
Shot Is Now Her
Husband.
WILL GUARD HER CHILD
Natural Denouement of Sensa
sational Divorce Pro
ceedings.
UTMOST SECRECY OBSERVED.
Ceremony Performed Last Saturday.
The Couple Now Living at the
Golden West Hotel.
There was a wedding at the Golden West
Hotei on Saturday evening that was also a
denouement.
The parties were Albert A. Wheeler and
Frances E. Harmon. Frances E. Harmon
is tne divorced wife of Louis C. Harmon,
whose escapades have furnished illustrated
stories to the newspapers within the
period of easy recollection. Mrs. Harmon
secured a divorce from her husband in the
courts of Oakland, which courts decreed
that he should pay certain aliniony to the
wife.
About three months ago Dr. Harmon
having converted his estate into cash,
figuring up about $30,000, undertook to
leave clandestinely for Victoria, boarded
the tug Lillie for the purpose, and started
out from Oakland to board the northbound
boat in the Golden Gate. He had been
under surveillance, however, and a
trnmped-up charge was brought against
him of using the mail for unlawful pur
poses, and on this charge he was over
hauled and arrested on the ship and taken
back to Oakland. Tnis charge, of which
there was no evidence, was dismissed of
course, but Harmon was held â prevented
from getting away with his property from
the jurisdiction of the court.
In the meantime Mrs. Harmon, living
at 1457 Grove street, was receiving the at
tentions of Albert A. Wheeler.
Wheeler is a young man of 28, emDloved
in the service of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company as purser on vessels plying
between this City and the Central Ameri
can ports. He has resided at the Golden
West Hotel for some time. He has been
paying attention to the lady who is now
his *\ ife lor a long time, and tbeie is a story
of his visiting her one evening at her home
on Grove street before the divorce was
granted; that Harmon was watching for
him with some friends, who assisted him
in surrounding the house; that when
Wheeler was leaving he encountered Har
mon, who fired two shots at him. The
shots went wild.
Since the divorce, which was granted in
February last, Wheeler has been a constant
wooer of the young divorcee, and on
Saturday last he applied for and secured a
license towed. Mra. Harmon accompanied
him and on the affidavit, which is a neces
sary preliminary to securing the coveted
document, she made a written statement
concerning her having secured the
divorce.
The couple then went in search of a
Justice of the Peace to perform the cere
mony, but f: Mp d or were diverted and
retired to tue <.oiden West Hotel on Ellis
street, the former's place of residence,
where the ceremony was performed that
evening by Justice of the Peace Groezin
ger.
Albert H. Wheeler, the new husband of
the Mrs. Harmon that was, has had his
experience though he is a young man. He
fell heir to quite a large sum of money
Thile a still younger man and spent it.
The spending of it threw him down in the
social scale and at the end of his string,
financially, and suffering from despond
ency resulting from that fact and from
dissipation he enlisted in-the regular army
and served for some years in Troop I at
the Presidio.
He recovered his poise after a time and,
it is said, bought his release from his en
listment, or his friends bought it for him.
He secured the situation in the service of
the Pacific Mail which he still holds.
He was also for a long time a member of
Light Battery A, now Troop A, National
Gu.-ird.
Mrs. Harmon is the mother of a child,
the care of which was awarded to her by
the decree of divorce. It is said that the
father is anxious to recover possession of
the child, and has engaged the Cnrtin De
tective Agency to watch the mother and
aid him in his desire.
Wheeler has declared to his friends that
his marriage with Mrs. Harmon gives him
the right to protect her in the possession
of the child, and that he will do it at what
ever cost. "If anybody comes fooling
around my place trying to steal this
child," he says, "he will get shot."
Every precaution was taken to prevent
the fact of the wedding becoming known
publicly, the marriage license being se
cured at the last moment previous to the
closing of the Clerk's office on Saturday.
Tne license, with certificate of the wed
ding, has not yet been filed with the Re
corder, and every person connected with
the affair has been pledged to secrecy, but
in spite of all this, it has leaked through
the friends of the couple about the hotel.
SMITfi'S SUIT ANSWERED.
Some Complications in the Donahue
Road Election Explained.
The San Francisco and North Pacific
Railroad has answered the suit of Sidney
Smith to set aside a recent election on the
ground of injustice and illegality.
Smith alleged that the defendants in his
suit, the directors of the road, made out
a ballot with his 42,000 shares distiibuted
among candidates he did not want, and
thereby the election was changed.
In the answer it is alleged that the 42,000

shares were held in trust ,by the Mercan
tile Trust Company of New York, and that
Smith, Foster and Markbam; organized a
syndicate ; to purchase them for $800,000.
It was decided by the syndicate that the
shares should be voted as a unit, and when
the election came round Foster ana Mark
ham determined to vote .the ; shares - for
themselves and for Ljlienthal. Smith
being in the minority nad no voice in the
direction of the shares. It was on account
of this "combination that Foster, as presi
dent of the meeting, threw out Smith's
vote.

KNOW A GOOD THING.
Readers Hasten to Secure the New Kn
cyclopaedic Dictionary.
It was thought at the outset that intelli
gent readers of this paper would be quick
to take advantage of the remarkable offer
of the Pacific Coast Newspaper Syndicate,
and obtain the new Encyclopaedic Diction
ary on the special terms made for the 500
introductory sets, which are distributed
merely to make known the merits of the
work.
But when this price is reduced by over
two-thirds the superb publication becomes
almost a gift, as readers have readily per
ceived, to judge from the orders which are
coming in by each mail.
The terms made by the syndicate for 500
sets to introduce the work simply require
a cash payment of $1 to apply on the pur
chase of the four volumes, which make up
the complete set, and the same is delivered
at once, the balance being payable at the
rate of $1 25 per month for one year, or at
the rate of about 4 cents per day.
Further than this, to evidence the per
fect fairness of the offer, the work may be
returned within ten days and money will
be refunded, which is a contingency not
at all likely to happen, however, when the
splendid publication is once in possession
and its high value becomes apparent.
Full descriptive matter and sample
pages will Be sent on application, but to
those who do not wish to waste time in
correspondence and run the risk of losing
a set at the low introductory price it may
be said that the Encyclopaedic Dictionary
is not only the most recent and complete
| dictionary* of the English language extant,
but it also treats over 50,000 subjects in
i the same manner as an encyclopedia. It
is in four magnificent quarto volumes,
containing over 5000 pages, with 3000 illus
trations explaining the definitions. It
contains 250,000 words, beine 134,000 more
than Worcester and 110,000 more than
Webster. It is a veritable mine of useful
information, and is alike invaluable for
home, office, library or study, since it
easily takes the place of almost any half
dozen other reference, works which could
be named.
It has at once become the standard
wherever introduced, and even at its sub
scription price of $42 per set is sure to find
a valued place in thousands of cultured
homes.
But at the introductory price of $1 cash
and $1 "25 per month for a year it is simply
a marvel of cheapness.
All communications are to be addressed

DESERTED HIS FAMILY
Mrs. Joseph Graham Left Desti
tute With Five Young
Children.
The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children Has Charge
of Her Case.
Joseph Graham, a cook, deserted his
wife and five children on December 13 last,
leaving them almost penniless, and since
then he has not been seen or heard of.
Mrs. Graham had $47 in bank, which
she had been able to save, an I on the day
of his disappearance he induced her to
draw the money out of the bank. He
wanted ?40 on the pretext that he was to
buy an interest in a restaurant and she
gave him $20.
They were then living on Lexington
avenue and the $27 soon dwindled away
Joe Graham.
for the rent and the necessaries of life.
She had to give up the bouse ana engaged
a small room in the house 619^ Mission
street. She tried to get employment out
failed, and to prevent starvation she apÂ»
plyed for help to the Associated Charities.
She got a little assistance, but was too
sensitive to apply tor more.
The oldest child, a boy, is 11 years of
age, and the youngest 2. To add to her
misery the youngest child was seized with
the whooping cough, and on Monday night
she called at the .Receiving Hospital, but
as there is no juvenile ward there for the
care of afflicted children they could not
help her.
Dr. Rinne, who heard her story, went
home with her and prescribed for the
child. His sympathies were so aroused by
the sight of the starving children that he
gave Mrs. Graham all the money he had in
his Dockets.
Yesterday the case was called to the
attention of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, and Officers Hol
brook and McMurray arranged to have the
three eldest children sent to tlie Youths'
Directory to-day, and will make every
effort to get employment for the mother,
who is a quiet, respectable little woman.
Some gentlemen who heard of the case
later will endeavor to get a uosition for
the oLiest boy to-day, so that his earnings
can be a help to his mother; but if un
successful the boy will have to go to the
directory.
The police will be asked to help find
Graham, so that he can be punished for his
cruel desertion.

moral character and ministerial stand
ing of the Rev. C. O. Brown, D. D.
The council In pursuing this investiga
tion labored under great difficulty
from the first in the fact that
the matters to be investigated
were so largely in the shape of
widely spread rumors and that
the charges had not been prearranged
with sufficient deflniteness, nor was the
testimony uniformly ready at call. Nev
ertheless we have earnestly attended to
the duty assigned us and patiently list
ened to all the evidence produced be
fore us or procurable by us, having met
in thirty-six sessions, covering a period
of more than a month, and have finally
reached the following conclusions:
First, That all the charges in onr
judgment may be grouped under the
two questions :
(a) Did Rev. C. O. Brown, D.D., com
mit adultery with either Mrs. M. A.
Stockton or Miss Martha Overman?
(b) Has he been guilty of any conduct
seriously affecting his ministerial char
acter?
Second, That touching the first of
these two questions we are able to make
answer that the evidence before us does
not sustain the charge of adultery with
either Mrs. Stockton or Miss Overman.
Third, That touching the question of
unministerial conduct we find In Dr.
Brown certain constitutional infirmities
of temper in the light of which his
actions must be judged, and which to
some extent modify opinions of his con
duct, so that in one case where the use
of harsh and intimidating language is
charged against him an apology fol
lowed so quickly that we do not further
notice it. In another case, while the
menacing and intimidating language
used was not Justified, it was the
hasty speech of an angry man
but in the case of a young lady of the
purest character and the highest worth
who felt herself threatened with a fear
ful charge because she had opposed the
pastor, we find his conduct to have vio
lated all rules which should control the
actions of a gentleman and a Christian
minister, and we cens-ure him for it.
While we gladly recognize the kindly
and manly words of appreciation and
reparation offered by him to the young
lady in our presence we should be glad
to add to this verdict that the various
facts in the case so far as ascertained
have not left a trace of suspicion in our
mind* concerning the hitherto stainless
reputation of this honored minister of
the Gospel, but we are regretfully com
pelled to confess that Dr. Brown's ex
planation of the reasons in his mind for
paying to Mrs. Davidson the sura of
*500 and agreeing to pay the further
sum of 53. 5 per month for a series of
years, all for the purpose of securing the
sii.iu-.- of a supposed Mrs. Baddin, is not
altogether satisfactory to us, and
that Miss Overman's testimony
as to having changed certain let
ters known as the Overman-Tunnell
letters which contained the chief in
criminating evidence in this case Is
impaired seriously by confessed false
hoods previously told concerning the
same matter, while the strange and
apparently significant absence from the
City of the receiver of the letters has
added to our embarrassment la the effort
to ascertain the truth.
While we have felt compelled to con
demn the acts now specified In our
brother's conduct, it Is our hope and
prayer that the sharp lessons of recent
months may be taken to heart by him,
and that in consequence his future years
may be move fruitful than any in the
past. It is especially our earnest
hope that in the painful and divided
conditions In which this experience has
left this loved and honored church, both
he and its members may be led to such a
clear understanding of their duty to
each other and to the Divine Master
that the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace may be preserved here and in
the whole sisterhood ot the chnrrh.
Dated at San Francisco, March 17,
1896. (Signed)
J. R. McLEAN, Moderator.
GEORGE B. BATCH, Scribe.
Such was the verdict rendered by the
ecclesiastical council at a quarter past 10
o'clock last night after a long month of
investigation. One copy was served upon
Dr. Brown and another upon Deacon
Morse, representing the congregation.
Dr. Brown received word of tne verdict
or some version of it almost before it was
submitted. After having received the
copy he appeared at The Call office and
invited congratulations on his "acquit
tal." He then, aided by Attorney Nagle,
dictated the following dispatch to the
United Press correspondent for dissemina
tion throughout the country:
San Francisco, March 17.
The ecclesiastical court of inquiry which has
been engaged in investigating certain charges
preferred against Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown of the
First Congregational Church of this City con
cluded its labor this evening at 10 o'clock,
bringing in a unanimous verdict acquitting
the pastor on every charge against him, and
concluding with "a hope and ,>rayer that the
sharp lessons of recent months may be taken to
heart by him, and in consequence his future
years may be more fruitful than any in the
past, and especially tbat this experience has
left this loved and honored church and its
pastor with a clearer understanding or thei'
duty to each other and to the Divine Master."
The doctor is satisfied with the decision of
the court, which could go no further in vindi
cating him than it did. The finding will bare
a material bearing on the charge of extortion
now pending against Mrs. Mary A. Davidson.
Dr. Brown also said: "The official steno
graphic report of my evidence shows to
any who choose to investigate that I did
not say that my chief reason for paying
$.500 was to secure the silence of any Mrs.
Baddin, but, rather, to secure evidence
upon which the criminal might be dis
closed and punished. This very impoitant
testimony the^council entirely ignores in
their report."
After the council adjourned Moderator
McLean said: "There is no appeal from
our verdict. Congregationalism acts on
the assumption that Christian people are
not expected to need discipline; it is only
the exception. The church taKes these
findings of fact, and if the church sees fit
to go against these findings it will be al
lowed to do so : but if the other Congrega
tion churches think that the council was
not treated justly the other churches can
withdraw from fellowship. This advice of
the council will have no more weight than
the weight of reason in it."
There were eighteen members of the
council present and two ab;-ent, Rev. I. M.
Hoyt of Sacramento and Deacon Parkin
son of Stockton. The verdict at the head
of the article was adopted unanimously.
The copy intended for Dr. Brown was
placed in "the hands of Valentine, his son,
who ran with it upstairs to his father's of
fice, where he and Lawyer Nagle and Dea
con Morse were awaiting the verdict.
The two doors leading to the office were
then closed against the reporters and
Valley Brown stood guara inside the outer
door with the knob in his hand to prevent
the reporters from turning it. After a half
hour of meditation Dr. Brown came out,
and smilingly remarking that he was
going home proceeded to The Call edito
rial-rooms with the dispatch to the United
Press as printed above.
He shook hands with his acquaintances
and requested their congratulations on
what he called his victory.
Deacon Morse, who was neither very
grave nor very gay, called the reporters
into the study ana dictated the verdict to
them without comment.
The verdict of the council will be pre
sented to the church at a meeting to be
held at 7:30 this evening.
LAST DAY'S SESSION.
The Work of Reaching a Verdict
Causes a Bitter Dis
cussion.
The last day's session of the Brown
council was fruitful of a verdict and re
plete to overflowing with exciting inci
dents, in which the ten judges viea with
their associate lay brethren in hitter deÂ»
nunciation and at times prayerful pleadÂ£
ings.
At 10 o'clock the committee on findings
convened in executive session. For nearly
three hours they labored with the difficult
problems before them, and when the lunch
hour came they announced with some
show of playfulness that a verdict had
been reached and would be submitted to
the council at 2 o'clock.
When that hour arrived and still
another roiled by it was evident that the
findings of the committee did not by any
manner of means please some of the indi
vidual members of the council.
In fact, Dr. Freeland, backed by two or
three of the older members, sprang a little
surprise in the shape of a minority report,
which they declared would be presented
unless the council embodied their oft
repeated sentiments in the general find
ings.
For nearly two hours tue point was ar
gued, the fight settling down finally be
tween representatives of the old and new
Congregational school, the former being
represented by such men as Dr. McLean
and Dr. Freeland, the latter finding earn
est champions in Dr. Williams, Dr. Ten
ney and Dr. Hoyt.
The main point at issue was the severity
of the verdict, and in the final shake-up
the old school won. That is, they secured
a mixed verdict on the main charges.
During the general debate the self-styled
"boss whitewasher of the Pacific Coast,"
Dr. Pond, made an earnest appeal to the
council to temper their decision with
mercy. He pleaded specially for the ac
cused man's family, endeavoring to show
that an unfavorable verdict would operate
more narshly against them than against Dr.
Brown.
The speaker was listened to respectfully,
but his remarks made no lasting impression
on the minds of his fellow judges.
At 4 o'clock Dr. Brown was sent for, but
the result proved that he was several hours
too early.
Patiently and anxiously he waited for
some word of solace, and when it finally
came and he had been given an oppor
tunity to see in cold black letters that
which meant so much to him, he shut
himself in the study, where, attended by
Attorney Nagle and Deacon Morse, the
full findings were read.
In the meantime Dr. Hoyt withdrew
from the council, saying that he was com
pelled to be in Sacramento last night.
Later it was rumored that Dr. Hoyt was
not satisfied with the hostility shown by
certain members of the council to the find*
ings of the committee, and not caring to
bein what promised to be a divided con
clusion determined to quietly .absent him
self. The rumor could not be verified last
night.
Shortly after 9 o'clock Dr. Tenney and
Mr. Barker made a hurried exit from the
council chamber in search of a typewriter.
The verdict had been rendered and Dr.
Brown was to know his fate in less than
half an hour. From another member of
the council who left for his home just after
Dr. Tenney withdrew to secure copies of
the decision the full verdict was learned.
A Call representative told Dr. Brown
of the result, that gentleman paling per
ceptibly under the unqualified expression.
But when informed that the verdict had a
"rider" to it, his face brightened, and he
muttered an almost inaudible "Thank
God."
A dispatch from Los Angeles last night
says that Mattie Overman and Mrs. Tun
nell left San Diego Monday morning,
Miss Overman saying they were on their
way back to San Francisco. Mrs. Brown
said last night that she Knew nothing
about the matter.
The findings of the council will be
formally presented to the church to-night.
Myrtle Still Missing.
Myrtle Costello, who some days ago disap
peared from Santa Cruz with a woman in the
theatrical profession, is believed by the Hu
mane Society officers to be at 425 Kearny
street, although her presence there is strenu
ously denied by parties at that place. The
house is being closely watched. Further evi
dence regarding the circumstances of the girl's
disappearance from her home in Santa Cruz
was received by General McComb yesterday.
A SVENGALI IN COURT
Claims He Used Hypnotism to
Relieve a Stenographer of
Writer's Cramp.
WAS THE SUBJECT ASLEEP?
Dr. Abraham Says She Was, bat Miss
Rae Alexander, the Defendant,
Denies the Allegation.
"It is my vish," was the exclamation of
Dr. Albert Abrahams who played the part
of medical Svengali in the presence of
Miss Rae Alexander who had come to him
for medical treatment. His wish was that
the ailment from which she was suffering
should disappear and he claims his wish
was carried out, but the young lady dis
putes the claim And the result is that she
is now a defendant in an action brought
by the doctor to recover for professional
services which he alleges are reaionably
worth $100.
Miss Alexander, a pretty, vivacious
young woman, is by profession a sten
ographer, ana in order to carry on her
business it is necessary that she should be
nimble with the fingers in order to place
on paper the many signs that represent
the spoken words of others.
This requirement she fulfilled until some
time atro, when she was stricken with
"pen paralysis,' 1 which is sometimes
called "writer's cramp." She visited sev
eral physicians, who prescribed the old
time remedies and treatment for the
trouble, but as they did not afford her the
sought-for relief, she, in company with
her sister, waited upon Dr. Abrahams at
his office on Geary street and asked what
he could do toward giving her relief.
The doctor, who is a close student and a
believer in hypnotism as a remedial
agent, expressed the opinion that he could
make her regain the use of her hand if she
would follow the course he suggested.
The lady, anxious to try any "ism" that
would give her the opportunity 10 earn
her living, consented to place herself un
der his treatment. There were a number
of visits to the office, the application of
that mysterious force that enables one to
take possession of the mind of another,
the placing of Miss Alexander in a condi
tion, so it is claimed, that she was no
longer mistress of her actions and did only
what the doctor wished; and at the end
of the Svengali seances the doctor told her
that she no longer had pain.
At the last seance the doctor presented
the sequel to hypnotism in the shape of a
bill for $30 for professional services. Miss
Alexander demurred, asserting that she
was not free from pain and could not re
sume her usual vocation, while the doc
tor asserted that the "writer's cramp" ex
isted only in her imagination. The doc
tor wanted his fee; Mi&s Alexander put
down her foot and said "No," and her
friends supported her in her determina
tion to resi3t payment. The result is the
suit alluded to.
"This action," said Dr. Abrahams last
evening, "is only & matter of principle
with me. It is not the amount of money
that I care for, but I performed services
for the lady, cured her, and I am entitled
to my fee. lam aware that it will cost
me more than the amount of the bill, but
1 am moved to act in this case by pure
principle.
"This young lady," continued the doc
tor, "was suffering from writer's cramp
when she cailea on me first, and the attack
was so bad that she could only make
scrawls on paper. I treated her by hyp
notism, with the result that when I ceased
my treatment she was able to write as well
as ever.
"I do not care to enter into the details
of this new treatment at this time, as that
will all come out in court when the case
comes up for trial; but I can say that this

[Drawn from a photograph.}
is a very interesting treatment, and the
result proves the value of hypnotism in a
certain class of cases."
Miss Alexander, when served with the
papers, secured the services of Attorney
George H. Cabaniss, who prepared an
answer in which is made a general denial
of the allegations of the complaint.
The fair defendant in discussing the ac
tion brought against her said:
"Why, the doctor didn't do anything
for me. He placed me in a chair, rubbed
his hand across my forehead and said:
'You're asleep, now, ain't you?' and when
I replied 'No, certainly not,' he insisted
that I was and added 'Yes, you are; only
you don't know it.'
"Now, the idea of my not knowing if I
was asleep or awake ! The doctor also in
sisted that the pain was gone, when I
knew it was not. This will all be told
when I and my sister who was with me at
each visit give our testimony.!'
"I do not think that when the case
comes up,' 1 said Attorney Cabaniss,
"there will oe anylack of testimony descrip
tive of the treatment for the young lady.
It will be all about the manner in which
she was svengalied."
