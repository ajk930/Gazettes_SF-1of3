OPPOSED TO REFUNDING.

A PLOT BEHIND THE SCHEME.
In Ten Years Huntington Would Be
Willing to Turn Over Two Rusty
Streaks of Iron.
, WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31.-Repre-
Bentative.-Maguira^ spoke for three hours
before the House Committee on Pacific
railroads to-day ; in opposition to the re
funding bill. For the first time during the
hearings the entire committee was present
and great interest was manifested by all.
Maguire commenced by saying that a
great storehouse of reliable information
concerning the Pacific railroads would be
the report of the Pacific Railroad Com
mission, which is now almost inacessible
even to members of the committee, and
entirely so to most of the members of the
House, who will be called upon to vote on
any bill reported by the committee. He
regretted to learn that the committee yes
terday % decided not to order even the
volume containing the majority and
minority reports of that commission
printed.
, Chairman Powers said that the commit
tee equally regretted that it was forced to
that action because the cost of printing
the report would alone exceed the limit of
expenditure which the committee is au
thorized to make for printing. Â« â¢
Maguire then asked if the committee
â¢would support a resolution offered in the
House for printing the report. Chairman
Powers said the committee would support
such a resolution in the House and he was
sure that every member of the committee
would urge its adoption. . \ \
. Maguire said that he would immediately
introduce a resolution to that effect and
proceeded" with his argument. He ana
lyzed the offer of settlement by the , Cen
tral Pacific t Railroad Company, showing
that each piece of*sa^cstied'iadditf(Jnal'Be-'
curity for the Government debt is already
mortgaged far beyond its value and really
added nothing whatever ;to the security
already held by the Government. ' He said
that the so-called blanket â  . mortgage . of
$16,000,000 resting as the third mortgage
on the entire Central Pacific system is a
first mortgage on the Oakland mole and
other terminal property of the company
in Oakland and is vastly in excess of the
value of all that property. .
The effect of the Smith refunding bill,
if adopted, would be to extend the Govern
ment mortgage over all of these branch
roads and terminals, making the : Govern
ment mortgage subordinate to all mort
gages and liens now resting upon such
property. This would, for all practical
purposes under the refunding - scheme,
make the Government, mortgage subor
dinate to/ the $16,000,000 third mortgage,
because the whole Central Pacific Rail
road, including terminals, was to be treated
as the system covered by the Government
refunding mortgage. The payments re
served on account of the Government
mortgage are to be paid out of the earn
ings of the Central Pacific Railroad after
the payment of all operating expenses
â¢nd other fixed charges, including interest,
on all branches.
"Now the blanket mortgage,' 1 g<;id
Maguire, "will be a prior encv^'urance
upon a necessary part of the system. Hutt
are you going to segregate that mortgage
so as to make any part of it subsequent to
the Government mortgage under the Smith
bill. You cannot do it without the con
<Â«ent of bondholders, and they wiil not
consent, because as a third mortgage their
lien wiil be worthless, and their only
c-nance of securing payment is by insisting
on priority. The result is that under the
refunding scheme the whole so-called first
mortgage indebtedness of $27,800,000, the
Lathrop and Goshen mortgage of $5,800,000,
the Niles and Oakland mortgage of
$700,000, the California and Oregon mort
gage of at least $10,300,000, and the blanket
mortgage of $16,000,000, aggregating $60,
--600,000, will be made prior to the Govern
ment mortgage amounting with interest
now to about $59,000,000, and after deduct
ing the sinking fund and earnings, a grand
total of $119,600,000, upon all of which the
road must in some way be made to pay
interest, if the refunding scheme ia to be
carried out.
"How is that to be done? I say it can
not and will not be done. But its promoters
have some very well-settlea purposes,
which will be accomplished by it to the
great injury of the Pacific Coast and the
ultimate loss to the National Government
of substantially all that the Central Pacific
Railroad Company now owes it. It is plain
that any attempt to carry out the refund
ing scheme will involve the necessity on
the part of the Interstate Commerce Cora
missior to fix freights and fares over that
road at rates high enough to pay all of the
lixed charges, including interest upon all
the present mortgages upon the system be
fore an<l in addition to the payments re
eerved tc the Government under the re
funding bill. The commission cannot re
duce freights and fares below that without
wilfully interfering with the effort of the
Government to collect the money due it.
Now that necessary course on the part
of the commission must result in one of
two thingsâ it must either produce the
necessary revenue from the rates so fixed
to maintain in the same excessive charges
over its own roads or the refunding scheme
mr.st speedily fail under the pressure of
competition, in which case the United
States Government will be in a far worse
position than it now is with reference to
the co-lection of money due it.
â¢â¢The refunding scheme will dace the
The San Francisco Call.
Central Pacific Railroad where it can do
nothing but demand excessive freight and
passenger rates, even if the demand should
drive away all the business it might other
wise obtain. Now, it so happens that this
result would be to the highest possible
advantage to the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which is now, and will be for more
than eighty years undefr its lease, in abso
lute control of the Central Pacific Railroad,
in which neither it nor its stockholders
have any substantial financial interest, but
the Southern Pacific has a transconti
nental railroad line pnvatelyand complete
ly owned by its stockholders, and would
be free under the refunding scheme to
underbid the Central Pacific and to take
and reap a rich harvest of the profit from
traffic thus driven away from the Central
Pacific road. The Central Pacific road
would then in the way of directly promot
ing the interests of the people controlling
it be allowed to fall into disuse and decay,
until at the end of about ten years the
re-funding scheme would be abandoned
and the Government would get what Mr.
Huntington is said to have facetiously
described as 'two streams of rust and a
right of way from San Francisco to Ogden.'
"I think it is with this purpose in view
that the representatives of the Central
Pacific Railroad Company innocently ask
that for the first ten years it be required
to pay to the Government only 1 per cent
upon the funded debt. It will be well
worth all the payments that they propose
to make during the first ten years to keep
the road under their control for the double
purpose of wrecking the road by diverting
traffic to their own line and yet, by con
trolling the Central Pacific Railroad, to
prevent its being operated as a competing
line. The refunding scheme will, there
fore, work untold injury to California, and
to the West generally, without any proba
bility of securing the payment of the claim
of the Federal Government."
Johnsonâ You say that the Southern
Pacific people are now diverting traffic
from the Central to the Southern road.
What proof have you of that?
Maguireâ Speaking of my personal
knowledge I know that the Southern
Pacific Company ships freight across the
continent by the Southern Pacific Railroad
cheaper than by the Central Pacific road.
Geary (by permission) â Mr. Maguire,
what you state in that behalf, I believe is
correct, but is not that due entirely to the
fact that the Southern Pacific Company
has a complete through line by the
Southern Pacific route and ships its freight
by water from New Orleans to New York,
while by the Central route it is ob'iged to
bill freight over roads of other companies
at a greater expense ?
Maguire â I do not know why cheaper
freight rates are offered over the Southern
Pacific than by the Central route, and I
am not concerned about the reason for it.
What I say is that the Southern Pacific
Company is actually diverting freignt to
its own southern road by giving cheaper
freight rates than it gives over the Central
Pacific to the same points on the Atlantic
Coast. 1 know, too, of my own knowiedge,
that the Southern Pacific Company has
withd-rawn its passenger tickets from the
ticket offioe of toe Unio:. Pacific Railroad j
Company in Sau Francisco, and from the j
offices of all other roads in thai city, thub
making it impossible to purchase a ticket
over any railroad running to and from San
Francisco without going to the ticket
office of the Southern Pacific Company to
purchase it and at least givine a first
class opportunity to agents of that com
pany to recommend the Southern
Pacific Railroad to all passengers.
Outside of my personal knowledge, but
upon authority which I consider reliable
upon the report of the Pacific Railway
Commission; upon the supplemental re
port of Mr. Coombs, one of the Govern
ment directors of the Union Pacific Rail
road; upon the constantly repeated news
paper statements, and upon the general
reputation and rumor among the people
of San Francisco, I feei safe in saying that
the Southern Pacific Company is con
stantly and by all means in its power di
verting freight and passenger traffic to the
Southern Pacific from the Central road.
Maguire read from Director Coombs' re
port, in which the latter stated he had
been informed by numerous business men
and others that pressure was brought on
shippers to ship by tne Southern road in
preference to the Central.
Johnsonâ Now, Mr. Maguire, with the
greatest reject and deference to you per
sonally, do you think it is fair or reason
able to quote a statement such as that of
Mr. Coombs, when he shows by his own
statement the source of his information is
a mere rumor and by conversations with
men whose knowledge comes from mere
rumor? Why, sir, I could prove in that
way that you are an anarchist (which I
know you are uot) because some people
have said so and have made rumor of it.
Maguire â Yes, I remember Mr. Hunting
ton said it to The Call correspondent in
Washington, and it was published in Cali
fornia. I presume that was the source of
your information. He said, I believe, that
in his opinion, if I was in Europe I would
be an anarchist and would throw bombs.
Watson of Ohio asked if all railroad
companies through their agents did not
try to tU vert traffic to their own roads.
Maguireâ Yes; certainiy, and that uni
versal experience should satisfy us that if
the United States Government is to eet
anything out of the Central Pacific Rail
road it must in some way take that road
out of the hands of the company that is
certain to make money by diverting traffic
from it.
Maguire then proceeded to show
that freight and passenger rates
had always been excessive on
the Pacific Coast by reason of the
monopoly existing there, and answered
numerous questions concerning that phase
of the question. He said that some relief
had been secured to the people between
1883 and 1885 by the establishment of an
independent line of steamers operating
with the Panama Raiiroad, but that re
cently the control of the Panama road
had passed again to Mr. Huntincton and
his associates, and that freight rates to
the Atlantic coast had in consequence
been increased both by rail and water.
Johnson here interrupted again to ask
upon what evidence Maguire made the
assertion that the Panama Railroad Com
pany is now under the control of Mr.
Huntington and his associates.
Maguireâ Newspaper reports, Mr. John
son, and the fact that the freights that
were reduced while the Panama road waÃ
free from that control have been increased
again.
Geary â Isn't the contract with the Pan
ama Railroad made by a general combina
tion of overland trunk lines, and not by
the Southern Pacific Company alone?
Maguire â I do not know, sir. lam not
in the secrets of those institutions either
individually or collectively. I simply
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
know, as well as an outsider can know,
that the contract or combination has been
made with the Panama Railroad which
subjects the people of the Pacific Coast to
increased freight charges.
Maguire proceeded to show that by
funding the Pacific Railroad debts this
condition of the monopoly would be con
tinued for at least a very long period; that
the charges for transportation would be
based, not upon the value of the services,
as they should be, but upon the advantage
of the shipper of having his goods trans
ported. In other words, freight rates will
be fixed at all the traffic will bear, instead
of the value of the service. The railroad
monopoly, therefore, will insist upon be
ing let into partnership with all pro
ducers, just as in the case cited by Mr.
Bowers the other day, in which it ap
peared that freight rates on borax had
been raised because the borax business had
become more profitable than formerly to
those engaged in it.
Maguire went on to show that no re
funding scheme could be made applicable
to both the Union and Central Pacific
roads, and urged that the objections to
refunding the Central Paciiic debt applied
witn almost, if not quite the earn* forep,
to the Union Pacific as to the Central Pa
cific system.
The sensation of the day was caused by
Maguire's argument to show that the so
called first mortgage bonds were not in
fact prior liens, and that the Government
mortgage Â»vas, in fact, the first mortgage.
In support of this position he quoted at
length from Pacific Railroad laws and
from a written argument prepared by John
T. Doyle of San Francisco on the question.
He said that Doyle had been for many
years one of the leading lawyers of the
Pacific Coast, and was in fact one the
ablest lawyers in the country; that the
argument prepared by him was clear and
strong, and asked leave to have it printed
as a whole in his remarks, which was
granted.
Coming to the remedy, Maguire said that
any other course that might be pursued in
the Pacific Railroad matter wouid be better
than refunding; that it was an extraor
dinary thing for Congress 10 even listen to
an application for an extension of the
credit on behalf of an insolvent company
made by men who had rendered the com
pany insolvent by robbing it for their own
enrichment, and who had deprived the
company of the power to pay its debts to
the Government by diverting its assets to
their own pockets.
Those who had thus violated the old
contract could not well be trusted to be
faithful to the new one. He discussed the
liability of the directors of the Central and
Union Pacific Raiiroad companies, and
their successors in estate, to restore the
assets amounting to more than $150,000,000
which the Pacific Railway Commission
found they had diverted to themselves
from the two companies by means of
fraudulent contracts made by them with
themselves.
Chairman Powers claimed that the ques
tion of the right of the Government to sue
the directors for fraudulently diverted as
sets had been finally decided by the United

Abroad.
AFTER THE ARCHIVES.
Secretary Malet-Prevost to Go to
Madrid and an Expert to
The Hague.
LIGHT FROM OTHER SOUKCES.
Historical Data Bearing on the Bound
ary Dispute to Be Also
Sought in France.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. Sl.-The
Venezuelan Commission held its first reg
ular weekly meeting to-day in its perma
nent quarters, and took up the enormous
mass of official documents bearing on the
boundary question, which had 1 accumu
lated on the files 01 the State Department
in years past, and which had been trans
mitted by Secretary Olney, in accordance
with the commission's formal request
adopted at its last meeting.
These papers, together with the volun
tary contributions of old maps, books and
other data which has been received from
various sources, have enabled the commis
sion to make a genernl estimate of the
state of the case and take up the consider
ation of specific researches which must be
pursued to secure corroborative or contra
dictory evidence.
It has been already practically deter
mined that Secretary Malet-Prevost will
shortly proceed to Madrid to ransack the
Spanish archives for records that his ex
perience leads him to believe are in exist
ence, but have not until this time been
connected with the case. Satisfactory as
surances ha^e been given that every facil
ity will be afforded him for his researches.
One of the commissioners or an expert
selected by them will in all probability be
sent to the Hague to study the Dutch
archives at the same time.
Spanish investigation having been un
dertaken, and as historical data of the
highest importance is known to be in the
possession of the French National Li
brary, it is not beyond the possibilities
that a sufficient number of the commis
sioners or their agents will go to Europe in
[Rrproducd from the New York Hera'd.]
the next two or three months to hold a
meeting in some convenient Continental
rendezvous.
All the members were in attendance at
the session which lasted practically nli
day, with a brief intermission for lunch
eon.
Secretary Malet-Prevost announced that
the chief morning business had been the
discussion of some State Department pa
pers as well as well as the tenders of as
sistance which had poured in from every
direction, showing a commendable desire
on the part of the people everywhere to
offer evidence.
Nothing had yet been presented by
either the Governments of Great Britain
or Venezuela, nor had any communication
of any kind been received from these
countries notifying the commission
whether or not they would accede to the
request to have representation through
counsel.
The commission at 4 o'clock adjourned
until next Friday, the members in the
meantime to pursue their individual study
of the evidence at hand as well as the
search for useful information.

The Prime I'tini Explain* Hi* View*
'â¢â  ''.'â¢â  " on the ' Monroe Doctrine. "â¢',-^.y
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 31.â Prime Min
ister Salisbury delivered a speech here to
night, in the course of which he rebutted
the statements made Thursday night by
John Morley to the electors at Arbroath
concerning the Monroe doctrine. Mr.
Morley said Lord Salisbury had blundered
in seeming to anestion the Monroe doc
trine and that if ever there was a question
that should be arbitrated it was the Vene
zuelan boundary question.
Lord Salisbury said to-night that al
though the doctrine formed no part of
international law, his dispatch to Secretary
Olney supported it as a rule of policy as
strongly and distinctly as possible, but in
the form in which President Monroe him
self understood it.
The Prime Minister expressed sympathy
with the Armenians, but denied that
Great Britain was under an obligation to
declare war against the Sultan of Turkey
in order to compel him to govern justly
and cited the treaties in proof of his con
tention. He ascribed the atrocities to tne
passions of race and creed. He believed
that the Sultan's government was wretched
and impotent, Dut there was no ground for
imagining that the Sultan had instigated
the massacres.
It might be asked why Europe did not
interfere. He could only answer for Eng
land, She had lacked the power to do the
only thing necessary to end the troublesâ
namely, to militarily occupy Turkish
provinces. None of the powers wished so
to occupy them.
Lord Salisbury said he concurred in the
policy that the only authority, albeit it
was an evil one. in that country was the
prestige of the Sultan's name. Patience
must be exercised and his Majesty must
be given time to enforce the reform he had
promised. He remarked upon the gradual
return of order in Anatolia during the last
few weeks, although he admitted that
these signs should not be trusted too
much.
He concluded by declaring that if Great
Britain did not co-operate with the other
powers she must act aeainst them, which
would lead to calamities far more awiui
than the Armenian massacres.
CAXADIASS JSOT COWARDS.
Sir Oliver 2Uoteat Says They Would. Fight
if Accessary-
BUFFALO, N. V., Jan. 31.â Sir Oliver
Mowat, Premier of tie Province of On
tario for the past twenty -two years, visited
Buffalo yesterday on private business. In
an interview on international topics Sir
Oliver was asked what effect the recent
war talk had in Canada. He replied:
"Canada is strengthening her forces and
defenses now. The present crisis has cer
tainly caused this and there has been ab
solutely no difference of opinion on the
matter. Nor has this come from any hint
received from the Colonial Office in Great
Britain."
"But Mr. Chamberlain will not be slow
to note the sicnificance of the fact?"
"No, for with all our differences, racial
and sectarian, we were a unit when we
appeared to be in danger. French Cana
dians joined heartily with the Protestants
of Ontario and demonstrated how little
real sentiment there is for annexation to
day. Never in my whole public career
have I seen so much loyalty to Great
Britain."
"You don't think there is any possibility
of war?"
"I hope not. I pray God such a dire
calamity may be honorably averted. You
know that the United States has many
good reasons apart from one common
language to be friendly toward Great
Britain. We are really brothers, and such
a war would be cruel, wicked and fratri
cidal. Still, it is a wonder how quickly al!
responded to the call of danger, and how
all races and creeds joined in a deter
mination to show their solid strength and
patriotism on behalf of the motherland.
"Of course, we do not believe there will
be war. We have no reason to be other
than friendly and neighborly, but Cana
dians are not cowards. We have had fric
tion with the United States before on many
issues, but never witnout cause, and I do
not see why all disputes should not be
amicably settled. We claim only the right
to live neighborly and do our business
honorably with the United States, but we
also claim the right to know what is best
for ourselves and to be allowed to manage
our own affairs a3 we deem best. This
Canadians will always do. We are not
cowards, you know, nor are we alarmed
even now."
"And do you think Great Britain will
tight?"
"I said that I did not think there would
be war between England and the United
States. Just now, envied by all countries.
England's 'splendid isolation 1 is the ad
miration of the world. There is no mis
taking her temper or her power. She
seems doubly proud and heroic as she
stands out alone against the powers as if
she almost gloried in her friendlessness.
She stands a splendid spectacle. And if
she would be called upon to fight, I ven
ture to think she will not fight alone, or
that she will not be equal to the occasion."

Rumors of War Cauned. an Expenditure
or thf. Militia.
OTTAWA, Ontario, Jan. 31.â Finance
Minister Foster delivered . his budget
speech in the House of Commons to-day.
He said the falling off of revenue during
the year, as compared with the previous
year, amounted to $2,396,563.
The actual revenue was $33,968,125 and
the expenditures $38,122,000, leaving a de
ficit for 1894-95 of $4,153,875. There were a
number of increases in this year's esti
mates, more particularly in that regarding
the militia.
He pointed to the rumors of trouble
which existed a few months ago between
Great Britain and the United States and
gave this as a good excuse for the expendi
ture on the militia.
The Government proposed this expendi
ture out of no hostility to any country
under the sun. What was desired by the
Government was to place in the hands of
the people of Canada the necessary means
of resistance should the emergency arise.
WILLIAMSON ACQUITTED.
The Wichita Jury Evidently
Could Not Be Convinced
of His Guilt.
Considerable Testimony, However,
Connected Him With the Mur
der of Leonard.
WICHITA, Kans., Jan. 31.â Marion
Williamson, who has been on trial here for
the past three days, charged with the
murder of Henry H. Leonard on the night
of November 17, was acquitted to-day. The
jury was out all night.
The trial created unusual interest from
the fact that a great deal of testimony of a
contradictory character was introduced.
Mrs. Leonard accused Williamson, her ex
husband, of the crime and described in
detail the attendant horrors in a state
ment made at the time of the arrest, but
she did not testify against Williamson at
his trial. Michael Jordan, from the Sol
diers' Home at Leavenworth, testified that
the defendant toJd him that Mrs. Leonard
would give any man $500 who would mur
der Leonard, and urged him to undertake
the job. Jordan stated that Williamson
described the Leonard premises and sug
eested that the old man be killed in the
space back of his second-hand store.
George H. States, a gas-fitter, testified
that he saw Mrs. Leonard and Williamson
in a bu?gy by the roadside the day before
the murder looking over Leonard's insur
ance policy, and on the stand Williamson
admitted that such was the fact.
Professor Willston of the State Univer
sity testified that an analysis of stains
found on Williamson's coat showed them
to be blood. In view of all this evidence
the verdict of not guilty comes as a sur
prise to most people. Mrs. Leonard's sec
ond trial day has not been set.

BRISBANE, Queensland, Jan. 31.â
Great loss of life and very large destruction
of property have been caused in the north

floods.
It is impossible as yet to tell how many
persons lost their lives, but it ia known
that great numbers were drowned. The
damage to property is estimated at
$2,500,000.
Several coasting vessels are missing, and
it is believed that they have either foun

aboard of them were lost.
Townsville, a seaport on Cleveland Bay,
suffered more than any other place in the
districts affected. There is scarcely a

Two ships at Tongatabco Island were

SEEKING A BIG BUILDING
Democrats Making Arrange
ments for the Chicago
Convention.
Advantages of the Coliseum and Tat
tersalls Explained to the
Committee.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 31.â The members
of the sub-committee of the Democratic
National Committee appointed to look
over the local halls and make arrange
ments for the National convention in July
met at the Palmer House at noon to-day.
Those present were: Chairman William F.
Harrity of Philadelphia; Colonel John
Prather, St. Louis; Thomas H. Sherley,
Kentucky; Ben Cable, Illinois; Secretary
S. P. Sherin, Indiana, and L. W. Nieman,
Milwaukee, proxy for E. C. Wall, Wis
consin.
The afternoon was spent in looking over
the plans of the Coliseum, now in course
of erection, and the interior of Tattersalls.
At the evening session John T. Dickin
son, formerly secretary of the World' 3 Co
lumbian Commission, explained the ad
vantages of the Coliseum now in course
of erection near the World's Fair grounds.,
By an adjustable amphitheater, he said, itt
could be made to seat from 5000 to 20,000
--people, with spacious aisles, ample en
trances and exits for the delegates and
special entrances for the press. The trans
portation facilities of the steam, elevated
and surface roads were equal to the con
veyance of 15,000 people inside of one hour
from the central portion of the city.
John Edmondson spoke briefly for Tat
tersalls, the interior of which he claimed
could be bo arranged as to seat 16,000 people
on the main floor and in the galleries.
The committee, after hearing the ad
dresses on halls, went into executive ses
sion until midnight. It was decided to
postpone the selection of hotel headquar
ters and the appointment of sergeant-at
arms until to-morrow. The local commit
tee offered to build a wigwam at any
location the sub-committee might desig
nate in case neither of the halls offered
proved acceptable.

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 31.â The name of
William McKinley was the one which
charmed the members of the Hamilton
Club and their guests to-night in the ban
quet hall of the Auditorium Hotel, where
the sixth annual feast and speech-making
of that prominent Republican social or
ganization took place. Governor Bush
nell, who came last but one on the toast
list, was the most distinguished speaker
who eulogized the civic and political vir
tues of his predecessor. It was distinct
ively a McKinley affair, with speeches of a
general Republican character, and a plea
from Professor Booker T. Robinson of Ala
bama for the negro as the new citizen.
Senator-elect Foraker was expected to
respond to the toast, "The Republican
Party." but business engagements kept
him at home.

DUNRAVEN LET
DOWN LIGHTLY
Report of the Investigating
Committee on His
Charge.
ALL DUE TO A MISTAKE.
But the Yachtsmen Did Not State
in What Particular It
Was Made.
WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVINCED.
His Lordship, However, Did Not Re
main Long Enough to Hear the
Evidence.
NBW YORK, N. V., Jan. 31.â The com
mittee appointed by the New York Yacht
Club to investigate the charges made by
Lord Dun raven in reference to the last
America cup races made public its report
to-night. The committee consists of E.
J. Tlielps, J. Pierpont Morgan, W. C.
Whitney, A. T. Mahan and G. L. Rives.
Lord Dunraven charged the secret altera
tion of the water-line length of the De
fender by transferring ballast from the
tender Hattie Palmer during the night,
and criticized the competence or good
judgment of those in charge of the races.
The report says, regarding Lord Dun
raven's appearance before the committee:
"He declined to undertake to substan
tiate or prosecute the charge, but said he
felt bound to attend and make his state
ment and to furnish to the committee, in
aid of their inquiry, such evidence in sup
port of the charge as he possessed."
His statement was a reiteration of the
speech made by him in London and which
has been fully published. The commit
tee, after reviewing fully every circum
stance connected with the case, concludes
its report as follows:
"Upon a careful consideration of the
whole case the committee is unanimously
of the opinion that the charge made by
Lord Dunraven, and which has been the
subject of this investigation, had its origin
in a mistake; that it is not only not
sustained by evidence, but is completely
disproved, and that all the circumstances
indicated by him as giving rise to his sus
picion are entirely and satisfactorily ex
plained. They.deem it, therefore, but just
to Mr. Iselin and the gentlemen concerned
with him, as well as to the officers and
crew of the Defender, that the committee
should express emphatically their convic
tion that nothing whatever occurred in
connection with the race in question that
casts the least suspicion upon the integ
rity or propriety of their conduct.
"And the committee is not willing to
doubt that if Lord Dunraven had remained
present throughout the investigation, so as
to have heara all the evidence that was in
troduced, he would of his own motion have
withdrawn a charge that was so plainly
founded upon mistake, and that has been
so unfortunate in the publicity it has at
tained and the feeling to which it has given
rise."
A special general meeting of the New
York Yacht Club was held at the club
house, 67 Madison avenue, to-night for the
purpose of presenting the report. There
was a large attendance of members pres
ent. J. Pierpont Morgan, in the absence
of Hon. E. J. Phelps, chairman of the
committee, read the report.
The members frequently interrupted the
reading at each telling point with marked
applause. "When Mr. Morgan concluded,
the report was, on motion of Commodore
Smith, received, accepted and adopted
amid a scene of great enthusiasm. Ex-
Commodore Brown said:
"The most able report I have ever
listened to. Cannot help but satisfy
everybody."
The sturdy commodore was one of the
most indignant of the members at the
charges brought by Lord Dunraven. None
of the members would express any opinion
as to what would be the ultimate action
taken by the club on the report. None of
the others would say anything for pub
lication.
COMMENT OF THE FBESS.
English Xeuapapera Accept the Verdict,
of the Committee.
LONDON, Esq., Jan. 31.â The Standard
to-morrow, commenting on the findings of
the committee of inquiry of the New York
Yacht Club in the matter of the charge
made by Lord Dunraveu against the De
fender syndicate, will say:
It may be acknowledged that the finding,
although hostile to Lord Dunraven'e con
tention, is studiously courteous and is well
calculated to lay the unpleasant business
to rest.
The paper adds that it regrets that Lord
Dunraven was unable to hear all the evi
dence. No doubt if he had and deemed it
sufficient to elucidate his - suspicions he
would â¢ have been the first " to ; admit his
mistake.
The Chronicle will say: The com
mittee was so strong and distin
guished that its findings must be received
as a conclusive verdict. The only ques
tion now that remains is what is Lord
Dunraven going to do? It will â¢be the
opinion, we are confident, of all British
lovers of the best kind of sport that there
is only one course open for him and that is
to make an instant and complete apology.
.; The Morning Post will say: The
decision will be loyally accepted by Lord
Dunraven and his fellow-yachtsmen here.
It is a thousand pities that Lord Dunraven
acted so hastily.
The Times: Whatever degree of assent
the findings may command in yachting
circles in this country, they will every
where be received with respect, as a result
of an inquiry conducted by men of unim
peachable honor, probity and position. ;"â¢'

Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 31. â Governor
Busbuell of Ohio, who arrived here to-day
to ,speak at the Hamilton Club and Ohio
Society banquets, spent most of the day at
the residence of his business partner. J. J.
Glassner, at 1800 Prairie avenue. "While
there he said in an interview:
"There is no foundation for the state
ment that the Republican parly of Ohio is
divided into factions, and that Senator
Foraker will 'knife' McKinley when he
thinks the time opportune. These state
meats are simply born in the imagination
of the writers. Senator Foraker is and
always will be in favor of McKinley for
the Presidential nomination, and -will be
one of the delcgates-at-large from Ohio.
1 have received reports from many sec
tions of Illinois which indicate a strong
McKinley sentiment among the masses.
The development of this sentiment will
come in the convention."

JAS. O'NEILL'S VENTURE
Preparing to Soon Produce a New
Version of the "Passion
Play."
San Franciscans Will Have an Oppor
tunity of Witnessing the Remark
able Performance.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 31. âIt is
learned that James O'Neill, the actor of
"Monte Christo" fame, has canceled all
his engagements for the future, and that
he will soon be in this city to make ar
rangements for the production of a new
version of the '"Passion Play." This
drama was written by Selmi Morse a num
ber of years ago, but its presentation, as
interpreted by O'Neill, was interdicted by
the authorities in several citiesâ notably
in San Francisco.
At the time Mr. O'Neill was Htrongly
impressed with the dramatic value of the
piece, and for a long time he has had in
mind a plan to rehabilitate the play after
eliminating what were considered its ob
jectionable features.
It is thought this has been accomplished
by recasting the entire production and
bringing it into the form of an oratorio,
with a score written by Weill. Those who
have examined the work declare that it is
a piece of marvelous sweetness, both in
the libretto and tne score, and that it con
tains nothing that the most carping critic
may justly condemn.
Some of the most startling and realistic
scenes of Morse's original draft have been
modified and subdued, so that the story is
told in devout and reverent words, borne
on the sweeping current of a mellifluous
theme of sacred music.
The motif of the play remains essentially
the same, but there is a tenderness of treat
ment that was absent from the original
work. '
An incorporated company has been
formed with a capital stock of 11,000,000 to
carry out th^ plans of those who believe
the revised oratorio may be made success
ful. The company is headed by Mr.
O'Neill, and is made up of that gontle
ruan's personal friends, among them be
ing William Greer Harrison of San Fran
cisco.
MS. HAXXJSOX'S VIEWS.
Hi Heliexea the Oratorio Can Be Made
Successful.
When William Greer Harrison was asked
concerning the report that James O'Neill
is about to revive the Passion Play in a
new form, he said: "I know very
little about the play of the new
syndicate : or â  company. I know that
the Passion Play has been arranged as
an oratorio. The entire piece was put in
my possession about three years ago, when
we had in contemplation a presentation of
it at the Midwinter Fair, but that idea was
at last abandoned. I had the score played
over for some excellent musical critics and
they declared it first class. So far as lam
personally concerned I believe the piece
can be made a big success if properly
handled, and I am willing to co in with
the company that proposes to put it prop
erly on the stage."
GARCIA NOT DISCOURAGED
Will Make a Second Attempt
to Lead Filibusters to
Cuba.
The Fishing Steamer Veazey Pur
chased to Take an Expedition
to the Islands.
NEW YORK. XT. V., Jan. 31.â General
Calixto Garcia will, it is positively stated
to-night, make a second attempt to lead a
filibustering expedition to Cuba within a
few days. Preparations for this venture
were begun on Monday last, as soon as the
fate of the J. W. Hawkins was learned by
the Junta.
The Veazey, a fishing steamer similar in
size and trim to the Hawkins and owned
by the American Fish Guano Company,
from which the Hawkins was purchased,
has been selected for the expedition. The
Veazey is now in Virginia waters headed
for New York. She was purchased m
Norfolk Tuesday last by a Mr. Chase, who
claimed to be a New York fish guano
dealer.
General Garcia will be accompanied by
General Collazo, and it is said that the ex
pedition will be one of the largest that
ever left this country. The Veazey does
not appear in the United States list of
merchant vessels for 1895.
The loss off Woodsholl of the Hawkins
was preceded by the probable loss of the
tug Mascot, which is believed to have gone
on a filibustering expedition. The Mascot
is now over sixty days out, unrepofted
from any source.
HAVANA. Cuba, Jan. 31.â 1t is reported
that rebels have destroyed the telegraph
line and damaged the railroad track south
of Bejucal, a short distance south of
Havana. It is supposed that it is the
work of some of Gomez's followers.
Acting Captain-General Marin has left
San Antonio de Los Banos and gone in
pursuit of them. No details are obtain*
able.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
CHAMPIONED BY
MR. BRADLEY.
Kentucky's Governor Is in
Favor of the Re
peal Bill.
URGED IN HIS MESSAGE.
Records of Legislative Leaders
Who Will Battle With
Huntingdon.
ARGUMENTS OF THE LOBBYISTS.
Southern Pacific Forces Will Fight
Desperately to Retain the
Charter.
FRANKFORT, Kt., Jan. 31.âHunting
ton's henchmen have gathered in Frank
fort in strong force and a bitter and "wide
open" tight will be made against Goebel's
W. O. BRADLEY, GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY.
[From a recent photograph.]
I bill to repeal the Southern Pacific charter.
Every influence that can be brought to
bear will be used to prevent its passage.
Huntington recognizes the fact that by a
combination of circumstances he stands in
danger of defeat and, it is said, has sum
moned to bis aid some of the best wire
workers at his command. His principle
of action that every man has his price
may fail him this time.
The fight in Washington has required
the services of most of his regular lobby
ists, but as the fight there is at a stand
still for a while some of them have been
called here. It is also said that H. E.
Huntington and others connected with
the California end of the monopoly are en
route for Frankfort.
This only serves to show that they ap
preciate the fact that the fight over the
repeal bill will be short, sharp and de
cisive. Huntington knows what a day
means in this case and ne proposes to look
after the legislators everyday and perhaps
every night also. His men are urging
upon the members that the act to repeal
is unconstitutional, and of course this has
its weight with some members who are
not versed in tne provisions of the new
constitution. With others they urge that
even if the repeal bill is passed it will have
to be tested in the courts, and that endless
and expensive litigation will be entailed
upon the State. With tne class of reformers
who on principle vote against any meas
ure that in the most remote degree in
volves the expenditure of a few dollars
this argument has great weight.
There are doubtless other and more
weighty arguments on hand, to be kept in
abeyance till the situation has been care
fully surveyed and it is ascertained where
it would be safe to apply them and to what
extent.
As has been indicated before in these
dispatches the temper of the people of
Kentucky is to reform the corporate
abuses that have grown up since the war.
The sweeping change made in the political
complexion of both houses was in a large
measure due to this.
Governor Bradley, the nr3t Republican
Governor that ever satin the chair in Ken
tucky, has pledged himself to reform
these and other abuses in many a cam
paign, and one of the most prominent
features of his message to the Legislature
was af follows :
Foreign railroads come into our State and
avail themselves of our laws, yet promptly
transfer every case that is transferable under
the Federal statutes to the United States
courts, which in many instances Is a denial of
justice to those who are too poor to leave their
homes to prosecute their causes in a distant
State.
Hitherto under the interstate commerce
provisions these corporations have suc
ceeded in defying: State legislation. Might
not this be remedied by the passage of
an act providing that no corporation, com
pany or association created or organized by
any authority other than the laws of this
State, whether acting by officers, agents or
receivers, shall carry over any railroad in this
State for pay, or from any point in this State
to any other point therein, either person or
property until the same shall become a cor
porate citizen, resident of this State, in the
manner as now or may hereafter be provided
bylaw?
Nearly all the Republican members of
both houses are with Governor Bradley on
this question, and a goodly number of
Democrats also. The occasion seems op
portune, indeed.
Senator Goebel is President pro tern, of
the Senate, and had the appointing of the
standing committees. His action in this
matter made him friends with the Repub
licans, and he will have no opposition to
his bill from spite. With his accustomed
fairness he gave the Republicans their due
share of positions on important commit
tees and a number of chairmanships.
The Judiciary Committee of the Senate,
.to which the bill was referred, will hardly
meet before Tuesday next. The members
who live witnin reach generally go home
on Saturday to si ay over Sunday and re
turn to Frankfort on Monday. The arrival
of some of the trams on Monday makes it
impossible for anything to be done before
the Legislature meets. So Monday is
always a dull day in the Frankfort Assem
bly. The Senatorial contest, of course,
makes things more lively, and few run any
risk of losing a vote.
Senator Goebei always makes sure by
taking the train from Covington to Lex
ington and thence to Frankfort, arriving
a couple of hours earlier than by the direct
route.
On the Judiciary Committee of the
Senate there are: Goebei (D.), Robert
Weissinger (D.), George S. Fulton (D.),
Judge John J. Landes (R.), Fenton Sims
(D.), Charles J. Bronstou (D.), Judge
John Bennett (R.).
Senator Fulton is a good man and he is
the chairman of the Committee on Rail
roads.
Judge Laudes is a capable lawyer and
a strong man, and besides being on the
Judiciary Committee ia also on that on
Constitutional Amendments, and has the
chairmanship of another committee.
Fenton Sims is a new man from the
southwestern part of the State and is un
derstood to stand for the best interests of
the people.
Messinger is a hold-over from Louis
ville. He is an able lawyer and an expe
rienced man. His brother, H. E. Messin
ger, is connected with the Southern Rail
road and was for three terms president of
ihe Louisville Board of Trade.
Charles J. Bronston is one of the most
eloquent lawyers in the State. He is from
Lexington and served as Prosecuting At-
torney for Fayette County for several
terms and hiis had many a bout wjth the
railroads, as Mr. Huntington has cause to
remember. He placed J. C. S. Blackurn
in nomination to succeed himself as United
States Senator.
Judge John Bennett is one of the moit
able lawyers in the State of Kentucky and
is a good, reliable man in every way. Be
sides being on the Judiciary Committee,
he is the chairman of the Agricultural and
Mechanical College Committee.
The members of, the Judiciary Commit
tee of the House and their political affilia
tion is as follows: M. T. Flippin (R.)
chairman, N. T. Howard (R.), J. H. Rice
(R.), J. B. Coffman (R.), W. H. Lyons
(R.), A. J. Carroll (D.), Nerge Clarke (D.),
J. E. Robbins (D.), M. C. Swinford (D.).
The chairman, judge Flippin, is one of
the best men in the Legislature. Many of
the members of this committee are new
men, and it is hard to say how they stand.
Huntington will doubtless make his
hardest right before this committee. From
the situation, as has been shown, Cali
fornia's opportunity is easily seen. The
' repeal bill wiil certainly not receive a veto
from Governor Bradley.
TO DOUBLE THE CAPITAL
The Standard Oil Trust to Be Re
organized as a Corpo
ration.
Plenty of Watered Stock Will Be at
theÂ« Disposal of the General
Pnblic.
PIT'ISBURG, Pa., Jan. 31.â The Leader
this evening says: The Standard Oil Com
pany is about to reorganize as a corpora
tion and go out of the trust business. The
capital of the new company is to be $200,
--000,000, just twice the capitalization of the
original trust, and so much of the watered
stock the retention of which is not desired
by those on the inside will be open for
purchase by the general public and at
prices as high as the Standard brokers can
put them. The purchase of outstanding
certificates of the Standard, there having
been an advance of $35 a snare within a
month, is being carried on, it is claimed,
to facilitate the plans of the new organiza
tion and to help make a high market price
for the new shares.
Adopting the usual methods of reorgani
zation, the present stockholders would
probably get two shares for one in the
new company, hence the desire to corral
all that can possibly be obtained of the
present certificates. The par value of the
present stock is $100 a share, upon which
dividends of 12 per cent have been paid,
which means an annual distribution of
the enormous sum of $ 12,000,000. ,
Independent of a desire to secure con
tinuance of the enormous profits of the
Standard, and, businesslike, to increase
them, if possible, it is supposed that the
activity of the independent organizations
has emphasized the necessity for a closer
knitting together of all the Standard in
terests.
Hanged With Her Own Hair.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Jan. 3i.â A peculiar
suicide occurred ac the Toledo Hospital for
the Insane yesterday, in which Magdalene
Messner, a melancholy patient from Gib

hair. She was seated in a chair, and in
some manner fastened her long hair to it,
and, leaning forward, succeeded in choK

VILAS ASSAILS
THE BOND BILL
Says It Deserves Its Fate
to Be Strangled by
Silver.
TALKS OF PARTISANSHIP.
And Says the Remedy Offered Is
a Mockery of Legislation
Demanded.
DOES NOT PLEASE DEMOCRATS.
Arguments on the House Measure Con
tinued Into the Night and the
Vote Postponed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31.â The
Senate was called to order at noon, at
which time there was not over a dozen
Senators present.
As to-day's session, through the parlia
mentary device of taking a recess instead
of an adjournment yesterday, the usual
formalities of prayer, reading of the jour
nal, presenting memorials, introducing
bills, and all the other morning business
was dispensed with, and the Senate con
tinued the consideration of the House
bond bill, with the Finance Committee's
free-coinage substitute.
AlJen (Pop.) of Nebraska suggested the
absence of a quorum, but forty-six Sena
tors responded to the call.
Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin addressed the
Senate in opposition both to the bill and
to the substitute.
"It will," said Vilas, "doubtless never
be necessary to discuss this bill as it came
from the House. But it may be said that
it deserves its fateâ strangled by silver. It
was but the fraudulent pretext of response
to the exigency which it professed to meet,
and to the reasonable suggestions of the
President, which it denied while it avowed
their wisdom. With the exception of thn
provision of emergency certificates â which
ought to stand in the permanent statutesâ
the House bill contained nothing com
mendable and everything else was but a
mockery of the legislation demanded by
our financial conditions.
"And so again, as a year aero, partisan
ship or imbecility, or both, has Btricken
Congress with paralysis, and the rescue of
prosperity from its recurring peril has
been thrown upon the executive. It is
almost as fortunate as fortuitous that an old
statute has remained untouched during
our financial madness which can again
serve the turn and, although in a clumsy
way when considered with reference to
existing conditions and suitable measures
of relief, yet it show's tbat God's pity and
mercy are not wholly withdrawn from us.
"If," he continued, "any trusted agent
in private affairs should so deny duty and
abuse a trust as Congress did a year ago
and now repeats, no judgment in their
condemnation would be too severe. Over
$16,000,000 in the public debt was then
thrown away in the reckless rage of parti
sanship, and the injury that must now be
sustained by the people for the same
reason is probably no less, although the
exact measure of it is not quite so clear.
"Then Republican management was
able to show the pretense that except for
the Populists and free silverites there
might have been relief. It was true, then,
that this bill has now unmasked the fact
by denying under Republican dictation
the only remedy available for the increased
mischief."
Declaring that the bill as it came from
the House was a mere sham and fraud,
Vilaa proceeded to Bhow that the Senate
amendments made it worse than the
original measure.
"It was a bad stock," he asserted,
"though it has been budded with a warm
scion. The best hope is that both will
shrivel and die in the desert air of the
Senate."
Yilas proceeded at considerable length
to discuss the free coinage provision of
the pending bill, declaring that the finan
cial distress and public misery for the past
three years were the direct products of the
efforts to force silver upon the country.
"And," he said, "our course of relief ia a
return to sound principles."
He believed especially that every step of
the fatal progress in error had been op
posed to the cardinal doctrines on which
the Democratic party is based, and by
which it must abide or sink in recreancy
while the spirit flies from our institutions
of liberty. He traced the past legislation
in the interest of silver to the theory of
protection, which he characterized as
vicious and wicked. The Senator then
proceeded to a review of silver legislation
and of silver production and silver coinage
in the United States, showing that the
production was small before the silver war.
Of bimetallism he said: "Bimetallism
is a high-sounding, splendid word. If only
bimetallism, but, alas! What is it and
where is it?
Like dreams that wane before the half-shut eye,
Or gay castles In the clouds that pass,
Forever flitting in the aummer sky.
Always dancing before the vision, always
something to be gained, but never realized,
the glittering bauble has flitted on afar be
fore the fortuitous pursuit on which the
public have so long been conducted, yet
always to disappear, save in the pleasing
speech of silver advocates, while the reali
ties of gain could be matched by the other
and mastering purpose."
He declared that from the beginning
practical bimetallism had never been
proposed to Congress. He declared that
Senators Teller and Wolcott, as cham
pions of silver, had based their conten
tions upon a protective foundation.
Vilas' speech was a vivid word picture
of Democracy, menaced on the one hand
by federalism rejuvenated in the Republi
can party and on the other by that "por
tentous cloud of a party never known in
the days of Democratic justice, charged
with wild, fantastic theories of social dis
order, and wilder schemes of remedy,
threatening, should it grow apace, no one
can foretell with what violence or social
tempest,
"This party will continue its great ca
reer, yielding neither on one side nor the
other to the reactionary forces of old abso
lutism or red fires of anarchy."
In the course of the speech a colloquy
sprung up between Viias and Mitchell of
Oregon, the latter a&sertiug that when the
last bond issue was taken by the syndicate
for some $8,000,000 less than it would have
been if the bonds had been made payable
specifically in gold instead of in coin.
there was no justice or fairness in requir
ing the bonds to be paid in gold. And he
declared two or three times that this was,
on the part of the syndicate, a "bunko
game."
This view was repelled by Viias, who de
clared that the lesser price received for
those bonds merely represented the "thin
shade of fear which the debates in Con
gress had given rise to," and that if there
had been any idea that the bonds would
be paid in silver the Government would
not have received for them one-half of the
amount which it did receive.
Tillman (D.) of South Carolina made an
attempt to get into the discussion by ask
ing Viias as to the price of silver in the
open market when those bonds were paid,
but Viias politely though positively de
clined to be diverted from his argument,
and he went on with his speech, the de
livery of which occupied two hours and
three-quarters.
At soon as Viias took his seat notice was
given by Chandler (R.) of New Hamp
shire that at 4 p. M. he would move that
the Senate take a recess until 7:30 p. m.
This notice was followed by a colloquy
among Senators as to an agreement for a
vote on the bill, the upshot of which was
that when the Senate broke up at night it
would take a recess until 11 A. m. to-mor
row, and after Morrill (R.) of Vermont
snail have BDoken the debate shall go on
under the five-minute rule until 2 o'clock,
when the final vote is to be taken. The
agreement was not to exclude the offering
of amendments or a motion to postpone
indefinitely.
Pasco (D.) of Florida then addressed the
Senate in favor of the free coinage substi
tute. He would vote for the substitute in
the hope that the former ratio of 16 to 1
could be returned to with safety. He had
not finished when the hour of 4 o'clock ar
rived, and then under agreement the Sen
ate took a recess until 7:30 p. m.
At the evening session White (D.) of
California supported the fiee-coinage sub
stitute.
The President of the United States, he
said, proposed to retire the greenbacks
and to trust the financial affairs of the
Government to the National Banks. But
whenever the financial affairs of the coun
try were placed in the keeping of National
banks or of any private banking system
free government would cease and delib
erate malfeasance would rule imperiously
and undisputably.
He asserted that the utter futility of
maintaining a gold basis in this country
would give rise to disaster and would
bring about the further concentration of
gold and all the direful consequences of a
congested and inadequate currency.
He could not understand how any fol
lower of Jefferson or of Jackson could
stand the new departure on which the ad- |
ministration insisted. He thought a ma
jority of Senators were opposed to issuing
bonds at all. The general sentiment of
the country was that gold, obtained either I
as the result of taxation or the issuance of
bonds, was not needed. But if there was
to be a gold standard, and if silver was to
be further debased, then Mr. Cleveland
was right.
He should have authority to issue gold
bonds, and should retire all greenbacks
and Sherman notes, and the crisis wouid
then be reached.
He declared that it was not the aim of
silver advocates to force silver on the
Government creditors, but they believed
the debtor had also some rights. And the
time must come, he declared, when the
Government will take control of the mat
ter and will refuse to subject itself to the
public and private demands of those
whose impudent dictation it now tolerates.
At the cJose of White's speech, the
Senate at 10 p. m. took a recess until 11
a. m. to-morrow.

District of Columbia.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31.â The
House to-day in committee of the whole
entered upon the consideration of the bill
making appropriations for the District of
Columbia for the year ending June 30,
1897, and after acting on some of its
schedules the committee rose and the
House took a recess until 8 o'clock, for the

sumed in filibustering by the opposition.
MOPING -FOB A. SETTLEMENT.
The State Department Expect* That Waller
mil Be Released.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31.-It is
understood that the State Department is
only delaying its transmission to Congress
of the documents in the case of ex-United
States Consul Waller of Madagascar, now
imprisoned in France, pending negoti
ations still proceeding, by wkicb it- hopes
to be able to announce the release of
Waller from prison.
Developments are daily expected in the
negotiations, and probably, unless Waller's
release is shortly secured," the correspond
ence will go to the House of Representa
tives. The objection to that course is said
tooea desire that the friendly relations so
long subsisting between the United States
ana the French republic should not be
even temporarily interrupted.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31.-Bent

Secretary Olney to-day and presented to
him a long cablegram from John Hays
Hammond (now in jail at Pretoria
I charged with sedition and treason), pre !
senting Hammond's position in ' the"

ers.
Secretary Olney told Senator Jones that
the United States Government was doing
all that could be done to protect the in
terests of Hammond and other Americans
in the Transvaal, and would not relin
quish its efforts in their behalf.
Neither Mr. Olney nor Benator Jones
would talk about the matter, but it is said
that both are of the opinion that Ham
mond's sentiments as expressed in the
cablegram are exceedingly injudicious
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 31.-The Times
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Pretoria, the capital of the South African
Republic, saying that in an interview
President Krueger stated that before the
outbreak ho had been meditating how the
wishes of the Uitlanders could be best met.
He hoped that soon acceptable measures
in the matter of education and local auto
nomy for Johannesburg would be adopted.
He could not promise anything relative to
granting the franchise. The Government
must ascertain which were the loyal ele
ments among the Uitlanders. The fran
chise could not be given to every new
comer. They arrived by thousands yearly
and would soon swamp the original popu
lation.
Cecil J. Rnodes, ex-Premier of Cape
Colony, has arrived at the island of Ma
deira. It transpires that the reports that
he will plead that he was ignorant of the
position of Dr. Jameson in the Transvaal
are unfounded. Rhodes has telegraphed
a statement of the events leading to Dr.
Jameson's raid to his London solicitors, to
be used as evidence in Jameson's defense
when the latter's trial comes off.

THE GALLOWS
Lloyd Montgomery Admits
That He Took Three
Lives.
EXECUTED AT ALBANY.
He Appeals for Future Mercy
While in the Shadow of
Death.
A BRUTAL CRIME AVENGED.
The Youth Had Slain His Parents and
a Visitor Because of a Re
proof.
ALBANY, Or., Jan. 31.â Lloyd Mont
gomery, the murderer of his parents and
Daniel McKercher at Brownsville last No
vember, paid the penalty of his crime on
the gallows here to-day. His execution
occurred shortly after 7 o'clock this morn
ing.
Nothing of importance had happened
during the early part of the night. At 1
o'clock the Sheriff asked Mongomery if he
dia not want a nap, when he lay down
and was almost instantly asleep. He slept
until 4 o'clock, when he was awakened by
the Sheriff with difficulty. So sound were
his slumbers that it was necessary to raise
him up before he could be raaue to under-
Ftand what was desired. Then prepara
tions began for his long journey.
Among the early callers was Rev. Mr.
Shultz of Shedd, who talked and prayed
with him fervently. To him the boy in
sisted that the McKercher version was
correct; that he killed McKercher after
the latter had killed his mother and
father. Mr. Shultz believed that he had
kept the fact in his mind so much as to
have become convinced of Its truth. Mont
gomery declared that he believed he was
saved.
A new suit of clothes was put on him
and he was ready for the gallows by 6
o'clock. A half hour before the time set
for the execution Joseph Hume, brother
in-law of the Sheriff of Brownsville and a
neighbor of the boy, went to him in his
cell. He sat down beside him and placed
his hand on his shoulder and cried out,
"0 Lloyd, Lloyd, Lloyd!" and then he
prayed as few men ever pray â a prayer
from the soul, which made a deep impres
sion on those who heard him and wit
nessed the scene.
Hume told the boy impressively that he
was in no condition to meet his God with
out mating a complete confession of the i
crime, and must not die with a lie on his
, lips. The words seemed to impress Mont
\ pomery and in a few words he admitted j
his guilt â that he had killed ail three, his
father, mother and Daniel McKercher.
In the confession he gave no details, but j
uhey were not necessary. At his own de- â 
sire he wrote the confession of his guilt
and signed it as follows:
I did it ; lam guilty. O God, have mercy on
me! Take me as I am, a poor sinner. I am
sorry for what I have done. God, do have !
mercy on a poor soul ; for my sake do, and for
give all my sins, and each and every one of
them, and forgive those who sin against thee.
O God, help more precious souls to seek the j
ways of life; for my sake do help them and ;
. guide them through this life. Amen.
Lloyd Montgomery.
A jury of twelve men was called into the :
jail, and the death warrant was read to !
the" condemned man in their presence. At i
7:05 o'clock the prisoner, with the Sheriff, ,
deputies and Rev. Messrs. Shultz, Snyder ''
and Little, marched through the residence- !
rooms of the Sheriff directly upon the !
scaffold. The murderer took his place upon >
the trap, with great coolness and nerve, !
and, in a strong voice, though somewhat
husky, said:
"I am sorry for what I have done. I
hope yon forgive me. I want God to have
mercy on me, a poor sinner."
Then Rev. Mr. Snyder of Brownsville !
stepped forward and prayed for the man
on the trap, and that the end of his life
should be an awful example to the rising !
generation. The prayer was somewhat i
long, but it did not seem to disturb the '
one most interested. He coolly raised his
head and looked at the rope above him
and at the lever on the side. At his re
quest he was shown a model of the scaffold
about 5 o'clock and was familiar with its i
make-up. Then he coolly viewed the au- '<
dience, but nevertheless there was a slight
nervousness he could not conceal. At the
end of the prayer the Sheriff placed the
black cap upon his head, when Mont
gomery again cried out: >
â 'Good-by, friends, I hope to meet you
in heaven. I ask God to take a poor
sinner."
The noose was placed over his head by
the Sheriff and his deputy, Q. E. Propst, i
and drawn tightly' to his neck. Three
strans were around his arms and legs. The
knot had been tied by the Sheriff and
deputy. While this was being done the
prisoner cried :
"God, have mercy on me, a sinner! Take
me as I am!"
As it was completed he, for the fourth
time, spoke: ,
"Kind friends, farewell, farewell."
The last word was uttered as the Sheriff
stepped upon the lever .and * Lloyd Mont- !
gomery fell six feet. * Dr. Starr I felt : his
pulse and Drs. Ellis and ' Davis : his heart
and Dr. Mason held a watch. The beats
were normal at first and; then rapidly in
creased. At four minutes the rate was 173
a minute; then they gradually decreased,
at six minutes were 126, at eight minutes
85, with very little pulse, at nine no pulse,'
at ten oniy a flutter, at eleven an uncertain
sound, at twelve minutes a slight move
mr-nt, which was felt up to fourteen min
utes. At fourteen and a half minutes he
" M pronounced dead. His neck had been
broken.
The execution was well arranged and
carried out. The absence of any slip or
repulsive exhibition was commendable.
About fifty men witnessed the hanging, j
Among them were a number of strangers,"
Sheriffs from other counties.' John Me-
K-ercher, brother of one of ; tb'e murdered
nien, witnessed the execution. He wore a
band of crape around his hal McKercber
watched the proceedings without any
demonstration, but with apparent satis
faction, and when the rope was cut he was ,
2norfÂ°Ji, U ,f first to secure a piece, and a

The body was taken. down, laced on a .
litter and left in the Courthouse tor public
inspection, many passing in to view the
face of the perpetrator of one of the most
coldblooded murders in the history of the
Pacific Coast.
Last night Montgomery wrote a long let
ter to his brothers and sisters, advising
them to join the church and lead a Chris
tian life.
Parricide is the crime for which Lloyd
Montgomery was hanged to-day. He
killed his father and mother and Daniel
McKercher at his home, three miles from
Brownsville, last November. The mur
ders were committed in broad daylight,
and at first baffled investigation, because
no motive could be discovered.
Considering the circumstances, Lloyd
Montgomery's triple killing was among
the most fearful crimes ever recorded in
the annals of the Northwest. An ignorant,
vicious, overgrown son of a farmer, hav
ing spent all his life in the peaceful pur
suit of farming, it was probably due to
nothing but the 6udden awakening of
hereditary criminal instincts within him
that led him to do murder.
His crime was a*uickiy found out, for he
did not possess intelligence enough to
maintain the bold face of indifference he
first put on. This case is a wonderful one
as revealing what a bloodthirsty monster
young Montgomery became in crime.
McKercher tailed at the Montgomery
farm on business, and was at the front
yard fence talking to the elder Mont
gomery when Lloyd returned home from
squirrel hunting. He walked out to
where his father was talking to Mc-
Kercber. His father asked him to get
him a drink of water. The son replied in
an impudent tone, and the father slapped
him. Previously his mother had asked
him to get her some wood.
The insult before McKercher was too
much for the son to stand. He ran around
the house, got nis rifle and began shoot
ing. He shot his father, then McKercher
and finally his mother, who pleaded in
vain for her life. The murderer left his
rifle lying across McKercher's body, evi
dently for the purpose of conveying the
impression that McKercher had done the
killing and then had shot himself.
After the slaughter of his parents and
McKercher Lloyd claimed not to know
anything about it. Then he decided to
confess to having killed McKercher to
avenge the death of his father and mother.
The murderer said that McKercher called
on his father for a bill which he owed :
they had quarreled and McKercher had
killed both his parents. He, arriving just
In time to discover the murder, shot Mc-
Kercher.
To-day Montgomery confessed to having
killed all three in a fit of anger. Very
little remorse or sincere grief has ever I
been manifested during his confinement
for his act.
The coolness and promptness with which
the officers acted after the Coroner's jury
had returned its verdict, to the effect that !
the three persons had come to their death
at the hands of Lloyd Montgomery, saved
the young man's neck for the gallows in
stead of an improvised noose of a Browns
ville mob. The murderer was removed to j
Albany for safe-keeping. Since being con- [
fined here in jail, until to-day, he had
denied a previous confession of the crime,
always reverting to the original story that
he kiiled McKercher.
He had supplemented his original story \
with certain embellishments that seemed j
at times to show that the murderer was
proud of his bloody record and had as
little regard for his own words and actions
as he did for human life. Even his rela
tives never saw him excepting at the trial. I
It was thought for a time that Mont
gomery was insane, and Judge Burnett
had a commission appointed for the pur
pose of examing him. The doctors found
that he was sane, and if the prisoner had
manifested any symptoms of insanity they
were only temporary.
HE HATEO ALL, MJLXKIXD.
' Murderer Aeitnu*. a Hunchback, Hanged
at Kalama.
KALAMA, Wash., Jan. 31.â Charles
Asimus was executed this morning for the
murder of James Greenwood at Fowler
ranch, three miies west of JÂ£elso, on Sep
tember 21, 1895.
Asimus spent a restless night, all his
efforts to woo slumber failing. A number
of times the condemned man lay down,
but after a few moments of quiet he would
spring to his feet and pace the floor of his
cell. As morning drew on his nervous
ness increased, his only relief seeming to j
be in listening to the death-watch read or |
talk.
Shortly after 9 o'clock Sheriff Watson
entered the cell and read the death war
rant, Asimus trembling perceptibly dur
ing the reading. As the Sneriff folded the
warrant the murderer was told to stand up
and prepare for the march to the scaffold, j
Asimus made an attempt to rise, but
weakly sank back, covering his face with
his hands. Sheriff Watson, placing his j
hand on the shoulder of the doomed man, I
spoke a few kind words, and, thus en
couraged, Asimus managed to gain his
feet.
Passing out of the Courthouse into the
bright daylight of the yard Asimus' eyes
rested upon the gallows. At this sight his
strength forsook him for a moment, but
helped by the attendants he was placed in
"-position on the drop. While the deputies
were strapping his arms and legs and ad
justing the noose Asimus, in a quavering
voice, began to make a speech, his words
being hesitating and disconnected.
"I suppose everybody here must die,"
he began. "I must die. I'm all right.
The Sheriff, he good man. One bad man, j
I must die."
He hesitated and then said: "I do bad
thing. I must die. I'm all right."
His voice here failed him. The black
cap was drawn over his head, and at 9:32
Sheriff Watson touched the lever, the
body falling: nine feet. At 9:47 he was pro
nounced dead.
Asimus was a hunchback, and when
first confined was in a deplorable condi
i tion physically and steadily grew worse.
j He once tried to commit suicide by open
i ing the arteries of his arm with the wire
points of his shoestring.
He was discovered after he had become
unconscious from loss of bJood and was
brought back to life by physicians. After
his arrest he tooic a very gloomy view of
his plight. He would say:
"I am nothing but a hunchback and
every one is against me."
The fact that he was a cripple and had
had many reverses seemed to have embit
tered him, and he felt as though the whole
world had turned against him.
Asimus was about 38 years of age. He
was born in Germany, where he lived
j until grpwn. He claimed his deformity
was due to an accident which happened
when- he was 15 years of age. He was
carrying a heavy sack of potatoes up
some stone steps, when he slipped and fell
in 3uch a manner as to injure his spine.
His father refused to have his injuries
properiy cared for, saying that he was only
a trifling boy and not worth the expense.
Asimus' back always gave him much puin,
subjecting him to extreme nervous spells.
His misfortune embittered the hunch
back, and he looked upon the world as
his enemy. He was at war with all man
kind, and the taunts of the small boy and
the pitying glace of an older person alike
stung him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1. 1896.
ACQUITTED AT
SACRAMENTO
William C. Christ Found
Not Guilty of Wife
Murder.
VERDICT SOON REACHED.
Exonerated by the Twelve Men
After Deliberation of Seven
Minutes.
COURT SPECTATORS PLEASED.
The Accused Man's Pitiful Story
Outweighed the Arguments of
Counsel.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 31.â 1t took
just seven minutes for the jury in the
William C. Christ murder case to bring in
a verdict exonerating the accused man,
and it is said that nine-tenths of the resi
dents of Sacramento heartily indorse this
verdict, while the rest deplore it only on
the ground that it sets a bad precedent for
the future. .
The plain, pathetic story of his married
life, as narrated on the stand yesterday by
the prisoner, produced an impression upon
the minds of the twelve men at whose
hands his fate was pending that the able
arguments of District Attorney Ryan
could not remove. His story was further
strengthened by the straightforward an
swers during the cross-examinations to
which he was subjected by the District
Attorney.
During portions of Attorney for De
fense Hiram Johnson's plea one could
see scarcely a dry eye in the audience, and
when he referred to the happy life William
Christ had led with his wife prior to the
{ information he received of her infidelity,
i the prisoner broke down and resting his
head on the table before him sobbed
aloud.
The scene when the verdict was an
nounced was almost indiscribable. Seven
! minutes after the jury was sent to the
jury-room Judge Hinkson ascended the
bench and the jury was seen returning
down the corridor. There was an excited
murmur of the word "guilty," for the
I spectators could construe the quick return
|of the jury as meaning nothing else. The
slip of paper containing the verdict was
inspected by the Judge and handed back
to the foreman.
"Read the verdict, Mr. Foreman," said
â  his Honor, and the foreman uttered these
I words: "Not guilty."
The acquitted man sprang to his feet, but
his attorney seized him and forced him
back into his seat. Notwithstanding the
severe warning against any demonstration
previously given by the court the specta
tors burst into a shout of satisfaction.
On the morning of the 14th day of last '
October Mrs. Frances E. Hart, having
found in her husband's Docket some letters
and poetry addressed to him by Mrs. j
Christ, in an insane fit of jealousy took I
them to the barber-shop, where William
Christ was employed, and calling him out |
handed the epistles to him.
At first, so absolute was the barber's
faith in the love and fidelity of his wife, I
that he laughed over the matter, but cvi- '
dently he allowed his mind to dwell on i
the subject until his suspicions became I
aroused, as later in the day he called at
Mrs. Hart's residence and talked over the
matter with her.
On returning home in the evening he
ate supper and then entered the sitting
room, with hi 3 wife, where he taxed her
with her alleged infidelity. The testi
mony shows that the woman laughed in
his face and asked him what he was
going to do about it.
What then occurred will never be
known, but a pistol-shot rang out, and
when the neighbors entered the house
Mrs. Christ lay at full length upon the
carpeted floor, with a ghastly wound in
her head near her right temple, dead.

BOLD ALASKA SMUGGLERS
Liquor Is Landed at Juneau in
Spite of the Revenue
Officers.
The Steamer Lone Fisherman Seized
for Ferrying Without a
License.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 31.-
Despite of all denials from Alaska the in
troduction at Juneau of spirituous liquors
into the Territory goes merrily on. Re
cently two boatloads were being landed in
the darkness from a steamer. The surf
was running high and one of the boats was
overturned. The occupants narrowly es
caped with their lives and eight or ten
kegs of liquor drifted ashore. These were
gathered up and placed on the wharf, but
the customs officials were absent and a
raid was made by the saloon men, who
captured the entire lot.
The Topeka, arriving to-day, reports the
seizure of the steamer Lone Fisherman.
This vessel has a bad reputation qn Pupet
Sound, haying been captured in 1888
for smuggling. It had been recently re
fitted at great cost at Juneau: It hapoened
the weather was so rough as to preclude
the regular trips of the ferry-boat between
Juneau and Douglas Isiand. Imperative
business made communication necessary
and the Lone Fisherman was pressed into
service. The vessel had not been regis
tered at the Custom-house, and for this
the cutter Wolcott seized it. It is said
that the customs officer at Juneau has been
absent from his post for some time, and
for this reason alone the license was not
issued.
Alaska at the present time is practically
without Government officials in the judxei
ary. By leave of absence both Commis
sioner Roeers of Sitka and Commissioner
Mellin of Juneau are absent.
The United States cutter Corwm, at pres
ent undergoing repairs here, has received
orders to relieve the Wolcott, now at
Juneau, as soon as possible. The latter
vessel is in need of immediate repairs.
Captain D. F. Tosier of the United States
cutter Grant has received orders to assume
command of the fleet of revenue launches
now nearing completion at a local .ship
yard. Captain Jefferson Slamm will buc
ceed to the command on the Grant.
CUYAMACA ROUTE CHANGE. {}
Two Plans for an Extension of the Rail
road Are Being Considered by
the Directorate.
SAN DIEGO, Cat,., Jan. 31.â According
to a statement made a Cuyamaca official
to-day the change in the route of that road
may be much more important than here
tofore reported.
Instead of continuing from Lemon
Grove northward through La Mesa colony
the road may be changed and run from
Lemon Grove east and southward through
Spring Valley, thence to Jamacha, Davis
ton and into El Cajon. passing through
Bostonia and thence down through the
center of the valley to a connection with
the present Cuyamaca line near Santee.
The alternative of this plan is to con
tinue as at present through La Mesa to
and through Eucalyptus Pass, but at that
point to divert southward from the pres
ent route through the Marshall place to
Bostonia and thence down the center of
El Cajon Valley.
These changes are under consideration.
On Monday Vice-President Hickman will
go out to open negotiations for rights of
way, and the securing of the right of way
will determine which of the two plans
shall be adopted.
The adoption of the line through Bpring
Valley will cost in construction about $50,
--000, but it will tap a big area of new coun
try and increase tne business of the road.
Whatever change is made, the present
trackage will not be abandoned.
The company is still at work reducing the
grade between Sixteenth and Twenty-sec
ond streets. The next change of grade
will be across Chollar Valley at Gregory
I Springs, and there is prospects that the
change there will be in the form of a high
trestle across the valley.
The Cuyamaca is being made good
enough for a terminus to a transconti
nental line. One of the highest officials of
j the road was asked to deny the report that
! the Southern Pacific had a bond on the
Cuyamaca, and lie refused to do so.

Adversely.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 31.â Judge Rey
nolds to-day denied the petition of Ellen
E. Bailey to have a portion of the estate left
by her husband set aside as a homestead.

valued at $16,000. There are rive children,
and by the terms of the will the widow was
given only a life interest in the estate.
Judge Reynolds, in denying the petition,

stead she should have applied for it at the
time she was appointed executrix, and not
waited twelve years.

JUDGE PEERY
DIES AT PHÅNIX
A Suicide's Bullet Ends the
Invalid Capitalist's
Existence.
SUFFERED FROM DROPSY.
Resolved to Anticipate a Slow
Death by One More
Speedy.
LATELY RESIDED IN SAN DIEGO
He Had Vacated a Seat on the Missouri
Bench to Seek for Health on
This Coast.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Jan. 31. â Judge
Stephen Peery, late of Sap Diego, com
mitted suicide this afternoon by shooting
himself through the heart. Illness that
bid fair to end his life shortly is believed
to have actuated him to anticipate a lin
gering death by one more speedy.
Judge Peery was a native of Virginia
and removeu to Missouri some time before
the war. He settled at Trenton and iden
tified himself with J. H. Shanklin, one of
the ablest financiers Missouri ever knew.
This firm did much toward raisine money
to build the Missouri Pacific into Kansas
City when the funds of the company hav
ing the project in charge gave out.
He was a lifelong Republican and well
known in that party's councils in Missouri,
and this, coupled witn his legal ability,
resulted in his election to the bench at
Trenton when that city went Republican
some years ago. During his incumbency
he became afflicted with dropsy and
resigned >i*s position so that he might
remove to warmer climate.
His sear h for health led him to seek
Southern .aliforuia, and he settled in San
Diego about three years ago. Immediately
after taking up his residence tnere he com
menced investing, and at the time of hia
death he had large interests in which much
money is invested. He was also largely in
terested in Phoenix realty, his nephew, J.
W. Walker, acting as his aeent, having in
vested over $250,000, in irrigation and
kindiect enterprises.
It was this outlay, coupled with the fact
that the climate of San Diego had failed to
relieve him, that led Judge Peery to visit
Phoenix some months ago. Here he
steadily grew worse, until to-day he ended
his suffering.
That his act had been well planned was
best evidenced by its careful execution.
About 2 o'clock he sept the nurse out of
the room to get something and then re
quested his wife to leave.
They both complied and a few moments
later were startled by the report of a re
volver. They rushed in, to find the in
valid already dead, having shot himself
through the heart with a bullet from a 38
--caliber Smith <fc Wesson.
Judge Peery was 58 years of age and
leaves a widow and three children.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 31.â Judge
Stephen Peery, who committed suicide at
Phoenix to-day, was the father of Herbert,
Bessie and Hortense Peery of this city. He
event to Phoenix six months ago for his
health, and was accompanied by his wife. !
Judge Peery had been a resident of this
;ity for two years.
He formerly lived at Trenton, Grundy
County, Mo., where he was a leading
iawyer and a prominent and wealthy citi
ien. Besides his children here he'loavcs
two other daughters, Miss June, now a
student at Stanford University, and Mrs.
S'ellie Price, a resident of Elkado, lowa.
The deceased was a brother-in-law of '
Judge E. W. Dendrick and Mrs. Mary E. !
SValker of this city. Judge Peery's body
will brobabiy be taken to his old home for
interment in the family burying-jjround.
BIT XEW MEXICO'S OOTERSOR.
Charges Against Hevnnuc Collector Shan
non filed at Washington.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Jan. 31.â According
j to private advices from persons hish in
| authority, received here to-dny, Hon.
| Charles M. Shannon, Democratic Na-
I tional Comrnitteeman for Arizona and In
| ternal Revenue Collector for the District
I of Arizona and New Mexico, may in the
j next few days lose his official head.
Since his appointment to the office of
National committeeman Mr. Shannon,
who is well known throughout the West,
has been charged by the Governor Hughes
faction with party indiscretions, and he
was accused or having dictated press dis
patches attacking the executive.
When he took up his residence in Santa
: Fe, soon after his appointment as Internal
Revenue Collector, he commenced fight
ing Governor Thornton of New Mexico.
As a result of this he and Thornton quar
reled in a Santa Fe saloon a few weeks
ago, and it is claimed that during the
j ensuing altercation Shannon knocked the
! Governor down. This angered the friends
of Governor Thornton, and the altercation
is made the basis of charges recently filed
with the Inferior Department.
HOLD-UP NEAR STOCKTON
Farmer Goodman Contributes to
the Exchequer of a
Road Agent.
Halted and Robbed of Cash and a Gold
Watch in the Outskirts
of the City.
STOCKTON. Cal., Jan. 31.â A daring
hold-up occurred this evening on the
French Camp toll-road, just outside the
city limits. Benjamin Goodman, a well
known farmer residing near French Camp,
was halted by a masked man and com
pelled to turn over his money and valua
bles. The robber leveled a revolver at
Goodman and commanded him first to
dismount and then ordered him to turn
his pockets ont for inspection.
About f4O in gold and silver coin and a
gold watch and other valuables was the
booty secured by the road agent. When
once satisfied that he had all the money in
Goodman's possession he told the farmer
to climb back into the wagon aud drive
ahead as fast as possible, and that if he
looked back he would catch a large-sized
bullet.
Goodman drove on to French Camp sta
tion at a lively speed and from there tele
phoned to the|authorities in this city the
facts of his adventure. The manner in
which the bandit performed his part of
the affair leads the officers to believe that
it was the work of a professional.
PORT MOODY'S MADMAN.
Armed With a Shotgun, a Maniac Terrorizes
the Inhabitants and Evades
Capture.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Jan. 3Lâ A mad
man at Port Moody is causing residents of
that hamlet a great deal of excitement.
He is armed with adouble-barreled shot
gun and will allow no one near him. He
goes into stores, takes what he wants and
then retreats to his cabin, which is strongly
barricaaed. He is always ready to tight
and has plenty of ammunition.
Ten men have tried to capture the
maniac so far unsuccessfully. His name
is Wilson. He has been in an asylum be

TEBTIXG A. SAJVTA. CRUZ LAW.
Wheelman. Martin Will Try Conclusions
With a Ilicycle Ordinance.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 31.â The
question of the validity of a city ordinance
prohibiting the ridine of bicycles on the
sidewalk came before the Superior Court
to-day on a writ of habeas corpus.
Benjamin Martin, Deputy County Clerk,
was arrested on complaint of Councilman
Jflaher this afternoon. Netherton and
Maguire, his attorneys, advised Martin to
plead guilty and stipulate that, for the
purpose of testing the validity of the ordi
nance, the court impose, in addition to a
tine, an imprisonment sentence of tnirty
minutes.
The time was so fixed merely to cover
the clause of the ordinance providing an
imprisonment penalty. The case will be
heard on Monday, and appealed, simply
for the purpose of settling whether the
ordinance shall conform to the city char
ter, which prohibits the double penalty of
fine and imprisonmeni.

Meserve has many friends.
SUFFERING ON THE YUKON
Miners Attempt to Leave Seward
City in Open Boats for
Juneau.
One Party Is Picked Up Half Fam
ished, but the Others Have Not
P;en Sighted.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 31.â 1t
is reported authoritatively that much
hardship is being undergone by those win
tering on the Yukon. The little steamer
Rustler recently picked up thirteen men
in an open boat on the way to Juneau.
They had been on the water two days
without provisions and weid nearly dead
from hunger, cold and exposure. When
the Rustler came alongside the crowd
sprang aboard of her like a flock of sheep
trying to escape.
Before turning back the Yukoners were
landed in the cove, to remain there until
the Rustler returned to take them to their
destination. The Yukoners were weli
equipped and will fare well while en
camped on the beach. It was learned
from them that operations at the
Bear mine had closed down for
lack of water - power, and about
fifty workmen had left Seward City in
four open boats and struck out for Juneau.
They had become separated, and ihe boat
picked up by the Rustler had long before
lost sight of the others. Serious doubts as
to their safety are now held, as the ele
ments have been unusually fierce and they
have not yet put in an appearance. The
Rustler has now gone to pick up the cast
aways.
MAGUIRE THROWS
REDHOT SHOT,
Continued from First Page.
States Supreme Court against the Govern
ment in the ninety-eighth United States
reports.
Maguire denied that that decision had
any such effect, and a long colloquy en
sued on the question. Maguire said that
the refunding plan, being rejected as im
practicable and unwise, three courses re
mained open to the Government: First,
foreclosure and sale of the roads to who
ever will buy them, as property of other
debtors is sold to satisfy similar debts;
second, the purchase and operation of
roads by the Government, as railroads
are owned and operated by other Govern
ments; third, purchase of the roads by the
Government at their present value and
their maintenance by the Government as
a continuous public highway from Omaha
to San Francisco, over which trains of all
companies may be operated under Govern
ment direction in free competition for the
freight and passenger traffic of the Pacific
Coast, thus at one stroke closing this
vexaiious railroad problem, forever doing
away with monopoly in railroad transpor
tation in that region at least, and avoiding
evils that are incident to the operation of
railroads by the Government.
"This is," he continued, "I think, by far
the best plan. It could be established
without difficulty and without loss to the
Government, and the Government, after
having taken the roads at a maximum es
timate of their value, at the foreclosure of
the same, would be perfectly free to pur
sue its remedies against the fraudulent
stockholders and directors of the com
panies."
The foregoing is a summary of the prin
cipal parts of a three-hour argument, in
which there were numerous interruptions
and sharp discussion. Upon the whole the
speech was very well received by the com
mittee, and it is noticed that arguments
against refunding are receiving more at
tention and apparently more earnest con
sideration by the members of the commit
tee than have heretofore been given.
At the close of Maguire's argument a
sub-committee was appointed to examine
and report the question raised by Ma^uire
as to the priority of the so-called first
mortgage bonds.
Representatives Bowers. Hilborn, Mc-
Lachlan and ex-Representative Geary
were in attendance to-day.
RUN DOWN BY
A NEEDLES MAN
Murderer Moran Captured
After a Six Years'
Search.
NOW IN A PENITENTIARY
Convicted and Sentenced for the
Killing of a Vancouver
Soldier.
HAD LONG EVADED CAPTTJBE.
When Pursuit Had been Abandoned
a Californian Caused the Fugi
tive's Arrest.
PORTLAND, Ob., Jan. 31.â 8heriff Mil
ler of Vancouver, Wash., passed through
here to-night for the Walla Walla peniten
tiary, having in charge T. D. Moran, sen
tenced to twenty years' imprisonment and
a fine of $5000 for a murder committed six
years ago.
On the night of December 3, 1889, Moran
came to Vancouver from a logging camp
and got drunk in a dancehouae. He there
picked a quarrel with one "Big" Mc-
Carthy. In his drunken frenzy Moran
mistook a discharged soldier, John Wil
son, for McCarthy and stabbed him to
death. The bloody deed sobered him at
once, and realizing his fatal mistake he
escaped, while eye-witnesses were tempo
rarily paralyzed with horror.
A large reward was offered for Moran's
apprehension, but after months of unsuc
cessful search for him It was abondoned.
Nothing more was thought of Moran
until in the early part of October last.
Then the Chief of Police at Vancouver re
ceived a letter from Needles, Cal., written
by a former soldier at Vancouver Barracks,
asking if there was yet a reward for the
capture of Moran. Receiving an affirma
tive reply the soldier again wrote that he
knew Moran to be in the same town with
him. When an officer reached there the
murderer was gone.
He was tracked to El Paso, Tex., how
ever, and arrested there on October 23.
Sheriff Miller broueht Moran back to Van
couver in November, and the fugitive was
convicted of manslaughter.
Moran says that the six years he was at
liberty were years of torture. Every
stranger who glared at him he suspected
of being a detective. He claims to have a
wife and three children in Texas, but he
has neither written nor received a letter
since his return, and his statement is
doubted.

CLOVERDALE'S
FAIR CLOSES
With Music and Dancing
the Carnival Passes
Into History.
GEORGE BAER'S SPEECH.
Visitors Urged to Profit by Their
View of Sonoma County's
Wealth.
PREMIUMS AEE DISTRIBUTED.
Exhibitors Express Satisfaction at
the Good Judgment of the
Committee.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Jan. 31.â Music by
braFS bands, speech-making and toasts by
leading Sonoma County citizens, and a
proat crush of people, were features at tl.e
Citrus Fair this evening. This was the
closing night and one and all were bent
upon getting a last lingering glance at the
rich array of Sonoma's golden fruits.
This was a gala day for Cloverdale.
Every incoming train broucht hundreJs of
visitors from within a radius of 100 miles.
The streets bore a metropolitan appear
ance, and hotel accommodations to-night
were at a premium. The revelry began
with the arrival of the Ukiah concert band
on the early train, accompanied by many
of Mendocino County's residents. An im
promptu procession wa3 formed at the
depot, and, led by the Cloverdale and Ukiah
bands playing popular tunes of the day,
inarched to the pavilion. This was re
peated as the several trains rolled in.
Ukiahs concert band was heard to good
advantage this afternoon and evening. Its
efficient rendition established the organi
sation among the amateur leaders. The an
nouncement of awards was made this after
noon, much satisfaction being shown on
all sides at the good judgment of the
awarding committee. The judges were:
Editor R. A. Thompson of the Sonoma
Democrat, Santa Rosa; G. N. Whittaker

One of the features of the" evening's en
tertainment was the address of George B.
Baer, secretary of the Citrus Fair Associa
tion. He was frequently applauded. Said
the secretary:
This grand display of citrus fruits, more for
cible than argument, again convinces of the
great possibilities of this climate. These an
nual exhibitions are not given as idle or vain
shows. We have not yet sufficiently advanced
to supply any extensive market. The main
object of all this gorgeous arrangement is to
convince oue another of the adaptability of soil
and climate.
The great question among the tillers of the
soil is, "What branch of culture shall I engage
in?" When the Supreme Architect of the uni
verse made man he was endowed with certain
faculties of sense, and one of the most impor
tant was the sense of seeing, for by Fight we
note the signs around usâ the object lessons of
nature. Behold this golden displayâ an object
lesson to the tiller of the soil ! All these citrus
fruits with one voice proclaim, "We are glad to
find this genial climate and nourishine -oil;
glad to find energetic hands to give us care
and protection and :n return for your kind
treatment we will gladden your homes, en
lighten your minds and bring wealth to your
lands. "
In looking backward, well I remember that
only a few years ago there were these who,
rather than encourage the orange movement,
had no hesitation in pronouncing their lack of
faith. Would yon believe tne south, which
bes already gained its reputation, had the
same difficulties to overcome? Allow me to
read only a sentence from the address of a
prominent orange-grower in Riverside:
"Who can look buck without a smile upon
the best oranges of whicn we boasted fourteen
years ago? .Â«our, dry, light, insipid, thick
skinned and dirty, they were only oranges in
name. To-day all the conditions are re
versed."
Have you ever heard that same remark made
of Cloverdale oranges years ago? I have; but
who dares to mal.e that assertion now?
My friends, we must see with our eyes
open. Have your mind in a condition that ob
jects you see will leave am impression, and
that impression urge you to activity. Have
your wits about you. In plain terms, "get a
move on yourself'; or, in plainer terms,
"hump yourself," and take advantage of the
opportunities offered youâ or will you leave it
to straugers?
Let me tell you that the orango trees in this
locality are showing more thrift and vigor
than any of our deciduous fruits. What can
be said of the orange also applies to the lemon
and olive. The trees went forth on a time to
anoint a king over them and they said unto
the olive tree, "Keign thou over us." There is
no tree more closely associated with the his
tory and civilization of man. King David
makes it the emblem of prosperity and of the
divine blessingâ a green olive tree in the
house of God. There is no other tree in ail the
immense flora of earth so important to the
human race as the olive tree. Scriutural asso
ciations gjve to it a poetical bearing. "Lo! in
the dove's mouth was an olive branch plucked
off." There is no question as to the olive, ior,
to my mind, the supply will never meet the
demand.
It is â  Italian aphorism to marry ihe olive
and t! i vineâ the oil of joy and wine of re
freshrs'.'Ut. To the wine we owe our present
prosperity. Well I know the feeling toward
wine, and that antipathy is justifiable in many
cases, but we must be reasonable in all things.
The supremo being has seen fit to place in our
hands a two-edged sword, fearful in destruc
tion ; yet sheathed at your side it is a protec
tion and a safeguard. What is more fearful
than the raging conflagration, homes laid in
af hes, all the accumulations of a lifetime in a
few moments laid low; and to bo burned to
death is horrible beyond contemplation. There
is no word in the English language that starts
the blood in your veins to flow and your hearts
to jump as that terrible cry of "I^re!" Yet,
my friends, would you refuse the cheerful
hearth a place in your house? Fire affords us
warmth and comtort, and makes our food more
palatable and nourishing. Have you ever seen
a raging torrent, the flood carrying everything
before it, leaving mm and destruction in its
wake? Well we know that the deluge came,
when it rained forty days p.nd forty nights, yet
though fearful it i 3, would you refuse a thirsty
man a drink of water? So with the wine;
though it may cause some sorrow yet it is a
refreshing drink, and under many conditions
most healthful and invigorating to man.
The speaker alluded to the varied re
sources of Sonoma County and compared
this section to the land of Canaan â a land
of wheat ana barley, of wine and figs and
pomegranates, and of olive oil and honey.
In concluding he praised the directors of
the fair for their able management and
thanked the visitors for lending a hand
toward its success.
The throng of guests lingered in the pa
vilion until a late hour to feast eye and
body and good will prevailed. One band
discoursed lively music in the citrus apart
ment, while in the hall above another
band played inspiring airs and hundreds
of feet kept time to the sweet strains. The
youth and beauty of Sonoma and Mendo
cino counties held full sway there. All
care was banished and King Orange
reigned supreme.
The fourth annual Cloverdale Citrus
Fair has passed into history.
A MARYSVILLE PROTEST.
Resolutions Passed by the Sacra
mento Anti-Debris Asso
ciation.
Government Commission Requested to
Investigate Damage Done to
Rivers.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., Jan. 31.â At a
meeting of the directors of the Anti-Debris
Association of the Sacramento Valley held
in Marysville on Wednesday the following
proceeding were had:
The report made by Professor George
Davidson to the Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco and published in the Ex
aminer of January 17, has been read with
much interest by the directors of this as
sociation, and we are astonished that no
reference has been made therein to the
most important factor in "filling up that
portion of the bay and reducing the tidal
prism" near Goat Island, to wit. hydrau
lic mining.
Regarding the dumping of ballast and
other refuse matter in the bay the report
says :
Your committee recommends that strenuous
efforts be made to prevent the dumping of bal
last aud reiuse from vessels in the Bay of San
Francisco, except at certain specified places
under specified conditions. Your committee
learns that it has become a. custom for
vessels to dump ballast and refuse in the
deep channel near Goat Island. Investi
gations lead your committee to conclude
that the refuse thus dumped is carried by
the strong current of these deep spots
upon the shoaler ground, and very probably it
is in parr added to the shoals near Goat Island;
thus gradually filling up that portion of the bay
and probably reducing the tidal prism.
Your committee, learns that it is the custom
of the State Harbor Commissioners to dump
the refuse from their dredgers in the same
spot, and neceeaarily with the same result.
The committee, therefore, recommend that
all ballast and other refuse from whatever
source be required by law to be dumped upon
the tide lands which are now being filled in,
or which it is proposed to fill in, or thai it be
carried beyond the bar off the entrance to the
bay of San Francisco.
Not one word is said regarding the
cause of the shoaling of the bay, which
has been going on for over thirty years,
and since the advent of hydraulic raining.
We presume Professor Davidson still
holds the opinion he was reported to have
advanced several years ago â that the fill
ing of the great waterway of California
was caused by natural erosion and from
plowed ground, and the tracks of cattle
and sheep being washed into them, not
withstanding the plane of the rivers was
higher than the surrounding country.
The dnmping of all the refuse from all
the vessels entering the harbor of San
Francisco during a whole year will not
contribute as much to the tilling of tne
bay as one day's output from the hydraulic
mines even under the present restrictions
of the Caminetti bill. From the fact that
this report will probably be considered by
the recently appointed tJnited States Com
missioners we, the directors of the Anti-
Debris Association of the Sacramento Val
ley, have adopted the following resolution,
to be presented to Colonel Suter and his
associates:
Rexolnd, That in view of the fact that the
partial rehabilitation of hydraulic mining has,
during the past year, added more debris to
that which had already accumulated in the
beds of the Yuba, Feather and Lower Sacra
mento rivers than in any year since hydraalic
mines were enjoined by the courts', and of
the further fact that the dams built
by the miners for the storage of
debris have giveu away during the
freshets of the past few weeks, we earnestly re
quest the recently appointed United States
Commissioners to visit this vicinity at an early
day and before the high stages of water has
passed, to examine the broken dams and also
the excavations made by the recent flood wa
ters in the accumulations of hydraulic mining
debris in the gulches and ravines which the
miners have averred had become bo consoli
dated by time that it could not be
washed away, that they may be the better
enabled to judge of the feasibility of impound
ing dams tv restrain the former output of the
hydraulic mines, as well as to the prospects of
building dams to enable the hydraulic mines
to add to that which has already almost de
stroyed the navigability of our rivers and
which must ultimately destroy the harbor of
San Francisco.
By order of the board of directors of the
Ant i- Debris Association of the Sacramento
Valley. C. E. Stone, President.
B. F. Walton, Secretary.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
EXAMINERS MEET
AT THE CAPITOL
Vital Issues Passed Upon
by Attorney-General
Fitzgerald.
INVESTMENT OF FUNDS.
He Is Opposed to a Purchase of
Government Bonds by
the State.
CONVICT LABOR COMPETITION.
The Legal Adviser Differs With the
Governor as to the Use of
Napa Brick.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 31.â When
the State Board of Examiners went into
session this afternoon Attorney-General
Fitzgerald expressed himself as unalter
ably opposed to the investing of any State
money in United State bonds when there
were plenty of purchasable county bonds
in California. When Secretary of State
Brown stated that he was unable to obtain
opinions as to the legality of county bonds
tbe Attorney -General said that the matter
would be attended to at once. He also
agreed to render a decision in the Kovalev
reward matter in a very short time.
In speaking of the Code Commission,
Attorney-General Fitzgerald said the con
struction placed on the law bj* the news
papers was amusing. The law did not re
quire the commission to meet here except
Victor D. Dnboce, Lleutenant-Colonel-Elect. First Infantry. N. G. C.
in open session. It could pursue its labors
elsewhere if it wanted to. Mr. Fitzgerald
added, however, that it was proper that
the open sessions should be held at the
capitol.
The bill of Bateman Bros, for work on
the new Union depot in San Francisco
was presented, and as there was some
difference of opinion as to whether the
Board of Harbor Commissioners had
authorized the work, Attorney-General
Fitzgerald recommended that the other
members of the board allow the bill and
he would reject it, at the same time notify
ing Controller Colgan not to issue a
warrant. This would give. an opening for
mandamus proceedings before the Superior
Court.
The matter of brick manufactured at
Napa being sent to San Francisco for use
in erecting the new building of the State
University was introduced, and the Gover
nor was very enthusiastic on the subject.
The Attorney-General, however, did not
agree with him and threw a damper upon
the enthusiam of the board by declaring
that it could not legally be allowed, as it
came directly into competition with free
labor. This decision did not meet with
the ideas of the Governor, who believed
that one State institution should be al
lowed to sell to others its products.
"And vet," said the Attorney-General,
"the State needs $260,000 worth of stone,
and, although Folsom State Prison has ;
any amount of this material for Bale, yet
the contractors are buying outside the
State."
As no different conclusion was reached
the matter was postponed until the plans
for the Affiliated Colleges were taken up.
Then the members of tne board discussed
the matter of place of voting and place of
residence.
"What do you want, Mr. Brown ?"' asked
the Attorney-General.
"Well, I want a residence in Ban Fran
cisco, the same as you have."
"Then you want to get the Legislature to
provide for an office in San Francisco the
same as I have, and get them to oblige you
to attend the Supreme Court when in "ses
sion."
In the matter of the Jordan claim, the
Attorney-General declared strictly against
it. He claimed that the State was under
no legal obligations to pay this claim, and
he for one would not approve it.
BREAKING OF A FLY WHEEL.
Employes of the Bone Works Struck
by Pieces of Iron.
A peculiar accident occurred at the
bone works, near the Six-mile House, at
about 6 o'clock last evening, in which
Peter McAvoy, the engineer, and one of
the Chinese laborers was badly injured.
A large flywheel twenty feet in diameter
had been mounted in the engine-room and
it was being tested. A number of the
employes in the establishment were
standing near the machinery watching the
trial.
The engine was run first at a slow speed,
and then the revolutions were gradually
increased until the great wheel fairly
hummed in its whirling. Suddenly a
loud, ringing metalic report was heard,
and pieces of iron were hurled in every
direction.
McAvoy, who waa standing with his
hand upon the throttle, was struck on the
right thigh and arm with chunks of flying
metal and both limbs were fractured. He
was struck and bruised severely about the
body. Tne Chinaman was hit by a piece
of iron and his leg broken. The rest of tbe
bystanders escaped injury.
The injured men were taken to the City
and County Hospital, where the engi
neer's wounds were attended to. But the
Chinese upon catching sight of the white
aproned nurses of the hospital concluded
that they were going to operate upon him
with knives, and kicked so strongly with
his uninjured leg against being left there
that Jie was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital.
Several months ago an accident oc
curred at the works in which a workman
chewing tobacco in tbe factory spit on a
mass of liquid metal, and it returned the
compliment by exploding and blinding
him, also injuring a companion.
McAvoy is about 60 years of age and has
a family living on Ninth street.
The Chinaman's leg was amputated at
the Receiving Hospital. It is thought
that he will die.
VICTOR D. DUBOCE WINS
Elected Lieutenant-Colonel of the
First Infantry Regi
ment.
Quiet Election in the Fifthâ The
Old Officers Re
elected.
The eiection in the reorganized First In
fantry, N. G. C, last night, was held in
the armory of the old Second Artillery
Regiment on Page street. It resulted in
the choice of Major Victor D. Duboce for
lieutenant-colonel ana for majors Cap
tain J. H. Mangels, Captain Charles Box
ton, formerly of Company C, Second Ar
tilleTy. and Captain Charles L. Tilden,
Company G, First Infantry. The result is
regarded as a victory for the "Nationals,"
and some officers were even ungracious
enough to say that it was in fact a con
test between the "Nationals" and the Na
tional Guard.
Colonel William Macdonald called the
meeting to order, and introduced Major
Dorn. judge advocate on General War
field's staff, aa the presiding officer. The
learned judge advocate had the first op
portunity last evening to make a military
ruling. The question being referred to
him whether newspaper representatives
should be admitted or excluded, he de
cided in favor of exclusion.
It was ascertained that twenty of the
thirty-five officers attending voted the
slate ticket. There was much delay and
likewise a deal of perplexity in fixing up
the slate. It was not. really fixed to the
satisfaction of a majority until late yester
day afternoon.
Major Duboce was brought in as a neu
tral or compromise candidate. Captain
James F. Smith had many friends, but he
could not acquiesce in the conditions pre
sented by which he might attain success.
He could not guarantee either that the
First Regiment Armory on Marfcet street
should not be abandoned, neither could
he give positive assurance that in event
of its abandonment all of the companies
should go under one roof.
Twenty officers voted the slate and
fifteen refrained from voting for any can
didate.
Victor D. Duboce, the lieutenant-colonel
elect, enlisted in Company F, Second Ar
tillery, October 8, 1878, and* served as pri
vate, corporal and sergeant for eight years.
He was then appointed captain and A. D.
C. on brigade staff. He served in the sev
eral positions of quartermaster, commis
sary, paymaster arid inspector with rank
of major for nearly ten years past on the
staffs of Generals Dimond, Cutting, Dick
inson and Warfield, and at present is the
inspector of the Second Brigade on General
Warfield 's staff.
When the result of the election was an-
I nounced last night, the lieutenant-colonel
elect was greeted with cheers. He was in
troduced by Colonel Macdonald to the as
sembled officers, and made a brief and
sensible speech from a military point of
view.
Captain Boxton, major-elect, also spoke
in good military form, providing to worfc
diligently to promote tue efficiency of his
battalion.
Major-elect Mangels was not present.
Major-elect Charles L. Tilden has served
in the National Guard for twenty-one
years. In referring last night to the reor
ganization of the guard he disclaimed all
responsibility for any part of the proceed
ings. On the line between unfavorable
comment on and direct criticism of the
action of his superior officers, he remarked
that it seemed to him that the established
order of things had been disregarded in
tne reorganization. He was sure, how
ever, that no more fiascos like the one at
Sacramento would ever occur again in the
National Guard. He advocated narmony
ana predicted that time would heal the
bruised spots in the guard.
After the speech-making the assembled
officers, on the invitation of Captains Bax
ton and Tilden, went upstairs for refresh
ments.
An election for one lieutenant-colonel
and two majors of the Fifth Infantry Regi
ment was held at 426 Bush street laateven
ing. Lieutenant-Coionel A. K. Whitton
of San Jose was re-elected. Major L. W.
Juillardof Santa Rosa and Major J. H.
Hayes of Oakland were also re-elected.
Other officers present were:
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks, i'etaluma; Captain
V- Elliot, Company D; Captain C. F. Poulter,
Company A; w. F. Cnipraan, Company G;
Captain George Wethern, Company F; Captain
John Dunbar, Company E; Captain Frank
Easterly, Company H ; Captain H. L. Partridge,
Company B; Captain J. F. McLay, Company
C; Captain D. R. Smitb, adjutant; Lieutenant
E. S. Heller, inspector rifle practice, and Lieu
tenant Borlini, battalion adjutant.
After the election refreshments were
served. The Fifth Regiment now ranks
second in proficiency of rifle practice. In
this respect the Eighth Infantry leads, but
Lieutenant Heller, the inspector, says tae
Fifth will aoon take tbe first piace.
THOSE ATLANTA CHINESE
Test Case of Kam Joy, an Ac
tress Arrested in Los
Angeles.
LAWYER RIORDAN'S POSITION.
Collector of the Port Wise Is Closely
Watching the Progress of
the Matter.
The test case of Kam Joy, one of the
Atlanta Fair Chinese actresses, and who
was arrested by Inspector J. D. Putnam in
Los Angeles, promises to develop into a
controversy of unusual interest, as the
Chinese company which imported the '200
and more exhibitors for the Atlanta Ex
position propose to stand upon the literal
wording of the resolution passed by Con
gress in January, last year, which allowed
them to come into this country.
A preliminary hearing has just been
had in Los Angeles, and United States
Commissioner Van Dyke has taken the
matter under advisement. Attorney
Thomas D. Kiordan, who has been retained
by the Chinese company because of his
knowledge of Federal law, defended the
girl there and has just returned to this
City. Kam Joy is only 18 years of age, and
Inspector Putnam says she was sold to a
highbinder for $2200. It seems that the
Federal authorities did not discover that
ehe was one of the Atlanta Fair actresses
until after her arrest, and that they are
now trying to make a strong case of what
at first appeared an insignificant matter.
Mr. Riordan made a defense of the girl
in Los Angeles which almost staggered
the prosecution. United States District
Attorney Denis being in New Orleans at
the time the Government was represented
by Assistant United States District At
torney Findlayson. Mr. Findlayson con
tended that all the Chinese actors should
have been compelled to go back to their
native country when the Atlanta Fair Ex
position was over. Mr. Kiordan took ad
vantage of this weak argument by Bhow
ing to the commissioner just how the
resolution of Congress read.
The three resolutions of Congress pro
viding for the admission of exhibitors for
the Columbian Exposition, California Mid
winter Fair and Atlanta Exposition, re
spectively, are substantially the same.
They prohibit the importation of alien
contract laborers and expressly declare
that the alien contract labor law of Feb
ruary 26, 1885, and the acts restricting
Chinese immigration shall not be so con
strued as to allow alien laborers to enter
this country.
All the resolutions contemplated, ac
cording to Mr. Riordan's interpretation,
was the admission of the exhibitors and
their servants for a specific purpose and
stated period of time.
Under the resolution of January 21, 1895,
the Atlanta Fair Chinese were given the
privilege of remaining in this country for
one year after the close of the exposition,
and certificates were issued to them ac
cordingly to cover that period of time.
Mr. Findlayson, it is tboucht, somewhat
perverted the proviso of the resolution
which was evidently added to the reso
lution for the express purpose of exclud
ing all aliens not connected with the At
lanta Fair aggregation. The meaning of
the proviso ia that no other alien laborer
should be permitted to enter the United
States unless expressly permitted to do so
by the Secretary of the Treasury, and that
any aliens admitted by such special per
mission would be subject to all the pro
visions and penalties of the alien coutiact
labor law.
Mr. Findlayson tried to convince the
Commissioner that under the proviso the
Atlanta Fair people should be deported in
accordance with the spirit of the alien con
tract labor law, but Mr. Riordan showed
that the proviso did not say any such
thing; that on the contrary thn very ob
ject of the resolution was to confer special
privileges on the Atlanta Fair exhibitors
and employes, and t.;e proviso was ap
pended purely for the purpose of keeping
out all other alien laborers, that is, for the
purpose of preventing others from ship
ping in under the resolution.
Collector of the Port Wise is closely
watching the progress of the case. Speak
ing of it he said yesterday :
The point is, Have these Atlanta Fair Chin
ese changed their status? In my mind, the in
tention of Congress in adopting the resolution
was to extend the privilege only to bona-flde
exhibitors, and that this privilege was to con
tinue only bo long as they remained exhibitors.
On the other hand, Mr. Riordan argues
that the very feature of the resolution
allowing the exhibitors to remain here a
year after the exposition closed is evidence
that Congress intended that they should
stay here long enough to recoup them
selves for any expenses of traveling and
losses they might sustain in coming to the
Atlanta Fair. The well-known attorney
for the Six Companies observed, as he
comfortably seated himself in his new
offices in the Safe Deposit building yes
terday :
Mr. Findlayaon tries to argue that the reso
lution of Congress contemplated the sending
back of these people as soon as the fair was
closed. And why? Just because they are
Mongolians. Nothing is said about the Da
homey village and the South Africans. So tar
as they are concerned they may enjoy the full
benefit of the resolution, but it is to be alto
gether different, it would Â»eein, with the Chi
nese. Now, I betieve the resolution means
what it says, and I propose to make my tight
by standing upon its exact meaning.
Sixty more Chinese actors arrived in
Chinatown yesterday, ranging all ages
from 10 to 20 years. They were escorted
to the Washington-street Theater from
tbfl ferry landing by Tong Ching, the
agent of the Atlanta Fair Company.
Their leader, Kue Wong, said thry made
plenty of money in New Orleans Â«md Los"
Angeles from the performances they gave
there.
GOVERNOR JOHN E. JONES
The Invalid Forced by the Con
stitution of Nevada to
Return.
Mrs. Jones' Story of Her Husband's
Steady Improvement From the
Cancer Disease.
The condition of Governor John E.
Jones of Nevada, has been ill for a
long time at the Palace, has considerably
improved during the past three weeks.
It. was given out a month ago that the
Governor was afflicted with cancer of the
stomach. Three physicians attended him.
On consultation at that timeâ so it was
stated yesterday â they decided he would
certainly die. They said he might live for
a day or two, or even longer, but tnat the
case was so serious that it was nonsense to
think about his recovering.
Mrs. Jones, the Governor's wife, is a
resolute lady at such trying times. She
promptly sent for Mrs. Dr. Cook, the can
cer specialist.
'She began treating the Governor at
once," said Mrs. Jones yesterday, "and he
began to improve. His progress has been
steady, too. The nausea ceased and he
grew so ne could take food regularly,
though in limited amounts.
"His diet is malted milk, beef jelly,
granum and oranges. He also takes a
little lime juice at times, with occasion
ally other things that may be suggested
by him or others.
"We believe the cancer will be perma
nently cured. Mrs. Cook comes to see
him four times a day. She is so faithful
and kind that I would like to have a good
word said about her. The Governor has
now got so he can walk twice across the
long room and back during the afternoon,
and is apparently progressing nicely in
every way."
The Governor's friends have been talk
ing of moving him to Nevada. By the
constitution of that State the Governor
cannot be absent at any one time longer
than ninety days. If he is he loses his pay.
Governor Jones' time wi!l empire Feb
ruary 13. He must leave Here, therefore,
as they estimate, by the 11th at most, iti
order to be certain to be in time. Arrange
ments are being made with the Southern
Pacific, therefore, lor a special car for the
occupancy of the invalid Governor and
his family. He is to go up one day and
come Dack the r.ext.
A BURGLAR'S BOLD DASH
William Smith Slips His Hand
cuffs and Attempts to
Get Away.
Captain Robinson Collars the Fugitive
After a Brief Chase of One
Hundred Yards.
William Smith, convicted of grand lar
ceny, was yesterday sentenced by Judge
Wallace to nine years' imprisonment at
Folsom. Shortly after this he made a des
perate attempt to escape, and but for the
presence of Caotain Robinson would prob
ably have succeeded.
Smith, with eight other fellow-prisoners,
was being taken from the Central Station
to the County Jail preparatory to leaving
for his new home. The nine prisoners
were chained together securely, it was
thought, at the time. They were marched
William Smith.
from the prison to the van, Deputy Sheriff
John Rusher being in charge and in front
of the line of prisoners.
Just before Smith's turn to enter the van
he slipped his handcuffs and was off like
the wind. Captain Robinson, who was
just to the rear of the gang, saw him the
moment he was off, and he knew at a
glance that it devolved upon him to cap
ture the fast escaping prisoner.
The sequel shows that the captain is
somewhat of a sprinter, for he collared the
fugitive in less than a hundred yards.
Smith was escorted back to the van and
then Captain Robinson sat down to catch
his breath. Smith's hands were badly
lacerated as the result of his successful
effort to remove the handcuffs.

to The Call:
B. F. HfDELsoK, W. F. Barnes,
Slate President. State Secretary.
OFFICE OF THE
STATE COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA,
Room 40, Academy of Sciences Building, 819
Market Street,
San Francisco, Cal., January 31, 180 H.
To the Editor of The Callâ DeakSir: Into a
controversy which has occupied the columns
of your paper for several weeks the name of
the American Protective Association has been
repeatedly drawn as though the principles of
that organization were under discussion. That
tueh is not the case is reveaied by even a super
ficial examination of the facts.
The controversy, to which your columns have
been s>o impartially opened, is in its nature en
tirely religious. On one side has been the
Catholic church represented, whether officially
or otherwise it matters not, by Peter C. Yorke,
one of its secular priests. On the other side
have been representatives of Protestant creeds-
Unitarian, Presbyterian and Methodist divines.
These gentlemen have, with varying success,
hurled theological, philosophical and historical
arguments at each other's heads, and here and
there in the melee have appeared individual
laymen who. being personally opposed to the
Catholic religion, nave seen tit to mate public
their reasons tor holdingsuch position. It has
been a ba'.tle of religious sects, a struggle be
tween creeds, a contest of theologians.
But,- Mr. Editor, whichever of the dis
putants may have gained an advantage, who
of them emerges from the dust of battle least
Bcarred and unshaken is not for me to judge;
nor would it be proper for me, having formed
such an opinion, to express it here, for the
American Protective Association has nothing
â whatever to do with theology. It stands
neither for nor against any religion, church or
creed. It stands simply for all that is great
and good and clean in American institutions
and American patriotism. And for this reason
this disputatious controversy can of right have
nothing to do either with the A. P. A. or with
me as the official head of the American Pro
tective Association of California.
But, Mr. Editor, although the A. P. A. is not
opposed to any religion, as such, the repre
sentative of the Catholic faith appears bitterly
hostile to it. Mr. Yorke has brought the name j
of the American Protective Association into
the present controversy under every pretext.
With slanderous and "unsupported assertion
has he sought to defile its fair fame. By un
worthy insinuation and innuendo has he at
tacked it. False . assumption, palpably er
roneoms premises, imexcusably distorted logic,
!â¢ lanMc quotation of tongues to him un
known, specious argument, priestly sophistry
and bold prevarication â none of these has he
neglected in his bushwhacking attempts to
place the organization in a false light before
the public.
Mr. Yorke is clever. Ye?, Mr. Editor, he is
more, for he is sly. He has a certain dexterity
of language which, would be appreciated by
ordinary confidence men. His comparative
nimbleriess of wit and skill with the pen would
be doubtless useful to craftsmen in far
lowlier if not less honorable trades. And his
calm, almost hypnotic assumption of
superiority is surely worthy a better man and
a better cause.
And because he is so clever, Mr. Editor, I
must assume that his attacks upon the A. P. A.
arise not from ignorance ot its true objects and
motives but from a willful and bitter hostility
to all that is good and true in Americanism.
Furthermore, Mr. Editor, because of these
attacks upon the A. P. A., because of the per
sistent attempts to delude the public into the
belief that the A. P. A. is engaged in religious
â¢warfareâ for th<*se reasons I hnve deemed it
necessary for me in my official capacity to
commence the preparation of a series of arti
cles setting forth the reai position of the
American Protective Association, and within a
very few days I shall present them to your
readers. In these articles I shall also exploit
the unexampled "slipperyness'' of Peter C.
Yorke. Very respectfully, B. F. Hvdelso.v,
State President of the A. P. A. of California.
ON THE ALMSHOUSE TRACT
Supervisors Finally Decide on a
Location for the Pest-
House.
Mayor Sutro Had Not Found a Site
and Was Refused Further
Time.
As Mayor Sutro had not yet succeeded
in finding a suitable site for the pest
house the Health and Police Committee
of the Board of Supervisors decided yes
terday to place the institution on "the
Almshouse Tract in a small valley that
was selected some time ago.
Mayor Sutro asked more time, stating
that he had been negotiating for the pur
chase of Shag Rock, but the committee
did not believe that under any circum
stances this would be a suitable site and
refused to grant any further delay.
The Mayor's main objections were sub
mitted as follows:
Firstâ This tract is the geographical center
of San Francisco, and the winds blowing from
the west, almost during the whole year, will
scatter disease germs over the thickly settled
Mission country and South San Francisco,
endangering the lives of a large portion of our
population and creating a constantly recur
ring feeling of dread of disease and inbecurity
of mind.
Secondâ The value of taxable Droperty which
will, more or less, be thus affected from and
sou ih of Market street to Twenty-sixth street
is. as taken from the Assessor's books, about
$96,000,000; the location of tlie Pesthouse on
this spot will depreciate property values in
this district, at least 5 percent, which would
be a loss to to the treasury of the City and
County, at the rate of 1 per cent, of $480,000.
Thirdâ The actual value of the land to be
occupied by the Pesthouse, say one acre, is
about Â£1000, and the plea is made that the
City already owns this land and, therefore,
need not buy a site. As a financial proposi
tion, then, the City will make use of a piece of
property valued at SIOOO, and thereby lose an
nually $480,000.
Fourthâ There is now a sewer from the Alms
house Tract, passing close to and alongside
â Laguna Honda reservoir, which discharges on
the sand Hats adjoining Golden Gate Park. If
a sewer to the ocean is finally constructed, it
will have a length of three miles, and the
nouses on the whole length will connect there
with ana be exposed to contagion from the
germs arising from the Pesthouse sewage.
,, ls ar Â£ ve d tlmt this sewage can be chemi
cally disinfected before it leaves the Pest
house. Whether this can be done at all is
problematical ; if it can it will be a continuous
daily expense, amounting to quite a sum at
the end of the year, and if neglected for a
6ingle day, which is sure to hap Den. may
spread disease along the whole line of the
sewer.
Fifthâ Ambulances bringing patienta to the
IJastnouse must pass for several miles through
some of the best parts of the City and alongside
of Golden Gate Park close to' the children's
playground.
Sixthâ One of the most important distribut
ing reserroirs of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, which supplies a large part of the City,
is located alongside of the proposed Pesthouse
site, and nothing is more certain than that
contamination of our drinking water will take
place from germs of typhoid, typhus, cholera
and other contagious diseases.
Should the measure be approved by the
board it will undoubtedly be vetoed by the
Mayor, and it is doubtful whether" the
necessary nine votes can be obtained to
pass it over his veto.

GROSS INSULT DENIED
Captain Healy Contradicts the
Story of Lieutenant
Daniels.
End of the Inquiry Into the Second
Charge Against the Veteran
Commander.
"I did not take a drinK on Thanksgiving
morning until I got aboard the Bear, be
cause I had no liquor in the house."
This was the sworn statement of the
aged defendant at yesterday's session of
the Healy investigation. A. P. Hourigan,
Michael Hilbert and Christopher Hansen,
members of the Bear's crew who rowed
the captain to the cutter from the wharf at
Sausalito on the morning of Thanksgiv
ing day, 1895, have all testified to his so
briety on that occasion, and the old com
| mander was giving his explanation of the
passage-at-arms between himself and
Lieutenant Daniels immediately after he
boarded the vessel.
"On the night of the 27th of November,"
said the captain, "I retired shortly after 9
o'clock. At 7 the next morning, Thanks
giving day, I arose and took breakfast,
leaving for Sausalito immediately after
ward. I did not drink anything because
there was nothing to drink in the house.
When I boarded the cutter, which was
then lying at Sausalito, I sent for Mr.
Daniels and asked him whether he had
made certain entries in the cutter's log
which I had ordered him to make. HÂ« re
plied, in a very off-hand fashion, that there
was plenty of time, and was so uppish and
insolent in his demeanor that it disgusted
me.
"I spat on the floor, not in Daniels' eye,
and ordered him out of my presence. In
place of leaving, Daniels raised a great out
cry, accusing ire of spitting in his face.
Mr. Emery, who seems to have been list
ening without the door, rushed in forth
with in great excitement, without knock
ing at the door or noticing me in any way.
I told Mr. Daniels that his insulting state
ment was a lie. Emery and Daniels then
went off, and I am told they sent a dis
patch to the Secretary of the Treasury at
Washington.
"The day after Thankseiving Mr. Emery
handed me a dispatch, signed by the As
sistant Secretary of the Treasury, which
read, if I recollect aright, as follows:
Inform Healy he is detached.' Turn over
command lo Buhner.
"After reading the telegram 1 went on
deck and ordered the officers and crew
summoned thither. I told them all to be
faithful in the performance of their duties
and respectful and obedient to their new
commander. The poor fellows cheered me
with all their might, and some of them
cried a iittle. I then turned over the com
mand of the Bear to Lieutenant Buhner,
and have not seen the vessel since."
Lieutenant Buhner, in the most em
phatic terms, reiterated his former state
ment that the captain was perfectly sober
on Tnanksgiving day and the day follow
ing.
At the afternoon session an attempt was
made by the prosecution to impeach the
testimony of the witnesses, Boundy,
Powers and Hourigan. on the ground of
alleged enmity on their part toward Dan
iels. That omcial had been in difficulties
by reason of certain charges made against
him by the three men and others and
affected to regard theni as enemies. They
contended that they were entirely un
biased.
Lieutenant Daniels was closely ques
tioned by Captain Healy's attorneys as to
his motives in attacking his super or,
"I feared physical violence at his hands,"
answered the youthlul lieutenant. "The
captain and I were once debating as to
which one of us was the better mnn and
the captain dared me to takeoff my coat
an<i right him. 1 have Deen awfully afraid
of him ever since."
Captain Healy was then called to the
stand to give his statement. His manner
was dignified, and perhaps even a trifle
haughty, as he remarked :
"I may as well let the testimony go as it
is. There is no statement against me
which I consider worthy of my attention.
The assertion that I was intoxicated on
the morning of Thanksgiving day is a lie,
and what more need I say about it? Dan
iels has evidently made up bis mind to
down me, and had Emery and Coffin by
him to serve as witnesses to the scene
which he endeavored to create. But his
methods seem to me singularly crude and
unscientific. As for the telegram to Wash
ington, if sent at all it should have been
sent by Buhner, the first in command after
myself, and not by an underling."
This concludes the investication into the
affair at Sausalito. To-day the charges of
misconduct on the high seas will be taken
up.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1*96.
A STRONG TIDE
AGAINST BROWN
Significant Action of the
Christian Endeavor
Society.
INTENDED AS A REBUKE
No Meetings to Be Held in the
Church While the Pastor
Officiates.
HISSING TO BE DENOUNCED.
Resolutions to Be Presented Wednes
dayâMrs. Stockton May Ignore
the Church.
Each day develops a stronger solidifica
tion of the forces that are arrayed against
the course that bas been announced by
Dr. Brown and his adherents, and the
rallying point is the venerable and brave
woman, who on Wednesday night dared,
alone and unsupported, to make a protest
against the adoption of resolutions of con
fidence in the pastor of the first Congre
gational Church.
One of the most significant developments
yesterday was the expression made by a
majority of the Young People's Society of
Christian Endeavor of Dr. Brown's church
to the effect that the society would hold
no meetings at, the church so long as Dr.
Brown presumed to officiate.
Mrs. Stockton has assumed an attitude
of indifference in reference to the charges
that have been tiled against her with the
standing committee of the First Church,
and it is likely that she will ignore all
ecclesiastical efforts to open out the record
of her life.
Another element of interest will be added
to the meetine of Wednesday next by the
introduction by the friends of Mrs. Cooper
of a resolution denouncing those who par
ticipated in the hissing of last Wednesday
night.
AGAINST DR. BROWN.
Young People Will Not Meet In
the Church If He
Preaches.
The Young People's Society of Christian
Endeavor is in a state of insurrection.
It will hold no more meetings in the
First Congregational Church if Dr. Brown
continues to preach there.
A prominent member of the society,
who for personal reasons declined to have
his name mentioned in connection with
the scandal, gave expression to his opin
ions yesterday.
"I have seen a large number of the
church members and those of the Young
People's Society of Christian Endeavor,"
said he, "and they are firm in their deter
mination not to attend church as long as
Dr. Brown preaches, or until he clear?
himself of the charges made against him.
They are all willing to give him every
chance to clear himself, even if he desires
three or four months in which to do so;
but they feel that there will be a split in
the church if he insists on preaching. The
best interests of the church will be sub
served by his remaining away until he is
ready to explain his course of "action.
"They arc- In hearty accord with the state
ment made by Mrs. Cooper at prayer
meeting last Wednesday evening. Right
here I want to say that the statements
made by certain papers that the audience
at large hissed Mrs. Cooper are false.
Very few of the members of the Y. P. S.
C. E. outside of Dr. Brown's son Valentine
so far forgot their sense of decency, to use
a mild word, as to hiss a lady. Tne hiss
ing was largely done by a crowd of out
siders, who were there to support Dr.
Brown, and I happen to know the names
of several.
"Dr. Brown's seeking refuge behind the
statement that his attorney will not per
mit him to speak, or even to tell Mrs.
Cooper his defense under promise of se
crecy, gives color to the belief that he
either has no defense at all or that it is so
weak as not to permit the scrutiny even of
Mrs. Cooper. It will be at least two
mouths before Mrs. Davidson's trial will
have been finished, and two or three
weeks longer before a council can be called.
The church cannot stand a strain so severe
as that, evn to gratify Dr. Brown's de
sire to see Mrs. Davidson behind the bars.
"The active workers of the Christian
Endeavor Socieiy, realizing that unless
some action was taken the members would
drift out of the church and perhaps not
return acain, have decided, after serious
consultation, to hold their prayer-meeting
at the residence of some of the members
instead of at the church. This is only
done to prevent a large number of resigna
tions being sent in, and as a careful can
vas of the members reveals the fact that at
least three-fourths of those who regularly
attend positively refuse to listen to Dr.
Brown or to go to the church so long as
he preaches, they will take a firm stand on
the matter.
"Next Sunday will see a very small
attendance of active workers at the First
Congregational Church. At least two
thirds of the Sunday-school teachers have
signified their intention to remain away.
Many of these have taught in the school
for years."
The meetings of the society will be held
at the home of Miss Myrtle Simpson.
WILL NOT APPEAR.
Mrs. Stockton Will Probably Ignore
the Proposed Church
Investigation.
Of the many persons involved in the
Brown-Davidson-Overman, scandal, the
one least depressed is Mrs. M. A. Stock
ton.
She it was that remained silent when her
character was aspersed. Finally she was
induced to make a statement for publica
tion. The statement was first published
in The Call, word for word as it was
made.
Dr. Brown had charged her with black
mailing him out of $600. This she em
phatically denied.
She admitted, however, having received
money, voluntary offerings, at different
times from the pastor of the First Con
gregational Church. She told of little ex
cursions with the doctor to points of in
terest about the City; how he hung about
the entrance of the Surveyor-General's
office, where she was employed, and
patiently awaited until her day's work
was done that he might escort her home;
how they dined together at a restaurant
noted for its good dinners rather than its
morality ; how he kissed her in her room
and caressed her in his study.
This, in brief, was the statement made
by Mrs. Stockton in reply to the charges
in the affidavit made by Attorney Greer
and published at the instance of Dr.
Brown.
It is upon these charges of alleged ex
tortion that the standing committee of the
First Congregational Church has been
called to investigate. The demand for a
church, trial of Mrs. Stockton, who is still
a member of the congregation in good
standing, is preferred by the anti-Brown
faction. The committee members think
that in this manner Dr. Brown will be
called upon to substantiate his charge of
extortion against Mrs. Stockton, and in
view of the widow's published statement
feel that he will be unable to do so.
Mrs- Stockton, however, will not appear
before the standing committee. In that
case Dr. Brown's testimony will stand un
impeached and Mrs. Stockton will be
forced to leave the church. Should this be
the result it willcause the fascinating Kin
dergarten teacher little or no sorrow.
"I am not worrying over this affair,"
said Mrs. Stockton yesterday. "It does
not pay to worry, don't you knew? The
fact is, I am taking very little interest in
this so-called scandal of the church."
"Will you make a statement to the
standing committee?" was asked.
"Now, I don't wish to bother my head
about tne affair at all," she replied
sharply.
"Why did yon attend the prayur-meet
ing on Wednesday?"
"To g<:t spiritual consolation, of course,"
replied the pretty little widow, with a
smile. "Do you fancy that the innocent
Mrs. Stockton could have any other pur
pose?" and again she smiled.
"Will you remain in the church?"
"Weil, since I went into the church
under the administration of Dr. Brown it
is not improbable that I may be privileged
to go out with it."
In this manner, and with much spirit
and good humor, Mrs. Stockton showed
her cleverness at fencing.
"I have always been curious to know,
Mrs. Stockton," inquired a young lady
reporter, who was one of a half dozen
representatives of the press whom she
admitted to her flat at 615 a Mason street,
"What the menu at the Maison Riche was
like on the occasion of the famous
dinner?"
"Well, the fact is, I have eat6n so many
dinners since that time, not with Dr.
Brown, however, that I have really for
gotten," replied Mrs. StocKton with a
laugh.
"Will you attend the prayer-meeting
next Wednesday ?"
"Well, that depends on how my supply
of spiritual consolation is by that time, 7 '
she replied.
"I am feeling very well physically, mor
ally, intellectually and spiritually, espe
cially since Wednesday night, and have
no wish to be disturbed," continued Mrs.
Stockton.
"Will you receive the standing com
mittee if a call is made on you?"
"Well, if the gentlemen of the com
mittee are anyway interesting I may con
sider the matter," and. there was more
laughter.
"Seriously speaking, however, I have re
ceived no notice from the standing com
mittee of the church, and until I do I can
decide on no course of action."
Some person asked her what she thought
of the stand Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper had
taken.
"Mrs. Cooper is a saint," is all she
would say.
Mrs. Stockton is expected to make no
statement to the committee. Her disposi
tion is to allow Dr. Brown to have his
tling. She says that she wants to be left
severely alone.
CHAMPION MRS. COOPER.
Her Friends Indignantâ Mrs. David
son In Jail Writes to the Kin
dergarten Leader.
The friends of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper are
indignant over the manner in which she
was insulted by the followeis of Dr. Brown
at the prayer-meeting on Wednesday
night. They claim that the hissing was
uncalled for and outrageous, and are very
much wrought up over the incident. They
will at the prayer-meeting this coining
Wednesday evening introduce a resolu
tion denouncing those who participated in
the affair.
The latest issue of the Pacific, the coast
organ of Congregationalism, contains as
its leading editorial the following written
by Dr. Mooar, a member of the Bay Asso
ciation committee appointed to investigate
the reports of immoral conduct made
against Dr. Brown:
Perhaps it may be said of those who have
made It [the report of the joint committee] that
they have done what they could and no more.
The original hope of the pastor in his asking
from thi- Bay Association the appointment by
that body of three brethren, to whom he could
sacredly confide for the time being his personal
defense, whether that hope was reasonable or
not at first, soon became practically impossi
ble. For the three were increased to five, nt
least, and then the officers of the First Church
were associated with them, and the enlarged
body became obviously too large for a confi
dential committee, and by its very composi
tion was unauthorized to pursue an orderly or
adequate investigation.
The committee, therefore, have sensibly de
clined to hear what in the circumstances
would be only a one-iided presentation of the
matter. They have simply appealed to the
public to do what they themselves propose to
doâ continue confidence in the integrity of the
man until reasons for the lack of confidence
shall be made clear in a competent council.
The fact that fifteen such gentlemen should
make ihia latter affirmation without a dissent
ing voice is certainly remarkable. It does not
by any means solve the difficulties, but it
should give a measure of restfulness to those
who are very anxious for the good name of our
churches.
Mrs. Davidson yesterday addressed the
following letter to Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper:
Mrs. Cooperâ Dear Madam: I have read all
the papers say of you since my arrest. lam
truly sorry that one who by his position at
least should be a champion in the cause of
truth and virtue is now arrayed against them.
And it was no surprise to me when C. O. Brown
refused to give you a hearing for the reason
that you are in opposition to him, as right and
virtue are opposed to falsity and vice.
I therefore honor you for the stand you have
taken and am sure it is upon the broad plat
form which was instituted by the great pro
mulgator of the second commandment, "Thou
ahalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
Strange as it may appear the observance of
this commandment alone has placed me where
I am, and no one knows this better than C. O.
Brown. Yet no one could less appreciate the
commandment than those who adhere to itâ
whether Mrs. Cooper or Mrs. Davidsonâ less
than this same C. O. Rrown.
Therefore we meet on a common ground, and
not in the environment of narrow personali
ties or popular prejudices, to discuss those
broad truths which form the tap-root of moral
ity so essential to the development of the
church, the state and the home. Evolution is
generally accomplished through suffering, and
through the dim lenses of our experience we
see that divine surgery was needed to cut out
the Hidden ulcer which was festering and rot
ting beneath the garb of priestly sanctity,
which might, in time, innoculate the entire
youth and virtue of the First Church.
The divine fire went forth as it is written,
"Be sure your sins will find you out," and, as
C. O. Brown dictated the wonls of the paper
which he bade me write and which was his
doom, "By thine own words ahalt thou be
condemned."
God chose me to execute his wrath and in
the mystery of his workings a most extraor
dinary result followed. The Lord tells us "not
to fear, as though it was some new thing that
had overtaken us, but to count it all joy," etc.
I followed tUc text he hath given us and am
willing to suffer as the instrument which, acts
in the removal of evil in C. O. Brown, and in
those he said were co-offenders with him.
About nine years ago I gave myself wholly
to the service of God. My prayer was then as
it is to-day, that I be united to Christ ac the
branch to the vine. My prayer was heard
then, as it is in prison to-day.
On the 24th day of November, and aye to the
19th of December, about six weeks ago, I be
lieved in the penitence of C. O. Brown. For
more than one year he had made me his confi
dant. First by relating a series of tempations
and trials, and getting me to pray for and ad
vise him. Daily and many times each day I
told them to my blessed Lord.
At times I felt almost overwhelmed by his
continual coming, and told him that he'must
go to others in the church, but he always said:
'â¢I know you live near the Lord and always
feel secure with you and a sense of relief when
I nave talked with you." So, if I may use the
expression, it prayed upon my confidence. In
return I had but little confidence in him, yet
kept on praying and advising him, yet never
anticipated that he yielded to the temptations
which he seemed to deplore.
At last the guilty pairâ C. O. Brown and Miss
Overmanâ wera traced to Sixth street, corner
of Bryant, November 24. 1894, and then were
reported to me September 10, 1895.
Miss Overman acknowledged alt the story
and gave every detail of her relations with C.
O. Brown. She was my Sunday-school scholar,
and with many tears she confessed the terrible
story.
For three months I suspected by her letters
to and her talks with me that possibly things
would reach this condition. But when I called
C. O. Brown to my room he told me even more
than did Miss Overmanâ things which recrim
inated her and himself, as well as others.
After this my informant threatened to ex
pose (J. O. Brown and his companion. C. O.
Brown then devised the means of his escape
from it. He knew me too well to base it in any
other way than a profession of contrition with
strong prayers and tears.
For one month I labored with him and felt
so sure, so sure of his sincerity that I took pains
to go out in severe storms to tell the story of
ray confidence in him, believing that he had
truly reconsecrated himself to Cnrist.
Like the descent of a thunderbolt he had me
arrested, l'ou are not surprised when I say I
have not a spark of confidence in him. He is
a desperate man, a libertine of deepest dye;
deceit covers him as with a garment. He has
lied to me and to God. It is possible perhaps
by an abuse of legal authority to send
me to San Quentin, but a prison house awaits
C. O. Brown where there is no escape, accord
ing to the tenets of his own profession. "All
liars ana loose-livers shall have their part in
the lake of lire and brimstone, which is the
second death." See Revelations, chapter XXI,
verse 8. In Christian faith and fellowship, I
am yours, Mrs. A. Davidson.
Mrs. Cooper received between twenty
and thirty letters jesterday, all strongly
commending her action of Wednesday
night. These were not alone from mem
bers of the church, but from many promi
nent men and women, who are not so
much interested in church affairs as in the
preservation of the moral tone of the com
munity. Among these communications
were two from clergymen of other denomi
nations.
One of the most promin ent Congrega
tionalists of this City, who has been
watching the developments in the Brown
case with great interest, yesterday called
attention to the marked and significant
difference in the resolutions adopted on
Monday night by ths joint committee, and
those passed by the officers and trustees oi
the First Church on the Tuesday night fol
lowing.
In that adopted by the joint committee
occurs tne following:
Dr. Brown has assured ns that he will ask
the church to institute this investigation
assisted by an ecclesiastical council duly con
vened.
In view of these things we propose for our
selves, and we ask of all others, a suspension
of judgment in the case of Dr. Brown, aud, we
hereby express our confidence in his integrity.
The report of the First Church officials
concluded as follows:
Resolved, That this body expresses full and
entire confidence in Rev. C. O. Brown's integ
rity and good moral character and will not
credit vague and damaging insinuations until
they are proved before a competent tribunal.
In the one case it was pointed out that
a council was provided for, while in the
other a "competent tribunal." It was
shown that a competent tribunal might be
nothing more than a committee of the
church members.
This gentleman went so far as to say he
believed the action of the church officials
on Tuesday was in reality intended to
modify the action of tiie joint committee
and that their report was virtually a sub
stitute for that of the joint committee. He
believed that the First Church officials
were induced to take this action by the
more ardent of Dr. Brown's adherents.
WHITE HAD SUFFICIENT
Wrestler Pearce Threw Him in
the First Round and Vin
cent Gave Up. i
The Cornishman Was Too Strong for
the American, and Simply
Wore Him Out.
John Pearce of Cornwall, the man who
wrestled seven hours with Carkeek in Red
ruth some time ago and made a draw of it,
met Vincent White of this City at B'nai
B'rith Hall last night in a wrestling match
or $200 a side and threw him. White quit
after thirty-live minutes of hard work, at
the end of the round, and told the stake
holder to give Pearce the stakes, as he had
sufficient to satisfy him as to. his incapacity
to throw the Cornishtnan.
The hall was pretty well filled consider
ing the short time in which the match was
arranged, and the spectators were satisfied
that they had seen fair play and that the
best man had won.
The ball opened with a preliminary
between Frank Joncas of British Columbia
and Kid Henry of Portland in a catch-as
catch-can match.
After a little sparring for holds the Kid
hooked nis man and slowly rolled him
over on three points. His arm tightened
around Jonca's neck, and when the referae
declared it a fall Henry got up and left
Joncas on the canvas writhing and gasp
ing for breath.
A hush came over the spectators and
several men rushed forward to assist the
fallen wrestler. He recovered, however
in a few seconds and went to his corner
with a very studious expression on his
face.
The second go was more cautious and
Henry continued to play for Joncas' wind
pipe. Suddenly J.oncas wheeled and in a
lew seconds had Henry on three points.
The audience applauded for another bout,
and although Joncas wanted another
chance, both men left the canvas for their
dressing-rooms.
Considerable delay was encountered be
fore White and Pearce got to work.
Finally Joe Acton was selected as referee.
The principals tossed for style, White win
ning and selecting catch-us-catch-can, his
favorite method. At 9 o'clock Penrce en
tered the hail in black tigtits, stepping
gingerly across the floor. White followed
almost immediately amid considereble ap
plause.
They went at each other without much
hesitation, Pearce soon getting on top,
with the San Francisco man hugging the
canvas, stomach down. At this point
there was some severe straining and it
looked for some time as though White
would loose the fall, having touched two
points. He got back on his feet after
some clever work, however, and his friends
whooped things up in approval. Alter
that both men got in a good breathing
spell. After Â« time the men made a few
scientific plays, but Pearce appeared to be
the stronuer. At the Â«nd of half an hour it
was about even, with both men putting up
the best they had. Once woile Pearce was
straining to roll White over and found it
impossible he looked around disgusted to
find White's legs twisted around his own
in such a position that it was impossible
to accomplish his ends. It seemed to an
noy him a little, but after standing it as
long as he could he finally reached back
and disengaged his own legs from those of
White and with a mighty effort pressed
him over and down on three points, win
nine: the first fall.
White immediately got up exhausted
and said, as he went to his dressing-room:
â¢'That man is too strong for me. I caunot
throw him, and therefore give up the
match."
White was satisfied that as he was un
able to throw Pearce at his own game, it
would be out of the question to dispose of
him Cornish style.
The spectators, after the announcement
that White had quit, clamored for a Cor
nish exhibition, and Felix Carlyon, the
champion lightweight Cornish wrestler of
Cornwall, went into the ring with Pearce
and gave a short exhibition, which seemed
to satiate the multitude.
Previous to departing Joe Acton chal
lenged Pearce on the same terms that
White had offered â Grseco-Homan, catch
as-catch-can or Cornish. Pearce replied
that he would respond in a challenge
through the papers, and the crowd dis
persed, after congratulating White on stay
ing in the game as long as he did.
New Passenger Agent.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
This is the day to leave orders for The
Sunday Call.
Tiilman's speech was redhot, cut the*i
G rover needed a roast.
Huntington seems to have everything
on his hands except gloves.
In the funding bill fight it is about time
we were hearing a Loud voice.
The East is bragging on a big ice crop
and we have the lemons to flavor it.
"Old Kentucky Never Tires" is a good
song, and may prove to be a true one.
No Democratic candidate for the Presi
dency has yet been accused of having a
boom.
The next thing we Hear from the Govern
ment will be the amount of the deficit for
January.
However the lobby may grease the slides
the refunding scheme won't pas? without
friction.
lowa joins with Kentucky in assisting
California, and the team is getting stronger
every day.
Dr. Jameson may be punished in Eng
land, and then again he may be elected to
Parliament.
It is about time for Congress to recall
the Bayard iucident and for Cleveland to
recall Bayard.
The monopoly expected the refunding
scheme to be a soft snap, and it turns out
to be a hard fight.
Every day adds a new deficit to empha
size the need of passing the emergency
tariff bill as soon as possible.
The California Congressman who doe 3
not keep his record clean on the funding
bill fight will surely be spotted.
From the silence of the poet laureate of
late it would seem he has begun to take
quiet steps to get his feet corrected.
It will soon be time for the Kaiser to
blow his bugle horn again, for the echoes of
the Krueger blast are rapidly dying out.
There are several State legislatures in
session, but none of them seem to be
doing business enough to advertise them
selves.
Chicago celebrated Burns' birtbday with
a dance, and that was a compliment to the
poet, for the biggest thing Chicago has -is
her feet.
If the silver men persist in forming a
separate organization for the campaign
the only result will be a surprise party for
themselves.
The work of the competing road in the
San Joaquin this year will demonstrate
the advisability of constructing similar
roads everywhere.
The danger that confronts Democracy is
that when the National Convention goes
it blind to pick a dark horse, it may get a
wild ass of the desert.
As soon as the funding bill fight is
settled we shall have to devote attention
immediately to the committee in charge
of the .Nicaragua bill.
Â»
Cleveland, Ohio, intends to celebrate her
centennial very soon, and will make it a
novelty by abstaining from anything in
the shape of an exposition.
By an Alderman ic decree no citizen of
Chicago can keep more than six dogs at a
time, and as a result there is a howl that is
heard across the continent.
There will be many issues in the cam
paign this year, but tariff reform will be
the one most needed by the government
and most interesting to the people.
Over in the blizzard-blown East one-half
the editors have had to begin writing
about Presidential politics to keep them
selves warm until the cold snap passes.
Although it is said Ohio is solid for Mc-
Kinley, there seems to be a hollow place
in it big enongn for Foraker to show him
self as a Presidential candidate if he
wishes.
The Senate resolutions do not directly
recognize the Cubans as belligerents, but
they give the Spaniards to understand
that we know a war is going on and feel
interested in it.
Cleveland may have expected to get
ahead of the Senate with a vigorous for
eign policy, but it Jooks now as if the
Senate might have to prod him a little to
make him keep up the pace.
The Salt Lake Herald KLYM the newly
elected Senator Brown of Utah due notice
that If lie is ambitious to go to the Senate
again he must begin his campaign at once,
as his opponents have aiready begun.
Senator Stewart was ri^ht. in saying the
vote on the silver substitute for the bond
hill would be "a dress parade," and he was
also right in adding that no silver man
coulcl afford to fall out of the ranks on
such an occasion.
Matthews of Indiana had scarcely got
himself mentioned as a possible Demo- J
cratic candidate for the Presidency before
he was informed by an ambushed foe that
no man whose first name is Claude will
ever get a vote for President in this
country.
A DETEEMINED TIGHT.
With the exception of Grove L. Johnson
those of the California delegation in Con
gress who have appeared before the House
Committee on Pacific Roads have made a
splendid fight agaiust the passage of a
funding bill by Congress. They have done
this in spite of the harrying to which they
were subjected by the members of the
committee, whose friendly attitude toward
the railroads is all too apparent. ; The ad
dresses by Messrs. Bowers and Barham â
the one the hard-headed argument of a
practical man, the other the cool, searching
analysis of a lawyer â were masterpieces in
their way.
On Thursday Representative Hilborn
made a point in addressing the committee
that it seems impossible to answer. It
was that the debt of the Central Pacific
cannot be extended beyond 1911, because
under the law of California the company
will absolutely cease to exist at that time,
without any possibility under the law of
reviving it.
Representative Bowers made another
point of great force. Quoting the last re
port of the Secretary of the Interior, he
showed that the Central Pacific has earned
an annual net profit equal to 6 per cent on
the entire amount which the Government
has paid and would have to pay if it dis
chareed the first-mortgage debt. Hence
he takes the ground that as a simple busi
ness proposition it would pay the Govern
ment to refund the two debts, represented
by the first and second mortgages, with
bonds bearing a rate of 3 per cent interest,
and foreclose.
It may De that all these earnest efforts
will prove futile in the committee and that
the Smith bill, extending the debt 100
years and providing for an interest of 1
per cent for the first ten years and 2 per
cent for the remaining ninety years, will
be presented to the Houae with the rec
ommendation that it pass. This possibil
ity does not mean that the House will
pass the bill or that the efforts of Cali
fornia to defeat it should relax in the
smallest degree. Meanwhile those of our
Congressmen who are fighting for the State
will be remembered in the years to come.
This ia a consideration which Congress
man Johnson might ponder with profit.
The situation in Kentucky is becoming
daily more serious for the railroad. Sena
tor Goebel is pushing his bill vacating the
Southern Pacific Company's charter, and
the threatened company Detrays its alarm
by dividing its lobby so much needed at
Washington and sending some of its
strongest members to Frankfort.
The work at home proceeds valorously.
The differences at first appearing in the
committee appointed to draft a mamorial
to Congress have disappeared, and the
voice of California will issue from it in
vigorous tones.
A SEVEEE AEEAIGNMENT.
The statement of affairs in the Trans
vaal, which John Hays Hammond has
sent to Senator John P. Jones, is virtually
an appeal to all civiJized nations to take
cognizance of the low character of the
Transvaal Government, and interfere to
adjust its operations so as to bring them
in accord with the principles of common
humanity. He discloses a state of affairs
almost incredible in a government con
ducted by a people belonging to one of the
oldest and finest races in the world, and
gives sufficient reasons for its radical re
organization or total extinction.
In effect he shows that, although the
Government professes to be a republic,
the franchise is so restricted as to prevent
participation in its affairs by more than
half its residents; that these unenfran
chised persons are the developers and
wealthniakers of the republic and the
most progressive, enlightened and law
loving of its peopie; that, besides being
denied the franchise, they are mercilessly
taxed, denied the privileges of the national
schools and otherwise disgracefully dis
criminated against; that the Government
is corrupt and' its administration ineffi
cient, and that favored monopolies are
created to the injury of the people.
Recognizing this terrible condition of
affairs the foreigners organized a reform
movement. Its proceedings and inten
tions were open and undisguised, as is
shown by the fact that it made an appeal
to the Boer Legislature for redress ot the
prevalent wrongs. This petition was
treated with contempt. While this was
going on, the grounds for the agitation
being strictly constitutional and the mem
bers of the movement pledged to uphold
the Government in any event. Jameson
made his unsuccessful raid. Thereupon
sixty foreigners, all of whom had belonged
to the reform committee and had pledged
themselves to support the Government,
were arrested and charged with high
treason and sedition, and are to be tried on
these charges in venal courts moved by a
bitter sentiment of hostility toward the
suspects.
It would hardly be possible to make a
more terrible arraignment than this. It is
not a sufficient defense of the Boer Gov
ernment to say that if foreigners do not
like the Transvaal they may keep away,
or that the Boers have the inherent right
to place any restrictions they please on
the franchise. No civilized Government,
whether republic or monarchy, has the
right to conduct, its affairs as those of the
Transvaal are managed, and a citizen of
any civilized country has the right to ex
pect there the just and humane treatment
that all other civilized nations are ready to
accord. Hammond's arraignment is an
appeal not alone to our Government, but
to every other, to interfere in Transvaal
affairs and enforce the adoption of civil
ized principles of government.
A NEW DEPAKTMENT.
The bill proposed by the National Asso
ciation of Manufacturers, to be introduced
in Congress, providing for the creation of a
department of manufactures and com
merce, has the highest merit. It would
undoubtedly fill a place in the Government
not less important than the DeDartmentof
Agriculture, and might be even more bene
ficial, inasmuch as our manufactures ars
exposed to even fiercer competitions and
greater vicissitudes than our rural indus
tries, and therefore have a keener need of
governmental supervision and help.
More than that, a comparison of the
censuses of ISBO and 1890 shows that while
the capital invested in manufactures in
1880 was $2,790,272,000, it was increased to
$6,524,475,000 in 1890, this gain alone of
$3,700,000,000 being almost equal to the
total value of agricultural products in 1890.
In 1890 the products turned out by manu
facturers were worth $9,370,107,624, against
$3,800,000,000 wortu of agricultural prod
ucts. That is to say, if there is one reason
why there should be a department of agri
culture there are nearly three why there
should be the proposed new department.
in the work of framing the bill the
whole scope of commerce should be con
sidered. We have a scheme of laws of
which the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion is the focus and which recognizes a
necessity for the regulation of interstate
transportation. The commission has done
much â in fact, for its practical achieve
ments it easily stands first among the
commissions created by Congress. But
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
interstate transportation is by no means
all of commerce. It is conceivable that the
proposed Department of Manufactures
and Commerce might not only be made to
exercise the functions of the Interstate
Commerce Commission on a broader and
stronger basis, but that it might also be
empowered to foster the foreign commerce
of the country. This is a phase of our
National development that has never re
ceived adequate attention, and California
particularly has a deep interest in the sub
ject. _______^___â.
NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE.
In the Senate on Thursday two memora
ble speeches were made during the debate
on the Senate silver substitute for the
House bond bill. These were made by
Mr. Perkins of California and Mr. Mitchell
of Oregon. Mr. Perkins' remarks were a
spirited refutation of the charge made by
a New York paper that California was not
a silver State, it being necessary only to
quote a resolution adopted by the last Cali
fornia Legislature declaring unqualifiedly
for the free coinage of silver at a ratio of
16 to 1.
Mr. Mitchell's speech was one of those
rousing appeals to the patriotic sense of
our people that are too seldom heard in
the Senate. He took the ground, while
advocating the silver substitute, that
the welfare of the country does not
demand the issuance of bonds or the
perpetuation of the single cold standard.
He said that it was time this country
should assert its independence, establish
its own monetary system and cease bend
ing the knee in subservience to any policy
that Great Britain might choose to adopt,
maintaining the doctrine that we have the
power so to do. The following extract
from his speech will live in the history of
the country:
"Has the more than century of our Na
tional life, with all the prestige and in
fluence and power and glory that have
come to us in our unparalleled progress as
a Nation, and in the development of a
civilization than which none so grand has
ever existed since the creation of man,
still left us a poor, weak dependent on the
British crown? Because England, since
1816, has adhered to the single gold stand
ard in the interest of the gold-brokers of
Lombard street, are we to forever bend the
supple knee, acknowledge our impotency
as a Nation, and surrender the preroga
tives that ought rightfully to attach to a
free and independent people? In my
judgment, the United States, as a Nation,
in whatever aspect considered â whether
nationally, intellectually, scientifically,
commercially or financially â stand, or, at
least, should stand, in the very vanguard
of nations; pre-eminent in every element
of greatness, in every aspect of grandeur,
in every attribute of glory and in every
essential or sovereign power. Resource
ful in physical elements of every conceiv
able character in a measure and to an ex
tent unparalleled by any country on the
globe, if she will but assert herself as be
comes her as the proud, aggressive, inde
pendent leader of nations, New York, and
not London, will become the clearing
house of the world, and our country, pre
eminent over all, will no longer be slave,
either in commercial or monetary sense,
but the distinctive and primal sovereign,
the imperial master and dictator, finan
cially as well as commercially, among all
the nations of the world."
The imperious policy of England has re
ceived another shock in the remarkable
speech made by A. J. Balfour recently at a
meeting of his constituents at Manches
ter, England. In the course of his re
marks he said:
"I may perhaps add that all this diffi
culty in connection with the cotton duties
would never have risen, nor would it even
have been needful to put a duty, an im
port duty, at all in India upon Lancashire
manufactures had it not been for the un
happy fall in the gold value of silver,
which has been productive of such im
mense misfortunes to trade and commerce
in every part of the world. Once again I
express emphatically ruy own private per
sonal conviction that it is a misfortune for
this country, a misfortune for India and a
misfortune for the world that the British
public is so slow to follow the teaching of
economic science and to throw itself
heartily into the policy of an interna
tional agreement on monetary subjects."
It can hardly be doubted that such an
assertion of National independence as that
upon which Senator Mitchell insists would
have the instant effect of bringing Eng
land to the terms which Mr. Balfour pro
poses. It is altogether inconsistent with
our National pride, independence and
wealth of native resources that we should
cringe under the financial lash wielded by
Lombard street and so vigorously laid
upon our backs by the reflex and embodi
ment of that interest in this countryâ the
President of the United States.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
Conspicuous among the special features
of to-morrow's Call will be a stetch of C.
P. Huntington's boyhood career, gathered
from the very few associates of his early
life who still survive at Poverty Hollow,
Conn. There are only one or two, and
they are very old, but their memory of
those days of sixty to seventy years ago is
very clear, and they tell exceedingly inter
esting stories of the harum-scarum young
giant who was the champion wrestler of
the Hollow and who lived to become the
great railroad magnate of the West. There
seems to be no sentiment in Mr. Hunting
ton's composition, for he has never visited
his old home since he left it with a stock
of whisky for California in 1849, and only a
stone that was too big to move marks the
site of the house in which he was born.
Charles D. South has a stirring patriotic
poem entitled "The Man-o'-War's Man's
Dream," depicting a ghostly naval engage
ment off the Heads.
A contribution entitled "Foreign Deco
rations Worn by San Franciscans" will be
found particularly interesting. #
Other special features of value will ap
pear, besides the regular features peculiar
to the Sunday issue. Among the latter
may be mentioned the pas;e devoted to re
cent advancement in science and art, the
literary department, fashion and society
chronicles, the theatrical world, the chil
dren's page and others.
The Sunday Call is perfectly suited as a
vehicle through which Californians may
inform their Eastern friends concerning
the State.
A petition ha 3 been addressed to Con
eress by John Conway of Mariposa County
urging the repeal of the Yosemite Park
law on the ground that miners and set
tlers who could formerly obtain timber
free of cost are now compelled to buy it at
high prices from lumber companies or let
their improvements go to waste. The pe
titioner further asserts that the law has
not served to preserve the forests, and in
fact has been of no public benefit what
ever.
The claim of the Cleveland Leader that
in the Bepublican National Convention
McKiuley will receive three-fourths of all
the votes cast on the first ballot leads to
the suspicion that there is a scheme on
foot to take a ballot before any body arrives
at the convention except the Ohio men.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"The reason I am in California," said Coun
cilman B. F. McLain of Wichita, "is because I
want to make a new business location. I have
been in the lumber business in Wichita for
some years, and my friend, S. R. Oliver, who
is also a business man of Wichita, wants to go
in business some place here, too.
"Los Angeles, which we visited, is a fine city.
I don't know but it's good enough, for us. We
like thia City, too, but before we get through
looking we will visit Stockton ani Sacra
mento.
"There is no use talking, there is vastly more
money in circulation in California than in
Kansas. I noticed this at once. You may
think you have hard times here, but you don't
really know anything about them. The Cali
tornians buy more luxuries than any other
people I ever saw. They dress better, go to the
theaters, see the races, travel extensively and

live belter every way than the peopie east of
the RocKy Mountains do. They Beem to have
more leisure, too.
"Now, if they didn't have the money they
couldn't do all this. You see dollars here
where you see dimes and quarters in many
other States, and the dollars here are no harder
to get than the dimes and quarters there. A
good many oi the people here don't know how
well off they are.
"Wichita is a good town. It has been a very
good town. But with hard times all over
Kansas and that entire region, and the popula
tion of the town down from fully 40,000 to
23,000, there in a hard road now to live. There
is no money there, so something has to be done.
"The different political creeds that have
been espoused in Kansas for the past six* or
eight years have done the business for us. If
we had stuck to a consistent course, and stuck
to Republicanism, as we did lor so many years,
we would have been all right."
Mr. AlcLain and Mr. Oliver are both old resi

family were at one time ranked among the
millionaires of that city.
J. A. Filcher, secretary of the State Board of
Trade, had a select audience of friends who
congratulated him yesterday on his return
from the Atlanta Fair. Wnile in the sunny
South Mr. Filcher observed many peculiari
ties of the people, his newspaper instinct as
serting itself in various directions, with the
result that ho has brought back with him
quite a collection of good stories, which others
in all probability would have passed as mat
ters hardly worth narrating.
His little audience yesterday were newspaper
men and one or two public men, who thor
oughly appreciated Mr. Filcher's anecdotes of
the South. .
"Moonshine," said he; "do any of you know
what It isâ moonshine?
"I know you all think you know what it is.
But you can get moonshine in broad daylight
only down there in Georgia.
â¢'Moonshine knocks the pins from under
California wine down in that country. It is
found everywhere you go, and appears to be a
household product.
"'How much does it cost?" I asked a Geor
gian.
"'Well, you get a bushel of corn for 50
cents,' he replied.
" 'Water costs nothing.'
"'lt don't cost nothing for labor. All you
want is a nigga to keep the pot a boiling round
thar. That's jess all, and you have three gal
lons of moonshine. Three gallons from a
busnel at 50 cents. Thai's three gallons of
good stuff for a half, ain't it?'
"And that fellow grinned all over. I thought
liquor was cheap enough at such a price, and
saw how the people could have moonshine in
every house and cabin."
"But what is moonshine ?"
"Whisky that pays no duty."
" 'How do you keep it without being caught
by the revenue men?' I asked this fellow.
" 'Keep it? We've never more than a gallon
in any one place.'
"Can you tell mo what chance wine has
against moonshine?
"That reminds me, too, of what happened
when we were packing the exhibit. There was
some wine lying round and I gave it to the
colored workmen to revive them, for the work
was trying and had to be done rapidly.
"I lost the corkscrew, and wanted badly to
open a bottle for two industrious fellows who
were getting tired. I got my pocket-knife and
cut the cork out as far as I could and then
started to push the rest of the cork into the
bottle. I did so, but my knife followed it.
"A big colored man who did not know that
the knife was in the bottle was the flm to get
a drink. He opened his mouth until I thought
he would let the whole bottle down, but he
had scarcely taken the first gulp when that
knife caught in his throat. He was almost
frightened out of his wits, but we saved him
from a fit by getting out the knife.
" 'Snakes alive!' he exclaimed, 'I thougnt it
was something that grew in California wine.'
"It was his first experience with the native
article."
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
OUR NATIONAL BANKS.
Once Popular, but Now They Abouse Hos
tility.
To the Editor of the Morning Call-Sin: As it
is conceded by all intelligent men that the
financial issue is to be an important factor,
and by many the leading factor, in the ap
proaching Presidential campaign, all accurate
information, such as no one will think of call
ing in question on any branch of this great
issue, cannot fail to be valuable to all intelli
gent and honest voters. At the present time
there is a great deal of adverse criticism in
Congress and a large number of the news
papers against our National banks, and quite
naturally they are fighting: back with equal
vigor. As the campaign progresses it is highly
probable that this warfare will occupy a large
share of the public attention. In a cool and
deliberate mood let us try to get at the facts,
and thereby become qualified to form a correct
judgment on this branch of the financial issue.
Probably nine out of every tan business men
in San Francisco regard the Bank of England
as just what its name implies, and will be sur
prised when informed that it i* in fact a pri
vate banking incorporation. Our "National"
banks are also private corporations, and "Na
tional 1 only in name, except in so far as they
enjoy certain special privileges by favor of the
Government over private banks, so called,
iney are based on National bonds, and if there
were no National bonds there could be no Na
tional banks. It is quite natural, therefore,
mat they should favor a large issue of National
bonas, and lone-time bonds, too, for a consid
erable portion of the bonds issued during the
\\ ar of the Rebellion have matured and many
more are about to fall due, after which they
cease to bear interest and are liable to be paid
on at any time if the country is prosperous.
Ihe continued existence of the' National banks
depends upon new issues of National bonds.
lne system under which these banks are or
ganized and their operations are conducted
may be thus stated : Half a dozen men who can
raise the sum of $100,000 agree to form a bank
corporation and each takes stock in itfpropor
tionate to xne money put in by each. They draw
up and sign incorporation "papers, pay over
their money, which is exchanged for green
backs, and with the greenbacks they buy
States Government bonds to the amount
of i}) 100,000. Now the law provides that these
bonds, bearing say 4 per cent interest, may bo
returned to the Government for safekeeping,
ana then the Government will issue $90,000
in bank notes to this new bank and print the
name of the bank on the bills. Iv a word the
bank gets back all but one-tenth of its capital,
paying l per interest on the $90,000 and
drawing 4 per cent interest from the Govern
ment on the -whole $100,000. They are now
ready for business, the Dank is opene'dand they
proceed to loan this $90,000 in their own bank
bills to individuals at from t) to 10 per cent,
these bankbills being redeemed by the Govern
ment if the bank should fail; but the Govern
ment does not repay depositors, and their sole
dependence is upon ihe bank itself for the
return of their money, and the bulk of the
business done by banks through loans and dis
counts is by the use of the money belonging to
depositors and not by the use of their own
capital, as a glance at the sworn statements of
bankers will at once demonstrate.
Three months ago, on October 30, 1895, the
Comptroller of the Currency reports that there
were 3712 of these National banks, with a total
capital of $657,100,000, and deposits by in
dividual to the amount of $1,701,653,000,
makine the available resources of these banks
$2,358,750,000, the deposits being more than
double the capital. Adding the surplus fund
oi.f -240,448,000, we have a combined total of
$2,605,200,000. By using all these combined
resources, they have loaned $2,041,846,000,
leaving on hand the sum of $563,636,000 with
which to meet the calls of depositors for the
sum of $1,701,653,000, or more than three
times the amount on hand. If a panic occurs
and less than one-third of the depositors call
for their money, they can be paid by taking
the last dollar out of the whole 3712 National
banks. Thus it is seen why the banks have to
close their doors the moment people loose
"confidence" in them, for it appears that more
than two-thirds of the banking business is done
on "confidence" or bank credit, and only one
depositor in three could possibly get his money
if but one in three should call for it on the
same day. It is not surprising that so many
banks fail, but that so few iail under euch
conditions.
The growing hostility to National banks is
not due, however, to occasional failures, but to
the fact that they have grown so rich and pow
erful as to exert an almost irresistible" in
fluence m politics, and are so successful in
electing their friends as Congressmen, Sena
tors and Presidents. No one believes that a
majority or a large minority of the American
people is opposed to the restoration of silver to
iree coinage, or desires the retirement of the
greenbacks by re-funding them in interest
bearing bonds, to be sold to bankers, that we
may have nine new bank notes to replace
every ten greenbacks now in circulation. The
people prefer the greenbacks which bear no in
terest, but, as before stated, the National
banks must all cease to exist in a few years un-<
less they can induce the President or Congress
to issue more bonds.

THE LITTLE COMFORTER.
I shnll not rail at fortune or at fate,
. While in the dark or light,
I hear a footstep pattering to the gate
That closes on the night.
.But for those little feet
Kach pathway shall be sweetâ
The sad stormis rimmed with rainbows,
Where the paths of angels meet!
I shall not rail a.t fortune or at fate
While under Love's own skies
My little queen walks where the roses wait
Aril wins me with her eyes,
For in those eyes I seem
To read the storms tn:tt stream
On bright celestial meadows where the angels sing
ami dream !
I shall not rail nt fortune or at fate
While stilt I feel the brat
Of her glad heart, and in life's twilight latÂ«
Her rosy lips and sweet!
Lovely as still thou art,
Kest on my heart, sweetheart !
Till God's white angel smiling kiss lips and lives
apart !
Thank L. Stastton in Atlanta Constitution.
LADY'S YOKE WITH EPAULETTES.
Here is shown a perfectly plain waist, which
is made to appear very elaborate and dressy by
a simple accessory. A yoke like this can be
worn with any waist, and is a great help when
one's wardrobe is limited.
The pattern is cat with the straps in one
piece with the yoke. The epaulettes are sewed
on at the shoulder.
A waist of plain cloth may be made very
stylish with trimmings of the new Cashmere
velveteen cut after this model. The edges may
be turned in or simply bound with ribbon.
Another charming way to remodel a plain
vraist is to have this trimming of a contrasting
color in clothâ say a black waist with mijrn
onette, green cloth. This may be spangled
along the edges, or be bordered by a fringe of
fur.
Plaid silt is also used over plain clothes or
silks.
Flouncing may be used for the yoke and
epaulettes, with band lace for the straps. Or
the yoke or straps may be cut in one of piece
lace, using a highly colored silk for lining.
Black lace makes a very effective trimming
for almost any waist.
Black net, plain or the dotted, may be used,
the edges turned in and trimmed with green or
black spangles sewn on close together. If the
dotted net is used, a spangle may be sewn on
each dot.
Piece embroidery can also be utilized for
such a trimming.
The natural colored grass linen or batiste
makes a very stylish accessory, and is not ex
pensive. Either the plain or the all-over em
broidered ones can be used.
Plain white lawn or batiste are very dainty.
All the edges to be trimmed with the narrow
est of yellow Valenciennes lace. The collar to
be of row upon row of lace on a plain strip of
the goods.
Ribbon two and a half inches wide joined
together by strips of embroidery or lace the
same width can- be used, with the lace laid
over the ribbon for the straps.
VIEWS OF WESTERN EDITORS.
The Valley Road First.
Hanford Democrat.
California needs the Nicaragua canal, but it
will do her no good if constructed in such a
way as to be gobbled by the allied railroad
corporations. Nor will it accomplish much to
relieve the people of the interior of California
without the construction of competing local
lines of railroad. The Valley road first; the
Nicaragua canal afterward.
Only During Good Behavior.
Angels Camp Echo.
It is all right lor the South American republics
to hail Uncle Sam as the father of the American
family, but they should remember that he will
be father to them only so long as they behave
themselves. The United States does not under
take to defend the little but bellicose states
every time they get into trouble, without re
speci to the merits of their quarrels.
Honor the Teachers.
Trnckee Kepubiican.
Raise your hat reverently when you pass a
teacher of the primary school. She is the great
angel ot the universe. She takes the young
hopefuls fresh from the home nest, full of
pouts and passions, takes a whole carload of
these little anarchists, and at once puts them
in the way of being good ana useful citizens.

Expensive Schoolbookg.
Vacaville Keporter.
We do not think the work done in the prepar
ation of the State series of schoolbooks has
been satisfactory. In fact it is so poor that
they have Deen discarded wherever possible,
and if used at all have been used under protest,
and in connection with other schoolbooks.
We do not know wnat the costs have been up
to date, but they have been in excess of any
reasonable necessity.
THE YOUNGEST DRUMMER.
There is a good story behind the bill which
Representative Dick Blue has introduced di
recting the Secretary of War to muster and dis
charge John W. Brooks as a drummer, says the
Washington correspondent of the St. Louis
Johnnie Brookes, the Youngest Drummer
in the War.
Globe-Democrat. Mr. Brooks is a lawyer now
at Ellsworth, Kans. Thirty-two years ago he
was Johnnie Brooks, aged 9, the youngest
drummer in the United States army. He was
too young to be mustered, but he wore the uni
form, went upon duly at all times the same as
the other musicians, obeying the orders of his
regiment, the Fifth Veteran Reserve Corps
He served from July, 18U3, to August, 1865,
and when his regiment was mustered out
Johnnies father was a lifer and the boy beat
the drvm.
Twenty affidavits accompany the bill. They
are made by members of Company E, and tell
how faithfully Johnnie was on duty, turning
out day and night, winter and summer, to beat
the calls. When the remains of President Lin
coln reached Indianapolis on the way from
Washington to Springfield, and were taken
from the car to the Capitol to lie in state,
Johnnie Brooks was there with his drum beat*
ing the dead march.
The muster and discharge will make Mr.
Brooks a veteran de jure, ea he is already de
facto. They will put him on the muster rolls
of his regiment and allo- him the pay to
whiuli he is entitled for the two years' service
he rendered. The whole Kansas delegation is
taking an interest in the bill, and it will doubt
less go through. The father of Mr. Brooks is
still living, and is a resident of Firth, Nebr.

Health Uepartinent Statistics.
For the first time in the history of San Fran
cisco the records of the Health Department
have shown a birth rate greater than the death
rate.' The figures for January make it appear
that there were 513 births and 493 deaths. Of
the children born 209 were males and 254
females, while the deaths were 309 males and
184 females. This brings to light again- the
greater number of men than women . who â  die
in this City. One hundred and twenty-five
more males than females died, while only live
more males were born, so that the decrease was
120 males. . . ~ . .

SCHOONERS IN COLLISION
The Wind Died Out and Three
Drifted Together Off Lime
Point.
NO SERIOUS DAMAGE WAS DONE
One Vessel Lost Her Sails, Another
Her Bulwarks and the Third
Her Rigging.
There was a mix-up among the lumber
schooners s'esterday morning. A fleet of
them came sailing in, with a fair wind and
the tide in their favor. Off Lime Point
the trouble began, and soon three of the
vessels were all in a tangle. In conse
quence the Annie Gee had her mainsail
torn to pieces and lost her ru Ider box; the
Helen Kunball had her bulwarks torn
away, and the Ruby A. Cousins had her
forward rigging ruined. The steam
schooner Point Arena fortunately came
along in time and separated the vessels be
fore any more damage was done.
When the tide began to How yesterday
morning there was a fair northerly breeze,
and six schooners were outside awaiting

just such a state of affairs to make port.
They were the Nettie Low from Point
Reyes, Seven Sisters from Coos Bay,
Annie Gee, Helen N. Kimball, Gem and
Ruby A. Cousins from Grays Harbor. All
had "experienced very rouKh weather dur
ing the run down the coast, and the Gem
was leaking badly. The bar was crossed
in safety ana all went well until Lime
Point was reached. There the wind fell
light and the schooners started on a drift
ing match. The tide gradually brought
them together, and at one time it looked
as though all six of them would come to
gether.
The Annie Gee and the Helen Kimball
were tne firs* to get into trouble, and
about ten minutes later the Ruby Cousins
drifted down on them both. The Seven
Sisters was within a dozen boats' lencth of
the trio when the steamer Point Arena
came along and separated the bunch. The
Gem, which was leaking badly, was towed
to Main-street wharf, and as soon as her
cargo of lumber is discharged she will go
on the drydock for repairs. Captain Olson,
the commander, is the youngest skipper
on the coast. He is not yet 20 years of a^e
and yet he has been a master of lumber
schooner; for over a year. He has great
faith in his schooner, and says she will
weather many a storm that will wreck
other vessels before her time comes.
ALONG THE WATER FEONT.
Captain Addison of the Falls of Afton Had an
Exciting Time With His Watchman.
The Falls line of sailing vessels seem to
be very unfortunate in the matter of night
watchmen. On the last voyage to this
port the captain of the Falis of Halladale
was nearly killed by the man appointed to
keep a good lookout. He drew a revolver
and perforated the door of the skipper's
room in a vain attempt to take the cap
tain's life. Last Thursday night William
Kelly, the night watchman on the Falls of
Afton, made an attempt upon the life of
Captain Addison. The latter boarded the
ship at 10 p. m. ana Kelly started to give
him a Piece of his mind. The captain,
seeing the man was drunk, stood it for a
few moments and then called the mate. A
free light ensued, with the result that the
mate was "laid out" and Kelly was put in
irons. Yesterday morning Kelly was re
leased, and seeing Captain Addison and
Second Mate Williams talking on the
wharf he picked up a heavy broom handle
and made a dash at them. A lively race
over Main-street wharf ensued, but Kelly
finally gave up the chase. Afterward he
had a talk with the captain and the latter
agreed to pay him off at 11 a. m. to-day.
Kelly is a good sailor, but ever since the
ship has been at the dock he has bee
drinking and Captain Addison thinks h
is now partly out of his mind.
The bark Mohican, which recently arrivec
from New York via Honolulu, is no
being fitted out for the island trade. He
cabins are being put in order, a donke
engine is to be erected forward and th
vessel is to gel a general overhauling. I
a few days she will be ready to receh
freight for Honolulu, and a' number o
passengers have already taken passage o
her.
The old ship Louis Walsh made a re
markable run from Callao to Port Town
send. She made the trip in thirty-seven
days, and many old skippers say the time
has never been beaten. "A fair*win<i and
blowing half a gale all tne way" is the
captain's brief report of the voyace. The
Loui3 Walsh is one of the old-timers, but
it appears that she has not lost any of her
speea.
The bark Fresno will have a new com
mander wnen she sails for Hoiioiulu in a

CAPTAIN VIVEN DEAD.
An Old Army Officer of This City Ex
pires In New Yorkâ His Widow
Will Return.
Captain J. L. Viven of the Twelfth
United States Infantry, assigned to re
cruiting duty on Third avenue, near
Eighth street, New York City, died from
heart failure, following asthma, at the
Castle Hotel on Thursday, January 9.
Captain Viven was enlisted at the begin
ning of the rebellion in the First Regiment
of California Cavalry, and was afterward
transferred to a regiment of cavalry in
New Mexico. He was appointed as second
lieutenant in the regular army on February
23, 1866, and was promoted to be first lieu
tenant on March 31, 1873.
Captain Viven, who was born in Albany,
N. V., was to have been promoted, to trie
rank of major and placed upon the retired
list at the close of this year. He leaves a
widow, but no children.
His body was taken to Washinetou for
burial.
Captain Viven was well known in local
military and social circles. He married
about seven years ago Miss May Kenney
of this City, and the weading was quite a
notable society event.
The widow is the daughter of Mr. Ken
ney, for a long time connected with *\. L.
Bancroft & Co. as a| partner in the firm.
She will shortly return to this coast to live
with her married brother in Los Angeles,
who is cashier in one of the banks there.
A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA.
Brilliant Debut Made by a Local
Concert Organiza
tion.
James Hamilton Howe and Bernhard
Mollenhauer Are Its
Originators.
A brilliant debut was made yesterday
\ afternoon in Golden Gate Hail by the San
| Francisco Symphony Orchestra. In fact
the new organization, which is directed by
James Hamilton Howe and has Bernhard
j Mollenhauer for its concert-master, proved
a surprise even to its best wishers.
The instruments in-the orchestra are cx
i cellently balanced and the playing was
j marked by neatness, precision and a good
i deal of expression. In such excerpts as
j the prelude to the third act of "Lohen
| grin," for instance, where so frequently
| the brass drowns the springs, the balance
! of sound yesterday was always well pre
| eterved; and this was the case all through
; the concert.
Thy programme was a popular one, as it
is not intended to introduce a symphony
till the third concert.
The rirst number consisted of Mozart's
overture to ' Titus," which like the other
j selections was well played. Airs from
Gounod's "Faust" were charmingly ren
dered, and the brilliant, showy "Arra
| gonaise," from Massenet's "Cid," was
j played with so much verve that the audi-
I ence insisted on its repetition. The over
ture to "Lohengrin" was carefully ren
dered, and the Gillet and Waldteufel
numbers called forth much applause.
Bernhard Mollenhauer and S. Homer
Henley were the soloists. The former
played a violin solo consisting of the "Tv
ne m'aime pas" and the toreador sone
from "Carmen," covered with florid musi
cal embroiuery, all of which Mr. Mollen
hauer executed with an ease and fluency
which showed that such exacting work
was a mere trifle to him.
8. Homer Henley's fine voice was heard
to good effect in "Is Not This Word Like
Fire," from the "Elijah." Hie lower notes
were occasionally inaudible, owing to the
orchestral accompaniment, but i: was only
a note here and tnere that was too low for
him ; his tones in the end of the aria were
full and resonant, and he sang with true
oratorio dignity and expression. Two
j songs by Hamilton Howe were also well
| rendered by Mr. Henley, the composer ac
! comDanyinc his work. The "Aye Maria"
i proved to be a graceful jittlc song, and
I "The Sea" was an effective composition,
! with a pretty flowing accompaniment.
Both Bernhard Mollenhauer and Homer
i Henley received warm encores, though
| they refused to respond otherwise than by
! bowing.
Altogether the debut of the San Fran
j cisco Symphony Orchestra covered the
I conductor and the concert-master with
i glory. The next concert takes place on
the 7th inst.
Hullmantel's Unpaid Alimony.
Barnard Hullmantel has been ordered to jail
until he pays his wife the alimony he owes
her at the rate of $15 a month for over a year.
He refused to obey the order of the court to
that effect when the decree of divorce was en
tered, and he has refused ever since to pay it,
so lie Â«ns cited ou an order to show cause why
lie should not be punished for contempt of
court, and as a result he has been sent to jail,
there to rcmaiii mail he pays.

SOLD FOR A MERE SONG
Supervisors Vote the Garbage.
Crematory Franchise to
L. V. Merle.
HIS BID WAS THE LOWEST.
The City Will Lose Much Money if
the Action Is Ratified by the
Board.
If its action is ratified the Health and
Police Committee of the Board of Super
visors has practically made a gift to L. V.
Merle of a franchise that should be worth
a great many thousand dollars to this City.
Some time ago when the annual agita
tion over the necessity of a garbage crema
tory to dispose of the City's refuse was
begun, a resolution was passed by the
board advertising for bids for the privilege
of erecting a plant and disposing of the
garbage for a term of fifty years. Three
offers were received, which differed so
widely that there was apparently no ques
fion as to which was the highest.
F. E. Sharon, who was supposed to repre
sent the Sharon Estate company, bid $2510
cash, 2 per cent of the gross receipts for
the first fifteen years and 5 per cent for the
remaining thirty-five years.
A. it. Skelly offered $1105 and 1 per
cent of the gross receipts for the first fif
teen years, 2 per cent for the second fifteen
years and 3 per cent for the remaining
twenty years.
L. V. Merle offered $5500 in cash without
any other consideration. Each of the bid
ders agreed to erect a plant to cost not
In view of the fact that in Eastern cities,
where garbage crematories are operated,
they are made to pay immense profits, not
only to their owners, but to the munici
palities where they are erected, it was
supposed that the Health and Police Com
mittee, which was given in charge of the
matter, would exercise extraordinary care
in investigating the offers and selecting
that which would be of the most advantage
to the City. The attention of the mem
bers of the committee was called to the
fact that immense quantities of ammonia,
manure and other marketable products
would be taken from the refuse during the
process of cremation, and that the fran
chise had received ah added Value in this
City from the fact that it was recently dis
covered that a compound which is death
to the vine pest could be manufactured
from some of the garbage.
They were shown figures which prove
that in one Eastern city where a garbage
crematory was erected under similar con
ditions by a private concern at a cost of
$350,000 the plant had paid for itself in
three years.
In spite of all this, at its meeting yester
day the committee decided to recommend
the awarding of the franchise to L. V.
Merle, whose bid was generally conceded
to be the lowest.
Under the Sharon bid, or even that of
Skelly, it is believed that the City would
have derived a profit of many thousands
of dollars a year, while under the one ac
cepted all that the City will ever receive
will be the $5500 mentioned in the bid.
The franchise is considered to be partic
ularly valuable from the fact that garbage
collectors are requited to deliver their loads
at the crematory and are also compelled to
pay 20 cents for every load so delivered.
When the committee convened yester
day Attorney R. B. Mitchell appeared for
F. E. Sharon, and asked that the franchise
be given to his client as his bid was pal
pably the highest.
'â¢Mr. Sharon," he said, "offers $2510
cash, and, besides, 2 per cent of the gross
receipts for the first fifteen years, and 5
per cent on the gross receipts for each suc
ceeding year of the remaining thirty-five.
We have furnished a bond cuaranteeing
to erect a plant at a cost of $100,000, with a
capacity of 250 tons a day. Ujider the
| specifications our receipts will be such that
| tne City cannot get less than $109,000 in
the first fifteen years, and may get vastly
more. Under this bid the City should get
from $500,000 to $1,000,000 out of the fran
chise in the fifty-year term. That is a
very moderate estimate. We are prepared
to build the works at once."
Mr. Mitchell was given no intimation
I whether or not his client would receive
j the privilege and he left without learning
the determination of the committee.
There was apparently an understanding
regarding the maUer, however, for almost
without discussion and by a unanimous
vote of the three Supervisors present â
I Benjamin, Morganstern and Kine â it was
decided to recommend the Merle bid for
I acceptance.
It is said that Mr. Sharon will not allow
his bid to be rejected without a legal bat
tle, as he claims that the franchise was to
j go to the highest bidder and can prove
I that his is the highest.
Before the matter was disposed of the
Merchants' Association, represented by
J. Richard Freud, appeared and asked
that all bids be rejected and new ones ad
vertised for, as the body he represented
had recently investigated the matter and
had found the profits to be immense. As
the association has the street sweeping
contracts, he thought it would be able to
handle the garbage question also. He
was informed that the committee had ad
vertised for bids in the regular way and
did not desire to delay the matter further.
Spirit Tax Increase.
Chief Deputy Internal Revenup Collector
Loupe said yesterday that the 6pirit tax for
December amounted to $105,000, and that
there had been an increase of over $400,000 in
the revenue paid in this district for the last
half of 1595 over the corresponding six months
of 1894.
SELEY PLEADED GUILTY.
He Said He Was Intoxicated When He
Took Money From the Ruga
House.
A. W. Seley, who was charged with em
bezzlement for having made away with
about $1000 while he was cashier of the
Ruas House, came before Judge Wallace
yesterday. He pleaded guilty at once and
waived time for sentence, the only request
of his counsel being to be allowed to put
witnesses on the stand to testify as to his
character before his fall from grace.
William S. Young, proprietor of the
Russ House, was first called. He testified
that Seley had always held the best of
characters and had considerable money in
bis care at various times. William Bar
man, a stockbroker and commission man,
told how Seley had worked for some years
for nim and that he had given Seley an
absolute power of attorney to transact all
business for him. Seley had between $100,
--000 and $150,000 pass through his hands
during his service with Barman and bis
accounts were always correct.
Seley himself was then called and ques
tioned by the court. He said it was drink
that did it. He told now three packages
of money had been placed in his caie and
he was warned particularly to look out for
them. He said he was under the influence
of liquor that night and when he took the
money home he kept it.
Judge Wallace remarked that it was a
very peculiar case, so he took the matter
under advisement until next Friday.
A YOUMG GIRL KESCUED.
Hnnnah Waiters, Formerly of Alametla,
Taken From the Tii eater Comlqae.
Hannah Waners, a very pretty 16-year
old girl, was arrested by Officer McMurray
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children* last night and taken to the
Girls' Training-school.
About two months ago the young girl
ran away from her home in Alameda. She
claims to have met an actor and by him
was induced to join the stars at the Theater
Comique on Stockton street, where she has
been posing for several weeks as a "queen
ol Bong and dance."
ASKS AN INVESTIGATION.
The Board of Health Called on to
Investigate Mrs. Bruner's
Charges.
Dr. Bunnell Talks Plainly to the Lady
Who Has Caused All the
Trouble.
Dr. Weil is determined not to rest under
the charges recently made by Mrs. Bruner,
in which she alleges a general laxness on
the part of the surgeons in charge of the
Receiving Hospital. Yesterday he ad
dressed the following letter to the Board
of Health:
San Francisco, Cal., Jan. 31, 1895.
To the Honorable Board of HealthâGentle
men: The serious and most unfounded charges
recently made aeainst myself and the other
members of the City Receiving Hospital staff
Dy a Mrs. Bruner. member of the Women's
Civic Federation, compel me to ask your
honorable board for an immediate inv^sliga
gation of the matter.
Mrs. Bruner, in several newspaper articles,
accuses me of untruthfulness, the assistant
surgeons of neglect of duty and the steward of
forgery of the hospital records.
These charges have been brought before the
public at various times, and besides the per
sonal injury done to the staff, discredit the
institution in the eyes of the public and also
reflect on the Board of Health.
I therefore respectfully ask you honorable
body to examine and lay before the public
what truth there is in the charges. Most re
spectfully, int. c. Weil.
As soon as the Board of Health has in
vestigated the charges and made a report
it is Dr. Weil's intention to put into exe
cution his threat to have Mrs. Bruner ar
restea. Until the matter has been looked
into, however, he will take no further
action in the matter.
Yesterday about noon Mrs. Bruner
called at tne Receiving Hospital and was
looking over the register, when Dr. Bun
nell addressed her.
"I did not know who she was," aaid Dr.
Bunneil, "but I spoke courteously and
asked her if I could be of service to her.
She rather curtly replied, *I do not want
anything to do with you.' She then told
me that we did not tell the truth in this
place.
'I said some very plain things to her. I
told her that we would substantiate all
that we had said and would expect her to
do the same. I told her that we were not
responsible to her for our actions, but to
the Board of Health and the Grand Jury.
I told her that she was an irresponsible
party and had so proven herself. She was
amenable to neither rhyme nor reason.
"As an evidence of how responsible she
is, it is a fact that she did not know the
date of her visit to the hospital. The presi
dent of the Woman's Civic Federation re
pudiates all thai M.s. Bruner has said in
the papers. The Civic Federation, said
Mrs. French to me, came not as an inves
tigating committee, but to see what good
they could do."
THE PLANT NICOTINE.
Lecture by Dr. C. N. Ellinwood Before
the Student* of Cooper Medi
cal College.
Dr. C. N. Ellinwood, in his lecture on
"Tobacco" at Cooper Medical College
last evening, very aptly beean his re
marks with the Arab lable of the origin of
the great narcotic:
A frozen serpent warmed by the prophet
swore by Allah that it would bite its bene
factor. The prophet would not permit the
breaking of an oath sworn by Allah and let the
ungrateful snake bite him. But he sucked the
venom from his wound and spat it upon the
ground and from that spot immediately sprang
up the tobacco plant, which combines in itself
the venom of the serpent and the compassion
of the prophet.
Tho result of tobacco using, no matter In
what form, is the same â impaired appetite and
digestion, excessive nervous irritability, mus
cular tremor, palpitation of the heart and
menial disturbances, as shown in diminished
power of continuity of thought and impaired
judgment. In youth tobacco-users are low in
the standard of mental and physical vigor.
Suicidal is it to the student to use the stupefy
ing drug. His studies are harder and the
knowledge obtained sooner forgotten.
The system of the excessive smoker finally
absorbs a greater amount of this poison ai
deadly as prussic acid than can be rapidly
eliminated, and there is a failing all along the
Hue of the bodily organs.
Take the sailor, who is always an excessive to
bacco-user, and none are so prone to aneurism
from the weakening of the artery walls. He is
poorly nourished and further handicapped by
the tobacco habit. In a similar way the brain
worker finds his heart and blood-vessel im
paired by habitual nicotine, and finally paral
ysis, apoplexy or dementia are linble to result.
Even in the mild user of tobacco, when only
a soothing and generally harmless effect is ob
served, the habit is only an indulgence and not
a necessity to the system. The drug has no use
in nature and is discarded as dangerous in
medicine.

CALIFORNIA'S MISSIONS
Bryan J. Clinch Lectures Upon
That Entertaining Sub
ject.
FATHER YOBKE WILL SPEAK.
The Next Session of the Educational
Union, Monday Night, to Be
Favored.
Last night's literary* entertainment of
the Catholic Educational Union mid
winter series in Metropolitan Temple was
a lecture by Bryan J. Clinch on "The Mis
sions of California."
"It has always seemed to me that the
original pioneers of California were a bet
ter type of men than the pioneers of any
other part of the American continent,"
said the speaker in referring to the men
who came to California in the early part
of the eighteenth century. "Jesuits or
Franciscans, ihey came here not for their
own sake but for the sako of others."
The lecture began with the missions of
Lower California. The old Spaniards who
came to America in the sixteenth century
were acquainted with the peninsula of
California, but the land to the north was
unknown. The first expedition to Lower
California resulted in a report to the Vice
roy of Mexico that, in plain, terse language,
California was "no pood." After review
ing the political aspect of the expedition
Mr. Clinch came down to his subject. Tne
Lower California Indians were the poorest
on the North American continent.
Father Kuhn. one of the missionary
priests, discovered the Colorado and was
the first man to set foot in California. For
seventy years Jesuit missionaries labored
among the Indians of Lower California â
1697 to 17'J" â and in that time 7000 converts
were made. Those same missionaries
stood high in the scientific circles of Eu
rope, yet they came to the new land and
worked there, at the risk of their own
lives, for the sake of others. To-day may
be found in Lower California what is left
of those converted Indians, as good men
as may be found in civilized communities.
When in the end the Jesuits were ex
pelled from Mexico no charge was made,
no crime alleged; only the King of Spain,
in a jealous fit, ordered them driven out.
The Franciscans then came upon
the scene and took up the missions of
California. Father Juniperq Serra as
sumed the task, although he did bo in face
of the expulsion of his predecessors.
The lecturer said he had felt that Serra
was much the same kind of a man as the
fiist Archbishop- of San Francisco â Most
Rev. Joseph Alemany. Padre Serra at the
age of 40 started from his home in Majorca
for the Indian missions in Mexico. The
Spanish Government arranged with the
Franciscans to establish missions in Cali
fornia on the understanding, as demanded
by the priests, that the converted Indians
should be free men and their holdings in
land inviolable.
In 1767 the missionaries came to Califor
nia. How San Francisco received its name
proved to be an interesting point in the
lecture. The Franciscans had determined
to call Monterey after their patron saint,
but King Charles of Spain wanted the spot
called San Carlos de Monterey, after him
self, observing, "If the Franciscans want a
mission named after their patron saint
let them find a port for it." And the
padres trudged northward until they found
the bay of San Francisco.
The politicians of Mexico did for the
Franciscans what the King of Spain had
done for the Jesuits.
Taey said to the padres: "You have
done your work in California and we have
no further use for you. You may go."
So the missions were "secularized." There
were then twenty-one missions scattered
throughout California, and 30,000 Indians.
Rev. J. Byrne announced at the close of
the lecture that the next meeting of the
Educational Union and its friends would
be on Monday night, when the Rev.
Peter C. Yorke will address the audience.
At the mention of Father Yorke's name a
tumult of applause burst from the house.
The handclapping was enthusiastic and
did not cease even while people were leav
ing the hall.
MUSIC AS AN EDUCATOR
Will Follow the Model of Frank
Damrosch's New York
Classes.
Mrs. Bonnestell the Musical Director
of a Class at the Broadway
Grammar School.
A novel phase of college settlement
work will be inaugurated at the Broadway
Grammar School to-morrow afternoon.
The organization, to be known as the
Woman's Singing Class, will hold its first
session at 3p. m. The model of the new
organization is Frank Damroseh's popular
class in New York, where he carries into
practice his theory that music is the great
est of all media for the uplifting of the
uncultured classes. Accordingly he seeks
a union of the most refined with the less
fortunate men and women in chorus prac
tice of some of the best music.
Miss Jean Parker, principal of the
Broadway Grammar School, frequently
visited the Damrosch classes during a re
cent visit to New York, and was impressed
with the idea that there is no more practi
cable means of reaching those whose op
portunities are limited. Mrs. L. C. Bon
nestell has long been enthusiastic in re
gard to the elevating influence of music.
These ladies are the prime movers in the
enterprise, and are hopeful that it will be
the beginning of a widespread movement
of the kind in the City.
Invitations have been sent to as many
of the former students of the school as
could be found. The mothers of the
children who attend the school have also
received invitations. Some ladies who
are devoted students of music have signi
fied their intention of joining the class in
its rehearsals. The class will be composed
of members of the gentler sex. Sunday
afternoon will be the titae of the weekly
meetings. By-laws will be adopted and
the formal organization completed to
morrow.
At a preliminary meeting held recently
Miss Jean Parker was elected president,
Mrs. L. C. Bonnestell musical director
and Miss Sophie Galloway secretary.
Union Lengue Ladles' Night.
The annual ladies' reception given by mem
bers of the Union League Club will take place
on Wednesday eveniie, February 12. It will
be for the wives and lady friends" of members
only, and invitations are to be sent. A dinner
will be given at 7 o'clock in the maple room of
the Palace Hotel, after whicn an adjournment
will be taken to the clubrooms, where there
will be music and dancing.

THE BIG PROTEST
AGAINST FUNDING
California's Memorial to the
Congress of the United
States.
FORECLOSURE DEMANDED.
Full Text of the Committee's
Petition on the Pacific Rail
roads Question.
A PLAIN, STRONG DOCUMENT.
Unanimously Indorsed and Signed by
Every Member of the Orig
inal Committee.
Following is the full text of California's
memorial to Congress protesting against
the passage of any act to re-fund the debt
of the Pacific railroads and demanding
the foreclosure of the mortgages by the
National Government.
â¢ It is a powerful document, clearly- and
tersely worded, yet covering the ground
thoroughly and setting forth in unmis
takable language the feelings of the people
of the entire Pacific Coast on the refund
ing measure, and at the same time giving
the main facts upon which the people base
their demand for simple justice as be
tween themselves and the robber railroad
kings of the Pacific system.
The memorial is the joint production of
M. M. Estee, Henry E. Highton and John
P. Doyle, who were chosen as a sub-com
mittee of the main committee selected by
the State Anti-Funding Convention held
in mis City two weeks ago to-day.
' -Yesterday morning at a final meeting of
the memorial committee proper, held at
the Mayor's office in this City, the follow
ing document was unanimously adopted.
Afterward it was signed by every member
of the committee. .
Memorial annexed to preamble and resolutions
. adopted by the State Ami-Funding Convention,
Saturday, January 18, 1896, held at Metropoli
tan Temple. Nan Francisco, Cnl., prepared by
committee appointed for that purpose by the
convention, with full Dower to act.
The unaersuneil, a committee appointed for that
purjHJse, with full power to act, by the Anti-Fund
ing Convention, held at Metropolitan Temple, San
Francisco, January IS, 1890, respectfully memor
ialize the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States, against each and every measure
for re-f undine the secured indebtedness of the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad Company, and in favor of
foreclosure of the mortgages given to secure that
indebtedness.
Expressed in a sentence the people of this state
consider the welfare of the State itself to be in- i
volved in the new schemes of Mr. llumington and j
his associates, and, with '.lie earnestness and deter- '
mination of men defending their property and
their lives, denounce any conceivable plin of re
funding and any failure or delay in foreclosure, as I
destructive to them and to their descendants, as i
purely fraudulent, and as designed to place them i
completely and indefinitely at the mercy of those
who are and have been their greatest enemies.
ISSUES TO BK CONSIDERED.
The Issues to be considered in this memorial,
while of the greatest pecuniary importance, and to
Mr. Huntingdon and his associates of no conse
quence in any other aspect, nevertheless trans
cend all merely monetary considerations, for the
reason that they touch the sacredr.ess and the
supremacy of the law, and in that way the honor
of the Government itself.
With the greatest respect, but positively, we ob
ject to any action whatever by Congress, or Its
committees, in the matter of the debt of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company as an un
warrantable interference, opposed to the spirit of
our institutlous, with the due and orderly adminis
tration of the law. The entire question is now !
rip- for judicial action, through the executive, and,
becoming to all precedent and in harmony with,
the distribution of po.vers In the constitution,
should be treated exclusively through those
branches of the Government. - As the chairman of
the present Committee on Pacific Railroads of the
House of Representatives has already in effect,
announced, if Congress takes any action in this
matter, it must act through the exercise of judicial
powers, and this is opposed equally to the theory
of our Governmental system and to all just practice
in the history of the United States.
THE TASK OF CON OK ESS.
To arrive at a rinding of fact and conclusions
upon which any enactment could be intelligently
based. congress would be compelled to investigate
enormous records and intricate facts which have
accumulated within thirty years, and which, in a '
proper sense, are even now s,ub judice. arKi if this |
work be not done under the rules and principles ;
â which govern courts, and with judicial thorough
ness and completeness, the basis for any possible
legislation that would even wear the garb of jus
tice would bo wanting. And this essential process
of investigation would necessitate the decision of
numerous and complicated legal issues, for the de
termination of which the judicial department baa
been established.
The contracts between the Government and the
Central Pacific Kailroad Company are matters for
judicial ana not for Congressional interpretation.
The facts which have transpired under and in rela
tion to these contracts are obviously within the
range of judicial inquiry and decision.
We submit, therefore, that this preliminary ob
jection to any proposed legislation ought to be con
trolling. After foreclosure and 'such other action
M the courts may take, but not before then, it may
be proper or even necessary for Congress to inter
fere.
But. if you do not agree to this preliminary ob
jection, the merits of the controversy are now to be
considered.
FACTS OF TJIK CASH.
It is not that the Central Pacific Railroad
Company is an honest debtor, or that It is entitled
to favorable treatment at the bands of Congress. â¢
The facts are that in 1861 the Central Pacific
Hail road Company was Incorporated under the
laws of California. The constitution of California
proscribed then as now that "Each stockholder of
a corporation or joint stock association shall be in
dividually and personally liable for his proportion
of Its debt* and liabilities." (section 36, Article
IV, Constitution of 1849.)
The Supreme Court of the State of California in
terpreted this . section of the constitution in the
age of French vs. Tescbamacker, 21 Cat., 618, as
follows: J
"It is unconstitutional for the Legislature to - re
lieve a stockholder of a corporation of his individ
ual liability."
And as each stockholder of the Central Pacific
Railroad Company, under the constitution of the
State of California, is bound for his proportionate
share of all the debts and liabilities of corpora
tion, no act of Congress can now be passed which
will legally relieve him from such responsibility.
THE IUKKCTORS LIABLE.
The directors of this corporation are also person
ally liable for much of its indebtedness. Directors
oÂ» a corporation ! are trustees of. an express trust.
; They are held to a strict accountability for all they
do as such trustees. Their position is one of con
fidence, and when they violate their duty they are
amenable to the law, and neither the great politi
cal or financial power of the individual, nor of the
corporation of which he is a stockholder and direc
tor, cau be justly or legally invoked to relieve any
such director from the performance of these duties
or irom the . responsibility which a . noil-perform
ance of them imposes upon him.
says Morawetz on corporations (section 248),
- "The directors of a corporation occupy a position
of the highest trust and confidence, and the utmost
good faith is required in the exercise of the powers
conferred upon them." -
â¢ - y ' 11.
The admitted facts show that, practically, four
men living in Sacramento, In the State of Califor
nia, namely, C. P. Huntlmjton, Mark Hopkins,
Charles Crocker and Lelar.d Stanford, incorpor
ated the Central Pact He Railroad Company and es
sayed to build Its road. None of these men were
capitalists. The assessed valuation of .-til their prop
erty did not reach $260,000. They were unable to
build the road from their own resources. The Civil
War was then going on. The Eastern and West
rrn Stalest of. the Union demanded a closer and ;
more intimate connection with each other. The
lime for the building of a National highway across
the continent was propitious, and so Congress was
. spurred loan unusual liberality.
The people of California, although few in nnm
her, were generous to a fault. And the most ran
niticei.t grants and donations ever maae by a Gov
ernment or by b people to a private citizen or a
corporation were at that time made to the Central
Pacific -'Kailroad- Company. The following is a
statement of some of the principal grants and do
nations of land and money made: â¢' s
A NATION 1 AL tiKA NT. .
Congress granted to this corporation eve-y other
section of land for twenty milÂ«s on each side of its
contemplated road for the ; whole length thereof,
and â  also on the Oregon brunch 'of that system,
amounting In tins aKÂ£ref*&t<Â» to 10,000.000 acres, of
the value of fully $12,500,000. j It is reported that
they have ready obtained about that amount in
na'es of those lands. The Government fixed the
value of its own adjoining; laud al $2 60 an acre. . :
A i Dm same time the National 'Government
Issued to that company its mortgage bonds in the
mm of $27,000,000 (in round numbers), which
now amount, principal and Interest, to $58,000,000.
In addition thereto, the .State of California iruar
anteed the interest on ti1, 500 .000 of the bonds of
the company, and also granted to it thirty acres of
land in the City of Francisco, of great value.
which is now mortgaged by the same company for
*r2.285,000.
The several counties of the State contributed to
the company in money and property $l,fÂ»00,030 : the
city of Sacramento deeded to It its rrver water front
Of the estimated value of $1,000,000. and the same
corporation acquired or held without consideration
and contrary to the plain principles of law more
than ten miles of t lie water front of the bay of !*an
Francisco, forming the entire harbor of Oakland
and puns of the harbors of Alameda, Berkeley and
San Francisco, which is of the estimated value of
not less than $10,000,000.
It also obtuinoil from Wells. Fargo & Co. $1,500,
--000 of its stock in consideration of favorable trans
portation facilities accorded to said company.
TAIUE OF THE GRANTS.
The foregoing grants reached the enormous
! amount in value of $57,000.01)0. which is much
j more than the entire cost of the road.
| Add to tne foregoing the interest which Mr
Huntinsuon nnd bis associates obtained In every
town thiougli which the ruilroad passed, and also
the acquisition of health resorts, donations of land
for townsites, depot purposes, and, in fact, every
known kind of property, and you cannot but appre
ciate the vast accessions of this corporation.
Those donatious of land and mony were not in
tended as a gift to Mr. Huntington and his associ
ates, but they were designed to secure the. early
construction of a continental line of railroad, to he
thereafter operated in the interests of the General
Government and of the people of the far West, and
always under proper surveillance and control.
The incorporators of the Central Pacific Kailroad
Company were, to all intents and purposes, the
agents of the Government and of the people. This
Nation confided to their keeping the largest
amount of property ever In modern times granted
by any Government to an individual or a corpora
tion.
THB KIR9T SUB-COMPANY.
111.
Soon af;er the organization of the Central Pa
cific Kail road Company, C. P. Huntington and his
three associates incorporated another company
nuder the name of the "Contract and Finance
Company," end the same men were the owners of
and represented both the Central Pacific Kailroaa
Company and the '-Contract and Finance Com
pany." The directors of the Central Pacific Hail
road Company contracted with themselves to com
plete the road of that company, under the name of
the -'Contract and finance * orupany." They
charged their own prices for the work, nnd when
linisned they hold moil of its assets and some o:ie
else owned most of its debts. Under these condi
tions it is apparent that the asserted cost of the
road was about three times' as much as its actual
cost.
Mr. Huntington has said he did not own 100
shares of stock. He did not rinre to own stock In
i the company he had wrecked, because under the
constitution ox California a stockholder Is liable for
a proportionate share of the indebtedness of a cor
poration, ana, as a director, he was then, and is
still, liable lor these palpable frauds.
These same individuals and their successors m
Interest are now asking the General Governmei t
to relieve tnem from the liability which arose t y
! reason of their illegal and fraudulent acts In i.i-
COnring this vast indebtedne s by providing a legal
; means for re-funding it, an.l to accomplish this
â  purpose they propose to make a new contract
j under the forms of law whereby they will avoid
their personal responsibility for the creation of the
enormous liabilities now hanging overthe corpora
tion.
In this connection it must be remembered that
the bonded indebtedness which the United states
assumed and agreed to pay is but a small par' of
the ac:ual nominal indebtedness of the corporation.
According to Poor's Manual for 1896, the total
liabilities of the Central Pacific Kailroad Company
reaches the vast sum of $202. 491,684, while under
the estimate! made by the United States Railroad
Commission in 1888 the total cost of building and
equipping the Central and Western Pacific railroads
did not exceed $40,000,000.
HUNTINUTON'S THREE CORPORATIONS.
111.
Mr. Hunting-ion ana his associates at different
times organized three corporations through which
to carry on their railroad, business in California.
1. "The Contract and Finance Company," which
we have referred to, and under which corporation
the Central Pacific Railroad was built, and whose
books have been destroyed.
2. "The Western Development Company." .Ex
actly what this corporation was intended to "de
velop" can only be a matter of conjecture, but it
continued in existence until its books became
laden with facts. These books we believe cannot
now be found or its history traced.
8. "The i'acilie Improvement Company." This
corporation still exists, but is now In the painful
process of liquidation. :
The whole scheme is a deception and a fraud.
The Pacific Improvement Company claims to own
the great ferry and all Its appendages on the line
of the Central Pacific Kailroad at Port Costa, and
also the steamer Solano, which is the only ferry
boat in California that can carry a train of cars
across the Straits of Carquinez at that point.
. p. i. COMPANY'S claims. -
The same company owns, or claims to own, the
railroad's interest in the bridge at Sacramento. It
owns the ferry-boat Piedmont, that plies between
Oakland and san Francisco, and which also forms
a part of the Central Pacific Railroad Company's
line. It owns the river steamers Modoc and
Apache, the railroad office building at the foot of
Fourth ana Townsend streets in the City of San
Frcnclsco, the Dei Monte Hotel at Monterey, the
principal part of the lands formerly belonging to
the old company In and around .North Berkeley
and the depots at Sacramento and Los Angeles.
i It claims to own the Santa Monica wharf prop
erty, and the hotel at Lathrop before It was de
stroyed belonged to this company. It also owned
the Central Pacific Railroad wharf at San Pedro.
i It formerly owned, or assumed to own, the Oak
; land water front and the Mission Bay property.
i but It is said that these properties have recently
been transferred. It owns the coal mines in the
, State of Washington and in Mexico, from whence
; the Central Pacific obtains us coal, ami it Is pub
! licly declared that the Pacific Improvement Com
-1 pany nets $2,000,000 a year from the coal it sup
; plies to the Southern and Central Pacific Railroad
. companies.
Every dollar's worth of all of the above property
forms a part of the Central Pacific Railroad sys
tem and was bought on Us credit. The Southern
Pacific was also largely built on the credit of the
central, and the latter has wantonly been made
bankrupt to build up and maintain the Southern. -
TO DEBTBOY GOVERNMENT SECCBITY.
From the foregoing it can readily be seen how
the Central Pacific Railroad people have used the
, money and the credit donated to it by the General
; Government and by the people of the State of Cali
fornia, for the purpose of destroying the security
given to the Government for the very money fur
bished to build the road.
The same men, viz.: Huntington and his associ
ates, under the name of the "Pacific Improvement
Company," hold control over much of the private
business and a large amount of the private prop
; erty interests of California. To illustrate: They
own all the street railroads in san Francisco ex
cept two. and most of the street railroads in Oak
land. They have gridironed the City of San Fran
i Cisco with lines actual and prospective. To do this
they commenced by issuing 81 / ,000,000 in bonds.
: They froze out all of th,e old street-railroad compa
i nies and now hold an exclusive monopoly of street
: railroading in this gri-a City, and they control not
i only the passenger traffic but the politics of the
City. â  â  â .-.â¢â  - - â â¢ . .
They also own vast grants of land in other parts
of California, to wit, in Amador, Yolo. Monterey
j and other counties. ; They own most of the steam
'â  ers in the Bay of Man Francisco and on the rivers
j of this great State. They control the only line of
steamers via Panama to New York, and- they also
1 own the steam - lines to China and Japan. They
thus combine with the shipping interests by sea
Â«nd land and fix the price of freight by both meth
ods of transportation. . .
I They even run our hotels and public resorts, be
cause they control the means of reaching them by
reason of their ownership of all the lines of trans
portation In the interior of the State of California

' SIDE CORPORATION HOLDINGS.
These side corporations referred to have always
held a large part of the valuable assets of Mr.
Huutinglon and his associate!. At one time the
"Contract and .Finance Company" held for thorn
$38,300,000 of their property, ("see Huntin?ton's
letter of January 10, 3887. and Mr. Miller's an-
I swer of January 27. 1887, found in a report made
j In 1888 to the President and the Congress of the
i United States by the Railroad Commission ap-
I pointed for that purpose.)
To make uncertainty more uncertain, Mr. Hunt
ington not only destroyed the books of the "Con
tract and Finance Company," but, according to the
i reports made by those who Investigated their
I affairs, it Is claimed they also destroyed a part of
I the so-called "Record-book of Corporation Debts"
I (which book they were required by law to keep) : .
I namely, that part from page 48 to page 111, In-
I elusive. What these pages so destroyed would
i have disclosed remains a matter of surmise. But,
from a birdseye view of the whole affairs of the
j Central Pacific Railroad Company and Its manipu
â¢ lators, do one can he surprised that in a few years
| their railroad holdings increased from . 1100 miles
j to 8035 miles, or that they wrecked many railroad
i corporations, large and small, during the same
i period, or that they ar,e now seeking to set at i de
| fiance state and National laws and boldly destroy
the security for National Indebtedness. , ' ,
WEALTH at THK k'xpen-sk ok SHIPPERS.
The shippers of freight and passengers over the
Central and Southern Pacific railroads must in the
end pay all: the indebtedness, principal and in
terest, of these. roads, unless it is collected from
the security. * "â - V * - ;
For this reason the people of l California are es
i pecially Interested in keeping the amount of such
indebtedness within its actual figures. In this
connection it must .be remembered that C. P.
Huntington and his associates have become Im
-1 mensely wealthy in handling a corporation which
! they now say is bankrupt. â â '
, It mast be borne in mind that one fraud is the
i parent of others. The very , destruction of these
I books referred to is, In law, prima facie evidence
1 of fraud, and in any court of justice would be
I taken strongly against the parties who destroyed
I them, and in any department of the Government,
â  if the amount Involved: was small, such, an act
; would result in the immediate prosecution of the
j parties committing it; but the taking of a hundred

It-further appears from the same report that the

The same committee â¢ (page 22 of their report)
stated that the Central Pacific Railroad Company
had paid $2,361,154 88 for services by lawyers to

afford an insight Into the methods adopted by Mr.
Huntingdon and his associates in handling the
property of the Central Pacific Railroad Company.
it is settled law that a mortgagor of property can
not by his own acts destroy the value of the prop
erty so mortgaged and thus endanger the security,
yet the Central Pacific Company has done this
notoriously for years.
THE KENTUCKY INCOBrOKATIOX.
VI.
In 1884 C. P. Huntington and his associates In
the Central Pacific Railroad Company incorporated
the Southern Pacific Company In the .State of
Kentucky under the especial provision prescribed
in an act of the Legislature of that State, and
which act prescribed that said company should
never do business In the State of Kemncky. This
provision has been eliminated by subsequent legis
lation. All in all this was the most extraordinary
proceeding ever devised.- From beginning to end
it was an open, bald, glaring fraud.
After the incorporation of the Southern Pacific
of Kentucky (not a dollar of whose property was
in that State"!, these same parties, viz.: Mr. Hunt
ingtou and his associates, leased from the Central
Pacific Railroad Company all of its roads ami
equipments lor a period of ninety-nine years. The
terms of this lease are so iniquitous that any fair
minded man must admit C. P. Huutington and his
associates of the Southern Pacific Company suc
ceeded in misleading C. P. Huntington and his
associates of the Central Pacific Company. ' . '
We will not dwell upon the terms of lease or its
effect upon governmental or other security fur
ther than to say it shows fraud on its face. It is
an undeniable fact that Mr. Huutington of the.
Southern Pacific Railroad Company is still run
ning a sharp bargain against Mr. Huntington of |
the Central Pacific Railroad Company, because
most of the freight which was formerly trans
ported east and west over the Central Pacific is
now diverted from its natural channel, and Is
transported over the Southern Pacific road, the
evident object being to bankrupt the Central Pa
cific, and this object has been well nigh attained.
A shipper who does not demand that his freight
shall go by the Central, al. hough destined to Chi
cago or New York, will find it sent by the Souther
Pacific via New Orleans. In v word, the Central
Pacific Company, though a citizen of California
and existing under its laws, is used as a most po
tential means of destroying the industries of the
State. â¢ - â 'â¢...â¢
INDEBTED KOR TAXKS.
The people of California have other serious ob
jections to the manner in which Mr. HnntimUon
and hlÂ» associates control the railroad property on
the Pacific Coast.
For fifteen years last past the Central Pacific
Railroad Company and the southern I'aoific Com
pany have owed taxes to the state of California
always amounting to from $500, OIK) to If 1.500,000,
and for four years of that time they owed $400,000
to the school fund of thin State.
Immediately after the incorporation of the
Southern Pacific in 1884 it leased the Central
Pacific and became the arbiter and controller of all
Of its business affairs, and by reason of the fact
that the Southern Pacific is a foreign corporation
it has the option in all litigation to either bring
suit or transfer suits already brought in the State
courts to the courts of the United States; for in
stance, at this term of the Supreme Court of the
United states there is on the cnlendar for argu
ment v cose Involving $535,(100, taxes due from
the Southern Pacific and Central Pacific Railroad
companies to the state of California und for taxes
levied and assessed for the year 1887, yet the liti
gation involving these taxes has but, just reached
the calendar of the supreme Court of our country.
The position thus assumed by the Southern Pacific
C.imj any of Kentxicy is In mott instances a denial
of justice. No man who commences a suit against
that company or the Central Pacific lailioa.l Com
pauy. however just hisclaim.iscertainwt.cn the
action Is brought lÂ«at it will not be transferred to
the United Mates courts. California being a vast
state tern t or (ally the citizen in such a case who as ks
the courts of justice for vindication is often de
prived of any right in the premises.
PRODUCERS' WELFARK IN THE BALANCE.
VIII.
The people of California are further interested In
opposing the re-funding of I he indebtedness of the
Centra! Pacific Knilroad Company, because the
welfare of the producers of California depends
upon cheap transportation.
The courts have held that a corporation is en
titled to a fair rate of interest on its actual invest
ment. The question thus presented is what are
the actual investments of the Central Pacific Com
pany?
If its liabilities are what It claims, viz.: $202,
--491.581, then the shippers of California, if they
undertake to pay the principal and Interest on this
vast sum. are helplessly and forever bankrupt,
though the interest be but 'Â£ or 3 per cent per
annum.
And again, no competing railroad company
maintained by private parties can ever construct
or maintain a continental line to the Pacific slope
if the Central Pacific Railroad Company is allowed
to re-fund its present indebtedness at 2
or 3 per cent per annum, because private capital
will not invest and compete with capital obtained
at that rate. There can be no remedy for the
present situation, which leaves the Central Pacific
Hailroad Company in its present management and
In full control of this railroad property.
It has been epigramrnatically said that California
is the last of the slave States. ' In relation to Its
railroad transportation and to the influence of rail
road corporations this is substantially true.
PKMAXDS OP THE STATE.
It is insisted by the people of this State:
1. That there should be no re-funding act passed
by Congress, and
2. Thiit such steps should be immediately taken
by the Government as will get Dark the money a:id
property which have been fraudulently appro
priated by certain parties, connected with the
management of the Central Pacific Railroad Com
patiy, and to that end ever. <' partment of tho
National Government should be called into im
mediate action. The honor of the American
people is involved in this question. The stock Â»nd
bonds of the Central Pacific Kailroad are scattered
broadcast throughout the financial world. The
American Government has heretofore given this
company character and credit at home and abroad,
and to-day it stands as sponsor for what this com
pany does. And yet, by an act of Congress passed
in 18S7, a commission was formed for the pur
poses in part of examining into the affairs of this
company and reporting the result to the President
and Congress. That report whs made to and now
forms a part of the record of the executive and
legislative departments of the Government.
THK GOVERNMENT BOBBED.
It shows a mass of uncontradicted facts,
judicially and dispassionately arranged and con
sidered, which prove that the Government and
the other creditors of this company have been
nibbed of from $75,000,000 to $100,000,000, and
these facts have never been successfully ques
tioned.
And yet some of these same men, as the repre
sentative of the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany, now come before this Congress and demand
a certificate of character.
This demand has no parallel. IThe American
people are .honest, the American Nation is honest,
and we therefore ask: that neither time nor dis
tance shall ehau.-o or modify the relations of the
Government to this company or afford an excuse
for the condonation of a frand.
If the General Government should now stand be
hind C. P. Huntington and his associates in their
efforts to re-fund the indebtedness of the Central
Pacific Railroad Company it would create a mon
opoly which would soon be more powerful than
the Government it s-e'.f.
It should not be forgotten in this connection that
the very money which the Government of the
United states and the people of California have
contributed to this late railroad enterprise has
been and is being used to corrupt and misdirect the
legislation of the country, and thereby imperils
the safety of the State. The men who represent
these corporations now appear alike before the
National and state Legislatures, and even stand
unabashed at the door of the temple of just cc.
They have no political principles. They belong to
no party, are faithful to no trust and just to no
man.
TIME FOB A DECLARATION.
The time has come when the people must make
a declaration of independence against this corpora
tion, or they will become bankrupt In fortune and
in character.
If this is not done private property interests in
California will be destroyed, forlnnes will be dis
sipated, industries will be Imperiled and the whole
people will be politically and financially crushed
by a corporation more powerful than the State.
ARGUMENT ON THE EXISTING I,AW.
Representing the people of California, who will
have to pay the debts wherewith these roads are
left burdened, we confidently Invoke the personal
attention to tho case of every public man to whom
this memorial is sent. For several Important con
siderations affecting it we refer to a memorial ad
dressed to Congress Dy tire Committee of fifty ap
pointed by tho monster meei ing held at Metropoli
tan Temple, San trancisco, on December 7, 1895,
of which a cony Is herewith presented. Additional
considerations now urged *efer mainly to the Cen
tral Pacific road, with which we are more familiar,
but we believe that most of ihcm will be found
applicable to the case of th>- Union Pacific, al
though upon facts differing more or less in detail.
The act of Congress of March S, 1887 (Statutes at
Large, vol. 24, page 48H), provides that whenever,
in the opinion of the President, it shall be deemed
â¢â necessary for the protection of the interests and
the preservation of the secu-ity of the United
S; sites in respect to its lien on tbe Pacific roads
tbe Secretary pf the Treasury and the Attorney-
General, under direction of the President, shall
take the steps prescribed in the fourth section of
said act, and among Others 'steps to foreclose any
mortgages or liens of the United States on any
railroad uroperty.' "
As the Attorney-General would have authority
under the general powers of his olHce to take pro
ceedings for the collection of m-vieys due the
United States, this enactment must be understood
as a special direction to the President to determine
personally the time to act in the case of ihese rail
road debts as well as an expression of the judg
ment of Congress that foreclosure of the liens Is
the proper course, whenever the executive shall
decide that the time for action has come. As that
Congress gave much attention ;o this whole sub
ject of the Pacific roads its judgment expressed in
legislation should command corresponding respect.
THK TIM B FOR ACTION COltK.
No public interests demaud any further legisla
tion now, nor has any been urged by the execu
tive, except a law to simplify and expedite the
necessary legal proceedings by conferring com
plete jurisdiction over the whole case on the
united suites courts of the District of Columbia.
The time for action has evidently come, for the
debt is part due and the security is Inadequate;
and it does not admit of doubt that foreclosure Is
the only proper and business-like course to pursue,
for, independently of all moral and political ob
jections to condoning such gross offenses as those
here involved, there is another mortgage on the
road, the holders of which claim priority over the
Governmant lien. This priority lias been hitherto
generally assumed without inquiry, but in Igno
rance of muterial facts recently brought to light.
1 hese facts are of record and >ncontestible; and
their importance cannot be denied.
Tne amount involved (about one-fourth of the
Central Paiiflc debt) Is too serious to be lightly
dealt with. This claim of priority must therefore
bo judicially determined: justice to the United
States, and especiitlly to the people of this coast,
demands it, and this can only be done in a fore
closure suit. Kuch a suit, too, is the only way of
securing the whole road, with its necessary ap
purtenances, toward satisfying the debt.
And all these appurtenances must be kept with
and belong to the road, or the latter itself be
comes useless. A railroad cxinnot be operated
without terminal grounds, ferry-boats where
needed, bridges, rolling stock and like instrumen
talities. -Many million dollars in value of such
property will therefore be lost to the public if Con
gress undertPkes to deal with this question
without previous judicial ascertainment of
the extent and particulars of It, belouging
to each of the companies and justly subject to the
Government lien.
MUST BE DEALT WITH COMPREHENSIVELY.
Here are some notable examples of what we
refer to:
The Union Pacific road possesses terminals in
Omaha, Kansas Cily, Ogdeu and other cities on its
route, of great value; those above named alone are
estimated in the report of the Pacific Kailway
Commission at $15,300,000. Iho company claims
that they are not subject, to the Government lien:
a contrary opinion is expressed by others. The
question iB a judicial o c and can only be deter
mined by a suit wherein the lien is asserted and
foreclosure sought.
Similarly, tUo state of California donated thirty
acres In the heart of San Francisco to the Western
(now Central) Pacific road, expressly for terminal
uses, and the area has since been enlarged more
than fifty per cent, by the closing of intersecting
streets. As the Central Pacih'c roau has no other
terminals in San Francisco, this property is indis
pensable to the future use and value of the road.
Claimed in foreclosure proceedings, it would doubt
less be held to be an appurtenance to the road, in
capable of severance from it. But if the case be
disposed of by an act of Congress the contrary will
almost as surely be the result; for the gentlemen
who control and munage the Central Pacific have
put a mortgage on these terminal grounds, under
which they hud Issued at their lasi annual report
(March 81, 1895) bonds to the amount of $12,283,
--300, and while it is quite safe to say that these
bonds have never got into Innocent hands and that
the transacuon cannot stand for a moment if prop
erly brought before a court, yet if Congress extends
the time for payment of the debt, it will go un
cnallengnd until "mere lapse of time will put it be- I
youd the reach of legal redress.
BONDHOLDERS LOSE NOTHING.
Meantime the bondholders, who are, of course,
one or other of the numerous companies these
people form, lose nothing: for they are getting
interest on their bonds. For this, fraud foreclosure I
is the on y remedy ; an act of Congress cannot
reach it, for no act of Congress can determine the
title of land in California or the rightful or fraudu- I
lent character of a conveyance. Here, then, in j
these terminal grounds of the two roads alone are
at least $27,000,000 worm o( property to be either
saved to the public by foreclosure or lost by refund
ing What conscientious man, charged with the
responsibilities of legislation, can feel warranted in |
voting tor a luw wutch waives, without inquiry, j
public rights of such magnitude?
There are, without doubt, many other cases of
accretions to the mortgaged premises which fore
closure would brine to Tight and secure which !
would be lost by refunding. We have, tor exam
ple, public record of a Central Pacific mortgage,
dated April 1, 1889, covering a number of station
grounds and the like, commonly supposed to be
appurtenant to the road, but which, this document
suggests, arp claimed by the managers to be dis
tinct properties, and the instrument Indicates that,
in preparation for the worst, they have seasonably
mortgaged them to themselves.
KERRY FACILITIES.
What further instances of this kind the Union
Pacific road may afford we are uninformed, but in
connection with the Central Pacific we again di
rect attention to such things as the ownership of
the ferry between San Francisco and Oukland and
that at Beniciu across the Straits of Carquinez.
We observe that the former of these is for certain
purposes accounted in the reports and public acts
of the company as a part of the rond, yet we do. not
Had in sucli reports any account of the large reve
nues of the ferry, and ft would be an amazing and
unprecedented thing if a property of such value <
were not found to stand in the names of the man- j
agent or one of their convenient corporations. We !
believe that the company's title 10 it and much j
other valuable property and the validity of the '
Government ilen would be established in fore
closure proceedings.
Then tnere are the engines and roiling-stock be
longing to the road to be considered, it should all
be identified, inventoried and earmarked in any
settlement. A little paint hns often heretofore I
changed the apparent ownership of i\n engine or
cur and may eusily do so aÂ»,iin. Nothing is more
frequent here than to s?e engines and cars marked
â¢â¢C. P. R. K." runniug over rouds other than the ;
Central Pacific. Has Congress or any of its com- '
nil: lees any inventory of this movable property or j
any statement of its \v!iere:it.ouis?
ONLY SAFE AND I'RfDgNI WAY.
In view of all the considerations affecting the
question, we respectfully submit i hat the only sari'
and prudent way to deal with this problem is that
which uny business man wouid adopt in a similar
ffn. viz- : first ascertuin nil the tacts of the case
authentically, learn distinctly what are your i
rights and what can be Â«-c: red by legal proceed- >
nus beiore entering into any treaty of comprom- I
lM ; make sure, too, that the facts of the case can- â 
not he changed while settlement is under discus
sion. If you are taking property, look to the title
and see that it Is properly described and coinrs to |
you unincuuibertd. All this is the more essential I
where the conclusion renched iÂ» to take the form j
oi legislation which will remain effective, even I
though the considerations- on which it is based j
prove false or fail. Here you are taking the facts i
on trust and assuming most unwarrantably that i
you know them all. Yon do not!
It is worthy of uute, too, timt none of these re
funding biiiH come before Congress with any official
sanction. They are not asked by the executive, to
whose hands Congress has committed the business,
nor are they even petitioned for by the companies '
concerned; they are all promo. cd by private sug
gestions or by the solicitation of persons whose pri
vate interests arc affected. These are controllers
of rival railroad lines, and persons who, having I
wrongfully misappropriated tiie assets and means
Of liie subsidized roads, are Interested in the con
donation of their lrauds, which all extensions and
refunding schemes necessarily Involve.
Mr. Uuntingtou, the most conspicuous promoter
of refunding, has publicly stated that he does not
own more than 101) shares of Central Pacific stock;
his interest in the question is, notoriously, as one
of the original directors who divided between
themselves the assets of the company, and as the
heud of the southern Pacific, which afterward
took away its trade and reduced it to ita present
fallen and bankrupt condition.
SLIPI'EJIY METHODS OF TIIE ROAD.
Xor do these people even approach Congress
with any formal statement of what they propose
to do, or pretend they are able to do, in the way of
discharging their obligations. They commit theiu
.â¢eives to nothing whatever, they write nothing, ;
sign nothing; t::elr communications are made 1
orally to committees, or individual members in !
private conversations: bo that when they shall I
have secured the desired legislative condonation !
ior the past they may violate every promise to the !
public made or intimated, and members whose
votes they have won by such means will have 'â 
nothing to show on which to justify their action. !
Legislation so promoted is always dangerous and
objectionable, and generally vicious. To such we
are indebted lor all the mistakes and errors hither
to committed in railroad legislation, whether by
Congress or by our State Legislatures. It is the
constant resort of those who prppose to profit by I
the imprudence, credulity or good nature of mem
bers of the legislative bodies, whose confidence
they abuse.
It is time that such methods of dealing with '
great public Interests and taking the words of in
terested railroad managers as a basis for legisla
tion should cease. And as the means at command
of Congress foi ascertaining facts are quite imper
fect, and, what is equally important in cases like {
the present, as it is powerless to prevent a change
of conditions pending investigation, judicial ascer
tainment of facts ana custody of the property in
volved are essential prerequisites to Intelligent or
safe legislation. This can only be done by fore
closure.
FOB CONGRESSIONAL SETTLEMENT.
This proceeding is objected to by some persons
because it is associated in their minds with govern
ment ownership and operation of the roads. But
there is no necessary connection between the two
ideas. On the contrary, Congressional settlement
of the case Is the most likely course to lead right
up to State ownership. For it is morally certain
that the Central Pacific road can never earn ths
amount proposed to be charged upon it, and the re
sult must be thnt when the condonation of past
offenses has been secured, the managers will aban
don It to the Government.
The great ooject of foreclosure fs to ascertain
with judicial certainty and accuracy the details
necessary ttf be known before Congress can act In
telligently to rescue what can be. rescued from
fraudulent alienation, and to secure the property
against further inenmbrance or change while that
body iB deliberating. The order and the priority of
the liens, what specific property each of them
covers, and what means of collection the law af
fords, outside of the mortgageâ i. 0.. who Is liable
f in tlie deficiencyâ must all be ascertained by au
thority before anything else. This done, the terms '
of sale will be in order, and Congress may then
wisely interpose and define them. Its action will
naturally be affected by the order of priority of the
Ileus, nndthe ascertained earning capacity of the
road, when operated by an impartial receiver.
Kidding at the sale should be open to all the
worldâ not as contemplated by these refunding
schemes confined to its present managers. There
need be no fear of want of bidders if people know
what is included in the sale.
FIRST HOBTRASK BONDS HOLDERS.
If the holders of the so-called "first mortgage
bonds" are drclured entitled to preference over
the lien of the Dnlted States, the Government will
pay them off under the actof 1887 and be subro
ga'ed to their rights. But if their lien proves
subordinate to ihat of the Government, they will
have to combine and buy the mad for their own
protection or lose their money; and there will De
other competitors.
Kach of these results is widely different from and
vastly preferable to any refunding of the debt,
which, if effective. (Middles it on the people of this
state and perpetuates the control of the property
in the bands of the same people who have had it
from the beginning und who are responsible for all
the disgraceful past. They first impoverished the
company by the use of its'credit, bnllt a rival road
to be Its most formMable competitor in business
and finally rented It to themselves under a flimsy
corporate disguise for ninety years ahead on terms
which render it the mere satellite and hand
maiden of that competitor. Such a history ought
to disqualify them from bidding on the property
instead of entitling them to an exclusive right to
purchase, it. B
THE C. P. DEAD.
It is probable that most members of Congress
who are considering this question are unaware of
Important facts which should be known, and
which there are easy means of verifying. Is it, for
example, known to them that the great Central
Pacific Railroad Company is no longer a living
organization? that it has abdicated and aban
doned its functions as a carrier and never turns a
wheel or carries a passenger or a pound of freight?
and that the (treat bulk of its stock is held by peo
ple who fear to avow their ownership lest they be
held responsible for its debts? Baeb, however, is
the fact. The original owners have, with one ex
ception, sold out their holdings to persons residing
abroad, who withho'd their shares from transfer
and decline to register tneir ownership lest they bo
made responsible for the debts. The managers
keep control of the organization by the use of
proxies taken years ago from those in whOÃe
names the shares then stood.
The road is leased to the Southern Pacific for
three cr four generations and that concprn pays
$10,000 a year rent expressly to enable the great
Central Pacific Company to keep up its coipornte
organization, I. c.. pay salaries, keep an office and
maintain a semblance of animation sufficient to
avoid a forfeiture of its charter for non-user.
In the present hands it is not only a bankrupt,
but a fraudulent bankrupt, for it has alienated all
| its means to its own directors in fraud of its cred-
I Hors. This is the concern with which committees
| of Congress condescend to treat and whose assur
! ances they are expected to accept, through self
appointed aeents, as though It were a living or
ganization and i;s statements and promises of any
value. The leasv referred to went into effect Jan
uary 1, 1894, and is printed in the annual report
of the Southern Pacific Company for the year
1893, at pages 103 and 104.
THE CASE. SUMMARIZED.
The proposition to Congress of the Central Pa
â¢ clfic Kailroad Company, personified by Mr. Hunt
ington, may be condensed as follows:
"When this corporation was formed, the four
gentlemen, of whom I was one, who ultimately
I acquired substantially all its stock, were not worth
: more than half a million. It was a period of civil
war, and a transcontinental railroad was needed
for military and mail facilities. The patriotism of
; the people was intense. The four availed t-hem
: selves of the opportunity, and the railroad was
constructed to Promontory. They form d origin
' ally a partnership, and afterward a corporation.
I named the Contract and Finance Company, which

i crn Development Company and the Pacific Im
provement Company, and all these corporations,
I directed by the same men, dealt with each other.

HUNTINGTON'S MONSTROUB PROPOSAL.
"Now, through theye proceedinus, the chief as
sets of the Central Pacific have passed toother
| companies and to private ownership. That cor
; porntion in its oresenl condition is unable to pro
â  vide for or pay its debts. 1, C. P. Huntington, the
â urvivor of the four, and representing the Central
Pacific Kailroad Company, which will cease to ex
ist in 1911, ask you, the Congress of the United
States, to refund its indebtedness for 100 years, to
I establish 2 per cent per annum as the rate of inter
, est, to ratify and confirm ail the transfers and con-
I versions to which I have alluded, to forego every
legal remedy the Government now possesses, and
I to give, me th - power to collect so much of the re
| funded debt as I or my successors may choose to
pay, primarily from the producers of the Pacific
I Const, and secondarily, from the people of the
| United States."
This, in fairness and justice, is the substance of
the proposal Mr. Hum ing ton makes to Congress,
thus invoking the legislative arm of the Govern
ment to thwart and paralyze the executive and
judiciary, and, speaking of him in his representa
tive as well as his personal capacity, to intrench
him and his accumulations with fortifications that
would defy the constitution and the laws and every
principle of justice and of right.
Tlie mere fact that such a monstrous demand
can be boldly and even defiantly made is such a
commentary upon the times as no words could em-
I'has./.e. If the public response, though filtered
through conventions of solid and deliberative
character, is thick with indignation, and some
times couched in language unusually direct and
severe, it is no ground for surprise, and sc?.rcely
for criticism. If an average citizen perjures him
self or com n. its larceny or embezzlement he is
tried and punished, and there is no application to a
tejrtslatlve body to condone his crime or to ob
literate the facts he has created. Under a consti
tutional government, resting upon law and order,
depending upon equality of right among free slti
zens, and supposed to be quickly and effectively
moved by the enlightened opinions of an educated
constituency, it would be indeed surprising if the
people should tamely and frigidly accept such
false, boundless and oppressive assumptions and
pretenses as constitute this entire appeal of Mr.
Huntington and the Central Pacific Kailroad
Company.
THE LAW SUFFICIENT AS IT IS.
The whole issue about the railroad debts is now
Covered by the constitution, the Federal statutes
and well-established legal principles. The solution
of the question demands only the faithful applica
tion of the luw to indubitable fa'-ts. It is the duty
oi the Executive Department of the Government
to set the Judicial Department in motion. The
at.iiuile of our people is that the existing law
should and can determine the controversy and
preserve the rights and interests of the Govern
ment and its constituents. If the manipulators of
railroad?, In the act of managing the security, have
wasted, diverted and converted to their own use
the greater part of itÂ« value, then they and the
estates of those deceased are trustees. Let the
security be rehabilitated and the mortcace fore
closed within the broad und well-defined rules of
equity.
THE Hi iA I- AM ORDINARY DEBTOR.
The railroads should be treated like other
debtors. Probably your constituents, at. least thosÂ»
among them whose eovetousness transcends their
patriotism, would like to have their debts re
funded by a paternal* Congress at 2 per cent per
annum, while the Government borrows money to
keep up its reserve fund at double that rate of in
terest. Suppose that proposition was before you.
how promptly you would defeat it. Why should
Mr. Huntingtou and the special interests he repre
sents be favored beyond the mass of American
citizens? Why should you be asked to discrim
inate for the benefit of a corporation against the
entire country In general and the Pacific States in
particular? If to the Southern Pacific Kailroad
anl private fortunes the security pledged to the
Government and the other bondholders, or its pro
ceeds to the amount of $200,000,000 or more hare
been traced, lÂ»t the deficiency be reached there,
and not made up by enforced contributions from
our capital and our labor.
I But it is said that it is wrong to express or con
| vey suspicions of Congress and its committees. No
: one on this coast hac expressed or implied those
! suspicions. Like other attacks made upon mdi
I viduals, they ore a mere assumption of the rail
' road's and diversions intended to influence your
I action. We havp referred only to the past and in
| many places with Mr. Huntington himself as our
I authority. Is it not notorious that great reputa
tions were tarnished wiiu association with railroad
; frauds? And when Mr. Huntington wrote confi
dent ially to his friend and business associate,
! David D. Collon, d'd he not accuse the Congress-
I men of that day of corruption and express his
| opinion of them in lnnguuge that -vould redden the
I cueeks of any ordinary American? Why should
' he be permitted now to maintain a lobby and work
secretiy and selfishly at Washington to carry on
new schemes of plunder, in order to transfer his
burthens to the people and retain the money and
property to which tbo Government Is entitled and
which it can secure without an additional stroke of
legislation? â¢
PATTISON'S ABLE REPORT.
Let any member of either branch of Congress
read the report of Hon. Robert B. Puttison of Penn
sylvania as a memlter of the United States Pacih'c
Kailway Commission, in 18S8, from which we have
already extracted, and see how every phase of the
present situation is anticipated. '1 hat report is
crammed with facts and figures, arrayed without
heat or prejudice, and answering every possible
element of the. argument for refunding, and against
foreclosure. If, September 18, 1871/ihe president
of the Central Pacilic Kailroad swore in t.he De-
I partment of the Interior that the paid-up stock of
I that corporation was $54Â«,'263,190, when in truth it
was only $760,000, is that statement less false now
than it was then? If, December 31, 1886, the net
earnings of the Central Pacilic had been
?124,940,013 87, does that show any tendency
toward bankruptcy? If in pools, subsidies, re
bates, etc., the Central Pacific has paid out $9,882,
--i 799 61, is not the Government entitled to the
i benefit of that fact with all the additions since? If
', by fraudulent methods, by contracting with them
! selves, which is the worst fraud that trustees can
peroturate, the manipulators of the Central Pacific
; liad issued to themselves bonds and stock repre
senting $82,727,800, is this circumstance now to
j be ignored? If Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins
and Crocker, through the Contract and Finance
Company, the Western Development Company
and the Pacific Improvement Company, and 'ivi
cienda of the Centra? Pacific, received in cash and*
' securities more than $142,000,000, and also
rentals aggregating $29,912,373 49, is this to
be condoned because .Mr. Huntington now
says the Central Pacific is unable to pay
j its debts? If other frauds, including construction,
; the handling of land grants and numerous other
I items, had been exactly ascertained when Gov
| ernor Pat'ison wrote his report and have been
j fearfully augmented since, do these facts appeal
f to Congress on behalf of the railroads or on the
| side of the people.' If books and vouchers were
j destroyed, fal.su liabilities created, and five or six
j millions of.dollars disbursed for corrupt purposes,
does H not follow, as Governor Puttison said in
I relation to the Central Pacific, "that no part of its
j indebtedness can be recovered except through im
i mediate compulsory legal process," and that "ex
tension of the time for payment, therefore, means
I an increase of the amount of the debt and the
making of its recovery more hopeless?"
AX UNDESIRABLE CONTINGENCY.
Tf the debt be refunded and the time of payment
extended, moreover, what will be the condition
when the corporate existence of the Central Pacific
ceases at the end of flfty years of its organization?
, If tlie principal debtor expires wnat new compli
cations will surround the debt?
These are matters which cunnot he elaborated
in the midst of the present controversy, but whicti
are so well understood as to be part of the authen
tic history of the times, and they all point to tne
unavoidable conclusion that refunding and the
defeat of foreclosure are only designed to obiiteraie
legal responsibility, to condone such frauds as are
almost without precedent, to preser c enormous
I private fortuneb and the Southern Pacific t_om
j pauy frura all possible attacs, to shift the burthen
i of the indebtedness from those who contracted it,
| to force the people, who actually built the Central
Pac.fic, to pay for it two or three times over out of
their own resources and without diminishing the
fraudulent accumulations of those who aspire to be
their masters.
ALL PARTIES UNANIMOUS.
Republicans, Democrats. Populists, the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce, other organized
bodies, citizens of all shades of political opinion
who have made the Pacih'c States what they are,
and have stood by the Union and the Government,
are virtually unanimous against refunding and for
the foreclosure of the rehabilitated security. As
practical statesmen, what do you, gentlemen of
both houses of Congress, say to this demand? is
Mr. Huntington stronger than nine ov ten of the
sovereign States of this Union, stronger than the
Union itself, stronger than the law, than justice,
than common honesty? We do not believe that
he Is, and we confidently appeal to you for protec
tion. â â  - . : ' . . -
; To the argument that we ought to protect our
selves against those whom wo claim to have de
bauched our poll tics, and, to some extent, our law,
and to have interfered with and controlled our
business, - paralyzed . our enterprise and checked
progress, while they have absorbed' not only our
profits but large parts of oar capital, we answer
that in those phases of the controversy which are
purely local we are interposing and propose to in
terpose our strength us citizens and voters, but
that In that portion of the : tight which has been
transferred to Washington we are forced to rely
upon the most : powerful legislative body in the
world â the Congress of the United Stalesâ which
owe 3 its existence to the people, and which, in
theory at least, and as we hope, in practice also,
represents the people and their rights and their in
terests, and not railroad monopolists and corrupt
tionlsts. â  ,' â  â 
INEVITABLE CONCLUSIONS.
The conclusions we desire to formulate are:
Firstâ That, even "though me Central Pacific
Railroad Company be technically insolvent, still
re-funding is not, and foreclosure, is expedient.
Secondâ But that corporation is not insolvent If
its assets, as under the law they ought to exist, are
sufficient to pay Its Indebtedness.
Third â That Its assets have been transferred and
' converted to an amount more than adequate to the
complete rehabilitation of the security.
Fourthâ That, in a suit for . foreclosure, the with
drawn assets can be restored, wherever or in what
ever form they exist, the solvency of the corpora
tion established- and the whole indebtedness col
lected.
Fifthâ That, in order to consider all these ques
tions, Congress has in effect to exercise both ex
ecutive and judicial powers, and, by the investiga
tion of a committee, virtually to usurp the func
tions of two co-ordinate departments of the Cov
er^ment. . ;
Sixthâ That, without denying or even discussing
the abstract proposition, that Congress, by a mere
inquiry, may determine tor itself the status, in fact
and in law, of the relations between the Central
Pacific Railroad- Company and the Government,
nevertheless, it is obvious that, under existing con
ditions, such an Inquiry is not only Inexpedient, but
improper. .- â  â¢ : . . â â â '"
- Seventhâ That It is manifest, therefore, that the
present situation of the secured' indebtedness
should be left to the action and the determination
of the executive and judicial departments.
FORECLOSURE KIRST.
Eighthâ after foreclosure and the judicial
determination of the facts and the law, and of the
precise condition of the secured indebtedness of
the Central Pacific, in other words, when the pro
portion of the actual, not the nominal, security to
the debt has been ascertained, and the usual and
ordinary means of rehabilitation and collec
tion exhausted, then, and not before then, legisla
tion by Congress may become proper Â»nd ex
pedient. â¢ ; . .
Ninthâ But that, meanwhile the supremacy of
the law, the inviolability of contracts, and the
rights and interests of the Government should be
sacredly maintained, and there should be no con
donation through legislative action intercepting
judicial proceedings, of fraud and conversions, and
no sacrifice of the people at the mere behest of Mr.
Huntington and his associates, who are incom
petent to sit in judgment upon their own case.

DID NOT INDICT WILSON
Charge of Embezzlement Against
the Ex-Insurance Com
missioner.
The Grand Jury Ignored the Accusa
tion â Notaries Public
Heard.
The Grand Jury had some notable wit
nesses yesterday. Major W. W. Douglass,
chief deputy in the office of the State Con
troller, was there, J. E. Farnham, man
ager of the Pacific Bank, was on time.
His chief bookkeeper came along, and
with them were books of the bank, includ
ing the individual ledger, the signature
book, and the ledger from Qto Z. District
Attorney Barnes had a communication
frcm Attorney-General Fitzgerald to sub
mit to the Grand Jury.
Inquiry disclosed the fact that proceed
ings hau been instituted, presumably at
the instance of the Attorney-General, to
indict ex-Insurance Commissioner J. N. E.
Wilson for embezzlement.
When Mr. Wilson was in the heyday of
his political prosperity the Pacific Bank
was enjoying widespread confidence in
financial circles. When Commissioner Wil
son collected more money from the insur
ance companies than he thought it pru
dent to keep in his office safe over night he
deposited it in the Pacific Bank. Therein
he made a mistake, for the money should
have been sent to Sacramento. As it hap
pened, all of the money except $2000 got to
the proper depository at Sacramento. Wil
son put the $2000 in the bank and shared the
fate of other depositors when that institu
tion collapsed. His accounts as Insurance
Commissioner, therefore, do not balance.
The State sued him and got judgment for
$4000. This judgment is on appeal.
The first witness heard yesterday was
Chief Deputy Douglass and the next Mana
ger Farnham. The books were not in
spected. Even the ledger from Qto Z,
which embraces W, was not opened.
The jury after hearing all the testimony
in the case, and considering that the State
had obtained judgment against Wilson,
came to the conclusion that an indictment
for embezzlement should not be found.
Notaries Public George Knox, Daniel
Hanlon and H. Lask were witnesses con
cerning acknowledgments at the County
Clerk's office. The testimony of eachjwas
brief.
Expert Atkinson of the Grand Jury has
been investigating the records in the
offices of the County Clerk and Auditor
since last Monday. The secretary ol the
jury said that no report had yet been
made. The expert has been directed to
make a thorough examination.

SACRAMENTO VALLEY STJFFEKS.
A Portion of That Region Gets Too
Much Water and Some Crops
Are Destroyed.
Between 60.000.000,000 and 70,000,000,000
tons of water came pattering down on the
surface of this State during the recent
rainy season, which commenced January
12. The heat generated by the condensa
tion of vapor which produced this rain
was sufficient to raise the temperature of
the entire atmosphere which surrounds
the globe. So says Weather Seer Ham
mond, and he has a formidable array of
statistics and reports to prove his asser
tions.
"Up to the evening of the 12th," said
Mr. Hammond, "the rainfall throughout
the entire State had been very light. No
where, except in the Sacramento Valley,
had there been sufficient rain to allow the
ground to be properly plowed. In the San
Joaquin the ground had been summer
fallowed, and the loosened soil was noth
ing but dry dust. In the Sacramento Val
ley the crops were growing, but they were
much in need of rain.
"Up to this period the rainfall in the
lower San Joaquin Valley had been about
3 inches; in the central portion oi the val
ley there had been precipitated about L'}Â£
inches, and about 1 inch had fallen at the
lower end. This was about one-fourth of
the precipitation for the same period last
year. In the Sacramento Valley the rain
fall varied from 414 to 6 inches, as against
14 to 17 inches for the same period of the
year previous. In the southern part of
the State the rainfall along tne coast was
about 2 inches. Last year at that time it
was about 9 inches.
"At present the dryest portion of the
State which is devoted to agriculture is the
upper portion of the San Joaquin Valley,
in the vicinity of Bakersfield. Here they
have had from 3to 3% inches. At Fresno
they have had 4 inches, and Stockton has
had nearly 10.
"Sacramento has had about fourteen, and
Red Bluff, which usually exceeds Sacra
mento, is reported by our correspondent
as having had about the same, though the
Southern Pacific gauge snows 15.80 inches,
a difference probably due to different ex
posures. Six inches of rain iell at San
Luis Obispo during the late storm, and
Los Angeles got about four inches.
"The rain was sufficient in all parts ot
the State, with the exception, perhaps, of
the region near Lake Tulare. All other
sections could eet along all right without
another rain for a month o-cept from
Modesto south. Much of this region,
ever, is by reason of irrigation independent
of the rainfall.
"The Sacramento Valley was the only
place where the rain did any injury.
Considerable ground there was 'drowned
out' and large sections are under water.
The river reached a very critical stage, and
at present is up to 26 feet at Sacramento, a
fall of a little over half a foot irom its
highest mark during the storm. One or
two small islands are flooded, and the
crops on these are destroyed. Large por
tions of the tuie land along the shores,
which in dry years are capable of cultiva
tion, are under water and will remain so
until too late for planting this year. In
this way considerable harm was'done in
that region, but generally the ifcin was
very beneficial to tiie State."

After a Month's Search Detective
Chappelle Makes a Very
Clever Capture. *
A REWARD OF $1000 OFFERED.
The Prisoner, Clarence Murphy, Alias
A. M. Clark, Says It Is a Case of
Mistaken Identity.
United States Deputy Marshal P. S.
Chappelle made what will probably prove
an important capture yesterday in the per
son of C. M. Clark, who is supposed to be
Clarence Murphy, an absconding clerk of
the Salem Savings Bans.
Murphy is accused of making away with
$GO,OOO of the funds of the bank, and a re
ward of $1000 is offered for his capture.
Some three weeks ago Detective Chap
pelle received word from the town mar
shal of Salem to the effect that Murphy
was in San Francisco, and that he hail
altered his appearance by growing a set of
luxuriant side-whiskers. Yesterday shortly
after noon the officer saw Clark standing

[Sketched from life by a "Call' artist.]
in front of the Fireman's Fund building
talking to a gentleman. Confident that
he had spotted the right man, he waited
until Murphy had reached the corner of
California and Sansome streets, when he
\v;;s arrested.
Clarkâ for such is the name he now
claimsâ was too much surprised to make
any show of resistance, and before aston
i^.meat had given way to well-feigned in
dignation his wrists were encircled with a
pair of stepl bracelets. Calling a hack,
â¢ happelle hastened his prisoner to the City
Jl all, where he was temporarily placed in
the detectives' room. The ofheer stepped
into the front room for a moment, but his
back was scarcely turned when Clark
rushed for the window, raised it, and,
steadying himself fora moment, made a
Jeap for the conrt beiow, a distance of fif
teen feet.
Chappelle heard the raising of the win
dow, and reached it just as Clark's form
disappeared. He called to the latter to
halt, but tne fellow declined the mvita-

tion. Half staggering and running, he
made for the corner of the shed used by j
the patrol wagon, bnt before he reached it
<'iiappe!le tired a shot, hoping to scare him i
into submission.
Clark evidently did not care if he was i
"â¢iruck by a stray bulletâ he had made a I
desperate dash for liberty and didn't pro- j
pose to r-toj) until forced to. He rushed
across McAllister street to Larkin, fol
lowed by half a dozen officers and several j
Hundred excited citizens. Dashinp: pas', j
the Supreme Court building the fleeing !
man turned down Chestnut alley, but had
hardly gonp more tban ten "feet when
J'oliceman Brophv brought him to a sud
den halt.
He was carried back to the detectives'
room, and Jater locked up in the Central
station to await complete identification.
During the two hours he remained in
officers' quarters he assumed a somewhat
deliant attitude, refusing to say anything
further tuan it was a case of mistaken
identity. He declined to teil yrane he
was from or when he came to San Fran
cisco."
i "It is just a case of mistaken identity,"
;he said, "borne man, I suppose, has com
! muted a crime, and they arrested me for
; it. Why did I try to escape? Well, that
!13 easily answered. I objected to the in
; convenience of staying here pending a
long investigation, so I endeavored to get
i away. I decline to say more than this
until I have seen a lawyer."
j The crime for which Clark, alias Clarence
j Murphy, is wanted, was committed two
and a half years ago. He was at that time
a trusted clerk in the Salem Savings Bank.
P. S. Chappelle.
One day the directors thought it wise to
jro-over the books, not that he was under
the least suspicion, but simply because it
was a duty long; neglected.
The examination occurred in the second
story of the bank building and had pro
ceeded but a few moments when the
directors came across something that
aroused their suspicions. Murphy ex
cused himself by saying that he desired to
get some papers which would explain
matters. He never went to the bank
below, however, when he reached the hall
way; he made a dash for the nearest
window and without a moment's hesita
tion leaped to the ground, twenty-five feet
j below. Jumping into a buggy which hap-
I pened to be bitched near by, he drove
! leisurely away. That is the last the people
of Salem have seen of him.
C. M. Clark, who is thought to be the ab
sconding clerk, first came to San Fran
cisco about rive weeks &%o. He was ac
companied by his wife, and the two en
gaged rooms at 109 Powell street. Dunns
their three weeks' stay Mrs. Clark, accord
ing to the proprietor's story, appeared
very unhappy. She often complained of
the life she was forced to lead, saying if
the husband did not soon begin a new life
she would leave. She spoke of her hus
band as a gambler and an utterly profligate
fellow.
The couple left the Powell-street house
nearly three weeks ago, intending to make
their home in Alameda. On January 22
Clark again apphed at the Powell-street
lodging-house lor a room, though on this
occasion he was not accompanied by his
wife. He explained that she was in Ala
meda, but would probably join him in a
day or so. So far, however, 6he has not
put in an appearance, and it is thought
that she has finally determined to leave
him.

CAN GIVE AWAY LOTS.
How the Cemetery Associations Will
Avoid the Recently Enacted
Ordinance.
The cemetery associations are not en
tirely in despair over the action of Mayor
Sutro in signing the ordinance prohibiting
the sale of burial lots in the burial grounds
within the City limits, but think they
have found a way of avoiding the law.
One of the directors of the Odd Fellows'
Association said yesterday that he thought
the ordinance could be made entirely in
operative.
"Even if it is declared to be constitu
tional," he said, "we will keep on bury
ing as we can give our plats away, and we
will certainly do so rather than have them
on our hands. While we will not sell them,
there is nothing to prevent us raising the
price of grave-digging to any figure we see
tit. We are not at all alarmed over the
situation, as the ordinance, besides being
full of holes, is not broad enough to cover
the situation.
"There is only one way to stop the sale
or disposal of cemetery lots, and that is to
prohibit further burials in San Francisco.
If such a course is pursued of course it will
accomplish something, but so long as
burials are permitted the cemetery people
will find no difficulty at all in evading such
laws as that only lately passed."
.San Miguel Defense.
An enthusiastic meeting of the San Miguel
Defense Association was held at Twenty-fourth

B. Curtis succeeded in getting twenty-two
more names on the roll, maklng A 3ti4*alto

mination of the suit brought by the Noe heirs.
THE SAST FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
VICTORY MAY BE DEFEAT.
A Favorable Opinion Which May
Recoil on the Southern
Pacific.
FRANCHISE - HOLDERS' RIGHTS.
Grants of Privileges Are Not Grants of
Land, Says the Snpreme
Court
The Southern Pacific has won a victory
in the Supreme Court ; but the laurels of
victoiy may change to the cypress of de
feat on many a piece of disputed territory,
for the very points upon which the South
ern Pacific wins are the ones most strongly
in evidence against the railroad in cases
much nearer home than the one just de
cided.
The Southern Pacific wanted to run a
line through Redlands, in Los Angeles
County, but the prize franchise location â
Park avenue, in Lagonia Parkâ had already
been taken up by the Southern California
Railroad, an offshoot of the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe. The Southern Pacific
negotiated for possession of the avenue,
and to head off any such maneuvers the
Southern California Railroad built a spur
track along the greater part of the avenue
and erected a flag station along the coveted
line. The Southern Pacific sued and the
Superior Court gave it possession. The
defendant railroad appealed, and now the
Supreme Court has affirmed the decision
rendered below. In the decision there is
much for the Southern Pacific to congratu
late itself upon; there is also much food
fox reflection.
The original franchise of the Southern
California Railroad was secured by appli
cation of the property-owners whose prop
erty abutted upon the avenue. It had a
clear right of way down the highway, but
the right of way was not being used, and
the Southern Pacific, in running its line
south, applied for permission to run over
the unused franchise. Suit was brought
to compel the sale of the right of way, and
the Superior Court ordered it sold.
In affirming this decision the Supreme
Court announces some new points upon
the legal status of franchises, and some of
them stand out with particular force. A
franchise, it says, is not a grant of land ;
it is the grant of a privilege, and the privi
lege is granted for the benefit of the people,
not for the benefit of the grantee. It fol
lows, then, in tne opinion of the court,
that when a franchise is granted and the
land included in the right of way described
is not made use of, another person or cor
poration, having for an object the public
good, may step in and make use of the
unused franchise; for unless he use his
franchise for the public good, the court
says, the original grantee cannot prevent
the use of his unused rights of way by a
person orcorporation who will better serve
;hc people.
Commenting upon the fact that a track
had been laid down and a station built,
the Supreme Court again brings balm to
the victims of unused Southern Pacific
franchises, while at the same time it brings
victory to the corporation itself. The
spur track and the flag station, the court
says, were of no use to the defendant rail
road. They had not been thought of
until the unused franchise had been ap
plied for by another, and after being built,
the spur track was allowed to rust, and
the flag Btation was never bothered by
passengers or care of freight that did not
pass. The line in prospect by the Southern
Pacific was a through line, and its pres
ence on the avenue would bring much
more benefit to the people tnan the spur
track and the little flag station put there
to prevent its passage.
The Supreme Court says farther that one
line has the right to run over the fran
chise of another when the interests of the
people demand such a condition of affairs.
It is like two railroads crossing a moun
tain range through the same pass, says
the opinion of the court; the original roaa
must allow the secona road to pass overits
franchise, the intruding line paying only
so much damages to the first occupant as
its presence actually causes.
Some striking analogies to the position
of the beaten Southern California road are
found in some of the familiar franchises of
the Southern Pacific. Only a few days
ago, goaded to action by a franchise which
is still merely shadow, but which prevents
a better service furnished them, the resi
dents of Ashbury Heights and of the dis
trict south of the park brought suit to
have forfeited the rights of way with
which the Market-street Railway Company
or the Southern Pacific had gridironed the
streets surrounding their property.
There are some places mentioned in the
franchise where tracks are laid, and there
are many more blocks where the franchise
is entirely included in the mere privilege
to lay rails. Over the tracks already laid
the cars run at fitful periods, yet it had
been supposed that the original franchise
was paramount, and, until forfeited, pre
vented invasion of its streets by other
builders of roads. The decision just ren
dered would seem to go against this view.
The franchise granted and held is not one
of lands but of privileges, and privileges
which, to be held, must be used.
The phantom car which daily drags
itself up and down Bush street also in
trudes itself within the terms laid down
by the opinion. There was no grant of
land on Bush street.
There was a grant of the privilege of
running cars for the public good, and it
has sunk to the running of a single car,
not for the public eood, but to hold the
two lines of rusting iron so no one else
can take possession. Were there a Hag
station along about Van Ness avenue, on
Bush street, the phantom track ana red
wood depot of Park avenue, Redlands,
might be said to have been reproduced
here in San Francisco. The spur track
and the lonely car with the flag station
and the unused rails, the uncertain cars
and the unused franchises, would seem to
come equally under the terms of the last
opinion of the Supreme Court.
By the rulings of the court the spur
track on Park avenue is ordered torn up
and the flag station is ordered pulled
down and carried away.
GRAIN BAGS FOR FARMERS
Prison Directors Meet and Fix
the Price at Four and a
Fifth Cents.
Large Quantity on Handâ Speculation
as to the Successor of Director
Devlin.
Farmers of the State will be interested
to learn that there is a supply of what are
considered excellent grain bags now avail
able.
Yesterday the State Board of Prison Di
rectors held a special meeting at Director
DePue'a office in this City. There were
present Directors Neff, Fitzgerald and De
Pue. Director Hayes is in the south and
.Director Devlin, whose term has expired
but whose tenure continues until a suc
cessor is appointed, was in Sacramento.
The chief business done was fixing the
price of bags at 4.20 cents a bag. This is
the same price at which Calcutta bags are
at present quoted, but it is claimed that
the prison bag 3 are recognized by the
farmers as a superior article. The demand
for the Sf.n Quentin bags has been brisk,
but the warden has been obliged to put off
replying until the price was officially fixed.
There are now on hand at the prison
4,250,000 bags, and this number will be
daily increased. The mill will start on
Tuesday next and will turn out 1800 a day
thereafter, m iking anagcregate of 2.000,000
additional bags likely to be available by
July.
There is considerable speculation re
garding the man who will be appointed to
fill the vacancy on the Prison Board caused
by the expiration of Director Devlin's
term. The general consensus of opinion
at present seems to be in favor of James
H. Wilkins of San Rafael, a former direc
tor. Wilkins is a Democrat and is recog
nized by his friends as a competent man.
The board will meet on the Bth inst. at
San Quentin.
GOOD ROADS MOVEMENT.
Executive Committee of the South Side
Clubs Shows Interest.
The five improvement organizations of
the South Side are getting ready to go
into the good roads movement with pretty
much the same en thusiasm they showed
in the matter of having Folsom street
paved.
The executive committee of all five clubs
Held a meeting in the office of Dr. T. A.
Rottanzi, at Third and Folsom streets,
last night, and talked over the intentions
of the good roads committee of the League
of American Wheelmen. The South Side
organizations propose to co-operate with
the league and help to bring about the big
demonstration which it is intended to
have when the State Bureau of Highways
completes its present tour of the State.
Secretary Michener of the good roads
committee of the wheelmen is about to
issue circular invitations to all public
bodies in the City asking them to be rep
resented in a preliminary meeting to be
held at the rooms of the Bay City Wheel
men on the 13th inst.
Being already informed of the pro
gramme of the League of American Wheel
men, the South Side executive committee
last night chose as its representatives to
attend the preliminary meeting on Febru
ary 13 Presidents George A. Raabe of Fol
som-street Club No. 1, Joseph Kelly of
club No. 2, Leon Samuels of club No. 3
and John J. Rafferty of club No. 4, and
President T. A. Rottanzi and Secretary I.
Schwartz of the Central South Side Club
and A. B. Maguire, the father of the Fol
-Bora-street movement.
Most of the meeting was in the nature of
a jubilation over the action of the Super
visor? in concluding at last to do some
thing toward the paving of Folsom street.
Naturally the question of having proper
gas, water and sewer connections made
while the Etreet is in process of being
paved, instead of having them made after
the street is paved, was discussed, and a
committee, composed of A. B. Maguire,
George L. Center and F. W. McEwen, was
chosen to call upon the Spring Valley
Water Company and the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Light Company and to
ask those corporations toco-operate in the
matter of improvement by having timely
connections made.
The committee will send out circular
letters to the property-owners in a few
days, asking them to do their utmost to
ward putting in the connections in time.
The idea is to prevent the unnecessary
tearing up of the street again.
AND "CONFUSION" REIGNED
Lord Sholto and His Mummers
Abandoned by Their Ad
vance Agent.
He and Lady Douglas Still Hopeful
and They Stop at the
"Golden West."
"Lord and Lady Sholto Douglas" is the
highly aristocratic entry that tops the
page of the arrivals at the Golden West
Hotel on Ellis street for Wednesday. It
was not a forgery. The lord and his petite
lady are at this hotel, their northern tour
with a company producing "Confusion"
having been cut short by several unfore
seen accidents.
"The theatrical manager's life isn't a
very pleasant one sometimes," Lord Sholto
said last night, with a wan smile. "It's
all right when there is plenty of money in
the box-office. But then there are other
times."
A look full of sorrowful memories ac
companied this statement.
"Wasn't your trip financially a success?"
was asked.
"Oh, yes," he said, quickly; "that is,
taken as a whole. But we encountered
rains, and up in those northern towns
when it rains every one stays at home, 3*ou
know. It was bad enough before. Then
it became worse.
"It may seem a nice, easy thing t j be
managing a theatrical organization. But
when there isn't actually enough in the |
house to pay the rent and for the lights ;
one is likely to wish he were doing some- I
thing else.
"The rain upset a lot of our plans. But'
to make matters worse our advance agent, j
a fellow named Lotto, abandoned his job.
Yes, sir; he left us without a word of
warning.
"That stopped the tour, of course. We
had to cancel a whole lot of dates. You
see, we couldn't expect to go into a town
where we hadn't been advertised and get
an audience. So we decided to come back
home."
Lord Sholto said he was thoroughly
pleased with his theatrical experience and
intended to continue it. His company,
he explained, would require some change,
and he is now engaging a leading lady and
two or three other members, who will ma
terially add to its strength.
Their next trip will be on the southern
route. Dates are being booked now, and
as soon as definite arrangements are
effected, which will be in about a week,
they will start out again.
Lady Sholto is quite elated at the suc
cesses she has achieved in legitimate roles.
She occupied a box last night at the Alca
zar and was much interested in the lines
of "The Canting Scoundrel."
"Yes, indeed," she said, turning from
the stage, "I intend to follow the lines on
which I have begun. I have just begun to
realize how much I have to learn. But,
really, I'm sure I'll be a success.
"I know I was pretty bad in my spe
cialty," she said with an ingenuous smile,
"but" really, I'm good in the parts I have
been playing recently. And I know I'm
going to be better, sure. I wanted to do
emotional parts, but they said I wasn't
big enough. So I'm doing soubrette parts
now, but I think that before long 1 will be
able to undertaKe the ingenue."
Lady Sholto declared the tour had been
a remarkable success throughout. Every
where, she said, they had been enthusi
astically applauded.
"And, oh, I had a lovely reception at
Sacramento," she exclaimed. "That was
where we played last. The people were
awfully kind â kinder than they were here.
They recalled me seven times, and even
time I came out they seemed to applaud
louder."
Among some of the local theatrical peo
ple, comment is not so roseate. They say
the advance man quit because the show
was losing money. They say, too, that
good houses were rare, and that Charles
Aliskey, the owner of the show, lost con
siderable money. Of the future, they are
not prepared to talk.
Carpenters to Join.
Carpenters' Union No. 2 deoided last night
to assist in forming the Building Trades Union.
A committee consisting of Henry Meyer, J. D.
McViclter and Thomas Sanders was appointed
with power to assist in effecting its organiza
tion. The Carpenters' Union initiated seven
new members.
FILCHER IS WRATHFUL
The Manager of Our Exhibit at
Atlanta Criticizes His
Disparagers.
CALLS MRS. M'CANN A PEST.
A Letter Written by F. W. Crandali
Is Denounced as Being Utterly
Untruthful.
J. A. Filcher, the secretary of the State
Board of Trade, is wrathful. He returned
Wednesday from Atlanta, where He was
Commissioner-General of the California
exhibit, and yesterday learned for the first
time of extensive anonymous criticisms oi
the California exhibit, and saw some of
the unfavorable comments made in regard
to himself by persons concerning whom he
felt free to express his opinion.
The principal thing he objected to was a
letter from F. W. Crandali, printed in the
Examiner of January 23. In this let*ar
Filcher was accused of complicity in an at
tempt of two men to beat the railroad out
of its fare by riding in one of the cars car
rying the exhibit back to this State. Will
iam Harris "was allowed" to occupy the
office with impunity, to drink wine galore,
get drunk and lie behind the Ventura
bean exhibit for half a day at a time. In
the fu.ee of all this, he is sent to California
in company with his pal, Walton."
"The entire article is one batch of false
hoods," declared Mr. Filcher. "Why Cran
dali should write them I do not" know.
Why, at the time this letter was written
he was expressing great friendship for me,
and gratification at the results we had
achieved. Besides, I gave him work when
the State Development Committee, by
which he had been sent out, told him it
was unable to let him have more money.
"His lying insinuation that I loaned
myself to an attempt of two laborers to
beat their way to California does me a
double injury. Both myself and the State
are under heavy obligations to the rail
road oompanies for many favors,, and I
would not have been a party to a scheme
to rob them. Besides, my work was to
induce desirable immigration, and I
would not have assisted men who were
unable to pay their fares.
"The fact is that I exposed the hiding
place of the men. They had assisted in
packing the cars. One of my assistants, I
learned later, helped them to secure their
quarters. I heard some talk of this and
had the head freight clerk of the Atlanta
and West Point Railroad open the car.
"The men were discovered, of course,
and hauled out. I learned that they were
taken to jail. As I knew they were not
criminals I secured their speedy release.
Later they bought tickets and are now in
this City, I believe.
"Harris never hung about the exhibit.
The only wine he ever drank there was
when I opened a bottle to encourage tho
men who were doing extra work to hurry
the preparation of the exhibit. Once he
came to the exhibit intoxicated. lat once
put him out. Later 1 heard he had come
back while I was away and gone into a
back room and slept. I gave him a lecture
and never saw him intoxicated again."
Sume of the most severe criticisms of
Mr. Filcher came from a "Mr, Giick"
and Mrs. L. A. McCann. The latter was
appointed a commissioner with four others
by Governor Budd.
"I'd like to find this man Glick," said
Mr. Filcher warmly. Tneft he added:
"There are dozens of prominent gentle
men from all over the country who would
like to do the same thing. I did not know
him, although lie introduced a party of
influential business men to me, and on
the strength of his apparent connection
with the exhibit borrowed money from all
of them. They never got it back.
"As to Mrs. McCann, she was a pest and
tended to make the exhibition ridiculous.
Mrs. Alice May Porter, the other lady
commissioner, by her charming manner,
did much good for the State. Mrs. Mc-
Cann was really harmful. She wore an !
enormous badge on which was the label:
'The' Commissioner from California.
Once she took exception to some praise
that was being given to the management
of the exhibit, aud in the parlors of the ;
Kimball House said I was merely her >
janitor and box-opener; that she was the
commissioner, and if my face was biack I
would be known as her porter. This was
heard by a half dozen people, friends of
mine, who expostulated with her."
Mr. Filcher told of many instances in
which Mrs. McCann's actions were, to say
the least, of a character hardly to be ex
pected. He declared that her presence
was a constant source of annoyance, and
said he had been told by -a. Santa Cruz
editor at the time she was appointed that
such wouid bo the case.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What Sportsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The return of fine weather has eiven an
impetus to all kinds of outdoor sport. The
wheelmen are particularly anxious for a
run in the country, but as the roads are
yet too heavy cycling trips in the interior
will be postponed for some time. Golden
Gate ParK is in good condition and the run
to the Cliff is delightful.
The season for shooting small game is
rapMly drawing to a close, but it is certain
that numbers of quail will be bagged in
the next few weeks.
The swordsmen will give an exhibition
to-morrow at Central Park. A coursing
meeting will be held at Ocean View and a
Gaelic football match will be decided at
Golden Gate Park.
THE WHEELMEN.
Probability of Professional Racing:
at the Indoor Tournament,
The indoor racing tournament to be
held at the Mechanics' Pavilion March 5
to 11 has assumed such definite shape dur
ing the last week that it is now certain to
be held. The hall has been engaged, over
$1500 worth of prizes have been purchased
and placed in the hands of R. M. "Welch,
representative of the National racing
board, ana entry blanks are now in the
hands of club secretaries. The manage
ment has gone into the thing deeper than
was expected. It has made arrangements
to hold a cycle show in conjunction with
the racing programme, and stands will be
erected around the sides of the pavilion.
Several of the large branch houses here
have already taken space, the Columbia,
March and Monarch people being thus
far the largest exhibitors. An attempt
w ill be made to bring some of the crack
professional racers here for the tourna
ment.
The California Associated Cycling clubs
will bold an important meeting this even
ing at the rooms of the Imperial Cycling
Club, 614 Van Ness avenue. There is al
ways a great deal of business to transact
at the meetings held this time of the year,
with the annual twenty-five-mile road
race and the relay but a few weeks off. It
is expected that but few changes in the
racing rules can be adopted until the
League of American Wheelmen's meeting
bi Baltimore this month decides whether
class B men are amateurs and may com
pete on the road with the riders now de
signated by the term class A. There will
be some changes offered for the relay
course, it being desired to avoid the neces
sity of finishing the race on the streets of
Oakland. Several suggestions in this di
rection will be offered. A special twenty
mile race to decide who shall possess the
Baker & Hamilton trophy will also be ar
ranged.
The members of the Alpha (ladies') Cy
cling Club will appear in the park to-mor
row, if it is pleasant, in their new gray
uniforms. They are an improvement over
Iho former blue ones in pattern, style and
finish and, as the fir^t lieutenant explained
to me, "any girl will look well in this new
suit of ours." I was forced to admit that
it was very becoming, particularly to her.
The Alpha Club now numbers forty mem
bers, all expert riders, and, as they are en
thusiastic over the sport, they can always
be seen either in the park or on tne coun
try roads.
Any one desiring to join the League of
American Wheelmen can have mailed to
him an interesting little pamphlet enti
tled, "Objects and Methods of the League
of American Wheelmen," by addressing
the cycling editor of The Call. Applica
tion blanks can also be had for the asking.
The Call appreciates the work the L. A.
W. is doing in the interests of the wheel
men and t;ood roads and the organization
should receive the support of every bicycle I
rider in the State.
The date of the annual 100-mile relay
race around the bay this year will be Sun
day, April 5. Most of the relay riders
train about three months for the event, so
that they will really commence prepara
tory work now.
The San Jose Road Club will celebrate
its fourth anniversary Tuesday, April 7,
and a committpe has been appointed to ar
range an entertainment in "celebration of
the occasion.
The next meeting of L. A. W. officers
will be held Saturday evening. February 8,
at the rooms of the Bay City Wheelmen.
The club representatives for the year 1396
are: R. M. Welch, H. P. Howard, Bay
Ciry Wheelmen; F. L. Seyboldt, Garden
City Cjciers; W. O. Bigelow, Terminal
City Wheelmen; A. P. Swain, Acme Club
Wheelmen.
There will be an immense cycle show in
Denver February 4 to 8, which will be at
tended by a number of the prominent local
dealers.
The following is a list of the members of
the California Cycling Club who have re
cently joined the League of American
Wheelmen: A. C. Lassen, J. P. Broder,
W. R. Reid, F. S. Nason, F. N. Bent, H. P.
Egeberg, C. Curieux. J. W. Harvey, E. M.
Boyle, C. Mayer. W. Musser, J. D. Cardi
nell, D. D. Doud. U. F. Neunaber, G. F.
Burnett, L. M. Tnttle, H. L. Mayo, J. T.
Peck, C. U. Birdsall, M. A. Griffith. W. P.
Mibach, G. W. Thomas, C. E. Baker, J.
Sheridan, A. M. Cook, W. N. Brunt, R. A.
Coulter, Fred Struven, W. O. Johnson, H.
B. W 7 illiarns, L. T. Olson, Don SnedeKer,
R. S. Allen.
These names were secured upon the oc
casion of the visit of the league committee
to the club recently. A second list is being
circulated among those who were not pres
ent that evening, and is expected to be
quite as large.
Some eight or nine wheelmen were ar
rested in the park last Thursday evening
for violating the ordinance requiring them
to carry lanterns. Such of them as are
members of the League of American
Wheelmen are hr.vine their cases cared
for by F. H. Dunne, attorney for the L. A.
W., that being one' of the advantages of
membership in the organization.
The first run of the Camera Club Cyclists
for 1896 will take place to-morrow, "if the
weather is fair. The start will be made at
the panhandle entrance to the park at 10
a. m., throueh to the beach. As the ride
is a short one it is expected there will be
a number of ladies on the trip.
The Camera Club Cyclists will give an
informal entertainment Friday evening,
P>bruary 14 (St. Valentine's), which will
be in the form of a progressive euchre I
party. It is designed to restrict these I
gatherings to club members, but every I
member will be privileged to invite a lady. 1
There will be prizes for the successful con- |
testants and consolation prizes in the wav I
of souvenirs of some sort, which are liable I
to take some comic form. By having these
entertainments at intervals the cycling
annex hopes to keep up the interest of the
members during the winter months, when
riding is impracticable.
The visiting committee of the League of
American Wheelmen was accorded a most !
flattering reception at the meeting of the
Olympic Club Wheelmen last Tuesday |
â¢Veninc. There were folly seventy -five â 
members present and they listened with j
rapt attention to the league speakers, who â 
addressed them in the following order: I
H. W. Spalding, F. H. Kerrigan, R. M.
Welch, Charles Micbener, F. H. Dunne,
John P. Burke, S. G. Scovern and G. H. |
Stratton. Thomas R. Knox made a few
brijrht remarks upon the league in general. !
ri. F. Wynne was not present owintr to a j
slight illness, which his friends regretted, j
particularly as he is a most interesting
talker. That the visiting committee's
mission was successful was evidenced at
the close of the meeting, when S. G.
Scovern, G. K. Stratton and Captain W.
B. Fawcett, a committee appointed by
President Adams to canvass the room for
members to the league, secured thirty-six
enp'icanta. whose names are: Alphonse
Hirsch, W. T. Hobson, John F. Me
(Jlynn, Edwin Goeller, Paul M. NiDpert,
Walter L. H. Geldert, H. C. Hahn.

| Allan N. Jones, H. Cosgriff, Charles J.

and Walter B. Fawcett.
A large number of the members of the
Olympic Club W&eelmen are already mem
bers of the league, which explains why the
names of President Adams and Messrs.
Thornton, Haley, Fuller, Hunter, Stratton,
Scovern and a great many others are not
! signed to the above list.
After the business of the meeting was
finished those present were entertained by
a musicale, the talent being secured from
among the members. In this way the rest
of the evening was passed very enjoyably,
and it was a late hour when the meeting
adjourned.
Tne Imperial Cycling Club's party last
Thursday evening, at Union-square Hall,
was particularly enjoyable, and a large
crowd attended. Tne" club is becoming
famed among the cycling organizations
for the excellence of its dancing parties.

BOXING.
The National Club Will Give Its
First Exhibition on Friday.
An entertainment for the benefit of the
Children's Hospital will be held at the
Auditorium Theater on Eddy and Jones
streets on Friday evening next.
The National Alhletic Club, of which J.
Ross Jackson is president, has arranged a
very excellent programme of all kinds of
Danny Needham, Weight 145 Pounds.
indoor sports for the occasion. The main
feature of the evening will be an eight
round .contest betwee~n the clever and
hard-punching boxers, Danny Needham of
St. Paul and George Green of this City.
According to an agreement signed by the
boxers, a decision must be given by the
referee as to which of the contestants had
the best of the bout up to the time of its
conclusion.
Need ham is acknowledged by all good
judges of fisticuffs as bein;; one of t%e clev
erest boxers of the present day. He
proved in his fight with George Dawson
some years ago at the California Club that
as a ]abber he had no equal. Although
Dawson won the contest by playing a tat
too on Need ham's ribs which finally told
upon the receiver, the St. Paul champion
made a chopping-block of Dawson's face,
which resembled in color the betting sun
when the referee declared the match in
favor of Dawson.
George Green was a favorite of Cham-
George Green (Young Corbett), Weight
145 Pounds.
nion Corbett. who predicted for the young
Olympic boxer a bright future. When
Green went East he met several good men
and defeated five in all. among whom
were Â§I Shadow" Maber, Dick Moore and
Billy Vernon. He is a very shifty boxer,
and will nave an advantage over Need
bam, as he can use both right and left to
good advantage.
The contest should certainly prove very
interesting as it would be no easy matter
to find among the army of boxers such
clever exponents of the manly art as Need
ham and Green. The club will also give
one six-round contest and two four-round
bouts between heavy-weights. There will
also be wrestling and fencing. Taken as a
whole the entertainment should be well
worth seeing, as only the best talent ob
tainable will appear.

does not know who Turner's darling is.
"I would not have her," said Sharkey, "if
she was the daughter of a prince."
THE SWORDSMEN.
Baron Malchln and Sergeant Davis
Will Cross Steel To-Morrow.
The much-talkei-of sword contest be
tween Baron Malchin, the famous Russian
swordsman, and Sergeant Owen Davis of
troop A, United States army, will be de
cided to-morrow afternoon at Central Park.
Both of those noted swordsmen have
won many hard-fought victories, and it
Baron Ivan Malchin, the Swordsman.
goes without saying that their meeting in
Central. Park will be the signal for a.grand
exhibition with the steels.
According to the agreement which was
signed by the contestants a few weeks ago
the contest will be twenty-nine rounds
mounted and twenty-nine rounds on foot.
Davis is unquestionably a splendid
horseman and has few superiors as a
swordsman. His opponent must certainly
be as quick as a flash, judging from his
record, which places him among the
champion swordsmen of Russia. Among
the celebrated swordsmen whom the
Baron has defeated are V. Bolschiffe, cap
tain of the imperial army; Otto Wulfieus,
the instructor of the Imperial Military
Academy of Berlin; Emile Francois of
New York, J. Perriette of Minneapolis
and Theo Le Boeuff of Portland, Or.
Tne match is for $1000 a side and the
championship, and judging from the in
terest that has been manifested in the con
test by military men and those who love
to see a good square bout of any kiud Cen
tral ParK should be packed with people
to-morrow.
THE ANGLER.
Streams That Are in Good Condition
for Fishing.
The winter anglers, so called, are in
hopes of meeting with great success to
morrow. Latest reports from Point ReyeÃ,
Sonoma and San Gregorio state that the
creeks are running tolerably clear and
that some steeiheads have been taken al
ready.
Four large fish were caught at Point
Reyes yesterday, and as the water will be
in good condition to-morrow, provided
[ that the weather continues to remain fine,
| some good sport will ' certainly result.
James Watt, who was christened at the
last meeting of the Rod and Gun Club
\ "Teapot" Watt by John Butler, says that
j he will be a very much surprised man if
i he fails to catch less than half a dozen
large fish to-morrow at the point.
It has been stated on very good author
ity that the spearing of steelheaiis is a
pastime which is indulged in to a great
i extent by certain people who reside not
! very far away from Lagunitas Creek.
I The presence of a Deputy Fish Commis
-1 sioner on the banks of the stream may
give those law-breakers to understand
that the Fish Commission is still in ei
-1 istence.
Unless the parent fishes are protected it
cannot be expected that good trout fishing
will be had in the summer season. At the
j next meeting of the Legislature the pres-
I cnt law siying anglers a right to catch
steeiheads in tide waters may be amended
so as to read that all fishes taken in tide
waters by means of hook ana line during
i the closed season for trcut fishing must be
returned to the water immediately.
The large steelnead is not desirable as a
food fish, and only those anglers who are
covetous by nature will object to a law
which requires the immediate return to
the stream of breeding h'shes. The true
sportsman cares only for the pleasure he
enjoys in the hooking and playing of a
game steelhead. The fish itself is of no
value; its flesh is as dry as a chip and al
most flavorless. It can be safely said that
every steelhead killed at. this season of the
year means a loss of several hundred small
trout to the stream from which the fish
has been taken. Kill off the large fishes
and you destroy the goose that laid the
golden egg.
THE GUN.
Splendid Weather for Quail Shoot
ingâThe Ibis Club Case.
Sportsmen should certainly make the
best of tba few weeks that remain of the
shooting season, which will close on Feb
ruary 15. Latest reports from Suisun
state that mallard ducks are quite plenti
ful in the Cordelia Club grounds, but that
sprig, canvasback, widgeon, etc., are
scarce. Numbers of birds have returned
to the Alviso marshes, and some irood
shooting sfiould be enjoyed to-day and to
morrow.
In the vicinity of Mount Eden two
hunters bagged between fifty and sixty
birds yesterday, princiDally sprig, spoon
bill and bluebill.
Sportsmen who prefer quail shooting to
thai of popping broadbills from a "blind"
in the swamps, should certainly be in the
swim during the present spell of fine
weather. The birds will now be found on
the high lands enjoying the pleasures of
a sun bath, where the undergrowth is low
and sparse.
The case of the Ibis Club against some
members of the Mallard Club, which was
to be heard in the United States District
Court in a few days, has been indefinitely
postponed.
CALEDONIAN GAMES.
Chief Crowley Replies to a Request
From the Chieftain of the Club.
The athletes of the State are looking
forward to the great meeting of the
Caledonian Club, which will be held at
Shell Mound Park in May next. D. R.
McNeil, the energetic and enterprising
; chieftain of the club, proposes to give
â  exceptionally tine prizes at this famous
gat-iering of the clans.
Now that the policemen of this City will
have an opportunity of decreasing their
avoirdupois by exercises on the trapeze,
| bag-puncbhig, etc., an excellent tug-of
| war team should be selected from among
I the stars of the curriculum.
The Caledonian Club is in hopes that the
Chief of Police will permit a team from
the force an opportunity of coutesting for
the grand tug-of-war prize, but the
Chief is evidently afraid that his soldiers
will require : i more 'â¢'â  than : four months of
hard training to put them in condition for
. any physical ; exercise ; that > might injure
their constitutions and '.'staying qualities."
.'* In reply to a request from the Caledonian
Club to permit a team of ten men a leave
of absence on the occasion of the great
games day, this is what the Chief says: r
'_ D. R. McNeil Esq.. Chief Caledonian Club; 111
Larkm street. Cityâ Dear Sir: Replying to
your, note |of the* 25th inst., stating that the
Caledonian Club will hold its "grand annual
gathering and games" on the last Saturday in
May next at Shell ; Mound Park, Berkeley, and
stating that if entries can be had from the
police force your club would offer suitable
special prizes for races and other events in
order that police officers may compete, etc.,
you are informed that the gymnasium for the
police force is of such recent construction that
their althletic training up to the time men
tioned will not be of such a character as to
enable , them to compete for prizes. .Very re
spectfully, p. ckowlky, Chief of Police.

The Kennel.
Many of the disgruntled sportsmen who
witnessed the field trials at Bakersfield
are now discussing the advisability of
forming a pointer club. With the excep
tion of one or two men who are of the
opinion that the English setter is the only
dog worth having, the majority of the
sportsmen who witnessed the finish of the
trials say that the pointer Glenbeigh Jr.
should certainly have first prize.
Nimrod. the English setter, that won
nrst, was bred by 0. X. Post, who acted as
one of the judges. A. Jackson, C. N. Post
and Mr. Pyk- o f Bakersfield were the
judges. Jackson was strongly in favor of
giving first prize to the pointer, but Post
and Pyle, after deliberating over the mat
ter for several hours, decided in favor of
the setter, and their decision was not, by
any means, favorably received by those
who were interested in the contests.

SMITH IS NOW RECEIVER
The Atlantic and Pacific Rail
road Passes Into His
Hands To-Day.
Chester H. Speers Superseded as Local
Passenger Agent by John L.
Truslow.
In accordance with the actions of the
United State? Circuit Judges in New Mex
ico, Arizona and Southern California,
through which the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad, which is part ol the Santa Fe
system, runs, United States Circuit Judge
McKenna here, yesterday, appointed C. W.
Smith the new receiver.
The appointment takes effect to-day and
the Atlantic and Pacific road will there
fore pass out of the hands of John J. Mc-
Cook and Aldace F. Walker, the former re
ceivers. Joseph C. Wilson, who had been
appointed one of the three original re
ceivers, died.
Judge McKenna's action waa based upon
the recommendations of the counsel for
the railroad and the United Stater, Trust
Company of New Yotk, both of which are
defendants in the suit of the Mercantile
Trust Company of New York. Singularly
enough, the appointment was not in
deference to any expressed wishes of the
Mercantile T rust Company, for Mr. Smith
had not been recommended, by the plaintiff
cornoration. Mr. Smith's bond was fixed
at $30,000, and he will be Tequired to file a
complete inventory with Special Master
Henry L. Warren at once. Mr. Warren
will report to the court what compensa
tion shall be made to the old receivers, for
no stated amount was fixed when they
were appointed.
Mr. Smith is fairly well known in this
State. He has been interested in the Ba
den Stockyard Company. He is at pres
ent m Los Angeles.
C. N. Sterry of Albuauerque, general at
torney for the company^ and John J.
Byrne of Los Angeles, the general passer.
cer agent, are both in the City, stopping
at the Palace Hotel. Mr. Byrne will in
stall into his new position John J. Trus
low of Santa Barbara, who has been made
assistant general passenger aeent here to
succeed Chester H Speers. Mr. Truslow
was general agent in this City some years
ago. Lately he has represented his com
pany in Santa Barbara. Mr. Speers goes
to Chicago to accept a resDonsible position
in the Santa Fe general offices. He will
rest a few weeks in San Diego before going
East.

Attorney Treadwell. Mrs. Oden was on the
stand beinp subjected to a severe cross-examin
ation, wnich finally caused her to rush at the
offending attorney and give him two resound
ing slaps on the right jaw. Mrs. Oden was
promptly told that she was in contempt of
court, but was Inter released when she apolo
gized and promised to do bo no more.

HITE MINE HORROR.
Further Particalitrg of the Disastrous
Explosion "Which Literally Tore
Two Men to Pieces.
In regard to the Hite mine accident,
which occurred on the 28th ult., a letter
from John I. Minear, superintendent of the
mine, written to his father, from Mariposa
on the 30th, says:
The accident was most horrible and sicken
ing in all its details; in fact such a destruc
tion of human beings is hard to describe.
Mr. Moodie, the underground boss, and I
were in the mine forty minutes after the ex
plosion. The gas was horrible. It made us
sick. I stood it very well, although sick after
ward.
It took seven men about two hours to gather
up the pieces of flesh and put them to sheets.
One or two pieces of flesh could be identified.
No portion of the faces of ci.her was found.
The man who escaped death was at the station
more than a hundred feet away from the ex
plosion. He is all right now, but he does not
remember anything. So bow the accident
happened will always remain a secret.
Yesterday Mr. Matthews and I drove in here
with the bodies. The Coroner was here and in
readiness, and the inquest was held at once.
The verdict of the jury exonerated the com-
Sany from all blame. The bodies will be buried
ere to-day. I had intended to forward the
body of James Kluge to his friends in San
Francisco, but the Coroner ordered them
buried here. This seemed necessary. The
company owed J. Kluge $36 88 and William
Sterns $17, which I paid into the hands ol the
Coroner.
Notify H. Kluge, 1929J4 Union street, of the
disposition of his brother s body. The disaster
has caused some of our miners to quit and
others will follow. It rocked the station pump
and cars. At first I thought the pump was en
tirely ruined â but not so. In two or three
days more we will have it repaired and run
ning again. In the meantime we will keep the
water down with the skip.
PARALYSIS.
From the Press, New York City.
Morris Preslaner of No. 1 Pitt street, New
York, who is a real estate agent and collector
of rents, caught a severe cold early last spring,
which settled upon his kidneys. SoonJ he be
gan to suffer severe pain in his backbone, sides
and chest. His symptoms grew rapidly more
alarminc, until at last he was as helpless as a
child and could scarcely move as he lay on his
bed.. As Mr. Preslaner is well k;:own in the
part of town where he resides, he had many
sympathizers, who did all they could to help
him.
Though a native of Berlin> Mr. Preslaner has
lived in this country for /forty years, having
served the country of his adoption by three
years' hard service in the civil war. He en
listed with the Nineteenth Illinois Infantry,
taking part in many battles and marching
with General Sherman to the sea. While in
Georgia Mr. Preslaner was promoted to first
sergeant for bravery on the field of action. He
is now a member of Koltes Post, G. A. R., and
is one of the most popular men in the post.
Mr. Preslaner told a reporter tbe story of his
dreadful illness and wonderful recovery. The
reporter met him as he was returning from a
long walk, and, saying that he had heard of
his wonderful cure, asked him to tell the
story. When Mr. Preslaner was comfortably
seated in his pieasant parlor he told the fol
lowing story, which, he said, he hoped every
one who was suffering as he had suffered
would read. His words were as follows: "To
begin with, I was taken sick just a year and a
month ago, having taken a severe cold which
settled on my kidneys. At first I thought the
pain I suffered would soon pass away, but in
stead of doing this it grew more intense every
day, so that in a week I could walk only with
considerable difficulty.
"I called in a doctor, who said I had locomo
tor ataxia, and began treating me for that dis
ease. He did me no good, and all summer long
I could scarcely attend to my business at all.
Then I called another doctor and took his
medicine for several weeks, but experienced
no relief. Dr. Truman Nichols of 287 East
Broadway, whom I at last called in, helped me
more than any of the other doctors, but along
toward fall I grew worse, despite his treat
ment. I think Dr. Nicools is a good doctor and
understood my case, but despite this fact his
medicines did me no lasting good
"Early in November the little strength I had
in my legs left me and I was unable to stand
The pain in my back and sides became almost
unbearable, and my limbs grew cold. An elec
tric battery I bought failed to help me. and for
weeks I felt myself gradually growing weaker,
until all hope left me.
"Some time before this I had read of a won
derful cure a man had received from Dr. Wil
liams' Pink Pills for Pale People, but was so
prejudiced against what I thought was a
patent medicine of the usual worthless char
acter that I could not make up my mind to try
them. As my pains increased and death
seemed coining near, I thought, of what I had
rtad and of the symptoms ofthe man who had
been cured. 1 hey were precisely the same as
mine, and at last, with my wite's earnest en
treaty, I consented to try the Pink Pills.
'I am now convinced that these mils saved
my lite. Gradually my strength began to re
turn; the desire to live grew stronger within
me. After having taken three boxes I left my
bed. This was early in March. AU pain had
left me, and that terrible dead feeling in my
legs had gone away. 1 was still very
weak, but before I had taken the
fourth dox I was able to get downstairs for a
short walk in the open air. Now I feel as if I
had been born again and am as happy as a
child. .Every pleasant day I take a walk and
am sure that in a month I will be as well as
ever."

So Says D. M. Delmas
Concerning Â£ A.
Spreckels.
HIS FATHER THE VICTIM
The Suit Instituted in Hawaii
Has No Other End
in View.
COURT ASKED TO INTERFERE.
Argument in the Case of Claus Spreck
els Against the Hawaiian Commer
cial and Sugar Company.
Mr. Delmas occupied nearly the whole
day yesterday in his argument before
Judge Troutt in the suit of Claus Spreckels
against the Hawaiian Commercial and
Sugar Company, its directors and attor
neys.
The action is brought to restrain the de
fendant from prosecuting an acUon in the
Hawaiian Islands where the company as
plaintiff seeks to compel Claus Spreckels
to deed over to them some 6000 acres of
land, held by him, it is claimed, in trust
for the company.
Mr. Delmas briefly recited the facts al
leged in the complaint filed in the Ha
waiian Islands as follow* :
Claus Spreckels, it is averred, about twenty
years ago agreed with Herman Schusler, Fred
erick K. Low, William F. Babcock and Herman
Bendel, all residents of San Francisco, that he
would ascertain whether a large sugar planta
tion could be established on the island of Maul,
one of the Hawaiian Islands, and, if so, tjiai no
would secure the necessary land und, with the
others, form a corporation under the laws of
i'alifornia for the purpose of owning and ope
rating the same.
That such a corporation known as the
Hawaiian Commercial Company, the prede
cessor of the defendant here, was formed in
October, 1878.
That Claus Spreckels became the general
spent and manager of that corporation and
was charged with the duty, therefore, of act-
Ing with undivided devotion to its interests
without permitting his own personal advant
*ge to interfere with the duty which he owed
to the corporation.
That he purchased certain lands on the
Island of Maui, known as the Ahnpuaa of
Wailuku, which were needed by the corpora
tion, and paid for them with the money of the
corporation and that he now retains the legal
title in his own name.
Though the subnet-matter upon which the
trust operates be land it is a complete abuse of
terms to say that this is an action to recover
land.
The action is a personal one. The decree
Operates not upon the land but upon the de
fendant in person. The thing prayed lor and
Bought is not the land, but einiply the con
veyance of i he legal title.
The plaintiff asks for the discharge of a duty
which thf- defendant owes him. That duty is
an obligation wnich follows the defendant
whithersoever he goes and wheresoever he
abides, and performance may be demanded
from him anywbere.
So purely personal is this action that in this
State, notwithstanding the provisions of the
lonstitution, it may be brought in any connty
where the d> fendant resides.
ihe only question arising, then, upon the
Semurrer !â ?: Do the averments of the -com
plaint. now here presented to this court, bring
this case YJithin tlie scope of equity jurispru
ience?
The facts of course are admitted by the de
murrer. What are they?
In tne first place the parties are all residents
and citizens of California.
The plaintiff and the defendant, as well as
the defendants Russell J. Wilson, Mountford
B. Wilson, Charles S. Wheeler, Rudolph Spreck
tls and B. J. Hoffacker, are, and were at the
lime said action was instituted, citizens and
residents of the State of California.
The residence of all the parties who at any
lime acted as directors or officers of said two
corporations, the Hawaiian Commercial Com
pany and the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar
Company, who are now living, is in the State
of California. Among these are Hermann
Bendel, Hermann Schussler, H. L. Dodpe, John
D. Spreckels, A. B. Spreckels, William Babcock
and Antoine JtJorel. In matters of purely per
lonal obligations or duties the State always
affords protection under its own law 3to its
own citizens.
A citizen of this State may bring In the
courts of this State an action against a for
tigner found in this State to recover upon an
obligation accrued to him against said for
eigner in a foreign State. Thus, for instance,
a citizen of California may sue the Union Pa
cific Company (a foreign corporation) in the
;ourts of this State for personal injuries suf
fered by him in any place outside of Califor
nia.
Proper tribunals to try questions arising
from personal obligations betweeuCaiifornians
are the tribunals of California.
The obligation in this cese, if any, arose from
relations created and existing in California
between Californians and under California
laws.
The bill of complaint alleges that certain
agreements and contracts were entered into
between plaintiff and other persons, and the
bill is largely based upon the alleged duties
and obligations springing from said alleged
igreemen is and contracts. AH of said alleged
agreements and contracts, !f made at all, were
made within the State of California. The
jbligations. if any. arising under them arise, if
at all, and must be ascertained and measured
by the lawÃ of this State as interpreted by its
courts; and the plaintiff has a clear, legal and
equitable right to have said agreements and
Jontracts, if they exist, ascertained and meas
ured by this standard. Tnose laws, and the
tonstruction which the courts of this State
have placed upon them, if defendant is per
mitted to proceed in his action in the courts of
the Hawaiian Islands, will have to be proved
as facts before those courts, for they cannot
take judicial cognizance thereof. To establish
by competent evidence in such a foreign and
distant tribunal the laws and decisions of this
State would be an undertaking involved in
freat doubt and uncertainty, jeopardizing the
legal and equitable rights of the plaintiff.
The bill of complaint alleges that certain
iduciary relations existed between the plain-
US and the Hawaiian Commercial Company
tnd the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany, arising both from trusts created by con
tract and implied trusts arising from positions
â¢lleged to have been occupied by plaintiff
toward said corporation, and the bill of com
plaint is largely based upon the alleged duties
and obligations of the plaintiff springing from
those fiduciary relations. The existence, na
ture and Jbxtent of these fiduciary relations, if
my existed, are to be determined by the laws
af this State as interpreted by its courts. The
laws of the republic of Hawaii upon the mat
ters in contest are different from those of this
;tate, and if defendant is permitted to pro
ceed in his action in that republic, the plain
:iff's rights under the laws of this State will be
mr.aired. if not wholly destroyed.
The nature of the contract made, the obliga
tions assumed and the breach of those obliga
uoiis must, whenever the case is tried, be de
termined by the law of the place where the
contract is entered into.
The defendant wanted Clrus Spreckels to
lign a deed to a piece of land. Why should he
be dragged 2000 miles ucross the sea to do this
â¢ hen ail (he parties in interest, the books and
records were here and could be produced in
Jourt in twenty-four hours? Why should
thcÂ»e books and records be subjected twice to
the dangers of the 6ea? All the parties to this
.itigation are men of large affairs. Such a
tourney would necessarily meau great lO3S and
Inconvenience to all of them. The defendant
here, who is plaintiff over there, willingly puts
himself to this trouble and loss in order that
ne may put hiu adversary to still greater
;rouble and cause him greater loss. I will now
ihow your Honor a line of authorities from
fourth Cushing down, all setting their faces
igainst such iniquitous proceedings. The
iourts Eay that no man may take such an ad
ran tage of another as this seeking the courts
distant States or countries where the laws
ire different or, mayhap, especially favor their
Mr. Delroas went on to say that the only
purpose of bringing this suit in Hawaii
Bras to harass, vex and annoy the plaintiff
acre. It was instigated by C. A. Spreckels
irith the purpose of annoying his father,
â¢ purpose he has steadily pursued for years
and which was admitted here in the de
murrer. The plaintiff comes before a
court of equity asking that he be stayed in
this purpose, "and if his petition "is not
granted, 11 said Mr. Delma3, "then it will
be the first time in the history of our juris
prudence thut such a plea has been de
nied. For it would be a confession of
cowardice, that the courts could not pro
tect the public."
Charles S. Wheeler made reply for the
defendant. He denied the last statement
of the counsel on the other side, and said
that C. A. Spreckels was not a party to the
suit at all. He said that all the arguments
advanced against the plaintiff going to
Hawaii applied with equal force to the
trial of the case here, as the witnesses
necessary to prove their case were there.
Counsel will submit to the court their
arguments, together with their respective
lists of authorities.

The Case of Goetze Against
Goetze Nearly Ended in
a Row.
Mrs. Goetze, the Defendant, Objected
to Testimony Which Impugned
Her Character.
The case of \Viiliam Goetze against his
wife, Dora Yvinters Goetze, to annul the
marriage which binds the one to the other,
has been submitted to Judge Sanderson for
decision. It was not submitted, however,
without some trouble, for the prelim
inaries to quite a little family fight were
all gone through with before the Deputy
Sheriff interfered and ordered the fight off.
The suit is brought by Goetze to have
annulled his marriage with Miss Dora
Winters. He married her under com
pulsion, he says, because she claimed he
was the father of her child, which was
born in March, 1894. He says her father
threatened to kill him, the Grand Jury
threatened to indict him, and between the
pistol and the penitentiary and the pen
itentiary and a marriage he chose the mar
riaee. ana now he wants it annulled.
The plaintiff's side of the case, which
has, at different times, occupied a couple
of day 3in Judge Sanderson's court, was
finished late in the afternoon and within
an hour the defendant had submitted her
evidence and the case was submitted.
Goetze himself occupied the stand most of
the afternoon telling tow he met the girl
and how he had finally stopped calling
upon her; how he had been threatened by
the Grand Jury witlj indictment, and how
Miss Winters' father haa offered to use a
pistol on him at any time should he refuse
to link hiÂ» fortunes with the daughter.
Mrs. Goetze and her father were the prin
cipal witnesses for the defense. Mr.
Winters was called to tell that he never
offered to use a pistol upon his reluctant
son-in-law, and that he never made any
threats which were calculated to inspire a
desire for matrimony in any one's heart.
Mrs. Goetze told of her relations with
Goetze; how he visited the house and
took her to parties and picnics, and how
he had allowed it to be generally under
stood that some time he and she would be
married. Some very pointed questions
were asked her, and these she resented.
She also resented the attempt of the plain
tiff to deny the paternity of the child, ana
she left the stand very much incensed.
The case was submitted and court had
adjourned, and the plaintiff and plain
tiff's witnesses and the defendant and de
fendant's witnesses, and a bevy of counsel
for each, were making for the door, when
the defendant contingent made a rush for
the plaintiff and, but for the witnesses and
his counsel, would have secured posses
sion of him. That they would have done
any more than that to him is doubtful,
but counsel for both sides immediately
called for a squad of Deputy Sheriffs, and
they, coming opportunely upon the scene,
destroyed wbat prospects there were for a
fight. " The defendant does not mind the
legitimate testimony of the case, but she
objects strongly to any attempt to injure
her character. The plaintiff denies any
such motive, but still asks for an annul
ment of his marriage.
WHITE'S BIG MORTGAGE.
Directors of Sun Insurance Com
pany Swear It Was
Bona Fide.
The Round Valley King's Ex-Wife
Claims That the $70,000 Loan
Was a Scheme.
Three voluminous sealed depositions
were filed with the County Clerk yesterday
by ex-Mayor E. B. Pond, Colonel C. L.
Taylor and William If. Friend, directors
of the Sun Insurance Company, in support
of the validity of a loan of $70,000 made
several years ago by the company to
George E. White, the cattle-king and auto
crat of Round Valley.
White, through nis attorney, Barclay
Henley, does not purpose to offer any
opposition to the foreclosure suit that has
been instituted against hia extensive Men
docino County acres, on which, the loan
was made. But Mrs. White, the ex-wife of
the wealthy landowner, is not so willing to
see so much property separated from the
White estates, particularly as she has a
suit against her former husband for
alimony.
Mrs. White's lawyers claim that the
mortgage was a scheme between the Sun
Insurance Company and George E. White,
by means of which the White property
was to be apparently very much depleted,
while in fact the amount was never pai.d.
]$x-Mayor Pond, speaking last night of
the suit, said that he and his fellow-direc
tors had made detailed affidavits regard
ing the circumstances of the loan which
had been made to White several years aeo
to pay certain debts in accordance with an
order of court. The Sun Insurance Com
pany had at the time sent ita expert up to
exploit the property, and upon his recom
mendation the amount had been advanced
to White. That, continued Mr. Pond, was
before the marital misunderstandings be
tween White and his wife. Much of the
$70,000, Mr. Pond believed, had been paid
over by White at once to different credi
tors.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
STAINED GLASS SEALS.
Various Colleges Will Be Rep
resented at the University
Club.
MR. BRUCE PORTER'S DESIGNS.
The Windows for Harvard and Annap
olis Will Be Put in Their
Places To-Day.
A movement has been started among
members of the University Club to have
stained glass windows bearing the college
seals of the institutions whence they come.
The first two of these series of artistic
productions will go in place to-day. One
of them represents Harvard University

and the other Annapolis, the naval acad
emy. The former was purchased by sev
eral graduates of Harvard and the latter
is the gift of Frank J. Syrames, who is a
graduate of the naval institution,
"I suppose," eaid Mr. Symmes yester
day, "that in a few months all of the eight
een spaces set aside for these windows will
be occupied by the college seals of most all
the leading educational institutions in the
world. Any college that happens to have
a representative who is a member of our
club will no doubt attend to it that some- I
thing in the shape of a stained glass win
dow adorns the line.
"They will occupy a portion of space
over the main window in the dining-room,
and the two that will be placed in position
to-morrow are excellent designs. Of course,
the seals will be made according to the
prescribed heraldic colors, but the sur
| rounding ornamentations are practically
I left to the Rentleman who has the matter I
in charge, Bruce Porter. They will permit
of varied artistic surroundings, and the
Harvard and Annapolis designs are excel- !
lent specimens of the kind that.will in all '

"The next two will be Yale and West

graduates of those two institutions, and

and other colleges will be represented
sooner or later, and within a year the col
lection will be one of the handsomest in
the United States. We have made a great
many improvements at the club of late,
and these seals are among the most elabo
rate.
"The Harvard seal has been changed a
great many times, but the one now ac
cepted and recognized was adonted in 1885.
It was that seal which has been made for
the University Club. Just as fast as seals
can be arranged for and designed by Mr.
Porter, they will be given a place among
the group; and when everything is filled
up, if it becomes necessary, more space
will be made. Most of us feel an affection
for our colleges, and little time will be lost
now that the fever is on in arranging a
complete set. 1 '
Mr. Porter has certainly used consider
able artistic taste in his work for these
windows, and the highest order of the art
of stained window manufacture and crea
tion has been brought into play. The
technique and arrangenientsjof sy mbolisms
is of the best, and a careful study of the
colors and elements of heraldry have en
abled him to develop not only works of art
but absolutely correct seals. Altogether,
Mr. Porter's designs are so well executed
that he has been rewarded with the in
formation that he is to make them all.
His Annapolis seal is literally a history of
the United States in glass and indicates in
a measure every epoch in the life of the
Union.
The windows will be duly received a lit
tle later on. when more are in, by an ocas
sion commensurate with the dignity of the
high educational institutions they repre
sent.
MEETING OF CREDITORS.
Fuhia Brothers Will Continue in Busi
ness With General Consent.
There was a meeting of the creditors of
Fulda Brothers' p'.aning-mill yesterday
afternoon at the Board of Trade. It ended
very amicably in the determination to let
the firm continue the business. Fulda's
assets, including stock and machinery
that originally cost over $30,000, were rated
at $6500. And the sum was found
to be only $500 short of the total amount
of the liabilities.
The Dunham-Carrigan Company, Pacific
Rolline Mills. Black Diamond Coal Com
pany, and one or two other well-known
firms, are the chief creditors. They ex
press every confidence in the firm, and feel
certain that in a few months Fulda Broth*
ers will be firmly on tlieir feet again.
The firm lays its difficulties to the bad
state of trade in the past year and its fail
ure to collect outstanding debts. There i 3
every reason to believe, however, the firm
said yesterday, that a business revival had
Ret in and that their difficulties would soon
be overcome.
TWENTY* YEARS.
Vhilip Bntz of the North Bench Gang
Gets His Deserts From Judge
Wallace.
Philip Ratz, convicted of a felonious
asseult upon Julia Christiansen, a little
girl of 13, was sentenced to twenty years'
imprisonment in the penitentiary by
Judge Wallace yesterday.
Ratz's attorney moved for a new trial
before sentence was pronounced, his prin
cipal contention being that the court
erred in not instructing the jury to acqnit,
in accordance with ' the I request of the
defense. :. The V motion *to : instruct v .was
made upon the ground that - the -only
evidence which showed that the crime had
been committed â¢* before the girl , was 14
; years old was given by the. girl herself, and
as "i she ) was an 1 accomplice her evidence,
unsupported us it was, could not be con
sidered. The court held,- however, tbat
the same law which places the age of f con
sent at 14 makes it impossible : for a child
under that age to become an v accomplice,
and the motion for a new trial was there

by Fame's Celery Compound.
The most striking personality in Chi-
cago, and the oldest real-estate dealer, is
Mr. L. A. G'lbert Mr. Gilbert is now over
60 years of age ; in the '50' s he was in the
Rockies gold-huntine. Since 1868 he has
handled more property in Chicago and is
known to more home-owners than any
other man in the business.
Mr. Gilbert at one time suffered from
rheumatism and sleeplessness, tie made
trips to Hot Springs, and tried other
methods of treatment without avail. To
satisfy a friend who had taken Paine's
celery compound for similar troubles, and
knew what it could do, Mr. Gilbert tried it.
and but a very short titae elapsed before
he was entirely freed from both these
troubles. Mr. Gilbert himself says:
Gentlemenâ l have suffered with rheu-
matism and sleeplessness for years, caused
by exposure while prospecting in the
mountains years ago. For years I had to
take electric bath massage and take trips
to Hot Springs in order to get a little sleep

THE PUBLIC FREE MARKET
Discussion of the Question by

GROWER VS. COMMISSION MAN.
San â  Francisco a Market From Which
Unsatisfactory Returns Are

Yesteiday the i California State horti
cultural Society met in the Mills building
and discussed the Free City Market ques
tion. ; Besides the members' of the society
there were present: B. F. : Walton 1 of the
State Grange, M. S. -Kohlberg of the
Merchants' Association, â  Frank â  â¢ Dalton,
president of the San Francisco Fruit Ex
change, E. F. Adams of Highland Grange,
Brainard N. Rowley, publisher of the Cali
fornia Fruit-grower, and H. P. Stabler of
Yuba County, , all ,of whom spoke upon
; the subject. President : Colnon was un
able ; to be present, but sent an " offer of
500x50 feet of section 4 of the 'seawall .with
a shed for a free market. ' â¢. I
Mr. Adams discussed the proposition at
length, and spoke of ; the different advan
tages that would accrue' from the : estab
lishment of a market where 1 the producer
could directly â â â ; meet >.' the' consumer. He
said there is a bitter, feeling between the
two, and the man in the country â  believes
that ' the man "in .the City ; squeezes him.
*He had heard that the " grower had occa
sionally sent people to buy a box of fruit
to â¢ learn i how this â¢ sale stood ;in with the
returns ? ailed' to I the [ shipper. '-, This : is
talked of among the growers,' and they are
becoming more and more dissatisfied.
y Mr. Dal tori: expressed himself as being
unable to see any practicable benefit in a
free market. The principal fruit orchards
are too far from San Francisco. Vacaville,
which is about sixty miles away, is- the
first \ shipper â of A tne v season ; ' and what
grower will come from that distance with:
his car of produce for the purpose of sell
ing it off in the free ; market. San Fran
cisco is not located for a free market ? She
is v nearly : surrounded '"I by /, water, conse
quently no' farmer can haul bis produce
into the City, as vis â¢ done â¢ where F free mar
kets are found practicable. : He said :
The vegetable markets at the corner of Davis
and Pacific streets are free markets, yet | noth
ing is sold at retail there, and we never hear
that consumers receive any concessions there
over the purchasers in other localities. .
.'.Jackson and Washington street wharves are
practically free markets where fruit and prod
uce are bought and sold. Regarding my own
business as a .wholesale - fruit-dealer, :90 | per
cent of my consignments are sold to the can
ner before it reaches the . market. The â  buyer
hauls iit ?. away . at -5 his > own â -. expense. If ! the
grower would ship a better quality, and not
try to force the market with an inferior grade
â in short, If he would take the advice of the
commission man once in a whileâ there would
not be so much dissatisfaction and tnat bitter
feeling spoken of between the country and the
city man. I believe that the appointment of a
. fruit inspector, such as : has :â  been - suggested,
would be wise. Last summer the market was
flooded with green and unsalable cantaloupes,
which were thrown overboard. There should
be an inspector to condemn and check the ship
ment of an inferior class of produce. ;, I am in
favor ? of any i concentration . of ; businessâany
bringing together of the â¢ grower and commis
sion manâ and I am also in favor of high prices.
We want no cneap fruit in this marketr^-'^v^-g;
- B. F. Walton of Yuba stated that ] the
value of the fruit upon reaching the mar
ket depended upon i the | packer â  and j also
upon the mode of delivery. He said: . .â  . -
Berries which of necessity are quickly
about, and 1 took it. From the start I
noticed improvement, and I am now in the
best of health and able to get around as
lively as any youngster 1 know. Yours
truly, L. A. GILBERT.
The most rational way of getting rid of
rheumatism, neuralgia and insomnia and
getting back sound health is to husband
every mite of strength and to set abont a
radical, all-round restoring of the tired
system with Paine's celery compound.
It is your business to. furnish the body
with nervous energy as fast and abun-
dantly as you can, and to get a richer,
purer blood supply. There is no way in
which this restorative process can be so
swiftly brought about as by using Paine's
celery compound.
There is nothing known to physicians of
the most extensive practice equal to
Paine's celery compound for purifying the
blood and making strong, healthy nerves.
Unremitting work at last brings down the
vitality of the strongest men and women.
Every one has felt that ambitionless, list-
less feeling. There are many persons who

cause they are not sick abed, who are
tievertheless sadly "outof health." Paine's
spoiled, if properly shipped, quickly delivered
and speedily disposed oi, are always in prime
condition. Visitors to San Francisco say our
fruit is poor. I agree with Mr. Daltou as re
gards choice fruit and quick transportation
and the driving of the poor produce off the
market. I am in favor of a free market, be
cause I think it will bring the grower, agent
and consumer nearer together.
Mr. Kohlberg said he expected to see
more of the growers present, and he was
not satisfied with their absence. They
ware the ones most interested and for
whom this question had been raised. The
Merchants' Association was for thÂ»m, but
they must let it understand their desires.
B. N. Rowley, publisher of the Fruit
grower, was not enthusiastic on free mar
kets. He said :
A few years ago I tried to get up one, but
failed signally. The dealers stood on their
dignity and said they were merchants, and not
cart or basket hucksters, and I was told to go
off and sit down. I have no confidence in the
scheme, because no farmer or grower can
come across the bay and into Ran Francisco for
the purpose of selling his fruit. I am not
against the propositionâ l simply have no
faith in it; and I don't think the society
should take the initiative. The growers them
selves should make the first move.
Hon. H. P. Stab ler said one indication
that the free market was a good thing was
that the commission merchants are against
it. Said he:
I am in favor of the market or anything that
will give the grower a show. San Francisco is
a very poor market. I have sent packages by
express, which were delivered in good con
dition; and I have scut the same quality to J
commission merchant and did not get enough
to pay freight. All over the State there is
feeling among growers that theyge t the worst o f
the deal, and the middlemen gets the cream oi

'^tr* MEN
"He's a strong man," you hear people say â "muscles like
anchor ropes." The strongest men in muscular power are usually
the weakest in vital strength. . The demand upon vitality to keep
up large muscles, expansive chest and abdomen usually eats up
the energy which should go to the more delicate organs. It is a
proven fact that 5 fleshy men are . weak in vital force more,
than small men. .
The cause is the extra demand upon the powers to feed these
large tissues. Such men need ;
"MAKES PEOPLE STRONG."
It builds new vigor in the weakened system, adds to the
vital energy and makes men equal in strength in every function.

celery compound exactly fits the cases or
these uneasy, sleepless, sallow-faced men
and women. They are on the perilous
edge of some organic disease. Paine'*
celery compound will drag them back and
plant their feet squarely on firm ground.
By regulating the nervous 3ystem and com-
pelling the vitiated bloort to gain a larger
proportion of red corpuscles, all the organs
of the body whose business it is to repair
and rebuild the tissues are aroused^ Piine's
celery compound does not fail to increase
the appetite, to augment the powers of as-
similation, to increase the weight of the
body, to purify the blood and to stop the
progress of structural changes, when liver
and kidney diseases have fastened them-
selves upon the system.
There is not a single city without some
perfectly attested cure of liver or kidney
disease, chronic constipation, salt rheum,
plaguing eczema or general poor health,
by the use of Paine's celery compound.
Impaired strength and unstrung nerves,
made known by numbness of the limbs,
nervousness and a dissatisfied state of the

the business. Still, I think the growers should
be heard before this society acts in tho matter.
The following resolutions, by E, V.
A.dams, were unanimously adopte.l:
Resolved, That in the judgment of this soci
ety it is highly important that all commission
business transacted for account of producers
should be kept entirely separate from any pri
vate business in which the agent may be en
gaged, and that the returns made to pioducera
should be exact and no average returns be
made.
Resolved, That in our contracts with commis
sion agents it is our understanding that all
sales will be made under the provisions of the
laws of California, and that we are to receive
the full price obtained, less charges, whether
the produce be sold in large or small quanti
ties.
Resolved, That we strongly favor the concen
tration of the entire wholesale trade in perish
able products for accounts of producers upon
the water front, under the jurisdiction of the
Harbor Commissioners, and that in our judg
ment the regulations of the market should
make the original entries of all sales public
records, and that provision should be made for
an inspector to enforce the regulations and to
perform such other duties as the name implies
and that may be found possible.
Resolved, That a committee of three be ap
pointed by the chair to represent this society at
all meetings and conferences called to consider
this subject.
Resolved, That the Merchants' Association be
requested to unite witn this society and other
organizations interested in calling a general
conference of organizations of producers and
sellers of perishable products, individual ship
pers, transportation companies and others in
terested to consider the subject of a free
wholesale market for perishable products on
the water front of San Francisco, under tnÂ«
jurisdiction of the Harbor Commissioners.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 31.â The stock mar
ket was strengthened during the early trading by
the agreement reached yesterday by the presidents
of the Anthracite roads in the matter of produc
tion and percentages. The announcement that
the sales agents would put up the price of coal at
their meeting to-day had a good effect and led to
buying of the stocks of the roads interested. As
predicted the agents met and advanced prices 25 to
&Â» nts per ton, and fixed the February output at
2,500,000 tons.

DUX'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 31.â R. G. Dun & Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
Failures in three weeks of January show liabilities
of $17,836,511 against $10,685,050 last year; In I
manufacturing, $9,661,119, thi5. year, against $2,Â« |
279,193 last year; in trading, $10,317,360 against
$8,166,267 last year. Failures this week have
been 404 in the United States against 354 last year,
and seventy In Canada against fifty- four last year.
Though ousiness is still waiting, there are some
signs of definite improvement. It is now believed I
j that the first payment for bonds will cause no i
| further pressure, - and the money markets â  are j
i easier as respects ans on collateral, though the !
j difficulty of making commercial loans still checks j
I operations. But large maturities at the end of >
j January have been met more; satisfactorily than
was expected, and merchants and bankers report
that the signs promise a good spring trade. Do
mestic trade recorded through clearing-houses is
6.5 ppr cent smaller than a year ago.
Signs of improvement in the iron and steel busi- !
ness are graifying, even though they spring from I
combinations controlling coke and ore. A contract |
for 20.000 tons of rails, Pacific delivery, taken by j
[ Rn Eastern concern in competition with foreign
makers, a contract for 8000 tons plates for the '.
East Jersey Water Works, contracts for 4000 tons '
cast pipe at .sl9 20. taken by Alabama works,
with contracts for the Commercial Cable and other >
buildings here, covering 3510 ions, are the main I
features, but there is also a better demand for wire I
nails after a long stagnation, and also for sheets.
Pigiron is rather weaker, the average for all prod
ucts being practically unchanged, and 11.4 per
per cent below the highest last year.
. Coke production has , again been cut down
10,975 't0ns in a single week. Anthracite pro
ducers and â  carriers have at last, made a new
agreement, dividing the spoils for the year, which.
it is supposed, will be more nearly observed than
others which have pr ceded.
The demand for boots. and shoes does not en
large, though prices still decline about 6 per ci nt
for, the week, and hides and leather are both
lower.
Cotton gords continue weak. Woolens are prac
tically unchanged. Pales of wool at the three
chief markets have diminished of late, manufac
turers buying only for present needs.
Wheat has again advanced about He for cash, but I
only l%c for May, although Atlantic exports are '
| little larger than a year ago. Corn -records little I
advance. Cotton is a shade | lower than a week
ago. The marketing of goods does not support the
brilliant estimates of increased consumption this
year. . Exports 'n January have been 50 percent
lees and receipts from plantations 39 per cent less
than last year. â¢-_â¢ â  -â 
The earnings of railroads in three weeks of Jan
nary were 9.9 per cent larger than last year. The
stock market has been lifted by these returns and
hopeful monetary conditions, so that the ' average
for railroad stocks is $1 81 per share and for trusts
81 84 per share higher than a week ago.' The ex
pectation of an anthracite settlement has been a
powerful factor, and it is gen- rally supposed that
prices will rise after the bond settlement.

COALâ Harrison's circular aays: '-During the
week there have been 11 arrivals from the Coast
mines with 21,124 tons, from Swansea 5787 tons.
The moderating of the weather has led to a falling
off in consumption of : domestic Coals this week,
still retailers cannot complain as they had a very
brisk trade for several | weeks past. Quotations re
main unchanged, although there is a disposition on
the part of importers to fill â¢ orders for future load
ing at less figures. There has been no accumula
tion of stock In yard I this month, except of Swan
sea, of which there Is consiueroble in store, but in
view of there being only about 16,000 tons that
can possibly arrive here in the next four months,
and the amount consumed will be fully double that
Quantity, hence about line next there will be only
a moderate quantity here. The accumulation of
tonnage in Australian waters Indicates large im
ports from that section tins year, and at prices that
will doubtless lead -to a largely Increased demand
for those grades over 1895. 1 Swansea Anthracite
lias lately been the popular Coal for steam uses,
but it will have a formidable competitor in New
castle," N. S. \V.. :as the variance 111 price will be
largely in favor of the latter. The difference in the
cost of loading these two characters of Coal to-day
is fully 75c V ton' in favor of the Australian."

Wan Glad to Meet Him.
Not long ago a celebrated novelist was
the Â«vest of honor at a brilliant reception.
He had heard the praises of his own work
until every one but a conceited man woald
have been faint and weary, but he had
borne up bravely through it all. Finally a
timid man was presented to him, who said,
with an apologetic air: "I'm ashamed to
confess it, but I haven't read one of your
books.' The novelise bent forward, a look
lof relief ana joy irradiating his facr. He
placed both nands on the newecomer's
shoulders. "My clear fellow." he said,
with a warmth he had not shown before,
even to those of high degree, "I'm glad to
meet you."â Philadelphia Inquirer.

WOMEN TO WORK FOR IT
Anxious to Secure' the Wilmer
ding Mechanical School
for Oakland.
A DOCTOR REGAINS REASON.
He Was Sandbagged in West Oakland
and Committed to Agnews a
Month Ago.
Oakland Office Sax Fp.axci.sco Call,)
903 Broadway, Jar.. 31. f
The Ebell Society ladies, who wt j really
the original promoters of the recent expo
sition, have undertaken to secure the Wil
â¢merdiiig ol Industry lor this city.
The fact tlutt they have taken up this
mattt-r is somewhat of a renection upon
the eentlemen who took up the task some
weeks ago ana who seemingly lost heart.
The ladies have called a mass-meeting
for Saturday afternoon at their rooms,
P"ourteenth and "Washington streets, for
the purpose of finding out whether there
is a possibility of securing the school for
this city, or whether there is a chance of
failure because of inability of the men.
These views will not be discussed directly,
but the presence of the ladies in the figbt
is of itself taken as proof that they con
sider their active support necessary to in
sure success.
The speakers chosen for to-mcrrow's
meeting are Miss Moliie E. Connors, editor
of Oakland Saturday Night; Dr. Annette
Buckel, Miss Kay Frank and W. R. Davis.
The vice-presidents are Mrs. John Yule,
Mrs. I. K. Sharon, Mrs. E.C.Williams,
Mrs. J. P. Ames, Miss E. B. Morton, Dr.
H. P. Van Kirk, Mrs. Emma Shatter
Howard, Mrs. Remi Chabot, Mrs. J. M.
Scotchler and Mrs. C. H. Redington.
In order to approach the regents of toe
university with any degree of assurance, it
will be necessary to guarantee a suitable
block uf land on which the Wilmerding
building can be erected. This it is esti
mated will cost from $20,000 to $25,000.
HIS REASON CAME BACK.
Dr. Green Is Released From Agnem
and If in Assailant Arrested.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 31.â Dr. I. E.
Green, who was found by the police in
\Ye6t Oakland, December 26 last, in an. in
sane condition and as such sent to Ag
news, has been released. His memory re
turned during a long sleep he experienced
last Tuesday. When he awoke he was
sane and remembered everything clearly
up to the time he lost his reason, a month
a?o. As soon as the physicians examined
him he was released, and he came to Oak
land, lie told the Chief of Police that on
the jiicht lie was found he had been sand
bagged and robbea. The assault deprived
him of his reason. He remembers the two
mfcn who assailed him and gives a good
description of them. The thieves struck
him over the forehead with a sandbag,
antl he remembers nothing further.
Dr. Green pave an accurate description
of the man who struck him to the Chief,
and Officer Cockerton arrested John Me-
Donough and brought him to the City
Prison. A search warrant was issued and
McDonough's home was searched and a
pair of gloves was found that Green recog- !
nizes as a pair he lost the night he was
robbed.
McDonoufrh is a member of the West
Oakland gang and is known as Slim Jim.
lie asked Dr. Green for some money for a
bed and walked for several blocks before
he we<? joined by the other two men, who
made the attack while McDonough went
through the doctor's clothes.
"I had quite a talk with him." said the
doctor this alternoon, "and looked him
over carefully. When he asked me for the
money his narb, manners and a peculiar
voice all impressed themselves on me.
Alter I pave him the money he offered to
carry my vaiise, and when I said it was
not iicavv and I would carry it myself he
walked along behind me. and I saw him
jump on my shoulder and strike me when
1 was attacked t>y the other two men. I
felt the blow across the bact of my neck
and fell forward. I shall stay here and
prosecute. Tiie watch 1 am particularly
desirous of regaining. It was a present
from my wife, who is now dead.' 1
"Is Dr. Green your right name?" was
asked.
"I will state frankly tbat it is not, but I
would not like to tell what it is. I am a
dentist by profession, and should the fact
ever reach my home that 1 was in an
fcsylurr. it would nearly ruin my business.
There is one thing, though, I should like
to have you priut. That is the superb
management of the Agnew& Asylum. It
is the nnest institution of its kind I ever
.saw. The attendants are gentle, and the
physicians know exactly how to treat the
patients."
WOOLSEY'S REGRETS.
He "Wanted to Pm Severe Words, bu
Refrained in Time.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 31.â Dr. Wool
sey and Attorney A. A. Moore resumed
hostilities in the Wettstein damage case
this morning, and for about an hour the
Kive and take style that prevailed through
out yesterday was repeated.
Dr. Woolscy objected to the examina
tion by the attorney. He said: "Its
tricky and demagogic. It's not proper;
it is reprehensible andâ andâ l can't ex
press it without swearing, and I'm not al
lowed to swear."
Attorney Moore asked to strike out Dr.
Woolsey's testimony as being given in ex
treme heat and excitement, and as not
being proper for an expert, but the motion
was denied. Then the attorney asked if
the doctor knew of various theories of the
nervous reflex.
'I know of none 9uch wild and woolly
theories," said the doctor.
"Wild and wooily or wild and Woolsey?"
asked Moore, and they all luughed.
"Doctor, you are wild."
"Well, you are wilder," said the witness.
"1 want to say something about water
cushions. You know, gentlemen, that
water transmits shocks. There is a law
in this State against killing fish by ex
plosions in water. It kills them, and you
can't tell what did it. I suppose that Mr.
Mot-re has brought down chipmunks by
punching under a limb with a pole."
"It is evident that if lam to examine
the witness further," said Attorney Moore,
" I fchall have to chloroform him. So
with this 1 will say, 'Come down, doctor.'"
This ended the testimony of the plain
tiff, and the hrst time that Dr. Woolsey, for
twenty years the Southern Pacific ph3'si
clan, ever appeared in a case against the
company.
IT IS MILLER.
The Mendooino Lone Highwayman Has
Â» Bad Record Here.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Jan. 30. â John
Schneider, the lone Menriocino hiehway
man who shot at ex-Sheriff Hanly of that
county and robbed a stage at Ukiau sev
eral weeks ago, has been identified as
1" rank Miller, a teamster and sailor of this
county. Deputy Sheriff William Lane
went io the I,'kiah Insane Asylum yester
day and after leaving the asylum he went
to the jail to look at Schneider. As soon
as he Siiw the prisoner the recognition was
mutual, and Schneider said: "1 am not
Miller here; I am Schneider."
Miller is the tramp who was tried for
the murder of v dairyman near Biairs
Park nearly two years ago. He was ac
quitted, but there was a general feeling
that he would turn up again, and the pre
sumption has proved to be true.
Oakland Republicans Organize.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 31.â A meeting
of the Second Ward Republicans was held
at Milton Hall to-night, and a Republican
campaign club was organized. The fol
lowing temporary officers were elected :
President, F. R. Porter of Echoes; secre
tary, John H. Bonham. It was the sense
of the meeting that it would be advisable
to organize an Oakland Republican club,
consisting of delegates from'all the ward
clubs. There was a feeling that an effort
should be made to boom Oakland as a suit
able place for the Republican State Con
vention.
Woman's Suffrage.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Jan. 31.â Miss Sarah
Severance of Pacific Grove, the well
known lecturer on woman suffrage, will
give an address to-morrow evening in
Syndicate Hall on Thirteenth street, be
tween Jefferson and Clay.
HISTORY OF A DAY.
Alaineda County Happenings Told In
Short Chapters.
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call, {
908 Broadway, Jan. 31. )
There will be a meetin? of the Teachers'
Annuity Association to-morrow at 10 a. m.
in tne English Lutheran Church, Sixteenth and
Grove streets.
There are now 280 pupils in the Lorln school,
and the various departments are much
crowded. It is proposed to add at once two
more schoolrooms to the buildinj;.
Thomas Carey has Bued the Fairmount, Uni
versity and Ferris-street railway at Berkeley
for $2500 for damages sustained on October
1, 1894, by falling off the front platform of the
company's car on University avenue.
E. W. Riner, a former contractor at Golden
Gate, is looked up at the County Jail to serve a
sentence of fifty days in deiaultof the payment
oi a $100 fine, imposed upon him a few days
ago by Judge Clift, in whose court he was found
guilty of battery.
Luigl Bottoni, T?ho runs a French laundry at
690 Twenty-ninth street, has sued for a divorce
from his wife Angela, who he alleges is too
irisky and fond of the company oi a rapid set.
There is no property at issue and the parties
have no children.
J. H. Harris, J. McKlensek, Martin Bratanic
and Joseph Sheldon, four of the five men ar
rested in the Federated Trades building for
playing "studhorse" poker, forfeited $25
apiece. J. L. Bird, the fifth man, was given
until February 6 to plead.
Jamee Thompson of Alameda, arrested at the
instance of Mrs. Lydia Prescott of the Society
for the Prevention bf Cruelty to Children for
abusing his 12-year-old boy, pleaded guilty
before KecorderSt. Sure to-day, and on promise
to reform in the future and to leave town, sen
tence was suspended.
William C. Moody continues to show a gen
eral improvement, although the appearances
are now that trie injury he sustained will re
sult in a total loss of hearing. There has been
no indication that he will regain the use of his
ears, and the physicians believe an injury of a
permanent character was inflicted.
It is announced that a meeting of the Repub
licans of the Seventh Ward will be held on the
evening of Friday, February 7, in Justice Law
rence's courtroom on East Twelfth street. It ia
proposed to form a campaign club, which will
be the nuoleus during the Presidential elec
tion canvass, and a general attendance is hoped
for.
J. L. Wetmore, the capitalist, believes he is
heir to an estate of $80,000,000 which is now
locked up in the Bank of England, Holland.
It is money which belonged to the Van Cotts of
New York, of whom Mr. Wetmore Is one of the
descendants. He said this afternoon that he
has no doubt the money is there, and thought
his prospect of getting some of it was very fair.
County Jailers Al White and William Lane
are kept on the alert to prevent the friends of
dope fiends in the County Jail from smuggling
in supplies of the drug. It Is frequently se
creted in bread, bologna sausage, tobacco and
other articles brought in to the prisoners. The
jailers in the future propose to prosecute all
persons who are detected in trying to smuggle
opium into jail.
THE ALAMEDA BURGLARS
No Clew Yet Obtained by the
Police as to Their
Identity.
A Pair of Australian Rabbits to Be
Turned Loose Down the
Country.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 31.â The police
have obtained no clew to the perpetrators
of the nine burglaries committed early
Thursday morning. The burglars did
their wholesale work, took all the money
they could find and whatever else they
fancied and disappeared, leaving no trace
that affords the police a pointer. An indi
cation that there were three men con
cerned in the job is afforded in the fact
that at Silberberg'g store three sizes of
white shirts were taken â 14, 14]4 and 15â
and the sraallness of the sizes would seem
to indicate either that the work was that
of youths or of men of small stature. The
particular size s arts were carefully picked
out and other sizes laid aside.
The police say the burglaries must have
been committed between 11:30 and 1:30
o'clock, but the large number of places
entered and the thoroughness with which
the several stores were ransacked would
hardly permit of accomplishment within
that time.
The opinion is also expressed that the
burglars were amateurs. The only justifi
cation for that is that the method of effect
ing entrance was clumsy, and showed a
seeming lack of experience in breaking
open doors and windows. But, ou the
other hand, the adroitness in doing the
vast amount of work under the very nose
of the police would argue that the perpe
trators were experienced hands at the
business. The claim by someof the police
that the burglaries were the work of local
criminals is not justified by anything that
appears on the surface. There was no
feature of the crime that suggests the un
likelihood of out-of-town crooks being
responsible for the work.
The burglary will be made the basis of a
demand for an increase in the police force,
and it may be investigated by the Munici
pal Board as to the complete* failure of the
police to prevent or detect it.
Annual "Water Report.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 31.â The annual
report of the Artesian Water Works was
filed jesterday. This is not an incorpor
ated company, but a private enterprise
owned and operated by R. R. Thompson.
The total amount of money invested in
the plant is now $582,231 10. Of this
$17,330 84 has been invested during the
year. The total receipts of the year were
$60,050 11. Of this $41,993 65 were water
rato collections, $6556 90 for sprinkling
street.*. $950 in rents, $5284 rent of hydrants,
$2325 tapping mains. $2239 25 sewer flush
ing, $69631 miscellaneous. The expenses
were $26,298 63, as follows: Salaries, $11.
--385; taxes, $4802 26; coai, $3742 83; labor,
$2746 10; supplies. $3622 44. The profits
were $33,751 48, from which, the year's
betterment of $17,334 84 being deducted,
leaves a net surplus of $16,416 64. The
rates are to be fixed in February.
Australian Rabbits.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Jan. 31.â Two Aus
tralian rabbits were shipped yesterday by
Mr. Tompkinson of Sar Antonio avenue,
through Wellf, Fargo & Co., to a farm in
San Benito County, where it is expected
they will be bred for the market. They
attracted considerable attention in their
crate as it stood in front of the express
office awaiting shipment. They are larger
than the native jaokrabbit, and interest ceu
tered in them without doubt through a
knowledge of the terrible pest they had

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
STUDENTS ARE ACQUITTED
Justice James Decides That Harry
Rodgers Was Not As
saulted.
THE RULING WILDLY CHEEKED.
A Sensational Scene in the Courtroom.
The Decision Pronounced
Unjust.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 31.â The sensa
tion of the year in Berkeley took place to
day at. the conclusion of the trial of the
four university students charged with bat
tery on Harry Rodgers, a Boone's Acad
emy student. The evidence on both sides
having all been presented the case was left
to Justice James for decision. He at once
dismissed the suit on the ground of insuf
ficient and non-conclusive evidence. No'
sooner had the words left his mouth than
the courtroom, which had been crowded to
the doors the entire day by young colle
gians, was a scene of the wildest hilarity
and exultation over, the decision, which
was to them a practical victory.
Hats were thrown in the air, college
Harry Rodgers, the Academy Student.
yells given and hurrahs for the Judge
poured forth as the excited college men
made their exit from the dingy courtroom.
In less than a minute all of the university
men were out of the building and in the
street.
No sooner had they made their exit,
however, than Judge James was attacked
by Mrs. H. N. Marquand, editor of the
Berkeley Dally Advocate, and Attorney
Graber, who scourged him with their
tongues for baying dismissed the case
without punishing: any of the alleged
offenders. Mrs. Marquand accused the
Judge of upholding a "lot of drunken
loaff rs," to which he made a sharp retort
in defense of himself.
Attorney Graber joined the editress in
her railings against the Justice, and soon
the discussion grew to a white heat.
By this time the students had heard of
what was going on inside the Judge's
sanctum, and they surged in more quickly
than they had previously retired.
"The testimony," said the lady, "went
to prove that tne defendants in the case
were guilty as charged and the decision
should have been rendered accordingly."
In reply to this Judge James said:
"If the testimony was perjured then I
am sorry for the university. The way
things are manaced in Berkeley a man
cannot go according to the dictates of his
own judgment ana at the same time keep
free of criticism. If a man renders a decis
ion to suit the multitude then he is praised
foT it, but when he does not suit them he
is condemned. You do not like this deci
sion, but if you will reflect a little you
will remember that you wrote an editorial
on a liquor-case decision that did suit not
you."
At this the crowd set up another yell,
and left ' the building with a "Hurrah for
the Judjie!"
Over 300 university students were in
Justice James' courtroom when the cases
were called. The three "John Doe" war
rants sworn to by Rodgers were found to
be against H. S. Avery, Cecil Chamber
lain and William Smitli. Lawrence Haven
was the other student charged.
The case of Haven was tried without a
jury, Attorney Seth Mann appearing for
the defendant and Deputy District Attor
ney Church and Mr. Graber for the prose
cution.
Rodgers, the complaining witness, told
on the stand the same story as had already
been published. He declared that Haven
and his companions were all intoxicated
on the night of the alleged assault, and
that they attacked him without provoca
tion, Haven charging him with insulting a
young lady on the train.
Rodgers 1 story was contradicted by
Night Watchman Parker and by each of
the four defendants, and Professor Hayne
and several other witnesses, who had
seen Haven and his companions on the
night in question, testified that none of
them were under the influence of liquor.
Something of a sensation was caused by
tne appearance in court of the young lady
who was said to have been insulted by
Rodgers. She was Miss Maggie Horrigon
of Golden Gate, and she testified that the
conduct of Rodgers was not ungentle
manly and did not attract her attention to
him. Other passengers on the car gave
similar testimony.
The case was submitted without argu
ment.
Before announcing Mb decision Justice
James said he desired to state that the
charge of drunkenness had been entirely
disproved. "Such a charge might, If left
unrefuted, work injury to the future rep
utation of these young gentlemen," said
he. "and I wilJ therefore state before de
ciding the case that the evidence adduced
shows unmistakably that none of them
were intoxicated."
At this point Attorney Graber, for
Rodgers, asked that a similar announce
ment be made with regard to the charge
that Rodgers had behaved in an ungentle
manly manner on the train. He called
the attention of the court to the fact that
four witnesses had denied that Rodgers
had insulted the lady, one of tham being
the young lady herself, while only one
witness bad declared that insult had been
offered.
: ; Justice James â  refused to make the de
sired announcement, \ however, and pro
ceeded to announce his decision acquitting
the 'â 'â  defendant, -'Hay ne. The \< charges
against Chamberlain, Avery and Smith
rested upon the . same testimony .; as that
against | Hay ne,"T and the I defendants were
therefore all discharged. -
COLLEGE elections.
Exciting \ Contests of the Senior and
FrenhnianQlagÃeÃ; Yesterday.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 31.â One of the
most exciting class elections ever held at
the university was that of the seniors yes
terday afternoon. The meeting took place
in the lecture-room of â¢ Professor Joseph
Le Conte, who gave up entire possession
for. the time being. All day 'long.the sup-
Dorters of the \ various ; ; candidates : were
hustling I about, "cutting" recitations ;in
order to "do politics." Whenever two or
three '96 men could be. seen together about
the campus some passer-by would call out,
"Has the political pot boiled over yet ?" or
"What's the premium on straight tickets?"
When the day began there were four can
didates in the field, H. C. Wyckoff, J. D.
Gish, P. L. Bush and j. O'Connor, but by
noon the two latter let it be known that
they were out of the race.
The reason that such attention has been
paid to the office is the prominence that the
senior presidency has attained, for this
officer has the appointment of the com
mittees which manage the senior class day
exercises and the senior ball to be eiven in
the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art in San
Francisco, so that the office is considered
the highest cla3S honor in college.
After G. M. Fisher, president pro tern,
had called the class to order and some pre
liminary business had been dispensed with,
nominations were called for. M. C. Flaherty
placed WyckoS in nomination, and R. W.
Wheeler presented the name of Gish.
When the ballots were counted it was
found that Wyckoff received 56 and Gish
39. The otdef officers elected were:
First vice-president, 8. E. Coleman; sec
ond vice-president, Miss Maud Hansche;
third vice-president, H. L. Alexander; sec
retary, F. G. Rqdelfinger; treasurer, H. B.
Graham; historian, Theodore Laguna; ser
geant-at-arms, Power Hutchins; directors
â W. N. Friend, Louis Merwin and A. VV.
North. None of the board of directors
entered college with '96.
Blue and Gold Manager Bush presented
his final report, whicn Bhowed the total
receipts to be $2417 20 and the total ex
penditure $2450 65, leaving a deficit of
$33 45. A committee, consisting of Bord
well, Symonds, Howell, Miss Bennett and
Miss Huussy, was appointed to audit the
accounts. A motion was carried appro
priating $5 for the silver cup, which is the
trophy to be played for by the class base
ball teams.
At the election of the freshman class
yesterday afternoon James Ely was chosen
Bourdon president; Miss Abrams, vice
president; Miss Lawrence, secretary; J.
Luben, treasurer; T. D.mglas, sergeant-at
arms; executive committee â Lloyd, Elston,
Wood, Raven and Pache.
Nominations for football manager will
be made Wednesday next and the election
will come off the following Monday. F. P.
Taylor and G. F. Reinhardt, both of '97,
are the aspirants for the place. Each is
working his pull for all it is worth.
Regents J. West Martin, Charles F.
Crocffer, Timothy Guy Phelps and James
F. Houghton were at the university yes
terday looking over the plane and specifi
tions submitted for the Affiliated Colleges
buildings, as that was the final day set for
submitting plans. Those who sent in
plans are: McDougal & Sons, Albert Sut
ton, William Gurlett, Mr. Pelton and J.
Kroffts, with Martin & Coffee. These
plans will be hung for Inspection in the
regents' room at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art.

The Old Tar Could Not Read.
A pretty story comes from across the
water of an old tar's tact and chivalry,
which shows that the heart of a gentleman
may beat under the oilskin coat of a rough,
illiterate sailor.
A sea captain, engaged to marryacer
ain lady, sent a message to her by the
hand of one of his crew. The sailor, hav
ing delivered the letter, stood gazing in
silent admiration on the face of the lady,
for she was very beautiful.
"Well, my good man," said she, "for
what do you wait? There is no answer."
"Lady," the sailor replied, with humble
deference, "I would like to know your
name."
"Did you not see it on the letter?"
"Pardon, lady ; I never learnt to read.
Mine bus been a hard, rough life. 1 '
"And for what reason, my good man,
would you know my nameY"
"Because," answered the old tar, with
gentle and manly courtesy, "in a storm at
sea, with danger of death afore me, I
would like to recall the name of the bright
est thins I'd ever seen in life. There'd be
sunshine in it, even In the thick dark
ness."âPhiladelphia Ledger.
KNAPPE LOSES HIS JOB
He Shared Honors With Lady
Sholto's Mother-in-
Law.
WAS A SPECIAL PETECTIVE.
Chief Lloyd Drops a Strong Hint as
to Why Knappe Works for
Him No More.
Oakland Office San Fhancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 31. j
Special Detective Knappe, who haÃ been
the means of securing much evidence
against liqnor-dealers, has been turned
down by Chief of Police Lloyd, and he is
telling everybody that his resignation was
demanded because the friends of the
liquor men had been at work on the Chief.
"I don't know why I have been
dropped," said Knappe to-day, "but it is
very evident that somebody has been tell
ing the Chief of Police some stories de
rogatory to me and he has believed them.
I do not know what I am charged with,
but the .Chief has tola me he wished me to
withdraw, and I have been dropped. I
did not have a regular appointment, but
was employed right along, and have se
cured convictions in many cases. I have
only lost one case in which I was en
gaged, and that was tne Hyman caae. I
was engaged mostly to go into places that
had no license and procure a drink. I
have handled over a score of cases and do
not know why I should be let out now."
Knappe has been a witness in the Police
Court in liquor cases nearly every day for
months. He is one of the most familiar
figures at the City Hall. One of his most
celebrated cases was that against Jules
Debret, who keeps "The House of Mys
tery" iust across Eighth-street bridge. On^
that occasion his companion was no less a
distinguished person than Mrs. Addis-
Mooney, the mother of Lady Sholto Doug
las. A conviction was secured, as the evi
dence was considered unusually conclu
sive. There are about a half dozen cases
now pending in which Knappe is a wit
ness, and the defense will doubtless make
the most of the fact that Knappe is now
non perÃona grata to the Chief.
Chief Lloyd was asked about the matter
to-day and said: "I have never asked
Knappe to resign because he has nothing
to resign from. He was onJy engaged from
time to time and did some good work. I
have not employed him lately because I do
not think it best to do so. The idea that
the liquor men have had him called off, so
to speak, is too absurd to refer to, for if I
have not employed Knappe I iiave em
ployed some one whom I considered more
capable for that particular job. You
know there is such a thing as a man doing
more than he is authorized to do. I have
not employed Knappe for some time, but I
have had good reason for not doing so."
The arrests for violating the liquor ordi
nances are as numerous as they nave ever
been so the hint that the liquor men in
fluenced the Chief is not borne out by the
records.

OLD SOLDIERS INDIGNANT
If They Die in the Home Medical
Students May Dissect
Them.
One Paragraph in the Annual Report
Creates Resentment in Hundreds
of Noble Breasts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 31. j
Several members of the Grand Army
hove received communications from the
Soldiers' Home at Yountville expressing
great indignation at the treatment to
which the bodies of soldiers who die in the
institution are subject. The feeline was
aroused by a paragraph in the last annual
report of the home, and it has been in
creased by recent developments.
Following is a copy of a letter received
to-day by a G. A. R. official in this city :
Veteraks' Home, Yocntville, Jan. 31.
Much indignation exists here about the
bodies of old soldiers, members of the home,
being mutilated ana dismembered for the ben
efit of doctors and medical students.
In his last annual report, dated June 30,
1895, Dr. \V. F. McAllister says: "Sixteen
autopsies have been held during the year, and
from this date on autopsies will be held and a
history of each case will be carefully recorded
of all who die at the home."
This report was accepted, approved and
printed by the directors, who have lately, to
facilitate this and other matters, appointed
three other doctors â a visiting physician, an
enr, eye and throat specialist, and a young as
sistant surgeon. Some of the old vets have
left and others will leave on account of this
unlawful and outrageous treatment of our
dead. The attention of relatives, the Grand
Army â who founded this home, the people who
support it with their taxes, and the law offi
cers of the Government is called to this degra
dation of the bodies of the heroes who fought
to save our nation.
"Of course, it will be said that this is
simply another growl from old soldiers,"
said the recipient of the letter this after
noon, "but it seems to me that such con
duct is unjust and indecent. The matter
will at once be taken up by the Grand
Army all over the State, and I think we
can have the present custom done away
with. When an old soldier is on h's death
bed it is not a pleasant thought that he
will soon be turned over to a lot of medical
students, who may bury him eventually
or may clean and preserve his skeleton for
an object lesson.
"We understand that only the Coroner
can order an autopsy, and we. believe the
doctors have no right to deal in the manner
they do with the dead bodies of old
soldiers. Autopsies need to be only occa
sional, but now they are held in the case
of every one who dies, and we will try to
have this thing stopped. Several old "sol
diers have left the home rather than re
main with the certainty that they will be
dissected before they are cold. When
these facts become known there will be a
howl of indignation from all over the
State."
Ore Company's Trouble*.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 31.â The cred

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 31. j
An original go-as-you-please fat man's
race ended at San Jose this afternoon.
The contestants were Otto Streit, A. B.
Swanson and J. Heney, known as "Fat
Jack." All are Oakland restauranteurs and
'all weigh between 180 and 220 pounds.
The affair was the result of an argu
ment between the three men as to their
ability to cover the distance between Oak
land and San Jose in remarkable time
under the present conditions of the road.
The details were arranged last night and
the men started at 10 o'clock this morning
from Streit's place on Thirteenth street.

was backed by G. Broderick for $100;
Streit entered at 200 pounds and was
backed by Al Stevinson ; and Heney, who
weighed 220 pounds, was backed by
Rube Seebeck. The men left Oakland
at 1 o'clock this morning on an
electric-car that turned in at Elm
hurst. From there it- was go as you
please through the mud to San Jose, a
distance of forty-live miles. From the re
sult it was seen that they kept within
hailing distance all the way, and arrived
at San Jose this afternoon in the follow
ing order: Otto Streit, 1:35 o'clock; Swan
son, 1:42, and Heney 1:48. The men
returned to Oakland to-night by team.
TO HELP THE FRUIT MEN
The State Development Com
mittee Advances a New
Project.
Fruit-Growers Urged to Assist in
Sending Lecturers Through
out the East.
The marketing of fruits was the main I
subject discussed yesterday at the meeting j
of the executive committee of the State j
Development Comrcittee. It was reported j
that the map of California which is to be â¢
used as an advertising medium will be |
ready for publication in ten days. Solici
tors also reported success in securing $1
subscriptions from the businessmen of the j
City.
D. M. Carman reported that there was !
much enthusiasm over the work of the j
committee in Alameda County. Mr. Fish, â¢
president of the Merchants' Exchange of I
Oakland, thought Alameda County should j
have more than five members on the com- !
mittee. The number was increased to I
nine, and G. W. Arper, Oakland, F. W. J
Van Sickles and J. A. Rimnel of Alameda,
and F. K. Shattuck of Berkeley were ap
pointed by the chair.
W. M. Bunker raised the question of the
creation of fruit markets. He said that
farmers were being invited to California
and that nothing should be spared to open
up every channel through which their
products coula rind a sale. Both Mr. Rich
and Mr. Carman coincided with him. It
was decided to send the following letter
to the fruit growers and shippers of the
State to induce them to assist in the intro
duction of California fruits in Eastern
markets and the stimulation of trade:
As you are a shipper of deciduous fruits you
will fee interested in the following:
As a result of the work done by this com
mittee through its representatives at the At
lanta Exposition and elsewhere in the East
we are convinced that a greatly increased de
mand for California products may be created
through methods that are no longer expert- ;
ments. We belisve this can be done without'
disturbing in any way the existing methods of I
selling or distributing. But to accomplish
this nntted effort is necessary.
The committee will soon place stereopticon
lectures and cooking exhibitions in the East
ern field for the purpose of creating a general
interest in California. It also proposes to es
tablish a general California headquarters in
Chicago as a center for Eastern work.
Wo have the following propositions to make
the shippers of California products:
FirstâWe will have thoroughly posted and
competent men give the lectures and cooking
exhibits and canvass the grocery and other
trades in each city or town and (a) talk Cali
fornia products; (&) ascertain if they are being
sold, and if not report the. name and address
to this committee, which in turn will by circu
lar letter furnish them to every interested con
tributor; (c) distribute such printed matter
as may be furnished advertising California
products in general and specialties in particu
lar; (d) where practicable arrange for a jar or
box ot California fruit to be placed in a con
spicuous window, with a card calling atten
tion to the same and referring all interested in
the State or its products to this committee;
and, lastly (c), take orders for specialties that
are not being sold in the regular trade.
Secondâ We will have your printed matter
carefully distributed under your general di
rections, and have samples of your goods
shown if you are offering any specialties.
Provided you will contribute toward the sup
port of thin committee.
As we propose to make each department of
our work self-sustaining and to attempt only
such work as we have means tocarry out, and as
no member of the committee receives a salary,
you can depend upon every dollar contributed
going directly into the special work .for which
it is given.
Please fill out the inclosed blank, being as
liberal in the amount as possible, remember
ing that the more we receive the larger will bt
the work.
Make any suggestions or modifications that
may occur to you.
W e reserve the right to decline any contribu
tions that are entirely out of proportion to the
work required, but will agree to give lull vaiue
for all moneys received.

FLASHLIGHT PHOTOGEAPHY.
Recent Developments in the Art in New
Directions.
Naturalists have been doing some clever
things by the aid of photography. A
Western sportsman has been for years
making a collection of photographs of all
kinds of wild animals in their native
haunts, and many of these pictures, espe
cially of animals about to spring at their
intended prey, have been taken under con
ditions that made the skiliful handling of
the rifle highly necessary the instant after
the camera was snapped. Another enthu
siast has devoted himself in photographing
the animajs of the forest in their nightly
wanderings. He would set a wire in the
paih of the animal he wished to photo
graph, and adjust the camera so that as
the animal came along and made contact
with the wire blitz-pulver was ignited, and
in the flash the picture was taken.
In this way some beautiful specimens of
deer in all sorts of attitudes, of mountain
lions, badgers, opossums, etc., have been
secured, and many new features have
been developed of great interest to the
naturalist. If. Bontan, the European
naturalist, who studies the wild life ol the
Mediterranean in the garb of a diver, has
succeeded in taking some photographs of
the sea bottom. He uses a flashlight ob
tained from a spirit lamp and magnesium
powder, which is covered by a water-tight
bell jar. The lamp stands on a barrel
containing oxygen gas, which he employs
to work the lamp and the pneumatic shut
ter of the camera. He breathes through
the supply pipe of the diving dress. The
camera is water-tight and stands on a
tripod ne&r the barrel, so that the shutter
and the flashlight can be worked to
gether. â American Journal of Pho
tography.

I Lateral-imp. Ko, al Title |
won a maiden five-furlong dash, and right
here his racing career is possibly at an end.
Some weeks ago he was beaten but a nose
by Logan in a mile dash covered in I:4OVÂ£.
Since then he has appeared a couple of
times, but performed very indifferently in
the heavy going. The company he started
in yesterday was below mediocrity, with
one exception, the Burns & Waterhouse
entry Joe' Terry. In the betting it was 7
to 5* and take your pick about the two
horses mentioned. Donnelly on Joe Terry
pulled his mount up when the flag fell,
and Yo El Rey won handily from Ver
dette. On returning to the winners' circle
in front of the judges 7 stand it was discov
ered that the big sprinter bad been badly
cut down, the lendon of the nigh hind leg
being completely severed. The veterinary
who treated him held out hopes that he
will ultimately be able to race again, but
Trainer "Butch" Fisher, who has labored
so long and patiently to get the half
brother to El Rio Rey over his suiking pro
clivities with such pronounced success,
was much cast down over the accident.
The track was in much better condition
than for some days, still there were the
usual number of surprises and upsets.
Favorites and outsiders broke even, three
of each taking purses.
Sturter Ferguson figured in an exciting
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
incident that was not down on the pro
gramme and might have been attended
with serious results for the Kentucky flag
w-ielder. The second race, a seven and a
j half furlong run, was carded to be run
I over the inside course, which is very
! narrow. The ten start.rs gave Ferguson a
deal of trouble, and he finally got down
from the starter's box on to the track. In
a false breakaway he was bumpeu by May
Day ana thrown under the l)orse'3 feet.
Fortunately May Day is not a fractious
horse, and after testine the starter's ribs
backed away, and barring a partial dis
arrangement of his toilet and some Cali
fornia dust Mr. Ferguson was none tbe
worse for wear, and again mounted to his
rostrum.
May Day, the horse mentioned in con
i nection with the episode at the post,
proved a winner, taking the race in a drive
from the '3]4 to 1 favorite, Hy Dy.
The two first choices fared very badly in
the short six furlong handicap. George
Miller went to the post 3to 2, with old
Logan in great demand at 2 and 2J^ to 1.
When the flag fell Mainstay, Red Bird
and Kamsin went out in front. At the
end of a quarter Red Bird fell out of it.
\V hen the stretch was reached Lucky Dog,
Kamsin and Mainstay were about on
equal terms. Lucky DO2 gradually forged
to the front a.nd passed the wire a scant
two lengths ahead of Mainstay, with Karri
sin a good third. The winner was 5^ to 1
in the betting and Mainstay 25 to 1.
For the mile selling event Red Glen was
backed down from 6 to 5 to 4to 5, and
after running under wraps to the stretch,
came on and won easily, with Braw Scot
in the place. Sea Spray, who cut out the
running, finished third.
Carroll's mare, Levana C, was a warm 6
to 5 chance for the fifth race, a six-furlong
spin, but failed to get a mark. The second
choice, Meadow Lark, looked a winner up
to the last few jumps, wheu Cborn on
ZooJsin came with a rush arÂ«d snatched
the purse by a head. The books had bid
12 to 1 against the winner.
The day's racing was concluded by a
five-furlong dash for horses that ought to
be pulling streetcars. Nine staved. and $9
would probably buy anyone of them. Two
owners had a "cut away," and the two
good things finished one, two. Little
Pete, the 8 to 5 favorite, finished in front
of the plunged or second cnoice, Rapido.
Track and Paddock Items.
Starter Ferguson blamed Donnelly for
pulling Joe Terry up. while Trainer
Jimmy McCormick thought the starter as
much at fault as the jockey. The judges
decided to restrict Donnelly to riding for
the Burns & Waterhouse staole alone for
the next thirty days.
> Lucky Dog's imposing win caused no
little comment, but it is said the stable let
him run unbacked.
Young Garner, who rode Hazel D in tht
opening race, admitted that it was his
j mount that cut Yo El R?y down, but that
it was entirely unavoidable.
If the en try" of Pescador is rejected then
so should that of Gussie, for she is a much
more vicious animal at the post. Flynn, who
rode May -Day, dismounted once while the
field was at the post in the second event
to ".void taking a chance of being kicked
fc>y the Hyder AH mare, as she backed up
dangerously close to him. She is an adept
at the art of kicking.
Verde tte was backed down from 30 to 10
to lin the betting on the first race. But
for the gameness of Yo El Roy in staying
to the end after being cut down the coin
would have oeen his.
Frank Coady is falling in for many fa
vorable comments by his fine riding of
late. Lucky Dog and Red Glen were both
ridden by him yesterday. His ride on
Lucky Dog was a particularly good one.
Red Glen is fast regaining his Western
form, when he was considered about the
most shifty selling-plater around Chi
cago. Coady had hard work* to prevent
him from running out from under him in
the race yesterday.
It seemed to be the prevailing opinion
around the track that Logan did not show
at his best in the handicap. Possibly the
iron horse is getting a bit rusty.
It must be that Unity does not like
heavy going, or el?e he is a very unreliable
horse. On his past showing it looks as
tnough he should have been closer np in
yesterday's race.
Zoolein was up on edge for sure yester
day. Some of the wise ones got aboard at
odds of 30 to 1.
Tho Campaign of Friedland.
The campaign of Fried land shows either !
less genius or more than any other of Na
poleon's victories, according to the stand
point from which it is judged. If he is to j
be regarded throughout its dura- j
tion merely as a general then his
conduct shows comparatively little
ability. He came on his enemy where
he did not expect a battle; although he
had ample time to evolve and execute an
admirable plan, and his loss was trifling
compared with that of his opponents, yet,
nevertheless, Fried land was a common
place, incomplete affair. It compelled the
foe to abandon Heilsberg, but it did not
annihilate him or necessarily end the war.

WOODS OFFERED
TO SURRENDER.
The Police, However, Had
No Evidence Against
the Man.
MR. PARKER'S CHARGES.
Denial by the Girl's Brother That
He Spoke So Openly as
Woods Alleged.
BELIEF IN A SUICIDE THEORY.
Relatives Declare That They No Longer
Think the Young Woman Was
Murdered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 30, 1896. f
John F. Woods, whose story regarding
the missing Annie Parker was published
in this morninc's Call, went to the police
station this forenoon and offered to sur
render himself if any arrest were contem
plated. He was told that he was not
wanted and he tnen went aray. He did
not return to his unique collection of cab
ins all day.
Woods had previously gone to William
Moller and told him of his troubles. Mr.
Moller is a trustee of the First English
Lutheran Church, of which Woods is a
member. Mr. Moller advised him to go to
the police station and offer to give himself
up, and then they went there together.
"I know Woods quite well," said Mr.
Moller. "He drinks some and I expect he
lias been on a spree, but he has always
borne a good name. I think the family
should have gone to the officers the first
thing and asked for help. The papers
would be a great help in locating her and
no doubt will eventually find her."
Although there are many circumstances
that seem to connect Woods with the miss
ing girl, the detectives are almost satisfied
that he does not know any more about her
than is known to her own family.
A great part of his excitement is due to
the suspicion that he thinks hangs over
him, although the girl's brother said to-
THE HOME OF JOHN F. WOODS AT THE EASTERN SIDE OF LAKE MERRITT.
[From a sketch made for "The Call."]
day that he does not now believe that
Woods had anything to do with Miss
Parker's disappearance.
Woods' nearest neighbor saia this morn
ing: "Mt. Woods is a very quiet man and
kind and open-hearted, but he will drink.
Whenever he has been drinking he breaks
down and is very wretched. We have
noticed him about this week and could see
he had been drinking. He did not act any
different, however, than ne did at other
such times. He often goes away leaving
the place open. He talked freely about his
troubles and seemed to worry over them.
He keeps liquor in the house.
"At no time have we ever seen a woman
at his house, and from what I know of
him, I believe he is as anxious to find Miss
Parker as is her brother."
Woods showed p. reporter a letter from
bis wife that helps Co explain his present
position. In her letter his wife refers to
the drinking habit that has overpowered
him and rendered him incapable of acting
the part of a high-principled man. Mrs.
Woods is at present with her relatives in
Maryland, and she tells how she revisited
the old church and stood before the altar
at which they were married many years
ago.
All through the letter there ia evidence
of a very refined nature. There is not a
mention of Miss Parker in the wnole let
ter.
The family is certain that the woman

reported as acting in a strange manner in
Alameda is not Miss Parker, although At
torney Holland is of the opinion that it is.
The portrait published in to-day's Call
was taken about seven years ago, and was
obtained from an intimate friend, who is
anxious to help find Miss Parker.
"We have concluded that it is time for
all publicity to cease," said Mr. Parker to
night. "We cannot overlook the fact that
Annie left her watch, rings, purse and
bankbook on her bureau when she went
out for the last time, and this seems to
point to a premeditated act on her part.
Although I went to Woods' house very late
the nignt of Annie's disappearance, I did
not, I am sure, charge him with all that
he says I did. I knew he was very well
acquainted with my sister, and I went to
his place as I did to many others."
It transpired to-day that no one had
charged Woods with knowing about Miss
Parker's disappearance, and he went to
several of her friends and expressed his
deep sorrow that she bad gone. It was
his apparently unbounded grief that
helped to create suspicion.
A communication was handed in at The
Call office to-night for publication. The
remarks to which Rev. C. H. Hobart re
fers were made in an interview with J. F.
Woods, who, when he made them, was |
personally convinced that he was held re
sponsible for Miss Parker's disappearance.
It is well known that everything contained
in the note regarding the Parkers is abso
lutely true, buc it is only fair to Woods to
quote his exact language. The letter is as
follows:
Oakland, Cal., Jan 31.
To f/le Editor of the Callâ Dear Sib: We ob
serve in an article in yonr issue of the 31st
some remarks which seriously reflect upon the
Parker family, now in deep trouble. We desire
to say that we have been acquainted with this
family for many years and know that such at
tack upon their good name Is both unjust and
untrue.
No family in our congregation is worthier of
the entire confidence of their fellow-men than
this, and none holds the confidence of our
congregation more thoroughly than do they.
We make this statement as due from us to a
family whose unspeakable sorrow and trouble
should have protected them from such assault
upon their good name.
C. H. Hobart, pastor; John H. Stevens, J. C.
Caldwell, J. K. Bradway, members of the First
Baptist Church.
The belief that Miss Parker committed
suicide is increasing. One police theory is
that the girl is in San Francisco or some
where else in this vicinity, staying away
on account of some real or fancied un
pleasantness at home. That a prolonged
stay away from home was not intended
is indicated, however, by the circumstance
that the young woman took little clothing
and no other personal effects: Detective
Holland was engaged on the case all day.

or 24. "Just after the arrival of the first
train from San Francisco, which arrived at
San Rafael 8:45, she came into my shop
and was a little nervous. I noticed particu
larly that she hesitated in speaking. I
came from behind the counter and asked
her what she wished.
"She then aaked in a trembling voice,
'Do you want to buy a watch? I am a
little short of fivnds.' She took from her
pocket or waist a lady's small watch, gold,
l and as near as I can remember, it had at-
tached a small chain some four or five
inches long, with a small ball on the end.
I would have bought the watch, but I
thought it was a cheap one. I told her I
had no time to deal in watches, and could
not help her any.
"She went out, went down Fourth street,
toward the center of the town. That was
the last I saw or heard of her. I thought
nothing more of it until I saw Miss Par
ker's description in the San Francisco
Call. Then it flashed into my mind that
the young lady who was in my shop might
have been Miss Parker. I could not be
positive, but am almost sure, from the pho
tograph and description, that it was the
same young lady which they are looking
for.
"She had on, when I saw her, a gray
cloak coming to her knees, and I think a
small felt hat. I heard she was afterward
seen coming from the broad-gauge depot at
noon." Smith is the man who wrote the
letter that appeared in yesterday's paper.
IGNORED THE COMMITTEE.
Baseball Flayers Are Suspended, but
Stay Away From the Meeting;.
The committee of judges who met lust
night at the Olympic Club to decide the
questions involving amateurs and pro
fessionals in athletic sports decided to
create a large vacancy in the baseball club
of the Pacific Athletic Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union. It was accom
plished by declaring J. Coonev, C. A.
Kann, H. Walter, R. Becket. F. Monohan,
H. Krug, W. Grumwoll and J. Cosgrove,
professional baseball players and dismiss
ing them from the association. J. Sheehan
was suspended indefinitely.
The committee consists of John Elliott,
W. F. Humphrey and W. Berry. They
had previously sent out notices to all of
the suspended men ordering them to ap
pear before the august body and hear their
fate, but the ball-tossers did the unique
thing of staying decidedly away, and not
a single man appeared to hear the ulti
matum.
In a few words they gave the committee
what is known to the sporting world as the
"glassy eye" and the "marble heart."
The judges go to Oakland to-night to
bold a mutilating session at the Reli
ance Club, where they will go into the foot
ball question on the same basis. They
propose to uphold the dignity of amateur
ishness, even if they are the only people
who are annoyed by it.
In the meantime the Oriel Baseball Club
of the Olympics will play together for the
year 1896.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1896.
VETOED BY THE MAYOR.
He Refuses to Sanction the
Folsom-Street Appro
priation.
EFFORTS OF PROPERTY-OWNERS.
Sutro Says the Supervisors Had No
Right to Use Money for That
Purpose.
Mayor Sutro has vetoed the ordinance
of the Board of Supervisors appropriating
$35,000 to be used in transforming Folsom
street into a boulevard by bituminizing
the thoroughfare from the bay to Nine
teenth street.
Thus-, after pleading their cause for
years, and importuning the board dozens
of times, the efforts of the property -owners
to get an outlet into the Mission for the
district south of Market street, has come
to naught, unless the board passes the
ordinance over the Mayor's veto, as the
men who are most interested in the matter
hope and believe it will.
For several years the efforts of the
citizens who desired to drive, but were
prevented by the miserable condition of
the streets running parallel to Market
street, were of no avail. In spite of their
arguments that the south side was being
neglected while north side stieets were
being improved at a great expense, and
that the value of property on Mission,
Howard, Folsom, Harrison and other
streets was depreciating because of the
bad conditions of the streets, the Super
visors refused to act, claiming that there
was no money to be used for Buch a pur
pose, and that Folsom street would have
to stand the worn out basalt pavement
until the Street Department funds had
accumulated to a sufficient extent to
warrant advertising for bids.
Finally the property-owners prepared a
monster petition, to which were signed the
names of a majority of the landholders on
Folsom and adjacent streets, demanding
that some steps be taken to place the
street in serviceable condition by putting
down a bituminous pavement. The peti
tioners declared that it would be an entire
waste of money to repair the present pave
ment, as it had been down in some dis
tricts thirty years or more, was worn out,
almost dangerous, and must eventually be
replaced by more modern material.
Under the pressure of these representa
tions, the Street Committee, after looking
carefully into the funds in the Street De
partment allotments, decided that $35,000
could be spared to be applied to this pur
pose. As this was not nearly sufficient to
finish the work, it was decided to spend
that amount, beginning at the bay, make
it go as far as it would and appropriate
more for the completion of the work as it
became available.
An o~dinance making the appropriation
and instructing the Superintendent of
Streets to advertise for bids was accord
ingly drawn up and passed by the board
without a dissenting voice. This is the
measure which the Mayor has refused to
sign.
The specifications as prepared by the
Street Department were mainly as follows :
The roadway to be excavated to a depth of
eight and a half (BJ^) inches below the sur
face when finished; al decomposed matter
| and debris removed, so that the surface shall
be formed of good, clean material.
The roadbed to be brought to a true arc,
with a rise of one (1) inch in three (3) feet
I from the center of the gutter-way to the center
I of the roadway and thoroughly tamped. On
this will be laid a concrete foundation of not
less than six (6) inches in depth, which con
crete foundation shall be composed of one (1)
part of Portland cement, two (2) parts of
good, clean sand and seven (7) parts of clean
rock of the best quality, well mixed and prop
erly laid.
The rock must be either blue or gray sand
stone, or red rock of an approved quality, but
either kind must be clean, hard and durable,
j free from clay or dirt, not subject to disintegra
i tion by the action of air or water, and tree
I from seams or marked lines of cleavage. This
rock shall be crushed or broken to an average
size not exceeding two (2) inches in any direc
tion.
All the rock shall be hard rock of igneous
character, and shall be such rock only as shall
not lose by erosion and fracture more than
25 t>er cent of its original weight upon testing
the same by whac is known as the Rattler test,
the said test of rock to be made in the Rattler
machine belonging to this City and County, by
placing the said i-ock in said machine and the
same put in revolving motion at the rate of
not less than twenty-eight revolutions per
minute for three consecutive hours. All rock
losing more than 25 per cent of Its original
weight shall be rejected as unfit for use.
The cement used shall be of the best quality,
and the quantity for each block or crossing to
be hauled to the location of the work in the
original packages.
Upon the foundation of concrete shall be
constructed a layer of bituminous rock; said
i layer to be two and one-half (1%) inches in
I thickness after rolling, and to be preparea and
superlaid in the following manner:
The bituminous rock used shall be of the
best quality, and shall contain not less than
twelve (12) per cent, nor more than fifteen (15)
j per cent of bitumen. The bitumen contained
! in the material shall be such that none of it
will vaporize below a temperature of 250 de
â¢rrees Fahrenheit, and of such a quality as to
make a good cement.
The bituminous rock must also be free from
all coarse sand and pebbles, and free from clay
and vegetable matter. In reducing the rock
preparatory to laving, it shall not be done in
open kettles, or by any other process liable to
burn or destroy the oil or bitumen in the rock.
Mayor Sutro's reasons for refusing to
approve the ordinance were given in a
very few words.
"In the present state of the City
finances," he said, "I cannot approve the
taking of such a large amount of money
from the City treasury when there ie such
a crying need of funds to keep business
streets in repair.
"It would make a deficiency iv the
Street Department funds at the end of the
fiscal year, and, besides, the Supervisors
have no right to appropriate money for
such a purpose out of a fund intended ex
pressly to keep accepted streets in repair,
especially as it is proposed to improve one
section of the City at the expense of oth
ers. For these reasons I have returned
the ordinance without my signature."
A Policeman Arrested.
A charge of battery was placed against
Policeman O'Conner yesterday on a complaint
sworn to by John Schumanitti, a scavenger.
Several dayÃ ago the latter was driving alone:
the street with a leaky wagon, when he was
stopped by O'Conner. Schumanitti claims
that he was jerked from the wagon with such
force as to break his arm.
A "BOND" SCHEME.
It Has All the Signs of a New Lottery
Proposition.
There is a gorgeously gilded office in the
Academy of Sciences building where Donds
are sold on the lottery plan. There are
Red Cross bonds and bonds of the White
Cross. The denominational range is wide
and the prospect of winning is thus her
alded. "When the Prince of Monaco takes
it into his head to redeem bonds he re
deems them, but he only redeems certain
numbers of all the bonds sold. Now the
lucky holders of the luckily redeemed
bonds get all the money received from
all the bonds sold. Of course, the prince
holds out his commission, but the rest
goes to the lucky.
Supervisor Hobbs obtained possession of
quite a quantity of these bonds and placed
tnem in the hands of District Attorney
Barnes. The attorney admires the beauty
of the bonds. Tne style of the engraving
gains his commendation, but he is looking
up the law to prevent thsir further negoti
ation m the San Francisco market. Should
the law be clear on the subject an ordi
nance may be drawn for the Supervisors
to consider.
Refused His Approval.
The ordinance recently passed establishing
locations for a number of police stations in
different parts of the City was returned to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday without Mayor
Sutro's signature. It is believed that the

cause it contained a location for a station
house on Polk and Washington streets, the
ordinance for which he recently vetoed.
COVERED BY STAGE NOW
The Gap in the Southern Pacific's
Coast Line Is Short
ened.
Stages Will Run To-Day Between
Santa Barbara and the New
Terminal at Someo.
The Southern Pacific Company's coast
division railway has been extended to So
meo, a small place in Santa Barbara
County, eleven miles below Guadalupe, the
last terminus. This new stretch of track
ia not destined to lie idle, for this morning
regular trains, both passenger and freieht,
will be run over it, and from to-day the
new southern terminal of the coast railway
will be Someo, until another section of the
track shall have been completed further
south.
Now that the "gap" between Santa Bar
bara and the southern end of the road has
been shortened sufficiently to make a
through trip from Los Angeles by the
coast route possible without any degree of
discomfort a stage line will be. put in oper
ation. Beginning to-day the stages will
make regular trips between Santa Barbara
and Someo, connecting with trains at both
terminals. The route lies tnrough pictur
esque mountains, and affords the novelty
of a California stage ride, which, it is
thought, will be taken advantage of by
many Eastern tourists.
The first stage from Santa Barbara will
leave this morning. The day will be
spent in a pleasant drive to Lompoc,
where the travelers will rest over night.
Starting early from Lompoc the stage will
reach Someo after half a day's run and
connect with the train coming northward
to Monterey and San Francisco.
An Eastern excursion train of four
sleeping-cars, a composite car, a diner and
a baggage-car, with 100 passengers, passed
through El Paso yesterday and is to arrive
in Southern California to-morrow. The
excursionists will separate at Colton and
scatter throughout California, many of
them availing themselves of the "new
through route via Santa Barbara, Monte
rey and the Santa Clara Valley to San
Francisco. Railroad men say they look
forward to a large increase in tourist travel
to this City by this route, which is certain
of popularity. And one pleasing feature
of the new temptation to travel north
ward is that Eastern tourists will see some
of the prettiest and most prosperous por
tions of California in their ride from Mon
terey through the Santa Clara Valley.
The first large party over the coast route
is expected to come from the excursion
that will reach Colton Sunday.
ATTEMPTED BOBBERY,
Clarence Turner Is Held to Answer to a
Serious Charge.
Clarence Turner, who was recently ar
rested in Oakland on a charge of having
burglar tools in his possession, was
brought over from Oakland last night and
booked at the Central station on a charge
of assault to commit robbery.
Some weeks ago Turner went to the
Baltimore House in the guise of a mes
senger boy. He knocked at the door of
0. T. Dyer and when that gentleman ap
peared he pointed a revolver at his head
and demanded his money.
It so happened that Dyer had about $40
in his pocset. He seized the weapon and
rinally secured it, whereupon Turner took
to his heels. Dyer visited Turner when
the latter waa in Oakland Jail and identi
fied him as the man who had attempted
to rob him.

PAGE BROWN MEMORIAL
William Keith's Handsome Trib
ute to His Friend, the
Architect.
WILL BE HUNG IN A CHURCH.
One of a Series of Landscapes to Deco
rate the Swedenborgian
Meeting-House.
When the news of the death of A. Page
Brown reached this City it found William
Keith putting the body touches or. a big
wood scene for the Swedenborgian Church.
The Rev. Dr. Worcester happened to be
the one who first gave the news to the
painter. Keith and Brown had been great
friends and admirers of each other's worts.
Keith was a good deal affected when Dr.
Worcester toid him of the architect's
death. He laid down his brush and palette
for a time and the philosopher ana the
painter sat down before the glowing coals
in the latter's studio and â and said noth
ing for a while.
"Mr. Brown would have liked that pic
ture," said the philosopher, as he cast a
last glance at the dreamy green and yel
low wood scene on the easel before he left.
"Perhap3 he would," said the painter.
"I know he liked that Kind of work."
And all the rest of the day, as he toiled
with his colors slowly on the big canvas,
making it more dreamy, putting thought
and feeling and even a bit of sadness in
his work, with just a tiny patch of hopeful
blue sky in the far, far distance, at the end
of that long somber path through the
woods, the artist thought of his absent
friend and wondered if he would have ap
proved the picture. And by and by the
answer seemed to come plainly enough,
and it was that his friend, the architect,
had ever been appreciative. Then a wish
came in the artist's mind to pay some last
ing tribute to his absent friend, and the
thought followed it to make this picture a
memorial offering.
Dr. Worcester approved of this. Other
friends of the late architect and members
of the church of which Dr. Worcester is
pastor, and for which this picture and some
others were destined to be bung, also ap
proved of it.
And so it was decided. This picture is
to be a memorial to the late A. Page
Brown, friend of the artist who painted it
and architect of the church in which it is
to hang. Mr. Brown was not a member of
the Swedenborgian Church, but he was the
valued friend of its pastor and of many of
its members. The picture is particularly
designed for mnrai decoration, and to this
end is given a flat tone, so that no matter
how the light from the windows strike the
canvas the tints and shades show in their
natural colors and the whole picture is
discernabJe from any point in the room.
A black and white reproduction hardly
does the work justice. It is done in
Keith's best style, and in the blending of
the shades and tints lies its greatest glory.
A. Page Brown would have said, "It is a
picture that will bear looking at, and the
more one looks at it the more one sees."
TREASON IN THE PULPIT
Rabbi Voorsanger Is Opposed to
the Domination of the
Church.
Religious Bodies Considered as Educa
tional and Moral Aids to the
Government.
A new solution of the church and state
problem was given by the Rev. Dr. "Voor
sanger in his lecture last night at the
Temple Â£manu-EI. He appeared to
ignore the supernatural idea of a church,
divinely constituted and supreme in the
domain of faith and morals, and disap
proved any such claim to spiritual
sovereignty on the part of any religious
"There is nothing supreme in this glori
ous country of ours," said the reverend
gentleman, "but the constitution. To my
mind, all religious organizations are
merely moral agencies for the formation
of good citizens. And yet how different
an idea is entertained by many of our
fellow-citizens, and inculcated in numer
ous pulpits.
There is among us a body of believers,
claiming to be true and patriotic citizens,
while recognizing and obeying a foreign
spiritual power. What can we think of
such a system? Only this: the tribute
of loyalty and submission which this body
is vowed to pay to its distant sovereign
must detract from their fealty to the con
stitution of our country and make them
Ipiss perfect citizens.
"I could never see any reason for regard
ing one church as being superior to an
otber. To my mind the Roman church,
with its well-regulated and aristocratic
hierarchy, is on an equal plane with the
Salvation Army or any other sect. All
churches are more or les3 aline. They all
teach mildness; and they all have perse
cuted when they had the chance. Read
the sad story of the revocation of the edict j
of Nantes; foot, if you can bear the sight, i
at England during the reign of Elizabeth ; 1
while even in our own country we have to
deplore the persecutions which so deeply
stain the pages of New England's history.
In all these instances the church departed
from her province, which is to aid the state
in making better men.
"The framers of our constitution did not
allow considerations of sect or creed to
hamper them in their noble task. While
bowing in reverence to the supreme power
which rules the universe, they decreed
that no church should dominate the
Americans of future generations, and
placed themselves on record as believers
in the great truth that religion is greater
than the church.
"We would all do well to study our
country's constitution, and having weighed
it well, to look to it as our supreme law.
The church must be regarded only as a
moral and educational functionary of the
government. To believe that any" foreign
power is above our country's laws is to be
faithless to our duty as citizens. To
preach so false a doctrine from any pulpit
is treason."
NOT HIS MONEY ORDER.
Arrest of a Stocktonian by the Federal
Authorities for Crooked Work
Here.
Gus Braunschweigger was arreÃted at
Stockton last evening, at his home there,
by Chief of Police Kingsbury, on the
strength of a telegram from Postal In
spector Munro stating that the man was
wanted in San Francisco for fraudulently
collecting a money order of $50.
It appears that Braunschweigger came
to San Francisco a few days ago, and call
ing at the Postoffice got a letter for him-
self and also one for a nephew named
Edward. He opened the latter letter and
deposited the money order found in it
with a saloon-keeper until next day, ana
then went to the Postoffice, and, getting
some one to identify him, the order was
paid. He spent the money and returned
to Stockton.
When arrested he said: "When one does
a jig f they generally have to pay the fid
dler." A Deputy Sheriff will go to-mor
row and bring the prisoner to this City.
He has a brother who is a prominent
liquor-dealer here.
THE COUNT CARLOS CINI
An Italian Nobleman Who Has
Come to Greet the Duke
of Abruzzi.
The Count's Story of His Struggles in
Taking Wild Game in tl 2
Sierra Nevadas.
The notable arrival at the Palace Hotel !
yesterday was that of the Count Carlos
Cmi of Rome. He has been in New York,
Colorado and the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains of California, where he has been
hunting and enjoying himself in other
wave.
He has come now to greet the Duke
Abruzzi, an old friend, who will arrive here
from Victoria on an Italian warship.
The Count is a man to cause a flutter in
the hearts of susceptible young maidens.
He seems not over2B years old, is of rather
more than medium height, inclining to
spareness and has a pleasant, resonant
voice. He wears a closely cropped beard
and is altocether what maj r be called a
handsome man.
He told the story of his coming yester
day, referring to his friend, the Duke,
meanwhile.
"I arrived in the country first about four
months ago with the Count dcs Garretts,
who is interested in mining," he said. "I
spent considerable time with him, and
then turned my attention to hunting and
fishing, for I enjoy the use of the rod and
gun. It was up in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains. I hoped to kill some bear, out
was not fortunate enouph to get any.
However, I succeeded in killing a number
of deer, and as fine ones, too, as I ever saw.
I thought I might get a few California
lions, but there were none around where I
Â»was. I, however, got a large number of
different kinds of California wild fowl.
"It is my intention to remain hereabout
a month. I want to meet the Duke
Abruzzi, who is to come down from Vic
toria on Monday."
The Count's card speaks volumes for his
family, aÂ« the words indicate not only the
name and title, but the palace and street
of the Eternal City, being in full : "Comte
Carlos Cini. Palazzo Cmi, Piazzadi Pietra,
Rome."
TheCinnas are of the time of the Crcsars,
some 2000 years ago. One of them was a
prominent co-worker with Mark Antony
when the latter made his famous speech
over the body of Julius Osnr. Another,
as will be recalJed, was a poet, who though
no relation to the conspirator of his name,
was taken for him by the mob, and Buffered
death. The Count did not say whether or
not his name was slightly modernized from
this, but at any rate it appears to be as old
and existing fully as lont; in Rome. The
Count has been lately in the mines.

SUING LUCKY BALDWIN.
Sensational Action for $75,000
Pending Against the
Millionaire.
LILIAN ASHLEY IS PLAINTIFF
Depositions in the Case Telling thÂ«
Story Upon Which the Suit
Is Based.
To the suit of Miss Lilian Ashle>
against E. J. Baldwin, there have been
added three depositions which contain the
main allegations in the case against the
millionaire. The depositions are those of
Dr. J. W. Trueworthy and Nancy C. Dren
nen, who attended Miss Ashley when the
child, of which Baldwin is alleged to be
the father, was born; and also of E. Porter
Ashley, brother of the plaintiff.
The suit is one brought by Miss Ashley
against Baldwin for $75,000 damages for
betrayal. Dr. Trueworthy testified he had
made a return of the birth to the effect
that it was Baldwin's child, because the
mother had told him ouch was the fact.
The nurse, Xancy Drennen, testified to
the same offect, and both witnesses said
that the plaintiff's reputation was good.
Porter Ashley stated that he came here
from the East in March, 1893, and that he
met his sister at Arcadia, at which place is
Baldwin's Santa Anita ranch. On April
19, 1893, he and she came to this City,
where they stopped at the Baldwin Hotel,
rie left San Francisco June 9of the same
year. He said he did not pay any bill at the
Baldwin Hotel, nor did he work during
his stay in tbe City. Mr. Baldwin had
promised to give l;im a position in the
hotel, but the promise was never f ui ilied.
He said, further, that Baldwin's business
manager had offered to help pay his pas
sage East.
While at Arcadia, he said, he and hia
sister used to go horseback riding around
the ranch (the Santa Anita), but lie never
paid any of the livery bills. During that
time, he said, Baldwin treated his sister
with marked attention, but the brother
saw nothing out of the way between them.
Sometimes Baldwin took her out riding or
driving, but his attitude toward her was
always respectful. He used to play cro
quet with her, too.
It was on April 16 that Ashby first
Jearned that Baldwin had led the young
woman astray.
The suit was originally filed by Miss
Ashley in Los Angeles. It created a sen
sation at the time, although but few of the
facts of the case were given to the public.
Miss Ashley is the daughter of well-to-do
and respectable parents in the East. She
was born in Royalton, Vt., twenty-seven
years ago.
Baldwin had the case transferred to the
San Francisco courts, and here it will bo
tried. The child was born December 7,
1893.
KING'S POOL ORDER.
A Substitute Measure for the One Re
cently Before the Board of
Supervisors.
The joint Health and Police and License
Committee held a meeting yesterday to
consider the poolroom license ordinance
recently submitted to it by the Board of
Supervisors.
Dr. Filben of the Civic Federation ap
peared before the committee to protest
against its acceptance. He said it would
be an outrage upon the community to give
the sanction of law to the business of sell
ing pools on horse races, and commented
upon the evils resulting from the business.
He said it was particularly injurious to
minors, but that it should be prohibited
on general principles.
The minister was listened to patiently,
and Supervisor King introduced a resolu
tion "providing for and imposing a license
on commission brokers who receive money
to place on horse races." It differs from
the original in that it does not impose a
license on bookmakers engaged in their
vocation at the racetracks.
Those selling pools outside the tracks
are required by the proposed ordinance to
pay a license of $50 a day or $500 a quarter,
and minors are prohibited from entering
the rooms.
Action was postponed until the legality
of the Ellert ordinance, under which a
number of poolsellers were recently ar
rested, is passed upon by the courts.
A Would-Be Suicide.
