MORTON'S BOOM
NOW LAUNCHED
Republicans of New York
Indorse Their Governor
for President.
BUT NOT UNANIMOUSLY.
Commotion Caused by an Attempt
to Name McKinley as
Second Choice.
FAVORS THE GOLD STANDARD.
The Platform Opposes Unrestricted
Coinage Until There Is an Inter
national Agreement
NEW YORK, N. V., March 24.-The Re
publicans of the Empire State to-day pro
nounced emphatically in favor of Governor
Levi P. Morton as their first and only
choice for President of the United States.
By a vote in the ratio of 6to 1 they voted
down an attempt to secure a declaration
in favor of McKinley for second choice,
and if the friends of any other
candidate should have attempted to
securÂ« recognition for him it is cer
tain that they would have fared no bet
ter. The State convention neld in this
city to-day was, from beginning to end,
an enthusiastic demonstration in favor of
New York's favorite son, and the effort
made in behalf of the Ohio statesman only
served to emphasize the unanimity of the
party in favor of Morton.
The introduction of a resolution to sub
' stitute General Sam Thomas of this city
and Mayor Edgar B. Everett of Buffalo
lor ex-Senator Platt and Edward Lauter
bach for delegates-At-large to St. Louis
and to instruct the delegation in favor of
McKinley as second choice led to the only
exciting incidents of the convention. The
resolution vaÂ« offered by Thomas Fitchie
of Brooklyn, formerly bupervisor-at-Large
of Kinga County, and its introduction was
followed by an attempt on the part of Mc-
Kinley men to create a demonstration in
behalf of their favorite. The applause of
the two or three hundred delegates and
spectators was speedily squelched by the
cheers of several thousand Morton men.
Aside from this incident the proceed
ings of the conventioD were largely of <t
routine character.
An hour before the convention was
scheduled to be called to order the specta
tors began gathering in the hall and by
11:30 o'clock there was a goodly assem
blaee. At 11 :20 a delegation of 275 stroug
from the Capital City Club of Albany filed
into the hall. A big colored man preceded
them oteTying a banner upon which was
inscribed: "Capital City Club, Albany.
For President, Levi P. Morton."
Directly l>ehind the capital city men
came another Albany delegation, 250
strong, from the Republican League. All
wore silk hats and in the front band was
fastened a small photograph of Governor
Morton.
At 12 o clock, the Hour named in the call
for the meeting of the convention, about
two-thirds of the delegates were present
and the remainder rapidly marched in.
Ex-Senator Thomas C. Platt, who had at
12:15 got up from a sick-bed to attend the
convention, was given an ovation. After
he had taken his seat in the third row
from the front the crowd gave three
cheers for the Republican leader.
Chairman Hackett came in unobserved
and at 12:22 p. m. called the convention to
order. At 12:45 the roilcall was concluded
and Chairman Hacket nominated as the
temporary presiding officer of the conven
tion Senator Cornelius R. Parsons of
Rochester. Senator Parsons was greeted
with applause when he appeared on the
platform. The mention of Governor
Morton's name in his speech was the
signal for prolonged applause, which was
repeated at the conclusion of the address.
Resolutions for the appointment of
committees on credentials, permanent
organization, resolutions and nomina
tions were then offered and adopted, and
after they were named the convention
adjourned until 7:30 p. m.
The hall was packed when Temporary
Chairman Parsons called the evening ses
sion to order. Permanent organization
â was effected by the election of Congress
man Southwick as permanent chairman.
Mr. Southwiek was received with enthusi
asm, it being several minutes before the
crowd would let him say a word. In tak
ing the chair he said in part:
"If I were to assume the role of a politi
cal prophet I would predict that in Novem
ber next the American people will vote
into power at Washington that party
which declares for the American system
of protection to home labor and industry
and the maintenance of a system of sound
and honest money. No Republican pos
sesses a patent on ttie issue of protection
nor a monopoly in any other form. The
only monopoly of the issue at the present
time is enjoyed by the Republican party,
and each Republican enjoys an equal
share of the honor with every other Re
publican. No sturdier protectionist will
be presented to the favor of the St. Louis
convention than Levi P. Morton."
The American people, the speaker said,
voted for a change in 1892. It came. This
year they will vote for a change to the
conditions which prevailed in 1892, having
â offered from a process of education on the
tariff question during the past three years,
the like of which has not been experienced
in the present eeneration and will not
likely be invited again. The speaker al
luded to tbe tariff policy of the Wilson-
Gorman act as a tariff for deficiency, and
commented at length upon the financial
deficiencies during the present adminis
tration, which bad also involved bond
issue?, which has been preferred by Presi
dent Cleveland to increased revenues.
Betweet: a President devoted to bond
sales and a Democratic-Populistic alliance
devoted to free silver coinage, every meas
ure of treasury relief provided by the Re
publican House has failed to receive
Democratic support, and has been returned
The San Francisco Call.
to the House loaded down by the Senate
with a free silver amendment.
Along with a revival of the protective
tariff, said the speaker, must come a
restoration of the policy of reciprocity
of trade with the nations of the West
Indies, Central and South America and
Europe â the brilliant creation of James G.
Blaine â which was denounced by the De
mocracy and ruthlessly destroyed by the
Wilson-Gorman act.
"To-night ttie representatives of mili
tant and triumphant Republicanism have
assembled here for the purpose of sending
to the National convention at St. Louis
four delegates at large instructed to cast
their votes for Levi Parsons Morton. Our
Presidential candidate requires at my
hands neither introduction nor eulogy.
The American people in their collestive
capacity have honored him by their suf
frages. The Empire State has honored
him before and is honoring him again.
She presents him to the Republicans of
the United States as her candidate for the
Presidency and asks on the part of the
delegates from sister States a calm con
sideration of his qualifications for the
highest office in the gift of the American
people â calm consideration and that
alone. On that basis we ask and urge his
nomination."
The point against McKinley made by
Mr. Southwick at the outset of his speech,
when he declared that no Republican had
any monopoly of the principle of protec
tion, was enthusiastically applauded. Mr.
Platt nodded his head in approval and
clapped his hands.
After Congressman Southwick concluded
his speech Chairman Aldridge of the com
mittee on nominations was called upon for
his report. He presented the names of
General Tracy and E. A. Butler for elec
tors at large; Messrs. Platt, Miller, De
pew and Lauterbach for delegates at large,
and Messrs. Fisn, Babcock, Witherbee and
McMillan for alternates at large. Before
Mr. Aldridge had finished reading the re
port he was interrupted by ex-Supervisor
Thomas Fitchie, who had refused to agree
to the action of the committee in the after
noon, but the chairman refused to yield
the floor. As soon as he resumed his seat
Mr. Fitchie again addressed the chair. He
said he had a minority report to make.
The chairman said there could be no mi
nority report in this instance.
"Then make it what you please," said
Mr. Fitchie. Call it an amendment. Mr.
Chairman, I move an amendment to the
report of ttie committee on nominations."
The amendment presented by him was
as follows:
Xew York, March 24, 1896.
To the Republican Convention of the State of
Xew York â Gentlemen :~The undersigned
minority of the committee on nominations
respectfully disagrees with the report of the
majority in the choice of delegates-at-large to
the .Republican National Convention at St.
Louis. Mesars. Chauncey M. Depew and War
ner Miller are, it is understood, willing to cast
their v^vtes in the National Convention in ac
cordauce with the sentiments of their State.
It is therefore desirable that their associates be
men of kindred spirit, and the minority of the
committee on nominations respectfully pre
sents as the other two delegates, Hon. Edgar
B. Jewett o/ Buffalo aqd General Samuel j
Thomas of New York, with the recommenJa- j
tion that ii it appear alter the first ballot that >
Hon. Levi P. Morton cannot be the choice of i
the National Convention, the delegates
at-large from this Slate use all honorable
means to promote the cause of William McKin
ley of Ohio. Respectfully submitted,
Thomas Fitchie,
Of the Minority of Committe on Nominations.
During the excitement following the in
troduction of the amendment some one in
the orchestra balcony swung a small ban
ner .over the railing wnich was inscribed,
"McKinley, Prosperity's Advance Agent."
Then a Morton banner was thrown out
alongside of it. In all parts of the upper
galleries Morton banners appeared and
tremendous cheering followed. The Mc-
Kinleyites were completely drowned out.
Nothing could stop the wave of Morton
entnusiasm. Delegates and spectators
stood upon their seats and shouted and
handkerchiefs and hats were tossed in the
air.
The chairman repeatedly tried to re
store order, but no attention was paid to
him. Mortou banners were placed upon
the platform and the crowd cheered again.
It seemed impossible to get the conven
tion to order. Finally the confusion sub
sided and the voting on the amendment
to the committee's report was begun. The
result of the ballot was announced by
Secretary Kenyon as follows: For the
amendment 105, against the amendment
663. The announcement was greeted with
great applause.
The majority report of the committee
on nominations was then adopted by
acclamation.
Senator Lexow was called upon for the
report of his committee and presented tue
platform, reading it himself, and then
moving it* adoption. There was no ob
jection and the report was unanimously
adopted. Following is the platform :
The Republicans of New York, in conven
tion assembled, again declare their firm and
unyielding adherence to the doctrine of pro
tection to American industries, protection to
the products of the American farm and pro
tection to American labor. We are in favor of
a tariff which, while providing an income
sufficient to meet the expenses of tbe Govern
ment.nonestly and economically administered,
at the same time secures home labor and home
capital from unequal foreign competition. We
believe in a reciprocity with other nations,
which shall give our producers and manufac
turers an opportunity to dispose of their sur
plus products and to obtain articles we desire
from those countries on the most advantage
ous terms.
The agitation for the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1 seriously disturbs all in
dustrial interests and calls for a clear state
ment of the Republican party's attitude upon
this question, to the end that the trade of the
country at home and abroad may again be
placed upon a sound and stable foundation.
We recognize in the movement for the free
coinage of silver an attempt to degrade the
long established standard of our monetary
system and hence a blow to public and pri
vate credit, at once costly to the National
Government and harmful to our domestic and
foreign commerce.
Until there is a prospect of international
agreement as to silver coinage, and while gold
remains the standard oj the United States and
of the civilized world, the Republican party
of New York declares itself in favor of
the firm and honorable maintenance of that
standard. We believe in a business adminis
tration of the Government by business men on
business principles for the benefit of the busi
ness interests of this great people. For nearly
four years the material progress of ihe Nation
has been blocked. All branches of trade have
suffered and the workmen have been deprived
of reasonable and living wages by the utter
lack of business commonsense among our
Democratic rulers. It is the duty and privi
lege of the Republican party to promptly
amend this unhappy state of affairs by nomi
nating and electing a business man for the
Presidency, and we ask tbe aid of thoughtful
Republicans everywhere In this great and
meritorious work.
On this platform we present Governor Levi
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MARCH 25, 1896.
Boss Rainey â "Come, you fellers ; hurry up and get that stream going!"
P. Morton as New l'ork's Republican candi
date for President. He is in every way fit for
the high honor, and he is practically tbe man
of the hour. He would prove a business Presi
dent for the good of all interests of the people.
Governor Morton's long and honorable service,
his spotless character, his great executive abil
ity, his devotion to his party and its principles
eminently fit him for the Presidency and en
titles him to our hearty and enthusiastic sup
port. Therefore we instruct our delegates to I
the St. Louis Convention to present him as our
candidate for President, and urge upon them
to use every honorable means to secure his
nomination.
The convention adjourned sine die at
9:45.
THIS TRICK IS VERY NEW.
Neat Confidence Game by Which Two
Sharpers Swindle a Clark -Street
Merchant.
CHICAGO, 111., March 24.â A new con
fidence trick was played to-day by two men
on Leopold Orenstein, a Clark- street mer
chant, the loss being watches and jewelry
valued at $267. A carriage stopped at the
merchant's place and two men alighted,
one a fine-looking elderly person with a
wild, wandering gaze and an ostentatious
display of fine jewelry and costly cjothing.
While the elderly swiadter was examining
the jewelry, the other whispered to Mr.
Orenstein that his master was a confirmed
kleptomaniac and payment on the spot
would be made for any goods which the
unfortunate might take, the merchant be
ing reassured by a show of bills in the sup
posed servant's hands. The goods were
taken, ;he owner counted the value and
was given a roll of bills. After the swind
lers left the store, the roll was fouud to be
counterfeit, except for a $10 bill.
IT WILL NOT COME HERE
San Francisco Shut* Out of the
W. C. T. U. Convention
hy the Railroad.
Favorable Rates Could Not Be Secured
and a More Central Site Is
Selected.
CHICAGO, 111., March 24.â At a meet
ing to-day of the general officers of the W.
C. T. U. called by Miss Willard, who has
just returned from a trip to the South, it
was decided not to hold the next annual
convention in San Francisco, although
that City had been previously chosen.
Among the reasons for the change is the
request of the National Suffrage Associa
tion that in view of its own active opera
tions on the Pacific Coast this year the
white ribbon convention should be post
poned one year. It was also believed that
the convention should be held near
Kansas, as a crisis in the temperance ques
tion Mas impending in that State.
The railroads have also refused to make
the concessions that were expected. The
convention will probably be held in St.
Louis next October or November.
A telegram was sent to-day from
National headquarters to Ballington Booth
protesting against the new army wearing
a while ribbon as a badge on the ground
that it belonged to the W. C. T. U.
Governor Levi P. Morton, Who Has Been Indorsed for President by the New York
Republicans.
OPPOSES ALL
FUNDING BILLS
Barham Before the House
| Committee on Pacific
Railroads.
PRESENT PLANS FUTILE.
If an Extension of Time Is Now
Denied the Lines Will Pay
Their Debts. â¢
STITBES EVADES THE TRUTH,
Rates in California Not Arbitrarily
Lowered Twenty-five Per Cent
. by the Commission.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 24.âRep
resentative : Barham of California," to-day
appeared before the House Committee on
j Pacific Railroads in opposition to the vari
! ous funding; and foreclosure- plans. ; He
claimed that if the ; Pacific railroads were
given to understand that the time in which
their debts were to .be paid would not be
extended they would find the money to
pay Up. â _â '.. - " ' : :'â â '/ 'â¢ ': â  : \
-He presented the resolutions of the Leg
islature of California adopted February 1,
opposing any extension of â¢ the ' payment
of the debts, and ; the "Reilly" funding
bill, or any bill of 'like import. v The reso
lutions request the California Congres
sional delegation to use all honest means to
â defeat any such proposition, and demand 1
the; immediate collection on maturity of
the debts of the roads.
Barham criticized certain statements
made before the committee by Mr. Stubbs,
vice-president of the Central Pacific Com
pany. He read from Ms. Stubbs' state
ment the charge that the ; Democratic
members of the California Railway Com
mission had '.' been elected to office upon ,
the ; distinct -pledee; that they would de
crease freight and passenger rates on the
California roads 25 per cent, and that the
commission had ; arbitrarily made such a
reduction and put it through without any
hearing -or opportunity \ for , appeal. â In
contradiction of those charges Mr. Bar
ham read a letter just received from Chair
man La Rue of that commission, in. which
he said that the only reduction made by
the commission was 8â ! per cent on grain
alone, and "that ; instead of being]; an arbi
trary reduction, "put through i without a
hearing," as charged by Mr. Stubbs, the
reduction was only made after a hearing
occupying nine days. Mr. La Rue also
certified that he never made a pledge of
any sort as to what he would do if elected
Railroad Commissioner.
Barham said that the people of Califor
nia were almost unanimously opposed to
any sort of refunding bill for the Pacific
roads and explained why Congress should
not consider such a proposition.
Barham closed with an argument to
prove that the United States was not
barred by the statute of limitation from
collecting its debts against the roads, as
had been claimed, and read from the recent
Stanford decision to show that this point
was not considered in that case, but was
explicitly reserved in the decision. No
statute ever runs against the Government
he said, and if the companies owed the
Government $97,000,000 and had never paid
in but $2,000,000 they could clearly be com
j pelled to pay the remaining $95,000,000.
| T:je books were full of cases where stock
| holders ha"d not paid in their full capital
stock, and the corporation having become
insolvent they were sued and made to pay
up in full.
He contended that a case involving so
many and such intricate legal points
should not be decided by Congress, or a
committee of Congress, but tbat the courts
shonlJ be ]Â«?rmitted to decide upon and
settle the whole case.
HUyTIXGTOX MAY IET WIX.
Sub- Committees to JJraft a Rill to "Set
tle" the Jiebts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 24.â The
Senate Pacific Roads Committee to-day
appointed a sub-committee, consisting of
Frye, Brice and Wolcott, to meet with the
House scb-comniittee and draft a bill to
adjust the debts of the Pacific roads. If
I there has been auy doubt that Hunting-
I ton's plan of "settlement" would be
| adopted that doubt is expelled now. Frye
is notoriously a railroad man. He is
known in Washington as Huntington's
"man Friday."
Nothing may be said of Brice, as it is
well known that he owns stock in the
Union Pacific.
The Call correspondent has contended
from the start that Hubbard's plan would
j fail and that the Smith-Frye bill would be
| agreed upon. This fact is now patent to
i all who are familiar with the situation
; here, but it is exceedingly doubtful
whether the bill will pass at this session,
if it passes at all. Tne bill's opponents
are beginning to believe there is a good
) chance to defeat it.

MYSTERY OF A WOMAN'S DEATH.
Arrest of a Prominent Business Man of
Philadelphia in Connection With a
Crime
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 24.-The
finding of the dead body of a young and
pretty woman in Girard avenue last night
caused a decided sensation in the neigh
borhood, a sensation tnat became more
general as the police investigated the
affair.
The body was soon identified as that
of Annie McGrath, and the identifica
tion was quickly followed by the ar
rest of Samuel P. Langdon, president of
the L'nion Coileries Company, a man
widely known in business and social cir
cles in this city. Langdon is a man about
55 years of age.
The authorities have refused to make
public the charge against Langdon, nor
vrill they tell what is knowa or suspected
as to the cause of the young woman's
death. It has leaked out, however, that
Langdon and the girl have been living
together for the past month.
The police have also taken into custody
Bertha Stewart, a colored servant. It is
not thought that she was concerned in the
crime. She is probably held as a witness.
AOT ACCIDENTALLY KILLED.
It It Sow Believed That the Family of
Oldhouse Were Murdered.
ALMA, Wis., March 24.â 1t was discov
ered here to-day that the family of G. F.
Oldhouse, which were cremated in their
burning house two weeks ago, were mur
dered, and their deaths were not accidental
as at first supposed. The family consisted
of the father and mother and five chil
dren.
A neighbor reported to-day that Mr. Old
house had $500 in the house a day or two
before the fire, and the belief is gaining
ground that somebody knew this and
murdered the farmer and family to se
cure it.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minx., March 24.-Â»
William McKinley carried Minnesota's
State convention of Republicans to-day!
His only barrier to a solid delegation t a
St. Louis, the candidacy x>f Senator Cush
nian K. Davis, was removed in the morn
ing by a telegram from the distinguished
Minnesotan, who is now in Washington,
and when the message was read MuKin
leyism swept the meeting in a huge tidal
wave. The Ohio protection^ is now as
sured of the solid vote of the Minnesota
delegation at St. Louis.
At the opening of the convention a tele
pram was read by Congressman Tawney
from Mr. Davis announcing his retirement
as a candidate for the Presidency of the
United States. This step on the part of
Mr. D.ivis was not unexpected and left
everything wide open for ihe McKinley
men, who had easy sailing from that time.
R. G. Evans of Minneapolis, George
Thompson of St. Paul, L. P. Hunt of Blue
Earth County ana Charles F. Hendrix of
Steams County were elected delegates-at
large by acclamation. All are stanch Mc-
Kinley men.
Cheers followed the reading of Senator
Davis' message at all points and when his
name was read three wildly enthusiastic
cheers were given. On every hand Mc-
Kinley and Davis men were congratulat
ing one another on the outcome of the
contest. The fact that McKinley was the
man first, last and always was as>ured,
and the Davis supporters were well aware
of that fast anU knew that their case wm
hopeless.
Every time the name of Ohio's favorite
son was mentioned cheer after cheer shook
the rafters of the hali. The first sneaker,
William Henry Eustis, said that while
Senator Davis had the respect and admira
tion of every citizen of the Slate of Minne
sota nevertheless he would be but an ex
periment, while on the other hand wit.li
William McKinley it was an assured fact
that if he were elected, and he certainly
would be, thesrood old times of yor* would
again be felt on every hand. William Mc-
Kinley would sweep this country in No
vember next from, the Golden Gate to
Bangor, Me., and from Florida to the
State of Washington.
The platform declares for the use of
both gold and silver "to the extent to
which they can be maintained in circula
tion at a parity in purchasing and debt
paying power; that we are earnestly op
posed, under the present conditions, to
the free and unlimited coinage of silver,
for the manifest reasons tha-t it would de
stroy such parity, enormously contract
the volume "of currency by forcing gold,
out of circulation and immediately place
us on a silver basis; believing also that it
is a self-evident fact that the effect of the
international demonetization of silver can
be overcome only by international remone
tization of that metal, the Republican
parly of Minnesota most heartily favors an
international conference for that purpose.

Allison Men Secure a Temporary Victory
in Texas,.
AUSTIN, Tex., March 24.â The Repub
lican State Convention to elect delegates
to St. Louis met here to-night and at mid
night had succeeded after much strife in
electing N. W. Cuney temp.orary chair
mar.. Cuney is an Alli3on man, but the
ballotâ 473 to 207â is not a criterion on Al
lison's strength, as many McKmley men
voted for Cuney for the sake of harmony.
There is prospect of a split. The Allison
wing wants two of the delegates, but this
the McKinleyites are not willing to con
cede.
The latter claim if the convention re
mains intact they have strength enough to
elect and instruct for McKinley. The
Allison men assert that they formed a com
bination with Reed's followers last night
and they insist on two of the delegates.
The executive committee gave the McKin
leyites a black eye by seating Allison dele
gations from San Antonio and Austin,
and Allison men now claim they have a
chance of naming all the delegates.
WARREXSBURG, Mo., March 24.â The

vention to-day renominated Congressman

Republicans of South Dakota Ready for
Their Convention.
HURON, S. D., March 24.â Nearly all
the delegates for to-morrow's Republican
convention are here. The crowd is the
largest that has gathered here in many
years and includes many old wheel-horses
of ihe Republican party of South Dakota.
A striking feature of the personnel of the
delegates is the great number of young
men. While each delegation has its favor
ite, there are indications that concessions
will be made whereby strife Vpithin the
party will be avoided. A telegram was
received from Senator Pettigrew this even
ing, saying: "Will go as delegate if my
friends insist, and will do as convention
desires if instructed." This was received
by E. C. Caldwell of Sioux Falls, and was
a great surprise to some of Senator Petti
grew's opponents. It acted like oil upon
troubled waters and did much toward qui
eting the fears of his friends. The Mc-
Kinley sentiment has grown wonderfully.
While many are unable to harmonize Sen
ator Pettigrew's telegram with the expres
sion that he would refuse to go to St. Louis
as an instructed delegate, there is a strong
inclination to include him in the delega
tion.
Hon. John H. King arrived from Wash
ington this evening to heip inaugurate an
Allison boom. Congressman Dolliver ad
dressed an immense throng to-night.
URGED TO RECONSIDER.
Friends of Harrison Ash That He Re
enter the Race.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ixd., March 24.â Close
personal friends of ex-President Harrison
say that the almost certain triumph ofv,
McKinley in the St. Louis conven
tion has caused prominent Republi
cans throughout the country to flood the
ex-President with letters urging him to re
consider his determination and consent to
be a candidate for the Presidential nomi
nation. Some of the writers say it is his
duty to save the party from the McKinley
nomination and the campaign of bitter
ness that would surely follow, owing to
the fact that he is regarded as the personi
fication of the extreme idea in protection.
One of the writers declares that Mc-
Kinley's nomination will array the East
against the West, and the manufacturer
against the producer, and thus precipitate
a campaign of slander and abuse, while a
more conservative nomination would cer
tainly enhance the auspicious outlook for
Republican success. The writers all urge
the uncertain attitude of McKinley on the
money question.
It is believed here that the letters will
have not tne slightest effect.

An Argument in the House
on Removing Restrictions
on Confederates.

Alone He Votes in the Negative
When the Bill Is Put to
a Ballot.
OTHEK MEASURES ABE PASSED.
Request of the Senate for Further
Conference on the Cuban Resolu
tions Granted.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 24.-Quite
unexpectedly to-day the House was
plunged, toward the close of the session,
into a debate "in the course of which the
war was fought over again and the issue of
which was the repeal of the last remaining
restriction against those who served in the
Confederate army.
Hull (R.) of lowa had presented from
the Committee on Military Affairs, for the
consideration of the House, the Senate bill
which repealed section 1218, revised statutes,
regulating the appointment of officers in
the army or navy, providing that no per
son who held a commission in the United
States army and afterward entered into
the service of the Confederate States, or
or any State thereof, should be appointed
an officer in the army or navy of the
United States.
Boutelle (R.) of Maine vigorously op
posed the passage of the bill. He said
that it could serve no practical purpose,
was a reflection upon the sentiment which
had enacted the original lawâ one of the
measures, he said, which made it possible
for the Government to live; that it was
too late now to write a new definition of
the duty of the men who .took the com
mission of his country, and he said the
House should not now declare that it was
a right thing for a man, after having taken
an oath to support and defend his coun
try, afterward to draw his sword against
it. In the course of his remarks Boutelle
said that some concessions should be made
from the other side, and he called atten
tion to the fact that the constitution of
South Carolina, adopted only last year,
levied, as he said, a tax upon residents
who had served in the Union Army by a
discrimination in the matter of the pay
ment of the tax in favor of the Confederate
veterans.
The bill was advocated by General
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio Pickler (R.) of
South Dakota, Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania
and Walker (R.) of Virginia, who suc
ceeded Stonewall Jackson in command of
the latter's famous brigade, and Cum
mings (D.) of New York.
The bill was passed after two hours'
debate. Bouteile alone voting in the nega
tive.
The unfinished business when the
House met was the bill introduced by
Curtis (R.) of New York to reduce the
number of crimes subject to capital
punishment, and it was passed.
The House agreed to the Senate request
for & further conference on the Cuban
resolutions. Boutelle (R.) of Maine re
ported the bill making an appropriation
for maintenance of naval establishments
for the year ending June 1, 1897.
The following bills were passed: House
bill to increase the penalty for trans-port
ing or selling liquors under false and spu
rious brands; Senate joint resolution re
storing to the Mormon church the real es
tate now in the hands of a receiver ap
pointed by act of Congress; Houbo bill
authorizing appeals from the decrees of
the Circuit Courts of the United States in
the matter of receiverships; House bill
making persons who commit crimes on
Government property and reservations not
covered by Federal statutes subject to the
penalties for these crimes in the State in
which ,the property or reservations are lo
cated; making it an offense punishable
with imprisonment up to twenty years to
shoot or to throw a stone at or into a rail
road train in the Indian Territory ; mak
ing typewritten depositions legal; author
izing persons holding medals of honor for
distinguished services in the War of the
Rebellion to indicate that fact by wearing
! a rosette or bow, the design of which the
President is directed to approve; author
izing the issue to active or retired officers
of the army of brevet commissions equal
to the highest rank of brevet held by them
in the volunteer service.
After the passage of a number of bills
and the appointment by Speaker Reed of
Hitt (R.) of Illinois, Adams (R.) of Penn
sylvania and McCreary (D.) of Kentucky
as managers on the part of the House of the
conference asked for by the Senate on the
Cuban resolutions, the Senate bill repeal
ing the law torbidding the appointment of
any person as an officer in the army who
held a commission in the army at the
breaking out of the rebellion and who
afterward served in the Confederate army
was called up by Hull (R.) of lowa. The
bill was intended, he said, to wipe out the
last restriction imposed upon the Confed
erates. They were in Congress, in the
Cabinet and could be elected, he thought,
to the Presidency, and to maintain this re
striction now that wars and rumors of wars
were heard was about the worst policy
that could be pursued.
Boutelle asked if Hull knew of any one
who would be benefited by the passage of
the bill and the latter replied that he did
not.
Boutelle criticized the bill as a piece of
unnecessary and wholly sentimental legis
lation. Addressing the Republicans Bou
telle recalled the effort to place General
Grant on the retired list of the army, a
proposition which, he said, he was sorry
to say met the unanimous opposition of
the gentlemen for whose benefit the pres
ent legislation was intended. These men,
he said, had not hesitated to act as jurors
in the case of the United States against
iitzjohn Porter and voted solidly to place
him on the retired list.
Wheeler (D.) of Alabamaâ l am a man
who voted against putting Grant on the
retired list. It was unanimously passed.
Boutelle retorted that the Democrats
prevented even an opportunity to vote
upon the bill until the Republicans, driven
to their wits' end and fearing that the
gavel would fail at the end of the session
and Grant die before he could receive that
honor at the hands of Congress, surren
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
dered the rights of a representative from
lowa, who sacrificed his seat to the de
mands of the Democrats, and after his
successor had been sworn in, and not until
then, the Democrats consented to a vote
on the bill which placed Grant's name on
the retired list.
The bill, Bo.utelle contended, would not
be effectual. It would not give to any old
soldier on the Union side who was now in
private life the nght to bear a commission
in the army.
Hull (R.) of lowaâ Neither does it give
the right to the Confederates.
Bouteile (sharply)â Well do yon want to
give them that right?
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio replied to Bou
teile, and after a few words of introductory
explanation why he should support the
bill, remarked : "And now we are chal
lenged by the gentleman from Maine."
Bouteile â I challenged nobody. lam not
in that business.
And then, after a brief colloquy, Bou
teile continued : "I desire to say further
to the gentleman from Ohio that I am not
speaking and have not spoken in the in
terests of any candidate for the Presi
dency." [Derisive laughter.]
Grosvenorâ Has it come to that point,
Mr. Speaker, when, because one of us pre
fers A for the Presidency and other B and
another C, that every time we rise to
speak that thing shall be shouted at us?
I think it very small politics, Mr. Speaker,
and I shall not answer the gentleman in
kind.
Continuing, Grosvenor said he based his
support of the bill on the belief that his
action here should be in the way of aiding,
so far as it was possible for him to do so,
the enconragementof loyalty and devotion
to the flag in all parts of the country.
[Applause.]
Bouteile â Does the gentleman believe
that the Government should pass legisla
tion of this kind ?
Grosvenor â I believe the Government
ought to do what is right. As far back as
the time of General Grant, that great and
illustrious hero, who had received the high
encomiums of his friend froln Maine, had
taken one of these Confederates into his
cabinet; he had made Mosby, the great
cavalry Jeade*r of the South, Consul-Gen
eral at, Hongkong and had appointed
General Longstreet, who, he would say
with all deference to the opinion of those
who differed from him, was in his judg
ment the ablest rebel general, to a position
of high honor and trust.
Bouteile â And wasn't Longstreet ostra
cised for taking it? [Cries of "No."]
Grosvenor said that for himself he had
always hoped to live to see the time when
it should be the policy of his party to re
move from the statute-books everything
that tended to discriminate between the
residents of the different sections of the
country.
Bouteileâ Does the gentleman know of
any Southern man who has asked for the
passage of this bill? Who brought it here?
Grosvenor â God only knows. Bur, I
would not be so willing to giant it for the
asking as I would to give it freely as a
matter of grace. [Applause.l
Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania made an elo
quent and stirring speech upon the subject
of patriotism in general, and Pickler (R.)
of South Dakota advocated the passage of
the bill. Referring to the statement of
Boutelle that the passage of this bill would
mean a reflection upon those who enacted
the original legislation, Pickler called at
tention to the fact that in no less than five
cases had Congress repealed portions of
that law of which now only that part re
mained which was sought to be repealed
by the pending bill.
Walker (R.) of Virginia next arose to
address the House and was received with
a round of applause- In the South, he
said, there was a turning to the Union
with a devotion that people who did not
mingle with those of that section could not
understand. There are yet many in the
South, General Walker said, who were
educated at West Point still capable of
fighting, and if the Nation should be put
in peril from foreign foe, would not the
Government desire their services? All
that the old Confederate asked, he con
tinued, was to be told to go and sin no
more, "if you will have it thatwe did sin."
Pearson (K.) of North Carolina â Did you
not lead the glorious old Btonewall Brigade
after General Jackson's death?
Walkerâ l did. And I am proud of it,
not because I led the brigade, but because
I was thought worthy of succeeding to
the command. 1 say to the Republicans,
although it is true as suggested a while
ago, that Longstreet was ostracised, the
time is now passed when a man can be os
tracised as he was. And it is for the pur
pose of wiping out all such feeling that we
ask the passage of this bill.
Cummings (D.) of New York paid:
"General Grant was a war Democrat; if he
were on the floor to-day there would be no
question of the passage of this bill. I was
one of the 800,000 war Democrats in the
North that marched to the front to sustain
the Union, and in their behalf I give my
support to the bill. I voted for General
Grant for President both times he was a
candidate, and if he had been nominated
again, imperialism or no imperialism, I
would have voted for him a third time."
Cummings advised the Democrats not to
vote upon this question, but to throw the
responsibility where it belonged.
"If you desire to say," addressing the
Republicans, ''that Grant was wrong, and
that thirty years afterward you were right
vote down the bill."
The demand for the previous question
was seconded by a unanimous vote with
the exception of that of Boutelle, and the
bill was passed by the same vote, Boutelle
rising in his soat to announce his position
when the negative vote was called for by
the Speaker. And then at 4:55 o'clock the
House adjourned until to-morrow.

FIERY WORDS IN
CUBA'S CAUSE
Senator Mills of Texas
Hurls Defiance at
Spain.
HIS JOINT BESOLUTION.
Declares the United States Should
Enforce the Rights t>f the
Patriots.
THAT IS THE MONROE DOCTRINE
If Necessary the Army and Navy
Ought to Seize the Troubled
Islands.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 24. -The
matter of chief interest in the Senate U>
day was the speech of Mills of Texas, in
support of his joint resolution requiring
the President to procure from the Spanish
Government the right of self-government
for Cuba, or in the event of Spain's re
fusal to take military possession of the
island and hold it until the Cubans organ
ize a government and raise military and
naval forces for its defense. Mills took the
ground that, inasmuch as the United States
would not permit England, France or any
other country to purchase or obtain the
island from Spain and thus ameliorate the
condition of the inhabitants, the United
States was morally bound to put a stop
to the cruelties and misgovernment
there, and to aid the Cubans in
establishing a government of their
own. This idea was elaborated Dy Mills in
a passionate speech, which at times drew ap
plause from the galleries. He asserted that
the United States had the rights not only
in Cuba, but in every foot of soil in the
western hemisphere; that that was the
Monroe doctrine; that that doctrine was
as old as humanity, and that God Al
mighty was its author, as it was the right
of self-preservation. "The United States
should say to Spain," Mills exclaimed,
" 'You must give that island self-sovern
ment or we will; we are able to do it,
too.'"
After Mills' speech some additional cor
respondence bearing on the Cuban ques
tion was brought forward by Morgan of
Alabama and then the joint resolution was
placed on the calendar.
A bill was reported from the Judiciary
Committee and passed amending the law
in regard to the punishment of Indians for
a felonious assault (the penalty now being
death) so as to leave it discretionary with
the court.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts offered a
resolution, which was agreed to, requiring
the President to transmit to the Senate
copies of all dispatches, notes and tele
grams in, the Department of State from
November, 1875, an til the pacification of
Cuba in 1878, which relate to mediation or
intervention by the United States in the
affairs of that island, together with all
correspondence with foreign Governments
relating to the same topic.
The joint resolution introduced yester
day by Mills (D.) of Texas, looking "to the
seizure of the island of Cuba by the
United States in case the Spanish Govern
ment shall refuse to grant self-government
to the Cubans, was taken up. and Mills {
addressed the Senate in advocacy of it. |
He would have voted, he said, for all the
resolutions offered on the subject of Cuba
because they were stepsâ although short
stepsâ in the line of march which it was
the duty of the people of the United
States to take. The island of Cuba
did not. Mills declared, stand in
the same relation to the people
of the United States as Hungary, Poland,
Ireland or Armenia did. If it did, then
the statesmanship of the United States
had been at fault fora hundred years. The
United States had never asserted that it
had any rights In Ireland, Hungary, Po
land or elsewhere in Europe, but it had
asserted its rights in every solitary acre of
land on the western hemisphere. It had
there the highest rightâ the right of self
preservation. The Monroe doctrine, he
declared, was as old as humanity and God
Almighty was its author. For when he
made man he placed in him the right to
preserve his life and liDerty. The fathers
of the republic had said for a hundred
years to Cuba, to England, to France, to
all the earth: "You shall not touch one
solitary acre of this land with your sov
ereignty."
"We have said," Mills continued, "that
we will resist with all the power of this
Government the transfer of the island of
Cuba to any European power. Jefferson
said it. Gallatin said it. John Quincy
Adams said it. Henry Clay said it. Mar
tin Van Buren said it. James Buchanan
said it. William E. Marcy said it. It had
been the unchallenged American doctrine
that the island of Cuba shall remain with
Spain, unless it come to us; that Spain
shall hold it in trust; that we shall resist
its transfer by the whole power of the
army and navy, and there we have had it
for a hundred years. And now I come to
the point. If we have held that position
by an assertion of a moral right to protect
ourselves, to secure our own homes, to
secure our own commerce and trade on
the ocean ; if we have said that Cuba shall
not go out of the hands of Spain, notwith
standing that England might say to Cuba:
'I will give you the fgovernment that I
give to Canada; I will give you a Parlia
ment, an executive of your own selection;
I will give you thÂ«Â» power to levy your own
taxation if you please; I â¢will give you
home government; I will not interfere ex
cept to protect you id case any other
power interferes with you,' yet the United
States has stood by as a jailer and has
said, 'Tuat trade shall not be avade.'
"Wherever there are rights," said Mills,
' 'there are corresponding duties, and I say
that the people of the United States owe
to that oppressed and downtrodden people
of Cuba to say to Spain: 'The hour has
come when you must Btop your iniquities.
We are responsible for the slavery of that
people ; we are responsible for every drop
of blood you have shed ; we are respon
sible for every dollar you have stolen ; our
consciences is involved in this matter.
Cuba has a right to appeal to us, and we
intend that you shall give her free govern
ment.'"
Mills read a letter detailing atrocities
said to have been perpetrated by General
Weyler in the last Cuban war, and he
characterized him as "an atrocious scoun
drel, who would not be in Cuba to-day if
the United States had drawn Her sword,
as it was her duty to do, and established a
government that would protect helpless
females in their homes."
Mills compared the protection which
Spain gives to Cuba to that which the
hawfc gives to the dove, and said that all
these atrocities Were committed while the
United States was acting as jailer and
guardian.
Mills recited an incident of an Ohio
colonel accidentally wounding the hand of
ttxe daughter of a Confederate officer in an
attempt to arrest the officer. The Ohio
colonel had shown great anxiety about
that wounded hand and had finally asked
for and obtained the hand, and around
that family hearth, he said, "There are
half a dozen noble boys, half Yankees
and half rebels, but all Americans." [Ap
plause.J
The point of the anecdote is that Amer
icans on either Side of the great Civil War
did not shoot or ill use women or chil
dren.
MilJg then launched into an eloquent
recital of the battle of Alamo and of other
scenes in the struggle for Texan independ
enco, and then he related the incidents of
the massacre by General Murriel of the
fifty-three Americans arrested .on board
the Virginus. He described the long
negotiations to bring Murriel to justice
and how, after four or five years, they had
liually failed, and in contrast with that
ul'fair ho recalled an incident in Salonica
in 187<>, when the German and French
Consuls were stabbed to death in an effort
to save a Greek girl from a mob. The
Turkish Government on that occasion did
not, Mills said, wait for any invitation
from the French and German Governments,
but telegraphed to them that it would
punish those who had attacked the Con
suls. The French and German Govern
ments' however, did not even answer the
telegram, but sent their fleets to Salonica,
landed their marines, compelled the Turk
ish Government to bring the wretches
before them, shot to death six of the
depredators and exacted $100,000 for the
family of each of the Consuls.
That, he said, was the way to do busi
ness. But why was it that of late years
every time that an attempt was made to
maintain the dignity and honor of the
United States some tremendous power
began to manifest itself in an opposite
direction?
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada suggested an
explanation in the lact that Spain owed
$1,200,000,000 of bonded debt, $300,000,000
of which has a lien on the Cuban revenues.
It was the duty of the United States,
Mills declared, either to protect the people
of Cuba or to say to France, England and
other European powers, "If you want the
island take it."
But the United States should say to
Spain: "You shall give that island self
government or we will.
"And we are liable to do it, too," Mills
added. He had received a letter from New
York to-day speaking of him as another
fool who had turned jingo like Sherman
and Lodge and signed "A Disgusted
Democrat. "
At the close of Mills' spepcti Morgan
(D.) of Alabama rose, and after some com
plimentary remarKs on tne speech to
which the Senate had just listened he pre
sented some additional correspondence
bearing on the Cuban question, and then
the joint resolution was sent to the
calendar.
The legislative appropriation bill was
taken up and its consideration proceeded
with from pntre 31, which had been re
ported yesterday.
All the committee amendments to the
bill were disposed of, and then numerous
amendments were offered by individual
Senators. The bill did not reach a final
vote, but went over until to-morrow.
The Senate at 5:30 adjourned until to
morrow.

BAYARD AT THE BANQUET
Talk of the Embassador Before
the London General Pen
sion Society.
Responds to the Toast of "Our Kin
Beyond the Seas" in Cheer
ful Tones.
LONDON, Ens., March 24.â The anni
versary dinner of the London General Pen
sion Society was given to-night. Among
tne guests was the Hon. Thomas F. Bay
ard, the American Embassador, who re
sponded to the toast "Our Kin Beyond the
Seas." He remarked upon the strong
family likeness of the kin beyond the seas
to the people of England. They were, he i
said, as like two peas, and they resem
bled each other in patriotism and pluck.
Mr. Bayard dwelt upon the differences
of opinion among his countrymen and
upon the value of individual opinion. He
said that since he came to England he
had never found occasion to change his
tone, and there was notning he would say
here that he would not oay at home and
vice versa. [Cheers.] He did not expect
unanimity and would almost say God for
bid it. A man must not be expected to
speak in a tone that would suit everyoody.
He rejoiced that in the system of Govern
ment that originated here and that had
been carried beyond the Atlantic there
was something that enabled a man to
speak according to his own conscience.
| Cheers.] There, too, lay the strength of
both countries.

FIRST CAR PUSHED BY HAND.
Two Lines of Steel Along Corte
Madera Avenueâ Officers Cited
for Contempt.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 24.-The
Mount Tamalpais 'Scenic Railway Com
pany has taken the law into its own hands
and defied the property-owners along Corte
Madera avenue. To-night 200 men seized
the avenue and stretched rails along the
surveyed route of the road. This move,
following closely upon the citation to-day
of the officers of the road to appear before
Judge Angelotti of San Rafael to show
cause why they should not be punished
for contempt of court for having strewn
ties along a portion of Corte Madera
avenue last night, in defiance of the in
junction proceedings to prevent this move,
has caused the wildest excitement. Resi
dents of the city who do not live on this
thoroughfare appear to favor the com
pany's intention. When the improvised
track was completed at 10:10 o'clock to
night a large crowd "lent a hand" and
while deafening cheers arose the first car
was pushed over a portion of the new rail
way.
The workmen placed the rails as fast as
they possibly could. They stretched two
lines of steel across the Blytbedale road
and rapidly moved up Corte Madera
avenue. The force was short of railroad
spikes and consequently used but one to
every three or four tit-s. In a few hours a
line one mile and a half long, to connect
with thespur ud the mountain, was com
pleted. The property-owners are foiled, as
they could not secure an injunction to pre
vent the work.
The sound of the sledge and the clang
ing of the steel ties can be heard all along
Corte Madera avenue to-night.
CIT Eli IOR C OXTEMP T.
Officers of the Railway Summoned to I
Appear in Court.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., March 24.â The
plaintiff in the injunction suit against the
Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
Railroad sprung a big surprise this morn
ing when the case came up in court to be \
tried. Mr. Windmiller, the plaintiff,
through bis attorneys, stated that the
mountain road company had disobeyed
the injunction of the court and had laid
rails and ties upon Cone Madera avenue
in Milt Valley. The court took a recess of
fifteen minutes, in which to allow Wind
miller to make an affidavit to that effect.
In his affidavit Mr. Windmiller states
that the men employed bt the California
Construction Company in the building of
the Tamalpais Mountain road had, either
last night or this morning, laid rails upon
Corte Madera avenue for a considerable
distance and bad strewn ties along the
route of the road. M. M. O'Shau^hnessy
swore to a like affidavit.
Judge Angeiotti immediately made an
order citing the officials of the company
to appear next Monday and show cause j
why they should not be punished fpr con- |
tempt. Later it was explained that the
men did not Know they were laying the
track on the dis.puted territory. About
sixty feet of rails were laid.
President S. B. Gushing of the Mountain
road explained the presence of the ties by j
stating that one of the wagons employed !
in hauling the ties had become imbedded
in the mud, and the teamster, to lighten
his load, had thrown off the ties which I
Windmiller had seen upon the road.
Late this afternoon Judge Angeiotti ren
dered his decision in the injunction pro
ceedings by denying the application of I
plaintiff, Maurice Windmiller, for a per- |
manent injuncion, and dissolving the
restraining order then in force.
MARE ISLAND "LIFERS."
Nearly One Hundred Men at the Navy-Yard
to Be Placed on the Classified Civil
Service List
VALLEJO, Cal., March 24.â David Clop
ton, a special laborer performing writer's
duty for the inspection board at Mare
Island, has received a letter from Con
gressman Hubbard congratulating him on
the possibility of his soon being able to
Bay that he held alifeÂ»position at the navy
yard. Next week Secretary of the Navy
Herbert wouid. with the approval of the
President, issue an order placine clerks,
writers, special laborers, janitors and all
other appointees of the Secretary under
the classified civil service list, and those so
placed could not be removed for political
or other reasons so long as they performed
their duty.
This measure has been under considera
tion for some time, and, it is intimated,
only awaiting the filling of ail positions
such as named with adherents of the pres
ent party in power. With but three or j
tour exceptions, this has apparently been i
done at Mare Island. If the Jaw is carried ;
into effect, nearly 100 persons at the navy- \
yard will be assured of life positions, and j
to-day many of them were congratulating |
themselves "upon the receipt of the news,
as obtained from the letter of Congress
man Hubbani. The Treasury and Army
departments will also be placed under
civjl service rules.

X( union.
SACRAMENTO, Cai,.. March 24.â There
was a brief meeting of the Republican Con
gressional Committee of the I Second Con r
gressional District , in the Supreme Court
room at the Capitol building- for the ' pur
pose of arranging; the method to be pursued
in the selection of delegates to the Repub
lican State Convention, which will select
delegates to the National Convention. In |
this district there are thirty-two commit
teemen; and in all fourteen were present,
they holding the ' proxies of those who

After the members convened a commit
tee of three was appointed to draft resolu
tions. After a brief absence they rreturnerd r
a resolution, to the effect that tix county
committees < be ; empowered ;to either ap
point delegates or call primaries for that
purpose. This was unanimously agreed
upon and the convention adjourned.
Interviews with various members of the
county committee indicate that they were
"all ac sea" and could not state what would
be the ultimate outcome.
PLACERVILLE MISB SALE.
Monroe Salisbury Invests in a Valuable
Property.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., March 24. â
Negotiations closed to-day for a large mine
situated six miles south of Placerville.
Ten months ago D. H. Jackson bought
groilnd from Samuel Salisbury, developed
it. placed machinery and two Huntington
mills in it, and named the mine the Salis
bnrv, after the original owner.
The property comprises 250 acres.
Several persons "have been seeking to buy
it, but Monroe Salisbury, breeder of fast
horses and also a mine operator in Colo
rado, Utah and Arizona, to-day captured
the prize. He will immediately sink a 500
--foot shaft, erect a hoist, add milling
machinery and lay a large pipe line. The
price paid is not made public, but is con
ceded to be a good round sum.

SEATTLE, Wash., March 24.â The
Methodist ministers of Seattle have for
mally protested against and are doing what
they can to prevent a sword contest from
coming off on Easter Sunday at Madison
Park in this city between Captain Jennings
and Baron Malchin, tne Russian cham
pion. The indications are that the entire
Ministerial Association will be drawn into
the fight, and the Mayor has been called
upon to prevent the exhibition. Concern
ing the matter Captain Jennings said:
"We have as many woman at such con
tests as men and sword contests amuse
Queen Victoria most. She always at
tended them in Agricultural Hall."

EZETA RAN FOR COVER
His Stay on the Salvadoran
Coast as Brief as It Was
Exciting.
Ignominious Flight Followed the Ap
pearance of a Troop of Govern
ment Soldiers.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 24.â The tug
â  Barclay Golden, Captain Hanson, arrived
; to-nicht from Panama after a voyage full
'of incident and adventure. One of the
j crew relates the experience of the tug off
the Salvadoran coast, where Antonio
Ezeta and Manuel Casin tried to land and
i start a revolution.
"Ezeta and Casin decided upon a land
i ing place." says this fellow, "and then
they showed their courage by putting
Kineally, one of our passenger, where
jhe would be most apt to get shot.
Ezeta, Casin, Kineally. one or two others
and I went ashore in a sheltered place
where the surf was not so strong, and the
understanding was that Kineally would
i go inland, get a horse and drum up Ezeta's
! friends. We got ashore safely and landed
a big demijohn full of mescal, some food
and a gun for Kineally. Ezeta and Casin
j were to stop on shore till Kineally re-
I turned.
"Then Kineally remembered that he had
â  no money to get a horse with, and Casin
! and 1 had to go back to the tug to get
i some. We got it and made ashore again,
I and Kineally started away carrying the
demijohn and the grub. He got about a
quarter of a mile away when over the
brow of the hill ahead of him appeared
about fifty soldiers, who saw him and gave
I chase at once. He dropped the demijohn
and scampered toward the boat. I tuink
j the soldiers were unaware of our presence,
! or they would have lain in wait and
j bagged us all.
"Well, sir, you ought to have seen Ezeta
I and Casin scramble into that boat. It was
j some ways out in the surf, but they just
j half swam and half ran toward ft and
tumbled in. I was already there. They
begged me to pull off toward the ship and
never to mind Kineally, but I would not
:do it. All this time Kineally was legging
| it toward us, and the bullets were begin
ning to whiz around us. The soldiers were
; speinting toward us and 6hooting as tney
| ran.
"Kineally made remarkably good time
| and got to the beach abosit twenty yards
ahead of the soldiers. He was almost
j exhausted and I had to get out and help
him into the boat. Ezeta aijd Casin could
j have rowed away and left us. but they
j were both crouching in the bottom of the
j boat and hardly breathing. Kineally and
I got in and we got back to the tug "with
out being hurt, but the bullets â whi.-tled
mighty lively for a while. I saw a soldier
take up the demijohn and sample the
mescal in it and then draw the attention of
his partners to the prize.
"That ended Ezeta's attempts to land
on the Salvadoran coast.. The last we
saw of Ezeta and Casin they were in
Panama, dead broke. Devlin was there,
too, and he cried when we sailed away.
He has a brother who is District Attorney
of Solano County, I think. The other
fellows scattered, and so we left them.
Kineally returned to San Francisco on the
City of Sydney. We did not have any
trouble in Panama, as was reported, and
we were not arrested. The American
Consul told Ezeta and Carfn that they
could not come back with us, and Captain
! Hanson was warned not to take them to
Salvador or to carry arms for them, and
the arms W3 had were taken away."
Geneaitee Murderer to Be Hanged.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 24.â Frank

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
THREE FAVORITES IN THE SAN JOSE CARNIVAL CONTEST.
ALL SANTA CLARA
COUNTY IS VOTING
Choosing a Queen to Rule Over
the Coming Carnival
ot Roses.
SANTA ROSA'S MERRY WAR.
Superstition Enters Into the Rivalry
of the Belles â Fetes in
Other Cities.
BAN JOSE, Cal., March 24.â The remit
of the balloting for queen of the Carnival
of Roses up to date will be made known
to-morrow evening and it is expected the
contest from now on will be lively. The
names of several ladies voted for have
| been withdrawn, as they decided not to be
candidates for the honor. The present
contestants are Misses Grace Adel, Meta
Laisy, Lillian Kea of Gilroy, Julia Lauck
of Santa Clara, Mamie Sullivan, Maud
Phelps and Bertha Warren.
The contest, it is believed, is between the
first three nameJ, and that there will be a
battle of ballots the like of which has sel
dom been seen is likely.
A Gilroy dispatch to-night says: Public
interest in the Rose Carnival at San Jose is
increasing daily. An entertainment is
under way by home talent for the benefit
of the fund to give Gilroy a proper display
in the pavilion and parade. Mrs. Frank
C. Stamford, the superintendent of the
Ladies' Auxiliary, has plans about com
pleted, and the one thing needful now â
moneyâ is beinc raised. Ballot-boxes have
been placed in convenient places for votes
for the carnival queen, and Gilroy will
strive to carry off that honor.
S AST A ROSA SUPERSTITION.
Voters Believe That Third Street Will
Again Supply a Queen.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 24.âSuper
stition has now taken possession of some
of the young men of this city interested in
the carnival queen voting contest. Those
who believe that "what is to be will be"
now declare that Miss Sara Hall, who is
believed to be now leading, is sure to be
elected. It is pointed out by these predes
tinators that Miss Hall lives on the street
that has furnished all former queens; that
more pretty girls and more candidates live
on this street than on any other in the
city. This favored th6roughfare is known
as Third street and the charmed precincts
are said to be between B and Wilson
streets.
Miss Nettie Royal, whose stately beauty
won for her the honor two years'ago. is a
resident of this street, and scarcely a
stone's throw away lives the popular
favorite of last year, Miss Isabel Donovan.
Miss Florence Donovan and Miss Ada
Royal, the younger sisters of the two ex
queens, have been no less favored by
nature and the charmed locality, and wiil
hereafter give their elders a merry race.
James McMahan, who resides on the cor
ner of Third and Davis streets, is the father
of three beautiful daughtersâ the Misses
Margaret, Rose and Cecelia â any of
whom would grace the floral throne. The
three charming daughters of T. J. smithâ
the Misses Agnes, Jessie and Blanche â
are also residents of the street that pro
duces queens, and are gÂ»eat favorites in
Santa Rosa society. Miss Sarah Jacobs,
Miss Lillie Leddy and Miss Alice Tucker,
whose homes are near the junction of
Davis and Third streets, have all been
spoken of for royal honors, and any of
the trio would make a graceful queen.
Last, but not least, in the galaxy of Third
street beauties is the "street quartet" con
sisting of Miss Sara Hall, the leader in the
contest to-day, her right-hand neighbor,
Miss Lulu Leppo. and directly across the
street Miss G. Reid and Miss Carrie Hood.
It is these four young ladies who add lus
ter to the glory of Third street, anil cause
the superstitious young men to believe
that the prize must drop in that locality.
Much important business was transacted
at a meeting of t c carnival directors last
night. Chairman Proctor of the hotel and
rooms committee reported a plan for list
ing all the available room â  in town for the
use of guests. Those arriving late can in
this way ascertain from the committee
just where to secure rooms without waste
of time.
Colonel Walter S. Davis of the street
decoration committee announced that it
had been decided to erect six magnificent
arches over the approaches to town. These
will be handsomely decorated with flowers
and illuminated by 2000 Chinese lanterns
at night. Two hundred and fifty dollars
was set aside for the use of this committee.
It was decided to allow cash pr.zes of
from $25 to $50 each for the best-doco rated
iloats from the country school districts of
the county.
A letter was read from the private secre
tary of Colonel Budd saying that the Gov
ernor had accepted an invitation to attend
a festival at Los Angeles in the middle of
April, and if possible to return in time
would accept the invitation of Santa Rosa
to be present on May 1 and 2.

LOS AXGELES* COURT.
La lie inn de la Fiesta's Maids of Honor
Are Announced.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 24.âSo
ciety was in a flutter to-day when the
names of the maids of honor selected to
attend the Queen of La Fiesta were an
nounced. The galaxy of beauties is com
poseed of Mrs. Arthur Braly, and Misses
Helen Klokke, Cora Goodrich Ahna Rob
inson, Hattie Kimball, Ida Menifee. Har
riet Smith, Isodora Scott, Sarah Innes,
Lila Fairchild, Lillian Wellborn, Olga
Marix, Bessie Bonsall, Hortense Levy and
Bessie Byram. The name of the queen
herself is still a profound secret, and will
be kept fo, if possible, until the eve of the
fiesta. Judging by the personnel of the
maids of honor, however, it is surmised
that the queen is either Mrs. Mark Lewis
or Mrs. E. P. Johnson, sister of Mrs. Mo
dini Wood, queen of last, year's carnival.
There are others, however, who believe
that the queen is, and of right ought to be,
Mrs. John Bradbury, and still others think
that Mrs. Albert Carlos Jones will wear
the crown. __^^_____^____
FRESNO SEER'S PROPHECY
Patriarchal Darius Myers Sees
the Millennium Near .
at Hand.
Grand Gathering of the Chosen to
Take Place During the Com
ing Summer.
FRESNO, Cal., March 24. â Darius
Myers, an aged vineyardist of patnarchial
mien, who resides a few miles south of this
city, has been known for yearn as a Bibli
cal student and prophet. He has pub
lished many tracts expounding and ex
plaining the Scriptures, many of which
nave shown considerable literary merit
and indicate remarkable knowledge on the
part of their author of the Scriptures. His
latest production deals with the millen
nium and what he designates as 606 re
ligious denominations, which, he has de
cided, will have no part nor lot in the
"first stage" of this millennium. Regard
ing this "first stage" the aged Biblicist
says :
This gathering of the saints to the mountain
on which the feast is held is the same ns the
gathering of the elect (Matt. xxiv:3l, Luke
xvii:37). This is to take place on June 16,
1896. It is at this feastand gathering that the
church of the first born (Heb. xii:23)is to be
organized ami set In the body oi the Christ,
every one, as it hath pleased (iod to set them,
as (1 Cor. xii:18) each one will have a name
and place in the walls of God's house that shall
not be taken from them (Isa. lvi:s).
After quoting many passages of Script
ure the author further on says:
By the above it is seen that those who do not
get ready for the first fruit.s harvest of June 16,
1896, will have to wait for 1000 years before
they will be harvested and receive the hidden
life (Col. hi:3-4).
Throughout his leaflet the author speaks
of tne 666 religious denominations at Mer
ozites, and in this connection he says:
Now, which of the 660 Merozites have ever
come up to the help of the Lord as much as to
publicly acknowledge or advocate this king
dom of Christ upon the builded ruins of
David's throne and kingdom. All with one
consent are antagonists and enemies agiinst
such a kingdom. Nor do they expect any lot
or part in such a kingdom umier the whole
heavens, as stated in Dan. vii:27, which is to
fill the whole earth, as stilted in Dan. 11:41,
when the Knowledge of tiie Lord will till the
whole earth (Isa. xi:9, Ilabb. ii:l4. From
1 Pet. 1:12 we learn the prophets were to min
ister to the gospelage during the gcspel king
domages.
In explanation of his oft-quoted
"Merozites" the writer says:
There are 666 different lurge denominations,
besides small ones (Revelations xiii:lÃ).
Not one of these will come up to the help or
advocate the building up acain of the throne
of the LiOrd upon which David and Solomon
sat (I Chronicles xxix:23 ami II Chronicles
xiii:B), which was overturned in the days of
Zedekiah (Chronicles xxxvi:ll-19) and was lo
remain overturned (Ezekiel xxxi:27) until
after the Loru's return from a visit to the
gentiles (Acts xv :16), when its ruins were to
be builded up again as it wag in the days of
old (Amos ix:ll). Now out of these 666 differ
ent inhabitants of Meroz not one comes up to
the help of the Lord to build up again the
throne of David that is now fallen down and
in ruins.

VISALIA JUSTICE
IS NOT CHEATED
Si Lovren Will Recover From
the Wound Inflicted by
Himself.
IS FAST GROWING STRONGER.
The Attempt at Suicide Strong Evi
dence of Guilt â Inquiry Into
McCall's Death.
VISALIA, Cal., March 24 âThe attempt
of Si Lovren, the saloon-Keeper accused of>
having planned the Southern Pacific
train hold-up near Tulare early Jast
Thursday morning, to end his life by cut
ting his throat in prinon, appears to have
ended in failure. Dr. Patterson reports
Lovren's condition as much improved and
he has a good chance to recover. Ho
takes nourishment, his pulse is stronger
and the color has returned to his face.
The attempt at suicide has given the pros
ecution more confidence in the case
against the band of robbers.
The Coroner's inquiry into the death of
Dan McCall was resumed by Coroner J. C.
McCabe this afternoon. W. W. Wright of
Fresno, engineer of the train boarded by
McCall, was the principal witness. He
testified:
"We arrived at Goshen atll:s7o'clock]at
night, and while oiling the engine Depu
ties Daggett and Reed came up. They
surprised me, for I had heard nothing of
an attempted hold-up and they looked
somewhat 'tough' themselves. They asked
me to Je: tuem ride on the engine to Tu
lare and handed me their credentials. I
gave them permission to ride and they
got inside the coal board and sat down on
the coal. A short time after we started I
chanced to look back and saw a man get
ting up over the end of the tender. I no
ticed his mask, and then he pulled a rifle
and revolver on me and the fireman and
shouted something which in the noise I
took to be 'Hold up your hands.' Then
the shooting between this man and the
deputies took place, both firing about the
same time. The robber shot four times
and then fell off the east side of the ten
der. I let the train run a short distance
and then slowed down, stepped back to
the tender and asked the deputies if they
wanted to get off. Reed said they were
both shot and that I should go on to Tu
lare. This was the first I knew that they
had been shot by the robber. Reed
watched for a second robber till we got to
Tulare. I started to leave the cab through
the front window after the robber shot first
and had got one foot out when I noticed
the fellow fall. Then I came back. The
I whole thing occupied but a minute, per
i haps, but in the excitement it seemed a
long time to me."
Other witnesses were examined aa to
minor details. The jury, after hearing the
evidence, returned a verdict of "Death by
a gunshot wound at the hands of Deputy
Sheriffs Earl Daggett and Vie Reed, while
in the discharge of their official duties."
OFF FOR ARIZONA WILDS.
Lord Sholto Douglas and His
Cowboy Friend in Search
of Adventures.
Will Traverse Western Wastes and
Pejietrate Miasma-Breeding Jun
gles of the Isthmus.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 24.â Lord
Sholto Douglas and hi? friend, John E.
Coker, the wild and woolly cowboy artist,
late of Arizona, started for Phoenix, Ariz.,
this evening. Tiiere they will procure an
outfit and set out on a burro ride through
the waste paces of Arizona, New Mexico
and Old Mexico and the jungles of Central
America. The trip is undertaken for
profit as well as adventure, it being the
purpose of Sholto to write an account of
his travels for a press syndicate, while
Coker will draw pictures illustrating the
subjects written about by his lordship.
They claim to have secured credentials
from rive great newspapers, which have
contracted to take the literary matter fur
nishen by them at a rate that will make
the undertaking remunerative;
The start will be made from Phoenix, for
the reason that Coker has a number of
horses on his brother's ranch near that
place, which he will exchange for burros
and the paiaiihernalia of a pack-train.
The journey will be made by easy staged
through the wildest territory that can be
found. To make sure that they will be
well treated in Mexico the young adven
turers will carry letters of introduction to
President Diaz and other notables from
John T. Gaffey, Judge Sepulveda and other
distinguishedcitizens of Los Angeles, who
are well known in Mexico.
'â¢We have mapped out no definite
route," said Lord Sholto previous to his
departure. "It wilt De a sort of go-as-you
pjense trip, as we have all the time at our
disposal that we want and we shall want
to see every place ol special interest in the
countries through which we travel. We
expect to go as far as Central America
and if all goes well and the novelty is not
worn off by the time we get there we may
decide to prolong the journey to Cape
Horn.
"No, I am not afraid of perishing in the
desert or being killed by Indians. Coker's
cowboy experience in Arizona has inured
him to desert life and I consider him a
competent guide, philosopher and friend.
W T e will go well armed and be prepared to
defend ourselves against savages and des
peradoes, but will exercise discretion by
giving hostile Indian tribes a wide berth
unless guaranteed protection by the pres
ence of soldiers.
"Lady Douglas has several engagements
in Chicago, where she will remain for the
present, although she may join me in the
City of Mexico later on. There is no
truth in the dispatch from Chicago that
she is on her way to England to visit my
people. We both prefer the roving, inde
pendent life we can lead in this country,
and shall not go to England until the
giddy whirl of life in London's social
circles possesses more fascination for us
than it noes at present.
"Good-bye," his lordship said at parting.
"You newspaper fellows have had a good
deal of sport writing me up since I started
in my brilliant career in California, and now
I propose to do a little pencil-pushing for
the press myselfâ not for the glory of it,
but 'for revenue only,' as some of your
blooming politicians say. Adios."
AROOSA.UTEI* IN '49.
Death of Ex- Warden Robinson of San
Quentin Prison.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 24.â Q. W.
Robin3on, a California pioneer, and at one
time Warden of St. Quentin Prison, is
dead, at the age of 87. Mr. Robinson
crossed the plains from Kansas City in
1849, coming direct to Los Angeles, where
he resided till 1857, when he went north to
take charge of San Quentin, returning after,
ward to Los Angeles, which remained his
permanent home.
Mr. Robinson was a native of Georgia
anri a typical argonaut, being endowed
with the mental and physical powers
which enabled the pioneers of 1849 to push
their way beyond the confines of civiliza
tion and found an empire by the western
sea. In the eighty-four years of his life he
did not know what sickness was till a
stroke of apoplexy suddenly ended his
career.
It is said of Mr. Robinson that he en
joyed the distinction of casting the first
vote that was ever deposited in an Ameri
can ballot-box in Los Angeles. A widow,
four children and fourteen grandchildren
survive him.

PORTLAND STREET AFFRAY
Lawyer Nutting Belabored by a
Woman Who Charged Him
With Fraud.
She Pummels Him With an Umbrella
and Disfigures His Flowing
Beard.
PORTLAND, Or., March 24.â W. L.
Nutting, a well-known lawyer, was this
afternoon attacked on Morrison and Third
streets by Mrs. Isabella Walker. She
caught hold of Nutting's flowing beard and
tore a handful of hair out of it. With the
other hand she belabored, him with an
umbrella. The episode did not last more
than a minute, but it attracted a crowd of
hundreds, who seemed to enjoy the affair.
In the midst of cneers and laughter Nut
ting freed himselt from-the woman's firm
hold and ran aown Third street followed
by a hooting crowd.
The woman, though, stood her ground
and related the cause prompting her as
sault upon the lawyer. Some months ago,
she claimed, she paid Nutting $50 to oD
tain a decree of divorce for her. He de
layed matters until slie changed her mind
and demanded the return of her money.
Nutting refusing to make restitution, she
began suit for the recovery of the $60 and
got judgment. Ab he had nothing upon
which to levy and still refused to pa}', she
lay in wait for him this afternoon.
Mrs. Waiker threatens to "do him up"
every time she meets him until she has
had $50 worth of excitement. Several
peace officers witnessed the interesting
scene this afternoon, but they refrained
from taking a hand in it, so intensely were
they absorbed. Nutting was seen to-night,
but'he naively said that he preferred hav
ing no newspaper notoriety in connection
with it. Mrs. Walker threatened hi 3 arrest
for the embezzlement of her money.
A short time ago Nutting was arrested
for embezzlement, at the instance of a
client, but he was discharged at his pre
liminary examination

STRANGE TALE OF A LAWYER.
Confession Wrung From a Woman
About to Brin? Suit for a
Divorce.
PORTLAND, Or,, March 24.â A promi
nent lawyer to-day, disclosing that a hyp
notic club ha* been formed here, says:
''The club was formed, ostensibly, for
the purpose of amusement and to make
researches into the science, but its mission
has already taken a more serious trend.
You know this is leap year ana that in
the long year it is a maiden's privilege to
make proposals of marriage. I am in
formed that seve:i young women hypnot
ists have succeeded in inducing an equal
number of young men to accept them in
marriage, the ceremony to be performed
within the next few months, by exercising
their hypnotic power. 1 have the further
insurance that the seven young men
alluded to had not the remotest idea of
marrying those young men until they be
came spellbound" through the medium of
this mysterious influence. The girls no
sooner proposed than the men acquiesced.
These men will be held in the bondage
until the nuptial knot is tied and thenâ
they certainly can't be kept hypnotized
the rest of their lives.
"How I became cognizant of the exist
ence of this club is particularly curious.
J> bout a week ago a married woman, quite
well known here, but rather indiscreet,
called at my office to be^in divorce pro
ceedings. I had always believed that she
was one of the â¢ most happily married
women in town and her mission
struck me as being very strange.
Her grounds were infidelity, and I talked
with her for upward of an hour. During
our conversation the woman casually
dropped a few remarks about hypnotism,
and, detecting that it was a fad of hers, I
led her on until she unconsciously and in
discreetly took me into her confidence.
Before she left my office I knew as much
about the hypnotic club, of which she is a j
charter member, as Bhe does.
"This woman confessed to me that it
was she who influenced her husband to the
indiscreet act upon which she baÃed her
plan for a divorce. In addition she told
me, mentioning their names, that there
are nine other women in the club simi
larly scheming to rid themselves of what
they deem undesirable husbands, but who
in fact were exceptionally good men. I
talked my caller out of her notion under
penalty of public exposure.
"I fear that the perpetuation of this or
ganization and the exercise of its power
may in time shatter and ruin the entire
respectable social fabric of this city."
STOCKTON'S TINY WAIF
A Diminutive Stranger Takes
Up His Home With the
Wyatts.
Insists Upon Being Admitted and
Finds That It Has Fallen Into
Generous Hands.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 24. â Some
time between- 11 and 12 o'clock iast night
a baby a few days old was left at the door
step of a house at 221 Union street. The
dwelling is occupied by Mr. and Mrs.
Severy and Mr. and Mrs. Wyatt. About
midnight the little stranger made himself
beard. Mr. Wyatt heard cries aa those of
an infant, but could not imagine whence
they came. He listened for a few mo
ments and became satisfied that the cries
came from without the threshold of the
front door and he arose to investigate.
When he opened the door he found such
a sturdy and crowing youngster that the
finder is now almost as proud as a father.
Wyatt has no children, and he and his
wife are jubilant. The child had been
placed in a telescope basket. The basket
was about half filled with infant's clothes,
and there was in addition to that a can of
condensed milk and two bottles. Evidently
whoever placed the child there expected
that it would be well cared for.
It is apparently a very healthy babe, has
good lungs and a splendid appetite. When
the news of the affair spread through the
neighborhood there was much curiosity to
see the unclaimed waif who intruded him
self, so to speak, on the family. People
came and went nearly ali the forenoon.
The child is evidently not over six days
old. Mr. and Mrs. .Wyatt announce that
if the mother will convey to them the
exact age of the baby they will not ask
any questions but will proceed to legally
adopt it. They also say they will not
attempt to learn the identity of the

"Evidence of a Murder on the Stockton

STOCKTON, Cal., March 24.â The body
of a man supposed to be James Donley was
found floating in Stockton Channel to
day. Donley was a bachelor who had re
sided in the City Homestead for 'â _ several
years and was : reputed to : be worth con
siderable money. On his person was found
a Â»mall amount of money and some notes
and claims. Last Saturday he had a check

theory is that he was relieved -of most of
his money and then drowned, the robbers
leaving him enough money, as they sup
posed, to throw discredit upon the theory
of â¢â  foul play. There are no marks of vio

FLIGHT FROM GILROY.
Jeweler Harry Frutig Suddenly Departs
After Making an Assignment to
Creditors.
GILROY, Cal., March 24.â The town is
agog over the sudden flight of Harry
Frutig, a local jeweler, and his wife.
They left Gilroy Saturday morning and
their departure gave rise to no comment
at that time; but last evening John Lewis.
representing wholesale jewelers of Ean
Francisco arrived, and with D. W. Burch
ard, a San Jose attorney, took possession
of the store and began an inventory.
Frutig's debts amount to $3000. It is ex
pected that he left the country after mak
ing an assignment for the benefit of his
creditors. He was one of two bondsmen
for David Murdock, administrator of the
estate of his father, John Murdock, de
ceased. The estate is valued at $5000 and
consists chiefly of a stock ranch iv the
eastern foothills. David Murdock. acting
as administrator of the estate, authorized
his brother, William Murdock, to s^ll part
of the stock, amounting to about $300.
He then converted the balance into cash,
amounting to $1500, and when called upon
by the Probate Court for a final account
ing, failed to appear or comply with the
order of the court. His whereabouts is
unknown, he having left San Jose when
ordered by the court to appear. This left
his bondsmen, Frutig and D. S. Whitney,
responsible in the sum of $3000 each.
Frutig has been engaged in the jewelry
business in Gilroy for over fifteen years.
He bad many friends, was uenerons and
steady in his habits and had built up a
prosperous business. At the last munici
pal election he was nominated and made
a fine run for the office of County Treas
urer, but was defeated. He recently
cleared a mortgage on his homestead,
â which is in his wife's name.
BUDD ACCUSED AT FRESNO
Sensational Story Regarding an
Understanding With the
Octopus.
Charged With Having Caused a Con
ductor's Discharge by a Request
Sent to Headquarters.
FRESNO, Cal., March 24.â The latest
I issue of the Fresno Weekly Populist con
i tains a remarkable statement alleging a
, very intimate understanding between Gov
| ernor Budd and the management of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. The conductor
referred to is well known throughout the
San Joaquin Valley. The charge is as
follows:
"Governor Budd has a great many ene
mies and not a few friends, some of whom
are quite influential and in quarters usu-
I ally supposed to be antagonistic to that
I wily politician. The following apparently
reliable story, coming from a member of
I the Democratic State Central Committee,
would indicate that the Southern Pacific
and Governor Budd understand each
j other pretty well. It is to the effect that
I the railroad company did no less a favor
than discharge a reliable and trustsd em
ploye in order to please the Governor.
"Conductor Ben Korn. one of the most
popular railroad men on the coast, was
the unfortunate employe wno lost his
position through, it is claimed, a polite
request sent to the railroad headquarters
from the Governor. Conductor Korn had
a run between Goshen and Huron during
the campaign two years ago, and met the
Governor during his canvass of the State.
"The two had met before; in fact, had
quite an intimate acquaintance with each
other. Budd called out to Ben and asked
him if he was going to vote for him (Budd).
Ben answered, 'No; I know you to well.'
The Governor, it seems, did not soon for
get the reply, and after his election Korn
was discharged by the railroad. He was
given a high recommendation, and is now
railroading in the State of Washington."
BEREMTtA. ISCEHOIJiRiaU.
Ranch Employ* Accused of liettroying a
Retidence. .
MADERA, Cal., March 24.â Robert
Grainger was arrested yesterday upon
a complaint charging him with arson,
sworn to by John Dwyer, a rancher living
nearÃerenda. Sunday night Dwyer's house
which at the time was unoccupied, was
burned to the ground. Grainger is a
laborer who has worked around Madera
and vicinity for some time, and for the
past few weeks has been in the employ of
Dwyer. Dwyer discharged him from the
ranch on Sunday, and It seems that there
was a slight trouble between the men at
that time, and during the disagreement
Grainger threatened Dwyer that he would
get even with him.
Tbe peculiar circumstances connected
with the fire led the people to believe that
it was the work of an incendiary, and to
day the District Attorney visited the scene
and enough evidence was secured by the
officers to warrant Grainger's arrest.

SEATTLE, Wash., March 24.-H. G. C.
Thornton, a member of the much-discussed
Alaska party which left San Francisco on
the Excelsior under peculiar circum
stances some time ago, has cleared the
mystery, if there was one. The Excelsior,
crowd consists of persons representing a
syndicate of fifteen New York and Boston
capitalists, each worth, according to Thorn
ton, from $1,000,000 to $1n,000.000. The.
company is capitalized for $10,000,000, with
a paid-up capital of $300,000. The scheme
is to prospect and take up as much gold
and coal bearing land on Cooks Inlet 33
possible and to work it.
The Excelsior, which sailed from Seattle
several days ago, had 100 men, twenty-five
horses, ten giants, 250,000 feet of lumber
and the necessary machinery and equip
ments for quartz and placer mining, and
provisions for one year. While here the
Excelsior people purchased the old steam
er General Canby, and Thornton, whose
home is in New York City, remained to
superintend the overhauling of, and the
placing of new machinery in, the craft.
The Canby, which is to be used on Cooks
Inlet, will be commanded by Captain
Durfee of San Francisco, leaving .here for
Alaska the last of the week.
I A THE TUKOS COUXTRY.
Inexperienced Protpcctora Stake the
Hichfgt Strike of the Tear.
PORTLAND, Or., March 24. â Caspar
Ellinger of Circle City, Alaska, en route
for San Francisco, said this evening to a
Call correspondent :
"Do not go to Alaska unless you are
well suppiieu with money. The situation
at Juneau is strained. The steamer fate
war, with its reduction of fares to a pitch
where it was cheaper to travel than stay at
home, has served to till Juneau and Doug
las City with an element which already
has begun to make itself felt as a drag on
the merchants and employed men. The
streets swarm with idle, broken men, for
whom there is no work, yet who must be
fed. Should this class continue to in
crease at the rate shown during the past
two months, it will be necessary for the
people of Juneau in self-protection to
charter a steamer and send them back to
the Sound."
"How have the miners on the Yukon
prospered this season?" was asked.
"Better than ever before Known and
strangely, too, the new-comers have been
the most fortunate. Tais result, however,
was largely due to accident. For some
seasons past a company of old timers has
held claims back of a glacier in the hills
some sixty miles above Circle City. This
year these men determined to abandon
the glacier and not do any development
T'ork on the claims. Tuis came to the
ears of a party of four men just arrived in
the country from lowa and who knew as
much about a mine as a mule does of navi
gation ; but with the nerve that character
izes a greenhorn, during July they went
in on the glacier, with the result that they
are now returning with $75,000 among
them. The news of the strike spread on
the river and a majority of the new arri
vals immediately struck out for the glacier
diggings, all of them making money.
"I have been in Circle City three ypars
and have no cause for complaint. The
fact that I am going back so soon as I have
paid a visit to relatives attests that I hare
not been unsuccessful. To any man with
money sufficient to pay his way in and
out, providing he does not make a strike, I
would say, 'try Alaska,' providing he is
not doing well in this country ; but for any
others my earnest advice is, 'stay away.'
"Are the Indians in the interior of the
same race as those found on the coast?"
'No; they are in many respects differ
ent. Greatly resembling the Japanese,
thty are cleanly, and above all, the women
are chaste, the gross immorality of trie
coast Klootchmen being utterly unknown
among fhe Mum-a-latz, as the Yukon
Klootchrnen are known. Their villages are
far down the river toward the mouth, but
wherever a mining camp starts up they are
soon to be found, the women dome wash
ing and the men working as canoemen and
laborers."
AIDING A HIGHLAND PATIENT.
Attempt to Secure the Release of Judge
Huso on a Writ of Habeas
Corpus.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., March 24.â
An unusual case will soen come up in
the Superior Court in which an at
tempt is made to get a patient out of the
Insane Asylum at Highland on a writ of
habeas corpus. The patient is Judge
Charles E. Huse, who was once one of the
most prominent attorneys in Southern
California.
The man who is making the fieht for the
Judge's liberty is a Spanish gentleman â F..
F. Glardo, a lifelong friendâ who believes
that the once brilliant attorney is in the
asylum without cause.
Judge Huse was committed to Napa
from Santa Barbara in 1880. He was dis
charged in 1890 and immediately sent back
to Napa from San Francisco and trans
ferred to San Bernardino in 1834. where he
is ut present.
On July 4 last he delivered a very able
and patriotic address to the inmates at
Highland Asylum. Those in charge at
the asylum say he is not fit to be released,
but his friend will make the attempt to
morrow.

CORBETT AAH MITCHELL.
Offer of a Big Purse for a right in
London.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 24.â The
United Press' London dispatch of last
night announcing that Secretary George
Stevens of the Bolingbroke Club has offered
a purse of $12,000 for a fight between Cor
bett and Mitchell, to take place before that
club in London, wa3 confirmed by a cable
dispatch received yesterday by Richard K.
Fox from London, signed by George W.
Atkinson, editor of London Sporting Life.
The dispatch reads as follows:
London, March 23.
BoHnKbrokc Club offers $12,000 for Mitchell
and Corbett, with .fSOO expenses. Mitchell ac
cepts. Does Corbett? Atkinson.
Mr. Austin, sporting editor of the Police
Gazette,, commenting on the dispatch,
stated to a United Press reporter that the
club had evidently taken Fitzsimmons at
hi? word in his refusal to meet Corbett be
fore the club for a purse of $8000, and
would have nothing further to do with
Fitzsimmons because of the latter's per
emptory snd emphatic declination of the
club's offer.
Mr. Austin expressed some surprise at
the offer of such a large puree for a right
between Corbett and a man whom he so
easily defeated only a short time ago, and
could only account for it by the belief that
Mitchell still continues to be looked upon
as the leading English pugilist.

VICTIMS OF A PLOTTEK.
Hefense Set Up by the Lieutenant* of
Santa Teresa.
EL PASO, Tex., March 24.â A Hearing
was given to-day before United States
Commissioner Sexton to Senores Aguirre
of Batopilas and Chapa of Tamaulipas,
charged with inciting a rebellion against
the Mexican Government. The testimony
tended to show that one Pedro de Lima,
editor of a Spanish paper at Solomonville,
set up and struck off a proof containing a
pronunciamento, signed with alleged fic
titious names, calling for a restoration of
tli 6 Mexican constitution of 1857, and then
distributed the type.
It is alleged that Lima took this proof
to Governor Ahumada at Chihuahua, to
make him believe Lima was able to dis
close a deep plot against the Mexican Gov
ernment, ana got money from the Gov
ernor; that Lima then saddled the whole
business on to Aguirre and Chapa, who
were at the time interested in the Solomon
ville paper. His idea is alleged to have
been to mnke himseli solid with the Mexi
can Government, against which he is an
old offender.
The defense claimed the accused were
nothing more than friends of Santa Ter
esa, wtio has, in the last three years, been
creating disturbances in Northern Mexico.
Arizona and Texas, and whose fanatical
followers have been repeatedly shot down
by Mexican troops. The accused wanted
only to see that s. c had a fair show.
An attempt to transfer the case to No
pales or Solomonville will be resisted in the
United States court.

Aggregation.
PLANS FOR THE BIG MATCH.
No Decision as to tha Proposed
Cardinal Costume â Make -Up
of the Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 24.â The Stanford girls' basket-ball
team continues to practice although it is
somewhat disorganized by the absence of
Misses Kiefer and Merrit, who are away
on their vacation. Miss Walter has de
cided not to train, owing to her residence
in San Jose. Her place will be filled from
the members of the second team. Captain
McCray and the rest of the girls are keep
ing up their training under the careful su
pervision of Dr. Wood, their coach, and
Miss Mosher, the physical instructor.
Each girl takes the regular gymnasium
work and practices with the ball, en
deavoring to overcome her weak points.
The girls on the vacation trips have prom
ised to keep in good condition and to take
regular outdoor exercise and will be ready
for the last week's practice with the team.
As the game is to take place on a wooden
floor they are now practicing daily in
Encina pymnasiurn.
The girls have not yet decided to adopt
a costume of cardinal "bloomers," as was
suggested, but will wear tneir regular
gymnasium suits of dark material, with
cardinal Tarn O'Shanters. The entire
management of their affairs has been dele
gated by the executive committee to the
team and they control their own costumes
and finances.
"It is somewhat different playing on a
wooden floor," remarked one of the team
to-day. "You see, we have been used to
playing on the ground and the ball bounds
differently on a wooden floor, which makes
it harder to judge where it will bound.
Then we must be more careful of falls than
formerly and we can't play as liard.
"The ball, when it goes out of bounds
in a hall, Immediately rebounds and brings
itself into play, whereas formerly we used
to rush after it. Our held was about 125
by 80 feet in dimensions, and the ball never
rebounded after going outside. After the
girls return we shall practice ceam work
several times a day. and hope to be ready
ior the Berkeley game on April 4. '
The members of the team are: The
Misses Kiefer and Tucker, home; McCray,
captain; Merritt and Cobert, centers;
Ryan and Morley, guard.*. The plan at
t resent is to have the game with Berkeley
played in two halves of fifteen minutes
each, with ten minutes' intermission.

Mann have sweet voices and eood stage
presence. The chorus is large and well
selected. The performance promises to be
one of the most successful ever given by
amateur actors at Stanford.

Twisted, swollen, painful, weakening in its effects upon the
vital powers, the direct cause of thousands of cases of general
nervous exhaustion, debility and decay. This is Varicocele in
the veins of the vital parts. It is perhaps the most dangerous of
the many results of early indiscretions. It 'drains the vital pow-
ers in that slow, treacherous manner which leaves no sign 1 of its
terrible effect until, the awful work is done â until the whole
nerve force, the foundation of mental, physical and vital strength,
is undermined and manhood destroyed. Doctors have tried
every known means in their attempts to cure it, and have usually
given it up with the advice that it will not be a serious matter.
But this is only their way of excusing themselves for their help-
lessness. It is a: serious matter, as is proven by the thousands of
physical wrecks it has caused. But it can be cured by
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.

VIRGINIA CITY'S HOPE.
R. P. Keating'* Opinion of the Present
Mining Situation on the Great
Comitock Lode.
R. P. Keating, superintendent of the
Savage mine, Virginia City, Nev., is at the
Palace Hotel.
"The hope of the camp," he said, "is in
the Brunswick. It has a big fissure- vein â
something like the Comstock â and there
is cood reason why it may develop
enormous wealth also. It is estimated
that no less than $600,000,000 has been
taken out of the Comstock mines. Of
course there has been lots of barren
ground â places where no ore was found.
"I presume 300 men are probably all
that are now employed on the Comstock,.
whereas we used to have between 5000 and
6000 men.
"Our miners, though they get $4 a day
as wages, are so liberal in their expend
itures that they do not by any means get
rich. They buy stocks a good deaJ, and
sometimes a miner in this way will get to
be worth $50,000 or $100,000. Lots of them
up there have been, but they didn't let go
soon enough and are still working away
with pick and shovel. Others got out
with similar amounts and have settled
down. The miners earn all the money
they ever get. What they make by specu
lation they are entitled to and we "are all
glad to see them get it."
Mr. Keating is down for only a short
stay. He has been meeting many old
friends since his arrival.
TESTING RUSSIA* ARMOR.
An Unusual Compliment Paid to the
United State*.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 24.â A Sun
special from Washington says: The Rus
sian Government, through its legation in
Washington, has requested the Navy De
partment to conduct toe acceptance test
of a large quantity of first-class Harvey
ized steel armor, which it has purchased
in this country from the Carnegies for two
battle-shiDS recently authorized, and Sec
retary Herbert has notified the Minister
that the ordnance experts will undertake
the work at the Indian Head proving
grounds.
The courtesy extended to this Govern
ment is rather unnsuai, and was probably
never before allowed by one Government
to another. It is also regarded as a high
tribute to American ordnance that Russia
should be willing to allow American-made
rifles to test the resisting power of armor
plates which it proposes to place on some
of her best battle-snips.
The guns and armor will both be of do
mestic make, as will be the powder and all
the accessories of the trial, and except for
the presence of the Russian military and
naval attaches, who will take no active
part, the Russian Government will be un
represented at the trials. The report that
will be submitted through the Navy Depart
ment will be accepted by Russia as final
I and conclusive of the power or weakness
lof the new armor. " â¢ ;
; About one year ago Russia made a con
tract with the Bethlehem company for
1100 tons of heavy steel, such as is manu
factured for American war vessels, and the
trials which took place, both at Bethlehem,
where the company has a proving ground,
and abroad, showed that ' the plates
were of the highest i degree of excellence
and entirely acceptable to the authori
ties. â¢ .. , >â ".-- , ' . â : :â .
This armor is now being fitted on two
vessels under construction in Russia.' Re
cently, however, Russia" has entered '-into
a contract. with an American firm for an
other : large f amout of armor, the â â  deli v
eries of which : will begin â¢ immediately
after the acceptance trials.
â¢ <â  â¦ .
; In the year 1895 the value of the manu
factured silk imported to this country was
$31,206,202;. in the same year the value of
the unmanufactured which was brought to
this country was $22,626,055. &â¢ , i â¢

JOY S Powell and Market Sts.MARKET ST. ENTHUSIASTIC
One Day's Interviews About the
Great Home Remedy, Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
A Startling Unanimity of Opinion
Expressed by Many Leading
Merchants.
During an experience of five or six years
of continuous interviewing in this City,
with an idea to secure the most interesting
matter possible for publication in the
great daily papers. I have never come
across such an absolute consensus of
opinion as I found within an hour after
I had been detailed to secure opinions as
to the merits of Joy's Vegetable Sarsapar
illa. My instructions were plain and to
the pomt â to take at random any section
of any street not comprising more than
three or four blocks, and, without gome
from house to house, to interview as many
people as seemed necessary in order to be
able to form a fair judgment as to tde gen
eral opinion as to the various merits of
Joy'Â« Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Of course it is comparatively easy if you
have a pocketful of money and no con
science toget'all the indorsements that you
desire for almost anything if you know
where to go, but even then you have to be
careful. For instance, it would scarcely
be wise, without a larjre fee in your pocket
and having made due preparations for the
State penitentiary, to approach an expert
nssayer with a proposition for him to
indorse your sample of the gold brick
industry (if you had the indiscretion to
think that was a legitimate occupation),
nor wouid it be wise to go to the branch
United States Treasury and ask for an
opinion as to the perfection of any specific
make of "green goods," but given a few
dollars most of the hard-working and
poorer classes may at most times be in
duced to lend their names to the indorse
ment of something of which they know
little or nothing. They think it is harm
less and possibly doing the interviewer a
"good turn," as they call it. But here
was a very different proposition â viz., to
go on the City's principal thoroughfare
and to straightforwardly question a half
dozen or more people who are prominent
and well known for their integrity, reli
ability and general perspicuity.
The result of the queries must convey to
the mind of every unbiased man or woman
the fact that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
is all that it is cfaimed to be. It could not
be otherwise. In no single instance did
any one of the gentlemen interviewed
express the slightest doubt as to the value
of the remedy. Had one been inquiring as
to the safety "of investing in United States
gold bonds the gentlemen seen could
scarcely have more happily agreed. Indeed,
there was no dissenting voice, and as the
good book hath it, "In the mouth of many
witnesses shall the truth be established."
And now for the interviews:
WHAT MR. P. ROSENBfRG SAYS.
Strolling into the well-known gentle
men's furnishing goods store of Weill &
Beck, 940 Market street, I was courteously
received by Mr. P. R. Rosenburg, in the
absence of either of the partners.
"May I ask if you have ever used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla?" I queried.
"I have," he stated plainly.
"Would you mind giving me your opin
ion as to its merits?"
"It is certainly a very fine sarsaparilla;
it cleanses the blood and does not mar the
face with lines or anything of that sort.
"You know what I mean," he went on.
"Of course, it is possible to cleanse the
blood by weakening the system, but that
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparili'a does not do,
at least, it did not in my case. It has
been of exceptional benefit to me, and I
am pleased to indorse it."
"May 1 qviote you as say it? g this?" was
asked him.
"Why. certainly," replied Mr. Rosen
burg, "I never object to telling the truth
at any time."
Weill & Beck have a very high standing
in the commercial world, and it has been
their aim to select straightforward as well
as courteous employes, and to their envied
reputation in this particular much of their
success is doubtless due.
MR. H. O. STEARNS EXPRESSES HIMSELF
CLEARLY.
There are few of the fair sex who do not
know Mr. H. O. Steams of 1006 Market
street, whose candies and bonbons have
for so many years been the "proper" as
well as the nicest confections. He has
been fotthe past ten years in his present
place of Dusiness and has earned the con
fidence of every one who knows him.
When asked his opinion of Joy's Vege
table Sarsaparilla he said : "I don't know
of anything that I ever heard spoken of
so highly m my life, and my good opinion
of it does not rest on hearsay alone. I
use it in my own family and use it regu
larly. We keep it home because we never
know when one of the little ones may be
a little bit "under the weather." We find
that it invariably does good. Its action is
mild but always satisfactory.
"A lady who lived in my house," he
went on, "used Joy's Vegetable Sarsarilla
for quite a long time, and she always
spoke in the most glowing terms of what
it had done for her. She suffered, I
think, from dyspepsia more than any
thing else, but no matter whether my
memory is correct on that point or not, I
can assure you of this â that she would not
have been without Joy's Vegetable Sarsa
parilla, no matter what it might have cost
her. Luckily enough she was one of those
who could afford to have anything that
was good. " I spent a few minutes more
chatting with Mr. Steams, for he is a most
entertaining talker, as well as beirjg a be
liever in home industry. He is a worker
for the benefit of all Californians. There
is no question but that his candies com
pare more than favorably with any East
ern or foreign importation, and they are
all f-trictly home-made products.
JOHN A. KENNEDY IS EMPHATIC.
Nolan Bros, have recently opened a new
shoestore at 1024 Market street, and with
characteristic business sagacity they have
installed Mr. John A. Kennedy, who for ten
or more years was prominently identified
with Russell's shoehouse on Market street,
opposite Third. Mr. Kennedy is probably
oiie of the best-known shoe men in the
City. Straight as an arrow and of kindly
face, his Celtic eyes look at you with ah
air of most evident sincerity. Asked as
to the merits of Joy's Vegetable Sarsauar
iila he said : "I am lucky enough never to
have been ill myself. As to its merits, I
have had as clear proof as any rational
man could desire. Right here before my
own eyes I see at least two young men for
whom I know it has done lots of good. It
has purified their blood and put their sys
tems, so they tell me, into wnat I might
perhaps aptly describe as 'good working
order.' But these are not the only cases
that I know of by any means. I have
several friends who use it regularly, and,
whiie I don't wisn publicity of any nature,
if you ask me I can only tell you, that
should any one inouire of me as to the
merits of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla I
should be compelled, whether I wished to
or not, to say that I knew it to be a most
excellent tonic and blood purifier." And
then, with an easy courtesy, Mr. Kennedy
said : "May I introduce you to Mr. Ross,
a gentleman who is now in our employ,
and who has used the remedy of which
you ask me, and who will probably be able
to tell you more lucidly than I can just
how much it has done for him."
J. E. ROSS' GLORIOUS EXPERIENCE.
Mr. Kennedy called Mr. Ross, familiar
ily known ax "'Joe," and, introducing the
interviewer, he said, "Did Joy's Vegetable
Harsaparilia help you at all, Joe?"
â¢â¢'Veil,' 1 he replied, "I should say it
did."
"To tell you the truth," continued Mr,
Ross; as he turned to the interviewer, "I
can scarcely beiieve that there is a better
remedy than Joys Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
I Had dyspepsia, vrbich. bothered me ycry
much, and I scarcely looked for any
help for that trouble. I got the sar
saparilla to purify my blood, but imme
diately upon commencing to take it I
found that it helped mv dyspepsia won- j
derfully. Don't misunderstand me. The
relief was almost instantaneous, and as
far as the purification of my blood and the
loning up of my system generally was con
cerned the remedy did all and more than
all that I ever expected in my most san
guine moments. It braced me up. I got
rid of all that worried and tired feeling
that I had had and it made me feel as
bright and frisky as a young colt, if 1 may
use the expression."
Mr. Ross certainly did not seem to be
suffering very seriously when I inter
viewed him. He has a face which indi
cates clear determination and stability of
character, and that he will make a suc
cess, and probably a great one, as a shoe
man when the opportunity arrives there
can be but little doubt. In fact Mr. Ross
would make a success of anything he
undertook.
"PHIL" BELDNER KNOWS THE TRUTH.
There are few people in the City who
make friends more easily or who keep
them more constantly than does "Phil"
Seldner, the popular gentlemen's fnrnish
ing goods man of 1102 Market street. If
you were to ask "Phil," as they call him,
as to whether he had a better stock of
goods than anybody else in the City the
probabilities are that, with his becoming
modesty, he would say, "No, but just as
good as any one else." It is possible by
telling the "truth about his wares, his cor
rect style ties and his fashionable shirts,
that M*r. Seldner has managed to have and
to keep as good a connection as any one
on the coast.
"Will you please tell me if youhava ever
taken Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla?" was
asked him while I was standing outside
his store. 1102 Market street.
'I don't think I ever have," said Mr.
Seldner, "though it is kept in Â«ny house j
at all times. What makes you ask me?" j
"I want to gather the opinions of a few
people in this block on that ereat home
remedy," was the reply.
"I expect that I could give you as cor
rect an idea as to what people'*s opinions
are as you will rind anywhere in the
City," said Mr. Seldner. "'-The truth of
the matter is," said he, "that it is very
popular everywhere, and I am convinced
that its popularity is due to its merits.
You know you can get one or two people
to indorse almost any remedy, but I have
heard Joy's Vegetable" Sarsaparilla spoken
of so highly and so often that not only do
I keep it in my house, but were I ever to
feel that I needed a tonic or if 1 had dys
pepsia, or even if I suspected that my
liver was a little out of order, I should cer
tainly take Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
without hesitation.
"How many people have I heard speak
highly of it? That is a pretty difficult
question for me to answer. At least ten
or a dozen and possibly twenty. But you
can quote me as saving, that I never once
heard any one speak of it that did not in
dorse it 'most highly." And then, with
that camaradie for which "Phil" is so
noted, he said: "Now, I have given you
all the information that I can, and I hope
you will make no mistake in quoting it.
MR. J. G. M'DOSALD TALKS.
There are probably not twenty ladies
who do their own household buying in the
City who do not know Mr. McDonald's tea
and cracker store of 1120 Market street.
Mr. McDonald has been well known here
for a dozen years or more, and when I
asked him as to whether he took Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla he replied: "No, I
have had the good fortune not to require a
sarsaparilla, but if I had I should most
assuredly take Joy's. It has been highly
commended by a large number of people
and I have every reason to suppose it is
excellent. Of course every one knows that
sarsaparilla has earned a great reputation
as a general tonic and blood purifier, and
so far as the home remedy is concerned of
course I should prefer it always."
This was the final interview for the day
and one of t!ie pleasautest, but for that
matter they were all pleasant. There was
no desire except to get at the truth as to
what tbe popular opinion was about the
great home remedy, and this first day left
little to be desired if a complete indorse
ment of it was the thing wished. California
has made a reputation among her sister
States for the wonders that she has pro
duced from her soil, and though gold pos
sibly has been most sought after it is still
doubtful as to whether it is the one which
has done most good for the world. Joy's
Rarsaparilla is a purely vegetable prepara
tion, and all of its ingredients are pro
duced in California. It is true that that
may not be to some people an exception
ally strong argument in its favor, but
when it has so eminently proved its supe
riority to every other sarsaparilla on
the market, when it has been demon
strated beyond a shadow of a question
that it contains no iodides; when it has
been shown as clearly as the X rays show
the interior of man that it produces no
pimples, nor does it mar either the face or
body in any way ; that it actually is the
best tonic, blood-purifier and system
builder on earth, it may readily be claimed
that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is a
product of California soil which will do
tor mankind what gold never could do,
namely : Give him perfect health.

EXPLORER H. DE WINDT.
He Has Arrived From London
on His Way to Alaska
and Siberia.
Differs Radically From Kennan in
the Treatment of Russian
Convicts.
Harry de Windt of London, an explorer
and correspondent of the Pall Mall
Gazette, who has written many books,
arrived here yesterday on the San Bias,
and is at the Palace. .
V He is en route to penetrate some ; of the
wilds of Alaska, and returning ; will ex
plore portions of Siberia, going finally to
Irkutsk. Mr. de Windt has been in Siberia
three times hitherto, and has visited many
of the noted prisons and convict settle
ments. He differs radically from George
Kennan in his views 'of the \ treatment of
these prisoners. According to : Mr. de
Windt, the Russian convict â¢ has about the
best time possible to imagine. Usually he
works or not, as he desires, and; if he does
work he is paid for it. He has leisure, and
can talk and smoke, something unheard of
in English prisons.
Finally Mr. de Windt : is of the opinion
that of all the hard citizens he ever met,
the i Russian convicts : as - a class : are \ the
worst. Gentlemen ; who have committed
murder and other somewhat similar in
discretions ; may be found in goodly num
bers in and about ', the penal ; settlements,
and it is about all a man's life is worth to
fall into their bands in byplaces. ; . . ;:
Mr. de Windt for a long time was con
nected with the London Graphic as well as
the Pall Mall Gazette. He has traveled up
some of J. the great ' rivers "of ?. China, into
India, Russia ami many : ' other countries,
going by the â¢: methods prevalent in each.
He has been traveling nearly all his life. .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
SAVANNAH BANK ROBBERS
Frank Williams, One of the Men
Wanted, Arrested on a
Train.
HE GAVE DR. LEE THE BONDS.
Important Discovery Made in Lough
ridge's Trunk of a Box Filled
With Rare Coins.
An important discovery has been made
which the police think will prove beyond
a doubt William Lougbridge's complicity
in the robbery of the Statr Bank at Savan
nah, Mo.
Detectives Whitaker and Reynolds on
Monday night searched Loughridge's
room in the house on Devisadero street,
where he had been living. They broke
open a trunk and found a tin box tilled
with rare coins, which was taken from the
bank vault at the time of the robbery.
Among the coins was a 50-cent piece
coined by the Confederate States.
The box and its contents were taken to
Captain Lees, as also a bundle of letters
which are said to throw considerable light
upon the movements of the gang since
the burglary. So pleased was the captain
at the find that he caused Loughridge to
be registered at the City Prison as a fugi
tive from justice.
Loughridge was taken before Judge
Campbell yesterday to answer the charge
of carrying a concealed weapon. At the
request of Carroll Cook, his attorney, the
case went over till to-day bail being fixed
at $1000.
The argument on the writ of habeas
Two of the Conspicuous Figures in the Savannah (Ga-) Bank Robbery.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
corpus for Loughridge's release was con
tinued by Judge Slack yesterday till to
morrow morning, and it is expected by
that time an officer will be here from
Kansas City with the necessary papers for
his extradition.
The prisoner's bonds were fixed at
$25,000. It was argued by Carroll Cook
that the complaint upon which the pris
oner was detained was invalid for the rea
son that it was verified upon "information
and belief." The Judge asked him to pre
sent authorities to support his contention
to-morrow.
An important capture was made by the
police last evening, and Captain Lees now
has in the "tanks the man who cave Dr.
Benjamin B. Lee the bunds to negotiate.
His name is Frank Williams, a n.an with
an Eastern reputation.
On Thursday Loughridge gave to Wil
liams the two stolen bonds now in the pos
session of the police. Williams went to
A. T. Johns, the stockbroker, that day and
attempted to negotiate the bonds, but did
not succeed. Williams went to Dr. Lee
on Friday and got him to try his hand at
negotiating the bonds at the Market
street Bank, but he failed. Lee returned
the bonds to Williams and Williams gave
them back aeain to Lee, who went on
Saturday again with them to the Market
street Bank as arranged between the bank
officials and Captain Lees.
Williams was waiting in the office of
Mr. Johns, the stockbroker, on Market
street, for Lees' return. Captain Lees sent
word to Mr. Jonns' son to come to police
headquarters, and Detectives Whitaker,
Sergeant Colby and a policeman were sent
to arrest Williams. But they were too
late. Williams, evidently suspecting that
something was wrong, made an excuse to
go to tne toilet-room, and when the officers
arrived he had twenty minutes' start.
Captain Lees ascertained that Williams
had gone to Red Bluff and thence to Sac
ramento. The captain had reason to be
lieve that Williams would come here to
take the Southern train for New Orleans,
and he detailed Detectives Gibson and
Wren to watch every incoming train for
him.
Williams reached the Oakland mole by
the 4 :30 p. m. train yesterday from Stock
ton and was promptly ar. asted by Gibson
and Wren and taken across the bay to po
lice headquarters.
Williams is a "crook" of 'long standing.
He has been, off and on, for the past two
or three years. He was a comrade of the
notorious pickpocket, Larry King. About
two years ago Williams was stabbed in the
Del Monte saloon, and Jay in the Receiv
ing Hospital for some time before he fully
recovered. He steadfastly refused to say
who cut him, but it was supposed to have
been another criminal, who had a grudge
against him.
Williams was arrested in Portland in De
cember, 1893, for bunko business and gave
the name of P. Donahue.
"Williams was the man," said Captain
Lees last night, "who gave the bonds to
Dr. Lee. Leo says he did not know Wu
liams, who was introduced to him as Mr.
Jones. From the description I got of
Jones irom two or three people I concluded
that he was Williams, who is from Denver
and must have known Loughridge there."
The captain feels satisfied of the identity
of "Red" O'Brien, one of the other men
implicated in the Savannah bauk robbery.
When here he was known as James Kane,
alias "Red" Kane. On February 19. 1889,
he was arrested with Harry Hunter for
picking pockets'. He is also a Denver man.
"1 have now," said the captain, "two
men under arrest (Lougbridgo and Wii
liams) and Dr. Lee is detained. No other
men are under arrest."
ITALIAN CARPENTERS.
They Perfected a Strong Labor
Union Last Night in
Apollo Hall.
About sixty persons were present at
Apollo Hall, 810 Pacific street, last even
ing for the purpose of forming an Italian
carpenters' union. The meeting was
1 called to order by C. F. Bhadt, organizer
for the carpenters' unions, who briefly
stated the purpose of the meeting and
then called upon J. Macconeo to explain
things to the satisfaction of the Italian
contingent.
The latter explained at some length the
benefits to be derived from a union, and
drew an object lesson from the strike of
six years ago, when the unions forced the
contractors to pay the old wage of $3 50 a
day.
Emanuel Picasso followed with a plea
for all to enter, stating that in unity and
harmony is strength. He was prompted
|at intervals by A. Serafini, editor of La
Voce del Popolo.
Macconeo was elected chairman pro tem
pore and V. Maggio secretary. Twenty
rive names were placed on the list, and a
fund for expenses was started by J. T.
Gomo preparatory to sending to Philadel
phia for a charter.
The next meeting will be held Friday
evening at the same piace.
WILL INTEREST CAPITAL
The South San Francisco Pottery
in a Fair Way to Open
Its Doors.
Steiger Brothers Have Found a Way
Out of Their Financial Dif
ficulties.
The financial troubles of Steiger Brothers,
owners of the South San Francisco Pot
tery, seem in a fair way to be speedily ad
justed, and there is every prospect that
the establishment will shortly open its
doors and run full blast, at least until con
tracts amounting to several hundred thou
sands of dollars are completed.
The matter started through a San Jose
bank that held heavy mortgages on the
concern threatening to foreclose. For
some time past the firm has had difficulty
in fact it failed, in collecting the amounts
due on several large contracts, and as a
consequence was short in ready cash to
pay off its large force of men. Hearing of
the threats of the bank the employes de
cided to attach to protect themselves, and
several small claims were filed against the
plant, which is valued at $75,000.
Seeing prospects of getting out of their
difficulties by closing down and devoting
all their energies to arranging their affairs
this course was adopted.
Since the pottery was closed the mem
bers of the firm have been in consultation
with several men of means and influence
who have been so impressed by the show
ing made that they have about decided to
back the concern to carry it through its
temporary troublts and enable it to till its
contracts. The funds coming in from
these contracts will place the firm on a
sound financial basis.
"As a matter of fact," said Louis Steiger,
the resident member of the firm, yester
day, ' 'some of our heaviest creditors have
expressed confidence in our ability to pull
out all right and have refused to crowd us.
It was the crowding of the bank
that urged our workmen on to at
tach, though I believe that only
$260 in claims have been actually
filed. We will soon have sufficient back
ing to start the pottery and carry out
$300,000 to $400,000 in contracts tdat are
now on band, and this money will enable
us to pay off our most pressing debts and
get into calm waters again.
"In regard to the sewer pipe that was
condemned, I can say that it did not come
from the South San Francisco pottery, but
was old stock from San Jose. It was good
pipe when it left San Jose, but was cracked
in transportation. The product of the
present plant is as good as is turned out
anywhere in California. We had trouble
with refractory clays when we first opened
the new plant, but this was soon over
come, and any contractor will testify that
for months past we have been turning out
first-class pipe."
HARD ON THE BOYS.
Two Arrested for Violating the 8
O'clock Ordinance.
R. Schappiro, a newsboy, 13 years of age,
living at 1043 Folsom street, and Joseph
Denio, 15 years of age, were arrested about
9 o'clock last night at Market and Powell
streets by Policemen M. F. Joy and J.
Maloney. They were charged at the City
Prison with violating the 8 o'clock ordi
nance.
Schappiro had a few evenine papers to
sell, which he carried with him to the
prison. Denlo is employed in Jackson's
iron works on First street. He and an
other boy got a transfer from a Powell
street car to a Market-street car on their
way home, and seeing a crowd on the
corner tney went over to see what was the
matter. Just then the policemen grabbed
Denio.
North Beach Fight.
Henry Duenwald, a carpenter living on
Beach street, and William Evans, a
laborer, living at 402 Bay street, were
taken to the Receiving Hospital yester
day. Duenwald had a fractured skull and
Evans a wound on his scaip. Evans
said that, while in a saloon on Beach
street, Duenwald and two others attempted
to rob him. Duenwald said that, while
sitting in his cabin, Sidney Brannan, a
Mission "tough," and two others assaulted
him, one cf them striking him over the
bead with a hatchet. Both, have been
charged with, assault to murder.
BAND MUSICIANS AT WAR
Union Men Object to the Pre
sidio Band Playing at
Sutro Baths.
THE MAYOR NON-COMMITTAL.
A Protest May Be Sent Through Con.
gressman Maguire to the Secre
tary of War.
Washington is a long way off, but the
members of the Musicians' Mutual Pro
tective Union, in common with other
American citizens, seem to look to the Na
tion's capital for the aid which they con
sider their just due.
It appears that his Honor the Mayor has
engaged the Presidio band to play at his
baths. This does not suit the Musicians'
Union. The union men have set a rate,
and any one of them who plays for a fee
below that figure does so at the peril of in
curring the union's displeasure. It is
alleged that the Piesidio band, receiving
already a salary from the Government,
and being in no actual need of extra gains,
has contarcted with the Mayor to play in
the Sutro Baths at less than the estab
lished union fees. Hence the trouble.
A private meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Musicians' Union was held
yesterday afternoon at the union's head
quarters, President Kent occupying the
chair. Several of the members of the
committee were loud in their denuncia
tion of the Mayor, and would have recom
mended violent measures. However, it
was reported that the Mayor had already
made arrangements for the engagement of
union musicians. No one present was able
to cite any reliable authority in support
of the rumors, out as it had been heard by
more than one of the members of the
executive committee it was decided to
defer any action until after further devel
opments. The matter will, however, be
presented for consideration at Friday's
meeting of the Labor Council.
The members of the union are deter
mined to find out what the Mayor intends
to do in the matter. His Honor is very
reticent and did not seem desirous of
stating his position when questioned on
the matter yesterday.
In case the Presidio band is retained in
the Mayor's employ the union intends ad
dressing the Secretary of War, through
Congressman Alaguire, asking the Secre
tary to intervene and prevent the engage
ment of the Presidio band in competition
with the union musicians. The musicians
are resolved to fight the issue to the end
in the event that the Mayor refuses to
change the present regime. The outcome
of the affair is looked for with some inter
est by all the labor unions.
Sued the Western Union.
Henry Rohner Jr. has sued the Western
Union Telegraph Company for $15,000 dam
ages and the case is being heard in the United
States District Court. On March 29, 1895,
while the complainant wad driving a band of
steers from Fortuna to Ferndale, in Humboldt
County, he collided with a guy wire of the
company in question and sustained serious in
juries. Thus the suit for damages.
Suicide of a Fireman,
Last Saturday night a sick fireman from the
Zealandia, on his way to this port on board
the steamship San Bias, was lost overboard at
sea. During the night he was missed from his
bunk and no one knows how or where he went
into the heft. It is believed that he committed
suicide as he was 111 and despondent. He was
known as Nicholas aboard the San Bias and
was a native of Russia.

LOCAL DEMOCEACY.
The condition of affairs in tbe Demo
cratic party in this City affords a striking
example of the complete demoralization
which affects the party throughout the
Union. From what is going on here it can
be seen that the better element of the
party has so completely lost nope as to
feel no interest in the approaching cam
paign, and have abandoned the control of
the party organization to faction leaders,
spoil hunters and ward bosse?.
Of San Francisco Democracy nothing
is snowing any activity this year save two
factions, one managed by office-holders
and the other by fellows who wish to be
office-holders. At the head of one faction
Rainey is conspicuous, mating a hard
right for a victory that will leave him the
undisputed boss of his party in this City.
Back of the other faction, hiding in such
obscurity as he can find for himself, is the
old boss, Buckley, seeking to retain power
and hoping for the day when he can come
from retirement and show himself again
to hia lienchmen with all his old time
prestige and swagger.
The only choice before the Democrats of
the City under these circumstances is to
bolt the party or accept the domination of
either Buckley or Rainey. To Democrats
of independent minds the choice will be
easy. They will *erve neither of the bosses,
nor will they vote for the men whom tbe
bosses put up. To stalwart Democrats
who stick to their party, even if it nomi
nates a yellow dog, tne v choiee is not going
to be so easy. Rainey nas not the evil
feme of Buckley, but then he served the
old boss when the boss was in power and
learned politics from him. Rainey evi
dently, therefore, is fighting Buckley only
that he may practice Buckleyism himself.
The difference between the two is a mere
matter of personalities, and there is no
reason why even a ward politician should
fight for one against the other unless he
sees something in it for himself.
The Rainey crowd began by shouting for
reform and straight politics, but before
the State Committee they got their work
through by a series of juggles that made
even the adroit Buckleyites themselves
grasp and stare in breathless surprise.
Now that they have recovered breath they
have begun to claw the sheep's clothing
off the Rainey gang and to reveal them to
be wolves of the same breed as themselves.
That is the condition of affairs at present,
and the Democrats, confronted by Buckley
on one side and Rainey on the other, are
called upon to answer, "Under which
king, Bczonian ? Speak or die !"
A STARTLING DECISION.
The Supreme Court of the United States
has at last placed the Interstate Commerce
Commission in a position to ascertain the
truth with regard to the shady transac
tions of railroad companies by sustaining
the act of 1893, which provides that a plea
of self-incrimination shall not be a bar to
testimony and that persona so testifying
shall not thereby come under the opera
tion of the criminal statutes. The decision
marks so radical a modification of ancient
precedents and in so doing recognizes so
serious an evil that cannot be reached by
ordinary processes that it deserves some at
tention.
The theory of the act of 1893 was that a
special order of crimes had come into ex
istence as the product of a new kind of re
lation between the perpetrator and the
people, and that it was of greater impor
tance to ascertain the truth and stop the
evil than to punish the perpetrator. The
term '"crimes" is here used merely in a
technical sense. The practices which the
provisions of the interstate commerce act
were intended to prevent by making them
criminal were simply sharp business acts
which operated injuriously between per
sons or communities. In the extreme ap
plication of these practices it was within
the power of railroad companies to ruin
one individual or community and upbuild
another. In a final analysis it is evident
that this power is exceedingly dangerous
as the people of California have abundant
reason to know from bitter experience.
This decision enlarges the power of the
Interstate Commerce Commission to an
amazing extent. It will be remembered
that the investigations of the Pattison
committee into the condition of railway
affairs in California were checked at the
critical points where they began to uncover
criminal practices, and that the whole
story of how the Government bad been
swindled was never told. That part of it
which did come into existence was bad
enough, and, judging from it, the entire
truth must be darker. The precedent es
taolished by the act of 1893 and by the
Supreme Court decision sustaining it will
undoubtedly be extended. Its operation
will not be coufined to the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
The whole tendency of the National
Government is to lay a firmer hand on the
powerful corporations and associated cor
porations that are assuming to take tbe
destiny of the country into their own
hand-. This is well, and considerably
more may be safely done in that direction
before sufficient is accomplished. The
only danger is that the tendency may pro
ceed too far and assail vested rights. That,
though only a remote contingency at
present, is something that cool-headed
citizens would do well to keep in mind and
be prepared to resist.
THE POOLEOOMS DEAD.
Judge Low's decision that the pretense
of the downtown poolrooms to serve as
agents for outside bettors on horseraces
was a mere evasion of the Ellert ordinance
is a clear, simple and straightforward
statement supported by. logic and an
evident desire to be fair. This ruling trips
the last prop upon which the poolroom*
were supported. It is not easy to see how
the managers, reading this decision along
with the last one rendered by Judge Wal
lace, can hope to continue their business.
With the Police Department, the law, the
courts and the better sentiment of the
community arrayed against them their
case seems to be hopeless.
This is matter for sincere congratulation.
While the policy of the State is not to pro
hibit betting on horseracing, it is opposed
to low forms of the practice, and the City
ordinances carry out that idea by restrict
ing the betting to the racing-tracks. These
ere not in tbe heart of the City. Entrance
to them requires the payment of a fee and
expense in reaching them. Under these
circumstances they are the resort only of
those who have leisure and money for the
pastime. Thus conducted horseracing is
decorous and serves to encourage the
breeding of fine horses. Under that stim
ulus the horse-breeding industry has be
come a leading one in California and has
given the State a fame tnat operates to its
benefit.
The Ellert ordinance was intended to
perfect the scheme contemplated by tne
State laws. It expressly prohibited bet
ting establishments of the downtown pool
room order. These establishments were
mereljr a lure for boys and clerks, a? the
smallest amounts were permitted to be
staked. The effect was of the most de
grading kind. The establishments wera
manufactories of young thieves and em<
bezzlera. After the racetrack managers
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
haa resorted to every possible means for
preventing the downtown rooms from
securing information upon which bets
might be posted, the poolrooms posted
fictitious entries and odds and thus placed
themselves on an exact level with the
bucket-shops which have been tabooed in
every city in the country. The termina
tion which they have finally reached in
Judge Low's court was inevitable, but
meanwhile the hard fight that was neces
sary to secure that result has placed the
City in an unpleasant light before the
country. This will be obliterated in time
if every tendency to a recurrence of the
evil is promptly suppressed.
COLLECTING THE MAILS.
First Assistant Postmaster-General JoneÃ
announces that San Francisco is one of
twenty-five cities in which tbe experiment
of making house-to-house collections of
mail is to be tried. It is difficult to see
why so many cities are chosen. One would
seem sufficient. If the experiment prove
a failure a great deal of time and money
will have been expended for nothing, for
its success will depend on the number of
collection boxes which residents may buy
or rent, and this necessarily will be a mat
ter of slow growth. If outright purchase
of the boxes is required and tbe experi
ment then abandoned tbe purchasers will
have lost the money they invested. It is
not to be denied that the opportunity for
a possible inventor of boxes will be allur
ing.
It is difficult to see how the collections
can be made from so greatly increased a
number of boxes without increasing the
force of postmen. This will entail an ad
ditional heavy expense on the Postoffice
Department. It would seem to be much
more advisable to reduce the rate of post
age and keep to the present facilities for
distribution and collection than to make
a continuance of the present rates neces
sary by increasing the expenses of the de
partment in experiments concerning which
there Is so much uncertainty . Tbe post
office authorities of "Washington City,
where the experiment is already on trial,
declare that the scheme is a failure there.
If so, it is hard to understand why it
should be tried elsewhere.
The number of street collection boxeÃ
distributed throughout the cities is suffi
cient to afford great convenience. If this
is not the case the number might be in
creased without increasing the running
expenses of the department, and thus pro
vide tbe convenience which house boxes
are intended to serve. As tbe difficulty in
the way of reducing the postal rate is the
annual heavy deficit of the Postoffice DeÂ«
partment, it seems a strange sort of busi
ness sense which prompts an increase of
the deficit by furnishing a questionable
convenience.
EATES THAT WILL CINOH.
In the proposition of the Transconti
nental Traffic Association to pay to the
carriers interested in the Panama route a
subsidy of $72,500 per month lies a threat
to tax the shippers of the country to an
inordinate extent, as will be readily seen
by a little study of the present situation
and certain figures in connection there
with.
For the past three months the eastbound
freight via Panama has not exceeded 1000
tons, and, at a liberal estimate -has averÂ«
aged about $10 per ton. The westbound
business has averaged about 1800 tons per
month for the same period, or a total of
5400 tons, at about $15 a ton. Thus we
have an aggregate of 6400 tons of freight
moved in three months, which returned a
gross revenue of $91,000. Under the pro
posed subsidy tbe carriers now engaged in
the Panama route business â the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company and the Panama
Railroad Company â will receive tor a simi
lar period, irrespective of what freight they
may carry, $227,500, or just two and a half
times as much as they have been earning.
But the carrying out of this plan of the
Transcontinental Association signifies
much more than that the shippers are to
be taxed to pay this subsidy to the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company and the Panama
Railroad Company. It means that every
merchant who has need to ship a pound of
freight over any of the transcontinental
lines is to contribute much more largely to
the revenues of these lines than hereto
fore, not only that tnis subsidy may be
paid, but that the roads which are re
sponsible for it may make a profit that will
justify them in Its payment. In other
words, it means that there will be a decided
advance in rates all along the line, with a
corresponding heavier burden upon com
merce. _____________
SUNSHINE LAND.
They came in sight of a lovely shore.
Yellow as gold in tbe morning light;
The sun's own color at noon it wore,
Aod had faded not at the fall of night;
Clear weather or cloudyâ 'twa* all as one.
The happy hills seemed bathea wltn the sun;
Its secret the sailors could not nnderstand,
But they called the country sunshine Land.
What was the sporet? A simple thing-
It will make you snaHe when once you know-
Touched by tbe tender finger of spring,
A million blossoms were all aglow;
Ho many, bo many, so small and bright,
They covered the hills with a mantle of light;
And the wild bee hummed, and the glad breeze
fanned
Through the honeyed fields of Sunshine Land.
If over the sea we two were bound,
What port, dear child, would we choose for oun?
We would sail and sail till at last we found
This fairy gold of a million flowers;
Yet, darling, we'd find, if at home we stayed,
Of many small joys our pleasures are made;
More near tnan we thinkâ very close at hand,
Lie the golden fields of Sunshine Land.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
1 Senator S. R. Buford of Virginia City, Mont.,
the famous raining camp on Alder Creek,
â where the notorious border outlaw Slade was
hanged years ago, is at the Lick. Mark Twain,
in "Roughing It," has told in characteristic
â way of the awful career and death of Slade.
and how he first met him when coming to Car
son ou the overland stage. Virginia City (the
one on Alder Creek) wag then a seething mael
strom of life.
"In those day. it had 20,000 people," said
Senator Buford yesterday, "and to-day it has
no more than 1000. It is what you might call
a decayed camp. Yet no district on earth, it is
estimated, has produced so much gold for its
length. The length of Alder Gulch is only fif
teen miles, yet it has produced, from the time
it was discovered until now, no less than
$100,000,000 in gold. This is a fabulous pro-
SENATOR S. K. BUFORD OF MONTANA.
duct. The amount cannot be determined ex
actly, for records were not always kept of the
shipments. But as near as can be estimated
the product has reached that sum. This is a
greater quantity than any other region of the
globe has produced.
"I went to Virginia City in 1865. For a long
time I freighted goods from Fort Benton, the
head of navigation on the Missouri River, to
various places in Montana, and afterward I
freighted from Corinne, Utah, to different
places. I used oxen and mule teams, and
sometimes had as many as three or four wagons
fastened together. It was a pretty stern life,
and I was glad when the railroadi got closer
and I finally quit it.
"When Slade was hanged at Virginia City
â¢Clubfoot' George and three or four others
were hanged with him. Shootings were fre
quent, and the camp was scarcely ever with
out its tragedy. It is entirely different now,
being one of the most peaceable places in the
country."
Virginia City is in Madison County, sixty
miles from the junction of the Little Missouri,
Madison and Jefferson rivers, and fifty miles
from Dillon. Senator Buford is engaged ex
tensively in merchandising there and else
where. He is also owner of extensive cattle
interests, and l.Â« altogether one of the solid
men of the new State. He was a member of the
constitutional convention, and has been
elected twice as Senator. He is a very pleasant
gentleman, and is an interesting talker. He
says thouarh little snow has fallen in Montana
this winter, yet he thinks there will be an
abundance of water and grass, and conse
quently plenty of beef.
"The March blizzard helped us out a great
deal." he said. "If it hadn't been for that we
would have been in rather bad shape. As it is,
we will come out all right."
Senator Buford has been troubled with
rheumatism, and has been trying to get rid of
it at Paso Robles. He says he has been much
benetttted by the California climate and the
springs combined.
AN ATTRACTIVE COSTUME.
The belted basque is tbe latest development
of the blouse effect. This has a circular basque
added and may bo trimmed In a variety of
ways at the top. The sailor collar with rever
fronts is shown here, being one o! the best
liked modeis.
The new plaid, striped and embroidered ba
tistes are being made up into such waists with
very good results; as one seen, which was
worn with collar and a narrow ribbon belt of
turquoise blue satin ribbon, matching one of
the stripe* of several colors which made the
plaid.
Mohairs are made in this way. A plain
brown one was worn with a narrow white
leather belt, the crush collar being of Dresden
ribbon with a white ground.
Cheviot, tweed, and in fact all the fabrics of
wool, are charming made up after this model
and will be much in evidence as soon as outer
wraps are laid aside. Tbe first spring days
will show a vast number of these becoming
waists.
They are made over a fitted lining, the out
side being seamless. The basque or peplurn is
cut separate, in circular shape.
Should Be Unforced.
Los Angeles Express.
There if a law which forbids the promiscuous
selling of morphine, cocaine and similar drugs,
but it seems to be largely a dead letter. It
â¢hould be rigorously enforced, and some of
the good people who are trying to suppress
the drinktraflic will flud in its enforcement a
fertile field for their energies that will do as
much good if they succeed as if they suc
ceeded in closing tne saloons.
PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT.
Victor Hugo, who, like Lord Tennyson, at
tained the age of 83 years, had personal estate
in England to the amount of Â£5057. Matthew
Arnold's estate amounted to Â£1041. Robert

T. Palgrave were the attesting witnesses, left
personalty in England of the value of Â£1U,777.

Chicago and Calve hates London. "No, no,
no," says the famous impersonator of Ctinm-n,
."not for the crown of England and all the
wealth the country contains would I consent
to live in London. Ten times rather â¢would I
be a peasant, with a little cottage on the slope
of the Apennines and the beautiful sunshine
of Italy all about me."
Mme. Jules Favre, widow of the French
statesman who, in 1871, declared that France

had been very successful [as a teacher and ex

There are so many different nationalities in

rather indefinite. If you refer to the native
sons and native c daughters, it 4 may be
said that they are, as a rule, above the average ,
height, ; but whether " the women are taller
than the men is impossible to say, for the ]
reason that there are -no â  figures or Bets of j
figures upon which to base an opinion. - 1

* The Rothschildsâ B. 8. , Calistoga, Cal. I The
founder of the house of Rothschild was Meyer
Amschel, or Anselm, who was born ; at 148
Judengasse (Jew Lane), in Frankfurt, in 7 1743.
In 1772 he began , business as a money-lender
and dealer in old coins \in the house lin which
he was born, and placed over '. the door as a
sign a red shield (Rothschild). Having * had
business with the Landgrave (elector) of Hesse
that :>. individual ' intrusted - him with <j his
treasure, . $1,025,000, 'in 1806, when the
French held that country. With this sum as a
capital Meyer traded and made a large fortune.
He restored the money to the Landgrave.'. Upon
his death his five sons continued the business
as partners, and each of 1 these < was created a
baron of the ; empire of Austria. The elder
Mayer, who was born In 1773 and died in 1853
succeeded as the head of the firm.
; Belligerent Rightsâ L. C. M,, Oakland, Cal.
The ; occasion for the accordance of belligerent
rights arises when a civil conflict exists within
a ? foreign State. The ? reason I which requires
and can alone justify this step by the Govern
ment of another country is that its own rights
and Interests are so far affected as to require a
definition of I its own | relations to the parties,
where a parent Government is seeking to sub
due an â  insurrection \ by municipal : force and
the insurgents " claim a political â¢ nationality
and belligerent rights, which the parent Gov
ernment does not concede, a recognition by a
fore gn State :of full belligerent rights, if not
justified sby necessity, is 1 a gratuitous demon
stration of moral support to the rebellion and
of censure of the parent Government. But the
situation â of r a foreign - State with B reference
to v the ; : contests and -Â the W conditions of
affairs between the 1 contending parties
may : be such ;ast to justify - this act. \if the
(i K State f. accord full belligerent" rights ' to
the Cubans it : means that the power that i*
seeking to put down the rebellion must treat
the Cubans as a belligerent 'force and accord
ing to the customs of war, and that the United
States will see such rights enforced 'The-a^

THE NEW FIRM OF
RAINEY AND CO
Rainey, Kelly and Mahoney
Have Formed a Con
solidation.
WILL PLAY THE "PUSH."
Sam Will Help Martin and Jerry
if They Get Up a Little
Primary.
A STABLEMAN'S RISING POWER.
The Boss of the Democratic Junta
Makes a Deal in Republican
Politics.
Sam Raincy has formed a political part
nership with Martin Kelly and Senator
Jerry Ma,honey.
This trinity of o.'d friends, which has
played both ends against the middle in
San Francisco politics before, is now lying
low and figuring. Martin Kelly is fre
quently about the Bush-street stables, and
Mahoney drops into the Reception saloon
occasionally to meet Rainey in a back
room.
Kelly and Mahoney declare that they
will run a rival primary in the Fourth
District for the selection of delegates to
the State Convention, a. id it is &aid that it
is to be held on the same day as the regu
lar primary soon to be called by the
county committee. People who tafce an
interest in current Republican local .iffairs
have been wondering what the Mahoney-
Kelly combination even hoped to accom
plish* with the Republican organization
and the great majority of the party in the
Fourth District arrayed against them.
They are counting* on Sam Rainey and
the Fire Department push to help them
make a showing of numbers and strength.
Rainey has control of the Junta anti-
Buckley organization beyond any ques
tion, but he is assiduously strengthening
his power in that organization, and his
partners are expected to help him out in
his political battles in the Democratic i
party. The Rainey push and the Kelly I
posh ami many of the friends of Rainey
and Kelly who* amount to something ia
district politics will be played together at
primaries of both parties. It is reported j
That Martin Kelly is now working to win i
over to Rainey some of Sam Braunhart's ''
men in tne Twenty-ninth, and that his as- !
sistance to Rainey* has already been seen
in other directions.
Kelly and Mahoney have been lying j
low ever since that snap Saturday night !
meeting in Mahoney's rooms at the Bald- j
win Hotel, when two forged proxies, one
legitimate proxy and two of the eleven !
members or the State Central Committee j
created an alleged congressional com- i
rnittee for the fourth district. Two or i
three days later the members of the State I
THE LAIE ABRAHAM S.NST.
[From a p< in'ing.
Central Committee, representing the |
fourth district, held a meeting and by the
unanimous vote of the seven present ap
pointed the legitimate congressional com
mittee, which has been recognized as lhe
regular one except by Martin Kelly, J. H.
Mahoney and Sam Kainey.
The regular committee has declared for
a primary election and given sucn elec
tion into the hauds of the county commit
tee. The county committee will very soon
issue a call for a primary and conduct the
election which will name the regular dele
gation to Sacramento.
Since this action Kelly and Mahoney :
and their committee have made no open
move. It has been given out that they
would wait until the regular primary is
called and then pet up anntherone for the j
same day or a day or two later, counting I
on sending to Sacramento a contesting j
delegation and takine the chance that it j
would be given partial recognition.
With Kelly and .Mahoney are some rem
nants of Burns' old following, including
Eddie Conroy, Jake Shaen and others.
In the Twenty-eighth are some of Kelly's
henchmen of old, and JÂ»e has quite a fol
lowing there, although his strength in the
Twenty-eighth is much less than in the
last days of Kelly's junkshop there.
Mahoney has some personal following in
his Forty-third District, but those politi
cally wise have b-en unable to see where
Mahoney and Kelly could scare up a show
ing that wouid amount to more than a
trifling factional kick.
This factional move in the Fourth is
generally expected to die a natural death,
which it will do unless unexpected re
enforcements are gained. Sam Rainey
has a supply of re-enforcements for most
anything in the political line, especially
primary elections. With Raaney's "push"
behind him Kelly may possibly attempt
a battle in the'JVentv-eighth District with
the friends of John I). Spreckels, and if a
rival primary is held Rainey's forces can
help supply a showing of numbers.
Of course this will be nothing novel, as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
Kelly and Rainey have had long experi
ence in helping out bosses on the other
side at primary elections. Kelly's push
will help out the Junta where Sam Rainey
rules and the Fire Department toughs will
be placed under Kelly's orders whenever
they are needed.
There is nothing surprising in this part
nership after all. It is the way of boss
politics when Raiu^ys, Kellys and
Mahonevs get a show to go up against the
decent element oi any party. Kelly is a
Kellycan in politics, Rainey is a Rainey
crat, and the devil may take the party.
Another reason why this arrangement
is a very natural and a to-be-expect d
thing is that both Mahoney and Kelly
have long been close personal and polit
ical friends of Sam Rainey. Mahoney has
been to Sacramento as a Senator for two
sessions of the Legislature, and at
both sessions he was personaliy intimate
with Rainey when the latter was there in
behalf of h" re department and other bills,
and Mahoney has as a legislator proved
himself a valiant friend of Sam Rainey
and his legislative schemes. Rainey really
owes it to Mahoney to help him when he
is in a tight place, and it s likewise with
Martin Kelly.
Sam Rainey, as he gets further out of
politics, is forging right to the front,
and promises to become a greater boss
than he ever was when he had to keep in
tne shadow of Chris Buckley.
Weathered Fierce Gale*.
The British ship Altair arrived in port last
night after a stormy and checkered voyage
from Calcutta. She sailed away from Hindo
stau on December 7, 1895, and on December
10 encountered a very heavy gale that blew
with hurricane force. The ship was kept be
fore the wind until December 11, at 1:45 a. m.,
when she broached to and went on her beam
ends for an hour. The srale shifted the cargo
to starboard, washed the starboard-quarter
boat overboard and everything movable on
deck, and also blew away three lower toosails
and main topmast staysail. She had been off
this port for nine days at the mercy of calms
and baffling light winds.
PASSED AWAY IN SLEEP
Death of Abraham Gunst, Father
of the Police Commis
sioner.
AT A RIPE, VENERABLE AGE.
A Grand Old Man, Who Was Better
Known Among the Poor Than
the Rich.
Surrounded by those members of his
family at present in tbis City, Abraham
Gunst died during bis sleep yesterday
morning at his home.
He was 84 years of age, a vigorous-look
ing but inwardly weak man, upon whom
life's uds and downs had been freely vis
ited. In his later years, however, when
sickness overcame him, and his appear
ance downtown was but a rare pleasure for
his friends, his son, Mose A. Gunst, was
by his side.
The old gentleman was a prominent
member of the Congregation Emanu-El,
and one who not only as such, but as a
private individual, made himself beloved
everywhere on account of hi* regard for
others and his widespread charity.
The deceased was born in Heiidensheim,
Germany, in 1812. He came to this coun-
! try in 1837 and to California in 1853, en
gaging in mercantile business.
Two years later he returned East and
settled in Atlanta, 6a., where, as a whole
sale dry-goods dealer fye laid the founda
tion for a large fortune. The war broke
out, However, and he. like many South
erners, was a victim of the financial disas
ter which clouded the South.
In 1867 Mr. Gunst returned to California
to mend his fortune and he was eminently
successful. His family grew up arouna
him, and his death is the only severe blow
that has occurred to mar their happiness.
Last Thursday week he took to his bed
after a few years of suffering and his end
was looked for at any moment. It came,
but it was no less sorrowful to his friends
: and family for its having been expected.
Abraham Gunst, whose funeral will take
; place this afternoon, left a widow and four
j sorrowing children. They are Mrs. Eman
-1 uel Katz, at present in Brooklyn, N. V.,
Lee Gunst, also in Brooklyn, Silas Gunst,
and Mose A. Gunst, at present Police
Commissioner in this City.
Father Torke'i Sister Dead.
Mrs. Theodore Davies, wife of the Chief Jus
tice of British Columbia and sister of the Rev.
P. C. Yorke, chancellor of the archdiocese of
San Francisco, died a few days ago and the
priest has pone to Victoria to attend the
funeral, Besides her husband, who was for
merly Premier of the province, the deceased
leaves six children to mourn her death. Mrs.
Davies was a woman of great talents and was
prominent in society. She was well known in
this City, where f he had many friends and
relatives.

THROUGH RATES
TO BE ADVANCED
Significance of the Meeting
of the Magnates at
New York.
COMPETITION TO CEASE.
Traffic War of the Past Three
Years to Give Way to a
Dreaded Peace.
NO NEW SCHEDULES TILL MAY.
The Subsidy to Be Paid the Panama
Route Carriers Equal to $20
a Ton.
Though nothing has been heard from
New York for Ihe past few days regarding
the work of the railroad magnates, who
are endeavoring to bring into existence
again the old Transcontinental Traffic
Association, it is known in railroad circles
that they are actively tnough quietly at
work perfecting the plans for reorganiza
tion.
The men in this conference are those
representatives of the various roads who
have general charge of the traffic depart
ment, the Southern Pacific representative
being J. C. Stubbs, who is t .c third, vice
president of his road as well as general
traffic manager. This body considers and
decides upon the broad propositions in
volved, such as differentials and subsidies,
and the arrangement of details is then left
to a subsequent meeting of the general
freight a.scuts of the various roads in
terested.
l'hat the work of the railroad men now
in conference in New York is progressing
satisfactorily is shown by the fact that a
meeting of the general freight agents of all
the transcontinental lines has been called
to meet at Milwaukee March 30, and it is
believed that the work before it will be to
fix up the details, snon as new rate sheets,
that will make possible the full and com
plete rehabilitation of the Transconti
nental Association.
Although there is a Federal law against
what is known as a pooling arrangeni?nt,
that obstacle is overcome by a very simple
and ingenious arrangement, which does
away with the "pool" in fact, but main
tains it in spirit, and by means of wbicii
the entire country, so far as its transpor
tation requirements are cone, rued, is j
placed at tne mercy of a combination that â 
has often and amply demonstrated its dis- I
regard for the general public interest wlien
that interest conflicted in any sense with
its own.
Instead of there beinjr a general pool I
formed, an arrangement is agreed upon I
whereby each road is to issue a certain !
freight schedule, based on a differential
(an arbitrary difference in rates) that is |
calculated to give it its fair proportion of
business. In this way no carrier has any j
excuse for attempting to invade the terri
tory of a rival, and thus all competition is j
stifled, and the dancer and evils of a rate j
â  war are averted. It is on this basis that '
: the reorganization of the Transcontinental i
â  Traffic Association is beinsr effected.
Tha^ body went to pieces about three i
years ago through the recalcitrancy of the j
j Great Northern, which declined outright
1 to continue to pay its proportion of the
I $72,500 then being paid by me Transconti
nental Association to the Pacific Mail j
Steamship Company, which in those days i
absolutely controlled the Panama Railroad j
by means of a rental contract, and which |
also had its own steamers on the Atlantic j
side. The example of the Great Northern 1
was followed shortly by the Northern Pa- I
' cific and by the Canadian Pacific. Then !
' came the withdrawal of the subsidy, the !
I expiration and cancellation of the contract I
between the Pacific Mail and tne Panama
; Railroad, the through-freight war through
' the instrumentality of the North Ameri- j
can Navigation Company organized in this j
I City, and finally the complete disruption i
of the Transcontinental Traffic Association. 1
: And ever since rates have been in a most ]
demoralized condition.
But when the Panama Railroad Com- j
', pany allowed itself to be beguiled and j
i again tangled up in the net adroitly spread !
; by C. P. Huntiugton through the Pacific j
1 Mail Steamship Company a ray of hope !
was infused into the situation, and it was j
; not long, as events proved, before a joint :
I meeting of the transcontinental lines was
deemed advisable and desirable.
What the action of the association in
; the matter of agreeing to pay a subsiay of
; $72,500 per month to the Panama carriers
; means to the merchants of San Francisco
may be surmised in tlie light of an anal
'< ysis of certain facts and figures.
According to the dispatches from New
! York, where the magnates are in session,
the proposition is to pay the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company ani the Panama
Railroad Company $72,500 per month,
I which amount is to be divided in the pro
! portion of 55 per cent to the Panama com
| pany and 45 per cent to the Pucific Mail
I Company. This is not designated a sub
j sidy by the railroad people, for that would
be a violation of the law, but is to be paid
for rental of 600 tons on each outgoing
steamer. Three steamers leave New York
and this port every month on the through
route via Panama. The rental is therefore
to pay for 3600 tons a month, or at the
rate of something over $20 per ton. When
the railroads thus jointly agree to pay the
Panama route something over $20 per ton
for freight the question naturally asked by
the merchants is, What will be the all-rail
rate between New York and San Fran
cisco? As a matter of fact, however, there
has been less than 6500 tons moved over
this route during the past three months,
and this has cost the shipper only from $6
to $12 per ton.
What makes the San Francisco shipper
feel aggrieved is the breach of faith on the
part of the Panama Railroad Company.
This company has always been most ear
nest in the protestations of independence
and of maintaining the isthmus route as
a genuine and actual competitor of the
railroads. This it was in a position to do,
j as was known to the mercantile commu-
I nity, because it, and not the Pacific Mail,
has a voice in all traffic arrangements
made, and il is the Panama company that
now casts the vote for itself ana the Pacific
Mail in the deliberations of the transcon
tinental lines at New York.
It is not likely, even under the most
favorable circumstances, that the advance 'â 
in rates will go into effect before May 1
next. The freight, agents will not get
together until March 30, and it will take
them some little time to build up the new
tariffs, and then ten days' notice must be
given to the public of the proposed
changes. Another important fact In this 1
connection is that the Panama Railroad
Company, about three weeks ago in an
nouncing its sailing schedule of west- bound
I steamers, at the same time declared that
i the existing rates were guaranteed until
j May 1.
808 BURDETTE'S TALK.
He Kept His Auditorium Audience Con
vulsed Two Hours Last Night.
Robert J. Burdette lectured to an ap
preciative if not large audience in tbe
Auditorium last night.
The truthful writer who would attempt
to furnish his readers with anything like
an adequate idea of the effect produced by
Mr. Btirdette's talk must necessarily re
produce ihe lecture verbatim, and even
then disappointment would result.
As has been said "he is funny without
knowing it," and he talks straight ahead
as though laughter was not expected or
desired. But the laughter comes at un
stated periods and causes the "Hawkeye"
man to interject asterisks and paragraphs
where they had no place in the setting of
his lecture.
He described the boastfui and awkward
young man as he appeared at his first so
cial function; the self-conscious maid un
der similar circumstances; the old maid,
the bachelor, the green and fresh of socie
ty's urban products.
There was nothing cheap in Mr. Bur
dette's humor. He did not attempt to make
any play on the common and uninterest
ing foibles of mankind, but showed how
funny the average man may be under the
most ordinary circumstances.
He was serious at times, aimost to the
pathetic, but he never made the blunder
of stopping to explain his jokes or pausing
for a laugh.
MADE THE BABY SICK.
The HaÂ« to of a Landlady Costs Her
S2OO in a Justice Court
Suit.
Justice of the Peace Groezinjjer gave
John W'nlton a judgment for $200 and costs
yesterday in his suit against James Reid
and Alice Reid.
The plaintiff alleged that on November
7 last the defendant Alice Reid, who was
the landlady of the house where he resided
with his wife and little child, entered h:s
rooms which he had been given an in
formal notice to vacate and in his absence
placed the family belongings in the hall
way, tearing ut> the carpets and taking
away the mattress of the bed, leaving his
wife no place to s-leep: that Mrs. Walton
had been compelled, with the five-months
old baby, to occupy the kitchen for two
nights without comforts of any kind; that
in consequence both bad been made ill.
Mrs. Reid admitted having taken up one
piece of carpet and removed her furniture,
bat denied that she had in any way inter
fered with the Walton property.
Justice Goezinger held that in view of
the fact tl at no legal notice to leave the
premises had been given any forcible
entrance amounted to trespass and that
the plaintiff was entitled to damages, and
he gave judgment accordingly.
AN OLD-TIME DRIVEWAY.
A Portion of San Francisco That
Has Not Improved Its
Condition.
Tanner's Hollow Presents No Induce
ment for a Boulevard
Continuation.
That portion of the metropolis located
on what is known as the '"oM San Bruno
road," leading from the Mission proper
out through South San Francisco to the
county line of San Mateo County,. is one
portion of the City proper that has never
baen blessed with an improvement club,
and as a consequence it bears on its sur
face and surroundings the sad spectacle of
neglect and forgetfulness.
With the exception of a few inhabitable
dwellings on York street, from Twenty
fourth to Army, the old San Bruno road
presents the same appearance to-day that it
| did thirty years ago, with the exception of
i the eastern side, where a lot of tanneries,
j Boap works and a chemical laboratory are
I located, all of which are useful, but none
j of which are ornamental in their present
condition.
In addition to these structures, which
| are ancient and unsightly, the road is in
! bad condition, and in the winter season is
a bed ot real mud into which wagons sink
to the hub.
With the prospect of making Folsom
street a boulevard from Third street to
Nineteenth, and inviting a continuance to
Army street, thence into San Bruno roa>!
as an outlet to the waters of the bay and
San Mateo, the condition of this portion of
the old road should receive attention either
from the property-owners or the Super
visors to induce persons seeking a pleasant
driveway to patronize that route. The
view at present comprehends seven tan
neries, two establishments for soapmakmg
and one where chemicals are prepared, an
offensive odor from sour marsh lands and
water, with a forlorn picture of a dilapi
dated pesthouse in the offing on the knob
of the hill east of the road. A continuation
of the Folsom-street boulevard would be a
mistake, for its outlet in this direction
to the County line, unless it receives some
attention from those who are now seized
by the spirit of progress and improvement.
The neglected condition of Tannery Flat
is in sad comparison with the improved
location of the southeast section of the
Mission, where handsome residences and
good streets can be found south of Twenty
fourth street, with the tall and graceful
spire of St. Peter's Catholic Church in the
center of the improved section.
Army street, which runs parallel with
the bed of the old Mission Creek to the
base of the Twin Peaks and under Bernal
Heights to the San Bruno road, micht
have some, inducements to those residents
of the Mission who are now seized with
the spirit of progress as a suitable avenue
leading to a good driveway in that portion
of the City.
Since the advent of the electric cars from
the City front on Brannan street to Tenth,
and out Bryant street to Bernal Heights,
the heretofore remote section has given
the south end a boom and property has in
creased in value. New houses are being

Treasures of the Shah.
Of all the sovereigns of the world, the

it beinp valued at $60,000,000. the chief
object of value being the old crown of
Persian rulers, in the form of a pot of
flowers, which is surmounted by an uncut
ruby the size of a hen's epe. The dia
monds in another symbol of his rank are
said to weigh almost twenty pounds.
There is also a jewelled saber, valued at
$1,000,000. Another thing tnat the Shah
prizes is a siiver vase, ornamented with
100 emeralds, whose equals, it i 3 said, are
not to be found in the world. In the col
lection there is a cube of amber which tra
dition says fell from the heavens in the

TO PATRGNIZE

A Motto That Has Not
Always Been Ob
served.
MUCH DISSATISFACTION. |
Allegation That Some Firms Are
Unduly and Indelicately
Represented.
A FIGHT AGAINST MR. MEAD.
Prospects of a Lively Time To-Day at
the Election of the Manufac
turers' Association.
It is expected that there will be a lively
discussion this" afternoon at the annual
election of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association of California.
A large number of members say that
they are dissatisfied with the manner in
which the organization has been con
ducted, and they object to two of the lead- ;
in;; officers being taken from the same
firm, one which, they say, has frequently
violated the object of the association â
namely to encourage home manufacturers.
It is likely that the opposition will
center on the fight for the secretaryship,
which position is now held by L. R. Mead
of the Eisdon Iron Works. The opposi
tion to Mr. Mead is not a personal one,
but is directed against the firm which
Secretary Mead represents. It is alleged
by those of the opposition who intend to
take part in the discussion to-day that the
Risdon Iron WorKs has had considerable
work done in the East, and that, conse
quently, the manufacturing industries of
ibis State have been injured more or less.
They say that it does not look like con
sistency for a firm to be represented by
officers in an association designed for the
purpose of encouraging home industries
when the firm so represented sends large
quantities of work to be done in the East.
Much dissatisfaction also exists as to the
manner in which the Pacific Lumber Com
pany let the contract for supplying it with
a bano. sawmill plant. The Vulcan Iron
Works and the Risdon Iron Works were
bidders, but All is of Milwaukee underbid
them by about 25 per cent, and the job
went to the East. The dissatisfaction
arose in this case over the way in which
the contract was let. It is alleged by local
manufacturers that there are many parts
of the bandsaw plant which the Allis firm
does not make and which could be sup
plied by San Francisco manufacturers
about as cheaply as Mr. Allis, who has the
work done by some one else in the East.
They say that the Pacific Lumber Com
pany should have had that part of the
work done in California,
There is also much discontent because
the association did not succeed in having
the State Harbor Commissioners use Cali- ;
fornia stone for the proposed ferry depot
at the foot of Market street, and also be
cause some ot the iron work for that build
ing will be done in the East.
It is alleged also that Secretary Mead
and a few others have been managing the
association in accordance with their own
ideas, and that it has failed of its purpose
for that reason.
"The association has not been able to do
much for California industries because we
have too many people in front who make
it a practice to have their work done out
side of tnis State," remarked a prominent
member yesterday, "and it does not look
consistent. There are too many people
like Mike de Young and the Pacific Lum
ber Company who have their work done
outside this State. Of course their pres
ence in the association does not hurt it
any, for they would send their work away
anyhow. But it would be more in accord
ance with decency and delicacy if the repre
sentatives of such firms would remain in
the ranks instead of posing as officers at
the head of the association.
"We are hampered in California because
of the fact that interest, material and labor
are higher here than in the East, and
added to that there are local difficulties,
such as isolation' from great manufactur
ing centers."
.The effort to he made by the opposition
to-morrow will be in the direction of
NEW TO-DAY.

more in keeping, they say, with the motto
of the association, "Patronize Home In
dustry." â¢
Another matter to be discussed to-day
will be the proposition to hold a joint ex
position with the Mechanics' Institute.
Complaint has been made that last year
the members of the association did not
make a showing at the Mechanics'lnsti
tute Fair and it is proposed this year to
make a strenuous effort in the direction of
co-operation.
C A. BAILEY SENTENCED.
Judge Campbell Inflicts the Severe
Penaltyâ An Arrest for Perjury.
Charles A. Bailey, druggist, Sutter street
and Grant avenue, who wae convicted by
a jury in Judse Campbell's court on Fri
day of selling morphine without a doc- j
tor's prescription or order, appeared for j
sentence yesterday morning.
Attorney Lennon renewed his applica- '
tion for arrest of judgment and for a new
trial, which was denied.
The Judge sentenced him to pay a fine
of $500 or be imprisoned in the County
Jail for six months. In passing sentence
the Judge condemned tbe traffic in mor
phine. He concluded: "The sentence of :
the court is that you be fined in the sum
of $500 with tne alternative of six ruontus' j
imprisonment."
Attorney Lennon at once gave notice of \
appeal and filed a bond for $1000.
Mrs. Sarah McConnell, tlie complaining
witness, was in court, and she thanked the I
Judge after sentence had been imposed, j
She immediately went to Judge Low's :
court and swore out a warrant for Bailey's ;
arrest on the charge of perjury.
At tne trial Bailey caused a sensation by
producing an order signed "Morrison,
M.D.," which he alleged Mrs. McConnell ;
handed to him when she asked for the i
morphine. Mrs. McConneil claims that in j
so testifying Bailey committed perjury, as '
she did not present a prescription or order. ;
j Bailey was arrested and released on $2000
' bonds.

Interesting and Novel Invitation
Cards for the Native Sons'
Smoker and Banqtret.
El Dorado Parlor No. 52 of Native Sons
has issued a rather striking and novel
invitation card fo/ its entertainment on
the 7th of next month at Native Sons'
Hall.
The entertainment itself promises to be
out of the ordinary rut of such thing* by
several degrees. It will combine all the
lack of formality of a high jinks, with all
the restful comfort of a smoker and all the
joy of head and stomach of a banquet.
There will also be a literary and musical
programme of unusual merit.
El Dorado Parlor has called its function
the "Obsequies of Universal Trouble," and
has set forth in silver letters on the reverse
side of a black coffin-shaped card the
following funeral notice:
Obsequies

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Fire in the Cargo of the
Bark Alexandra Under
Control.
WATEE BEING PUMPED OUT.
While Docking at Lombard Street the
San Bias Ran Down tbe Pup
and Sank Her.
i
All danger of fire on the British bark
Alexandra is now past, and the tugs Fear- \
The British Bark Alexandra, With the Tugs Fearless, Vigilant and Alert Pumping Her Out.
less, Vigilant and Alert are now busily en- j
paged in pumping her out. Ail night \
long the water was pumped into the hold i
and when morning broke the main deck |
was submerged. Captain Barheid and his
wife took ud their quarters on the Fearless ;
and remained aboard all day as the guests
of CaDtain Haskell. It was impossible to
do any cooking in the ship's ralley, so all
the officers and men on the Alexandra had
their meals on the tugs.
When the Fearless and Vigilant began |
pumping out the hold of the Alexandra
yesterday morning they at first made no j
impression. The water ran in as fast as j
it was Dumped out, and at one time it ap- j
peared as though vessel and cargo would be
a total loss. As the tide fell, however, the
big pumps began to make an impression, ,
â¢ and when the Alert got to work the water
iin the hold fell gradually. By 4p. m. the
vessel's main deck was clear, and from
that on everything went smoothly. By!
this morning the chances are that the Al- j
exandra will be ready to dock, and then her .
; cargo will be discharged. The bar's will :
then receive a thorough oxerhauling, and j
will probably load here for Europe.
Captain Burfieid is a very sick man. As I
{ soon as a physician saw his wounded lee, !
! he ordered him to bed, and it will probably j
be a month before he is able to be" about i
again. His leg is swolen to enormous S
proportions, and the wounds made by the i
bursting rocket are very much inflamed, i
The officers and crew are very indignant ;
over a statement published to the effect;
that they were going to desert the burning j
ship and were only stopped by the en- j
treaties of Mrs. Bartieid. They deny the <
statement in toto. and point to the fact
that when the hre was raging most fiercely
Chief Officer Biacklock and Second Mate '
j Madams went below and removed four i
i caseÂ«of kerosene, which were expected to j
i explode every minute. Mrs. Barheid is .
very indignant over the matter, and says |
every man aboard did his duty.
The sunken vessel and tlie three big ;
tugs at work on her drew quite a crowd to |
the sugar refinery yesterday. Hundreds \
of people lined the shore' all day and!
watched the proceedings with great inter- j
est. Outwardly the Alexandra shows no '
?igiis of the fire that raged within. Those I
portions of the deck that could be seen '
were warped in all direction?, and around
the mainmast were a number of holes, j
burnt out by the fire. The cabin was
gutted, but the foiward part of the vessel
did not suffer much. Tne entire cargo has i
been mined, so the underwriters will be
heavy losers.
The total loss on vessel and cargo, in
cluding towage and pumping, will prob
ably exceed $25,000. The cargo of 2000 tons I
jof coal will be a total loss. .New decks will
i have to be put in and probably a new i
j main mast. All in all, the underwriters
will suffer considerably.
The Pacilic Mail Company's steamer
San Bias got in from Panama and way
ports yesterday, a day ahead of time, and i
docked at Lombard-street wharf. The '
tug Barclay Golden left Acapulco a clay j
ahead of the San Bias and may be ex
pected here about next Friday. General
Ezeta, who started in her to reconquer
San Salvador, is at Panama, and the
officers on the steamer say he has not a !
cent. At Corinto the steamer did not |
stop, so there is no news from the war at I
Nicaragua. From what could be gathered i
further up the coast, however, the general j
impression on the San Bias was that the i
rebels were getting the best of the struggle.
The San Bias brought the following
cabin passengers:
Mrs. C. J. Southwlck, Mrs. It O'Connor, Fat
| Cliel, J. H. Farthing, Mrs. L. M. Gray, Mrs. L.
I H. Canii, W. H. Taubert. Carlos Luis, H. de
Windt, Mrs. If. J. Murphy and chl;d, A. T.
Reid, Santiago Wo and wife, Martin Hille
prandt; and twenty-two in the steerage.
The docking of the San Bias caused the
wreck of the little steam launch Pup. For
years and years she has beer, used to take
the lines of the Pacific Mail Company's
steamers as they were docking, and old
Captain "Bill" Taylor has probably been
longer in that line of business than any
other boatman in San Francisco. As the
San Bias was docking yesterday a heaving
line was thrown to Captain Bill and he at
once started for the wharf w.th it. Before
the Pup had cone ten yards the line cauuht
in her propeller and brought the little
steamer to a standstill. The San Bias
bore down on her and in a few minutes the
little steamer had been turned over and j
was sunk twenty-four feet deep. Captain |
Bill and the engineer jumped for their I
lives and were hauled on the wharf. The!
Pup will be raised, and as tne big steamer j
only hit her a glar.cing blow the chances
are that it will not cost much to repair her.
The work of rejuvenating theoid British
bark Sharpshooter is being rapidly pushed.
New spars and new decks are being put in
and when completed the Sharpshooter
will be a barkentine and a? good as new.
She will run between here and Honolulu.
A dispatch to the Merchants' Ex
change from Collins Landing says
that at about 3 p. m. on the 23J inst.
a two-masted schooner with a dismasted
schooner in tow was sighted off Fish Rock
proceedine south. It is probably one of
the coasters that has been disabled in a
cale. One of the southbound steamers
may pick tier up and bring her into port.
The schoonar J. B. Leeds, now out 90
days from Guaymas for Grays Harbor, is
all' right. Twenty-five days ago she was
in Amapala and may be expected at ber
destination any time now.
The schooner Bobrik. owned by the Rus
sian Sealskin Company, of which C. M.
Grunwaldt is the general agent, will leave
for Kamchatka to-day, via Hakodate. At
the latter place she will taite aboard rifty
Japanese fishermen and their provisions.
The nets, barrels and other supplies have
been purchased in San Francisco.
The barkentine Bering, owned by the
same company, will also start for Kam
chatka to take seals, and the steamer
Kotik to take fish, which are to be prepared
in the European style.
MURPHY'S COMMISSION.
Trouble Over the Sale of the Colton
House to C. P. Huntingdon.
The First National Bank is suing Mrs.
Ellen M. Colton for the amount of an over
draft of 58000.
The bank claims that its president, S. G.
Murphy, sold the Taylor-street house, for
merly belonging to Mrs. Colton, to C. P.
Huntington, for $275,000, and that it
thereby earned $8000 in commissions.
Mrs. Colton denied that she had author
ized Murphy to sell the house, and so she
refused to allow the com miss-ion asked.
The suit is on trial before Judge Hunt.
STOLE WATCHES AND COIN
Several Olympic Club Members
Were Relieved of Valu
ables.
Latest News Concerning the Doings j
of Sportsmen, Athletes
and Boxers.
Mayor Sutro has given his permission to :
the Olympic Club to hold a ten-round pro- i
fessional contest in conjunction with its '
annual boxing tournament in May.
As previously stated in The Call Di- j
rector Short has been in correspondence j
for some time with two noted pugilists |
and if all goes well a match will be ar- ;
ranged in a few days.
There is some talk of matching George
Green with Tommy Ryan, but as the lat- I
ter demands a large pnrse the club will j
doubtless give him permission to box else- ',
where.
For some weeks past sleight-of-nand per
formers have been relieving members of j
the Olympic Club of watches, jewelry and j
money. ,
Time and again the secretary of the club j
has instructed bathers that before enter- j
ing the bathrooms they should deposit J
their valuables at the office for safe-keep- |
ing. These instructions have been either j
forgotten or ignored by some of the mem
bers, and as a consequence the neglectful !
swimmers have discovered on returning to
their dressing compartments that a visitor
had been on a tour of lnÂ»pection and re
lieved them of whatever they possessed of
value.
A member named Christie lost a $175
gold watch and some small change a few
nays ago and another member lost over
$100 in gold.
Of course the club cannot be held ac
countable for losses sustained by its mem
bers because of their neglect to comply
with the instructions issued by the secre
tary. The members can blame them
selves only and be wiser in the future.
The Olympic Club directors will meet
this evening, and the matter of particular
importance to be discussed is the proposed
new handball court.
Director Short has collected the $1000
which the board asked for before it would
consent to the addition of a new athletic
department. It is safe to say that the di
rectors will be more than phased this even
ing to learn of the great interest that is
manifested by a laree proportion of the
members in handball. Never before in
the history of the club was the sum of
$100u collected from the members for the
purpose of furthering any particular
branch of sport on such short notice,
and the liberality shown by the patrons of
the game proves conclusively that hand
ball has substantial backing and will live
when other sports are dead.

SUB-CONTRACTING FOR WORK.
All the "Struck" Shops in the City

An important change in the situation of
the painters' strike took place yesterday.
It was decided to permit the union men to
return to work for boss painters who are
favorable to the union.
The striking painters have found that
Salvation Army soldiers were taking their

places on contracts that have been
'struck" and that the Sal\ation Army
officers were taking sub-contracts from the
master painters unfriendly to the union.
The Oakland union has been advised by
the parent organization in this city not to
strike until it grows stronger in numbers.
There is no change in the situation on
the employers' side of the controversy.
WILL RETURN TO WORK.
Striking Union Painters Permitted
to Return to Bosses Who Ac
cede to All Demands.
Tiie most important meeting of the
Painters' Union since the strike began \
was held yesterday at 115 Turic street. The I
union decided to let the men go back to
work for the boss painters wbo are favora
ble to the union and who have and will
accede to all demands. This matter for the I
past two days has caused much discussion j
in the meetings of the union.
It was brought up by the co-operation
committee of twenty-five appointed to as
sist the executive board in conducting and
arranging the plans of the strike. Chair
man Ames read the report which recom- ;
mended that the union men be permitted j
to return to all "fair" or union shops. â 
That is, shops where the bosses have and
will declare themselves favorable to the
union, pay $3 a day for eight hours' wcrk |
and recognize the working-card.
The master painters to whom the men
return to work must not take a contract â¢
sublet by the master painters who are tight- |
ing the union.
Th â¢ committee further recommended !
that the men who return to work under i
these conditions contribute a part of their
days' w ages to the union to be used for the j
maintenance and support of the strikers j
who are unable to secure work and are !
still on strike.
This threw the question fairly upon the
meeting, and it must be acknowledged
that the leaders were uneasy as to what ac
tion would be taken by the majority.
Upon the decision depended the life or
death of the union as well as of the strike.
There were a number, as may be ex
pected, who favored fighting all the bosses j
to the bitter end, and their argument was
that the matter was practically in the
hands of the Building Trades Council; J
that the main principle involved was |
whether or not all contractors must respect :
the working-card, and that by April 1 the j
fight will fall upon the shoulders o' the
entire building trades. In other words,
the painters should stand togerher and
conquer or die.
The arguments of those who favored
adopting the committee's report were |
summed up in the following remarks by j
Mclvor:
It is said that we made a mistake In calling
out the men on a general strike, and not ex
c<-Dtine those who declared themselves In our
lavor at the first. I deny that assertion. We
i.aye male no mistake. Between the first and j
the second call-out many bosses professed to
be friendly to the union. They were not.
They made the professions simply to be able
to finish their contracts, and then they begun
to take the contracts from our avowed ene
mies Moreover, they were among tho iirst in
me Master Painters' Association to throw
down th 3 gauntlet to light us. We were
obliged to do something to find who were our
fneudb, who were our avowed enemies and I
who wore trying to carry Mater on both
shoulders This was determined by the last
call-out, which was the only way possible to
obiain that knowledge.
The line has tot'dn drawn, and it is well de
fined. We know our enemies from our friends,
and it Is unwise and unju&t to cause the latter
to suffer with the former. Let us return to our
friends and help them and they will help us.
The public, wanting any work Uone will go
to those bosses vno have men to do the work
and not to those master painters whose shops
are tied up. This action does not raise the
strike, for we will ptill continue to fight the
Master I'ainters' Association until the last man
.of laem gives iv or dies. I ooj>e ;hej- will
never give in, bo we can ultimately crush them
out of existence. We will win by fighting our
enemies, but not by fighting the favorable
bosses.
More than that, the Building Trades Council
will come to our assistance ana decline to
work on any non-union job, for the card sys
tem will surely be enforced; but we cannot in
I justice ask them to assist us In an unjust fight
! against our friends.
The motion to let the strikers go back to
work for the friendly bosses was carried by
an overwhelming vote. It was also de
cided to assess every man working fifty
rents for each day he works. This will
'make a revenue of about $200 a day with
- which to continue the strike against the
! master painters and to provide for the
strikers who became impoverished by
reason of the strike.
A little later the executive committee
announced the following partial list of em
: ployers who have acceded to the union's
' demands and for whom the union men
may work, beginning to-day:
Swan & Stein, J. Cooney. B. Bradley, Meyers

This list will be added to as the bosses
! yield to the union's demand.
After a little di.-scussion it was decided
that all idle union painters register every
â  day between 9 and 11 a. m. with the execu
j tive committee; also that shop stewards
j be selected by the men in every shop.
j These two actions will prevent any rene-
gade from working in non-nnion shops
on the quiet and keep all shops "clean."
A motion to demand that the bosses
take back their old hands and that no one
be allowed to fill a place vacated by a man
ordered out on a strike was voted down,
on the ground that all bosses shoula have
the right to select their own men so long
as they take union men.
Thes-c matters being settled the best of !
harmony prevailed.
A letter was read from the Tin. Sheet- j
iron and Cornice Workers' International |
Association of this City extending hearty j
support and financial assistance if neces- i
A letter was received from a painter at j
Menlo Park which stated that Kuss had
eight non-union men at work on the house
of E- W. Hopkins. He wants a committee
of eight to go down there and induce the
painters to quit work. St. Denis' contract
at Menlo Park is still tied up.
THE OAKLAND UNION.
Its Representatives Were Advised
Not to Go on a Strike
Immediately.
The committee of twenty-five held a
meeting last evening and received a delega
| tion from the Oakland Painters' and
i Decorators' Union No. 2, wb,ich is a branch
jof the San Francisco union. In Oakland
i there are 75 union painters, and about 300
jin all. The delegates from Oakland
wanted instructions as to whether or hot
it would be advisable to make a demand
for a $3 rate of wages for eight hours and a
recognition of the card system.
A demand of this kind would mean a
| strike. It was explained that there were
j many non-union men waiting the decision
: of the union as to whether or not they
j would join, not wishing to join and be im-
I mediately ordered out on a strike. Where
| the Oakland union is under the jurisdiction
of the San Francisco body the latter's de
cision is very essential to the matter.
Another item was that three Oakland
union men are under the ban for working
in San Francisco aiter having been called
out by the parent body. These are anxious
to have a strike declared in order to prevent \
i their being expelled from the Oakland
union.
The committee recommended that as a
I large number of Oakland men were ob
! taining $3 a day, the union do not go
I out on a strike until it controls the entire
! craft, and then a demand will serve the
i purpose of a strike; also that the tnree
men be fined for violating the union
rules.
The Oakland men al?o reported that as
some of the San Francisco master painters
are subletting their out-of-town contracts
at Menlo Pane and San Rafael to Oakland
! bosses, a resolution was passed by the
I union that no Oakland painter will be per
j mitted to go out of Alameda County to j
work on such jobs.
They further stated that St. Denis, who
has the Parrott building contract, is offer
ing Oakland painters $4 a day to finish the
job. but without success. Another report
was that N. P. Kuss, the San Francisco
painter, is hard at work across the bay en
deavoring to induce the boss painters of
Oakland and Alameda to join the Master
Painters' Association.
:SALVATION PAINTERS.
Said to Be Working For and Taking:
Contracts From Antl-Unlon
Bosses.
The striking painters have encountered
a new enemy in their strike for higher
wages. A short time after the strike be
gan the officers of the relief committee of
the Salvation Army went to the bosses
who are recognized as enemies of the
union and offered to take work or handle
sub-contracts. Such was the report made
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
by one of the union painters last
night. He said he had thoroughly investi
gated the matter and found the situation
to be as stated.
He saia that such a job is being com
f)leted on Cole street, near tne Odd Fel
ows' Cemetery. This work was sublet
from Hoefer, the master painter, and Sal
tation Army soldiers are now finishing a
"struck" job.
Upon investigating further he was in
formed that the captain of the Salvation
relief committee, on Sacramento street,
offered to furnish any number of good
workmen to take the strikers' places at
$2 50 a day. He pays the workmen $1 a
day and turna the remainder, $1 50, Into
the Salvation relief fund. From what can
be learned there are a number of bosses
who propose to either hire these soldiers
(for the hours of work cut no figure) or
sublet to the Salvation Army officers.
MASTER PAINTERS FIRM.
They Will Not Employ Union Men
While the Strike
Is On.
The master painters admitted yesterday
that there was a deadlock in the bulk of
their business because of the strike.
Practically little or nothing in comparison
with the volume of spring business was
doing, but this condition was to be re
gretted by journeymen and master painters
alike. If there were one clearer indication
than another of the real state of affairs, it
j was noticeable in the unfeigned expres
sions of desire on both sides that the strike
would soon be concluded.
"So far as the master painters are con
cerned," explained E. H. Black, president
of the Employers' Association, "it looks
now as if this condition could extend for
j several weeks to come. The owners of
' property are willing to postpone the paint
! ing of their houses, so the bosses won't
find any pressure upon them. To be sure
the expenses of running shops, rent, etc.,
keep up; but the question arises in this
connection, Is the boss as well able to
stand the strain as the journeyman?
Many of the journeymen had no money
saved when they went out on strike. I
don't believe they were prepared for it,
and it will be hard for them to hold to
gether.
"A proposition came from them to put
some of their men at work, so that the
wages could be divided among the strikers;
but that was not entertained.
"I would wish to impress upon the
journeymen that lam not their enemy. I
am simply a servant of the Master Paint
ers' Association, and as its president it de
volves upon me to carry out the wishes
and instructions of our society. Person
ally, I have nothing in the world against
the men, but on the contrary I would like
to see things in such shape that they
could get better wages; and I would cer
tainly like to see this strike at an end. I
make this statement for the reason that a
threat was made to-day within the hear
ing of a friend to 'do me up.' "
David Harris, the master painter whose
contract to paint B'nai B'rith Hall was de
layed by the strike, had a force of men em
ployed yesterday in the interior of that
building.
"It does not mean," he said, "that be
cause I put some men to work on the hall
I intend to finish the contract during
the strike. I don't want to do anything
that would injure the B. B. building, but
it was a matter of urgency in one portion.
This job is only on the saloon, which has
to be finished in a hurry, but I don't propose
to continue the work until after this
trouble is settled, although I can get all
the men I need."
THE COOKS AND WAITERS.
They Met Last Night and Effected
a Permanent Organ
ization.
There was a large meeting last night at
1159 Mission street in answer to a call look
ing to the permanent organization of a
cooks' and waiters' union.
The meeting was called to order by T.
Beresford. Mr. Garver of the Furniture
makers offered a suggestion that the
union should be organized on political
lines from the outset.
G. B. Benham spoke in the same line
and favored socialistic ideas. He was fol
lowed by W. Macarthnr of the Sailors'
Union, one of the organizers of the San
Francisco Labor Council. He entered
into a lengthy explanation of the organiza
j tion of the Sailors' Union, which he' de
! clared is now one of the strongest labor
' organizations in the United States, and he
j said it was such because it had steered
I clear of politics, which he declared is the
j rock on which all organizations are
i wrecked.
One in the audience asked why the
sailors had not helped to elect a sailor to
j represent them instead of electing a pro
i fessional man like Maguire, and Mr. Mac-
I arthur replied that while the sailors are a
] power they could not elect one of their
number to any office. "We have iirpt
class men," he said, "Andrew Furuseth for
instance, who I doubt not would make as
good a President an many."
"Yes," said a voice, "he'd do better than
Cleveland without much trouble."
There was an executive session which
lasted late into the night, and after a pro
longed discussion it was decided that
there should be no politics in flic organi
zation.
It was decided to call the organization
*'Tlie Fraternity of Cook 3 and Waiters,"
and a constitution was adopted. The
question of socialism in the fraternity
was laid over until the next meeting when
officers will be elected.
On Picket Duty.
Early yesterday morning a strike com
mittee of twenty-five went to the Parrott
building to meet and turn back the non
{ union workmen whom St. Denis had "en
gaged to finish his painting. Several
strikers gained access to the building be
fore work hours to see if the non-union
men had been camping there over night,
but none were found. When the noh
union men arrived,. at 7a. m., they were
escorted into the building by the police.
There was no sign of Â£ disturbance. All
of the other non-union shops in the City
are "picketed" by union painters.
The Lathers' Strike.
At a meeting of the Lathers' Union last
evening it was decided not to take any
j more active steps in regard to their strike
I until April 1, when the Building Trades
! Council's working card will go into effect.
| Then it will be necessary to "striice" on all
! jobs where non-union men are at work.
At present there are only three non-union
jobs in town. A committee from the Oak
land Lathers' Union was present and plans
were discussed by which lathers from the
two cities shall not interfere with each
others' work. Able attorneys have been
engaged to defenc tho Striking lathers,
arrested for murder in the Marrs case.
A Painters' Benefit.
The striking painters will be given a
grand benefit next Wednesday evening by
the theatrical people of this City. W.
Danielson was the leading spirit in this
movement and he has met with unusual
success. At the meeting yesterday after
noon he reported that he had secured the
Bush-street Theater for Wednesday even
ing. Mr. Taylor of the same committee
stated that enough professional talent had
volunteered their services in aid of the
striking painters to start two shows.
Glazier* Organize.
The Glaziers' Union of San Francisco
was organized last eveniug at 115 Turk
street by Organizer McCartney of the
Building Trades Council. Twenty men
signed the roll. There are about fifty
glaziers in this City, and from all accounts
they will all join the union, which will at

IN A QUESTION
OF DOMICILE
Processes Cannot Be Car
ried From One State
to Another.
SOME NEW DIVORCE LAW
The De La Montanya Troubles
Cause a Long Supreme
Court Opinion.
A DEFENDANT'S LUCKY ESCAPE.
He Got Away Before Suit Was Filed
and Pleaded Lack of Juris
diction.
The Supreme Court has passed upon
some Interesting points in divorce law
while deciding the divorce matters be
tween Lorraine de la Montanya and James
de ]a Montanya Jr.
The case is a celebrated one on account
of the prominence of the parties to the
suit and of the peculiar charges made and
circumstances surrounding it. The com
plaint was filed two days after the defend- j
ant left for Europe, taking with him his ;
two children. There was no personal sum
mons possible, so an attempt was made to
establish constructive summons by publi- j
cation. De la Montanya went direct to j
Paris, arriving there on December 19, 1893,
and on July 14, 1894, he applied for and
was given permisHion by the French Min
uter of Justice to domicile himself in
France.
In the suit commenced two days after
t he defendant's departure the claim was j
made that he left the State for the express
purpose of evading the court's jurisdiction. |
The default of De la Montanya was en- ]
tered, the cause was tried, and on May 10, i
1894, judgment was rendered for the plain- j
tiff. The judgment was that the marriage j
be dissolved, that the care of the children 1
be awarded to the plaintiff, and that she j
should at any time have the right to ap
ply to the court for suitable allowance j
from the defendant.
On September 7, 1894. the defendant |
moved for an order vacating this judg- I
ment in so far as it related to the support '
of the plaintiff, to the care and custody of >
the children, and so far as it related to â 
alimony. This motion was based upon I
the claim that the court had no jurisdic
tion over the subject matter or over the
person of the defendant, as he was and
had since the beginning of the action been
outside of the t>tate, and no process or
summons had ever been served upon him,
and that the children were not at the be
ginning of the action, and had not been, j
in California. This motion was denied, i
and upon an appeal from that denial the j
case came before the Supreme Court. The I
Supreme Court has reversed this ruling i
and has directed the trial court to grant
the motion.
On appeal De la Montanya based his
plea for a reversal of the order on three j
grounds: First, that the proof of publi- I
cation showed that constructive service i
had never been had according to the laws j
of this State, and therefore the judg- |
ment was void; second, the defend- i
ant and children at the time of ;
the attempted service of summons
were domiciled in France and therefore !
the courts of this State had no jurisdiction j
to award the custody of those children to
the plaintiff, or to award alimony, and j
third, that the mere fact that the defend- |
ant and the children were outside of the !
State at the commencement of the action
deprived the State courts of jurisdiction,
even admitting that the children were
domiciled in California and the construc
tive service of summons was in all re
spects regular.
The plaintiff admitted the facts in re- j
gard to the departure of the defendant
irom tne State with the children, but !
claimed that as a matter of fact and of ;
law the children had always been domi- !
ciled in California, and she contended that i
such being the case the court acquired j
jurisdiction, not only to grant the divorce |
to her, but to enter a judgment against ;
the defendant valid at least in California.
She also contended that the judgment I
awarding to her the custody of the chil- j
dren was valid, because it was an incident j
to the divorce, and that upon a dissolution
of the marriage it was necessary to pro- i
vide for the children. Furthermore she
contended there was no judgment for ali
mony or allowance of any kind.
The Supreme Court says that, conced- I
inj; the defendant and the children were
ail domiciled in California, although in
fact absent from the State at tne time of
the commencement of the action, and
since then, and that the constructive ser
vice of summons was sufficient to give the
court jurisdiction, the court did not have
the power to award the plaintiff the ex
clusive custody of the children and allow
alimony. To concede that the judgment
was good would be to allow the invasion
of one State by the process-servers of an
other. A process cannot go beyond a
State and compel any person there to re
tutn to the State wherein the action was
being brought and there make his defense.
As well might a citizen of a foreign State
be summoned from its borders for the
same purpose. If such things could be
done there would be no one to determine
the particular domicile of any person.
Domicile often depends upon secret inten
tion, and such a test would be most un
satisfactory.
It has been often said by courts that
domicile is the test of jurisdiction in di
vorce matters, but the Supreme Court
holds that this doctrine has been built up
mainly, if not entirely, to prevent parties
really residing in a State from going else
where for the purpose of getting a divorce. I
Domicile and actual residence do not al
ways coincide, the court notes, and the i
question is asked, "Wuere, then, does the j
jurisdiction rest?" Jurisdiction, the
opinion continues, is derived from the
constitution and laws creating the court,
and there is no limitation in the constitu
tion of the United States upon the power
of a State to pive to its courts jurisdiction
over all persons found within its borders.
Domicile is the test of personal rights in
regard to inheritance, but unless made so
by local law it is not important as affecting
the relations of the individual to the Gov
ernment. The relations of the individual
to the Government depends upon actual
presence within the territorial limits of a
country and upon citizenship or allegiance.
Referring to the contention of the re
spondent that the decree was valid as to
children and alimony, although the ser
vice was constructive and personal judg
ment could not be rendered as incident to
the divorce, the opinion says that it can
not properly be said that there was a de
fendant in the case ; that the summons was
not a writ to bring the defendant iuto
court, but a notice that proceedings were
pending against him. It brought the case
into court, but not the defendant, and the
adjudication must be confined to that
status of affairs.
Regarding the children the court says
the court may award their custody to one
of the parents. It is a mode of appointing
a guardian which is always a matter of lo
cal control regardless of the legal domicile
of the children, if domicile and residence
do not coincide.
, The opinion then states that the denial
of the order should be reversed, and di
rects the court below to grant the defend
ant's motion.
Justice McFarland filed a dissenting
opinion in which he criticized the ruling
of the majority of the bench. In the course
of his comments he said:
AH that is necessary to be determined by
this case is that a citizen and resident of Cali
fornia cannot escape the performance of his
duties and baffle our courts in their attempts
to enforce the rights of others against him by
sudden flight and temporary absence expressly
intended for that purpose. Every rule of law
and every sentiment of justice is an obstruc
tion to the success of such strategy.
Justice Van Fleet and Chief Justice
Beatty concurred in McFarland 's opinion.
The prevailing opinion was written by Jus
tice Temple, Justices Harrison, Garoutte
and rienshaw concurring.
A BICYCLE THIEF.
H. BT. Hafford, a Sailor, Charged With
Felony Embezzlement.
H. M. Hafford, a sailor, was arrested yes
terday afternoon by Detectives Bee and
Harper and had four charges of felony em
bezzlement booked against him at the
City Prison.
Hafford was short of cash and became
possessed of the idea that it would be a
good way to raise money to hire a bicycle
and pawn it. He visited four different
nrms and hired a bicycle from each, which
were pawned for $15 apiece.
Two of the dealers were Backus & Co.
and T. H. B. Varney, and they complained
to the police. Bee and Harper were de
tailed on the case and soon obtained a de
scription of the man who pawned the
"bikes,'' which was followed by his arrest.
The four bicycles were recovered.
Hafford's statement that he was a sailor
was simply a blind. He was at one time a
letter-carrier and later manager of a cy
clery at the end of McAllister street.

THE RIGHT OF
FREE SPEECH
Interesting Decision in the
Case of William
Daily.
CRIME OF THE CENTURY
It Should Not Have Been Nipped
in the Bud by the
Court.
THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.
A Man's Right to Speak, Write or
Publish Must Not Be Abridged
in Any Way.
Judge Murphy went far beyond his
jurisdiction when he stopped the produc
tion of ."The Crime of the Century" during
the Durrant triaL He was too previous.
He should have waited until the piece was
actually staged and the curtain up before
he exerted the power which the Jaw gives
him. This is the substance of the opinion
of the Supreme Court in the case of Wil
liam R. Daily, who sued for a writ of.
certiorari to have Judge Murphy's wrong
ful ruling set aside.
Everyone remembers the Durrant case
and the scheme of Daily and others to
make it the theme of a play to be pro
duced while the case was pending. Dur
rant's counsel strenuously objected, and
the result wag an order from Judge Murphy
forbiddine the production of the play.
This order was appealed from, and prepa
rations for the play were continued. Be
fore the Darrant trial commenced the
opening night came, and the Alcazar
Theater was crowded to the doors. The
audience was thickly dotted with Deputy
Sheriffs, however, and when the curtain
rose and the play was well under way the'
Deputy Sheriffs went on the stage and
arrested the whole company on warrants
for contempt of court. They were all re
leased on bail and the appeal to the
Supreme Court prevented further pro
ceedings against them on the contempt
charge. Under the decision of yesterday,
however, the contempt charge need not
worry the actor? much.
The text of the opinion, which was writ
. ten by Jtutiee Garoutte, deals with the
right of free speech. He holds thai no
man shall be restrained from speaking,
writing or publishing his sentiments, but
he must be responsible for his utterances
afterward. In the opinion the court says:
The production of a tragedy or comedy npon
the theatrical stasre is a publication to the
world by word of mouth of toe text of the au
thor, and as to the question here presented lor
our consideration it is immaterial whether the
words be publicly spoken from the since or
upon the busting?, or go to the world through
the channels of the printing preps. By the
constitutional provision we are about to in
voke a citizen may speak, write or publish his |
â¢sentiment* with equal freedom, and this case !
now stands before us exactly Â«.â¢ though one of 'â 
the daily journals was threatening to publish
its sentiments pertaining to the conduct of a
criminal trial. then, pending, and .the court <
where such trial was pending and in progress,
believing tod) publication would inter/ere
with the due administration of justice, had
issued an order restraining and prohibiting
the threatened action of the paper.
We are entirely clear that the court has no â 
Jurisdiction to make the order which forms the â¢
basis (it tnis proceeding, for such order was an
attempted infringement -upon rights guar
antee'! to every citizen by section 9 of article !
I of the constitution of the Slate. That sec
tion provides: "Every citizen may freely !
speak, write and publish his sentiment on all
subjects, being responsible for the abuse of
that right, and no law thai; be passed'to re
strain or abridge thÂ« liberty of speech or of
the press." The wording of this section is
terse and vigorous", and itÂ« meaning so plain
that construction is not reeded. The right of
the citizen to freely speak, write and publish
his sentiment* is unlimited, bat he is responsi
ble to the law lor an abuse of that right. He
snail have no censor over him to whom he
mustapplr for permission to speak, write or
publish, but be shall be held accountable to
the law for what he speaks, what he writes or
what he publishes. It is patent that this right
to speak, write end publish cannot be abused
until it is exercised, ana before it is exercised
there can be no responsibility. The purpose of
this provision of the constitution was the
abolishment of censorship, and for courts to
act as censors is directly violative of that pur
pose. This provision of the constitution as 10
freedom of speech varies somewhat from that
of the constitution (A tbe United States, and
also more or leu from the provisions of many
State constitutions treating of this question,
but If there is a material difference In the
various provisions it -works no harm to this
petitioner, for the provision here considered is
the broader and gives him greater liberty in
the exercise of the right granted.
The court then quotes Blackstone as
saying "the liberty of the press consists in
laying no previous restraints upon publi
cations, and not in freedom from censure
for criminal "matters when published.
Every freeman has an undoubted right to
lay what sentiments he pleases before the
public: to forbid this is to destroy the free- j
dom of the press. But if be publishes
what is improper, mischievous or illegal he
must take the consequences of his own
temerity. To subject the press to the
restrictive power of a licensor, as was
formerly done, before and since the revolu
tion of 1688, is to subject all freedom of

: sentiment â to tbe * prejudices of one man,
and lcikes him the arbitrary and infallible
eange of ail controverted points in learning,
| religion and government." :
; Story is clso quoted in a . similar vein
j and also De Lolme. Continuing then the
opinion says: .
| In effect the order made by the trial "court in
j this case wss one commanding the, petitioner
not to corcmi: a contemp of court, and such a
j practice is novel in the extreme. The court
had ample power to protect itself in the &d-
I ministration 01 justice after the contempt was
I committed. - As to the offender it could punish
i him; as to tbe defendant on trial be could be
deprived of no right* by any act of this peti
tioner.^ If the publication deprived him of a
fair and impartial trial, a second trial would
have been awarded him. .
We conclude that the order made by the
I trial court wts an attempted restraint upon
the right of tree speech, as guaranteed by tbe
constitution of tbe State, and that petitioner's
mouth could not be closed in advance for the
purpose of preventing an utterance of his
j sentiments/, however s miscnievous the pros
; pective results of such utterance. He bad the
I rieht of free speech, but at all times was re
sponsible to the law for an . abuse of that
; right..
For tbe foregoing reasons the order is an
nulled as being beyond tne power of the court
to make.
Judge McFarland then comes forward
with a short dissenting opinion. He says:
I dissent. All tbe provisions of the constitu
tion must be construed together and effect
given, when possible, to each. The one (sec
tion 9 of articie I), which provides that every
citizen may fairly speak, etc., is to be con
strued in view o: that large and important
part of the constitution by which a judicial
department of the Government is ;erected. and
all the usual and necessary powers of; courts
given to ; the tribunals established under it.
One of tbe most essential of these powers of a .
court -to protect itself against unlawful in
trusion upon its orderly conduct of business
and to insure litfeants "in a pending proceed
ing the full and unembarrassed administration
of justice. In the case at bar, in a court of
record established by the constitution, a trial
wes gravely progressing, In which a man's life
was at stake, and an act was about to be done i
which it is admitted â¢'would be an interference I
with the administration of justice and deprive
him of a fair and impartial trial."
Is it possible that a court is powerless to pro-
WHERE WARREN & MALLEY'S CAMP COOK FEEDS, FATTENS AND FRIES HIS PIGS.
tect a defendant in a case pending before it
from an act that would deprive him of a fair
and impartial trial? In my opinion the power
given by section 9 of Article I, not to be
stopr-t I beforehand from speaking slander and
writing libels, does not include the right not
to be stppped from interfering in a pending
proceeding in a court and preventing a party
thereto from having a lair and impartial trial.
The right to slander and libel individuals and
the right of a court to prevent Interference
with the course of justice in a pending trial
are not inconsistent and may both stand to
gether. And I think that the cases where it
has been held that a threatened publication
could not be enjoined will be found to be
nearly all threatened cases of threatened libels
against individuals or property, and not cases
where there waj a threatened interference
with a pending proceeding in a court and an
attempt to deprive a party thereto of a fair
and impartial trial.
I think the order under review should be
: affirmed.
Justice Temple concurs with Justice Mc-
Farland in his dissenting opinion.
THE BUILDERS' EXCHANGE
A Disturbiog Resolution Ex
pected at the Election
Meeting To-Day.
Masons Say the Carpenters Can No
Longer Take Contracts for All
the Work.
The Builders' Exchange will meet and
hold its annual election of officers to-day.
Though the scheduled business of the
meeting is confined to the naming of the
men who are to be at the helm of the
organization and direct its affairs during
the following year, some trepidation has
been manifest on the part of some of the
trades composing the exchange.
It is all due to the practice which has
prevailed here for years among the car
penter contractors of taking building con
tracts as a whole and subletting contracts
for the masonry, painting and plumbing
work.
The carpenter contractors are afraid a
resolution would be introduced at the meet-
In? to-day relative to this method.
'But the carpenters are beaten anyway,"
said a prominent member of the exchange
yesterday, "and they need not fear the
introduction of any such motion. The
masons are too strong and the other trades
can take care of themselves. You see the
reason for this is that in times past the
carpenter contractors have been in the
habit of taking contracts as a whole, and
after getting figures for the mason, plumb
ing, painting and other work on which to j
base their b:ds, they i.aye peddled the sab
contracts out. Advantage was taken of
the plumber, the painter, the plasterer
and the mason who furnished the esti
mates. Instead of giving the work to the
io en whose figures enabled them to secure
the contract the work was virtually put
up at unction, using the original estimates
as a bait.
'â¢By that means, it is plain to be seen, the
carpenter contractors doubled their own
profits, and, while keeping down those of
the other trades, also took advantage of
the builder because of the cheap character
of the work furnished."
"The wooden ai?e has passed in this
City," remarked the well-known Contrac
tor* McCarty. "The masons are now in
the ascendency, and it is nÂ«i longer possi
ble for the woodworking contractors to
dominate the other trades. If a resolution
favoring a continuance of the old system
shouid be presented at the meeting to-day
on behalf of the carpenters, it would be
defeated by an overwhelming vote. We
are in the brick and stone age now, and
these trades cannot be dominated."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
AN EXEMPT HOG RANCH
The Pens of Warren & Malley
at the Foot of Laguna
Street.
ARE WITHIN THE "COW LIMITS"
Yet the Cook Feeds and Fattens and
Finally Fries the Adipose Porker
Unmolested.
Warren & Mallay. tbe contractors, have
'â  a grading camp where the northern end of
:.a street dips down into the bay.
From 100 to 200 men with their grading
teams live there and a cook feeds the
laborers in a butlike dining-room. "When
his human boarders are not spreading the
sandhills around tbat part of the town he
feeds twenty-one boas that have their
habitat in several pens behind the stable?.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals wculd never find a reason to
throw the aegis of the law over tbat mena
gerie. Those swine are rotund with care,
and their custodian is humane in his
treatment of them, except when he puts
'. his knife into their squealing throats and
1 stills their treble protests forever.
But while the twenty-one bog.Â« have no
â¢ complaint to make until the shadow of
j the butcher falls sinisterly athwart the
pen, the City of San Francisco, which is
the larger part of their environment, does
not phare in the joys of their existence.
In fact, the municipality LÂ», in effect, look
ing obiiquely at those twenty and one in
terloping swine and wondering why they
are There.
Possibly it has never occurred to Messrs.
Warren and Malley that a vie by reason
of his peculiarly insanitary disposition is
lefused a residence, alive, within those
lines known as the "cow limits."
After his interview with the butcher the
bog becomes more savory and more fit for
society and may come in. Warren &
MalJey appear to have neglected to know
tHat on November 10, 1891, the Supervisors
passed an ordinance prohibiting the keep
ing of swine an<i more than two cows
within certain portions of the City, and
al^i that by reason of its location" their
hog ranch has no legal existence in the
pla'-e it occupies.
The fact seems to have faded also from
the minds of the health inspectors, but
some leniency may be shown these
oihciails, working as they are amiQ the
odors of South San Francisco.
Some time ago a man named Krause
was the owner and keepor of several pips,
styed alongside of his tumble-down shack
near the foot of Octavia street. The grunts
of the proscripted porkers were heard by
the neighbors and the sanitary officials
soon made those pens "to let!" But a
couple of hundred yards away, across the
sand lot, the Warren & Malley pig col
ony existed unmolested. Krause, bereft
of his snoats by the stern mandate of the
law, found comfort in the society of his
goat, which was eligible to the territory
within tbe "cow limits," but the graders'
cook could feed, fatten and fry his pets ad
libitum, and no health inspector came 10
mar his joys from the day the pigÃ entered
that unlawful pen till tuey went into the
pork-barrel.
So the hog ranch of Warren <fc Malley
is permitted to spread its flavors on the
City air, where the northern end of
Laguna street comes down to the bay,
notwithstanding an ordinance which
says that swine must not be kept there,
and residents in that neighborhood are
asking why. They wish to know why the
contractors should be exempt from a
health order when Krause's pigs, a few
steps away, suffered exile?
EJECTED FROM THE CAR
W. E. Hanson's Fault Was Not
Understanding Our Trans
fer System.
He Did Not Know That He Was
Required to Wait on the Transfer
Agent at a Certain Point.
Because W. E. Hanson of 813 Laguna
street did not understand the transfer
scheme of the Market-street Railway
system he was forcibly ejected from one of
the cars of the McAllister-street line yes
terday morning.
Mr. Hanson, who is a commercial
agent and is out of the City a great deal of
the time, in explaining how it all hap
pened said :
"I went out of the City on the 18th of
last February and only returned a few days
aeo. Previous to that time I frequently
rode on the McAllister-street line, trans
ferred to Third street and then again
from Third street to McAllister. I was
not aware that there had, during my ab
sence, been any change in the manner of
transfers. I rode down as usual this morn
ing and was given a transfer that was ac
cepted on a car of the Third-street line.
On ray return when between Mission and
Market the conductor called out. "Trans
fers to the Market-street line,' and when I
put out my hand be gave me a blue ticket
which I did not examine, supposing it was
a transfer similar to those I had been re
ceiving. I boarded a McAllister-street car
j which at that very moment came aionjr,
and wben tbe car had proceeded about '
half a block I handfd my ticket to the
conductor. w,.0 said: 'Ueie. you'll have
to po bacc anu get a transfer.'* To this I
â  said: "That's the transfer tbe Third-street
conductor gave me.'
"The conductor told me that if I did not
get off and get a transfer he would pat me
off. lam well known in this community,
tbe car was full of ladies and I felt burt to
be in a way chargea witb trying to beat
1 the railway company out of 5 cents. I
â¢ told the conductor that I bad paid my
i fare and had offered him what had been
; given me at tbe time transfers were issned.
Tdereupon he stopped the car and with
the assistance of ihe motorman forcibly
ejected me, but not beiore I had obtained
the names of several witnesses. They
used considerable force to put me off. but
: I did not offer any resistance. In the ex
citement I did not take the number of the
t car. but I have been informed that it was
No. 2.55."
The ticket given Mr. Hanson has
printed upon its face the following in smail
type:
Take notice this check is not a transfer and
will not be received for a iare. Immediately
upon the arrival of this car at Thrrd and Mar
ket street* this check should be canded to the
transfer aeent at that corner by the passenger
to whom issued, who should also notify such
egentas to direction in which it is desired to
continue the trip, via a Market-street cable
line, naming the particular line preferred, if
any. j. L. WillcCTT.
This check is not transferable.
"There is more on this ticket,' ' continued
Mr. Hanson, ''than a person can well read
in the time from which it is delivered until
the car comes to a stop, and in the ca<e of
a stranser in the City unacquainted with
the different car Jineshow is he going to
tell w-uat particular line he prefers?
"I believe that I have a good cause of
action against the company arid will con
sult an attorney with a view of bringing
suit."

FOR NATIVE PRODUCTS
The Manufacturers' and Pro

a Protest.
Does Not Wish English and Eastern
Purveyors to Supply the
Insane Asylum.
Californian products .and manufactures
are not to be releeated to a back seat if the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
can help it. Hearing that the State in
sane asylum at Naj.a was about to accept
bids from English and Eastern purveyors
for certain supplies to be used in that in
stitution, the association =e:it the follow
ing letter to tbe trustees of the association :
San Francisco, March 23, 1896.
To the Board nf Tru*tK* of the yapa State Aty
lum for the Interneâ Gentlemen: We notice in
the advertisement calling for bids for supplies
for the asylum recently published in the
papers that Crosse & Blackwell's olive oil is
specified, as well as Duryea's laundry starch.
The matter of "patronizing home indus
tries" has been heretofore brought to the at
tention of your honorable boar>t ki a letter
sent from this office, and we therefore feel that
it is unnecessary for us to go into details on
the subject in this letter.
We would, however, most respectfully call
your attention to the fact that both the arti
cles named are manufactured in this Srate,
and that such output has ao superior in the
world, and would request that you so alter
these specifications as to .give the California
manufacturers and producers an opportunity
to bid on the same.
We would alfo respectfully request that in
awarding the contract for these supplies, close
attention be paid to the bids iron? California
manufacturers and producers, and where qual
ity and prices are found to be equal (ax it will
be in almost every case) the preference be
given to such California manufacture or
product.
Knowing that your honorable board is com
posed of public-spirited men, who are inter
ested in the community In which they live, we
feel assured that this matter will be given the
consideration it deserves, and that our request
on behalf of California manufacturers and pro
ducers will be granted.
Thanking you, I am, for the association,
yours truly, L. R. Mead, Secretary.
On the same date a communication was
sent by the association to Governor Budd.
calling his attention to the promises made
by him to the effect that he would do ail
in his power to protect and nid local man
ufactures and industries, and reproducing
an extract from the Napa Journal of the
2istinst., wherein the admission of the
English and Eastern bids is noticed.
The result of this important corre
spondence is anxiously awaited by the
members of the Manufacturers' and Pro

men.

AN ACTOR'S REAL TEARS.
E. J. Buckley Deeply Moved by
the Loving Efforts of His
Friends.
A Notable Aggregation Plays for
Love at the Baldwin With
Entire Snccess.
At the Baldwin on Sunday afternoon the
benefit given by his brother actors to E. J.
Buckley was a labor of love and was
abundantly rewarded.
The house was crowded from orchestra
to chandelier. Actors on one side of the
footlights did their utmost to win applause,
and actors on the other were first to lead
the applause that always came.
And yet it was no labor, for as dear old
Ed Buckiey said in nis touchine words at
the end:
"An actor would rather act than eat, and
yet I thank you all that you have acted
forme."
The proceeds of the afternoon were
$1132; the expenses amounted only to
$60 15. This included the cost of flowers,
extra musicians, carnage hire and
printing.
The flower girls received for selling pro
grammes and boutonnieres $92 95. They
were Misses Kay Lennwood, Vera Worden
and Bessie Emmet of the Tivoli company,
and Misses Charlotte Crane and Elsiner
Davie of the Texas-Steer Company.
Everything was tendered Jree, "from the
trilling ot the star to the perspiration of
the stage hand. The first act of Hoyt's
"A Milk White Flag" was rendered with
hilarious vim ; the sextet from "Lucia," by
the Tivoli Opera Company, was accom
panied by the entire Tivoli orchestra. The
remainder of the excellent programme was
as follows, with tbe exception of Billy
Ker^ands. who was detained at Ravwarcts :
Gilbert and Goldie (by kind permission of
Walter Morocco, Grand Opera-house).
Charles B. Ward, the Bowery boy (by kind

"I have not been on the stage before in i

it is because I am trying to make the best '
!of this opportunity." Ending, he com- \

M. A. Pinto, the pioneer musician, was

The sight was one seldom seen in San

musicians, for they nearly ali responded
and gave their dead comrade a melodious

The interment was in Laurel Hill Ceme

Stake Cleverly.
MAGNET STRUCK A SOFT SPOT.
Eddie Jones Got Lobenguia Home a
Handy Winnerâ Babe Murphy
Again in Front.
There seems to be no end of fast two
year-olds the present season in California.
Yesterday another very promising miss
bobbed to the surface in Fleur de Lis, who
captured the racinjr stake for fillies in im- !
rressive fashion, tripping the four furlongs
in 49)4 secondi. The event was worth
$700 to the winner, and eleven highly tried
fillies sported the colors. When the
betting finally settled the Burns & Water
house pair, Rowena B and Alma, and the
Pueblo stable's entries, Dolore and Dura,
coupled in the betting! -were each held at
Bto 5. Against Fleur de Lis 15 to 1 was
first quoted, but reports of fast private
trials were whispered about, and the
bookies were gradually obliged to rub
until 5 to 1 was the best posted. Love
light, the Del Monte stable's entry, and
Whirlwind were also backed down several
points. There was but slight delay at the
post, the gate sending them away nicely
aligned. Rowena B and the 500 to 1 shot,
Jerilderio, made the running to the bend
for home, with Fieur de Lis showing in
third position full of run. Chorn, on the
latter, was not long in taking the lead,
and, although inclined somewhat to
swerve, the daughter of Maxim finished
well iv hand, a length before Dura, who
nipped the place from Rowena B the last
few jumps.
The sport throughout was excellent, the
card being the best offered racegoers for
some days. It was a disastrous day for
favorites, the odds on Magnet, who "cake
walked" in for the handicap, and the luke
warm choice Snowdown being the only
successful ones.
Probably the most startling surprise of
the day was the win of Ruinart in the
opening event, a cheap six-furlong selling
dash, with anywhere from 60 to 80 to 1 ob
tainable about him. On Monday the sta
ble played the big colt for a "killing," but
let him run loose yesterday. Piggott had
the leg up and, showing in the lead almost
from the start, won driving, a head in
front of Pollock. The 11 to 5 favorite,
Jack Atkins, finished in the show.
Races run over the inside course are
notorious for dumps, and the mile run
that followed the long- priced outsider's
victory was no exception. Louis Ezell's
black horse Dungarven carried the bulk of
the coin bet, going to the post a 2 to 1 fa
vorite and he failed to even "look in."
One of the second choices, Sea eJpray, had
the call until the wire was nearly reached,
when Shaw on the 12 to 1 shot Tar and
Tartar, who had been running in second
position, went to wors on his mount and
by clever riding landed him winner by a
head. The well-backed May Day was a
good third.
A mile purse race with five starters
that "was fourth on the programme was a
splendid speculating ' affair. Bettors
seemed divided between Yankee Doodle
and Lobenguia, though at the close the
former i eld sway at 3 to 2. The third
choice. Sir Vassar, played quite a promi
nent part in the running. Garner took
him to the front and he led until within a
sixteenth from the wire, where Jones on
Lobenguia sent his mount along and won
cleverly by a head in 1:41%. The favorite
was lapped on Sir Vassar.

TIME GROWS SHORTER.
To-Morrow, Possibly To-Day, "Wil
End That Unique Dictionary
Distribution.
Yesterday was a red-letter day in the
history of t^e Pacific Coast Newspaper
Syndicate, and clearly vindicated the wis
dom of the course adopted to secure favor
: able publicity for the new Encyclopedic
Dictionary.
Controlling the publication for this sec
tion of the country the Syndicate felt that
the best possible way to make known the
merits of the new reference work was to
distribute a limits number of sets in cul
tured homes, where it could be compared
with other dictionaries and cyclopedias.
It was not proposed to give away the
four volumes of over 5000 pages, but to
place them upon a merely nominal figure,
and also provide particularly easy terms of
payment, so that no person earnestly de
sirous of possessing the work would be
prevented from so doing on account of the
money involved. One dollar in cash and
$1 25 per month for one year is the liberal
arrangement, the full set of books being
delivered immediately on making the first
payment.
Inspection of the work at Syndicate
headquarters, 36 Montgomery street, was
also invited, while out-of-town readers to
whom the volumes were delivered were
allowed to return them within ten days if
not precisely as represented.
Applications came in briskly from the
very start, and immediately deliveries
were made, and far from any of the vol
umes being returned, congratulations and
thanks have been freely coming in from all
quarters.
But the end of this notable distribution
now draws near, for the 500 introductory
sets will very soon be allottedâ possibly to
day ; surely to-morrow.
Those desiring to participate in the dis
tribution will therefore be obliged to act
promptly, which will be much to their ad
vantage, since the regular subscription
price of $42 per set will prevail after the
introductory sets are all bespoken.
ALL ABOUT A PICTURE.
J. H. Maloney In Suing Marceau for
Big Damages.
J. H. Maloney is suing Theodore C. Mar
ceau for $50,000 damages for malicious ar
rest and false imprisonment.
Maloney says in his complaint that in
March, 1895, just as he was starting East,
he was arrested and brought back to an
swer a suit instituted against him by Mar
ceau, in which it was sought to recover
$233 for pictures. Maloney says he had
some small pictures taken by Marceau,
and after they were done Marceau wanted
him to have a large picture made. He de
clined, and Marceau said he would make
it anyway and Maloney could have it for
$100. It was made, Maloney declined it,
and just as he was starting East he was
arrested. He paid the money, he says, to
avoid delay, but when he demanded it
back again on his return it was refused
him ; hence his suit.
Crushed in a Press.
Joseph Jenkins, a boy employed by the Bos
qui Engraving and Printing Company, 523
Clay street, had his right hand badly crushed
yesterday morning by one of the presses. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Buirnell amputated the index finger and
expressed the opinion that it might be neces
sary to amputate two other fingers.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1896.
EUREKA TRADE AT STAKE
Merchants Take a Determined
Stand Against Alleged
Discrimination.
FAIR COMPETITION* FAVORED.
Traffic Manager Curtis Calls Atten
tion to the Monopoly-Bound
Position of This Port.
At the meetins yesterday of the joint
committee representing the six most in
fluential commercial organizations of this
City which are endeavoring to secure a
readjustment of rates to Eureka that will
do away with the alleged discrimination
against San Francisco and in favor of Port
land, it was decided to again communicate
with Goodall, Perkins & Co. asking them
to make a direct and definite reply to the
letter of the committee in which the steam
ship people were requested to adjust rates
to Eureka from Portland and San Fran
cisco respectively on a mileage basis.
Their first reply was considered to be
evasive, and further action on the part of
the merchants was deferred until the ex
pected reply is received.
Traffic Manager W. B. Curtis of the Trai
fic Association, who has given the situa
tion particular attention, spoke thus of it
yesterday :
This controversy between Goodall, Perkins &
Co. and the mercnants of San Francisco was
brought about through the competition of the j
North Pacific Steamship Company, which owns
and operates the steamers Alice Blanchard
and Empire. Goodall, Perkins & Co. are the
general agents of the Oregon Railway and i
Navigation Company, and mat company can- j
not brook that an opposition line should live '
between San Francisco and Portland, Or. ; in
fact they have for years past, been able to suc
cessfully down all opposition, but in the
opinion of the Traffic Association that state of
affairs cannot be perpetuated.
In brief the history of the present competi
tion is us follows: The steamers Empire and
Alice Blanchard were engaged in the lumber
trade between Portland and points on the
Columbia River south of Portland and San
Francisco. These vessels always had loads
southbound, and always at rates much higher '
than $1 per ton, and naturally sought loads j
northbound, and the fact that they should be i
able to secure a pound of freight northbound I
was a thorn in the side ot the Oregon Railway !
and Navigation Company and Goodall, Perkins j
& Co., who deeming it time that this opposi
tion should be crushed, began a war in'rates I
and deliberately dropped their rates to $1 per |
ton weight or measurement, which move was j
naturally followed by the opposition.
It is stated by Goodall, Perkins & Co. in their '
letter of the 20th lnst. that the rate of $1 per
ton, Portland to Eureka, was put in by the
Portland people when it was learned that a
similar rate \va< in effect from San Francisco
to Eureka.
Edward Goodall stated before a committee
In the Board of Trade rooms that the steamer
South Coast was put on the route from Port
land by the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company lor the express purpose of running
the Empire and Alice Blanchard off the route.
She was the first to reduce rates to the
ridiculous ligure of $ 1 per ton from Portland
south.
It has been demonstrated conclusively, time
and time again, to the San Francisco merchant
that a transportation company having a mo
nopoly will make or break the trade of a city I
as best suits its purpose. Sentiment cuts no !
more of a figure in the transportation business |
than in mercantile pursuits, and Goodall, Per
kins & Co., as superintendents of the ocean
division of the Oregon Railway and Naviga
tion Company, will aid and abet that company
in the furtherance of its beat interests, not
ours.
It ig unnatural to nresume that any one
steamer line can, for all time to come, alone do
justice to the growing trade of this City. Our
northern neighbors are loud in the acclaim
that "given the ship.s and irade will follow";
and it is the slogan that we should adopt. It
is a precept worthy of emulationâ it points the
way to the only open road free from the ruts
in which we are at present traveling.
The merchant of Ban Francisco complains
that there is no elasticity to his trade. And
why is it ? A glance at the transportation fa
cilities to a-nd from San Francisco shows every
avenue dominated by a mono_poly. Inland we
have but one railway. To the south we have j
both a steamer and a rail, which are combined I
in an agreement as to rates, operating to re- j

strict San Francisco's trade. To the north the
same state of affairs has been long in existence,
the rail and steamer lines having agreed as to
rates.
When the Northern Pacific Railroad, the pio
neer line to Portland, was completed, 8&n
Francisco began to lose trade in Oregon and
Washington. At that time the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company was dependent
on San Francisco for support, but later, when
that company completed its line to a junction
with the Oiegon bhort Line at Huntington,
Or., its best interests no longer lay in fostering
our trade. It had become a trauscontinental
carrier. It sought the overland haul from the
East to Portland. Or., and gave to that city all
sorts of accommodations, in order to make it
the great depot of supplies for that upper coun
try. Later the Southern Pacific Company's
Shasta route was finished to Portland, Or.
Next, we find all of these lines combined in an
agreement to maintain rates.
Rates on dry-goods, clothing, etc., ior exam
ple, advanced between San Francisco and
Portland from $5 per ton to $13 per ton, and
other articles through the whole line in pro
portion. Rates from San Francisco to interior
Oregon and Washington were placed so much
higher from San Francisco than from Portland
that the balance of the profitable trade of San
Francisco went by the board.
From a strict business point of view there Is
no odium attached to these actions on the part
of the transportation companies, since it must
be admitted that they are in the business for
all there is to be made irom it.
But now comes the merchant of San Fran
cisco after a survey ol the situation and deter
mines that an opposition line between San
Francisco and Portland would tend to hold
rates down to a oasis that will permit him to
regain some of his lost trade, yet which would
yield a fair return to the transportation com
pany for the service rendered.
The older transportation companies cry out
against this action and deem it an unfriendly
act on the part of their former patrons. They
forget that they have never consulted the
wishes of those patrons when joining some
combination for the express purpose of squeez
ing them, and when they speak disparagingly
of their less pretentious but ambitious com
petitors we would remind them that "tall oaks
Irom little acorns grow" and that it may yet
be a bright star in the great galaxy which we
hope and trust ere long may serve to aggrandize
this port. __________^___
CRUELTY TO CHILDREN.
Parents of Three Different Families
Arrested, Two for Neglect and
One for Violence.
Secretary Kane of the Pacific Coast So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
j Children and Policeman Coleman arrested
I two families last night and took them to
the City Prison.
Charles Patterson, a longshoreman liv
ing at 172 Clementina street, and his wife,
Maggie, have been addicted todrinK, and
their two little boys, John, five years of
age, and Charles, two years of age, have in
consequence been shamefully neglected.
The parents were detained' at the City
Prison on the charge of cruelty, and the
! two boys were sent to the Receiving
| Hospital. They presented a pitiable ap
; pearance.
Elizabeth Rousch, 1147 Stevenson street,
| has a family of four young children â Mary,
' 9 years of age, Arthur, 7. Flora, 5, and
I Willie, 3. Her husband left her some time
| ago to go to the mines. She is never sober,
i and the children have been cared for by
kind neighbors. She was charged with
cruelty to children, and the children will
be sent to one of the public institutions.
Another case was that of Joseph Ault, a
clerk, who was arrested on Howard street
by Policeman Coleman on a warrant for
cruelty to a minor child. On Saturday
one of bis children went to the toilet-room
and its foot got caught in a hole in the
floor. The child cried with pain and Ault
struck it in the mouth with hia clenched
fish, knocking three of its teeth down its
throat an.l cutting and bruising the lips.
Judge Low had fixed his bonds at $2000,
but Judge Conlan released him on his
own recognizance.

VANDERBILT COMING.
General Manager Kruttschnitt Went to
New Orleans to Meet Him.
All the gentlemen who left the City on
the 7th inst., to accompany General
Manager Kruttschnitt on a tour of inspec
tion of the Southern Pacific Railroad, re
turned yesterday, after having gone over
I 2300 miles by daylight and finding every
thing in first-class condition.
They parted company with Mr, Krutt
schnitt at the Ecos viaduct, about 400
miles east of El Paso, the general manager
of the Southern Pacific continuing on to
New Orleans, where he will meet William
K. Vanderbilt and Ghauncey M. Depew of
the New York Central Railroad, who are
coming on to this Coast. Mr. Kruttschnitt
will accompany them on the westbound

TANGERMAN TO STAY OUT
Miners Are Willing to Accept
Any Other Superinten
dent.
The Hale & Norcross Management
Has Decided to Appoint An
other Man.
Jere Lynch, the new president of the
Hale & Norcross Mining Company, is still '
reticent to outsiders concerning the plans
and purposes of the management in con
nection with the working of the mine.
From indirect sources it is ascertained
that the directors have decided to turn
down Tangerman. Should the police au
thorities of Virginia City, sustained by the
National Guard of Nevada, guarantee Mr.
Tangerman the amplest protection, his
Acting Governor Rein! o'd Sadler of Nevada, Who Declined to Send the Militia to

services as superintendent would not now
be accented.
It is understood that President Lynch is
desirous of establishing and maintaining
the most amiable relations with the min
ers. He was waited upon in Virginia City
by several representative worKmen, who
were authorized to speak for their fellow
workers. They assured Mr. Lynch of
their personal regard for himself and
their willingness to suppoit the new man
agement. One concession, however, they
desired, and that was the appointment of
some superintendent other than Tanger
man. "Send us anybody efse," they said.
"Send us a yellow dog, even, and we will
be satisfied: but we cannot get along with
this man."
"When President Lynch reported this in
terview to the directors there was a gen
eral exchange of opinion on the subject.
The directors were anxious to maintain
pleasant relations with the miners, and so
it was the sense of the meeting that Mr.
Tangerman's services at Virginia City
shoiud teiminate. In due time the name
of the new superintendent will be an
nounced.
When Acting uovernor Reinhold Sadler
of Nevada was asked to call out the militia
to protect Tangerman he reflected a mo
ment and said : "Of course I can do that if
necessary, and the Sheriff of Storey County

Good Baseball.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 23.â A well
playeci baseball game took place on the
BerKeley diamona between the Varsity
nine and the University Club team, wnich
resulted in a score of 11 to 1 in favor of
the Varsity players.
Colonel George x\ Edwards said that it
was the best baseball game he has seen
for fifteen years, ana the ex-track captain
stated that it was the best game he has
ever seen in the State. What character
ized the game was the few errors, the ex
cellent base running and the good infield
work. Krng distinguished himself on
third, and Kaarsburg brought frequent ap
plause by his lone slides to bases. Toby
Allen, who played" first base for the Uni-
Clttb nine, won much admiration by his
brilliant plays at putting men out.
Kaarsburg pitched for the visiting team,
and though his work was not so clever as
in several other recent games, yet he
struck out two men in the eighth.
Manager Miller reaped a rich harvest
from the sale of tickets. Souvenir tickets
and a souvenir programme, designed by
Quinnan, were supplied to the visitors.
Following were the players, their positions
and the runs by innings:
University of California â McLaren, shortstop;
Hoag, right" field: Johnston, left field: Elston, sec

NEW YORK MARKETS.-
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 24.â Stocks were
depressed until late In tne day, lower quotations
from London, the advance In sterling exchange
-and the selling of about'Booo shares of St. Paul
and Louisville and Nashville for foreign account
having encouraged the local bears. The advance
in sterling exchange appeared to encourage the
latter, and they added to their outstanding lines.
There was some talk about gold shipments in the
near future and this, with the revival of the rumors
about a downtown bank being in â â  trouble, ma
terially assisted those operating for lower prices.
A good deal was heard again about the unsatis
factory conditions of trade, but certain officials of
financial institutions in the neighborhood of Wall
street were of the opinion that this feature of the
commercial situation had been exaggerated for
effect. The early loss in prices ranged from %to
2 per cent and â¢ was well r distributed," the Indus
â ' trials, the Grangers, . Louisville and Nashville.

company intended resuming dividends. The rise
in the stock alarmed the smaller shorts, and an
' advance of V4@lVs per cent followed. General

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 24.â The wheat mar
ket had further weakness to contend with this
morning, and while prices were in a drooping con
dition some of the professionals who sold yester
day covered pretty freely, with the effect of rally
ing prices quite a little. New York clearancesâ
73,088 bushels of wheat and 39,094 barrels of
flourâ were large enough to attract attention, and
they probably led to soma buying. Liverpool
cables were weak and %d lower, the decline coin
ciding with yesterday's break in this market.
Northwestern receipts were 705 cars, against 56 1
last Tuesday and 331 a year ago.
Depressed prices on the curb and the weakness
was carried into the regular market, the. 1 ally al
ready mentioned then took place, but the support
of prices was of a wavering sort and strength was
not maintained. Receipts at Chicago were 46 cars,
and .91,300 bushels were taken from store.
Total Atlantic seaboard clearances were 394,462
bushels. Closing continental cables were gener
ally lower. Bradstreet's report of the world's sup
ply was not issued to-day. Before the close there
was a further recovery, but trade was moderate.
May wheat opened from . 6i%@6134c to 6134($
61% c, sold between 62% c and 615Â»8(a61 : Uc, clos
ing at 6-S'Â«,c, 830 higher than yesterday. : Estima
ted receipts for to-morrow, 25 cars.
CORNâ Was largely influenced by the weakness
or strength of wheat. The 25 cars. this grain lacks
fl.Nâ Wu largely influenced by the weakness

â in speculative interest and the movement of
pric^sis governed in most instances by the tone
which rules in wheat. Receipts were 567 cars and
47,458 bushels were taken lrom store. Liverpool
caoles were easy and 1,4:! lower. Export clear
ances were 210,810 bushels. May corn opened at
29 Vic. sold between 29y B (g)29i4c and 293/ B e, clos
ng at _9s /8 unchanged from yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 300 cais.
OATSâ Displayed sympathy with wheat and was
possessed of little or no independence. Receipts
were large at 426 cars and 1350 bushels were with
drawn from store. May oats closed y Ã c higher.

A POLICE COURT DRAMA.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 24. j
Mrs. J. H. Troy and Mrs. Charles Davis
are both property-owners in West Oak
land. Â This morning they were in the po
lice court. Each lady has very settled,
opinions of the rights of neighbors, and
each is willing to back up her opinions
with a display of muscle. It was this lat
ter feature of their natures that brought
them before Judge Wood. Mrs. Troy was
on ratal for battering Mrs. Davis.
The two ladies presented rather a modest
appearance in court. "There was nothing
to indicate that either was a fighter in its
literal sense. The only display of bellig
erency was when their eyes met, and then
their lips and arms would become fidgety
and convey the impression that if it were
not for the court, the bailiff and the Judge
there would be a circus with bare lists.
The story of the feud is over a year old.
Last summer the Troys and the.Davises
found they could not agree. The dividing
fence was too low and one family could
see too much of the other. Familiarity
bred contempt and then a war was inaugu
rated which is still in progress. The Troys
decided to .blot the Davises out of exist
ence so far as they were concerned, so they
built a fence 27 feet high, and since â  that
time this aerial fence has been one of the
Bights of West Oakland.
According to the story of Mrs. Davis the
battery was committed on March 10. She
said Mrs. Troj addressed her in- a very
objectionable manner, and. finally threat
ened that she would scratch her homely
face. Mrs. Davis then admitted that she
grabbed a flower-stake, and declared she
would strike Mrs, Troy if the latter at
tempted to carry out her threat on Mrs.
Davis' face. The sight of that flower-stake
in the hands of her old enemy was more
.than Mrs. Troy could stand. * A moment
later the two ladies were banging away at
each other with their fists and pulling
each other's hair. A colored man saw the
row, and after he had separated the com
batants he lectured them on the impro
priety of their conduct. ,
K::-Mayor Chapman * appeared 1 for Mrs. .
Troy and Court Commissioner Whitney
for Mrs. Davis. Robert E. Johnson, the
colored man in the case, said that there
was 'Mots of talking and not much hair
pullin*:."
Mrs. M. Stella for the defense stated that
she had been a friend to Mrs. Davis until
the latter started to write obscene letters
to her daughter. Mrs. Davis strenuously
denied that she had ever done any such
thing and challenged Mrs. Stella to prove
any sneu cbaree.
It was brought out that each family is
trying to force the other to move away.
As they both own their property they are
not willing to be driven off. After hear
ing ail the evidence Judge Wood decided
that it was a neighborhood row and that
one party was as much to blame as the
other, lie therefore discharged Mrs. Troy.

ACCEPTS THE CHALLENGE
Cambridge Athletes Willing to
Meet Berkeley Cracks in
the Field.
Friend Elected Athletic Manager.
Town Trusteesâ Fire Company
in Difficulty.
BERKELEY. Cal., March 24.â Harvard
University will put up a track athletic
team to meet the Berkeley cracks should
they go East again this summer. A dis
patch was sent to them yesterday asking
if a field day couid be arranged during
the summer, and in response Captain
Merwia received the following dispatch
to-day from Captain Bremer:
Cambridge, Mass., March 14.
/,. T. Menrin. Track Captain U. C: Can meet
you m May U3, provided arrangements satis
iactorv. Bhemee,
Captain Harvard Track Team.
The receipt of this dispatch registers
the last of the replies to be received from
the Big Four, Yale. Pennsylvania and
Princeton having already fallen into line
and .signified their willingness to compete
against the Berkeley team should Batis
firctory arrangement* be anlved at.
The graatest encouragement that could
be expected has been received from all the
institutions to which the Berkeley men
have sent communications asking for
pames ani there seems to be no question
but what Berkeley will have plenty of en
gagements. But the one vital question
which will now cause the promoters of the
second transcontinental tour to pause and
consider ih that of li nances. To make a
trio across the continent with a full team
properly equipped will cost upward of
$5000. Thus !ar, only $700 has been guar
anteed by colleges which have signified
their willingness to meet Berkeley, and all
these are in the Middle West, none of the
Bitr Four or other extreme Eastern insti
tutions having yet made si guarantee. A
debt of $20110 is now standing aeainst the
athletic team asÂ» result of Just year's ven
ture, and certain of the creditors, most of
whom are alumni, are much adverse to the
scheme of sending out .another team until
the outstanding debt is liquidated. It is
believed that about half of the $2000 will
not be asked for by those who loaned it,
tut who are willing to let it go for the
good uf athletics and as a voluntary con
tribution to the team which brought so
much honor to the State. But, on the
3ther hand, those who were most instru
mental in effecting the loan say that at
'oast a tender of all the borrowed money
should be made before another trip is un
dertaken.
The question of whether a team will
ultimately bÂ« sent across the continent
will remain for the student body to de
termine.
*"lre Company in Trouble.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 24.âConsid
erable discussion occurred at the meeting
of the Town Board last night over the re
ported infraction of the liquor laws in the
engine-house of the Columbia Fire Com
pany, where an impromptu party was held
on a recent evening. According to the re
ports, a quantity of liquor was disposed of
by the guests. The lirehouse is a public
place, and consequently it is held to be
unlawful under the mile-limit law to even
give away liquor. The board referred the
matter to the Fire and Committee
for further investigation.
Several petitions to the board were read.
One, from the South Berkeley Improve
ment Club, was to the end that ordinances
be parsed compelling street railroad com
panies operating within the town limits
to place proper fenders on their cars, and
also to reduce the speed of the cars when
passing each other.
Another was from the West Berkeley
Proeressive Club, asking that no more
sewers be laid at the West End until the
water supply was sufficient to properly
flush them.
Bills to the amount of $147 95 were
allowed from the general fund and $54
from thÂ« road fund.
It was agreed that hereafter the regular
meetings of the board be held on the sec
ond and fourth Monday evenings of
the month, instead of the first and thiid.

CREMATORY FOR GARBAGE
Alameda Trustees Consider a
Plan for Burning the
Refuse.
Trouble Over the Electric â¢ Light
Injunction â Native Sons
Celebrate.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 24.â John 0.
Titlow, a Bay Farm islander, appeared be
fore the Board of Trustees last night, and
with a document signed by many other
islanders protested against the suggestion
of Superintendent of Streets Frodden re
garding the extension of the dumping
grounds. He argued that the proper
thing to do would be to establish a crema
tory and add another improvement to the
city's already tine appearance. The estab
lishment of a crematory seemed to meet
with the approval of the board and Trus
tee Clark suggested that bids be advertised
for. The board, however, decided to allow
the dumps to remain where they were at
the foot of Prospect street and have the
Board of Health take up the crematory
project.
Electric Injunctions.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 24.â City At
torney Taylor at the meeting of the City
Trustees last evening used some pretty
strong language when giving his views oh
the electric-lurht injunction proceedings,
which he characterized as "one of the most
infumoua things that a citizen has ever in
flicted on the city of AJameda." He de
clared tnat the nature of the injunction
was such tnat the board could not lay an
other shingle on the roof of the annex to
the old electric works, and that the ma
chinery would be exposed to the dampness
and rain.
"I don't think Judge Frick knew any
thing about the state of affairs existing
here," said he, "and my purpose will be to
inform him as soon as I can do so."
The men and contractors on the work
are still employed and going ahead with
their duties. The contractor for the frame
structure in course of erection there says
that the $500 cash bond would be but a
drop in the bucket in comparison to the
outlay and amount involved in his con
tract and he does not consider it necessary
to stop work. There is talk of increasing
the bonds of the plaintiffs to $25,000.
Xativrs Celebrate.

morning at his residence, 1823 Eighth
street. He had been in poor health for
three years, never having fully recovered
from an attack of the grip, and in conse
quence of this he was forced to retire from
business. Last September his illness as
sumed a serious aspect, and about three
weeks ago his life was despaired of.
Air. Collins was a native of New York,
and came to California when he was 20.
He settled in Placerville, El Dorado Coun
ty, and tried mining for a time, but he did
not make a fortune, and in 1861 he helped
to found the pioneer grocery firm of Burns
j & McÃride, of which he was a partner for
over fifteen years. While a resident of
Placerville Mr. Collins took an active In
terest in local affairs, and in 1871-72 be
served as a member of the Town Council.
In 1877 the firm dissolved partnership, and
Mr. Collins came to Oakland. He estab
lished himself in business in West Oak
land, and continued to live an active life
till ill health compelled him to retire.
In 1889 Mr. Collins became connpicuous
in local politics. In that year there was a
bolt from the Republican party in tde mu
nicipal election on account of dissatisfac
tion with the primaries, and a fusion ticket
was put up by the seceders and the Demo
crats. Mr. Collins, who was a Republican,
was named for Councilman in the First
Ward. He ran against T. J. Carothers,
who had always been considered invinci
ble, and beat him by a few votes. In the
Council Mr. Collins served one term as
president of the body. His best work was
done in the reform of the Jiquor license
system and in retrenchment of expendi
tures. In 1892 Mr. Collins ran again, but
was defeated. In 1894 he was nominated
for Assemblyman, and it was verycloÃe
between him and J. B. McDonald, Demo
crat. McDonald was declared elected, but
Mr. Collins contested the seat and finally
won it, the recount showing he was elected.
He took his Jseat shortly before the end of
the session.
He was a good speaker and an anient
advocate of Republican principles.
The deceased was a member of many se
cret organizations. He was a member of
Harbor Lodge of Odd Fellows, the An
cient Order of United Workmen and also
the Order of Chosen Friends, of which he
became the assistant supreme treasurer
tor the Pacific Coast in 1882, and he has
held the position ever since.
Mr. Collins was a man of kindly nature
and homely, unaffected ways and had
many friends. He leaves a widow and five
children. They are Miss Mary E. Collins,
Mrs. Jennie Stevens, Mrs. Lottie Law
rence, William Collins and George Collins.
At the time of his death the deceased waa
63 years 7 months and lfj days old.
The funeral will take place this after
noon from the Chester-street M. E. church.
Key. F. W. Beatty will conduct the music.
The ceremonies will be under the auspices
of the Odd Fellows and Ancient Order of
United Workmen. The interment will be

WANT THE SCHOOL HERE
Shall the Wilmerding College
Be Located in San Fran
cisco? . V\
PETITION TO THE GOVEBNOB.
The Merchants' Association Are in
Favor of Having the Institu
tion in the City. â 
Among the latest to contend for the
location of the Wilmerding School in this
City are the members and officers of the
Merchants' Association. The association
held a meeting Monday afternoon,* during
which the matter was exhaustively dis
cussed.
.There were present: James D. Phelan,
president of the San Francisco Art Asso
ciation; ;E. A- Denicke, i president of the
board of trustees of the Mechanics' Insti
tute ; Henry J. Crocker, representing the
Chamber of Commerce; Alfred Bouviar,
from the State Development Committee;
Hugh D. Keil, of the board of directors of
the Merchants' Association ; Joseph Leg
get, one of the directors of the Mechanics'
Institute, arid J. Richard Freud, who
officiated a3 secretary.
The following copy of a letter was read
and the views expressed therein discussed:
San Francisco, March 18, 1896.
To the Merchants'. Association; San Franciscoâ
Gentlemen: You ask me if the Lick Mechan
ical School and the Wilmerding Trust could be
advantageously managed . in co-operation. I
think they can, because their objects are much
the name, while neither of them has capital
enough to make it what it ought to be. : i â  :'â¢â 
The Lick School is organized on (he basis of
its annual income. - It has $125,000 invested
in its plant; it maintains a teaching start' of
fourteen teachers for a clientage of 350 schol
ars, and has an annual income which meets its
expenses. It could easily receive more pupils
if it could pay more teachers. It offers to
scholars fourteen technical coursesâ that is,
fourteen different ways of making a livelihoodâ
and with its present income it can do no more
The Wilmerding Trust, I understand, is to be
like the Lick School; except that it is, so to say,
more practical, more technical. The only dif
ference then will be more shop work and less
academic work. This is a matter easily:ar
ranged, just as in the university some students
take more practical courses and some more lit
erary courses according to their tastes. -'.
: The trustees of the Lick School by a very
moderate outlay could double the size of their
shops and add another story to their academic
building; then they would be prepared to re
ceive 250 students more, mainly in the exclu
sive technical coursesâ that is, workshop. V In
stead of fourteen courses (of which all are open
to boys), they could offer twenty or twenty
two courses of industrial work, combined with
a lessened amount of academic work, which, I
understand, is Mr. Wilmerding's desire. - â¢ â 
The additional 250 pupils could be received
on an allowance per head for instruction; Or,
the Wiimerdir.tr trustees could appoint an ad
ditional corps of teachers, which would form a
faculty by themselves, working in co-operation
with ours. The â  academic building bears thÂ«
name of Lick; the shops might equally well be
named the Wilmerding School, '
Thus we could enlarge our school from 350
to 600 students, of which 250 would be regis
tered as ; constituting the Wilmerding School,
and the number of â  courses of i technical study
open to our pupils would be increased from 14
to 20 or. 22, the new courses serving at the
same time to enrich those already offered. If
deemed advisable evening classes could also
be organized, ;' â 
The Wilmerding School, instead of being
limited to 7 or 8 courses, as it would neces
sarily be by itself, would . have the benefit of
all our present courses and 7 or 8 more be
sideâsay 22 in all. Both schools would be im
proved, and Instead of two weak institutions
we would have one ; very strong one, the
strongest of its kind in the United States. I
am with great respect yours very truly, â . ..-.

cal Arts. : ; -y J^V; *
The - members 'I of the committee ex
pressed; themselves strongly in favor of
San Francisco as the locality for the.Wil
merding "< School ' of Industrial; Arts, and
the statement was made that it was clearly
the intention of Mr. Wilmerding that the
school should be one in which to graduate
practical 7 and efficient mechanics, engi
neers and artisans.
. â¢ It was also stated that a number of com
munications had been received from par
ties, who declared that the people of San |
Francisco expect that the school shall be I
located in this City. .
The members of ; the committee an
nounced their intention to enlist the co
operation of all the City newspapers to
arouse public opinion in favor .of San
Francisco to ?uch a degree that the Board
of Regents will fully appreciate the senti
ment of the people in tnis matter. : \ 'â ',
:- James D. rhelan, Henry J. Crocker and
H. D. Keil were named as a committee to
prepare an address to the Board of Re
gents, in which they are to clearly and
forcibly advocate the establishment of the
Wiimerding School near the Lick School
of Mechanical Arts, so . that the two insti
tutions may be able to exchange benefits
and the purposes of the two benefactors
be faithfully carried out. r;
The sub-committee met . yesterday in
Mr. Phelan's office and the secretary of
the association was ordered to send a com
munication ? to the resents, urgently rec
ommending the establishment of the â  Wil
merding School In tnis City. The letter,
which was pent yesterday, reads 'â  as fol

have passed, and <it is a real gratification to
know "that the future * prosperity ;of the uni

In this connection I cannot refrain from
calling your attention, â¢ as ( president â of the
board, to : the ' proposed establishment lof I the
Wilmerding : School >of Industrial v Arts. vj The
will of ; the late iJ. Clute Wilmerding is before
me, and almost every word | bearing > upon this
trust clearly indicates the wish and intention
of the benefactor. There cannot be the least
question that Mr. Wilderming; in saying that
his school should be "to I teach boys trades, fit
ting them to make a living with their hands,
with little study and plenty of work," meant
, exactly what he said. The institution is to be
a practical workshop to turn out practical arti
sans, engineers and mechanics. To devote the
funds for any ether purpose will be a clear
violation of the , spirit : and f letter of â  the ', be
quest. Mr. Wilmerding knew, what is only. too
apparent to us ' all, that | the market for doc
tors, ? lawyers . and > profession al : men is abso
lutely glutted. He fully realized â  the blessing
of an institution | that would | take â  boys from
the streets, and by training them in mechani
cal pursuits fit them ' for making a living and'
possibly save them from crime.*, :' : : ; r
.' The ; second â â  dominant t feature of ; Mr. Wil
merding's I will; < though omitted in words," is
that this institution should be placed in the
midst of the poor boys of a great city. ~ To place '
this institution, as contemplated, in Temescal,
would be literally to defeat the entire purpose
of the endowment. There is logically but one
place for this school where the most good can
be accomplished. It should be located right in
the heart of this big metropolis, where of all
places the poor boys are thickest and need its
advantages the most. .: : â¢ : â¢ : Â« -â â  v K.'^ 'â :-. â â â ^i ..:â¢ -^

IN A BOWER OF BLOSSOMS
Wedding of Miss Ruby Lowen
berg and A. Brown Last
Evening.
Theatrical People Attend an Interest
ing Wedding at the Palace
Hotel.
There was a very pretty and fashionable
wedding at the Palace Hotel last evening,
the contracting parties baing Miss Jtuby
Lowenberg, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. I.
Lowenberg, and Abraham Lincoln Brown,
son of Mr. and Mrs. Morris Brown. The
Alaple Hall, where the ceremony was per
formed, was handsomely adorned with
choice flowers. At the north end of the
handsome hall a bower of apple blossoms,
typical of spring, had been erected, and
here the young people stood while the Rev.
Dr. Voorsanger read the marriage ceremony.
The bride was attended by Miss Hilda Brown,
who officiated as maid of honor, and eight of
her young friends who acted as bridesmaids.
Charles Brown, brother of the groom, officiated
as best man. The bridal party entered from
the marble hall, two littie maidens leading the
procession and stretching the satin ribbon,
thus forming an aisle for the eight ushers, who
entered first, followed by the bridesmaids.
They were in turn followed by the maid of
honor, who preceded the bride who entered
ou the arm of her father. Mr. and Mrs. Browu
and Mrs. Lowenberg accompanied the young
couple to the improvised altar.
After the ceremony there was dancing until
midnight, when an elaborate supper was
served. Covers were laid for 220 and the
table daintily decora f ed with apple blossoms
and wild hollyhocks.
The bride wore a very elegant gown of white
satin. The jupe was cut en train. The corsage
was formed with a high stock collar covered
with point lace that fell in V-shaped points
down the back and over the large elbow
sleeves. The conventional veil and orange
blossoms completed the costume.
The maid of honor and the bridesmaids were
attired alike In dainty white organdie gowns,
and carried long-sttmmed American beauty
roses.
Mr. and Mrs. Erown will leave to-day for a
bridal tour, and although they have kept the
destination a profound secret, it is known that
they will be absent one month, and on their
return reside with Mrs. and Mrs. Lowenberg,
the parents of the bride, at their residence,
609 Van Ness avenue.
A unique and dainty wedding took place
yesterday at noon in the parlors of Mr. and
Mrs. Royle at the California Hotel, when
Gretchen Lyons, the pretty little girl of the
"Captain Impudence" Company, was united to
Lucius Henderson. Only the members of the
company were present, bat they were like af
fectionate brothers and sisters in their endeav
ors to give the young couple a joyous and
pretty wedding.
Mr. Royle gave the bride away and Mr. Fer
dinand Reis Jr., an old college chum of Mr.
Hendc "son's, officiated as best man.
Mr. Henderson is a Harvard graduate and a
gentleman of charming manner, as well as a
brilliant and talented young actor. He is a
partner of -Edwin Milton Royle in the
"Friends" and "Captain Impudence" compan
ies. He played the part of Adrain Kaize, the
actor pianist in "Friends," forjfour years, and
made a great success by his piano recitals. In
"Captain Impudence" he plays the part of the
Mexican major, Mendoza.
The bride has been on the stage ever since
her birth, almost. She plajed with the
"Friends" company here about two years ago.
Those present at the ceremony were all mem
bers of the company: Mr. and Mrs. Lucius
Henderson, Mr. and Mrs. Edwin M. Royle, Mr.
and Mrs. Arthur C. Aiston, Miss Madeline
Merli, William Bittner, T. J. Myers, Harry
Griffith, Frank Kelly and Ben Johnson.
â  A reception will be (riven by Mrs. Charlei H.
Mentz at her home, 1600 street, to
the Rev. Edwin H. Jenks and Mrs. Jenks, to
morrow, Thursday, March 26, from 3 to 5
o'clock.
E. Burke Holladav has just returned from his
wedding tour, he and the bride (nee Hunting
ton) being domiciled at the old-time home
stead of Hon. Sam W. Holladav, father of the
groom. The happy couple came overland via
Cincinnati and New Orleans. The son, who is
associated with his father in the law firm, will
at once resume active practice.
Jacob Suyder, whom his fellow-pioneers dub
the "argonaut globe-trotter," is home again
after an exceedingly eujoyable trip through
the southern counties of the State, including
a charming two-days' sojourn on Catalina Is
land ; also a quick trip to Echo Mountain. Al
though nearly eighty years of age the venerable
pioneer spends the greater portion of the even
ing of his days in visiting notable localities in
the United States.
Kloos Released.
Charles Kloos, who was charged with as
sault to murder Everett Bowen, a peddler, on
the morning of February 23 before Judge
Campbell on Monday, was released on his own
recognizance yesterday, as the evidence
pointed to John Dougherty, a plumber, as the
real assailant. . Dougherty has now been
charged, but the caso against Kloos will
not be dismissed till after Dougherty has had
his preliminary examination.

Scenes of Activity In and About the
Celebrated Rawhide Mine.
W. A. Kevills, one of the most pro
gressive and capable of minine men and
the chief owner of the Rawhide mine,
arrived in the City yesterday and regis
tered at the Palace.
A new electric plant has just been estab
lished at Rawhide, which supplies abun
dant light and power. The rich mines in
that section of Tuolumne County are en
listing the attention of people from all
parts of the country. So active is the de
velopment there, so rich are the returns
and so animated is the camp, that visitors
are reminded of the flush days of '49.
Music halls, popular resorts and the diver
sions of pleasure which are only main
tained where money is plentiful are in
cidents of the recently discovered treas
ures of the mother lode.
Many substantial improvements are in
progress and many new enterprises are
contemplated. The" population of the dis
trict is rapidly increasing-.

MAY BE OUSTED
FROM OFFICE
Sheriff Whelan and Re
corder Glynn Ignore
the Law.
COLLECTION OF FEES.
A Grand Jury Expert in Pos
session of Facts and
Figures.
THE ADVICE OF ATTORNEYS.
Protection of Bondsmen Assigned as a
Cause for Disobeying the Fee
Law of 1895.
Expert inquiry under the direction of
tbe Grand Jury has established the fact
that Sheriff Whelan and Recorder Glynn
of this City and County have ignored the
fee bill passed by the Legislature of 1895
and are collecting the high fees which that
law abolished. The only explanation they
offer for disregarding the law is to the
effect that their attorneys have advised
them to ignore the law in order to protect
their bondsmen.
There is a strong sentiment in the Grand
Jury in favor of proceeding against the
Recorder and Sheriff for willful miscon
duct in office. Members of the Grand Jury
entertain the notion that the officers of
this City and County should obey the law
a? they find it and not seek the advice of !
private attorneys for a pretext to vio
late it.
One juror paid: "It is the duty of the
officers elected to serve the people to exe
cute the law. according to their oath of j
office. It is not their province to decide !
upon the constitutionality of an act passed j
by the Legislature. The law is constitu- i
tional until the Supreme Court de
clares it to De otherwise. These ;
officers â the Sheriff and Recorder â i
should be impeached and removed for j
official misconduct. The people who pay
for tiling instruments in the Recorder's of- j
lice have some rights which should be re
spected. The Legislature thouzht the fee J
system exorbitant and so diminished the
charges, but officers who want to maintain i
a large clerical force consult their attor- i
neys and decide to collect the exorbitant
fees as of old."
Some tin;e ago the Grand Jury engaged
Horace P. Dunn as an expert to look
into the fee business. He found in the .
progress of his work that County Clerk I
Cony was obeying the law, but that the
Recorder and* Sheriff were violating it.
When a man takes a deed to tne Record- ,
er's office a charge of $2 25 is made for re
cording it. The law passed by the Legisla- '
ture of 1895 tixps the fee at ?1 75.
In the Sheriff's office the charge of $3 a
day for a keeper is collected. The law tixes I
thÂ«> amount to be charged at $2; but the i
Sheriff, on the advice of his attorney, sees \
tit to disobey the law. That is the way â 
the subject is presented to the Oand Jury.
The expert, under t lie direction of the
jury, is making a report of all fees collected
since tbe new law went into effect. One i
column of the report will present the
amounts properly charreaMe under the I
law, and another column will contain
rigurcs showing the amounts collected.
The difference between the aggregate of
the two columns will present the amount j
url:awir.lly extorted from the people.
Mr. Dunn is not an impulsive, flyaway
expert, but a calm and conservative bus!- \
ness man. His report will noi, be sensa- i
tional, bnt the disclosures already made
leave little room to doubt that a flagrant
violation of the letter and spirit of the law \
lias been committed.
"When ail the facts are submitted to the I
Grand Jury that body may report an ac- â 
cusation to Judge Slack of the Superior '
Court. In the accusation against Thomas i
R. Ashwcrth, Superintendent of Streets, :
which was presented by the Grand Jury of
which Oliver Eldridge was foreman "the j
accused was not called to explain his al- |
leged official misconduct, but on his own
motion the jury heard his explanation.
Doubtless Sheriff Whelan "and Recorder ;
Glynn will be given an opportunity to ex- j
plain why they have set the law asiJe.
The present Grand Jury has not been '
sounding its own praises or heralding itself
as the greatest body of reformers ever im- 1
paneled for jury service, but it has been â 
quietly at worK collecting facts and figures
to justify its action. The effective work of {
the session is just now beginnine. The ;
fund authorized for expert examination
has been reserved for practical work and is i
now available. Within the next two weeks
Mr. Dunn at the City Hall will be re-en
forced by other experts.
TURN DOWN BROEMMEL

A Vote of Confidence Is Passed in
Face of the Opposition of the
President.
At a meeting of the board of directors of
the German Hospital held last evening the
resignation of Superintendent Brown,
which had been tendered to President
Uroemmel some days previously, was not
accepted.
1 his action is calculated to create the
widest kind of a breach in the board as
well as continued friction among the offi
cers of the hospital, unless President
Broemmel himself shall resign.
There have betn indications of trouble
for some time past, indeed since President
Broemme! was elected. He succeeded
Priber as head of the institution in Jan- '
vary last. He immediately instituted a
policy of surveillance of the superintend- ;
ent a*nd other officer? that resulted a few
days ago in the flat refusal of the superin- i
tendent to observe Mine condition re- !
quired.
"Th'-n I shall have to ask for your resig
nation," said the president.
"Very well: here it is." said Brown,
drawiug the document from his pocket,
for he hart it already written out.
The resignation, under the rules, had to

be brought before the board of direc
tors, and, as stated, that body last
evening refused to accept it. The
president is also chairman of the
board and has a vote, but the majority did
not sustain him, and instead substantially
gave a vote of confidence to the superin
tendent.
Brown is a Grand Army man and very
popular.
SAID SUTRO WAS INSANE.
Exciting Meeting of the Board of City
Hall Couuuiss lonersâ A Wordy War.
The Board of City Hall Commissioners,
consisting of Mayor Sntro, Auditor Brod
erick and City and County Attorney Cres
well, had its usual weekly row yesterday,
the proceedings being unusually lively
through the Mayor charging his colleagues
with being In a job and Mr. Creswell re
torting by questioning the Mayor's sanity.
The trouble arose over the directory which
the Merchants' Association desires to put
in the corridors of the hall for the guid
ance of strangers to the various depart
ments.
Messrs. Broderick and Creswell con
tended that it was an insult to the com
mission for outsiders to offer to pay for
and install the directory. They stated
that the plan of having a directory had
been discussed on numerous occasions and
that it bad been decided to have one when
the hall was finished, not such a one as is
proposed by the Merchants' Association,
but a much simpler and more effective
plan. Mayor Sutro then asked what ob
jection there was to receiving assistance
Irom the Merchants' Association.
Mr. Creswell intimated that he consid
ered himself competent to take a hand in
the matter and was not thankful for out
side interference.
"But what reason have you for object
ing? ' asked the Mayor in an indignant
tone.
"I have given you a reason," replied Mr.
Creswell.
"Well, it looks to me as if there is a job
behind this!" exclaimed the Mayor.
"Do you mean to charge that 1 have any
intention to do wrong?" said the attorney,
somewhat fiercely.
The Mayor replied that he was not mak
ing any charges.
"Well, I think," said Mr. Creswell, "that
it is about time to call in the Lunacy Com
mission to pronounce judgment on you.
Your mental faculties are evidently on the
wane."
Without taking any apparent notice of
the remarks of the attorney Mayor Sutro
took his usual shy at the railroad company
and jobbers generally, and the meeting
adjourned without any action being taken.
Auditor Broderick "und Attorney Cres
well have ahout decided to allow the Mer
chants' Association to put in the direct
ories and when their own plans are ready
for adoption quietly remove them.
IS A YOUNG SOUBRETTE
Miss Floy Ballinger Will four
. With : the . Milton Nobles
Company.
The Daughter of a Weil-Known News
paper Manâ Debutante Is
Only Seventeen.
The latest California addition to the
ranks of the professional stage is Miss Floy
j Ballinger, daughter of f : the late ; Frank
' Ballinger, who opens in Portland next
week with the Milton Nobles Company.
Miss Ballinger, who was just 17 on St.
â  Patrick's day, is a tall, slim brunette, with
! large dark eyes and a head of fluffy black
' hair, which she wears in a girlish way, tied
at the nape of her slender; neck. She is
almost childishly simple and unaffected
in her manner, but beneath: this lack of
i sophistication Miss Ballinger has her full
! share of Western determination and pluck.
When Floy was only 7 years of age her
father died, and she has grown up with
; the determination of earning ; her | own
living. Frank Ballingerwas a well-known
newspaper man, who was at one time City
' editor of The Call. He was exceptionally
bright and gifted, and was only 33 years of
i ace at the time of his death.. Having de
termined to earn her own ' living, Floy
1 Ballinger's thoughts turned naturally to
I the stage. At first there was a good deal
iof opposition to overcome, but her
i mother's consent was finally won, and she
made her first appearance before the foot
lights in the periormance given last an
; tumn by the Columbia School of Dramatic
I Art. Since then she has gone on working,
\ and has just become a graduate of the
school. â .:.''
Little things pive an index to character,
I and Miss Floy Ballinger's amiability was
'. at once apparent last night when she was
j seen between the acts of "Sinbad." * She
I had no covering to her pretty dark head,
, and in her lap was an enormous hat of the
I gigantic theater variety. "I always take
; my hat off at the play when any one is
silting. behind," she observed cheerfully,
when questioned on the subject, "it seems
ridiculous to block . up the view of the
stage with hats." By which remark it
j will be seen that Miss Floy Ballinger is
! something of a philosopher,' as well as a
I promising young actress.
When asked- about her ambitions she
said that.soubrette.woric had always been
considered her specialty. - "The part i am
rehearsing with ' Milton Nobles is that of
the - Irish maid in 'For Revenue â¢ Only.'
j There is a little singing and -a: little danc
ing in the role, and I have to talk with the
I brogue, which conies i quite easy, perhaps
because I was i born on : St.- Patrick's day.
! Later 'on I may ; d o" something more
: ambitious than soubrette work, but while
I am so young it is no use attempting any
j thin? heavy." -'â  â¢â¢ ...;.
Milton Nobles is delighted with Floy
I Ballinger's taJent. He and his wife.
Dolly Nobles, are taking a company to
! Portland, Seattle , and the ! other V larger
northern towns, and the California girl
will play the roles which Florence .Thropp
played with ; Milton Nobles at the Grand.
I Floy Ballinger's mother, Mrs. Watson,
will accompany her daughter on the tour.,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1806,
THE BURSTING OF A BOMB
Story of Consternation of the
Lawyers in the Fair
Will Case.
OPPONENTS COME TOGETHER.
But One of the Executors of the
Pencil Will Refused to Be Sum
marily Sidetracked.
You don't quite understand the compli
cation into which the Fair estate or the Fair
wills have fallen?
It was not to be expected. There are
some lawyers who don't quite understand
it as well as they would like. It is quite a
pretty storyâ interesting as showing the
possibilities of wills and lawyers.
A famous lawyer is credited with the
The Picture of Two Russian Hounds Which Mrs. Phoebe Hearst Has Given to the Art Institute,
[Sketched by a "Call" arttit.]
saying that for estates above $300,000 there
is no law. But ah! the number of the
lawyers.
James G. Fair is dead. That may be as
serted as the beginning of the stcry, and
the one thing not contested in this busi
ness. All the rest that is hereinafter stated
is not true â if you are on the other side.
Both sides, the simple story of events, are
here to be stated, and so everybody must
be on the other side at intervals.
A will was offered for probate purporting
to be Mr. Fair's last will and testament.
It was dated September L'l, 1894, and it
nominated W. S. Goodfellow, Angus Bres*e
and Crothers as trustees of the whole big
estate, valued at the time at forty mil
lions. Forty millions! Great Scott !
The trustees were to handle the whole
vast interests without interference from
anybody. They were to have certain lib
eral fees for this and certain other liberal
fees ior that (so nominated in the will it
self), and purely incidentally, if the thought
ever occurred to them and "they were satis
lied with itâ the weather being tine and
their digestion quite properâ there was
nothing in the will expressly forbidding
them giving the heirs something; always
provided, however, that these gifts must
not trench upon the estate proper â must
be limited to the revenue; for the estate
must remain intact \intil after the trustees
are all dead, and then, so said the will, it
should be divided among a multitude of
grandchildren and others who may have
never seen the estate.
Charles Fair and his sisters naturally
felt somewhat sidetracked. They did not
remember what they had done to their
father *.o quite deserve that, and so they
hired George Knight and Charles Hegeerty
and Reuben H. Lloyd and W. Wood
and Garber, Boalt <Â£ Bishop, which in
cludes Charles A. Wheeler and Russell
Wilson, and told them to fix it for them.
The trustees hired Garret McEnerney
and William A. Pierson and Robert Mitch
ell to keep the others from fixing it. Ex-
Judge Paterson was engaged to aid them
on behaif of the next generation.
Forty million^! Great Scott! All these
lawyers began thinking.
The law as it stood prevented a contest
of a will before it was before the court,
and it was not before the court until it had
been probated â and when it was probated
the executors might draw upon the estate
to defend themselves in their position.
That was the taking of a laree trick.
Knight, Heggerty, Lloyd, Wood, Garber.
Boalt, Bishop, Wheeler," Wilson â imagine
those men thinking toward a common
point. The will was objectionable in the
single regard of the trust. If the trust
could be eliminated Charley Fair and
Virginia Fair and Mrs. Oelrichs might
tate possession of the estate. If it was
probated then the will must be contested
as not being the will of Senator Fair. If
the trust feature could before the probate
proceedings be discovered to be unlawful â
of which this was an open question â then
what remained of the will would suit the
purpose of the principal heirs. Wiih
hÂ»;avy thinking where does that lead? The
law must be fixed so that a will may be
tested before it is probated.
So that was done. Senator Guy C. Earl
introduced the bill at the last session of
the Legislature, and it went throngh.
That was tix-.d, and very well, so far as
it went. But all these lawyers^âhigh
priced, clever lawyers â were thinking.
The trust clause could now be attacked
before the probate proceedings were de
termined; but suppose the court would
conrirn: that clause as being all right?
That was a consummation that must be
considered. Time was passing.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, a schoolteacher,
who had known James G. Fair in his life
time, did at this interesting juncture the
thing that titied exactly to all the desires
of all the lawyers for the heirs â save ex-
Judge Paterson â with regard to this par
ticular necessity of the situation. She
produced a will written in lead-pencil, and
dated the 24th of Septemberâ three days I
later than the trust will. This will had !
no triut attachment, and it distributed i
the estate very much as the trust will
would have done, with the trust left out.
Mrs. Craven was ia the East, and she
had not thought of it â or something of |
the kindâ until she saw the row, as re
ported in the papers, being made about ;be
trust. T~ai recalled to her mind the paper
which she was carrying around with her
distributing these forty millions. Her in
terest in the will lay in a bequest of some
few thousands to" the schoolteachers'
retirement fund.
This will nominated as executors all
those who were named in the other as
trustees except Bresse and Goodfellow,
and substituted for them Dr. Marc
Levingston.
This will was hailed with rejoicings as
being "the last will and testament entirely
written, dated and signed by the hand of
the said James G. Fair himself," as the
petition says in which it was presented to
court. The petition was that of Charles L.
Fair, Theresa A. Oelrich and Virginia Fair.
They asserted upon their oath that they
believed this later pencil will was the last
will and testament of James G. Fair, and
they asked that letters of administration
be issued to them. To this were signed
the names of their attorneys, Knight &
Heggerty, Lloyd & Wood, Garber, Boalt &
Bishop and Wilson & Wilson.
So much for that. The lawyers are kept
right along thinking.
The act of the Legislature referred to,
especially secured, was not to be allowed
to go to waste. Proceedings were begun
to secure a decision as to the validity of
the trust clause in the earlier will. Judge
Slack decided that the trust was invalid
so far as the real property was concerned.
This was very satisfactory and the ob
jectionability o*f the earlier will took to
diminishing. Stiil there was the fear of
the Supreme Court before them.
On the other hand the trustees had dis- j
covered the magnificent proportions of the j
gage of battle. They had seen a law
passed in the land to fit the wishes of their
opponents, and under that law had seen i
them win a most material point. They I
began to feel a great respect for the pencil
will. It might be that it would be de
clared the real will, and they, as trustees,
be left without occupation.
It remained for thorn to appeal from the
decision of Judge Slack. They did not
havp to do so. however. If they accepted
the judgment of the Superior Court that
would end the matter. All their interests
apparently lay in appealing.
But they did not do so. Both sides had
been thinking right along, and the trus
tees did not appeal.
They sat together in a row before the
court â a most distinguished company â
and gave their assent on Monday of last
week to the probate of the earlier will.
It will not have been forgotten, of
course, that Charles L. Fair and Mrs.
Oeirichs and Virginia Fair had, upon their
oaths, declared their belief that the latter
will was the "last will and testament of
James Fair, executed and dated on the
24th of September, 1894, which will was
entirely written, dated and sicned by the
said James G. Fair himself," and that this
statement was subscribed to by their
attorneys, Kniirht & Heggerty, Lloyd <fc
Wood, Garber, Boalt & Bishop and Wil
son & Wilson. But, as stated, these are
the gentlemen who had been thinking.
And yet with it all there was one factor
that had been quite forgotten. Its name
was Dr. Marc Levingston.
Dr. Marc Leyingston had been named
in the pencil will as an executor. He had
not been consulted in the matter. He
knew nothing about the will until it was
brought forward by the Fair children and
the attorneys just named. He announced
his willingness to accept the trust and
waited patiently until the efforts of the
great legal army should secure the probate
of the will to enter upon his duties.
But now he saw them assenting to the
probate of another will which lately they
had been stigmatizing as false and
spurious.
So he sought counsel.
When all these legal gentlemen â this
most distinguished company, who had
been opposing each other so' bitterly for
months â were gathered together in peace
; before the tribunal, their law books closed,
smiling as-sent to a cessation of hostilities
and the probate of the will, trust willâ now
trustlessâ and when the court was about
to grant their petition, for very lack of
any objection, his counsel walked in upon
them in the persons of Messrs. Delmas ifc
Shortride.
And now there is consternation.
Delmas & Shortridge as representing the
executor, Dr. Levingston, take up tbe fight
for the pencil will where the attorneys for
the children left it. They say that if Dr.
Levingston was executor of a bona fide
i will in the first instance, while the chil
dren had reason to fear the trust will, he
is still executor of such will and the court
should admit it to probate, as it bears the
later date.
And the army of lawyers are thinking
mightily ana wondering how it was they
overlooked Marc Levingston. Just how
the Fair children and their lawyers can re
fuse to support the pencil will, which they
have already aflirmed to the court their
beiief in, is not clear â except on the basis
i of its being above $300,000.
In the meantime, by assenting to the I
right of the minor children to contest the
probate, Delmas & Shortridge have secured
the right to submit the question to a jury
for judgment, and the matter comes up
for trial in Judge Slack's court on Friday
morning.
As pretty a thing in law as a man might
wish to see.

ANIMALS ARE HER FORTE
A California Artist Whose Latest
Work Is in the Art In
stitute.
DONATED B7 MRS. HEARST.
Miss Matilda Lotz's "Two Russian
Hounds" â A University Lecture
on "Faust."
The Art Institute has just received a
fine picture by Matilda Lotz, the animal
painter. Mrs. Phoebe Hearst has donated
the work of art, which was only unpacked
yesterday afternoon, and has not yet been
hung.
The picture is especially interesting, as
Miss Lotz, who is now making a reputa
tion for herself in Paris, was at one time a
i
! student at the Art Institute. She has al
; ways been especially successful in portray
j ing animals and has given most of her
| time to that branch of art.
The chief merit in the picture which
! Mrs. Hearst has just presented to the mi
i stitute lies in the two Russian hounds in
j the foreground. They are large, powerful
i animais, with shaggy coats and massive
! houndlike heads. One is black and white
i and the other brindle and white. The
i dogs are lashed together, standing in an
attitude of expectancy, and the artist has
been very happy in catching the life and
vitality of nef subject. The dogs are
painted with almost the care and minute
ness of a Landseer and all the details are
tilled in very effectively.
The background of the picture is a good
deal more sketchy than the canine figures,
i It represents a glade in a forest, with bri
ars and trees overhanging a narrow path,
which dwindles away and fades among the
leaves in tbe distance. The day is gray
and cloudy and apparently the "season is
either early spring or late autumn, for the
foliage is thin and sparse. The wbole pic
ture is painted in subdued tints, but the
dogs, with their action and vitality, stand
out with ereat force against the rather
wintry background. It was evidently the
I artist's intention to subordinate the rest of
j her painting to the hound*.
M:ss Lotz's picture will constitute
an interesting addition to the attrac
tions of the Art Institute, both on account
of the good work which the artist is doing,
and also on account of her having been at
one time a student at the institute. Re
cent accounts from Paris say that Miss
Lotz has been selling her pictures at high
prices. Over fourteen years ago >-he went
to Europe to study, and devoted most of
her time to working with Van Marck. It
was under his tuition that she began to
develop her taste for painting animals,
and friendly critics advised her to continue
her efforts along that line.
In order to find interesting subjects and
to study local color and atmosphere in
different parts of the world. Miss
Lotz traveled extensively, particularly
among oriental nations. In Constanti
nople she painted for some time, as well
as in Algeria and Egypt, but in spite of
her extensive studies she found that ani
mal painting was her true vocation, and at
present is devoting most of her time to
that branch of the art. The picture which
the Art Institute has just acquired was

THE LIGHTSHIP BILL.
A Communication From Representative
Loud Upon Improvements Contem
plated for This Harbor.
Secretary Walthew of the San Francisco
corumitteÂ« on commerce received a letter
yesterday from Representative Loud in
Washington regarding the lightship biJl
now before Congress, as follows:
Committee ox the Postoffice and Post Roads.)
HorsE ok Representatives, U. S. A. >
Washington, D. C, March 17, 1896. >
George W. Walthew Etq., Secretary Committee
on Commerce, US Steuart Street, Scm FrancUco,
Cat.â Dear Sir: In reply to your recent letters
will say that we hare a bill before Congress for
lightship, and shall pr*Â«s it as fast as possible;
but these matters only come by recommenda
tion of the Lighthouse Department, which, so
far, we have been unable to secure. Survey of
the rocks is an assured fact. The establish
ment of a bell on Mile Rock we can accomplish,
but the removal of said rock we regard as an
impossibility. The board and Engineer De
partment are strenuously opposed to it. The
cable to Hawaii isa National measure, to which
we are giving our strongest support. Rest
assured we are doing all in our power to ac
complish the results you suggest, but policy
demands that we strongly urge those things
that we can accomplish immediately. Very
truly yours, E. F. Loud. "

THE JURY COMPLETED
Twelve Good Men and True
Secured to Try Mrs.
Davidson.
TESTIMONY WILL OPEN TO-DAY
Both Sides Seem Very Well Satisfied
With' the Jury as
Chosen.
The Davidson jury has been completed
and this morning the actual trial will
open.
The jurors selected are George Walcom,
John Nolan, H. A. Marvin, L. W. John
ston, J. W. Steinart, H. Hoffman. J. H.
Bilser, T. P. Duley, Francis Thoma3, J.
Hillman, G. Noll and F. M. Schweitzer.
The five talismen drawn from the box
the last thing on Monday evening were
soon examined. E. E Ames was excused
by the court for cause. He had read of the
testimony taken in the Police Court and it
has biased his mind.
T. P. Duley was satisfactory. He had read j
but little of the case and thought he would j
make an impartial juror. He knew none j
of the people connected with either side of j
the case and he had never been victimized
by a blackmailer. His state of mind was
acceptable and he passed.
W. M. Dye had an opinion; so had J.
Witt, and both were excused for cause.
Witt had read the papers too assiduously,
and he said he would not like to be tried
by a juror in his frame of mind.
Francis Thomas was not a church mem
ber, and from the time that fact was drawn
from him his examination was easy. He
had no prejudices either against ministers
or charges of extortion, and he thought he
would make a good juror. He, too, was ac
cepted.
Francis Thomas was the last of the five,
and then three more were called to fill the
places of the three unsatisfactones. L. S.
Adams was the first examined, and he was
let go with but little regxet by the prosecu
tion. His mother had held a pew in the
First Congregational Church, but when it
became settled that Dr. Brown was to re
main she gave up the pew, and contents
herself with other houses of worship.
George Fritch had opinions, and he was j
let go. J. Hellraan nad no deleterious i
opinions and has not followed the case, j
He had not "unjuror-like" sentiments for j
or against women and ministers, and he j
was accepted.
Then two more were called. G. Noll
was not a church member; had not fol
lowed the case, had no sentiments regard- ]
ing the sex or calling of criminals. He
was accepted. Thomas Levis had opinions
and was excused.
W. L. Tierny was called to fill the last
vacancy, but he was unsatisfactory. He
hart opinions.
Then came F. M. Schweitzer. He was
possessed of an opinion, but he was so
j evidently acquainted with a juror's busi
ness that both side 3 accepted him, and the
jury was complete.
The cierk then read the information
against the defendant, and then Knight
asked for a continuance until this morn
ing. He had important business, he said,
and the prosecution had agreed to allow
the case to go over.
Judge Bahrs was willing provided no I
more continuances for the accommodation
Of counsel would be asked. Knight readily I
â greed to this. "Of course I will try to
Â§et those witnesses," he said significantly,
ut he promised to ask no more time on
his own account. The case will go on this
morning.
Both sides express satisfaction with the
jury chosen. Each predicts a fair trial and
success.
Railroad Case Continued.
Judge McKenna was ill yesterday and the
case of the Southern Pacific Compauy against
the State Board of Railroad Commissioners
