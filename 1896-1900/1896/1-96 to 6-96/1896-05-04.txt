THE GREAT BATTLE
AS IT STANDS.
Likely to Be Many Ballots
at the St. Louis Con
vention.
CLARKSON GIVES FACTS.
The Opposition to McKinley Will
Have a Majority at the
Start.
A DELIBERATIVE CONVENTION.
Figures Given Out by Grosvenor Are
.Greatly Exeggerated and
.">... . ' Misleading.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 3.â Among
.'the Republicans in Washington to-day are
Mr. FesSenden, member of the Republican
National Committee for Connecticut, and
Tlon.J. S. Clarkson, member ol the same
. committee for lowa. The gentlemen had
. a conference with Senator." Quay and Alli
â  .son and other friends. In the evening Mr.
â ClarKson was seen and asked by a Call
correspondent:
''Has McKinley a majority ol the dele
.. gates already, and what of the claim that
he.will "be nominated by acclamation?"
. " "He. has not nearly a majority yet, nor
will he, in my jndement, enter the con
vention with a majority." replied Clark
son. "Indeed,' he â¢will be shorter of a ma
jority on thefirst ballot at St. Louis than
Blame was in the emotional year of 1876,
Grant in 1880 or Sherman in 1888, when
the latter in a field of fourteen candidates
voted for qn the first ballot had 329 votes.
He will not be nominated by acclamation,
because I can say positively that Allison,
Quay and Morton will remain in the con
test, and so, surely, will Reed, and I judge
so will Bradley and Cullom. The States
of the first four-named gentlemen have
instructed their delegates to go to St.
Louis to present these pentlemen's names
to the National Convention, and there is
no doubt that this will be done. Allison
has not the least idea of withdrawing, nor
has lowa any idea of giving up the fight.
I believe this is true of other candidates
and their States.
"McKinley will; fall from 80 to 100 votes
short of enough to nominate at the start.
- and the field will represent from 525 to 550
. otes. By the field I mean Allison, Reed,
Quay. Bradley, Morton and Cullom,
already suggested, and such other avail
able men as Harrison, Lincoln, Foraker,
Hobart, Davis and General Tracy of New
York, and others who might be fitly men
tioned;- for our party is as rich in its ca
pable reserve of available candidates as it
is strong in the candidates offered. No
man fit to be President or receiving a call
from bis party could or would resist the
.". duty to accept tire nomination for Presi
. dent."' â¢
"You believe that new names may pos
sibly be considered at St. Lous?"
"That is always suppoaable, and, in
years of emotional campaigns sucn as this
.'â¢. has been so far, nearly always inevitable.
It is a. historic fact in American politics
that at the culmination of an enthusiastic
campaign every party, from instinct at
least, avoids the perils of a factional or
emotional nomination. The Republican
party has aiwiiys followed this rule, ex
cept in Blame's case in 1884, when defeat
followed at the polls. The National Con
vention at St. Louis will put party inter
est above any man's ambition, and choose
not a factional candidate, but one who
'.-â 'â  will draw every â  Republican vote at the
polls and thus make part}' defeat impos
,; sible."' . . â¢
. "You believe the field, as you call it,
â  will hold firm?"
"I do, It knows that McKinley cannot
be nominated without its help, and many
of McKinley's delegates know it. too.
There are mdre McKinley delegates likely
to break than among delegates in the field.
Enthusiasm and'emotion do not stampede
delegates. Besides, enthusiasm is as often
a warning as an assurance. For instance,
the enthusiasm for McKinley among Re
publicans and in Republican papers is
good enough, but the enthusiasm for him
in the Democratic papers is not so good in
k itself nor so reassuring to our party."
"Then you. do not believe the story that
the delegates for favorite sons will break?"
"No; all the talk about bosses and co
ercion and unwilling delegates is absurd.
This has been a. contest of absolutely free
choice. If absolute free choice has been
hindered anywhere it has been in Ohio
alone, and if there are any reluctant dele
gates who will vote against their own per
sonal choice and judgment it will be
eighteen delegates in Obio. In no other
State has there been an organized attempt
to coerce delegates with State pride or
Sta.te power."
"Then you mention General Harrison as
being in the field of available candidates?"
"Yes; every man fit to be President and
who is a good Republican is always avail
able to his party; and Harrison is a good
Republican and responsive to party duty.
What the people demand this year in the
Republican candidate and platform if a
certainty. In one respect Harrison would
give the earliest certainty of any one who
could be nominated, for the day he should
be nominated the country would know
exactly what his policy as President would
be on tariff, and exactly what it would be
on finunce, and this would quickly bring
confidence and good times behind it."
"You have seen General Grosvenor's
tables?"
"Yes, and they are grossly inaccurate.
He claims far too many votes for McKin
iey and appropriates practically all tbe
contested votes, of which there will be a
h-undred or more. The public should be
treated candidly and given figures that are
accurate,. and contested votes should not
be claimed for any candidate as yet. As
of Grosvenor's inaccuracies, he
counts practically all of Texas for McKin-
Jcy, while McKinley has at most six votes
in that State and three of them contested.
He counts all the votes in Tennessee as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
instructed for McKinley when, in truth,
a resolution of instructions was simply for
delegates to vote for McKinley as long as
a majority of the delegates should deem it
wise â and it is very doubtful if a majority
of delegates in that State are for McKin
ley.
â¢'He claims many votes in Louisiana,
where McKinley only has two and per
haps only one. He claims Alabama prac
tically solid, while every seat is contested
in Alabama. He claims all but five of
Georgia, while there are conceded nine un
contested anti- McKinley delegates in that
State and eight delegates contested. He
claims Florida, which has made a double
delegation, the McKinley delegation
elected by a minority of votes of the State
Convention, or an illegal body. He claims
the votes in Mississippi, while nine and
perhaps twelve of the legal delegates in
that State are against McKinley. The re
sult in Illinois has been exaggerated to
McKinley's benent and Grosvenor claims
it as practically solid, whereas it will take
the first ballot at St. Louis to show
whether it will be a majority for McKinley
or a majority against him. Many more
mistakes could be pointed out, but these
are samples of the rest."
"Are you ready to give figures by
States?"
"Yes; I will give them as I have gained
them by an industrious gathering of my
own from the first sources and by compar
son with figures of others. Here is an ap
proximate table of the first ballot divided
between McKinley and the field and the
unsettled contests so far as the delegates

Mr. Clarkson continued as follows*
"There is a pretense of contest in Arizona,
but a majority of the legally called con
vention elected three Allison and three
Quay delegates. Twenty-four hours after
it had adjourned sine die a McKinley
convention was called, without authority,
and six so-called McKinley delegates
elected. There are more contests in
Texas than the above table indicates, but
they are mainly between Reed and Allison.
By the rules of party all these contests
will first be heard by the National Com
mittee, which makes up a temporary roll
of the National Convention. Each State
in temporary convention elects a member
of the committee on credentials, and con
testants are beard again before this com
-1 mittee. The convention itself will also
hear the contests through the report of
the committee on credentials, so there will
be three careful examinations of all these
contests, insuring the fairest decision."
"What about reports as to the National
Committee and how it stands, and how
are these contests going to be decided?"
"The National Committee is made up of
good and trained Republicans, the most of
them long in service, and all of them care
ful of the party's interest and honor and
all representative men in their respective
States. While a majority of the National
Committee doubtless prefers some other
candidates from personal choice and party
interest, it is safe to say that they will give
as fair a hearing to every contest as will
the committee on credentials or the con
vention itself. Fonr-fifths of the contests
are represented by McKinley people, who
bolted from regular State or district con
ventions of the party. The convention at
St. Louis, which is going to be a very seri
ous affair, will result in showing that the
sober judgment of the majority of dele
gates in that body will, from party inter
ests, be in favor of some other candidate
than McKinley."
MANLEY IS CONFIDENT.
Say* the lit. J.otiit Contention Atone Can
Determine the llrtult.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 3.â Mr.
Manley of MalDe to-night gave out the
following statement:
"Since my statement of a week ago there
have been elected forty -six delegates. The
elections have occurred in Michigan, Illi
nois, Missouri, Arizona, Indian Territory,
Vermont, Alabama and Georgia. They
â¢can be assigned as follows: In Alabama
and Arizona two sets of delegates have
been elected and they are therefore placed,
as they ought to be, in the contested col
umn; Indian Territory, Michigan. Mis-
Bouri and Illinois are placed in the column
for Governor McKinley.
The convention in Vermont was a sur
prise to the friends of Mr. Reed. They
had a right to expect that Vermont would
join with the rest of New England and
send a delegation pledged to the support
of the New England candidate. The dele
gates selected unquestionably prefer the
nomination of Mr. Reed. How far they
will feel bound by the declaration of pref
erence for Governor McKinley by their
convention time alone will determine. It
must be remembered that the convention
did not instruct the delegates and left
them free to exercise their own judgment.
Preferences and even instructions in the
past have not uniformly governed the del
egates, because the conditions under
which they were passed did not exist at
the time the delegates were called upon to
discharge the duties intrusted to them.
The situation to-day is as follows :
For Mr. Reed 162; for Governor McKin!ey
275; for all other candidates 217; contested
and doubtful 95; Vermont 8.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, MAY 4, 1896.
PROTECTION IS SAFE. SAVE SILVER.
This mates 757 delegates elected and
leaves 161 yet to be chosen. The contest
is not yet settled, and can alone be deter
mined by the delegates when they meet
in convention at St. Louis.
"NOT OUT Of THE WOODS."
What Eoc- Senator Platt Say a of the
McKinley Campaign.
NEW YOKK, May 3. - Ex- Senator
Thomas C. Platt made the following state
ment to-night:
"The McKinley followers are hurrahing
before they are out of the woods. If they
are to be believed, the man from Ohio has
already secured delegates enough to nomi
nate him at St. Louis, and the rest
of the proceedings are of no interest to
them.
"A glance at the actual state of affairs
shows that the contest for the Republican
nomination is still an open one, with the
chances in favor of one of Mr. McKinley's
opponents. Perhaps one of the fairest
and most reasonable of the McKinley
organs is the Philadelphia Press. It
prints a table every day giving its esti
mate of the strength of the different can
didates at the time. Its table of the 3d
instant shows that 768 delegates had been
chosen up to the evening of Saturday,
leaving 193 to be elected. It assigns 401 of
the delegates chosen to McKinley, 97 to
Reed, 69 to Morton, 12 to Cullom, 42 to
Allison, 56 to Quay, 16 to Bradley, and
places 75 in the doubtful list.
"It is certain tbatnot one of those among
the doubtful will vote for McKinley. His
managers have made an aggressive fight
in every State and in every district, and
where their men have been beaten it is
safe to say that the successful candidate is
not a McKinley delegate.
"As for the 401 votes claimed by the
latest Napoleon the seats of sixty-nine
delegates assigned to him from Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
South Carolina and Texas are contested,
and no properly constituted body would
think fora moment of allowing their flimsy
claims. The loss of these sixty-nine votes
reduces McKinley's strength at one blow
to 332 votes, or 129 less than the number
required to nominate him. And there re
main among these 332 not fewer than
eighteen from Indiana, four from Ten
nessee, four wrongfully claimed from
Maryland and two wrongfully claimed
from Kentucky â twenty-eight in all â
which will not be cast for the Canton can
didate. It is the most remarkable case of
counting chickens before they are hatched
that has ever yet been known."
GROSTESOR'S EXUBERANCE.
Thinks It It Hardly Neeetsary to Hold
a national Convention,
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 3.â The
statement of the McKinley strength by
General, Grosvenor is naturally very jubi
lant in tone. He 'says the present con
dition of the McKinley vote is as follows:

'â¢Here is a grand total of 495 votes. The
New York Tribune of ' this morning gives
McKinley 429, and the Chicago Times-
Herald will this morning, as I am informed
by a telegram just received, announce
442 votes, leaving a discrepancy of about
fifty- votes between \my 'figures and the
figures of these gentlemen.
"There are still : to 'be elected in Ohio

tion bad announced : themselves for Mc-
Kinley, and all the balance of the differ

ANIMOSITY THAT
GROWS WITH AGE.
Huntington's Bitter Hatred
of Senator Stanford's
Widow.
IS BENT UPON REVENGE.
Malicious Opposition to Every
Undertaking That Receives
Her Support.
SHE CHAMPIONS SAN PEDRO.
A Desire to Carry Oat Her Husband's
Wishes Antagonized by Fraud
and Forgery.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 3âThe
river and harbor bill comes up for consid
eration in the Senate to-morrow. Senators
White, Perkins, Allison, Caffrey, Nelson,
Vest, Pasco, Berry and other strong men
will advocate Senator White's amend
ment providing that the money appropri
ated for a deep-sea harbor on the Southern
California coast be expended wherever
recommended by the commission (to be
appointed).
Richard C. Kerens of St. Louis says that
Huntington is more concerned about his
Santa Monica deep-harbor project than
the fate of the refunding bill. Kerens ex
plains that it was one of Senator Stan
ford's pet schemes to improve San Pedro,
and that Mrs. Stanford, who zealously
supported her husband in all things dur
ing his lifetime, is yet hoping that San
Pedro will be selected. It is a matter of
sentiment with her now, for she remem
bers how earnestly Governor Stanford de
sired the San Pedro improvements.
Mr. Kerens says that Huntington not
only harbors animosity toward Mrs. Stan
ford for joining with the Crockers to op
pose him for president of the Southern
Pacific, but his recollection of Mrs. Stan
ford's social ostracism of Mrs. Huntington
several years ago stirs his revengeful and
vindictive disposition and urges him to
defeat Mrs. Stanford's ambition at all
hazards.
"Huntington does not care so much for
money as to vent his spleen," declared
Mr. Kerens.
It is understood that an investigation is
being hela by the Public Printer to ascer
tain why the words "San Pedro" were
eliminated and "Santa Monica"substituted
in lieu thereof in a petition signed by 200
representative California citizens, who
wired to Washington in favor of the
former place. The printed report of the
Commerce Committee proceedings con
tains this petition, but, instead of "San
Pedro," the print makes it appear that
they favor "Santa Monica."
The fact that Huntington's agents have
been industriously distributing these prints
naturally creates a suspicion that the typo
graphical change was made at their insti
gation, and possibly by undue influence;
but one of the proof-readers at the Govern
ment Printing Office explains that when
he saw the words "San Pedro" in that
petition he thought "Santa Monica" was
intended, so he made tne change. The
Commerce Committee has ordered a new
issue of its proceedings to be printed.
The San Pedro people have thoroughly
exposed the trick of Santa Monica's ad
herents in wiring to Washington a petition
in favor of the latter place, signed by 1500
names, a great portion of which are ficti
tious, some being the names of dead men
taken from inscriptions on tombstones in
the cemetery at Los Angeles. The name
of Colonel H. G. Otis, editor of the Lo
Angeles Times, appeared. This, .'as an
nounced in The Call, was a stupid for
gery, Tor Colonel Otis has been fighting
Banta Monica vigorously, and has been as
earnestly supporting San Pedro.
WILL BENDY LYNCHED
The Texas Desperado Shot While Trying
to Escape From a Mob and
Hanged to a Tree.
BEAUMONT, Tex., May 3. â Judge
Lynch has cut short the career of Will
Bendy. Yesterday evening the last report
came in that a strong posse bad Bendy
surrounded in the thicket about half a
mile from Bnna and that he was almost
sure to be captured.
This morning early a message was re
ceived that Bendy had left the thicket
and bad sought refuge in the home of his
brother-in-law and there the determined
party found him. He was not quick
enough in yielding, when a shot rang out.
This was at 3 o'clock in the morning.
The shot wounded him and he began run
ning. When about fifty yards away he
gave in and was led by the crowd to
the old Orange and Jasper dirt road.
Here a suitable tree was found and the
rope quickly adjusted that swung him up.
His body was riddled with bullets and
left hanging. Constable Bibbo, E. B.
Rone and Roxy Wallâ the last two col
ored â are still alive, though suffering se
verely from their wounds. Phillip Haines
was interred to-day.
"SWIPES" USKO HIS TEETH.
Foul fighting on a Sunday Evening at
â Lincoln, Sebr.
LINCOLN, Nkbr.. May 3.â Two hun
dred Lincoln sports paid $2 apiece this
evening for the privilege of seeing a three
round mill between Marion Mclntyre of
Lincoln, champion middleweight of
Nebraska, and "Swipes the Newsboy" of
New York, who declined to give any other
name. The fight was held in the woods at
Cushruan Park for a purse of $200 and the
receipts.
"Swipes" had the advantage of weight
and was the aggressor in the first round.
In the second Mclntyre took his measure
and landed some good ones, receiving one
hard blow in return. In the third during
a clinch Swipes fastened his teeth in his
antagonist's arm, bringing the blood. A
foul was claimed and the referee gave the
tight to Mclntyre.
To appease the crowd Mclntyre and
Paddy Purtell of Kansas City sparred
three rounds, with honors even." A finish
right between the latter two is being
arranged.
A GALLANT OFFICER DEAD.
Commander Felix McCurley, Cap
tain of the League Island
Navy-Yard.
Passes Away Full of Years and Hon
ors â Was Under Fire More Than
Forty Times.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 3.âCom
mander Felix McCurley, U. S. N., Captain
of the League Island Navy-yard, died at
that station this morning of heart failure.
Commander McCurley was born in Balti
more in 1815 and early in life entered the
merchant marine service. When the war
broke out he entered the United States
navy as I acting master. He served
throughout the war with great gallantry
and was under fire more than forty times.
In action he was conspicuous for cool
ness and intrepidity and the encourage
ment he gave his men. At the conclusion
of the war be was attached to various
squadrons in different parts of the world.
Twice while on the Asiatic station in com
mand of the U. S. S. Alliance be rescued
shipwrecked crews at sea, and on both
occasions received the thanks of the
Chinese Government.
He was appointed Captain of the League
Island Navy-yard in April, 1893. To date
of his death Commander McCurley was a
splendid type of the volunteer officer, of
which the War of the Rebellion produced
so many examples, and was one of the
most widely known officers in the service.
His many nne[qualities of heart and mind
a nd his skill as a sailor endeared him to
and brought him the confidence of all who
ever sailed with him:
BIG STRIKE AT MILWAUKEE.
All Employes of the Electric Streetcar
Compnny Go Out.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., May 3. â The
strike of 900 motormen, conductors and
barn hands of the Milwaukee Street Rail
way Company is now a settled fact and the
men will not return to work after the last
oar has been housed tonight. President
Mahon of tbe Amalgamated Association
of Street Railway Employes to-night or
dered the men out at 4:30 o'clock Monday
morning.
The controversy turns on two of eleven
demands made by the men, viz. : A raise
of wages from 19 to 20 cents per hour for
motorinen and conductors and the recog
nition by the company of the union and
settlement of all disputed questions by a
board of arbitration.
The electricians of the company, num
bering about fifty men, are not yet in
cluded in the strike, but have declared
that they will not work together with non
union motormen and conductors, which
means that they will also join the strikers
as soon as the company employs them.
MAUNA LOA IN ERUPTION.
Lava Jetted to a Great Height From the
Crater of the Hawaiian
Volcano.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 23.âMau
naLoa volcano broke out in eruption about
1 a. m. of the 21st, as observed from the
steamer Kinace, coming down from Hilo.
A telephone message from Hilo to Ka
waihae gave an estimate of 4000 feet as the
height of a column of Java jetted from the
summit, as seen from Hilo, forty miles
distant. As seen by daylight from Ka
waibae, the emission of smoke was im
mense.
Tbe following night the illumination of
the clouds was brilliant as seen from La
haina, 110 miles as the bird flies. None
but the greatest eruptions have hereto
fore been conspicuous at Latiaina. Last
night the glow over Mauna Loa was seen
from tbe lookout at Diamond Head, 180
miles distant.
These facts indicate an eruption of un
usual magnitude. It is probable that a
great lava stream is flowing down the
mountain, which is 13,600 feet high.
Nothing can be known here of its direc
tion for borne days, whether inland or
toward some part of the shore, or whether
it threatens destruction to any plantation
or village.
MATABELES RETIRE.
Communication Established From Buluwayo \
to Fort Salisbury, Mafeking and
the South.
LONDON, Eira., May 3.â Earl Grey, ad
ministrator of the British South Africa
Company, has telegraphed from Bulu
wayo to Colonial Secretary Chamberlain
that tbe rebellious Matabeles who were
threatening that town have retired. He
adds that the lines of communication from
Buluwayo to Fort Salisbury, Mafeking
and the south have been secured. The
consensus of opinion is that the Matabeles
are preparing for a permanent movement
to the north.
Millennium Festiritie of Nudo-Pestk.
BUDA-PESTH, Hungary, May 3.-The
celebration of the National millennium of
Hungary was continued to-day. The city
is crowded with visitors and on every side
the greatest enthusiasm is displayed.
After dark the city presented a most beau
tiful spectacle, being superbly decorated.
Nearly every building was a mass of light.
BISHOP Of SOUTH DAKOTA
Right Rev. Thomas O'Gorman
Is Installed by Arch
bishop Ireland.
Twenty Priests Assisted in the Cere
monies â Seating Capacity of the
Church Overtaxed.
SIOUX FALLS, 8. D., May 3.â Right
Rev. Thomas O'Gorman, formerly of the
Catholic University of the United States,
was to-day installed as Bishop of South
Dakota, to succeed Bishop Martin Marty,
transferred to St. Cloud, Minn.
The impressive ceremonies were con
ducted by Archbishop Ireland. Admis
sion to the church was by tickets, made
necessary by. the limited seating capacity.
The Archbishop was assisted by Bishop J.
B. Cotter of Winona, Bishop John Shan
ley of Fargo and about twenty priests.
Archbishop Ireland in the course of an
eloquent discourse said that twenty years
ago when Bishop Marty was installed
over the diocese of Dakota there were but
three priests in the diocese, that Territory
having since been divided into two flour
ishing dioceses and the expansion had
just began.
Bishop O'Gorman spoke feelingly of the
relations he had just severed and of tne
responsibilisy he was assuming.
Last night the distinguished guests were
tendered an informal reception at the Cata
ract House which was attended by 500 citi
zens, over half of wnom were Protestants.
Rev. T. B. Scott of the First Congrega
tional Church was the lirst ono to enter
the reception-room.
To-morrow evening the citizens will
tender the Archbishop and Bishop O Gor
man a banquet, at which covers will be
laid lor 200. Among those who will re
spond to toasts are: Archbishop Ireland,
Bishop O'Gorman and Bishop W. H. Hare
of the Episcopal diocese of South Dakota.
DEATH OF GEORGE S. CUE.

NEW YORK, May 3.â George S. Coe,
for nearly thirty years president of the
American Exchange bank of this city,
died at his home at Englewood Cliffs, N.
J., this morning. The immediate cause
of his deaia was paralysis, of which
disease he had had several strokes. Mr.
Coe was born in Newport, R. L. on March
27, 1827.
For more than thirty years there was no
banker in the United States whose opinion
was more generally sought or whose judg
ment on financial subjects was more gen
erally trusted than Mr. Coe's. He was an
intimate friend of President Lincoln and
Secretary Chase and during the darK days
of the Rebellion was freauently sum
moned to consult with the officers oJ the
administration concerning financial ques
tions of importance. Mr. Coe devised the
system of issuing clearing-house certifi
cates, and this system has been the means
of arresting many panics.

SACRAMENTO, Cau, May 3.-All daf
long the various committees have been
busy perfecting preparations for the Re
publican State Convention, and to-night
they announced that all arrangements
were complete.
In the Pavilion the snowy canvas walls
have been decorated with multi-colored
banners and streamers, which gleam and
glisten beneath the glare of electric-dights.
It has been decided to seat the delegates
by Congressional districts and they have,
been arranged as follows: The First,
Second and Third will occupy chairs to
the right of the platform; the Fourth and
Fifth will be in ihe center, and the Sixth
and Seventh in the adjoining aisle to the
left. .
Even though it was Sunday and but few
arrivals of importance in the political cir
cles of the State were recorded, there was
quite a lively appearance to the lobby, of
fice and other convenient places for
small groups to" gather in and about
the Golden Eagle Hotel, particularly after
the arrival of a San Francisco delegation
on the train that arrived at 10 o'clock.
This was not large, but its insignificancy
in numbers was lost sight of in the im
portance of the individuals.
Until long after midnight there was the
bum and noise about the Golden Eagle in
cident to important political gatherings in
Sacramento.
Among the most notable arrivals to
day from San Francisco were: J. D.
Spreckels, E. F. Preston, Jake Steppacher,
J. H. Mahoney, S. L. Lent. George T.
Phelphs, J. S. Speak, C. M. Kyle, 80l
Berliner, R. 8. Alexander, Jake Shaen, C.
T. Bassett, Dan T. Cole, George Stone and
George .C. Fardee.
From other points came James A.
Loutitt of Stockton and E. S. Dennison of
Oakland. Then there was the Woman's
Suffrage delegation, which has come to
see that it gets proper recognition in the
platform adapted by the convention.
This delegation comprised: Mrs. A. A.
Sargent of San Francisco, Mrs. Knoz
Goodrich of San Jose, and Mrs. Ida A.
Harper of Oakland.
Strong efforts will be made, it is stated,
to-night by the Sacramento Citizens Com
mittee to secure the position of chief sec
retary of the convention for District At
torney FrahK D. Ryan, and that of ser
geant-at-arms for Sheriff Fred Johnson.
The local McKinley League will open
headquarters at the Golden. Eagle to-mor
row in order to boom the Ohio man's can
didacy before the convention.
Sacramento County's delegation is out
strong for silver and will insist on a silver
plank in the platform.
Those who are in the secret are enjoy
ing, in expectation, the humors of a situa
tion in which Sheriff Jones of Colusa, a
notorious practical joker, is to figure for
once, according to the plan laid out, as a
victim.
He telegraphed Sheriff Johnson that he
was coming here as a delegate, and re
quested ihat suitable accommodations be
provided for him. He was telegraphed
that Sheriff Johnson would meet him at
the depot.
Johnson then ordered a cell in the
woman's department of the jail denuded
of everything but a bare cot and a couple
of bouquets, and into' this the joker from
Colusa will be taken on his arrival, which
will be watched with eagerness by a crowd
of mutual friends of the Sacramento and
Colusa Sheriffs.
In view of tbe fact that considerable
talk has been indulged in relative to the
stand of John D. Spreckels in the matter
of Presidential references, that gentleman
was approached on the subject to-night
and spoke as follows:
"I am a Republican, working in the in
tests of the party and of California. lam
not opposed to McKinley now and never
have been. I think it is to the best inter
ests oi California that the delegation
should go uninstructed. Any of the can
didates that have been mentioned will be
acceptable to me."
While matters are necessarily in a cha
otic condition at this time, it is known
that E. F. Preston will be put forward for
chairman of the convention, and there is
also some talk of Charles f . Jones, ex-Dis
trict Attorney of Sacramento, in connec
tion with this honor.
A PLEA FOR SILVER,
Pronounced Views of Mark
Sheldon, the Well-Known
Capitalist.
How much confusion comes to the ordinary
mind from reading statistics and cumulative
figures upon the silver question. The more wo
labor with dates and numbers tne more un
settled in opinion the most of us become.
Simple facts are what the student Of this ques
tion wants. Was gold and silver authorized
to be coined as money by the constitution, and
if so why should Congress stop the one and
continue the other ? This is what the ordi
nary voter would like to know. Were formid
able petitions sent up to Congress from com
mercial bodies and frc-ni manufacturing and
agricultural associations demanding a change
in the coinage act in 1873, or any other
time ? Was there an Otis or a John Quincy
Adams as in former years with petitions from
the people asking for the correction of abuses
and demanding their constitutional rights?
Did we hear of anything like this in 1873 T2
Bo far from It we have the testimony of Car
lisle. Blalne, Thurmin, Allison, Garfield and
Beck to the effect that > the character of â¢ this
bill was hot known by them, Rnd also one of
our citizens, then a member of Congress; from
Illinois,' declaring that he had no idea that
half of the coin of ultimate redemption was to
be dropped from its use^'as suchr ,- V "'- i Â» 'i â¢'
Fortunately the demand for silver for other
nses has been and? is large or there, ycould be
far less value to that meial to-day. A man in
vesting $100,000 in a silver mine in 1872 has
Buffered as a wrong from the Congres
sional art of 1873 as a horticulturist would, if,
after Investing a like sum in lands for the cul
tivation of fruits. Congress should pass an act
that the product of his orchard should only be
gold to adult males, shutting the grower out
' from m"ore than half of the former market.
The former would be the greater wrong, for the
constitution declares that gold and silver shall
be coined into money and Congress shall regu
late the value thereof: it did not say it shall
cease the coinage of either one or the other.
It is doubted if the silver-coinnge act would
stand approved by our Supreme Court. Con
press, it'is claimed by a distinguished author
ity, is limited to regulating the value between
the two metals.
We hear from all parts of our country a com
plaint of the times; they are hard here in Cali
fornia. -Since the first settlement of the State
we have had our periodical set-backs, but never
have we had so continuous, so bitter, so pro
tracted a check to our prosperity as now. A
worthy ritizen of Sacramento has a remedy in
part by proposing a bounty to be given to the
growers of grains. A few enterprising and
public-spirited men came together here last
summer and in a tew days, not only resolved
but raised the funds to build nn independent
railway through one of tho most fertile valleys
of the State, engaging to freight its products to
this City at the minimum ot' cost, without bo
great care for the dividends as to stimulate
trade and give hope to the producer. All this
is good and in keeping with California spirit.
Why should this State hesitate in giving its
support to the restoration of silver to its former
and constitutional place as one of the metals
of ultimate redemption, by unlimited coinage,
thereby placing it where it has ever been since
the days of Hamilton and Jefferson? Would
not this legislation revive an industry that
this City is indebted to in no small degree for
her growth and prosperity? One third of the
wealth Vf tins Citycame from the Nevada sil
ver rr.irres.
. One o!.Â«,ur great statesmen, James G. Blame,
tells us "that politics is intelligent selfish
ness." How then can we hesitate in our in
structions to our representatives or petitions to
Congress in this matter? It is safe to predict
that within six months after the repeal of the
act restricting the free coinage of silver our
foundries would be busy turning out new silver
j mills, our merchants immediately would feel a
new impulse to trade, our manufacturers
would be asking themselves "Why could we
navehesitnted and remain Inactive these many
years and permit one of our most valuable cus
. tomers to be choked and destroyed by the siren
pong of the promoters of doubtful schemes,
â who have been telling us that this Congres
-1 sional repeal will ruin the market for the sale
of our bonds in London
â¢ The cry comes up from the monometallistg:
"Oh, you are one of those who wish to pay
your debts with r fifty-cent dollar." This un
friendly legislation toward silver alone has
made it a fifty-cent dollar. Uncle Sam has
done a wro*ig not only to the debtor class but
also to a great American industry. Returning
consciousness and impending* bankruptcy
throughout the country should prompt him to
retrieve the wrong by restoring silver to its
former historic place as a coin of ultimate re
demption. I don't think our members of Con
gress were criminal in this action, but Ido
think -they made a terrible and thoughtless
mistake, and we have suffered from it ever
since. It is the principal cause of our present
hard times .
â¢ With -an increase of the world's roods, wares
â¢ and estates and a stationary amount of the
measure of value, what would be the effect on
p.rlces? A first-grade schoolboy would tell you
that the prices would decline materially. Then
cut off say one-half, or approximately so, as
the Congress of 1873 did do, what then could
occur but what we have seen, a constant ana
continuous trend of prices downward. The
yield of the gold and silver mires of the coun
try keeps pace with its increasing population
and its-growth of business. To depend upon
the caprice of Congress to expand and contract
â  the currency wouln-be dangerous and uncer
tain, giving to>bnsiness that precarious feature
that characterised it during the Civil War and
the period before the resumption of specie pay
mentÃ. â¢
The product of the gold and silver mines Is
the only safe and sure supply for money of
' ultimate redemption and measure of values.
The greenbacks should be redeemed slowly
and gradually by the issue of uohi and silver
.certificates against the coin held in the treas
ury after the adoption of unlimited coinage of
silver, and then coin no gold below $10. lam
for bimetallism with international co-opera
tion, it we canâ but bimetallism alone, with a
tariff on silver coming from all nations un
friendly to an international agreement.
National banks should be continued, sur
rounded with all safeguards, as in the past, for
local- convenience and needs. Tne American
press, .-that great molder of public sentiment.
is, unfortunately, too often found in sentiment
"with that lately decayed founder of a weekly
journal who confessed, when confronted with
the charge that he was unfriendly to that class
of producers in this country in its contentions
for a material reduction in freight and fares,
that he was "early taken in out of the cold."
Is it not reasonable to believe that a large num
ber, and a large majority .of the news vendors
of this country are actuated by the same im
plied reasons, but, perhaps, do not believe, as
he evidently did, that "open confession was
good for the soul," and are found with the
advocates of the single standard?
â¢ Railway bonds are maturing yearly in large
numbers and for large amounts. The trustees
of these corporations (I say trustees; what an
abused word) grow rich by their management,
and too often manage them into bankruptcy.
They must pay the interest on their bonds and
keep them floating, else they lose control.
Then- they become like a defeated party in our
municipality; their nose is ont nf the troush
â¢ It is much easier for them to keep in, when the
coin for the ultimate reden.piiou of their
bonds are restricted to gold. But bow tares
the great producer when in his former normal
condition that carried him through that great
period -of prosperity from 1850 to 1873? I fear
that this depression may continue until that
. great class of struggling debtors may lie down
in despair and say as many are saying to-day:
"Do take my land and my farm and return to
me my bond and mojtgage." Then, through
. enforced idleness, they drift into our army of
tramps, already too large.
Mr. St. John, the president of the Mercantile
National Bank of the City of New York, in his
address to his colleagues at Atlanta last year,
reminded them that there were other callings
besides banking that required the fostering
care of legislation or soon there would be no
banks or hankers wanted, and declared that
the demonetization of silver was slowly but
surely killing the " goose that laid the golden
egg," and commended to them the remonetiza
ticm of silver. I trust that the representatives
from this State of the two great parties, when
they meet in National convention, will see to
it that they will not be a party to the killing
of the goose that lays our silver egg as well as
our golden one.
Our merchants are much concerned just now
because of the arrival from Japan of an in
- voice of furniture sold at prices far less than
It could be produced here, and they have al
ready invoked our Chamber of Commerce to
beseech Congress to give them some relief. I
am no prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I
predict that in ten years, let the tariff remain
as it is now and take no concern to remonetlze
silver, giving the Japanese the present advan
tage of a 60 per cent difference in the price of
labor an 1 a 50 per cent premium on the cur
rency they sell their goods for here over the
currency they pay their workmen, their rents
and other expenses incident to the manufac
turing establishment, and you will soon see
the Merrimac and the Connecticut River
water-powers unused and such a depression
throughout this country that these times will
bo looked upon as extra good. Let these con
ditions pass unheeded and we will all ba in a
financial "sweat-box" at no distant day.
There are many sharp as well as many good
and harmless persons in both parties who in
dulge the hope that England will soon join us
in an international agreement for the unlim
ited coinage of silver or as our party platforms
have put it a "greater use for silver." lam
not one of those. India is England's great
farm. She pays her farm hands and the other
expenses of production in a fifty cent dollar
and sells the product of tier lands for a hun
dred cent dollar. Is she likely to soon sur
render the advantage and ask lor an Interna
tional conference on the money question? We
try to c >mpet9 with her in growing wheat and
cotton by paying the expense of farming with
a hundred cent dollar. How long can this con
tinue and keep our farming out of the bank
rupt court? is the question that now confronts
us.* ..- â¢ â  ' ;
I was in Washington during the concluding
days of Buchanan's administration and lis
tened to the belligerent as well as the patriotic
speeches of that historic .period. One I re
member brought down loud clamor and noisy
.'.indorsements from listening crowd in the
gallery. The venerable and patriotic Senator
t'oote of Vermont was in . the chair, and rising
to' his full height and striking his gavel with
all his power said: "Should this demonstra
tion be repeated I will certainly order the
chamber closed." The speaker who was ad
dressing the Senate at the time responded:
"We had better go a little slow with orders to
close the galleries, lest they come down here
end clean us out." Who knows but had the
speaker's apprehensions been realized we
might have averted at least for a season a ter
rible war ? lam not a croaker, but the bitter
ness with which this financial question is being
waged and the large numbers that really be
lieve they are cruelly . wronged remind me
* much of what I heard in Washington in 1881.
I have no sympathy with those too zealous sil
ver : Senators, so called, who would â  bee the
country's : pressing demands go to protest
. rather than vote for an "emergency tariff bill"
unless coupled with silver legislation. This
savors too ranch of the nullification tactics of
Calhoun. I - would save the country's credit
first ; then would do justice to those who have
suffered fron> the wrongs of 1873.
I whs amaied wnen told a few weeks since
by the president and secretary of the Agricul
tural Insurance Company of Watertown, N. V.,
that they no longer Insured farm improve
ments, when untii a year since their business
was wholly confined to that class of risks; that
incendiarism.-was far more frequent when mort
jj;i#e ioreciosÂ«res were so common as they are;
that tli'.TC was no money in that class of busi
ness, but loss was certain.
There seems to be a great dread comes to
many in contemplation ot the restoration of
silver lest we lose all our gold. Suppose we do
(which I do not apprehend), does accumulated,
gold alone make a nation or an individual
strong financially? It it the bonds of solvent na
tions that give to England her right to rank first
among the nations of the earth, and the mer
chandise and bills receivable and ships held
by her merchants, her shipping and her com
mercial corporate bodies that gives them a
right to the supreme rank they enjoy.
Let the United States establish reciprocal
trade with Me.\ico, Central America and the
Scuth American States upon lines marked out
by Garrieid's administration and a protective
tariff against all nations manufacturing goods
that we produce. Then with whom would the
silver nations tra.de, we being on the silver
basis of 16 to 1? Commerce is the objective
point of all wise governments. Our City can
only realize the dreams and hopes of its
founders by fostering legislation that will en
courage and bring to our gate the trade of
those whose geographical position naturally
centers here.
The next great need of our country Is the
opening up of our inland waterways, the con
struction of our Nicaragua canal, owned and
operated by the Government as Suez is by the
English. Oh, for an Earl of Beaconsfield in
our country as wise and far seeing, to impress
upon our Congress this great necessity to us.
It would prove the crowning blessing of the
nineteenth century for the American Republic.
That party will succeed which has for its
shibboleth protection, the construction of the
Nicaragua canal and free coinage of gold and
silver as in the past, because It will bring the
greatest good to the greatest number of citizens
of this Republic. Mark Sheldon.

IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY
Republican Delegates Oppotett to In
structions for McKinley.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., May 3.â The dele
gates to the Sacramento Convention elected
in this county yesterday, together with a
contingent of newspaper representatives
and "influential Republicans" left for the
capital city thi? afternoon. The delegation
is practically solid lor Hervey Lindley as
one of the district aelegates to the St.
Louis convention, and will line up with
about equal unanimity for ex-Governor
Sheldon a* one of the four delegates-at
large to the National Convention. Sheldon,
however, will meet with avery formidable
opposition from the friends of U. 8. Grant
of San Diego in the Seventh (Bowers')
Congressional District. The county con
ventions of the Seventh district have
nearly all been instructed to support
Grant, while in this district, and especially
in this county, nothing has been said
openly as to "either position. It is well
known that despite the antagonisms of
four years ago between Sheldon and Lind
ley, they are now on the best of terms, so
the delegation from this county may be
expected to stand together on all proposi
tions affecting the interests of either
aspirants.
The contest for either of these'gentle
mcn has been carried forward on the still
nunt plan, with a secrecy and finesse
seldom witnessed in political affairs. The
delegates are absolutely non-committal on
the question of preferences lor National
delegates, and yet it is confidentidlly
asserted thai the most perfect understand
ine exists.
At the late assembly district conventions,
while considerable air was acitated in be
half of Congressman McLachlan's renomi
nation, an ominous silence prevailed in all
the assembly conventions yave one â
Compton â on the question of the double
harbor fight. Not one word of censure
was uttered in condemnation of the lately
extosed fraudu.ent methods of Hunting
ton's local henchmen in behalf of the
Southern Pacific's breakwater at Santa
Monica,
Ventura County offers vigorous protest
against the plan to renominate McLachlan
by acclamation.
While there has been a great amount of
r.oise and some presumably genuine en
thusiasm over the candidacy of McKinley
of Ohio, the prediction is here made that
the majority of the delegates from Los
Angeles Count}- are opposed to instruc
tions and a pledged delegation to St.
Louis. They are not in favor of tying the
hands of their representatives at ht. Louis.
A strong sentiment exists here among the
best element of the party opposed to
pledges of any sort.
VWEATER AT PORTLAND.
The Populist Leader Predicts Victory for
Sis Party.
PORTLAND, Ok., May 3. â General
James B. Weaver of lowa, Populist candi
date for the Presidency four years ago, is
here. He said to-day :
"The prospect is that the gold men will
control both the Democratic and Republi
can National Conventions. The recent
capture of the Michigan Democratic State
convention by the gold wing of the Demo
cratic party, and the Euclid-Martin gold
convention in Nebraska practically settle
the question as to who will control the
Chicago convention. The Administration
will have it solid and fast. It goes with
out saving that the Republican convention
at St. Louis will pronounce in favor of the
goid standard.
"From present indications McKinley
will be the Republican Presidential nomi
nee. This will open the way to the union
of all the silver and currency reform forces
at St. Louis. The two conventions, Popu
list and Silver, meet in that city
on July 22, and it is certain that tney will
unite on a common platform and ticket.
Over 400 delegates have already been se
lected for the Populist National Conven
tion and fully 90 per cent of these favor a
union.
"We are to have 1860 over again. The
Democratic party is dying, just as did the
Whig party, and from the same disease.
It has adopted the policy of toe Republi
can party respecting the great question of
finance, and that is fatal to the organiza
tion.
"There are new issues involved since the
close of the war, caused by the growth of
civilization, which are pressing for a solu
tion, and which will be solved, just as was
the slavery question, by the union of all
men and organizations who feel and be
lieve alike. It is the only sensible thing
to do, &rA 'union of forces' is the watch
word of the hour. Nothing can stay its
progress. The great question of the day is
that of finance, and until it is solved all
others must be held in abeyance.
"I have never witnessed anything like
the present uprising. The commotion is
greater than in 1860 for the reason that
there are more people involved and that it
extends into every village and hamlet in
the land."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896.
AN UNPLEDGED
DELEGATION,
Oregon, Not California, to
Receive a Cabinet
Portfolio.
DANGER IN TIED HANDS
Ex-Senator Dolph Said to Expect
the Secretaryship of the
Interior.
A TALK WITH MR. WAYMIBE.
M. R. Hanna Intimates Nothing More
Definite Than That Ihe Pacific
Slope Wi 1 Be Considered.
There are two or three things that Cali
fornia has a right to expect to come to her
like a birthright out of the return to power
of the Republican party next fall. The
question of that return is not open. The
people are impatient for November to wit
ness it. The claims of States and of men
are being set up, and those whose claims
will be heard and granted are those who
from the beginning are both busy and in
sistent and wise. Tr.e especial title that
California lays claim to is a place for one
of ncr sons in the Cabinet, the portfolio of
the Interior for instance.
Another thing that California expects is
that the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver at a ratio of 16 to 1 shall be declared as
the policy of the Government.
These things must not be merely as
sented to with a nod or admitted by in
direction. They must be written with ink
into the articles of war arid the stipula
tions of peace at the very beginning; that
is to say, before the balloting begins at
St. Louis. California is a large common
wealth; it is the prime factor in politics
and trade on the western half of this
continent. It is the business of its people to
see to it that it receives due recognition.
A great number of things of the
first importance to California depend
upon these two things â representation in
the Cabinet and free bilver. The Call be
lieves that California should go to the St.
Louis convention with her representatives
free to work for these ends.
For that reason The Call has urged and
will continue to urge tiiat the State dele
gation shall not be pledged to any man
until the man is first pleaded to grant
tnese reasonable demands of the State.
It is admitted generally that the Pacific
Slope deserves representation. If so, it
should be represented by a citizen of Cali
fornia. Oregon long ago was given a place
in the National Council. California now
demands the same iavor as her National
riput.
Ex-Judge Jamea A. Waymire, member
o; the State Legislature, assumes to speak
for Major McKinley. and bis attitude
toward California in these matters. He
has been quite industrious in giving out
the impression that California was secure
for a place in the Cabinet. He has directly
-tated that he had it in the handwriting of
M. A. Hanna, AfcKinley's manager, mat
bis mends in California might rest as
sured that from their number a Cabinet
officer would be selected.
To ascertain the facts concerning the
matter â exactly upon what these assur
ances were basedâ a reporter of The Call
visited Judge Waymire in his office
and put the question directly to him,
"Has Governor McKinley or his manager,
Mr. Hanna, made any statement to the
effect that California shall have a place in
the Cabinet?"
Mr. Waymire hesitated an instant and
then said: "No, he has not. 1 cannot
say that I am authorized to make any
promises in that regard."
"Have you any communications from
him on the subject at all?"
"No, not directly."
"Have you from anybody representing
him?"
Judge W'aymire looked over a heap of
correspondence which was carefuily sorted
out on a hie and produced a letter from
Mr. Hanna, dated the 20th of February,
in which it was written as % 'a hint for you
to work on," that in the language of the
letter, "I understand that the Pacific
Slope feels a strong desire to secure a Cabi
net office, and I have to say that person
ally I think tney shou!d have one.' f
'â¢Is this all?" was asked.
"No," said Mr. Waymire. 'i have an
other letter which states the case more
specifically. It was written on April 7."
This letter was produced and in it Mr.
Hanna went so far as to say: "I have
heard Governor McKinley say that that
section of the country was certainly en
titled to a representative in the National
family and ought to have been recognized
before."
"Is this all?" was asked.
"That is ail."
"Nothing later?"
"Nothins later. Mr. Hanna, I may add,
says that he heartily concurs in the senti
ment as expressed to him by Major Mc-
Kinley."
"No names have been mentioned?"
"No; Mr. Hanna says that the Governor
has refrained from making any promises
to anybody tor any specific office.
"Nor any specific section from which to
choose a secretary?"
"No."
This was as near as the approach was
made to the offer of a portfolio to Califor
nia. Notwithstanding these vague inti
mations to Judge Waymire a common re
port is in circulation that ex-Senator
Dolph of Oregon has received much more
definite information about the Cabinet
office than this. The common report dis
tinctly says that Oregon and not Califor
nia is slated for the honor and that ex-
Senator Dolph is the man. Certainly Gov
ernor McKinley cannot be charged with
breaking bis word to Judge Waymire if it
falls to his lot to keep any word that may
have been given in-his behalf to Senator
Dolph, for Oregon is certainly on the Pa
cific Slope.
For this reason it has been asked. Is Cali
fornia's dalegation to tie its hands and
then go to St. Louis to discover that Ore
<- on and not California is to be giveu a
place in the Cabinet?
It has been thoughtfully urged by Sena
tor Perkins, who is at the front and better
understands the situation than we do, re
mote from the East, that we suould send
to St. Louis a delegation unpledged to any
particular candidate and free to demand
and abie to secure something for Califor
nia. Tne views of Senator Perkins are
not to be construed into any hostility to
McKinley or any other of the Presidential
candidates. Senator Perkins is counsel
ing the Republicans of the State and
pointing out how they can secure the best
results and accomplish most for the State.
His views are re-enforced by the strong ar
guments of General Chipman, Charles F.
Reed and other Republicans, who it is ad
mitted on all hands are wise counselors
and seek to advance the best interests of
the State.
It is urged by these and other Repub
licans that our delegation should be un
trammeled in their action so far as men
are concerned; for untrammeled with
tli ir favor to bestow they can demand
and receive recognition of certain meas
ures of peculiar and vital importance to
California and the selection of one of our
own citizens to guard our interests in the
Cabinet.
The new* that Oregon is to receive a
recognition for which California has strug
gled so long will be dispiriting to the Re
publicans of California. It has been given
out by Judge Waymire and others that
California must have a place in the Cabi
net. Many Republicans have gone along
relying upon this assurance.
Many earnest Republicans and delegates
to the Sacramento convention have been
told that Judge Waymire wouid be the
dispenser of Federal patronage, and that
among the gifts would be a Cabinet posi
tion; but in view of the Judge's disclaimer
this hope must be abandoued.
The loyal Republicans of San Francisco
are becoming weary of the impudent pre
tensions of Martin Kelly to represent the
Republican party. Delegates from the in
terior who assisted in giving such a splen
did vote for Morris M. Estee are relied
upon to put a quietus on the bold and cor
rupt scheme of Kelly and his aiders and
abettors to seat his forged-proxy delegates
from the Fourth Congressional District.
It has now become thorou hly understood
by the Republicans throughout the State
that Kelly is trying to get back into
power, and that to permit him to do so
will cost the party its chances of success
in San Francisco. From San Diego to the
north, everywhere in the State, Republi
cans know and realize that John D.
Spreckels is in the party, not for pelf or
corruption, but to aid the party and
through it the best interests of the people.
"I am not a politician, but I am a
staunch Republican," said a prominent
merchant in the corridor of the Palace
Hotel yesterday, "and I cannot for
a moment believe that the loyal
Republicans of California will ever
again permit Kelly to become the boss
of the party in San Francisco. To do
so would be to bring back the disgraceful,
corrupt machine which Mr. Spreckels has
bad the courage to attack and smash. To
recognize Kelly would be to disgrace tne
party in San Francisco and the State. It
would be suicide."
From interviews with many delegates
who are in San Francisco on their way to
Sacramento the assurance is given that
the Republicans of this City need have no
fear that Kelly and his methods will re
ceive the approval of the interior coun tie?.
General N. P. Chipman is mentioned for
chairman of the convention. Frank L.
Coombs of Napa is also sDoken of for the
office. It is not definitely known whether'
Frank H. Short of Freaho will be a can
didate for chairman, though his name has
been mentioned. There see ma to be no
opposition to Speaker John Lynch for the
nomination for Lieutenaut-Governor.
THE GREAT BATTLE
AS IT STANDS,
f Continued from Mr*l Paoe.l
cause contests have been filed. Wherever
our delegates appear to have only a con
testant claim, based on flimsy foundation,
I have excluded them; but it would be the
height of folly and impertinence on my
part to say that a conventionâ to illustrate,
Florida â that had three out of four of the
elected delegates was not to be counted
among the McKinley votes.
"Then again, the contesting delegations
in Mississippi, without undertaking to de
cide which is regular and which is not,
have declared with substantial unity, each
of them and both of them, that they are
all or practically all of them for McKinley.
"So it will appear in the end, when we
reach St. Louis, that my table of votes to
day, which I here present, will be more
tban verified by the ultimate result when
the roll of the convention is called â if it
ever is called â upon the nomination for
Presideut of the United Stages.
"Last week *I omitted Connecticut be
cause I did not see fit to raise any ques
tions that would irritate anybody, but I
have received letters and telegrams from
Connecticut this weeK that make it imper
ative to place six, and, in my judgment, I
ought to place eight of the Connecticut
votes for McKinley.
"There are in the States enumerated by
me east of the Alleghany Mountains not
less than twenty votes whicti 1 nm not
claiming which will be cast for McKinley
on the first ballot. It must be borne in
mind by the critics of my figures that the
New York Tribune, Philadelphia Press
and Chicago Times-Herald bunch in a
great doubtful column from fifty to sev
enty votes.
"The New York Tribune states that of
the 193 votes which they say are either
non-committed or not elected McKinley
will get at least one-half. Upon that very
conservative basis McKinley has a sweep
ing majority of the delegates within reach.
But let us see â during the remainder of
the month there will be elected in:
California IS Idaho 6
Indiana 4 Wyoiniue 6
Michigan 10 ; North Carolina 18
Nevada 6 New York 'I
West Virginia 8,11 tnois 10
Montana tf Maryland 2
Missouri 16 Ohio 4
Delaware 6 Virginia..... a
Colorado 8!
Washington 8| Total 188
"Of this number can anybody point out
to me ten votes that will not be for Mc-
Kinley? It has been fortunate fo>- him
that this large reserve has been available;
but allow that he only has 100 and then
add to that the com mi ted end instructed
vote of the New York Tribune and the
other statisticians and he is way up in the
neighborhood of 550. I have gone into all
this to point out how idle is the sugges
tion that the National Committee ty the
settlement of a few contests, which do not
ag gregate the amount of McKiniey's ma
jority, can turn aside the will of the peo
ple and nominate somebody else."
IO WA DEMOCRATS FOR SILVER
Bimetal lists Win an Exciting Contest in
the Primaries.
DES MOINEB, lowa, May 3.â The con
test in lowa, it would seem, has been prac
tically settled so far as the position of the
majority of the Democrats of the State on
the silver question is concerned. Yester
day's primaries elected 194 delegates to the
State convention, of which 132 were in
structed for free silver. In many of the
conventions held the contest was very bit
ter and the attendance of delegates and
spectators large.
In all the conventions the name of Gov
ernor Boies was received with much en
thusiasm, and he will probably be elected a
delegate at large to tne Chicago conven
tion. The silver men are making a move
to have him selected as ci. airman of the

for the Presidential nomination by the en
tire State if the silver men carry their

Celebration of the Founding
of the Berlin Academy
of Arts.
A BICENTENNIAL EVENT
Tumultuous Enthusiasm at the
Opening of the Industrial
Exhibition.
ENGLAND AND THE TRANSVAAL
The Vossiche Zeitung Says That
Hammond ani His Associates
Ought to Be Executed.
BERLIN, Gebmany, May 3.â The cere
monies which took place at the Berlin
Academy of Arta yesterday upon the occa
sion of the bicentennial celebration of the
founding of that institution possessed ex
ceptional interest from the fact of the
presence of so many art and literary celeb
rities, besides the large number of official
dignitaries. The affair, too, was in marked
contrast, as far as order was concerned, to
the opening of the Industrial Exhibition
on Friday, when, despite all of the efforts
of the police, the carriages of the Minis
ters, state functionaries, Embassadors,
generals and other persons of rank and
title who had been invited to be present
were so mixed up and retarded in their
progress that many guests, including Dr.
yon Boetticher, Vice-President of the
Council of Ministers, and Herr Thielen,
Minister of Public Works, left their vehi
cles and walked through the crowd.
The throng inside the exhibition build
ings, though they were composed of the
better class of Berliners and maintained a
fair degree of order until after the impe
rial party arrived, gave a startling exhibi
tion of boorishness the moment the Em
peror and his party arrived. As soon as
his Majesty entered the crowd they rushed
like an immense nock of sheep to secure
places belli nd the imperial cortege, with
out the slightest resard for the comfort or
convenience of the imperial circle.
The function of the Academy of Arts, on
the other hand, was a stateiy and well
regulated affair, and seemed to please the
Emperor and Empress greatly.
Both of their majesties, after the brief
formal ceremony, conversed freely with
the political and artistic peisonages pres
ent. The Emperor especially sought out
Herr yon Puttkamer; Dr. Miquel, Prus
sian Minister of Finance, and the Italian
and Russian Embassadors, and engaged
each of them in conversation for some
time, while he passed Baron Marschall
yon Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, without even shaking hands with
him. This act on the part of the Em
peror may not have had any particular
meaning, but in view of the present
period of recurrent crisis it looked as
though he had purposely slighted the
Minister, and the act is regarded as con
firming many of the rumors which have
been in circulation of late that the dissen
sions in the Ministry have gone so far as
to involve the Emporor in the differences
alleged to exist.
Apropos of these rumors Baron yon
Berlepsch, Minister of Commerce, who
was reported on Thursday as being about
to resign in consequence of his discontent
at the failure of his measures in the Rajohs
tag, toasted the Emperor at the Exhibi
tion banquet in terms and tone which
could have been employed only by a
thoroughly contented Minister, and at the
same banquet Herr Eugene Wolff, the Ger
man explorer, agreeably disturbed th
placidity of the official oratory by sud
denly calling for cheers for Prince Bia
marck. Most of those present rose to
their feet and cheered lustily, after which
they sang "Deutschland ueber Alles,"and
resumed their seats amid another burst of
cheering.
The Industrial Exhibition opened in a
better state of perfection than was ex
pected, in view of the difficulties which the
managers bad to encounter through the
arbitary attitude of the workingmen and
from other causes. A special view of the
exhibition, arranged for the press through
Dr. Horwitz, the manager of the press de
partment of the exhibition, disclosed the
fact that vast strides had been made
toward getting things into a state of order
within the past week, and the general
opinion is that the exhibition will become
a popular success, and that those who have
seen the great international exhibitions
held in Europe and America can come to
Berlin with the assurance that they will
see something new.
Tne latest advices direct from Pretoria,
the capital of the Boutn African republic,
remove all official apprehension that there
will be war between the Transvaal Repub
lic and England. The feeling here is that
President Kruaer's diplomacy has ren
dered England powerless to trespass upon
the independence of Ihe Boers without
outraging the opinion of the world and
justifying the powers in intervening.
Dr. W. J. Leyds, the Secretary of State
of the Transvaal Republic, who recently
spent some months in Germany, will re
turn to Berlin in July in some new official
capacity, and Germany will soon send an
important diplomat to Pretoria, and this
will certainly be done, too, without asking
the opinion of England.
Tne utterances of the Right Honorable
Joseph Chamberlain, British Secretary of
State for the Colonies, against foreign in
tervention in the Transvaal have made no
impression here and will not in the slight
est degree affect Germauy's action. Tne
revelations which have just been made in
Pretoria, showing the duplicity of the
British officials, may have startled the
German public, but they have not sur
prised the German Government, whose
communications from Pretoria have kept
the German Foreign Office advised ot even
more than President Kruger has as yet
chosen to publisL.
The unanimous voice of the press
strongly condemns Mr. Chamberlain's
want of tact and the clumsy and arrogant
style of his treatment of President Kruger,
whom Prince Bismarck described as the
most astute diplomat he had ever met.
The remission by President Eruger of
the sentence of death pronounced upon
the leaders of the Johannesburg Reform
Committee has only found approval here
as having been dictated by political pru
dence. The National ZeitunÃ in an article
on the subject says: "If the condemned
men had been promptly executed their
fate would have been partly due to Mr.
Chamberlain, whose manner toward the
Boere has forced them to show- that their
rights deserved equal consideration with
those of the English."
The Vosaische Zeitung says: "Neither
Great Britain nor the Chartered Bouth
Africa Company had any right to expect
that the lives of the condemned men
would be spared, and the convicts ought
not to be pardoned. Rather, in view of
the comedy of the trial of Dr. Jameson in
London, the Government at Pretoria
should deal with them severely."
General yon Hahnke, chief of the Em
peror's Military Cabinet, had a conference
with Dr. Kayser, Director of the Colonial
Department of the Foreign Office, on
Thursday, upon a proposal to re-enforce
the troops in German Southwest Africa,
where there are at present only 510 men,
incladiug the officers. After the confer
ence between General yon Hahnke and
Dr. K.ayser, Prince yon Hobenlohe, the
imperial Chancellor, discussed the subject
with the Emperor, and it is understood
that they reached an agreement to send
re-enforcements to German Southwest
Africa at once.
The revolt of the tribes of Khavas and
Herreros is spreading. Advices received
by the Government from Major Luetwein,

The passage by the Reichstag of the
provision of the bourse reform bill, forbid
ding dealings in grain futures, has met
with vehement opposition in the Baden
and Hanse cities. The Berlin Post says
that Prussia and Bavaria will accept the
provision, however, and thus secure a ma
jority in favor of the measure in the
Bundesrath. The general committee of
the Reichstag proposes to adjourn the
session of the Chamber about May 22 until
autumn, but the Government has not yet
decided upon the matter.
Prince George, eldest son of the Duke of
Cumberland, underwent an operation last

Prussian Minister for the Interior, has not

Hon. Edwin F. UhJ, United States Em
bassador to Germany, had an audience

his credentials and their acceptance by the
Emperor were the same as those observed
upon the occasion of the presentation to

Theodore Runyon.
The Emperor and Empress opened the

A DAZZLING EXPOSITION,
Electric Wonders to Be Dis
played at New York's
Great Show.
Power From Niagara Falls â Interest
ing Features in Connection
With the Opening.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 3.â Several
hundred men have been at work night and
day for the last week in making prepara
tions for the opening ceremony of the
National Exposition of Electrical Appli
ances to be held in the Industrial Arts
building beginning to-morrow evening.
The National Exposition is held under the
auspices of the same organization which
made the display at the World's Fair,
and it is incident to the nineteenth an
nual convention of the Electric Light As
sociation. The delegates present will rep
resent nearly 10.000 electric lighting plants
in the United States with an aggregate in
vestment of $750,000,000.
The opening ceremony will take place at
8 o'clock to-morrow evening and will be
attended by Governor Morton and his
staff and a delegation of State officers
from Albany as well as Governors of neigh
boring States, representatives of the Army
and Navy Departments at Washington,
Thomas A. Edison, Professor A. A. An
thony, Dr. Park Benjamin of Newark, P.
B. Delaney, Herbert L. Webb, Alexander
Graham Bell and other distinguished elec
trical magnates.
Governor Morton will be received by
the reception committee at the building
at 8 o'clock and escorted to the platform,
where he will delivers short address.
He will thereupon turn a current of
electricity generated from the falls of Ni
agara over the commercial wire of the
Western Union Company and put in oper
ation the machinery in the exposition
building. This will be the longest trans
mission ever performed by electricity for
power purposes. The only line approach
ing it in length was one established in
Germany, being 110 miles. On this occa
sion the Governor will use the same
golden key with which President Cleve
laud started the wkaels of the great
World's Fair.
Another incident in connection with the
opening will be the discharge of four pieces
of ordnance by Governor Morton over the
telegraph lines of the Postal Telegraph
and Cable Company. Arrangements have
been perfected whereby, with the consent
of the War Department at Washington, a
company of artillery at San Francisco,
New Orleans, Augusta, Me., aDd St. Paul
will plaoe a gun in the public parks which
will be connected by suitable mechanism
with the lines referred to.
As the Governor declares the opposition
duly opened, he will press a button, which
will discharge these pieces of artillery.
A feature of interest in connection with
the exposition will be the sending of a
message of congratulation to her Majesty
Queen Victoria on her birthday, May 24,
the current to be used being generated by
the waters of Niagara River, which are in
ternational.

PAST LOYALTY TO THE BOEKS.

LONDON, Esq., May 3.-The Mail, a
newspaper here, has a dispatch from Pre
toria stating that the Transvaal Gof
ernment has asked each of the
minor members of the Reform Com
mittee who was sentencad to life im
prisonment and banishment, to state his
reason for requesting a reduction of hia
sentence. The four leaders who were sen
tenced to death were not asked for reasons
why their sentences should be commuted.
George Bicker, an American geologist,
has cabled to Secretary of State Olney,
pointing out that when, in December, the
proposal was made to raise a foreign
flag in Johannesburg, John Hays
Hammond, one of the leaders of
tne committee who was sentenced to
death, demanded and obtained from the
members of the reform committee an oath
of allegiance to the Transvaal.
A dispatch to the Mail from Cape Towu
says that J. S. Curtis, a member ol to*
committee, Is very ill near Cape Town and
that ac will probably return to Pretoria
and be tried separately when he recovers.
The dispatches regarding Mr. Curtis,
who is an American mining engineer, are
confusing. It was at first stated that he
was not present when the other prisoners
were sentenced, he having been admitted
to bail on account of sickness.
It was added that his trial would take
place at the next session of the court.
Later it was stated that he and other
Americans had been sentenced to pay a
fine of $10,000; to undergo two years' im
prisonment and then to be banished from
the Transvaal for three years.
The dispatch to the Mail, if considered
with other dispatches, leaves it doubtful
whether he was tried or not.
The Times will to-morrow publish a dis
patch from Pretoria, saying that the exe
cutive is seriously considering how to
avoid the inconvenience to the mining in
dustries entailed by the imprisonment
of mining engineers and others belonging
to the Reform committee. The dispatch
adds that the prisoners are in good health.
The Times correspondent at Palapye
telegraphs that the keenest indignation
was caused among the whites and natives
in the protectorate by the death Â» Jtences
passed upon the leaders of the committee.
The native chiefs on the Transvaal bor
der would welcome a chance of attacking
the Boers. The commuting of the sen
tences has r.ot allayed the resentment.
PRETORIA, South Africa, May 3.â An
improvement has been made in the ar
rangements at the jail where the members
of the reform committee are imprisoned,
and they are now more comfortable and
have little reason to complain of close
quarters. .

THE QUEEN OF SPAIN'S SPEECH
* It Is Expected to Definitely Outline
the Government's Policy Toward
the Island.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 3.â Since
the passage by both bouses of Congress on
April 6 last of the Senate concurrent reso
lutions declaring that a state of war existed
in Cuba and that, in the opinion of Con-
press, the President should recognize the
belligerency of the Cubans and tender his
good offices to Spain to bring about a recog
nition of the independence of the Cuban
republic, no overt action has been taken oy
the United States, so far as is known, un
less the appointment of so prominent a
personage as ex- Governor Fitzhugh Lee as
Consul-General to Havana can be so re
garded.
There is a widely prevailing impression
that General Lee will go to his post of
duty in the double capacity of Consul-
General and special commissioner, em
powered to report directly to the President
as to the exact condition of affairs in
Cuba. This impression has been deep
ened by the protracted conferences which
General Lee held with Secretary Olney
and Mr. Cleveland yesterday. Meanwhile
considerable interest is felt as to the prob
able outcome of tbe matter.
The Queen of Spain's speech, to be de
livered at the opening of the Spanish
Cortes on Monday, May 11, is expected to
outline definitely the Cuban policy of the
Government. It is awaited with consid
erable interest here, especially as informal
assurances are believed to have been given
to the administration that Cuba is to be
tendered almost as great a degree of au
tonomy in purely domestic affairs as the
Dominion of Canada now enjoys in its re
lations with Great Britain.
The reform measures for the civil gov
ernment of Cuba promulgated by the
royal decree of Marcn 15, 1895, which were
not promptly put into operation because,
as it is claimed, the present revolution
prevented the necessary local elections be
ing held to provide the officials named in
the decree, are expected to be enforced
without much further delay, now that
elections for the Cortes have ostensiDly
been held throughout Cubs during the
past month. Supplementary to these laws
liberal legislation by the new Cortes is
also anticipated by those well informed as
to the Spanish programme.
In this connection the statutory progress
of Cuba toward liberal government since
the close of the 10-years' war is to be
shown by an official compilation of the
colonial laws which is now in course of
publication. .This compilation discloses
the fact that in the treaty of El Zanjonn,
which terminated that war in 1878, the in
surgents stipulated only for the freedom
of those slaves who had served in their
ranks.
The law of February 13, 1880, put an end
to slavery in the island, declaring all with
out distinction to be free â minors, how
ever, to remain under "patronage" until
1888, when even that feature was to be
abolished. Two years before that time ex
pired, the negroes were set at liberty by the
decree of October 7. 1886, and the last
vestige of slavery was obliterated.
The Spanish constitution of 1876 was
promulgated in the island April 7, 1881.
All public liberties and the rights of citi
zenship then enjoyed in Spain were thereby
granted to Cuba, involving the radical
change in its political regime that laws
were thenceforth enacted for it by the
representatives of the nation, whereas the
island had previously been governed by
direct orders from the crown. Since that
time Cuba Has been represented in the Na
tional Cortes by its Senators and Repre
sentatives. -
Provision for the enforcement in Cuba
of the penal code of the peninsula was
made by royal decree on Hay 23, 1879; of
the civil code, by decree of July 31, 1889;
of the law concerning civil prosecution, by
decree of September 25, 1885; and by de
cree of October 19, 1888, the law of crimi
nal prosecution was amended so as to re
quire prosecutions to be conducted orally
and in public instead of by written exami
nations in private â an important measure
of reform which had only just been estab
lished in Spain herself.
The Spanish code of commerce was ex
tended to Cuba January 28. 1886, and in
addition io nnrnerous laws of minor im
portance extended to the island the special
banking law was made operative August
16, 1878, and that of landed property May
16," 1879, and as amended July 14, 1893.
Most important, probably, has been the
development of tbe principal political laws
following upon increased liberty guaran
teed by the constitution of 1876.
The law of June 10, 1880, regulating the
right of meeting as proclaimed in article
13 of the constitution was made to em
brace tbe island of Cuba by the royal de
cree of November 1, 1881. This authorized
peaceful meetings to be held exactly as in
Spain, and provided that twenty - four
hours' notice be given to the Governor of
the province concerning the plice, pur
pose and time of meeting. This provision
differs little from the laws and regulations
prevailing in the United States, where
license and permits have to be taken out
from municipal authorities for many pub
lic gatherings.
The Spanish law of June 30, 1887, con
cerning liberty to form partnerships was
made applicable to Cuba by decree of
June 12, 1888, and that of January 7, 1879,
for the freedom of ihe press, was extended
to tfie isiand April 7, 1881. When that
Jaw was amended on more liberal lines in
Spain, June 26. 1883, its additional liber
ties were given to Cuba November 11, 1886.
This statute maintained that the pro
visions of the com r. on law were sufficient
to punish offenses or the press and gave
the ordinary courts full jurisdiction.
The laws of civil marriages, providing
for tbe religious toleration guaranteed by
the eleventh article of the constitution, was
proclaimed November 13, 18& i. Tbe
provincial and municipal organization of
colonies were made to conform with those
of the peninsula June 21, 1878.
Reforms in the right of suffrage have
been difficult of accomplishment wherever
the negro race is in the majority, but the
lav; concerning voters in elections for Cu
ban Representatives in the Cortes, promul
gated December 27, 1892, provides that
every citizen 25 years of age who pays the
sum of $5 to the State shall have the right
to vote, and this right ia enjoyed by ne
groes as well as white persons in Cuba. In
this law are likewise provisions which se
cure the representation of the minority.
The laws relative to education are also
important. As long ago as 1880 autonomy
was granted to the University of Havana,
and such ample provisions were granted
to it that but one university in the penin
sula (that of Madrid) enjoys privileges
equally great. High schools throughout
the island were organized in 1883, and
finally in 1887 freedom of education was
proclaimed to the same extent and man
ner as in Spain. â¢
The Cuban budget, it is shown, has been
reduced from $46,500,000 for the fiscal year
1878-79â the closing of the last warâ to a
little more than $23,000,000 for 1893.
The system of taxation in Cuba and
Spain, it is claimed, could not be made ex
actly alike because direct taxes are repug
nant to Cubans, especially the lax on
land, which is the basis of the Spanish
budget.
The direct tax on rural property in Cuba
is 2 per cent, while in Spain it is from 17
to 20 per cent. As revenue had to be raised
in Cuba the income was sought from cus
toms duties. Notwithstanding this in
years when the greatest financial distress
prevailed the Spanish Government did not
hesitate to sacrifice that income in order
to meet the special need of Cuba's princi
pal agricultural product when the reci
procity treaty was put into effect. Many
Spanish industries had to be sacrificed in
order that Cuban sugar could continue to
find its chief market in the United States.
On the principle of "hearing the other
side' 1 this statement of Spanish reform
legislation in regard to Cuba is submitted
for consideration.
CUBAS BONDS IN DEMAND.
One Bidder Takes All That Are Offered
for Sale.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 3.â Cubans at
the Junta headquarters in New street are
pleased at the information that has leaked
out that all the Cuban bonis lately put on
the market by the revolutionary party
have been asked for by one bidder, who
offers 60 per cent in caÂ»h. A favor
able confirmation of the news came from
Benjamin J. Guerra, the treasurer of the
Cuban delegation and also treasurer of the
bond committee. Mr. Guerra yesterday
said:
" We have an offer from a single bidder
for all the bonds we have on the market,
and his offer is under consideration. We
printed bonds worth $10,000,090, but de
cided to offer only $2,000,000. For the
bonds now on the market we have suffi
cient bids. Thr'se are for all sums, but we
have already one bid for the full amount.
This bid came from a Western man, who
represents a syndicate of capitalists. He
wants all of the $2,000,000, and will pay 60
per cent for them. He i 3 now on his way
to New York to perfect the transaction."
A FIGHT TO A FINISH.
The Question of the Eligibility of Women
Before the Methodist Episcopal
Conference.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 3.â The battle
for women will be fought to a finish in the
Methodist Episcopal General Conference
to-morrow at 10 o'clock, the matter being
the special order for that hour. The oppo
sition to the eligibility of women will be
led by Dr. Buckley of New York, editor of
the Christian Advocate. The o*her mat
ters of the morning session will be the
usual routine business of the conference.
In the afternoon there will be no session,
but the various standing committees will
meet for organization.
The committees on Judiciary, Consti
tution and the other special committees
will choose their own time and places for
organization. The evening will be de
voted to a reception to the fraternal dele
gates from the Methodist Episcopal
church south, and the Methodist Protest
ant church. The question of appointing
negro Bishops promises to be one of the
most interesting of the conference. There
appears to be a desire on the part of tbe
white delegates to evade the question, but
the negro delegates state that they are de
termined on obtaining a definite decision.

another one-sided game to-day. The
crowd was so large that play was almost
impossible at times. The turnstile count
was 17,231, but at least 3000 more were
present, as tbe crowd broke down the
gate to the 50 cent seats after it had been
closed and a great number rushed through
before the police came to the rescue. Hart
was hammered all over the field at times
when hits meant runs. Briggs did the

of the Detroit RaMway jumped the track
in rounding the curve at the corner of
Marquette avenue and Hastings street, at
an early hour this morning, injuring tbe
motorman and conductor and three pas

California Expeditions That May Have

New Town.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 3.â The steamer
Lakme, four weeks out, reached Seattle at
1 o'clock this morning from Cooks Inlet,
after a fine passage both ways. On board
was Will A. Steel, secretary of the Wash
ington Press Association, who reports his
observations as follows:
"The rush this spring to the gold dis
trict of Turnagain Bay, Cooks Inlet, was
unprecedented. Although comparatively
unexplored, numerous creeks on the bay
have given up gold dust and nuggets of
such value as to encourage the hopes of
prospectors, numbering into thousands,
that wealth may be rapidly amassed there.
During the past six weeks a score of ves
sels have headed for far Alaskan shores;
but they all started too early this year, for
an unexceptionally severe winter has left
its impress in huge cakes of ice that have
not yet been blown out to sea and snow
that still remains on the ground to a
depth of several feet. A fleet of vessels is
lying off Coal Point, in Kachekinak Bay,
awaiting a favorable opportunity to go 100
miles farther up the inlet.
"I spent two weeks cruising on the inlet
and from a careful examination of the ex
isting conditions and authenticated re
ports of developments and finds along
numerous creeks, am firmly of the opinion
that the proper kind of men hazard no
chance in casting their lines into the
golden waters tnat flow into the inlet.
Every creek and river shows traces of
fine gold, which increases in coarseness as
tbe streams are ascended, while pieces of
gold-bearing quartz are frequently found
in placers, demonstrating that farther
back toward the mountains are mother
ledges. Auriferous deposits cover a terri
tory of almost unknown extent, while
prospecting thus far has been compara
tively slight.
"It was late in the summer of 1894 that
the first discovery of coarse gold diggings
was made in Resurrection and Six-mile
creeks. In early spring, 1893, a couple of
hundred men were on tbe ground, with
the idea that they had but to reach out
and gather in a golden harvest. Many of
these men wandered around from creek to
creek, without concentrating their efforts
at any particular place. As a consequence
their findings were meager, and by the
middle of the summer possibly 100 had
taken their departure. But there were
many old-time, practical placer miners
who soon realized that they were in a
country of rich promise. They went up
the creeks and back into the hills and
gulcbes prospecting, with remunerative
returns. They found that Six-mile,
Canyon, Ressurrection and other creeks
contained bars bearing coarse gold.
"Before the summer was oyer 150 pros
pectors took up claims, many working
them as late as November 1, realizing from
$10 to $20 per day, and in exceptional
cases, as high as $50 per day. The claims
are 600 by 1500 feet in size, comprising
twenty acres, one claim allowed on each
creek, and the only cost being $2 for
recording.
"At Sitka, Fort Kenal. Kussilof, Coal
Point and other places on tbe inlet I met
and talked with prospectors who have
claims on the creeks and worked ihem late
last year. Several had but recently come
down on snowshoes and were awaiting an
opportunity to get back by boat. All were
positive in the belief that a gold field was
about to be opened up that would bring
forth untold wealth, and in a few years
give the persevering prospector a com
petency for life.
â¢â¢Probably 1000 men are now on the inlet
waiting to get to the creeks. Several hun
dred more went from Sitka to Prince Wil
liam Sound, there to cross a portage
twenty-five miles, half of which is a
glacier, when the head of TurnaÃain Bay
can be reached. Boats will then take
them down stream fifteen miles to Six-
Mile Creek, or twenty-five miles to Resur
rection, twelve miles beyond being the
mouth of the bay. A large number of
stores will be opened at different settle
ments.
"Representatives of the Boston -Alaska
Company, numbering sixty, who left San
Francisco on the steamer Excelsior, have
taken possession of Coal Point, a strip five
miles long, laid out streets and called the
town Homer. Major Homer Pennock is
chief of the expedition and A. E. Guil
bault superintendent. Both are from
Oakland, Cal., as are also most of the
other prominent men.
"A fine quality of lignite coal is found in
inexhaustible quantities in the surrounding
hills. The company will build a railroad
and bunkers from which coal will be
shipped to San Francisco. They have
already built a big floater, 72 by 24 feet, to
hold 140 tons of freight. The steamer
General Canby has been chartered and
will bring supplies and sixteen men from
Seattle. The manager says most of the
party are going to Turnagain Bay to mine
gold, but many think that their hydraulic
machinery is to work gold deposits near
Coal Point. A petition for a postottice at
Homer has been sent to Washington.
"The steamer Lakme carried over 200
passengers and 175 tons of freight. Leav
ing Seattle on April 5, it reached Cooks In
let on the 12th and remained until the
25th. During that time three attempts
were made to get tnrough the ice up to
Tunagain Bay without success. Captain
Anderson exercised due precaution and
refused to imperil the lives of bis passen
gers and the safety of the steamer by
listening to the reckless entreaties of many
of the gold-bunters, who were anxious to
reach their destination. They were
ianoed at Coal Point, 86 tents pitched
and Camp Andersonville established.
Arrangements were made whereby the
steamer Utopia, which was also anchored
off tbe point with 102 passengers, was to
take tbe Lakme passengers to Six-mile
Creek when the ice was cleared.
''Captain John A. O'Brien of the Utopia
was seriously ill for ten days with stom
ach trouble, but Dr. Rogers of Oakland,
who is on the point, successfully per
formed an operation that relieved him.
He is rapidly recuperating. Captain Ches
ter, who went as pilot, was given tempo
rary command of the Utopia.
"The schooner Lincoln, which left Seat
tle with twenty-one passengers on March
7 for Cooks Inlet, had not been sighted up
to April 25. Grave fears are felt that she
has been lost. ThÂ« Hope, a small scuooner
that plies between the villages on Cooks
Inlei, sailed from Kodiak on April 14 for
Coal iPoint with considerable mail for the
Boston-Alaska Company. Tnis distance
is only 100 miles. For twelve days noth
ing was heard of her, and much anxiety
exists in consequence.
"When the Lakme left Coal Point, on
April 25, nothing had been seen of the
steamer Hattie Gage, the bark Theobald,
the barkentine Marion or tne schooner
Sutherland, which vessels left San Fran
cisco on April Ito 5 for the inlet. Neither
had the Lizzie B, Berry, Prescott or Can by
from Seattle been sighted. The Seattle
vessels anchored off the point are the
Utopia and the schooners Bryant, Loyal,
Stella Erland, Helen and Ellen Johnson.
The ship Prussia, with cannery supplies,
anchored off Kussilof on April 19* The
steamer Jennie expected to have her un
loaded by May 1.
"Joseph C. Lane, customs inspector at
Kodiak Island, died at St. Pauls on April
15. He was ill with stomach troubles since
last fall ana for five weeks before his death
could eat nothing. He wasted away al
most to a skeleton. Lane formerly resided
in Oregon."

Flagship Philadelphia Goes Into
Dock to Be Scraped and
Painted.
Burial of Two Navy- Yard Employes
Who Lost Their Lives While
on Duty.
VALLEJO, Cal., May 3.â The flagship
Philadelphia will arrive at the navy-yard
Tuesday, and the following day will be
taken into dock for the customary scrap
ing and painting. The cruiser will prob
ably remain here several weeks, though
but little work *rill be done on it. Ad
miral Beardslee has been designated as
president of the board to go out on the
Oregon's trial trip. It has not yet been
settled whether the Monadnock will go to
Santa Barbara Channel to act as one of the
stakeboats or not.
The monitor is ready for sea. A delight
ful party was held on board Saturday
afternoon, which was largely attended by
officers and their families from the station
and ships. A number of army people
came over from the barracks at Benicia.
Mosic was furnished by the band from the
Independence.
The ever-welcome Fish Commission
steamer Albatross came up to the yard
durine the past week and is lying along
side the quay wall. About the middle of
the coming -^eek the Petrel and Concord
will come to the island and after the vessel
inspection is held it is the intention to put
each of the gunboats out of commission.
Some of the men will be sent East, wniie
others will be retained for the Oregon.
Should money become available the two
little gunboats will be placed in the hands
of the mechanics for a general overhaul
ing, which they are reported to be badly
in need of.
The funeral of Nels Ga'orielson, late
boatswain's mate on the McArthur, who
was drowned off Sausalito Friday last, took
place at the yard yesterday afteinoon, and
to-day the funeral of James Cluskev took
place at the 3'ard. Ciuskey fell down a
hatchway on the Independence, and was
injured ao badly that death ensued shortly
after.
Friends of Miss McCalla regret the in
jury sustained by her while at San Fran
cisco Friday. In attempting to alight
from a car she fell, breaking her ankle iv
two places.
It is not intimated at the yard who the
probable successor of Commandant Howi
son, in command of the yard, will be. His
three years will expire in July coining.
MAR SUE FOR DAMAGES.
Ex-Senator Campbell . Angered by a
Xeu>spajt*r Comment.
VALLEJO, Cal., May 3.â Ex-Senator
George J. Campbell is about to sue City
Trustee John A. Browne because the lat
ter charged him with having obtained
money from the old Lake Chabot Water
Company for services rendered them in
the late city water fight. In an answer by
Campbell in this morning's News to the
charge as published by Browne in the
Chronicle a few days ago, he says he will
try to have Browne make that statement
"not in a n ewspaper article, but where he
will be more careful of his words," leaving
the reader to infer he will prosecute
Browne on a charge of misrepresentation.
Browne charges among other things that
Campbell came trom Ireland, to which
this reply is made:
The man of unpronounceable words wishes
to remind the readers oi his screed that we
were born in Ireland. We confess judgment
without trial and say that we are rather proud
of the fact. Better men than we have been
born, raised and nurtured on the soil of thatâ
to us dearâ but unfortunate island.
We Bre glad that Mr. Browne, in his allusion
to the "howl of the Banshee of your native
land," tries to taunt us by calling us Irish.
We thank a kind providence that such ver
min as he were not spawned on the Green Isle
where the Banshee doth cry for the coming
lost) of a gentle spirit.
Before the controversy is over, as each of
the contestants is hot-headed, there may
be war and without words.

Rapid Growth of Trades
Unions Within a ?ew
Years.
UNITE THEIE STRENGTH
Twenty-Thres Organizations That
Have a Membership of
Thousands.
WORK FOR COMMON JUSTICE.
Have BBttered Themselves and the

LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 2.â After
Seven years of well-directed and intelli
gent effort, the wai:e-workers of Los Ange
les have succeeded in perfecting organiza
tions in their various trades and crafts to
the number of twenty-three. All of these
unions are" represented in a central body,
known as the Los Angeles Count}* Council
of Labor. This central body stands as the
representative of 5400 workingmen.
The great work of building up this or
ganization of toilers in Los Angeles has
been no easy task. On the other hand it
has- been one of difficulty and embarrass
ment. However, those who had by past
experience become acquainted with the
benefits and advantages derived from
unity of effort among working-people were
not daunted by the unfortunate conditions
and circurustanccs it wa3 necessary for
them to overcome in order to attain suc
cess. â¢ â 
The population of Los Angelesâ now
close to 100,000â is a peculiar one. It is
made up of elements which exist in no
other metropolis in the United States. It
is safe to say that 50 per cent of the resi
dents ase possessed oi a sufficiency of the
.goods of this world to place them beyond
want. It is not necessary for them to
.labor for their daily bread. As a rule,
â¢ this class ..has little or no sympathy with
trades unions. This condition of mind is
due to ignorance on their part as to the
aims and objects of the organizations.
Ti ey have a misconception as to why the
toilers in the various lines of labor form
nnions. They believe that a Board of
Trade, a Chamber of Commerce, a Manu
facturers' Association or a Merchants' As
sociation is the proper thins ; but why the
carpenters, the printers, the plumbers, the
cigar-makers, the railroad employes, the
Oricklay-ers or the clerks should form
themselves into unions of their respec
tive crafis they cannot understand, un
less it be to dictate to their employers
as to. how their business shall be run.
When the trades first began to organize
in this city there was quite a number of
residents who looked upon the move
ment with fear. They regarded it as I
anarchistic. They could discern no good
that would result therefrom. But the
-leaders proceeded and continued by circu
lars, public meetings and other methods
to overcome the adverse sentiment which,
aitnough it had no foundation in fact, was
deep set.
That the labor leaders have succeeded
:goes without saying. The principles upon
;which labor unions are founded are as
much respected in this city to-day by the
.great body of the people as is the case in
iany cixy in the country. Tne Council of
.Labor, representing 5400 toilers and 18,000
bf the population of the city, works in
harmony with the Merchants' Association
and the Chamber of Commerce to advance
all movements that are considered to be
for the public good.
The Council of Labor unanimously in
dorsed the Government appropriation for
San Pedro harbor and wired to Senator
White that under no circumstances would
that body approve of the wanton expendi
ture of $3,000,000 of th; people's money to
improve the private harbor of C. P. Hunt
ingtori at Santa Monica. It took equally
as determined a stand against the funding
bill. b
There existed in Los Angeles a few trade
unions prior to 1890, but in that year the
central body, the Council of Labor, was
Jormed. By tne constitution and bylaws
each union was entitled to five delegates
in the-council. At this time it has a mem
bership of 115. They are representative
men from each of the twenty-three tiades
jind vocations that are now "organized and
are soon to be photographed in a body.
The" president of the council is P. Me
. Namara, delegate from the Plumbers'
Union. He makes an excellent presiding
officer and has ever been a stanch friend
of the trades-union principle. He is a con
servative man, who believes in thinking
before acting and as a result his opinions
have great weight among his fellow-work
men. Mr. McNamara is a native of Ire
land, but for twenty-four years he has
been performing the* duties of and main
taining his rights as an American citizen.
H. E. Martens is the financial secretary
of the council and a delegate from the ci
gar-makers. He has been a member of
the union since 1879. [n 1885 he was ap
pointed by the president of the interna
tional union one of a committee of four to
conduct "the first axi>eiiiion of cipar
mafcers from New York to San Francisco,
177 arriving in the latter city January 2,
1885. * Three months later a special train
with 500 Eastern cigar-makers reached the
Golden Gate. The obj'ct of this exodus
was to supplant Chinese -with white labor.
Mr. Martens belonged to the ban Fran
cisco union for a number of years. He Has
always been a prominent and active trades
unionist.
E. R. Holman, the recording secretary
of the council, is a young man 28 years of
age atid a delegate from the Clerks' As
sociation. He is a native of Mississippi.
He has been an active member of the
Clerks' Association since its organization,
and was the representative of that union
in working ud the 6 o'clock closing move
ment, which was carried to a successful
issue with all local merchants. Mr. Hol
man has a thorough understanding of
trades-union crincipleÃ and is a most en
thusiastic advocate of them.
F. B. Colver, the treasurer of the coun
cil, has held that position since its forma
tion. For forty years he has been a mem
ber of the Typographical Union and is
perhaps the oldest member of a trades
union in Southern California. He is pub
lishing a bright little weekly, the Labor
World, which is the organ ot the trades
unions south of the Tebachapi mountains.
The freest union in the city is the Car
penters' Union. It has a membership of
approximately 300 and is affiliated with
the National Brotherhood of Carpenters
and Joiners. It was organized only a
short time ago and the beneficial results
that 'have ensued to the members have
been numerous. Charles Rice is the presi
dent and Joseph Ferris is secretary.
The oldest trades union in the City is
the typographical. It has a members! Ip
of 175. comprising come of the foremost
citizens. As a matter of course, the intro*
duction of machines has interfered some
what with the prosperity of the union, but
it still has quite a cash balance in its
treasury. Mr. Moore is the president of
No. 174. He is 35 years of age and has for
twelve .years past belonged to the organi
zation. This is the second time be has
PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY COUNCIL OF LABOR.
been elected president of the union, hay- !
ing served one term as treasurer and for
three years on the board of directors. He
also served one term as president of the
Council of Labor. W. M. Hawkins is the
corresponding secretary of No. 74, and a
very efficient officer he is.
One of the stanch and growing labor or
ganizations of this City is the Retail Clerks'
Union No. 83, which is affiliated with the
Ketail Clerks' National Protective Asso- j
ciation. No. 83 was organized in 1892 and
now has a membership of which is be
ing constantly increased. The union has ;
accomplished much good for its members.
Stores with but one or two exceptions now
close at 6 p. m. and no Sunday work is re
quired. This desirable condition was ob
tained by the members of No. S3 and as a
result of the assistance given them by the
council. Captain A. If. Green, E. R.
Holman and Colonel Frank E. Beahn
were active in the early and Sunday clos
ing movement and to them credit is due
for the successful issue attained. There
are many social features attached to the
union which have had a tendency to largely
increase its membership.
The president of the Clerks' Association
is Etiwi.rd Booth, a young, active and en
ergetic citizen, who holds a responsible
position with a large retail house. Mr.
Booth is a man quick to act when he is
sure he is right, but he possesses those
elements of conservatism which make him
an able and efficient leader. The first
vice-president is E. R. Holman; second
vice-president, A. B. Cowan; correspond- i
ing secretary, James Travis; financial sec
retary, P. E. Gray; treasurer, Sol Levy;
guardian, A. M, Green; guide, R. A. Ser
rano.
There is not one non-union band in the
city of Los Angeles. This is owing to the
fact that some years back the Los Angeles
Musicial Association No. 19, League of j
Musicians of the United States, was
formed, and that ever since a vigorous |
and active organization has been kept up.
The association has a membership of 200,
which includes every competent resident
musician in the city. The benefits of or
ganization and a uniform scale of prices |
were never more plainly illustrated than
in the case of this association. The board
of directors meet every Wednesday and
discuss matters as well as adjust any
differences that may have arisen. The
secretary is James Green. The union is
steadily increasing in membership.
The Plumbers and Gas Fitters' Union of
Los Angeles includes the workers in this
line in every establishment in the city of
any size or importance. It has a mem
bership of 150 and a scale of wages is main
tained equal to that obtained by the
workers in this line in any city in the
country. One of the delegates from the
Plumbers' Union has the honor of being
tde head officer of the Council of Labor.
James Bailey is secretary.
One of the recently formed organizations
in this city is the United Barbers' Associa
tion, which starts off with a membership
oi over 200, to which accessions are being
received at every meeting. A barbers'
union is bometning new in this vicinity,
but the enthusiastic manner with which
the razor operators have taken hold of the
one that has been formed insures its suc
cess.
The president is Z. Decker, an old-time
resident of California and one of tne fore
most citizens of the county. Mr. Decker
for a number of years held the position of
Public 'Administrator of Los Angeles
County, and he discharged the duties of
that important trust with honor and credit
to himself and the party that elected him.
The other officers are: Vice-president, G.
F. Valiant; recording secretary, Fred J.
Moll Sr. ; financial secretary, 0. C. Hin
ters; treasurer, J. C. W. Razell; sergeant
at-arms, Charles W. Beady. Executive
committee: Charles Hez, C. A. Woerner,
F. H. Bean, J. S. Merrill, L. M. Gray. One
fact in connection with the formation of
the Barbers' Union is very significant
and should be mentioned. It is mat in
almost every instance wherever solicited,
the proprietors of shops have joined. This
has h tendency to make the organization
very strong.
The Plasterers' Union is one of the new
unions of Los Angeles. It has a member
ship of 104, including every plasterer in the
city. Prior to the formation of the union
the plasterers were paid $3 a day in this
vicinity. One Monday morning recently
the union men sent in a request for an in
crease to $4 per day. The contractors re
fused it and the men as a body quit work.
Two hours later the president of the union
was sent for and informed that the request
for an increase was granted. Plasterers
now receive $4 per diem as a result of their
unity of action.
The Painters' Union of Los Angeles is a
strong organization, with a membership
of something over 100. It has been in ex
istence for soveral years and has always
been well officered. The president is J. H.
McWilliams. He has for the past fifteen
years been a member of the union, and is
a stanCh advocate of the principles of
organized labor. He was one of the lead
ers in the nine-hour movement, and is
now as enthusiastic in pushing the eight
hour proposition. Mr. McWilliams is the
permanent president of the Labor Confer
ence which has been formed in this city.
A. H. Hetuerington is the very efficient
secretary of the Painters' Union. The
painters here all work on an established
scale of wages, which is liberal and uni
versally satisfactory.
The local branch of the American Rail
way Union is still maintained in this
City, although its meetings are strictly ex
ecutive, and beyond its officers the out
side world knows but few of its members.
It? roll of membership includes over 150
men. J. L. Rogers is president and H. J.
Quee is secretary.
The bricklayers have a strong organiza
tion here, with a membership of eighty
three. The organization was but recently
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896.
formed, but satisfactory and encouraging
results have already accrued. Before the
union was formed bricklayers were paid
all the way from $3 to $4 50 per day; there
was no uniformity. Now a regular scale
of wages has been established, which is
being maintained without dispute or con
flict. It is $4 per diem. In some instances
contractors pay |4 50, but $4 is the mini
mum, D. C. Gurney is the president of
the union and W. J. Gillis the efficient sec
retary.
Perhaps the strongest labor union in
Los Angeles is that of the Electrical Work
ers. It includes in its roll of members
every man in the city engaged in that line
and there are some seventy-five of them.
The organization was formed some two
years ago. A. McFarlane is president and
P. E. Peters secretary.
The cigar-makers have a union in Los
Angeles, which, next to the Typographi
cal, is a pionrer. It has fifty members
and for years they have all been busy con- I
ducting a vigorous war against Chinese
made cigars. Outside of Chinatown the
union has succeeded in driving them out
of the local market. The uniform scale of
wages maintained is satisfactory and all
employers are in perfect harmony with the
union and its objects. C. W. Stigenwald
is the president and 11. E. Martins is sec
retary.
The bakers have a union which has just
celebrated its first anniversary, when over
125 members were present. The bakers
have been seeing to it that the bakeshops
of the City are conducted on sanitary prin
ciples, and they have also succeeded in
shortening th ir hours of labor. L. Gill is
the corresponding secretary; Peter Aiirtl
is the president.
A strong labor organization is that of the
sbeetiron and cornice workers. The union
has been banded together now for some
thing like a year, and include* every
competent worker in this line in the City.
A living rate of wa?e has been established,
and the members of the union are in per
fect harmony with employers throughout
the City. William Steffen is the corre
sponding secretary.
The Lathers' Union, with a membership
of sixty, includes every lather in the City.
A. A. Peterson is the corresponding sec
retary. This union was only recently
formed.
The Hotel and Restaurant Employes'
Alliance is a union that has been in exist
ence about eight months. It has a mem
bership of 11U and is on ;i firm basis. W.
E. Collins is president and W . E. Warren
secretary.
The Stonecutters' Union is a recently
formed organization with a membership
of sixty. The foremost members of this
union, who were largely instrumental in
its institution, are C. Bly, C. W. Flute and
C. A. Smith.
The Cooks' and Pastry CooKÂ»' Union
has bean waging a vigorous warfare against
the Japanese restaurants in the City, and
has succeeded in driving them out of busi
ness. It has a membership of fifty, and
with the assistance of the Council of Labor
has won a victory. H. O. Wells is presi
dent and C. H. Wobbenhurst correspond
ing secretary.
The Butchers' Association has about
fifty members. It is established on trades'
union lines for benevolent purposes.
Adolph Le Brun is president and \V. J.
Andrews secretary.
At San Pedro is a branch of the Sailors'
Union of the Pacific which has a member
ship of over 100. The union sailors are as
active at San Pedro as they are at any
other port, and their union organization
is of the same character and equally as
strong.
Recently the Buildine Trades Council
has been formed. It is composed of three
delegates from each of the building trades,
every one of which is affiliated with the
council. On the first day of May it has
been voted to put the card system in
operation, and it is believed that this can
be brought about without any clash of
interests.
The Los Angeles Labor Congress is a
new organization which meets monthly.
It comprises five delegates from each labor
union, and its object is to meet and dis
cuss matters of a political nature. The
officers are: J. H. Me Williams, president;
C. E. Fist, vice-president; E. R. Holman,
secretary. The socialists endeavored to
capture the organization at the time offi
cers were elected, but they failed signally,
being out-voted rive to one.
The International Educational Labor
Association is a society comprising some
500 members. A meeting Is held once
each week for the only purpose of discuss
ing live questions of the day affecting the
working people. E. E. Shafer is the secre
tary, and at each meeting a new presiding
officer is chosen by a standing vote.
Los Angeles also has a Labor Exchange
with 350 members, and additions thereto
are constant. It is a grand co-operative
scheme, which is being generally intro
duced throughout the country.
In addition to the workers in the city
in the organizations mentioned there are
6000 members of the Farmers' Alliance in
Los Angeles County.
The work of organization in the city is
continuing. The backmen have secured
200 signatures to a paperand will shortly
organize. The expressmen have 150 sig
natures to their paper and they will form
a union.
The ill feeling that five years ago ex
isted in this city against trades unions has
almost entirely disappeared. This has
been brought about by investigation and
a more thorough understanding of the
principles upon which trades organizations
are based. F. B. Colvkr.

SAN JOSE, Cal., May 3.â Several thou
sand visitors were in the city to-day, and
with the many decorations for the great
carnival of roses which opens on Wednes
day save the place a holiday appearance.
Carnival visitors have begun to arrive and
it is expected that at least 15,000 will be in
this city on the opening day. Those al
ready here were increased to-day by the
Incogs of San Francisco, who picnicked at
Agricultural Park. They brought down
about 2000 excursionists. Aside from a
few fights the outing was a great success.
The carnival decorations are well under
way and will be completed by Tuesday
night. The arch of the carnival near the
narrow-gauge depot is finished and pre
sents an imposing and beautiful appear
ance. The other three arcbes are in course
of construction.
Business houses have begun to orna
ment their fronts, and the streets are
brightened by lines of vari-colored stream
ers and banners and foliage. The trim
ming of the electric tower is progressing
as fast as possible, and by Tuesday it will
be a huge mass of evergreens and red,
white and blue banting. Some idea of
the grandeur and beauty of the decor
ations of the tower, which is over 200 feet
high, may be formed when it is known
that over 1500 yards of red, white and blue
bunting, several hundred flags and several
carloads of evergreens will be used in its
ornamentation.
On Saturday evening the city will be
turned over to King Cole, who will fit
tingly conclude the carnival with a grand
triumphal march of his loyal subjects
through the city. In anticipation of the
coming of the King, the Burgomaster of
the city has issueds ued the following proclama
tion :
PROCLAMATION OF THE BTTBGOMA!Â«TER OF SAN JOSE.
To the citizens of Santa Clara County and
neighboring provinces â Greeting : Rumor has
brought report to hiÂ« royal majesty, oar be
loved sovereign, King Cole, that certain friv
olous, discontented and rebellious persons
dwelling in our midst have been tempting
to sedition his majesty's good and loyal sub
jects of Santa Clara County, and that some
have gone even so far in evil course as to as
sert that they will declare allegiance to a cer
tain beautiful princess of the Uitlander King
dom of Roses and place her upon the royal
throne.
His august majesty has communicated to us
his exceeding royal displeasure thereat, and
has announced his arrival at the gates of our
Garden City at the evening hour of the 9th day
of this present month of May. With his glo
rious majesty will come also his resplendent
court, and in his train will be his great fire
breathing, man-destroying, royal Oriental
dragon, so recently by his" majesty subdued in
valorous single-handed combat amid the wilds
of Port Arthur.
Now, therefore, let it be ordered that all of
the citizens of this and our neighboring prov
inces assemble and straightway repair to the
city's gates, there to testify tbeir loyalty toour
gracious sovereign and evidence their disap
proval of those acts that have so displeased
him; let those that would not incur the
dragon's wrath mask their faces, that they
may escape the blight of its awful gaze; let
frivolity ard mirth prevail to distract his
royal anger; and let the testimony of our
allegiance be pronounced, that we may be re
stored to his royal favor.
Of the hour of assembling ye will hereafter
be advised. Long live the King.
Koch yon Valehtinb, Burgomaster.
In the meantime King Cole has not
been idle, and to-day he\ issued the fol
lowing manifesto to his loyal subjects in
the city :
To our subjects In the principality of Santa
Clara county, greeting: During our temporary
absence in our ditant provinces, where those
faithful servants, Oom Paul and Antonio
Maeeo, so ably direct our affairs of state, and
where our royal presence has been required,
it has come to our royal ears that certain dis
loyal subjects among you residing have been
in revolt, declared allegiance to a princess of
foreign blood and are about to surrender to
her the keys of our loyal city. Now hear ye
what your liege lord doth proclaim:
Upon the ninth day of this fifth month of
the twentieth year of our reign we will come
to your city of San Jose in the evenine of that
day, accompanied by our household and min
isters of state and guarded by our royal Ori
ental dragon. Within your gates we will rest
until the rising of the sun in the morning of
the day following:, and while we tarry we shall
mete out just and fitting punishment to those
among you of haughty and rebellious spirit
and make due reward to those who have re
mained faithful to our royal person.
Let your burgomaster make notice hereof to
all our subjects.
Our hand and seal. Cole Rex.
Given at the Royal Palace.
The idea of the triumphal march of the
King of the Carnival and bis retinue is
that there is an uprising in the kingdom.
His Majesty, with royal alacrity, has dis
patched couriers to all the principalities
of his domain, gathered a vast array of
which he is both general and king, that he
may take possession of this city, which is
one of bis principal cities, and upon which
foreign invaders have covetous designs.
The king and royal family and dignitaries
of the court will head this grotesque
parade, and after them will come the mam
moth Chinese dragon, which proved such
an attraction at the Los Angeles fiesta.
The dragon, which is over 300 feet long,
wili be escorted by 150 Chinese, and from
its mouth will belch forth fire and smoke.
The Arabian Degree Klan No. 4âl1 â 44
will turn out in full force, while over 1000
masked wheelmen will be in line. There
will be hundreds of other special features
in the parade, and it will be one of the
most novel sights ever seen on the coast.

Prove Fatal.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., May 3.â William
Moore of this city, one of the heirs of the
famous Moore estate that is in litigation
in the courts here, waÂ§ this noon thrown
from hi 3 horse while driving cattle and so
badly -injured that he may die.
Moore went out this morning to assist
E. V. Cowell to separate some wild cattle
from the Cowell herd on that ranch some
miles from town, and with the assistance
of a man named Cobert and others had
succeeded in putting several hundred of
the intruders on the run, when a steer
came out of a small gulch at a rapid speed
coliidiug with Moore's horse audkaock
ing the horse down. Moore fell under the
animal. His associate found him uncon
scious, but sustaining no bruises.
He was carried to town and upon the
first examination by Dr. Knight was
thought to be paralyzed, though he after
ward gave signs of fair use of his limbs.
Concussion of the brain proved to be the
real distress and the young man was still
unconscious at 8 o'clock to-night.
SALT LAKE BRIDENE CASE.
Jurors Fail to Agree as to the Guilt of
Martin llayken.
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 3.-Martin
Hayken, agent for the furniture-house of
Andrews & Co., of Chicago, was tried
in the State court here all last
week on the charge of giving
a bribe to ex - County Commissioner
Joseph R. Morris of $5000 for the purpose
of influencing Morris' vote in awarding a
contract to Andrews <fc Co. for furniture
charged at $54,000 for the new city and
county building in this city, and which
was alleged to be worth only $28,000.
The case reached the jury at noon on
Saturday, and this morning the jurors
were discharged, being unable to agree
upon a verdict. Seven of the eight jurors
stood for conviction on what they called
"general principles," while ohe was for
acquittal.
Judge Hines, who presided at the trial,
said from tne bench that the evidence
was not sufficient to warrant a conviction.
There are four other indictments pend
ing against Hayken for alleged bribing of
the other two County Commissioners in
connection with the same deal.

FORT BIDWELL TRAGEDY.
Walter J. Decious Ends His Life
With a Bullet From
a Rifle.
Impelled to the Act by Fear That
He Con d Not Support
His Bride.
CHICO, Cal., May 3.â A dispatch was
received in Chico last night from Fort
Bidwell stating that Walter J. Decions, a
young man of that place, had committed
suicide. Young Decious attended school
and had been living in Modoc County for
several years. He had many friends and
acquaintances here.
The circumstances attending his death
were peculiarly sad. Not qnite two -weeks
ago he married a young lady of eood fam
ily. There had been on his part no dem
onstration either of regret or disappoint
ment, but yesterday the young man bor
rowed a rifle, placed the muzzle directly
over his heart, with the butt against the
wall, be discharged it by pressing upon the
trigeer with a stick.
When found his bands still held the
rifle and stick in a death clasp, settine at
rest all question as to the manner of his
death.
Decious left a letter in which he assigned
as a reason for his act his fear that he
should nor be able to support his wife in a
becoming and fitting manner. It is very
probable that the young man's mind was
temporarily unbalanced when he killed
himself.
THE NEW SHAH ENTHRONED.
Body of His Murdered Father to Be Interred

TEHERAN, Persia, May 3.âMuzafer

city at the earliest possible moment.
The body of the murdered Shah has

Emm Es Sultan, the Grand Vizier, whose
energy has secured order everywhere in
the country.
All the princes and governors of prov
inces have telegraphed their congratula

crime are not allowed to enter Turkey,
and the local newspapers have been for
bidden to mention the affair.

Twisted, swollen, painful, weakening in its effects upon the
vital powers, the direct cause of thousands of cases of general
nervous exhaustion, debility and decay. This is Varicocele in
the veins of the vital parts. It is perhaps the most dangerous of i
the many results of early indiscretions. It drains the vital pow- r
ers in that slow, treacherous manner which leaves no sign of ita >
terrible effect until the awful work is doneâ until the whole
nerve force, the foundation of mental, physical and vital strength,
is undermined and manhood destroyed. Doctors have tried
every known means in their attempts to cure it, and have usually â¢â¢
given it up with the advice that it will not be a serious matter.
But this is only their way of excusing themselves for their help-
lessness. It is a serious matter, as is proven by the thousands of
physical wrecks it has caused. But it can be cured by

ALASKA INDIANS
AGAIN WARLIKE,
Renew Their Demands for
the Life of a White
Murderer.
INSIST UPON JUSTICE.
Fears That They Will Slay a
Prominent Sitka Man
in Revenge.
ON THE VERGE OF TROUBLE.
Settlers Eager for the Reds to Make
a Move That Would Warrant
Their Extermination.
VICTORIA, B. C, May 3.â AccortHag
to Dr. Charles L. Tisdale of Alameda.Cal,
who returned from the North by the
steamer Mexico, a clash between Indians
and whites ~may occur at any hour near
Sitka, Alaska. The trouble grows out of
the killine several months ago of an In
dian by a white man named Mills in a sa
loon row. Alaska is supposed to have &
strict prohibition law, but Dr. Tisdale says
that there are numerous saloons running
quite openly at Sitka and Juneau and the
Jiquor dispensed is vilely adulterated. It
was thought the Indian trouble had blown
over, but of late the redskins have become
more threatening than ever.
Some time ago an Indian killed a white
man. He was tried, found guilty of mur
der and is now under sentence of death.
One evening after this, while some sailors
of the United States steamship Pinto were
drinking in a saloon at Sitka, an Indian
came in drunk and quarrelsome. He in
terfered with the sailors and a row en
sued. It came to an abrupt conclusion
when a civilian named Mills, a man of
immense strength, grabbed the Biwash by
the legs and, swinging him in the air,
dashed his head against a wall. Down
fell the redskin with his skull cracked.
Then somebody dragged him into a room
in the rear of the saloon, where the unfor
tunate creature lay for a couple of days
like a dog without care or attention.
On the third night after the trouble a
man walking along the street stumbled
over a body stretched on the sidewalk. It
was the victim of the fight who, in a
dying condition, had been laid there, pre
sumably to give the appearance of haying
met with an accident. The Indian died
the next morning, and the chief of the
tribe swore out a warrant for Mills, who
was arrested and tried for the murder last
month at Juneau. Dr. Tisdale states that
all the evidence was not brought out and
Mills was acquitted.
This result made the Indians savage
against the white men. The chief of the
tribe spoke bitterly of what he considered
the great injustice at condemning an In
dian to death for murdering a v 'it man,
while a white man could kill an Indian
with impunity. "An eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth" is the Indian method of
evening things np and they swear that
only the blood of a white man will wipe
out the injury.
When the Mexico left there was a bitter
feeling between the whites and Indians.
It was feared that the Indians would carry
out their threats, while the whites were
determined that if any one was murdered
they would wipe out the tribe.
Should strife begin it would be a war of
extermination against the Indians, and the
United States authorities would have their
hands full to restore order.
Dr. Tisdale left for San Francisco last
night. He is a nephew of Hon. David
Tisdale, who has just been made s mem
ber of the Dominion Cabinet, and at bne
time was Government physician at Hawaii
during the reign of King Kalakaua.
Strange to say, Mills has gone back to
Sitka and feels perfectly safe, as he con
siders that it will not be on him that the
Indians will wreak vengeance, bnt rather
on the most important and prominent man
in the district.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., May 3.â The Santa
Cru*; Electrics beat the San Jose baseball
nine at Vue de l'Eau Park here this after
noon ; score 13 to 2.WOULD MAKE A
MAYOR OF PHELAN.
The Junta Leaders Have
Taken "Jimmy" Up to
Boost Him.
HE WOULDN'T REFUSE IT
Fifty Delegates-at-Large Likely
to Be a Feature of the
Junta Plan.
BIG SWARM OF LAW-MAKERS.
Some of the Many Local Democrats
Who Want to Go to the Senate
or Assembly.
The Junta wants to make James D. Phe
lan the Democratic nominee for Mayor
and Mr. Phelan is not opposed to having
that process worked out on him.
If a considerable portion of the local
Democratic party will join with Mr. Phe
lan and the Junta, Mr. Phelan may be
come very prominently mentioned for the
place.
Of course by the "Junta" in such a con
nection as this is meant Gavin McNab, Ed
Lanigan and Chairman Sullivan, along
with the half-dozen smaller political fry
who are standing in with the real powers
in control.
Phelan is a member of the Junta com
mittee and is understood to be in sym
pathy with it. He is the recipieut of much
of Gavin McNab' s admiration and is quite
popular in a distant way in the Junta. M.
C. Hassett is said to have sounded Mr.
Phelan on the possibility of his accepting
a nomination for Mayor and Mr. Phelan
is reliably reported to have avoided any
direct acceptance, but to have said that the
office beam an honor and a duty which no
. citizen should refuse.
Of course the Buckieyites 6niff and guess
. that they will have something to say
about the Democratic nominee for Mayor.
The talk about Mayor Sutro as the
Democratic candidate for Congress iti the
Fifth District slowly increases its volume,
especially among the Junta Democrats.
There is an idea in the air that Sutro
wpuld be satisfactory to the Populists,
and so a strong candidate in a district
where fusion of that sort is possible would
be wise.
This impression, however, will receive j
an early and a general coriection, it is I
likely, in the minds where it now lurks. l
The Populist leaders have no enthusiasm
for Mayor Sutro, and he is not likely to
get any pohticaj recognition from them.
They do not consider him a member of
their party, and say that he has done too
much explaining and apologizing about
how he came to be elected as a Populist
nominee.
Joseph P. Kelly is the only Democrat
who has yet put any ar.ior into a pursuit
of that nomination. Kelly is a favorite
son of the Buckley faction, but Kelly is
reported to be. quietly scheming io piay
things in hia favor with the Junta outfit
as well.
Both the Junta and the Buckley fac- j
tions recognize that Mapu ire's nomination j
in the Fourth is inevitable if he asks for it, '
and both sides are ready to give it to him. j
The Junta sees that tnougn Maguire has'
taken a vigorous stand anainst the regu- â¢
larity of their organization, he is too
strong in the party for them to strike at.
Colonel Sullivan s campaign committee |
wjll meet Monday night to do what Me- i
Nab, Lanigan and Sullivan have decided |
upon. The primary for the selection of ;
delegates to the State Convention wili be ;
held on the 29th inst., and the campaign I
committee has the "regular" nominations, !
tne appointment of election officers, and i
all the election arrangements in its abso- ;
lute power.
Hence opposition tickets will net no'
show. Hence it is that Daggett is
vigorously trying to force McNab and
Sullivan to give him the recognition he â 
wants in the naming of delegates. It is |
said that the victors will generously let
Daggett have a fairly decent show at the !
delegation.
About one-third of the 161 delegates are
to be selected at large. This will take the ,
delegation largely out of low district poli- j
tics and allow it to be made up more i
largely by the intelligent and "decent" I
powers of the. inside. The idea is to com- j
pose the delegation as far as possible of j
the biggefet men that can be got to I
serve, as their names are counted on to j
give the delegation prestige in the contest j
witn the Buckieyites before the State Con
vention. Among the people one hears
are to go as Junta delegates-at-large, if i
they will accept, are James D. Pnelan, j
George T. Marye, Gavin McNab, Clitus *,
Barbour, W. P. Sullivan, M. C. Hassett, j
Jere Lynch, J. J. Dwyer, Max Popper, ;
James Gildea, Thomas F. Barry, ex- :
Judge J. F. Sullivan and others of similar j
high grade.
There are plenty of Democrats who are !
just getting out for all sorts of municipal '
offices, but there are more early candidates i
fo.r the Legislature than for anything else.
Nobody knows how and wnen the divided !
party "will crack together before election j
day, but there is an idea in Democratic â 
minds that a number of Assemblymen [
and maybe three or four Senators will get I
io from Democratic districts in spite of I
the overwnelming Republicanism of this
campaign year. j
Most of the precincts of the good old j
Twenty-eighth District and the Twenty- !
ninth District make up the Seventeenth I
Senatorial District.
John F. McGovern, secretary of the
Junta general committee, is out for this
Senatortihlp. He is a respectable young
groceryman, and though never identified
with the "push," ij very popular with all I
elements and is looked upon as a strong
candidate.
It is currently said that Samuel Brann
hart, the Port vVarden, who runs the
Twenty-ninth for the Junta, is an aspi
rant for the Senatorship. His friends be
lieve that he would be an easy winner if ;
he went after it. but Mr. Braunhart de
clines to say r word about his candidacy.
Jack Welch of the Twenty-eighth wants
it too. The Haves crowd is with him and
Frank P. Cusick will fight him.
Henry Healey, Assemblyman last time,
now tender ot the Fourth-street bridge
through Ed Lanigan, would also like to
make laws in the upper house. Like
others he is .mixed up with all sorts of
factional troubles down there.
John D. Coghlan, ex-Assemblyman and
saloon-keeper, of the Twenty-ninth, is said
to have Lanigan's favor for the place. W.
T. Boyce, Chinese Inspector, is also men
tioned.
Then on the Buckley side are John
Brown, the gentlemanly little hero of the
old Hickory Club who has ex-Supervisor
Ryan and other Buckieyites of the district
to fight and some others, including
Thomas Egan, sometimes known as Robert
Eiumett Egan.
There are two Buckley candidates for tbe
Assembly, fram the Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth, in the field. One is
Lawrence Conlan and the other is James
Meagherof the Recorder's office. "Larry"
Conlan is a vigorous and good-looking
young fellow who has ofteu served his
party ably as inspector and as challenger
at hot primaries and general elections, and
is said to enjoy Chris Buckley's personal
favor.
It is Mr. Conlan who testifies whenever
proper that he saw M. C. Hassett at Buck
ley's ranch about two years ago, looking
for a nomination that might have strayed
down that way.
The Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth, which
compose ooe Senatorial district, is badly
mixed in a factional way. It is thought
that C. S. Arms will either try to go back
to the Senate or name the man who is
nominated. He will be fought by the
anti-Arms people, who are said to have
either ex-Assemb!yman Sydney Hall or
George Dove in view. The Rainey people
would like to see James Britt, who was a
Senator in 1888, get the plum, and J. A.
Fen ton is mentioned.
D. M. Gavigan, the popular secretary of
the Buckley general committee, looms up
early as a strong Senatorial candidate in
the Thirty-ninth District. He is a youne
man, a university graduate, but has had
considerable experience in practical poli
tics. He was secretary of the last munici
pal convention.
William Harrison is thought to be sure
of the Junta nomination for the Assembly
in the Thirty-second. James Devine and
John Powers are said to be his competi
tors.
Thomas Mitchell wants to succeed him
self as Senator from the district composed
of the Thirty-thira 1 and Thirty-fifth.
Peter Quinn wants to go the Assembly
from the Thirty-sixth.
There will be a merry Senatorial scram
ble in the Senatorial District composed of
the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Assembly
districts. Louis Haskins of the Junta side,
a young tea merchant, wants to be
Senator, and he is understood to have
Lanigan's backing. John Fay wants to
go from North Beach again, and Gavin
McNab likes him. John Foley, ex-Super
visor, ex-superintendent of the Alms
house, has been after the nomination for
some time. Fay of course will have the
strong Daggett-Rainey element in the
Forty-fourth to fight. It will be remem
bered that Fay was one of the Senators
who didn't give their complimentary votes
to Daggett for United States Senator and
felt his avenging patronage hand.
LOCAL POPULISTS
Want George D. Gillesple on the
State Executive Committee.
Tbe Populist County Committee held a
meeting Saturday night, at which the sec
retary of the committee. George D. Gil
lespie, was indorsed for election by the
State Central Committee at Sacramento as

of San Francisco to have a representative
upon the State executive committee of the
Peoples' party who is not only true to the
principles of the party, but will also attend
strictly to the business for which he is elected;
and whereas, we know that George D. Gilles
pie is such v man, therefore be it
; Rexolvtd. That the County Committee of the
: People's party in and for the city and county
of San Francisco does indorse the said George
D. Gillespie for member of the State executive
committee of the People's party from the
Fourth Congressional District of California.

COURSING AT INGLESISE.
Opening of the New Park Under
Very Favorable
Auspices.
Reopening of Ocean View Park on
Sunaay Nex; â Result of the
Various Curses.
Several hundred people attended tbe
opening of the Ingleside conrsing park
yesterday and saw a crack class of dogs
run through the run down and first tics.
The management had evidently not pre
pared for a rush of betting, for the pool
box facilities were not of the best and
speculators had frequently to wait half or
three-quarters of an hour before they
could get their tickets cashed.
The hares, owing to a lack of familiarity
witb the park, were not a particulary good
lot, but in the main the talent managed
to guess the right dogs, and but few short
ends won.
The biggest winner of the day was
Eugene Casserly of Ocean View, who
cleaned up $225.
San Joaquin, the Alameda kennels' dog
who was expected to run bign into the
money, was withdrawn on account of an
injury received several days airo, and the
bets on the race with Flashlight were re
paid.
Following is the result of the run-down:
Lady Fitzgerald beat Trix, Governor Mark
ham beat Great Scott, Maunet beat Fireman,
Diana beat Laurelwood, Master Glenkirk beat
Clover Leaf, Magpie beat Era S, Flashlight beat
llene, San Jouquln beat Fear Not, Susie beat
Reliance, fc-t. Lawrence beat Tom Hayes, Eclipse

agement has preserved a tine lot of hares
for tbe meet and a good day's sport is

Dr. 'Goodwin Scores Church Raffle* and
Newspapers -Which Advertise
Lotteries.
Rev. W. R. Goodwin of the California
street Methodist Church spoke last even
ing on "Gambling in the Church and in
the State." He took as his text the ac
count of the soldier casting dice at the
foot of the cross for Christ's raiment. ' .
From tnis scene he drew a comparison
witb the manner in which many churches
encouraee gambling.
"I insist," he said, "that a newspaper
that wiil advertise lotteries and things of
that character is unfit to go into any bouse
where there are children. They have no
right to evade the law of the land by any
subterfuge. They would not do it if the
people would not tolerate it, but the de
cent people still continue to take their
papers and the newspapers make money
on it."
The doctor also took occasion to severely
condemn card-playing, dancing and thea
ter-going by church members.

"SUBTERFUGES OF ROME"
Sinister Motives Are Ascribed

Church.
TRYING TO RULE AMERICA.
Dr. Derrick Explains Why Italy and
Ireland Send Their Paupers
to This Country.
The Good Citizenship meeting at Metro
politan Temple yesterday afternoon was
large and enthusiastic. H. W. Quitzow,
secretary of the executive committee, pre
sided. He opened the exercises with brief
remarks concerning the objects of the
meetings. He also read a dispatch from
Rev. J. Q. A. Henry stating he would be
in the City from May 30 to June 7. This
announcement elicited applause and Mr.
Quitzow stated that arrangements would
be made to have him make several ad
dresses.
After prayer by Father Waugh and one
or two patriotic choruses the speaker of
the afternoon, Dr. George H. Derrick, was
introduced. His subject was "Rome's
Subterfuge." He said in part:
Ladies and Gentlemen: If I were a doctor of
divinity or a doctor of laws instead of a doctor
of medicine I might present my thoughts in a
more acceptable manner. 1 feel entirely inad
equate to awakp.n any feeling in your hearts.
If 1 am able in tbe few facts which I will lay
before you to call to your attention things
which have escaped you I will feel entirely
satisfied. "Not feelings, but thoughts" should
be the motto of this order. In view of the ad
vance of the American Protective Associpiion
principles on thin coast we should have an
audience which could receive tbe remarks
â which I will make not in a spirit of prejudice
and passion, but in a spirit of reasoning.
It has been accused that this organization
is taking every opportunity to kill the old
church simply because it is the old church.
We repudiate everything of this kind. We are
willing to respect it because it in old and
hoary and to give it a decent burial. There
are systems of government and of religion
which have outlived their usefulness because
they have failed to keep pace with the prog
ress of the age, and when the American people
meet such a system it is their custom to give
it a peaceful ending.
I believe in the theory of evolution, though
perhaps not so much as Huxley and Darwin.
I believe there is an inevitable effect that fol
lows every cause. I believe lam here as the
result of a thousand nay a million causes ex
tending away back beyond memory.
If this is true of an individual, how much
more true is it of an institution.
The Roman Catholic church is not the result
of an accident. Neither, I claim, is it the re
sult of divine intervention of Providence. I
think history will prove it is the result alone
of conditions which culminate in the present
religion, with its Pope at Rome and hierarchy
in the United States.
What has brought about this result? Simply
the action of a great law. We may look to the
Walter Morosco. Who Returned Last Night From a Tonr of Europs and the East.
history of Italy and contrast it with that of
England and we can readily see why instsad
of a commercial people sending their ahips to
every port it has such people as seek our lanil
with monkeys and hand-organs. There are
reasons lor this. In our own country you wili !
find that from the day the pilgrim fathers set
foot on Plymouth Rock it baa been the onward
march of on- grand principle.
John \V. Draper said: "Rome never con
sidered man as an individual, bat always as a
thing. Sne might in her power have stooped
to mercy, but never to benevolence."
What a contrast that presents to our own
country. Here the tendency has ever been to
rise to benevolence. When Grant took the
sword from General Lee. instead of, like the
Romans, binding to their chariot wheels,
he extended his hand and said : '-Let us have
peace." That day is without parallel in hu
man history, and the Ameii'.-an people snowed
they had risen to a plane where they could
look upon a vanquished foe as a brother.
When I tnus compare me two principles I
am not hitting at the ola church. I pity it
from the depths of my heart. lam not hitting
at any individual. 1 pity all within the pale
of the church. I pity our friend Yorke. I was
once a student in a Roman Catholic institu
tion and 1 learned some things I have taken to
my heart. I want to tell P. C. Yorke, if he
doesn't know it already, that some day he will
discover that Rome considers a man as a thing I
and not an individual. When he has served
its purpose he will be cast aside as a tiltby gar
menu How many men have been cast down
from the highest ecclesiastical authority sim
ply because he dared to think for himseli? No |
priest in this City to-day dares to think bj- |
yond what is written in the ecclesiastical laws
of his church.
A few da 's ago a gentleman said to me,
"Doctor. I am half inclined to think our re
publican form of Government is only an ex
periment." I thought back to the time when
this country, only a little handful of people,
held in check the proudest Nation of Europe, j
Surely the republican Government was not .
then a failure. Then I thought of the war of i
1812. There was no failure there. So I thought :
along the line of our progress. I said the
world never saw anything like this before.
Why do they call it an experiment? I reviewed
our public schools. I said the man Is mistaken
in considering it an experiment.
If you have men who do know the principles
of republicanism, this will be a very disastrous
experiment, but if you have men at the head
of the Nation who are schooled in the grand
principles of freedom the experiment will
always be a luccess.
There is only one thing that will make our
Government a success, our public schools.
While it may not be flattering to our vanity,
there is a principle in the fact that the young
think earlier than we did. Ido not believe in I
insubordination, but 1 would hate to have a
son who thought he could go no farther tnan I
had thought. Let the teachers bring out the
ideas of our children and we will have new
works in literature, discoveries in science and
men competent in statesmanship.
The first of Rome's subterfuges I wish to
speak of is the parochial school. Send your
boy to a school where he must take off his hat
and bow his head at the sight of some shaven
faced man ? Never. [Applause.] Teach him
to give implicit obedience to an old man across
the sea ? Never. The cause embodied in that
old flat; is the grandest the human mind ever
conceived. Send him where that flag floats
and he will come out ready to think for him
self with an independence that will mtke him
a man among men, instead of a dog among
kings.
I am filled with remorse when I look at these
great cathedrals which I see rising on every
band. I know from experience at the bedside
of the dying that the dollars that paid for these
edifices are wrung through fear from the pov
erty-stricken. I ask you to consider the ad
vance which the Catholic church has made. I
admit it was the greatest system the world has
ever seen. Its all-seeing eye was able to over
look the actions of the princes of tbe world and
could watch the doings of the private citizen.
Christopher Columbus, that man whose mind
was full of scientific learning, waÂ» obliged to
beg at the gate of a monastery. There was the
influence of popery. The Emperor of Germany,
in the right, had to prostrate himself for three
days aud nights before the old man in the
Vatican. Yorke may have to do it yet if he
ever refuses to say the words Rome bids.
In all Europe there was not a man too humble,
too insignificant to receive her notice. He re
ceived his name at her altars, her bells rang
at his marriage, and at her death she received
him and bade him rest In the shadow of her
temple. And while she did all this she prosti
tuted human intellect. She put men in prison
beause they dared to think. I ask you to
point to a single nation to-day under Roman
Catholic rule where there Is a system worthy
of civilization. The brightest example she
can point to to-day is France, and France is
simply a nation of infidels, with the cross
floating over her to hide her infidelity.
When Rome sees that an onward step is being
taken she invariably meets It with a subter
fuge. Now, that she sees our republican sys
tem of government is a success and no longer
an experiment, she meets it with a subterfuge.
That is the reason we s*e flocking to our coun
try the paupers and the outcasts from Italy
arid from Ireland. They come with the idea of
ruling us.
The wail goes up that the A. P. A. is a secret
organization. Do rou know that the Roman
Catholic church ha* been the embodiment of
secrecy for hundreds of years? We take a
member into our order and in twenty minutes
administer all the oaths they will ever have to
take, and they are pretty good ones. If you have
never taken them you ought to do so now.
The Catholic church takes a child in its ten
derest years and Instills in it secrets, which it
is a mortal sin to divulge. The Roman Catho
lic church is simply crying wolf to the
American people as another subterfuge for
hiding its own methods.
I believe there is in the oath of the A. P. A.
the principles that will sustain this Govern
ment. It becomes your duty and my duty to
6ay with the signers of the declaration of in
dependence, "I pledge my life and my sacred
honor" to this measure.
The audience in conclusion eang the
"Battle Hymn of the Republic."
FROM A FOREIGN SHORE
Walter Morosco and His Son
Leslie Are at Home
Again.
Each Has an Interesting Story to Tell
Regarding Scenes in Other
Lands.
Walter Morosco, the well-known the
atrical man, and his son Leslie, the actor,
returned Saturday night to their home in
this City after an absence of five months
spent in an extensive sight-seeing tour of
Europe.
They visited France, Italy, Egypt,
Turkey, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Hol
land, England, Scotland and Ireland, and
Mr. Morosco says they saw pretty much all
there was worth seeing, too, as he and his
son Dave become accustomed to observing
things quickly.
"In Scotland," said he, "J bought ten
Shetland ponies for I took a fancy to the
little fellows, but I left them on my East
ern farm at Guilford, Conn. I also bought
one of the finest bred Collie dogs in exist
ence, a black and white beauty with a
pedigree a yard long.
"Five little puppies were born to her Sat
urday morning in the baggage-car. Alto
gether they made a pretty picture and I
want to exhibit them in the dog show, al
though I am just too late to enter them
proper.'y.
"My great fad, you know, is horses. In
Cairo, *.gypt, we went to a ereat horse
show, it wis a magnificent exhibition.
The best horses were all from Europe.
It's all in the story books this idea that the
Arabian horses are so fine; they were not
in it at all.
"When we were in Ireland we rode in a
jaunting car from Lame to Londonderry.
Well, I got struck on those Irish carts, so
I ordered the finest Irish jaunting car that
could be made. It will be here in a few
weeks. They are so easy for the horses to
pull even with their full load of rive or six
persons.
"Of course we saw the Giant's Causeway
and we never missed the chance to kiss
the Blarney stone. It is really a danger
ous feat, and very few people can do it.
The stone is way up near the roof of
Blarney Castle, seventy-five feet from the
ground, and you have to hang down about
five feet over a parapet.
"We visited all the palaces in Italy, and
wherever we went we collected souvenir
Dhotographs of the best views.
"San Franciscans think the Baldwin
Theater prices are high. They ought to
Jtnow something of English prices. Why,
in London it costs you $1 25 simply to
stand. The English prices are way be
yond anything in this City.
"The thing of the whole trip that made
the greatest impression on my mind was a
very little incident. We wore driving in
Marseilles, when I happened to see a sign
'Chateau d'lf. Steamers Every Hour.'
I determined to see the lonely little island
where Monte Cristo had been confined. It
is a very little island, smaller than Alca
traz, and the prison covers the whole of it.
There, just as I had so often seen it repre
sented on the stage, were the two famous
cells. Over one was the name Edmund
Dantes; over the other right next to it was
Monte Oristo's name. It is all a most dis
mal and horrible place, although it is no
longer used as a prison.''
RAISING THE BLAIRMORE,
Divers Cut Away Her Broken
Fore and Main Topmasts
With Dynamite.
VERY DANGEROUS OPERATION.
After the Load Had Been Pot in
Place It Was Fired by
Electricity.
The work of raising the sunken British
ship Blairmore was fairly begun yester
day. During the early morning hours the
divers were at work, and a number of ex
cursionists on boats from the Union Iron
"Works and adjoining points watched the
operations with absorbing interest.
The dressing of the diver was a revela
tion to all who looked on, and one woman
remarked, "Why, I could dress my baby
as quick again as it takes to dress that
man." When "the man" was down, how
ever, he did what no baby could do. He
discovered that the Blairmore's fore and
main topmasts had been broken off, and
that while they were swaying in the tide
it was almost impossible to work on them.
The diver who went down aft found the
mizzen sound, but the rigging all snarled
up with floating ropes from the other two
masts.
Captain Caw, the master of the Blair
more, was on board the wrecking steamer
Whitelaw when the divers made their re
port. He and Captain Whitelaw held a
consultation and it was finally decided to
cut the tops of the fore and main masts off
with dynamite. A big coil of insulated
wire was procured and for want of a better
drum it was wound around a galvanized
bucket. Two sticks of dynamite were
taken out of the magazine by Captain
Whitelaw and carefully wrapped in can
vas. A cap was placed at one end and
then the dynamite, canvas, cap and in
sulating wire were all packed closely to
gether with cord.
This deadly combination, that was pow
erful enough to wreck the Whitelaw and
half a dozen other ships, was calmly taken
in hand by a diver and carried into the
depths of the bay.
With it in hand he walked to the fore
mast of the sunken ship and just below
the break he bound tbe canvas containing
the dynamite. Then without any undue
haste he meandered back to the ladder
hanging over the stern of the Whitelaw
and reported progress.
Two other divers were down at the time
and they were signaled to. They came to
the surface and their helmets were taken
off. A few minutes later the signal was
given that all was ready and Captain
Whitelaw touched tne electric button.
An upheaval of the waters of the bay fol
lowed, the Whitelaw shook like an aspen
leaf and one of the divers was almost
thrown from tbe ladder. When an exami
nation was made a quarter of an hour
later the diver found that the broken fore
topmast had been cut off as clean as with
a chisel.
The mainmast was treated in a similar
manner and during the afternoon tide the
work of removing the standing rigging
was begun. This will occupy several days
and then the yards will be taken off and
sent aloft.
Once these are removed the -task will be
easy, as far as removing the masts is con
cerned. Then the really hard work will
befiin. The vessel has to be put on even
iccel and raised. This can only be done
by great skill and experience and that
Captain Whitelaw jjosÂ»esses. After get
ting the Blairmore on an even keel a set
of pontoons will be placed in position and
these will be fastened to the hull of the
sunken ship at low water. The rising of
the tide will do the rest and once the
hatches are above water it will not take
Jong to puniu her out.
Captain Whitelaw, who has the worr in
charge, Captain Burns, who is directing
the operations for the English under
writers, and Captain Caw, the master of the
sunken ship, are all confident that the
Blairmore will be afloat again inside thirty
days.
ALONG THE FRONT.
Arrival of the Gunboat Concord
With Paymaster Webster
Aboard.
The United States gunboat Concord
arrived froii. Honolulu yesterday. She
took twelve days to make the run and thus
was easily beaten by the despised Petrel,
which covered the distance in nine days.
The officers of the gunboat are:
J. K. Craig, commander; Lieutenant E.
M. Prime, executive officer; Lieutenant J.
A. Me:riman, navigating officer; G. W.
Seivers, chief engineer; W. A. McClung,
surgeon; E. P. Webster, paymaster;
Lieutenants W. S. Hogg, W. A. Gill. E.
Simpson, Ensign H. G. McFarland, Pay
Clerk W. A. Strute and crew of 158 men.
The gnnboat has six 6-inch guns, two
3-pouuders, two 6-pounders, two 37-mm.
guns and two Gatling guns.
Paymaster Webster, as told in The Call,
is in trouble. The executors of the estate
of the late Catherine Tobin are after him for
$2000 he is alleged to have extorted from
her sou. The paymaster most vigorously
denies the charge, however, and says that
when the case is tried he will come out
with a clear record.
The steamer Colon of the Pacific Mail
line got in from Panama and way ports
yesterday. Her cabin passengers were:
Frank Dwyan, Joseph Dalton, A. Hunan and
family. Dr. M. Masfcroll and family, E. A. Rai

THE LORD AN ORGANIZER.
Elder Tanner of the Mormon Mission
Delivers an Interesting Lecture.
President Henry S. Tanner of the Cali
fornia Jloimon Mission lectured in Pythian
Castle yesterday evening. His subject was,
"The Lord as an Organizer." He said:
"To organize is to systematize disar
ranged parts in a suitable manner for ob
taining desired results."
He quoted from the book of Abraham,
which contains the writings of Abraham
that were exhumed from the catacombs of
Egypt in the early part of the century to
prove that the Lord organized the intelli
gences that existed before the world was,
and that Abraham was one of those spirits,
and that it was from the faithful ones
there that he made selections for his rul
ers in this earth.
"It seems," said Elder Tanner, "that
two plans were placed before the Lord,
but one was rejected. The originator of
the rejected plan became angry and re
belled against God and lost nis tirst estate,
though he had great intluence and drew
away one-third of the hosts of heaven.
Jude says: 'The angels whicn kept not
their first estates are reserved in chains
unto the judgment of the great day.' Be
cause of the selection from tbe faithful in
telligences in the spirit world, 'the gifts
and callings of God are without repent
ance,' as Christ was foreordained before
the foundation of the world and made
manifest in the meridian of time.
"System continued in the earthly crea
tions. All the species of God's creations
were to increase and replenish the earth,
and singularly as it may seem, they have
maintained their identity. The sterility
of specie? and hybrids on the one hand,
and the fertility of varieties, descendants
from a common stock on the other, prove
a conformity to the great law of nature as
made known in the Bible, that every seed,
fish, foul, creeping thing, beast of man,
shall bring forth after his kind.
"After the bondage of Israel the Lord
gave unto them consistent laws to meet
their special requirements. The same
unanimity is manifest in the labors of
Christ and his apostles for the bettermert
of humanity. Order prevailed in the
organization effected for the edifying of
the body of Christ. Accounts of that
organization will be found in I Cor. xii and
Eph. ii and iv.
"That same oneness of purpose ever
manifest in the Lord's work is brought
into prominence in the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints. Under the
presidency and aoostles the whole of Mor
mondom works as a unit. Being divided
into stakes and subdivided into wards,
which are under the direction of the bish
opric with a perfect network of priests,
teachers and deacons, they are enabled to
reach every family and individual under
their jurisdiction. The president has reve
lation for the benefit of the whole, and
each individual is supposed to have a suf
ficient light to enable nim to defend every
principle or practice they have espoused
and stand individually upon their own re
sponsibility."
OLYMPIC CYCLERS' RACE
Their Five-Mile Event Won by
Ralph Blivenâ Rodolph's
Best Time.
Harry Terrill Fined by Referee Plum
mer at the Santa Rosa Races
Saturday.
The Olympic Cyclers held their initial
five-mile handicap roadrace yesterday at
noon over the San Mateo-San Carlos
course, and a large number of the Olym
pic Club members rode down to witness
the finish.
Of the thirty-four original entrants,
twenty-two started, all of whom finished.
There were the usual number of falls and
accidents to wheels incident to all road
races, but nothing serious happened to
mar the sport.
Ralph Bliven won the race with forty
seconds handicap; Frank Rodolph, thirty
seconds, second; and Russell Eaton, fifty
seconds, third. Rodolph also made the
fastest time of any one in the race, cover
ing the course in a few seconds over four
teen minutes. The road was not particu
larly good or faster time would have been
made by many of the riders.
Joseph F. Coffey, president of the Cy
clers, acted as referee and James W. Cof
froth was the starter. The committee
which conducted the race was composed
of Charles F. Morel, James W. Coffrotb.
and D. L. Conklin.
After the race tbe ridere and members
assembled at the residence of President
Eaton of the Olympic Club in San Mateo
and enjoyed lunch and talked ver the
race. They were delighted with the suc
cess of their first attempt at road racing
and loud in their praises of the cordial re
ception tendered them by President Eaton.
A large number of the local racing men
and many of the Easterners now here, in
cluding the big Steams team of ten men,
were at Central Park yesterday afternoon
trying the new cycle track there. They
seemed well satisfied with it, and the
probabilities are the big National circuit
race meet, to be held there on May 16, will
witness some of tbe fastest and most ex
citing racing ever seen here.
Harry F. Terrill, ihe well-known racer,
was fined $20 at the Santa Rosa races Sat
urday by Referee Plummer for an uncom
plimentary remark he passed about a de
cision made by the referee.
This is the first time on record that a
rider has been fined, a power given the
referee by the new league racing rules, and
if Saturday's occurrence is any criterion
the men will have to live up to the letter
of the rules or suffer severe discipline.
Both Plummer and Terrill belong to the
same club, the Bay City Wheelmen, and
the matter has occasioned considerable
talk among their club mates, who seem
divided in their opinion as to the justice
and extent of the punishment. Terrill
will have to pay the fine or be ruled off the
track until he does.
Next Saturday the racing contingent
will attend the meet of the Garden City
Cyclers at San Jose, it will be a star event
in cycle racing on this coast, owing to the
hieh class of the riders who will compete,
the value of the prizes and the fact that
the meet will be he!<i on the last day of
the rose carnival there.
The ear of the Caucasian race is of
modern size, well formed and neither
closely adherent to the head nor project
ing.

DAVID BL FOLTZ, Special Aeent
MONDAY ..MAY 4, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Now for" the convection.
Loyal Republicans to the front.
jTree silver coinage is the pledge.
The delegation to St. Louis must be
strong. Â»___
There is much more in politics than a
whoop-up.
Principles and not men constitute the
issue before ns.
California Republicans must again speak
up for woman's suffrage.
California expects her Republican citi
cens to defend her interests.
Â«
It will be something like a festival for
Sacramento, but she is used to it.
The people expect a platform of thoughts
that breathe and worus that burn.
It is -said that Cleveland is aging
rapidly, and alas ! so is the country.
The financial plank of the platform
should ring with a true silver sound.
No political party ever wisely seized an
opportunity by making a leap for it in the
dark.
. This time there will be a protest against
the refunding scheme that will mean some
thing. _
Straight politics is never the policy of
the bosses, but all the same it is the boss
policy.
The last step of Democracy took it
through the slaughter-house and the next
one will reach the grave.
With loyalty to all and antagonism to
none should be the California motto at
the National Convention.
In serving the interest of California we
â  are serving the welfare of the Nation in
the way we can do it best.
â  If we. have a pledge-bound delegation,
how can it be strong ? If we have a strong
delegation, why should it be pledged?
If we may judge by the signs in the
Populist camp, every able-bodied man
among them intends to run for President.
California should put no man on guard
at St. Louis who cannot be counted on to
faithfully guard every interest of the
greater West.
It should be remembered that an un
instructed delegation can back the favorite
as easily as the field if it should be thought
best when the race begins.
This is going to be more like a proces
sion toward prosperity under a Republi
can standard than a political contest be
tween well-matched parties.
. The main interest in the campaign will
be the curiosity to see how near the Popu
lists will come to turning the Democrats
out of their place as the second party in
the country.
The goldbug Democrats of the East have
been wildly excited by a report that the
Populists have laid plans to capture the
Chicago Convention and carry it off on the
Omaha platform.
Thongh several Democratic State con
ventions have been held this season, we
have not heard the welkin ring a single
time with shouts for free trade and the
world's commerce.
Members of the Republican State Con
vention are not likely to seat a bogus dele
gation that would commit the party to a
recognition of Martin Kelly as a boss of
the Fourth District.
Whitney's assertion that he would
rather be called Bill Whitney than Presi
dent Whitney sounds a good deal like he
had made up his mind to get in the ring
and be one of the boys.
The State delegation to the National
Conver*tion should be made up of men
whose political record is a guarantee of
fidelity to California's welfare more cer
tain than any pledge could be.
The next thing we know Cleveland may
imitate the action of Osman Digna and
try to make a holy war of the coming
campaign in order to cover the holy show
his party has been making of itself.
Protection and reciprocity as embodied
in the immortal policy of Blame are
among the most precious heritages of the
Republican party and will never be aban
doned. On tbe other hand the great prin
ciple of bimetallism has been bitterly as
sailed and it is that which we mast guard
now.
Having determined to enter the race as
a Democratic candidate for the Presi
dency, William R. Morrison has submit
ted to an interview on the money ques
tion, in which he says in one place the
adoption of 16 to 1 silver coinage will
drive cold out of the country. In another
he declares "gold alone is now a too nar
row and insufflcieut money basis." It will
be seen that the gifted Horizontal Bill
proposes to stand at Chicago as the boss
straddlebugger.
"SIXTEEN TO ONE."
It is becoming more apparent every day
that the Republicans of California will be
sorely grieved and disappointed if the
State Convention fails to declare emphati
cally and unequivocally for the remoneti
zation of silver at 16 to 1. And it may be
said that the Republicans in California are
thoroughly convinced that the delegates
to the St. Louis Convention should go an
trammeled by pledges to support any par
ticular candidate, that they may be en
tirely free to make a strong and deter
mined fight for a declaration in the plat
form for the coinage of silver, and for a
man who will fit the platform. These
things are paramount, for their accom
plishment wouid mean the revival of all
lines of business in California almost im
mediately.
California is thoroughly loyal to the
Republican party and in asking for a
pledge that the mints sliall be reopened to
silver she is only asking for the practical
application of Republican principles in
the conduct of the Nation's affairs.
Whatever may be said to the contrary,
the fact remains that there is not nearly a
large enough volume of metallic money,
and because of the insufficiency California's
prosperity is seriously hindered.
The question of the expediency, of the
economic aspect and of the conseauence of
remonetizing silver is too well understood
by the Republicans of California to need
any analysis. The people know by exper
ience that the free and unlimited coinage
of silver and gold is of vital importance to
every interest in this State; besides, the
silver mining industry of the entire West
has been crippled too long already by
denying to silver its legitimate place in the
monetary system of the country. This
is not sectionalism, but it is a demand for
the adoption of a sound and sensible finan
cial policy by the St. Louis Convention.
The principle of economics that makes
cold money has in the past and can again
confer the same office upon silver, and
California wants the delegates from this
State to the St. Louis Convention to see to
it that whoever is nominated is nominated
under pledges to open the mints to silver
and to gold without any discrimination
whatever for or against either metal.
Gold makes good enough money for
California, but there is not enougn of it.
Silver makes good enough money for Cali
fornia, and there is enough of it. when
added to gold coinage, to give the State
and the whole country an ample volume
of metallic money to meet the require
ments of the people. \
The attention of the delegates to the
State Convention need not be called to the
tremendous losses that the demonetiza
tion of silver has obliged California to
sustain, for they know all about that, and
not a few of them to thsir sorrow on per
sonal account. Nor is it at all necessary
to show how the conspirators managed to
murder silver in 1873, and how by reason
thereof there has been only depreciation
of values and business distress all over the
country, for they know all about that, too.
But the attention of delegates to the
State Convention is called to the fact that
public sentiment in California demands
tnat they instruct the delegation that will
go to St. Louis to go loaded for bear, so to
speak, and tnat they be bound by no in
structions other than to watch and work
and pray for California's best interests.
GU ARD CALIFORNIA.
The nnwonted enthusiasm displayed by
the Republicans of California is evidence
of party loyalty, a sincere belief in the
great principles which the party supports,
and confidence in victory next November.
With such a feeling as this, and with dis
organization and discontent in the Deu. >
cratic ranks, California is bound to show a
Republican majority.
The great problem now confronting the
Republicans of California is to make the
most intelligent use of the situation. The
fact must not Be overlooked that this State
occupies a unique position, and that its
duties, needs and opportunities ate wholly
different from those of otber States. As
the ruling party in California the Repub
licans have grave responsibilities, reaching
far beyond the bald consideration of party
victory. These responsibilities affect in
terests vital to every citizen of the State
without regard to party affiliation. They
go even further than that. Apart from
the interests affecting all Californians
alike is the position which the State occu
pies toward the welfare of the whole Na
tion. If the Republicans of California
fail to understand these matters and
merely put themselves on the common
place level of Eastern sentiment, they will
neglect the first grand opportunity ever
presented to them whereby they might
compel the National party to recognize
the needs of the State and accede to its de
mands.
If California does not exercise the power
to make an effective demand for the Nica
ragua canal, from what spurce should
such a demand proceed? From Missouri
or Illinois or New York? If California
doe 3 not come to the rescue of the com
merce of the Unitea Btates and demand
such asfistance for the steamers plying be
tween San Francisco and the Aus
tralian and other colonies as will
enable this country to compete with
the heavily subsidized lines controlled
by Great Britain, and if the farmers
of California do not require that Ban
Francisco instead of Liverpool should
be the distributing point for their products
destined for the Orient, from what other
source should such a demand come? If
the fruit-growers of California, having no
competitors in the United States, do not
insist on such a protective tariff as will
insure their prosperity and such a reci
procity as will extend their markets,
whom should they expect to make their
light? If the English laws standing in
the way of irrigation of our arid lands are
not to be overturned by us in favor of laws
suited to oar circumstances and needs,
who will do this needful work for us?
It would be idle to aay that these mat
ters are so manifest that they will im
press themselves adequately on the atten
tion of the National party, and equally
idle to insist that in the absence of intelli
gent work to secure their recognition they
will receive due consideration. Should
the Republican delegates from California
to the National Convention go unpledged
to any candidate for President and with a
harmonious aDd earnest purpose to exer
cise the power which independence gives
to demand the recognition of our needs as
a prerequisite of support, it will be pursu
ing the only course by which it is possible
to discharge a high obligation to Califor
nia and the Nation. A delegation pledged
to any candidate whatsoever would be a
mere football and the supreme opportu
nity would be lost.
BENEFITS OF REOIPROCITY.
Even if the Republican party had noth
ing more to its credit than the doctrine of
reciprocity it would become immortal in
American history. To the farmer particu
larly it is equally as vital as a protective
tariff. Take the simple item of flour. It
stands on record that since the abrogation
of the reciprocity treaty with Cuba and
other Spanish-American countries we have
lost the greater part of our export trade to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896.
those countries. Under that treaty we
were exporting annually 3,250,000 barrels
of flour, equal to 15,000,000 bushels of
wheat, and since the passage of tne Wil
son bill nine-tenths of this trade has been
lost. It is not difficult to discover one of
the main reasons why the price of wheat
has declined to a point at which it cannot
be profitably produced in California.
It is the duty of the California Repub
licans in the State Convention to demand
such a reciprocity at the hands of the Na
tional Convention as will enable all kinds
of farmers in California to enjoy the bene
fits of the superb advantages with which
nature has endowed them. This demand
can be made effectively in only one way,
and that is to send unpledged delegates to
St. Louis with instructions to support such
a platform ana such a candidate for Presi
dent as will insure reciprocity in the in
terest of California farmers.
MARTIN KELLY.
Martin Kelly, the political outcast and
renegade; Martin Kelly, who openly con
spired with Buckley and Rainey to defeat
Morris M. Estee for Governor of Califor
nia and shamelessly boasted of his ex
ploit; Martin Kelly, who was driven out
of the Republican party for his duplicity,
and whose name is associated with every
disreputable transaction connected with
bos 3 politics in San Francisco, now aspires
to regain the power which he so openly
abused and to plunge the Republican
party in California into the disgrace
which it is now making so strenuous an
effort to avert.
Republicans of California, this is the
man who will go before you at Sacramento
and, by assuming to advocate the interests
of McKinley and protection, seek to bam
boozle the country delegates and make
them the tools for placing the party ma
chinery in his hands. This is the man
who will buttonhole and wheedle all the
delegates who may deign to listen, and by
trading on McKinley's popularity in the
interior make a desperate effort to fasten
his influence on the party. His preten
sions of regard for McKinley and protec
tion are a sham of the baldest order.
Adhesion to any principle except one
which will give him power to manipulate
and debauch the party is impossible with
him. This is a warning to the country
delegatesâ the Republicans of the bay
region are familiar with his career, his
character and his purposes. It is time for
the Republicans of California, once and
for all, to make Martin Kelly stand aside
and no longer impede the onward march
of the party or bring disgrace upon the
fair name of California.
WOMAN SUFERAGE.
Strictly speaking:, woman suffrage is not
a mere question of the political equality of
man and woman, but of right and justice.
The spirit of the question is whether a
class of citizens in name, who, in intelli
gence, comprehension of the principles of
the government and loyalty to the best in
terests of the country, are fully on a parity
with other members of the commonwealth,
shall be enfranchised that they may par
ticipate in the work of weaving broader
and better threads in and through the
political and economic fa brie of the Nation.
The opposition to the conferring full
citizenship upon woman is not based other
than upon foolish sentiment and blind
prejudice. It would be a strange and un
natural innovation, they say, which is
partially true, for the strength of national
and individual progress comes of profiting
to-day by the experience of yesterday by
innovation. Sufficient unto the day is the
blindness and stupidity thereof. If it be
politically wrong and socially unhealthy
to make innovations then men folk shonld
never have departed from the fashion of
old Father Grimes and continue to "button
up his coat all down before."
There is another class of objectors who
say it would be very inconsistent to make
such a departure from time-honored cus-
Toms as the enfranchisement of woman
would oblige. To Buch we say, with Em
erson, that "A foolish consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little
statesmen and philosophers and divines";
and with Lowell, that "The foolish and
the dead never change their opinions."
There is still another class of objectors
to woman suffrage who concentrate the
whole of their argument in one sentenceâ
"I have only contempt for the move
ment." To such we say, with Stopford
Brooke: "Contempt sees nothing, apd,
seeing nothing, has no material for
thought"; and with an old Bpanisu
proverb: "A handful of common-sense is
worth a bushel of learning."
If objectors to conferring full citizenship
upon woman would quit the embrace of
foolish consistency and feed their con
tempt on common-sense they would come
to see that woman is now an independent
wage-earner in every line of literature and
of the professions and in all the channels
of commerce; that she accumulates prop
erty in her own right, and that she keeps
even with man in every field of employ
ment in which they are corapstitors.
Therefore, can, could or would anything
but big chunks of the remnants of the
stupid and blind prejudice of 100 years ago
attempt to obstruct her way to the enjoy
ment of the same political freedom and
advantages that man enjoys? The Call
thinks not.
OUR OWN INTERESTS.
The Call is Republican in season and
ont of season and stands up for silver.
The Call is the champion at all times of
Pacific Coast interests and Pacific Coast
men. Let the Republican party of Cali
fornia through its representatives at St.
Louis demand and it will receive recogni
tion. Let us not throw away our strength.
Let as make the most of our opportnnity.
Let us send to tbe National Republican
Convention delegates with full power to
speak, demand and act for California.
As a State we are interested in measures,
not men; in advancing California to a
piace of power in the Union, not in tbe
political fortunes of any "favorite son."
SAN FRANCISCO'S FUTURE.
The principal reason why San Francisco
is not to the Pacibc Coast country of
North and South America and to the Ori
ent what New York is to the Atlantic
Coast region and to Europe is because San
Francisco has not the necessary water
transportation facilities to make trade in
terchanges. If San Francisco had a mer
chant marine there would be no question
about her crowding New York in popula
tion, in wealth and in volume of business
in the near future, and in this connection
let us say that next to winning in the bat
tle for the "dollars of our daddies" our
delegates to the St. Louis Convention
should return with satisfying assurance
that the next administration, which will
be Republican, of course, will warmly
favor encouraging ocean freight-carriers,
and push the Nicaragua canal project.
The importance to San Francisco, to
California and to the entire Pacific Coast
country of having adequate water craft
facilities to meet the trade requirements
of the countries naturally tributary to this
center of commerce and industry is so
great that every Californian should make
it his business to talfc about it in season
and out of season. It is a matter we
should enthuse over. A ringing speech or
two on tbe subject in the St. Louis Con
vention hall might do good in the direc
tion of acquainting the people of the
United States that there are a few things
California needs ana must have.
CALIFORNIA'S ARID LANDS.
It is not sufficient for California's needs
that private capital is willing to establish
irrigation works here and there. These
enterprises, however commendable, are
not only limited in extent, buc are able to
charge their own prices for water and are
quite different from irrigation plants
growing out of the co-operation of land
owners enjoying the use of the water at
cost. Of course, no one will question the
need of irrigation in California or attempt
to decry the great additional value which
it gives to the soiL We have had a bitter
experience with our endeavors to make
laws providing for this need. Our Federal
courts, raking the English common law
as their basis in the absence of American
National laws framed to meet necessities
peculiar to California and foreign to Eng
land, have assailed our State laws, threat
ened the validity of our irrigation bonds,
destroyed the confidence of capitalists in
their value and set back the State's prog
ress to primitive times. We cannot have
irrigation without Congressional support,
and without irrigation it will be impossi
ble to develop the State to its full capacity.
If the Republicans of California send a
delegation to the Bt. Louis Convention
pledged to some Presidential candidate
there will be no reason to hope that the
National Convention will make the irriga
tion of arid lands a policy of the party.
Even a resolution by the Siate Convention
could not be expected to carry weight.
The only way to secure the desired end is
to send unpledged delegates to the Na
tional Convention. Such delegates will be
in a position to demand that the candidate
receiving their support must be pledged to
advance the cause of irrigation in the
West.
PROTEOTION FOR CALIFORNIA.
If there is a single farmer in California
who has not suffered under Democratic
free trade and whose condition could not
be greatly improved by a protective tariff
he is a singular departure from the aver
age. The raisin-growers of Fresno are
aware how their industry has been virtu
ally destroyed by the Democratic reduc
tion of their protection, and the fact that
in consequence they have been compelled
to compete with the pauper-labor pro
ducers of Spain. Our olive-growers are
well aware of the long years that must
elapse before their trees come into prolific
bearing; that during all these years, and,
when the trees come into bearing, they
must pay $1 50 to $2 50 a day for labor,
against the 40 to 70 cents a day paid in
Spain and Italy; that America is import
ing 1,000,000 gallons of oil a year, to say
nothing of olives; that California is the
only State producing these articles and
that they are far superior to those which
we import, and that great results would
flow from high protection. Grain-growers,
lumbermen, wool-producers, wine-makers
and all others have a deep interest in a
protective tariff that will enable Califor
nians to enjoy the benefits to which their
unique position entitles them.
Unless California sends an unpledged
delegation to the National Convention it
would be folly to hope that the special
needs of this remote and ill-understood
State would receive proper consideration.
An unpledged delegation, caring more for
the interests of California than for any
Presidential candidate's political ambition,
would be in a perfet condition to demand
recognition as a condition of support.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Marlposa Miner (Coulterville) comes out
in strong advocacy of Senator Perkins' bill
granting a right of way through the Mariposa
forest reservation for the Yosemite and Merced
Railroad. The bill provides for a right of way
200 feet wide, and for the privilege of catting
such timber as may be required in the construc
tion of the road. Says our exchange:
Over much of the country through which the
railroad will pass 200 feet In width Is by no means
too much for a right of way if tbe track Is to be
kept clear at all seasons of the year. Furthermore,
by rescuing as much as possible from the reserva
tion it brings so much the more taxable property
Into the county. Since Marlposa was ruthlessly
and Inlquitously despoiled by the Park reservation
the aim of the majority of the residents has been
to set some of it back, or at any rate to get some
good out of it. Here is a chance. An enterprise of
great value is about starting npâ an enterprise that
will benefit the Nation as a whole, and Mariposa
in particular. The Nation is asked by the pro
moters to give out of what is now lying useless
concession!) nothing like so great as have be< i
given by private land-owners along tbe line of the
new Valley railroad. The law-makers of the Na
tion, exercising tne common-sense that private in
dividuals would use under similar circumstances,
will undoubtedly grant the concessions as provided
In Senator Perkins' bill.
The bill provides further that the company
shall have twenty acres for each of its station
sites. On this point our contemporary re
marks:
It is sincerely to be hoped that the railroad peo
ple will exercise tbe right to use twenty acres
every ten miles as a station. Could anything be
more desirable in the way of opening up the coun
try for settlement? If they find a gold mine at
every stopping place along the road and operate It,
so much the better. It all becomes taxable prop
erty and a source of revenue to tbe county. On
Government lands outside tbe park a man can
ro and locate as many twenty-acre claims as ho
likes, tying them up against settlement, it seems
preferable to give what In the aggregate will
amount to not more than sixty acres, all told, of
the pnbiic estate for station uses and buildings to a
railway proposing to operate a road through a
country whlcb, though picturesque, is now for the
most part, but little better than a howling wilder
ness.
Speaking generally of the duties of citizens
in the premises our exchange says:
Public sentiment should assist this Yosemite and
Merced Railroad Company tn every way. When
new enterprise comes to this long-neglected dis
trict, Martposans should mei-t it with no carping
or ungenerous reception. Petty details should not
be made a bone of contention. Capitalists who are
bona fide helping to open up the marvelous nat
ural resources ot Mariposa should be made to feel
that they are welcome.
The Marin Press, published at Eastland,
Marin,CouDty, gives some intersting informa
tion concerning the operations of the Mill Val
ley Sulphur Springs Company, which has re-
commenced operations on iv property on Cor
nelia avenue. Our contemporary remarks:
A large and wide shaft bas been sunk to a con
siderable deptb, and the sulphuric mud has been
found In large quantities, possessing wonderful
medicinal properties.
One well-known doctor Is quoted as saying that
the mud obtained In Mill Valley far excels that
found in Paso Robles, and, If this is the case, and
there is no reason to doubt it, the Mill Valley mud
baths are going to prove a good thing.
The San Andreas Citizen gives some impor
tant news showing the interest which Is being
taken in developing the water power now
going to waste in the Sierra. It says:
Superintendent E. H. Brandt of the California
Development Company came up from San Fran
cisco Sunday evening. During the week he bas
been Inspecting mining properties and water power
in different portions of the county.
It is expected that the electric lieht and
power plant will be in operation by October 1.
Or. tnis subiect Mr. Brandt said:
In bullaing this plant we are not doing it with
a view of making money: we are putting it up to
secure power for the development of our mining
properties. We will, of course, sell aa many lights
and aa much power as wÂ» can, but our charges will
be very small. We will charge per horse-power U3
cents per day: arc lights 25 cents per day, and 16
candle-power incandescent lights will be but 61
cento per month. This will be the cheapest service
in the State.
That an equally important undertaking con
stitutes part of the company's plans Is shown
by these remarks dropped by Mr. Brandt:
Yes, the electric roa 1 will be built betweerf here
and Valley fp.-iDgs. I have secured a survey of
the route which the Southern PaclHc had made
some weeks ago and this week our engineer will
be sent out to view the route and make such i m
provernents as h- can. When the road Is in work
ing order the trip from the springs to San Andreas
can be made in thirty-five minutes. The trip down
will be made in ten minutes leas. Arrangements
are being mad* with the railroad company which
if completed will enable us to hitch oar cars on
the train and run them to Lodi, thus saving pas
sengers the trouble of changing cars at Valley
Springs and save the shippers the expense of
handling freight at that point.
It is one thing for the people of a section to
be provided with facilities for improving their
condition and another to make the most of
the opportunity offered. The readiness with
which these advantages are accepted not only
measures the progresslveness of tne people,
but serves as an Invitation to capitalists to
Introduce other facilities which if accepted
will advance the general prosperity. As a
rule men of means are always ready to make
valuable Improvements in communities where
they are appreciated, but without such ac
ceptance there is no encouragement for the
incoming of capital. Those communities In
California which exhibit the most substantial
prosperity are generally those which are
readiest to co-operate with outside capitalists.
These remarks are rendered pertinent by
the following paragraph from the Oakdale
Leader:
The people of Oakdale and vicinity now have
what they have been crying for all these yearsâ
water for irrigation. The canal is now finished
sufficient for the present needs and full of water.
Now. in order that Oakdale may receive the imme
diate benefits from this enterprise and that Mr.
Drexler may not feel that oar overtures have
been misleading and oar projects visionary it re
mains for our citizens to utilize the advantages at
hand. Every acre of land in this district that can
possibly be placed in condition to receive water
should be Irrigated. The objects of a prompt and
gpnerous use of water are double. Not only will It
produce a beneficial result in business conditions,
but we shall conrt Mr. Drezler's favor, and as he
is a man of wealth and a progressive irrigation^,
we need him. O nlike the average San Francisco
capitalist, he is not afraid to go out of the City to
Invest his money. He has done much for Fresno
and is to-dÂ»y one of the most extensive raisin
growers of that place as well as a prominent figure
iv its city enterprises. Mr. Urexler likes Oakdale
and .s well pleased with this country. Let Oak
dale make him feel that his investment here has
been profitable and one that justifies him in iden
tifying himself liberally with as in other direc
tions.
The San Diego Union gives full particulars of
the movement begun there for applying to
Congress for a naval drydock at San Diego har
bor. The resolutions adopted by the Chamber
of Commerce there point out the safety of the
harbor, its close proximity to Mexico and its
value as a strategic point in case of war, the
remoteness of the nearest n*val drydock at
San Francisco, the need of a harbor of refuge
and repair and the policy to which the Gov
ernment is commltied by the creation of the
splendid dock at Port Orchard on Puget Sound.

REGATTA DAY
AT SAUSALITO.
Successful Opening of the
San Francisco Yacht
Club.
SAILORS OUT IN FORCE.
Many of the Races Were a Sur
prise, as the Wind Was
Very Fluky.
ONLY ONE ACCIDENT OCCURRED
On the Homeward Run Two of the
Beats Were in Collision for a
Few Moments.
The yacht Ramona was the center of at
traction at Sausalito yesterday.
It was regatta day for the San Francisco
Yacht Club, and around the flagship were
clustered nearly all the contestants.
Each and every one was eager to get
away, and in consequence the Mist crossed
the starting point ahead of time and her
record was not placed among the scores.
The course and regulations were as fol
lows:
Starting from an imaginary line drawn from
flag: on clubhouse wharf to stakeboat Ramona;
thence stakeboatoffAngel Island be.l; thence to
Shag Rock; thence back to starting point, leav
inpall Etakeboats on starboard hand. Clashes
1, 2 and 3 go over the course twice; the others
only once. Finish must be made in crossing
the line by leaving atakebo&t Ramona on star
board hand, and those classes going over the
course twice must leave said stakeboat on star
board hand, both first time around and at
finish.
Those not going oyer the exact course, or
passing Btakeboats on wrong side, may con
sider themselves ruled out, without protest. If
there Is any question of donbt as to the word
ing of the rules it may be answered before the
race on consultation with the regatta com
mittee.
The starters were:

The start was a pretty one, but the Elia
got the better of the starter's gun and was
going free before the Rover was ready to
]ibe. The Queen and Harnoon followed |
the Rover and all set sail after the leading :
yacht but were unable to catch her. She
made the course in 1 hoar 51 minutes and ]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896.
8 seconds, while the Rover wai 2 hours 14
minutes and 11 seconds in covering the
game distance. All over the course it was
a succession of squalls and calms and fre
quently the squalls were from the wrong
direction.
In class 2 the Harpoon made the course
in 2 hours 1 minute and 35 seconds, while
the Edna took 2 hours 54 minutes and 24
seconds to cover the distance. The other
boats did not finish.
T c Mascotte, a late entry, captured the
third event. She covered the course in 1
hour 11 minutes and 27 seconds, while the
best the yawl Pilgrim could do was 8 hours
16 minutes and 15 seconds. It was the most
rluky kind of weather and the yachtsmen
had no chance. The boat that caught the
wind held the lead.
In class 4 the Flash won in the good
time of 1 hour 16 minutes and 47 seconds
and the Mirth was a good second in 1 hour
42 minutes and 54 seconds. The others
were not in it, while in the fifth class t lie
Surprise, Sea Fox and Cisne made a drift
ing match of it, and not one of thorn suc
ceeded in reaching the finishing post in
time.
There were a number of mishaps during
the day and a considerable amount of
wransrling resulted. It was asserted that
the Klin fouled the stakeboat in Mission
Bay, and thus gained a long beat to wind
ward. The captain of the Cathernie (the
stakeboat) was sent for, and he said that
no fouling had taken place and that the
crew of the Elia had handled their boat
like genuine sailors.
During the maneuvering for the start
the Rover got into a pocket and had to
make a long jibe in order to round the
starting-boat. She did not improve her
position during the entire run and only
finished a fair second. Even this conces
sion is disputed, as one of the smaller
boats is said to have beaten her out on
time allowance.
The Clara and "Will o' the Wisp were in
collision off Angel Island, Dut neither of
them was damaged and both yachts
reached home in safety. It was simply a
question of a drifting match.
The Ramona was the mdces' boat and
the judges were Charles G. Yale, Matthew
Turner and J. M. Shotwell. The men who
had charge of the regatta were H. H. Jen
ness, Charles B. Hill and Isadore Gutte.
Commodore Few in the Truant and
Commodore Leonard in the El Sueno and
Captain Engleberg in the Sappho joined
in the races, but only "for the fun of the
thini:," and when they found it was a
question of "whistling for the wind" they
gave it up and sailed back for the club
house. During portions of the day there
was a regular "soldiers' breeze," and at
other times the wind was contrary enough
to make even a sailor swear.
Harry Goodall, the starter, deserves
credit for the manner in which he got the

UNDER THE GREENWOOD.
Annual Excursion of City Officials Into
San Mateo County.
The annual outing of City officials took
place yesterday, ten wagonettes loaded
with municipal employes going on a drive
into San Mateo County. The May excur
sion of last year was poorly attended,
owing to the fact that none of the officials
had been apprised of it, but this year many
bad been invited weeks beforehand, and
the attendance was large. Sheriff Whelan
Judges Campbell and Joachimsen, and a
large number of minor municipal lights,
were on band, and a good lime was en
joyed by all. A lunch was sent to Uncle
Tom's cabin beforehand, and when the
party arrived everything was in readiness
for the guest?. After a day spent "under
the greenwood tree" the party returned to
this City, well satisfied with the excursion.
Shot Holes In a Window.
Ah Sing, a Chinese highbinder, was arrested
early yesterday morning and detained at the
California-street police station on a charge of
assault to murder. Sing was apprehended by
the officers shortly after emptying the con
tents of a large revolver through a window of
a gambling-house on Baker alley.

WILD RIDE OF
THE PASSENGERS,
Thrilling Accident on the
lngleside Electric
Line.
SAVED BY A MIRACLE.
A Mission Electric-Car Jumps
the Track on the Ocean
Road.
A MOTOBMAN'S RECKLESSNESS.
Many of the Passengers Thrown Off
and Several Were Severely
Injure!.
An accident on the lngleside branch of
the Mission telectric line occurred yester
day afternoon, and three passengers were
seriously injured and several badly shaken
up. It was almost a miracle that several
lives were not lost.
Car 1059 was on its way to the lngleside
track about 4 o'clock, loaded with passen
gers. On the Ocean House road, near the
barn of the House of Correction, there is a
gradual incline, and before reaching it the
motorman let loose all the brakes and
turned on the full current. The car dashed
along at a terrific speed.
The result was the car jumped the track,
aped across the other track across a ditch
and up an incline till it bumped against a
clay projection and was brought to a sud
den stop.
Both dummies were crowded and pas
sengers were standing in the passage
ways. All the passengers on the right
hand side of the forward dummy were
thrown to the ground.
P. B. Pendergast, Depmy County Clerk,
living at 94GVÂ£ Minna street, was thrown a
distance of about fifteen fee^ and had his
right knee and hip badly contused.
Two ladies fell on top of each other, the
under one being in a delicate condition and
her injuries may prove fatal. Others were
more or less injured by the shock. The
two ladies were conveyed to a drugstore
on Thirty-first and Valencia streets in a
hack and later to their homes.
Pendergast was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and had his injuries attended to
by Dr. Weil. Although painful they were
not serious and he was able to go to his
home.
Pendergast and his friend, ex-Senator G.
J. McCarthy, 1134'^ Folsom street, who
was also on the car and accompanied him
to the hospital, blamed the motorman for
the accident.
"The motorman was putting on such
speed," said Mr. Pendergast, "that before
we reached the incline I seriously thought
of leaving the car, and I looked up at him
to see if he had been drinking. When he
increased the speed to about fifty miles an
hour just before we struck the incline I
felt sure the car would jump the track,
and it did.
"I was thrown about fifteen feet and if I
had gone a few feet further I would have
struck a T rail and probably had my skuil
fractured or my bones broken. Every one
on the right hand side of the forward
dummy, where I was sitting, was thrown
out."
Ex-Senator McCarthy said:
"I was on the rear dummy, and as I saw
the car would surely jump the track I
braced myself and escaped injury.j ury. I
measuied the distance the car went after
jumping the track and it was twenty-four
very long paces, or about seventy-five feet.
"There is a culvert a few feet from
where the accident occurred, and if the
car had jumped the track a second or so
sooner it would have gone into the cul
vert and several lives would undoubtedly
have been lost.
"The motorman was to dame for the
accident, as he made the car go at a reck
less speed. It is surprising to me that
more people were not hnrt, but we have to
thank the clay bank for it."
HONOR DONE THE DEAD.
Feeling Address Is Made at the Funeral
of Gustavus Litngford
Spear.
The funeral of Gustavus L. Spear, a
member of the oldest firm of auctioneers
in this City, was held yesterday afternoon
at Masonic Temple. The hall was crowded
to the utmost capacity by the members of
the Masonic fraternity and other friends,
who came to do honor to the memory of
the deceased friend and brother.
The obsequies were under the auspices
of California Lodge No. 1, of which Mr.
Spear was a past master.
In attendance also were Golden Gate
Commandery No. 16, Knights Templar;
the Grand ConsiÃtory of the A. A. 8. K. of
California, and the subordinate council of

by Charles Lewio Patton, past master of
California Memorial Lodge.
The body was escorted to tlie Masonic
Cemetery by the various lodges, where it

tiful and symbolic rites of the societies of
which Mr.'Spear was an honored member.
CROWNING THE KING.
Red Men's Shooting Section Decorates
the Hero of Their Annual
Contest.
The Red Men's Shooting Section had a
merry time at California Hall laat evening.
It was their fifth anniversary ball, and
following the custom of the society it was
also the occasion of crowning the shooting
king for the ensuing year.
The right to this much-coveted title was
earned at the eagle-shooting at Shell
Mound Park Sunday, April 26. Eagle
shooting is a traditional pastime in Ger
many, and the lucky winner of the contest
is termed the shooting king until the an
nual recurrence of the contest.
C. Stein was the candidate for honors
last evening. He was pr oclaimed king by
Captain John Tiedeman, to which the new
king made a response. The Misses Bacber
and Miss Schoening, members of the
Ladies' Schuetzen Club, then decorated
him with a mammoth floral wreath.
Prizes were distributed for the largest
number of points made as follows:
First, John Tiedeman; second, W. KreutÃ
kamm; third. H. Bach; fourth, John Felder
xnann; fifth, E. Goebel; seventh, John Olberg;
eighth, C. Trestz; ninth, P. H. BulflÂ».
At the conclusion of the awarding of
prizes ttie grand inarch was formed, with
King Stein and his wife leading. Dancing
was enjoyed for the rest of the night. W.
Kreutzkamm acted as floor manager. The
committee of arrangements was P. H.
Will, M. Dieckert and W. Kreutzkamm.
Yesterday's FJreJAlarms.
An alarm was turned in through box 98 at
3 p. m. yesterday for a fire in Swan's painting
establishment, at 759 Market street. The
blaze was caused by a defective flue. The dam
age amounted to about $10. The alarm
sonnded from box 136 last evening at 7:30
o'clock was for a fire in a two-story frame
dwelling at 1111 Van Ness avenue. The build
ing is owned by the Ladles' Relief .Society and
is occupied by Mr. Henry. A lace curtain ig
niting from a gas jet started the blaze. The
damage will amount to about $100. The alarm
from box 01 at 8:30 F. m. was for a small blaze
caused by the careless use of matches in a
dwelling-house occupied by John Kodgers, at
156 Clementina street. The building waa
damaged to the extent of $150.
TRADES COUNCIL MEETING
The Unemployed of the Labor
Unions Enrolled for Picket
Duty.
Reports of District Committees on the
Cardâ All Jobs Must Ba
Unionized.
A meeting of the unemployed belong
ing to the labor unions under the auspices
of the Trades Council was held in the
Turk-street Temple yesterday afternoon.
John McCartney was elected chairman
and W. Neergard secretary of the meeting.
Chairman McCartney said the object of
the meeting was to push the card among
workmen. Everyone must labor to bring
all operatives Into the union, and for that
purpose was the City districted and a
committee chosen to work each locality.
The reports of several of the committees
were read. In many places non-union
men were at work, especially among car
penters. In some places men were work
ing nine hours, beinc obliged to do so by
employers who were wealthy and could
afford to tie the jobs up for years, and
were only letting them be worked "merely
for amusement."
Mr. Hose took the floor and said this
would not do, and that every job in the
City must be unionized.
"We are out to establish the working
card or die in the attempt," said he.
"This is too serious a matter to let go by
neglect."
Mr. Hughes moved that the unions be
asked to have their unemployed sent to
the Board of Building Trades "to be en
rolled for picket duty in the different dis
tricts. The motion was carried.
On the whole, the reports were encour
aging, as many contained promises to get
cards. Mr. Rose thought that a promise
on their part was not enough, but it must
be seen tnat they procured them.
Mr. Bean spoke in the same strain, and
said that all must keep up the fight. At
his suggestion a count was taken, and
eighteen persons present were found to be
unemployed. They were enrolled among
the district committees for picket duty.
The Alta Gun Club.
The A Ha Gun Club held its second medal shoot

NEW WALDECK
SANITARIUM.
Modern Home for the Sick
Opened on Jones
Street, i
STERILIZATION FOR ALL.
Corporation Formed for the Com
mon Good of the
Members.
AN UP-TO-DATE INSTITUTION.
Why a Humorously Inclined Visitor
Concluded That in Silence
Is Strength.
The tendency of the present day to
specialization is aptly exemplified in the
new Waldeck Sanitarium, 717 Jones street.
It is perhaps one of the most unique
The Beautiful Sanitarium, Where Favored Patients of Eminent Physicians Will
Be Cared For.
and scientifically equipped institutions of
the kind on the Pacific Coast, and one
from which the physical sufferer can truly
draw the balm which is in Gilead.
The Sanitarium is strictly what its
name implies, and in no sense can it be
considered as a hospital. Some of the
leading physicians of the City, believing
that by co-operation many common bene- i
tits could be derived and many medical
appliances kept for the common use that
otherwise would be entirely unavailable,
came together and formed a corporation;
the object of which is to give the patients
of each of the members the advantages of
a first-class, modern private hospital.
-The building was constructed by Dr. M..
Herzstein, one of the corporation, who
leased it to that body, and the architect
secured for the mechanical work was
Lyons. But the general details of the
construction were by Drs. Herzstein and
Cooper. Many of the devices for the
operating-room also were the exclusive
idea of Dr. Cooper.
In external finish the building is in ac
cordance with the latest and most ar
tistic designs. Situated as it is, high on
the slope of the hill, above the murky at
mosphere of the manufacturing district,
the air- is pure and invigorating. A broad,
spacious veranda juts out from tbe sixth
or upper story, where invalids in the con
valescent stage can get the full benefits of I
both air and sunshine. In case the breeze
be too strong tne patient is stationed in a
neat, cheerful solarium.
The minutest wants of the invalid have
been consulted. By a broad carriage-way
which leads into the northern side of the
building the disembarking of patients
from vehicles in rainy weather, when the
elements would render exposure danger
ous, is obviated.
Coming to the interior, the first thing of
which the visitor makes mental note is the
eenerM air of cheerfulness that prevails.
The furniture is all painted white, the
walls in many cases are the same, and
even the bright and comely nurses that
trip noiselessly round the apartments are
robed from head to foot in garments of the
same snowy hue.
In ventilation the degree of perfection j
attained is the first thing requiring !
analysis. The fresh air ia taken from a
point above the roof, goes to the basement
through a fan driven by an electric motor, j
where a part is heated.
Hot and cold air are driven to each
room independently. By this arrange
ment a fevered patient might have the
air tempered to his condition, and yet a
patient in the next room, suffering with a
chill, be in an atmosphere from 20 to 30
deg. warmer.
"This is sometrong which, to the best of
my. knowledge, is entirely new," said Dr.
Hertzstein, chuckling and rubbing his
hands together with satisfaction as he
ushered his visitors from one place of in
terest to another, "and the beneficial re
sults we shall obtain from it are such as
will amply repay us for our time, labor
and worriment."
On each floor is a nurse's waiting-room,
in which are provided the registers for
cailbells, and a local telephone tsystem
connects the various parts of the edifice.
But it is the scientific methods and ap
pliances brought into use in the surgical
and medical departments that excite the
visitors' wonder, it is sterilized Here,
sterelized there and sterilized everywhere.
The water is sterilized, there is nn appara
tus for steam sterilizing of dressings,
when beds are evacuated they are put into
a .curious looking combination of engine
arid oven and â sterilized.
One of "the party, humorously inclined,
remarked that it was funny they didn't
sterilize the tables and chairs: whereupon
one of the physicians, without the sem
blance of a smile, ushered the party into
another room, where the operating table
was, and gravely pointed out the appara
tus used to sterilize it. The humorously
inclined person was silent thereafter.
One part of the building Is devoted en
tirely to baths. There are mud baths, va
por baths, sulphur baths and some sci
entific baths that a layman can poorly de
scribe.
Every bath at the Waldeck conforms to
the law of sterilization. Dr. Cooper even
went so far as to suggest that the press
representative be sterilized to show one of
the particular processes employed.
The dumbwaiters, the elevator, the venti
lation and every one of the various mechan
isms in the structure are operated by elec
tricity, a large dynamo being situated in
the basement.
All in all, the building in entirety and
in detail, in scientific equipment and in
appliances for ease and comfort is one of
which San Francisco can justly be proud.
One novel feature is the donating of cer
tain rooms for the use of the press, the
police and indigent patients free of charge.
The corporation is composed of the fol
lowing physicians, surgeons, gynecolo
gists, oculists and aurists: Consulting
physicians, surgeons and gynecologists â

OLD PEOPLE'S HOME.
There Are More Kettldents There at This
Time Than Ever Before.
The annual meeting of the board of
managers of the Old People's Home,
corner of Pine and Pierce streets, which is
to be held this afternoon, will probably be
adjourned until Saturday afternoon, as it
will be impossible to prepare the annual
reports until that time.
"We have had a very quiet and unevent
ful year, 1 ' said the Rev. Charles McKelvey,
the superintendent and chaplain of the
home yesterday. "In fact Mrs. E. C.
Wright said to me a few days since
that it has been the most uneventful year
in the history of the home. There is "now
and has been this year a larger number of
people here and there has been less fric
tion than ever before.
"We have now fifty-five men and eighty
three women, ranging in age from 63 to 91
years, and we have but two unoccupied
rooms. One old lady reached her ninety
fiist year on the 23d of last month. Yes
terday we lost by death one oi the ladies,
Mrs. Johanna Brar.n, who had been a resi
dent of the home for five and a half years.
She was buried this afternoon. During
the year but eight deaths have occurred."
PATRIOTS INDORSED.
A Graceful Act by Valentine IJolt Soci
ety of the California Branck of
Children of the Revolution.
The young patriots who last February
organized the Valentine Holt Society of
Children of the American Revolution are
exceedingly enthusiastic, and each mani
fests a deep interest in the affairs of the
society at each meeting. At a meeting
held last Saturday afternoon in the resi
dence of Mrs. D. J. Tallant, 2211 Washing
ton street, Tecumseh P., Charles H. and
Jennie Sherman, descendants of Hon.
Daniel Sherman of Woodbury, Conn., a
member of the Committee of Inspection,
whose duty was to promote the enlistment
of soldiers in the Revolutionory army, for
four years a member of the "Council of
Safety" by appointment of the general as
sembly and representative for the town of
Woocibury for sixty-five semi-annual ses
sions, from 1754 to 1791, were elected mem
bers of the society.
The following, introduced by Miss Isabel
Dennbon, was adopted by a rising vote:
Whereas, The Valentine Holt Society of the
Children of the American Revolution has
learned that through the efforts of Francis and
Oonaunce Fairchild, the little daughters of
George M. Fairchild of "Ravenscliffe," near
Quebec, Canada, a handsome marble tablet
has been erected la the courtyard of the old
military prison on Citadel Hill, Quebec, to the
memory of lieneral Montgomery's soldiers who
were killed in the assault on Quebec, Decem
ber 31, 1775; and whereas, this act of patri
otic zeal must commend itself to every loyal
American citizen, and especially to those or
gfTnized societies whose object is to foster true
patriotism and perpetuate the memory and
spirit of the men and women who achieved
American independence: therefore be it
Resolved, That in grateful recognition of the
patriotic spirit that has animated these chil
dren In the accomplishment of this noble un
dertaking Valentine Holt Society of the Chil
dren of the American Revolution of San Fran
cisco, Cal., esteeming it an honor to have
borne upon its roll of membership the names
of these younj; patriots do hereby elect Fran
cis and Constance Fairchild honorary members
of the aocietv.
Tne members of the society were re
quested to display the American flag from
their respective residences on the 14th of
next June, the one hundred and nineteenth
anniversary of its adoption.
At the close of the business meeting
John and Selden S. Tallant assisted the
hostess in receiving and entertaining the
young patriots in a dignified and charm
ing manner.
In addition to the large line of ready-framed
Pictures closing out at half price we have
many new Pictures in the sheet coming in and
new Moldings; beautiful designs for framing
at moderate prices. San born, Vail <Jt Co., 741

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896.
WAITING FOR CANDIDATES
A Call Made for Committeemen
of the French So
ciety.
MIXED TIP WITH POLITICS.
Cause of the Recent Rumpus in the
Societe Francaise de Bienfaisance
Mutuelle.
Sylvain Weill, who recently resigned
from the Societe Francaise de Bienfaisance
Mutuelle as its president and as a director,
is still obdurate, in the face of a most flat
tering siege by scores of societaires who
have appealed to him for a withdrawal of
his resignation.
"I did not resign in anger," said he,
"nor do I propose to recall my decision
excepting under one condition. My resig
nation was tendered because of the affront
made by the committee to Drs. Bngham
and Boyd, two capable practitioners who,
without remuneration, have served the
society faithfully for years and who de
served better treatment. If these gentle
men are reinstated I will be willing to re
sume the duties from which I have with
drawn."
Whether the action of the committee
last week, prior to the general breaking
up, in electing Drs. de Marville and Mayer
as against Drs. Brigham and Boyd can be
recalled is a subject that must be decided
by the two-third vote of the entire mem
bership of the society, a condition which
is hardly practicable, as of the total mem
bership roll of 4000 nearly half is made up
of subscribers at large, even as far off an
the home country.
Of the ten members of the committee
who resigned the other night, six have re
gretted their hasty action and are again
back in the fold with the four men who
stood by their vote to oust Drs. Brigham
and Boyd. Among these ten is J. Des
champs, who, as secretary, resigned when
President Weill did. but who, realizing
the very awkward position in which the
society found itself, urged the other com
mitteemen to return as he did himself. He
realized the fact that, according to law,
the standing of the society might be in
volved, and that any stickler of a member
might appeal to the courts to have a re
ceiver appointed.
Secretary Descbamps, backed by the
other nine members of the committee, yes
terday published a bulletin notifying the
members of the society that there were
five vacancies in the committee, and that
" any member in good standing for a year
at least, a Frenchman or born of French
parents, or son of a naturalized French
man " desiring to be a candidate for such
office, must present his name at society
headquarters before 5 o'clock next Satur
day afternoon.
'1 he next move will be to call a general
meeting for May 17. when the names of the
candidates will be voted upon and a new
president elected.
After that the society will be on its old
time footing with a standing order to Su
perintendent Wolff not to overlook hoist
ing the American flag on a National holi
day. Apropos of that flag episode, it may
De stated that only a few disgruntled mem
bers regarded it as a slight to Old Glory.
It was not intended as such and was
simply an oversight on the part of the su
perintendent.
But, to eet back to the split-up in the
society and its causes. E. Marque, the
editor of the Petit Californien, in bis issue
of last Saturday, reviews the situation.
According to Mr. Marque, politics entered
to a great extent into the management of
the hospital, resulting in the unlooked-for
snub to Drs. Brigham and Boyd. In other
words, a powerful ring was formed in the
bosom of a friendly aggregation in such a
quiet way that not until the bombshell
burst was its existence known.
Le Petit Californien says that Superin
tendent Wolff for many months had been
at outs with Dr. Voisard, tne resident
physician. When elections were approach
ing, or rather during the heat of the cam
paign in which they deemed it advisable
for self-protection to stand together, the
"glad hand" was extended and accepted.
The combination had Drs. Brigham and
Boyd in the corridors of the hospital giv
ing them the "go-by" and "glassy eye," or
expressions to that effect in French. Then,
so the Marque story goes, the members of
the committee who either had relatives
employed at the hospital or whose friends
had relatives there were pledged to vote
for the Wolff-Voisard candidates or else
suffer the consequences.
The results show for themselves. The
slate was broken. Sylvain Weill, the
time-honored president, and four other
directors have stepped down and out. Drs.
Brigham and Boyd, the faithful but un
paid servants, have been cast aside, and
there is a solid ten in the committee with
Wolff and Voisard as "bosses," in the
plain American political vernacular.
But there is this that can be said: The
French Hospital, with ail its new and
magnificent paraphernalia, is still one of
the grandest institutions of its kind in the
United States, and even if there has been
a change of directors and a physician or
two, the latter are equally as good as those
who were there, even if some amour
propre has been piqued.
OPALS FOR THE MUSEUM
The Park Now Possesses the
Finest Collection in the
World.
A Sudden Rent in the Canvas Disap
points Lela Adair at the
Last Moment.
A heavy Scotch mist began sweeping
dismally through the park yesterday dur
ing the earlier part of the afternoon.
Crowds of gayly dressed people had
thronged there, but the band had scarcely
begun the second number on the pro
gramme when the wind and the rain
came and great was the falling off there
upon of the multitude which poured out
in a disappointed flood down through the
gates into the City.
Apparently the most disappointed one
of all was Lela Adair, the aeronaut at the
chutes. Her big balloon was nearly in
flated with hot air and was straining at
the ropes. She held the trapeze in her
bands. Word was given to let go and the
balloon rose a few feet in the air,
but only a lew feet and then showly
sank.
. "It's busted!" â¢ cried . a little boy . on
Haight street, using . a hole in the fence
for a trumpet. The information, however,
was; unnecessary. - The expectant crowd
had also seen the big rent in the side, and
so the ascension was postponed until next
Sunday. . "^Qgg^t9ia^%^BUX^aia!t?ia^a
The . museum at the park was crowded
all day. During the past week over 9000
visitors passed through the gates.
Many rare and valuable curios have been
received recently by Curator Wilcomb, do
nated by people both here and in the East.
â¢ "The rarest * ana most valuable," said
Professor Wilcomb, "is a collection of
opals, donated by 1 8.' M: Davis, a gentle
man who has devoted a great many, years
to gathering this collection, procuring the
specimens from all over the world.
. "There are 288 specimens altogether, of
which there are thirty-eight varieties. The
opals are precious and semi-precious.
"This," he said, holding in his hand a
large porous stone on which the pure opal
heaped itself in layers, having the appear
ance of mother-of-pearl, only richer in iri
descent colors, "is a particularly tine speci
men from Mexico.
'The delicate play of colors observed in
opals has been ascribed to small micro
scopic cavities which reflect the rays. As
a rule piecious opals are seldom larger
than a hazelnut, but very large specimens
have been found.
"In Mexico this opalâ the fire-opalâ is
in certain localities quite abundant. They
vary m color from hyacinth-red to honey
yellow. Sometimes they are exceedingly
beautiful.
"This is a blackmorite named from the
place where it is foundâ Mt. Blackmore.
in Montana.
"Among the most remarkable of opals
are the jasp-opal, the hyalite, which is as
transparent as glass, and the mood opal.
Precious opals are chiefly found in Hun
gary, although some very" line varieties are
obtained in Honduras and in Iceland.
'This collection of Mr. Davis' is prob
ably the finest in the worlu. It is a great
acquisition to the museum."
Work on the museum annex is progress
ing as rapidly as possible, but the building
will not be occupied nrobably for another
week. v
Ten thousand or more people visited
Sutro's baths yesterday. The fog and mist
Â°Â°vi ld t. not t^Qetrate into that luxurious es
tablishment. There was a grand concert
by the Eighteenth Regiment band in the
afternoon, and the members of the Cali
fornia Swimming Club, who were out in
full force, gave an impromptu exhibition
<" h Â»gh, fancy and trick diving.
There were two 200-yard swimmine
races for amateurs, the first of which was
a dead heat and was very exciting, L.
Cooper and R. Cornwell coming in first
and J. Geddes second. In the second race
for youths F. Geddes was first and L. L.

second.
Besides the races there was the usual
performance of contortionists and tight
rope walkers. It is the intention of
Colonel Robinson to thoroughly equip the
baths with all the necessary turning
boards and to have correctly measured
courses of all distances from* fifty yards
up to five miles, and to institute a series
of champion amateur races, and with the
talent which the Colonel believes avail
able be will undoubtedly break some
world records.
"There is no limit to the wonders in
Flora's domain," remarked head gar
dener Holbrow in the conservatory in
the Park yesterday as he drew attention
to some five ferns that he Keeps tinder
glass and in the shade. "Tfcis is the film
fern of the most delicate texture. Its
botanical name is Todea Superba. It is
from Australia, and grows under cascades
where the spray may continually reach it.
It will not live without water, and in order
to keep it alive here it has to be sprayed
very frequently dnrinu the day. Another
variety of it is the Prince of Wales fern,
so named because it grows like the plumes
that are so familiar with the motto 'Ich
Dien' under them.
"In this same case there is what is known
as the hogs-ear fern, a very rare plant,
which receives its name from its resem
blance in shape to a hog's ear."
One of the beauties in bloom in the
conservatory at this time is the Asiatic
Hlv, which from a mass of large green
leaves is sending forth a number of very
pretty white blossoms. In the big pond
may be seen some beautiful water lilies of
bluish and yellow color, while on the edge
of the pond is a Mexican orchid that is
sending forth a flower that is remarkable
for its markings of yellow and brown. It
ii known as the Oncendium.
MAE HOLDEN'S SUICIDE.
A Divorced and an Unhappy Woman
Shoots Herself in the Head.
At 1 o'clock Sunday morning the report
of a pistol shot attracted the roomers at
518 Geary street. Investigation showed
that a woman known as Mac Kline had
sent a bullet through her brain.
In her room a letter was found from her
friend who signed himself Fred, saying he
would have no more to do with her. This
probably caused her to end her life.
During the afternoon of yesterday
"Fred" called at the Morgue and stated
that his name was Fred Bastain and that
he was engaged as a machinist with the
Joshua Hendy Machine Works on Fre
mont street.
Little is known about the woman on this
side of the bay further than that she was
married to a railroad man named Kline,
who died some years ago in Oakland. She
afterward married another railroad hand
named T. L. Holden, who obtained a
divorce from her in one of the Alameda
County courts.
She and Bastain came to this City from
across the bay a few months ago and she
at once started into the half world, which
from Bastaiu's letter did not please him,
so he notified her that he would desert her.
The suicide of the woman was the result.

CHEER FOR TEMPERANCE,
One Cadet's Splendid Essay
Wins for Him a Silver
Medal.
FIVE CONTEST FOR A PRIZE.
Large Crowds Attend the Fourth Dis
trict Rally of the League of
the Cross.
Benjamin L. McKinley, a cousin of the
Ohio statesman of that name, delivered a
magnificent essay on temperance before a
large audience at Native Sons' Hall yes
terday afternoon and was awarded a silver
medal for his effort, it being the best of
the competition in which five members of
the League of the Cross took part.
It was the occasion of the grand quar
terly rally of the League of the Cross of
the Fourth District, which includes the
branches from the cathedral, St. Bridget's,
Sacred Heart, Holy Cross and St. Francis.
The cadets from the cathedral and St.
Bridget's Church were present in uniform,
and the branches from all the parishes
turned out in force. There was not stand
in c room when the exercises began.
D. J. Mahoney acted as chairman of the
meeting, which was opened by the sing
inf, of the "Veni Creator" by the boys and
the audience, the singing being led by the
Rev. Father Yorke. Miss Marie Georgiani
accompanied on the piano.
Father Yorke also read the prayer, and
the chairman spoke briefly of the history
of the League of the Cross, its objects and
aspirations. He explained that the junior
branch was composed of young men and
boys who took the pledge of total absti
nence until they were 21 years of age.
Mips Catherine Block rendered "You,"
by Robin, so acceptably that she was
obliged to respond to an encore, when she
pave the old. song, "I Cannot Sing That
Sons? To-Night." -
Professor S. J. Sandy sang "Rocked in
the Cradle of the Deep 1 ' in splendid voice,
and Miss Gonzales gave two recitations in
a way that delighted the audience.
The assembly sane: "America," and then
Harry Dinan, Miss Kirby and Miss Ma
honey entertained the audience.
The contest for the silver medal for the
best essay was most exciting. The con
testants were as follows: Cathedral, Cor
poral Benjamin L. McKinley ; St. Bridget's,
Serjeant James Touhy ; Sacred Heart,
Corporal James Carew ; St. Francis, Private
Rudolph Rulf; Holy Cross. Private Wil
liam Enright. "
The conditions of the contest were: (1)
Literary merit, (2) argument, (3) delivery,
each essay being limited to 1000 words.
The judges . were Professor Silas A.
White, principal of the Spring Valley
Grammar School; Miss Agnes M. Man
ning, principal of the Webster Primary,
and Miss Mary A. Roper of the same
school.
Corporal Benjamin L. McKinley was
awarded the medal and Sergeant James
Touhy was second. The others were gen
erously praised for their respective efforts.
The prize essay is as follows :
"Why I Am a Total Abstainer." There is
perhaps no other question which commands
bo much of the thought and attention of the
civilized world at the present time as the ques
tion of the constantly increasing sale and use
of intoxicating drink. It is a matter which af
fects man In every relation of his beingâ as a
sentient animal organism, as a free and intel
ligent agent subject to the moral law and re
sponsible to his Creator for its violation, and
as a unit in the great social organism.
In the physical life of man there are certain
substances which are necessary in the building
up and development of his bodily strength
and In the repairing of the waste and wear in
cident to his healthful activity. When these
substances are taken into the system, each in
its turn is absorbed by the tissues and con
verted into nlesh, bone, fiber, muscle or brain
and becomes part and parcel of the man.
when alcoholic liquor is introduced Into
the system it acts like a burning firebrand; it
inflames and blisters every membrane that it
touches; it rushes to the head and benumbs
the brain; it disturbs. the pulsations of the
heart ; it affects the respiration; and in fact
every organ of the body rises with one accord
to repel the intruder.- Alcohol cannot in any
sense be called food; it does not build up- it
can only tear down and destroy ; ana if its use
hS^i ,V n X? dl . th J9J 9 , unÃtead y ste P- the palsied
hand, the bloated face, the bleary eyes and the
clouaed brain tell their story to the world of
nature s revenge for her violated laws.
But there is another and more important
consideration; man is more than a mere "i
-unl? HÂ« G Â£? mMdcm M dc hlm a little less than th Â«
angels. He gave him an immortal soul formed
in His own image and likeness, and a . moral
law, by the observance ot which he might pur-
S,^ c lot at ""I 1 ! he reward of eternal hap
piness The ' awful , manner in which lndul
nt nn p C B KÂ° n *,, drlllk destroys that image and
likeness of the Creator in the soul, and sets at
naucht the precepts of that moral law, is too
plainly exemplified in the thousands of moral
wrecks that strew the i shores of â  the | ocean of
life. Its attractiveness is the secret of its
power. The spirit indeed is willing, but the
flesh is weak ; the young man who takes into
his hand for the first time that poisoned cup
would shudder at the thought of a felon's cell
or a drunkard's grave. But he does not stop
there; " He that loves the danger shall rerish
therein " ; or, as a great poet has expressed it :
Vice is a monster of so frightful mien
That to be hated needs but to be seen:
But seen too oft, familiar with her fnce,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
Go forth into the crowded streets of our
great cities and see what a fearlul heritage of
misery, degradation and crime is being laid
up for the youth of future generations by the
rumseller and his victims ; go to the hospitals
and asymms, where human beings, deprived
of God's most precious gift, are shrieking in
the unspeakable agonies of a delirium whose
only end is a hopeless aud unrepenting death â¢
goto the prison cell, whore the outcast of society
is cut off from communion with his kind- go
into the black shadow of the gallows, where
the guilty wretch who has imbrued his hands
in his brother's blood, yields up his wasted Hie
as the penalty of his crimes! Gaze on these
sights, and the thousand more that are daily
exposed to our unwilling view, and behold tne
effects of the first indulgence in that sweet
convivial glass, amid the seductive surround
ings of the saloon! Would to God that we
could write above the door oi every grogshop
in the land those awful words which Dante
wrote across the gates of hell: "Leave ho,.e
behind, all ye who enter here!"
But half of the awiul truth is yet untold. If
the drunkard's curse perished with his miser
able self, its evil would be immeasurably less
But it falls like a withering blight on innocent
and guihy alike, and involves them both in a
common destruction. "The sins of the parents
shall be visited upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation." What fearful
meaning is there in these prophetic words,
and what bitter truth when applied to the
drunkard's home. Home? Alasl that the
abode of love and truth and virtue should De
compared with & cage of unclean beastsl Why
are the gray hairs of that fatner and mother
brought down in sorrow to the prave? Why is
that patient, suffering wife dragged to the
lowest depths of want and despair, striving to
prevent the scant earnings of her own bitter
toil from rolling over the rumseller's counter?
Why are those innocent cuildren. deprived ot
a father's care, running wild in the streets,
with blasphemies falling from their baby lips
from the first moment that they learned to lisp
the name of God?
Why do these children go forth from such
surroundings and become wanderers on the
face of the earthT Why swell the ranks of
lawlessness and crime and transmit the curse
which darkens their own lives to the children
who succeed them? It is because the husband
and father, like Esau of old, has bartered his
birthright for his stomach's sake, and the curse
of God hangs over his posterity.
From these well-known facts we can draw but
one conclusion. Avoid the cause and you
avoid its effects. A wise man will profit from
the experience of others, and in view of the
fact that the first glass begets the desire, and
that the gratification of thai desire is the ruin
of the man, physically, morally and socially, 1
have decided to remove myself from the temp
tation to take that first step by remaining a
total abstainer.
Professor White in delivering the de
cision of the judges paid a glowing tribute
to the excellency of all the essays, ana he
encouraged the boys to go right ahead in
their splendid work in the cause of temper
ance and humanity.
Fathers Mulligan and Yorke also ad
dressed the members of the league and the
gathering dispersed by the singing of the
"Te Deum."
A BAY PIRATE ARRESTED.
Alfred Smith Arrested on Charges
of Burglary and Va
grancy.
The Police Believe He Has Been Com
mitting Numerous Thefts From
Sloops in the Bay.
Alfred Smith, who, according to the
water-front police, is a "bay pirate" and
"dope fiend," was detained at the City
Prison yesterday morning by Policemen
J. M. Dwyer and George Brown on the
charges of burglary and vagrancy.
The complaining witness in the burglary
charge is James Colville, owner of the
sloop Comfort, and a member of the Asso
ciated Engineers. There is no direct evi
dence against Smith, but tne arresting
officers are working on the case.
"I came here from the East about two
months ago," said Colville yesterday,
"and having spent most of my life work
ing indoors 1 thought I would like to
spend the remainder of my life in the
open air. I was advised to try my luck in
the ciam-fishing business, so I bought the
sloop Comfort.
"Not being familiar with the business I
wanted a man to help me, and Smith
hearing of my wish called upon me and
offered his services. I agreed to take him
in as a partner and to give him one-third
of the profits. He was with me for five
days and did nothing but lie around and
eat and drink.
"I was advised to get rid of him, which I
did. On Friday night, April 24, I was
with the boys for a few hours and got on
hoard the sloop, which was lying alongside
Fisherman's wharf, about 9 o'clock.
I wound up my watch by the light of the
moon and turned in. When I awoke next
morning my watch and chain, which I
value at $40, were gone, and the thief had
locked the door of my cabin."
Smith is a lanky looking fellow, 26 years
of age. In 1887, while employed in Je
notti's clam market on Clay street, he was
sent in a boat with $62 to Pinole to pay
the men's wages. He left the boat, which
was wrecked. He was arrested but escaped
conviction. He was also arrested on sus
picion of breaking into the room of John
Olsen, owner of the sloop Lizzie, on Val
lejo and Davis streets, and stealing his
watch and chain, but Olsen refused to
prosecute him.

Fanning of the California Wing
Club Makes a Splendid
Record.
HE WON TWO FINE MEDALS.
A Merchandise Prize Contest Brings
Out a Large Number of Shot
gun Experts.
The live pigeon shooters and the inani
mate target sportsmen were out in full
force yesterday at the Oakland racetrack,
and great interest was manifested, cot
only in the club matches, but in the pool
contests that followed. Many shot in both
stands.
The regular monthly shoot of the Cali
fornia Wing Shooting Club drew a large
attendance. T. H. Keller, who recently
arrived from the East in the interests of
an ammunition manufactory, H. McMur
chy of Sacramento and Mr. Johnson shot
ag guests of the club and they made good
scores. The principal event was the
club's rneaal match at twelve birds, twenty
eight yards, unknown traps, bqth barrels
allowed. In this match quite alJumberof
lost birds died out of botMids. In this re
spect Haight was particularly unfortunate,
losing three birds, which were hit hard
and dropped dead just over the fence.
However, it broke what would have been
a good score. The best work of the day
was done by Fanning, who not only killed
all of his birds, but he dropped each with
the tirst barrel, and did not once have oc
casion to pull his second trigger. The
club scores were as follows:

THE HANDBALL COURTS,
Great Interest Manifested in the
Coining Championship
Match.
A Number of Exciting and Closely
Contested Games Played
Yesterday.
GrÂ§at interest is being manifested in
handball circles in the match to be played
next Sunday afternoon in the San Fran
cisco court between J. Harlow and John
Kiordan for the coast championship.
Riordan held the championship for some
years. About a year ago Harlow chal
lenged him, to play for the championship
and $50 a side and deposited $20 with The
Call. Riordan failed to cover the amount
and Harlow claimed the championship,
which. he has held since then.
The wish has always been expressed by
friends of both men that they should play
a match to settle who was really entitled
to the position of champion, and it will
come off next Sunday afternoon. Both
are in active training for the event and
each feels confident of success.
Yesterday there was a large attendance
at each of the courts. At the San Fran
cisco court the principal attraction was a
match between P. T. Donnelly, the ama
teur champion, and R. Linehan and Har
low. thecoast champion, and J. Feeney.
Each of the five games was stubbornly
contested and the final was won by Don
nelly and Linehan by live aces.
At the Union court the event of the day
was a match between J. J. Feenev and
Terry McMauus and R. Linehan and J.
Rodgers, the two former winning the finai
game by only one ace. Next Sunday af
ternoon, commencing at 1 o'clock, Don
nelly, the amateur champion, and T. F.
Bonnet will play R. Linehan and J. J.
Feeney, the crackajacks of the court,
which will be a match well worth seeing.
Following were the games played yes
terday:

WONG SAM ARRESTED.
The Chief "Witness Against Dick Wil
liams Agiin in the
Toil*.
Wong Sam was arrested Saturday on a
complaint sworn out by LouiToom, charg
ing him with forgery.
The accused claims that he is being per
secuted by Richard S. "Williams, the Cus
torn-nouse inspector, now under indict
ment on four different counts by the
United States Grand Jury.
Wong Sam is the chief witness asainst
Wiliams. The latter had him arrested for
aiding in the landing of a Chinese girl,
Dong Sun Yet, for immoral purposes, but
the United States Grand Ju/y dismissed
the charges.
Now Williams is after Wong Sam again.
He wants him out of the way, as Sam will
give damaging testimony against Wil
liams, who must answer the charges of
conspiracy and bribery. Wong Sam was
released on $3000 bail.
CRICKET ON TWO GROUNDS
Both Matches Are One-Sided,
Particularly the Alameda-
California.
At Alameda the Bohemians Were
Badly Beaten by the Pacific
Eleven.
Neither of the cup cricket matches
played yesterday could be called particu
larly interesting. At Alameda the Bohe
mians, minus their regular captain, Wil
liam .Robertson, met the Pacifies. Cap
tain George Theobald of the latter club,
winning the toss, sent bis opponents in.
They were disposed of for a total of 59
runs, to which Martin, with 21, was the
only considerable contributor. The Pa
rities then faced the bowling of Cookson
and Reynolds. Pocock was the first to do
any scoring, and put up a somewhat
lucky 27. Up to the fall of the seventh
wicket the result hung in the balance.
Then Cassidy settled matters by hitting
up a timely 23, not out. lAt the tenth
wicket the telegraph board registered 104.
In their second essay the Bohemians only
managed to score a puny 28, thus leaving
the Pacifies victorious by an inning and 17
runs. The fiaiding features of the game
were Tiedemann's catch of Reeves ana
Young's catch of Reynolds. The scores:

Owing to the absence of the best Califor
nia players the contest between that club
and the Alamedas at Golden Gate turned
out a veritable farce. Alameda lost the
toss and were put in. With the loss of only
four wickets a total of 224 runs was com
piled and then Captain Hogue called the
mninj:. The scorers were Moriarty, who,
after a let off early in the fight, put up 68;
Price, who played a good inning of 84, and
Bird, with 36, not outâ extras 14. Towns
ley, Guild, Banner and Gelatly bowled
against them.
The Californias then went in and were
dismissed, first for 59 and then for 99 runs,
no individual particularly distinguishing
himself. The Alameda bowlers were
Ward Sr., Ward Jr., Peel, Driftield and
Bragg, the last named accomplishing the
"hat trick" for the second time this sea
son. Result, a victory for Alameda by an
inning and 66 runs.

AT SHELL MOUND.
Good Scores Mads With Target
Plstols-MlHtary Marksmen's
Monthly Records.
The fifty-shot pistol match between
Smith, Carr and A. H. Pape did not take
place at the Shell Mound ranee yesterday.
It was discovered that Carr's trigger had
been worn down by use; that it was lighter
than the regulation two-pound pull, and
there wai no way then to stiffen it. How
ever, several matches were shot for small
purses. In the iirst, a th:rty-shot event,
the scores in strings of ten, on the Colum
bia target, were: Carr 42, 42, 47; F. O.
Young 51, 50, 52; J. fi. Gorman 58, 63, 50.
A. H. Pape shot two strings of ten and
made 55, 52.
Another pool match took place, in which
some excellent shots were made, especially
by Gorman. One string of ten, equaling
33, beat the best run on the coast, the in
dividual shots being 4, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1,2, 8,
4. The scores of the whole were: Pane
56,56,45,36,65; total 258. Young. 66, 64,
62, 62, 65; total 319. Gorman, 53, 61,55, 33,
50; totai 252.
There were not many rifle-shooters on
the range and it was well they stayed away,
for the clouds made the light very poor.
The companies and scores were as follows:

NO TRACE OF RYAN.
The Defaulting Treasurer Continues to
Succennfull y Kvitde the Surety
Company's Detectives.
Ed Morris, proprietor of the Popular
saloon on O'Farrell Btreet, which was
formerly owned by Ryan, the defaulting
treasurer and insurance solicitor, said yes
terday that he had also been victimized to
the extent of $300.
"Mr. Ryan," he said, "has never been a
partner of mine; he merely secured a
lease of this place, but he was really a
figurehead. Last Monday I paid or
rather loaned him $250, because I saw that
he was in trouble. I did not know at the
time that he was a defaulter."
"Are you not a member of the court?"
asked the reporter.
"Yes, but we always trusted Harry, and
we were secured also, you know."
On being interrogated further Mr. Mor
ris said ha believed Ryan was yet in the
Ci; y, volunteering the information that he
thought he was in hiding in the vicinity
of his borne, 537 Minna street.
The executive council of Acme Court
met last night and was disposed to view
Ryan's defalcation with leniency as the
bonds of the Pacific Surety Company
would cover all losses.
The detectives employed by the Pacific
Surety Company have not as vet been able
to lind the slightest trace of Ryan. His
former residence, 537 Minna street, is
closely watched, because of a report that
the double defaulter was in hiding in the
neighborhood.
Tiie exact amount of money secured by
the solicitor and treasurer is not definitely
known. Acme Court is out at least $500,
witn every probability that the sura wili
be materially increased when all the out
standing bills are in.
His partner in the Popular saloon, 131
O'Farrell street, is also out a similar sum.
Brown, Craie & Co. have not yet figured
up their losses, but enough was discoveied
yesterday to show that Ryan got away
with at least $1000. There are still a score
or more of outstanding policies yet to be
looked after.
It is said that Ryan borrowed money
wherever he could, his personal friends
being the ones to suffer most. "When
these obligations are considered tne absent
treasurer's debts will not fall far short of
$8000.
.Up to a year ago Ryan took an active
part in politics, making a lively fight at
that time for the Republican nomination
for Supervisor of the Eleventh District.
REASON AND RELIGION.
The Fastor of the- West Side Church
Talks on This Interesting
Theme.
Rev. W. A. Gardner, pastor of the West
Side Church, preached on "Reason and
Religion" last night. Among other thingi
he said :
"There are a great many people who are
too proud to say they are religious. When
asked the question they will say: 'Me re
ligious? No; I am a man of common
sense. I have too much reason to be re
ligious-reason and common sense do not
go together.' Now, there are thousands
of people in San Francisco who think this
very way. There are many religions, some
of which I do not think are reasonable.
Of them I will not speak to-night."
The speaker then recited several in
stances which had come under his observa
tion where people became disgusted with
religion because some person or persons of
their acquaintance had shown themselves
to be hypocrites. He contended with
those who came witn such complaints
that it was not Christ's religion, but mere
ly the particular beiief of one person.
Yesterday marked the third anniver
sary of Rev. Mr. Gardner's pastorate of
the West Side Church. The society was
organized four years ago and for twelve
months held irregular services in a build
ing on Post street. At the end' of that
time the present edifice on Bush Btreet
near Devisadt>ro was erected. Under Mr.
Gardner's guidance the church has grown
in every way. A new and more commodi
ous building is contemplated.

After the cafe noir had been brought on
Grand President Wolfe assumed tne duties
of toastmaster and offered a number that
were responded to. J. Greenbaum read
telegrams of regret from ex-Grand Presi
dent Abram Jones, who was detained in
Oakland ; and from J. L. Franfclin.who was
in Coronado, but each wished the ex
treasurer godspeed and a pleasant voy
age. After a few remarks by the toast
master, Dr. Voorsanger said that he hardly
thought it necessary to say anything, as
the good wishes baa been expressed by the
presence of the friends of Mr. Platshek
and tha,t carried with it the conviction of
sincerity, which he thought was of more
value than the medicine of physicians
given for the restoration of health. He
spoke of the affection of the son, who goes
with his father on the journey, and said
that such affection as the son has shown
for the father is a good omen. He con
cluded with "God bless you, and may he
watch and care for you and restore you to
us soon sound in health."
Other sneakers were: D. S. Hirshberg,
I. Harris, M. P. Stein, Joseph Rothschild,

ing expressed his heartfelt appreciation of
the compliment paid him, and promised
on his return to work for the best interest
of the order as he had done in the pant.
Mr. Platsbek is held in high esteem by
all who know him, and particularly so by
those who have been in close communion
with him in the charitable work of the
order of which he is an honored mem

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
A Large List of Auction Sales
Announced for This
Month.
TIO3 EECOED FOE THE WEEK.
Notable Increase in Amount of Build
ing Contracts Fi'ed in
April.
The real estate market during the month of
April was not as active as in March. If the
weather is favorable this month there will
probably be some increase in the volume of
business. The unsettled weather that has
prevailed for the past two weeks or more has
hurt business to a considerable extent.
FARM MORTGAGES HELD BY SAVINGS BANKS.
Thomas Magee & Sons' Real Estate Circular
issued the Ist of May contains the following
timely article on the subject of farm mort
gages held by savings banks'.
Recent articles In the dally papers are calcu
lated to give the public the impression that
the owners of the farming lands In the agri
cultural counties of the Slate are generally
weighted down with mortgages beyond hope
of extrication; also that the savings banks of
the City have loaned imprudently on such
lands, and that their value has fallen co much
that the security is no longer good.
These Ideas will be dissipated by examina
tion of the following tables, collated from the
report of the State Board of Equalization for
the year 1894 (latest issue) and the report of
the Bank Commissioners for last July.
We have not space for a showing in detail
for all the agricultural counties; hence we se
lect seven counties as typical, where the mort
gage indebtedness is the largest. Four of these
counties are in the San Joaquin Valley, two in
the Sacramento Valley and one on the coast:

In no one of tne counties is real estate as
sessed for more than two-thirds of its value.
It follows, therefore,- that the last percentage
given may be reduced one-third.
The second table shows the total mortgages
held by the savines banks of this City in the
seven counties named, with the assessed value
of the security, the real value of the security,
the percentage of mortgages to assessed value

The total loans of our City say ings banks se
cured by mortgages and trust deeds on all
California real estate, city and country alike,
aggregate $72,402,152. From this sum there
is to be deducted loans on city real estate, to
wit: San Francisco, all; Alameda County,
two-thirds; Los Angeles, one-half, and the re
mainder of the counties one-tenth, the aggre
gate being $48,449,248. This will leave $23,
-952,904 as the total amount loaned on country
lands in this State, the seven counties above
named included; but it is to be remembered
that a very considerable percentage of this re
mainder is secured upon lands in the Bay
counties, where there has been but little de
preciation in values, and there can be but
small question there as to abundance of se
curity. The savingÃ banks carrying loans as
above have assets amounting to $113,657,469.
That some country mortgages inadequately
secured are held by the City banks is beyond
question, but that is the case everywhere, par
ticularly where there bat been a general de
preciation of values. Not every savings bank
loan on San Francisco real estate is to-day well
secured. The margins on country loans have
always been much larger than what has been
demanded in the City, hence they will stand a
larger percentage of depreciation without loss,
and it is a question to-day whether the City
loans of the savings banks average better as to
security than those on farm properties.
The realty of the State of California is
assessed as follows: Land. $715,383,880; im
provements, $244,814,073; total, $960,197,
-953. The mortgages thereon amount to a
total of $218,714,706, or only one-fifth of the
assessed, which is at least 33 per cent be'.ow
the real value. In a footnote the Board of
Equalization says:
''The value of the mortgages in 1894 is 68.27
per cent of the assessed value of the property
mortgaged. The total amount of real estate
and improvements is burdened with mortgages
to the extent of 21 .89 per cent."
There is not, we beiieve, a growing State in
the Union to-day less encumbered by debt.
The need of immense sums of money for de
velopment in this great undeveloped State is a
vital, a pressing, a crying one. The savings
banks of the City, by partially supplying this
need, have made orchards, vineyards, irriga
tion projects and general development possi
ble to an enormous extent, thereby increasing
the wealth of the State three to ten dollars for
every dollar they loaned.
In return for this great work, exercised with
as great care and discretion as it was possible
to adopt, do-nothings here â barnacles on the
â hip oi progressâ have criea out that the work
was an unsafe one and the securities bad. If
that is so, San Francisco, which depends on
State progress, will go down in the general
wreck.
The small percentage of mortgage debt to
total value of real estate will be a surprise to
those who have jumped to the conclusiou that
the State is bankrupt. It may be safely as
serted that the people of California have rela
tively the smallest mortgage debt of any State
in the Union.

Royal Arcanum.
The long-deferred disrnssion on reduction of de
gree fee was before Argonaut Council las: HMrttng,
It was deemed advisable by some of the members to
lower the fee in order to meet competition, but oh
general discussion It was very successfully argued
that the present Initiation fee had been high
enough to protect the council from the abuses
prevalent in other orders and had insured thus far
a quality of membership at once desirable and
self-sustaining, and as the muior portion of the
members are believers in high protective measures
tliey won me day.

IN HONOR OF THE DEAD.
Two Handsome and Costly Memorial
Wlnrtowi Placed in Old St.
Mary'a Church.
Two handsome and costly memorial win
dows have been placed in the chancel of
old St. Mary's Church on California street.
They are magnificent, and the treatment
of both subjects, namely, the conversion
of St. I'aul while on the road to DamaÃcus,
as a persecutor, and his subsequent visit
to Athens, have created much flatterine
commendation.
Mr. Bronchard, the artist, may well be
proud of his work, as the execution is
superior to anything yet done in Califor
nia, and compares favorably with work on
a similar scale that has been brought hwe
from New York or Europe.
One of these windows is the gift of James
D. Phelan, dedicated by him to the mem
ory of his father. The other is presented
by Prank J. Sullivan in memory of his
mother, whose remains rest beneath the
church. The property on which the church
stands was originally owned by John Sul
livan, father or Frank J. Sullivan, and was
given by him in 1854 to the Catholic church
of Pan Francisco. It is, therefore, a fitting
testimonial, that one of the first memorial
windows erected in this church should be
dedicated to the memory of the woman
who was the wife and the mother, respect
ively, of two of the most generous sup
porters of the church.
Other windows will be set in place in
the near future, and it is the intention of
the artist to have them represent church
history in order, from the time of the
apostles down to the present time.
A canonized saint, distinguished by
missionary zeal, will be commemorated
by some distinctive scene in each window,
and in the porch will be portrait windows
of Father .lunipero Serra. the founder of
the California church, and Archbishop
Alemany, the rirst Bishop of this State.
The Paulist Fathers purpose, now that
the interior decorating is completed and
the windows will soon be in place, to re
paint the exterior of the building, all of
which will, when finished, make old St.
Mary's one of the handsomest edifices in
the City. Byron J. Clinch is the architect.

Kxplanation.
The arrow flies with tbe wind. Tbe top figures
at station Indicate maximum temperature for tbe
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twel%-e hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pre-isure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hteh" means high tarometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rams.
"Lows" usually flrs't appear on the Washington
roast- When the pressure is high in tho Interior
ana low alow; the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. I'he reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

Why the Fabiola Fete Will
Henceforth be a Free and
General Fiesta.
GEORGE HATTON'S FIRST SUIT.
Alameda County Ladies Have Shown
Enough Diplouacy to Insure
Them the Ballot.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
SOB Broadway, May 3. f
The day of- Fabiola fetes is past, and in
future years the great Mayday fiesta will
not be given for charity, but for the gen
eral purpose of exploiting the city and of
brineing large crowds to Oakland. The
result is but natural. To be a great suc
cess the masses must attend, and the
mass of the people cannot afford to pay
star theater prices for the privilege of
viewing the floral parade. Last week's
fete, although it will leave a surplus, can
not but be regarded as a partial- failure.
The balance will probably be less than
11000, and this is a sum altogether too in
significant when compared with the time
and services of the many able and generous
men and women who labored for weeks.
The weather had something to do with
the result, but for the past month it has
been noticed that the general interest in
the affair was not one-tenth of what it
was last year. An invitation sent to every
merchant in town asking them to decorate
tneir stores and make the town look at
tractive did not meet with a single re
sponse. The argument was made that no
benefit would be received and that busi
ness did not justify it.
With the promise of the fete association
that next year's liesta will be free and will
take place on the streets of the city, inter
est will be increased a thousand fold, and
instead of a small- and exclusive proces
sion at the park a pageant will be arranged
that will rival tha: of Los Angeles and
pack the city with people, which will be
an inducement to merchants to make gay
their stores.
Another reason for the smallness of the
iste was that it was whispered to death.
Since last year'-s show the hospital for
whose benefit it was given has been made
the headquarters of the railroad hospital
work and ho words are necessary at "this
time to explain that the addition to its
sphere did not increase its popularity.
Still another reason can be found to ex
plain why "all Oakland" did not go in to
make it a success. Social, political and
religious lines are all drawn too tightly in
this city to permit of any general celebra
tion fofa,ny institution necessarily so ex
clusive as a semi-private hospital n-ust be.
All these things figured on Mayday and
the result was seen at the park. "Oakland
ers take far too much pride to allow
Fabiola to want, but it has been clearly
proved that the annual liesta must be a
thing of all the people and for all the peo
ple to insure the success it deserves.
George Hatton, the local newspaper
man, lias been missing for about a year.
He was never absent from his desk during
the day time, but as soon as his last edition
was out of the way George was no more to
his friends. Speculation was rife and he
was suspected at different times of being
interested- in some of the many midnisrht
depredations tnat have been committed in
Oakland. It was more than suspected
that he Knew more about the boy burglars
than lie allowed to escape his blue pencil.
Then it was mentioned that he had cap
tured a San Francisco heiress and was
vreparing to astonish the social world with
the announcement of a notable engage
ment. This idea was popular, for it con
veyed a vision of a certain farewell bache
lors' banquet, and such events in these
depressed times are devoutly to be wished
for.
But George was not doing anything of
the kind. He was doing his best to win a
bet from his bosom- friend. Colonel Tom
Garrity. Tom and Hatton made a wager
a year ago that the newspaper man could
not apply himself to anything that would
keep him in his rooms in the evening.
Garrjty bet his friend could not stop at
home. George bet that be could. Garrity
suggested the study of law, but the sug
gestion was one of t>ure sarcasm.
"Done!" crjed Hatton, and hands were
clasped at 20 to 1.
La9t Friday tius secret came out. Hatton
was seen on the street with his friend, the
colonel, and the next morning among the
names of those entitled to parchments
from the Supreme Court was that of
George F. Hatton. It was the first time
Georee ever kept a secret, and he could not
have done it had he not kept at home.
Now Garrity refuses to pay the bet, and
Attorney Hatton's first case will be to sue
his brother attorney for that twenty. For
the first time in rive years the two friends
occupied different pews at church this
morning. -
If all tbe counties in California were like
Alameda the women would have the
suffrage after next November. For sev
eral years there has been a marked in
crease of the desire to let women have
their own way, and already many have
figured prominently in movements re
quiring great skill. There are a few ladies,
however, who do the cause more harm
than good. They are forever making
themselves objectionable to the male half
of the community and have not judgment
enough to seÂ« it. They stand on street
corners and make wide their phylacteries,
but they are in the great minority. They
may De irutnfully compared with the
"long-haired" element among the Popu
lists which was so thoroughly overpow
ered by the conservative, youthful and dig
nified element at the recent county con
vention.
Among the ladies of brains and char
acter who have commanded tiie respect of
their brethren are many who are capable
of showing more discrimination at the
polls than the majority of men. They
dominate the Political Equality Society
of Alame-da County, the Ebell Society, the
Women's riuffrage clubs and similar or
ganizations and are as powerful in the
home as in the public sphere. During the
past few months careful inquiry has im
pressed the husbands of these ladies with
the justness of their cause. Therein lies
at once their power and tbe secret of their
probable success. Every converted hus
band at once becomes an active suffrage
evangelist and the ladies are nearer their
coal than they think. Diplomacy that
can win over a husband can be trusted
with the ballot.
Tbe First Congregational Church is still
without a pastor, and Rev. C. E. Jefferson
is back in Massachusetts telling of his
pleasant trip to California. Although
tendered a call, after he had preached two
Sundays there were many who hoped he
would not accept. He is not a brainy man,
and his discourses were very ordinary
p. ft airs. He impressed the leaders of the
congregation with the many things that
are necessary for "a modern church" and
talked a great deal about church govern
ment and kindred topics, but scores of Dr.
McLean's mipils at the Congregational
College could discount the Eastern man in
every direction. The call was extended,
as much as anything, because there was a
vacancy to be filled, and the congregation
preferred to close the gap. The probation
ary pastor felt this and concluded to stay
where he is. Far better men than Mr.
Jefferson will come to Oakland for the
magnificent salary offered. B, W. B.

THE COMMON PEOPLE.
Key. E. Davis I'm ache* Again at the
Quibbling and Back-Biting
of Sects.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 3.â Rev. Ed
wards Davis, minister of the Central
Christian Church, preached to-night on
the theme, "The Common Teople Heard
Him Gladly."
The speaker said: "The term common
people in this instance implies the equiva
lent of an immense throng. In the tem
ple had gathered the populace. The Sad
duceea had questioned Jesus about the
possibility of the resurrection, and the
scribes were inquiring about the command-
I ments. Direct replies baffled their skepti-
c al misgivings. Undismayed the Master
continued bis condemnation of hypocrisy.
: extortion, otticiou?ness, formalities. And
j the common people heard him gladly.
"The populace always enjoys the expos
j ure and arraignment of its oppressors, in
i church or State. But the condemnation
| did not cause repentance, and consequently
I humility, simplicity and sincerity. The
I Sadduct-es. scribes and Pharisees still in
trude their agnosticisim, literalism and
formalities on the doers of the Word.
Theology is not religion, nor is church
membership the shibboleth of salvation.
Christendom to-day needs a reiteration of
Christ's denunciations. And the common
people will bear them with the same ap
proval as in that olden day.
"Jesus SDoke not as the scribes, but with
authority, because he spoke th* truth. If
the minister of God preach the word his
voice will reverberate with the power of
liberated speech, and, sustained" by the
resonance of the universe, the hearer wiil
be inspired with confidence. Conviction
and action are a consequence. So long as
the gospel shall depend on the require
ment of remuneration the tinkling of coins
will be heard in the silence between sen
tences. So long as tne hearer of the gos
pel must pay for his pew as he would for a
Beat in the theater churches will not be
considered houses of God. So long as
there shall be propounded quibbling ques
tions, and the bickering of backbiting, and
the unchristian competition of sectarian
churches, there shall be the necessity of
Christ's condemnation. And from whom
soever that shall come the people of the
commonality will hear that gospel gladly."
ELEVENTH AMENDMENT.
How "The Call's" Declaration
for Suffrage Is Viewed in
Alameda.
Electric Light Demurrer to Be Over
rulei by Judg? Frick â Dr. Zeyn
Seriously 111.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 3.â There is but
one opinion current here to-day among
the ladies, and that is that, with the open
and avowed support of The Call, the
eleventh amendment in favor of woman
suffrage must carry next November.
A eentleman who is a prominent advo
cate of the measure, in talking about the
matter this morning, said:
"The Call has cast its bread upon the
waters, and it will return to it in niany
v.aj's undreamed of in the near future. I
am glad of if. It means the passing of the
eieventh amendment now. I know there
are over 100,000 more males than females
in the State between the ages of 21 and 54,
but what does that matter? Because tl:ey
are the majority it does not give them the
right to deny women a vote or to say that
because women are in a minority they are
bound to be 'turned down' when they do
vote. That 13 like the arguments used
about unsexing women, breaking up the
home, ousting men from their rightful
work, destroying the halo of purity that
always surrounds a woman by giving her a
vote.
"It's all poppycock. Why, the very
women who are contending "for their en
franchisement are tne best women in our
State. They are the mothers with experi
ence, with home life, with good surround
ings, with good husbands. It is not for
selfish aggrandizement they are contend
ing, nor for more luxuries and comforts.
They have all they want and have nothing
material io pain by the passing of the
amendment. They are battling simply for
the lower strata â the submerged tenth if
you will â and those who come after them.
"What have we men done? We don't
want to work any more than woman wants
to work. But we've got to. And we don't
want our women to work, but they must
if they would live. Our attempts at legis
lating for the greatest pood for the great
est number have given us a Huntington, a
Buckley, several incarnated Bacchuses and
I don't know how many lunatic asylums
and poorhouses. Women can't do worse.
I've a great idea they will help us to do
better.
"Anyway whether the good they may
do in the future is problematical or not as
a matter of equity all women who pay
taxes direct or indirect are entitled to vote.
They will get it, too, and The Call will
not regret the day when it advocated the
rights of woman."

THE SAN FEAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896
FUNERALS OF PIONEERS,
Many Pay Their Final Respects
to W. A. Holcomb and A.
K. P. Harmon.
EULOGY BY REV. DR. COYLE.
A Life-Time Friend of Mr. Harmon's
Conducts the Services at His
Late Home.
Oakland Office Ban Fbanctsco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 3. )
Two pioneers, well known throughout
California, were buried in Mountain View
Cemetery this afternoon.
At the First Presbyterian Church many
friends of William A. Holcomb, late presi
dent of the San Francisco Produce Ex
change and call board, gathered to pay
their final respects to the departed mer
chant. Many came over from San Fran
cisco, and the large church was well filled
when the cortege passed down the aisle.
It was an interesting gathering. Many
snowy-headed men were there who had
doubtless thought that their call would
have come before that of Mr. Holcomb.
Pioneers were prominent in all parts of
the church, and as, under the inexorable
laws of nature, their ranks must be
thinned with increasing rapidity, they
listened with rapt attention to the re
marks of Rev. Dr. Coyle.
The members of the family were not
numerous, but the friends were, and after
the casset had been placed before the
choir the male quartet softly sang a
funeral hymn.
Dr. Coyle delivered a short eulogy. "The
pioneers of California are rapidly passing
from us," he said. "While we are gatuered
here to pay our final respects to Mr. Hol
comb auother assemblage is doing the
same over the remains of Mr. Harmon. I
knew Mr. Holcomb in life and met him
several years ago when I became pastor of
this church. Of his public lile and his tri
umph over difficulties you have all read.
But of his home lite and his private life
nothing has been said. He was one of the
most generous men in the community,
and on some days a score of unfortunates
would go to his modest home and not one
would go away empty handed. He told
me a lew days ago, when he believed he
was going to recover, that if it was God's
will he was ready to die. It was God's
will and he has gone to his reward and
re>t."
The interment at the cemetery was pri
vate. Tne honorary pall-bearers were se
lected from the Merchants' Exchange,
Produce Exchange and Chambf r of Com
merce, all of San Francisco.
A. K. P. Harmon's Funeral.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 3.â The remains
of A. K. P. Harmon, the deceased capital
ist and pioneer, were interred this after
noon in Mountain View Cemetery, of
which corporation the deceased was pres
ident. The funeral services were held at
the late residence of the deceased, on Web
ster street.
Dr. W. C. Bartlett conducted the ser
vices, having known the deceased iuti
mately for many year?. His address was
of a very personal and touching nature.
The honorary pall- bearers were selected
from the Cemetery Association and the
various institutions of which he was a di
rector.
The main entrance to the cemetery
grounds were draped in black and the
whole board of directors attended the ob
sequies.

May Not Go East.
OAKLAND, Cal., May S.â The big
field day yesterday at Central Park, which
was given as a benefit to the University of
California Eastern Athletic team, did not
prove to be as great a financial success as
was anticipated. As a consequence it now
appears to be extremely doubtful whether
the original plans for the proposed East
j crn tour will be consummated in their
| entirety. In fact it is not probable from
the present outloo* that more than six
men will go East, and that those who do ro
will only be able to contest in the Western
intercollegiate and in the Mott-Haven
games, on account of the lack of finances
to transport them further on their out
lined itinerary.
The total net receipts from yesterday's
games will not aggregate f 1000 according
to the statement of the manager, and from
other sources the total amount will not ex
ceed $250, making a grand total of about
11250.
It is generally conceded that the six men
who will go across the continent, provid
ing Torrey finds it possible to leave, will
be Merwin, Edgren, Koch, Torrey, Lloyd
and Crafts. A meeting will be held to
morrow amons the athletes, when more
definite plans as to the Eastern trip will be
decided upon.

PRAYER FOR HIS RETURN,
George Atkinson's Disappearance
Agitates Oakland Congre
gations.
WAS A THEOLOGICAL STTTDEHT.
Was Last Seen Tuesday, and Foul
Play or a Romance Is
Suspected.
Oakland Office sa* Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 3. J
George Ernest Atkinson, president of
the Christian Endeavor Union of the
Market-street Congregational Church, is
missing. To-night Rev. E. C. Chapman
gave notice of it and praynd that the presi
dent might soon be restored to them.
The missing young man is a student at
the theological seminary and Dr. McLean
has done all in his power to trace him, but
with no result. Last Tuesday he left his
rooms and no one has seen him since.
There are good reasons for suspecting
foul play. There is also some ground for
presuming that Atkinson has gone off to
sea' to drown his sorrow, because a young
lady to whom he was engaged refused to
longer regard herself as his affianced.
This was a sore blow to him, and he has
frequently threatened that he wonld run
off to sea.
Atkinson is the son of W. H. Atkinson
of Forest Grove, Or., and inquiry has
been made at bis home, but nothing has
been learned. He was a very earnest
student and a popular leader of the Chris
tian Endeavorers. Two months ago he
was elected president of the Market
street Union, and nnder his presidency
the union was making marked progress.
Dr. E. C. Chapman, pastor of the church
to which young Atkinson is attached, is
of the belief that the missing man has
met with foul play. A short time ago he
received a snug sum of money from home
with which to carry himself through the
summer. This money has not been found
in his room, and no one knows what has
become of it. By the manner in which
Atkinson left the college it is not thought
that he intended to make a journey, as he
went off in a working suit of clothes and
a tennis cap. His best clothes are in his
room and there is not the slightest indi
cation that he had prepared for a journey.
Last Tuesday Atkinson was seen in the
Western Union Telegraph office on Broad
way, bat since then no one has seen him.
The object of his visit was to see a young
lady operator who is a member of the En
deavor Union of the Market-street Church.
She stated to-nigbt that she had not seen
Atkinson and had not the remotest idea
where he was. Thers was nothing un
usual about his manner while in the tele
graph office, but since he left tbere noth
ing whatever is known of him.
The missing student was to have been
at Loomis, Placer County, to preach to
day and for several weeks, and it was
thought he might have beÂ»n there. A tele
gram, however, proved that he had not
been heard from, and inquiries in other
directions also failed to bring any tidings
"I think Atkinson has either run off to
sea or else he has met with foul play,"
said Dr. Chapman to-night. "I do not
think for a moment that he has committed
suicide, as he was not a young man likely
to do any such thing. He was 25 year's
old and particularly hright and promising.
He went to the theological seminary about
a year, and made rapid progress. He has
never been missing before, and if he has
not met with fcul play I fear he has car
ried out a scheme that I'm told he often
spoke about and has gone to sea. Various
reasons have been given for his desire to
rush off to sea, but none of them seem to
justify me in thinking he has carried it
out."
An intimate acquaintance of Atkinson's
has a theory about his disappearance that
does not seem at all improbable. " I
think," said he, "he has gone to sea
rather than face the ordeal of preaching.
It is a pronounced case of stage fright."
Revs. Drs. Chapman and McLean kept
the fact of Atkinson's disappearance a
secret till this evening, but tuey con
sidered it their duty as he did not return
to notify the police and to refer to the
matter from the pulpit.
Fishermen predict there will be no high
water in the Columbia this year, and an
ticipate a poor fishing season in conse
quence.

BROWN DID NOT PREACH.
A Big Crowd Waits Patiently
for an Event Previously
Called Off.
Deacon Morse Is Censured for Not
Securing a Regular Minister
for the Occasion.
For probably the first time in the his
tory of the First Congregational Church
every door leading into that sacred edifice
remained closed yesterday. The fact that
such an unusual thing would occur was
duly advertised, but it did not prevent
nearly half a thousand of the curious
minded from gathering in front of the
church when the hour for the morning
service arrived.
There was no one present who seemed
willing to assume the responsibility of tell
ing the people that the doors would not be
opened. Tall, grim but genial Sexton
Pike did not show up, neither aid the
"Oily Gammon" of the retired pastor's fol
lowers. For nearly an hour the people
waited distractedly about and then in
squads of twos and fours went their re
spective ways. \ â  /Â£â ;!-"
Sunday morning Deacon Morse caused
to be inserted in the church notices the
following:
gt^S" FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.
vr<sS Owing to the Illness of Dr. Brown there
will be no services at- this church to-day. Sunday
school and Christian Endeavor services will also
be omitted. .Regular Wednesday evening meeting
as usual. . I. It. MORSE, Senior Deacon.
There are those who contend that Dea
con Morse assumed more power than he
possessed when he caused such a notice to
be published.
"The First Church does not delegate
any such authority to one man," said one
of the dissatisfied members yesterday.
"Besides, whoever heard of 'senior dea
con* in Congregationalism? None of us
can understand this move, but we are in
clined to think there is a 'joker' some
where."
Mrs. Cooper saw many things in the
action of Deacon Morse to condemn. "It
i 3 certainly a very unusual proceeding,"
she said, "when it is remembered that
there was to have been admitted into the
church some twenty-five new members.
Dr. Brown could not, of course, have per
formed the babtismal ceremony, but it
would have been an easy matter to have
secured a minister in good standing. It is

rery, very peculiar and there must be
something behind it."
There are those who think it is the pur
pose of Brown's friends to gather in force at
the Wednesday night meeting, and in some
way re-elect him to the pastorate. Of
course such a proceeding would be entirely
contrary to Congregational usage, but in
view of the tactics assumed by the moder
ator at the last meeting the opposition is
ready to believe anything possible.

First Cm of Umbrella.
5 There can be little desbt that v/han um
brellas first came into use in England they
were carried only by women. Of this we
have the evidence of Guy Miege in his
French Dictionary, 1688, who has the sen
tence: "Umbrellos are only in use amongst
women." "The New World of Words,"
revised, etc, by J. X., Philobibl., 1720, has
the remark, "such as are here commonly
usd by women to shelter them from rain."
Both umbrello and umbrella are given.
Gay has the following allusion: â¢ .
Good housewives all the winter's rage despise,
Defended by the riding hood's disguise;
Or, underneath th' umbrella's oily shads,
Safe thro' the wet on clinking pattens tread.
.Let Persian dames th' umbrella's ribs display,
To guard their beauties from the sunny ray;
Or sweating slaves support the shady load. -
When Eastern monarchs show their state abroad;
Britain In winter only knows its aid.
To guard from chilly show'ra the walking maid.
"Trivia," 1716, book 1, lines 209-18.
For many years the carrying of an um
brella was regarded as effeminate.' In the'
Draper's Dictionary it is stated that when
men began to carry umbrellas they were
hooted and jeered at as "Frenchmen." In
the Female Tatler, December 12, 1709,
there is the following satirical announce
ment: â â¢ -â¢ â * -
The young gentleman borrowing the um
brella belonging to Will's coffee-house, In
Cornhill, of the mistress, is hereby advertised,
that to be dry from head to foot on the like
occasion, he shall be welcome to the maid's
pattens.â Notes and Queries.
Napoleon's Fifth War with Austria.
Ostensibly this war was to be unlike any
other so far waged. The secret instruc
tions given to the Imperial Austrian envoy
in London clearly indicate that the Haps
burgs hoped by victory to restore their in
fluence both in Italy and Germany; for
that was the meaning of '"restitution to
rightful owners" and the "slight rectifica
tion of their frontiers," or, in other words,
the restoration of European conditions to
what they had been before Napoleon's ad
vent. This was the dynastic side; the
national side was also "to be used for its
purposes. "The liberties for Europe hava
taken refuge under your banner," rÂ»n
Charles' proclamation to the army; "your
victories will break their bonds, and your
German brethren still in the enemy's
ranks await their redemption." To the
German world he said, "Austria fights not
only for her own autonomy, but takes the
sword for the independence and national
honor of Germany." Another manifesto,
written by Gentz, the ablest statesman in
Vienna, declared that the war was to be
waged not against France, but against the
system of persistent extension which had
produced such universal disorder in
Europe. â "Life of Napoleon," by Profes
sor Sloane, in the May Century.
A new industry, that of catching snap

MOVING TO THE WATER.
The Naval Battalion Divisions
Change Their Quar- .
ters.
MAKING A GOOD SHIFS CREW.
Plans for Manning the Monitor Co
manche With an Effective Com-
plement of Men.
The two divisions of the Naval Battalion
have gone into the same armory at the
water front and from now on they will be
conducted as a single ship's company.
â¢ Orders were issued by Lieutenant-Com
mander Turner about a week ago that the
divisions must move from their old quar
ters and. into the new before May 1. The
order was given as soon as the armory on
the front had been secured, but, despite
the short notice, the divisions moved in
on time and now they are making them
selves comfortable down by the water.
The new armory is at 22% East street,
about midway between Market and Mis
sion. There are four rooms in the place,
which is on the second story. At the end
of the hall and in the front of the building
is an officers' room, destined to be the
headquarter! of the battalion, and as a
locker-room and sitting-room for its occu
pants. Next to the officers' room is a
large, well-lighted assembly-room, in
tended as a place for the men of both
divisions to sit and meet in. Behind are
two rooms, which will be locker-rooms,
one for each division. They are poorly
lighted, but not intended to be used for
any but locker purposes.
â  The arms and equipments of both di
visions will be sent out on the Comanche,
there to remain permanently. There will
be no guns kept in the armory unless
needed there. The uniforms will be kept
on shore, however, and the furniture of
the division will be divided to fit up the
quarters ashore and on the monitor.
Show drills hc;eafter will be but a sec
ondary consideration. Most of the work
will be done i oat, and seamanship and
gunnery will take up most of the time.
The Hotchk Â»s one-pounder and the Gat
ling, with p.l their gear, are on board the
ship. T'-jy all have cone mounts and will
b . arranged so as to form an effective sec
ondary battery for the "flatiron," as the
monitor has already been nicknamed.
Already a drill for the service of tht
turret-guns is being arranged, and stations
for general quarters, fire quarters and all
ship maneuvers capable of being per
formed on board the Ccmanche are being
written for the officers and petty officers.
Lieutenant-Commander Turner will com
mand the Comanche and Lieutenant
Douglass, as senior lieutenant, will be
executive officer. Lieutenant Gunn, com
mander of the second division, will be
navigating officer, and Lieutenant Guy C.
Calden, .the senior lieutenant, junior
grade, will command the powder division.
The other officers will be gun division and
watch officers, the senior being in com
. mand of the turret.
Coxswains and crews for the Comanche's
boats and for the boats on shore in the
boatnbuse are also being assigned, and
boat work is gome to be a" feature of the
battalion drills. The Comanche carries
four boats, two whaleboats, a gig and a
dingey, and in the boathonse on snore
there are the big 16-oared barge and a
clinker-built gig pulling twelve oars
double bank or six oars single bank. Be
sides these there is the steam launch,
which is now in Oakland Creek awaiting
â¢repairs. Crews will be assigned to all of
these and the fleet will be called out fre
quently.
More interest is being taken in rowing
just at present than at any previous time
since the battalion had any boat to pull an
oar in. There are a number of very good
oarsmen in the battalion, and from either
division a crew for any boat in the fleet,
and fit for any work, could be secured.
The dingey is at present the shore boat
from the monitor. Sue comes to the
Folsom-street float just by the boathouse,
every morning, and the coxswain in charge
of the monitor reports to the lieutenant
commander. There are three men per
manently stationed on board â a coxswain
in charge, and two seamen, one attached
to the fire division and one to the gun
division. Their duties are to keep the ves
sel, the arms, the engines and the batteries
in good order. They" are all enlisted in the
United States navy and are paid by the
United States Government. All are old
seamen who have served for years on
board United States men-of-war.
The Comanche lies too far up the bay
to be seen from the boathouse, but she cau
, be seen from the top of the new armory
building. She may be moved farther
down so that she can be signaled from the
boathouse, but anyway it ia probable that
a signal staff will be erected on the armory,
and when boats are wanted or orders to be
delivered the monitor may be communi
cated with by flag?. It has also been sug
gested that the monitor herself be fur
nished with a military mast, and if such
should be the case communication with
her would be easy.
Hereafter the two divisions in this City
will be looked on as a ship's crew, the
men from one division going to one watch
and the members of theother to the second,
or the men may be assigned by numbers,
the odd to starboard and the even to port,
or vice versa. It has been further sug
gested tnat a crew for the Comanche, one
that will be ready to work her at any time,
will be selected from the most eligible
members of the divisions, and the remain
der of the crew of the divisions will act as
supernumeraries. This crew will be
changed often enougn to give every man
in the divisions a thorough knowledge of
his position.
VINING'S NEW SYSTEM,
Great Inconvenience to the Pub
lic Is the Only Result
Accomplished.
Instead of Watching the Crossings
Police Pass the Time in Chasing
Newsboys.
The transfer agents at Market and Pow
ell streets, aided, by several policemen,
managed to accommodate the crowds yes
terday. The new transfer system was not
as smooth-running as the imported man
ager desired, bat so long as the transfers
were issued the inconvenience to the trav
eling public was a matter of tmall moment.
The agent stationed st the northeast
corner had the work of three men to do.
He complained but once.
"Heavens, this is terrible," he said as he
gave the punch an extra bard push. "It
is enough to turn a man gray. I wouldn't
[punch, punch], if I could avoid it. have
[punch] this job at a hundred [punch] dol
lars a day."
The big policeman by his side smiled,
and then suddenly recollecting what he
was there for abruptly and severely or
dered a 10-year-old lad who asked for a
McAllister-street check to "move on."
But the boy stood his ground. He told
the agent that ne wanted a check for his
transfer, and ne proposed to have it. He
got it, and then deliberately banded it
over to a newsboy. The agent scowled
and the policeman' blustered a bit, but the
"enemy" only smiled. He was oid enough
to understand that all the 'bluecoats and
brass buttons" in Christendom could not
invalidate the check then in his posses
sion.
Over on the opposite corner stood another
agent taking up transfers and disbursing
checks. Surrounding him on all sides,
that is as fast as his legs could carry him,
was a policeman. He chased the" small
boy with evident satisfaction, and on sev
eral occasions made a feint at using the
light cane which he twirled. It has Deen
popularly supposed that the officer on
duty at tnis crossing was placed there for
the one purpose of guaranteeing ladies,
children and feeble men a safe voyage
across the dangerous thoroughfare.
For one hour yesterday afternoon he
did not go any nearer the crossing than
the edge of the sidewalk, but. acting under
the instructions of some one, put in his
time chasing newsboys and such other
small pedestrians as dared to approach
the "agent."
"Say," said an old gentleman, who after
five minutes' struggle had secured a much
coveted check, "suppose I had about 10,000
presents to give away, could I stand here
on the corner and do it?"
"Well, not much," some one in the
crowd answered. "You would be arrested
in about live minutes."
"Then, how is it," continued the old
fellow, "that the Market-street Company
can block np two crossings and have all
the policemen it wants?"

A WEEK OF WEDDINGS
The Despres - Samuel and the
Housman-Jaggi Nup
tials.
A Prominent Mission Engagement
Announced â Ladies Attend a
Rose Tea.
A prominent wedding of the past week
was that of Isaac Despres of Chicago to Miss
Hattie Samuel, one of California's fairest
daughters. The event was one of the hap
piest of the season and took place last
Thursday evening at the residence of the
bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. M. Samuel,
1132 O'Farrell street. The ceremony was
performed by the Rev. Dr. Jacob Nieto in
the presence of about 150 guests.
The bridal canopy was a creation in
green and white. In its construction
were used hundreds of Bermuda iillies,
white pinks, snowballs and otange blos
soms. A large wedding-bell hung from
the center. The decorations of the ball
room were, if possible, more beautiful
than any other part of the house. Pale
green and white bunting draped the walls
and sketches painted for the occasion were
place a like tapestries among the drapery.
The bride, who is a statuesque blonde with
hair the color Titian loved to paint, was
attended by her sister, Mi-s Lelia Samuel, who
acted as the maid of honor. The groom was
attended by his brother, Samuel Despres, who
came expressly from Chicago to act as best
man.
Mr. and Mrs. Despres have left for Monterey,
Coronado, Pasadena and other points in South
ern California, where they expect to remain
for about two weeks, after which they return
to San Francisco prior to their departure for
Chicago, their future home.
Among the guests present at the wedding
were: Mr. and Mrs. Dr. Kieto, Mr. and Mrs.
Adam Heunisch, Mr. and Mrs. P. N. Aaronson,

A very charming wedding was that of
Miss Rose Jaggi and Frederick Housman,
celebrated on Wednesday evening last at the
residence of the bride's parents.
The home was elaborately decorated with
snowballs, orange blossoms and La France
roses. Prominent among all this floral splen
dor was the wedding bell of white snowballs,
under which the happy couple stood during
the ceremony that made them man and wife.
Miss Minnie Platz officiated as bridesmaid and
Christian Karl as best man. An elegant Hip
per was served after the ceremony. Mr. and
Mrs. Housman left Thursday on a wedding
trip to Menlo, and on their return will reside

THE WONDERS OF THE CENTURY.
PROFS. EUGENE AND VAN DE VERE,
1728 MARKET ST.,
Have consolidated their interests in order to bet-
ter handle their constantly increasing business.
The professors during their long residence in san
Francisco have met with unprecedented success.
They could refer you to people all over the world tor
testimonials as to their worth, but it is not neces-
sary . to search the| extremities of the earth
when they can refer you to thousands in your midst
who have been made prosperous and happy
through their wise advice: ask your prosperous
neighbor who started him aright, Investigate and
you will find that your business rival is one of their
many patrons. â  1
â â Nothing succeeds like success." and If you
would be successful call on them without delay: it
costs practically nothing; 60c and $1. 50c and $1,
60? and $1. 60c and $1, 50c and $1 is their price
at present, no more than you would pa)' an un-
known clairvoyant â¢or a partially developed
medium.
Their readings astonish the most skeptical. All
are satisfied. The professors give advice on all
matters that are of Interest to humanity. Busi-
ness, speculation, investment*, insurance, love,
courtship, marriage and divorce;, settle lovers'
quarrels and causes speedy and happy marriages.
1 hey locate mines and buried treasures, find lost
or stolen property, Interpret dreams, care bad
habits and destroy evil influence* in half the
time required by the best of the other mediums.
Remember, there are but tew mediums in the
â¢world that can work these wonders, and none out-
side of the eminent professors in San Francisco.
Remember th" professors' communications come
direct from the Spirit World, hence their Inabil-
ity to be mistaken in any matter.
Remember also that the professors are perma-
nently located in San Francisco: they are here to
stay. Hours 10 a. m. to 8 p. m. Sundays 2 to 6 p. m.

Warm Words of Praise!
From the Veteran
Suffragist.
KER POWERFUL ADDRESS
Mme. Louise Sorbier Likewise
Expresses Her De
light.
OTHEES SWELL THE CHORUS.
Great Numbers Expected at Tc-Day's
Opening Session of the Woman's
Congress.
TtaÂ« Woman's Congress opens Its j
third annual session this morning at
NatlTe Sons' Hall. Women from all
oTer the State will be present and It is
doubtful whether the spacious meeting
place engaged will be able to hold the
army of delegates and sympathizers.
However, those who cannot get in will '
have one connotationâ THE CALL will
keep them well informed regarding all
that may transpire during this great !
convention.
Delighted? That is not the word. The
worn en of the City are actually transported
with joy at The Call's position on the I
woman suffrage question. Yesterday's
edition of the paper had to be reproduced
in order to satisfy the demand for extra
copies which were sent abroad by thous
ands.
"What a grand thing The Call has
done," exclaimed Mrs. Cooper yesterday.
"How many friends it has gained by
simply coming out flat-footed on the side
of justice and right. The very janitor?
who sweep out its offices should be proud
to work for such a paper.
"But," she went on, "I'm not satisfied
with the general run of interviews.
They are not half strong enough as a rule.
I'm going to write something, and I hope
The Call will publish it word for word."
For a few moments nothing was heard
but the scratching of Mrs. Cooper's stub
pen. Then she handed her visitor the fol
lowing written statement of her views on
the matter:
I am neither a prophetess nor the daughter
of a prophetess, yet 1 venture the prediction
that the position taken by The Oallod. the
subject oi woman and woman suffrage will
prove itself one of deep prophetic import. It
was a great mistakeâ a fundamental error
based upon ignorance and injusticeâ to ever
have Introduced to word "male" into the con
stitution â either the Federal or State constitu
tion*. The terms "male" and "female" sim
ply, designate the physical distinction between
the sexes. But there is no sex in mind. Our
constitution was designed to govern Intelli
gent, responsible human beingsâ men and
Three cheers for The Call, and for the just
and righteous position it has taken on this
great question ! It will be proud of It in the
years to come, as we are proud of It to-day.
Yours respectlully, .Sarah B. Cooper."
"Those are my views,' 1 said Mrs. Cooper,
in conclusion. "To-day is not for cut and
dried arguments, but for deep, unbounded
joy. We women have a champion of
whom any cause, however noble, might be
proud, and since only to-day our koignt
has sworn his allegiance it seems that for
a while we should give up talking and re
sign ourselves to the delight wnich so
glad a piece of news brings to us all."
Mme. Louise M. Sorbier, president of
the Women's Educational and Industrial
Union, was no less enthusiastic.
"This latest move of The Call, she said,
"is a grand and wonderful thing. I can
not even picture to my imagination the
magnitude of the results which it will
surely bring about. Another thing I can
not comprehend is the idea which some
good men entertain that the moral sense
of woman will be outraged at the polls.
.lust look at these extracts from Washing*
ton papers which I cut out and saved."
Among the exracts were the following.

which certainly ceem to indicate that a
self-respecting woman need fear no indig
nity at the polls: v
The city election last Monday was for more
reasons than one the most important ever held
in Seattle. The presence of women at the vot
ing-places hhd the effect of preventing the dis
graceful proceedings â  usually seen. It was the
lirst election in the city where the women
could vote, and the lirsl where the gambling
and iiijuor fraternity, which had so long con
trolled the municipal government to an en
ormous extent, suffered defeat.â Seattle Mirror.
The ladies of Dayton were treated respect
fully by all who surrounded the polls, and not
one instance came to our knowledge where,
by word or deed, the crowd forgot the respect
which they owe to the sex. The ladies voted
conscientiously and do not deny that they
made some mistakes, yet we venture the asser
tion that they made less than did a large num
ber of their male friends. With all due re
spect to our feelings in the matter, we must
confess that they did their duty, as they saw
it, in a manner that would put to blush the
average male voter as he usually conducts
himself at municipal elections.â Dayton
Chronicle (opposed).
The ladies turned out en masse on election
day.â Goldendale Sentinel.
They were everywhere fully respected and
their rights were courteously observed by the
great throng which constantly pressed about
the polls. â Seattle Star (opposed).
The result shows thut all parties must put up
good men if they expect to elect them. They
cannot do aa they have in the pastâ nominate
any candidates and elect them by the force of
the party lash.â Olympia Transcript (opposed).
The ladies are out in full force, and the
scene at the polls is, to a stranger, a novel one.
Their presence is, however, having the effect
v uich always goes with the presence of women
â men seem io have more respect for them
selves. So much, at least, is the good wrought
by women's presence at the polls.â Seattle
Daily Chronicle (opposed).
Their presence at the polls worked a charm
in the cause of universal suffrage that gives a .
prestige to be felt on all like occasions. Not a
single quarrel occurred, nor was there dis
turbance of any kind to throw reproach on the
privilege granted by our laws to all citizens
irrespective of sexâ the right to the use ol the
bullot for the purpose of making known their
will.â sprague Herald.
"All these extracts and several more that
I have," continued Mme. Sorbier, "refer
to the city and State elections in LBB4
Now the fact of a woman voting attracts
no attention whatever, As for women be
ing insulted at the polls it is nonsense. I
don't know of any place where a woman
could be more in danger of insult than in
a Barbary Coast saloon at 2 o'clock in the
morning. Yet I have been there and not
been insulted. One night my little girl
had a terrible hemorrhage from the lungs.
1 sought in vain for some ice to stop the
flow of blood. In my extremity I went
out into the street and before 1 knew it
there I was in front of a low saloon. The
sound of cursing and quarreling came
from the inside and for a moment I hesi
tated.
"But my little one's life hung in the
balance. I went into the saloonâ into the
midst of a mass of fijrhtine, swearing
loafersâ and asked for some ice. What a
change came over those rough men ! One
MME. LOUISE SORBIER.
commenced to saw off a piece of ice, an- ]
other prepared apiece of paper, while yet
another sought some string in order that I
it might not be delayed. The barkeeper
refused totafce any money for the ice, and
another man, who seemed to be very
much under the influence of liqnor, stag
gered to the door and held it open as I
left the horrid place. If I am to be treated ]
as well at the polls as I was in this low i
saloon at 2 o'clock in the morning 1 shall
have no complaint to make.
"It is often said that woman's place is
the home. I believe it with all my heart.
Every true woman loves her home. Why,
then should she not have a voice in order j
to protect that home? I lost one dear '
child by reason of the foul sewer which I
opens before this house. In Paris the j
taxes are not to be compared with those
which we have to pay here, yet the French
capital has the best sewerage system in the
world. If woman could vote she would ]
try to have things Kept physically clean at
any rate.
"And then they say that if woman had
the ballot, females of bad character would
vote. I grant that. But for every bad
woman who would cast a ballot five
hundred wives and mothers would vote
after calling upon the divine wisdom for
light and guidance. These are just the
votes that are needed. When voters make
their voting a matter of conscience we
may look for a vast majority of votes on
the right side.
"But I don't care to give my own ideas
when others can speak more to the point.
Just read tnis, if you please," and Mme. Sor
bier took out a document which certainly
looked very official. It was as follows:
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State
of Wyoming : That the possession and exercise
of suffrage by the women in Wyoming for the
past quarter of a century has wrought no
harm and has done great good in many ways;
that it has largely aided in banishing crime,
pauperism and vice from this State, and that
without any violent or oppressive legislation;
that It has secured peaceful and orderly elec
tions, good government and a remarkable de
gree of civilization and public order; and we
point with pride to the fact that after nearly
twenty-live years of woman suffrage not one
county in Wyoming has a poorhouse; that our
jails are almost empty, ana crime, except that
by strangers in the State, almost unknown;
and as the result of experience, we urge ovi-ry
civilized community on the earth to enfran
chise its women without delay.
Eesohed, That an authenticated copy of
these resolutions be forwarded by the Governor
of the State to the Legislature of every
State and Territory in the country,
and to every lejjinlative body in the
world; and that we request the press through
out the civilized world to call the at
tention of their readers to these resolutions.
"These resolutions," explained Mme.
Sarbier, "were unanimously adopted by
the Legislature of Wyoming on the 16th of
February. 1893. In order to make sure
that the thing was not the work of female
legislators, we sent for particulars to the
Governor of Wyoming. He answered by
telegraph as follows:
Adjourned Legislature of Wyoming had
forty-nine members and never had a wuinan.
John E. Osbovtkne, Governor.
"1 think a document like that is enough
to render it unnecessary for us to apolo
gize for the stand which we are taking. It
is just, it is reasonable. What more do
we want? The right will prevail and we
will win the day."
Mrs. J. T. Swift when seen at her home,
824 Valencia street, expressed great de
light at The Call's attitude.
"How this move will help the move
ment!" she exclaimed. "This is the most
encouraging news I have ever heard. To
be sure our cause is a just one; but how
few newspapers are willing to acknowledge
it. The Call has taken the lead. The
other papers will have to follow, or Â«>lse be
left behind in the race. But we can never
forget that The Call has constituted itself
the Woman Suffrage organ, and as such
we must always regard it. The great paper
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 4, 1896.
Susan B. Anthony, the Veteran Leader of the Eqnal Suffragists.
will lose nothing by thus standing up for
the right."
M rs. D. J. Murphy, president of the Lib
erty Suffrage Club, another one of the
women who have long been identified with
the movement for female suffrage, was as
glad at the tidings as were her sisters.
"I must have been born a woman suf
fragist," she said, "and have been suffer
ing from the ailment ever since. I cannot
see any reason why the right of the elec
tive franchise should not be accorded to
women as well as to men. They are bound
to obey the laws, they suffer to the same
extent by the enaction of bad laws aud
profit to the same extent by good ones.
"If we are to have, in the words of the
immortal Lincoln, a 'Government by the
people and for the people,' then suffrage
should be granted to women, and with the
valuable assistance of The Call I predict
that the eleventh amendment to the con
stitution will be adopted. All hail The
Call!"
On December 12, 1895, Secretary of State
A. B. McGaffey wrote as follows:
There has been nothing to regret â there Is
nothing to regretâ in Colorado's experience
with women in politics. On the contrary there
have been many gratifying results. There
have been no startling or revolutionary
changes, but as we study tlie situation "before"
and "after" we see that there has been a
change, and that it has bÂ«?en in every way for
the better. Women generally take quite as
deep an interest and as active a part In politirs
here as do the men, and I think I am safe in
saying that fully as larf?e a percentage of them
go to the polls and vote. Since Colorado has
had universal suffrage there has undoubtedly
been a distinct improvement in the moral tone
of politics. Woman's influence has been felt
as it could not be felt before. Primaries, con
ventions, public- meetings, elections, all have
quietly and almost unconsciously, though
none the less effectively, been molded by Iht
presence â quieter, more orderly, and less liable
to take chances in the nomination of candi
dates unworthy of the fullest confidence of the
people. I trust that the women of California
will be RuccÂ«Â»sful in their effort to secure that
undeniable right of citizenship, "equality
before the law," and I know that if they do
your State will be the better for it.
MISS ANTHONY SPEAKS.
She Pays a Glowing Tribute to " The
Call " for Its Stand Regarding:
Woman Suffrage.
A good-sized congregation greeted Miss
Susan B. Anthony last night at the Afri
can Methodist EDiscopal Zion Church on
Stockton street, near Sacramento. After
the customary devotional exercises the
veteran suffragist ascended the pulpit and
j spoKe lor about an hour.
"This pulpit," commenced Miss An
â  tbony, "was once the place from which
I the great Starr King swayed the minds
I and hearts of men by means of his bril
liant eloquence and noble pietj\ This
grand man I knew in Boston. He was a
1 great battler for eaual rights. How glori
j ously he stood up for the victims of op
â  pression L
"We know that before the war, both in
the North and in the South, the negro had
nothing in life worth living for. How
ever, the attempted secession of the South
ern States forced President Lincoln to free
the slaves as a military measure. He
' himself said that if it were possible to put
1 down the Rebellion without freeing a
single slave, be would not have freed one.
But the slaves were freed at last, and then
came the question as to whether the negro
should vote.
"The fourteenth amendment to the con
stitution originally provided that all citi
zens, whatever their color or race, might
vote. This, however, would admit negro
women to the privilege, or rather the right
of the ballot. The dreadful result was
foreseen, and in order to save the country
from so terrible a calamity the grand pa
triots in Congress assembled, amended the
amendment so as to make it apply only to
' 'male' citizens. Still some of the States
hung fire, and until the passage of the
fifteenth amendment to the constitution
the negro was not free to vote in whatever
part of the Union he might live. The first
time all the colored men of the Republic
were allowed to vote was in tho spring of
1870.
"Thirty years ago I told the colored
women and men of Kansas that the time
was coming when they would have to vote.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESS PROPHESIES.
So far as the black men were concerned
my prophecy came true. Let us hope that
the piophecy I voice to-day may come
true in its entirety. Women of California,
black and white, I tell you you are going
to get the vote here in your own State.
When the day comes use your power
rightly. The black man has proved his
ability to make a right use of ttie elective
' privilege. Can we believe that woman,
black or white, ig inferior to the negro,
only recently let loose from slavery?
â¢'Now I have one petition to present to
I you colored men. I beg you when you
approach the polls at the coming election
to mark your tickets in favor of woman
suffrage.
'â¢You make a good use of your right to
vote; why cannot your wives or your
mothers do the same? It is only just.
MRS. SARAH B. COOPER.
One of the cornerstones of our Republic is
the equality of rights for all the citizens.
The first violation of this principle of
equal rights took the form of denying the
franchise to the poor. The last and only
remaining violation, now that male
negroes can vote, is the unjust discrimina
tion made against women.
"Taxation without representation is
tyranny for women now, as it was for men
in the days of King George. But, thank
heaven, though we have no representation
before the lawmaking tribunals of this
State, we have a representation before the
people; The Call has taken up the mat
ter in earnest and in so magnificent a
fashion that the other papers will have to
follow suit or fall behind. This is a grand
victory for us, and 1 earnestly believe it is
only the glimmering of the dawn before
the glorious rising of the sun of liberty.
"I 1 or thirty years we have worked for
woman suffrage. For thirty years we
have been thrust aside by the Senators of
our country when we have asked for the
vote. This has been a bitter pill for us to
swallow. Still Tub Call has given us a
sweet morsel in order to take away the
bad taste which has remained in our
mouths for over thirty years. But The
Call promises to do yet more, and its
promise will be kept In the most public
and irretractabie manner that grand paper
has espoused our cause. With such an
advocate how can we fail?"
AT THE BIBLE CLASS.
Tribute to '-The Call" for Its Stand
on Suffrage.
Mrs. Cooper during the progress of her
lesson before the bible class yesterday in
Native Sons' Hall was speaking upon the
subject of strength and some of the char
acteristics of strong character. She said :
"For highest results justice and power
must go together. "Whatever is just should
be powerful, and whatever is powerful
should be just. No people can be truly
free who have not learned to be just."
Mrs. Cooper here paid a high tribute to
The Call for its position in regard to
woman, as enunciated iv yesterday's edi
tion. She said:
"This is the only true position. Let
woman be and do whatever she can be and
do! Every thoughtful woman who longs
to be and do her best will not fail to snow
her warm appreciation of this brave stand
taken by The < all.
"There need be no fear that a true
woman will be contaminated by work for
the public good. Tne sunbeam is never
contaminated by the sloughs and miasm
on which it shines. It just lifts up all the
rank dampness and transmutes it into pure
mists and vapors that descend in blessing
on the earth.
"We need to serve others more than we
do, renouncing lives of ease and choosing
lives of service. In this way we should
insure soul-health, and grow into his
image who came not to be ministered unto
but to minister, and to give his life a ran
som for many."

T. Lynch, P. Ross Martin and J. W. Rose.
The alliance decided to give the barbers
its support in the 8 o'clock closing move
ment.
Theodore Lynch of the organizing com
mittee appointed to visit the various
trades unions reported having met with a
favorable reception in most of the unions.
He said that the committeemen's visits to
the different unions convinced them that
a great amount of inactivity and lethargy
exists owing to the fact that labor unions
are not more progressive along economic
and political lines.
The meeting adjourned to meet again
next Sunday evening, when reports will
be received from the organizing commit
tee.
WHITE LOTUS DAY.
Memorial Services by Theosophfstn for
Mme. J'.lavnt Â«ky in Shasta Hall
May 8.
As every society has days set apart for
the honor of its founders or prominent
members, so have the Theosophists. May
8 is White Louis day and will be observed
by members of that body the world over in
honor of Mme. Blavatsky, the great cen
tral sun of the order.
At 8 p. m. memorial services will be held
in Shasta Hall conjointly by the San Fran
cisco, the Oakland and the Alameda Theo
sophic societies.
Mrs. M. M. Thirds, the secretary of the
Pacific Coast Theosophical Committee,
stated that it was a wish expressed by
Mme. Blavatsky, shortly before her death,
that the theosophists of all the world
should meet on the anniversary of her
death and have readings from Sir Edwin
Arnold's "Light of Asia" and from the
Bhagavad-Gita. As to the origin of the
name (white lotus) the lady was in doubt.
The following is the programme for the
occasion:
Piano soio, "Marches Milltaires Nos. 1 and
3" (Schubert), Miss Alice Winant; introductory
remarks. Dr. W. \V. Gamble; solo, "Flower
May Hide IM Lovely Face" (Osgood), Rob
ert Madden; reading, s-lection from the

SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY.
Dr. York Lectures Before a Lara;* Aud
ience at Scottish Hall.
Dr. J. L. York, the liberal lecturer, en
tertained a large audience last night in
Scottish Hall on science, theology and
lelieion with a prelude on "Rome's Hand
in Scndine to Prison the Editor of the A.
P. A. Magazine."
Science, he declared, is derived from the
word scio and means "reading from the
great book of nature the right relation of
things"; and that, according to Draper
and others, is nothing more or less than
organised, arranged and definite knowl
edge of the world. The advantage of sci
entific truth, he said, is that what is true
in science is true everywhere and is true
always.
Theology is the inverse of science, as
the latter depends on demonstration and
the former on faith, the one assuming
nothing and proving everything, the other
assuming everything, but not proving an v
thing. Science he termed the motner of
true civilization and said that any one
with half an eye can see that science and
theology are not one and the same thing.
Those who seek truth are the real students
of divinity and high priests of men, and
no religion is the foster-mother of science,
civilization and liberty. In conclusion he
said that "true religion is simply honesty,
sincerity, benevolence and love to our fel
low-men. Theology is not what men
know, but what men ;believe about God
and salvation."
