RUSSIA'S ARMY.
Nearly a Million Pilgrims Journey
Long Distances to Attend the
Coronation.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 20.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from St.
Petersburg says: To-morrow U the gr^at
day of tr.e solemn entry of the Czar and
Czarina into Moscow. So far their im
perial majesties have been outside of the
city, at the Petrofsky Palace. They have
as yet received no welcome from the city
of Moscow itself.
The morning procession is the popular
one. The coronation ittelf may be more
imposing, br.t so very few see it that in '
the main the people look forward to the !
solemn entry more than to all else.
Of the people, let it be stated, to give an
idea â faint one, even â of their multitude,
that somewhere about 800,000 have come,
some from enormous distances, and by
road to see the sight, thousands of whom i
are content to camp in any open space
available. They venerate the Czar. If
they catch a glimpse of him in the
distance â and there are few of them who
do moreâ they will be perfectly satisfied.
To them the gilt carriages of the pro
cession are of massive gold. To them the
gilt cupolas which rise in their hundreds
of hundreds in this city are of solid gold.
Early to-morrow morning the entire
Tverskaia will be crowded and the people
will meet with saintly patience for de
velopments, with that patience which none
but a true Russian crowd can display.
All toe troops will be out. They will form
one solid line on either side of the
space where the procession is jo pass from
the PetrofÂ«)cy palace to the Kremlin.
For weeks the military have been pour
ing into Moscow, from Warsaw, from St.
Petersburg, etc., whence at one time six
teen extra military trains wese running
daiiy. The troops, roughly speaking,
gathered together at Moscow consist of
eighty-three and a half battalions, thirty
six squadrons of cavalry, seven Cossack
Sotnias, and artillery, with 120 rieldpieces.
In addition to these there are the guard
regiments, which are not counted among
the ordinary troops. These latter include
a section of the special guard of mounted
police, two battalions of the First and Sec
ond divisions, Infantry of the Guard,
which together form a temporary special
division, also three regiments-composed of
the sweral-regiments of -the Third Dmsion
of the Infantry Guard and Â»be reserves of
fbÂ« Â§ card.
It may be added, while on the subject of j
troops, that there has always been shown i
among all divisions of the army i
the greatest desire to be present !
at the cora-nation ceremony, and in
order to satisfy as much as possible
that desire men and officers are drawn
from all the regiments which are within
distance and they arrange it by Jots or
otherwise as to those who shall be present. !
There are advantages fiu*nc4ally which
officers derive from attending the corona
tion.
In addition to the soldiery there are not
It*.? than 63,000 police, an eooÂ»moa9 num

and Warsaw. It may be mentioned that )
this enormous mass of police includes Â»
those of the secret police and the unofficial i
police, the drilled dvornicks, or house

each occasion*.
These are : many reasons wbf bach Â»

large force of police is necessary. Of the
great mass of people in Moscow at the
present time there is not a single mortal
who has not had to show papers and give
some account of his or her presence. This
of itself, when you consider that the town
has quite doubled its population, is a
matter which causes voluminous work.
JEALOUSY AND DESPERATION.
A Chicago Woman Settles a Pending
Divorce Suit by Taking Five Shots
at Her Husband.
CHICAGO, 111.. May 20.-Dr. Thomas
Renn, a prominent phy ? ician. whose home
is at 227 Townsend street, was shot and
dangerou.-ly wounded today by his wife
at Elm and Townsend street?. She lay in
wait for him to come from his office and
after a few words had parsed she drew a
rev iver from her dre-s. She fired two
buliets, both entering the doctor's head.
When he fell the enraged woman fired
; three more shots, one of which pierced the
prostrate husband's leg. Then she ran
and escaped. The couple separated a year
ago and a divorce suit is pending. Mrs.
Renn is accused of being jealous and sus
i picious, while she charges her husband's
family with bringing about the separation,
after the doctor had fallen heir to $35,000
and graduated a year ago. Mrs. Renn had
also been beaten in real estate litigation
following the separation. Each is 25 years
: old.
The doctor's recovery is doubtful.

MRS. MAYBRICK`S CASE
Little Hope of the Unfortunate
Woman Securing a
Pardon.
Queen Victoria Is Prejudiced Against
the Prisoner and Will Not
Extend Clemency.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 20.â A dis
j ratch from London says: The recent ex
! traordinary and unprecedented statement
j made a few nights ago in the House of
j Commons by Home Secretary Ridley to
the effect that Baron Russell, Lord Chief
Justice of all England, had intimated to
him in a recent letter tnat a â¢â¢person"
now undergoing life imprisonment for
murder was innocent and should be re
leasedâthe 'person" in question being
Mrs. Florence May brickâ but that, not
withstanding this representation, he was
satisfied of the woman's guilt and would
refuse to appoint a commits on of inquiry,
ha? had the effect of directing renewed at
tention to this remarkable ca-e.
The situation in a nutshell is that
i Queen Victoria is thoroughly familiar
j with the evidence in the Maybrick case.
j having been furnished at her own request
| with an abstract of the testimony; that
; the evidence showing that Mrs. Maybrick
i had an intrigue with a lover during the
period of her husband's mysterious ill
ness produced a profound impression on
the mind of the Queen, whose views on
domestic morality are so strict that she
will not even allow a woman who has pro
cured a divorce from her husband to be
presented at the court, and that she has
consequently formed a , conclusion un
favorable to the prisoner that will not be
removed in her lifetime.
It is a fact known to those whose official
duties bring them the most close to the
court, tbat Queen Victoria intimated to
Hon Herbert Henry Asquith, who was
Home Secretary of State in Lord Rosebery's
Cabinet, and has since intimated to Sir
Matthew White Ridley,' who occupies the
same position in the present Cabinet, that
under no circumstances would she receive
or consider ony memorial in favor of. the
release of Mrs. M.iybrick or a commuta
tion of her sentence, and in his emphatic
declaration concerning the letter of the
Lord Chief Justice, Sir Matthew Ridley
was but carrying ont the expressed will of
the sovereign. '
BATTLED WITH REBELS.
Thirty Insurgents Alain by a lietach.
tnmt of Japanese. Soldiers.
VICTORIA, B. C, May 20.â News of
fresh trouble between Japanese troops and
Korean insur^erts has been received on
the steamship Empress of India from
China and Japan I It having been
reported that the insurgents were assem
bling at Kirn Ilai Fu a detachment of
Japanese troops stationed not far distant
from that place proceeded on April _'l to
ascertain if there was any truth in the re
port.
At Eight of the Japanese, the rebels,
about eighty strong, opened fire. The
Japanese retaliated, but the insurgents
were re-t-nforted by some 300 more, and it
seemed as if the little party of Japanese
were doomed. Fortunately one of the
soldiers escaped and informed Captain
Tauakos, detached at Eiho. Thirty sol
diers were sent to relieve their comrades.
On the arrival of the re-enforcements the
rebels dispersed, leaving thirty dead be
hind them.
It is still dangerous for Japanese to ap>
proach the coast of Kane Wai Do since
the murder of Japanese in that province,
and 115 fishing-boats have assembled at
Fu San. Rebels at various places in
Chung Chong Do have not dispersed, and
pettce has been temporarily restored.

Sir Hercules Robinson on
the Reformers' Heavy
Sentences.
ONLY A MATTER OF FORM
The Governor Thinks They Will
Not Be Put Into
Effect.
MIXOK OFFENDERS PARrONED.
Short Term 3 Must Be Served by
Some Before Clemency Will
Be Considered.
LONDON, Eng., May 20.â A dispatch
from Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of
Cape Colony, has been received by the
Government, in which it is announced
that the Transvaal authorities have
reached a decision in the cases of fifty-nine
members of the Reform Union, who were
recently convicted in connection with the
conspiracy against the South African Re
pnblie, and were sentenced to imprison
ment, fine and banishment.
A number of these prisoners will be re
leased immediately and others will be
piven their freedom at the expiration of
three mouths, wnile a part of those still
remaining in custody will be allowed to
renew their requests for a cancellation of
their sentences after five months shall
have elarsed, and four of the condemned
men will be given the same privilege at the
end of a year from the date of their sen
tences.
That portion of the jnd^ment of the
court imposing a fine upon the convicted
men will stand, but the banishment clause
will be suspended provided the prisoners
give their word of honor not to interfere
in future in politics of the republic. The
names of the prisoners whose sentences
have thus been reduced are at present
kept secret-
As regards Colonel Frank W. Rhodes,
Lionel Phillips, George Farrar and John
Hays Hammond, the leaders of the Re
form Committee who were condemned to
death for high treason against the Trans
vaal, Governor Robinson's dispatch says
their sentences have b*Â»en commuted to
fifteen years' imprisonment, with a pro
vision for their future commutation. These
cases will be considered by the Executive
Council of the Transvaal next week.
Governor Robinson further states that
he learns that the commutation of the
sentences of the four leaders in the reform
movement to imprisonment for fifteen
years vras merely a matter of form, as it
wa3 necessary to impose euch a sentence
upon the prisoners immediately, and that
the sentence will probably not be put into
effect.
The Government has received the names
of the prisoners whose sentences have
been commuted. The men who are to be
released at once are nine in number.
Among them are the Americans H. J.
King, Captain Mem and Butters. Those
who are to be released after three months
number twenty-four and include F. R
Ingraham, an American. Among eighteen
who are to serve rive months before being
allowed to renew their requests for their
release are the American? V. B. Clement
and J. W. Leonard. The four who are to
sprve a year include Hammond and S. W.
Jameson, brother of Dr. Jameson.

tion can be obtained at the Colonial Office
of the Pretoria dispatch published in the
Times this morning that the Executive

HORROR OF SPANISH RULE
Dr. Diaz and Correspondent Law
rence Tell of Atrocities
in Cuba.
Women and Children Imprisoned as
Sympathizers With the Island
Patriots.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 20.â Dr.
Albert Diaz and Correspondent Frederick
W. Lawrence of the New York Journal and
San Francisco Examiner, who were ex
pelled from Cuba, were before the Foreign
Relations Committee this afternoon. Dr.
Diaz's testimony referred principally to
the atrocity of Spanish rule in the island.
He compared from personal experience the
insurgent and Spanish methods of war
fare, sreatly to the advantage of the
Cubans.
Among other incidents, he mentioned
the long imprisonment of a lady in Havana
whose only offense was being suspected of
sympathy with the irsurrpnt r.ause, and
the liuj : :*onment of children as "rebel
sympathizers." HiÂ« details were in full
accord with hundreds of others about the
results of Spanish war measures in the
island and he begeed Congress, for hu
manity's and civilization's sake, to stop
the existing evils.
NOT A RETALIATORY MEASURE.
Senor De Lome on the Order Prohibiting
lobaeco Exportation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.â Senor
Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish Minister,
declares that the order prohibiting the
export of tobacco from Cuba is misrepre
sented in dispatches attributing it to Gen
eral "Weyler as a retaliatory measure
against insurgent sympathizers in this
country.
He says that it is not apolitical measure
in any sense, but was adopted by the Gov
ernment at Madrid after serious consider
ation to meet an economic necessity; that
the Government for a long time delayed
taking action because of the injury to
commerce, but was driven to the step by
the fact that, without it, over 15,000 cigar
makers in Havana would soon be thrown
out of work for lack of raw material, and
50,000 to 60,000 women and children de
pendent on them would be in danger of
starvation.
The Minister disavows Spanish re
sponsibility for the conditions which have
forced the decree. He says the tobacco
crop has been destroyed by Maceo's forces
during their long stay and numerous raid;
in the western part of the island; that the
royal troops have injured no property, and
that the indiscriminate destruction of the
crop is to be laid wholly at the doors of
the insurgents.
Senor Dupuy de Lome says that Spain
has been frequently importuned for the
past year to stop the tobacco exports,
which gave employment to the chief con
tributors of the insurgents in this country,
but the petitions were steadfastly refused.
He declares that there are as many cigar
makers in Tampa to-day who are loyal to
Spain as there are insurgent supporters,
but that all most suffer alike to avoid
more serious consequences mi Havana.
The prohibition, he contends, is exactly
of the same nature as if the United States
were compelled to stop the exportation of
cereals from this country in time of famine
or great industrial depression. He is in
formed that there is as much Cuban to
bacco now in this country as in Cuba, and
that the hardship here will not be as great
as was at first supposed. At &i,y raw, be
claims, Spain was left uo artrrÃafive in the
matter.

ATTORNEY GALLARDO'3 FIND.
Documents That Will, He Declares,
Establish His Friend's Right
to Millions.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 20.â
; During the recent examination of Judge
â¢ Charles Huso of Santa Barbara, seeking
j release from the San Bernardino Insane
j Asylum, Judge Otis, in passing upon the
evidence, specifically named, among tha
delusions of Judge Huse, the idea that ha
possessed important property interests in
; this and Ventura counties. Attorney
; GaL'ardo's search in the Hall of Records
of this county has already developed some
; important facts, and it seems that the old
! man is in a fair way to establish the
truth of his assertions and the validity of
I his claims in one or more instances.
In 1*44 Pio Pico, then Governor ad in
terim of the State, granted to Jo?e Domin
guez a great tract of land, comprising
seine forty square leagues and taking in
the entire coast valley from Carpenteria to
â¢ the Old Mission and back to the San
' Rafael range, inclosing the whole of what
are now Summerland and Monteoito and a
'. goodly part of Carpenteria, with all the in
: tervening lands.
In 18-51 Congress established a land com
: mission, belore which all such grants
\ should be taken for approval, a time limit
lof three years being set. Dominguez
neglected to present his claim within the
! appointed period, believing that his title
' was perfectly clear, and afterward sold the
; title to Thomas Chabasco, who transferred
it to Felipe Arrellanes. He in 1556 sold
it to Judge Huse, the latter paying its
: fair market value at that time.
Ten years later Congress passed sn act
j continuing to Dominguez the entire claim,
upon Judge Huse's petition. Afterward
: the Surveyor-General of California, Mr.
I Gallardo claims, disregarded this decree
j of a higher power, arbitrarily limited the
j tract to eleven leagues and refused to issue
' a patent for more than thirty-three square
. miles. It is claimed that an appeal to
j Congress must necessarily result in the
I extension of this survey, as there have
i been precedents for su:h a decision.
The eleven leaeues already surveyed and
1 to which Judge Huse's title was confirmed
by the State, were niortga.ed to '.he late
Alexander Montgomery of San Francisco,
I and forecioseJ ; but as the time for their
| lesal redemption passed by while the
! Judge was incarcerated in the asylum, it
j is claimed that the bar against the re
; dempiion after a certain period becomes
inoperative in his case.
Attorney Gallardo has unOiminished
confidence iv the strength of his case and
it bids fair to become one of the most cele
brated in modern litigation. The Monte
i cito property alone is now valued at many
' millions and contains valuable improve
ments, having upon it the costly resi
i dences of such men as R. Radeliffe W.ite
| head, I. K. Waterman, A. B. Ogilvie,
. George Earnscliffe, Charles F. Eaton, P..
Blair Thaw, E. H. Sawyer, Thomas Ma
' gee, the Hayne homestead. Miss Everiys
, beautiful home and countless others.
The attorney scarcely takes into account
the advanced years of the men who are
undertaking to establish the claim to this
valuable property and the enormous re
sistance which will be aroused if it ever
gets either into the courts or into the Na
tional halls of legislation. The most that
could be hoped for would probably be to
establish a shadow upon titles which it
would require a small fee to release.

TGICIO, Japan, May 6.â Competition is
keen among foreign projectors of railways
in Korea. An American syndicate baring
set the example by obtaining a concession
to build a rood from Seoul to Chemulpo â
the most paying route of all â French cap
italists, tacked by Russian influence, are
seeking a similar concession for the line
between Seoul and Gensan, while Japan
ese merchants are Â«. ffering to build a road
from Seoul to Fusan, where t^eir principal
settlement is.
Maritime enterprise attracts much atten
tion in Japan at present. A company has
been formed for the purpose of establish
ing a line of steamers from Japan to
America and B.Uoum, the idea being to
cut into the petroleum- carrying trade.
The importation of kerosene to Japan
now represents a value of 5,000,000 yen
annually in round numbers. Another
company has been organized to run a
service of steamers irom Japan to Port
land. There is talk of amalgamating the
two companies. Their united capital
would be 6,500,000 yen.
The details of the negotiations carried
on in Pekin for China's second loan of 100,
-000,000 taels show that in the end England
and Germany were united against France
and Russia. The loan had been distinctly
promised to England by the Chinese Gov
ernment, but the terms offered by the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, on behalf
of itself, tde Deutsch-A>ia:ische Bank and
a London syndicate headed by the Roths
chilis, were neither liberal nor rirmâ a 5-per
cent loan at a minimum price of 89Vj, the
bank to receive 5 per ivnt commission and
th â  < cinese to reap the full benefit of any
bub>e:iptiun over and above 89} i. Seeing
that the 4-per-cent loan made by Russia
and Japan had been at 92, the Chinese
thought this Anglo-German offer too
dear. But tue bank would make no re
duction. At last negotiations were broken
off, and the Tsung-li Yamen found itself
inundated with proposals from other
quarters, among them being an American
offer of a silver loan in terms of gold at a
fixed ratio.
The most favorable proposal, however,
came from France, backed by Russia, and
it might have been accepted had not the
Emperor and Empress Dowager, despite the
urging of Li Hung Chang, objected to
pledging China raora deeply to France,
and had not the proposal been accom
panied by irksome conditions; for ex
ample, that the control of the customs,
the revenues from which constitute the
security for the loan, thould be placed in
French bands, and that the work oi build
ing railways in the southern provinces of
China should be intrusted to France. At
the eleventh hour, Sir Robert Hart, In
spector-General of Customs, was called in.
He induced the bank to make a firm offer
of a 5 per cent loan at 94, the bank paying
itself out of the subscriptions over and
above the minimum issue price.
German statesmen have not much rea
Â«on to congratulate themselves In con
nection with their doings in the Far East
during the past year. Germany joined
witb France and Russia to recover Liao
tung from Japan, the avowed object of the
combination beir:g to secure the inde
pendence of Korea, menaced, as was al
leged, by a Japanese occupation of the
Liaotung peninsula and of the northern
littoral of the Yellow Sea. The tirst re
sult of the combination was that France
and Russia leagued together, to the ex
clusion of Germany, for the purpose of
procuring the political reversion of China's
estate, the second result was tbat Japan,
being paralyzed for separate action in
Korea, Russia stepped iv and obtained in
the peninsula a footing that certainly
does not strengthen the prospects of its
independence. The third result is that
Germany now finds herself joining hands
with England to combat the political im
portance tbat France and Russia acquired
in China chiefly owing to the co-operation
of Germany herself.
The Korean officials, members of the
recently overthrown Government, who
were for some time under trial for com
plicity in the murder of the Queen, have
been sentenced, one to death, four to exile
for life, and others to exile for terms rang
ing from one to nfteen years. The court
in its judgment states distinctly that the
murder was perpetrated by Japanese.
Now wht-n the Japanese suspects were
under trial at Hiroshima, every effort was
made through the Korean Government to
obtain proof of their guilt. Nevertheless,
they had to be discharged for want of
sufficient evidence Hence the Korean
court's oven assumption of their guilt and
the Korean Government's indorsement of
the finding raise a very delicate question.
Li Pom-chin, the bead and front of the
Government that came into power in
Korea after the flight of the King to the
Russian Legation, has retired from the
leadership of the Cabinet and accepted va
rious sinecures conferred on him by hia
sovereign. Apparently his tenure of office
had ouly one object, revenge upon the po
litical fees of himself and the conservative
party. That accomplished, he does not
care to brave the assassin's sword, by which
every Korean statesman who uses the
sword for bis own purposes is threatened.
The journals of the Opposition in Japan
do not approve the idea of an entente be
tween Russia and Japan for the purpose of
preserving order in Korea. They foresee
that Russia will gradually get the upper
hand and will elbow her ally oat of the
peninsula altogether. But until the de
tails of the understanding are known these
criticisms possess little value.

that charges affectinc his personal con

no such charges have been filed, and con

which he is accredited, which is not yet
fully cleared up Meanwhile Mr. Tirrell

are expressed whether he will return to

the Paris Open-house, weighing nearly
half a ton, fell through the ceiling
into the fourth gallery during
a performance of "Helle" this even

successful la allaying the excitement, and
the building was cleared, the entrances
were closed and an examination into the

MISSING FROM SANTA CRUZ.
Two Boys Start in a Boat for Capitola
While the Bay Is Rough and Do
Not Return.
SANTA CRUZ* Cai~, May 20.â Julien
Newton and Royal March, aged 20 and 17,
respectively, are believed to have been
drowned in the bay at some time since
yesterday morning at 8 o'clock. They
started at that hoar in a rowboat for
Capitola. The distance by water is about
two miles, but the bay was quite choppy
yesterday and a strong wind was blowing.
It is feared that their boat became unman
ageable and was capsized. If that is true
tlie strong undertow would have carried
their bodies to sea.
The boys told their parents before they
started that tney would return in tne
afternoon. Newton is crippled and has a
widowed mother, who grew very anxious
during the night, but hoped in the morn
ing that her boy would return. March's
parents were also uneasy, and together
the two families determined to send out
messages and searchers.
Uky Springer went to Capitola this morn
ing in search of the boys, but found no
trace of them. Neither tbey nor the boat
had been seen. The boat is the property
of John Sherman, and would have been
identitied readily had it put in at Capitola.
Telegraphic communication waa had with
Monterey and other places along the coast.
Nothing, however, had been seen of the
boys or the boat.

he would be shot. The robbers fled at the

TEE DEEP-HARBOR FIGHT.
Both Santa Monica and San Pedro
Omilted in the Conference
Report.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20. -The
Southern California deep-harbor project
will not down. It is the only remaining
matter of dispute in the river and harbor
bill. Senator White last night received
word from a member of the conference
committee that the matter would probably
be settled by allowing the Frye compro
mise amendment to remain in the bill as
it passed the Senate, but this morning the
committee failed to agree on this.
The conferees were (ostensibly) willinjj
to let the item stand as it was, bui
Hooker, Hermann and Patchings, con
ferees on the part of the House, insisted
t hat the board to select a harbor should
be appointed by the conference commit
tee and not by the President, Secretary of
the Nary and Superintendent of the Coast
Survey. They realized, however, that cer
tain Senators were determined and would
have been able to defeat snch a
conference report, so they agreed to rec
ommend to the House of Representatives
that the appropriation for a deep-water
harbor on the Southern California coast
be stricken out entirely, as well as $392,000
for improving the Inner harbor at San
Pedro, as the latter project has nothing
to do with the Santa Monica-San Pedro
harbor controversy.
It is evident that the conferees wish to !
discipline Senator White for his obstinate '
fight against the Santa Monica job, al- j
though Mr. Hooker, in explanation of the
action of the house conferees, said that if !
the board bo be appointed under the pro- â 
visions of the Senate amendment should
select San Pedro, that place would have
two harbors.
Although Hooker, Hermann and Catch
ings appear to be the recalcitrant ones Mr.
Frye is really in favor of repudiating his
own compromise. John Boyd (.Huntinp
ton's man) asserted boldly to-day in the ;
Capitol corridors tljat Frye offered his ;
compromise amendment without consult- j
ing Mr. Huntington. Boyd's indiscreet
utterance shows that he really considers
his master a power to be consulted by
Congressmen before legislating.
The California Congressmen are laugh
ing to-night over poor Boyd's slip of the
tongue. The conference reports will be
called up to-morrow, when White expects
to make another not speech.
Among the chief changes agreed to by
the conference committee were these:
Harbor at Oakland, Cai., cash appropri
ation compromised at $20,000, with con
tracts limited to $6ti6,000.
Harbor at San Diego, Cal., increased
from $40,000 to $50,000.
Harbor at San Luis Obispo, Cal., in
creased from $32,000 to $40,000.
The House appropriation for Port Or
ford, Or., limited to $203,360, stricken out
In the Senate, stands with the proviso
that tbe work is not to be done unless tbe
Secretary of War is satisfied the interests j
of commorce demand such an expenditure.
Entrance to Grays Harbor, Wash., com
promised at $10,000, and a contract limited
to $990,000.
Everett Harbor, Wash., reduced from
$30,000 to $20,000.
Senate's addition of $5000 for survey of
Portland Channel, Alaska, accepted.
Tho contract authoriled by the Benate
for boat railway at The Dalles Rapids, Or.,

icreased to $150,000.

ate substitute authorizing the acceptance
aby the Government of money appropri
ted by California and re-appropriating
the same is agreed to.

FOR FORTIFICATIONS
The Senate Oetttng at the End of the
A ppropriation Hill*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.â The
last but one of the general appropriation
bills â the one which provides for fortifica
tions and other works of defense â occupied
the attention of the Senate to-day and was
passed before adjournment. It carries
nearly $11,000,000â about $5,000,000 more
than it carried when it passed the House.
The principal item of increase is one of
$3,115,000 for gun and mortar batteries.
There was little or no controversy over
any of the provisions contained in the
bill, but a ra'.ner important discussion was
precipitated by an amendment offered to
the bill by Gormaii of Maryland. Ihis
proposes to authorize the issue of $100,000.-
UOO of treasury certificates of indebted
ness, bearing 3 per cent interest, in order
to meet the expenditures called for by the
appropriation biils of the present mail n,

$000,000,000.
The amendment was opposed by Shei
man of Ofiio, who declared that never be
fore had such a proposition been ma:e to
meet the current expenses of the Govern
ment in a time of profound peace, and
who argued that the proper course for the
Senate to pursue was to take up the tariff
bill passed by the House in the early part
of the session, leave off the free-silver
amendment which the Senate had at
tached to it, and then pass it, with such
additions as might be deemed wise, in
cluding a tax on tea and coffee. He said
that he would tear up all the appropria
tion bills rather than make sucti a con
fession of bankruptcy.
Gorman argued that the deficiency in
the treasury could not be met in any other
way than that which he proposed.
At the close of the discussion the
amendmmt was laid on the table by a
vote of 42 to 9.
Earlier in the day* conference report on
the river and harbor Dili was presented by
Frye of Maine, and an effort was made by
him to get immediate action on it. That
waa resisted, however, by Bacon of Geor
gia, who bad learned that the appropria
tion for the harbor at Brunswick, Ga., had
been struck out in conference, and who
wanted time to argue the matter before
the Senate. And so Frye rather reluc
tantly consented to have the report go over
till to-morrow.
The only question that was not settled
in conference is the one relating to the
deep sea harbor in Southern California. In
the preliminary discussion there was some
sharp criticism at the disposition of the
Senators to adjourn Congress without at
tending to the grave and important ques
tions requiring action.
Tbe fortification appropriation bill as it
passed the House appropriated $5,845,837.
As reported from the Senate committee
the amount is $10,763,888, the increase be
ing made up by the.-c items: Gun and
mortar batteries $3,115,000; sites for fortifi
cations and coast defenses, $250,000 ; steel
for eicht 10-inch and one 12-inch guns.
$160,000 ; carriages for satno, $195,000; sieel
for 12-inch mortars, $210,000; carriages for
same, $82,000; payments for guns nnuer
contracts heretofore made, $502,551; ma
chine guns, $35,000; board of ordnance
and fortifications, $50,000; construction

IN STORMY SESSION
Declare for Free Silver in
the Most Radical
Terms.
BOIES TOR PRESIDENT.
"Sound Money" Men Cut No
Figure in the Turbulent ,
Ccnvention.
CLEVELAND'S NAME IS HISSED
Sweeping Reso'ntions AdoptedâDele
gates to Ch:cago Receive Cast
iron Instructions.
DUBUQUE, lowa, Mar 20.â Carrying
out the programme formulated yesterday
by the leaders of the majority element,
the Democratic State Convention to-day
declared for iree silver in the most radical
term;, presented ex-Governor Horace
Boies to the Democracy of the Kation as a
candidate lor tÂ£ie Presidential nomination,
and instructed the delegates-at-large and
the district delegatesâ three of the latter
being adherents of the sound-money doc
trineto rote as a unit.
It was the most turbulent convention in
the history of the party in this State.
Despite the impartiality and fairness of
tne presiding officer selected by the silver
ites, the representatives of tbat element
on the floor were disposed to cive little
quarter to their opponents, and there were
times wher. it looked as though the con
vention would break up in disorder.
The majority report of the committee on
resolutions was barren of any reference to
President Cleveland or his administration,
while the commendation of the chief ex
ecutive attached to the minority report
was voted down by nearly tnree to one.
In a measure, however, this may be taken
as due to the fact that it was appended to !
a sound-money resolution, for it was
noticeable that the caustic comments upon
the administration made by Permanent I
Chairman Carr evoked but a scant applause !
from the silver men, while his declarations
that the financial policy of the administra
tion was'not that of the Democratic party
and that the party had been betrayed by
its chosen leaders were received with chill
inp silence.
Ex-Governor Boies head? the delegation
to Chicago, ana his associates are Sam B.
Evans of Ottuma. Will A. Well! of Elka
der and Lewis T. Genung of Hastings. J
The alternates are Judge A. Van Wagenen
of Woodbury, D. B. Stubbs of Jefferson,
Andrew C. Daily of Marshall and C. H.
Mackey of Sisronrney.
At 10:15 State Chairman C. R. Ranck
called the convention to order in the
Grand Opera-house, and prayer was offered
by Rev. W. R. Benion of the Episcopal
church. 'A.-A- Wrisht of Tipton was then
introduced as temporary chairman.
A: the condition of his address commit
tees on resolutions and credentials were
announced and the convention took a re
cess until 2 p. x.
On reassembling the 'committee on or
ganization submitted the name of E. B.
Carr, editor of the Manchester Democrat,
for permanent chairman, and the nomi
nation was ratified with a shout.
Chairman Carr concluded by reading a
telegram from Minneapolis to tae effect
that the Democrats of the northwest
would elect a free-coinage member of Con
gress.
There were calls for M. H. Nealy of Fort
Dodpe, who defeated ex - Congressman
John F. Dunccmbe for delegate to the
convention, and he responded with a
bitter speech congratulating his hearers
that the time had passed when Federal
oSce-bolders could control Democratic
conventions in lowa.
There was a general demand for ex-Gov
ernor Boies and a committee was in
structed to secure his pretence. Mean-
K while the report of the committee on cre
dentials, seating all the contesting silver
delegations, including the one from Black
hawk to the one headed by Mr. Boies, was
adopted without the formality of a roll
call.
Then the convention proceeded to the
â¢ selection of delegates and alternate! at
larce. Ex-Governor Bo ; was accepted
by acclamation and the sound money mi
nority made its test of strength upon the
second nomination, pitting Judge Walter
I. Babb of Mount Pleasant against 8. B.
Evans of Ottumwa, a free-silver extremist.
The ballot gave Evans MB . to 250% for
his opponent and the gold men gave up
the fight..
The business proper of the convention
having been disposed of ex-Governor Boies
was presented and accorded a tumultous
reception. His remarks were brief and
elicited little enthusiasm. He said that in
the part he had taken in the present trou
ble he had been animated by the sole de
sire to secure for the messes in the State a
representation in the convention. He be
lieved before, as he aid now. that in many
conventions of political parties the voice
of the people had been stifled, and so far
as be was concerned he had been deter
mined that the Democracy of lowa should
speak for itself. It had done so, and he
hoped that from tnis time on they would
B recognize the fact that the strength of the
party rested in the masses.
There was an exodus of delegates sim
ultaneously with the Governor's closing
words and the report of tne committee on
resolution presented by W. L. Reid of
Dcs Moines was listened to with scant at
tention. It read as follows:
The Democracy of lowa, in State Convention
assembled, hereby reaffirms its alleciance to
the time-honored Democratic doctrine of bi
metallism, to tne use of both gold and silver
a* primary money and the coinage of both
at a. ratio without change or limit.
It 'is the judgment of this conven
tion that this doctrine of the National
Democratic party, if fairly and honorably
observed, requires the constant effort of every
loyal Democrat to accomplish the repeal of all
laws heretofore enacted through the instru
mentality of the Republican party which do
in letter and spirit alike discriminate against
eilver and In favor of geld, and the substitu
tion the reform of affirmative legislation
I which shall restore silver to equal rights with
gold in the mints and coinage of the country.
We heartily affirm as a deliberate conviction
of this convention that the act of 1873, in so
far as it demonetized silver and established
cold as the single unit of value. Is a flagrant
A â  .' .anon of one of the most important pro
visions of the constitution of the United
States ; & violation which every political party
ougnt condemn, and every good citizen should
â Mia! la expunging from the statutes of the
Republic. We therefore favor the immediate -
repeal of all laws by which silver was demone- i
tized, and demand its unqualified restoration
to the right or free and unlimited coinage in
the mints of the Nation as a money of fall le
gal tender, and final redemption at the ratio
16 to 1.
We recognize the fact t h at upon this ques
tion the country has reached a crisis that can j
no longer be evaded or postponed. We know j
that the result of this conflict must t>e a return ;
to the money of the Constitution, or the sub
stitution thereior for all time to come of a
standard of values, born of British aristo
cratic greed, which doubles the purchasing
power of. money and reduces by one half the |
price of all the great staples of industry. In j
behalf of the toiling millions of this republic
we welcome the conflict and pledge the Demo- i
cratic party of lowa to stand by the Constitu
tion; to defend the right or to beat back with
all its strength every wrongful aggression of I
the money power of the old and new world j
alike, and to aid to the utmost limit of its abil
ity in restoring to ourselves and our postenty
the sacred heritage of the financial system be- :
queathed to the American people by the fa- i
thers of the republic, and which was equally {
fair and just to all citizens; and in this effort !
we cordially invite the co-operation of all good j
citizens, without reference to political &Â£!:&
-tions in the past.
We hereby enter our most earnest protest !
against all schemes for the retirement of our !
nor.-interest-bearmg National paper currency i
and the substitution therefor of $500,000,000 '
of Interest-bearing bonds to become an addi- |
tional burden upon the producing classes,
that National Banks may be supplied with in- .
terest-bearing capital on which to transact j
their individual business. And we also protest
against the further issuance and sale of j
Government bonds to acquire gold with which
to redeem such currency, and demand of the â¢
Government that it shall hereafter redeem the !
same with the coin of either metal it may pos- i
sess in strict accordance with both the spirit
and the letter of the law.
We denounce as a transparent fallacy the
claim that labor can be benefited by the main
tenance of single gold standard as the basis
of our financial system. The experience of all
ages and o: every country alike clearly de
monstrates that a contracted currency invari
ably compels a contraction of business, the
lessening of industrial enterprises, the enforced
idleness of great numbers of the working
classes, end nothing of which the human mind
can conceive is more clearly self-evident than
the naked truth that the wages of labor must
always be adjusted to and correspond with the
prices of labor's products in the markets.
Earnestly desiring to promote the best In
terests of the laboring people, we favor the ap
pointment of a cabinet official, to be known as
Secretary of Labor, whose duty It shall be, in
all cases of tariff-protected industries, to In
vestigate, ascertain and report to Congress
what share, if any, of the enhanced price for
which protected products are sold in the mar
kets of this country is paid by employers in 'â 
these industries to their employes, and â 
to be clothed with further power i
in all cases - where pnblic inter- !
ests are involved or public peace j
is endangered; to inquire into the merits of
the controversies between employers and em
ployes and recommend the adjustment thereof
upon such terms as to him or arbitrators ap
pointed by him shall seem just, and in case of
the failure of either party to abide by the
recommendation made to report the facts to
Congress or a State Legislature as the case
may require, with recommendation for addi
tional legislation, if such in his judgment be
necessary; and in the discharge of his several
duties to be clothed with further power to
compel the giving of testimony under oath by
parties interested or otherwise, and the pro
duction of all books and papers which in his
judgment are necessary to a full and impartial
determination of the matters committed to
his care.
The deleeates-at-laree and district delegates
appointed by this convention to represent the
State in the National Democratic Convention
to be held in Chicago beginning July 7. 1.896,
are hereby instructed to vote as a unit as the
majority present shall direct on all questions |
coming before said National Convention for
settlement by vote of its delegates, and es
pecially upon ail questions relating to the
adoption of a platform for the party and the
nomination of candidates for President and
Vice-President; and the delegates present in
said convention if less than the whole number
be present and to which the State is entitled,
are hereby authorized to cast the full vote of
the State in accord with these instructions.
Reposing fan faith and confidence in the
Democracy, patriotism and ability of Horace j
Boies, formerly Governor of the State of lowa,
we hereby declare it to be the bounden duty
of every patriot in lowa, without regard to
former party affiliations, to use all honorable
means to secure his nomination at the Deme
crat:c National Convention to be held at
Chicago, July 7, 1896. for the high and re
sponsible office of President of the United
States, to the end that the principle of Jeff er
sonian Democracy be preserved atia promoted
and liberty and prosperity be restored to the
; great body of the American people, and any
delegates to the National Convention this day
elected are especially authorized and In
structed to place his name in nomination at
the Chicago convention.
Interest revived for a Trhile when Judge
Nathaniel French of Davenport submit
ted the report of the minority. The refer
ence to President Cleveland provoked ap
plause, mingled with shouts of *'No,"and
hisses, and the uproar was intensified ten
fold when Judge French went on to flay
the silverites and to assert the financial
planks of the majority report were a mere
straddle, framed in the interest of the
mine-owners. Shouts of â¢â¢buncombe" and
"down with him" almost drowned his
closing utterances.
Judge Van Wagenen made a brief plea
for the . majority report and received a

quiet hearing, but the excitement of the
afternoon reached its climax when the
youthful Mayor Voilmer of Davenport at
tenipte : t i close the debate with a sound
money speech in behalf of the 'banner
Democratic county of tbe State" -
County). The pent up fury burst forth
when he warned the delegates that free
silver meant the death of the Democratic
party and that the wake would be an un
happy afTnir.
Yells, shouts, hisses, catcalls, words
scarcely fitted for ears polite and personal
allusions continued to make a din that
was deafening. Time and again tbe
speaker essayed to continue h;s remarks,
only to encounter a cyclone of opposition.
In vain one free siiver leader after another
pleaded for fair play in the young Mayor's
behalf, and equally futile was the protest
' of the chairman that the good name of
the convention and of the Democratic
party of the State was at stake.
The majority was lost to reason or argu-
I merit, and with the parting warning that
'. the sound- money advocates could not be
: driven out of the party, and that after the
Chicago convention the silver advocates
would be glad to pet under cover and come
\ back to the fold, the Mayor left the piat
| form.
When the roll of counties was called the
minority report was defeated by a vote of
M - to 21*- *Â Tnis was 100 votes short of
the actual strength of the convention, but
no attempt was made to explain the dis
crepancy.
Against protests shouted from all parts
of the hall a motion to indorse tbe district
delegates to Chicago eiected in the Con
gressional convention of the forenoon, and
which was intended to bring them tinder

clared carried. Then there was a rush for
the open, and in the midst of the confu
sion the convention at 6:10 adjourned sine
die.
SOUTH DAKOTA DEMOCRATS.
" sound- Money 3ten" Capture the State
Conreniion.
ABERDEEN. S. Dak., May 20. â To
Chairman James Wooas of the Democratic
State Central Committee must be at
tributed the victory of sound money in
the State Convention. He has been an in
defatigable worker in the cause of gold
and his promise to the National Commit
tee that he would brine South Dakota into
line has been fulf-iied. He controlled the
action of the State Central Committee in
choosing S. A. Kamsey of Woonsocket, an
administration man. as chairman instead
of W. A. Lynch of Huron, and it was his
powerful influence that dominated in the
fight.
On convening of the convention an at
tempt was made to defeat the nominee of
the Central Committee for temporary chair
man, Lynch being nominated by the silver
men. Tbe gold-standard people stood by
Ramsey and elected him over Lynch by a
vote of 240 to 152. After the appointment
of committees the convention adjourned
to 7:30 P. M.
This evening the temporary organiza
tion was made permanent without oppo
sition. Resolutions were adopted indors
ing the administration and declaring for
the present standard. A free-silver sub
stitute was offered, but voted down by a
majority of 57.

South Caroltna Democrat* Strongly in
Favor of bilrer.
COLUMBIA, S. C, May 20.â The advo
cates of tne white metal within the ranks
of the Democracy of South Carolina won
in the State Convention to-day and the
delegates elected to the Chicago conven
tion will worK and vote in the interest of
free and unlimited coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to L The platform favors free
silver coinage and calls on the President to
carry out the action of Congress on the
Cuban question.
Senator TilJman and Governor Evans
both made speeches, the former denounc
ing the President and Northern Demo
crats and the latter advocating Tiilman's
candidacy for the Presidancy.
Senator Irby, speaking in the capacity
of the chairman of the Democracy ol the
State, warned the reform faction against
a boll, and predicted as a result ruin to toe
party in the State, not only to white su
premacy but to white civilization, as the
breach would be made a permanent one.
He said that the whole trouble was that
the party. was good enough to elect Tin
man Governor twice and to the Senate,
but was not good enough to elect him
President.
Senator Tillman was bitter in his reply
and ascribed Irby's attack on him to his
(Irbys) fear for his re-election. To this
Irby, who was seated at a short distance,
gave the lie direct. Tillman's answer was
lost in the confusion of cheers and counter
cheers that followed.

COLONEL SELLERS TALKS.
Plan* of the S ifi.ua/ Council of Patri
otic Amiociation*.
WASHINGTON*. P. C, May 2o.â Colonel
E. H. Sellers of Detroit, Mich., president of j
what is Known a? the National Council of
Patriotic Associations of the United States,
in an interview yesterday said the organi
zation has for its plan* and purpose the
interviewing ol both of the political par
ties with a view to inducing them to
incorporate in their platform the plat
form and principles of this order.
It is the purpose of this institution to
attend the National Jconventions of both
the old parties, with a view of presenting
to them the p.atlorm of principles, which
includes the restriction of immigration,
the sixteenth amendment to the constitu
tion, the seventeenth amendment to the
constitution, and ask the parties to adopt
their platform as a part of their platforms.
In case of failure to secure the recog
nition of the Republican National Com
mittee at St. Lou:.- or tne National Demo
cratic Convention a: Chicago, thn com
bined patriotic associations in this coun
try propose to call a convention of all the
patriotic associations of the United States,
every State to be represented, with a view
to discussing the propriety and wisdom of
placing what is called the American party
m the field.
It was the purpose, he said, to consider
all the candidates in the rie'.d. They have
been considering all the Republican candi
dates for the Presidency, and as soon as
the Democratic party reveals who its can
didates are it will investigate them also.
Regarding the so-calied Populist or Sil
ver party. Coloi;ei Sellers said, replying to
a question as to whether that party would
be considered as a factor in politics, that
the National Council had considered only
the men who are prominent in those or
ganizations, and they had not committed
themselves to any economic questions so
far as related to party politics.
Concerning whatever influence the
action of the A. P. A. woiild exert over the
"combined National patriotic associa
tions" of this country Colonel Sellers said:
"The American Protective Association
has just closed its National Convention
and all I can say is this, that if the asso
| ciation, by abolishing its advisory board,
did so with a view of assisting any partic
ular candidate in his candidacy for the
Presidency, the National Council of patri
-1 otic associations of this country, of which
! I am president will certainly not be tit
; rluenced by any such action."
He further explained that "the execu
tive committee of the National Council
of patriotic associations is composed of
both Democrats and Republicans, there
being five in the committee, two of whom
have been life-long Democrats and tnree
life-long Republicans, representing both
the North and the South.'

DEATH RATHER THAN POVERTY
" My Wif- Has Gone; I Will Scon Fol
low," His Ominous Words to
Neighbors.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 20.â With !
"method in his madness" and with plans
pre-arranged even to the minutest detail.
Charles W. England, a lawyer of limited
acquaintance in Los Angeles, but greatly
esteemed where known, committed mur- :
der and suicide at his home on an cmi- ',
nence of East Los Angeles last night, and â 
the double tragedy has shocked and horri-
Bed society of every grade. This young
man and brilliant attorney, made desper- !
ate by fancied grievances and wrongs at I
the hands of former associates in the bank- j
ing business at Lonoke, Ark., shot and â¢
killed his frail but handsome wife, to
whom he was markedly devoted, after she J
had retired for the night. The ball from '
a 3S-caliber revolver passed through her;
. head from temple to temple, and she died '
J without a strugcle.
Alter this shocking deed England busied j
himself for some time in writing letters :
and visiting neighbors, where he made â 
strange and ominous remarks about the
"departure of my wife already," and that .
he would soon go, too. One of these neieh
bors â C. F. Veitchâ he asked to look after :
his stock, chickens ana other belongings. !
j He gave Veitch the following note for A.
B. Hahted, a young attorney in the office I
with Hon. T. E. Gibbon and England,
room 316, Byrne block, this city:
My Dear Haltted: As you have doubtless ob
| served, life has been very sad to me since I
j have been in California; so much so that I
j have determined to throw the burden off. My
darling wife, whose life my sadness has dark
â  ened, has just departed from me, and I expect
' to join her in a few minutes. I desire you to
take charge of the place and everything I have
and administer on my estate.
I have no: time to write more. Sorry I did
not get to talk with or at least write you more
, fully, Please send the inclosed telegram early
I to-morrow morning. Have the undertakers
take charge of our bodies at once.
Your friend,
C. W. England.
He also inclosed with the note the fol
' lowing:
Send telegram as follows: "J. E. England,
Little Rock, Ark.: C. W. England and wife
j both dead. Letter by mail." He will under
! stand this, as I wrote him Saturday, and he
l ought to get my letter to-morrow noon.
After quitting Veitch's presence he met j
a Mrs. Smart, another neighbor, and in
. quired about her husband, saying:
â¢I shall go away soon; I have arranged
ail of my affairs. My darling wife has
1 gone already."
The lady inquired: "When do you ex
pect to return. Mr. England?"
" Never. We are going away for good."
Prophetic, true words! This was the
1 last time England was seen alive, for he
j walked back to his home and there com
pleted his deed of life-taking by sending
j a bullet through his brain. This morning
; Mr. Yeitch went to England's place to at
tend to the stock he had promised to look
after and seeing the front blind up looked
into the bedroom. There lying on the
side of the bed nearest the window was
the body of a woman covered by a sheet,
while by her side, with his hands crossed
over his body, lay England. The alarm
was given at once and the Coroner notified.
Business reverses were no doubt â  the
cause of the tragedy. At one time Eng
land "was president of a banking institu
| tion at Lonoke, Ark., and was wealthy.
j He lost all through unfortunate opera-
I tions and then came to Los Angeles with
! his wife. He went into Mr. Gibbon's law
office and built up a good practice. He soon
purchased a little home and seemed always
to be happy and contented.
The J. E. England referred to in the
j message to Mr. Halsted is a brother, who
i telegraphed instructions to have the bodies
interred here.
POISON OR HEART DISEASE?
Peculiar Circumstances Preceding thÂ«
Fatal Fall of a Cyclist.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., May 20.â A most
peculiar accident occurred here this after
noon, which, though terminating fatally,
was only a sequel, perhaps, of a suicidal
determination on the par: of the victim.
Roy Woodcock was riding a bicycle, when,
at the corner of Figuera and Thirty-second
streets, the wheel swerved and he fell off,
his head striking the curbstone. He lay
there for some time in an unconscious con
dition and the patrol wagon was sum
moned. When it arrived, life was extinct
and the morgue wagon gent for.
Woodcock had been living with Rev. E.
R. Brainard at 914 West Eleventh street.
He was employed by the owners of the
Pacific Cycle Company of South Broad
way for whom he did odd jobs. He came
to this city from t?3n Francisco about two
months ago, and had been unable to se
cure a position suitable to one of his edu
cation, and this, together with an uncon
querable drinking habit, made him des
pondent. He had threatened to commit
suicide several times if he should prove
unable to overcome his winh for strong
drinK. His doctor had prescribed chloral
for him. This morning he tooc tbe con
tents of a bottle containing the dnu and
had the prescription refilled. All of this
chloral be swallowed, so it is said, and then
started downtown on his wheel. Thedrug
probably overcame him.
Koy Woodcock, his friends claim, was
subject to heart disease, and they believe
that this may have been the cause of his
death. He was a graduate of the Uni
â¼ersity of New York, ana a Bachelor of
Arts in German University.
SALT LAKE-SAX DIEGO ROAD.
A. Conference of Eastern Ma-jnates Held
in Lot Angeles.
1,09 ANGELES. Gal., May 20.â The
presence in this city of F. A. Thompson of
the Rock Island Railroad and S. K.
Hooper and W. J. Sbotwell of the Denver
and Rio Grande Railroad has fanned into
new life speculation regarding the pro
posed Salt Lake-San Diego Railway.
Messrs. ShotweLl and Hooper arrived last
evening. They have been in conference
with Mr. Thompson much of the day.
The Denver and Rio Granue Railroad is
Colorado's most important transporting
line, and runs from Denver to Grand Junc
tion. At the iatter point it connects with
the Rio Grande Western Railway, ostensi
bly entirely foreign to the first "road, but,
in reality, pjrt of wnat railroad men call
the Rio Grande system, and which runs
from Grand Junction to Salt Late City.
For years this sy-tem has been seeking
an outlet to tbe Pariric Ocean. To further
this desire the Utah company, composed
of Mormons, organized under' the title of
the Salt Lake and Los Aneeies Railroad
Company, and built eighteen miles of
track out of Salt Lave. Money cave out
when the Great Sait Lake was reached,
and construction ceased. Then the Rio
Grande system built a road from Thi-tle
Junction on the main line to Salina, where
actual construction ceased, but the engi
neers were sent on to fct. George, a town in
tbe extreme southwest corner of Uiah.
T>> this iatter point tLie road has been
graded. In addition to thi* a corv-s of en
gineers wa* sent out to explore and oper
ate upon the most feasible route thence to
The Needles, Cai., on the Atlantic and Pa
cific, which road is very friendly to the
Rio Grande system. "From Ash Fo'-k,
Ariz., the Santa Fe. Prescott and Phoenix
runs to Pbcenix and from the latter point
the line has been surveyed via Yuma,
Ariz., to San Diego, Cal.
Lately tne Rock Island route, another
friendly road, has surveyed a road from
Liberty, Kans., to Phcenix. It is known
that the Rio Grande system and the Rock
Island are largely interested in the San
Diego road and put up mO;t of the money
for the survey.

selves of late on the fact that the city has 1
added considerable territory to its area, J

SAN BERNARDINO SUICIDE
August Barandon Takes Poison
That He May Join His
Wife.
She Had Died by Her Own Hand and
Her Loss Embittered His
Ex stence.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., May 20.â
The suicide of August Barandon last night
was a pathetic one. About a year ago his
mother died. Barandon s affection for her
was of the strongest possible character and
every day since he nas seen, that fresh
flowers were placed on her prave. On the
24th of last month Barandon's wife com
mitted suicide in Los Angeles and was
buried in this city. Barandon brooded
over her death and became melancholy
and morose. He paid the same devotion
to his wife's memory that tie did to his
mother s.
Some of his friends had suspected sui
cidal intentions and instructed all the
drugstores in the city not to seil him
poisons. From some source, however, he
procured morphine yesterday. He then
mred a buggy, went to his father-in-law's,
took the fatal drug and expired last night.
He left a note to his brother, saying that
he would never be contented until he was
with his wile. He also left a will, by
which all his property goes to his brother.
August Barandon had scores of frienas
in this city, where he lived for the past
sixteen years. He was 24 years old.

SACRAMENTO'S
GAY EX-MAYOR
Relatives Hindered Gregory
In His Wooing of the
Widow.
CHAPTER 111 EXCITING.
Mrs. Lee Asked to Deny a Rumor
of Her Engagement to
"Guardy."
OFFERED PAY, BUT REFUSED.
Brother Frank Fails to Buy Her
Silenceâ Hundreds of Letters
From Eugene.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 20.â Letters,
letters, letters! Ex-Mayor Gregory and
the widow of Red Bluff are remarkable
correspondents. For three days Mrs. Lee
has been on the stand identifying and
commenting upon the tender billet-deux
received from old "Guardy," and when
she was excused this afternoon the stock
was not yet exhausted. When one collec
tion is disposed of a special venire is issued
and lo! counsel for the fair plaintiff stag
gers into the courtroom under the weight
of another armful. When the case against
the ex-Mayor, who is accused of having
cefrauded his erstwhile sweetheart out of
$0000, is ended, the court would find a
ready sale among the love-lorn readers of
fervid romance.
The prosecution occupied most of the
morning session reading letters from
Gregory to Mrs. Lee. They contained po
litical gossip mixed with comments on
business and social events. The District
Attorney, in answer to a question from
Bruner, stated that he considered the let
ters "A. B. R. M.," which were explained
to mean "answer by return mail," and
which occurred at the ending of many of
Gregory's letters, as expressing more than
mere business interest.
Several of the letters were written under
apparent difficultiesâ two or three on
trains, one in bed and one at midnight
after the writer had returned from a ban
quet. In a letter written in bed the ex-
Mayor said :
"it is customary to take cake to bed to
produce effusive dreams, but I could not
resist the temptation to eat the delicate
morsel you sent and took your Jetter to
bed instead. It is rather difficult to lie in
bed and write a letter, using my knees a3
a desk. 1 '
Reference was made to a meeting at the
Gregory residence. Mrs. Lee stated that
she was in the habit of going to his resi- j
dence on visits. One day when she went !
there Frank Gregory met her at the door. !
He was considerably excited and asked
her if she had seen an article in the news
papers concerning her and Eugene. She
had not, and he sent out for a paper. The
Gregory family then asked her to sign a
card for publication denying the state
ments made in the papers, making her
promises of payments of $50 a month.
She went to Judge Armstrong for advice,
knowing him to be defendant's attorney,
but considered him her friend. Arm
strong advised her not to sign the card, as
it would lead to more newspaper talk.
Mrs. Lee stated that she had no remem
brance whether she had told Judge Curtis
that Gregory wanted to marry her.
"I told him what Eugene had said to
me," she continued, but was shut off by
objection.
After a short recess Bruner presented a
file of over a hundred letters to tÃe widow,
asking her to identify those in her writing.
This was objected to by the District Attor
ney and a stormy discussion resulted.
"I made the statement that she wrote
three letters to his one and I was contra
dicted. I now want to show that I stated
the truth," said Bruner.
Mrs. Lee nodded her head vigorously at
this, but the District Attorney admonished
her not to speak on the subject. The let
ters were finally ruled by the court to be
irrelevant.
Louis Schindler, assignee of Gregory
Bros., who had been their bookkeeper for
several years.was put upon the stand by the
District Attorney this afternoon. Schind
ier was examined in regard to Gregory
Bros.' financial standing in 1894 and at the
time the insolvency proceedings were
commenced. Among the assets shown by
the schedule of the petition in insolvency
were several claims on which lawsuits
were pending. These the District Attor
ney pronounced "dummy assets," and he
showed that without these the assets would
be over |35,000 less than shown by the
schedule. The examination of Schindler
as to transactions occurring during 1894
was objected to by defense at irrelevant,
and a hot argument followed.
A statement made by Schindler during
August, 1894, was introduced, showing
that the firm was at that time solvent.
The items of this statpment were taken up
one by one by the District Attorney and
compared with the books of the firm, and
several apparent errors were disclosed.
One of these, a note for $2000 owed to the
D. O. Mills Bank by the firm, was explained
j>fierward by the witness. Tho mistake
was due to charging the note to the bank
instead of to Mrs. M. E. Gregory, who had
taken the note np. Mrs. Gregory is the
mother of the Gregory brothers, and is
named as a creditor of the firm to the ex
tent of several thousand dollars.
RIO FIRE AT SACRAMENTO
Kent Jirothert' Stables and Several Resi-
dence* Consumed.
SACRAMENTO, Cal, May 21.â One of
the most extensive fires that has occurred
in this city for years started at 15 minutes
to 1 o'clock this morning in the Kent Bros.'
stables, the cause suspected to be incen
diary.
The fire spread to the adjoining resi
dences and two houses belonging to Mrs.
Mickles were entirely de-troyed. One of
these was a two-story structure, the other
a cottage. Kent Brothers are the heaviest
losers. Three new hacks, three iarge
picnic-wagons, each worth $500, three de
livery-wagons and a number of other vehi
cles were entirely consumed as well as six
valuable horses which perished in the
flame?, besides a quantity of harness.
Ibeit loss is estimated at* $4000, and is
total, as they did not carry a cent of in
surance. The residences of Mrs. Mickles,
which are also a total loss, were worth in
the neighborhood of $3000.
The nre obtained great headway before
it waa discovered, and for upward of an
hour the department had more than a hard
straggle with the flames. Tliq llimsy na
ture of the structures and the inflamma
ble nature of their contents all combined
to make this lipht a hard one.
When the police, who arrived first on
the scene, broke in the doors of the stable,
they found the interior a mass of
ilames. They attempted to save the
horses, whose screams were more than
human, but found it was absolutely
impossible, as in their struggles it was
found impossible to approach them. Rob
ert Kent, who is the heaviest loser, is a
member of the City Hoard of Trustees and
19 financially wrecked, as nearly his entire
capital was invested in the stable plant.

VICTORIA SCHOONER LOST
Wreckage Fiom the Missing
May Belle Recovered
by Indians.
The Binnacle and Other Portions of
the Vessel Found in North
ern Tepees.
VICTORIA, B. C, May 20.â Reports
brought home by Captain McAuley of the
just-returned s-chooner Penelope indicate
I that the fate of the Macgie Mac and
Walter Earle has been shared this spring
by the Victoria Sealing and Trading Cora
' pany's 59-ton schooner May Belle, which,
' with Captain Ed Shields in command and
j a crew of six Victoria sailors and twenty
; native hunters left here for the sealing
1 grounds early in January. It touched at
; Tatoo Point, near Cape Cook, and there
; received the last of its hunters, then pass
ing out into the storm-tossed ocean and
i never again being spoken or sighted.
After the big blow of January 25, which
| severely tried the mettle of much larger
: craft, the cook of the Penelope picked
jup a hatchway bearing the num
| bers llf>B, which he took to be
that of the Belle, for whose safet>.
fears were even then expressed, but con*
. elusive evidence of its destruction was
! not secured until the Penelope was running
i home and chanced to learn that Indians
at Jacklesett had cached a quantity of
i wreckage, apparently belonging to "the
missing schooner.
He at once investigated and at the In
j dian rancheros found the binnacle of the
i Bf-lle, which was positively identified,
! with several other pieces of marked
j wreckage. This leaves no doubt that the
] vessel went down in the late January gale
i with all on board.
A peculiar circumstance in connection
! with this clearing up of the May Belle
j mystery arises in connection with the ap
; pearance here last week of Anna Eva Fay,
the spiritualistic medium. William Mun
sie, the schooner's managing owner, asked
! her at a public entertainment if definite
j news would ever be received of the lost
j vessel. She answered:
"Yes, you will have positive news of her
I before another week closes."

TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 21, 1896.
WOMEN CONVENE
AT SANTA CRUZ
The Tenth Session of the
Southern California
Parliament.
NOTED LEADERS ATTEND
Mrs. Kate Tupper Galpin Wins
Praise as the Presiding
Officer.
MRS. COOPER'S MALE ZERO.
Her Estimate cf the Unprogressive
Man Not Flatteringâ Clever
Papers Read.
SANTA ANA, Cal., May 20.â The tenth
session of the Woman's Parliament of
Southern California which convened in
this city to-day, has given evidence of be-
H's [>l!y G W/rWhf
Mrs W S Rat-rile"
ing one of the most interesting and profit
able in the history of the organization.
| The brightest feminine mindsin all South
ern California have centered here for feast
of knowledge of motherhood, home and
the elevation of womankind in the high
I spheres of usefulness.
Fully 300 women were in attendance
! when the first session opened at Neill's
; Hall this morning, while in all the assem
â  blagc only two men could be seen. At the
I afternoon session, however, the sterner
i sex had become aware of the excellent in
struction that was being missed, and at
least fifty gentlemen enjoyed the proceed
ings.
Mrs. Kate Tupper Gali.in, the talented
president of the parliament, rapped for
order about 10:30 a. m., and soon the
business was under full headway. One of
the most noticeable and really astonishing
j features of the session is the remarkable
I executive ability of this woman president,
! who restores order out of chaos quicker
! than nine men in ten could. Her rulings
i are always well taken, her manner is brisk
and convincing and- the smallest devia
tion from the established order of busi
ness cannot escape her serious watch
fulness.
The session was effectively opened with
that beautiful old hymn, "Nearer My
God to Thee," in whose melody every one
in the hall seemingly took part. The
usual invocation by Mrs. C. S. Colby of
Los Angeles followed.
The tirst paper on the programme, "So
cial Needs of Country Women," by MrÂ«.
Mvra D. Sprague of Fairmont, was an ex
cellent sample of the good things that
were in store. In the discussion
i which followed Mrs. Sarah B.
! Cooper of San Francisco, famous
j for her extraordinary success in kinder
garten work and being further widely
known for her prominent antagonism to
the recently* deposed Dr. C. O. Brown,
toofc the most prominent part. Three
minutes only were allowed for each
speaker in discussions, and President
Galpin rigidly enforced the rule, giv:ng
way only upon a carried motion by the
house to extend a longer privilege, which
was accorded to a number of debaters.
"Why Should Women Study Econom
ics?" was handled in masterly style by
Mrs. E. D. Steele of Compton." The dis
cussion was ably led by Mrs. Eiiza A. Law
rence of San Pedro, and at the close of her
remarks Mrs. Cooper again entered the de
bating arena and proceeded to reduce the
egotistical "male man" to a large zero.
"Homes are the protection of a nation,"
said she. "A man will shoulder a musket
I and tight to protect his nome, but he has
never "been known to shoulder a musket to
protect his property or house. This Hlus
trates the importance of making homes
to protect. The best way to give people
sense is to ?ive them responsibility."
Having pushed the man zero aside, Mrs.
Cooper paid a high compliment to the
class of people designated as "common
people." in which she was glad to be in
cluded.
The first paper in the afternoon was
under the theme of "The Household, My
Mother Shall Instruct Me," by Mrs.
Minnie Hanby Jonts of Los Angeles. This
paper was the most remarkable of the
day. It dealt in plain facts relat
ing to the proper instruction of
boys and girls rs to their physical
conditions, and gave in strong terms the
harmful results of a proper lack of knowl
edge of their own bodies on the part of
children entering man and woman ht od.
The subject was bandied in a plain,
straightforward manner and contained
so much truth and sound advice that its
bluntncss was entirely overlooked oy the
men and women who heard it. It was a
plain, honest plea for needed enlighten
ment for the young, and made a strong
impression on the audience.
"It is not a question whether or not our
children shall be taught certain things
that they must learn later in life," said
she, "but whoshall teach them," and she
proved beyond a doubt that this import
ant duty belonged to the mother.
The discussion on this paper was led by
Mrs. Theodcsia B. Shepherd of Ventura,
and was carried out in the same pointed
manner that had characterized the paper
itself.
N'e.tt under "The Household" came
"Household Hygiene," by Dr. Sarah T.
Maloy of Riverside. This was another
excellent paper, treating of the difficulties
encountered by the faithful housewife,
especially in the establishment of new
homes, and giving wholesome advice as to
how to overcome them. The discussion
was ably led by Dr. Theodora Wilkins of
Pomona,
By this time the interest had so in
creased that standing room was at a
premium, a large number of extra
chairs were provided and the aisles
packed with them, but still many were
unable to find seats.
The closing paper of the afternoon
meeting was "The Housewife's Familiar
l'riend* and Foes," by Miss Minnie Reed,
of San Diego, beiiijr a scientific treatise on
dangerous microbes, bacteria, etc., their
origin and the care that should r)e taken
to avoid conditions that create them. The
discussion was led by Mrs. S. J. Me-
CJatchie of Pasadena, who gave a compre
hensive talic on the various species of bac
teria.
The hall is again crowded to-night and
the audience listened to two able papers,
The School House Beautiful," by Mme.
Carolyn M. N. Claverie of Los Angeles,
and -The Kindergarten," by Mrs. Sarah
E. Cooper.

EVENTS AT PALO ALTO
Trackmen Realize but a Small
Sum From the Vaudeville
Performance.
Money for the Eastern Trip Hard to
Obtain â Senior Clpss Week
â¢Features.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
20. â The trackmen gave their vaudeville
performance last night, but though the
programme contained several good num
bers a very siini attendance and a conse
quently small amount of money resulted.
The management is under the impression
that the original high prices asked for
tickets was the cause of the small house,
but the real trouble lies in the fact that
all the students are eetting ready to leave
for their homes as soon as instruction
ends, and cash is being hoarded. Ordi
narily such a cause as an Eastern trip for
the track athletes and the opportuuity of
seeing social favorites before the footlights
"for sweet charity's sake" would have
bronght out a satisfactory sum of money;
but it now seems that the trackmen will
have to devise some other scheme for rais
ing much-needed funds.
This summer will find a good many of
the Stanford faculty delivering lectures in
different parts of the country. Professor
Anderson, head of the English depart
ment, will deliver a course of lectures at
Coronado, where he spent last summer
with Professor Thoburn. Professor Flengel
goes to Chicago to deliver several papers
before the Chicago University students.
Dr. Jordan will speak in several Eastern
cities, chiefly, however, before educa
tional convention*. Professor Abbott of
the law department is planning to give a
summer law eoont at Stanford, as Ss Pro
fessor Brun of the French department.
Very few of the professors will spend tho
entire summer recuperating, though most
of them expect to get a few weeks hunting
and limbing in the mountains or at seaside
resorts, or traveling for pleasure.
The senior class is making every prepara
tion to have the coming commencement
week the biggest, most interesting and
unique week ot the kind that Stanford has
yet seen. The senior farce to be given
Monday night is one of the chief features.
All the characters will be assumed by
the best talent of the class, and us re
hearsals have been held every day for
weeka past everybody is said to be perfect
in his part. The play is called "An Inter
collegiate Affair" and is said to be the
best original farce ever produced here.
Unusually elaborate scenery and costumes
are engaged in San Francisco for the oc
casion. iSeats have sold very fast and a
big crowd is bound to attend.
The ball in the evening will close senior
class duy. Some of the finest artists in
San Francisco will supply the music for
the dancers. The programme will con
tain twenty-four dances, and the faculty
insists that the affair must end not later
than 12:30 a.m. This was a slight con
cession to the class, inasmuch as there
now exists a rule that no ball shall last
later than midnight.

SACRAMENTO. Cal., May 20.â The
excursion train of tire General Electric
Company of New York and the Sacra
mento Electric Light and Power Company,
which arrived in this city at noon to-day,
carried the representatives of the largest
aggregation of California capital, esti
mated at over $200,000,000. They are the
guests of these companies, invited to view
the electrical transmission works at Fol
som. The train was a part of the Sunset
Limited vestibule service, and was made
up of one composite car, two sleepers and
a diner.
The party left Market-street wharf at 0
o : clock and the run to this city was made
in two hours and forty-five minutes. The
party consisted of bankers, capitalists and
others interested in large manufacturing
interests, besides several notable repre
sentatives of foreign powers and interests.
The excursion was arranged for the pur
pose of giving an ocular demonstration
of what had been accomplished in the
establishing of the largest and longest
distance electric-power transmission in the
world.
After a brief stop in the capital city,
during which the train wa3 invaded by a
committee of society ladies headed by
Mrs- T. B. Hall, Mrs. G. 13. Katzenstein
and Mrs. O. W. Erlewine. who decorated
the guests with boutonnieres of delicately
tinted flowers, the train pulled out and
passed rapidly through the beautiful Sac
ramento Valley, with its miles ani miles
of orchards, vineyards and hop fields,
whose green foliage gave no evidence of
the late frosts which had proved so disas
trous to the orchards of less favored lo
calities, until the histories! town of Fol
fio:u was reached. Here the entire party
was transferred to liatcars and taken di
rectly to the great darn.
The dam is a massive structure of gran
ite laid in Portland cement. It is 650 feet
long, 39 feet high in the center, 37 feet
wide at the base and 25 feet wide at the
crest. It contains about 45.590 cubic yards
of solid masonry. It is provided with a
heavy wooden shutter or fla^hboard six
feet high, which at high water is lowered
into a recess in the ernst cf a dam.
At low water this shutter is raised by
hydraulic piatons, the depth of the basin
is increased by six feet and additional
storaec capacity provided. Normally the
dam forms a storage basin or reservoir
three and a half miles loiiir, with a
capacity of 13,000.000 cubic yards of water.
At either side of the dam are nia.-sive
granite bulkheads and three hcadgates
operated by hydraulic machinery, each
head^ate 10 feet wide, opening into the
canal.
The east side canal is divided into three
sections. The first, stretching as far as
the State canal, where the water falls
about seven feet, is cut out of the eolid
granite and extends a distance of 2COO
feet. The second section is 4000 feet
long, and on the completion of this the
terms of the State labor contract were ful
filied. Thus far tho canal is built along
the face of the cliff. The third section of
the canal is an earth ditch, excavated by
the Folsorn Water-power Company, and
is 8000 feet long. The outer wall 6f sec
tions 2 and 3 carries a broad-gaugo rail
road track.
The total leneth of the canal is 9500 feet.
I Section 1 is 53 feet wide on top and 40 feet
lon the bottom. The depth is 8 feet. Ail
the water passes through the State power
house, through Leffel turbine wheels, de
j velopintj some 800 horsepower, used for
| air compressors, electric lighting and
! other purposes. Thence the water cou-
I tinues on to the Folsom power-house, at
the side of which is an immense log basin.
Here the jurisdiction of the Folsom
Water Power Company ceases, and that of
the Sacramento Electric and Power Com
pany begins.
The power-house is buiit on the site of
an old pl.icer gold mine, where a fall of
I fifty-five feet is available at high water.
It is on the west side of the town of Fol
som, is. cut about sixty feet deep and is
100 feet wide and 150 feet long. The hy
draulic apparatus consists of four pairs of
thirty-inch wheels of the McCormiclc hori
zontal shaft turbine type, each pair of
12(J0-horsepower capacity at 300 revolu
tions operating under a head of hfty-rive
feet. The steel penstocks are eight feet in
diameter and each wheel has two draft
J tubes. The governors are of the Faesch-
I Lycard type, and these are assisted
I by heavy nywheels litted to the water
wiieel shafts. The hydraulic plant also
includes two special horizontal wheels for
the exciters.
The water after having passed the tur
bines is discharged into a tailrnce canal,
which will distribute water for irrigation
over the country south and west of Folsom.
The power-house is a two-story brick
building. The water-wheels are placed in
the air between the forebay and the wall of
the Biructure, through which the turoine
I shafts pass. To each shaft is coupled a
7ao K. W. (one thousand horse-power)
general electric three-phase generator, the
largest of their type yet constructed. Each
is a 24-pole machine, delivering current at
GO cycles 300 volts and running at 300 R.
P. M. Tne exciters aro 4 poie 30 K.W.
generators, either one of which is of suf
ficient capacity to excite the fields of all
four generators.
From the generators the current passes
to the generator switchboard and thence
to nine step-up transformers in the upper
story of the power-honÃe. The capacity
of each transfomer is 250 K. W. They are
cooled by air blasts from blowers driven
by induction motors. In these transform
ers the pressure is raised from 800 volts to
11.000 volts and the current passes to the
high tension transmission lines, carried
out of the power-houÂ»e through porcelain
lined noles in the wall.
The pole line is double throughout run
ning to this city, a distance of twenty
three miles.
After a thorough inspection of the dam,
canal and prison power-house the party
was escorted through the interior of the
prison and its surrounding erounds and
returned to Folsom, where it visited the
lower power-house, containing the gen
erating plant of the Sacramento Electric
Light and Power Company.
Returning to Sacramento, the party wiÂ»s
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
escorted through the immense carshops of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
and then to the sub-station of the electric
company. This is a fireproof two-story
brick structure, having transformers on
the second floor and the dynamo-room on
the ground floor. In the main or dynamo
room of the sub-station, a iine shaft runs
the entire length. To this are directly
coupled, through friction clutches, three
synchronous motors, each of 250 K.W.
capacity, wound for a potential of 500
volts and run at a speed 0i,405 revolutions.
To the line shaft, are belted one 200 K.
W. and one 900 K.W. multipolar general
electric railway generators and two 1000 X-
W. Edison bipolar machines, all of S<JO
volts, 3nd three 100-light and two 75-iight
Brush arc machines. In this room are
also the switchboards for controlling the
synchronous motors, the generators and
circuits and the arc dynamos.
This power not only operates the entire |
street-railway system and lights the en
tire city, but is rapidly supplanting steam
power in all of Sacramento's extensive
manufacturing plants.
The party next made a tour of the city
on the electric cars, visiting East and Oak
parksâ Sacramento's breathing spots â
shooting on the toboggan slide and riding
the merry-go-round with all the abandon
of a party of schoolboys, rather than staid
representatives of the accumulated mill
ions of California. The visitors invaded
the Buffalo Brewing Company plant and
partook of its product, with an accompa
niment of sandwiches, and then returned
to the train.
The list of excursionists includes officers
and engineers of the great electrical com
panies and of the gas and power compa
nies, as well as a commissioner from
Japan and a delegation of prominent
South Americans. The latter consisted of
Colonel N. P. Tisciell, special agent of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Central
America; General Manuel L. Barillas, ex-
President of Guatemala, a heavy capitalist
and progressive man; Pedro Bruni, man
ager of General Barillas' estates; Adolph
Meyer, president of the Champerico Rail
way Company of Central America; Floren
tine Souza, "a capitalist and planter of
Guatemala.
The Japanese Commissioner in the party
is Seirio Mino, who was sent over by his
Government to study the uses of electricity
in the United States. This gentleman was
delighted with the magnitude of the plant.
"I had heard so much of this enter
prise," he said to a Call representative,
'but I did not dream that it was so im
mense and contained such grand possi
bilities. 1 shall not return to San Fran
cisco to-night, but will await the arrival
of the other members of the embassy.
"We will make a trip into Nevada and
to other points, but will relurn to this City
and make a careful and thorough examin
ation of tho system. I shall recommend
the establishment of a similar plant in
Japan on my return. One plant of this
magnitude will furnish all the power we
require."

TAYLOR HEARD FROM.
He Says That Dr. Pnrdee Labors
Under a Migapprehenslon of
Facts.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 20.â Q. K. Tay
lor, the Congressional Committeeman from
Alameda, published a letter to-day in an
swer to Dr. Pardee. After admitting that
Dr. Pardee would have acted fairly had he
known the truth Mr. Taylor proceeds:
The statemt nt that "Taylor wrote the ami
fuudinjj resolutions'' introduced by Mr. Short
is absolutely false. It is not stated that I
claimed to have written it, but asthisis.the
inference I deny evsr hftvinp made, directly
or indirectly, any such statement. Possibly
tho foundation for ihe erroneous rumor is the
tact thai before the committed on credentials
rep<r;ed 1 did interview delegates from va
rious counties, including Fresno, in advocacy
of an anti-funding resolution which I had
drawn and stated would be introduced. The
matter was discussed in the office oi the
Goiden Eagle Hotel hi the presence of Colonel
Kowalsky. Mr. Sl'.or:, to whom I had been
introduced by S. F. tarl of Fresno, and many
others. My understanding was that Colonel
Kox^Klsky would Introduce such a resolution,
and if he did not I intended to propose it. Mv
resolution was drawn up by myself and a cen
tleman from San Francisco.
I remember stating that I was pleasantly
surprised to hear Dr. Tardee's speech. As we
had a few moments before been voted out of
the convention, it is possible that I was
"chuckling with glee," but the recollection
thereof is not remarkably vivid.
The statement thut the delegates were con
fident of retaining their seats and that they
"felt a httlc sore over the treatment," is true
It is to be hope that they have recovered
Certain it is that although these delegates
were frozen out none of them cast any cold
glances at the Republican party. " They did
not threaten to -bolt the pany" unless seated
and no suggestion ot bolting hes been since
heard. Not one of them has been accused of
disloyalty to the party, and 1 am informed
that the two unseated delegates were the oalv

VICTORIA, B. C, May 20. -The British
steamer Onwo, 797 tons, commanded by
Captain Johnson and belonging to tha
Indo-China Steamship Company, and the
steamer Newchang, a craft of 558 tons,
collided in Woosung harbor on May 1
with disastrous results to life and property.
Nearly 300 lives were lost.
The Onwo was on its way out of the
harbor when they struck, and in less than
ten minutes after the accident it sank,
only the second officer and the third en
eineer of the crew and officers aboard be
ing saved. Two hundred and forty-five
Chinese passengers were drowned, while
seventy-five escaped.
The Newchang was also badly damaged,
but was able to reach shore before sinking.
Many of those saved were picked up by
the boats of American cruisers, several of
which were in port at the time. The
Philadelphia's men lent valuable service.
It was 3 o'clock in the morning when
the accident occurred and owing to tho
darkness and the terrible excitement which
prevailed, men who might otherwise have
been rescued perished. Further particu
lars of the terrible collision are not re
corded in the Japanese advices received

A resolution authorizing the erand
chancellor and the grand keerer of records
and seal to send fraterr.a. greetings to the
Grand Lodges vow in session in the States
of Louisiana. Kar.sa?. Georgia. South Car
olina, Washington and Maine was intro
duced by Pat Supreme Representative
John H. Gyselaar. It was adopted with
applause.
A large number of queries, resolutions
and amendments were offered to the proper
committees. Among them was the follow
ing important resolution, introduced by
George H. Morrison, past grand chancellor
and past supreme representative :
JUiolrat, That the committee on endowment
be, and they an hereby, instructed to frame
â Deli legislation as will enable the scpreme
representatives to the Supreme Lodge to use
their best efforts to secure an enactment that
will nullify the law that now deprive*
the dependent surviving relatives of a
euicide from receiving the amount that the de
ceased may be insured for.
Morrison is one of the notables of the
order. Besides the offices mentioned as
held by him in the foregoing, be is 2 past
supreme master-at-armr, was in the
Supreme Lodge as a representative from
Nevada for ten years, was chairman of
the special committee that adjusted the
Pennsylvania matter when that grand
domain rebelled against the authority of
the Supreme Lodge, withdrew from the
domain of Nevada to become a charter
member of Sequoia Lodge No. 1SÂ» and is
now a representative from that lodge to
the Grand Lodge.
The following telegram was read by tbe
grand chancellor:
LIMA, Ohio, May 20.â T0 George SamvtJf,
Grand Chancellor: I trust the work of your
convention has been moat profitable; that your
looses wiil dispense with tbe use of the rti -.a.
and that the story of Damon and Pythias may
be written in tae heart* of your members.
Walteb B. Richie, Supreme Chancellor.
The reports of the committees on vari
ous propositions were read and action
upon the same gave the first opportunity
to size tip the caliber of the representa
tives. A large majority proved themselves
intelligent, careful and deliberate and the
business of tbe hour was dispatched with
promptness.
On motion it was ordered that the pro
ceedings be printed for distiibution to the
members, the better to acquaint them *'ith
proposed legislation.
The question as to the amount to be
charged for withdrawai cards called forth
an extended debate. Many telling speeches
were made, with the result that those who
wanted the fee reduced were defeated.
The exp:-cted resolution instructing and
directing the supreme representatives to
have the Supreme Lodge reconsider the
resolution whereby lodges were forbidden
to use rituals printed :n foreign languages
was disposed of in short order. As soon
as the r?s<Mut'on was rÂ«-ad a motion to lay
it on the uibie was made by Supreme Rep
resentative' .-.'i it was carried Dy a
r radical. y unanimous vote.
A motion was made to take the resolu
tion from the table. It was ably discussed,
bat ended in the gentleman - ho offered
the resolution finally withdrawing it, wit.'i
the understanding that it would be
â¢mended and reintroduced so as to con
form to tbe suggestions of Supreme Rep
resentative Carter.
Thomas E. Hudgeon. chancellor com
mander of Macs Lodge, on behalf of that
organization extended an invitation to
the Grand Lodge to visit the P-es:dio
Friday afternoon. On motion it was ac
cepted.
An adjournment was then taken until
- P. M.
Many of the members must have made
use of the recess to cram on Demosthenes
3nd Cicero, for as the great questions cf
the afternoon came up the wonderful
bursts of oratory, flights of rhetoric and
mellifluous utterances that poured forth
brought down cheers and other strone
manifestations of appreciation.
The question as to what constitutes a re
tail liquor-dealer came up in a half dozen
different ways. Under the supreme stat
utes a retail hquor-dealer cannot become
a member, and many of the subordinate
lodges have found it difficult to determine
lust what amount of liquor a man must
sell to make him a retail I I â¢â¢â¢?r.
George E. CLurch of Fresno, past grand
chancellor, made a speech whiie one of the
many queries was being considered that
seemed to meet with the hearty ar:
cf the representatives. He contended that
the matter of eligibility should be left en
to the subordinate lodge?.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
supreme representatives to use their best
endeavors to secure from The Supreme
Lodse oScial recognition of the Rathbone
Pasadena tas entered the arena with
Hanford ar. d F.ei Bluff to eomrete for the
place of meeting of the Graxd Lodge next
year.
And now came up the amended resolu
tion relative to printing the ritual in for-
eign languages. Here was the chance for
trie gentlemen who had crammed them-
the forensic eloquence of tne
ancient rostrum to gain recognition and
fame undying.
speeches were made by Pa?t Supreme
Prelate E. T. Blackmere, Past Grand
Chancellor George E. Churcn, Inskeep of
East Oakland, Arndt of San Die^o and
Supreme Kepresen'ative Frank McGowac.
At the conclusion of McGowan's speech,
there was tremendous applause.
Buckler of Soiano, Pasi Supreme Repre
sentative Geyser, Past Grand Chancellor
Bodfish and Supreme Representative Car
ter also spoke on the subject at issue.
On motion of Representative Calepari?
the consideration of the question was
ned until to-morrow morning im
mediately after the reading of the journal.
Grim-visaged war will then be likely to
stalk about among the members.
At the cessation of the day's meeting a
number of the Rathbone Sisters paid the
Grand Lodge a fraternal visit. There
â were speeches, music and other forms of
social enjoyment. Many of the ladies
sr>oke in a humorous strain and kept tbe
audience in roars of laughter during the
whole of the v:si:.
SISTERS IN SESSION.
They Listen to an Address by Mrs.
Weaver, the Supreme Chief of
the Supreme Temple,
Tuesday afternoon was marked by tbe
meeting of the Rathbone Sisters. As in
the case of other lodges with a women's
annex, the time chosen for the grand ses
sion generaliy corresponds.
The afternoon meeting was devoted to
the reading of the reports of officers and
committees. In general they tended to
show the past year to have been very
prosperous and to encourage the sisters
for a stronger and more united effort in
tbe future.
After the reading of reports was finished
twenty-two grand chiefs were initiated
â nto the mysteries of the Grand Temple
Degree.
The session of yesterday morning was
mostly given up to listening to an address
by Mrs. laa M. WÂ«ftTÂ«r, the supreme
1 chief of the Supreme Temple of Rathbone
1 Si.-ters. The lecture was devoted in great
part to an explanation end elucidation of
the secret work.
The afternoon session was given over
mostly to the nomination of officers-
To-day occurs the election and installa
tion of officers and a general clearing up of
the work preparatory to final adjourn
ment.
Tuesday evening tbere was a brigade
meeting of the Uniform Rank and Grand
Vice-Chancel "or C. F. McGlashan was
chosen as bnpadier-general to succeed C.
Byron Nichols.
A regimental meeting of the Uniform
RanK was scheduled for last evening, but
on account of a meeting of the D. O. K.
K. at Pythian Castle it was postponed.

crowd to the track yesterday than on
Tuesday. Seven events were decided, of
which number the favorites succeeded in
capturing five. Imp. Fuilerton Lass, who
disposed of her field very cleverly in the
last race on the programme, was a 20 to 1
chance in the betting.
The good colt St. Lee gained fresh
laurtls in the mile handicap, taking that
event in thegamest possible fashion after a
gruelling finish with Cabrillo. The three
vear-oid was a prime 3 to 2 choice in the
betting, with Bellicoso a heavily backed
second choice. The ianer horse led until
within a furious: from the wire, where he
was passed and closed in on by Cabrillo
and the erst choice, who fought it out to
the stand, St. Lee winning by hall a
length in 1:41".
After considerable of a rest-up the Cliff
stabie's gelding Charlie Boots came out and
was made a 3 to 1 choice for the opening
event of the day, a six furlong run, his
price later being played down to 2. He
was away from the post poorly and cut lit
tle ngure in the running. Jim Bozeman,
who receded in the betting from 3 to 5 to
1. made all of the running, and, ridden out
beat the 8 to 1 shot Skalkaho two lengths.
Coda, an outsider, was a fair third.
The old roan warrier Tim Murpuy dis
posed of a fast lot c. sprinters in the five
and a half furlong dash that followed, in
cluding among them Miss Gentry, Nell
Flaherty, Duchess and Boreas. Around
post time Tim and Nell Flaherty vied with
each other for first choice honors, the ring
laying 2 : : to 1 against either. Boreas
opened favorite but receded to 31..3 1 .. The
bmiet-fast Miss Gentry went out iv front
like a ghost, leading until opposite '.he
draw-gate, when Tim Marphy overhauled
he and won by two ier.eths in l:08}Â£.
Duchess finished in the show.
The Imp. Loyalist youngster, Dun boy,
again scored "in the four-furlong spin,
starting a3to 5 favorite. He made all of
the running and won at the end with little
to spare in 4t% seconds.
Fourteen ordinary platers lined np in
the fifth race, a sis-furlong run, decided
under selling conditions. Around post
time there was no pronounced choice, the
ring laying 3 5 . to 1 against Three Forks,
Arno and Poiaski. The hordes named
were out in front a!i tbe way, and, through
superior riding. H. Martin got Poiaski
past the wire a short half length before
Arno.
A much better field went to the post in
the seven-furlong event that came next.
Rey Dei Baodidos ruled an 3 to 5 favorite,
which was rubbed to 7 to 5 before the
horses were called on;. Walter J. was in
strong demand at 13 to 5, with Long Lady
and Commission fancied in the order
named.
The 150 to 1 shot, Myrtle H. made a
surprising showing of speed in the early
part of the running, leading Walter J into
the stretch by a length, when her bolt was
sbot and she fell back. Walter J then had
it his way until well on toward the wire,
when ihe favorit* came strong on the in
side and took the race by two leneths. In
a fierce drive Martin on Walter J snatched
the place from Commission by a iength.
The final race of the day.'a six-furlong
sprint with a neid of eleven starters, ended
in a victory for imp. Fuilerton Lass, rid
den by Snider, who was backed down from
20 to 12 to L The outsider came last on
the outside the last iurlong, and, passing
Abi P and Sleeping Child, who were iead
ing, won by a couple of lengths. Place
honors went to Sleeping Chiid, who at one
time was quoted at SO to 1 in the ring.
The 11 to 5 favorite Hyman finished up
eighth after leading into the stretch.
TEACS AED FADDOCK ITEMS.

Ferguson the well-known Eastern writer.
Broadchurch, writes that patents have
been applied for seventy-two different
styles of starting-machines.
Edward Corrigan leaves for Cincinnati
to-night. Tom McGee accompanies the
master of Hawthorne.
The jadges were not over-e!ated with
Hennery's ride on Howard S. and a little
more discreet handling of a horse tnat re
cedes in the betting might prolong Mich
ael's days of usefulness in the saddle.
NeU Flaherty 40 tol, circles around the

doubtedly spells Schroagh, and after one
more such appetizing ride as the young
man who bears that name put up on the
fast Little Alp mare as that of yesterday,
and the turl congress should willingly give
;ts consent to allow a change to
T-h-r-o-u-g-h.
I; was not learned â¢whether Boreas
slipped his muzzie or ran away seven
miles before breakfast. A: any rate for a
horse that was quoted at such a'sbort price
la the betting and had the "Barrier cham
pion," Shields, up to do the piloting, he
cut a very sorry figure in the race. Down
in the paJdock it was whispered :ha: the
stable swipes did not like his chance, as
he is a horse that wants a race "under his
belt" before showing his real worth.
However. Owner George Rose must have
fancied his brown colt, for he ied the way
by chalking him up at a good light figure
in the opening betting.
Torpedo exhibited a vast quantity of
speed, and had the distance to run "been
an eighth instead of half a miie would
have been a strong factor in the race. He
backed up about as fast as his odds did at
the ciose.
Paul Ridley, who, up to the last race,
was a loser on the day's booking, palled
out winner by backine the cherry-ripe out
sider, imp. Fulierton La**.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Tne transfer-check system needs a check
itself. |
It is still anybody's race at St. Louis, and
all the favorites are confident.
Everyman who resists the transfer fraud
fights the battles of the people.
It seems that the gifted McNab is trying
to make himself a mystery story.
Drop a nickel in the slot and get a trans
fer will be the next Vining scheme.
Nihilists were not invited to the Czar's
coronation, but they are looked for.
Buckley's wish to get oat of politics evi
dently springs from a desire to referee the
fight.
The trouble with Democratic harmon
izers is they never know how to pacify
themselves.
From now until the St. Louis conven
tion meets politics is in the hands of the
woodsawers.
We may as well conclude to put Grover
down as a receptive candidate with grasp
ing tendencies.
The Chicago convention may possibly
straddle Grover, but the chances are it
will trample on him.
The transfer nuisance crowds the people
more and more every day, and by and by
there will be a big row.
Afterallitis a sign of some wisdom in
Democrats that they are taking this oppor
tunity to shake one another.
There is a chance yet for Olney to turn
up a trump for himself before he gets
tnroagh with the Cuban shuffle.
"The Carnival of the Golden Gate" is
a cood enough title to start witn. The
festival will soon make a name for itself.
The proposal to elect Tom Reed Vice-
President nas this much in its favor that
he would be sure to hurry the Senate up a
little.
There is many a goldbug politician who
thinks he is blowing his own horn when
he is only playing second fiddle to Wall
sireet.
In the great controversy over gold and
silver the middle of the road is occupied
by bimetallism, and that is the safest

Fiften years' confinement in the prisons

FRYE'S LATEST SCHEME.
The attempt made by Senator Frye to
have the conference committee of the
Benate and the House appoint the mem
bers of the board to which it is proposed
to leave the selection of a site for a deep
water harbor for Los Aneeles is altogether
one of the most extraordinary proceedings
ever undertaken by a statesman of his
rank and reputation.
The Senator had in express terms agreed
in the Senate to leave the selection of the
site to a commission of five persons, one
of whom is to be a naval oflicer appointed
by the Secretary of the Navy, one an
olficer of the Coast Survey appointed by
tne Secretary of the Treasury, and three
civil engineers appointed by the Presi
dent. Tuat he has now pouzht to break
away from this agreement seems a clear
proof that he and Mr. Runtington are
afraid of such an impartial comm ssion
and desire to obtain one which will be
pledged to iheir interests beforehand and
can be counted on to recommend the site
at Santa Monica.
The whole course of this controversy has
been marked by proceedings on the part
of the railroad lobby which can hardly be
called anything else than disgraceful. The
work began by calling a bogus mass-meet
ing in Los Aneeles to pass resolutions op
posing the improvement of the harbor of
San Pedro on the very evening when a
genuine mass-meeting of the best citizens
and business men of the city was held to
urge Congress to undertake the work at
that port. This was followed by sending
to Washington petitions favoring Santa
Monica to which fictitious or forced names
were signed, and now the series of tricks
culminates in this attempt to violate a
fair agreement and reopen the whole ques
tion after it has been satisfactorily settled.
Karely has the Southern Pacific of Ken
tucky in the whole course of its exactions
and oppressions shown itself more ad
verse to the welfare of California or a more
unscrupulous foe to the interests of the
State than in this contest. It is not Los
Angeles only, but all California, that re
quires and justly asks for a deep- water
harbor at that point of the coa-^t. It is
not too much to say that the entire region,
from Utah to the sea, is concerned in the
establishment of such a harbor. The
Southern Pacific will itself proht by it.
Yet such is the greed, the avarice, the
monopolizing instinct of tne management
of tlie road that it persistently and un
scrupulously fights every plan to obtain
such a harbor except under conditions
tbat would place the entire wharf front
age of the port absolutely and exclusively
under the control of the Southern Pacific
Company.
It not infrequently happens that poetic
justice is done in this world. The villain
frequently walks into his own trap. The
engineer is occasionally hoist by his own
petard. Frye's brazen attempt to violate
his agreement to leave the selection of the
site for the harbor to an impartial commis
sion may have the effect of disgusting
every houest Congressman with the tac
tics of the railroad lobby and its support
ers in Congress, and so prompt them to
settle the question at once by providing at
San Pedro a harbor that shall be for Los
Angeles and California, free from the
domination of the monopoly and open to
the trade and commerce of the people at
large.
THE WILMERDING SCHOOL.
The Board of Regents met yesterday and
listened to the claims of Stockton, Temes
cal and San Francisco, presented for the
location of the Wilmerding School. San
Francisco made these points: That the
school should be located where it would best
carry ont the purposes of the trust â a
working-trades school â and, secondly, it
should be located where it would do t he
most good. An elaboration of these points
clearly favors San Francisco, but the main
contention, and which should be the gov
erning one, is this: What were the inten
tions of the late J. C. Wilmerdin g in estab
lishing the trust? Did he intend to locate
it in San Francisco?
The attorney who drafted the will,
E. J. McCutcheon, testifies tbat in an
original will Mr. Wilmerding had given
feÂ£o.ooo to the Art Association of San
Francisco, and the same week he heard
of Searles' donation, and on a sick
bed wrote a note to Mr. McCutcheon
requesting on that account that a trades
school be substituted. San Francisco was
not mentioned in words, which was ap
parently a clear accidental omission, for
his executors and friends, William Alvord,
Thomas J. Lamb and C. A. Fargo, all tes
fied that he had never thought of any
other place and that he had expressed him
self favorably to locating the school at the
Potrero. These men, being the execntors
of the dead man, who cannot speak for
himself, and having no selfish interest to
serve, their worda are entitled to the
greatest weight.
That, however, is not all. Mr. Fargo tes
tified that in driving with Mr. Wilmerding
he pointed out to him desirable sites for
the school. Mr. Lamb testified tnat in
conversation with sireet urchins Mr. Wil
merding learned that they were idle be
cause they had no trade, and he wa moved
to found his proposed school by considera
tion of the fact that boys growing up in
San Francisco have not tne means of mak
ing a livelihood.
In case the intentions of Mr. Wilmer
ding are not carried out by the regents,
other benefactors who are making wills
or who will in the future seek some
avenues of philanthropy will Hesitate be
fore appointing their trustees and thus the
well of philanthropy will dry up or be di
verted to other channels. Certainly the
repents, who are men of high character,
cannot ignore what appears to be the com
mon mind as to the intentions of Mr. Wii
merding to found a school in the city
where he lived and accumulated his for
tune and in the welfare of whose boys he
always expressed a lively interest. San
Francisco, being the most central point,
offers every inducement to boys in the in
terior to come here to attend school, and
in San Francisco the^school will be of
most benefit to the greatest number of
boys, whether they reside here or come
from remote parts of the State.
THE CZAR AND THE NIHILISTS.
It is very likely that a few hot-headed
nihilists are conducting themselves po as
to give the impression that tbe order in
general has planned to assassinate the
Czar before he gets away from Moscow,
but it is safe to say tnat nothing of the
kind will be attempted. In the first place,
it is probable that on no other occasion in
his life, were he to live to be 100 years old,
would the person of the Czar be so care
fully guarded.
There are fully 200,000 troops in and
about Moscow for fihow and to protect the
Emperor, and besides this army of sol
diers a large percentage of the police
force of the empire is on duty at the old
capital. It would be impossible for one
to attack his autocratic Majesty and make
his escape; besides, it has been semi
officially given out that the Emperor will
announce that it is his purpose to immedi
ately institute very many of the reforms
that the nihilists demand.
If he shall fail to keep his promise to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THUKSDAY, MAY 21, 1896.
give the people a government more in
harmony with what is their due no doubt
it would be better for his health to not
venture very far beyond the walls of his
palace. Meanwhile, however, it is safe to
assume that the nihilists will not attempt
to kill the goose that gives some promises
of laying golden eggs for them, and,
again, history does not record many assas
sinations on great occasions. With the
assassin the avenues and opportunities
for escape are not left to chance wholly.
THE PARTY'S OPPORTUNITY.
It is very plain that dissension over the
silver question is dividing the Democratic
party quite as much as tbe question of
slavery did in tbe campaign of 1860. In
deed, there appears to be more bitterness
of feeling and language than ever before
in the party's history. This comes mainly,
however, from the fact that the party has
no prominent or distinguishing principle
of government to advocate other than the
money question. The Wilson-Gorman
tariff act has been so ruinous to the
country's industries and commerce has
suffered so much at the hands of the
Cleveland administration that the party
was bound to hide its incompetence be
hind some one declaration, and then so
magnify its importance ttiat the people
would lose sight of other issues.
No doubt the party could present a
formidable front were the rank and file in
harmony with the leaders on any one of
tho leading questions of the hour, but the
leaders themselves are at cross purposes
and the contest for supremacy is acri
monious and full of personal abuse. They
all are agreed, though, that the tariff as
well as the foreign policy of the adminis
tration has been a succession of blunders,
and it was hoped for a while the party
would agree upon the money question and
then go forward, dwarfing everything to
that issue, and thu9 win under false pre
tenses. But as State conventions are held
the fact is revealed t hat the Jeaders and
the rank and file are hopelessly divided on
the silver question. The free silver faction
does not hesitate to declare the inten
tion to bolt the Chicago convention
if the platform does not declare unquali
fiedly for the free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the old ratio without waiting
for international agreement, and the gold
standard wing is equally determined to
have their way or bolt.
As a rule the average Democrat can be
relied upon to wheel into line and support
the party's nominee whether he likes the
declaration of principles or not, but the
utter failure of Cleveland and the Con
gress that went into power with him to
protect the business interests of the coun
try at a single point and the commercial
chaos which followed upon tne heels of
the announcement of the administration's
policy have taueht sensibie Democrats to
do a little thinking for themselves, which
means that they are for principle first and
party last. Western Democrats were never
so determined to have a voice, and a very
loud voice, in shaping the policy of their
party. and no doubt they will go to the
Chicago convention with a mental reser
vation to not be bound by a Wall-street
platform.
But the Democratic house being divided
against itself furnishes no excuse for
apathy in the ranks of the Republican
party. Indeed, the fight should be all the
more vigorously pushed, for victory next
November should be so far reaching in
effect that tbe disorganization of the
Democratic party will be complete. In
California especially should the Republi
can party be on the alert, for aside from
the moral effect ati overwhelming victory
in this State would have upon the party
in other States it would give California a
prominence in the National party that her
claims to representation in the official
family of the next President would be
recognized almost without the asking.
Of course the Democratic party of Cali
fornia will be knocked out all along its
broken and hesitating line, but the mere
scattering of its followers will not satisfy
the material welfare of the State. Next
November will be the Republican party's
opportunity.
THE BILL FALLS SHORT.
The McCall immigration bill, which
passed the lower house of Congress yes
terday, is good enough as far as it goes,
but it falls short at the very point at
where it should have beea strong and de
termined. .Next to free trade the intro
duction of the cheap labor of Europe to
compete with our working people is the
must injurious to the industrial class of
tbu country. Establishing an educa
tional test is ritrht and proper, but it is
permitting foreign labor to come here,
throw our wage-earners out of employ
ment by cutting down wage schedules,
working until the required sum of money
is fcaved and then flailing away to their
own countries to live in ant! to protect
systems of government that are continu
ally trying to undermine the United
States that hurts.
It is said that there are fully 300,000 for
eigners employed by our coal, coke and
iron industries wi:o secured employment
by cutting below the w:.ee schedules of
our working people, and who have no use
whatever for our institutions other than
the opportunity they afford them to earn
money enough to return to their old
homes and buy an acre or two of land and
spend the rest of their days in compara
tive idleness, and all at the expense of
our own people. Thousands of Canadians
may be found every month in the year
upon our northern border taking jobs
away from men and women who are
worthy and true citizens of the United
States.
It is the failure of the McCall bill to do
justice to our own citizens -that we com
plain of. Industrious, sober and worthy
foreigners are most welcome, but first we
want to know that they come to build
homes for themselves, and to identify
themselves with this country. It is wrong
to permit this country to be a mere con
venience for people of other nations, and
The Call raises its voica against the ex
isting system of non-protectiou to our
great industrial classes.
The appointment of a new postmaster at
Elizabethtown, Ky., has called public at
tention to the fact that the retiring post
mistress, Emily T. Helm, is a sister of
Abraham Lincoln. Few people were aware
that so near a relative of the martyred
President is still living, and now that it is
known steps should be taken to find out if
she is well provided for in her old age, and
if not such provision should be promptly
made by the Government or popular sub
scription.
The report that the gold Democrats in
Illinois are willing to concede the renomi
nation of Governor Altgeld provided they
are allowed a gold delegation to the Chi
cago convention shows how desperate are
the foldbug hopes and how unscrupulous
are the means they are using to redeem
themselves. It is everything for gold and
nothing for principle.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE TARIFF CONVENTION.
Business Men Moving to Take the
Tariff Issue Out of Politics.
Editor of the Callâ Sib: It is worth while to
repeat the substance of a dispatch published
in this City yesterday, dated May 18, Detroit,
Mich., which said: "The National Non-Parti
san Commercial Tariff Convention, which
meets In this city June 2 (postponed from May
26), will be considerably larger than its pro
jectors at first anticipated. Secretary 8. B.
Archer of the Tariff Commission League has
received credentials already from commercial
bodies which have chosen over 1000 delegates.
At least double that number of accredited del
egates is expected, representing Boards of
Trade and Chambers of Commerce, and there
will also be representatives of labor and agri
cultural organizations. The convention will
probably continue in session a week or more."
The stated object of the convention is to devise
some method of eliminating the tariff issue
from politics.
; Some ten days before the publication of the
call for this National Non-Partizan Commer
cial Tariff Convention, it was my privilege,
after correspondence and conference with the
leading thinkers in the People's party, to
formulate and publish in a communication to
The Call the following proposal, under date
of March 20: The creation by act. of Congress
of a National Non-Partisan Tribunal (not a
commission) to consist of business men of the
highest attainments and character, who shall
v nS^S at lar Se on from each State, and
shall hold office for a term of not less than six
years, and who shall fix the schedules and ad
just the rates on each of the 4000 articles in
cluded in the list now subject to duty. As a
member of the committee on platform in the
State Convention of the People's party, held in
Sacramento lust week.it was my pleasure to
co-operate, with Hon. Thomas V. Cator in se
curing the adoption by the convention of the
following, as proposed by Mr. Cator: "We de
mand the creation of a National Non-Partisan
Tariff Tribunal of experts by Congress, which
shall be subject to the control of Congress, to
the end that tariff agitation may be taken out
of politics, and to the end that tariff schedules
shall be so adjusted that the benefit derived
therefrom shall result to labor and not to
trusts. It is almost a foregone conclusion
that the National Convention of the People's
party, to assemble in St. Louis July 22, will
adopt substantially the same declaration, and
as a member ot California delegation to the
National Convention it is my purpose to do
all in my power to secure its adoption a3 the
best solution of the much-buffetted and mis
chief-breeding tariff question.
My purpose in the present communication is
to ask the attention of the National on-Parti
san Commercial Tariff Convention, to convene
in Detroit, June 2, to a candid consideration of
the foregoing proposal for the creation by
Congress of a National Non-Pattisan Elective
Tariff Tribunal of experts, whose sole duty it
shall be to handle the tariff question, nine
months of the year, the entire time of the
members to be devoted to a close study of the
especial interests of their several States in par
ticular and of the whole tariff schedule in gen
eral, and then the tribunal shall meet in com
mittee of the whole at Washington or at some
designated place three months prior to the
regular session of Congress and formulate
such measures for the whole country as shall
work no hardship to any industry or Slate in
the Union, the same to be presented to Con
gress in the form of a law, ready for enactment,
such sections of general Interest to the whole
country as may bi agreed upon from time to
time being given the widest publicity as news,
to the end that the whole people may know and
understand the character of the proposed meas
ures, thereby creating public opinion, which
shall be a guide and prompter to Congress in
passing upon these measures.
Little comment is necessary in elucidation
or advocacy ot such a tariff tribunal of. ex
perts, chosen from among the trained and
broad-gauge business men of the country, who
shall provide a safe and stable means of rais
ing the revenue of the country for the support
of the Government and prevent any sudden
and disastrous change in the tariff "laws, or
any political agitation every four years for
such a change, Mien as we nave had during
the last half century, alike detrimental to in
vested interests and to the labor Interests oi
the country. Indeed, it is a matter for sur
prise that the business of the country has not
long since taken such a stand on this vital
question as that announced in The Call for a
tanffconvention; and results will certainly fol
low this Detroit convention which will be wide
reaching and wholesome In their influence;
and that convention mny meet and deliberate
j on measures for the elimination of the tariff
question from politics with the full assurance
that a large and Intelligent element in the
body politic represented by the new and grow
ing People's .party will c6ruially co-operate
with them to secure the acceptance by ttie
electors of the country oi any measure which
is broadly national and fairy equitable to
toiler.- as well as to capitalists, 10 the end that
the tariff issue may be taken out of politics.

EQUAL SUFRAGE.
rresno Watchman.
The equal euft'ragists have captured or capti
vated three State conventions. .Republicans,
Popnlisu and Prohibitionists have declared
for the ladies, and the combined logic, elo
quence and beauty of the female pleaders will
now be turned on the Democracy. There is no
doubt that the singular unanimity which pre
vailed on this subject in the three conventions
already held really disguised a great deal of
Insincerity. Some men prefer to apparently
yield than to hnve the clash and conflict of
argument. Doubtless if the truth could be
known many delegate*, if not all of them, who
voti-d for the equal-suffrage plauk, will bo into
the booth m-xt November and vote against the
equal suffrage amendment. But patriotic men
might do worse on either questions of princi
ples or matters of riolicy than to bestow the
privilege of suffrage upon women. It is siugu
lany inconsistent that a man Will deny his

A COMPETING EASTERN RAILROAD
Mocktou Independent.
A well-known Stockton engineer will start
for Salt Lake in a few days to take charge of a
party of mrveyors for the Denver and Rio
Grande Railroad, which is preparing to push
its line to a connection with some independ
ent line or to build one of its own to tide
water in California. With that reticence which
characterizes engineers engaged in such enter
prises he would say very little more about his
work except that it would be to find the best
Rvailable route through Utah and Nevada.
While he did not say thatthe San Joaquin Val
ley was an objective point he betrayed an
opinion to that effect. The building of the
Valley road must sooner or later have the ef
fect of attracting other '.stern roads to a con
nection with it for the traffic to be derived
from the region it traverse*. It will be as dif
ficult for transcontinental lines to get entries
to San Francisco as for the Valley road and to
get terminal facilities when they reach that
point.
It is therefore natural to believe that Stock
ton Will be made a terminus 01 one of these
roads, and the Denver and Rio Grande is quite
likely to be that one. This city would afford a
transcontinental railroad a very convenient
terminus, whence it could send freight and
passengers by steamer to San Francisco and
form a base of action while it was getting a
line into that City." The labor and expense of
building a road to this point would be much
less than those necessary to reach Los Angeles,
which is now hoping for a line to Salt Lake
City, and when a road should get there it
would not have so desirable a seaport as this
city, which is virtually a seaport. The Mer
chants' Association might devote some atten
tion to the matter of railroads which are look
ing Californiaward and present to them the
advantages of Stockton as a terminus and a
place from which the whole San Joaquin Val
ley can be reached by traffic arrangements
with the Valley road.

BUCKLEY IN THE SOUTH
Los Angeles Herald.
Buckley, while still insisting that he has had
absolutely nothing to do wrth the local Demo
cratic contest, admits now that he would
very much like to obtain the support of the
Los Angeles County delegation to seat what he
calls the representatives of the general Democ
racy of the State Convention to be held at
Sacramento on June 16. He claims that fac
tion in the party will resent the anti-Federal
office-hol.ling forces, which he maintains will
be controlled by Superintendent of the Mint
Daggett.
Daggett, Buckley insists, Is anxious to con
trol the delegation from this State to the Chi
cago convention. Buckley's favorites for dele
gaies-at-large are Senaior Stephen M. White
W. W. Foote of Oakland, Congressman James
ti. Maguire and some man from the extreme
northern end of the State.
BOUND TO COME.
Summerland Advance.
The Call of San Francisco is about the first
paper of any note on the coast to espouse the
cause of woman suffrage. Mr. Shortridge is an
able and far-seeing gentleman, and when he
makes a move in tho right direction moves all
over. Woman's suffrage is bound to come, and
the quicker it comes the better. Each Ameri
can woman's vote will neutralize that of some
ignorant outlandtr, who deposits tne ballot
handed him with a vague doubt as to whether
he is voting for Garibaldi or the Assemblyman
down in his ward.
MUSICS &
MUSICIANS
America continues to be the El Dorado of
singers, and above all of prima donnas. At
New York, the subscribers of the Metropolitan
Opera-house, wishing to offer Lillian Nordica a
proof of their admiration, opened a subscrip
tion list, limited to $10 subscriptions, and suc
ceeded in raising 50,000 francs, with which
they were enabled to offer the diva a suierb
diadem, ornameuted with 230 diamonds. This
they presented to her after the first act of
"Lohengrin," and she received it with ail the
favor it merited.â Le Menestrel.
The tenor Burgdtaller, who is to make his
debut at the Wagner Theater, in Bayreuth.
this summer, was attacked one night soon af
ter his recent arrival in that town by an un
known individual, who gave him a sharp b'.ow
with a knife. The street assassin, however,
met with a solid obstacle in the shape of a
score of one of Witguer's operas, which the
tenor was carrying in an inner pocket. The
book turned the blade of the knife und saved
Burgstuller's life.
Certain great ones of this earth continue to
dist inguish themselves by their love oi music,
which they do not disdain to cultivate them
selves in a more or less serious fashion. Tliii-
Prince Louis of Bavaria recently published,
under the title of ''Melancholy," a composition
for piano, violin and violoncello, which tbe in
itiated say is an excellent vrork. And now it
Is announced that the Landgrave of Hesse has
composed a mass in the style of Palestrina.
Nicolas Dumba of Vienna, who already pos
sesses a number of Schubert's manuscripts, has
had the good fortune to find and buy an over
ture for four hands by the Viennese master
which is absolutely unknown. This overture
is shortly to be published by a Leipslc house.
Mascagni continues to distinguish himself by
his industry. The Italian papers state that he
is just finishing a new opera entitled "Ves
tilia," and that he is working at a "Nero," just
as Boito Is doing, only Mascagni's ''Nero" will
probably be ready first.
The enthusiasm oi the people of Italy knows
no bounds when their composers are in ques
tion. To read the accounts of one recent pro
duction one would imagine one's self back in
the palmy times of i'ergolese, Sacchini, Cim
arosa and Paisiello. A young musician, Nicolo
Van Westerhout, presented his first opera last
year at Naoles. Directly after, at Molo di Bari,
his lintiil town, a new theater was built and
the citizens unhesitatingly bestowed upon it
the name of the young composer. They did
more for him; they asked him to write a new
opera for the inauguration of the theater, and
he complied by at once settii.g to work on a
lyric drama in one act, on a lioretto by Arturo
Colantti, entitled "Dona Flor." This work
was recently presented with immense success,
a tucctSHone, as they say over there. The pub
lic encored everything and at the end of the
act they called the compot-er twelve times be
fore the curtain, then they called and recalled
the librettist, the singers and the Mayor, who
was presiding, and, not content with that,
they insisted on having them all before
the curtain together, with the chorus, the
orchestra and the staee hands. Then alHhe
men, women and children and soldiers, who
had been present at the performance^" as
sembled at the doers of the theater to hail the
composer with acclamations and conduct him
to his hotel by torchlight. After till that Van
Westerhout can scarcely be blamed if he con
siders himself the direct successor of Rossini,
3elhni and Verdi.
A Paris newspaper gives the following list
of the most promising pupils who Bang at
Mme. Marchesi's recent commencement exer
cises: -We will cite in the first place Mile.
Kirine (Russian), who sang the letter scene
from 'Werther' with fine expression, as well
a!> Mile. Aina (Finland), who showed heiself
to own a fine iull mezzo-soprano voice, in a
selection from ' Py-che;' Mile. Boucicault
(Australian) also deserves praise, and a young
of rare beauty. Mile. Toronta (Canadian),
distinguished herself in the garden scene from
â¢Faust.' Mile. Kosminska (English) showed
gieat execution in the shadow air from 'The
Pardon of Ploermel.' The others who de
serve special mention are Mile. Sanda (Ameri
can), who gave part of the second net of
â¢Lakme;' Mile. Terriani (American), who ap
peared in a scene from 'Mignon,' and Mile.
Francesca (American) in the second act of
'Kigoletto.' All these young girls give prom
ise of coming prominently before the public."
Mile. Francesca, by the way, takes her norn
de theatre from this City. Her real name is
Funny Michelsou and at one time she sang in
Calvary Church.
Mozart is tne man of the day in Austria.
Hardly has his monument in Vienna
been inaugurated tiian the citizens of
Prague decide to honor him with a
statue. With the object in view a grand
representation of "The Magic Flute" has
been given at the new German Theater.
Fancy prices were demanded, and the house
was filled. Tne position of tho future monu
ment is alrealy decided on. Before the Con
servatory is a fine square on the banks of the
Moldau, and facing the royal palace, on the
liradschin hill, there Mozart will have a con
spicuous position and he can look toward the
villa Bertramka, where he wrote "Don Juan,"
a work whose success from its first presenta
tion in Prague has been the musical glory of
the capital of Bohemia.
The Young Ladies' Orchestra announces a
grand concert which will take place in Metro

to endow a bed in the Children's Hospital
which will be known as the Saturday Morning
Bed.
News come* from Moscow that the Grand
Theater there hus prepared a ballet extraordi
nary for the coronation of Nicholas 11. This
ballet, which is entitled "Daita," is founded
on a Japanese fable. It has oniy one act, but
the staging has cost the bagatelle of 100,000
rubles (neariy $60,000). The temple of the
Goddess Konanou, a sort of Japan se Venus, is
a marvel of magnificence. Needi^gs to say at a
given point in the music the gods and godesses
quit their pedestals and join the dance. At
one of the last rehearsals to which critics were
admitted the ballet produced an enormous
sensation. It seems that the Russians will
have something for their money when they
attend the performance.
The Municipal Theater of Cologne has just
produced with success a new opera in two acts
entitled "Elsi," written by a buddingcomposer,
who bears a celebrated name, Arnold Men
delssohn.

WHY IT MAY FAIL
Modesto Herald.
If the woman's suffrage amendment to the
constitution fails of adoption at the hands of
the voters in November it will be because of
the indifference of the women themselves.
When *> majority of the women of the State
shall requestor their husbands and sweethearts
the right of suffrage a majority of the men will
vote to give it to them. We think the amend
ment will fail of adoption at the coming elec
tion. _^____^_^___

The Tivoli Opera Company is going to

to give all the singers a good time. All
bands may therefore expect a very
pleasant excursion.
The steamer Homer is now out of com
mission, owing to the fact that the Czarina

I are that she will do a big business in bring

TOO LATE TO
RETREAT NOW
Brewery Workmen Com
pelled to Insist Upon
Their Demands.
EDICT FROM THE EAST.
The Local Union Ordered to En
force Recognition by the
Eosses.
THEIR ENEMIES' WEAK SPOT.
Association Members Fear the Enter
prise Has Been Selected for
tbe Boycott.
Before many >lays pa*s thÂ°re is likely to
be another upheaval in trade union circles.
The ultimatum sent last Friday by the
Brewers' Protective Association to the
Brewery Workmen's Union, in which the
\-oÂ«*es\ -oÂ«*es refused to recocnize the union, has
not been received with pleasure by tne
latter body.
When the union made the demand for
recognition it announced that it was pre
pared to make a bitter fight to accomplish
its endr. and the refusal of the bosses w;i
plainly an acceptance of the challenge.
It leaves but one thing to be done â tit:ht,
and the machinery to this end is already
set in motion.
The case was practically placed in the
hands of the ban Francisco Trades Coun
cil and by that body referred to a special
committee, consisting of Thurman, Mo-
Arthur and Walters. This committee met
last evening and discussed the situation.
The committee regarded with interest a
bit of information received Irom the
enemy's camp, and which it was not in
tended the union men should learn. It is
that the bosses are much concerned over
the threat of the union to select only one
of the breweries of the combine for a boy
cott. A week or so ago the uni^n decided
to work on this plan and select the brew
crv having a large patronage by the labor
ing people.
The purpose of this was that, having
had the promise of support from all the
labor unions in the City, a boycott of this
order would be more effectual." The union
has no fear but what it can furnish a sub
stitute for tne boycotted beverage. Sev
eral outside brewers would be only too
glad to secure a good San Francisco traie.
The information that the union received
came from one of the brewers who had
been discussing the situation with several
other?. They agreed ttiat if the Enter
-1 rise Brewery should, be selected as the
victim, as they had been credibly in
lormeU that it had. the association wouid
have a hard riirht on it? hands.
The wcakne^ lay in this, that this brew
ery'a annual output is about .15,000 barrels,
and the patrons are largely the working
people. Consequently a boycott in this
direction would be very damaging to the
association.
Under the agreement among the bosses
they as a whole must make good to the in
jured member the equivalent of his loss.
When the Jackson and National Breweries
were boycotted they did not call upon the
association for the amount of their losses
for more than two or three months ; so the
expense to the association was not tieavv
during the remaining three years.
With the Enterprise it may be different
because of the largeness of the loss it
would have to sustain in consequence of
a boycott by the laboring classes.
The members who discussed this prop
osition feared that the Enterprise people
would demand all due them under the
agreement and the assessment upon the
other brewers would be very heavy. It
was estimated that even the smallest
brewers in the combine would have to put
up at least $-'M) a month and the largerones
in proportion.
At the present price of beer and the
local brewers' competition with the iarge
quantities that are shipped into San P'ran
ci&co from tne East and the surrounding
towns, the brewers fear that some ol their
number will "kick,"' anu a "kick" means
disruption, for it iÂ« not expected that the
boycotted brewery will holdout long wit n
out financial rapport from the association.
All that is necessary for a general smash
up is one brewery to drop out of the com
bine and go over to the union cause.
Wjiie ali of the brewers and maltsters
in the body agreed to pay hied prices to
their present employes there is strong
reasons to believe that they are not keep
ing tneir agreement. It is a very easy
thing for a ooss to say that he is paying
|15 a week for certain work when as
a tact he is only pitying $J< and $10. The
workmen are airaiu to tell the truth as to
what they receive, for fear that they will
be discharged, and they can easily say
that they receive full pay.
When the committeemen were asked
the question direct whether the Enter
prise Brewery bad been selected for the
boycott, while they would not acknowl
edge such was the case none would deny
the rumor.
It is generally conceded by the union
men that the terms in general offered by
the bosses are fair, with the exception
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
that union men will not be recognized. It
is upon this one point that the whole
matter hanes. If this recognition is given
there wi;l be no trouble, but if it is not a
figbt cannot be avoided.
This fact was emphasized at last nieht's
meeting by the reading of a communica
tion from the National union in the East
to the effect that the local union must win
this one point whatever the cost maybe.
An order of this kind from the National
organization ifl mandatory.

The Republican State Executive
Committee to Hold Its
Initial Meeting.
John D. Spreckels Returns From the
Sooth and Praises the New
Committee.
John D. SprecKels and S. M. Shortridge
returned yesterday from tneir trip to LO9
Angeles and San Diego.
To his friends Mr. Spreckels expressed
his Individual satisfaction at the character
ol the executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Corumittee as it has
been created by Mr. Arthur.
He gives the estimate of the committee
that is given by intelligent Republicans of
tne State generally in saying that it is a
comni'ttee of clean and capable men,
familiar with political campaign work,
who are representative of both the party
and the whole tState and who will work
harmoniously for the unity and best
interests of the party.
The executive committee will hold its
firÂ«t meeting at the headquarters of the
ijtate Committee, 419 California street,
this afternoon. It is like!}* that all of the
twenty-one members will be present. W.
F. Parker of Los Angeles and W. F.
George of Sacramento came to the City
yesterday, and the iÂ«ther members from
outside of San Francisco are expected to
arrive this morning.
It is not likely that the execntive com
mittee will do anything of importance at
this meeting beyond effecting permanent
organization by tne election of a chairman,
a secretary and an assistant secretary.
The active campaign work of the com
mittee will not begin until after the Na
tional Convention does its work.

a concussion of the spine and a badly sprained
back.
THE EVANGELIST
WAS CRITICIZED.
Jews Become Very Much
Incensed at Herman
Warszawiak.
ASKED FOR AUTHORITIES
Exciting Scene at the Howard
Street Methodist Episco
pal Church.
DECLLNED TO BE QUESTIONED.
Hebrews Who Objected to Religious
Criticism From One of Their
Own Blood.
An exciting scene took place last even
ing in the Howard-street Methodist Epis
copal Church when Herman Warszawiak,
superintendent of the New York Ameri
can Mission to the Jews, had finished his
first address to the people of California on
the subject of evangelizing the Jews.
A large number of Hebrews were in the
audience that filled every available seat in
the assembly-room, and, though they
listened in silence until the address was
over, they could contain themselves no
longer when the la?t words had been said
and|the audience began to disper.-e.
Then they crowded about the evangelist
and demanded to know his authority for
some of tne statements he had made.
He refused to answer them, saying that
the place was not a proper one for such
discussions, but that he would be glad to
meet his questioners later and give them
any information in his power.
This so incensed some of the Hebrews
that they scoffed openly at the speaker,
and one man told nini that he was a rene
gade and should stop trying to Christian
ize Jews unless he was "prepared to back
up his arguments with fact e .
Mr. Warsza^viak finaily beat a hasty re
treat, and the objectors" adjourned to" the
sidewalk, where they held an animated
debate in which some very uncompli
mentary expressions were applied to the
evangeast.
Mr. Warszawiak is strongly HeDraic in
cast of countenance and accent and is an
earnest and telling speaker when warmed
up to his subject," "Tbe Salvation of
Israel."
He dwelt particularly on the statement
of Christ that the Hebrews were his chosen
people, and said that -he Christians oi the
world shotfM bear this fact strongly in
mind and make every effort by prayer* and
example to bring tne Jews into the inheri
tance that belongs to them, inasmuch as
it was through the Hebrews that tae Chris
tian? of to-day became possessed of the
blessings of Christianity.
"There are 12,000,000 "of the chosen peo
ple living in darkness in the United States
to-day," said he, "and I cannot conceive
how a Christian who believes in and fol
lows the teachings of the Scriptures can
think on this vast army of human beings,
bereft of the bles-ings of Christianity,
without reaching out a helping hand to
save them.
"A- a punishment for their sins God has
scattered them, but he has said that he
wi;i gather tdem again, and I believe he
will.
"They must be prepared for the gather
ing, however, and the" Christian owes it to
God to aid him in gaining for them the mer
cy that is given the gentile throush his be
lief in Jesus. I have come 3000 miles to
beg of you, plead with yon, implore you
to carry the truth to the Jews, and con
vince tliem that salvation can only come
through Jesus.
"Pray for them and plead with them,
and you will do a noble work."
The speaker closed with a' strong tribute
to the Jew, as an upright man and a good
citizen.
His Case Dismissed.
Frank Neil, engineer on the steamer China,
wlio was arre^teu for robbing and attemoting
to strangle Mrs. Crowley of Stevenson street,
had his case dismissed by Judge ix>w yester
day. Xo witnesses were examined, but when
the case was called the Judge simply ordered
it dismissed.

HIS OWN BOARD.
He Asks a Regent How
Much the Health of the
City Has Improved.
KEINSTEIN WAS READY.
Oakland, Stockton and San Fran

Wilinerding.
POSTPONED UNTIL JUNE 9.
Spirited Discussion on the Indebtedness
of the Universityâ Budd
on the Deficit.
Tne University Regents began talking
Wilmerding School at 10 o'clock yester
day morning and saving an hour of the I
afternoon recess continued the task until
C o'clock in the evening. There were some
diversions not wholly devoid of humor.
While Mr. West was explaining with a
good deal of earnestness that malaria no
longer existed In Stockton and was quotine
health statistics to prove that the death
rate in Stockton was very lowâ among the
three or four lowest of the cities of the
United Statesâ Governor Budd, with a
sudden inspiration, turned to Regent
Reinstein and inquired:
"Reinstein. what reduction in the death
rate of San Francisco lias the present
Board ol Health brought about?"
"A reduction of 7 per cÂ°nt since they
took office," promptly replied the well
] osted Reinstein.
Tne regents held their breath in aston
ishment, momentarily exj eciing the Gov
ernor to announce that the present im
mortal Board of Health would soon abol
ish death entirely.
The regents attending the session yes
terday were Hallidie, Mi'.ler, Kelloge,
< haÂ«e, Waymire, Black, Lynch, John E.
Budd, I'lieips, Peiiirke, Martin, Wallace,
Jeter, Hnughton, Reinstein, and Secre
tary Bonte.
Professor Merrill of the L,ick School in
San Francisco addressed the board at
length and replied tv many Question*.
Professor Ardley of the University of
California read an excellent paper. His
views were presented with remarkable
clearness. He brought it clearly to the
mind of tbe reeents that Mr. Wilmerdine
directed that an institution should be
established wherein the boys should have
"little stiuly and plenty of work."
Alt r recess Professor Keyes of the
Throop Polytechnic Institute. Pasadena.
was aeain called, and enlightened the
boiir i on several points.
Tbe advantages of Stockton were r>re-
Ferueci by Colonel 11. G. Shaw, editor of
the Stockton Mail. He handled the sub
ject wilh skill a:id intelligence.
Colonel Shaw was followed by Mr. West,
another advocate of Stockton." Tlie Gov
ernor and Repent John E. Budd promoted
the speakers ocrasionally, and it may be
Eaid that the main points in favor of the
chief city of ihe San Jonquin Valley were
comprehensively submitted to the* judg
ment of the Repents.
The advantages a? well as the claims of
Oakland ttere to the considera
tion oi the Regents by R. Davis. He
had hi< speech well fixed in his mind, and
commanded close attention.
In i he course of his argument he read
a message by wire from Senator Perkins.
It seems that the Senator and Mr. Wil
merding had several talks concerning the
trades school endowment. The dispatch
rea I as follows :
"Mr. Wilmerding simply said he con
templated the establishment of a trades
school but mentioned no locality."
James D. Phelan spoke for ssn Fran-
CJfIOO ar.d answered more than a score of
inquiries propounded by Governor Budri.
Mr. Phelan mentioned that Mr. Wilmer
(line lived In Sun Francisco and never
owned a lionte in the country. He talked
in a kindly way to the street nrchins and
took a deep interest in the welfare of the
little Arabs. It was his intention that the
school should be established in San Fran
cisco. Surely the regents should respect
the intentions of a donor in order that
others niiptit not be deterro.i from making
eifta to promote tbe cause of education.
The charge was resented that Pan Fran
cii-co bad derived its wealth from the in
terior and was now sacking to gobble up
everything. In closing he submitted that
the school should be located in San Fran
cisco, because here it would do the most
goo-1, be available to the greatest number
of boys and would carry out the desires of
Mr. Wilmerding. Mention was made of
San Francisco enterprise in contributing
$2.0C0.000 for the Valley road.
The fact tTM very clearly set forth in
more than one argument yesierday that
the great danger to be apprehended was
that the school would become an institu
tion of manual training. Trade schools
6e( kto become engineering colleges. Tbe
tendency everywhere was to raise the
standard of education. Mr. "West of
Btockton told of sending his boy to
Berkeley for ptudy in electrical work, but
so many languages were put in the course
of study that the boy's health broke under
the strain.
It was practically acknowledged by
Messr?. Davis, Phelan and Keyes that the
Wilmerding School should not be located
at Berkeley, for the reason that the liter
ary students, the poets and Latin scholars
could not come in contact wiin the boy
mechanics without friction. It seems that
an atmosphere highly charged with
thought with a big high T, and science and
philosophy with a big b P would not be
ajrre able to boy 3 who expect to work
with their hands.
Higher education received some biffs
from several speakers. The organic act
creating the Berkeley institution was
quoted and frequent references was made
to the clearly expressed language that agri
culture and mechanical trades should be
tnught.
Some of the high-salaried professors
wbo are in the Eastern States or Europe
will be pained to learn that there is now a
deficit of $13,000. The university is that
much in debt, with a prospect of another
deficiency.
A few days ago a ways and means com
mittee was appointed, with Mr. Reinstein
ns chairman, to consider what should be
<ionÂ» in view of the indebtedness. Yester
day Mr. Reinstein read the report of the
committee. The document is about the
length of a President's regular message to
Congress. It begins by eulocrizing the
jegents for unexampled economy and un
paralleled rectitude in the management of
the trust, and closes with a determination
not to curtail expenses, lor fear some of
the pre-eminently gifted good men might
be lost â lost to the university. There is a
melancholy recital that Lonis Sloss Sr.,
taken as an average citizen in the matter
of exercising private generosity, had de
clined to assist the university, and then
there is the expressed hope that the Legis
lature will rise equal if not superior to
the emergency and provide the money
reeded.
The report recommends the further ex
penditure of $3000, to hold fifty meetings
throughout the State, to bring the unive'r
eity into line with farmers and miners.
rtegent Hallidie indicated that lie would
oppose all propositions to run in debt. It
was against his principles.
lie<*ent Houghton disliked a suggestion
in the report that boards of mining and.
horticulture be abolished by the Legis
lature and tee work in that line be as
signed to the university.
It was the expressed sense of the meet
ing that the suggestion should be omitted.
The regents do not care to encounter in
the Legislature the opposition of the
miners and horticulturists. Â.,,.,.
Judge Wallace agreed with Mr. Halhdie
that a report so important as the one
under consideration should be founded on
correct principles.
Governor Budd said there had been no
estraavgance in the university manage
ment. The deficit had been caused by the
jupgling of the State Board of Equaliza
tion in reducing the valuation in twenty
five counties to "cinch" San Francisco.
True. San Francisco had been increased 15
per cent, but a reduction all around of
$70,000,000 was made, by which the uni
versity this year receives but $107,000,
whereas the year before it received $119,000.
Tnat accounted readily for the deficit of
$13,000.
The regents adjourned to meet at 10 a.
m., June 9. It was decided that a vote on
the Wilmerding site should be taken at
that session, but not before noon of the
first day's meeting.
During the discussion yesterday it was
stated that Mrs. Lux had left one-third of
her estate to establish a trades school in
Snn Francisco. Mr. Reinstein said:
"That is in her will. I have a copy of the
will in my office."
A FOOLISH ATTEMPT.
Three Prisoner* Plnn to Mnke Their
Eacape From the City Prison.
A mild sensation was caused in the City
Prison yesterday morning when it was dis
covered that three prisoners in one of the
felony ceils had been planning a means to
make their escape.
The three prisoners are Frank Stocking,
arrested for perjury in swearing falsely to
a bond that he owned certain property ;
Louis "Wilson, a sure-thing man, arrested
for swindling a Southern Pacific conductor
out of $200, and George McCann, arrested
for perjury while giving testimony in
Judge Campbell's court.
They had commenced on the brick wall
at the rear of the cell, which is three feet
thick. One of the bricks had been re
moved after considerable labor and a piece
of paper covered the aperture. It would
have taken them months to break through
the wail, and even then they would have
found themselves in a lockedcorndor.
The three men were each placed in
separate steel cells, where they will be
kept till the cases are disposed of in the
Police courts.
LOCAL MILLINERS DUPED
R. M. Samuels, a New Ycrk
Commercial Traveler, Placed
Under Arrest.
He Is Accused of Obtaining Money on
Bogus Checks and Forged
Drafts.
R. M. Samuels, a commercial traveler
from New York, was arrested on Ellis
street near Powell last night by Detective
<;â¢ Harper and taken to the City Prison,
where he was placed in the "tanks."
According to the information in the pos
session of the poiice, Samuels came nere !
about six months ago from New York
ostensibly as the traveling representative j
of R. Lindheim, 652 Broadway, and M. \
Samuels, his father, 632 Broadway, both
wholesale milliners.
He is a tall, good-looking young man, j
and always dressed well. He soon trained !
an extensive acquaintance in the local !
millinery trade, and at the headquarters
of Eastern drummers at the Palace and
Baldwin hotels he was regarded as a lib- i
eral spender.
A few days ago he called upon J. Couch- !
Inn, the Market-street milliner, with I
whom he had done some business, and
presented a draft for $40 drawn in his !
favor on Coughlan by J. C. Spencer, an- !
other milliner on Market street. Cough- I
lan cashed the draft and on Tuesday, j
when Coughlan met Spencer, the latter re- ;
pudiated the draft, pronouncing it a
forgery.
It came out that Samuels had also ob- !
tamed money from Spencer and that sev- i
! cral other milliners, who had enjoyed the ;
| pleasure of his acquaintance, had been i
\ victimized in various ways. Amone them i
: waÂ« the proprietor of the Bon Ton on j
! Kearny street, who had advanced money
! to him on a foreign draft, which was after
! ward returned dishonored.
Coughlan, on learning these facts, noti
fied the police, and Han.fr, who had been
' supplied with a photograph of Samuels,
| unexpectedly came across him on Ellis
street last ni u ht. Samuels was slightly I
under the influence of liquor. He was
taken to police headquarters and Captain :
Lees ordered him to be locked up pending j
further developments.
it is said that owing to his fast mode of
living in New York his father got tired i
of settline his bills and finally cast him
adrift.
MINERAL LAND LAW.
Twelve Commisiiioneri Bccomm ended
by the Miners' Aasoclation.
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Miners' Association met at the Union
League Club last evening and recom
mended to President Cleveland as commis
sioners to designate mineral land within
railroad grants, the following :
Edward H. Benjamin, Alameda; John
McMurray, Trinity; Mark B. Kerr, Cala
veras; George D. McLean, Nevada; Hu
bert Viecher, Hollister; Chris Runckel,
Colfax; John D. McGillvary, San Fran
cisco; Thomas Poyzer, Alameda; Samuel
K. Thornton, San Francisco; E. C. Loftus,
Calaveras; T. M. Kendrick. Tuolumne;
Ferdinand Van Leicht, San Francisco; E.
B. Preston, Lassen.
The first four mentioned are practical
I mining men, residents of California, one
j from each of the four.'districts. The Presi
| dent indicated to T. L. Ford that he de
sired such recommendations in order to
comply with the law, which requires one
i in each district to be a practical mining
\ man and a resident of the State.
A special committee, appt . ted two
month 3 ago, considered forty applications
for twelve commissiotiership*, a..d last
evening recommended twelve. Tne ex
ecutive committee last night passed in
these recommendations.
The special committee consisted of Jacob
Neff. John M. Wright, Charles Hoffman
Edward Coleman, and - Williara C. Ralston
taking tne place or Charles G. Yale, who
resigned.
At last night's session Judpe Wallling
asked that the Nevada County Miners' As
sociation be given further time to consider
the name recommended from that district.
He had no objection to George D. McLean,
but thought the association should be con
sulted. Samuel Thornton said the matter
was a State and not a county affair and
then the motion to confirm prevailed.
The motion to ratify the twelve recom
mended prevailed.
It is expected that the bill will pass in a
few days and that the President will ap
point three commissioners from each of
tbe four districts.
These names will be transmitted to
Washington at once to forestall private
pressure for the place. The job pays $10 a
day, and will last lor some time.

WANTS DIVORCE HERSELF.
Sir*. Mover's Peculiar Allegations
Against Her Kx*llushand. Â£SftÃ
Mrs. Marie A. Meyer has applied to
Judge Slack to have him set aside the ac
cree of divorce entered in favor of Charles
P. Mever and against her, and to render
judgment in her favor in the case.
Mrs. Meyer says she was married to
Meyer in July, 1894, in Oakland. She.
says he wanted the fact of the marriage
kept secret for a year anyway, as his
father would seriously interfere with his
prospects if he knew of the ceremony. In
November, 1894, she says, she found he
had commenced divorce proceedings
against her, but when she inquired he told
her it was done to appease the wrath of
bis father, who had learned of the mar
riage. She says he"told her the divorce pro
ceedings would not be prosecuted to the
end and to ignore them altogether. She
did so, but afterward found the divorce
had been granted to him, and upon the
ground of infidelity â a thing she strongly
objects to, as she says it is without foun
dation.
In the meantime, Mrs. Meyer says, her
husband has been married "again, so she
wants the original divorce to be given to
her instead of to him.

POPULISM AND
ITS PROSPECTS
The Party's Manager Ana
lyzes Its California
Strength.
ALL CLASSES THIS TIME.
They Think That Their Original
Tariff Plank Will Prove
a Trump.
WILL TAKE IT TO ST. LOUIS.
The Party Has Learned to B3 Wary
cf Combinations, and These Are
Doubtful Yet.
The Populists are girding up their loins
with homely-mannered vigor for the cam
paign.
Since their Sacramento convention ad
journed the leaders have been congratu
lating themselves and each other on what
they regard as the flawless and somewhat
brilliant work of that body, sizing up the
public effect of their labors and laying
plans for campaign operations.
E. M. Wardall, the vigorous, sensible,
devoted and shrewd farmer of Monrovia,
Los Angeles County, who was re-elected
chairman of the State Centra! Committee
for the third time, is in the City and will
remain nere throughout the campaign.
On June 3 the executive committee will
meet at the Essex-street home of John C.
Gore, arrange for permanent headquarters
and proceed to lend active assistance to
the Congressional campaigns in the First,
Second add Seventh districts in which
nominations for Congress have already
been made. >'ot much else will be dove iv
the way of campaign work until after the
Populist National Convention in St. Louis
July 22.
Chairman "Wardall talked yesterday
about the prospects of the party in Cali
fornia, as be sees them. He said that the
party would poll an immensely increased
vote this year, and he told wiiy.
"fcjince the convention adjourned," said
Mr. Wardall, "we have organized the ex
ecutive committee and I have appointed
a committee on liuance consisting of John
C. Gore of San Francisco, J. M. Moore of
Alameda and John S. Dure of Fresno.
'Our campaign fund will come from pop
ular contributions. The convention ar
ranged for a fund of $10,0; X), whicn the
couiities are to raise by voluntary assess
ment, the amounts to be proportioned to
the Webster vote. Most of the couiities
are pledged to this by their delegates, and
1 think that most of it will be raised. We
have no other resources. Our people are
poor, we have no rich men or candidates
to assess and must be economical.
"The fund will oe spent mainly on cam
paign literature and traveling expenses of
speakers. This fund wiW not be so very
large, but we conducted the campaign of
Is. 4 ihi less than Â§MVO aud we made that
pretty warm."
Mr. Wardall and the rest of the Populist
leaders are very proud of their tariff plank
declaring for protection which shall benent
particularly the laborer and producer and
lor a iion-pariisau tariff commission. This
move is an original one of the California
Populists. No other State has touched
the tariff. Mr. Wardall expects the plank
to be adopted by the National Convention.
"I have been watching the effect of our
convention on the public," said the party's
general manager, "and 1 am satisfied that
we have struck the keynote, especially
with our stand on the tariff. Late in the
winter I made an extended tour of the
East and the coast with my eyes open,
and I realized that we could not sensibly
hold another convention without making
a stand on the tariff question. The people
demand it. There is no considerable num
ber of real free trade people in the United
States. We realized that the interests of
the party demanded that we take a conser
i vativu and tenable position un the tariff a
tariff that would protect labor ana produc
tion and not the trusts. 1 have heard no
serious objections raised to our tariff plank.
I think it is manifestly in the interest of
the party and that it will be adopted by
the National Convention.
"No other State has taken any ground
; on the tariff, partly because nearly all of I
I them will hod second conventions at
; which platforms will be adopted. "We
I have set the pace, as far as platforms are j
j concerned. I find an almost universal ex
pression that wo must devise a tariff that
I will not make a few millionaires at the ex
pense at the people, and that the present
system i 3 unscientific It does not take
it.to consideration the low cost of labor
entering into the value of an imported ar
ticle. I think Has plank will appeal
strongly to the mass of American citizens.
I thiiik it will be approved by business men.
"This year our strength will come
largeiy from the conservative business
men of the State and to tliem we will
principally appeal during this campaign.
The other night ten business men, .Repub
licans and Democrats, who happened to
be together in this City, discussed the
Populist platform, and they agreed that
they would support the Populist party if
no disgraceful combinations were made.
Business men are in distress and discour
aged at the outlook, and they largely turn
lo us because we advocate the free coinage
of silver end the issuance of money
enough to do the business of the country
with.
"We are this year appealing to the whole
people and not to any class. We have
made no special appeal to the laboring
class, but their vote will largely come to
us. Many farmers, especially fruit-farmers,
have been demanding a statement of our
position on the tariff, and they have got
it. They are heavily mortgaged, and the
tariff and financial questions appeal to
them as producers.
"The prejudice against the Populist
party, which has existed owing to the im
pression that it was coin posed of a lot of
cranks and communists, uas largely dis
appeared, owing to the fact that the so
cialists are more radical than the Populists
and have united with the Socialist Labor
party, which will rua a ticket of its own.
"1 thintc thai the work of the convention
has been conservative and wise through
out, and that it appeals to all classes of
citizens. The party is united and it is free
from boss rule, corrupt combinations and
efforts to get into oilice at a sacrifice of
principle. These are some of the reasons
why I believe our vote will be increased
enormously this year.
"We learned some things two years ago
that we wifl protit by. One is to be careful
about combinations. The campaign will
be mainly one of education. If we make
any combinations it will be after the last
two National conventionsâ the Populist
and silver ones.
"It is too early to say anything about
the prospects of "a combination with the
Biiventes. It will depend on what the Ke
publican and Democratic conventions do
with the financial question and then on
what is jointly done In St. Louis. If such
a union is effected we will carry the State
and San Francisco as well.
"The Prohibitionists, I think, are de
termined to run a campaign of their own.
There were no overtures from either side
during the conventions. We decided that
tbe liquor question was something we did
not care to Handle. Most of the Populists j
favor State control by some such plan aa
the successful dispensary law of South
Carolina, and the Prohibitionists, of
course, wouldn't have that.
"I think that probably 90 per cent of the
Populist vote will be in favor of the equal
suffrage amendment, and that it will un
doubtedly be carried. The county com
mittee intends to make a vigorous cam
paign in this City, and there will, this
year, be a realignment of forces that will
be felt here. This year, for the first time,
we will have an election officer in every
pollins booth in the State, which will be
another advantage."
Such was this Populist leader's resume
of the present position of his party in
California. The Populist mins will not do
much booming until after the National
convention, when conventions will beheld
to make county, municipal and legislative
nomination?.

Mrs. Addie L. Ballou Makes
Her Report From the
Convention.
An Enthusiastic Suffrage Meeting
Held at the California
Hole 1 .
There was a large and interested attend

at the California Hotel.
Mrs. Addie L. Ballou reported for the
delegates, consisting of herself, Mrs. Dr.
Noble and Mr^. Nellie Holbrook Blinn,
who had been sent by the club to the re

present and it aroused warm applause.
Mrs. Ballou said that twenty years ago
the National Republican League had taken
woman by the hand and that the suffrflgc
plank recently adopted by the Republi
cans of California was only what was to
have been expected of such an enlightened
party. "We are part of the Republican
party, and we have been with you to-night
to report our work done," concluded Mrs.
Ballon.
The report was unanimously accepted
and ordered to be placed on file.
Charles Wesley Kyle, the next speaker,
said: "In order to achieve anything you
must organize effectively. I believe
wherever we attain anything in this life it
is by active earnest work."
Mrs. Emma Gregory, the president of
the Woman's Republican Club, when
called unon for a few words, said that she
indorsed everything the last speaker had
said except upon one point.
"It is our duty not to talk politics alone,
but to show our gratitude to the Repub
lican party." Mr. Kyle here explained
that for the moment he had forgotten that
he was addressing a Republican club and
his explanation was smilingly accepted.
Several other speakers spoke indorsing
suffrage, among them being S. C. T. Curey
and J. Beach.

A GREAT SUCCESS
Fully Thirty Thousand Peo
ple Celebrate It Over
the Bay.
STREET PARADE IN TOWN
Picturesque Display of White
Uniformed Butchers and
Vaqueros.
SCENES AT THE TWO PAEKS.
A Flood of Humanity Overflows Shell
Mound and Oakland Trotting
Parks.
The greatest day of all the year in cele
brations in and out of town was yesterday.
It was Butcher- day â the third annual
celebration of the Butchers' Board of
Trade of San Francisco. And its over
shadowing greatness, when compared
with the first and second celebrations of
ibis board, was such that if the day con
tinues to grow in popularity a few years
more may Bee San Francisco practically
deserted when her wholesale and retail
butchers observe their yearly festivities.
The fitted calf and the Big, rounded ox,
with the sheep fresh from pasture, rested
in peace out in the Potrero. Markets and
stalls all over town were deserted and
closed tisrhtly. The tame steersâ pets of
the vaqueros and slaughterersâ instead of
luring unsophistocated cattle to their doom
at South San Francisco, familiarly known
as "Butchertown," were led with lariats
and garlands through the City's streets.
Lassos were cast upon the Oakland trot
ting park to catch flying horses and
vaqueros. Rivalry was tor fun and prizes
and honors, either at the track or in Shell
Wound Park.
The wholesale butcher who owns thou
sands of fair acres in the interior valleys
und many thousands of sheep and cattle
roaming over those principalities, greetvd
the retailer and the vaquero or journey
man butcher alike. He took an interest
in the parade, in the sports and in the
varied amusements, San Jose and Oak
land joined hands with Sail Francisco, and
ail seemed imbued with the one spirit
that Butchers' day was a great day and it
should be celebrated as best they could.
The youug man in white blouse and apron i
with his monogram in red X tters and his j
Bociety badge met his friend, the house
keeper, and her friends. There was no
block between tliem. Any one could see !
that he was the host on this particular oc- j
casion. And as for his own girl in par- j
ticularâ she was there in her holiday out- !
of-town summery dress, the queen of the <
carnival.
Is is needless to say here there were
n:any queens.
Bateheer day was great in many ways.
For in the numbers of people who par- '
ticipated and in every other feature it was '
of such a magnificent character that other j
days would have to produce very strong j
evidence to sustain a claim of their j
equality.
Careful estimates based on tickets, seat
ing capacities, railroad ficures and com- i
parisons placed the total number of peo
ple at Shell Mound and the trotting park
at 30,000, if not indeed a far higher figure.
Possibly the number was larger. Mr.
Schweitzer, one of the leading wholesale
butchers, stated that as many as 41,000
tickets had been sold. The railroad peo
ple reported that at 11 o'clock in the morn
ing they had sold 20,000 tickets specially
printed for the butchers, and then had to
fail back on the regular tickets to Shell
Mound. Until 3p. m. every boat was met
at the Oakland mole by a special train, and
went away crowded. One solid stream of
people pressed through the gates at park
and track all day long. It was a matter
for doubt if such a tremendous crowd ever
before visited Shell Mound.
Then the butchers left San Francisco in
a parade that wa3 one of tne most unique
features of street pageantry seen here in
years. Its more interesting character was
the united front it presented. A great in
dustry united without rorgard to the
â unmeaning distinctions between employer
and employe. In that parade were mill
ionaires almost beside the daring, devil
may-care vaquero and the industrious,
sleek-looking journeyman with the white
uniform. There were more than 2000 of
them in all.
Across the bay, when the crowds had
assembled and fitted into every Beat and
likely nook, full of pleasurable anticipa
tions, the sight in both parks was really
imposing. The population of quite a re
spectable city in itself gathered to cele
brate and enjoy themselves.
Here was evidence of the extraordinary
success of Butchers' day, the result of
intelligent organization and the popular
suppoi t enjoyed by the butchers. In Shell
Mound Park dancing was enjoyed in the
pavilion, while diversion was found by
persons of tasle fjr other amusement in
the races and sports or in resting under
the spreading trees. The shade was wholly
grateful until evening came, and to
101 l and stretch in it was a benediction for
many City folk. Over at the trotting park,
just across the railway tracks, horse-rac- |
ing, bicyde-racinc, vaquero riding, etc., j
took place in the presence of a vast throng, 1
and despite the dust and delays these
eports proved to be all the people expected.
Butchers' day had nothing to mar its
harmonious and anreenble observation; bo
it was a complete success.
BUTCHERS ON PARADE.
Characteristic Stre9t Pageant, in
Which the Trade Par
ticipated.
Eariy in the morning members of the
Butchers' Board of Trade of San Francisco
and Alame a counties assembled opposite
Alcazar buildinc on O'Furrell street. They
were joined by the delegation from San
Jose. An hour later all were in Jiiie and
ready for the start to the scene of the day's
festivities. When the order to march was
>:iven there were about 2500 men present
to take their places.
The procession formed on O'Farrell
street and proceeded webt-.vard to Powell,
then down Powell to Market and along the
main thoroughfare. It turned into
Kearny, then marched to California street
and down to the ferries denot.
Henry Miller came in from Gilroy to
act as grand marshal. He presented a
tins appearance. His silver-mounted sad

die and bridle were entwined with ever
greens and roses, and his favorite riding
horse, shipped from Gilroy for the occa
sion, as if knowing the position of his dis
tinguished burden, held his head high in
the air. On either side of Mr. Miller were
his aids.
A platoon of police headed the long pro
cession and behind them was Cas^:i?a's
band, followed by Grand Marshal Miller,
Chief of Staff Henry Moffat, A?Â«:<;.i â¢;-â 
James Hall, T. F. Judge, P. Tautphaus,
George Katz, S. P. Hicks, A. H. Broil,
Leon D. Stone, J. Schrader. A. P. Wagner;
Chief Aid Amand Decourtieux Jr. and his
assistants, F. F. Winters, A. P. Wagner,
H. C. Flaiigeollet, George Johnson, \\ . H.
Moffat, Edward Taaffe, diaries Robinson,
Fred Becker, E. P. Clavburg, John S. Ott,
John De^ehler, Sam Meyer, Fred Meyer
and <;. DeLucca.
Immediately after these gentlem*n the
wholesale butchers followed in carriages
with the officers of their board of trade.
Their carriages were decorated with
draperies, garlundsof flowers and festoons,
one of them in red roses and cAlla lilies.
In the first division, F. C. Winters was
marshal, with George Johnson and W. 11.
Moffat as his ai-is. Vaqueros c!ad as cow
boys, with their picturesque saddles,
lariats and gay colors, rode in this part of
the parade. They swung their lariats and
appeared to be at home in the saddle,
which was not wholly the case, as was
noted later in the day at the park. Some
of them had the thones made fast to the
horns of niceiy-groomed steers, which, by
the way, evinced no disposition to rrbel
against bein;; led around by the nose, but
submitted to their leaders as if aware
that all roads do not lead to the slaughter
house and that even a poor beef is some
times allowed to enter by the narrow gate
to the heaven of a picnic grounds.
The fact of the matter is these came
oxen have been trained by the patient
cowboys and ars now docile, domestic
creatures that have no compunction in
leading their species intelligently from
corrals to slaughter houses in the Potrero.
There was a long line of journeymen
butchers in the first division. They wore
their distinctive dres9 with badges and
flowers, and made an altogether effective
showing.
Fred Becker as marshal and Frank
Hayes, P. Lousalot, Frank Fenner and
Charles Miller as his aids, led the second
division, which resembled the first very
closely. It had a fine military baud to
furnish music for those in line.
San Jose had a splendid delegation of it 3
United Butci.ers organization in line, the
men wearing white shirts, caps and aprons
and purple badges. In the column, too,
was a strong body of the Jouneymen
Butchers of Oakland, likewise clad in
white, a number of the men carrying
Japanese parasols.
The Oaklantfers had their own band and
received applause all along the line of
march. They went even a little further
than tDeir neighbors and so made a really
pretty display.
The third division was marshaled by 8.
Meyer, assisted by R. C. Kelly and F.
Meyer. The fourth section had J. Living
ston for marshal and Charles Robinson
and L. Clayburg as aids. Each had its
band and large detachments of journey
men butchera and picturesque vaqueros.
When they reached the ferry there was
a prodigious crush, and more than belf
the crowd was compelled to wait for a s-eo
ond boat to carry them over the b&v. Ev
ery boat thereafter, until late in the after
noon, was crowded almost uncomfortably,
and the railway men were put upon their
mettle to accommodate the flood of hu
manity that poured in upon them.

RIOT OF FUN AND FROLIC.
How the Festive Butchers and
Their Friends Enjoyed
Themselves.
Over at. Shell Mound it was a veritable
riot of fun and frolicâ a summer carnival
â with everybody out for a holiday and
full of the spirit that makes life worth
living. The men who had made arrange
ineir.s for the comfort and enjoyment of
the people overlooke 1 nothing. Rather
they succeeded in giving programmes the
like of which could hardly be duplicated
by any other society. Possibly there was
one mistake. The committees who
planned Butchers' day Duildcd better than
they knew. So it was no wonder that,
although accommodations had been pro
vided for 25,000 people, both Shell Mound
Park and the Oakland Trotting Park were
deluged by the crowds.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 21, 1896.
I In the trotting park this was painfully
i apparent after the immune new grand
stand, with its thousands of seats, was
thronged and the ring pecked to the
fences; for at that particular time, with a
throng pre?^ing through the gates, the
crowd suddenly overflowed the track, paii
uock und every other open adjacent space.
To be sure, there were policemen there â a
l whole company of them â and mounted
marshals as well, but they were borne on
ward with the flood, powerless to stay its
progress.
As soon as the people distributed them
selves and could breathe freely, the sports
began in rieht earnest. There were trot
ting and running races, bicycle races,
vnqueros' races and trick-riding exhibi
tions. The' trotting and running races
! were piven under tne National trotting
rules, ar.d the bicycle contests under
sanction of the L. A. W. racing board and
i 1,. A. W. rules. The rices for butchers or
I butchers' sons were open only to those
connected with the Butchers' Board of
i Trade.
E. Smith, J. Scbrader and W. Owens
gave eminent satisfaction as judges.
Jesse S. Potter, A. J. Ellis and S. Nut
ting were timers.
Amand Decourtleux Jr. was starter.
George D. llarris was referee of the bi
cycle races.
The first event was a pacing race, mile
and repeat, with owners driving. There
j were three prizes of $50, $25 and $10. The
entries were M. .Schweitzer's Aleck, R.
i Consani's John, W. H. Noy's Dollic V. B.
I L. Fisher's Black Bart, C. Vocke'a Wing
; Wing and I. Fos' Dellworking. Aleck
; won easily in both heats, and took iirst
! money. John was third in the first heat
and second in the second one, and took
the $25 prize. Wing Wiiig took Becond
1 and third place in the respective heats.
\ Time was 2:30 and 2:22.
A special bicycle race of one mile for a
! $20 trophy was contested by Walter Mc
j Menomy and Frank Rodolph, and the
I latter won in a spurt at the finish. Time,
j 2:36.
The trotting race and repeat gave con
siderable sport. T. Judce had Cap Harris
in; I. Fos, Polo; R. H. Noy, Bill Nye;
j J. Hall, Silver Button, and U. M. Slater,
I Doc. Can Harris was first in the first
j heat (time 2:41), Silver Button a close
second and Bill Nye third. In the second
heat Silver Button won easily in 2:41-^,
Polo got second place and Bill Nye third.
The third heat was won by Silver Bow in
2:40. Polo came in second and Cap Harris
third.
The fourth event was a mile running
race for money prizes. The entries were:
E. Esmond, Conneck; G. Bunker, Rocket;
J. Roche, liiver; Mr. Newman, Comic,
and G. W. Combs, Fl-Fi. This was an ex
j citing race, with the horses in a bunch till
I the home stretch was reached, when Pi-Pi
broke away and passed the wire in 1:47 W,
with Conneck second and Itiver third.
A mile bicycle race, open to all butcher
boys or butchers' sons, 17 years of age or
under, was won by H. Buttgenbach in
2:55. There were five starters. Roy
Whitney was second and J. Hoffman third.
Tom Bech of San Pablo avenue and
Fifteenth, Oakland, waÃ coming in third
when a wheelman crossing tiie track
struck him and gave him a bad shake up.
The vaqucrus' half-mile race was a wild,
invigorating dash that added spice to the
sports. All these entries were employes of
the Butchers' Board of Trade, and they
had to use Mexican saddle?. They were:
W. Jlarney, Wick; Ramon Rana, J*u!i a P;
W. ffmitb, Butch; Robert Steams, Keno;
James Roche. Rover; M. Donovan, Exam
iner. The prizes were $25, $10 and $5.
Wick won, amid great excitement, in 541,^
secouds, Butch was second and Examiner
third.
Seven sons of members of thn butchers'
board entered in the next event â a mile
bicycle handicap. Frank Rodolf won in
2:3l>i, with Walter McMenomy a very
close second and Roy Whitney third.
The trick riding exhibition in which
riders picked up handkerchiefs from the
ground while at full gallop, threw them
selves from tiie saddles, etc., and caught
one another's horses with lariats was won
by W. Smith. Tiie second prize was taken
: >y Frank BojM. The other riders who ex
hibited skill and courage were R. Young,
Charles Wilson and R. L. Stewart. En
tries were confino! to board employes.
An interesting event was the time race
in which ;he horse passing the wire near
est to three minutes was winner. Drivers
were not allowed to carry timepieces.
There were three prizesâ $40, $25 and
$10. The entries were: C. Johnson, Dandy;
F. Uri <fc Co., Kitty; B. Horn, Kittie
Brown; A. Decourtieux, Manzanita; A.
P. Wagner, Queen Beys. Dandy came in,
time 3:03.Â£. Mnnznnita was second, in
3:04 1-6, and Queen Bess third in 3:09.
The butchers' delivery cart race included
horses used in .leliverin^ meats, and not
bogey horses. They btrotched along the
track in procession until near the home
stretch, when they bunched and changed
positions. R. H. Noy came in first with
Kate Castleton, E. Easton second with
Jack and L. Burglin tnird with Dollie.
E. A. Young with Maud was a slow fourth.
A quarter-mile dash for vaqueros closed
the races: The entries were: Ramon
Rana, Julia P; Jolin Barker, Blue Cloud;
W. Harney, Comanche: James Brislan,
Red Cloud; E. ODea, Button; M. Dona
van, Examiner. Button won, Examiner
was second and Comanche third. This
race was run for three prizes in 25 seconds.
It was late in the evening when the last
race was run and immediately thereafter
the crowds scattered, many going back to
Shell Mound Park while others returned
to t ieir homes.

SPORTS AT SHELL MOUND.
Track Event In Which Much In-
terest Was Mani
fested.
The numerous cash prizes offered by the
Butchers' Board of Trade, principally for
members of the association, proved one of
the attractive features of the picnic.
To such an extent were entries made
for the various competitions that I. H.
Goldmeyer, who acted aa chairman of the
committee, and E. J. Taaffe and Henry
Meyn had their hands full daring the
earlier portion of the forenoon in deciding
to whom the prizes should be awarded.
The events were decided as follows:
Running race for member*, won by Fred"W.
Held.
Running race for men, free for all, won by
Frame V. Crcede.
Two prizes for cashboys in the employ of

SELL BROWN'S CHURCH.
Friends and Foes of the Scheme
Before Judge
Slack.
There Will be a Big Contest When
It Onies Up Again for
Hearing.
Those who want to sell the First Con
gregational Church property gathered in
force before Judge Slack yesterday, and
in equal numbers gathered those who ob
ject to any sucti proceeding.
Deacon L H. Morse and his attorney,
Charles S. Eells, were the spokesmen for
those who wanted to sell, and George M.
Si>encer appeared for those who didn't.
Dr. Brown was there, and Mr. Clement
and Merrill and Whittier and Judge Ad
vocate Wood hams, Â»n<i Deacons Hatch
and Bernard and Coleman. There were
others, too, and throu-h it all the fact
could be plainly seen that Dr. Brown's
merits wanted to sell and Dr. Brown's
enemies wanted to hod.
Eells made his application, but George
Spencer followed fnst on his words with a
demand for time, as he wished to make a
contest, and it would take time to file such
a contest as he would like to make. Ac
cordingly, the Court put the case over
until May 27.
The pale of the church will be opposed
generally on the grounds that a very large
number, if not a majority, of both the
society and the church, as well as pew
owners, believe that the church at the
present time is in as eligible a position as
it could be for the next ten years.
The opposition will contend that there
is no justifiable reason for the action of
those who have applied to the court for
an order to sell the church property.
The proposition to tell the church is not
new. It has been talked of spasmodically
for the past few years. The Brown trouble
has precipitated matters a little, but it is
contended that it should not have any in
fluence in that direction.
Another important point that should
not bo lost sight of is that the property
every year is increasing in value, and ten
years from now it will bring considerably
more money than if sold at present. The
opposition also hint that there is a "nigger
in the fence" in the desire of those favor
able to selling the property which will
probably be developed later.

THE WILY METHOD OF AN ACCOMPLISHED MURDERER.
How Blanther Thought Out His Crime and
Planned Escape.
MADE USE OF FRIENDS
TO ASSIST HIM.
Did Not Speak of the Existence
of Mrs. Langfeldt to Any
of Them,
BUT PLAYED UPON HIS FRIEND-
SHIP FOR MRS. MARKS.
The Identity of the Murderer Is
Absolutely Fixed by Daniel Eisner,
Who Knew Him in Austria.
The statement of George Dodge made j
public by The Call of yesterday morning,
that on the morning of the murder J. E.
Blanther brought to him some diamonds
and that he himself pledged them and
turned over to Blanther the money, created
a profound sensation. It not only re
moved all doubt as to the guilt of Blanther,
but it presented a picture in detail of the
working of the murderer's mind for days
before he struck the blow.
There was the man driven to exlreme
ties by poverty. He had known Mrs. j
I>angfeldt for some six weeks; had called
upon her with a letter of introduction at
that time. She had received him well,
but he was not impressed. He had not
run out of the funds he had brought with j
h:m from the East. He disappeared sud
denly, giving no notice to his friends. He
went to Portland and returned two weeks |
ago â a gentleman without money.
He sent a note to Mrs. Langfeldt asking
if he might call. She replied with an in- i
vitation. He called, and called again, and j
called again. His circumstances grew j
worse daily. He wrote, but could not sell
the product. He pawned his clothes and
spent the money. His landlady was press
mc him for the rent.
Night after night as he played cards
With her and drank her beer old Mrs.
Langfeldt was flashing her diamonds in
the eyes of the disappointed and desperate
man â unwittingly inviting her doom.
The idea of murder and suicide had j
grown familiar to his mind. It was a j
oommon theme with him. He had wearied
hi* intimates with talk of suicide.
He was even then writing a tale of mur
derâ"Why 1 Murdered My Wife"â that
he hoped to publish. The thought of kill
ing this old woman and relieving his own
distress with those diamonds laid hold I
upon him. He became fascinated with it j
as lack of money made him hungry and I
threatened to make him homeless. He j
could not keep away from the house.
He called upon the woman every even
ing and often through the day. He made
up his mind to do the thing. That de
termined, he straightway began to formu
late plans for realizing on the diamonds
and for esca|Â»e before it might be dis
covered.
His friend Dodge believed in him and
had served him in many ways. He would
employ him in this.
Voluble to a degree, he had yet never
spoken of his intimacy with this old
woman. He was not proud of it. It was
not a conquest that a young nobleman â¢
and professional lady's man might \
boast of.
In this silence lies the evidence that i
from the very first there must have been j
dark thoughts in the young man's mind j
with regard to this pliable old woman,
with her fingers full of diamonds.
And with this evidence comes the sug- \
gestion that a man who could so easily j
turn to thoughts of murder, who could
plan with such elaboration of detail, ex
ecute with such dexterity and with the j
bloody thing done face his friends and go
through the routine of the aftermath in
Fuch matter-of-fact fashion, surely murd
er to him could not be a thing of such j
moment as it is to those others of us who i
have not yet killed their man. The thought !
arises easily that the author of this dex
terous crime must have done some such j
thing before.
He had boasted by the hour, however,
of the beautiful Mrs. Genevieve Marks.
Mrs. Marks is a young woman of 25 or
thereabouts; a brunette, petite and at
tractive. He had been much in her com
pany and had talked of her continually
to his intimat?s. He would now turn ail j
this "to account â he would employ her
name with Dodge under which to pledge
the diamonds.
Dodge falls into this plan easily. He
will transact the business UDon.a warrant
from the lady herself. That was easily
done. Blanther writes the warrant in her
name. Dodge says it is sufficient, and all |
is ready. For four days then the young I
man looks his crime in the eyes, with- }
holding his stroke.
Night after ni-ht he visits the old j
woman, probably with his weapon in his !
pocket, plays cards with her, jests and
laughs and drinks her beer and estimates i
the value of her rings. Every morning he
tells Dodge that "to-morrow 1 will bring
those diamonds."
On Friday evening he did it. He had
taken a French dinner with Dodge, and
when be left him, perhaps nerved with his |
bottle of claret, he had said again: "I will ',
see you at ft o'clock in the morning; I am
going to San .fose with Mrs. Marks; I will
bring you those diamond?."
With that he went straight to Mrs.
Langfeldt's room. At 10 o'clock he heard I
Dr. Kleineberg in the hall and knew that j
he bad turned out the gas and retired. |
He waited half an hour longer. The cards
had been put away ; it was about his hour
to leave. The time had come. He stepped
behind the feeble old woman, placed his
left band unon her mouth, drew back her
head and with his right band drew his
razor-blade across her throat.
She sprang up. took a step forward and
he could not prevent the heavy fall of her
body that caused the man in the room
overhead to look up from his book with a j
quick heartbeat.
The murderer had placed ;his left hand j
too low and had cut it, and when he turned I
to throw the bolts on both doors he left
the marks of his bloody lingers there.
He did not touch the body again except
to strip the rings from the fingers. He
washed his hands in the basin, wiped
them on the towel, but could not stop the I
bleeding fingers.
He had engaged to meet Dodge at 9
o'clock in the morning and have the
diamonds with him. He must prevent
the murder being discovered until after
that hour that he might transact his busi
ness with him and get away.
He would leave the bolts on the doors
as they were; he would climb out of the
bay window and into the next window, a
thing easy to do, and into the hall by that
way.
He met Dodge, told him he had the dia
monds, Dodge fulfilled his contract, took
him to notebroker Lacy and secured a
check for $97, leaving two of the stones as
collateral.
They went to the bank and got the check
cashed, and while the newspapers wore
already putting in type the story of tb%
crime, they went carelessly down to the
ferry smoking their cigars.
Yesterday Captain Lees gave on t the
formal statement of George Dodge, the
essential points of which were published
yesterday in The Call.
In an interview yesterday, Dodge told a
Call reporter that the statements made to
the effect that Blanther did not shave
himself and did not have a razor were not
true. It was his habit to shave himself
every morning. He had a white-handled
razor.
Daniel Eisner, who knew Blanther in
Austria and was present at the time he
was decorated with the Iron Crown, has set
at rest all speculation as to the identity of
the man. Eisner did not know that
Hlanther was in the City, but, looking at
his portrait, he says: "This is Blanther;
this is the man I served with in the Aus
trian army."
But Eisner left the army years before
Blanther did and is unable to explain why
a man of such promise should be an out
cast in a foreign land. "He had been sin
gled out for distinction. I thought he
was a major in the army by this time."
"There must be some reason for his be
ing here in destitute circumstances," he
said. "A man with those decorations, had
he wished to make himself known to the
proper people, would have been placed in
a way of doing well anywhere in the
world."
But Bianther is still at large. That is
the important circumstance that remains.
Sheriff Cunningham is still chasing the
man on the wheel down by Stockton and
Captain Lees' men are watching every
avenue about the bay. But this man,
with manner, bearing and general appear
ance that would mark him anywhere in a
crowd, remains at large with the whole
country looking for him. The conclusion
is that he succeeded in getting far away
before the guards were well placed.
A BRAVE SOLDIER.
How Blanther Saved a Battalion of
Soldiers During the
War.
There is such a pretty story that is so
little in keeping with the horrible light in
which Blanther has been placed through
the murder of old Mrs. Phiippina Lang
feldt. It is the story of how he earned the
decoration of the iron crown.
The Order of the Iron Cross, created by
Frederick William 111 during the French
war of 1812-13, was again established as
the Order of the Iron Crown by William I,
son of Frederick William 111, out of
respect to his father, during the Franco-
Prussian war in 1870-71.
Tnere is no man to-day, no matter in
what position he may be placed, who can
not point to that cross of the Iron Crown
with justifiable pride, if be is entitled to
wear it, for it has never been accorded any
one who did not earn it by some deed of
valor.
Daniel Eisenberg, a cadet in the Aus
trian army, who is a resident of this City,
and who knew Blanther well, years ago,
tells the story.
"Blanther,"" he stated to a Call reporter,
"was studying at one military college
while I was studying at another. We en
tered the army, but after years he went
to the frpnt much faster than I did.
Owing to some family affairs I was
obliged to quit the service in five years as
a private.
"In the course of affairs in 1877, during
the war in Herzegovina, in the Balkans,
Blanther earned the decoration of the
Iron Crown. I was a soldier fighting in one
of the battalhohs and remember the occur
â  rence well.
"We had taken a fort from the ene
j my, and while the victory was still
warm and we were not looking for further
; hostilities the enemy suddenly and un
expectedly returned.
"We were unprepared and were about to
be overpowered, as we did. not have our
guns.
â¢â¢Blanther, although only a lieutenant,
was the only officer in charge of the fort,
and he knew of some Turkish-Moorish
] guns in the citadel. He was a well-poated
man, learned in the use of weapons, and
j with but a few men under his command,
but he handled th.Â»m with such general
ship that he protected our entire battalion
ana we were able to re-enter the fort with
out great loss of life.
"There were eighteen hours of hard
fighting with the mountain guns, that
never could have been carried on success
fully had not Blanther and dis men
; helped as out.
"That is how Joseph Blanther earned
j his decoration of the Iron Crown.
"He was decorated in Vienna upon the
J recommendation of Lieutenant - Colonel
j Ferdinand Bachner yon Egendorl.
"Ptoyal Archdufce Albrecut in person
conveyed the decoration to Blanther in
j the name of the Emperor and King, Fran
cis Josef, in 1878."
Another medal which Blanther held is
called the "War Medal." It was awarded
! to every soldier who fuught in the war of
1870-71.
Mr. Eisenberg, who gave these details,
was but a private in the Herzegovina war]
I but he, too, was decorated for acts of
I bravery on the field of battle. He was hi
one of the battalions protected by Lieuten
ant Blanther, and for particular acts of
i bravery he was decorated not only with
the "War Medal," but another silver one
as well.
Blauther was educated as a cadet at the
Wiener Neustadt near Vienna. He first
I entered the Thirty-second Infantry Retri-
I ment at Zara, Dalmatia.
A WOMAN'S FEAR.
Mrs. Marks Believes That She, In
stead of Mrs. Langfeldt, Might
Have Been Murdered.
Mr?. Marks, who, through the represen
tations and forgery of Joseph Blanther.
has been placed in an unenviable and un
called for position, is a very ill woman.
She was prostrated yesterday, but she
found strength enough to call at the office
of Captain Lees to tell her story as to her
relations with the suspected murderer
Blanther.
Mr?. Marks' condition is not altogether
due to sorrow for the notoriety she has at
tained, but is more the reaction brought
about by the thought that she, instead of
Mrs. Philippina Langfeldt, might have
been the victim of Blanther's or another's
murderous hanJ.
She, ioo, had diamonds, and many of
them. True enough, she seldom wore

them, but on a couple of occasions they
adorned her fingers and ears when Blan
ther was her guest.
These gems represented far more value
than did those Mrs. Langfplclt wore, and
the temptation must have been greater for
Blanther to resist.
Mrs. Marks, however, is quite a young
woman in comparison with the murdered
lady, and she did not fall an easy prey
under the blandishments of the ex-army
officer.
She received him at her rooms at 427
O'Farrel street on three or four occasions
only, and latterly she forbade him calling
again.
In explanation of this she told Captain
Lees yesterday:
"I met Mr. Blanther at the races some
five weeks ago. I went there at times and
always became interested in the horses
running.
"As one would imagine who knows any
thing about the excitement of a finish I
appealed to my neighbor on the grand
stand to tell me which horse was the win
ner. It was Mr. Blanther who answered
me. We conversed some more and by easy
stages we became acquainted.
"He appeared to be a thorough and
polished gentleman. He was interesting
"CONFESSION OF A MURDERER":
BY BLANTHER AND DODGE.
[It hna been remarked that inexperienced writer* of fiction invariably and unconsciously describe themselves and
their experience. Viewed in this ll^ht, the subjoined short "romance" by Blanthcr, the suspected murderer of Mrs.
I>angfeldt, â written in collaboration with his friend Dodge, will have peculiar interest at this time. The themeâ the cold
blooded murder of an unsuspecting woman â its flippant treatment and minute personal introspection, show the morbid
rend nf the author's mind. The main idea is not original, recalling Poe'l "The Keating Heart," and aping the grewsoma
horror of that production.]
Whatâ what have I done? Oh, the horror of this awful deed ! Murder? Ah, yes, murder! My
wifeâ l have murdered my wife!
I must write this awful confession, while the heads of perspiration stand out in deathly dampness on
my brow; while my brain seethes with madness. Write! The impulse to shriek out the awful agony of
my soul is nearly too great to be controlled. * * *
Oh, how I loved her ! Ah ! See where she lies, with her beautiful face upturned, horribly distorted ;
her tongue hangs out from between swollen, foam-flecked lips ; her eyes stareâ glassy, protruding, fear
ful ! See that white throatâ ah, those purple marks ! Cruel, fiendish, frenzied hands have clutched that
beautiful neck and choked her sweet life out !
There was no murder in my heart when but a short half hour ago I smoothed her dark, curling
tresses, kissed her sweet lips, now so swollen, so repulsive. Dearer to me than my soul, my wifeâ mine
only five short blissful monthsâ why, why did I do that awful thing!
My soul, filled with the poetry of life and love, sought expression in the tangible form which my pen
seems ever willing to portray. I bade my darling sleep. I drew my chair and table near to the sofa upon
which sue reclined, and with the warm perfume of her sweet kiss of pure and holy love upon my lips I
turned to my pleasant task to fill the sheet before me with the ardent fancies of my poet's soul.
Oh love! My dearest one, my own!
E'en though thou'rt ever near me. yet
1 am not satisfied-
I know thon lovest me, and me alone.
ft ithin my heart there cannot dwell regret,
Nor grief abide;
Yet still I yearn
Just then my wife snored ; my pen faltered. Again she snored.
Like swallows startled by a hawk my beautiful fancies scattered and were gone.
I strove to close my cars to the exasperating sound of the snores which now increased in frequency,
in volume and in diabolical variation ; I struggled to regain the divine inspiration that had so utterly de
serted me ; my impatience merged into despair. Desperately I endeavored to write the completion of my
interrupted verse.
No! Listen to them. Mocking, fiendish snores! I groaned aloud. Hell had opened to madden my
brain with the awful reverberations of the damned ! It was a saturnalia of sound. Horrible, ghoulish
forms of laughter seemed to people the room!
That was not my wife. No ! Back, back, thou cursed, damned fiend of hell that would destroy my
reason! Hal ha! ha 1 So you would drive me mad ! Would you? Mad! Ha! ha !ha !â a-a-h !
Gosh ! It was my wife. My wife ; and I have murdered her ! But how could I write poetry while she
snored?
as a conversationalist and I did not object
to his calling upon me at my home.
"He always behaved in a most proper
manner and he allowed me to gain the
impression that he was a man of means.
"After awhile his talk on theosophy and
the reincarnation of the departed began to
frighten me. He spoke of suicide as if it
were nothing but a sudden change from
this sphere to meet friends in Jupiter.
"1 did not like this and I suggested in a
mild but firm way that he cu-sist calling.
That is all I know of Mr. Blanther. His
last regular visit to me was on May 1.
I have not seen him since."
BLANTHER'S COMRADE.
He Makes an Official Statement of
His Connection With the
Case.
George Dodge, the associate of Joseph
Blanther and the man who, it has been
claimed, knew most about the Langfeldt
murder aside from the murderer himself,
on Tuesday told of his connection with the
affair, and his story was published in
yesterday's issue of this paper.
The young man was, as an innooent,
dragged into the case through his kind
feeling for a man he believed to be honor
able and well meaning but penniless.
He told how he assisted Blanther finan
cially, and how, at the last moment, he
acted as business agent in the disposing of
diamonds which it subsequently developed
had been stolen from the cold corpse of
Mrs. Philippina Langfeldt.
Since the full publication of Dodge's
statement, Captain Lees has decided to
present to the public the official one ob
tained by him from Dodge, which tells the
same story told in The Call, but .with
more detail. It is as follows:
I met Mr. Blanthcr at the residence of Mr.
Hogan, 222 llaight street, where he wrb room-
Ing and boarding at the time, about three
months ago. My acquaintance with him con
sisted of meeting and tailing with him at tne
house and meeting him downtown. He would
invite me to luucu with him and always
seemed to have lots of money and was very
generous and insisted upon paying for every
thing; nothing further though than lunches
and occasionally cigars. I became interested
in him when I learned that he was a news
paper and magazine writer, as I had some as
pirations In that line, and lie suggested several
times to take a room with him downtown, or
somewhere where it would be convenient, and
we could work together in our literary work
and that he would assist me all he could.
One day, about three weeks after I had met I
him, I went to Hogan's house and learned that
he had disappeared. I afterward learned that
he had given two checks to Miss Hogan and a
Mrs. Gilbert for $975, both of the cheeks being
bogus. His reason lor borrowing the money
was that he said he wanted to get to !>an Jose,
and that he expected money from -the East,
and that he also had several trunks with valu
able property iu4hem, which were to be deliv
ered as soou as he could pay the expressage.
I did not pay much more attention to him, ex
cept to inquire occasionally from the people
who claimed to have been taken in by him.
Mv memory as to the lime 1 firstmethim
and after he bad disappeared is not very c.. r .
tain. I met him on Montgomery street one
day, and I was surprised to see him. He said
he had been to Portland. He told me he had
had some financial trouble; that he had bor
rowed some money from theHogans; that he
did not like to go out to the house until he had
the money to pay them. He told me he had
just come out of Tebbs' office, the artist on the
Examiner, and he said he was broke and had
no money at all, so I invited him to my office
and afcenvard took him out to lunch, and left
him, and he said he would call at the office
again to see me, and he has been calling ever I
since up to last Saturday morning.
I learned from Tebbs that he had taken a
camera from him and that Tebbs had employed
one of the Morse detectives to get it back for
him. He did not get the camera back, Blan
ther stating that he always left it at different
places. I looked out for Blanther to see that
he got his dinner and tried to encourage him
as much as I could. He told me he was then I
living hi Oakland in a room and that he
needed some money to get his things over
here and get another room in the Citr, saying
he would do a great deal of work. I suggested
that he should come over and I would do all I
could to find him work; that I knew the
editors of the three daily papers, and that I
could take his work up ip them Rnd try to pet
| them to take it. Xnne of his stories were pub
lished. Two ttiat had been sent to the Argo
naut and Chronicie were sent back as una
vailable. 1 knew that his work was not the
right kind of work for the San Francisco
papers. I began to be discouraged about him
ana say he could not earn anything by news
paper work, and I was in uo position "to help
! him because I had no money. He had brought
to the office one day a set of art works in
j editions which he claimed cost him $40, but I
knew them to be worth about $1 a number
ana there were nineteen numbers.
I went to artists on The Call and Examiner
and tried to sell them, and told Tebbs that it
was a case of a starving man and if he could
buy them to do so, but none of them nad any
money. I showed them to Bugbee, my collabo
rater in the office, and he told me he would
givo Blanther $5 for them, and that he would
give them back to him at the same price, as he
did not wish to take advantage of him. The
monÂ«'y he obtained from the sale of these
th ings he paid for his room rent at the house 838
Geary street. With the rest of the ."Â£5 he bought
his meals and tobacco. He insisted upon my
taking some of the money, which I retused to
do. HfÂ» afterward became broke again and
brought down a standard dictionary in two
volumes that were entirely new, and he sold
them to a Mr. Lacey lor $5. He would noi
come into the place to sell it to Mr. Lacey and
asked me to do it. I insisted afterward about
his corning up, as Mr. Laeey wanted to deal
with him about them and about the necessity
j for having the money. Lacey told him he
I would give him $5 and Blanther could have
them back any time within three months for
the price of $7 50. With that money he paid
another week's board and more meals. After
that he brought down another dictionary,
which he asked me to sell for anything he
could get, as he was hungry and needed his
dinner. I took the dictionary and kept it, as I
found that no one would give him more than
25 cents for it. I gave him $1 5O and told him
I had disposed of it. He had given up writing
for the papers, as he said it was no use â that
they did not appreciate his work here.
When he found that he could not get any of
his work in the newspapers he snid he would
do something that would get himself in the
newspapers, and said he would shoot himself
or shoot somebody else, and he said he would
give me a chance to write it up in the papers.
He said, 'You wait a little and something will
happen,' and his conversation would con
tinually drift to that subject. My object in
going to his room so often was that I was
afraid he would do something desperate, as
Tebbs liHd warned me he had attempted to
shoot himself with a pistol and that Tebbs had
taken the pistol away from him. Blanther
said he had been everywhere: had been South
and in India, and told me that he hadÂ«een
service; told me he fought in the Austrian-
Turkish war; that he was either a lieutenant
or captain ; his picture was taken as lieutenant
of hussars. Stated he had been in Denver and

came from Denver here. He receives letters
from a friend in Denver; that friend was now
in Chicago. Snid inn family were fine people
and that his father was dead. He said he was
on the engineering corps and got to writing
for some European papers, writing reports of
the operations of the civil engineer; that they
published his writings, and that led him to

Ue told me he would write to a friend in the
New York Central Railroad and have a pass
sent out here for himself, and that he would
get back to New York and take a position in
the New York Central, where he had been em
ployed as a civil engineer for eight or nine
years. He said there was a position there at
any time for him. He wanted me to go with
him, and told me he could get a pass for me if
I wanted to go , aiu i to humor him I said I
might go, although I knew he would neverget
the pass.
When I first met him Blanther would often
talk of a lady thut he had met At the racetrack,
where _ he had gone just to pass the time. He
said she was a widow and was a vry flne-look
lnKwoman; that he had met her there and she
had become attracted to him. and that the at
traction was mutual. He spoke of this lady as
Mrs. Marks, and said he visited her nearly
every evening, and he seemed very anxious to
keep from her the fact of his straitened cir
cumstances. At last, when he found that his
resources had failed him, about a week ago,
ne spoke of the possibility of getting her to
raise money enough for him to go out to the
track and play the races, claiming he was in
the way of getting sure tips, that would make
his winning a certainty. He stated to me that
in case she could not raise the money she
naa a great numberof diamondsâ that she was
very anxious to win money on the races, and
| would borrow money on her diamonds if I
I could arrange to get it for her, and told me at
the time of the importance of not having her
name mentioned in the transaction of borrow
ing the money.
Being anxious to help him in any way,
and supposing the proposition was a leeiti
mate one coming from her and suggested by
her I told him that 1 could possibly raise the
I money for him through Mr. Lacey, the gentle
! man I had dealings with, and he told me he
would bring the diamonds down the next day,
whieti was about last Tuesday. He told me
he called on her every evening, and he would
come to me in the morning and tell me of the
great difficulty of his getting the diamonds.
1 did not care myself, as I did not care to enter
into any such transactions, but I had con
j sented to see this party and see what I could
j do for him. Yesterday morning he came to
j the office with two diamonds, which I took to
Mr. Lacey and showed him, and was told by
Lacey that he would give $100 for them.
Blanther was waiting outside, and he told to
take anythingâ if possible to get $175 for
them, if not to take $100. I tooK $100 in a
I check, which at 10 o'clock we cashed at the
! Bank of British North America.
I <lid so, and handed the money to Blanther.
I He insisted on giving me $5, in part payment

â¢ From there we immediately walked to the

for Oakland. I was going to Alameda. I left

How Lacy Lent the Money.
The statement of Lacy, the money-lender,
corroborates Dodge. It is is as follows :
Pan Francisco, May 20, 1896.
Captain Leer, City: To the best of my recollec
tion the particulars of my transaction with
Mr. Dodge (whom I have known several years)
are as follows : On the 14th of May Dodge called
on me and asked me whether I would lend
some money to a lady on her diamonds, and I
replied that 1 objected to such loans as being
out of my line of business. On the 15th he
| called again, and after much persuasion 1
agreed to make a loan provided that he would
bring me a letter from the person owning the
property authorizing him to make the loan.
On the lÂ«th he came, bringing a letjter
j signed by a Mrs. Marks of I think 515 Geary
street; I made the loan, and the property is
now in your possession. Yours truly,
H. Lacy.
A Sttapect Near Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 20. â Charles
Thompkins. who cooks for H. p. Eldred's
hired men at his barns just east of the city,
reported to Sheriff Cunningham that
shortly after 10 o'clock this morning, while
on the road, he was hailed by a man riding
a wheel who looked exactly like the pub
lished pictures of Blanther. The man
asked Thompkins the way to Milton, bat
did not stop to catch the cook's answer as
he rode by. At that time he was making
for the Linden road instead of toward
Milton.
He wore a snit of bine overalls over a
black suit, which confirms the story told
yesterday by J. Rotschild. Sheriff Cun
ningham at once telephoned to Milton
and then ordered his team, driving out
along the road the man was said by
Thompkins to have taken. The Sheriff
thought that if the man was not an ex
pert rider he woula be forced to stop along
the road and he could thus overtake him
before he got far.
The man stopped at the Occidental
Hotel in this city last night. The officers
are still looking for him.

THE IMPROVEMENT
CLUBS IN LEAGUE
A Permanent Organization
Perfected Last
Night.
CONSTITUTION ADOPTED.
Officers Elected and Standing
Committees Estab
lished.
EXTENSIVE WORK OUTLINED.
A Stirring Resolution Adopted Rela
tive to Schools and Their
Facilities.
A federation of the several district im
provement clubs of the City was formed
at B'nai B'rith Hall last night.
Twenty-one of the thirty odd clubs in
existence were represented. George R.
Fletcher presided and F. Johnson filled
the office of secretary.
The reading and discussion of the con
stitution and by-laws took up an hour,
and the earnestness of the debate empha
sized the interest taken in the new move
ment. The purpose of the federation, as
set forth in the constitution, is first, the
development of the outside districts, and
second, the harmonious working of all or
ganizations looking to the general ad
vancement of the City's "residential
interests.
Standing committees, to be filled at the
next meeting, were provided for as fel
lows: Streets, parks and sewers, street
railways, law, legislation and public ac
tion, public worts and buildings, etc.
All improvement clubs must have fif
teen members to be eligible to member
ship in the federation.
The quarterly dues are $1 50 from each
club, and the dues must be paid promptly
to insure recognition of delegates from the
auxiliary clubs.
The name is the San Francisco Associa
tion of Improvement Clubs.
The meeting night is the first Wednes
day of each month.
Permanent officers were elected as fol
lows: James I). Phelan, president; George
H. Fletcher, first vice-president; A. B. Ma
trnire, second vice-president; I. Schwartz,
recording secretary; J. Maloney, corre
sponding secretary; t\ W. M." Lange,
treasurer; P. Cahill, sergeant-at-arms.
Dr. Rottanzi, A. P. Van Duzer and F.
W. McEwen were appointed a finance
committee.
The final action of the new federation
before adjourning was the adoption of the
following resolutions of J. H. Grady by
unanimous vote:
Whereas, The necessity and advantage of
the hipher education must be manifest to all
and the facilities for the same shouM be
within.the reach of the humblest in our midst;
that a high school course for his children
should be the ambition of every parent and
that love of country, patriotism and all that
goes to make up the good citizen are encour
aged and fostered by education in the higher
branches Is an undeniable truth.
Whereas, that section of this City embracing
the Eleventh Ward, comprising in area about
two-thirds of this municipality, and paying
taxes upon an assessed valuation of nearly
$100,000,000, and furnishing fully 35 per cent
of the enrolled pupils of the public schools, is
practically denied the privileges of a higher
education, by reason of the location of the
various high schools of this City, the nearest
and most convenient for girls being located on
Geary and Scott streets, tolly three miles
distant from the corner of Twenty-sixth and
Valencia street, the central point of the dis
trict.
The time consumed in travel, tho consequent
fatigue, to say nothing of the expenee in car
fare, would seem to appeal to every fair
minded citizen of the absolute necessity of a
hit;h school for this section of the City.
Unless our children are afforded a reasonable
opportunity to continue their education in the
higher departments many of them, by reason
of the existing hard times, must be debarred
the privileges extended to pupiis residing in
more favored locations.
Whereas, The Mission Hieh School Club and
the Mission Improvement L'nioa are uniting
in an appeal to the Honorable Board of Super
visors for an appropriation sufficiently large
to build and fully equip a hign school "for the
Mission ; therefore, be it
Resolved. That we, the San Francisco Asso
ciated Improvement Clubs, pledge them our
undivided support, and with them join in ask
ing that their request be granted.
ALAMEDA CITY A WINNER.
Judge Frick Dissolves the In
junction Suit This After
noon.
The Woman's Death Still Shrouded
In Mystery and Unidenti
fied.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 20.â This morn
ing the last official act of Judge Frlck as a
bachelor was to dissolve the notorious in
junction suit against the city, so allowing
it to complete its electric-light works. A
carload of machinery, including the dy
namo, exciter and other electrical appa
ratus, arrived last night from Pittsfield,
Mass. It will be unloaded at once and set
in position by the contractors, John Mar
tin <fc Co. of San Francisco.
The City Morgue's Dead.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 20.â The mys
tery deepens surrounding the unfortunate
woman who met her death some time near
midnight last Sunday and whose body
was discovered on the beach on Monday
water-sogged.
J. W, Johnson, the skipper of the Ann
Eliza, accompanied by his wife and step
daughter, a bricht voting lady of eighteen
summers, viewed the body this evening.
It was unknown to any of them.
No action has yet been taken to subpena
any of the Columbus' crew for the inquest
to-morrow and the question arises was
there a scow in ahead of the Ann Eliza
and Columbus that left before the Ann
iiiiza got in.
The body of the man lying at the morgue
was identified late iast night by his sister
in-law as Patrick Cahill. Mrs. Edward
Cahill lives at 3216 San Pablo avenue, Oak
land. She says he was eccentric and subject
to apoplectic seizures. He had formerly
dabbled in stocks and lost his all. Of late
years he had acted as a hotel waiter and
porter. An inquest will be held to-mor
row.
Education Board.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 20.â Only three
members were in attendance at the Edu
cation Board's meeting last night. The su
perintendent reported that the net pro
ceeds from the late entertainment in Ar
?"jry Hall given by the High School were
v - 20 -^ Dr< Scott - the Principal, was au
thorized to expend the same in the pur
chase of suitable books for the school
library.
Attention was also drawn to the fact that
26 per cent of the children of school age do
not attend the public schools. Superinten
dent Sullivan said that the education act
of 1874, page 351, made attendance at school
between the ages of 8 and 14 compulsory
for two-thirds of each school year, and
entailed tines for non-compliance.
At the request of the Women's Relief
Society it was decided to grant a half holi
day on the afternoon of Friday, May 29.
County Superintendent Garlick reportp'l
he had set aside $6601 80 for the Alamtda
school department.
The Democrats Bestir Themselves.
ALAMEDA, Cal,, May 20.â The Demo
crats have announced that the roll will be
open from to-day till June 1 at 1319 Park
street, and that a primary will be held at
Tucker's Hall on Friday, June 5.
CRUSHED BY THE CARS.
A Child of Misfortune Killed by a
Freight Train.
OAKLAND, Cal., May iO.â Frank Coak
ley a lad 15 years of ace, was run over by
a freightcar this afternoon and died to
night at the Receiving Hospital.
The boy was crossing the foot or Chest
nut street and had waited for the San Joso
local to pass. After it had gone by Couk
iey ran around the rear of the train ana
was struck fly a single car that had been
shunted off by a yard engine. Coakley
did not see it till too late to stop, and was
caught by tlie wheels and dragged a lon^
distance. He was fearfully crushed and
never regained consciousness.
Coakley is a child of misfortune. When
he was 11 years of age he was cruelly
treated, and was cared for by Agent Theo
bald of the Humane Society. Prosecution
followed, and since then the boy has had
good treatment.
NEW TO-PAT:
WILL YOU BE
STRONG WHEN
YOU ARE OLD ?
As you would protect your
house against the wearing of
the storm so that it will be pre-
served and suitable- to shelter
you when you grow old, so you
ought to guard your physical
body against the inroads of
disease, so that it will be healthy
and well preserved when you
are an old man.
When you are young and the
! forces of nature active you can
; often smother these light pains
I and weaknesses that trouble
! you, but in doing so you have
i to call up your reserve vitality.
! That is a nail in your coffin, for
it wastes your reserve force,
which should be saved till you
grow old. It is this reserve
force which keeps up the health
in old â when they are
healthy.
Every man wastes this force
more or less. Sometimes he
| wastes all of it, and instead of
finding his weakness when he is
old it comes on him while he is
still a young man.
His life, from that time is
miserable â devoid of the power
of manhood, ruined nerve
power, and finally lost memory
and mental imbecility â he be-
comes a wreck.
This is a pitiable state of
human waste. Thousands of
young men have sown the seeds
for it by excesses and other
causes, but it can all be cured if
good judgment is used in time.
As the power lost is of the
nerves â nerve foree â it can be
replaced by Electricity, the life
of the nerves.
"I could dance with joy when
I consider that I have been
saved from the necessity of liv-
ing the rest of my life in that
miserable state," says J. A. J.
Morse, Los Gatos, Cal., after
using Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt one month.
Have you not noticed how
many people speak well of Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt? "I
have heard a great many people
recommend your Belt," says a
recent letter.
It is the' modern cure. It ig
the only cure for weak men, for
medicine has long ago proven
its worthlessness. Dr. Sanden's
Belt gives new life, drugs sim-
ply benumb the crying nerves.
If you want life get Dr. San-
den's Belt at once. It will not
fail you. The little book,
"Three Classes of Men," is worth
$100 to any weak man. It will
be sent free by mail, sealed
closely, upon application.

ALLOWED TO CUT RATES.
Effect of a Peculiar Resolution
of the Transcontinental
Association.
KAILBOAD MEN ARE GRINNING.
The Result of Trying to Settle the
San Francisco-Portland
Rate War.
Railroad men are just now enjoying the
humors of tne situation created by the
action of the Transcontinental Passenger
Assoc.ation on the last day of its session,
vhen it passed the following resolution:
That Messrs. Goodman and Hurl
buri I'.iuted a committee to endeavor, if
restore rates between San Fran
cisco and Portland, and in, the meantime other
BO action, pending settlement of
, without due notice to the asso
ciation.
Considering the fact that the gentlemen
named are the respective general passenger
agents of the roads which are engaged in
tae San Francisco-Portland rate war, and
that the matter of the adjustment of the
existing difficulties has long ago passed
from tueir hands into those of their s>u-
I riors, the resolution is looked upon by
all railroad men, and even by the two Â«en
tenien composing the committee, as in
tne nature of a "high jinks" proceeding.
Mr. Hurlburt, wnen asked what he pro
posed to do in the matter, remarked with
an evident appreciation of Ibe humorous
absurdity of the situation: ''Oh, i snail
await the pleasure of the chairman of the
committee. Whenever Mr. Goodman is
ready, I will meet him."
Mr. Goodman's views of the matter were
even more terse and expressive. "Bun
combe !M! M was his only reply to a ques'ion
as to what the effect of the association's
resolution would be.
And thus the matter stands, with a
settlement as far off as ever, but with a
decided advantage gained by the ageres
sive and daring competitor ot the Southern
Pacific Company.
Just before the session of the Trans
continental Passenger Association began,
the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany gave notice that it would at once use
the cut rate between nere and Portland as
a basing rate for Eastern business. This
enabled it to quote a rate of $ 42 50 via
Portland to St. Paul, as against the $47 90
in effect on all other roads.
All other roads interested bad the right
by agreement among themselves to meet
this rate if they cno'-e. but none did so, in
view of the near approach of the associa
tion's meeting, at which it was expected
that the association would effertnaliv
bring peace and harmony out of existing
war and discord.
But the resolution adopted by the asso
ciation, while it will accomplish nothing
toward bringing about a settlement of the
local rate war, has tied the hands of all
the roads except the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company so far as making a
cut rate to Eastern points is concerned. It
will be seen that the resolution pledges all
the lines to stand by inactive "pending
settlement of this question."
While the local railroad world is still
wondering over the significance of the
peculiar resolution the Oregon Railway
and Navigation people are chuckling in
their sieeves over the position they have
been placed in ana which gives them the
exclusive right to quote the $42 50 rate to
bt. Paul and common points.
PIONEER CLUB REGATTA.
It Will Be Held on the Channel
Course, Without Fail,
on June 9
Their New Yacht, the Sam Vincent,
Will Be Launched on May
26 at Long Bridg?.
Now that all the prominent yacht clubs
on the other side of the bay have had their

auspicious manner, the Pioneer Yacht
Club, formerly the Bilge-water Yacht
Club, of this City will drop into line with
the rest and help give the yachting season
of 1896 a healthy impetus.
On the 9th of next month they will hold
their opening day and annual regatta.
Their boat?, which all have their moor
ings on this side of the bay, are being ex
tensively overhauled for the occasion.
They will cruise in squadron on June 9

clam bake will be held to lend zest to the
occasion.
The fleet will sail in the regatta in re
spective classes, the smaller yachts start
ing lirst and the larger ones bringing up

elected the following officers for the en
smngyear: President, H. F. Hartman;
dJ?r." P^ sldent ' Charles Trump; commo
dore, George Enjrels; vice-commodore, J.
Â£Â«*y ; secretary, Walter Campfield ; official
measurer, William Metz. The yacht Vol
unteer was made the flagship for the sea
son.
ThecluDhas now a fleet of twenty-five
yachts. Among them. is the invincible
lorty-five footer Magic, owned by "Bob"
Gibson, which is the recognized" oeer of
boats of her class in the bay. Other boats
that are well known for their sailing quali
ties are: George Engel's Volunteer, Sam
Vincent's Pride, G. Lee's Mary and Wil
liam Healey's twenty footer Maud, w' ich
defeated a number of the crack fishing
Boats in a race to the Deads la3t Sunday.
The Pioneers will soon add another boat
to their present fleet. It will be the newly
constructed yacht Sam Vincent, named
after the pioneer boatman of the bay. She
will be launched from Long Bridge, where
she was built on the 26th inst. She is 36
feet over all. 31 feet on the water-line. 13
feet 6 inches beam and has a depth of 4
feet 8 inches.
Her keel and frame work are of well
seasoned oak. The keel is six inches thick
and twelve inches wide, an J the timbers,
which are steam bent, are three inches in
thickness and placed eight inches apart.
Amidships for a distance of six feet on
cacti side, the timbers are only four inches
apart, so that the boat can stand the
thumping agiinst a wharf. Her planKing
is of cedar, and 1% inches thick. She is
fatted with a spacious cabin sixteen feet
six inches long, and with a head room of
six feet four inches. She will carry a good
spread of canvas, the main boom is thirty
nine feet long, the gaff eighteen feet long,
and the hoist twenty-eight feet.
In addition to a mainsail and club top
sail, the boat will carry one jib thirty-live
feet long on the stay and twenty-six feet
on the foot.
William Rissland is the builder and
ojvner of the yacht, and her fine running
lines, from rather sharp forward to a
clean run aft, denote good sailing qualifi
cations.
Mr. Rissland has built several very fast
boats, the most notable are the Catherine
of the Corinthian Yacht Club, the Maud,
the fastest 20-foot boat on the bay, and
the Cucoo, the pride of Long Bridge, lie
has spread himself on the present craft
and expects her to hold her own with any
boat of her size on the bay, and one that
the Pioneers, of which club he is a promi
nent member, â will be proud of.
THAT BIG POULTRY BILL
Auditor Broderick and the
Finance Committee Have
Locked Horns.
The Board of Health Disclaims Re
sponsibility for County
Hospital Biils.
It developed at the meeting of the Board
of Health yesterday that the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
and Auditor Broderick have locked horns,
though in a friendly way, over toe ques
tion whether or not the Auditor has a
legal right to withhold his signature from
warrants that have been passed by the
committee as correct.
The matter under consideration was the
bill of a ponltry firm for fowls furnished
the City and County Hospital.
For years the custom has been to allow
the institution $25 per month for poultry,
and past Superintendents have apparently
been satisfied with that sum. The present
administration, however, has been con
tractina bills far in excess of $25 per
month, and a short time ago the matter
came up at a meeting of the Finance Com
mittee and the expert of tne Supervisors
was seat to the Auditor's otfiee to ascer
tain how much nad been spent in that
line. His report apparently satisfied the
members of the committee that the ex
penditure of from $50 to $75 per month for
poultry was extravagant and that the
Superintendent's table must be faring ex
ceedingly well in the way of delicacies.
Chairman Taylor at that time stated
that theieafter the ponltrv bill would be
limited to $25 per month. "When the ac
counts for April were presented the poul
try dealer t^ad a bill for $60, but for some
reason the committee did not holu up the
demand, and it was signed and sent to the
Auditor. Then a member, who had not
previously taken a hand, asked the Auditor
to hold the warrant until it could be as
certained whether the fowis were used for
making nourishing broths for the inmates
of the hospital, or whether the Superin
tendents table was getting the benefit.
The matter was referred to the Board of
Health, but that body refused to say any
thing on the subject beyond the statement
that it did not come under their jurisdic
tion, and that the amount of the bills must
be determined by the Board of Supervis
ors. The matter now rests between the
latter body and the Auditor.
TO FIGHT INDIANS.
Three Mission Boys Start Off on a Dime-
Novel Expedition.
Three boys, attending the Mission Gram
mar School, started off on Monday with
the avowed intention of fighting Indians,
and their anxious parents have asked the
assistance of the police to bring them back
and save them from losing their scalps.
The boys are Georec Seitrle, Twelfth and
Howard streets; Harry Russell, Howard
street near Twelfth, and Thomas Prender
gast, 9Â£6>Â£ Minna Btreeu The oldest is 14
years.
Seigle had arrived with his parents only
a week or two ago from Germany and Rus
sell lately came from CaÂ«troville. Seiule
provided the necessary funds for the expe
dition by stealing $20 from his parents.
Before goinp they told some ol the other
scholars that they were going to hunt for
Indians and would return wilh the s-calps
of several Indian braves hanging to their
belts. They will get a good spanking
when they return home.
The annual increase of the German na
tion during the last five years has been
more than five times as much as that of
the French.

PROMINENT SPIRITUALISTS TO CONVENE.
attended business meeting was held at 110
Hayes street, at which final arrangements
were made for the grand reception to deie
eates and local spiritualists, which win be
held on Saturday night.
To-day, Harrison D. Barrett, president
of the National Spiritualist Association of
Washington, D. C, will arrive in this
City, and nothing will be neglected which
can make his welcome a pleasant and rep
resentative one. The presiaent will be
met at the station, on bis arrival, by a
special reception committee, consisting of
Mrs. J. J. Whitney, Mrs. Mary Deyman
and Airs. E. Sloper.
In the evening a grand reception* to
Mr. Barrett has been planned at
the St. Nicholas Hotel. The seven incor
porated spiritualist societies of this City
will all be represented, and their presi
dents will make a special point of attend
ing. The following ladies and gentlemen
are expected to mate addresses at to
night's reception: William M. Rider, Dr.
H. C. Rines, Mrs. Mary Deyman, H. C.
Wadsworth, t T . T. Jones, George I. Drew,
John Slater, and Mrs. J. J. Whitney.
At the reception to delegates on Satur
day night, at 110 Hayes street, all t.e
Spiritualists in the City are expected to be
present. An excellent musical and lit
erary programme has been arranged and a
decorating committee, of which Mrs.
Robinson is president, is making exten
sive preparations for beautifying the hall
with flae;s, ferns and flowers.
Among the members of the reception
committee, of which Mrs. Ait*en is presi
dent, arc: Mrs. E. E. Drew, Mrs. N. Nevill,
Mrs. Young, Mrs. Bell, Mrs. R. Parker,
Mrs. Slocum. Mrs. E. 0. Griffin, Mr 3. G.
W. Shriner, Mrs. D. N. Place, president of
the Spiritualistic Ladies' Aid bociety, and
Messrs. Meekm an<l Garrison.
Delegates are expected to be present
from the spiritualist societies of Stockton,
San Jose, Santa Cruz, Vallejo and a num
ber of the other interior towns of this
State.
There are seven incorporated societies of
spiritualists in San Francisco, and the
convention, which is called by their united
action, will be actively participated in by
them all. The seven societies were all
represented at the business meeting yes
terday, and enthusiasm was expressed by
all the representatives for the promised
success of the convention. The opinion
â¢was also expressed that every organization,
medium and spiritualist in the City and
State was willing to help the convention
along.
The convention opens in Golden Gate
Hall next Sunday, and it will remain in
session over Monday and Tuesday. There
will be music and literary exercises, in ad
dition to the business of the convention,
which is Btated to be the cause of the
United Spiritualist Fraternity. H. D. Bar
rett will be the chief speaker, but a num
ber of other distinguished speakers will
also participate in the proceedings. Among
them are: J. Cleerg Wright, who has a
reputation as an inspirational speaker and
teacher both in England and in this coun
try. He has been sneaker for the First
Progressive Spiritualist Society in this City
for the past live months and is too well
known to the spiritualists of San Fran
cisco to need any commendation at pres
ent.
Charles Dawbarn is widely known for
his pronounced eloquence, his scientific
learning and bis clear, logical reasoning
in every part of the Union, having been a
speaker be tore the different spiritualist
societies East and camp-meeting gatner
ings for years. Mr. Dawbarn was"calied"
to San Francisco to minist rto the First
Progressive Spiritualist Society of this City
several years since and, becoming en
amored with California, he purchased a
tract of land near San Leandro and is one
of its famous fruit-raisers and a citizen of
the State.
John Brown, "the medium of the Rock
ies," and the oldest living medium on the
coast, is living in San Francisco and is
hale and hearty at the age of 76 years, hav
ing been born in tne old Bay State in 1817.
He is a natural medium and long before
the time of the Rochester rappings, while
a young man trapping for furs In the
Rocky Mountains, the strange raps that
accompanied his presence attracted the
curiosity oi his companions aud earned
for him among his friends tne sobriquet of
"The Wizard." John Brown was also a
clairvoyant and to him, at times, coming
events cast their shadows before. In his
published experiences many facts of sec
ond sight are recorded. The book is edited
by Professor J. S. Loyeland of Summer
land and is as interesting as it is strange.
THE COMING FAIR
A Large Niagara Falls of Red Wine
Will Be I x dibit, v.
The coming "home industry" fair of the
Mechanics' Institute and Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association is creating
great interest not only among the business
men of the City, but throughout the State.
Already there are nearly 100 applications
for space, and at the present rate of appli
cations the big pavilion will not be able
to accommodate all who will want| to
make exhibits.
Among the exhibits will be two which
will attract much interest. One will be a
large model of The Call building, now :n
process of construction on Market and
Third streets. The miniature structure
will extend toward the roof of the Pavilion
to a height of fifty feet and wili occupy a
floor space of ten feet square. The model
will be lighted by electricity.
Th.- other exhibit will be a miniature
Niagara uf claret. The lines of. the great
waterfall will bo preserved and the flow of
wine will be continuous. As fast as it falls
the claret will be pumped into the reser
voir back of the head of the falls. The
stream above the falls will be spanned by
a bridge. The exact size of this display
has not yet been decided, but it is likely
that the "falls will extend from the gallery
to the main floor.
An electric fountain similar to the one
at the Midwinter Fair, but smaller, will
occupy the center of the Pavilion, and
it will be Jtept in operation while the fair
lasts.
The industries will not be overlooked in
the general display of pretty and unique
exhibits- Clothing, boots, shoes, brushes,
glassware, jewelry, leather b*lting, rubber
foods, wood novelties, etc., will be made
aily, thus affording an object lesson to
tne public never before presented on this
coast.
Starch or Tapioca.
Special Commissioner Siiirtliff has been ap
pointed by the Circuit Court to take evi
dence relating to the application of Col
lector Wise for a review of the de
cision of the United States General Ap
praisers regarding the classification of the
various articles made from tapioca. Under
the present ruling there is no duty on sago,
sago flour and arrowroot. The Collectoi con
tends, however, that these articles are really
diftVren! forms of Chinese starch, used almost
exclusively by Chinese laundries, and not
tapioca as "decided by the Appraisers. Tapioca
is admitted free oi duty. About $300,000 in
the way of back, duty is involved in the pres
ent litigation.
VIBRATION AND SOUND
By Them Countess Waichtmeister
Says the Universs Was
Begun.
Interesting Lecture en "A Conscious
Universe and the Evolution
of Man."
Countess Wachtmeister lectured to a
crowded house in Colomu Hall Tuesday
evening on the subject of "A Conscious
Univer>e and the Evolution oi Man."
She began with the creation. Her ex
planation of the beginning of the material
world, her reasons fur its being brought
into existence and many other subjects
treated by her differ widely from both the
scientific and orthodox ideas on these sub
jects.
"Spirit and consciousness mean the
same thing," she said. "The universe is
the manifestation of suirit, in conjunction
with primordial matter. Matter had its
origin in vibration and sound.
"Both are the positive and negative
sides in manifestation of absolute con
sciousneso.
"The universe was broucht into mani
festation for the purpose that the spirit,
which is perfectly pure in itself, should
gain the particular kind of knowledge
which matter can give it. It then passes
through the mineral, vegetable and ani
mal forms, and as it pierces through tnese
TCrious kinds of manifestations conscious
ness widens and expands, so that when it
reaches the human form it has become
powerful instinct.
"Thon, when the human form is ready,
the divine spirit fructifies the germ in tlie
brain, which hitherto has been latent, and
in the fructification reason begins.
Through a Jonit course of births and re
births that reason gradually augments
and expands until at last it reaches to the
higher reason, then intuition, then spirit
ual intuition, and finally the divine, where
it is at one with the Deity and truly a Son
of God."
On Sunday afternoon the Countess will
lecture in Native Sons' Hdll on the "Social
Evils of the Day."

the Rocky Mountains is 30.08 inches and the
lowest pressure, excepting in .Arizona 29.96 inches,
or a rang" of 0.12 inches. Such an even pressure

ing the past twenty-four hours over the entire
Pacific Slope.
The temperature has remained nearly stationary
over the entire country west of the Rocky Moun

there has been a rise of about 10 degrees in the
past 24 hours. The temperature is still from 3 to
Â« dearees below the normal for this time through
out California.
The weather has been generally cloudy over the
Pacific slope, except along the coast from Rose

of stocks were 119.K50 shares. >uÂ«arrulel weak
until near the close, when it suddenly spurt.-d 2-'- 4
to 132*4* Tne ea rly weakness was due to shori
short selling by local bean, who professed to be
greatly disturbed by the further reduction of i/g in
the prici- of refined and the report of poor trade
conditions. At the decline, however, one Broad
way concern which usually trades for the leading
opt-rators, purchased nearly 5000 shares of the
stock and there started buying tor no:h accounts.
The rapidity of the advance* alarmed the shorts and
on their ertorls to cover they bid prices up on
them selves.
1 he railway list during the morning session was
steady to firm, but subsequently the market dis
played weakness and then drifted Into dullness.
London was a moderate seller of certain stocks,
but bought a few bonds. Its operations, however,
had no influence on the market. The engagement
of 9500.000 gold for shipment to Europe to
morrow and the belief thai further amounts will
be forwarded Saturday was offset by semi-official
sta ements that Mr. Morgan has placed important
blocks of railway bonds in London. The market
in the last half hour of business showed a little
more life, the sharp rally in sugar having 3: art ed
up a better inquiry lor the general list.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111, May 19.â Shorts and bad crop
reports from some winter wheat States, notably
Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, gave wheat prices
assistance to-day. The firmness came after a
rather easy operating, which was due to predic
tions of showers throughout the entire Western
country. The bears are disposed to proceed with
a certain degree of caution, and on any unusual
amount of crop damage stories take no chances,
but cover without questioning the accuracy or
veracity of the information. There seemed to be
these features this morning, and very little buying
was done.
Receipts were moderate at 111 cars and 63,404
bushels were taken from store. The Northwest
had 238 cars against 262 last Wednesday and 178
a year ago. Liverpool cables quoted a steady mar
ket at V*d decline. Export clearances were licht
at 116,934 bushels. Closing Berlin and Paris cables
were higher. Antwerp was unchanged. July wheat
opened from 61 1 Â«c to 61Jygc,sold between 613 8 c
and 62Â«/ge to Wlifcc, closed at 62c to 621 8 s- c to
%c higuer than yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow 7 cars.
CORNâ Was, as customary, neighborly In its
action, accepting the lone of wheat as its govern
ing motive. It is not expected that corn w: 1 exert
its dependence in the near future. Business to
day was very light and the session was an ordinary
One in every sense. Receipts were 151 cars anil
387,835 bushels were withdrawn from store.
Liverpool cables were quiet. Export clearances
amounted to 256,938 bushels. July corn opened
at 29 Vic, sold at /8 p, closing at the latter, a
shade over yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow. 255 cars.
OATSâ Derived encouragement from the better
tone of wheat, but trade was too small to attract
attention or cause interest to betaken. Receipts
were 174 cars and 18,862 bushels were taken from
store. Export clearances were but 150 bushels.
July oats closed unchanged. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 185 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 88% c; July, 88VÂ»c;
September, 87c bid. Receipts 3 cars.
PROVISIONSâ Hog receipts were away and be
yond extravagant estimate*. Forty thousand ar
rived and the enormous inrtux bad the effect of de
pressing prices at the yards 10c. Under the cir
cumstances products suffered depreciation. Every
thing declined on selling prompted by the hog
market. July closed 15@17 Iy*jc1 y *jc lower, July lard
7 1 -0 lower and July ribs iOc lower.

Shakenpeare a Mason.
Dr. Orville \V. Owen of Detroit has sent
out a little book addressed to the Masonic
fraternity, in which he says: "In deciph
ering the Shakespearian plays (1623 folio
edition) and other works of Bacon, for the
preparation of 'Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher
Story,' I have found unmistakable evi
dence that the author of them was not
only a Mason of high degree, but that he
placea in the plays a large portion of the
Masonic ritual. Believing this to be of the
greatest interest and importance to the
brotherhood the following parts of the
plays, with the places from which they
come, are now given to the order. Under
standing fully the obligations under which
I rest as a Mason (of the seventh degree),
I have taken pains to hide the work that
none but the brethren will understand.
Francis Bacon, the author of the plays,
was a Master Mason, and claims to have
been grand master of the Orient and a
Rosicrucian knicht, and hidden within
his works are directions by which it is not
; difficult to travel into Illyria."
The Brilliant Idiot.
It was on the 5 o'clock accommodation
on the Boston and Maine. He was a green
brakeman â greener than grass at this time
of yearâ and It was his first run over the
road. At Somerville he woke old Spette
grew out of his every-afternoon nap by
announcing "Chelsea!" and a little later,
when they stopped at East Everett, he
paralyzed old lady Petti John by proclaim
ing "Prides Crossing!" But the climax
was reached when the train arrived in
Lynn.
When the veteran brake-twister on the
front platform threw open the door with a
bang, and, with a familiarity born of years
of experience, rattled off, "Lynn! Lynn!
Change cars for East Lynn, Swampscott,
Phillips Beacn, Beach Bluff, Clifton,
Devereaux and Marblehead ! Lynn!
Lynn!" the brilliant idiot on the rear "plat
form Doked his heaa in the other door and
shouted, "Same here!" â From the "Edi
tor's Drawer" of Harper's Magazine.

GO AFTER YOUNG.
Declare They Will Restore
Mrs. Lieutenant Lasher's
Memory.
ON THE MESSIAH'S TRAIL
Said to Be the Mesmerist of a
Very Nervous Young
Woman.
AN AGENT VISITS THE WIFE.
Within One Month It Is Said She
Will Hate the Sight of
Young.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 20. )
Mrs. Lasher, wife of Lieutenant Lasher
of the United States steamship Adams,
whose remarkable career has recently at
tracted so much attention, was visited to
day by a representativeof a San Francisco
psychical society, who declares that she
can entirely restore Mrs. Lasher's reason
and can exercise such an effect on her that
the unfortunate woman will r.ever want to
see or hear Rev. F. F. Young again.
When Mrs. Lesinzsky, the woman whose
mission it is to restore Mrs. Lasher's rt a
son, arrived at the house she was hardly
1 repared for what she saw. The elegantly
furnished drawing-room of the cozy Dome
in which Lieutenant Lasher installed his
attractive wife with ncr children has been
crowded with dilapidated desks and a big
Unckboard dangles by a rope from the
walL
In explaining her methods Mrs. Lesinz-
Fky said : "This man Young is but a type
of man}' whose influence we have de
stroyed. We act solely by the lis?ht of the
word of God and claim that our calm ar
guments, which are the result of many
years of deliberate study, will convince a
victim and turn tLei: minds entirely from
their hulucmation.
"I have thoroughly studied the case of
Mrs. Lasher and can sympathize with her
as only a mother can. She is still young
in intellect, or that man wou:d never have
induced her to throw over her mother and
sister and open her home to him. He
calls himself a Messiah, and if she should
be sent to a lunatic asylum she would be
driven crazy. I shall reason with her and
shall treat with her sympathetically.
"I shall rrake her think just as I think
and want to do just as I would want to do
under the circumstances. Young is noth
ing more or less than a criminal lunatic.
The poor woman believes that she is doing
the Lord's will, because she is doing as
Youne has told her. She is a very ner
vous woman and needs the personal care
of a husband. So far as mental influence
is concerned Young has occupied the hus
band's place, but we will throw down
his pretensions to Mes-iabship in that
young woman's mind before a month
passes." . ....... . . . .:-
The San Francisco representative crossed
the bay after her visit and intends to re
peat the dose until a cure shall have been
effected.
In the meantime Young is again in
stalled in the Lasher household. The

FABIOLA`S FETE
It Will Live the Hospital Over Two
Thousand Dollar*.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 20.â The finan
cial result of the recent Fabiola fete was
made known to-night. The hospital will
receive $2100, which is nearly as much as
was realized last year when the meteoro
logical conditions were more favorable and
society took much greater interest in it
than that v.as snown on May clay.
The total receipts of the fete from eate
money, subscriptions from street railroads,
sale of concessions and the proceeds of the
souvenir i*Mied by the ladies amounted
to $5700. The expenses of the grand stand
are trreatly reduced by the sale of the lum
ber of which it was built.
The ladies' souvenir netted $560. They
worked hard among the merchants ana
t.-eir efforts a3 advertising solicitors were
â well repaid.
President Davis is very elated over the
outcome. "At 10 o'clock on the morning
of the fete," said he to-iiay, "when 1 saw
the cloud?, 1 would have sola my expecta
tions for $100. >"o\v I think that consider
ing our difficulties, we Ecored a great suc
cess."

BERKELEY'S WOOD
FOR THE WOMEN
A Big Convention of Suf
fragists in the Univer
sity Town.
WILL CONTINUE TO-DAY
Miss Yates, Miss Hay, Mrs. Dr.
Kellogg-Lane and Others
Speak.
CRESCENT BICYCLE RACES.
Handicap Events to Take Place on the
San Pablo Road May
Thirtieth.
BERKELEY. Cal., May 20. â The
Woman's Suffrage convention, which
opened at Shattuck Hall this afternoon,
drew forth a large number of the promi
nent ladies of Berkeley. Tliere was a scat
tering of gentlemen also among the audi
ence.
The speakers of the afternoon were
Miss Hay, Mrs. George W. Haight, Mrs.
Albert Carlisle, Mrs. Clara Partridge and
Mrs. Dr. Keliogg- Lane.
On the platform sat Mrs. George W.
Haight, president of the Berkeley Suffrage
Society; Miss Hay, National organizer;
Mrs. Wood, president of the Alameda
Woman's Suffrage Club; Mrs. Alice E. S.
Bangs, Mrs. Clara Partridge. Mrs. Eleanor
Carlisle, Miss Sarah Severance, Mrs. R. P.
Thomas, Mrs, Naylor ana Mrs. William
Keith.
The exercises opened with a prayer by
Mrs. Nayier, after which the entire con
vention rose and sang several verses of a
hymn.
The two most prominent and lengthy
addresses of the afternoon were made by
Mrs. Partridge and Mrs. Carlisle.
After the opening remarks to the con
vention by Miss Hay and the address of
welcome by Mrs. Haiglit the "Symposium
on Woman's Enfranchisement, 1 ' consist
ing of thiee ten-minute papers, opened.
The subject which Mrs. Carlisle handled
was. "Does the Wife and Mother Need the
Ballot?"
She discussed her subject from the
broadly ethical oasis and adhered closely
to the principles of logical argument.
"The one problem of modern social in
vestigation," said Mrs. Carlisle, "ia how
to marshal all forces in the state to their
practical and logical fulfillment. The
noblest work of humanity is to recognize
tlie common burden of responsibility and
so to organize its energies that the fullest
ethical and economical conditions shall
work impartially through every stratum
of society.
' Mothers that are not free cannot pro
duce well-balanced citizens. They have
no reason to do so; they have no power to
do so. As society is constructed to-day a
mother instead of feeling the state to be a
larger home for the child looks upon it as
a real menace both to herself and to her
child. Tne youth of the country are given
over to our direction. Perfect mother
hood demands that we nave authority as
complete political factors, in order to
make these sons complete. That politics
will contaminate the mother is no argu
ment. If character is meant for only the
test of goo 1 environment then character is
not of much valu".
"Women cannot institute reforms for
the preservation of the homes, lor they
have no authority to carry them through,
Their very best efforts in social reforma
tion are, at tlie most, but an illogical doc
toring of abuses, rather than of eradica
tion. The home depends upon the stale;
the state depends upon the homes. Their
respective functions are equal in impor
tance. One should bear no greater social
significance than the other, it is the cir
cle within the circle. The franchise will
broaden the home life of the mother; the
home life will produce motive power To
perpetuate the state on just and equitable
lines."
Mrs. Clara Partridge took for the topic
of her paper "Does the Business Woman
Need the Ballot ?" The remarks of Mrs.
Partridge were bright and sparkling
throughout and full of wit and humcr.
She sketched hrst the life of the business
woman aud tbe many pursuits in which
women of business are to-day engaged.
"No avenue," said she, "is closed to
them. They are represented in nearly
every industry. All who are opposed to
equal snffrage'seem to be bound by a false
conception of the being and powers of
women. Business women need the ballot
for they have material interests at stake.
The wages of women who are in business
pursuits are affected by the laws of tho
land, and in consequence they should have
a hand in the making of there laws.
"Women operate sawmills in Maine
and gold mines in California. On the
Great Lakes she captains sailing vessels,
and she is found in the purser's room of
SEEN AT THE OAKLAND BENCH SHOW.
the steamers that ply the Mississippi.
In Oakland she builds housesâdriv
ing the nails straight, too â and in San
j Francisco she lias forsaken tho rouge-pot
! for white lead and oil and has cone to
i painting bonaes instead of faces. She has
j dropped the cold poker as an instrument
' of warfare and is using it hot to decorate
the homes of her millionaire sisters who
'don't' want the ballot, and can't under
stand why women want to meddle in
: men's affairs anyway.
"She is keeping books as well as making
them. She manufactures sewing machines
and uses them. Hhe owns her own stock
of dry coods and measures tape with the
dapper young clerk who does not own
even the week's wages she owes him; but
she has no voice in making the laws
under which she conducts her bu>ines=,
while the man has. It is of supreme mo
ment to woman what policy the Gov
ernment pursues in regard to exports and
imports. The man who deals in hides,
next door to tne woman who carries on a
wholesale 1 atÂ«r trade is not affected finan
cially one whit more in proportion to his
capital than she by free trade or protective
tariff; and if she is to succeed she needs
the same means of protecting her inter
ests as he. and that is the privilege of
choosing the law-makers of the land.
"She needs the bullot in order that she
may receive the same consideration that
men do. The man who has it in his
power to control legislation that may
make or mar an importer's business is
bound to receive at the hands of the trade
greater benefits than the woman who has
been disfranchised. The financial policy
of the Nation means as much to her as it
docs to her masculine competitors. Its
soundness or unsoundness will increase or
diminish her income along with her
brothers, and she should be allowed to de
clare for the free coinage of silver at 16 to 1
or for gold as she wishes. Man and
woman alike bave an inalienable right to
an opinion, and whether it be right or
wrong of freely expressing it."
Mrs. Dr. Kello^-Lane then gave an ex
lemroraneons address on "Does the Pro
fessional Woman Need the Ballot?" She
lirst told what the ballot stands for and
what it does not stand for. She showed
what it meant to England, to the Trans
vaal and to other civilized parts of tho
earth which were ir. sympathy with and
striving tot wainan's suffrage.
"They are all clamorine for the ballot,"
said she, "and it is only a matter of time
when they will have it. In a body politic
every individual should have the privi
lege "of the ballot."
She referred to the fact that where
woman enters into a field of labor with
man. both work together better than alone
and separate.
In the evening Attorney George W.
Hai?ht gave an address on "The Political j
Status of Woman." President Richards
of the Board of Town Trustees then in
troduced the speauer of the evening, Miss
Elizabeth M.^ates of Maine, who spoke
along the same line as followed out by the
speakers of the afternoon.
The convention will be continued both
to-morrow afternoon and evening. Miss
Hay and Mi^ Yates, together with Mra.
' Ilui^'bt and Miss Severance, will speak.

In Two Weeks* Time the City Coun

tant Question.
Oakland Office San Kfancisoo Call.)
908 Broadway, May 20. f
Another profound problem has arisen in
the city government, and it is considered
of co much importance that at Monday
night's meeting of the Council it was laid
over for further consideration.
A few weeks ago Councilman Heitn,an
introduced an ordinance placing a tax on
all nickel-in-the-slot machines in the city.
Mr. Heitman said it had been proved,
though wnether he meant personally or
not he did not state, that the nickel-in-the
slot machines were great moncy-makiiig
machines; that they were a delusion and a
snare, and should therefore be made to
produce something in the shape of a tax
for the benefit of the city. The ordinance
was parsed and sent to the Mayor for his
signature or veto.
Mayor Davie vetoed the ordinance. He
said that it did not discriminate between
the harmless candy machine and the per
nicious card-playing device that is the
medium between saloon-keepers and their
patrons in settling accounts for drinks.
Mr. Heitman thinks differently. He is
opposed to gambling in all of its forms.
He distinctly declares that all nickel con
trivances are games of chance. There is
no reiiabiiity about them. It is a case of
now you see it and now you don't. You
put in a nickel and if the machine should
happen to be in good working order you
may get your wrong weight or a discord
ant tune. The speculative child may iret
a piece of candy or he may not. The
giddy co-ed or the theological student may
get their fortune 01 they may uot. The
cigarette devotee may get a fragrant
smoke or he may get co'nsomrae.
All these points have been carefully con
sidered by Mr. Heitman, and lie has
arrived at the conclusion that no matter
what guise the fake may wear the machine
is a speculation pure and simple. The
speculation consists not in the principle,
but in the accidental circumstances thai
control the reward.
Mayor Davie has not dealt much in
nickel machines and has not had the
mortification of standing on an iron plate
waiting for the "correct weight with musi
cal accompaniment" that never came
Consequently he thinks that the nickel
cigar and drink card machines should be
taxed, but that the candy and pearl
button machines are harmless and should
go free.
Mr. Davie and Mr. Heitman have
locked horns on the degree of evl influ
ence that goes out from the nickel-in-the
s!ot machine, and legislation in that direc
tion is blocked. There will probably be
numerous passages at arms in the Council
chamber and the Mayor will be called
upon to explain, and in about two
weeks the measure will be passed over
the Mayor's veto and some other equally
important measure willthen be considered".
FOUGHT OVER CHILDREN.

Two Battles in West Oakland Neces
sary to Rea?h the Desired
End.
Oakland OFFrcE Saw Fkancifco Call,)
908 Broadway, .May 20. j
A most exciting struggle for the pos
session of tyro children took place in West
Oakland late last night. The mother was
beaten, the baby screamed, but eventually,
with the aid of the police and the agent
of the children's society, the little ones
were rescued and went away with their
mother.
Mrs. Mary Cahral of 414 Eddyjstreet. San
Fr.MH-iseo, was separated from her hus
band seme time ago, as he failed to pro
vide for his tarnily. He was very anxious
not to part with the children, but the
court decided that the mother only was
entitled to them and awarded them to her.
The mother at f.rst put them in a day
nursery, but later she consented to let
Mr. Kane of tne Youths' Directory put
them in St. Joseph's Asylum.
On Tuesday Mrs. Cabral called to see
the children, and was surprised to find
that the father had called and taken them
away just ten minutes before her arrival.
After recovering her composure Mrs.
Cabrai started on a search. t>he obtained
a clew that they were in Fan Leandro, and
so she searched that town. Frank Kane
and Mrs. Prescott of the Oakland society
followed up every clew, and finally Con
tnble Gallett pave his reasons why he
thought the children were in Oakland.
The oflicÂ«>rs visited the Portuguese
quarter on Peralta street. They went into
a house and wnile the mother was talking
Mrs. Preacott kept her eyes wide open.
While talking the mother hoard a cry
that she knew to be that of her three-year
old child. She at once rushed into the
next room and a struggle followed. Mr.
Kane had returned to ban Francisco and
Mrs. Prescott and ?.Irs. Cabral were alone.
Several people swarmed into the house,
and when Mrs. Prescott saw the mother
wasbeini; struck she blew a police whistle.
A stranger then left the house and Mrs.
Cabral rushed out with her child. No
information could be learned of the
months-old baby, but a man whispered to
Agent Prescott that he could tell her
where the baby was if she would giye him
police protection.
He eventually said that the child could
be found at the home of Dick Sutherland
on Pacific street. The mother and her
child and Agent Prescott. went to Suther
land's house followed by a procession of
folks who had witnessed" the row.
On arriving at the Sutherland house the
women there admitted that the baby was
inside. While talking Mrs. Cabral heard
her baby prattling and at once rushed
into the room and grabbed it.
Another struggle followed and Mrs.
Prescott and the mother had to fight with
the crowd again. The whole family took
a hand in the fracas and the baby was
quite badly bruised during tbe conflict.
The mother held on it with one hand and
fought her assailants with tbe other. Mrs.
Prescott also used fcer arms with good

HAYWARDS. Cal., May 20.â Tne
pretty village of Hay wards, its neat white
houses nestling among tne green orchards
in the lovely foothills, fluttered in gay
bunting to-day. Old Glory from the bi^
arrh and from many a hou?etop shone as
a flame aga ; nst the deep blue of the Cali
fornian sky and its stars and stripes were
repeated in miniature on the beautiful
silk badges of the \. M. I.
All Haywards was Maydayine in honor
of the representatives of the institute.
Awnings, cornices and balconies were
festooned with cypress branches, floral
loops and the National colors. Every one

was on the streets also to swell the wel
come and to contribute to the eenerai
hilarity, for Haywards felt that she was
honored by the presence of the finest body
of young men that had ever stepped
within her orchard gates. They represented
the youth, the enterprise, the intelligence
and the progress of all parts of the State,
and each division, as it marched through
the principal streets amid the applause
from the crowds on the sidewalks, made
a splendid showing of the section of the
State from which it hailed.
The rising generation of San Francisco
was represented by two companies, Aof
St. Mary's Cathedral and C of St. Patrick's
League of the Cross Cadets, the former
company acting as escort to the grand del
egates and the latter to Council No. 34 of
San Francisco.
Haywards, ever noted for its hospitality,
maintained its reputation in that regard
to-day. Chief of Police Ramage and a
mounted platoon headed the parade. The
Board of Trustees of the city also turned
out to do honor to the occasion and the
Fire Departments of Haywards and San
Leandro were a picturesque feature of ttie
affair.
Cypress Camp, Woodmen of the World,
and the Haywards lioad Club, scorchers
on the rubber tire, were also in the line
and went down all along the line with the
rest.
The institute sessions were brief, and be
tween them pleasure and the cultivation
SEW TO-SAT.
Skin
Came Off
I had an obrtinate skin dieea*e, called Eczema.
My body, bead, and arms were covered with
spota like drops of mortar, which came off ia
layers of dry scales. I Buffered for over a year
-without relief, consulted several doctors with-
out aid, and had almost given up hope. I saw
an advertisement about Ccticura Keuedikh;
took them, and in eight wte.k* I was aa well aa
ever, for ray skin 1b as nice and clear as a baby's.

of the art of good-fellowship held undis
puted sway.
Company C, League of the Cross, showed
that there were no barnacles in its make
up when it gave an exhibition drill in the
afternoon, which was witnessed by a very
large crowd of interested and delighted
spectators. An hour later the doors of
N. S. G. AY. Hall were thrown open to the
young men and young women for a dance,
and it is almost needless to mention that
the pretty girls of Haywards availed them
selves of the opportunity of whirling in
the fascinating mazes of the waltz.
At night there was a session of the
institute, followed by a high jinks later on.
The jinks were high, indeed, the enter
tainment being of first-class quality.
Something must be said about the per
sonnel of the visitors. They represented
all the walks of life and comprised mechan
ics, artisans, lawyers, judges, teachers and
writers. That they represented what was
high and good in the communities whence
they came was apparent in the gentle
manly manner in which they deported
themselves. There was not from the be
ginning of tne Visit up to closing time to
night a single incident of unpleasantness.
Sheltered from harsh winds by the low
foothills ot the coast range, Haywards is a
calm and warm belt to itself. The sunny
south is not more sunny, the citrus lands
of Riverside and S3n Diego are no more
delightfully warm than Haywards is to
night. While the young moon is riding
on a fleeting wracu of clouds the streets of
Haywards blaze with electric lamps and
the warm air is resonant with harmonious
song. Cadets seated in a semicircle in front
of the Castro-street Villa chorus the popu
lar melodies, some breathing tenderly of
love and some sonorous with the soldier's
soul â his dream of war and g4ory.
Hay wards is keeping late hours to-night,
but she may be pardoned for dissipating
and straying from the staid decorum of
her wonted way, for these are holidays
that come but rarely and leave behind a
memory that will live for many a year.
A GREAT SPECTACLE.
The Parade Was One of the
Finest Ever Seen In
Haywards.
HAYWARDS, Cal., May 20.â The nis
tory of a people or of a town may be con
sidered as divided into stages, marked off
by distinctive events that must ever stand
out figuratively, as mileposts set along a
new-formed roadway, never to be retrav
eled, but ever to be looked back upon aa
an incentive to even better achievements.
To-day Haywards reached a climax in her
history, and began a new era to be dated
from a great concourse of people gathered
in solid masses along her sidewalks to wit
ness the spectacle of a procession that,
with all it's features, constituted such a
brilliant sight as ia seldom seen, except
when the conditions of a great city make
elaborate spectacular displays less diffi
cult to produce.
When the Native Sons' Hall was dedi
cated on the Fourth of July live years ago,
everything combined to attract hundreds
upon hundreds of persons to this pretty
town of homes nestling among fruit trees.
But to-day when the Grand Council of the
Y. M. 1., united with organizations from
neighboring and from distant towns, ;
marched with eager step and glad hearts
through the streets, that other celebration
became only an event in the days gone by,
for it can no longer hold the first place as I
a local pride to those who recall what has i
been. That imaginary crown that graced j
the brow of the N. S. 'J. W. personified is I
now among the jewels gathered by another j
fraternal order of young mon, one the
chief motive of which is religion coupled
with State pride and patriotism.
There were 5000 people lined several I
deep along the main streetsâ pretty girls !
in summer dress, matrons, men and small
boys. Abouve their heads and stretching ]
along over the walls of compact humani
ty were the fantastic decorations lavished '
upon the low business huildincs until the '
scene resembled, In general, something as
sociated only with the wild conception of '
a scenic artist unfaithful to nature. For,
excepting the lazy movement of hundreds
of bannera and flags suspended over the I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 21, 1896.
avenues separating the two parallel rows
of expectant faces, there was at first no
active life in the picture.
Suddenly, however, all was animation
as the two columns instinctively swayed
forward with a common impulse. Every
face was turned upon a cavalcade of black
horses rounding a corner some distance
down the line. Conspicuous at the fore
was a single white charger, lightly pranc
ing and indifferent to the weight of his
rider. On tney came, heading an ever
increasing procession, down upon which
10,000 eyes looked and saw the rythmical
pulsation of men marching in regular order
made possible by martial music.
Here and there down the approaching
column particular features caught the eye
and heightened the eagerness for a nearer
view. Cross-emblazoned banners carried
aloft suggested the historic marches to
the Crusades, but the emblem that never
changes through changing time was sur
rounded by tokens of a century far ad
vanced beyond medieval ideals.
A lire brigade, Haywards' pride, stood
out vividly because of the gay contrast it
formed to the more somber tones of what
came before.
Ked-shirted men drawing a hose-cart
that appeared only as a pretty ornament
to exemplify artistic and decorative skill
in a display of hunting and flowers; a
loug hook and ladder wagon drawn by two
white horses and also effectively clothed
in holiday garb â these were the features
of the procession.
But wait; there is a more eager stir â a
murmur of approving voices. The crown
ing glory of the day is /ounding the cor
ner and it Is tacitly awarded the prize.
High over the heads of the approaching
column and apparently floating gently
along comes the barge of state with its
load of Native Daughters.
California, all in white, sits a queen on
high, under the broad canopy of a giant
oriental parasol, and surrounding her,
seated upon steps rising to the throne, are
charming girls, each coquettishly holding
The Native Daughters* Float in the Young Men's Institute Parade in Haywards.
a gay sunshade above her uncovered
tresses. It all formed a sj'mphony in
white, set off by American flags and by
the rich orange tints of countless esch
scholtzias.
The head of the parade presented a
charming picture of prancing, spirited
horses, but the last feature was not less
impressive. The whole local council,
V. M. 1., came along four abreast, occupy
ing the breadth of the street. Each man
wore a white straw hat and carried a fancy
Japanese parasol, under which a smiling
countenance proclaimed a local nride
heightened by conscious success.
Then of the details of the parade: Fore
most, with aides abreast, rode like a
Napoleon to victory th# Chief of l'olice,
W. J. Ramage, and with him were the fol
lowing deputies, wearing black slouch hats
and broad red sashes over their shoulders:
John Miller, F. Flores, John Rodgers,
Milo Knox, George Grindell, P. Hoare, J.
Stanton, Tom Silva, Henry Garcia, A. L.
Graham, B. Rose, T. Thomas.
Grand Marshal George Tait, escorted by
ten other horsemen, rode next in order.
The Oakland band of sixteen members in
dark-blue uniforms lead the main body
and set the marching time for Company
C, League of the Cross Cadets of San
Francisco, who, with sabers drawn and
neat uniforms, presented a fine appear
ance.
Then came the high officers of the Y. M.
In the first carriage were Supreme
President John J. McDade, Grand Presi
dent John Lynch, Grand Second Vice-
President Rev. McKinnon, Grand Secre
tary Stanley and Grand Treasurer O'Don
nell.
Next rode the foremost clergy of the
asemblage: Father Yorke, Chancellor of
the Diocese; Father McNally of Oakland,
and Father Zabresky of Monterey.
Other officers followed in four surreys,
and after them marched the complete
delegation in attendance upon the Grand
Council, a company of 100 strong.
Nine men with high silK hats and alder
manic mien reclined easily in a carriage,
and it was not difficult to guess that they
were the Town Trustees. Behind them
were the fire laddies, the chief and his
assistant riding in advance and setting the
example in elaborate decorations.
Oakland Council with thirty-tive men,
all carrying United States flags, led the
way for the San Leaudro band, whose
gorgeously arrayed drum major, William
Oakes, was the one bright, particular in
dividual to be singled out from the crowd,
and behind the brightly uniformed musi
cians marched San Jose's twenty-five rep
resentatives with the Pioneer Council of
San Francisco close behind with its dele
gation of fourteen.
Washington Council 4 led the way,
for two large covered buses, in which mem
bers from Oakland and fair ones not mem
bers enjoyed the common privilege of tak
ing part in the general triumph.
Captain E. P. Fitzgerald, in command of
Company C of St. Mary's Parish, San
Francisco, marshaled his well-trained ca
dets as they came erect and stepping
liehtly to the music. San Francisco Coun
cil 84) with seventy men, and San Fran
cisco Council 35, with thirty men, were
followed by ten men from the Livermore
Council.
Then there was a delightful variation.
Women, fair women, surrounded by roses
tastefully arranged upon the equipages in
which they rode, caught the eye and held
the attention. The four beautiful black
horses driven by Miss Nora Stanton were
only a feature compared with the pas
sengers they drew. With the fair driver
sat Miss Kirwin; on the middle seat were
Miss Annie Haas and MiÂ«s Kate Stanton,
and on the rear seat were Miss McKeever
and Miss Kate Cahill.
In equally pleasing contrast came a two
seater drawn by a team of white horses
driven by Miss Mamie McKeever, who
had as companions Miss Mary Welsh,
Mrs. McKeever and Mi>s Ethel McKeever,
all shaded by pretty Japanese parasols.
Then, oh, then, the tloat, with its six
white horses and its charming corps of
feminine innocence, with queenly Miss
Christina Haas as "California;" with viva
cious Florence Hatch and fair little Lulu
Ãbhoff, with the Misses Flora Paimtag,
Lena Paimtag, Millie Nauert, Emma
Thierbach, Annie May. Katie Eggert, Julia
Welt, Lottie Welt, Rosie Stroble, Ella
Bridge, Blanche Bridge, Mausie Neudeck,
Ella Garrettson, Agnes Ramage, Frances
Schneider, Elsie Smyth and Olive Wing.
Following the Native Daughters were
twenty-two members of the local parlor,
N. S. G. W., cool, neat-looking in their
straw hats and white negligee flannel
shirts, decorated with a broad red, white
and blue sash.
In somber black walked the Portuguese
Union of Haywards, sixty-seven men in
the company, and followed by the Portu
guese priest in a buggy with the editor of
the Portuguese paper.
The four ladies of the general commit
tee sat aglow with smiles, enjoying the
climax of their successful efforts to make
the Grand Council meeting an auspicious
occasion, and most happy was Frank P.
Hooson, the chairman. Following afoot
were fourteen others. Seven boys in blue
jackets, red fezes and red trousers of a
complete zouave costume did themselves
proud with their drums and formed one of
the best features of the long parade.
After, the local council, citizens and visi
tors in carriages.
But while the spectacular event of the
day attracted all attention there were
other things doing. At 9 o'clock the
Grand Council went into secret session
and continued until nearly 11, slightly de
laying the parade. And again In the
afternoon the law-mnters convened and
discussed the by-lawa section by section
until after !3 o'clock.
Five new delegates were receivedâ J. F.
McDonnell of 74, Frank McGlynn of 35,
W. N. Harrington of 31, J. Ahem of 55,
and A. J. Green of 23. And in accordance
with a telegram from Father O'Neil so
requesting James Kenney was elected an
alternate from Council 3.
The committee of law and supervision
was ordered to report to-morrow morning
at the session opening at 9:30.
A telegram was read from Santa Rosa
offering to entertain the next Grand
Council. Congratulatory messages were
received from Bishops Mora and Mont
gomery of Los Angeles, and from Father
Grace, acting Bisbop of Sacramento.
Father Yorke delivered a verbal message
from the Archbishop expressing his good
wishes and blessings to the Grand Council.
As to-morrow's elections approach the
field of candidates increases and surprises
seem to be in store.
D. J. Gallagher of Fresno and Sheeba
of San Francisco are the talk so far for
grand president, unless Lynch should ac
cept renomination. McHenry of San
Luis Obispo, St. Sure of Alameda, Prince
valle of Menlo and F. B. Hooton of this
place are the most prominently mentioned
possibilities as grand directors. Secre
retary Stanley will probably be re-elected.
Denike of San Jose is named for grand
first vice-president, and Aggeler, his fel
low townsman, is mentioned for grand
treasurer.
This afternoon Company A, League of
the Cross Cadets of San Francisco, gave
an exhibition near the arch, going through
a large number of difficult military move
ments to the delight of a big crowd of spec
tators.
At noon and again in the evening the
ladies of the Presbyterian, the Congrega
tional and Episcopal churches, assisted at
each place by attractive young ladies as
waitresses, served msals as an aid to the
funds of their respective churches.
For over two hours in the afternoon a
great crowd thronged the main ballroom
and the smaller danceroom at.N. S. G. W.
Hall, where an informal dance was en
joyed by merry couples that dared to at
tempt to glide through the crush.
THE HIGH JINKS.
Pleasure Was Queen of the May
at the Festal Board Last
Evening.
HAYWARDS, Cal., May 20.â After the
institute session this evening the delegates
held high jinks in Native Sons' Hall. The
building was covered with flags, bunting
and evergreens and the large hall in the
interior was decorated in a similar man
ner. Most royhl was the spread and it
was done justice to, but the feast of fun
and the flow of wit and song that followed
were the most enjoyable features of all.
The jinks were opened with an overture
by the Oakland Concert band, after which
Frank B. Hoosan, tho Haywards agent
for The Call, introduced William Ahem
of San Francisco Council No. 55 as mod
erator of the evening.
The programme was varied and in
cluded wrestling, boxing, music, etc.
There was club-swinging by Slamberg,
boxing by Slamberg and Hammersly,
Cerini and Fox, a four-round bout by Mul
vihill and Silver, wrestling by Gelder and
Platt, high jumping by Al Lean, barn
yard melodies by C. Ericcson, heavy lift
ing by Al Lean, a chorus by the Reliance
Glee Club of twelve, songs by the Hay
wards trio (Enos, Reed and Powell),
tenor solo by Tony Enos, bass solo
by George Beebe, witticisms by J. E.
Crooks, solo by William O'Brien, special
ties by Richard Whalen, James O'Donnell,
Daniel O'Callahan, George Knox and W.
Walton; bass solo by John McAuliffe, reci
tation by Frank McGlynn, baritone solo
by George Devine, recitation by Franfc
Murasky, cornet solo by Matt Grennan,
skirtdance by George Hammersley, song
and stories by Alexander Rosborough, be
sides a list of volunteer songs and stories.
The festivities were continued until a
late hour, and the rosy bowl ol friendship
was passed around.
San Diego's Pretzels.
The jolly and witty leader of the San
Diego delegation transplanted from the
green hills that overlook Coronado to the
green hills of Haywards one of the most
popular institutions of that part of the
citrus belt, which lies next to the sound
ing sea, namely, a pretzel club. A genu
ine pretzel is the l^adge of the order, and
it is not allowed to be worn outside of tne
coat until after 11 p. m., the hour at which
pretzels are usually washed down with
their appropriate liquid.
The Badge.
The badge worn by the delegates is of
artistic design. It is of silk with a cellu
loid medal. On the silk are painted two
American flags surmounting the great seal
of California. On the medal are the words,
"Young Men's Institute; Pro Deo, Pro
Patria, " with a red cross and an olive
branch beneath.
FOUGHT FOUR ROUNDS.
Two District Messenger Boys Engage
in a Lively Bare-Kuackle
Fight.
Two messenger boys, Tom Barrington,
alias the Spider, and Charles McDonald,
had a lively four-round fight yesterday
morning at 3 o'clock. Bad blood has ex
isted between the two boys for some time,
and earlier in the evening they had a
street fight, the only result being an un
derstanding to meet later in the night and
settle tlieir differences with bare lists.
Just where the encounter took place is
in doubt, some saying that it occurred at
Corbett's, others at the Midway Piaisance,
and a few that the White Wings saloon
was the scene of the battle.
At all events four fierce rounds were
fought with bare knuckles, resulting in
a draw. Barrington's face is slightly
marked, and McDonald is said to have
lost two or three teeth in the scrimmage.
The principals are not at all satisfied
with the result, and an effort is now
being made to bring off a finish fight.
The PheUn Gold Medal.
James D. Phelan of the San Francisco Art
Association has established v golden mednl,
which will be known as tho James D. Thelan
medal, and is to be awarded in consideration
of the best general character of student work
thoroughout the year in the class in modeling.
The medal will be awarded this year to Robert
I. AUken.
