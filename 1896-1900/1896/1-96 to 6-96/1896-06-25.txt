PATERSON, N. J., June 24.â 0n eacn
of the steps leading to Carroll Hall, the
home of Garret Augustus Hobart, is a
floral horseshoe about six feet in diame
ter, placed there last Monday night when
80,000 people marched by, shouting and
cheering for Pater;on's foremost citizen.
New Jersey is not at all behind Ohio in
appreciation of honors paid to her favorite
sons. And the smoke of the celebration,
the echoes of the cheers and of the big
bands of music had not died away when I
arrived last nicht from Cleveland. The
air was still full of enthusiasm and of Re
publicanism. Local pride was wearing its
Sunday clothes, and the silk factories ana
other factories in this, the Lyons of
America, displayed the stars and stripes
and the tri-c'olor.
Carroll Hall is a neat three-story resi
dence, with a giass lawn in front, shaded
by tall elms and surrounded by a neat
picket fence. On two sides of the building
and facing the two streets is a piazza,
where one can sit in the moist, hot even
ings of summer and watch the rosy sun
sets. It is not a Nob Hill house
nor a Nob Hill district, but a modest little
re-idence such as you will, find anywhere
on the hills of San Francisco outside of
Van Ness avenue, Pacific Heights or Nob
mrs. garret a. hobart.
Hill, and is far humbler in appearance
than you would expect to find when Mr.
Hobart's financial standing and social
position are taken into consideration. It
makes an excellent match for Major Mc-
Kinley's cottage in Canton, Ohio, just as
the two men make an excellent team to
bead the Republican ticket.
I found Mrs. Hobart and a few lady
friends on the porch enjoying the cool airs
that gently strolled from the Atlantic
after tbe sun had gone down. The hall
door stood hospitably open, and in a few
moments I was ushered into the presence
of the Republican candidate for the Vice-
Presidency. The back parlor in which he
was sitting was brilliantly lighted and
luxuriously furnished, Mrs. Hobart's re
fined taste being exemplified by the chaste
beauty of the articles of vertu there dis
played. Mr. Hobart was almost concealed
by the high back of an npholstt red easy
chair, to that the first glimpse I had was
at the top of Ms head, which was bald up
above the forehead; two locks of dark hair
had been brushed so that his portraits do
not give any indication of his baldness.
He was dressed in a iight brown suit of
grass cloth, a costume very popular in this
climate, and was dictating letters to a
young woman stenographer.
That he was very busy was evident from
a pile of about 1000 unanswered letters
jyingon tho table and I therefore remained
only lonn enough to get a good look at
him. He is neither tall nor short, stand
ing about five feet eigtit and one-half
inches, and is stout and compact, but
without any apparent tendency toward an
excess of adipose tissue; the forehead is
well developed, broadest across the eyes
and filling out a little a hove the temples.
The nose is straight, of the Roman order,
but not too long; the firmly-closed lips
are shaded by a long, sandy-gray mus
tache and the iirm, square chin sits well
forward. The general shape of the head
and face is round, the greatest width be
ing from chock to cheek on a level with
the moutu. The eyebrows are straight
and horizontal, close to the eyes and have
a downward leaning at the corners. Hi 3
The San Francisco Call.
I eyes are grayish-blue, but their keenness
is weakened by a slight cast in one of
them. Mr. Hobart is a man of intense en
ergy and of great capacity for business
affairs. Like his friend, Marcus A.urelius
Hanna, he is an active spirit in many in
dustrial enterprises, but I think he lacks
the coolness, the presence of mind, the
j self-poise which have made Mr. Hanna
one of the most remarkable business and
political managers in the country.
Mr. Hobart is so earnest in his energy
that he shows it in every movement. His
manner of speech is abrupt and quick;
bis language plain Saxon and to the bulls
i eye. I soon found that he would not talk
politics. He said that he would not do so
except from the public platform, but as
his political ideas are well known nobody
will suffer because of his silence. In his
younger days he was a Democrat, but
after he had begun to get an insight into
true business principles and the secret of
the prosperity of all nations he found that
Democratic free trade Utopianism would
not be successful even in the management
of a peanut-stand, and he became a Re
publican. He saw that the Republican
party was established on principles whieii
were for the best interest of employer and
employe as well as for the farming ele
ment of the community and for the whole
people. The Republican party to-day has
j no more devoted, earnest, sincere and self-
I sacrificing adherent than Garret A. Ho
l bart.
"I'm piled to the ears with work," he
said, with an impatient glance at the big
stack of letters on the table, "and letters
are coming in thicker and faster by every
mail. How was Major McKinley managing
to handle his correspondence when you
saw him at Canton?'
I replied that perhaps the major did not
| attempt to read all the letters that came
ito his address. I presumed that he took
up those from personal friends and bis:
men in the nation and let his private sec
' retary and his three stenographer clerks
! attend to the rest at their leisure. Many
of the letters received by Mr. Hobart are
from persons asking financial aid; one
from Massachusetts to perfect a patent,
I another to help raise a mortgage on a corn
I farm in Kansas ruined by drought,
! another to assist a poor but deserving col
ored family in Texas, and all of them as
| suring Mr. Hobart that should he be so
'â  generous as to send them a check or a
â  greenback they would secure all the way
from 100 to 1000 Democratic votes for him
Mr. Hobart would not mention it, but I
learned from others somewhat of the
known record of this gentleman and his
GARBET A. HOGART JR., SON OF THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.
Young Hobart fa quite an enthusiastic politician. The lapels of his coat are
decorated with campaign buttons, and he talks understanding!}- on the ques
tions of the day. He says he is going to be a good boy, like his father used to
be, and study hard, so that when he is a man he can become President.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, JUNE 25, 1896.
THE HOBART RESIDENCE IN PATERSON, N. J.
accomplished wife, Mrs. Jennie Tuttle
Hobart, in the matter of that charity
which, says the immortal poet, falls as
the gentle dew from heaven upon the
place beneath, blessing him that gives as
well as him that takes, and which be
cometh the throned monarch better than
a crown. The gentle hand of Mrs. Hobart
has wiped away many a tear of distress in
this town of busy looms; her kind words
and loving ministrations have changed
many a sob of sorrow into a smile of joy.
No roof was too lowly that she could not
stoop her gracious head to enter; no home
so dark and cheerless that her presence
could not fill with light and hope. Here
in Paterson and especially in the winter
season there are many opportunities for
the exercise of charity as there are in ail
manufacturing towns on the coast of the
Atlantic, and there are several Christian
societies which have taken the work in
hand. They are the Old Ladies' Home,
the Children's Day Nursery and the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
in all of which Mrs. Hobart is a leading
and most valuable member.
Neither she nor her husbana has done
these things in the middle of the public
highway with heralds before them bugling
their praises, but quietly and without show.
Not one-half of their benefactions has be
come known, for poverty with decent
pride exists in Paterson as well as in San
Francisco. "Generous, open-hearted and
free-handed" were tbe expressions I heard
to-day from business men and others
when they spoke of the candidate for the
Vice-Presidency from New Jersey. To
ordinary enterprises needing assistance he
has given double that which would have
been due irom him, because he dreaded to
be considered selfish or mean. Where one
man gave $10 toward the establishment of
some local enterprise Mr. Hobart gave $25.
He is unassuming and modest withal ana
a good Christian, he and Mrs. Hobart
being members of the Church of the Re
deemer (Presbyterian). With a Methodist
for President and a Presbyterian for Vice-
President the Christian voters of this
country should surely be satisfied. He is
not bigoted in religious matters, for he
has liberally subscribed toward the erec
tion of St. John's and several other Cath
olic churches. He is also a subscriber for
the Barnet Memorial Temple and for
every other church of every denomination
that has been erected in this city during
the last thirty years. Hospitals, orphan
asylums and oid ladies' homes of every
denomination have been Dlessed by the
cheerful giving of his hands.
This trait of nobility and of unselfish
ness has gained for the leading citizen of
Paterson all his popularity. From the
preen Catskill, where the clear streams of
rippling water refresh the tired New
Yorker, to the farthest point of Long
Island, where the waves of the Atlantic
bear a message from the Old World, Gar
ret A. Hobart has the hearts of the people.
Nobody here or in big New York city
thinks of calling him azjything but plain
Gus Hobart. That's how he likes to be
addressed, for his hatband always fits his
head and never requires stretching. Mr.
and Mrs. Hobart have but one child living,
a bright, interesting little fellow of twelve
years, who has been named after t:is
father Garret Hobart Jr. The boy takes
great pride in his father's nomination and
confidentially informed some of his play
mates the other day that he was going to
be a good boy like his father used to be
and was going to study very hard, so that
when he crew up to be a New Jersey man
he might become President of the United
States. Then lie would make good laws
and give everybody work that wanted it
and make everybody happy. If young
Hobart continues to stand upon that
platform until he grows up a big New Jer
sey man, I have no doubt that he will not
only be President, but the best President
the United States ever had.
As in the case of Mr. and Mrs. McKinley,
and as in the case of every other man aiid
woman in the world, death has knocked a';
the door of the Hoi arts. There are two
graves upon wlÂ»i<' lather and in .;â¢â !â Â» or
have time and again poured oat their
hearts' sorrow, one a little girl avid the
other a beautiful, bniliant, talented and
accomplished young woman of 23 years.
This young woman, the pride of her
parents, the sunshine of their home, died
in Europe under peculiarly sad and dis
tressing circumstances while the family
was engaged on a continental tour. The
papers gave the full details at the time
and it is not necessary now to speaK of the
matter at greater length. Had Air. and
Mrs. Hobart possessed iess vigorous con
stitutions the shock would have killed
them. Their lives were bound up in their
daugnter, and her death coming with the
unexpectedness of a thunderbolt com
pletely prostrated them and left scars upon
their hearts that time can never heal.
Mr. Ho ban's offices are in this city,
where he has lived for the past thirty
years, and are plainly furnished. Every
tning speaks of business. The directory of
the business enterprises in which he is en
gaged is as long almost as the list of offices
in the Crocker building in San Francisco.
There are sixty of those enterprises in
which he is a director or other officer.
Among these he is president oi the Pas
saic Water Company, of the Acquacka
nonk Water Company, of tiia Morris
County Railroad and the Paterson Elec
tric RaiWay Company, a director of the
New York, Susquehanna and Western
Railroad and the Lehigh and Hudson
River Railway Company, of the First Na
tional Bunk of Pnterson, of the Paterson
Savings Institution, the Barbour Brothers
Company, the Barbour Flax Spinning
Company, the Pioneer Silk Company, the
People's Gas Light Comiany, the Pater
son Electric Light Company, and counsel
for the East Jersey Water Company, the
West Milford Water Storage Company,
the Montclair Water Company and other
allied interests, a director in the Long
Branch Water Company and the Highland
Water Company. He Is treasurer of the
Cedar Lawn Cemetery Company and sev
eral land companies.
Some of Mr. Hobart's most notable
achievements have been the discharge of
the trusts of receiver of the New Jersey
Midland Railroad Company, of the Mont
clair Railroad Company, the Jersey City
and Albany Railroad Company and of the
First National Bank of Newark. In 1880
this important work was done with an
energy and ability that drew from the
Chancellor of the State the warmest ex
pressions of approval, the complicated
business being wound up and the depos
itors paid in full inside of six months.
That the Republicans have a candidate
for Vice-President possessing the execu
tive ability to fill that or any other oflice
in the National Capitol cannot bo dis
puted, his life from boyhood being one of
intense activity and prominence in busi
ness and in affairs of state. He was born
June S, 1344, in Long Branch, N. J., of old
Knickerbocker stock, his ancestors on his
mother's side being Dutch and on his
father's side English. He graduated from
Rutgers College in 1863, taught school for
three months and then commenced tbe
study of law with the late Socrates Tut
tle, a distinguished leader of the Passaic
County bar, wnose office was in Paterson,
S. J. Mr. Hobart aiso became a member
of Mr. Tuttle's family on July 21, 1869,
marrying Mr. Tuttle's daughter Jennie.
The first public office which Mr. Hobart
held was tnat of City Counsel of Paterson
in 1871. In 1872 he was made counsel for
the Board of Freeholders of Passaic
County, but declined re-election. In No
vember, 1872, he was elected as a Repub
lican to represent the Third District of
Passaic County in the State Assembly, re
ceiving the largest majoriay that th 6 dis
trict had ever given. He was re-elected
to the Assembly in 1873, and was chosen
| speaker of that body. He waa strongly |
urged by his constituents to serve them a j
third term, a distinction then unknown in
the political history of the. county, but
he felt constrained to decline. In 1876, i
however, in obedience to the overwhelm- 1
ing desire of his party, he accepted the j
nomination for State Senator, and again
his popularity was manifested by the ma
jority of 1879, the largest ever cast by the :
'county, exceeding by over 100 per cent
that given in the county to Mr. Hayes for
President. Mr. Hobart was elected presi
dent of the Senate in 1881, and discharged j
the duties of the office with distinction.
During his incumbency as Senator he was
a member of some of the most important
committees, such as revision of laws, edu- i
cation, State library, industrial school for j
girls, printing, fisheries, elections, etc.,
and in 1879 to 1880 he was chairman of the
committee on judiciary.
Mr. Hobart did not go to the Legisla- :
I ture solely for the purpose of making
speeches and voting. He had original
ideas, he saw certain evils which needed
remedying, and he showed that he pos
sessed the ability necessary to remedy
them. Among the new and good laws
now in force and emanating from him is i
the law providing for a summary judicial I
i investigation oi the affairs of any county j
npon the application of twenty-five free
holders, an act which has been a number
of times invoked with most salutary re- j
suits. Another was an act charging the j
sinking fund of the State with the pay- i
meut of all the interest and part of the
principal of the State debt yearly, reduc
ing the ordinary expenditures some $100,
--000 per year, which was the cause of the
DRAWING-ROOM IN THE RESIDENCE OF GARRET A. HOBART.
removal of the tax upon which New Jer
sey prides herself; another was an act for
the arbitration of labor disputes. From
1880 to 1891 Mr. Hobart was chairman of
the State Republican Committee of New
Jersey, and under his leadership the party
conducted some of the most brilliant cam
paigns of its history. In 1884 he was
chosen a member of the Republican Na
tional Committee, upon which he has
served since that time, and has constantly
served on its executive committee.
In the same year he was nominated by
his party in joint caucus as its candidate
for United States Senator, but the Legisla
ture Deing Democratic he was defeated for
election by the Hon. John R. Macpherson.
During more than one Presidential con
test he was asked to accept the chairman
ship of the National Committee, but his
business interests were so vast that he was
obliged to decline the honor. On Decem
ber 12 last he was selected one of three
arbitrators by the thirty railroad presi
dents, whose duty it was to select three
persons to finally hear and settle all dif
ferences that might arise between the
members of the joint traffic association,
which membership constitutes the great
est aggregation of representative capital
in the world. Mr. Hobart's remarkable
capacity for business and his well-known
executive ability have led to his aid being
sought in the organization and develop
ment of perhaps more corporate and pri
vate enterprises than any other citizen of
New Jersey.
In his speech last Monday night before
the big ratification meeting, attended by
15.000 people, Mr. Hobart said something
which, it would be well for a lew score of
NOT YET READY FOR SILVER,
San Franciscans to repeat after changing
the language to suit the locai conditions.
This is what he said:
"Now the point I wish to make is the
importance of civic pride and public
spirit. It is this that has produced the
marvelous change in our city in this
period. I have been guilty myself of some
of that pride in the city of Paterson and I
rejoice in it. I invoke you Democrats and
Republicans alike to do even more than
you have done to manifest more civic
pride, more public spirit, to make Pater
son what it is destined to be, the greatest
city of the future of the State of New Jer
say, to make it possible to have larger fac
tories and more of them, to bring more
people here, to have moro and better
homes for them and so make it the lead
ing city in New Jersey. We want to make
a city of comfortable homes for working
people and with ample facilities for them
to earn enough to own and enjoy their
homes. It is the advancement of this
idea that f have devoted my time, my en
ergy, my work, to the best of my ability in
order that I might more fully show my re
gard and affection for those who surround
me, those with whom I am in friendly
contact every day of ray life."
Mr. Hobart left to-day for Canton, Ohio,
to be present on the occasion of the mon
ster celebration to be given there next
Saturday. John Paul Cosgbave.
TO NOTIFY McKINLEY.
Chairman Thurston Issues Instruc
tions to the Members of
the Committee.
OMAHA, Nebr., June 24. â Senator
' Thurston and family, accompanied by
Senator Bressler and wife, leave to-morrow
â¢ night for Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Thurston
i has issued the foliowinz letter of instruc
tions to members of the committee ap
pointed at the St. Louis convention to
notify Governor McKinley of his nomina
tion as President:
OMAHA, Nebe., June 24, 1896.
The committee selected by the Republican
convention to notify Hon. William McKinley
I of his nomination for President, will meet at
the Hollenden Hotel, Cleveland, Ohio, June 2B,
and proceed by special train in the morning
; of June 29, to Canton, Ohio. The train will re
| turn to Cleveland the afternoon of the same
I day. John If. Thurston, Chairman.
READY FOR THE VISIT.
Major McKinley Will Welcome the
Members of the Notification
Committee.
CANTON, Ohio, June 24.â Major Mc-
Kinley said at noon to-day that he had
not been informed about the date of the
visit of the notification committee being
changed as announced in the dispatches
from Cleveland in certain papers this
morning. He is going on. with bis ar
rangements for the reception committee
on Monday, and has ordered a large tent
to be set up on his lawn Monday morning.
CHICAGO, 111., June 24.â A special
from Cleveland, Ohio, says: Mark Hanna
has been in receipt of numerous letters
daily since his return home, written by
friends in the East, asking him in regard
to the financial plank in the platform
adopted by the Republican party at St.
Louis.
In substance these letters set forth that
the Eastern press is filled with specific
statements that Thomas C. Platt and his
friends performed successfully an arduous
and delicate mission during the conven
tion in forcins McKinley's friends to ac
cept tbe gold declaration against their will.
"The skeleton of the money niank
adopted by the convention," Hanna said
yesterday, in reply to these pretensions,
"was in St. Louis before ex-Senator Platt,
Senator Lodge and E. H. Lauterbach ar
rived. Ido not desire to detract from the
j efforts made by these gentlemen for the
I cause of sound money, but I do wish to
state most emphatically that the plank
defining the party's position was advocated
by Western men, drawn up by Western
I men, and approved by me before a man
! from the East reached St. Louis. The
plank aB it was finally approved by me
went the convention without Eastern in
terference or suggestion.
'Finally, 1 may state with equal em
phasis that the plank shown me by Sen
ator Lodge as representing the Eastern
sentiment was not adopted by the con
vention, nor was it anything like the dec
laration made officially for the Republican
party, being only two or three sentences
long."
Convention of Letter- Carriers.
TOLEDO, Ohio, June 24.â Every State
in the Union is represented in the first an
nual convention of letter-carriers which
opened here to-day. President W. W.
Blackmore occupied the chair. Reports
of officers showed the organization to be
in a flattering condition.

But the Policy of Waiting for

AN APPEAL MADE TO THE
SOUTHERN BOURBONS.
Asked to Avert Republican Ascendency
and tbe Probable Result of a
Force Bill.
SARATOGA, N. V., Jnne 24.â The
Democratic State Convention this after
noon adopted a platform declaring that
the Democratic party is and always has
been in favor of true bimetallism, but that
the restoration of the equilibrium of the
two metals, disturbed by Republican leg
islation, is wholly beyond our power with
out the co-operation of other navions.
This they believe possible to secure by
wise and well-directed efforts. Until it is
secured the rigid maintenance of the gold
standard is essential. Paper money should
be retired as rapidly as possible. The
Democrats of the South are appealed to to
avert Republican ascendency and the
probable result of a force bill by uniting
with the sound money men at Chicago.
President Cleveland's administration is
commended and a revenue tariff favored.
These delegates at large to Chicago were
chosen: David B. Hill (alternate, Robert
Earl); Roswell P. Flower (alternate,
Smith M. Weed); Edward Murphy (al
ternate. Jacob A. Canter); Frederick R.
Coudert (alternate, William Purcell).
The convention was called to order by
Chairman Hinckley of the State Com
mittee at 12:20 p. m. John Boyd Thacher
of Albany was selected for temporary
chairman, and made an address of some
length, in which he reviewed the existing
situation and declared it to be the duty of
the Democracy in such a crisis to speak
clearly on the financial question.
"Neither consideration of expediency
nor the selfish interests of those who own
; silver bullion," he declared, "should lead
I us to depart from the safe and secure
I path."
Committees were then appointed and a
recess taken. When the convention re
assembled at 3:30 p. m. the credentials
committee reported in favor of the sitting
delegates from Kings, Queens and Rich
mond counties, and the contesting Shep
ardites marched out of the hail amid
mingled cheers and hisses. The temporary
organization was made permanent.
The platform, as presented by Senator
Hill from the committee on resolutions,
was as follows:
It would be folly to ignore and impossible
to exaggerate the gravity of the conditions
under which the convention assembles. Most
of the other States of the Union have selected
and commissioned their delegates to the Na
tional Democratic Convention. By a move
ment evidently concerted, but. as we believe,
ill-advised and ill-considered, instructions
have been given to the delegations of a large
number of States having for their aim and
purpose the adoption of a new policy and a
new platform for the Democratic party.
No opportunity for a lair and deliberate conÂ»
sideration of such policy and platform has
been afforded the Democracy <>f the State of
New York. Upon such new matter thus pro
posed to be incorporated among the tenets of
the party it becomes the duty of the Demo
crats of New York, representing their people,
to speak in no equivocal terms. Gold and sil
ver â the money of the constitution and of our
fathersâ each at a Darity with the other in
purchasing power, has been the platlorm of
principles proclaimed by every National Demo
cratic Convention, which has thus adopted
and reaffiimed, in each declaration of party
faith for a century, the wisdom of Thomas
Jefferson, who said, "The monetary unit must
stand on both metals."
The action of a Republican Congress and a
Republican President deprived silver of its
equality with gold for the money and currency
of the Nation. From this actâ for which the
Democratic party was in nowise responsibleâ
and from the action of other nations following
in the same course it has resulted that silver
has greatly declined in commercial value, and
there now exists a wide departure of the two
metals from the coinage standard of value,
bringing disturbance to the financial systems
oi European couu tries as well as our own* and.2
Awakening there, as here, the earnest appre
hension of statesmen and financiers. The
restoration of the equilibrium of the two
metals thus disturbed is a problem the solu
tion of which Is of the greatest consequence to
the prosperity of both this country and of Eu
rope.
Such co-operation by tbe united efforts or
statesmen and wage-earners here and else
where is believed to be near at hand and to be
possible to secure by earnest and well-directed
effort. Free coinage of silver by the United
States alone can have no other effect than to
change our present standard to one of silver
now a depreciated coinâ and to retard, per
haps destroy forever, the success of the move
ment now general throughout civilized coun
tries for the restoration of free bimetallic coin
age in the principal mints of the world. The
proposition to separate ourselves from the
great nations of the world and adopt the mone
tary standard of Mexico and China does not
comport with the pride and financial industry
of the State of New York or the United States.
It should be resisted with tbe fervor of both
partisanship and patriotism by Democrats
everywhere when the ad option of such a course
threatens as it does untold evils to our Na
tion's commerce and industry.
For these reasons and with these convic
tions the Democrats of New York in conven
tion assembled make the following declaration
of their principles and appeal to the Demo
crats of other States to join with them in
incorporating these principles in the party
platform to be adopted at Chicago:
Firstâ We are in favor of gold and silver as
the standard money of the country. We are
opposed as a pernanent financial policy to
gold monometallism on the one hand or to
silver monometallism on the other hand. The
pledge contained in the repeal of the Sherman
law, which repealing act was passed by a
Democratic Congress and approved by a Demo
cratic President, should be faithfully carried
out, wherein it was declared that the efforts of
the Government should be steadily directed to
the establishment of such a safe system of
bimetallism as will maintain at all times the
equal power oi every dollar coined or issued by
the United States in the markets and in the
payments of debts.
We believe that such bimetallism, to which
the Nation is solemnly pledged, can only be
palely secured and permanently maintained
through the concurrent action of the leading
nations of tho world. Neither this country
nor any other country independent and alone
Is able to maintain it, and itwould be folly to
attempt it. Being so convinced we are op
posed to the unlimited coinage of silver in the
absence of the co-operation oi other great na-
Major Charles L. Dick of Akron. Ohio, Who Is Said to Be Slated for the Secre
taryship of the Executive Committee of the Republican National Committee.
tlons. We declare our belief that any attempt
on the part of the United States alone to enter
upon the experiment of free silver would re
tard or entirely prevent the establishment of
international bimetallism. Until interna
tional co-operation for bimetallism can be se
curedâto which end all our efforts as a Gov
ernment and as a people should be in faith
directedâ we favor the rigid maintenance of
the present gold standard as essential to the
preservation of our National credit, the re
demption of our public pledges and the keep
ing inviolare of our country's honor. We in
sist that all our paper and silver currency
shall be ket>t absolutely at a parity with gola.
The piatform opposes legal-tender paper
money as a part of our permanent finan
cial system and refuses to sanction any
par currency inconvertible with coin.
United States notes and treasury notes,
being in fact debts of the Government,
should be gradually paid off, retired and
canceled, in such manner as to cause no
contraction ot the circulating money of
the country. Opposition is expressed to the
repeal of any existing statute which ena
bles the Secretary of the Treasury by the
issue of bonds or otherwise to provide ade
quate funds for the redemption in gold of
our paper obligations whenever necessary.
A tariff for revenue only is favored and
opposition expressed to "Government
partnership with protected monopolies."
The platform farther says: "We indorse
tbe administration of President Cleveland
and particularly commend him for his de
termined efforts to maintain the financial
credit of the United States. The delegates
to the National Democratic Convention
selected by this convention are instructed
to vote and act as a unit."
The platform was adopted unani
mously. Ex-Governor Flower then of
fered the following, which was also
adopted:
Whereas, Party division at Chicago on the
silver question will endanger Democratic suc
cess at the polls; and whereas, Republican
ascendency in the Nation would undoubtedly
be followed by another attempt to establish
minority rule in the Democratic Southern
States by means of a force bill; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Democrats of New York
appeal to the Democrats of the South, in the
name of their political liberty and their prop
erties to avert the possibility of a force bill by
uniting with the Democrats of the East and
the West in framing a platform on which all
Democrats can stand, the united support of
which will lead to a glorious Democratic
victory.
Congressman Sulzer offered a resolution
warmly sympathizing with the Cubans in
their struggle, and John Greene of Kings
moved to amend it by urging upon the
National Government the advisability of
intervening with a view of bringing about
a cessation of the struggle. The amend
ment was laid on the table and Sulzer's
resolution adopted.
After the election of the delegates at
large, as named, and Of district delegates,
the convention adjourned sine die.
STRONG FOR SILVER.
Ohio Democrats Instruct Delegates
to Champion the Cause of the
White Metal.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 24.â The
Democrats of Ohio in convention as
sembled to-day adopted a Btrong silver
platform.
Allen W. Thurman, E. B. Finley, L. E.
Holden and John D. McLean were chosen
delegates at large and W. E. Decker,
Casper V. Hoppley, P. H. Degner, John
W. Conwell, alternates.
The State ticket nominated is as fol
lows: Supreme Judge, E. J. Blanding,
Cleveland ; Secretary of State, Cbilton A.
White, Brown County; Food Commis
sioner, Patrick McKeown, Cincinnati;
Member Board of Public Works, William
Beaumont, Licking County.
The convention was called to order by
Chairman Smalley at 10:30 o'clock this
morning. W. A. Taylor was introduced
as temporary chairman. In the course oi
his address he said:
"Tbe danger wnich threatens this coun
try is not her rich mines of gold and silver,
but that grasping financial policy which
has made England the home of landlords
and tenants, and which, being surrepti
tiously engrafted upon our own laws by the
Sherman act of 1873, has made it possible
to turn the United States treasury into a
broker-shop and enrich a foreign syndicate
with unpatriotic American connections
by compelling the issue of the bonds of
the people to keep intact a stock of goldi
which it turns to its own sinister account
at pleasure. You have no war to make on
capital. You will make no war upon it.
You intend to respect its rights, and you
intend that it shall respect your rights.
If you did more or did less than these
things you would be unworthy the title of
an American."
At the end of Colonel Taylor's speech
the report of the committee on rules was
called for, and the overwhelming vote by
which the report was adopted showed that
any opposition from the gold delegates
vrould be futile. The committee on perma
nent organization then presented its re
port, which was adopted, naming General
A. Warner permanent chairman.
In taking the chair General Warner
made a short speech. He said he believed
that Major McKinley was honest in his
money theory, but he could no more bring
prosperity to the nation that way than he
could lift himself by his bootstraps.
By a vote of 542 to 128 the convention
adopted the following platform :
We, the Democrats of Ohio, in convention
assembled, hold that the money question is
the vital and paramount issue now before the
people of this country, and that its early and
correct settlement is necessary to the revival
of business and the return of prosperity ; there
fore,
Resolved, That we are unalterably opposed to
the single gold standard and demand an im
mediate return to the conbtltutional money of
gold and silver by the restoration by this Gov
ernment, independent of other Nations, of the
unrestricted coinage of both silver and gold
into standard money at the ratio of 16 to 1,
and upon the terms of exact equality existing
prior to 1873, such silver coin to be a full
legal tender, equally with gold, for all debts
and duties, public and private.
Resolved, That the delegates at large this day
chosen by this convention and the delegates
to the National convention from the several
Congressional districts, be, and they are hereby
Instructed to use all honorable means to se
cure the adoption of the principles contained
in tbe foregoing resolution by the National
Democratic Convention, to be held at Chicago
July 7, and to vote only, for candi
dates for President and Vice-President
who are known to be in full accord therewith,
and to accomplish these ends to cast the votes
from the State of Ohio as a unit, as the major
ity may determine.
After selecting the delegates and the
State ticket named the convention at 5
p. m. adjourned sine die.
BLAND IS THEIR CHOICE.
Silver Democrats of Texas to Sup-
port the Missouri Statesman
for the Presidency.
AUSTIN, Tex., June 24.â The silver
Democratic convenion adopted a platform
to-day which favors the free and unlimited
coinage of gold and silver at the ratio of 1G
to 1 independent of the action of any
nation, and demands that a law be enacted
by Congress making gold and silver coined
at that ratio full legal tender. Governor
Culbertson, J. H. Reagan, H. Clifton, H.
Duncan, Congressman Bailey, E. 0. Sen
ter, W. A. Oake and ex-Governor Hogg
were elected delegates.
The delegates were instructed to vote for
Bland if, in their judgment, at Chicago he
proves tbe most available free-silver Dem
ocrat. He was declared to be the choice
of the Democracy of Texas.
VICTORY IS ASSURED.
Representative Babcock Says the
Republican Nominees Will Ba
Elected.
KEW YORK, N. V., June 24. -A Her
ald special from Washington aays that
Representative Babcock srf Wisconsin, the
chairman of the Republican Congressional
Committee, has returned from the St.
Louis convention.
He believes that the Republicans will
have no difficulty in electing a large ma
jority of tne members of tbe next House
of Representatives, and that McKinley's
election is assured beyond all doubt. He
admits that the Republicans will lose
some votes on account of their strong
declaration against the free and unlimited
coinage of silver, but he believes that, on
the other hand, they will gain very largely
through the accession of gold men from
the Democratic ranks. He looks for a re
shaping of political lines to some extent
in all the States, and believes the Republi
cans will profit by the changes that will
take place.
At the rooms of the Democratic Con
gressional Committee there is not that
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1896.
confidence which characterizes the Re
publican committee and the action of the
Chicago convention is being awaited with
a great, deal of anxiety. Should the
declaration be for the free and unlimited
coinage of silver by the United States, in
dependent of other nations, it will be
practically useless to attempt to elect
representatives from many of the Eastern
districts. The committee will govern its
action largely by the action of the Chicago
convention, although it is probable that
sound money candidates will receive as
sistance from it, no matter what the
declaration of the convention may be on
the financial issue.
GREETED BY EDITORS.
Men cf the Press Pay Their Re-
spects to Major McKinley at
His Canton Home.
CANTON, Onio, June 24.â The interest
ing feature of the day in Canton was the
reception of Michigan editors and their
wives. An address was made by Editor
Gilson of Benton Harbor, to which Major
McKinley responded heartily.
Messages of congratulation reached
Major McKinley this afternoon from
Governor Bradley of Kentucky, Governor
Morrill of Kansas and Major-General O.
O. Howard.
Mr. McKinley received this evening the
following dispatch from Senator John M.
Thurston, cnairman of the notification
committtee:
"The notification committee will reach
Canton on a special train Monday fore
noon."
This message was made necessary by
reason of a false report sent out by the
Chicago Associated Press to-day stating
that the notification committee had
changed its plans and would not call on
Major McKinley until Tuesday.
To Select Silver Itelegates.
DENVER, Colo., June 21â Seven hun
dred delegates from every county in the
State will hold a convention to-morrow
for the purpose of selecting delegates to
the convention of the National silver
party to be held in St. Louis July 22.
Teller will probably be indorsed as Presi
dential candidate on a single plank,
though something may be added relative
to protection. The silver Republicans of
Colorado are enthusiastically supporting
this new party movement.
MAKING PAPER BULLETS,
The New Kind of Cartridges
Tried by the War
Department. ,
Experiments Result in the Selection
of a Harmless Contrivance for
Salutes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 24.â The
Call correspondent made inquiry at the
War Department to-day concerning the
report that paper bullets were to be used
in magazine rifles in tirine salutes. Gene
ral Flakier was absent from the depart
ment, but one of tbe chiefs of the bureau
made the following statement to the
correspondent:
"Y T es, it is true that we are going to issue
paper bullet cartridges to the army. In
order that your readers may clearly under
stand, I will say that the army now uses
about 800.000 of these blank cartridges
each year, so you can see that the cost is
considerable. The blanks are not all
used in firing salutes; in fact, very few are
used for that purpose. When a general
officer or other dignitary visits a port
cannon are fired in his iionor. A great
many magazine rifle cartridges are fired
over graves at funeral ceremonies, but the
most of them used in the army are fired
in skirmish and other drills. Of course,
you understand that the 45-caliber car
tridges used in the old Springfield rifles
have been replaced by 30-caliber cartridges
used in tbe new magazine gun, There
fore, the blank cartridges have been made
of brass, â¢bullet' and all, but in order to
cheapen the cost we have been experi
menting with wood and paper. We found
that the flying wood splinters were dan
gerous and that the paper bullets hereto
fore made were influenced by rain and
even by damp weather, so that they
swelled and would not fit the magazine.
We then experimented with water-proof
paper bullets and by coating them with
parafflne they gave very satisfactory re
sults. They are lust a trifle Bmaller than
the old paper bullets, so that even if there
should be any swelling they would yet fit
the gun and not stick. These water-proof
paper bullets have been experimented
with at Frankfort Arsenal and are now
pronounced perfect, and will be issued to
tte army upon requisition in place of the
old ones. The cost is only about one-half
that of the brass ones.
"Of course, you understand that these
blanK cartridges do not contain bullets,
but, in order tuat the cartridges will fit
the magazine, it is necessary to give
the tip of the cartridge the shape of a
bullet. The paper bullets are hollow, and
in the cavity will be filled smokeless
powder, as well as the charge in the shell
itself. Heretofore powder has only been
put in the shell, while the bullet has been
hollow, but we founa that the fragments
of flying brass, wood or paper ware danger
ous, and so we now charge the bullet with
powder also, so as to explode it before it
can do any damage."

INDIANA WANTS
FREE SILVER,
Hoosier State Democratic
Convention So De
clares.
SCENES OF DISORDER.
Hot Fight Over the Seating of
the Marion County
Delegation.
PLANKS FOR THE PLATFORM.
Governor Claude Matthews the Choice
for the Presidential
Nomination
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., June 24.â As
predicted, the silver men had control of
the Democratic State Convention to-day,
and although the small gold minority
made a desperate struggle they were
"turned down" mercilessly and a silver
platform adopted. The delegates at large
are : D. W. Voorhees, David Turpie, G. V.
Menzies and James McCabe.
The State ticket is as follows: Governor,
B. F. Shively, South Bend ; Lieutenant-
Governor, John Lawler, Salem; Secretary
of State, S. M. Ralston, Lebanon; Auditor,
Joseph T. Fanning, Indianapolis; Treas
urer, Morgan Chandler, Greenfield; Attor
ney-General, J. G. McNutt. Terre Haute.
Nominations for Appellate Judges, Super
intendent of Public lustruttion and State
Statistician were also made.
The convention was one of the stormiest
ever held in the State, the proceedings at
times being almost riotous. The first row
came when the report of the credentials
committee was read, displacing the gold
contestants of Marion County. The con
fusion was so great that a recess of thirty
minutes had to be taken. After this,
when the platform had been read, W. D.
Bynum, on behalf of the gold men, tried
to offer a minority report.
Chairman Bell declared him out of
order, but Bynum would not down.
Finally, after an hour and a half of wild
scenes, during which personal altercations
were narrowly prevented in one or two in
stances, Bynum was given five minutes
and made a motion to strike out the finan
cial plank and insert in its stead the plank
adopted at Chicago in 189?. Such a storm
of hoots and howls gieeted this that
Mr. Bynum was compelled to leave the
platform.
The convention then adopted the
original resolutions and completed its
business.
The convention was called to order this
morning at Tomiinson's Hall by State
Chairman Sterling B,"* Holt. The conven
tiou will nominate the full State ticket
from Governor down, will select delegates
to the National Convention and Presi
dential electors. In the matter of nomi
nations there is as yet little indication of
the action of the convention, except that
none who is not a radical free silver man
stands the ghost of a show of receiving
any favors at the hands of the gathering.
D. F. Shively of South Bend, a red-hot
silver man, probably leads 4or the Guber
natorial nomination.
All over the building were tastefully
decorated flags and big lithographs of
Claude Matthews, Indiana's choice for the
Presidency. No other Democratic face ap
peared apon the walls. President Cleve
land's likeness was conspicuous by its ab
sence from the decorations as well as his
name from the platform.
The report of tbe Oregon delegation de
veloped the fact that the silver people had
made a new move to down the Marion
County gold crowd by not recognizing the
district meeting of the night before and
requiring the Seventh District to hold an
other meeting with the silver contestants
seated.
As soon as the report was read Judge
Branyan moved as a substitute the name
of J. G. Shanklin for that of Menzie. By
num called for a rollcall on the original
motion, but was interrupted by Shanklin
himself, who came forward to withdraw
his name. He was greeted with cries of
"No! No!" There was the wildest de
light when he branched off into a silver
speech. A viva voce vote was taken on
the adoption of the whole report. It was
declared carried, though the noes were in
the majority. This carried with it the
throwing out of the Seventh District se
lections.
Holt at once introduced Permanent
Chairman Senator Bell of Fort Wayne.
The Marion County row was immedi
ately precipitated upon the convention
after the speech of the permanent chair
man. Bellamy read the report of the
credentials committee, the silver men
evidently having the better of it. The
report closed with a resol ution ordering
tbe delegates of tne Seventh District as
made up by the credentials committee to
retire and make new selections for dele
gates and Congressman. The report was
adopted under the operation of the
previous question amid very great con
fusion. In obedience to the order the
silver delegates from the Seventh left the
ball, but the gold delegates never left
their seats.
The platform was started on its way by
a motion for the previous question. By
num arose and a wild scene ensued. The
convention endeavored to howl him down.
Chairman Bell declared him out of order
and then declared the platform adopted,
but Bynuin gesticulated and declared that
he was acting under the rules.
The financial and tariff planks in the
platform are as follows:
We reaffirm our adherence to and faith in
the" Democratic doctrine of bimetallism, and
therefore wo demand the immediate restora
tion of bimetallism by tbe free and unrestricted
coinage of both silver and Rold as primary
money, at the ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting
the co-operation of Great Britain or other for
eign power, all such coinage to be full legal
tender in the payment of all debts, public and
private.
Resolved, That we believe tbe existing tariff
will be fully equal to all demands for needed
revenue for the expenses of the Government,
economically administered under the condi
tions which will arise from the restoration of
bimetallism.
The remainder of the platform favors
prompt adjustment, punctual and regular
payment of all pensions; believes in ac
cording all the rights of belligerency to
the people of Cuba; favors the election of
United States Senators by direct vote of
the people; opposes all subsidies of land
grants to private corporations; indorses
the administration of Governor Matthews,
commends him to the Democrats of the
United States as a candidate for the Presi
dency,instrncts the delegates from Indiana
to the National Convention to cast their
votes in his favor for President and in
structs the Indiana delegates to vote as a
unit upon all questions involving platform
or candidates in that convention; opposes
redemption and final cancellation of United
States notes (greenbacks) or any other
notes of certificates issued by the United
States to circulate as money; demands a
sufficient stable volume of money, gold,
silver and paper to meet the requirements
of our growing population and the con
stant increase of our productive indus
tries, and protests against the increase of
the public debt by the issue of interest
bearing bonds or otherwise in time of
peace.
When Mr. Bynum was finally given
recognition he attempted to offer a substi
tute for the financial plank as stated in
the foregoing, but after another scene of
great disorder was obliged to leave the
platform.
The convention then proceeded to tue
selection of delegates and a State ticket,
after completing which it adjourned sine
die.
ACCEPTED THE OREGON.
Secretary Herbert Pays the Union Iron
Works.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 24.âSecre
tary Herbert to-day formally accepted the
new battle-ship Oregon from the Union
iron Works of San Francisco. The re
mainder of the contract price was paid to
the company, with the exception of a
small sum retained to cover the cost of
any changes or repairs for whicn the con
tractors may be responsible.
ADMIRAL RAMSAY CHOSEN
Will Be the Naval Member of
the Board to Select the Deep-
Harbor Site.
Work to Bj Commenced in August or
September, When the Rival
Claims Are to Be Heard
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 24.â Rear-
Admiral Ramsay will be named as the
naval member of the board to determine
the location of a deep-water harbor for Port
Los Angeles in Santa Monica Bay or at San
Pedro. He will be only temporarily de
tached, and during his absence his place
as chief of the Bureau of Navigation will
be filled by Captain F. A. Cook.
Rear- Admiral Ramsay's selection is the
first step in the direction of carryine out
the law of Congress in connection with the
settlement of this controversy. T.'*e warm
debate attending the adoption of a pro
vision in regard to the location of the pro
posed deep-water harbor at Santa Monica
or at San Peilro will be recalled as well as
the criminations and recriminations in
volving the name of Huntington and his
railroad.
The matter, as finally passed upon by
Congress, provided that the location of
the harbor was to be determined by an
officer of the navy, "to be detailed by the
Secretary of the Navy"; an officer of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey, "to be de
tailed by the Superintendent of said sur
vey," and three experienced civil engi
neers sKilled in riparian work, who shall
be appointed by the President. The other
appointments will be extremely impor
tant, not only because of the large amount
of money involved, but on account of the
fight being waged by and against Presi
dent Huntington and the Southern Pacific
Railroad.
The board will probably not commence
its work until August or September, and
its duty will be to personally examine the
harbors, the decision of a majority of
which shall be final as to the location of
the harbor.
When the report of the board is sub
mitted the Secretary of War is empowered
to make contracts for the completion of
the improvements to the location adopted
at a cost not exceeding $2,900,000. In order
to prevent a monopoly of the use of the
harbor by tbe Southern Pacific, the act
provides that if the board shall determine
in favor of the construction ot a break
water at Port Los Angel "s, no expenditure
of any of the money appropriated shall be
made until the Southern Pacific Railroad
shall execute an aereement that any rail
road company or any corporation engaged
in tb.e business of transportation may
share in the use of the pier now con
structed at the port upon terms that both
parties may agree upon.
TWO WILD BOOK AGENTS.
They Predicted the End of the World To
ll ay.
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 24.â Henry
Koerner and Maurice Ruben, two Pitts
burg men, who made a prediction that the
world would end to-day, have attracted
tbe attention of the public several times.
Ruben is a Hebrew and his brother is the
owner of a large department store here.
He claims to be a convert to Christianity,
and has devoted much time to spiritual in
cantations.
The men made so much noise at night
that neighbors called the police. Rubens
relatives at one time had two insanity ex
perts examine him. They found him in
sane, and he was committed to Dixmont
Asylum. A few weeks later bis friend
Koerner got Ruben out on a writ of habeas
corpus,,and the judge lectured the physi
cians for committing him.
Since September Ruben and Koerner
have been lodging at the Oxford Hotel.
They make their living by selling Bibles
and religious publications for the Young
Men's Bible Society of Allegheny. The
hotel guests say there is nothing about
either man to suggest insanity.
FATAL RAILWAY WRECK.
One Man Killed and Two Injured in a
Smash- Up.
CHICAGO, 111., Jane 24.â Two freight
trains on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul Railway collided last night between
Monroe Center and Davis Junction. One
man was killed and two injured. Thomas
Moore, the fireman, was killed. A man
named Daley was badly crushed and will
die. Another man named Baer was se
riously hurt.
Thirty-four cars were smashed and
burned. The wrecK was caused by tbe
breaking in two of the west- bound freignt.
When the two sections met again several
cars were thrown on the east-bonnd track
just as the east-bound train came alone,
and it ran into the wrecK.

VICTORIES WON,

for It.
FOURTEEN MEN KILLED.
Battle With Filibusters in Which
the Rebels Were De
feated.
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND BACK.
He Will Consider the Several For
eign Questions That Are
Now Pending.
HAVANA, Cuba, June 24. â General
Gonzales Munoz reports that on June 19
he left the Brameales estate, near the
Cabanas province of Pinar del Rio, and
marched toward the Rubi Hills. The
rebels opened fire upon the troops from
strong positions, but after a vigorous
attack they were obliged to retreat. Con
tinuing their march on June 20, the troops
captured a rebel camp at Animar after a
short defense. The troops destroyed in
surgent plantations and burned over 300
huts. The rebels were commanded by
Bandera, Delgado and Diaz. They left
fourteen dead on the field and carried
away many wounded on their retreat.
Nine prisoners were taken by the Spanish
They will be summarily court-martialed.
The troops lost thirteen wounded, includ
ing Lieutenant Surg^nt.
A filibustering expedition which landed
recently between Varadero and Camarioca,
near Cardena3, had an engagement with
the troops under Colonel Gaston. The
fighting lasted five hours and the filibus
ters were dislodged from several posi
tions taken up by them.
The rebels," wno were commanded by
Ricardo Trujillo, lost twenty-three killed
and many wounded. The Spanish loss
was nineteen wounded, including a cap
tain. The troops are in pursuit of the
rebels, who fled into tbe interior.
Two brothers named Joaquin and Jaime
Bucet, who were accused of complicity in
the recent blowing up of bridges, have
confessed their guilt, but declare that they
caused the explosion as anarchists and
not as rebels.
THE CENAS QUESTION.
President Cleveland Will Consider It Itn-
mediately.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 24.â A Herald
special from Washington
President Cleveland will return to Wash
ington this afternoon and will then be on
the ground to consider the several pend
ing foreign questions. Secretary Olney,
who is also out of the city, having left here
Monday night, presumably for Massachu
setts, is also expected to return to-day or
to-morrow.
It is expected that one of the first sub
jects referred will be that of Cuba, al
thouerh it can be stated definitely that the
administration has no intention whatever
of changing its attitude on this question.
While not at all disturbed at the anger being
displayed by Spaniards against this coun
try, the authorities are watching closely
the developments in tne Spanish Cortes.
It is expected that the Ministry will
resolutely oppose the passage of any meas
ure having as its object a criticism of the
United States or a direction to take any
action against it. In case it should be
done, the Ministry, under the mode of
procedure in operation in Spain, will ask
for a vote of confidence, and if it fails to
receive it, it will step down and out, and
another Ministry favoring the views of the
majority will enter into power. In case
such a Ministry were formed it would
necessarily have to carry out the views of
its supporters, and then consequences
might be fraught with peril to the rela
tions between its Government and that of
the United States.
Senor Aguirre, a prominent advocate of
Cuban independence, who was for some
time connected with the official repre
sentation of the insurgents here, sharply
criticizes the representatives of the Cuban
Junta here, Senors Quesadu and Palma,
for what he declares to be their extrava
gant living and neglect of duty and their
alleged action in antagonizing every move
ment set on foot for the establishment of a
republic in Cuba. Senor Aguirre said:
"The expenses of Quesada and Palma here
are more than $50 a day. When the reso
lution recognizing the belligerency of
Cuba came up in Congress the members
who were desirous of aiding the' struggling
revolutionists consulted Quesada and
Palma as to what was best to be done.
They informed the Representatives that
they did not desire the resolution to pass.
What they wanted was armed intervention
by this country.
"So, also, when the question of the joint
resolution came up Quesada and Palma
fought it. They urged that a joint resolu
tion would look like an attempt to over
ride the President and they did not wish
It. They prevented its introduction in the
House. They could not prevent its intro
duction in the Senate, but through Sena
tors Lodge, Cameron and others they
killed it in the committee.
"So absolutely nothing has been accom
plished for all the outlay of money by the
legation."
Quesada and Palma deny Senor Agulrre's
charges in toto.
THEIR GOD IS KILLED.
And Now the Matabeles Are Expected to
Become Discouraged and Stop
Fighting.
LONDON, JÂ£kg., June 24.â The Daily
Telegraph to-morrow will have dispatches
from Pretoria and Kimberly sayins that a
rumor is being circulated in those places
to the effect that the natives captured Fort
Salisbury, killed and mutilated fifty white
inhabitants and smashed the Maxim guns
in the place.
The foregoing report, however, lacks
confirmation, as do the rumors recently
current that Fort Salisbury, which has
been hard pressed by the natives, has
been relieved. There has been much fight
ing in various places in the disturbed dis
trict in the last few days.
Burnham, tbe American scout, found in
a cave in the Matoppo hills the famous
Matabele god Mlimo, the prompter and
fosterer of the outbreak, and vainly tried
to capture Mlimo alive, but, being unable
to do so, killed him. It is believed that
the death of their god will discourage the
natives and lead to the suppression of
the revolt.

STREET RAILWAY LOOTED.
Indianapolis Financiers Make
Some Peculiar Business
Moves.
Millions of Dollars Lost to the Stock
holders of a Prosperous
Company.
CHICAGO, 111., June 24.â A special
from Indianapolis says: The long expected
sensational exposure in the alleged wreck
ing of the Indianapolis Citizens' Railway
Comrany cume yesterday, when the law
yers for the frozen-out stockholders issued
a statement to the holders of 50,000 shares
in Chicago, Pittsburg, Philadeh>hia and
New York, saying that the present man
agement should be called on at once to
account for $7,813,000 in stocks, bonds,
cash and floating debt.
The circular yays that after careful in
vestigation the lawyers can find no trace
of 14,000,000 out of a $5,000,000 issue of
stock ; $3,0U0.000 out of a $4,000,000 bond
issue; $513,000 in net receipts during the
last tii'ee years, nor for what purpose
$3,000,000 of" floating debt addittonwas re
quirea uuring the same time.
The circular shows that Verner & Mc-
Kee, who purchased the plant from Sam
uel W. Allerton three years a o for $3,225,
--000, owned a controling interest, becoming
directors and dictating the policy; that
they have unloaded all but 1281 shares of
their holdings, yet they still retain con
trol of the directory and refuse to make an
accounting.
The board of directors now holds but
2040 share?. The shares have fallen from
175 to 26)^ i' 1 the mean time, and the
charge is made that some one ba* been en
deavoring'to make a good coup at the ex
pense of the company.
From the statement of President Mason
it is learned that the receipts have been
$171,000 annually above all expanses and
that now, with $513,000 net profits in three
years, there have been no dividends and
no statement i-sued by the directors.
When Verner & McKee secured tne roa<l
its stock was increased to $5,000,000 and
a bonded mortgage placed on it for
$4,000,000.
The stockholders say the step taken yes
terday will lead to an investigation that
will expose one of the boldest schemes to
unload stock and freeze out the pur
chasers that has been attempted in recent
years. The enormous profits were held
out to investors who bought tbe stock un
til it fell to 50 as a gilt-edged invest
ment. Since then different rumors hava
caused purchasers to ignore the stock and
the price ha* been gradually dec-lining.

ARREST OF HARRISON.
The Action of Venezuela in
Making a Crown Surveyor
a Prisoner.
STEPS TOWARD ARBITRATION.
An Interesting Acknowledgment Re
lating to Disputes on American
Territory.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jane 24.-As
soon as Secretary Olney returns to the
State Department, and he is confidently
expected to-morrow, he will receive from
Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Em
bassador, a request from the British Gov
ernment to use his good offices with
Venezuela to secure the release from im
prisonment of Crown Surveyor Harrison,
who is represented to have bÂ«en arrestt d
by Venezuelan police while he was en
gaged in constructing a road connecting
the Barima and Cuyuni rivers in the dis
puted territory.
This action of Great Britain is consid
ered in diplomatic circles a radical de
parture from the usual ultimatum methods
hitherto practiced on American republics,
and much significance is attached to this
tact as probably indicating the consider
able progress made toward an arbitration
agreement and the practical acknowledg
ment that the United States is a party in
interest in the Venezuelan dispute as well
as in future controversies regarding terri
tory on the American continent.
While it is universally agreed that the
new incident is exceedingly unfortunate
just at tins juncture there is croat diversity
of opinion in tiling the blame. Even the
British Government has the most indefi
nite knowledge of the exact locality where
the arrest took place, although it is
claimed that the surveying party had no
authority to go outside of the territory oc
cupied exclusively by English for the past
ten years.
The Venezuelans, however, find consid
erable satisfaction in the knowledge that
Great Britain will appeal to Secretary
y as indicating that it is not of so se
rious a nature as at first apprehended.
They place the whole blame for what has
occurred on Joseph Chamberlain's ag
gressive foreign policy. They point to the
fact that under aate of DecemDer 19, 1894,
they complained to Secretary Gresham of
the proposed road udoii which Surveyor
Harrihon was employed and called atten
tion to the fact that as the route lay in
Venezuelan territory a conflict would be
unavoidable, The appeal was effective for
the time being.
Ths road was abandoned until August
of last year, when the Secretary of State
for tne Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain,
sent to British Guiana his demand for the
colonies to raise funds for machine guns,
an increased police force and the construc
tion of the Baiima road. This was re
sisted by the Colonial Legislature, with
the exception of defense armament, until
the arrival of the new Governor from Eng
land a few months ago, when they were
induced to appropriate for a survey of the
road.
Venezuela r.ow claims that the responsi
bility rests wholly with Great Britain after
the warning sent to the Foreign Office
through colonial as well as through United
States channels. It is contended at the
legation here that the Venezuelan authori
ties who made the arrest must of necessity
liave been in their own territory, a3 they
are not permitted to cross the frontier
under any circumstances.
The two English posts are on the right
bank of the Cuyuni and the left bank of
the Amacura. Those of Venezuela are
directly opposite them, and this status quo
has been rigidly observed by the Vene
znelans. In their opinion Harrison must
have been arrested within the Venezuelan
line, and only after a warning to keep out.
The Venezuelans to a man, also, are
aware that they have everything to gain
by peaceful methods, and it is incredible
to their friends here that they could have
so disobeyed orders as to break the status
quo. It is said, however, that if Secretary
Olney calls on Venezuela in response to
(ireat Britain's request a full report
of the affair will undoubtedly be forth
coming as soon as the Caracas authorities
can investigate.

An Exciting Four-Cornered Rowing Race in
Which Very Fine Sporf Is Wit

v;ts; University of Pennsylvania lapped
on the crimson, and Columbia coming
hopelessly four lengths astern.
Then a nest ' Prate race commenced. Inch

until a half a mile fron> home the two
were level and going after Cornell. Oppo
site the Cornell ijoatiiou&e the Cornells
were a clear length in front of Pennsyl
vania and Harvard, who were rowing bow
and bow in a desperate race.
The Harvard coxswain shouted at his
men for a final effort. Cornell swept to
the finish line a length and a quarter
ahead of Harvard, who were three-quart
ers of a length in front of the Qnakers.
Columbia came in completely played out

BROWN LOWERS HIS RECORD.
The California Sprinter Covers a Mile
in 4:34 and Was Simply Out
for Exercise.
PORTLAND, Or., June 24.â A party of
seven tanned and lusty-looking young
men from the famous Olympic Club of San
Francisco arrived in Portland this morn
ing on the Shasta special over the South
ern Pacific.
The athletes are quartered at the Port
land Hotel and this afternoon they are
loosening up their muscles from the effects
of the long ride. On to-night's steamer
from California two more members of the
athletic team will arrive, they choosing to
take advantage of a sea voyage.
The members of the team are: R. W.
Edgren, W. C. Patterson, John Brunton,
P. M. Wand, F. R. Butz. D. E. Brown, M.
H. Collins and C. T. Krelling, the latter
two to arrive on the steamer. Beside these
there are Captain Leonard Gill, who is
managing the team, and W. R. Misner,
one of the stanch supporters of the
Olympic team, who comes in the capacity
of official chaperon and rooter for the vis
itors'success. The financial end of mat
ters is looked after by A. Acheson. The
boys are all well and report a fine trip.
The party was met at the depot by a
committee composed of B. F. Stevens,
John F. Logan, H. E. Judge, Rodney
Glisan and Louis J. Goldsmith of the
Multr.omah Club, which will entertain the
visitors until Saturday, when the most
notable athletic contest between the ath
letes of the North and South Pacific Coast
that has ever been seen yet will be held.
Judging from the widespread interest felt
in the games no previous meeting of the
Californians and Oregonians has ever been
by half so important.
The visiting athletes will be tendered a
reception to-night by the Multnomah
Club. Joseph N. Teal will welcome the
visitors in a speech and an informal pro
gramme will follow. A large number of
weli-known ex-Californians have arranged
to make the Olympic members' stay in
the city as pleasant as possible. If the
visitors are allowed their preference in the
arrangement of the programme, as usually
the visiting team is, the half mile will be
last on the programme. Dave Brown will
run in this event, and if the Olympic cap
tain finds that they need the points Brun
ton will run in this with him. Brown may
run the mile by himself, and the captain
says of him:
â¢â¢\ou will miss a fine exhibition if you
don't see Brown run. He is the best man
on the coast and holds the record at 4:36.
He has a magnificent stride. In a trial
feat by himself last Saturday he made it
in 4:34."
Large delegations of visitors from the
Corvallis Agricultural College, the State
University and the Willamette Univer
sity at Eugene will come to see the
games, besides hundreds from nearer
towns. In anticipation of this the agents
of all railway lines centering in Portland
have been notified to place on sale excur
sion tickets for the occasion. The tickets
will be good to return home on Monday.
On Saturday night there will be an espe
cially interesting exhibition at the Mult
nomah Club, when Krelling, the California
pet, wrestles with Greenland, the Multno
mah champion.
THE COLEVILLE RESERVATION
Will Be Thrown Open to Homesteaders
Within Forty Days.
PORTLAND, Or., June 24.â The north
half of the Colville Indian reservation,
comprising several thousand acres in
Washington and Idaho, will be thrown
open to homestead settlement within forty
days, according to Commissioner S. W. La
moreaux of the United States Land Office,
who was here recently with General Land
Agent MiUs of the Southern Pacific and a
party of friends. One of the principal ob
jects of Commissioner Larnoroux's trip
through the West is to consult with the
Surveyor- General of Oregon and expedite
the work. The party returns home via
California and Salt Lake. The opening of
this vast tract of land is expected to pro
duce a big boom for immigration to the
Northwest.
"The Colville reservation will be thrown
open in forty days from the time I return
to the East, provided the Secretary agrees
with me," said Commissioner Lamo
reux. "I hope to have a force of sur
veyors at work on the reservation within
a few days from the time I return. This
year $550,000 was available for the Land
Department, whicti sum is far in excess of
the usual amount, and will aid very ma
terially in furthering the work. The land
offices I have visited are in excellent con
dition. The work of cranting patents is
done more quickly and smoothly now
than evpr before. In several instances in
the Missoula office papents have been re
ceived in forty days, whereas it used to
take months and innumerable letters.
For the year ending June 30, 1896, the
number of entries filed will be far in ex
cess of those of the year ending June 30,
1895. I am informed that the number of
mineral land contests with the railroads
is less this year than ever before."
HANGED AT HIGHLANDS.
An Insane Patient Strangled Himself
With a Sheet.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., June 24 â
Albert Sibley, an inmate of the Highlands
asylum, committed suicide last night by
hanging. He took a sheet from his bed,
attached one end to the iron bars of the
window and tied the other end around his
neck. He then threw himself forward
and slowly strangled.
Sibley was committed from Ventura
County and was about 30 years of age. He
was considered one of the curables, and
had been on parole during a portion of the
time of his confinement. At one time he
was allowed to go home in company with
his mother. He imagined himself to be
Jesus Christ and was in the habit of
preaching sermons to those with whom
he came in contact. He came from Napa
when a transfer of patients was made to
the new asvluna at Highlands.
The Coroner this morning held an in
quest and a verdict in accordance with the
above statement was returned. The
asylum authorities were exonerated from
all blame.
ST. HELENA EXERCISED.
Story of a Farmer Who Imagines He
Has Setn Dunham.
ST. HELENA, Cal., June 24.â City
Marshal Johnson and Constable Spurr
are on the road north of Calistoga hunting
Murderer Dunham. At 11 o'clock to-day
James Dowdell, a well-known farmer who
lives a mile south of St. Helena, while
driving to town was passed by a man on a
bicycle riding very hard and carrying a
double-barreled shotgun. When about
thirty yards ahead the bicyclist dis
mounted, laid his wheel on the side of
the road and asked Dowdell for a ride in
his wagon. Answering an inquiry as to
the bicycle, the stranger said a boy would
come along soon and bring it to town,
and they rode off, leaving it in the road.
Dowdell noticed that the passenger was
very alert and kept his gun in a conveni
ent position. He said that he came from
Napa, but offered no explanation of him
self or his strange conduct. Arriving in
town he hurriedly dismounted and passed
on toward Calistoga.
Dowdell going home soon after noticed
that the bicycle was gone. Then he be
thought himself of the resemblance of
this strange passenger to Dunham and
hunting up his picture in The Call was
convinced that he was the much-wanted
individual. He immediately came to St.
Helena and notified the officers.
Constable Spurr noticed the man as he
pot out of Dowdell's wagon and recalled
that his features and general description
were very much like those of Dunham.
The suspect was seen this afternoon on
the Calistoga road, riding very hard.
When he passed through town he had on
a gray cap, no coat, light trousers, a sash
around the waist, wore large glasses and
looked worn and anxious.
A CITRUS BELT MYSTERY

LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 24.â The
murder of Edward White, which occurred

one of the greatest mysteries known in
the annals of crime in California. This
mystery, it is thought, has been cleared
by the arrest of Hariy Hezekiah and
"Billy" Van Horn.
Hezekiah is a teamster who resides with
his mother, at lf>l4 St. Janus street. He
was in love with Georgie Abbott, the
woman who was with White when he was
shotdown and had asked her to become
his wife. He has a running mate named
"Billy" Van Horn, a tamale-vender, who
holds forth in what is known as "Dog
town." Van Horn is a iate arrival from
Arizona.
Hezekiah was with the Abbott woman
the night before the killing. The night of
the murder, early in the evening, both
men were at Georgie AbbotCs house when
White called. Soon after White ana Geor
gie Abbott left. As they were passing
Hezekiah asked White what time it was.
White told him and then in company with
the woman came down town, finally bring
ing up at the Vienna Buffet, where they
remained until 10:30 o'clock. When they
left the place they were followed by Heze-
K';Â»h and Van Horn, who had also fol
lowed them from the woman's house.
The men tally with the description of
the two men seen by the private watch
man. Hezekiah was arrested Sunday night
and Van Horn was taken into custody on
Monday night.
Detective Goodman found in Van Horn's
room a large 4i-caliber Colt's revolver
with one empty cartridge. Dr. Bryant,
when examining the wound, said that the
buliet which went through White was
from such a weapon. This is not all the
evidence that Goodman has collected.
He has other important facts which will
only be disclosed when the men come up
for examination. The two suspects are
now in jail.
STRIKERS WIN AT LAST.
A Sew Mexican Judge Decides That They
May Not Re Blacklisted.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 24.â A deci
sion of great importance to blacklisted
railway employes listed during the strike
of 1894 has just been handed down by
Judge Collier of the Second New Mexico
District Court at Albuquerque. The sali
ent points of the decision follow:
"It appearing to the court that because
of membership in an order known as the
American Railway Union certain em
ployes of the receivers having in charge
the assets of defendant (A. and P. Com
pany) refused to perform their duties as
employes and were discharged from the
employment of the then receivers, and.
"It further appearing that in the opin
ion of the court such connection should
not be considered a bar to employment by
the receivers if applicants aie in other re
spects proper persons to be employed, tne
court being fully advised, it is ordered ad
judgeii and decreed that hereafter in the
employment of applicants desiring service
with the receivers no discrimination shall
be made against any one because of -mem
bership in said union, or because of refusal
to perform services during said 'strike,'
and the receiver by this court is hereby di
rected to give all needful instructions for
the carrying out in good faith of this
order."
LOS ANGELES CLAIMANTS.
liro More Great Grandchildren of Micah
l>yer Discovered.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 24.â The
family and friends of Dr. Will C. Lindley.
brother of Hervey Lindley, found much to
interest them in the recent story printed
in The Call, giving an account of the
heirship of the children of -Mayor Davie
of Oakland to an immense spoliation claim
due from the Congress of the United
States and amounting to $55,000,000.
The money was paid by France and held
in trust by the United States for depreda
tions to private persons and property dur
ing the exciting years about the end of the
last century. It appears that the two
little children of Dr. Lindley, Henry Mil
ton Liadleyand Elsie S. Lindley, are great
grandchildren of Micah Dyer^ and stand
in the same relation to the millions as
the Davie children. They would share
equally with them in the distribution of
this great amount of money.

BENT ON PARTY VICTORY
Prominent Men Are Called To
gether to Devise Ways
and Means.
TIME TAKEN BY THE FORELOCK
No Stone Will Bs Left Unturned in
Battling for the Cause of
Protection.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 24.â The Repub
lican County Central Committee at a meet
ing this afternoon named over 200 of the
most prominent Republicans of the county
to meet at Grand Army Hall in this city,
Saturday, July 11, to devise ways and
means which, in their judgment, will best
promote the interests of the Republican
party in this county during the coming
National campaign.
The appointments were made"in answer
to a petition from prominent Republicans,
who desired a meeting to reorganize and
advance local party interests. Those
named are from all parts and sections of
the county, and include men of all call
ings.
The committee also adopted the follow
ing strong resolutions:
Whereas, The vital questions facing the Re
publican party this yeak admonish us that
timely organization in this county is impera
tive in order to adopt such means as will in
sure the polling of a full Republican vote at
the coming election; and whereas, we are con
vinced that the evil tendencies ana disastrous
results of the Democratic administration of
this country have become so manifest to the
people at large as to prove that in all efforts
to promote good Government, progressive leg
islation in reference to immigration and per
taining to monetary matters and general Na
tional security as enjoyed by this Nation prior
to the advent of the present administration,
the people's chief reliance must be in the Re
publican party and tne triumph of its princi
ples, and believing that "protection" is of in
estimable value to the general Interests of this
country, and that a return to such a system
will again enable our citizens, agricultural
and industrial as well as commercial, to enjoy
the fruits of their labor in a manner be
fitting Americans, and will again make pos
sible that high standard of prosperity which a
fostering care of our domestic industries made
possible in tne past, thus again elevating the
standard of our working people far above that
of monarchical Europe, and by and through
progressive prosperity still bcuer enabling us
to extend that liberal public instruction which
constitutes the strength, and glory of our coun
try, and which is tne foundation of patriotic
character and the talisman of our unification
in National patriotic sentiment and the conse
quent upward trend and purpose of our pec
pie.
And last, but not least, in order to avoid all
local jealousy and promote harmony of thought
and action and to best advance the general
interests of the grand old party of the immor
tal Lincoln, Grant and Blame, we now here re
affirm our allegiance to the principles of the
Republican party and invite the co-opera
tion of all patriotic men, without regard to
previous party affiliations, to organize and
maintain a County Republican Club in aid of
the success of the Republican ticket and Re
publican principles, which success we are re
solved to achieve.
THE PARKER WILL CONTEST.
Judge I'ate rnon Presents the Issues for
the Jury's Consideration.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 24.â 1n the
Parker will contest the entire forenoon
was taken up in argument as to whether
the will as a part could be declared in
valid, the attorneys for the contestant
having abandoned the attempt to break
the will, except as to the subsidiary legacy
given to Jane Pomeroy. The matter was
argued by Coogan and Patterson for the
contestant and Delmas and Spencer for
the respondents.
Judge Paterson presented the following
issues to be submitted to the jury:
Was G. H. Parker of sound and disposing
mind and memory on October 15, 1892?
Was the document executed by G. H. Parker
on that day procured to be made through the
fraud of Jane, Noah and Marshal Pomeroy!
Was the document procured to be made
through their undue influences?
Was G. H. Parker on April 28, 1893, the date
of the first codicil, of sound and disposing
mind?
Whs said codicil procured through the fraud
or undue influence of the Pomeroy's?
Was G. H. Parker on July 5, 1893, the date of
the execution of the second codicil, of sound
and disposing mind?
Was said second codicil procured to be made
through the fraud or undue influence of the
Pomeroy a?
Was Parker acting under an insane delusion
or the fraud or undue influence of the Pome
roys when the provision was made by which,
if Edward ParKer should die before his wife,
the trustees should pay over to Jane Pomeroy
half of nil the property remaining after lega
cies had been paid ?
Was G. H. Parker acting under the insane
delusion, the fraud or undue influence of the
Pomeroys when that provision in the will was
made making Marshal Pomeroy the residuary
legatee of the other remaining half?
Did the same influence exist when the other
bequests were made ?
The counsel for proponents asked that
the jury be instructed not to consider the
testimony of witnesses as to the mental
condition of George H. Parker, unless the
witness had given a reason for forming
such an opinion. They also wanted the J
question as to the soundness of Parker's
mind eliminated from the issues to the
jury, but the court refused to do so.
Judge Reynolds then took the matter
under advisement until 2:30 o'clock, when
he decided that no special part of the will
could be attacked, but that the will as a
whole is either valid or invalid. In decid
ing the matter, the court said:
I have given the matter the most careful
consideration. After examining the petition
1 can see nothing in it attacking one special
part of the will only. Any special issue must
be set up in the issue. To single out one por
tion of the will and say that the testntoi made
it under the undue influence of certain parties
or a delusion, while in making the rest "of the
will he was of sound normal mind, cannot be
done. The will is either valid or invalid as a
whole.
Attorney Coogan then beean the argu
ment before the jury in behalf of the con
testants.

LAUNCHING OF THE TAHOE.
Baby Bliss Christened the Boat
and Lisped Its Pretty
Name.
The N w Craft Is Thought to Be the
Fastest of Its Kind Now
Afloat.
, McKINNEYS LANDING, Lake Ta
hoe, Cal., June 24. â Hundreds of people
gathered early in Glenbrook this morning
to witness the launching of the new
steamer Tahoe. The Meteor went to
I McKinneys at 4:30 o'clock a. at. and
i conveyed the guests across the lake.
' It was feared last nignt that the water
would be too rough for the launch
ing to-day, but toward morning the breeze
died down and the ceremony went off
without a hitch.
Glenbrook was a mass of bunting and
flags, as was the steamer and stand on
I which the exercises took place. At 11 A. M.
I the United States Inspectors arrived from
San Francisco and inspected the hull be
fore she went into the water. At 12 o'clock,
the hour for launching, Baby Bliss, aged
2 years, son of William Bliss, was seated
on an elevated stand and calling out the
name "Tahoe," let go the ribbon at
tached to the champagne bottle and
christened the boat. Amid booming of
cannon, screeching of whistles and music
of bands the pretty little craft slid into
the water and was towed outward.
Robert Forsyth of the Union Iron
Works arrived from San Francisco this
morning. Messrs. Forsyth, Gregg, Car
negie, Smith, Young and McKenna had
charge of .the construction. James Gregg
had full charge of the launching and it is
needless to say both the building and
launching were a grand success. Mr.
Eckert got up the specifications and drew
the lines.
Ecichert also drew the lines for the Me
teor, launched at Lake Tahoe twenty years
ago, and the fastest boat in the world of
its size at the time of launching, its speed
being twenty-one miles per hour. There
is no doubt the Tahne will show itself to
be the fastest of its kind on its trial trip.
It is claimed that the Union Iron Works
has laid out over $13,000 on extras, over
what the specifications called for. Too
much praise cannot be given the company
and its employes for the building of the
finest boat of its sort with machinery to
run it that has ever been floated. The
Tahoe is about 170 feet long by 18 feet
beam and of 1200 horse power. It has a
steel hull, twin propellers to turn 400 rev
olutions per minute, electric lichts and
all modern appliances. A dining-room
and all conveniences are provided for
guests. There is also a 4000-candle power
searchlight for use at night.
The old and well-known lake pilot. Cap
tain Pomine, will command the Tahoe,
and he has an efficient crew to assist him.
CONSIDERS HIMSELF LUCKY.
One of Fresno's Forty Thieves Sent to
Prison for Seven Years.
FRESNO, Cal., June 24.â E. E.Jeffords,
the young man who was convicted in the
Superior Court a few days ago on a charge
of robbery, was this morning sentenced
by Judge Carter to seven years' imprison
ment in San Quentin. The prisoner after
wards expressed himself as much sur
prised at the judgment, having expected a
mucn severer sentence. In passing sen
tence Judge Carter spoke as if he had
made it a heavy one, making a review of
the evidence and asserting that the crime
was deserving of severe punishment. Jef
fords belonged to the famous gang of forty
thieves of Tulare County and was con
victed of the charge of robbing a Portu
guese sheep camp near Selma last June.
PINE RIDGE OFFENDERS.
An Aged Couple Arrested for Illegally
Selling Liquor.
FRESNO, Cal., June 24. âMichael Burns
and wife, an aged couple residing on Pine
Ridge, were arrested last night by Deputy
United States Marshal Bart Alford on a
charge of selling liquor without a license.
A son of the couple and a man named
Chris Wolf have been conducting a saloon
in a teni near the sawmills of the Fresno
Flume and Irrigation Company. It is
alleged that the prisoners have furnished
means for conducting the saloon and have
a part interest in it. The Federal authori
ties say that this is the beginning of an
effort to put a stop to the extensive illegal
dispensation of liquors in the mountains,
the chief evil of these places being furnish
ing the "firewater" to Indians.
San Bernardino Accident
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., June 24.â
The ten-months-old infant of Mr. and Mrs.

FATHER JAMES
CLEARY HONORED,
Twenty-Fifth Anniversary
of His Admission to
Orders.
IMPRESSIVE EXERCISES.
Presented With a Silver Chalice
by the Children of His
Parish.
FRIENDSHIP OF HIS PEOPLE.
Solemn High Mass Celebrated by
Archbishop Riordan of San
Francisco.
PETALTJMA, Cal., Jane 24.â T0-day
one of the city pastors was highly Lon
ored. Not with a grand display, but with
a feeling of reverence and thankfulness,
the parishioners and friends of Rev.
Father Cleary, the pastor of St. Vincent's
Church of this city, celebrated the twenty
fifth anniversary of the ordination of their
pastor and friend to the priesthood.
On Tuesday morning the little children
of St. Vincent's School presented their
pastor with an elegant solid silver chalice,
which they purchased in order to surprise
him. To-night the final scene was en
acted when a committee of young men
called at the pastor's residence and pre
sented to Father Cleary a testimonial from
the people.
The solemn high mass at St. Vincent's
Church to-day eclipsed any scene Hereto
fore enacted at this house of worship.
His Grace Archbishop Riordan of San
Francisco was present, with many other
prominent members of the clergy, and the
big edifice could not contain half of the
citizens who sought admission. All classes
and denominations were represented, and
the public turned out to honor Father
Cleary. In accordance with the custom
on such occasions, the latter was celebrant
at the mass. Rev. Father John Nugent of
St. Brendan's Church, San Francisco,
acted as deacon ; Father Cassin of St.
Rose's Church, Santa Rosa, was master of
ceremonies; Father M. Riordan of Menlo
Park was sub-deacon; Rev. Father Lagan
of St. Raphael's Church, San Rafael, de
livered the address and paid a glowine
tribute to the honored priest. His remarks
were iell of feeling, and were heartily ap
preciated by the big congregation.
At the conclusion of the solemn high
mas 3 Archbishop Riordan made a brief
address to the audience, after which
Father Cleary entertained his visitors at
dinner, and the afternoon was pleasantly
spent in a reunion and with congratula
tions.
Rev. Father James Cleary is a native of
Alienstown, County Wexford, Ireland.
After a completion of his schooling, en
dowed with a splendid secular and ecclesi
astical education, the young clergyman
volunteered for the California mission.
He has been engaged at his sacred duties
since 1871, the year of his arrival in Oak
land. For two years he was assistant to
Father King, and in 1873 came to PÂ«ta
luma, where for twenty-three consecutive
years he has labored for the welfare of his
flock. Loving and beloved, he holds a
place in the affections not only of his own
people but of the community at large,
which places the reverend father in a posi
tion that is an enviable one indeed.
Tuesday evening's commencement ex
ercises of the St. Vincent's Academy must
have been a triumph for the father, for by
his efforts the school was erected, main
tained and reared to its present efficient
standard.
During the more than score of years
that the pastor has labored here he has
always been ready and willing to aid any
public enterprise, and his assistance has
been of great value to the city. The har
mony and accord which prevails among
his flock is but an echo of his teaching. A
gentleman of the old school, courteous
and hospitable to all alike, Father Cleary
is revered and beloved with a sincerity
that is touching.
It has often been the wish of his
superiors in the church to send Father
Cleary to otner and larger fields, but the
good priest was as eager to remain in Peta
luma as his people were emphatic in their
desire to retain him.
Father Cleary ib now in Mb fifty-fifth
year, and his hundreds of friends have
bnt one desire, and that is that they may
gather at his golden jubilee here in Peta
luma in the same church and amid the
sam c scenes.

One of the most northerly and yet one of

point, is Belhngham Eay, upon which are
located the twin cities. New Whatcom and
Fairhaven, the former having a popula
tion of about SOOO and the latter about
2000, making a total population of about
10.0C0 practically within one city.
Situated as it is nearly opposite the
Straits of San Juan de Fuca, surrounded
by laree natural resources for agriculture,
mining, timber and fishing; having three
transcontinental railroads as outlets for
domestic and inland commerce, and sev
eral lines of steamers, be^i ies sailing ves
sels, as an outlet for foreign and coastwise
traffic; with forty-five shingle-mills in
Hctive operation in 18ft.">, having an output
of 488,600,000 shingles; eleven sawmills,
with an output of 37,290,000 feet of cedar
a:id fir lumber; four coal mines, three box
and woodenware factories and eight sal
mon canneries, besides several other man
ufacturing establishments of minor im
portance located at this point, or imme
diately tributary thereto, giving employ
ment in various industries other than
agricultural to 3000 men, and having a
payroll during the same year (1895)
amounting to about $1,200,000, it may be
understood upon what the importance,
commercially and industrially, and the
prosperity of this place depends.
New Wiiatcom is not only fortunately
situated as an industrial center, but also
has the advantage of being the county
seat of Whatcom County, one of the larg-

est in the State; of being well located upon
one of the best harbors on the sound; of
having an excellent water supply from
Lake Whatcom. a body of water twelve
miles long and 600 feet deep of pure, cool,
freestone water upon a level 316 feet above
and about three miles distant from the
city; an extensive sewer system, electric
motor and streetcar lines, good public
buildings, a public library, the best of
grade schools and hick school, an active
and energetic Board of Trade, daily news
papers; in fact all the conveniences, pub
lic and private, found in our larger cities.
Besides this New Whatcom is so located
that, while the islands serve to break the
force of the ocean storms, yet it enjoys
the cool sea air and moderate, even tem
perature coming from the Japan currents
of the Pacific the year around, and the
Olympic Mountains situated almost west,
upon the western peninsula of Washing
ton, serve to precipitate so much of the
moisture coming from these currents that
the rainfall is only about half that nj tne
west coast, being about the same in inches
as in Chicago.
Agricultural iy there are about 300,000
acres of land adapted to this purpose, im
mediately surrounding or tributary,
through which 1020 miles of roads radiate
' from the city of New Whatcom as a cen
terâsixty-one miles of which are graded
and planked, ten miles graded and grav
eled and 950 miles partially graded or im
proved. This area and territory, agri
culturally, is destined to become one of
the most prolific and profitable to the
orchardist, the market gardener and dairy
man in the world. Moderate, even cli
mate, the rich soil of the Nooksack River
bottom and the soil of the uplands, so
well adapted to fruit-raising, has already
brought the territory into prominence in
National expositions and the commercial
world.
When it is considered that nearly all of
this developmentâ agricultural, commer
cial and industrial â has been made within
the last six years; that four years ago there .
was not a cannery in Whatcorn County
and the fisheries were almost unknown, nor
scarcely a shingle-mill in operation â not
even a road in the county over which a team
could be driven with ease â it may serve to
demonstrate what an enterprising, push
ing people can do to make a forest and a
wilderness, having rich native resources,
a hive of industry and a community of
happy homes and growing prosperity.
The development of these resources is
still in its infancy and capital backed by
experience can find every avenue open for
investment in Industrial interprises.
No longer are corner lots and specula
tion offered as a field of investment, but
active enterprise and industrial develop
ment.

Forest Fires Threaten the Mining Town
of Sandon, B. C.
SPOKANE, Wash., June 24.â As the
Spokane and Northern train left Kaslo,
B. C, for this city this morning, a message
came over the wire from Sandon, twenty
miles up in the Slocan district, statine
that the town was threatened with de
struction from the forest fires which sur
rounded it. A few minutes later com-
nmnication with Sandon was cut off, and
it is believed the fire has reached the line.
All day efforts have been made to re
establish communication to obtain further
information from the besieged town, but
without avail. Sandon is a mining camp
of about 200 inhabitants.

PASADENA, Cal., June 24.â The non

Dunham at Santa Clara College, positively
identified him as the complete opposite of
the criminal and the sensation collapsed.

MONTEREY ELECTION FRAUDS.
The Grand Jury Hakes a Report of Jta
Investigation.
MONTEREY, Cal., June 24.â Some
time ago the Monterey city election frauds
caused so much excitement that the Grand
Jury took it in hand, and now, after a ses
sion of ten days, that body has made the
following partial report to Judge N. A.
Dorn:
In obedlance to your Honor's instructions
we have investigated the alleged Monterey
city election Jrauds. We have caused subpenas
to be issued for a great number of witnesses
and made as thorough examination of the
case as the infoimation obtainable permitted.
That the grossest frauds have been practiced
there can be no doubt, but on account of the
conflicting evidence and the many other
features in the cuee giving rise to reasonable
doubts, we find ourselves unable to connect
any person with the commission of the crime.
We trust, however, that with the asnisttinee of
the officers whose duty 1 1 is to ferret out crime
and the co-operation of the citizens of Monte
rey who are in favor of upholding the purity
of the ballot that when we convene again
there will have been sufficient and positive
evidence gathered to enable us to file an in
dictment.

Waters Rise and Fall Several Feet With
out Doing Any Damage.
UKIAH, Cal., June 24.â A tidal wave
struck Mendocino City, on the coast of
this county, yesterday afternoon between
3 and 4 o'clock. The sea rose and fell some
seven feet beyond its level in mighty
waves, gradually becoming less. The
wave extended to a boom on the river one
mile from its mouth, where the water rose
tea inches. It is expected that the big
boom at the Mendocino sawmill would not
be able to resist the pressure upon it. No
material damage was done in consequence
of the tidal wave, although at tbe time it
occurred there was a ves3el under the
chute at Mendocino Point. A tidal wave
is a rare occurrence at that place.

Tte Railway Examiner a "Dyed-in
the-Wool but a Sound Money
Democrat."
Secretary Thompson of the Central
Pacific Railway Company had a distin
guished guest yesterday in Mr. Storm of
Washington, D. C. The visitor caused a
flurry in the executive department of the
railway company at Montgomery and
Market streets, for he had come all the
way from the National capital to make an
investigation into the condition and af
fairs of the Central Pacific Railway. He
is the special representative of the United
States Commissioner of Railroads, and is
now acting in hi> official capacity.
Mr. Storm will be here for several days,
during which time Mr. Thompson will
make his visit a very pleasurable experi
ence between spells of poring over figures
and statements in the railway office. The
Government official is s courteous and
genial gentleman. While talKing of rail
road matters yesterday he found time to
say a word about politics.
"I am a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat," he
remarked. "But yet lam a sound-money
Democrat. Don't ask me what the people
are saying in the East about money. That
is tbe great moral question that is agitat
ing the country. I believe that if silver
was introduced the purchasing power of a
man's income would be reduced by half.
So it would be a very bad thing for a man
with a set, steady income, Everything
would immediately go up in price, and
money would not be what it was."
Then Mr. Storm talked about railway
affairs, in which he was assisted by Secre
tary Thompson. He explained that he
was here to investigate the Central Pacific
Company so that the Governm nt would
get its due from the corporation as pro
vided for in acts of Congress.
According to the Thurman act the Gov
ernment gets 25 per cent of the net
earnings of the Central Pacific and pays
nothing for transportation over the road.
That is, the cost of carry ing mails, Govern
ment freight and passengers is credited
against the company's debt every year.
In 1894 the Central Pacific in this way paid
$699,000 to the Government. The fiscal
yenr ends December 31. and the annual
statement for 1895 is now finished and in
the printer's hands. It contains statistics
of the road's standing with regard to tbe
Government, regardine interest, net earn
ings. Government transportation, etc., and
Mr. Storm is examining those figures in
connection with vouchers and other docu
ments bearing on the accounts. In a week
or so it is thought he will have concluded
his task and then, armed with a report, go
back to Washington.
The issue of first-mortgage bonds of the
Central Pacific mature Juiy 1. They are
the second batch to mature, the first
having come due January 1 last, and they
amount to something over $3,000,000. These
were issued in 1566 as the Central Pacific
was in course of construction and now,
after thirty years, they face the unruffled
countenance of Collis P. Huntington.
It was learned yesterday that the fact
of a few mill on bonds maturing was a
mere trifle among railroad financiers.
"We have made arrangements," said
Mr. Thompson, "to extend tae bonds un
til 1898, when all the first mortgage bonds
mature. But this is being done at a re
duction in the interest from 6 to 5 per
cent."
With this reduction of 1 per cent on
$3,000,000 from January 1 and $3,000,000
from July 1, 1896, the Government will
come in for a materially increased slice of
the net earnings*
PACIFIC GROVE DEBATERS
Will Man Be Driven Out of
Business By the New
Woman ?
An Interesting Question Now Under
Discussion at the W. C. T. U.
Convention.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., June 24.â At
the meeting of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union to-day a very animated
debate took place on the question: "Re
solved, That Woman Suffrage Would
Drive Man From Business."
Mrs. N. B. Eyster, in the affirmative,
showed the increasing aggressiveness of
tbe new woman and depicted in strong
terms the deplorable consequences to men
if further facilities were granted women
to supplant them.
Miss Severance replied in vigorous
style, showing that the suffrage would do
more than anything else to make men
and women co-operative instead of com
petitive, arguing that the pecuniary de
pendence of women is the chief reason of
lower wages for them, which makes them
dangerous rivais of men in the labor mar
ket. Woman suffrage would tend to
equalize the wages of men and women,
giving equal wages for equal work, and
thereby prevent women from cutting
under the price of labor. In short,
nothing else could remove the present
difficulty, or restore so many women to
household duties who are now obliged to
take work in other fields.
Mrs. Grace Kimball spoke for the affirm
ative, and while she made some good
points there was enough of satire to make
her points tell on both sides. Mrs. Emily
Hoppin followed in the negative, picking
the arguments of her opponents to pieces
in good style, but Miss Severence closed
with a ringing speech that carried the
house quite away, conclusively proving
that the ballot in woman's hand would
not in tbe least threaten tbe interests of
men.
Mrs. Mary Frank Brown gave an able
address on social work, urging this depart
ment forward as a valuable educational
agency. Parlor meetings were shown to
be actively carried on in many parts of the
State. Ladies from several counties spoke
of their experiences in their respective
localities.
Dr. Mary Bell Mallory led a symposium
on the best methods to secure temperance
legislation, in which a number of ladies
took part with a degree of enthusiasm and
intelligence that proved their experience.
A grand concert was given in the even
ing.
STOCKTON BANKS.

Into Their Condition.
STOCKTON, Cal., June 24. â To-day

representatives of the Stockton Savings
Bank refused to be sworn, but finally con
sented.

General Sheehan Demands
an Explanation of
Bartnett.
JEALOUS OF HIS HONOR.
Soon His Ire Cooled and Then
the Trial Proceeded
Peacefully.
T. S. WILLIAMS ON THE STAND.
Claimed in a Report That General
Sheehan Was Wasting the
Bank's Money.
The pugilistic spirit which at present
pervades the atmosphere has not only
broken out in the Police Court, but threat
ens to iuvade the sanctity of the Superior
Court as well. For a while yesterday in
the People's Bank suit before Judge Sea
well it seemed probabie that General
Sheehan's warlike spirit would lead him
to cause bodily pain and mental anguish
to Attorney Bartnett. The general is very
touchy about his honor and when the at
torney intimated that Sheehan had in his
possession a certain letter, which Sheehan
di nied having, the officer stopped twirling
his mustachiosand demanded an explana
tion of the presumptuous attorney.
At the opening of the court the ques
tion of admitting Attorney Bartnett's
amended complaint was argued before the
court. Judge Seawell, alter listening to
the argument, denied the motion to admit
the amendment and the aitorne y duly ex
cepted. Attorney Jamss Alva Watt was
recalled to the stand.
He gave a lengtny account of the pay
ment of the Lower Kings River Reclama
tion District claim. He had given the
money to W. E. Johns, who represented
himself as the agent of the district, but not
until Johns produced a receipt signed by
Judge Denson. In regard to the acquisi
tion and transfer of the bank stock, Watt
denied that he or Sheehan or Stone had
bought uji any
Stock had been transferred to Hardee,
Watt's stenographer, at Watt's instance.
Watt had no definite understanding
with Hardee in the matter, but had merely
told him in a general way that "it would
be all right." Altiiough Watt voted this
:stoek by proxy he did not consider him
self the real owner.
When the directors of the bank had fixed
Watt's salary tnev were aware of the
amounts that had been paid to him previ
ously. The salary was not considered ex
orbitant; in fact," several of the directors
had expressed the opinion that it was too
low. Watt himself declared that he
thought his remuneration was quite mod
erate considering the vast amount of work
he had done.
Watt had found great difficulty in get
tine; men to serve as directors on the bank
wheu he attempted to reorganize it. Watt
bad -*nde*Fored to get certain depositors
tv act as directors, but could not get the
necessary number. He was, therefore,
compelled to get outsiders, who were not
directly in the bank, to act on the board.
Mr. Watt requested permission to state,
in order to clear himself of certain insinua
tions, ihe amount of work he had done
while attorney for the bank. He told in
detail the various mrtters which had oc
cupied his time almost exclusively. Watt
had represented the bank in nearly two
score different cases, aggregating nearly
11,200,000. Although Mr. Watt worked on
this business harder than he had ever
worked before he found it necessary to
employ extra office help and outside legal
a^i.stance. In addition to woric on actu
ally pending actions Watt was called upon
for legal advice almost constantly by
Sheehan. Furthermore, he had to be up
at the bank on Market street a great deal â
in fact he believed he had spent two
thirds of his time there for a considerable
period.
At the opening of the afternoon Judge
S. C. Denson, the agent of the Lower King
River Reclamation District, was called. An
assessment had been made on land which
the People's Bank had a mortgage upon.
Denson urged the assessment as a prior
claim. He, however, came to an agree
ment with Dorn 6i Dorn, attorneys for the
bank, that both claims be paid pro rata.
The assessment was not made, and it began
to look as though it would not be paid.
Then W. E. Johns came to Denson and
offered to pay $1800 on the original assess
ment of $2532 14. Denson accepted this
offer and gave a receipt for the amount.
Denson supposed that Johns was a repre
sentative of the bank, and accordingly
pave him the receipt.
Ex-Mayor Ellert was put on the stand.
He said that Johns had come to him
claiming to be the representative of the
reclamation district. Watt did not ques
tion Johns' authority in the matter, as he
paid him the full amount, $2532 14, and re
ceived Judge Denson' s voucher.
E. J. Livernash was asked a few ques
tions acd at the conclusion of his testi
mony an exciting little passage-at-arms
occurred between Attorney Bartnett and
General Sheehan. Bartnett declared that
Sbeehan had in his possession a certain
letter. Pheehan declared that he had been
hunting diligently for the letter and had
been unable to find it. Upon Bartnett's
reiteration of his previous declaration
Sheeban, who' was standing close to the
attorney, demanded if Bartnett meant to
call him a liar.
Order was restored by the clerk and
Sheehan's choler having vented itself he
subsided.
T. S. Williams, who acted as director of
the People's Home Savincs Bank during
the most of 1895, gave testimony which
counteracted somewhat General Sheehan's
valuations upon the various pieces of prop
erty of the Dank. Williams had taken a
trip throueh Southern California in De
cember, 1895. examining the bank proper
ties. He found that Sheehan had ex
pended money ostensibly for the purpose
of renting the property, but upon exam
ination of the property Williams found
there was absolutely no call for expense of
any kind.
A report was made by Williams to the
board of directors in March, 1895, upon his
return from his trip in the south. Shee
han's estimate of the value of the Southern
California property was $498,000. Williams
?siimated it at $272,000. In this report
Williams says: "I do not think that the
management has been judicious and eco

should be our watchword if we wish to
save anything from this wreck for ihe
creditors.' 1

GAVE HER A BLACK EYE.
Policeman Monaghan Arrested for Bat
tery Upon His Wife.
Hugh Monaghan, sergeant of police, was
arrested yesterday morning on a warrant
charging him with battery and was re
leased on his own recognizance by Judge
Campbell.
The complaining witness is Mrs. Eliza
Monaghan, his wife. She applied for the
warrant yesterday morning and showed
Warrant Clerk Jackson a discolored right
eye in proof of the charge. The sergeant
lives at 1412 Vallejo street and is on his
vacation. On Monday when he went
home he called her vile names and beat
her. She ran out of the house to escape
further chastisement and when she went
back she found he had locked the doors so
that she could not get in and she has since
been living with friends at 1517 Post street.
She said he had been in the habit of re
turning home under the influence of
liquor and beating and abusing her and
sometimes expectorating in her face.
Mrs. Monaghan was a widow and Mona
ghan a widower when they were married,
about eighteen months ago. The marriage
was an unhappy one and some montns
ago Mrs. Monaghan applied for a divorce.
Judge Hunt heard the evidence and re
fused to grant the divorce. Since then
the bitter feeling existing between them
has been intensified and they have been
leading a cat and dog life.

The Great Dry Goods Sale Continues
With Increasing Crowds.
The creditors' sale of the $85,000 stock of
the unfortunate merchants, James M. Moran &.
Co., 1009-1015 Market street, seems to have
stirred the dry goods buyers of San Francisco
in an extraordinary manner, as the rush of
purchasers increases every day, and the mag
nificent stock is slaughtered in a most un
merciful manner. It is a pity to see such a
beautiful stock of dry goods disposed of in
such a ruthless and merciless fashion. The
fortunate buyers, however, are not to blame
for grasping and taking advantage of such a
rare opportunity. â¢
Failure to Provide.
William Aston, a fireman, pleaded guilty in
Judge Campbell's court yesterday to a charge
of failing to provide for his wife and two little
girls. Mrs. Aston told the Judge that Mrs.
George O'Brien, a divorced woman, had en
ticed him away from his home and that his
mother had urged him to leave her. The Judge
ordered Aston into custody and to-day he will
appear for sentence.
Blew Out the Gas.
Osahilde Hori, a Japanese servant working
at 2700 Howard street, was found dead in his
bed yesterday morning. Death was due to
gas. Hori had recently come to the City and
it is supposed was not familiar with the work
ings of a gas jet. It is believed that he blew
out the gas and then retired, unconscious that
he had invited death into his room

loved Commander.
The funeral of the late Major-General
William H. Dimond took place yesterday
afternoon from the First Presbyterian
Church, the remains being escorted and
laid at rest with the pomp due his rank in
Laurel Hill Cemetery.
As early as noon Van Ness avenue from
California to Clay streets was crowded
with people, and it was almost a physical
impossibility for any more people to gain
admission to the church after the body
arrived.
The chancel was hidden from view by
I floral tributes. The general's staff sent a
! pillar of sweet peas over two feet in hight.
I The Third Brigade, N. G. C, sent an im-

mense shield of vari-colored pinks. George
H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., sent a broken
wheel of lilies and roses. The private
offerings required three wagons to convey
them to the grave.
The weighty metallic casket, draped
with the American flag, was carried into
church by six stalwart sergeants of the
Thini Brigade. Preceding it were Rev.
Dr. McKenzie and Rev. E. H. Jenks, as
sistant pastor of the church.
The honorary pallbearers, representing
military, social, civic and other organiza
tions in which deceased was most promi
nent, were as follows: Major-General Wal
ter Turnbull, retired officers of N. G. C. ;
Brigadier-General M. W. Muller, com
manding division; Colonel F. S. Chad
bourne, Governor's staff; Colonel A. E.
CastJe, division staff; Lieutenant-Colonel
B. H. Peppy, division staff; Major Han

The immediate mourners, Mrs. Jarboe
and Mrs. J. Tobin, both daughter* of the
deceased, his two sons, Harry and Edward,
and his son-in-law, Joseph Tobin, followed
the casket.
After prayers by Rev. Dr. McKenzie,
who officiated, and the regular services
that reverend gentleman said:
"Words of eulogy could be fittingly
spoken on an occasion like this, but a re
quest is made that they be not prolonged,
but rather that they be short and few.
While we all know that on an occasion
like this there is a certain right of the pub
lic community to invade the privacy of
the domestic Dome, I will accede to the
request in so much as a brief eulogy is
concerned.
"It is not always words that express the
most. There is more than words can ex
press as a eulogy over the remains of our
departed friend in the presence here to
day of the business men and leaders in
every honorable path of life. This body
of citizens, leaving their places of business
at midday to Day their respects to the de
ceased, by their silence and sorrow eulo
gize the dead more than they could in
words."
At the conclusion of the church ser
vices the funeral cortege left the church
and was preceded down Van Ness avenue
to the cemetery by the Third Brigade
Band playing Chopin's Marche Funebre.
The entire brigade followed. Then came
Colonel Burns at the head of the Veteran
Guards, G. A. &. A corps of muffled
drums slowly rolled their sorrowful music
at the head of the Naval Battalion. Cap
tain Douglass headed the Veteran Fire
men.
The casket, draped with the American
flag, rested on the truck of a gun-carriage
hauled by six black horses.
General Dimond's unmounted steed,
draped in black, followed the remains of
his late master. Further back came pri
vate carriages reaching far in the rear."
At the end of Bush street General War
field ordered the military to form in line.
Captain J. Cunningham's Company X,
the special escort, fired three volleys as the.
casket was lowered into the grave.
During the obsequies the soldiers at
Fort Point fired a salute of thirteen guns
at intervals of ten seconds.
A BEAM GAVE WAY.
Frank Haskell, an Employe of the Fire
Alarm Police Telegraph Com
pany, Seriously Injured.
Frank Haskell, an employe of the Fire
Alarm Police Telegraph Company, living
at 9i& Stockton street, is in the Receiving
Hospital in an unconscious condition from
a fractured skull.
He and his wife attended the festivities
after the wedding of a son of Fire Com
missioner Edwards Tuesday night. At
an early hour yesterday morning, when
the company dispersed, Mrs. Haskell went
home with some friends and Haskell
started for his own home.
When he reached home he found that
he had not a Key with him, so he passed
through the saloon at 7 Stockton street
and climbed over the fence to his own
yard, tie was Climbing to the balcony
of his house when one of the beams gave
way and he was precipitated to the ground.
The people in the saloon heard the crash
and found Haskell unconscious.
Haskell was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, and an examination showed that his
skull was fractured and his left femur
broken. The operation of trephining the
skull was performed by Drs. Weil, Bun
nell and Kearny. Haskell is in a critical
condition.

Robert Burns, 19 years of age, living at 1168
Fifteenth avenue, South San Francisco, met
with a serious accident yesterday morning.
He drives a wagon for John Quad & Co., Mar
ket street, and while on Harrison street, near

with a truck and Burns was thrown off, strik

conscious condition and taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where it was found that his
skull was fractured.
SUICIDE OF AN ENGINEER,
John Hooper of the Steamer Ex
celsior Jumped Overboard
at Sea.
He Was the Nephew of C. A. Hooper,
the Well -Known Lumber
Merchant.
Anotber lovelorn man has taken his
own life. He could not gain the lady of
his choice so he buried ii is sorrows in the
bosom of the ocean. He went about tbe
matter deliberately, and wrote a note of
farewell to all his shipmates. Then when
it came to his watch off he quietly walked
to the side of the ship and slipped over
board.
When the steam schooner Excelsior ar
rived from Unga yesterday she was minus
one of her crew. John Hooper, nephew of
C. A. and G. W. Hooper, the lumber mer
chants, had committed suicide. He was
young and well liked, and everybody on
the vessel bad tried to make things
pleasan t for him. Last year he finished
his "time" at the Risdon Iron WorKs, and
as he desired to become a marine engineer
he had to serve a certain length of time as an
oiler on a steamer before he could get his
certificate from the Inspectors of Hulls
und Boiiers. His uncles accordingly
put him aboard their steamer Excelsior
and on her the young man made several
trips. During the one just ended he was
moody and silent, confiding in no one.
Seeing that something was wrong with
him everybody on board tried to cheer
him up. AH their efforts were without
avail. It leaked out that he was in love
and that the relatives on both sides strictly
prohibited the marriage. This added to
the sympathy felt for the young man and
in consequence there was a general gloom
cast over the ship by his sudden dis
appearance.
The night of May 28 last young Hooper
was to have gone on watch at midnight.
He did not appear, and a search was
made. Every hole and corner in the
steamer was searched, and at last in his
bunk was found a letter addressed to Cap
tain Donaldson. In it he said he was go
ing to drown himself, and mentioning
the names of every one of the crew, he
thanked them all for the kindnesses they
had shown him. Captain Donaldson re
fused to discuss the suicide, and no in
formation could be gained at the office of
Hooper & Co. The young man was well
liked by all who knew him, and every
body will be shocked lo hear of his rash
deed.
The Excelsior came down in ballast and
brought as passengers Superintendent
Mayon of the Unga mine and his wife, A.
McKinney, ihe school-teacher at Unga,
and a miner. They all say that the mines
are doing well, and that everything is pro
gressing on the island.

SCOTT AND HENDERSON FIEM.
More Changes in the Names of
Schools â Transaction of Routine
Business.
At last night's session of the Board of
Education Dr. J. H. Soper was placed in
nomination by Superintendent Babcock to
fill the vacancy for the unexpired term
caused by the recent resignation of Henry
L. Dodge. A brief but brisk breeze en
sued.
"It is rumored," said Director Comte,
"that the gentleman belongs to the A. P.
A. and before voting I should lineâ "
"It doesn't make any difference," inter
rupted President Scott, "to what society a
man belongs, whether he is a MaÃon or an
Odd Fellow. When he comes before this
body he stands solely upon his record as a
citizen."
"Dr. Soper," said Director Clinton, "has
assured me that he does not belong to the
A. P. A. â that treasonable society."
"I object," said Director Henderson, "to
these reflections upon the character of Dr.
Soper. The A. P. A. is not a treasonable
society and I call the gentleman to order.
His remarks are objectionable."
"Please suppress that jackanapes for a
moment, Mr. Chairman," retorted Director
Clinton. "The idea of bis presumption
in calling me to order, when he cannot
speak two consecutive grammatical sen
tences.
"I am advised that the Superintendent
has in his pocket an affiidavit from Dr.
Soper, denying that he is a member of the
A. P. A., and if so, I ask that it be read
before a vote is taken."
Preeident Scott ruled the readme of any
such affidavit to be out of order. The
roll was then called and Dr. Soper was
elected. Directors Ambrose, Barrett and
Carew voted in the negative, and
Directors Clinton and Comte explained
their affirmative votes by saying they did
not believe the gentleman was an A. P. A.
Director Henderson, in voting aye, took
occasion to declare that he was "a full
blooded American."
The excitement then suddenly died out,
and the routine business was quickly and
auietly transacted. Mary Fitzgerald was
elected a teacher in the department ana
assigned to the day substitute class when
a vacancy occurs. Miss Eva McKee, a
probationer, was also made a regular
teacher. Leaves of absence were granted
to Miss M. E. Fairchild and H. E. Whir
low. Several teachers were transferred
conformably to the recommendation of
the Classification Committee, and Web
ster's dictionaries were adopted for ex
clusive uue in the schools of the depart
ment.
Changes were made in the names of sev
eral schools as follows: Pacific-avenue to
Grant Primary, North Cosmopolitan to
Hancock Grammar, South Cosmopolitan
to Adams Grammar, Potrero Primary to
Irving Scott School, South San Francisco
to Burnett School, and Dudley C. Stone to
Dudley Stone School.
A resolution providing for the organiza
tion of the Teachers' Council was adopted.
Contracts wsre awarded for the furnish
ing of school supplies for the ensuing year.
The coal will be supplied by John Middle
ton and Thomas Morton; the school furni
ture by C. F. Weber & Co., the George H.
Fuller Desk Company and the Whittaker &
Ray Company, the books by Hough ton,
Miffiin & Co.; the stationery by Cunning
ham, Curtiss & Welch, the H. S. Crocker
Company, Payot, Upham <fe Co., and
the Pacific School-furnishing Company,
the maps by Miss Mane O'Brien. The
names of Le Count Bros., Banborn, Vail &
Co., Baker & Hamilton, J. Caire, W. W.
Montague & Co., and Holbrook, Merrill &
Stetson were also comprised in the list of
successful bidders for articles in their re
spective lines.

GARRETT A. HOBART, of New Jersey
KLKCTIOX NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
Whitney writes well, but Altgeld gets
there.
Every factory bell rings for McKinley
and prosperity.
Altgeld pardoned the anarchists, but he
draws the line at Grover.
By this time Senator Teller begins to
feel that he was too previous.
It will avail Whitney nothing to go to
Chicago, unless he takes his barrel with
him.
Democracy wili not fuse with Populism.
It has reached a time when it wants to be
alone.
The soldier candidate who went to the
front in 18(il will be at the front in Novem
ber, 1896.
The deficit tariff will go right along
making figures for Republican campaign
documents.
It Is now believed the Chicago conven
tion wili fuss around for about two weeks
and then split.
The tariff plank at Chicago will be a
straddle so wide that it will look like a
suspension bridge.
Sound money is the money that sets the
wheels of industry moving and fills the
country with prosperity.
The Democratic party has mortgaged
this country to the bond-dealers, but the
Republican party will redeem it.
The report that Cleveland may vote for
McKinley is the worst attempt yet made
to slander the Republican candidate.
The party of Thurman and Hendricks
has become the party of Altgeld and Till
man. What kind of evolution is that?
Free trade, frea silver, free buncombe
and free bosh make a combination that
won't wash when the tidal wave comes.
If you wish San Francisco to be a home
market for home goods join a Republican
club and work for McKinley and protec
tion.
"White silver savages" is what the Bos
ton Herald calls them, but the term seems
to imply that the Herald is a trifle savage
itself.
There are a great many men who do not
understand the money question, but every
body understands the need of work and
wages.
As Boies has long been the artful dodger
of lowa politics, he may be fairly consid
ered the logical candidate of Democracy
this year.
The gold reserve is rapidly sinking and
Cleveland will have the satisfaction of
pleasing his Wall-street friends with a
new loan before long.
There is no enthusiasm displayed in
Democratic conventions until somebody
denounces Cleveland and the crowd
makes the welkin ring.
Cleveland brought forward the mouey
issue to hide the tariff deficit, and he may
now try to bring up the Cuban question to
head off the money issue.
Some Democrats are trying to uphold
the gold standard and some the silver
standard, but as for the Cleveland stan
dard there is none to do it reverence.
As a gold-producing State California has
little to gain by the free coinage of silver,
but the welfare of all her industries de
pends upon protection, and therefere her
people must vote for protection first and
free silver afterward.
Ask the average Democrat whether he
favors Bland, Boies, Blackburn, Camp
bell, Carlisle, Cleveland, Gorman, Hill,
Matthews, Morrison, Pattigon, Russell,
Teller or Whitney, and he will give you a
vacant smile and answer, "There are
others."
it was noted at Washington that tne
telegraph at the White House was shut off
during the St. Louis convention and the
President received no private dispatches.
It is easy to draw from this the conclusion
that Cleveland has reached the condition
of Abner Dean of Angela when "he cur.cd
up on the floor and the subsequent pro
ceedings interested him no more."
In his recent speech to his fellow citi
zens at Canton McKinley expressed the
convictions of the people of the whole
country in saying: "We have come to
appreciate that protective tariffs are better
than idleness and that wise tariff legisla
tion is more business-like than debts and
deficiencies." That is the substance of
the whole matter. The people want
McKinley, protection and prosperity.
INVOLUTION OF BRAINS.
The degeneracy of the Democratic party
is to be lamented. It is a reflection upon
our system of government and an excuse
for the enemies of republican institutions
to say, as they do, that a system which
inclines one to lower levels of political in
tegrity and patriotism exerts a pernicious
influence everywhere. In a measure that
is doubtless true of the conduct of many of
the leaders of tne Democratic party , but the
rank and lile are true to the ethical princi
ples of the Government, only that too many
ol them have permitted party pride to keep
alive a degree of enthusiasm for the tradi
tions of the party tbat ia not justified by
the history of its going and coming in the
last forty years. The party of Douglass,
lienton and .Seymour has fallen into the
hands of political brigands.
Yesterday's gathering of the Democratic
party of Illinois in State Convention fairly
represented the personnel of the leaders
of the party oi to-day. The giant who
towered above them all as a true repre
sentative of modern Democracy was Gov
ernor Altgeid. For years he has been
charged with being in full sympathy with
the doctrines of Herr Most. How far the
charge is true may be judged by the fact
that immediately after he was inaugurated
he j.ardoned the Haymarket anarchists
who had been convicted of murder. In
announcing their pardon, Governor
Altgeld took advantage of the occasion to
charge the court that tried them with be
ing a foul nest of persecutors of good peo
ple, such as the Haymarket dynamite
bomb-throwers. lie was renominated for
Governor yesterday by acclamation, after
delivering himself of a coarse and brutal
speech, in which he roundly abused every
respectable Democrat in the land. Alt
geld would be the choice of the silver wing
of his party for President were it not that
Providence so shaped events that he should
not be born in the United States.
Next to Altgeld comes a long list of lead
ers of modern Democracy. Boies was a
rabid Republican until some ten years ago,
when, growing tired of waiting for his
party to recognize his transcendent states
manship, he joined the Democratic party
and was elected Governor on a Democratic
anti-Prohibition platform. He was called
the "whisky Governor," though he never
himself touches whisky or tobacco and
never swears. What a Democrat! Bland,
who was patted on the back by Altgeld's
convention, thinks that the "crime of
1873" furnishes the sum total of the science
of government in the direction of rascal
ity, and he dwelt upon that one idea so
long that his district, after keeping him
in Congress for twenty years, turned him
down by sending an obscure country phy
cician to Washington in his stead. Bland
is honest enough, but he has not found
out yet that the sun does not revolve
around the earth.
The best that can be said of Goverror
Tillman is that he rattles around in the
seatthat John C. Cal noun used to fill. His
greac delight is in attacking the Republi
can party, but the performance so resem
bles the effort of a dyspeptic child trying
to batter down Gibraltar with a popgun
that he only amuses. Ex-Congressman
Ciark of Missouri, who was recognized as
one of the trreat leaders of the Democratic
party at Altgeld's convention, was de
feated of re-election by a Republican itin
erant singing-school teacher. And so it
is. Calhoun's mantle upon Tillman's
shoulders; Benton's breeches hiding
Bland's nakedness ; Douglas' big hat on
Altgeld's little head, and Seymour's spurs
jingling on Boies' heels. The spectacle is
rather worse than the noble dust of Alex
ander stopping a bunghole.
DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF.
Undoubtedly there is discord in the
ranks of the Democratic party. There is
evidence that the bosses are at outs with
one another. The party is divided into
two wings, and it is very evident that the
silver or anti-administration wing is not
bowing down before "Moses," as they
called Cleveland awhile ago. In Altgeld's
convention the chairman devoutly and
sincerely hoped tbat God would forgive
the Democrats of Illinois for their share in
foisting Grover Cleveland upon the coun
try in 1892. Any reference to the Presi
dent was hissed unless his name was
connected with something vile or dread
ful, when the speaker was applauded,
and "Say it over again!" and "Hit him
again!" was heard ringing throughout the
convention hall. Such demonstration of
hostility to a public man is not often wit
nessed. Had the convention stopped at
that a good point would have been made,
but the Altgeldites paraded their own true
Democracy just enough to be disgusting.
"We are the saints" is a little too brazen
for either wing of that party to sine.
In the Ohio Democratic Convention,
yesterday, Reuben Turney, an old wheel
horse of the party, spied Cleveland's pic
ture among the decorations as he mounted
the stand for a speech, and pointing his
finger at it he shrieked like a madman,
"That arch-traitor, that Benedict Arnold
of Democracy, Grover Cleveland." He
demanded that the picture be removed.
And so it goes from bad to worse with the
old party of treasons, stratagems and
spoils. The leaders have fallen out, and
they are telling the truth concerning the
true inwardness of one another's methods,
aims and purposes; but they only confirm
what the public has long suspected. But
good will come of it all. The party is di
vided on lines of personal hatred, and the
country need not fear danger from it for
many years, if ever again.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
A pamphlet of few words, but of much
force and meaning, has been issued by
Frederick K. Samuels of this City in ad
vocacy of a bill "to provide for an aux
iliary navy, ocean mail service and to
promote commerce. 'â¢ The object of the
bill is to advance our merchant marine
lo the position it ought of right to occupy,
and to enable it to maintain itself against
the competition of the subsidized mer
chant marine of other nations.
The chief objections to the existing law
is that it invests the Postmaster-General
with almost autocratic power over the aid
given to shipping-, with the result that pri
vate enterprise is entirely subordinated to
his opinions, and that the provisions for
the classification, speed and remuneration
ot steamships are inadequate to encourage
shipbuilding or meet The varied require
ments of different trades.
The essential features of the proposed
legislation are that some consideration
must be given to our merchant marine in
return for Government support, that rea
sonable security shall be given by the Gov
ernment for the capital invested and labor
employed against changes in administra
tive policies; that freedom should be given
in the selection of trades in which vessels
may engage without vitiating their right
to compensation; that no discrimination
shall be made in favor of any individual
or corporation, and that liberal provisions
of governmental support shall be made in
order to induce capitalists to engage in
the enterprise of shipbuilding, and thus
produce immediate beneficial results to
jour shipping interests.
That something should be done to pro
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1896.
mote our merchant marine service is be
yond question. All the greater nations of
the world grant subsidies to their steam
ship lines and as a result hava built them
up at the cost of our commerce. It i 3 by
reason of her liberal grants to snips that
England lias made herself virtually the
mistress of the commerce of the world and
added so much to her wealth and power.
While the British have been extending
their mercantile marine in that way, we
have been doing practically nothing and
as a consequence American goods are car
ried in English vessels to foreign markets
and our rightful trade has been lost to us.
Fan Francisco has much at stake in this
issue. This City should be the center of
Pacific Ocean commerce, and American
ships should carry and bring from and to
this port the goods that are interchanged
between the Orient and the West. At the
present time, however, cotton from the
fields of Texas is carried to Japan by way
of Liverpool, when a route through San
Francisco would save a journey of thou
sands of miles. So, also, we lose the great
trade of South America by reason of the
lack of American ships to carry American
goods to those markets on terms that can
compete with British goods.
Mr. Samuels has made his argument so
brief it can be read by even the busiest
men and so clear it can b* understood by
even the least comprehending. He makes
it plain tbat the object to be attained is
one of patriotism as well as business, in
asmuch as a merchant marine of fleet
steamships would be of great use to as in
time of war, and on this double plea
rightly and justly urees the importance of
immediate action on the part of the Gov
ernment in patting our shipping on equal
terms with that of any other nation on
the globe.
COUNTRY VS. CITY.
The Registrar-General of London, Eng
land, has submitted the census of the
great city and bis figures show an increase
in population of 200,528 since June, 1891,
making the population 4,411,271. One liv
ing right in London could hardly con
ceive how so many people could live in
one municipality. It is not so difficult,
however, to understand why all the cities
of civilization have increased in popula
tion so fast in recent years. The time was
when suburban life was considered the
more desirable, both for health and pleas
ure, but the Improvement in the construc
tion of houses, means of rapid transit and
sanitary engineering have added so
many conveniences that city life has
become very desirable, especially since
church, amusement and library facilities
have kept pace with the advance in hy
gienic and other health-giving agencies. It
may be said, in fact, that the city is very
much healthier than the town or villaee.
The growth of American cities and
towns is, however, attributable for the
most part to causes that are not at all con
ducive to moral health at least. This
comes from an idiotic idea that farm
life is somehow under a social cloud ;
that horny hands and brown skin are
barred out of fashionable society, and that
to "hold the plow or drive" is not nearly
so lofty an occupation as a clerkship in a
city. Farmer-boys do not like to admit
this, but it is nevertheless true, and the
census of the first occupation of a large
percentage of "city" men would prove it.
The young man makes a great mistake in
quitting the farm as statistics show. It is
very rare that a farmer fails to come out
more thau even at the end of the year,
and he never has to worry himself half to
death over bills payable, but less than live
out of every one hundred commercial or
any other Kind of business venture in the
city becomes a firmly established concern
whose rating is Al.
Some years ago an Arkansas land-owner
advertised for tenants to cultivate his
farms. He announced the terms, wnicn
were that be would furnish as much rich
cleared land as tne tenant might want, a
comfortable enough house, a team of
mules, farm implements, necessary seed
and furnish table supplies for the first year
on credit. At the end of the crop year the
tenant should first pay for his supplies.
After that he should take out enough of
the crop to provide seed for the next year.
Then he should give the land-owner one
half of what was left of the crop, his own
share being the same less the cost of his
table supplies, which the land-owner was
security for. The land-owner had enough
land to supply about sixty families. He
got enough, but out of the hundreds of
letters of inquiry there were less than a
dozen from cities, and only three accepted
his proposition. That is one of the rea
sons why there are so many impecunious
men in the cities. "I had rather go
hungry in the city than live well on a
farm," one man wrote.
REDUCED FREIGHT RATES.
The new schedule of traffic tariffs, which
is effective on and after to-day on the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Kail
way, applies to all points on the line.
The reduction i 3 greater than is indicated
on the rate sheet, as compared with the
charges of the Southern Pacific. The Val
ley road absorbs all switching charges in
its rate, so that the rate quoted in the
sheet includes all charges for transporta
tion between initial and destination points.
Tne saving thus afforded shippers on the
line of the road will be considerable, be
sides there will not be the annoyance that
has often arisen heretofore because of
separate charges.
Undoubtedly the opening of tlie Valley
road will work a great relief to the San
Joaquin Valley, both in additional facili
ties for reaching outside markets and as a
permanent rival of the Southern Pacific,
thus insuring rates that are not only fair
and reasonable, but which do not discrimi
nate for or against any individual or lo
cality. The mileage of the Valley road is
a little less than ninety miles, but con
struction is being pushed southward. The
fact, however, that it will always form a
strong competitor of the Southern Pa
cific, and a regulator of rates on the basis
of sharp competition, is of great im
portance. ______________
IS SPAIN PLAYING "BLUFF?"
Spain is preparing to send 100,000 sol
diers to Cuba. They are to be shipped be
tween the first of September and the mid
dle of December, and Weyler promises to
make short work of the rebellion when
they arrive. It is doubtful, however, if
anything of the kind is seriously contem
plated by the Madrid Government. A lit
tle while ago the captain-general said he
had troops enough, and that as soon as
the wet season was over he should move
against the insurgents and crush them
at one blow, and nothing has transpired
since to suggest the need of more soldiers.
According to his account of the daily bat
tles the insurgents are being killed off so
fast that there will not be one left by the
time the new levy of 100,000 reaches the
island. Then why does he give it out that
he will be re-enforced by 100,000 of the
flower of Spain's army in the fall ?
If it be true another army of 100,000 is to
be thrown into Cuba in the near future it
can be relied upon that it is simply a move
in the direction of preparing for a war
with the United States. A large standing
army in Cuba would come handy in the
event of a rupture with this country, but
it would only prolong the inevitable. The
presumption is, though, that Weyler is
simply playing a "bluff" game. Doubt
less he thinks this country would go a
little slow in the direction of recognizing
Cuban belligerency if it knew that 100,000
fresh Spanish soldiers were about to form
a base of offensive and defensive opera
tions, but if it is a "bluff" game he is
playing he is wasting a great deal of gray
matter.
There are two things General Weyler
should inform himself of. The sympathy
that is going out to the insurgents is not
prompted so much by a desire to see the
rebels succeed as by the brutal methods
that Weyler employs. His conduct of the
war is so infamously cruel and his encour
agement of the most diabolical attacks
upon non-combattants has so embit
tered our people against him per
sonally and as tne representative
of the Spanish Government that they
would espouse the cause of Cuba,
right or wrong. The other thing of which
General Weyler should inform himself
is that any attempt at "bluff" with the
people of this country would make any
settlement of the differences now existing
between the United States and Spain im
possible, except that his country should
submit and obey any demands that this
country might see lit to impose.
Weyier is altogether too fond of leaning
defenseless men up against a dead wall and
shooting them to death to commend him
self or his cause to any feeling of the people
of this country, except tne feeling which
creates an intense desire to go to Cuba and
wind up the earthly career of every one of
Spain's hirelings, from the captain-general
down. The Spanish official who said the
other day that after the inauguration of
William McKinley Spain would have to do
right by Cuba or light is a pretty wise man.

WOMAN'S WAYS.
Dear summer maid, I'm half afraid,
Despite my store of reason,
Again you'll take my heart to break,
Just as yon did last season.
For be you fair or dark of hair,
I find myself enraptured:
Your sidelong glance cats like a lance,
And I straightway am captured.
At other times, wed to my rhymes,
I well may laugh at Cupid;
Content that girls should shake their curls
And pass me by as stupid.
But when the haze of warmer days
Announces summer burning,
I'm out of torts and feel my thought*
Loveward go lightly turning.
And while I know you'll bring me woe,
With heart light as a feather,
At your dear call I give up all,
So we may be' together.
How time will fly! You say sood-by
With some word lightly spoken;
For well you may be blithe and gay-
It's not your heart that's broken.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
WHEAT AND SILVER.
WHY WHEAT-GROWERS WOTJLD LOSE BY THE FREE
COINAGE OF SILVER.
To the Editor of the San Framitco Callâ Sir:
The other day in one of the Examiner's edi
torials it was intimated that the free and un
limited coinage of silver would raise the price
of wheat. This is the fallacy which has given
Populism its greatest hold. That wheat can
not be raised in price by the free, unlimited
and independent coinage of silver may easily
be shown. We all know, or should know, that
as we produce a surplus of wheat for export,
the price of wheat in the United States is the
foreign, or Liverpool pric3, less the freight,
insurance and necessary commissions of the
commission merchants â only this and nothing
more. But this foreign price is based upon
gold monometallism, the only money of inter
national trade. The wheat-grower, therefore,
is, and will be, subject to the falsely supposed
price-destroying single gold standard. No
matter what character of currency we have in
the t'nited States, the farmer will be paid in
the United States for wheat only on the basis
of gold monometallism.
If, therefore, we adopt the free and unlim
ited coinage ot silver and obtain the as
sumed benefit of bimetallic prices, these prices
will be only for goods of our own production â
not the subject of export. Our wheat farmer
will then pay bimetallic prices for what he
buys and be compelled to take gold mono
metallic prices for all he sells. He will further
have his return diminished, because he will
bo paid only in the currency of his countryâ
the cheaper metal, silver. But as the ship
ment of wheat will take sometime to reach
Liverpool ana as silver bullion is subject to
changes in value, susceptible of being
measured daily, the foreign purchaser to in
sure himself against the possibility of a fall in
the value of the fluctuating silver during the
transit of the wheat will, to save himself, be
Compelled to take something off of what he
would give if the payments were on the non
fluctuating basis of gold monometallism.
Surely no observant person will dare assert
that gold changes in value in the short period
of the transit of wheat from San Francisco to
Liverpool.
For two reasons, therefore, the farmer will
receive less for his wheat. For a like reason
European merchants must charge a little
more on what they sell ub to insure themselves
against the rising of silver by the time of our
payment for the imported goods. We shall,
therefore, pay more than we now do, while on
a gold basis, for what we buy from the rest of
the world, and get less than we now do for
what we sell. This is the permanent evil of
silver monometallism. When we conslder'that
in the quickened state of modern commerce a
difference of one-half of one per cent will
drive one metal out of the currency and into
the metal market, he must be a bold and
wanton man who will assert that tne two
metals will remain in concurrent circulation,
ana that we shall not have silver monometal
lism. From the foregoing reflections it may be
readily perceived why the wheat grower can
but lose by voting for the free coinage of silver.
Very resepctfully, John Heenan.
LADY'S DRESSING SACQUE.
A delightfully comfortable and stylish gar
ment is illustrated above. It is cut with a
loose front which is shirred from a yoke top.
The back is cut with a back form and an under
arm gore. The sleeves are the comfortable and
picturesque bishop sleeve. The sailor collar is
stylishly cut off in front to give the effect now
sought after.
A most dainty sacque after this model was
of white batiste. The sailor collar had a deep
hem, at the top of which was let in the nar-
row embroidery to give the effect of hemstitch
ing. The ruffle around the collar, which was
also of batiste, had the same finish at the top
of the hem.
Another sacque was of blue and white dim
ity, with a collar of plaiu blue edged with a
ruffle of Valenciennes lace.
A yellow dimity might be trimmed with a
collar of yellow and white striped dimity.
A pink lawn, with white dots, might have
a white collar trimmed with white or yellow
lace.
A blue Japanese siik with collar of white
batiste trimmed with inserting of yellow Va
lenciennes lace, with a ruffle to match, would
be very cool and stylish.
Pale green wash silk with a canary stripe
might have the collar of natural colored grass
linen.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Grand opera has received a severe blow in
the death of Sir Augustus Harris, in the very
height of the London musical season. He
was one of the few impresarios who could
make grand opera pay, and that was owing to
bis wide experience and dauntless energy. A
dozen years ago opera was becoming a lost art,
as far as London was concerned. "Augustus
Druryolanus," as he was popularly called,
after his theater of Brury Lane, declared that
he would revive the opera enthusiasm which
had been ruined by the star system. He se
cured a fine company, but his troupe did not
include Patti, and the public had been edu
cated to consider that Patti was grand opera,
and grand opera was Patti. The immediate
result of his venture was that in six weeks he
lost Â£10,000. At first Augustus Harris con
cluded that he had buried grand opera, and
that the ceremony was rather costly, but the
next season he was persuaded to make another
venture, and that time London began to see
SIR AUGUSTUS HARRIS.
that opera was possible without Patti. For
several years there was little profit in the
opera seasons, but the impresario was edu
cating the public, and in these later years he
very much more than made back what he had
previously lost.
Considering that his earliest memories were
associated with the operatic stage, it was not
surprising that Augustus Harris should have
turned his attention to the production of
opera in London. In a recent interview he
said: "My first remembrance of opera dates
back to the time when, as a boy of six, I saw
'Martha* given at Covent Gardenâ the new
theater had just been built after the fire.
After that I was frequently behind the scenes
there, and when I went to Paris I used to meet
all the great artists and composers, either at
Faure's, Patti's or Carvalho's, where I passed
my Sundays. At Hanover, too, where I lived
for a time, for the purpose of completing my
education, I had the entree to the opera
house; so you may ima-gine that from my
earliest years I have taken a deep interest in
matters operatic."
Sir Augustus Harris was knighted for his
civic services, not for what he had done for
music. The Elms, his home near London, is n
beautiful place, containing many priceless
treasures pertaining to the operatic world.
Apropos of Saint-Saens' jubilee concert in
Paris, L'lllustration gives the following ac
count of the French master's early passion for
music: "His infancy offers many similarities
with the first years of Mozart. At 22 months
of age he was brought home to Paris from the
country, and all the impression he received
from the city seemed to be those of sound
and music. The ticking of the clocks, the
noise of the door-bells, the various peddler's
cries, rendered him mute with astonishment,
and he spent his time in running from one
room to another, to compare the different
sounds. The first time that he heard a piano,
the delighted child put one finger, then an
other on the keys, and finally began to form
chords. He wanted to know the relation be
tween the black and white notes, and his
friends promised to satisfy his curiosity when
he could read. At the age of two and a half
he was a fluent reader, and at three years of
age he could write down music, which he was
already beginning to compose. A few of his
earliest musical efforts have been preserved,
notably some waltzes, written at five years of
age. He was very fond of improvisation, and
it was especially by religious themes that he
felt himself inspired. The child, however,
was not only remarkable for his musical or
ganization he showed an equal aptitude
for the sciences, natural history and mechan
ics."
Giuseppe Verdi is setting an example of
noble charity as well as of gratitude to the
artists who have sung in his operas, ana have
so helped to make him famous. The magnifi
cent home for old and indigent artists which
he is builaing in Milan, and which will absorb
a large portion of his fortune, will be one of
the finest charitable institutions in a city
which is remarkable for possessing some of
the most splendid charitable institutions in
the world. In Milan the biggest hospital is a
perfectly ordered city in itself. There is
scarcely any class of indigence which does not
find some well-organized charity ready to
stretch out a helping hand. But strange to
say the singers who congregate therein such j
numbers have hitherto been overlooked in the J
charitable arrangements of the city.
Miss Margaret Reid, a clever young Ameri
can singer, has made a great hit this season at
Covent Garden Theater, London, as a member
of Sir Augustus Harris' company. She will be
remembered as the dainty little prima.douna
of the Bostonians. For the last two years she
has been studying in Paris. In London her
greatest success has been as Nedda in "I
Pagliacci." Miss Reid expects to sing in grand
opera at the Metropolitan Opera-house next
wintar if Abbey & Grau go on with their
preÂ»ent plans.
The younger Coquelin, who played here
with his father a few >earsago at the Grand
Opera-house, has yearnings to become a
lyric artist. It is said that he seriously con
templates abandoning the comedy stage for
opera, and to this intent he has been studying
singing very seriously of late. Ho is shortly to
make his debut as a singer at a grand musical
festival to be held in Amiens, France, to cele
brate the twenty-fifth anniversary ot the
i foundation of the Amiens Harmony Society.
Thea Dorre left the Tavary Opera Company
suddenly just before the disastrous New York
season. She had been billed to. appear in New
York, but the internal strife in the company,
which centered round Guille, had a good deal
to do with her sudden determination to leave.
She went immediately to London under con
tract with the Impresario Vert. There is a
possibility that she will sing "Carmen" at
Covent Garden this season, and an autumn
tour with the Carl Rosa Company ia also on
the tapis.
Le Temps, one of the best newspapers in
Paris, is authority for the statement that Offen
bach's operas are to be splendidly mounted in
New York next winter with Calve and Jean
de Reszke in the leading roles. If a less se
rious and reliable journal had made the state
ment oue would feel inclined to treat it as a
joke. ,
Ernest Gillet, composer of "Loin dv Bal,"
"The Mill" etc., has just completed writing
an onera-comique in three acts, entitled "Lo
Â«1 de la Vierge." The libretto, which la said
to contain both sentiment and gaiety, baa
been written by Charles Chlncholle, and the
music is remarkable for its melodies.
More than two hundred wreaths were laid

THE SCENE INSIDE.
Thousands of Faces, Bits of Color
and Good Nature.
Inside the Pavilion was a vast array of
vacant chairs and bare benches, with here
and there a bit of color to relieve the eye,
but the chairs were not vacant long. It
takes a long time for 5000 or 6000 people to
pile into an auditorium and be ushered to
their proper seats, and this was the case
last night. The floor seemed to fill up
slowly, but tne crowd never stopped com
ing, and by 9 o'clock there were few va
cant seats visible even from a birdseye
view of the gallery.
Pendant from the great arches was a
canopy of two large American flags. Be
low it was the ring. White were its posts,
red the ropes and a circle of blue around
its base. Though bare, it was vivid and
even then eloquent of the combats to fol
low.
The lower floor immediately around the
line was divided into boxes by railings.
The various sections were separated by
curtains of red. At either end and on the
sides chairs and benches and long rows of
faces rose in terraces toward the gallery,
while over the gallery railings were more
tiers and rows of necks and faces "rubber
ing" to the best possible advantage toward
the magnet of all the thousands and thou
sands of eyes, the ring.
The California boutonniere is as much in
evidence on pugilistic as on other public
and popular occasions. The crowd was
dotted with it last night, but it did not ap
pear in all its sweetness, for the odor of
cigars rather smothered it, and the specks
of blood on the flushed faces in the ring
made an unusual contrast in pink.
In this great reservoir, the bottom and
sides of which were humanity, look
ing down from the heights above was an
occasional female face. The spectators
comprised, of course, all kinds, conditions,
and colors of people. There was the silk
hat and the little round hat over one ear
and the cigar protruding upward. There
were also bankers, business men, lawyers
and doctors conspicuous in the learning
and active life of the city as well among
the spectators.
When any well-known sporting man
came in he was greeted with shouts and
applause by the gooa-natured crowd.
For instance, when Justice McFarland
of the Supreme Bench of California and
Judge Campbell made their way slowly
down a crowded aisle, they received quite
an ovation of applause and cheers. They
smiled, but the smile had a sidelight
to it which spreads over the face of a man
who, biting a caromel, finds he has closed
on a lemon. It was an astringent smile.
As 9 o'clock approached the crowd of
spectators gazed harder at the ring, and
looked around for the principals, cheered
for them, and called for them. A brass
band struck up a lively march, and this
served to subdue the shrill whistle of the
youth who had poured $2 of bis hard
earned savings into the Corbett-Sharkey
till, and otherwise distract attention and
lessen 'be decree of impatience.

BEFORE THE STORM.
Preliminary Bouts and the Scene
Encircling Them.
Many opera-glasses were leveled at the
notables as they passed down the long
aisles of faces. It is a fact, owing perhaps
to the stiff prices, that silk hats, white
shirtfronts, solitaire studs and the latest
neckwear were more in evidence than the
smug-faced and more bloodthirsty element
of the human family.
The crowd awoke to more cheers and
greater enthusiasm when the youngsters,
I Rochette and Howard, appeared as a sort
of footlight flash to tne introduction of
the two evening stars of pugilism. It was
like long pent-up steam that had at last
| found a way out. Hats went into the air,
and there was a yell for more "light!" As
a matter of fact, the smoke from thou
sands of cigars, and the chandeliers
turned low made the scene appear rather
dim.
When Billy Jordan, the old-time figure
of the prizering, appeared as the hoarse
voiced master of ceremonies, there was
another cheer. At this time the crowd
had worked itself np to such a pitch that
it would have cheered anything, and the
appearance of such a conspicuous person
as the man who would do all the talking
of the evening made even the seats thrill
with the vibration of the applause.
The tardy janitor was hooted as he
passed down the ai3le, the crowa im
patient for light and lively slugging, and
when a more brilliant blaze of gas light
j suddenly flashed out 6000 throats united
in a chorus of "Ah! Ah! Ah!"
Choyinski was the referee of this event.
It was a popular choice. His decision that
j "Rochette wins!" was followed with a
I shout from the crowd of "Good boy!"
The Davis-Smith contest excited more
! interest. "This will be a better one," it
was said. It was both better and briefer.
Davis went at it hammer and tongs.
Choynski was again referee. Evidently
the sympathy of the crowd was with
"Mysterious Billy." The decision of
Choynski that Smith won was ineffective
so far as Davis was concerned, for, after
I recovering from his grogginess, he re
mained in the ring.
The sudden appearance of Police Cap
i tain Wittman in the ring rout a hush on
j the vast assemblage as effectually as a
shower of rain. When he announced:
"The referee in this fight awards the fight
to Smith, and that settles it," the crowd
showed its approval by a burst of ap
j piause. Davis, who still reluctant and be
' seeching clung to the ropes, was hissed by
| most but cheered by a few.
CORBETT'S CAREER.
Success Has Attended the World's
Champion from the Be
ginning-.
James J. Corbett has had an eventful
ana successful career, with the details of
which Californians are especially conver
sant.
Corbett is now 30 years of age, having
been born in San Francisco in September,
1866. He received a good education and
subsequently blossomed out in business as
a clerk in the Nevada Bank. A natural
liking for athletic sports led him to join
the Olympic Club. He was for a time a
pupil in the art of sparring of Professor
Watson, and so great was his proficiency
with the gloves that the club lost no time
in electing him to be its official instructor.
The professional ring career of the
world's cnampion may be dated from the
time of his barge fichts with Joe Choyn
ski. The first meeting of the men was in
terrupted, but when they got together the
second time there was a long and spirited
contest, resuhing in a decided victory for
Corbett. A bitterness of feeling was then
engendered between these two celebrated
California pugilists which time has not
abated.
In a limited round contest with Jake
Kilrain at New Orleans the decision of the
referee was given in favor of Corbett, who
next met Peter Jackson, the famous col
ored champion, at the California Athletic
Club of this City. All San Franciscans
remember the details of that great battle
and believe that, although it was decided
to be a draw, the victory was virtually
with Corb tt.
His next big match was at New Orleans,
where on September 7, 1892, he fougbt and
won his memorable fight with the doughty
and presumably invinciblt John L. Sdlli
van, thus winning the title to the world's
championship. In his subsequent battle
with Charlie Mitciiell, the English cham
pion, the American was again victorious,
and maintained in brilliant style his title
to the championship.
Since tnen Corbett has been practically
out of the ring, though he has tried hard
upon several occasions to get inside the
ropes with "Bob" Fitzsimmons, the lanky
Australian terror.
The successful theatrical ventures of
Corbett with his manager, W. A. Brady,
his unhappy domestic experience, his
divorce and second marriage are matters
of current history, which need not be
dwelt upon, since they are comparatively
of recent occurrence.
The champion is a man who has brain
as well ai brawn, and it is his habit tc
make good use of both these gifts in all
his contests.
SHARKEY'S RECORD.
Began His Battle With the World
at Ten and "Drifted Into
the Ring."
Tom Sharkey, the sailor, does not make
any pretensions to fistic science or a ring
record, yet, according to his own state
ment, he has been the victor of a dozen or
fifteen brisk bouts. He is unquestionably
a remarkable man, of limitless pluck and
ambition.
"There's mighty little in my life worth
writing about." he said yesterday when
asked for some points. "To-morrow, per
haps, I may be a bigger man than lam
to-day. Whatever the result of my battle
with Corbett may be, I am feeling as
strong as a bull and do not fear to meet,
him or any man on earth.
"I was born in Ireland in 1872 and when
I was 9 years old ran away from home. I
took the name of Tom Kelly and for five
years my folks heard nothing from me.
Yes, I am a single man and have had
some pretty ham knocks in my time. I
came to this country when I was a boy of
ten and worked at the blacksmithing trade
in New York for two years. Then I fol
lowed the sea for the next eight years.
"I was always fond of boxing and just
naturally drifted into the ring. I never
took any lessons, and all I know of the
science has been picked up by experience.
"I've had a considerable number of
fights. Few of them are at all celebrated,
but every one of them was hard. I've
never yet been defeated. My eight-round
contest with Aleck Greggainswas declared
a draw, but as you know, when I recently
met Joe Choynski, who undertook to stop
me in eight rounds, the decision was in
my favor. I've defeated Sailor Brown in
one round, Billy Smith in six rounds,
Nick Barley in eight rounds ana- Jim Wil
liams in seven rounds. These are my
best-known battles, but I've also met and
vanquished at different times and places
Messrs. Thompson, Langley, Pickett,
Byington, Harvey, Gardner, Mulverhill,
Dunn, Miller, McAuliffe and Trainor.
That talk about my having made my jaw
a chopplng-block for my shipmates is all
bosh, as are many other things that have
been said about me."
. m
"THE CALL'S" PROPHECY.
It Foreshadowed Sullivan's Defeat
by Corbett at New Or
leans.
It will be remembered by the knowing
ones that before the Sullivan-Corbett
fiasco The Call was the only San Fran
cisco paper to come out fairly and squarely
and state that the champion's condition
was not what it should be, and that "Our
Jim" stood a far better chance than was
generally conceded by ringmen.
What The Call said on that occasion
may prove interesting. The following
THE SAN FRAjS CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1806.
pertinent paragraphs are selected at
random:
Sullivan, according to the most reliable ad
vices Irom his training quarters, is in perfect
condition and fit io fignt for his lifeâ so says
his trainer, Phil Casey.
Probably Sullivan is"in as good form as could
be got, but that is far from perfect-
It is out of the question to'suppose that Sulli
van, as he appeared in this City on his return
from Australia, could in a six weeks' course of
training work oft the handful of superfluous
flesh that lined his body without impairing
his really magnificent constitution.
The champion, if he hopes to win, certainly
looks lor a short and punishing flftht, and with
this aim in view he has trained accordingly.
Now, the question is, can Sullivan land on
Corbett when he makes that celebrated charge
which has driven terror into the hearts of his
former opponents?
He may, but it is extremely doubtful.
Corbett is as quick on his feet as the cele
brated pantomime pugilist, Ike Weir, and if
he can only remain cool and collected and
will not be subdued, so to speak, by the big
fellow's looks and general appearance, Sulli
van will find a delusionâ a will-o'-the-wisp, as
it wereâ easy to see but hard to reach.
The Californian has long since mapped out
his plan of battle. He will tantalize the big;
fellow in every way imaginable, in the hope of
getting him to rush wildly at him. Rushing
and missing is more damaging to a pugilist
than a rush followed by a hit. Two or three
rounds of the former will get Sullivan with
bellows to mend, and then James will com
mence operations on Sullivan's face and stom
ach.
If Corbett is thoroughly game he has all the
other requirements necessary, and should, all
things considered, defeat "Sullivan on the
evening of September 7, provided the contest
will be allowed to go to a finish.
NEVER HEARD OF CORBETT
A Rich Hollander Arrives in
Town and Decides to
See a " Go."
He Tells of a Great Government Plan
to Recover Land for the
Peasant Class.
"Corbett? Champion of the world? Who
is he? I have not heard of him before,"
said H. Y. Spyke, a wealthy Hollander,
who arrived at the California yesterday on
a tour around the world.
And then when he was told briefly of the
celebrity whose fame had never reached
him at Amsterdam and of the fight to
come off in a few hours he hastily drew
out his notebook and on a blank space
below "Yosemite," "Del Monte," "Stan
ford University" he wrote "Corbett,
Pavilion (Mechanics')," and eagerly in
quired for further information about this
professional pumme'.ing so new to him.
The eyes of the man who owns the street
car lines of Amsterdam fairly snapped as
he heard of the brute force of the great
John L. Sullivan, another of the Ameri
can sights not on his list, and of the for
mer prowess of the colored giant from
Australia, and of the wonderful quickness
of Corbett, one of San Francisco's home
products.
"I must see that fight," said the enthu
siastic traveler, who had only a few mo
ments before been discussing in a serious,
business way the industries of Holland
and the great project of his Government to
reclaim from the sea an immense area
now covered by an arm of the North Sea.
The plans have already been made, Mr.
Spyke said, for building dykes and con
structing canals so as to confine the present
North Sea that forms the great indenta
tion in the north coast line of Holland.
It has not been decided yet whetner the
Government will undertake the work or
whether it will let the contract to private
individuals. The estimated cost is $100,
--000,000, but the land area of Holland will
be increased one-tenth. The work is to be
completed in twenty-five years.
There are two important economic prob
lems involved in this great undertaking.
All along the shores of lue sea live thou
sands of Dutch fishermen who for years
have supplied the markets of Germany
with salt-water fish. To protect this, in
dustry the Government proposes to re
serve a sort of inland sea, into which the
Rhine and other smaller rivers will be
allowed to flow on their wav to the North
Sea.
But the most important plan is that for
the settlement of the new territory. It is
all to be divided up into small holdings
for tbe benefit of working people. No man
who does not live on and work his section
will be permitted to hold one of the Gov
ernment leases, which are to be made for
long terms.
Cable-cars cannot be used in Amsterdam
because there is water everywhere only
three feet below the surface of the earth.
The great agricultural problem in Hol
land is not irrigation ; it is drainage.
In Amsterdam there are only forty
agreeable days in the whole year. It is
cold, and bleak, and windy, and foggy,
and there are sudden severe changes in
the temperature. Mr. Spyke is looking
for a nice mild climate for a married
brother who wants to try something better.
Mr. Spyke said that the architecture of
San Francisco is very ungraceful. Even
the Parrott building did not suit him. He
declares that as soon as he laid eyes on its
broad front crowded right up to the street
he knew no European architect planned it.
Mr. Spyke will be here ten days before
continuing his journey by the way of Van
couver and Yokohama.
COLD-BLOODED STUTZ.
Mrs. Borden'a Murderer Tried in Vain
to I ii Burn His Life for
810,000.
George Stutz, who killed Mrs. Cora
Borden and then completed the tragedy
by taking his own life, had evidently con
templated the course for some time. Last
week he entered the oflice of a prominent
insurance company and asked to be exam
ined for a policy of $10,000. He desired it
issued in favor of an Eastern relative.
Stutz was examined by the company's
physician, who discovered that the appli
cant was suffering from an organic trouble
of long standing. When told that the
company would decline the risk if sent
forward he displayed considerable vexa
tion, paying, as he left: "Some one will
hear from me later on."
Many of the murdered woman's friends
gathered at the Morgue yesterday to view
the body. One of the ladies urged that
the remains should not be deposited in the
potter's field, as she had left enough jew
elry io bury her decently. These jewels
consist of diamond earrings worth $100
and some finger-rings aggregating $50 in
value. In addition to this the claim is
made that she had some gold coins in a
chamois-skin bag which she carried in her
bosom. If this chamois-skin bag ever ex
isted it has not been found by the police
or the Coroner's deputies.
Mrs. 6'itzmaurice stated yesterday that
she would adopt Mrs. Borden'a boy. She
will attend to all the details of the burial
oj the murdered woman and will be as
sisted in this by a committee from Gettys
burg Circle, Ladies of the Grand Army, of
which Mrs. Borden was a member. She
was also prominent in the order of Com
panions of the Forest.
A Peculiar Will.
The will of Caroline Vetter, which disposes
of considerable real estate situated on Market
and Bixth streets and on Fell street, has been
filed for probate. The administrator named,
however, reports that there is no property be
longing to deceased. It seems that Mrs. Vetter
made a deed of iclft to her son, Frederick J.
Vetter, some time in February last, conveying
her real estate to him. The will was made in
1893.
The Durrant Cage.
But one more step is required before the
Durrant bill of exceptions is ready for the Su
preme Court. Judge Murphy yesterday ap
proved the engrossed bill, and now all that re
mains to be done is to have the record printed.
This can probably be done before the July
term of the Supreme Court.
LAMOREUX HAS
A PET SCHEME,
The General Land Commis
sioner Here From
Washington.
TOUR OF INSPECTION.
Would Facilitate Survey and
Settlement of Govern
ment Lands.
NOTABLE MEN IN THE PAKTY
Visited Yellowstone Park and Will
Denounce the Scheme to Cut
Off a Corner.
8. W. Lamoreux, Commissioner of the
General Land Oltice at Washington, ar
rived here yesterday, in the course of an
extensive tour through the Western States
for the purpose of perfecting his plan to
facilitate the opening up of Government
lands for settlement.
In the party with him were his nephew,
Frank B. Lamoreux.a lawyer of Wisconsin ;
Charles H. Webb, head of the big New
York drygoods firm of Dunham, Buckley
& Co., of which Governor Buckley of Con
necticut is a member, and A. J. Britten of
Washington, D. C, of the law firm of Brit
ten & Gray, and known as one of tbe big
lawyers of the country, partly because of
having framed most of the laws pertaining
to the public domain.
Through the courtesy of the Southern
Pacific Railroad a special train was in
waiting at Portland and brought the party
into this City yesterday forenoon after an
all-night stop at Red Blutf. W. H. Mills,
land aeent of tbe Central Pacific Railroad,
and Will S. Green. Surveyor-General of
California, accompanied the Commissioner
and his friends on the trip from Oregon,
While the tour is partly for pleasure, it
is mainly one of official inspection. The
office of every Attorney-General is being
visited, as is it is Commissioner Lamo
reux's purpose to see tbe land officials in
the several States, and to discuss a num
ber of important matters with them. His
pet scheme and the main purpose of his
visit is to have instituted a more rapid
system of surveys.
He wishes also to learn what additional
help each State wants In its land office,
this year's appropriation for Government
surveys being one-third larger than for
several ye&rs past and consequently allow
ing for additional work.
California, as one of the comparatively
new States, will have more than a third
extra work done.for she will get more than
a proportionate one-third increase of Gov
ernment funds.
Utah, California, Washington and Mon
tana all desire a speody extension of their
surveys, while the older States are not so
much concernÂ«'o.
Since Mr. Lamoreaux assumed his pres
ent office he has introduced some of the
rapid methods he is at present advocating.
A few years ago the system of business
between the State offices and the general
land office at Washington was very com
plicated. From two to five years were re
quired from the making of the contract to
the tiling of the plat eventually opening
the land for settlement. Some surveys
made in California twelve year* ago, Mr.
Lamoreux says, are not yet adjusted.
Already he has succeeded in reducing
the time to a year and he wishes to estab
lish a system that will shorten the work
to six months. This he beheves can be
done by baying examinations made in the
presence of a deputy.
To save time Mr. Lamoreaux had Sur
veyor-General Arnold of Oregon and Sur
veyor-General Green of California meet
him at Portland, where he talked over all
his plans and schemes.
At Helena he conferred with the Mon
tana Mineral Commissioners, who have
charge of the classification of the mineral
lands of the State.
He spent a week in the Yellowstone
personally investigating the proposition
to cut off the northeast corner of the Na
tional Park in order to permit railroads to
bring the traveling public practically into
the Government reserve, on which no rail
roads can encroach.
The plan, as introduced in Washington,
was to changethepark boundary line from
the summit of a mountain ridge down to
the base. The change had been urged by
the Montana delegation.
Mr. Lamoreux says that he learned
that the Montana delegation had never
seen the place, and he also saw for him
self that the mountain side is heavily tim
bered, and the only shelter in winter for
the elk and antelope that are in the park.
He is now determined to oppose the
railroad proposition and to report ad
versely on it when he returns to Washing
ton. He says he thinks what he will say
will prevent the revival of the scheme for
a good many years.
Mr. Lemoreux will leave here to-mor
row for Los Angeles. From there he will
go to Salt Lake and Denver and finally to
the Democratic National Convention at
Chicago.
BALDWIN ON THE STAND,
He Denies Nearly All of Miss
Lillian A. Ashley's
Charges.
Says He Did Not Promise to Adopt
Her or Give Her _Any of His
Racehorses.
E. J. Baldwin was on the stand nearly
all day yesterday in Judge Slack's court,
bnt nothing new was developed from his
testimony. He was on direct examination
and tbe questions asked were propounded
by his own attorneys, consequently he had
an easy time. Miss Ashley's counselors,
however, promise to put him on the rack
to-day in cross-examination.
Mr. Baldwin's testimony was a general
and specific denial of each and all ot Miss
Ashley's charges, excepting that he
acknowledged having been intimate with
her at the Baldwin Hotel and at the Hotel
Coronado. He also admitted having given
her money several times.
The whole period during which the prin
cipals in the suit were acquainted was
gone over, and Mr. Baldwin's replies to
the questions usually were "yes" or "no,"
the most of the evidence being contained
in the interrogatives.
Baldwin denied ever having promised to
care for tbe plaintiff or her child. He
also said he did not promise to adopt Miss
Ashley. He expressed tbe belief that he
was not the father of the baby in the
case.
To the question, "Did she ever call you
'papa?'" he answered quickly and vigor
ously, "no."
"Did you ever say to her, 'we,' meaning
yourself and Miss Ashley, 'might have a
d aughter of our own?' "
"2s o, sir; I did not," answered Mr. Bald
win.
"Did you promise that if she would
become your daughter you would provide
a place for her in society, cover her with
costly gems, send her to school to com
plete her education and give her any horse
that she wanted our of your racing sta
ble?"
"No, sir."
"Did you say to Miss Ashley that al
though people 'thought you rich and happy
you were miserable and longed for a
friend ; that you were lonely and unhappy
and would change places with the ragged
est urchin in tlie streets for one hour's real
happiness?"
\\ bile the different phases of the ques
tion were being pathetically sounded by
Mr. Highton, Baldwin smiled erimly.
After thoughtfully rubbing his chin for a
moment, he softly replied: "No, sir."
Yesterday morning strenuous efforts
were made to introduce Miss Ashley's
deposition taken at IjOb Aneeles before the
beginning of the present suit, in it she
said that she was a virtuous woman before
she met Mr. Baldwin, but she has since
been forced to admit that she has her
shortcomings.
Baldwin testified as to dates and letters
which passed between himself and Miss
Ashley.
The trial will go on to-monow, with
Baldwin still on the stand.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Crew of the North Bend Has
a Grievance Against the
Owners.
The crew of the barkentine North Bend
arrived from Gray's Harbor on the steamer
Sunol yesterday, and they are now on the
warpath. Some days ago the mill at
Gray's Harbor caught fire and the flames
communicated with the North Bend. The
barkentine's deck was all charred, the
standing rigging burned and the forecastle
gutted. The crew lost all their effects
while fiehting the flames, and a few days
later were paid off Dy the company. Al
though they signed before the United
States Commissioner for the round trip
they did not receive any recompense for
tbe lost time or their lost kits and had to
pay their way to San Francisco. Yester
day they said they would take the matter
into court and make the company do
something for them.
Captain Hamilton of the British ship
St. Mungo is in a peck of trouble. He has
a negro crew and they practically run the
ship. They do as they like and come and
go as they please. A few nights ago the
men were ordered to stay by the ship.
The captain's back was hardly turned be
fure three of the men were over the side
and on their way up town. The police
will not interfere and the British Consul
cannot help the captain. Should the men
elect to go back to England in the ship
they will receive a warm reception at the
hands of the British authorities. When
the St. Mungo arrived here three of the
crew were in irons.
The races at Sausalito next Saturday are
going to be a success. An additional
event has been added. The mates of the
ships laid up at Sausalito und the mates
of the vessels this side of the bay are to
make up a four-oared gig contest, which
should be very excitine. The tlagsbip
will be the Orion and tickets for her can
be had from any of the masters in port or
from Captain Crowdace. The course for
the races will be from the Orion around
the Hahnemann, Wynstay, Ditton, Lynd
hurst and then back to the Orion. All
visitors with tickets will be taken off in
the ships' boats from the Marine wharf,
Sausaiito, to the various vessels in the
stream.
The special excursion to Benicia on the
Monticello next Sunday will not start at
10:30 a. m., as stated in yesterday's paper,
but at Ba. M. sharp. The occasion is the
wedding of Captain S. Randall of the
steamer.
The tug Barclay Golden is being got
ready for her long run to South America.
In order to utilize all the space possible
coal in the shape of compressed bricks
will be used. In this shape it is thought
the little craft will be able to carry enough
to last her to Peru.
T. Bailey, late head stevedore of the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany, has received little consolation from
the return of Senator Perkins. It now
transpires that Goodall, Perkins & Co.
have no longer any say in tbe employment
of the Navigation Company's servants and
that Superintendent YVard is supreme at
this end. It is rumored on the front that
the reason for Bailey's dismissal was that.
he coveted Ward's position.
The Mail Company' 3 steamer San Jose
arrived from Panama and way ports yes
terday with the following passengers: Er

ANOTHER VICTIM
OF THE DISASTER,
Dennis Griffin, a Laborer,
Dies From Serious
Injuries.
FOUR PERSONS NOW DEAD
It Is Believed That There Are
More Bodies Under the
Debris.
BRACING A TALL BUILDINi
The Work of Clearing Away the
Wreckage Will Be Actively
Begun This Afternoon.
Another victim has been added to the
list of those who perished in the Fifth
street disaster. Dennis Griffin, one of the
hod-carriers, who was caught in the wreck
when the Brighton House went down on
Monday afternoon, died at 10 o'clock yes
terday morning in the City and County
Hospital, and his body was removed to the
Morsne. He was sent from the wreck to
the Receiving Hospital, where it was found
that the pelvic bone was fractured and that
he was seriously injured internally.
Griffin was the fourth in the list of those
fatally injured. He was a hod-carrier liv
ing at 21 Page street. He leaves a widow
and one little child. He was 29 years of
age and a native of Ireland. The others
who were killed and died from their in
juries were Jespe May, Mrs. Ernestine
Silverstein and Patrick McKeown.
Coroner Hawkins is still pursuing bis in
vestigation, so as to be prepared with all
the facts and witnesses when the inquests
are held, the date of which has not yet
been set. Yesterday the deputies im
paneled a jury and, with one exception,
the jurymen are all doing business on
Davis street. They are: J. Gallinger, 308
Davis; F. Gaughey, 306 Davis; 1. Er
langer. 304 Davis; D. Ross, 300 Davis; R.
Gilbert, 206 Davis; H. W. Rawlison, 201
Davis; A. E. Martinetti, 115 Davis; F.
Zann, 310 Davis, and Max Loebner, 102
California. The jury, after viewing the
bodies, was excused unti) called for the in
quests, after which nearly all of the dead
were removed to undertaking establish
ments.
The work of removing the debris of the
wrecked building will not be begun until
to-day, probably in the afternoon. There
is a strong belief in the minds of many
that there are at least two more bodies
under the east wall, where May was
found, and the other is supposed to be
one of Sibley's workmen, who, it is
thought, met his death near the southeast
corner of the structure which was the first
to go into the basement with a crash. Sib
ley thinks that there are no more bodies in
the basement, but his foreman, Davis,
when the boss is not near, expresses a dif
ferent view. He has said that he was in
the basement when the house fell and that
Workmen Patting Braces Against the Wall of the Lincoln House to Prerent It
Toppling Over on the Ruins.
there were two men at work there under
the corner that was the first to fall.
Several of the men who were at first re- I
ported to be among the missing have re- !
appeared all right, each with a tale to tell |
of how he managed to escape, but there
are two who have not been heard from,
and one was seen by the foreman in the
fatal spot mentioned. He does not Know
the men's names, because on such work
he usually hires the first likely looking
men who ask for employment. But to-day
the question as to whether or not there
are any bodies in the ruins will probably
be definitely decided.
All of yesterday was consumed in brac
ing up the walls and foundations of the
Lincoln House, at 20 Fifth street, which
work the Fire Department officials say
must be done before undertaking the
other. They do not propose to take any
risk of a repetition of Monday's calamity
and they say that the tail narrow building
stands on a foundation on the east side
that is none too secure. The first work
was to put up three 41-foot braces against
the wall, which will prevent it toppling I
over. This morning a long heavy timber j
will be placed under the east side to assist j
in holding the weight of the structure, j
This was pursued by Contractor Sullivan :
with a force of men and the work was not j
as safe as could be desired. They were j
forced to scale the high wall and make
their ladders as they progressed. Tackle
and falls were slung from the roof of the
building, and by these the long timber
braces were drawn into position and then j
lacked un at their footings on the street.
The question of who is responsible for
the disaster is still being investigated by
the Fire Department officials, and, judg
ing from remarks made by them, Sibley,
Davis and Gleason will come in for an
equal share of the censure. District En
gineer Shaughnessey, accompanied by-
Contractor Kelleher, who is an expert on
house moving and raising, went over and
under the wreck aeain, and found that
the situation was about the same aa stated
in The Call yesterday. The workmen
I had braced the sand embankments on
! the street against the cribs, which were
j only intended to carry the weight of the
building. These sandbanks were nine
feet ueep, and some idea can be obtained
of the amount of lateral pres
sure they exerted upon the direct
supports when it is remembered
sand runs at an angle of 45 degrees. With
a nine-foot bank the volume was about
four and a half feet square and seventy
rive feet long. Ordinary sand weighs
about one and a quarter tons to the yard.
It is no wonder, the experts say, that the
supports of the building were pushed in,
letting the structure topple into the street.
A!l of the facts bearing on this feature of
the case will be carefully noted as the
work of excavation goes on.
The crowd in the street around the ruins
was not so large yesterday, but still the
police were kept busy keeping the people
away from the dangerous places and from
getting in the workmen's way.
By night Mint avenue was well cleared
of the bic pile of debris from the wreck.
When one pile was carted away the fact
was revealed that the United States Mint's
big street scalps had been ruined. The
platform bad been crushed deep into the
space where the machinery of the scales
is located.
Every care is taken to save all property
of value, but nearly all articles are hope
lessly spoiled. Among the things re
covered was a suit of clothes supposed to
belong to Leonberger, one of the injured,
who is now in the German Hospital. In
the pockets were a watchcharrn and a
purse containing money. Pearl Wood
ward, whose escape from death has caused
so much comment, was fortunate yester
day in finding ncr purse, which contained
several dollars and some jewelry.
Many of the articles recovered from the
debris will never be taken away by the
owners, so effectual was the destructive
force of the falling building.
Gleason'B Denial.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Having seen an arti
cle in this morning's Call in connection with
the statement made by Chief Sullivan of my
very nearly having had a similar catastrophe
with the Langham building on Mason and
Ellis streets, I wish to state that the Chief's
informant is mistaken. I have never done any
work on the Langham Hotel.
P. w. Gleason.
\ Pickpocket Arrested.
James Hunter, alias >4 Kid" Vincent, a well
known pickpocket, was attempting to ply his
vocation in the crowd on Van Ness avenue
yesterday afternoon, gathered to see the
funeral procession, wfcen he was arrested by
Detective Graham and taken to the City
Prison. A woman who was with him escaped.
Hunter was sentenced to jail for six months
for vr.grancy by Judge Campbell about two
weeks ago and was out on an appeal bond.

ables men to throw aside all barriers.
Who is the man who is always at the head of the great
institutions of his country ? The manly man.
Who is the man who throws aside all obstacles and wins
! fortune in the midst of famine ? The manly man.
Who is the man who, when other men hesitate in fear of I
i disaster, springs forward and snatches the dying spark from the i
ruins, whips it into a flame and lights the path to success ? He
is the manly man. /
The "manly man" is a man of nerve, of quick intellect,
courage and self confidence. He is the man who has preserved j
the power of manhood given him by nature ; or, having wasted
it once, he has regained it through the only absolutely certain
means open to him through
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
Would you be manly ? Would you attain perfect manhood,
physically, mentally and otherwise ? Would you regain your
confidence in yourself, your nerve force, your vitality ? You
can. No man is so weak but that he can be made strong by Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt. No spark of vitality is so low but it can
be whipped into fire by this wonderful life-renewer.
Why not you ? Why not

Much more could be said. Let Dr. Sanden tell you of it in his

Chronic!* Bulletin*,THERE IS HOPE
FOR THE LEPER,
Five Packages of the Fa
mous Goto Remedy
in Port.
ITS CURES MARVELOUS.
Two of San Francisco's Afflicted
Have Already Been
Relieved.
WAS THE WORK OF CHARITY.
Supervisor Berjjamin Appeals Suc
cessfully for Funds Through the
Columns of "The Call."
Lying in the Custom-house of this City
awaiting the moving of the rather pon
derous machinery of the import laws are
five medium-sized but curiously marked
packages. The hieroglyphics upon these
packages proclaim them travelers from
the land of the Orient. Amid the strange
Japanese characters is scrawled in Eng
lish, "J. T. Marsh, Importer of Japanese
Hoods, San Francisco." Perhaps in the
vertical rows of Oriental character there is
something that tells the initiate that these
commonplace-appearing packages contain
the one hope of a groiiD of most wretched
beings. Perhaps the bare-legged cooly, as
ho carried these boxes along the narrow
streets of Yokohama, thought of the
frightful misery they were destined to re
lieve, but to the deckhand of the Rio
Janeiro they were rive packages for J. T.
Marsh of San Francisco. Nothing more.
Many months have gone by since it was
announced through the columns of The
('all ibai there was hope for the lepers
who lead a miserable existence at the City
l'e>thouse, living only that they may
suffer, and having nothing to look for
ward to but increasing suffering with in
creasing years.
Strangely enough it was through one of
the stricken ones that the story of hope
was first made known. Among the in
mates of the pesthou?e were two boys of
English parentage, but born in Hawaii.
Both boys were sadly afflicted with
leprosy, and on their arrival Dr. George
L. Fitch, an eminent specialist in this
dread malady, informed their father, who
was his friend, that the boys had not many
months to live. Then one of the boys,
Ernest Bindt, told of the wonderful results
which had followed the application of a
remedy used by Dr. Goto, a Japanese,
when Bindt was in Honolulu, he had the
confidence born of despair, that if he
could procure some of this same remedy
he yet might live and overcome his disease.
Dr. Goto was not a stranger to Dr. Fitcfi.
Several years ago when Goto was a young
man he came to this City and spent a term
at the Cooper Medical College. Even then
he was a specialist in leprosy and diseases
akin thereto, as had been his father and
his grandfather. Goto was himself born
in a leprosy hospital, and had been raised
with the thought that it was his mission
ir. iife to alleviate the suffering of these
unfortunates, who abound in his native
land. While in San Francisco Dr. Fitch,
who had recently returned from laboring
imong the leoers of the Sandwich Islands,
met the learned young Japanese student
and became much impressed with his
ability.
Accordingly when Bindt said that Dr.
Goto had successfully treated him for
leprosy, Dr. Fitch was inclined to give the
statement considerable credence, and he
advised the boy's father to send for tne
remedy. Fifty dollars' worth was pro- j
cured "first from the Goto Hospital in the
suburbs of Yokohama. This proved so
effectual that when it was exhausted a ;
Jike amount was secured, and by the time i
this had been used there was no need of ]
any more. Both lads were so far advanced
toward recovery that under the care of Dr. '
Fitch they became strong and healthy in
appearance, save that the fingers of both
hands were drawn close. Both of the
boys were recently declared cured by Dr.
Montgomery, and Dr. Fitch coincides in
this veidict. One of them recently es
caped and is at present earning a man's
wages as a laborer in the country.
When Charles E. .Benjamin was elected
to the office of Supervisor he at once
started on a tour "of inspection. The
prisons, the Almshouse and the hospitals
were all visited by him and in the course
of his duties he examined the Pesthouse.
He was much shocked at its condition,
and he determined to do what he could to
alleviate the sufferings of the inmates. To
this end he has repoatedly striven to have
a new pesthouse erected on the Alms
house tract. In this he has failed.
'â¢There are fourteen afflicted people
caged up there in a rookery in which 1
would not allow my team to be kept," he
declares, "and yet on account of the op
position of Mayor Sutro I cannot get
seven votes for the erection of a new pest
house lor which the money has been ap
propriated.' 1
While Investigating the condition of the
Pesthouse Supervisor Benjamin became
particularly interested in the lepers. Their
utter hopelessness appealed to nis sympa
thy and gazing in horror at their dreadful
lot he one day exclaimed to Dr. Fitch: "Is
there nothing in the world that could pos
sibly help these poor people?''
"Yes," answered the doctor, "There is
one thing, but it would cost some money."
And then he recounted the story of the
Bindt boys' cure and of Dr. Goto's marve
lous remedy.
"If money can procure that remedy,"
said the Supervisor, "they shall have it."
It was not a difficult matter securing
funds to purchase the remedy. A story of
wuat Dr. Fitch and Supervisor Benjamin
propos d was published in The Call and
a subscription hat was opened at its office.
Other parlies started out on a personal
canvass and in a day or two the requisite
|200 was raised.
It is a long way to Japan, and the
philanthropists interested might have
been seriously embarrassed had it not
been for the kindly assistance rendered
by J. T. Marsh. Mr. Marsh volunteered
to see that the purchase was made, and
this he has successfully accomplished.
His services and those of his agents were
donated, and the prompt arrival of the
remedy is due to his energy.
Although the five packages of the Goto
remedy arrived by the Bteamer Rio
Janeiro there is still a slight difficulty to
be overcome. The income duty on such
articles is 25 per cent ad valorem. That
would make a duty of $50, upon which the
subscribers have not counted. Supervisor
Benjamin, who was atone time connected
with tne Custom-house, says be is under
the impression that there is a clause in the
â¢ct whereby articles intended for chari
table Use and free dispensation can be en
tered iree. He intends calling upon Col
lector Wise to-day to see if such a clause
can be taken advantage of. "At any
rate," he says, "the remedy is here, and
we will have it in the hands of the Health
Department within ten days. If it is
necessary to raise $50 more I will have no
trouble in doing so. The lepers are now
c rtain to get the medicine."
Dr. Fitch, who has seen the Gato remedy
used in Honolulu, says it consists of pills,
to be taken internally, and hot baths in
water in which herbs have been steeped.
The effects of the treatment are said to
be almost immediate and in cases of anes
thetic leprosy the proportion of cures is
said to be very large.
"The notion that leprosy is incurable,"
said Dr. Fitch, "is fast being exploded.
Dr. Kitsato, a Japanese by birth and one
of the most eminent physicians in Ger
many, has recently declared that he had
an absolute remedy lor the disease. When
a man of his standing makes such a state
ment the medical profession listens re
spectfully. "
THE M'MULLIN CASE.
Judge Scawell Declines to Allow Per
manent Alimony.
Judge Seawell yesterday rendered a de
cision in the "-"se of Virginia McMullin
against Thurlow McMullin, for alimony
and permanent maintenance. The Buit
was brought on June 2, 1894.
Mrs. McMullin did not pray for a di
vorce, her claim being only one for main
tenance, based on an allegation that in
1877 the defendant had willfully deserted
her.
In his decision Judce seawell States that
the fact that the desertion had been appar
ently acquiesced in for so many years does
not bar the plaintiff from alimony, be
cause the fact of the desertion wos con
stantly going on. Neither does the fact
that Mrs. McMulii-.i refused to allow her
husband to see their child indicate that
she wished the rupture to continue. It
might indicate a desire to force him to
return in order that he might see his
child.
On April 13, 1895, the defendant wrote to
his wife proposing a reconciliation, but
this was refused. This ended the deser
tion on the part of Mr. McMullin.
Judge Seawell therefore awarded to Mrs.
McMullin alimony from the time the suit
was commenced, June 2, 1894, to April 13,
1895, when the letter of reconciliation was
written. The amount allowed was $800;
500 was also allowed for counsel fees.

i Mrs. McMullin's petition for permanent
maintenance was, nowever, denied and
judgment entered for the defendant.
BUSY AT HEADQUARTERS.
Woman Suffragists Preparing
for the Ratification
Meeting.
Numerous Sympathizers Visit the New
Offices in the Emporium
Building.
The Woman's Suffrage headquarters, on
the fifth floor of the Emporium building,
is one of the busiest offices in the City just
at present. Before the matting was down
on the floors of the three rooms, visitors,
who sympathized with the cause began to
call, ana there has been an almost constant
stream of them ever since. The building
is yet in the hands of the contractors, ana
is closed at 6 o'clock, otherwise the head
quarters would remain open all evening,
and it is believed that the sympathizers,
both men and women, would be in evi
dence tiil quite a late hour.
The rooms are numbers 563, 564 and 565.
Two of them are fitted up as offices, and
the third is a reception room, where Miss
Mary Garrett Hay, chairman of the State
Central Committee, is at home to every one
who comes to see her on business. Her
time is very fully occupied, however, as
she is in communication with sympathiz
ers in all the political parties, and has, be
sides, to keep in touch with work being
done by the women all over the State, and
in the clubs already organized in the va
rious districts of this City and Oakland.
Miss Hay is assisted by Mrs. Sweet, Miss
Susan B. Anthony's stenographer.
The two office-rooms of the headquar
ters during working hours contain a busy
corps of ladies, who are always ready,
however, to stop their writing or "typing"
to make a visitor welcome. Ti e rooms
are light and airy and are neatly but pret
tily furnished. Just at present what is j
occupying attention at headquarters is
the ratification meeting, which will take
place to-morrow night in Metropolitan
Temple. It is expected that there will be
a great rally of sympathizers with the
cause, and the programme which has been I
arranged leaves no doubt as to the interest
of the proceedings.
Charles M. Shortridge will be the speaker
representing the Republican party; Hon.
James Maguire, a Democrat" with a per
sonal sympathy for woman's suffrage,
will speak on the women's political cause
from a Democratic standpoint and Thomas
V. Cator will speak for Populists. The
rest of the programme will consist of five
minute talks by Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,
Miss Mollie Conners, Mrs. Nellie Hol
brook Blinn, Mrs. Elizabeth U. Yates and
Rev. Anna Shaw. Miss busan B. Anthony
will preside. Admission is iree and there i
will be no collection.
Kreach of I'rouiise Demurrer.
Thomas Carter's attorneys have entered a
demurrer to the complaint of Mary E. Red
mond, who iÂ» suing Mr. Carter for $50,000
for breach of promise to marry her. They
allege that the facts Etated are not sufficient
to constitute a ground of action.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1896.
SAN FRANCISCO
CLAIMS THE STAGE,
New York Can No Longer
Boast of Her Actor-
Warwick.
LA FAILLE'S TRAINING.
She Will Take a Frominent
Part in the " Heart of
Maryland."
HORTENSE NEILSON HONORED.
A Galaxy of Embryonic California
Talent Is Well Recognized
in the East.
Dave Belasco of New York city has
obtained a worldwide reputation for his
heroic methods in making obscure women
with histrionic taleut prima donnas and
stars. But Dave with hi 3 quiet and sedate
Eastern environment can never hope to
compete with the virile climate of the
Pacific Coast. In other words, his brother
Fred is discounting him ten to one. It
transpires that Frederick is not a plagiar
ist of Dave, but quite the opposite is the
true state of affairs.
Kosalie La Faille, who last year was en
gaged by Belasco of the Eas,t, to play in
the ''Heart of Maryland," received a dis
patch yesterday bidding her to be in New
York city by the middle of August to ful
fill her engaeement in that company at
Herald-square Theater. Miss La Faille is
a daughter of San Francisco and at present
is a school-ma'am of exceeding popularity
and a subject also of great envy among
the young ladies of her present profession,
because she possesses in a high degree the
gift of acting. She will leave the latter
part of July for New York.
The old stage proverb that San Fran
cisco furnishes the majority of the histri
onic talent of this country is verified.
Witn her goes Charles Bryant, a San Fran
cisco youth, to take a prominent part in
the same company. In a recent letter to
his brother Dave Belasco writes: "If at
any time you have a young man or a
young woman of ability, conscientious and
studious, let me know and I can place
them in good companies. I am much im
pressed with the embryonic San Francisco
talent, and prefer to give its representa
tives a chow before all others," which
shows that Dave i 3 not only true to the
land of his birth but also appreciates a
goodthinp when he sees it.
Kosalie La Faille will take an emotional
part in the play. Emotionalism is her
forte. Mr. Belasco is putting her through
a course of sprouts in regard to falls, etc.
She works a la Mrs. Carter night and
day. A Call reporter happened to drop
into the academy yesterday. Miss La
Faille was in a horizontal position and the
building was still vibrating from the shock
of her recent contact with the floor.
"Does it hurt?" was asked politely as soon
as the future star had regained an upright
position. "Oh no; not at all now. I be
lieve I could fall from the top of the Odd
Fellows' building without any senous con
sequences."
Miss Mayme Nevada Heffron will be
another of the youne ladies to accompany
the exodus East. She will also take a
prominent part in the "Heart of Mary
land," and is an ex-member of the Colum
bia School of Acting. She was born in
Virginia City, and takes her middle name,
"Nevada," from her mother State. This,
by the way, will be her lirat name on the
stage.
Miss Hortense Neilson, the sister of
Alice Neilson of the Bostonians, is not the
least of this galaxy of theatrical stars near
the horizon. She has secured an engage
ment with the company of Kich and
Harris, the Boston Comedy Company.
She is a native daughter of California, is
well known here and immensely popular.
She will take a prominent part in the
comedy, '-The Night Clerk." She has
been put through falling, standing, walk
ing and articulating by Fred Belasco. She
commences to realize that acting is no
longer a thing of butterfly nature. ''Oh,
of course," said she, "I shall not sue Mr.
Belasco for compensation, and I do not
expect Mr. Belasco to do so either."
A telegram wae received by his brother
from Dave Belasco last ni^ht saying that
having won bis case against Mrs. Carter's
guardian he would be on this coast within
three weeks. During hi 3 visit here he
states that he will deliver lectures before
the actors of this City and the theatrical
students.

"Lows' usually first appear on me Washington

SEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NFW YORK. N. V.. June 24.â American Pugar
â¢was traded in to the extent of nearly 150,000
shares to-day, and the fluctuations in this specialty
completely overshadowed operations in the rail
way and miscellaneous list- The stock opened
slightly lower, but soon advanced to 116% on
purchases to cover short contracts, but a break to
ll:-P... quickly followed. Stock hela on slender
margins was thrown overboard, and for a time the
market, so far as Sugar was concerned, was de
moralized. No new reasons were Riven for the
break, and, in fact, none were needed. The street
has settled down to the opinion that the turn on
the long side of this specialty has been carried
through successfully, and that in the immediate
future, at least, the stock will luck the support of
influential parties.-
The break led to buying for a turn and a rally to
11 4(n.l 153 : g followed. Tobacco and General Elec
tric were weak for a time, the former on state
ments that the directors had decided to postpone
ac. lon on the dividend. The reports that a num
ber of Important orders recently placed with the
iiwii-ral Electric Company hadjbeen canceled re
ceived little credit. The railway list cut away
.from the industrials and in the late trading was
decidedly strong. In the last hour the traders
who are still in con troll began to cover and as a
result the best pries of the day were reached in
the cases of the grangers and the internationals.
I The market dosed strong in tone. Net changes
show gains of Vs@l per cent. Sugar lost 1 per
cent. The total sales were 669,000 shares.
- Bonds were quiet and higher. The sales footed
up $695,000. Kansas and Texas seconls rose 1
to 58%: Kansas and Eastern lives, 1 to 93; St.
Louis and San Francisco second sixes, class C, 1

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111, June 24.â Wheat continued
Inactive to-day. The trading showed a prominent
absence of outside interest, the scalpers and local
small fry keeping the market from falling into
utter lifelessness. The feeling was irregular, but
fluctuations were not important or broad and the
changes represented the sentiment controlling the
local crowd. The fact that new wheat is grading
well occasions some comment at the present time,
as it augurs favorably for the quality of the winter
wheat crop. Liverpool cables were quiet and V4^
lower.
Receipts In the Northwest were 371 cars, against
509 last Wednesday, and 195 a year azo Chicago
received 49 cars and inspected out 19,600 bushels.
Paris closing cables were 10 centimes lower to 10
centimes higher for flour, and unchanged for
wheat. Antwerp was unchanged, and Berlin un
changed to Vi mark lower. Export clearances
were light at 159.000 bushels. September wheat
opened from 575,g@57V2C, sold between 67% c and
571 4c closing at i-73/ B @S7V3C, Vi@Â¥Â»c under yes
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 17
cars.
CORNâ moderate and active occasionally,
but at times was so dull as scarcely to constitute a
market. From want of any direct influence prices
accepted the action of wheat as a guide, to that
price changes were somewhat irregular and in
definite. Receipts were 287 cars and 172,635
bushels were taken from store. Liverpool cables
were quiet and easy. Export clearances amounted
to 285,961 bushels. September corn opened at
28% c, sold between HBS/ 8 c and @-9c, closing
at tne Insideâ Vi@% under yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow, 400 cars.
OATSâ Were steady during the morning, though
dull and uninteresting as to tra c. The lack of
business permitted prices to maintain a certain
degree of firmness, but there was nothing particu
larly new or encouraging in the situation. Re
ceipts of 169 cars were something below the num
ber expected. Withdrawals from store were 42,
--428 bushels. Export clearances amounted to 89,
-573 bushels. Weakness, due to liquidating sales,
developed during the last hour, prici s suffering :n
consequence. September closed Vi@%<? lower.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 290 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 79c: July, 79c; Sep
tember, 80!,4c; December, 82Vic bid. Receipts
were 10 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The demand for product this
morning was unusually good and sellers were as
sisted in obtaining belter prices by the apparent
urgency and determination of buyers. 'I he hog
market was irregular in tone, some grades being
strong whilst others were weak. September pork
closed 10c higher. September lard 2>/2 c higher and
September ribs a shade higher.

supply of cattle on sale to-day was large. Choice
lots were firm, however, out other kinds moved
slowly and were weak. Receipts of hogs were
weak. The demand was good and the feeling, ex

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
ORCHARD FRUITSâ
The river boat was late and prices ranged lower
in consequence, as will be seen. Fancy Apricots In
bulk brought $25 and poor went as low as $15.
The majority brought $20@22 50. Choice Peaches
were firm. Cnerries are In less demand, as the
season is about over.
Commission merchants are pointing to the fact
that recent sales of fresh fruit on the Eastern
markets have netted the California grower less
than the San Francisco pr.ces. This is notably the
case with Cherries, Apricots and Plums.

DRIED FRUITSâ
Prospects for Dried Fruit: this fall are more
cheering. The Government agricultural reports
announce a serious deficiency in the Apple yield of
the country, owing to the heavy wind aud rain
storms, to unusual ravages of the canker-worm
and other Insect pests, and to the enormous crop
last year, which overstrained the trees. The per
centage this year is only 71, and all parts of the
United States report Apples dropping badly. Now,
the Drl d Fruit market of the Eastern States is
regulated Dy me price of Apples, and as they prom
ise to be a diminished crop this year the outlook
therefore is tor good prices later on. Ihe chief
cause of the low prices for Dried Fruit last year
was the immense crop of Apples, which will not
occur this year.
Peaches are also rather under 1895, being 70%,
against 73% last year.

A SURPRISE LOOKED FOR.
Mayer Davie's New Appointee Changes
the Complexion of the
Beard.
Oakland Offick Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 2i. )
The difficulty regarding the appoint
ment of successors on the Board of Health
to those members whose terms have ex
pired is yet unsettled. Mayor Davie stated
to-day that Drs. R. H. Chamberlain and A.
E. Small have accepted the positions
made vacant by the retirement of Drs.
Akerly and Fisher.
The terms of the retiring members ex
pired on the first Monday in this month,
but although several prominent physi
cians have been offered the vacancies,
none have accepted till to-day.
The chief difficulty in the way of their
acceptance was the commonly repeated
story that no one could be appointed wno
would not do the Mayor's biddine in the
matter of dispensing the patronage.
In the gift of tbe board are the offices of
Health Officer, secretary, Sanitary In
spector and Assistant Sanitary Inspector.
Nearly two years ago the Mayor named
two members of the board and it was gen
erally understood there would be many
changes. Secretary Schafer was removed
for a short period, about two weeks, but
the Mayor's lady appointee, Dr. Sareh
Brmey, who is now president of the board,
reconsidered her action and subsequently
voted to reinstate Schafer.
Mayor Davie's appointments were an
innovation, inaÃiuach as it was the first
time that representation was given to the
homeopathic school. It created a lot of
excitement and there was always more or
less friction between the two schools. The
East year has been one during which there j
as been iittle active work for tne Board j
of Health, and peace has prevailed.
When the terms of two members ex- j
pired, two weeks ago, the Mayor was in a j
position to give either school control of â 
the board by his new appointees. Several i
doctors stated that they had been offered I
the vacan^es, but the professional jeal- j
ousies of the two schools forced them to j
decline. Every possible inducement not j
to accept, was put forth by the repeated !
statements that the members would be but
tne mouthpieces of the Mayor.
The two new appointees have taken the j
board out of the power of the regular j
school, as both Drs. Chamberlain and j
Small are homeopaths. This makes the i
coaipiexioa of the board three to two.
Dr. Saiah I. thuey and Dr. Beckwitn are
of the old school, while Dr. Larkey is a
homeopath.
At the next meeting there is likely to
be a surprise. It is rumored tbat the
three homeopaths will demand the presi
dency, ana that the newly elected lady pres- j
ident will have a short reign in the chair. |
The old school dares the homeopaths t >
tlo such an ungallant action as to unseat a
lady, and the situation is one of interest.
Should any arrangement have been
inane prior to their appointment, all the
patronage may be redistributed. The
Mayor denies that he has been around
offering the places to doctors and requir
ing obedience as the price of the honor.
He says the various reports have been cir
culated by his political enemies for the
purpose of annoying him.
ENCINAL YACHT CLUB,
The Fawn Will Race the
Catherine Ahout the Middle
of August.
The Commodore's First Yacht Is to
Carry " The Call " Across the
Bay in Future.
ALAMEDA. Cal., June 24.â The boat- i
owners of the Encinal Yacht Club met last j
night to further consider the challenge i
sent by Captain Sutherland of the San ;
Francisco Yacht Club for the perpetual ;
trophy at present reposing in the Encinal j
clubhouse.
It was decided to pit James Tyson's
Fawn against the captain's Catherine, and
Commodore Leonard, Secretary Holt and
Captain Hanley were appointed the com- j
mittee to prepare her for the race.
According to the articles of agreement
the race must be sailed within sixty days
after the acceptance of the challenge.
This will make the day of the race about
August 14.
The course will be the one known as the
outer Encinal course. The start is from
the narrow-gauge mole, around Blossom
Rock, thence to Hunters Point, returning
via Mission Rock to the starting point.
Ti.e distance covered will be about fifteen i
miles.
Commodore Leonard says the Encinal
Club is in a more nourishing condition j
than ever it was. It has a membership oi
120, each member owning a share of stock
worth $35. Only rive more shares have to
be allotted, and when these are taken the
limit of membership, according to the ar- \
tides of incorporation, will have been ;
reached.
When Commodore Leonard built El I
Sueno on his own lines and plans and :
found her to be such a "hummer," be had !
no further use for the first fruits of his >,
eMftT in yacht-building, Little Annie, j
Mr. Franklin purchased ncr and he is now
patting power into her, so that she may j
carry The Call across the bay to the |
Broadway wtiurf belore any of the ferry
boats are running in the mornings.

GOOD YEAR'S WORK.
Marked Growth in the Business of
the Local Fost-
Office.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 24.â "The postal
business of this city for the fiscal year end
ing July 30 will reach a total of over $99,
--500," said Postmaster White to-day.
"This, with an aggregate of over $275,000
for money orders issued, foreign and do
mestic, and about $350,000 paid in the ag
gregate is not a bad showing for a city
whose population is mostly in business
in an adjoining city. The expenses of the
office are about $50,000 a year, so, you see,
we turn a neat balance over to the Gov
ernment."
The postal system of Oakland is divided
between the main office, two stations, two
substations and a number of postal agen
cies. At present there are thirty carriers,
five substitute carriers, eignteen clerks
(including those in charge of stations and
substations) and four special delivery
messengers. The clerks are divided as
follows: Stations, two; substations, two;
mailing department, three; money order,
two; register, two; distribution, two; di
rectory, two; general delivery, one;
stamp, one; relief, one. With the great
amount of mail and the frequent arrivals
and departures of mails from 5:30 a. m.
until 12 midnight, this force is not con
sidered sufficient lor the rapid handling of
the mails. There is nearly twelve tons of
second-class matter alone sent out of the
office every month in the year.
SATISFACTION IN DEATH,
A Shooting in the Home of Colored
People on Jefferson
Street.
A Longstanding Quairel Between
Two Women Ends in a
Tragedy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 24. f
Amanda Calloway went to revenge an
I insult at the house of an acquaintance,
! and her satisfaction will probably be
death, for she was shot.
The shooting was done at the house 657
Jefferson street, where Pleasant Hill, a
colored flagman, resided with Mary Wag
ner. From the stories of the parties, who
: are all colored, there has been bad blood
between the women for a long time.
Mary Wagner is credited with making
\ remarks about the reputation of Mrs.
! Calloway, who is the mother of seveial
j children.
This evening about 7 o'clock Mrs. Cal
| loway went to the house where Mary
i Waener lives as housekeeper to Pleasant
| Hill. She made known the object of her
I visit and the women were soon quarreling
| violently.
Mary Wagner finally ran and obtained a
j gun and quickly fired three snots, which
entered the arm, breast and hip of her
visitor. Est her Mings and Hill were wit
i nesses to the shooting, but it was done too
! quickly for them to interiere.
The victim was taken to the Receiving
j Hospital, and the doctors at once stated
that it was impossible for her to live.
W.ileon the operating table Mrs. Cal
lowav made a dying statement to Detec
tive Snorey. She said: "I believe I will
die. Mary Wagner shot me three times
because s:ie said my husband was not the
| father of my children. It was ail done
I without provocation."
Pleasant Hill says that the two women
were quarreling and that Mrs. Calloway
told Mary Wagner she knew Bhe had a
eun and that she would make her swallow
it. After a struggle for the gun the shots
were fired and Mrs. CaJloway fell.
Mary Wagner was taken to the City
Hail to be held pending developments.
DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES.
Figures Being Turned In to Auditor
snow Slowly.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 24.â The es
timates from the various departments for
j their needs for the ensuing year are com-
I ing in to Auditor Snow slowly, but as it is
' yet early he will have plenty of time to
consider them.
The City Attorney, in his estimate, has
an item for $6000 to cover judgments and
costs of suits against the city. The City
Wharfinger wants $2500 put in for dredg
ing about the docks. The Chief of Police
believes he should be allowed extra patrol
men, which, together with the other ex.-
I pense?, foot up to $72,000, as against
I $72,890 83 used in 1894-'J>.
Street Superintendent Miller has es
â¢ timated $50,000 for the city's share of the
I expense for the proposed permanent high
; way through East Oakland. He has also
| estimated that it will require $10,000 to
! repair the Twelfth-street dam and $10,000
'to clean the streets. His total estimates,
! exclusive of the above improvements, foot
â  up to $86,000, as against $87,536 97 used ia
1894-95.

answer to that element who, having noth
ing to lose, are forever saying that Oak
land is making but little progress.
Although issued in the Centennial year,
the book reads like an ancient history, and,
were the facts not indisputable, thousands
would doubt them.
The Centennial year seems but a brief
instance in the past, but the record of im
provements and values of twenty years
presents a remarkable contrast to the con
ditions of to-day.
Mayor Davie has a copy of the book and
this afternoon he was looking from the
steps of the City Hall down fourteenth
street toward the lake and trying to con
vince himself that the picture of the same
spot in 1876 was not false. Dr. E. H.
Pardee was elected Mayor in that year
and it was while he was in office that the
railroad company laid the foundation for
the powerful opposition that may be said j
to have culminated in the warlike events
that marked the career of Dr. G. C. Pardee
as Mayor.
Tlie'father saw the beginning of what it
is hoped the son saw the end â the restora
tion of the water front. There was a treat
battle for a steam railroad out Market
street to the foothills. The line would

[A comparison of the two views ia typical of the city's progress In twenty years. 1
have been run in connection with a ferry
from the foot of Market street to Ban
Francisco. Daring the struggle for the
franchise the Southern Pacific Company
had a bill slyly passed through the Legis
lature prohibiting the passage of any new
railroad through the town "excepting by
the unanimous consent of the City Coun
cil. A great storm was raised, and Dr.
Pardee Sr., who is still enjoying fair
health, presided at an indignation meet
ing, the result of which was that the bill
was vetoed by thÂ« Governor. The fran
chise was never granted, and in that re
spect the railroad won the day, but they
laid the foundation for interminable trou
ble and opposition, which exists to this
day.
One of the most lamentable personal
events that ever occurred in Oakland was
the suicide in the Centennial year of Ben
jamin F. Ferris by drowning" in the Sac
ramento River, about 4 o'clock on the
morning of the 20th of May. He had taken
passage in the steamer Amador at San
Francisco the previous afternoon, and
when the boat was near Sacramento, in
the vicinity of what is known as the
Chickory ranch, he threw himself over
board and was drowned. His remains
were found in due course and conveyed to
Oakland. Deceased was Mayor of tne city
in 1865, and was Justice of the Peace lor
several years. He was frequently a mem
ber of the City Council, and was one of the
founders and the first president of the
First National Gold Bank of Oakland.
The cause of the rash act was temporary
insanity, caused by financial embarrass
ment.
The great event of interest in the month
' of June was the wonderful trip of the
lightning train, chartered by the New
York theatrical managers, Messrs. Jarrett
& Palmer, to convey their company, with
i Lawrence Barrett as star, from New York
to San Francisco in the shortest possible
time. The train started from Jersey City,
opposite New York, at 1 o'clock on Taurs
day morning, the Ist of June, and crossed
Broadway, Oakland, twenty-two minutes
past 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 4th
day of June. The actual time occupied in
making this unprecentedtrip between Jer
sey City and Oakland wharf was 83 hours
39 minutes and 16 seconds. People were
out, lining the front streets of the city,
from early morning, looking out for the
fast train, which dashed through Oakland
at the rate of fifty miles an hour. Cheer
after cheer greeted it at every station in
Alameda County. This unprecedented
journey was looked upon as the greatest
railroad feat ever performed.
It was just twenty years ago that the
Eighth-street bridge was built, which is
the cause of so much contention and which
is at present barricaded.
The most marked difference is every
where visible in the buildings that have
been erected in the business portion of
the city and the busy suburbs that have
grown up all around. All the large busi
ness blocks west of Broadway have been
built since then, and the districts in North
and East Oakland. The city nas almost
trebled in size during the past twenty
years in area and doubled in population.
In 1876 Joe Hilton assessed the whole
city at $22,000,000. This year Assessor
Snow's assessment is $46,000,000. The pop
ulation in the Centennial year was 35,910.
Now it is estimated at between 75,000 and
80.000.
In the former year one of the big events
' was the inauguration of a conple of horse
'< car lines. Now t ere is not a city in the
I Union with a more complete system of
electric roads tban Oakland. They run out
to the foothills in several direction?; a belt
I sweeps through Oakland and Alameda;
i line 3 run to West < >akland on three differ
! ent streets; to East Oakland on three
routes, one of which goes clear through to
Haywards.
In 1876 the tax rate wr.s $1 30; this year
itissl.
"I don't think the people have anything
to be ashamed of in the last twenty-year?,"
I said the Mayor. "Considering tho proxim
i ity to and competition from San Francisco
| the progress has been wonderful. In the
| Centennial year, which does not seem very
I far back, Oakland was contented to play
second fiddle to San Francisco in every
thing. Now that idea is completely dis
missed, and there ia more pride among
Oaklanders, generally, than is found in
j most cities. There are others â but they
J cut no figure in this stoay."

the community. It was turned in by
Special Watchman Hitchcock, who saw
the flames while in the vicinity of i'abiola
Hospital. The fire, started in a vacant
| house formerly occupied by a colored
family named" Moore and spread to the
adjoining house, occupied by Patrick
Quinn. The latter saved most of his fur
i mture. The fire is supposed to have been
of incendiary origin.

BERKELEY, Cal., June 24.â One of the
most notable weddings which has taken
place in Berkeley for many months was
held this evening at the residence of
Charles T. Blake, on Bancroft way, his
only daughter, Miss Eliza Seely Blake and
Sherman Day Thacher Deing the con
tracting parties. President Martin Kel
logg of the State University officiated,
in the presence of over 100 invited guests.
Miss Ruth Williams of San Francisco
acted as maid of honor, and William L.
Thacher of New York, a brother of the
groom, served as best man.
The bride, who is one of Berkeley's
fairest belles, was dressed in a costly
white-corded silk gown â the wedding
dress of her motherâ with a full -skirt
train and a corsage of mousseline de soie,
decollete. She carried in her hands a
bouquet of white roses, while the brides
maid carried white roses and maidenhair.
The home of the bride was beautifully
decorated with pink sweet peas â the wed
ding flower. On the bridal table, which
was decorated with pink ribbon, sat a
huge vase filled with the most fragrant of
the wedding flowers.

repaired to the home of Anson S. Blake,
which adjoins the residence of the bride,
where the wedding breakfast was served.

Law College in the class of '86, while the
bride graduated from the State University
in '95.

in a few days to spend a two months'
honeymoon.
Salting the Roads.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 24.â The State
Bureau of Highways has been experiment
ing at Berkeley in sprinkling the roads
with salt.
The theory of the experimenters was
that salt absorbs moisture from the air,
and, therefore, keeps the roadways damp,
and the experiments were with the view
to determining what grade of salt is the
cheapest and most lasting.
With the assistance of the department
of chemistry at, tho State University,
under Professor W. B. Rising, a number
of experiments were made, and the result
of the trials of the several different kinds
of salt has been embodied in a report to
Governor Budd.

More Japanese Students.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 24.â Reports
have reached Berkeley that several Japa
nese will be sent to this country by their
Government to enter the State University
in the class of 1900. There are at the pres
ent time about fifteen Japanese attending
the university, the first one ever graduat
ing from it having taken his degree with
the class of '95. A second one graduated
last May.
The four who are to enter in the fall
will receive instruction which will spe
cially fit them for service in the Japanese
Government.

WANTED FOR FORGERY.
Meyer Cohen, Who Failed to Appear
at His Wedding, Is Now a
Fugitive.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 24.â Julius Abra
hamson of this city has sworn to a war
rant charging Meyer Cohen, the ex-news
paper man and baseball enthusiast, with
forcery to-day. According to the story
told by Abrahamson it was about two
weeks ago that Cohen presented him with
a check on a San Jose bank for $37 50
signed "Asha Greenberg" of San Jose, his
prospective father-in-law.
It was after banking hours and it was
cashed for accommodation.
The check was placed in the bank for
collection, and several days later word
was received that it was a clumsy forsrery.
'Abrahamson sent Cohen word to settle at
once or he would have him arrested.
Within a few hours after the receipt of
this warning Cohen had left town. It has
been learned that Cohen had made several
attempts to get larger checks cashed
about the City Hall, where he was well
known. It Is said here that his Eastern
record is rather against him and that he
only escaped prosecution there owing to
the* interested parties desiring to keep
from publicity their names.
FOUND A BODY.
The Bemalm of Frederick Schelfler
Discovered by Tramps.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 24. âCoroner
Baldwin was notified this morning that
three tramps had found the remains of an
unknown man in the bushes in the vicin
ity of Flemings Point, beyond West Berk
eley. It was stated that the features were
unrecognizable, as the man had appar- j
ently been dead for some time.
When the remains were brought to the \
Morgue they were identified as those of
Frederick Scheifier, a butcher, formerly
an employe of Fred Becker. He was last !
seen by friends Friday, and as he had j
Deen drinking heavily it is believed he
committed suicide, as he often declared
he would. A partially filled wine bottle
was found at his side.
Coffee WÂ«s Poisonous.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 24.â Several
members of the jury who tried the Root
gold brick case have been sick since they
were discharged last Saturday night, and
they attribute their trouble to a meal they
ate in the iury-room.
Juror Hewlett, one of those affected,
explained the matter to-day thus: "You
Know," he said, "if coffee is allowed to
stand in a copoer vessel for any length of
time it becomes poisonous, if the tin
plating is worn off the copper, and it is
just possible that this caused the trouble.
But whatever tbe cause, the pain was
something frightful, and I for one never
wish to pass through such an experience
again."

Tramps Identified as the Assail
ants of Helpless Chi
nese.
Arrested as Vagrants, Their Soiled
Clothes Aroused Well-Founded
Suspicions.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 24. j
Three would-be murderers were arrested
by chance this afternoon. They are Jo
seph Williams, Charlie Carson and
Thomas Keenan, and they will be booked
for a cowardly assault upon three un
protected Chinese last Sunday, and which
may yet prove to be murder.
Constable Gaiiett of Kan Leandro ar
rested a batch of fa've tramps yesterday
and took them before Justice Quinn this
morning. They were sentenced to ten
days for vagrancy and were brought to the
County Jail to-day. As they were being
booked some blood was discovered upon
their clothes, and this aroused a suspicion
that they might be the men who essaulted
the Chinamen last Sunday midnight in
the lonely shanty by Lake Merritt.
The city police were notified and the
tramps were taken before the Cuinese,
who are still seriously sick in tiie Chinese
quarter.
The Chinamen were quite positive in
their identification and picked out the
three guilty ones without any hesitation.
There will probably be many people at
the jail to-morrow to see the prisoners, as
there has been a series of robberies com
mitted on the county road during the past
month and it is believed that the ang is
that now under arrest. Joe Dieves 1 house
was robbed Sunday night, and visits have
also been made at Mose Gunst's house,
and a few days ago the Villa Hotel at
Haywards was systematically looted.
These men have been doing the neighbor
hood for some time, and some of them
have been imprisoned lor vagrancy quite
recently.

TWO STARTLING REVELATIONS IN THE CRAVEN-FAIR LITIGATION
Part of the Mystery of
the Deeds Cleared
Away.
WHY HELD IN SECRET
Their Recording Designed as a
Checkmate by Mrs. Craven's
Attorneys.
WERE IN FEAR OF TREACHERY
Details of the Compact Between the
Fair Children and the School
Principal.
Why did Mrs. Nettie R. Craven place on
record at this particular time the two deeds
to $1,250,000 worth of property formerly
owned by Senator James Q. Fairf
In the answer to this lies a story as ro
mantic and sensational as anything ever
evolved from brain of poet or writer of
fiction.
This is one of the questions that has
been repeatedly asked since that eventful
day last week when the documents were
so cautiously, mysteriously and unexpect
edly made known to the world at large.
Up to now this apparently simple, in
significant and inoffensive interrogatory
has remained unanswered.
On the part of Mrs. Craven and her at
torneys the replies have persistently been
of an evasive character.
On the part of the attorneys of the Fair
children, who are now all arrayed against
Mrs. Craven, Marc Levingston and the
pencil will of September 24, 1894, it has
been charged that Mrs. Craven's legal rep
resentatives had tbe papers recorded at
this time because of the illness or absence
of most of the attorneys of the heirs from
the City. This gauzy explanation, how
ever, carried little weight with the know
ing ones, as they knew no advantage could
accrue from such % move, even were every
one of the legatees' counsel away or in
capacitated.
Tnis is the true explanation: The Fair
children, through their attorneys, were
endeavoring to give Mrs. Craven the
"doubl-ecross." Such is the charge made
by an intimate of that lady. And Mrs.
Craven filed those deeds as a checkmate.
ilrs. Craven's entrance into the great
Fair will drama dates from the sensational
introduction into that realistic play of
what is known as the pencil will, of which
she declared she had been made custodian.
That instrument bore date of September
24, 1894, having been executed apparently
three days later than the so-called trust
will, which bore date of September 21, 1894.
At the time tbe pencil will was produced
it was eagerly welcomed by Charles L. Fair,
Mrs. Oelrichs acti Miss Virginia Fair, and
its validity ana genuineness loudly pro
claimed by them and their attorneys. The
trust deed was objectionable owing to the
trust clause, which placed the estate and
all its properties under the control of the
executors, leaving only the income at the
free and unrestricted disposal of the heirs.
When Mrs. Craven produced the will it
is stated that she also informed the Fair
children, of course through their attor
neys, of deeds to certain of Fair's real
estate and other valuable documents that
were in her possesion. The heirs were at
that time more concerned about the will
than any other matter, and Mrs. Craven
was finally induced to maKe the journey
to New York herself and bring back tbe
pencil will which she had sent East, as
she stated, for better security.
During Mrs. Craven's absence, so the
story goes, there was a conference be
tween Stephen Roberts, the confidential
business adviser of Mrs. Craven, and
George R. Williams, her attorney, on one
side and all the attorneys representing
the three Fair children on the other. It
was at this meeting that what is being re
ferred to as the Dey contract was agreed
upon and consummated.
This document bears date of March 15,
1895. It is a unique paper and throws a
strong light on recent developments. It
was drawn in the office of Reuben H.
Lloyd. By mutual consent at this meet
ing Richard V. Dey, the executor and ad
ministrator of the estate of Mrs. Theresa
Fair, is made judge, jury and arbitrator of
the interests at issue between Mrs. Craven
and the Fair children.
In the same document Mr. Dey is au
thorized by the Fair children to pay Mrs.
Craven a sum not exceeding $500,000 on
condition that the pencil will is admitted
to probate and that she agrees to sign a
quitclaim to any and all property of the
Fair estate, wherever located and of what
ever character. So broad is the latter
stipulation that it would, so it is claimed,
cover any right* to property which might
accrue to Mrs. Craven by reason of her
proving to be the widow of the deceased
millionaire, either by marriage contract or
otherwise, for while none of the parties
interested have admitted the existence of
a marriage contract, it is admitted that the
Fair children greatly feared that such a
document might be produced.
The value of Mrs. Craven's claims and
the amount to be paid in settlement of
them was left entirely to the judgment
and generosity of Mr. Dey. in whom all
parties had and still have the fullest con
fidence.
No copies were made of this instrument,
as it was desired by everyone interested to
maintain the strictest secrecy regarding

the whole transaction. Its custody was in
trusted to Mr. Dey, who placed it under
seal in the vaults of the Union Trust Safe
Deposit, where it now lies. It has not
since been opened, and will not be exposed
to the view of any person until to-night,
when it will be opened only on the order
and in the presence of Judge Slack.
As a further guarantee of good faith the
present disputed property, on the south
west corner of Sansome and Pine streets,
was deeded by tho Fair children to Mr.
Dey as security for the payment of the
$500,000 to Mrs. Craven.
This briefly is the history of the Dey-
Fair-Craven compromise contract.
Those representing Mrs. Craven say it
is claimed by the Fair attorneys that the
$500,000 con tract was entered into by the
Fair children in order to secure possession
of tne pencil will. This claim, it is as
serted, is without foundation in fact, as
the contract was made during Mrs.
Craven's absence and without her knowl
edge. It is further pointed out that the
contract was signed on March 15, which
fell on Friday, and that the will did not
reach this City till the next day, Saturday,
March 16, and was not offered for probate
until Monday, the 18th of March.
For some time after this confederation
between the Fair children and Mrs.
Craven against the trust will and tee trus
tees under that instrument, everything
moved smoothly apd harmoniously so far
as the pencil will allies were concerned,
and every effort was directed by them to se
cure the probating of the holographic tes
tament of September 24.
Then came the decision of Judge Slack
declaring invalid the trust clause of the
will of September 21. Thereafter, gradu
ally and slowly, came apparently the con
viction to the minds of the allies of Mrs.
Craven that the pencil will was, perhaps,
after all neither what they desired nor
genuine and their changed mental atti-
MRS. ELIZABETH HASKINS.
tude soon became manifest to Mrs.
Craven, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Williams.
The reason for this the latter claim to see
in two important facts which will militate
against the Fair children should the
emasculated trust will be accepted for pro
bate.
Under the trust will the property is
clearly and unmistakably apportioned be
tween Charles L. Fair, Mrs. Theresa A.
Oelrichs and Miss Virginia Fair, giving
each a third interest. In the pencil will
appears this provision: "All the rest of
my estate, properties of whatsoever kind,
I bequeath to my three children, Theresa
A. Oelrichs, Charles L. Fair and Virginia
Fair, share and share alike, and to their
children forever."
It is this clause, it is said, which trou
bles the meditations of the Fair children
and has weaned them from Mrs. Craven
and the will of which she was custodian.
They see in its ambiguous wording a pos
sibility that it may be interpreted to mean
that Mrs. Oelrichs' boy is to be an equal
beneficiary with his mother and his aunt
and uncle, leaving but one-quarter of the
estate for Charles L. Fair and the same
portion for Virginia Fair and Mrs. Oel
richs, respectively, instead of one-third, as
under the trust will.
Another reason for the recent repudia
tion of the pencil will is that its admis
sion to probate will necessitate the pay
ment of $500,000 to Mrs. Craven.
It was the apparent breach of faith on
the part of the Fair children in upholding j
the amended trust will that caused tbe |
two gift deeds to be recorded by the at
torneys of Mrs. Craven. They considered
that the gage of battle had been thrown
down by the former friends of Mrs.
Craven and they signified their accept
ance of tbe challenge by firing their first
gun on Friday last.
Whether the great legal war will be
fought out in the courts or be settled by
another compromise are matters that are |
being much speculated upon.
Comment has been excited by the agree
ment of Mrs. Craven to accept $500,000 in
full of all her claims on the Fair estate,
which, even by the showing she has al- !
ready made, amount to $1,250,000. This
is explained by her counsel that she was
satisfied wit i the less amount, as its ac
ceptance would avoid any further noto
riety on her part.
MORE MONEY NEEDED.

money is needed to make the celebration i

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 1896.
Mrs. James Haskins Tells
How the Pencil Will
Was Written.
FAIR WAS QUITE WELL.
It Was Done in Mrs. Craven's
Room at 2007 Califor
nia Street.
THEY THREE WERE PRESENT.
Mrs. Craven brought the Senator a
Glass of Whisky While
He Wrote.
Mrs. James Haskins, witness to the
Fair will of the 24th, the pencil will, with
out really consenting to do so told to The
Call last evening the story of how that
will was drawn by Mr. Fair iv her
presence.
Everything relating to the pencil will
except the bald fact of its existence and
that it purported to be the genuine and
last will and testament of James G. Fair
has hitherto been a mystery. Everybody
who had knowledge â and there were only
two, Mrs. Craven and Mrs. Haskins â
sealed their lips, putting the question off
with the promise that "at the proper time"
they would speak. Even the place where
the writing was done was kept secret.
Mrs. Haskins lifted the veil to the ex
tent that it is in her power to do so â so she
says.
The will was drawn in Mrs. Craven's
room, at 2007 California street, says Mrs.
Haskins. It was written in a large blank
book by Mr. Fair in the presence of Mrs.
Craven and Mrs. Haskins, Mrs. Haskins
not being in the room all the time. The
room was very warm and Mrs. Haskins
became ill and retired to another apart
ment for a while, but returned before the
writing was completed.
"The will is all right," said Mrs. Has
kins decisively. "When the time comes
for me to tell about it on the witness
stand I will do so. I hope it will never be
necessary, but if it is I will tell the truth.-
That visit to Mrs. Craven's that day has
brought upon me a sea of trouble, but
there is nothing for it but to continue to
the end. It has brought upon me great
financial loss and directed unwarranted
scandal against my good name, but I can
only tell the truth. The success of the
will or the proponents or the heirs under
the will is nothing to me.
"There is not a cent in it for me one way
or another, but, as I say, the charges and
litigation growing out of it have cost me
considerable money. The lawyers for the
pencil will have promised me that all this
will be returned and that I will be prop
erly recompensed. .
"As this will is genuine and will be pro
bated, I expect to get that, but nothing
can recompense me for the trouble that it
has brought upon me. lam not the same
woman since."
Little by little in this way Mrs. Haskins
THE PROPERTY AT PINE AND SANSOME STREETS.
told the story of the will so far as she
knew it. It is an interesting story and
should be told in the sequence of its inci
dents rather than in the fragmentary
way of her telling it. To begin with, Mrs.
Haskins denies that tnere is any estrange
ment between herself and Mrs. Craven, or
at least denies any knowledge of why
there should be any or that she bears Mrs.
Craven any ill will.
"Mrs. Craven left my house some
months ago, since which time she has
called upon me but once." she said. "I do
not know that she has anything against me.
Her daughter has called upon me twice.
Perhaps the hill is too steep for her to
climb. That is the reason she gave for
moving -that she wanted to get nearer her
school. Her health is not good."
Then she approached the story of the
will.
"It is wrong to suppose the will was
drawn in this house. Mr. Fair was
never here I have known Mr. Fair
for over thirty years, but was never
on more than speaking terms with him.
Mrs. Craven and I have been friends for
many years, and I knew that she thought
a ereat deal of Mr. Fair.
"So far as they're having been married
I know nothing. Mrs. Craven was living
in my house when the statement wa3
made in the newspapers that there was a
marriage contract between them. I
laughed about it to her, and she only
said 'You see lots of queer things in the
newspapers.'
"How did I come to be present at the
time Mr. Fair made his will? Well, I had
had a dress delivered to me by my dress
maker, who lives on California street.
The bill was sent with it. and on the
morning of September 24, 1894, I went out
for the purpose of paying this bill. I took
the occasion to go out and call upon Mrs.
Craven at her school on Mission street,
near Fifteenth. She was not there.
"One of the little boys told me she was
sick at her home. I went to my dress
maker's, paid my bill, and then went to
where Mrs. Craven was living at 2007 Cali
fornia street. I found her there. She was
not confined to bed, but was in her room.
Mr. Fair was with her. There was a
Chinaman servant there also. Mr. Fair
was engaged in writing his will. He was
writing with a lead pencil in a large blank
book. The book belonged to Mrs. Craven.
"Yes; I knew what he was doing. I
cannot say that I was surprised at it. If
you ask me for pen and ink and saw fit to
write an important document here in my
presence I cannot say that I would think
it at all remarkable.
"I was not feeling well, tbe room was
closa and hot and I went out for a while,
but returned before the writing was com
plete.
"I cannot say whether Mr. Fair was in
good health or not. He seemed to me to
be. He had a glass of whisky while
writing. Mrs. Craven got it for him.
"I remained ail the afternoon â did not
come away until after dinner. We had
dinner about 8 o'clock. Mr. Fair did not
stay for dinner.
"I considered that visit that afternoon
one of the most unfortunate events of my
life â the fact that I happened to be pres
ent at the writing of the will of James G.
Fair. It has brought upon me nothing
but trouble. I had a dream a short time
before it â a most remarkable dreamâ that
remains fixed in my memory. It was
portentous of evil, and evil has come.
"Well, shortly after my husband's death
Mrs. Craven asked me if she might not
come here to live, and I made ar
rangements for her. After Mr. Fair's
death she went to* New York, you remem
ber, and when the lawyers and heirs were
quarreling about the will that had been
produced by the trustees, and just about
the time the sensation about its havine
been stolen from the clerk of the county's
office was made known she heard about
it there and sent on this will that was left
with her to be presented for probate.
"There was a little corner of one of the
sheets of paper torn out. The lawyers for
Mr. Fair's children were very anxious to
secure every possible proof of the genuine
ness of this will. They visited this house
in a body to have me give out what I
could. There was Mr. Reuben Lloyd and
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Heggertv and Mr.
Wheeler, alt here together one day.
"They had noticed that little torn cor
ner apd they were eager to get the piece of
paper to fit to it. They said they were
afraid that the trustees or somebody would
introduce some other will or would try to
break this one down. They asked me to
search for the book that the sheets of
paper had been torn out of. I did so for
the most part of two days, searching all
over the house. I remembered that Mrs.
Craven had had a quantity of books and
papers in her room wnen she went away
and that I had taken upstairs. 1 went up
there and found the book and the lawyers
were here when I brought it down.
We went through it and discov
ered where the leaves had been
torn out and there, fast to the book, was
the little ragged corner of the paper that
was missing from the will. I never saw
anybody more pleased about anything
than were those lawyers. Mr. Lloyd was
as pleased as a baby with a new toy. He
held that bit of paper as though it was
something good to eat.
"And now," continued Mrs. Haskins,
"they are all against this will. They were
not against it, however, at any time until
they broke the trust in the earlier will.
They could not have been against it now
if the trust had not been broken. But the
will is all right. It was written by Jamea
G. Fair in my presence."
With regard to the deeds, Mrs. Haskins
intimated that, if compelled to go on the
stand, she might throw some light upon
them, but for the time being she would
say nothing. She had made ud her mind
to say nothing about t!ie matter at all, she
said, and would stand to it.
BRITTAIN AS A SCORCHER.
Burning Words Directed at the At
torneys of the Fair
Children.
Mrs. Craven was not disposed to f do
much talking in reference to the matter in
which she is now th.c most conspicuous
figure, but she had this to say regarding
the latest development â the acknowledged
existence of the compromise contract:
"I have no copy of the compromise
agreements, which I understand is held
by Mr. Dey, nor have I ever seen the orig
inal. My attorneys have demanded that
it be brought into court and Mr. Dey has
said that we should have it. I expect to
see it Thursday night for the first time.
"I have heard about its contents, bat
what they are I cannot say at this time."
F. S. Brittain, who is acting as the legal
adviser and protector of Mrs. Craven dur
ing the absence of S. M. Snortridge and the
illness of D. M. Delmas, was more com
municative, and freely gave his opinion
on the very interesting situation created
within the past few days.
"This present series of counter-proceed
ings," he said, "coming up at this time,
after a long calm, was primarily brought
about by the filing of Mrs. Craven's deeds.
The gentlemen on the other side Lave
pressed the matter of the taking *of Mrs.
Craven's deposition, on the ground that
they were taken by surprise by the filing
of those papers. A 6 a matter of fact they
have known of the existence of those
papers for a year and a half, and it was in
view of the existence of those papers and
the will of September 24, 1894, that they
entered into that compromise contractor
rather had the children of Senator Fair
enter into it, and which document Mrs.
Craven, through her counsel, has de
manded to be produced in court Thursday
night.
"Until yesterday those gentlemen have
â all of them â denied both publicly and
privately the existence of that contract.
They now admit that during the year and
a half they have had the contract and
have known of its existence.
"They have made many statements to
discredit Mrs. Craven in the eyes of the
pnblic, yet by their present admissions
they show that they themselves have de
ceived the public during all of this time.
"In the proceedings on Monday night
they sought wholly for an opnortunity to
say, under the license granted to them as
attorneys, what the newspapers prior to
that time could not publish, even at their
instance.
"In that proceeding they sought to
accomplish three things:
"First â To take the deposition of Mrs.
Craven.
"Second â To have her sworn and the
jurisdiction of the court admitted.
"Third â On her lefusal to be sworn to
have her adjudged guilty of contempt.
"In the excitement of the occasion it
was overlooked that in none of these three
things were they successful. Her deposi
tion was not taken; she was not sworn
until she was advised by her counsel to
take the oath, and she was not humiliated,
as they had hoped, by being even mo
mentarily imprisoned.
"On the other hand, Mrs. Craven wanted
a positive ruling on the sufficiency of the
affidavit and notice of the taking of the
deposition, in order to found a counter
proceeding to see whether the gentlemen
who tell so many conflicting stories to
reporters will tell the same stories under
oath.
"These gentlemen, after having for a
year and a half kept secret the existence of
the compromise contract, are now seek
ing to explain to the press the terms of j
the contract. They will have an oppor
tunity to state those terms under oath in I
all probability, and, having been found
false in one thing, it will be a question in
every one's mind whether they are telling
the truth now.
"In regard to the contract the public
must draw its own conclusions until Mrs.
Craven has had an opportunity to -show
what the terms of that contract are. At
present we cannot, as her counsel, give
any information as to our understanding
of the legality of that document."
HOTEL-KEEPERS ORGANIZE
Italian Bonifaces Have Fgung
Mutual Protection
Necessary.
Henceforth Deadbeats Must Pay in
Advance or Go Into the
Cold World.
The Italian-Swiss hotel and boarding
house keepers of this City and State have
found it necessary to organize for mutual
protection against the gay and festive
deadbeats who were making them a prey.
A number of these gentry have lately
been making their presence felt among
the hard-working hotel proprietors and
lodging-house keepers of North Beach and
Montgomery avenue. After li7ing in
clover at one hostelry till the proprietors
stock of patience and credit has given
out, it has been the custom of these
knights of idleness ;o move on to another
hotel and begin the game all over again.
The proprietors began to sigh for the
good old days when they had an Italian
hotel union and a black list, by means of
wnich deadbeats could be checked early
in their nefarious careers. The union had
fallen into abeyance in 1892, but tue reali-.
ration of the u^e it was to the hotel pro
prietors has brought about the formation
of another society on very sirnila; 1 lines.
The new Bodeta di Mtuua l'rotezione
tra i Proprietari di Hotels c Pensioni Ital
lani c Svizzen ltaliani has only just been
tormed, and it will be incorporated within
the next week. At the last meeting,
which took place in Colombo Hall, G. Le
pori was elected president, V. Da Valle
treasurer, and G. Mnsso secretary. The
constitution adopted was in substance
that of the Italian Hotel Proprietors'
Protective Union, which fell into abey
ance in 189*2. About twenty hotel propri
etors are charter mem ocrs of the new so
ciety, among them being: (i. Giuntini, D.
Paganucci, F. Ungaretti, L. Puccineili, R.
Petri, L. Roscelli, E. del Carlo, Q. Capo
nelli, E. Parodi, G. Fabris, R. Allegrini, P.
Nave, DapeloD. Devincenzi, S. Damartini,
W. Foppiano and G. Barbagelata.
Hotel proprietors from all over the State
are eligible for membership and several
Italian bonifaces in interior towns have al
ready signified their intention of joining.
