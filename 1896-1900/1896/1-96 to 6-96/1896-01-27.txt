GENERAL GARCIA IS EN ROUTE TO CUBA.
The Veteran Leader Will
Command an Army
of Patriots.
EVADES THE SPANIARDS.
He Leaves for the Island at
the Head of a Formidable
Expedition.
ARMS, AMMUNITION AND MEN.
An Invaluable Addition to the Re
sources of the Struggling
Insurgents.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 26.-A
tnorning paper says to-day: General Cal
ixto Garcia, the most distinguished Cuban
general now outside of Cuba, has escaped
the watchful eyes of Spanish agents and
Bailed from this port last Thursday, it is
said, on the fruit steamer Bernard, bound
for Cuba.
General Garcia goes to Cuba at the head
of the most formidable expedition that has
ever left this country, of which he will
take command on the high seas, where he
â will meet another fruit steamer, the Jasof,
with over 300 men on board and a large
quantity of arms and ammunition.
From those familiar with General Gar
cia's plans it was learned that the expedi
tion will make for some port near the
boundary line of the province of Pinar del
Rio and the province of Havana. General
Gomez is thoroughly informed of all the
plans for the expedition, and at the point
agreed upon for the landing of the expedi
tion he will have a strong body of troops.
Owing to his great popularity in that
district, it is expected that General Garcia
will at once place himself at the head of
a strong body of men in the province of
Pina del Rio.
Among Cubans in this country great
hope is placed in this expedition. One of
the drawbacks of the Cuban cause has
been the lack of commanders who com
bine both bravery and military sagacity.
Should any misfortune befall either Gen
eral Maximo Gomez or Generals Jose or
Antonio Maceo, the Cubans' cause would,
be in a rather embarrassing position.
General Garcia, however, is fully com
petent to take any of the generals' places
at a moment's notice, and when news of j
the successful landing of his expedition I
reaches this country, there will be rejoic- |
ing among the Cubans.
CAPTURE A TRAIX.
Rebels Destroy the Coaches After Alloxe-
ing the Passengers to Depart.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 26.â insur
gents, despite the Government assertions
to the contrary, appear to be doing just
about as they please in the neighborhood
of Havana.
This afternoon a band of rebels stopped
a train that was running between Guanajay
and this city. They ordered the passen
gers, who were in a state bordering on
panic, to leave the train, which order was
obeyed with alacrity.
The passengers feared they would be
maltreated by the insurgents, but their
fears were groundless, as the rebel leader
courteously informed them that they
would not be harmed, nor would their per
sonal effects be molested. They would,
however, have to pursue their journey on
foot, as it was their intention to destroy
the train.
The commander then gave orders for the
torch to be applied to the cars, and soon
nothing was left except the iron work. The
train was captured about a mile from San
Antonio, to which place the passengers
walked and informed the authorities of
what had occurred.
Troops were immediately dispatched to
the scene, but when they arrived the
rebels had disappeared. The train did not
have one of the armored cars which are
used. on the railroads for the conveyance
of troops to guard the passengers and the
railway company's property.
A car for this purpose is being built on
the Havana and Guanajay line and as
6oon as it is finished, which will be
shortly, it will be placed in service. Pass
engers on the line will then be able to
travel in security, unless the insurgents
take to removing rails, loosening fish
plates or adopting some other method to
wreck the trains.
It is, however, not believed that they
â Kill do this, as their efforts are not directed
toward harming passengers on the rail
wrys. but to destroying railroad property
when it can be done without risk to pas
sengers.

MINOR ENGAGEMENTS.
i
General Munoz Encounters the Rands of
Rabi and Rios.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 26.âMin
ister Dupuy de Lome to-day received tele
grams from Havana giving . accounts of
several engagements between the Spanish
troops and insureents, all but one of which
are of minor importance. In that case
General Gonzales Munoz encountered the
bands of Francisco Rabi and Rios in the
Mula Pass and succeeded in putting them
to flight. The casualties were not given.
It is explained that the importance and
significance of this encounter lies in the
fact tnat whereas Rabi and Rios were re
ported to be approaching Havana to re
enforce Gomez, they were encountered by
Munoz in the most easterly portion of the
island, several hundred miles distant from
Havana. .

POISON IN HIS COFFEE.
Attempt of a Woman to End Her Husband's
Life Foiled by a Servant
Girl.
ERIE, Pa., Jan. 26.â A sensation oc-
c urred this afternoon at Girard.this county,
when Mary H. Nellis was arrested for
I poisoning with intent to kill her husband,
Peter 11. Nellis, proprietor of the Nellis
; House, and Edward Gardner was arrested
as an accomplice. The prisoners were
brought here to-night and lodged in jail.
Nellis is wealthy and his wife is a hand-
some woman. Last summer Mrs. Nellis
spent some time at Lilydale and brought
home with her for a bartender Edward
Gardner, whom she had met at the spirit
ualistic resort. Nellis carried a $10,000
policy on his life in favor of his wife. Sev
eral weeks ago he was taken sick. He has
since been in declining health, and his
brother-in-law, Dr. Rogers, of Connaught,
Ohio, became suspicious and set Maggie
Hulbrook, a dining-room girl, to keep
watch on events in the hotel.
Saturday at noon Nellis got a dose of
j tartar emetic in his coffee. Saturday
night tne girl caught and saved another
i dose which Nellis was to have taken.
j Nellis got another dose to-day, but was re
j lieved with a stomach-pump. The arrests
i followed and created great excitement.
1 The feeling was so strong in Girard against
j Gardner that only his timely removal by
! the officers saved him from probable
j lynching. 7Y: -

TO TAX CHURCH PROPERTY.
A Halt That Aft Roman Catholics "will
Watch With Interest.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Jan. 26.â A legal
fight which, will attract the attention of
Roman Catholics the world over will be
instituted this week. Attorneys Stephens,
Lincoln and Smith, who represent this
diocese, have been notified to appear be
fore the County Auditor to hear an appli
cation, made upon behalf of some person
whose identity is not at present estab
lished, for the placing on the tax duplicate
of all the property in this county owned
by the Roman Catholic Church and not
used as a place of worship. Auditor
Hagerty will refuse, as he did privately
some time ago, and a suit in mandamus
will be filed against him in the Supreme
Court. â â¢â¢'Tp-T'P/-
The property in question is valued at
$1,000,000, and an effort will be made to
bave it charged for the last six years on ah
increased valuation of $6,000,000. The con
tract for doing this work was signed late
Friday afternoon.
HUNTINGTON'S MEN BUSY
Southern Pacific Preparing to
Fight the Repealing Bill
in Kentucky.
The Measure Is Certain to Pass the
Senate, but May Run Aground
in the House.
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Jan. 26.â Senator
Goebel's bill repealing the charter of the
Southern Pacific Company has not yet
been returned in printed form, but will
probably be to-morrow, when it will be re
ferred to the Committee on Railroads, of
which Senator Goebel is himself a member.
The bill is likely to be advanced rapidly,
and may be put upon its passage in the
Senate early next week.
It is said the road will make a strong
fight to defeat the repealing measure, but
indications are that it will pass the Senate
easily. The difficulty it is most likely to
encounter is in being run aground in the
House on account of overshadowing politi
cal complications in that branch.

immediate fatal results were anticipated.
No longer ago than last Tuesday evening
he was present at a dinner given in his
honor by ex-Empress Frederick, mother
of Emperor William.
Last summer Mr. Runyon had planned
to make an extended trip through Nor
way, but on the advice of his physician he
abandoned this trip and instead went to
Carlsbad, where he took ' the cure. He
subsequently went to Axenstein, Switzer
land, for the purpose of " taking -an after
cure. '7*;i7'7> ...â  â  -..-.
Since that time, however, he has mani
fested great activity in the' discharge of
the duties of his olfice, which have been
more than ;. usually onerous on account of
the complications :in European â  affairs,
which have more or less demanded the

Embassador Runyon's death will- come
as a great shock to official- and social cir
cles here in Berlin, where he was a great
favorite. . . . -
The Hon. Theodore Runyon was born'
at Somerville, N. J., October 25, 1822. He
graduated from Yale Colege in 1842 and in
1844 was admitted to the ' bar. In 1853 he
was made city attorney and in 1856 city
counselor of Newark, N. J., a position 'â  re
tained until 1864, when he became Mayor
of the city.
He was appointed in ,1856 a commis
sioner to revise and codify the militia laws
of New Jersey, and in 1857 was made brig
adier-general and subsequently major
general of the New Jersey National Guard.
At the outbreak of the Civil War he was
placed in command of the New Jersjy
brigade of volunteers. 'Â» . "
In 1865 he was Democratic candidate for
Governor of his State,. but was not elected.
From ,1873 to 1887. he was Chancellor of
New Jersey. In March, 1503, he was ap
pointed by President Cleveland American
Minister to Germany, shortly 'after
ward was made Embassador. The degree
of LL.D. was conferred upon him by Yale,

EFFECTING ITS OWN RESCUE.
The Greyhound Draws Itself Seaward
by Means of Hawsers Attached
to Anchors.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Jan. 26.â
thousand visitors from the numerous re
sorts north and south of this place, as well
as from New York, Philadelphia and the
larger New Jersey towns, flocked here to
day and repaired to the beach to watch
the efforts made to pull the steamer St.
Paul, the famous ocean greyhound, over
the bar -into deep water. The ship was
moved 170 feet seaward, but the flood tide
was not of sufficient duration to enable
the crews of the steamer and the wrecking
companies to haul her into water deep
enough to float her. There were fifty pow
erful tugs opposite the St. Paul ready to
render assistance, but they were not
utilized.
Six immense anchors were planted in
the sea about a thousand yards from the
stranded vessel. Fastened to the anchors
were several steel hawsers, which were
connected with the powerful capstan on
the -,' stern of the ship. This capstan was
rotated by steam power furnished by the
steamer's boilers and engines. Everything
was in readiness for the haul and soon
after midnight the engines were started.
The hawsers ' tightened, the capstan
creaked, and inch by inch the big ship
was pulled seaward. When the tide
turned to ', the ebb the boat had been
moved nearly one-third of her length and
placed in a more advantageous position,
as at low tide she was only six feet in the
sand and in eleven ! feet of water. The
strain on the hawsers. was kept up moder
ately during the day in order to keep the
ship from again moving toward the beach.
No attempt was made to float her while
the afternoon tide was at the flood.
Those in . charge predict that to-mor
row's high tides will be higher than that
of ; to-day, and- with favorable conditions
they, expect to complete the work begun
so auspiciously last night. The sea was
almost as- quiet to-day as the proverbial
mill | pond. This state of affairs caused
the life-saving crews to remove from the
ship the line thrown to her when strand
ed, which - was ' used ; , to run the breeches
buoy to and from the liner.
Messrs. Clement A. Griscom, senior and
junior, of Philadelphia, president .and
manager, respectively, of the Interna
tional ': Navigation Company; "William
Cramp, a member of the firm that built
the St. Paul; Marine Superintendent
Shockford and other high * officials of the
American line visited the unlucky ship
and spent hours in consultation with Cap
tain Jamison and his 'staff. 7 They gave
out no ] official â â  statement for publication,
but the petty â¢ officers strongly deny that
the St. Paul - was engaged iln a race with
the Campania prior to the accident. This
story is not generally believed, as Captain
James Mulligan of life station No. 4, who
was - the first ] to 7 board . the ship in the
breeches buoy on Saturday morning,
states that 'the first question â¢ put to him
by "the passengers when he stepped foot on
the deck was, "Where â is the Campania?"
' All the passengers of the ' St. Paul , were
taken to I New York in tugs late yesterday
afternoon, but the entire crew, numbering
400, including 7 many women, remain â _ on
THE SAN JOSE LOCAL WRECKED NEAR BADEN
board, and have not come ashore since the
St. Paul struck. , ? .
* The steamer carried a cargo of fruits,
nuts, gold and general merchandise.
Early this morning the ligbter John Hag
gerty was floated to the shoreward side of
the vessel, and the crew of the latter, as
sisted by the wreckers, transferred hun
dreds of tons of tbe cargo from the steam
er's side to the lighter. The baggage and
perishable goods were first moved. These
were taken to New* York. The large
amount of the precious metal was not dis
turbed, but remains in a strong box on
board the steamer in charge of a^guard of
picked men. ; ' *
The officers of the St. Paul deny the re
port that the vessel was injured when she
struck. They say there is no water in her
hold and her plates are just as intact as
thÂ« day she was launched. .
One of tne novel features of the day was
the rigging of a telephone on board the
boat to connect with the shore. The
shore end is connected with the local tele
phone system, and by this means the
ship* s officers are able to communicate
with their agents in the city.
The scene on Ocean avenue in front of
tho beached steamer resembled a county
fair; improvised lunch rooms, cigar stands
and traveling "speakeasies" furnished
food and drink to the multitude.
On the portico of one of the big summer
hotels, now closed, was a large sign read
ing: "Seats to Let," and the enterprising
man in charge reaped a harvest of shekels.
The local railroad from Asbury Park to
Long Branch carried thousands of passen
gers. Farmers from a distance of twenty
miles drove to the scene of the accident,
and mingled with the fashionably dressed
visitors from the city. ".>â¢';'
At 9 o'clock to-night Custom-house Of
ficer Patterson telephoned from the St.
Paul that a determined effort would be
made at 5 a. m. to-morrow to pull the ship
from her cradle in the sand. Mr. Patter
son said the attempt would doubtless be a
failure, unless a wind from the east was
blowing that would make the tide extra
high. |

Because he failed to understand or heed
I a danger signal Engineer Jack Keyer
of the Southern Pacific Company lost his
j life at 6 o'clock last evening and narrowly
j escaped sacrificing the lives of nearly one
| hundred passengers in the train under his
charge.
Train No. 19, which runs to San Jose and
way stations, left this City at 's:3o o'clock
on time and ran at its usual speed to Baden
station. Here a red lantern the signal of
danger â was swung in front of the speed
ing engine to warn the engineer that some
thing was wrong down the road, but
though the train slowed down to some
extent it did not do so sufficiently to avert
a disaster and ' the engineer's life went out
in the flood that filled the basins on each
side of the track.
The fireman and conductor of the train
were also badly hurt.
The terrific rains of yesterday afternoon
sent torrents of water down the little
valley that leads from Colma to Baden,
each canyon adding its volume to the
flood until the flume recently built by the
Supervisors of San Mateo County to pro
tect the county road was filled to over
flowing and the lowlands were covered
many feet deep. :
Below the pumping station at the Baden
artesian wells the flat that in the morning
had been merely a marsh, covered with an
inch or two or water, became a river six or
eight feet deep, rushing with terriffic force
toward the bay, carrying fences and
bulkheads away and driving the cattle to
the higher ground. The railroad at this
point is built on an embankment, which
crosses the marsh to South- San Francisco
station and divides the flat into two parts.
The culverts were totally inadequate to
carry away the water and it gradually in
creased in volume until it overflowed the
embankment and began undermining the
track. Once the water crossed the rails it
ate its way into the foundations and
carried mud, stone and even ties with the
â¢â¢oaring torrent that rushed down the
north side of the embankment.
â¢ The train from the south, which passes
South San . Francisco at 4:30 o'clock,
crossed the dangerous portion in safety,
but within an hour the roadbed was so in
secure that even a pedestrian could not
pass without picking his steps carefully
for fear of falling into the rushing waters
on either side. â¢ V, -.-â¢". â :;/.-
The employes at Baden and South San
Francisco knew nothing of the danger
until the train had plunged into, the water
and the roar of the escaping steam warned
them that something had occurred. Then
messengers and danger signals were sent
both ways to warn approaching trains of
the disaster. â¢
The scene on board the wrecked|local
was almost indescribable. Though the
train was not running at a high rate of

speed the jar of the sudden stoppage as
the engine rolled over into the water threw
the passengers from their seats, bruising
many and frightening all almost out of
their senses.
Their fears were not allayed when they
rushed to doors and windows and saw the
vast sheets of water stretching away on
either side and heard the roar of escaping
steam as it rushed from the engine with
the noise of a shrieking geyser.
A panic at once ensued and a further
loss of life was only averted by the fact
that the embankment on each side slopes
gradually, and that at a distance of a few
feet from the train the water was not of
such a depth as to go over the heads of the
passengers. Several women leaped madly 1
from the windows and platforms in the
hope of escaping further danger, only to
land in water up to their necks.
Their screams for assistance added to the
general confusion and for a time it was be
lieved that more lives than that of the en
gineer had been lost Finally ail were in
duced to return to the coaches.
In the meantime Conductor Stanwood
had hurried forward to ascertain whether
the rest of the train crew were safe.
He found the fireman, Charles Gill,
clinging to the top of the cab which had
been torn from its fastenings by the force
of the lurch into the ditch, and holding
on to the arm of Engineer Keyer, whom
he was vainly endeavoring to drag on to
his frail support. The weight of the lat
ter's body was so great that he was unable
to accomplish his object and he was well
nigh exhausted when his rescuers climbed
over the derailed baggage car and carried
him back to the rear coach.
After ascertaining that the fireman was
not greatly in danger, the efforts of the
baggage-master and conductor, as well as
two Catholic priests who were on board,
were directed to an attempt to resusitate
the engineer.
A hasty examination showed that his
left leu; was broken and that he had re
mained so long under water that his lungs
were filled with water. A couple of Stan
ford University students advised rolling
him over a barrel, but as none could be
found a seat was impovised into a means
of relieving him of the water, and stimu
lants were forced down his throat.
All these measures were without avail,
and he was given up for dead.
The fireman's injuries consisted of a
badly torn left ear and a terrible cut that
extended from the left temple to nearly
the top of his head.
He was much dazed when led into the
coach, and the horror of the awful plunge
into the water seemed to have completely
unnerved him, for he covered his face with
a coat borrowed from a sympathetic pas
senger and answered in monosyllables
when questioned.
The horrors of a double wreck were only
averted by the prompt action of the con
ductor of the train in sending a messenger
to South San Francisco station to stop the
Monterey express at that point.
While working on Keyer's body a wild
cry of fire struck new terror into the
hearts of the frightened passengers and
all began hastily gathering their effects
and hurrying from the train. The glare of
the flames came from the baggage-car, and
it seemed for a time that the trunks of the
passengers would be consumed, but by
hard work the fire was subdued and the
passengers were induced to return to
their seats.
It was fully two hours before a relief
train went to the rescue of the wreck.
It was d*ie within a few minutes after
the San Jose train was wrecked, and as
the employes at South San Francisco
knew nothing of the washout nothing else
could have prevented it from going into
the break, as it must pass through a long,
narrow cut just before reaching the break.
As it happened the messenger arrived
just in time and the lives of many passen- i
gers were saved.
Among those who were cut and bruised
by being thrown against the seats by the
force of the collision was Mrs. Vapgini of
San Jose, bhe sustained severe injuries
about the head and was insensible for
some time.
THE FIREMAN'S STORY.
How He Vainly Tried to Save the
Life of Engineer
. Keyer.
Charles Gill, the fireman, when seen in
the rear coach, after he had recovered his
senses to some extent, said
"I warned the engineer of the impend
ing danger as we passed Baden station. I
saw a red lantern, which was apparently
being carried alongside the track, swing
toward -the engine. I scented danger and
called to Jack, saying: 'We had better
look out. There is a red lantern and there
may be some danger on the road.' He
laughed and said, 'I guess it is only a
track-walker.' But at the same time, as a
matter of precaution, instructed me to
slow down. â  â¢'-â '.
"The track seemed to be all right, and
we ran on for some time until near the cut
just this side of South San Francisco
station. Then the engine gave a sudden
lurch and rolled over to the right. I
sprang through the window to cave my
self. I struck the water head first and
dove to save myself from the engine in
case it came my way. As I went through
the window 1 saw poor Jack beneath me
with his hand on the throttle and a look
of astonishment on his face that showed
me that he did not realize the danger.
"After being under the water what
seemed to me to be a very long time, I
came to the surface' and struck out for a
portion of the cab which I saw floating
near me. My head was in a whirl from a
blow I bad received from the cab as I went
out of the window, and I was some time
in gaining the floating roof.
"I could scarcely drag myself on top of
it, but finally succeeded and then looked
around for Jack.
"I had scarcely done so when the en
gineer came up alongside of 'me, gasping
for breath and apparently very badly in
jured. I endeavored to draw him up on
the floating wreck, but being a heavy man
I was not able to bundle him and he fell
back into the water.
"Seeing that be was unable to help him
self. I swam away from the roof and got
him by the arm. By this time the con
ductor and train crew had reached us, and
they took us both back to the coaches.
"Keyer must have been badly injured
when the cab was. broken from the engine,
for he made no effort to help himself, and
said nothing when I asked him if he was
hurt. He was limp, and I saw that he
must be helped or that he would drown.
"The plunge of the engine was so sud
den that he was unable to clear himself
before the machine went over into the
ditch.
"It seemed hours before any one came
to us, though of course it must have been
hut a few minutes. I shall never forget
the awful feeling as the engine lurched
away into the dark water and I saw that
Jack must go with it.''
WARNED BY A REPORTER.
Graphic Story Told by an Eye-
Witness of the Dis
â¢ aster.
John P. Reynolds, a reporter of The
Call, was the first to discover the wash
out that caused the wreck, and gave the
warning which might have saved the life
of Engineer Keyer. His story of the
wreck is as follows:
"During the morning I passed down the
road going to South San Francisco, and
saw no evidence that a disaster might be
impending. The valley which, at the
time of the wreck, was a roaring torrent,
was a green flat, through which ran a
gentle stream of water winding its devious
way toward the bay.
"The scene on my return in the evening
was very different. Before I had left
South San Francisco station I could ' near
the roar of angry waters and after passing
through the cut just east of the station I
saw that what had been a meadow was now
a rushing river. Fences were under water
or totally carried away.
"I had not proceeded far down the track
when I discovered that it was being un
dermined. Little rills of water were cut
ting away the earth and sand, growing mo
mentarily larger and evidently weakening
the roadbed. A little farther on a culvert
under the roadbed was running full to the
level of the track. Soon it became neces
sary to pick my steps. The north side of
the track was sinking gradually and
showed that it was entirely insecure.
" Before I reached Baden station several
places were passed where for the width of
a street the water was running under the
track to the depth of a foot.
"Knowing that the 5:30 train was about
due I hurried on to Baden to endeavor to
warn whatever employes of the company I
might see that a train wreck might occur
unless the local was signaled. Near
Baden station 1 met Trackwalker Murphy
and told him of the washout. He was
just about to put up a signal lantern
when I called upon him to stop and ex
plained to him that unless the train was
stopped a loss of life was almost certain.
He seemed to scout at the idea that a
serious washout had occurred and started
to walk away. .
. . ..
"While we were talking the headlight of
an engine came into view, and I again im
plored him to make every effort to stop the
train. Then he turned the red light of his
lantern toward the swiftly approaching
train and swung it gently to and fro. Ap
parently the signal had no effect on the
train, for she roared past us across a bridge
and upon the . straight stretch of track
where the fatal washout was. I called to j
Murphy, saying, 'There goes a wreck'; but j
he seemed to think it was all right, and j
said, 'She'll reach the cut safely.' '7o;77l'
"I knew that unless the train was j
stopped within a short distance a wreck |
was inevitable, and I watched the red r j
lights in the rear of the train as they |
swung around the curve. At first it
seemed that Murphy's prediction would j
come true. The train went on and on, I
when suddenly the lights seemed to sway
and stop and a dull roar of escaping steam
came to us. Then I knew that the train \
had been wrecked and I ran down the
track to see whether any lives had been i
lost. I met women and children and a i
man in his coat sleeves running toward j
Baden in breathless fear. They told me*" j
that the engineer and fireman were pinned !
under the engine and that many people 1
had been hurt, some drowned. 7 V â¢
"On board the train and in the water be- I
aide it pandemonium reigned. Women' 1
were shrieking and men running back and !
forward seeking some means of escape,' j
while others simply sat in their seats, too : i
frightened to move. On either side the j
muddy water Tushed by into the darkness, !
adding its roar to that of â¢ the escaping
steam. ' â â -'*.'.â¢ .*.;:.â :.-*Â» , -â â  â . . .â *- <â //â  "'â :-'â¢â .--; â -â â ..
"No one outside of the conductor seemed
to know what to do. He was running
backward and forward, encouraging pas
sengers or giving directions regarding the
dying engineer, on whom several men
were working in a vain effort to resuscitate
him. ~4'4yp
"The fireman, who by this time was en
veloped in a great coat loaned by a passen
ger, was sitting in a corner of the car, his
head covered by the folds of tho garment,
seemingly oblivious to all that passed
about him. He complained that his head
felt numb, but his only thought seemed to
be of the engineer, and he begged that
some one would go for a doctor.
"The engine lay on its side in the water
alongside of the. track, the broken cab en
tangled in a barb- wire fence floating beside
it. The baggage car, though not entirely
off the track, inclined at such an angle
that it threatened momentarily to follow
the engine. The smoker, which was im
mediately in the rear of the baggage car,
was also in such a dangerous position that
those who were working on the inanimate
form of the engineer had to leave it and
carry it into the first coach. The coaches
were soon found to be standing on an in
secure track and the passengers were ad
vised to leave them. They accordingly
did so and wended their way in a sorrow
ful procession to Baden station.
"Before they were able to collect their
effects and leave, the horrors of fire were
added to those that already unnerved
them. The baggage-car contained a stove
which was thrown against the side of the
car when the engine plunged Into the
washout, and the car was soon in a blaze.
The train crew was compelled to leave the
frightened passengers and hurry to the
rescue of the baggage. Baggage-master
Robinson removed as much of the passen
gers' effects as he could reach, and as
sisted in putting out the fire, which for a
time threatened to consume the entire car.
"I heard a number of passengers, who
saw the red lantern swung beside the
train, complain bitterly of seeming negli
gence of the engineer."
AN OFFICIAL'S OPINION.
Transportation Master Richardson
Tells How the Accident May
Have Happened.
. Georce F. Richardson, master of trans
portation of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, said last evening that the only
information he had received about the
accident was what he had got from the
vicinity of the wrecfc by telephone.
"The engineer, John Keyer, had been
notified to look out for sand on the track
and in a general way was told to keep a
sharp lookout. How the accident hap
pened I. of course, do not know, but am of
the impression that it was caused by a tide
washout.
"The country down there between Baden
and South San Francisco is rather flat and
there is always considerable water there
in winter, and; there must have been a
great deal there this afternoon after that
heavy shower.
\ "It Is probable that a portion of one side
under the track was washed away and
that the rails remained in position, and by
reason of that the engineer could not dis
cover it. When the engine passed over it
its weight caused the track to sink and the
engine to careen and fall on its side. 'â â ""/â â 
"The engineer was taken out alive but
fatally hurt. A physician was sent to him
soon as possible, but he died in a short time.
He was one of the old employes of the
road. The caboose went over too and the
smoker careened but did not topple. No
one but the unfortunate engineer was in
jured.
"There were men at the station near
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1896.
where the accident happened, but I have
not learned if they did anything or not, or
if they discovered the washout. ; 77; "
"The traffic on the road will not be in
terrupted as the trains will go by the old
road, that is by San Bruno." â â  :
THE CONDUCTOR'S STORY.
It Was Owing to His Clear-Headed
Action That GUI Was
Saved.
Conductor Stanwood was the clearest
headed man on board the train after the
wreck occurred. His first thought was for
the engineer, who he surmised must be
in great danger, and, after convincing
himself that the passengers^were in no im
mediate peril, he hurried forward to the
wrecked engine. To his efforts is due the
prompt rescue of Fireman Gill.
"I knew that poor Jack must have gone
down with his engine,'" he said, "and
when the sudden shock cameâ first
warning of the disasterâ l made up my
mind that he must be rescued at once if
at all. When I climbed over the baggage
car I saw that* Gill was trying to support
him on top of the broken engine cab. It
took but a cursory glance, however, to
show that he waa i beyond help. We did
not waste any time, though, in using every
effort to resuscitate him, but it was of no
use, and the company has lost one of the
most faithful men it its employ.
"I cannot understand how the wreck
could have occurred. The uptrain passed
in safety and the force of the water carry
ing away the track must have been terrific
to accomplish the damage it did in so
short a time. With the little warning we
had I don't see how it could have been
avoided. Beyond the wetting that some
of the passengers received from jumping
into the water and a few bruises from sud
den contact with seats I know of no one
being injured." / zz^py y'-y/ipT,
TOLD BY MISS THOMAS.
She Is a Fatalist and Calmly Ob-
served the Panic.
Miss Nina Thomas of San Jose, one of
the few female passengers who were able
to control themselves sufficiently to talk
of the accident, said that for a moment she
expected to be killed. "The shock was so
sudden," she said, "that we had no time
to collect our thoughts before the rumble
and roar of the escaping steam told us that
some serious accident had occurred. As
for myself. I am a fatalist, and I believe
that when my* time comes my own actions
will have no bearing on my. fate. So I
simply sat and watchedthe actions of the
other passengers.
"One Italian woman screamed and
made frantic efforts to wrench a window
open with the apparent intention of jump
ing out. She would certainly have been
drowned had she done so, for the water
was deep on- the side she had chosen for
her leap. T.- Â â¢ U
"Another woman seized a huge hamper
basket in each hand* and just jumped off
the platform without looking to see where
she was going to land. She was dragged
back into the car a few .moments later wet
and bedraggled, but still in possession of
her baskets. I wanted to, go forward and
see the poor engineer who tuck, to his
post to the last, but they would not let
me." . ..... ' ;. j
A STUDENT'S STORY.
He Attributes the Catastrophe to
* the Lack of Track-Walkers.
A Stanford University student who did
: not desire his name used for fear that he
j might be called from bis studies to attend
; the inquest said that the shock was so sud
i den that he was thrown violently into the
j aisle of the car.
"It appears to me," he said, "that most
men are greater cowards than women in
cases of this kind. Some of the male
passengers paid no more attention to the
ladies than if they had been so many sheep
or so much baggage, but simply rushed
for the rear end of the car looking out for
their own safety. It seems to me that this
accident could have been- avoided and the
engineer's life spared had the .company
taken proper precautions regarding the
track. ....
"A number of washouts have occurred
in this very locality, and had the track
walkers been employed, as they formerly
were, they must have discovered the
danger that threatened the trains going
either way.
"It must have taken several hours for
the water to eat away the bed of the track,
and within that time it would certainly
seem that the danger should have been
discovered. However, we are- thankful
that we escaped with nothing worse than
a shaking up."
THE DEAD ENGINEER.
A Married Man and Old Employe.

the Ogden division. He was one of. the
most trusted engineers in the service of
the Southern Pacific Company, and was
recently transferred to ths "soft" run be
tween San Francisco and San Jose â¢ He
was married, and lived with his wife at
427 Seventeenth street. '.-,7:
Charles Gill, the fireman, is a San Fran
cisco boy, who has been on the coast run
for several months past. He is now at St.
Luke's Hospital being treated for the seri
ous wounds he received in the wreck.
MURPHY WAS VIGILANT.
Did All In His Power to Warn the
Engineer.
Watchman Murphy, who is supposed to
look out for the safety of trains at Baden,
station, insisted that he had done every
thing possible to stop the train after learn
ing of the washout.
"A man came running breathlessly to
me." he said, "and told me that the track
was gone for a quarter of a mile near the
South San Francisco cut.
"Before I could understand the danger
the train came by, arid though I did all in
my power to signal it the engineer seemed
to pay no attention. As a matter of fact I
am not supposed to watch that section of
the track, and if any watchman or track
walker is to blame for the accident it is the
man who is located at the South San
Francisco station." :â  -
TRACK WASHOUTS.
Thousands of Dollars of Damage
Toward South San Fran
cisco. .
The storm of yesterday did thousands of
dollars of damage to the roadbed of the
San Francisco and San Mateo Electric
Railroad Company. Tons of sand covered
the track in some places, while in others
the bed was washed out to an , extent that
entirely precluded the 7 passage .. of cars.
Several cars were derailed, and in many
instances bothmbtorraen and conductors
were compelled to get out with shovels and
clear the tracks. , p .; â â¢
Car 24, in charge of Motorman Jones and
Conductor Murray, ran off the track on the
grade between the Abbey House 7 and
Colma and entirely blockaded the line at
that point.
At , Ocean View a car jumped the
track arid in spite of the efforts of a gang
of men sent to clear it away the sand piled
up about the disabled car faster than it
could^be shoveled away.
â¢ At the railroad crossing below Colraa car
20, in charge of Conductor Jeffries, was
hopelessly stalled, sand covering the
tracks to the depth of a foot. "
The car running on the lower division
of the road was unable to proceed ; more
.* ha .?, 7. half a mile from Holy Cross Ceme
tery. Serious washouts rendered the cul
verts and roadbeds unsafe. ;.
Between the Villa and' Holy Cross the
'roadbed is washed out for the distance of a
quarter of a mile, the tracks in some
places being inclined at an angle of 45 de
grees. It w'll be several weeks' before the
road is again in running order.
The rain did much damage in the Mis
sion. At Fourteenth arid Fifteenth streets
on Howard the sewers got choked up and
the water covered the sidewalks and road
way to the depth of four feet. The cable
cars had considerable difficulty in passing
and if the storm had continued much
longer traffic would have been suspended
and the stores and houses in the vicinity
would have been flooded.
A small bridge on the Ingieside division
of the Mission-street electric road," about
100 yards off the Mission road, was washed
away and completely stopped traffic.
Men were set to work to repair the dam
age last night arid the cars will probably
be runniug to-day. .
At the foot of ". College hill there was a
bad cave-in on the west side! of the road
way. The sidewalk, fence, and a portion
of the roadway were washed away, leaving
the latter in a dangerous condition. *
About 7 o'clock last night John Morris,
a lumberman, was driving home in his
buggy,, and â  when near the Four-mile
House his buggy went into a rut in "the
roadway caused by the storm, and the
vehicle was wrecked. John was locked up
for drunkenness in the Seventeenth-street
Station, and his horse â¢ found shelter for
the night in the Willows livery stables
on Mission street.
MRS. STANFORD HOPEFUL
She Deplores the Delay in the
Appeal Case Soon to Be
Argued.
Has Stinted Herself in Order That
the University's Doors â¢ Be
Kept Open.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 26,-If the
irrigation case is concluded to-morrow the
Stanford suit will be taken up immediately
after, but if the former occupies the whole
day the Stanford suit will be argued Tues
day. Mrs. Stanford in discussing her case
said:
"As a woman I know little of law. I
cannot understand these thingsâ the long
delay in court nor the court routine which
makes the delay of one case postpone an
other. I am told that the sad death of
Judge Dillon's little grandchild, although
he was engaged on the California irrigation
cases, just preceding mine on the court
docket, has also delayed the hearing in
my case.
"I am awaiting the outcome with as
much patience and as little anxiety as I
can. Of course much depends upon it for
me everything in factâ and I could not
bear up under the strain if I did not trust
in a surely just influence higher than any
power here engaged. ../..." .-i-.
--"It has seemed sometimes as if I ; could
not bear the anxiety and burden any
longer," she continued. -"This litigation
has constantly been the uppermost subject
in my mind for nearly two years. And
while my lawyers feel" very much encour
aged over the success they have had in the
lower courts. I cannot but be anxious for
the outcome of every succeeding hearing,
particularly here, where the decision is to
be final.
"I am not used to combating against
such odds. If my husband were alive, I
feel that the whole trouble would melt
away without touching m .-. just as I have
so often seen him with ease banish great
obstacles. Then, too, the maintenance of
the university, as the result of this litiga
tion, has been a great tax upon me, men
tally and financially."
Mrs. Stanford says that, although the
court allowed her $10,000 a month for her
support, she has lived on $300 a month
and has used $700 per month to help pay
the university professors. She has also
sold bonds out of the $1,000,000 worth
which she held.
"The university only received what I
have been able to supply from the pro
ceeds of the Vina and Palo" Alto farms and
my personal funds. I have been endeavor^
ing for the last two years to make these
two large properties bring in an income
larger than the outgo, and am much grati
fied to find that there has been success in a
moderate way, and ; am encouraged to
believe that I may do much better in years
to come. I have learned through experi
ence that 'a dollar saved is a dollar earned.'
These have supported the university since
June, 1893, and it was a pleasure to- take
for this use the gift of my husband on the
twenty-fifth anniversary of our marriage
in 1875, for I considered it was a sacred ob
ligation on my part to do the best Dossible
to keep the doors of the university open
until this suit was finally decided favorably.
"I would receive what I had expended,
and if favorably, I would have the blessed
satisfaction of knowing that . I have used
my best endeavors. I also wish to add
that the experience of the last three years,
since my husband passed away, has
opened a new life to me. I find that there
is more good in human nature, more ten
derness and helpfulness than those who
live in affluence, who have no need, for
sympathy and help, can ever realize."
INTERESTS THE COAST.
California's Delegates in Congress Combine
to Secure Legislation Desired
by Miners.
. â *
WASHINGTON, ,D. C, Jan. 26.â The
California delegation held a caucus at the
Ebbitt House to consider the bills proposed
by the California Miners' Association.
Senators White and Perkins and Repre
sentatives Barbara, Loud, McLachian,
Johnson and Hilborn were present; Hon.
Tiry L. Ford, representing the miners, ex
plained the several bills drafted by the
Miners' Association and already intro
duced by Barham and Johnson.
Most of the time was spent in discussing
the advisability of asking Congress. to ap
propriate $250,000 for the construction of
wing dams and other restraining works un
der Caminetti's hydraulic-mining bill. The
idea is to | attempt to have I this sum in
cluded in a regular appropriation bill and
not by special act. The California Legis
lature has already 7 appropriated $250,000,
to become available when Congress has
provided a like amount.* The delegation
seems to be united on this proposition.
Representative Loud wants to have
Shag, Arch and Blossom rocks blown out
of San Francisco harbor, as they are dan
gerous to deep draught vessels; in foggy
weather. Blossom Rock was blasted some
years ago, so there is ..now ; twenty-four
feet -of water over it, but latterly; ships
have been constructed' of much deeper
draught. '- The big c naval ; vessels would
scrape the bottom of Blossom Rock.-:
Loud also wishes , to secure another sur
vey for Alviso Slough. Engineers have
already reported adversely on this project
three times, but Snn Jose people are again
urging that this slough.be deepened, and
straightened, it being -\ seven miles from
San Jose to the old wharves at Alviso, and
there being to connecting railroad. :

The Ex-Minister Tells Why He
Was Persona Non Grata to
the President.
DEAD GRESHAM DENOUNCED.
Indirectly Accused â¢-.-.. of Conspiring
' Against the Present Island
Government.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 26.â A morning
paper publishes a long statement from
Lorrin A. Thurston, ex-Minister of .the
Republic of- Hawaii, giving the facts lead
ing to his recall last spring. Mr. Thurston
says at the outset of his paper that he had
made a full. reply to his Government of
the complaints against him, but withheld
it until his successor was appointed. In
the meantime Secretary Gresham died,
ana the story did not come out. Mr.
Thurston says in part:
"The gist of the only charge made
against me in the letter requesting my re
call is, in substance, that I furnished the
American press for publication matter
which contained comments and criticism
upon the policy pursued by Mr. Cleveland
and Mr. Gresham toward Hawaii. At that
time Hawaii was represented in Washing
ton ny a Minister and five' Commissioners,
all duly accredited and accepted, who had
â¢formally negotiated and signed an annex
ation treaty, action on which was pending
before the Senate, while the relations be
tween the two Governments were, as they
always had been, most friendly and
cordial.
â¢"'lmmediately after the President's in
auguration information reached the Ha
waiian representatives that he intended to
withdraw the treaty. Inquiry at the State
Department met . with a curt refusal to
confirm or deny the report, and the first
and only news of the withdrawal by Mr.
Cleveland of the treaty reached theHawai
ians through the newspapers. Thus was in
itiated the unique and extraordinary policy
of secreting from the accredited and recog
nized diplomatic representatives of a
friendly government matters vitally
affecting them and their country, and of
allowing them to learn of the intentions of
the government to which they were ac
credited solely through the press. * *â¢
"The immediate and continued endeavors
by the Hawaiian representatives to ascer
tain the intentions of the President were
met by a frigid silence at the State Depart
ment, and the positive refusal either to
state what course the President would pur
sue or to allow the Hawaiian Commission
ers to make any statements or explana
tions. Mr. Gresham's repeated reply was:
'When I desire any information from you
I will let you know.' Meanwhile the
Queen's agents were accorded full and con
fidential audiences, and received assur
ances that the President would do nothing
â¢ until he had made an investigation.
"From this time on the royalists were
kept fully informed of every intended
move contemplated by the President. Mr.
Blount or Mr. Willis concerning Hawaii,
while the Hawaiian Government and its
representatives were kept in ignorance
thereof. : 'Ay : y
'â¢The intention to make an investigation
was soon announced in the press, but Mr.
Gresham refused to affirm or deny it to
the Hawaiian Commissioners. Then the
papers announced that Mr. Blount had
been appointed and had started for San
Francisco, whence he was to go to Hawaii
on a special steamer. Still Mr. Gresham
refused to admit or deny anything.
. "Arrived at Honolulu Mr. Blount rigidly
adhered to the policy of his superiors. The
first and only information which the Ha
waiian Government received concerning
Mr. Blount's instructions was gleaned
from the columns of a royalist paper, in
which they were published in full over
Mr. Blount's signature, under the headinsc
of . "An Address to the Hawaiian People.'
The manner in which Mr. Blount con
structed the report is familiar history.
"After Mr. Blount's return I vainly in
quired of Mr. Gresham what the result
was. He would not even admit that any
report had been made, stating that such
report, if made, was a confidential one and
that it was 'unfair' for me to ask any ques
tions concerning it.
"On the evening of November 7, 1893, be
ing temporarily in Chicago, I saw in an
evening paper a statement that Mr.
Gresham had recommended to the Presi
dent to restore the Queen and overthrow
the Dole Government. I immediately tele
graphed to Mr. Hastings, Hawaiian Charge
d'Affaires, to see Mr. Gresham and ask if it
was true. Mr. Hastings did â  so, and Mr.
Gresham said to him, '1 assure you there
is no 'foundation 7 for the statement. Do
you think I would take so important a step
without informing you?' Mr. . Hastings
telegraphed me the substance of the reply.
That same night at about midnight he was
informed by a newspaper man that Mr.
Gresham's letter to the. President, recom
mending restoration, had been given to
the press. , 7 ;''.-â 'â  , 'â¢
"As will be remembered, this letter
adopted Mr. Blount's conclusions through
out. The publication of the Blount report
and Secretary Gresham's letter placed me
in an embarrassing position. On the one
hand I was the diplomatic representative
of Hawaii and by conventional rules was
not authorized to discuss questions affect
ing * the two, countries except with Mr.
Gresham.7ori the other band, Mr. Gresham
was publishing, broadcast false and defam
atory matter concerning myself and those
whom I represented, administration papers
and members of Congress were, taking the;
charges up and reiterating them and pub
lic opinion was forming. I could not hear
from home, nor obtain denials nor .ex
planations from there for weeks. 7. 7 .
:7, "With regret I was forced by the neces
sities of the situation 7 and the tactics of
the administration to meet them on the
field of .their own choosing, and published
a reply "over my signature to the charges
contained "in the Blount report and the
Gresham letter. 7; No notice was then taken
of the matter by Mr. . Cleveland, \ but,. to
,use an American expression, the adminis
tration 'had no use' for me from that ; time
on. At the same time, 1 addressed an of
ficial protest to Mr. Gresham against the
. ...
suggested restoration of the Queen. No
acknowledgement of or answer thereto was
ever made. I
."On January 25, 1894, I made a state
ment to Mr. Gresham concerning the fric
tion that existed "in Hawaii by reason of
the continued demand by Japan that the
franchise be granted, to Japanese. He
said :
" 'What do you mean by coming to me
with complaints about Japan? Do you
expect us to protect you from Japan ? I
should think that the last country in the
world you would appeal . to for assistance
would be the United States. : It id most
extraordinary that you should make this
statement to me. What do you want me
to do?' etc.
"I replied that I had not applied for as
sistance, nor did I want him to do any
thing; that the United States had for
years followed a certain line of policy con
cerning Hawaii's relations with other for
eign powers; that I was simply stating a
fact, and that 'it was entirely for him to
say whether or not it was of interest to or
concerned American policy interests. He
reiterated his former statements in differ
ent forms several times, and wound up by
branching off from the subject entirely
and demanded what President Dole meant
by sending an 'insulting' reply, to Mr.
Wiilis (refeiring to Mr. Dole's reply to Mr.
Willis' demand that the Queen be re
stored). I denied that the answer was or
was intended to be insulting. Mr. Gres
ham said: 'I say it was insulting, and
Mr. Dole's sole, object was to say some
thing sharp to the American Minister
when he had the opportunity.' He con
tinued to talk in this strain until it became
manifest that he was simply trying to pro
voke a quarrel, and I left the room. â¢ ,7:
"During the summer and fall of 1894 I
was absent in Hawaii and Europe. On
January 7, 1895, I returned to Washington,
and called the next day on Mr. Gresham
to see about presenting my credentials
from the republic of Hawaii, which had
taken the place of the provisional Govern
ment. After stating that they would be
received, he said: 'What did your Gov
ernment, mean by complaining to us that
arms were being shipped from California
to Hawaii?' I replied that I knew of no
such complaint; that I had arrived only
the day before, and knew nothing of it.
He said: 'Yes, they complained to us,
and I have investigated the matter, and
there is not a particle of foundation for it.
They have put us to all this . trouble with
out any reason.' (By a remarkable coin
cidence the insurrection made possible by
the use of these very arms had broken out
the day before, and at that very hour
Charles Carter lay dead in Honolulu, shot
to death with one of the guns which Mr.
Gresham had investigated and found did
not exist.)
"Continuing, Mr. Gresham said: 'I
guess ' your Minister of Foreign Affairs
(Mr. Hatch) is a scary kind of fellow,
isn't he?' I replied: 'No. On the con
trary, he is unusually cool and clear
headed.' He said: 'Well, he acts like it
anyhow. I can see no reason for the com
plaint he maoe. He even put Mr. Willis
to the expense of telegraphing it over
here.' â  . A/-'A.y : / ..
"He continued to talk in this strain j
with an exceeedingly harsh manner until |
I became convinced that he was seeking I
to pick a quarrel with me, as there was no i
occasion for his bringing up the subject, j
of which he knew that I was ignorant.
"Immediately after news, of the insur
rection reached the States," says Mr. i
Thurston, "the cue of the administration i
was to minimize its importance. It was
characterized as a 'little not,' . and ridi- '
culed as 'a tempest in a teapot."- So sedu
lously was this view presented that it ap- j
peared as though it might be generally j
adopted.
"Knowing, as I did, the real seriousness
of the situation and fearing that my Gov
ernment might feel it necessary to impose
extreme penalties upon some of the lead
ers, as a deterrent example for the future,
I saw that if the American public became
impressed that the insurrection was an in
significant affair any severity of punish
ment would cause a reaction of feeling
against us. I accordingly took pains to
give to the press the fullest information
concerning the facts. This I had a perfect
right to do, as the matter was purely do
mestic. The statement made in the press j
that the ground of the request for my re
call was because of my giving to the press
information contained in official dispatches
was without foundation.
"On February 12, 1895, a representative
of one of the press associations, who had
frequently called, came in as I was read
ing the mail received that morning from
Hawaii and made a remark to the effect
that the trouble in Hawaii was 'only a lit
tle fracas,' and did not amount to much.
I replied that he was mistaken; that it
was through no lack of intent on the part
of the royalists that the results were not
worse, and that there was still most in
tense feeling over the matter in Honolulu,
as he could see by the letters I had just
received. I thereupon read to him from
several private letters, not with intent that
he should publish what was read to him,
but to disabuse his mind of a false impres
sion. There was nothing said about pub
lication. There was no intention on my
part that the references in the letters to
the American administration should be
published, and they were not published ;
but the gentlemanly press representative
treasured up such references and commu
nicated them either directly or indirectly
to Mr. Gresham. I understand it has been
denied that this was the avenue of his in
formation. I know that it was, for the
letters to me were shown to no one else
but the newspaper man in question.
"In speaking to me in relation to the
matter later Mr. Gresham 'said, in expla
nation of his possession of the reference:
'Some of our newspaper friends . have
abused . your confidence.' When â '. Mr.
Gresham spoke to me concerning the sub
ject, I gave in substance the following : ex
planation,* saying in connection therewith
that I understood myself to be at liberty
to give out for publication facts concern
ing Hawaii, but that there had been no
such intention in this case.
"In his letter requesting my recall, Mr.
Gresham garbled and suppressed my ex
planation, stating only that I claimed that
the references in question were news
which I had a right to give out.
"I had committed no intentional breach
of diplomatic etiquette: but, knowing the
spirit which animated the administration
toward everything Hawaiian, and desiring
to prevent friction, if possible, I tendered
an apology that the matter had come
through the legation, even inadvertently,
and | even though it had not been pub
lished. Mr. Gresham immediately-re
quested an apology in writing, stating as a
reason that this was a . personal matter be
tween myself and the President and that
he ought to know exactly what I said.
The matter had been presented to me in
formally and I- saw no reason for treating
it otherwise on my part, especially as I did
not know to what use it might be put in
my ; absence and without explanation. I
accordingly declined to make the written
apology requested." .

UTAH'S TWO CHAMPIONS.

FOREIGN POLICY DISCUSSION.
Orators of the Upper House Will
Deliver Speeches Upon the
Monroe Doctrine.
WASHINGTON, D. C M Jan. 26.â The
week beginning to-morrow ends the second
month this Congress has been in session.
Despite the fact that there has been no
holiday recess, but little ha*" been accom
plished, owing largely to consideration in
the Senate of the substitute to the House
bond bill. Although this measure was
speedily disposed of in the House, it has
been the unfinished business of the Senate
for several weeks. The end, however, is
in sight, for on Friday last Jones of Ar
kansas, in charge of the bill, gave notice
that he would ask the Senate to remain in
session Thursday next until the bill was
disposed of. It is hardly likely that a vote
will be reached on that day, as a number
of Senators have expressed their intention
of speaking to the pending substitute, and
time is too short after the morning busi
ness each day has been attended to to per
mit of the delivery of the speeches. It is
probable, however, that before the week is
out a vote will have been taken and the
free-coinage substitute adopted by the
Senate. 'yT/pT.
There can be little doubt as to how the
vote will result. Jones has steadfastly re
fused to agree to a time for a vote until
after the election of the two new Senators
from Utah. They were due to reach this
city at a late hour to-night, and as soon as
their election had been announced Jones
gave the notice to the Senate of his desire
to reach a vote this week. Jones asserts
positively that the free coinage substitute
will be adopted, and he places the major
ity at between five and eight votes.
Incidentally during the week there will
be more or less of discussion on the Mon
roe doctrine resolution reported by the
Committee on Foreign Relations. Thurs
ton of Nebraska, one of the new Senators,
but a man well known in National politics,
has given notice that he will address the
Senate on these resolutions Tuesday, and
a speech of some force is expected from
the Nebraska Senator.
Quite an ' array of talent has been se
cured for the discussion of the 'silver bill
this week, arid ii all the gentlemen who
'have signified their intention are prepare^
to speak promptly, there need be no lag
ging in . the debate. Senator Knute Nel
son of Minnesota will address the Senate
to-morrow. Tillman of South Carolina
will take the floor, according to his pres
ent expectations, Tuesday. It will be bis
maiden speech in the Senate, and the rep
utation of the man at home is such as to
lead to great expectations from him in the
Senate. ''A;/'//

The Secretary of State Replies to
the Letter From California's
Delegation.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Jan Senator
White of California, who has been active
in behalf of John Hays Hammond, the
American engineer under arrest in the
Transvaal, called upon Secretary Olney
yesterday, urging prompt action in the
case by the United States. After the de
parture of .Senator White the cable mes
sage from Consular Agent Manion at
Johannesburg was received.
Secretary Olney then dictated a letter to
the Senator, acknowledging the receipt of
a communication from the California dele
gation and also calling attention to the
Manion dispatch. The letter was as fol
lows:
Stephen If. UTiife, United States Senateâ My
Dear Sib: I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of a letter of the 24th inst. signed
by yourself and the rest of the California dele
gation in Congress.
You will obtain through the papers by the
time this letter reaches you the latest informa
tion I have from, the Transvaal relating to
Americans recently arrested there. I under
stand the Americans are all amply represented
by counsel of their own selection. It appears
the preliminary examination of the Americans
is to take place toward the end of this month.
The question of additional counsel may, 1
think, therefore be left until the results of the
preliminary hearings are known and the
Americans themselves express some opinion
upon the subject. You will observe by another
telegram that the American prisoners paroled,
with the exception of Hammond, are allowed
to use the telegraph. Respectfully yours,
Richard Olney.
The Masons of California have taken a
hand in a general effort to establish com
munication between John Hays Ham
mond and his brother in San Francisco.
This was in response to a suggestion from
members of the Masonic order all over the
country, of which order the imprisoned
: mining engineer is a member. The steps
â¢ taken are shown in the following telegram,
which was received in this city Saturday:
Nevada City. Cal., January 25.
Hon. Richard Olney, Secretary of State, Wash
ington: John Hammond and other Masons are
imprisoned in Africa. Believe all messages to
and from there are Intercepted by the Boer
Government. Will you secure assurance that
my cablegram, will be delivered to them ? We
desire to communicate with them as American

The Chronicle will say that Mr. Cham
berlain's admission that Great Britain does
not wish an inch of territory in America

PHILIP RIPLEY IS DEAD
He Won Fame As a Correspon
dent During the War of
the Rebellion.
A Single Friend Left to Claim the
Remains of the Veteran
Writer.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. Philip
Ripley, at one time possibly one of the
most widely known newspaper men in the
country, died shortly before midnight last
night at the Bellevue Hospital.
The deceased was in his 69th year. He
was born in Hartford, Conn., and was
educated at Trinity School in that place.
Shortly after his graduation he started in
the newspaper business and was first em
ployed by Washington journals.
When the war broke out he was detailed
to New Orleans as war correspondent for a
half-dozen most prominent newspapers in
the country. He is said to have furnished
the most authentic accounts of the battles
of the rebellion.
Several years after the war he came to
New York, and since then had been em
ployed on many newspapers in this city.
He was closely affiliated with all the old
time newspaper men, notably Horace
Greeley, and for a period of years wrote
the famous editorials which were printed
over the name "Hurlburt."
There is no one now to claim his re
mains, as far as is known, but a minister
of Connecticut. Before Ripley died he
told his physician to send word to Rev.
Mr. Starr, Newington Junction, Hartford
County, Conn., which was done. The
cause of his death was Bright's disease.

WILLIAM'S ERRATIC COURSE.
The Prince Says 111-Health Is Re
sponsible for Many of the
Emperor's Acts.
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 28. â Thre
times within the past week rumors weie
in circulation in Berlin that Prince Bis
marck was dead. These reports had the
effect to cause a rush of inquiries" to Fried
richsruhe to learn the truth. Among the
large number of visitors whom the Prince
received personally, and with such cour
tesy and activity of movement as to dispel
the last vestige of anxiety concerning his |
health, was an old and intimate friend and
co-worker in the political arena, who has
given to The United Press the substance of
an interesting conversation he had with
the ex-Chancellor which serves to correct
certain impressions upon the public mind
in regard to Prince Bismarck's relations
with the Kaiser.
Not once since his resignation of the
office of Chancellor, Prince Bismarck said
to his friend, has the Emperor spoken to
him upon the subject of politics, except
upon the memorable occasion of the
Kaiser's visit to Friedricbsruhe on March
23 last, when his Majesty came to the ex-
Chancellor's residence with General Count
yon Waldersee. The Emperor was at the
time very angry about the vote in the
Reichstag refusing to pay the united re
spects of that body to the Prince upon the
occasion of his birthday. Prince Bis
marck admitted to his friend that he was
well able to go to Berlin on January 18,
when the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
founding of the empire was celebrated,
but he did not go because he emphatically
declined to lend his name as a flag for the
present course of politics, which is being
directed upon lines which the ex-Chan
cellor regards as radically wrong and of
which he profoundly disapproves.
It was a move of rare cleverness on the
part of the Emperor, the Prince said, to
make a spontaneous call at Friedricbsruhe
recently, thereby creating at home and
abroad the impression that the imperial
policy had the full approval of Prince Bis
marck or at least his tacit assent.
Nothing of the kind was true, however.
The recent moves of the Kaiser, he said,
were grave mistakes. Germany had no
business whatever to meddle with foreign
complications unless German interests
were directly menaced or assailed. If the
powers have grouped themselves definitely
either for or against certain causes, what
of it? Germany has still time to decide to
what extent her interests are involved.
The expressions which the Emperor has
sometimes indulged in, the United Press
informant said, must be credited to the
fact that the Kaiser's state of health was
not always normal.
His irritability, caused by worrying and
frequent violent headaches, had quite
often accounted for a quick word or deed
on his part. It may be added, too, that
he slept very littleâ in fact not at all suf
ficiently to enable him to maintain his
health.
The piesent Government of Germany is
deprived of all initiative in the manage
ment or direction of politics. The Em
peror directs everything personally, and
his Ministers and Secretaries of State are
merely his executive officers. Among his
many irresponsible counselors it is al
ways the last one having the ear of the
Kaiser who is charged to see that the ideas
of the Emperor are carried out.
Prince Bismarck's personal organ, the
Hamburger Nachrichten, prints articles
almost daily giving pointed expression to
some of the foregoing views. In an article
published in the Nachrichten last Thurs
day commenting upon the Kaiser's aim
ing to stamp Germany's character as that
of a â¢'Weltmacht"â a power so mighty as
to require a large increase in the navyâ
the paper says:
_ The nation must receive better informa
tion than it has now before accepting t!;e
new position of pursuiug an external pol
icy of might instead of a policy of inter
national development. The country is
not ambitious for foreign enterprises in
order to acquire prestige. The wisest
policy is that of conserving German in
terests.
These sentiments, however, find small
sympathy in the press generally, official
and unofficial. The tide of popular feel
ing continues to run strongly in the direc
tion of Anglophobia. Anything the
Kaiser could do or say to satisfy this feel
ing would receive the hearty acclamation
of all classes. T.he Hamburger Nachrich
ten, although attacking the attitude of the
Emperor in assuming control of the for
eign affairs of the empire, expresses the
hope that England may ere long receive a
thorough lesson in 'regard to her isolation
as a State and her limitations as a power.
The Emperor entertained the' foreign
Embassadors at dinner at the castle on
Thursday. Among the guests present
were United States Embassador Runyon
and Mrs. Runyon, M. Herbette, French
Embassador, and Mme. Herbette; M. de
Szogyeny, Austrian Embassador, and
Mme. de Szogyeny, arid Count Lanza di
Busca, Italian Embassador, and his Count
ess. Sir Frank Lascelies, British Embas
sador, was absent owing to the death of
Prince Henry of Battenberg, and the se
ries of receptions at the British embassy
has been abondoned.
A case affecting. Germans becoming
American citizens has just been decided
by the Supreme Court of the empire in
Leipsic. F. W. Boehme, a druggist, liv
ing in Brooklyn, N. V., and a native of
Leipsic, was sentenced by a lower court to
pay a fine of 200 marks for emigrating to a
foreign country without having fulfilled
his term of military service. He appealed
through his father from the decision of the
court. 888
.The Supreme Court, in rendering its de
cision upon the appeal, finds thatÃoehrae,
as a duly naturalized citizen of the United
States, could not .be punished for an act
committed through his emigration â¢to
America, but that he could be punished
for any act committed prior to his emigra
tion. The court therefore reversed the de
cision of the lower tribunal. If Boehme
had left the country to escape . military
service, the judgment of the Supreme
Court would have been different.
The art event of the past week has been
the production at the Berlin Theater of
Ernest Adam .yon Wildenbruck's new
drama, "King Henry." The play deals
with the period " of Pope Gregory and
King Henry's submission to the Pontiff
in going to Canossa. It is by all odds the
greatest * success a dramatist, has ever
achieved, and the appreciation of the au
dience was manifested by his being called
out a dozen times.
When he came upon the staee he
brought with him Manager Prasch.who had
mounted the play with great splendor and
at a great expense. A sequel to the play,
entitled "Kaiser Heinrich" will be pro
duced in February. - ">â¢

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 26.â A dispatch
from Springfield, Mo., says: Adolphus
Busch, the St. Louis brewer, was solicited
by President Fuller Drury College to
give $1000 to the Pearson endowment fund,
which he did. Then there was a gentle
protest against accepting it, and President
Fuller in open chapel denounced the pub
lication" of reports about the affair and paid
a high tribute to Mr. Busch. The latter
in the meantime instructed his agent here
to investigate and see if his gift was op
posed, and if so to withdraw it.
Friday night a secret meeting of stu
dents was held and a committee ap
pointed to visit President Fuller, express
their disapproval of the gift, and ask him
to call a mass-meeting of the students.
This request was refused, but the students
met, anyway, and protested.
When the stndents went to chapel high
on the ceiling was seen the beer sign of W.
J. Lemp, and under the flaming letters
the words, "Put me down for $1000, too."
Mr. Busch will probably withdraw his
gift. , . â¢ â¢

A SCHWEINFURTH
AT SALT LAKE
Israel Dennis and His So-
Called Heaven" Come
to Grief.
CAUGHT AFTER FLIGHT.
Husbands of Women Whom He
Victimized Cause His
Arrest.
HE HAD POSED AS A DEITY.
Fled With Three Female Converts,
but Was Captured and
Brought Back.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 26.â About six
months ago a man named Israel F. Dennis
appeared in Salt Lake from nobody knows
where. He claimed to be an incarnation
of the Deity and to be the possessor of all
the attributes of the Almighty.
He was looked upon as a harmless crank
and nobody paid much attention to him
at first. He erected a large tent in the
outskirts of the city and commenced
preaching, and after a time drew consid
erable audiences, chiefly of the more ig
norant class.
Dennis taught that he had come as the
ravior of mankind and a peculiar tenet of
his doctrine was that thousands of women
should set themselves apart or be spirit
ually sealed to him.
He did not succeed in getting women in
the numbers that he wished, but it now
appears that he duped quite a few, and
several married women without the knowl
edge of their husbands became converts to
hi? faith.
Investigation by the officers of the law
shows that Dennis had established a little
colony patterned after that of the notori
ous Schweinfurth of Rockford, 111. He
had a dozen or more women who either
lived with him or visited very frequently
at his place, and the affair lias grown to
tbe proportions of a public scandal.
On Saturday a warrant for Dennis' ar
rest was issued on a serious charge upon
information laid by W. T. Robinson, who
avers that Dennis has robbed him of his
wife. He was accused of other offenses, in
connection with which married women
were mentioned.
Dennis fled with Mrs. Robinson, a Mrs.
Vivian and his own wife. They were cap
tured at Manti. about thirty miles from
this city, to-night, brought back and placed
in juil. Dennis denies the charges, says
his kingdom is a spiritual one and that he
is establishing a celestial heaven on earth.
THE SACRAMENTO RAGING.
Breaks in the Levees That May
Divert the River From
Its Channel.
The Yolo Basin Bank Full and a
Swift Current Is Still
Rushing In.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., Jan. 26.-E. E.
Leake, Commissioner of Public "Works,
and Engineer Pearson, with party of other
gentlemen, made a trip up the Sacra
mento River to-day as far as the mouth of
the Feather River in a naphtha launch for
the purpose of examining the breaks in
the levees. It was found that near Ver
non, where the worst break exists, an
enormous volume of water is leaving the
river and is flowing through the Yolo
basin.
At this point not only are the levees
pone entirely, but the water has cut
through to the bedrock and is wearing a
channel into the tules which, if not
checked, will eventually result in the Sac
ramento River being almost entirely di
verted from its channel and put a stop to
navigation, as in the Yolo basin the water
spreads over such a wiuth of territory that
it would be simply impossible to get depth
enough for traffic steamers to ply.
Out in the Yolo basin the water is higher
than it has been in years and is flowing in
a current fully a rapid as the body of
water in the river proper. To a certain
extent the breaks in the levee have as yet
acted beneficially, inasmuch as they have
served as a conduit for the extra water in
the river, and in this way have averted all
danger from a levee overflow in this local
ity or flood to the city. "77 .
Nor has the damage to the reclaimed
lands up and down the river as yet been
great, but owing to the fact that the Yolo
basin has as much water as it : can con
veniently retain if the present storm con
tinues there can be no possible doubt but
that the frail back levees which protect
the reclaimed districts must give way and
that will mean untold damage and dis
aster.
It is stated . that a warm rain is falling'
high up in the snow belt and that the
snow is melting rapidly. This will in
crease the volume of "water in the Feather
River which has been receding the past
few days and again tend to obstruct rail
road traffic, and will also insure great
damage to the reclaimed districts.
MINING BOOM AT PLACERVILLE.
Gold Washed Oxit Everxjwhere by the Tot
rentsâExcited Citizens. : - *
PLACERVILLE, Cat.., Jan. 26.-The
rainfall of the season reaches twenty-five
inches. To-night it is pouring in torrents.
The temperature is sixty degrees.
The rain has been a boon not only to
ranchers and miners, but to individuals
by scores, who during cessation of the
rains are scrapine gravel from the * wagon
tracks in the -sloping streets of the town
and gathering fine and coarse gold.
On the road north to Kelsey men pan
ning from -the ruts of highways realize
from four to twelve bits per day, "
On the road south through Diamond
Springs and El Dorado and on the road
from Diamond, by and beyond the Larkin
mine, following quartz seams and stringers,
men are panning from the road tracks and
road ditches as much as $3 per day.
The proposition is again renewed ask
ing leave to work the main street of Placer
ville, offering to. macadamize it in lieu of
the ground to be carted away and washed
for the gold it contains.
All outgoing roads in every direction
are lined with whites, Chinese and negroes,
searching and finding gold in the wagon '
tracks found after the-heavy rains. Ex
citement runs high and the gold craze
growing among men, women and children
of Placerville and vicinity is recalling the
days of forty-nine.

CRIME AT SACRAMENTO.
Fatal Termination of a Mas
querade at the William
Tell House.
One Man Killed, Another Shot in the
Leg and a Third in Jail
Charged With Murder.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 26.â There
was a sad ending to a night's revelry in
this city this morning and the result is
that Hugo Klaas occupies a marble slab
in the morgue, Joseph Hedeger is suffer
ing from a bullet wound in the left leg,
and John Hurley, one of the most popular
young men around town, is locked up in
the city prison, slated for murder.
Last night the proprietors of the William j
Tell House, a German hotel on J street, !
tendered a masquerade ball to their I
friends and patrons and the dance j
continued until morning. About 6 j
o'clock a party of well-known young \
men, among whom were George
Hilbert, Ed Hilbcrt, Bert Ripley, Frank j
Stover and John Hurley, were invited to j
enter the hotel barroom by August Coolet, j
whose father owns the property, Cooiet I
making the remark, it is stated, that he
was expected to spend some money.
There were drinks ordered, over which, j
it is claimed, a dispute started, ending in I
a free fight. The young men were ejected j
from the barroom, and being followed and j
hard pressed by some of the excited revel- j
ers, Hurley drew his revolver and began
shooting. '
He fired three times, the first bullet !
lodging in Hedeger's leg, the second i
passed through the door of the saloon
without hitting any one, while the third
passed through the door and struck Hugo j
Klaas, a boarder in the hotel who was
coming downstairs to breakiast, directly
in the center of the abdomen, severing the
intestines in ten places.
By this time Policemen Logue and
Hasans arrived and placed the party of
young men under arrest. Klaas was con
veyed to a private hospital, where he died
a few hours later. .
The unfortunate man was born in Ger
many and was 35 years of age.
He came to America several years ago
and was located in San Francisco, where
he married. Klaas was a cawgrinder by
occupation, and had separated from his
wife. He shortly afterward went to Kan
sas City, where he met a young woman |
named Fay Underwood, and on his return j
to Sacramento a correspondence ensued j
between them.'
"When Klaas received a paper stating !
that his wife had procured a divorce, ' he j
wrote and proposed to Miss Underwood
who accepted him. Yesterday Klaas re- '
ceived the following telegram :
Left Denver to-day. Sleet me in Sacramento
Wednesday at the depot. Fay Underwood.
Hurley is without doubt one of the most
popular young men in Sacramento, and
the jail has been crowded all day with a
multitude of friends who have called to
tender him their aid in his trouble.
SUNDAY MORNING FIGHT.
City Attorney Rrotcn Roughly Handled
by a Gang of Revelers.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 2d.â There
was a general fight at an early hour Sun
doy morning at the corner of Fourth and
X streets, and City Attorney J. Frank
Brown, who was going home from his
office, attempted to interfere and preserve
the peace.
While separating two of the combatants
he was seized from behind by others of the
crowd. He wrenched himself away and
drew his revolver and the crowd scattered
and ran.
A few seconds later the fight recom
menced and the City Attorney again in
terfered and commanded peace. Dur
ing his efforts to separate the men, Cook
stole his revolver from his pocket and one
of the bystanders informed Mr. Brown of
the fact. ypp-z/r-
At this moment Policeman Maley ar
rived and captured Cook. While endeavor
ing to lake the pistol from his possession
Cook threatened to shoot Maley and the
officer drew his own pistol and knocked
him down.
Cook and a companion who had been
captured by the attorney were conveyed
to the police station and charged with dis
turbing the peace.

STABBED AND LACERATED.
Result of One Man Visiting Another's
Sister-in-Luw.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 26.â Nels
Carlson was stabbed in the left breast in
the region of the heart and had both his
hands severely cut this evening during a
fracas which occurred in the residence of
Isaac Pearson on Second, between P and
Q streets.. y
Carlson's story is that he has been in the
habit of visiting a sister-in-law of Pearson
and the latter objected to. his presence in
his residence.
This evening Carlson 7; called and was
sitting in the parlor chatting with . the
family when Pearson entered and with
the remark, "Yoivhere again V You' seem
to be living here altogether, ' r drew a knife
from his pocket and attacked Carlson.
At the first blow struck the knife: hit a
rib in the region of the heart and glanced,
otherwise Carlson would probably not be
alive to tell his story. *-
In the struggle which ensued Carlson's
hands % were fearfully lacerated. Pearson
was disarmed and placed under arrest by
Policeman ,Ash and Carlson's wounds
were dressed in the Receiving Hospital.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, ISCC.
SANTA CLARA'S
BIG WRECK
Accident Blamable to the
* Narrow-Gauge Train's
Engineer.
STORY OF THE FIREMAN.
Kohlhoff, the Flagman, Gave the
Proper Signal, but Was
Not Heeded.
THE DISTANCE MISCALCULATED.
Stanley Thought He Could Cross, but
Discovered His Mistake When
Too Late.
â  '. . â  â 
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 26.âThe crossing
of the broad and narrow-guage railroad
tracks at Santa Clara, where a part of Sat
urday's wreck was still in evidence, was
visited by throng*! of the curious to-day.
By daylight the tracks were all clear for
traffic, the wreckage having been removed
from the track by use 'of powerful der
ricks. The overturned signal box was still
where it had been thrown by the force of
the collision, but for some reason the
semaphore, whose iron arm pointed across
the narrow-gauge track at the time of the
accident, had been removed.
Ernest Kohlhoff, the flagman, was at his
usual place at the crossing, and went qui
etly about his duties. When asked to
make a statement he replied:
"You've had it already. 1 signaled the
narrow-gauge train to stop, hut instead of
stopping it came right on. Where the
engineer made his mistake I don't know."
The statement made by Kohlhoff con
tradicts the allegation that the flagman
made .contradictory signals. Kohlhoff
insists that be made but one signal to En
gineer Stanley of the narrow-gauge train
and that was for him to stop. Henry
Wetzel, fireman for Stanley on the narrow
gauge engine, made a statement to a per
sonal friend in Santa Clara that the flag
man gave the proper signal.
"Stanley thought he could make the
crossing," said Wetzel, ''and kept going
ahead. He soon saw that he couldn't
make it and tried to 'pull up, but it was
too late. As soon as I saw that the trains
were going to mix up I jumped off. The
engineer had plenty of opportunity to
jump, and I don't know why he didn't,
unless he thought that he could stop the
engine before it struck the other train."
C. C. Ingalls, the Gilroy orchardist, who
was injured internally by being thrown
against. a seat, was visited yesterday by
Dr. J. E. Trueman, one of the regularly
employed surgeons of the Southern Pa
cific Company. Dr. Trueman stated that
Ingalls' principal injury consists of the
laceration of the inner tissues of the abdo
minal wall. Serious complications may
result, but even under the most favorable
circumstances Ingalls will be confined to
his home for several weeks.

ACCLIMATIZATION ASSOCIATION.
The First Annual Meeting of the Organ
izatiotua Great Success.
SAN JOSE, Cat.., Jan. 26.âThe first an
nual meeting of the Central California Ac
climatization Association was held yester
day afternoon in Judge Lorigan's court
room, President F. E. Spencer presiding.
Secretary Mackenzie read the list of
members^ of the executive committees of
the various counties, showing that there
had been two additions and one change
since the original list was published. W.
H. Lawrence and George W. Lovie are
additional members of the San Mateo
committee, and Frank L. Robinson suc
ceeds A. P. Stanton on the Santa Cruz
committee.
The secretary's report showed that much
had been accomplished and altogether
was of an encouraging nature.
San Benito and Monterey counties were
admitted into the association, and the by
laws were amended so as to admit any
other county that desired to come in. It
is understood that Contra Costa County
has expressed a desire to join the organiz
ation.
The sum of $10 was appropriated to pur
chase such seed grasses as are the natural
food of the birds to be imported.
Game Warden Mackenzie stated that A.
C. Robinson, a dealer in San Francisco,
had presented the society with a few car
dinals and nightingales. "He also reported
that he would have $300 on hand by next
Wednesday. Of the list of birds to be se
| cured not one is destructive to fruit. All
i except two are songbirds. The exceptions
I are birds of fine plumage.
S. H. Farmer of Gilroy stated he had
! once secured thirty-five dozen Eastern
I quail from Tennessee, but they all died
off in a short time. He thought, however,
I that pheasants will do well in this section.
The adjournment was taken to meet at
the call of the president.
The number of pheasants in captivity in
{ this county at the present date is 125 pairs.
I There will be twenty-five more pairs im
i ported shortly, and all of the birds will be
j libeiated about the Ist of March.

Call Issued for a Mass- Meeting to Dis
-77 ,v: cuss Needs of the Industry.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 26.â A mass
meeting of the fruit-growers of Santa Clara
county has been called to meet at Turn
Verein Hall on Saturday, February 8, for
the purpose of discussing ways and means
for extending the market and creating a
demand for Santa Clara County" fruit pro
ducts;-- ' ....*'
The call, which is signed by a large num
ber of prominent fruit-growers, says:
The necessity of earnest, deliberate
efforts in the line of market extension is
conceded by ail intelligent fruit-growers.
In 1895, with a crop below an average
for the bearing acreage, with no for
eign competition, with an export de
mand of some magnitude, and fruit
of the best quality ever produced by us,
the supply appears to. be amply suffi
cient to meet the wants of trade and con
sumption. It is believed by many, and it
is approximately true, that but one-half
of the: planted acreage is in bearing. It
must be remembered that the prune crop
of 1894 was more than three times as large
as that of 1890, and that of 1897 or 1898
will be three times that of 1894, or upward
Of 100,000,000 pounds.

THE HOLLEY DIVORCE.
Report of Commissioner Montgomery on
the Testimony Taken.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 26.âCommis
sioner Montgomery to-day filed his report
of the testimony taken in the suit of
Fanny H. Holley against Daniel Holley
on the ground of desertion. They were
married in this city on May 12, 1887, and
lived together for one year, at the end of
which time HolJey deserted his wife.
Holley had spent the major portion of
his life on cattle ranges as a vaquero and
his wife could give no other reason for his
unceremonious departure than that he
found city life distasteful and preferred
the rough lite of a cow-puncher. There
are no children and no community prop
erty, and all the wife asks is an absolute
divorce.
BALLS FERRY HOMICIDE
Rancher Lansdale of Shasta
â¢ County Shot From Ambush
and Killed.
Slain Without Warning While Riding
Along the Road With a Com
panion.
REDDING, Cal., Jan. 26.â A message
was received by the Coroner, Joseph H.
Earnest, yesterday evening, stating that a
man was drowned at Balls Ferry, a small
village on the Sacramento River in the
southern part of this county and about
eight miles from Anderson and twenty
miles from this place. . "77: 7
On reaching there the Coroner found
that Pope Landsdale, who lives near Balls
Ferry, had been shot by George M. Wright,
who lives in Tehama County, just across
the line of this county and about two
miles south of Balls Ferry. On learning
the facts he sent a messenger to this city
for the officers. >' v 7**
The facts of the killing as related by the
messenger are: Landsdale and a young
man named George Riggans were riding
along the highway leading out of Balls
Ferry to the south. While about a mile
from town and while passing a barn near
the road Wright, who was secluded in the
barn, shot at Landsdale several times with
a Henry rifle, literally riddling his body.
He then told Riggans that he had a no
tion to shoot him, for being with Lands
dale, but Riggans rode away and was not
attacked. 777 77/
Landsdale was well known throughout
this county, being a man of considerable
means, but of a hard character. He leaves
a widow and large family of grown-up chil
dren. He owned considerable stock and
property, and was noted for being engaged
in many lawsuits. Though not a lawyer
he often pleaded his own cases. It is said
that he once killed a man in Tehama
County. ":<â '' .; -y
Wright is a resident of Tehama County,
and little is known of him here. It is said
that he goes by the name of "Three-fin
gered George." Constable M. Eidridge
left for Balls Ferry evening to take
charge of the murderer.
Two Prisoners Taken to Folsom.
REDDING, Cal., Jan. 26.â John W.

Lee Doon, a Condemned Murderer,
Claimed He Saw the Ghost Almost
Every Night.
. SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Jan. 26.â There is
a ghost which haunts the courthouse and
particularly the county jail, which is situ
ated in the basement of Marin County's
temple, of justice. The apparition made
its appearance this week and terrified
Emilio Morales who occupies on of the
cells in the jail.
Morales is one of the half-breeds who
robbed Megetti & Cheta's store at Mar
shall and is being held to answer before
the Superior Court for burglary.
Friday morning when Sheriff Henry
Harrison unlocked the cell in which
Morales was confined he found the half
breed in a terrified state, with beads of
persoiration standing upon his forehead
and speechless with fright.
| Morales said that ho had seen the ghost
and he threatened to commit suicide if the
Sheriff put him in tbe same cell again.
The strange part of the circumstance lies
in the fact that Morales has never been in
the jail before and has never heard of the
stories about the courthouse ghost.
It seems that some years ago a man
named William Argo, discouraged and
disheartened at the idea of going to San
Quentin, hanged himself in the cell that
Morales occupied, and ever since , that
time the spirit of William Argo returns to
terrify the poor hobo who may be locked
up in the haunted jail.
At one time the ghost appeared nightly,
but gradually his visits grew less fre
quent, and for about a year he did not turn
up, until he paid Morales a visit.
James H. Wilkins, Marin County's mem
ber of the Assembly, says: "I remember
well the effect the specter bad on Lee
Doon, the convicted murderer of W. M.
Shenton. "When he was first sentenced to
be hanged he disliked the idea of it ex
tremely, as most every one does, and it
seemed almost impossible to brace him up.
"Sheriff Harrison dropped in four or five
times a day to give him the glad hand and
assure him that it would be over in a min
ute, without cheering him in the slightest.
I'inot of the Parisian House brought him
the choicest efforts of the French cuisine,
but he pushed aside the untasted dishes
and said he wasn't hungry.
"Under Sheriff Fallon dropped in and
asked him to write his name in his auto
graph album of eminent personages, but
the ungracious Mongol merely told him
to !go to the devil. Then Coroner Eden
called and measured him for the finest
coffin that money could buy, and even
that didn't comfort him. He was the
hardest man to encourage that the officers
ever had anything to do with.
"Ail of a sudden, however, Argo's ghost
began making calls on the condemned
man and then he straightway took a
different view, of mortality. '-, He even
asked the Sheriff if he couldn't hurry
things up a little.
"He told that official that the apparition
seated itself on his bunk every night and
worried and tormented him so with its
speechless vigil, that he nearly went crazy
by daybreak. When the fatal time arrived
Lee Doon was perfectly ready to go." ;*-;'

Salmon Are Being Speared in the Marin
Coxtnty Creeks.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Jan. 26.â Salmon
are being speared in the creeks near San

ably be sent to the ' Fish Commissioners'
calling their attention to the fact.Â£-?> r V
The greater amount of this spearing,

SONOMA COUNTY'S OUTPUT
Canneries and Wineries of Wind
sor and Healdsburg Are
Nearly Empty.
Heaviest Shipments of the Season
Made From Those Towns
â¢ Last Saturday.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., Jan. 26,â
heaviest canned goods shipment of the
season .was made from the Russian River
cannery in this place yesterday, when
eleven carloads were started East.
This last shipment makes a total for the
year of fifty-two carloads, and moves all
the pack of 1895. It has been many years
since the canneries of this town have been
so empty. Not over 500 cases out of a total
of 80,000 packed last season remain un
sold." ' T 4'TAyJ./Tp- r /.. â /;'' A. . -.7/--
Last spring when the canneries opened
for business much of the pack of 1894 re
mained unsold, and as a result operations
were lighter than usual. .
This spring both canneries will be en
larged, so that a busy .year 7i*-, looked for.
The greater portion of , the fruit ; produced
in this district in 1895 was dried, and
much yet remains unsold. -**â *,
.J. D. Bosch, manager of the i California
Wine Association's plant at Wind
sor, *in this county, informed a Call
representative to - day that;, heavy ship
ments of sweet wine would be made from
now on; and that by the : next wine-mak
ing season; every gallon of ; wine in; the
mammoth cellars will be moved. - .-
From ope to four carloads of wine are
shipped from Northern Sonoma every day,
much of which is going to Eastern cities^
and all sold at advanced prices.
The result of the improvement in the
wine business is noticeable on all sides.
New vineyards are being planted and old
ones grafted to resistants. The demand
for vineyard lands is picking up and
several real estate transfers are reported.
BIG RUN OF SALMON.
Warm Springs Creek Near Healdsburg, \
â  Literally. Alive With Them.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., Jan. 26. âEd j
Jagoe, who came .in from his Skaggs |
Springs ranch this morning, says that
salmon are running up Warm Springs \
Creek in large numbers.
Mr. Jagoo said: "I had to ford the j
stream eight times in coming to town, and
at every crossing I could see large num
bers of salmon splashing in the waters. â¢
â¢ "At Big Falls you could see them leap
ing about trying to get over. If I had
tried I could have captured many."
Farmers living along the mountain
streams all tell the same story. â¢ They say
the run of salmon is the heaviest in years.
The arrest of Healdsburgers for violating
the fish ordinance has resulted in stopping !
seining and gigging of salmon, so that
trout will be plentiful this season.
FLOODS AT HEALDSBURG.
Bridges and Roads in the District Con- j
â  siderably Damaged.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., Jan. 26.â The re
cent heavy rains have done considerable
damage to roads and bridges in this dis
trict. 7'"7f .'â  'â -,
The Stewart's Point road has caved in in
many places, and it is reported to-day that
the board bridge crossing Dry Creek, ten
miles north of here, has gone out. This
bridge was destroyed by the high water
last winter and was rebuilt in the same
place against the protest of a large num
ber of taxpayers.
THE JUNTA IS STIRRING.
Preparations for the Primary to
Elect the New Com
mittee.
Arrangements to Be Made To-Night by
Those in Charge of the
Election.
. Things are livening up in the Junta. As
the impending dissolution of the present
general committee approaches there is be
ginning to be some interesting speculation
upon the probable results of the primary
in the latter part of next month. It is a
sort 'of pleasurable speculation, too, for
the junta people are not greatly concerned
about anything in the line of disturbing
incidents. They appear to have settled
down with the assurance that the only
possible changes in the present committee
will not exceed in numbers the strength
of a district delegation. By seme mis
chance they admit the number might run
over twenty-five, but it cannot reach be
yond thirty. If the prediction be credited
the general committee will be pretty much
the same after the primary as it is now.
Secretary McGovern was busy last night
mailing cards to the gentlemen on the
primary committee and to the chairmen
and secretaries of the district clubs. The j
primary committee is to meet in the Flood
building to-night. There are twenty-five ;
of them, eighteen representing as many
districts and others selected at large. They
will determine upon a date for the primary
election for members of a new general
I committee and in a general way make
arrangements for the holding of it. It has
already been suggested that the date for
the primary be February 24, ana it is quite
likely, that the committee will act upon
that suggestion. â¢.. .. ,X-
The meeting of chairmen and secretaries
of , the district organizations has been
ordered for to-morrow night. The idea in
having these officers come together is to
more completely perfect arrangements for
the primary. The action of the district of
, ficers will depend entirely upon the work
done by the primary committee to-night.
This committee's report will be received,
and from the recommendations in it some
line of concerted operation will be decided
upon. It is probable that the committee
will decide to request Denman and Wellin,
the former Election Commissioners, to
name the officers of election for the dis
tricts. It was understood that they should
do this part of the work when they be
came members of the commission, and
now, though they are out of it, the Junta
id desirous that they confer such a favor.
The headquarters of the Junta were not
abundantly filled last night. Gavin Mo-
Nab was around rather early and chatted
with Secretary McGovern until Max Pop
per happened in. Colonel Sullivan and
Sammy Braunhart were expected, but they
failed to get around. Popper and McNao
had a long talk over the arrangement of
details for primary successes, and that was
about all the Democratic party of San
Francisco did in the Flood building last
night. ;A,;7 7 : y zT/;/^
The members of the primary committee
which is to meet to-night are as follows,'
in the order of their districts, beginning j
with the Twenty-eighth: T. A. Itottanzi,
August Tillman, T. Fitzoatrick, ' James
Ginty, Frank Lester, George Godfrey,

FORECLOSURE
Surprised at Estee's Stand
in His Drafted
Memorial.
HE STOPPED TOO SHORT.
Says the Napa Statesman Was
Put on the Committee by
Courtesy.
TO CALL A MEETING TO-DAY.
The Mayor Expresses Himself Strongly
â  in Regard to the Duty of the
Executive.
"I named the committee to prepare a
memorial to Congress against re-funding
the railroad debt, and Mr. Estee was placed
upon it by courtesy."
It was Mayor Sutro who used these
words yesterday in a conversation on the
subject of memorials that have been pre
pared by members of the committee and
which were published yesterday morning.
"I have seen the three memorials," said
the Mayor, "and they are strong and care
fully prepared documents. That of Mr.
Estee is a strong argument, but it falls
short of the intent of the resolutions
adopted at the convention. That conven
tion in adopting the resolutions it did
meant what was conveyed irf them, and
that is opposition to the re-funding of the
railroad debt and in favor of the foreclos
tire of the mortgage. That was the wish
of the convention and it is the wish of
ninety-nine out of every hundred of the
people of this Stateâ yes, the wish of nine
hundred and ninety-nine out of every
thousand.
"I am at a loss to understand the mo
tive that prompted Mr. Estee not to incor
porate that in the memorial he drew up.
It was his duty to incorporate it in accord
ance with those resolutions. You know
that I named the committee to prepare a
memorial to Congress against re-funding
the railroad debt and Mr. Estee was
placed upon it by courtesy.
"The memorial Mr. Estee prepared has
at the bottom of it the names of Caminetti,
Davie, Cannon and Gibson, but they did
not sign it. In fact nothing has been done
yet. No memorial has been signed by the
committee.
"To-morrow I shall call the committee
together and then the whole matter will
be discussed, and I shall take the stand
that the legislative branch of the Govern
ment has no right to act in the matter,
that it has no right to interfere in vested
rights and that that right rests only in the
judiciary. The Government of the United
States is divided into three branchesâ the
legislative, the judiciary and the executive. i
When the legislative branch has per
formed an act, there its duty ceases, so far
as that act is concerned. If there is any
question about that act it is not within
the power of the legislative body to review
its action, but it falls to the judiciary to
pass upon it, and it is the duty of the ex
ecutive to see that the judiciary passes
upon it.
"That Is exactly the position of this
railroad debt. The railroad cannot, or
will not, pay its debts and the mortgage
must be foreclosed. It is the duty of Presi
dent Cleveland to instruct the Attorney-
General to commence an action in fore
closure and in that way- bring the whole
matter before the judicial branch, so that
it may he determined by the highest
authority in the land; and the legislative
branch l mean Congress has nothing
whatever to say in the matter. In this
position I am supported by the opinions
of such men as Judge Woodworth, who
lor seventeen years was Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania; Ly
man Trumbull of Illinois and Edmunds
of Vermont and other attorneys as promi
nent as these. Why. there is not a lawyer
in the land who knows anything about
law who will not agree with these gentle
men. I have had experience in Washing
ton in regard to matters of this character
and know that Congress has no right
whatever to interfere.
"I repeat it," said the Mayor, emphati
cally, "the legislative branch of the Gov
ernment has no right to interfere with the
plain duty of the executive, which is to
order this matter brought before the ju
diciary. That is the stand I shall take at
the meeting to-morrow and which I shall
maintain to the end. At tbat meeting we
shall find out if the gentlemen named
signed or indorse Mr. Estee's memorial.
Caminetti and Gibson, I believe, are all
right in favor of foreclosure, but Estee
Davie and Cannon I think are endeavoring
to evade the purpose of the convention and
the unmistakable language of the resolu
tions.
"If Congress should act in this matter
and pass a measure giving relief to the
railroad it will do so in violation of the
constitution, and if it does that there
might as well be an end to government.
The people demand, and they have the
right to do so, that the railroad people like
any other people pay their debts to the
Government, and that if they do not do so
the law be invoked against them."
THE STORM AT THE BEACH
How the Bellowing Seals on the
Rocks Gave Warning of
Its Approach.
__________ Â»
Lightning, Thunder and Rain Surprise
Pedestriansâ Sutro Elec
tric Road.
The Cliff House was opened for business
yesterday, but the formal opening has been
postponed until some time next month.
The men who have been selected to
operate the Sutro electric line have been
notified to report for duty at 6 o'clock this
morning. During the past week a number
of cars were run over the entire line and
everything was found to work in a satis
factory manner.
Respite the weather yesterday there was
an immense number of people at the beach
in the afternoon, drawn there by a desire
to see bow the ocean looks on a stormy
day. Those who were fortunate enough to
bÂ«_on the broad porches of the newyjiQ
House between 3:15 and 5 o'clock, pro
tected from the wind and rain by the im
mense windows that surround them, wit
nessed an imposing spectacle.
Shortly after 3 o'clock the spectators
watching the seals on the rocks heard
their bellowing and then noticed them
hurriedly leave the rocks and leap into the
breakers that were rolling high against the
tall piles on which the kings and queens of
the deep had been rolling.
"That," said an elderly man who moved
about with a swaying gait and who had
the appearance of an old salt, "is a sign
that there's a storm a-coming, and pretty
blamed soon. When you see them crit
ters a-diving into the water you'd better
take in sail. It's a sure sign and beats
them fellers in the Mills building all hol
low."
As he was speaking the seals moved
waterward, theskv, which had been fairly
clear, darkened suddenly, there was a
blinding flash of lightning and a roar of
distant ~ thunder, the wind rose and the
high-crested waves chased one another
rapidly until they broke upon the shore or
lashed the rocks and sent their white
foam thirty or forty feet high.
A small coasting steamer was seen in
the distance ploughing through the angry
billows and making very slow headway
toward the Golden Gate. The darkness
increased, the ocean became obscured
from view by a heavy dark-gray foe and
there was another and more vivid flash,
quickly followed by another.
At that moment there were a hundred
people, men and women, on the grade that
leads to the cliff, moving to and from that
eminence, and the wind that was blowing
from the southwest made walking de
cidedly unpleasant. A few drops of rain
fell, and as ltjwas impossible to raise um
brellas there was a scurrying for the shel
ter of the new building and for the depot,
but before either could be reached the
storm broke in all its fur}', the force of the
wind increased, the rain came down from
all directions in great drops that struck
the face of the pedestrians with such force
they were compelled to close their eyes.
It was a blinding rain that fell with the
violence of hail, and was drenching, as the
unfortunates who were caught in it dis
covered. While this was heaviest the
lightning continueu to flash and there was
a peal of low rumbling thunder that con
tinued for fifteen seconds.
The 4 o'clock train that left the Park
and Ocean depot for the City carried away
the most thoroughly drenched load of
passengers ever seen on cars.
STORM ON THE FRONT.
A Heavy Downpour of Rainâ Two
Ships Bound Westward Re
turn to Harbor.
The wind blew briskly from the south
east most all day yesterday, but the heavy,
continuous downpour of rain kept the bay
comparatively smooth. Toward night the
wind veered around to the westward, and
blew moderately from that direction dur
ing the night.
In the forenoon the British ship Law
hill was towed to sea by the tug Fearless.
When out between the heads the captain
of the ship not liking the looks of the
water, the falling barometer and the feel
ing of the 36-mile southeast wind, signaled
the tug to return. Captain Dan Haskell
reluctantly came around with his tow, and
steered for the harbor again.*. ; -7
The ship Clan McKenzie was abreast the
Presidio outward bound, towed by the tug
Active, and her captain seeing the Law
hill returning concluded to do likewise.
Both vessels were anchored in the stream.
FORT CANBY WAS "LOW."
The Storm Center Did Not Change,
So the Southwester
Raj-red.
Fort Cri*nhy . ne.Jr the mouth of the Co
lumbia River, notwithstanding its emi
nently respectable reputation through its
Governmental establishments, has de
veloped decidedly low traits of late. So
low indeed are they that the whole Pacific
j Slope has stood aghast and fallen into the
| convulsions of a gale by turns. This
"low" development of Fort Canby and
vicinity, however, is blamed by the
weather prophet for ail the trouble, be
cause it has kicked up terrific winds day
after day and drenched the coast with rain
storms.
"You see," explained that official of the
'â  Government, pointing at a chart covered
j with puzzling red, blue, black and green
I lines, "Fort Canby is low."
"And what of it?"
"We have those storms."
The forecaster added that it was more
I properly the barometer was away down
. with a bona-fide fit of the blues up at Fort
I Canby, and that meant the storm center
; was there. The "low" was vainly strug
i gling to pass in a southeasterly direction,
but there was a high pressure just beyond
the** Sierras which stopped barometric
junketing over the country.
So the meterological conditions remained
stationary almost from Saturday night to
the intense surprise and chagrin of the
weather prophet, who gave "unsettled
weather, with showers Sunday forenoon
and fresh southerly winds."
The low pressure changed unexpectedly
yesterday, and San Francisco came in for
another taste of a sou'wester laden with
about three-fourths of an inch of rain.
The thunderstorm was a surprise to the
Weather Bureau, and tho delicate instru
ments up there beat a tattoo on their
registers in recording a sudden change of
temperature and barometr : c pressure.
PEEL TO EXPLORE ALASKA
Latest Caper of the Jolly Young
Grandson of a Prime
Minister.
He Will Form a Company of English
men and Start Toward the
North Pole.
:7/-.-I.L_
Roland Danvers Peel, M.D., of England,
but knowu to vaudeville stage managers
as "Nat, the comedian"," and who has been
delighting the cosmopolitan audiences of
the Bella Union Theater for the past week
or two with his irresistibly funny songs
and makeups, has decided to abandon
the stage and Lie himself away to the
frozen north on a tour of exploration.
Mr. Peel acknowledges himself to be the
eldest son of Sir Robert Peel and nephew
of the Sir Robert Peel who until recently
was Speaker of the House of Commons. '
It was he who solicited of Explorer
Stanley permission to accompany him as
surgeon through the wilds of Africa. He
has been on exploring expeditions before
and has penetrated the northern and
almost inaccessible parts of Australia,
going as far as the Carpentaria Bay.
"My idea," said he last evening, "is to
go on a tour of exploration to Alaska. I
shall form a little party of Englishmen,
and we probably shall start within ten
days. I intend going as far north as it is
possible for man to go. That is a very in
te. -iting country up there, and it has not
by any means been thoroughly explored.
"I have always desired to make this trip.
I may cross the straits into Russia and
come down into China.
; "China and Japan are about the only
countries of - thÂ« world that I have not
seen. But you maybe; sure I shall do
them thoroughly before I settle down.''
Mr. Peel's specialties in the histrionic
line are all original. He composes the
music for his songs and writes the words
also.
Arrangements have been made by
the. German military authorities on the
first intimation of war to convey by' rail
all the women and children in such large
towns as Metz and Strasburg, as well as
smaller places, into Germany.

Notwithstanding that the wind blew a
hurricane yesterday the Shell Mound
shooting range was filled with marksmen of
all Kinds, and a sheet of bullets was kept fly
ing from the stands to the targets. It was
one of the' worst days for the riflemen ex
perienced in years, and the wonder was
that a single good score was made. Those

day were treated to a "fishtail" wind that
whipped back and forth from every point
of the compass in the south. The light,
too, was varying, at times the black discs
appearing distinct and at other times as
dark as a San Francisco street on a foggy
night when the almanac says there is a
moon.
The members of the Columbia Pistol and
Rifle Club were out in full force, and con
sidering the weather excellent work was
done with the light bullets Used. The
Columbia's new target is becoming better
liked as the marksmen become more fa
miliar with the system of counting the
points. Many who are not members have
given it a test and are so well pleased that
there is every probability that they will
advocate its adoption in their clubs.
Among these are W. E. Spofford, who is
one of the leading spirits in the Fresno
Rifle Club. His club instructed him to
look into the merits of the Columbia tar
get, and his verdict yesterday after testing
it on rifle and pistol ranges is such that he
will urge his club to adopt it.
G. C. Thaxter, one of the best riflemen
on the coast and a member of a crack Car
son team, has expressed his appreciation
of the target, and it is likely that the Ne
veda riflemen will soon be shooting for the
| one in thelcenter. A ButteJCounty club
j is also discussing its adoption, while one
i or two local military companies are con
sidering the same question. F. O. Young,
the originator of the target, is constantly
answering letters and questions in expla
nation of the principles involved. *
Great interest was manifest in the pistol
range because the short range was less
affected by the wind. Daiss, who is in
the champion class, made the remarkable
score of 8 in three shots, counting from

Company X "Wing.
One of the most hotly contested military
matches held for a long time was between
teams from ; Company A of the Fifth and
Company of the ; First. The former's
armory is in Oakland and the latter in San
Francisco on Page and Gough streets. 7 The
conditions were twenty men to a team and
ten shots to each man. The match 7 was
for a trophy.. According to the arrange
ments the losing team must carry the prize
to the armory of the victorious team and
present it with due formality and humilia
i tion on account of the defeat. The victors
will magnanimously take in the van
quished team and extend all the hospital
ity that is possible.
When these two teams come together in
X's armory the marksmen will have a
jolly time, for the hospitality to be ex
tended by the victors will include such
refreshments as promote good cheer.
The match yesterday was hotly con
tested from the start, and for a long time
neither team felt confident of success.
The last shots were fired while the rain
was falling so heavily that the Dullseye
could hardly be -seen. Company X won
by the very limited margin of 15 points.

SHOT FOR THK MEDALS.
Remarkable Scores for the Schumann
Prizes at Schuetzen.
It rained some at Schuetzen yesterday.
In fact the heavens spilt more water over
the ranges than ever leaked in the recollec
tion of Philo Jacoby. Philo himself stood
aghast at the overwhelming abundance of
liquid and not alone because it was merely
water, but it was the most notable down
pour of which the annals of Marin County
marksmanship have any. record.
Still the riflemen made an event of it.
There was a large crowd of target-hitters
on the ground during the entire day. It
was the occasion on which the Schumann
gold medals were to be shot for and the
crack canvas-breakers from all of the big
shooting clubs in town were ready to
make a try for the prizes. Even the ladies
were not daunted by the flood. They
came early and stayed until the latest
train, Incidentally ripping the bullseyes
and nearly running off with tne gold
badges.
The Utschig girls did some of the shoot
ing and Miss Langer landed the lead
close to the center on a number of occa
sions. . Taking the weather and the ladies
and the scores and Jacoby together it was
a great event in the early part of the year's
shooting programme.
The firing began at 10 o'clock. There
was a fair light on the targets and some of
the best work was done before 11. About
noon it began raining and by 2 o'clock
the markers were reported drowned.
Langer and Jacoby managed to reach the
butts and after a delay of about an hour
the markers and their targets were put in
shape again. During the entire afternoon
the wind and rain interfered with every
bullet that was fired. Sights and wind
gauges were of little use during such a
storm. : .,7/4:
The results of the competition are rather
remarkable. | In all of the fierce wind and
blinding rain Otto Burmeister scored 231
points out of a possible 250. John Utschig
was only one point behind' him. and as a
rule the scores were of a very high order.
Philo Jacoby Is authority for the state
ment that scores of such merit were never
made before in â  such handicapping
weather, ln his thirty years' experience
on the range he recalled no instance in
which weather and scores were both of
such a notable character. '
' The shooting was generally done from
rests. The target was the twenty-five ring
German affair, and 200 yards was the dis
tance. Burmeister won the first gold
medal and Utschig was the winner of the
. second. The scores were as follows:
Burmeister 231. John Utschig 230, Miss
Lizzie Utschig â¢ 220, â¢ Glindermann 219, Nolte
212, John Stanton 209, Babin. 208, Strecker

SPOKE OF AMERICANISM.
Ray Palmer Addressed a Large
Audience at Metropolitan
Temple.
SLANDERERS SEVERELY SCORED
No Sympathy for Those Who Have
Made Vicious Attacks on the
Women.
There was no diminution in the attend
ance at the good citizenship meeting at
Metropolitan Hall yesterday afternoon on
account of the inclemency of the weather.
After the usual organ voluntary H. W.
Quitzow made a few opening remarks, in
the course of which he said :
In looking at this vast audience one cannot
help but believe that the people are deeply in
terested In the question of American liberty.
I would refer those who wish to bo thoroughly
informed of the controversy now in progress
to The Call of this morning, which publishes
the synopsis of the situation by Rev. Donald
ROSS. P/flp/fi
The singing of "Hail Columbia" was
followed by remarks of an introductory
character by M. T. Brewer, who said in
part:
I will ask you to bear with me a few mo
ments while I say a few plain words. Yester
day my attention was called to something in
The Call written by Father Yorke. [Demon
stration.] Honor bright, now, friends. I know
your manhood and your womanhood. Now,
no hisses for any one, and I never ask for ap
plause. But I want you to hear me patiently
and manfully. My attention was called, as I was
saying, to an article in The Call written by
Father Yorke [a demonstration was again
elicited by the mention of the name of Father
Yorke.] I read it carefully. It referred to the
slandering of women of the Catholic -aith. I
have a loving mother, a dear wife and a
precious daughter, and if Peter C. Yorke or
anybody else haa cast a slur on our women I
.would have been bitterly indignant; and I am
as indignant over what one of our own people
has said in derogation of the women who be
long to the Catholic church.
I say that in the end of the nineteenth cen
tury all should have liberty to worship as
they like. I say that no man has the- right to
say that the women of the Catholic faith are
worse than those of any other denomination.
The Monitor and Father Yorke have chosen
to say that the words I spoke on this platform
I did not mean. I now say that I mean every
word that I say here at all times.
But when any one attempts to interfere with
our public schools, then I say call a halt. We
want the fullest liberty of conscience for our
selves, and all that we want for ourselves we
are willing to mete out to all in the free land.
We ask nothing for ourselves that we will not
grant to others. -..
Let us see to it that the principles that un
derlie the American Protective Association are
American principlesâ are for the unity of the
Nation; for a fair and honest count; for gov
ernment by the ballot, for no one can say that
we desire to govern any other way.
The members of the Young Men's Institute
sometimes say: "Why, that A. P. A. is so secret."
I wonder if the Young Men's Institute is not
secret. lam afraid they would blackball me if
I applied for membership to-morrow. They
say in all seriousness, and. I suppose in all
truth, they have no politics discussed in their
meetings. I wonder what the members of the
Young Men's Institute would say if I told
them that politics was never discussed in any
council of the A. P. A. I want to tell Father
Yorke and the Y. M. I. that if any officer of the
A. P. A. allowed politics to be discussed he
would lose his office. Bo we are very nearly
alike. I say though that if politics is not dis
cussed by the Y. M. I. they are yet carrying out
the behests of Father Yorke and the Catholic
hierarchy.
hen the speaker of the occasion was
introduced, Chairman Quitzow had barely
sot the words "We will now hear from
Rev. Ray Palmer" out of his mouth when
hisses arose in the eallery, which were,
however, quickly drowned by applause.
Then the reverend gentleman spoke as
follows:
I am here to speak on "What Is True Ameri
canism?"
We believe that the Roman Catholic hier
archy is un-American. We believe it from a
great many considerations, only a few of
which can I speak about to-day.
No Catholic can really be a true American.
They may sincerely believe they are truly
loyal, but they cannot be. Take the case of
Bishop Irelandâ
[Applause in the gallery, followed by
cries of "Put him out
"Xo, don't put him out; don't put anybody
out. am glad to have, our Catholic. friends
here, but don't disturb me. I have no feeling
against them.
Thus great Bishop Ireland would never have
become a Bishop if he were a* true American.
He may perhaps believe himself to be one. I
make no charge against the Bishop or any
other man. They may believe themselves to
be, thoueh they cannot be so, as we know.
Our friend who made great claims to patriot
ism closed his address last Tuesday in an
apostropho to free America and .took oc
casion to speak of "Catholic Columbia." I
don't know when it became Catholic. [Ap
plause.] I want to say to you that no A. P. A.
man could have delivered more patriotic
words than these. We do not believe that
Father Caraher spoke these words with the
same underlying feeling that would have
prompted the true American. We don't be
lieve his words came from a profound love of
Americanism, a love above his ecclesiastical
allegiance. I say that our Catholic friends
may love our country in many ways, but I say
that they do not yet love oor country with the
true love that regards the best principle of
of American libertyâ religious liberty.
They claim to be sending men from over the
water to teach us better. Americanism and
higher patriotism. Let us take the recent in
vestiture of Satolli with the honors of a
Cardinal. I say such a demonstration is un-
American. The details of that affair were
something like those of the ancient Romans.
The great pomposity of it was incongruous
with Christianity and Americanism alike.
When I see these things I fear for Americanism,
and we should protest against them.
We say that if Americans needed a Cardinal
why did not the Pope select an American
Bishop and make him a cardinal. Why send a
man away from Italy and make him a Car
dinal in our country.
The Bishops and Archbishops show their
deep servility to the Pope in not protesting
against this invasion. They said it was only
another * exhibition of the Pope's love for
America. If I were a priest or Bishop I would
send a protest to the Pope against such a
course. 1 should think that under the circum
stances it would be very * embarrassing to
Cardinal Satolli to face the priests, Bishops
and Archbishops of tin? country, . He came to
this cquntry without being able to speak even
a word of â¢ our language, yet he is exalted over
all the priests of his church and is to give us
lessons in better patriotism.
I believe that the Roman Catholic hierarchy
is an enemy of America, because they are still
trying to suppress free speech.
He then read a newspaper dispatch re
lating to the assaults made on a .Protest
ant preacher by Catholics. at Fort Wil
liams and other places in ' Canada, and
continued as follows:
I don't say that the priests are to blameâ
they engendered and encouraged these out
breaks. But they, should, have been able to
control these things and prevent them.
We believe that the hierarchy is un Ameri
can because our Government is democratic, and
it is opposed to our Government. In The Call
of the 23d one of the defenders of the Catholic
church says that the Roman hierarchy is dem
ocratic. Neither Father Yorke nor any other
man has shown' or can show that the Catholic
hierarchy is democratic. In a democracy the
people have all offices: in the ; hierarchy the
people have no office. The Pope is the great
flywheel in the great machine shop of Cath
olicism. He keeps things running smoothly.
In the Catholic church- the priests are called
â¢ "fathers." | It seems to me he is not only called
"father" because he is the spiritual instructor,
but because he is the master and controls his
people. It is un-American to call any I one
iafher except God, and the term master is also
un-America"n. .-*' â¢' â¢*--.â â 
Father Yorke may be sincere, but if he is it is
the biggest blunder he ever made to say the
Catholic church is democratic. It has shown
the spirit of persecution even in this very tan
gle. Father Caraher > took up the slanders
spoken against ; the Catholic women, and he
held ; the A. P. A. ; responsible for these
dastardly attacks. : I : want â¢ to ; denounce any
attack on women. No priest shall make an
attack on their virtue, and. I say that I have
never made any v attack *on â : the virtue of
Catholic women, and I want to say that I hope
God will give me the grace to refrain from any
such act. â â¢.*'â â â¢â â¢*; .'â¢â *,..-.-*' ..>â¢â  ;
Father, Caraher ; said . some things that were
not right; some things that rilled the minds of
the Roman hierarchy long ago. They show
that the same things are *in the minds of the
priests of to-day. He said that whoever would
assail the women of any sect should have the
flesh torn from his body by a cat-of-nine-tails.
This shows that he would like to do that.
No minister of God has . the right to
use language like that. It smells of
the dark ages. The Catholics at one
time attacked the Young People's Society of
Christian Endeavor, but no Protestant minis
ter ever spoke such words as Father Caraher.
I say that it will never be permitted that the
Pope shall live in the United States. It is said
that the Italian. Government has determined
that there shall never be another conclave in
Italy. Italy evidently intends that there shall
be no Pope in Italy after Leo XIII. If a Pope
come here like a man he will be welcome, but
if he comes to attempt the union of state and
church we have no use for him in this country.
There is talk of the Pope coming to take up
his residence in Washington (cries of -'Not by
along shot" and "Xo, no. no!"), but they will
be awfully disappointed if they try to estab
lish his seat of government in this country.
There are 1405 convents and nunneries in
the United States, each having an average of
about sixty inmates. There are thus some
thing more than 84,000 women kept in con
finement without sanction of the law. They
soy they have voluntarily taken vows. Yet
many have change their minds and want
again to be free, but they are not allowed to
do so.' They say to Uncle Sam that he cannot
go within those walls. We want all public in
stitutions to be open to public inspection.
tor the sake of the womanhood Iwe love,
I say Undo Sam is yet going in behind those
walls, and we are going to say to those people,
"Those who desire to remain can remain, but
those who wish to leave shall have their lib
erty."
We say that Americanism is A. P. A. ism. We
say that there is not a principle in the A. P. A.
that is at variance .with our constitution.
They say we are foreigners. How many for
eigners have they, with a foreigner at their
head who lives in Rome?
CHURCH AND STATE.
Dr. J. L.' York Says They Must Be
Kept Apart In This
Nation.
Dr. J. L. York, the well-known liberal
lecturer, delivered an interesting lecture
last evening at 105 Larkin street. His sub
ject was: '"Romanism or Protestantism â
Which?" In the course of his remarks he
said
What religious superstition and priestcraft
did In all the past to promote an unnatural
and false system of religion in the world, you
may see to-day in the discussion now going on
between Father Yorke and Protestant Chris
tianity. In the early days of Christianity their
councils of bishops and priests were character
ized by fierce contention over the settlement
of every dogma. 7.
So in this discussion in The Call the same
spirit and struggle for ecclesiastical supremacy
appears. But to the freethinker the main
question is untouched, as both sides assume
to be God's church, and yet neither Roman nor
Protestant Christian is able to prove that God
ever had anything to do with tne founding of
Christianity in the world any more than he
had with founding Mohammedanism or Mor
monism, and that all religions are man-made
and bear no stamp of true divinity.
This being true, how can any amount of dis
cussion based upon bare assumption solve the
problem?
If, as we claim, Christianity has not a divine
origin, and grew out of the mythology of the
East, and that the stories of Mathew, Mark,
Luke and John are wanting in the elements of'
credibility in the light of reason and science,
and that Christianity is man"made and has no
more claim to being divine than Mormonism,
what significance can there be whether the
early Popes claimed superiority over the state
or not? -To the bar of science, reason and a
higher criticism than Protestant Christianity
must Romanism be arraigned to answer her
many false claims upon the intellect of the
world. â 'â -â â  ,-â¢ -â â¢Â» Ay.
We do not mean to say that Romanism is all
bad and Protestantism all good, as they are
mother and daughter and have many traits
and tenets in common. All of the religions
known to man contain some truth, and so far
as Roman or Protestant Christianity has a
moral influence and promotes a true sense of
justice and fraternity â¢ among men they are
good. . :--:
So far as they exercise any spiritual author
ity as from God to control the free exercise of
human reason in men and women in regard to
deity, heaven, hell or salvation, they are, and
ever have been, a bar to mental development
and a brake on the car of human progression.
Religion is well enough in its place, but it
finds a rocky road when out of place. If re
ligions, creeds and dogmas were of God, their
true place would be in all human relations;
but as all religions have no higher origin than
human Ignorance, hope and fear, society is
called upon to define this mental disease/and
fix a limit for its exercise compatible with our
free institutions and widest human liberty.
The realm of church and State are as wide
apart as the realm of a dog and cat. The State
being simply a form of force has nothing to do
with religion of any kind, and the people de
mand a complete separation of church and
State, and we have no right, under our secular
Constitution, to hire chaplains to pray at the
people's expense for Congress, army and navy,
or any prayers or religious songs in the com
mon schools of our country.
The realm of religion is the realm of persua
sion, and must begin and end with persuasion
a moral force, and when coupled with civil
power, tends to churchism and ecclesiastical
despotism and popery in its various forms.
We are pleased to commend the noble ana
timely words of Rev. E. 11. Payne of Berkeley
in a sermon printed in the San Francisco Call
of Saturday, January 25, and find ourselves In
happy accord with his views on the Yorke-
Ross controversy. And that more especially
as both Catholics and Protestants are open to
the charge of being in politics and seeking to
infuse religion into the state and schools. For
years Protestant â â  Christians, by systematic
effort, have appealed to Congress for an amend
ment to the "constitution ot our country.
recognizing God, Christ and the Bible
and the persistent appeals to Congress
and State legislatures for Sunday laws
by Protestant Christians render it obvious
that the keynote for the solution of this
problem will never be found in invective, and
a gospel of hatred between Catholics and
Protestants, but rather in the broad and lib
eral view that our Government Is and must be
secular, and that our public school system is
a creature of the State and that "hands-oft"" to
all ecclesiasticism should apply equally to both
Catholic and Protestant Christians.
A war waged upon any other basis than that
of justice and fair play can only stir up secta
rian strife and cruel feelings among friends
and neighbors, quite at variance with true
Americanism, to say nothing of the high pro
fession of peace on earth and good will to men.
THE NORTH-END STATION.
Supervisors Will Decide To-Day
Where It Shall Be
Located.
Strong Protest Filed to the Selection
of the Washington-Street
Site.
To-day the Board of Supervisors will de
termine a matter which is deemed of vital
importance to the owners of property and
residents in the immediate neighborhood
of the proposed location of a new police
station. /A/
" Some time ago, the present location of
the North End police station on Jacirson
street east of Polk being deemed inade
quate to the wants of the Police Depart
ment, a movement was made to establish
more commodious quarters in that vicin
ity. The block bounded by Van Ness
avenue, Washington,' Jackson and Polk
streets, except the frontage on Polk street
and a vacant lot on Washington street, is
occupied by private residences, among
them being some of the best in the City.
The vacant lot on Washington street,
33 by 127K, belongs to John McCarthy, the
president of Buckley's Occidental Club.
: The property-owners in that block, find
ing that a movement was on foot to locate
the police station on the McCarthy lot,
made a strong opposition, which resulted
in an agreement to locate the same on Polk
street, between Jackson and Washington.
This arraneeruent was entirely satisfactory
to the property on Folk stre t. Th*e
Folk-street lot has a frontage of forty feet
on the easterly side of the street, in the
middle of the block. The owner removed
his tenants at ' considerable . expense, em
ployed an architect to prepare plans and
specifications for the building, and had the
same nearly completed when the Health
and Police ; Committee refused to give
further time, and awarded to contract to
McCarthy.
Air the property-owners of the block
mentioned except one, representing 1220
front feet out of 1278 feet, and the owners
of property on the south side of Washing
ton street, with one exception, and owners
of the property in the immediate vicinity
west of Van Ness avenue, filed a protest
in which they showed the damage to their
property and other homes by locating a
police station, with cells and stable at
tached, in tbe midst of - their residences,
but without avail.
The McCarthy contract passed by the
usual voteâ B to â one Supervisor "being
absent.
The Mayor has vetoed the McCarthy
resolution and to-day the matter comes ud
for final action. If the Mayor's veto shall
be sustained relief will come to the prop
erty-owners and the station established on
Polk street.
An agreement has been made between
the owner of the lot and the property
owners of the block mentioned, by which
he agrees to erect a building covering hi 3
40-foot lots, which, it is claimed, will be a
better location and better adapted for the
purposes required than the Washington
street lot.
A committee of property-owners, con
sisting of Frank J. Sullivan, James Den
man and Frank J. French, has had charge
of the matter and secured a satisfactory
agreement with the owner of the Polk
street lot.
The property-owners affected by the
erection of a police station on Washington
street state that the location of a police
station in the midst of their private resi
dences will be ruinous to their property
and virtually destroy their homes.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
It is January in tbe almanac but April
in the weather bureau.
Many people feel for the Armenians,
but only the Turks are reaching for them.
No senatorial speeches were made yester
day to be read to-day. This is blue
Monday.
Already the great mass of the people are
getting into line for high tariff and free
coinage.
Instead of passing the emergency bills
the Senators seem resolved to let the
emergency pass.
Let us hold together until the fundini
bill is defeated and then we can discus;
what to do next.
Since Krueger sent Jameson to England
to be tried be ought to give Hammond a
trial in California.
All parts of the interior are humming
with preparations of coming festivals and
everybody is busy.
The Democratic Presidential campaigr
has begun to open up and looks more lik
a chestnut burr than ever.
The Republican victory in Kentucky
will result in a far-reaching reform if it re
peals the monopoly charter.
If Eastern people are able to see any.
thing at all through the blinding snow
storms they ought to see that California
is the place to live. * * .
The proposal of Senator Cullom to bor
row $100,000,000 to provide coast defenses
would be more like a popular loan than
Cleveland's attempt at it.
With a deficit in the revenues Cleve
land's attempt to keep up the gold reserve
is like trying to keep a barrel filled with
water while the bung is open.
The silver men and the Populists will
make very good side shows at St. Louis,
but everybody will go into the big tent
where the .Republican band plays.
It is said that Morrison of Illinois is the
only man in the Democratic Presidential
nomination, and be is suspected of wish
ing it mainly for the advertising there is
in it.
Some of the supporters of the railroad
monopoly are silent because they are
afraid of public opinion, but most of them
are so because they are ashamed of them
selves.
The third term proposition is not a
movement by any means. It is only an
obstruction in the Democratic road that
prevents any other candidate from having
a movement.
It has been noted in Chicago that on the
day it was decided to hold the Democratic
Convention there the temperature began
to rise and the weather became something
like a hot day in January.
The laurels of glory come high in the
Orient as well as elsewhere and Japan has
found that her recent increase of prestige
has been accompanied by a 70 per cent
increase of taxation.
Business men should be liberal in their
subscriptions to the . State development
committee fund, as it is doing practical
and effective work in bringing a thrifty
class of home-seekers into the State.
Illinois Democrats declare their favor
ite Colonel Bill Morrison to be '-a plat
form in himself," and do not see that they
are thereby furnishing a reason why some
other candidate should be put up to stand
on him.
According to Willett & Gray's statistical
review the consumption of sugar in the
United States was about 67,000 tons less in
1805 than in the previous year. It was
cheaper than it had been, but Democratic
times had made the people too poor to buy
it even at the reduced price.
Tbe memorial to Congress on the fund
ing bill should assert everything on which
the people are united and nothing on which
they are divided. The one issue at pre
sent is to defeat any re-funding scheme
that may be devised and on that issue
there is no division of sentiment in Cali
fornia. A, .>"â¢â¢;*, y
The nearer the campaign approaches the
more certain it is that the greatest issue
with the people will be that of tariff re
form in the direction of a thorough pro
tective system even if it has to be carried
to the extent of absolutely prohibiting the
importation of Oriental goods that com
pete with home products.
New York and New Jersey have arranged
between them a little scheme to get the
Government to buy the famous plateau of
the Palisades and preserve it as a military
reservation. Of course the scheme is sim
ply to get a grand park at the expense of
the Nation, and California might as well
ask the Government to provide a boule
vard around the bay for a military high
way.
It will be remembered that during the
campaign last fall a young woman in
Maryland challenged Senator Gorman to
debate with her. Gorman declined, but
nevertheless she is to have her reward. A
soap manufacturinz company has adopted"
her picture as a trade- mark and will send
her out during the coming campaign to
stump the whole country for that rare
combination, Populism and soap.
WORKERS AEE WORKING.
An encouraging feature of the fight
against the funding bill is the interest
which labor organizations are taking in it.
Here and there throughout the State they
are passing resolutions against the scheme
and forwarding them to Washington.
Much more work of that kind might be
done. For that matter, a grand demon
stration by the labor bodies of the State
would serve a useful purpose.
It is upon persons of small means and
upon those who have no resource but
their daily labor that the burdens im
posed by extending the railroad debt will
fall most grievously. As an extension of
the debt must contemplate an increase of
transportation charges to meet the pay-
ments, and as these cbarees at present are
greater than the State can bear and at the
same time have a margin for an extension
of its industries, it follows that the pass
ing of a funding bill will further impov-
erish the producing classes by enforcing a
curtailment of production. It would not
be competent to argue that the railroad
company dare not place its charges at a
figure which would Kill its traffic. It will
bave to do bo if it honestly tries to meet
the obligations of a funding bill. If the
view be taken that it will not do so, then
we must admit that it has no intention of
discharging its obligations.
But we have already seen that any such
power, to be exercised either to swindle
the Government or cripple the State, is
just, what we cannot afford to grant to
this imperious company. While making
a pretense, in its attack upon the Rail
road Commission's reduced scale of freight
charges, of a necessity for maintaining
high rates in order that its means of ob
serving its obligation to the Government
shall not be impaired, it arbitrarily raises
rates in the exercise of a power which its
compact with the Panama Â©Railway
created, In this latter case there was no
pretense that the increased revenue was
desired to apply to the Government debt.
The funding bill is not only a measure
to evade the payment of an honest debt;
it goes further and means the condoning
of the swindle by winch the debt was
created and maintained and the perpetua
tion of a monopoly which will be as un
scrupulous and imperious in the future as
it has been in the past.
The workers of Californiaâ farmers, arti
sans, laborers and all others who, as pro
ducers and consumers, constitute the bulk
of the populationâ -are the ones at whose
security and prosperity this shameful
measure is aimed. It is principally they
who should step forward now and sound
a protest that may be beard across the con
tinent. This is not a time for timidity or
'cowardice. All expressions that are made
should be temperate and so framed as to
command the respect and attention of the
East. Our kinsmen there are slower and
more conservative than we, and besides
that they cannot fully understand the evils
that we have borne so long or appreciate
the disheartening position in which we
should be placed by the passage of the
funding bill. If we are radical or abusive
we shall certainly lose the Eastern sym
pathy which belongs to a sense of justice.
Let every effort be confined to an assault
on the funding bill. On that proposition
we certainly can count on the sympathy of
the East. That will mean victory. The
way will then be clear for an intelligent
handling of the propositions which will
present themselves.
UNBALANCED INSTRUCTION.
The Grand Jury of Los Angeles turns
aside a moment from its ! task of exposing
official carelessness and rascality in that
city, and reads the State a severe lecture
on the subject of normal schools. It
states that the State has four of
these institutions, and that they are
graduating about 200 teachers annually
for a - population which is showing
hardly any increase. The Grand Jury
suggests that the number of examinations
at least might be reduced from two to one
a year.
It seems a peculiar coincidence that
while the Los Angeles Grand Jury was
launching that bolt, tbe State Superin
tendent of Education was lecturing in San
Francisco and saying some other interest
ing things about the needs of the public
schools. He declared that because of tho
small salaries paid teachers, many young
men regard teaching as merely a stepping
stone to some more profitable occupation,
and he added : "The teaching force of the
State is in a constant state of change. We
do not wonder at the clamor for something
more than an academic training for those
who are to teach our children in the
future." He then intimated that the nor
mal schools do not require a sufficiently
high education on the part of those who
are received to be taught the art of teach
ing. 7/p7at
It does seem a strangely unbalanced
condition of affairs that shows the turning
out of so many teachers annually by the
normal schools on a comparatively low
basis of qualification while there are hun
dreds, and possibly thousands, of normal
graduates who are unable to secure posi
tions, and while the fierce struggle - for po
sitions inevitably leads to bad results, in a
political sense. Although the public
schools of the State are famous for their
efficiency that is no reason why they may
not be better.
No teacher can be too well trained. The
normal schools of the State turn out grad
uates who are very young, and for that
reason alone, however ambitious they
may be, lack a valuable qualification for
managing children. It is not difficult to
imagine that if they were put through a
long training they would be more efficient
than they are. Worse than all this are
the wire-pullings that many of them have
to resort to in order to secure positions. It
becomes largely a matter of personal in
fluence, and this must tend to lower the
standard of merit. â â¢' ,-*.
It would certainly be interesting if the
normal schools would publish a list of all
their former pupils who hold positions as
teachers and place alongside it a list of
those who have failed to find such employ
ment. â zA/p..:/:.. .
THE SEOEETAEY'S DUTY.
The Transvaal authorities have liberated
all the American prisoners on parole ex
cept John Hays Hammond, and he is
held because he bad written to Jameson
saying that he would notify him . when
danger should threaten the Uitlanders.
As a matter of fact Jameson had already
started on his raid before this ; letter was
written. Hence the simple story is that
Hammond feared that at some time the
Uitlanders' rights might be threatened;
that be was presumably aware of Jame
son's intention to make a raid for their
rescue when -.* that '; contingency should
arise; that as it did not arise Hammond
committed no overt act against the Trans
vaal authority.- On the contrary, seeing
tbat there was no occasion for Jameson's
descent and that such an act was wrong
and unwarranted, he promptly placed him
self on the side of the Boers, raised the flag'
of the Transvaal and assisted in main
taining the constituted authority of the
republic. If his first act was an error bis
second more than atoned for it.
All that, however, is apart from a deeper ,

manding that President Krueger surrender
Jameson to England for trial in the English
courts, and it is now believed that Mr.
Olney will follow that example and de
mand the surrender of the American pris
oners to the United States for trial in our
courts. It is not possible for Secretary
Olney to pursue any other course without
degrading our country in the eyes of the
world. President Krueeer could not afford
to practice such a discrimination as a re
fusal to comply would represent. Even
should he refuse it is the duty of our Gov
ernment to press the demand and if neces
sary to enforce it. The Transvaal, by ac
ceding to England's demand, has for
feited all right to appeal to the nations for
protection against such a demand' from
us, and no nation could interfere without
first requiring that the precedent estab
lished in Jameson's surrender to England
be destroyed.
Our Nation has not a very good reputa
tion for zeal in guarding the interests of its
citizens abroad, and it is time that this
error be corrected. The one thing above
all others that an Englishman is sure of is
that the whole power of Great Britain is
ready to be unleashed in his protection if
bis rights or liberty are threatened in any
part of the world. It is such a feeling of
security as this that makes citizens and
subjects loyal to tbe countries whose flags
protect them, and eager to -fight when
these countries become involved in war.
Aside from all this is the extremely bitter
feeling of the Boers against the foreigners
and the virtual impossibility of a fair trial
in the Transvaal courts. Even should the
courts acquit the American prisoners it is
more than likely that mob law would be
resorted to. President Krueger'e assur
ance that the suspects will be given a fair
trial would mean nothing in the face of a
fierce popular determination to find sonif
victims to suffer vicariously for Jameson's
deeds. 7/77;-
In the United States there is no popular
hatred of the Boers or their Government.
The American prisoners would be tried
fairly in courts employing a language with
which they are familiar, and a procedure
which they understand. The Government
of the Transvaal would in no wine be ham-'
pered in the presentation of its case. In
snort, trial in an American court would be
fair, and in a Transvaal court unfair and
dangerous. Should Secretary Olney fail
of his clear duty in this instance he would
be striking a very serious blow at the rights
and liberties of American citizens, and
would be degrading the United States be
fore all the nations.
A QUEER TRADE IDEA.
The Pennsylvania Grocer makes the fol
lowing extraordinary announcement:
"Chicago is reaching out for trade, as all
live cities ought and must, if they expect
to do more than hold their own. Leading
wholesalers have formed an association to
give free transportation to and from their
homes to retail merchants if they pur
chase $1000 worth of goods and ship by
such lines as the association may direct.
This is a novel idea, but it may bring grist
to tho Chicago mills."
It is difficult to believe that such a
scheme has been devised. If it has, the
retail merchant** may be sure that they are
not to be relieved of the burden of freight
charges. Further, there must be a strange
condition of railroad affairs in and about
Chicago, for such a scheme would mean
an arrangement between the wholesale
merchants and certain rail lines, to the
prejudice of the roads not parties to the
plan. A/;/
The idea would be really alluring were
it not ludicrous. As the retail merchant
stands in line next lo the consumer, and
as the consumer and producer have to
bear, share and share alike, all the bur
dens of transportation charges, no picture
could be prettier than that which repre
sents them in the act of receiving their
load gaudily painted and luxuriously
tricked out in feathers and tinsel. But it
is easy to gull heedless humanity. So
long as some persons think that they are
getting something for nothing when they
take newspapers on the strength of
"coupons," "prizes" and the like, we may.
expect the inventive genius of Chicago to
devise means for making tbe most of the
opportunity.

COAST EXCHANGES.
While the constitutionality of the Wright
irrigation law is being tried "by the Supreme
Court of the United States it is refreshing
to know that however that case may go
the need of irrigation in California is so
clearly apparent that private enterprise is
ready here and there to undertake the task
and leap the profits which the members of
a community might share under the opera
tion of a district law. As it is better, how
ever, to have irrigation undertaken by a
private corporation than neglected alto
gether, it is welcome news in the Madera
Mercury that a company has been organized
for supplying the local need of that sec
tion. The Fresno Canal and Irrigation
Company is in. the field with a proposition
to the land-owners, and its representative
says that if a sufficient acreage subscribes
to the scheme a main canal will be run
from the San Joaquin River at a point east
of the railroad bridge, and thence north
erly past Madera and on to the Chowchilla
River, with numerous branches. The sys-
tern will furnish 1000 cubic feet of water a
second, and can irrigate 160,000 acres of
land. Our exchange adds: "It will be a
big undertaking and will cost a great deal
of money. The promoters of the scheme
say that if they are guaranteed 50,000
acres they will have the system in opera
tion in a year. The water right will cost
$6 75 an acre, with from five to fifteen
years' time in which to pay for it. Water
will be delivered for 75 cents an acre per
year.". . ';â¢ *, ,-;â â â¢ *

The Los Angeles Express publishes a re

be a source of great gratification to our
contemporary, which is pleased to speak
somewhat disparagingly of what it calls the
"northern rival" of Los Angeles, we are
confident that Fan Francisco is glad to
know that its sister in the south is pros
pering so handsomely. But our contem
porary, in explaining the difference be
tween the two cities, makes this observa
tion, which it is well that every San Fran
ciscan should consider: "The cause of this
progress on one hand and retrogression
on the other is not far to seek ; it is largely
in the difference between the people who
inhabit the two towns." Even the follow
ing extract from the same article is inter
eating: "San Francisco, too, is suffering
from the fall that follows pride. : She
thought she controlled everything on this
coast so completely that she was mistress
of all the territory on this side of ; the
Rockies. She is finding out the mis take,
and will have to struggle to hold her trade
even in territory clearly tributary to her.
If Los Angeles continues along the road of
prosperity she is now traveling she will be
a city of 200,000 before the next census is
taken, and ten years more will see her a
bigger town than 'Frisco."

"To make expensive public improvements
by direct tax is unduly to burden the pres
ent generation for what future generations
will largely profit by." With reference to
the proposition to divide the county our

in the meantime bending their energies to

when secession will be expedient, and
when that time comes Newman will be a

earlier, Newman will iose the honors and

in the afternoon of that day the first rail
road train entered the heart of the town.
Hitherto passengers for Elsinore have
been carried by the Southern California
Railway to a station within some two
miles of the town and there put down to
make their way as best they could to their
destination. Of course good means of
further travel were provided by the hos
pitable Elsinoreans, but at best the rail
road service of the town.' has not been
good. Now not only do the cars put trav
elers down practically \at the doors of the
hotels and business houses but unques
tionably the railroad service is soon to be
further improved by a more direct connec
tion with Los Angeles, Riverside and the
outside world. In other words, the spur
of the Southern California Railway built
from the old Elsinore station up through
town to the coal mines and clay beds is
certainly to be soon extended through the
Temescai Canyon to South Riverside and
thence by way of Chino and Pomona to a
connection with the S. C. trunk line at or
near Lordsburgâ at least at some point
between there and Los Angeles. This
means much to Elsinore, for it is the first
step toward providing those facilities and

INDIVIDUAL COMMUNION CUPS.
: For the first time in the history of Presbyte

used in dispensing the communion wine at the
Ross-street Presbyterian Church yesterday,
says the Eagle. When the time arrived for
dispensing the wine the elders, in place of each
taking one of the large silver goblets formerly
used and passing them around, used chalice
holders with three racks on each. On each of
the racks were twenty tiny metal goblets filled
with wine. The dispensation of the wine by
the new arrangement proved .more speedy and
convenient than under the old. Although the
congregation was taken completely by sur

comment on the innovation was heard. â¢;.-:* â ;
The chalice holders are of a very attractive
design and are especially adapted to holding
the cups, which, with their contents, are satis
factorily protected by covers. The holders are
quickly adjusted at .the time of passing the
wine, thereby admitting of the convenient re
moval of the cups from the trays. Both ma
hogany and ebouized wood are used in their
construction. There is a patent pipette made
for filling the cups separately. The latter are
first arranged in the trays and the wine, hav

and the dust-excluding covers having been re
moved out of the way, each cup is filled sepa
rately. The pipette is adjusted with a rubber
tube, to be compressed by the thumb and rin
gers, and is graduated to teaspoonfuls. For
large churches, again, where rapid tilling is
desirable, a filling device is provided, consist
ing of a glass bottle with an opening in the
side, near the bottom, into which is fitted a
horizontal tube with holes spaced the same
distance apart as the cups and corresrjonding

In receiving the cups the chalice-holdere are

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE NEW SILVER PARTY.
The Platform Not the Single Issue or F&eb
%Â£sSÃ_MfjotWsJSijs. Coinage.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ :
The political history of our country for the
year 1898 can no more be written or under
stood without including the financial question
than can that of the year 1860, when Lincoln
was elected, be written or understood without
including the slavery question. . Among the
events to become noted is that of January 23,
whichwitnessed the inauguration ot the new sil
ver party at the National Capital; and the plat
form adopted on that day is destined to become
a factor of prime importance in molding public
opinion during the campaign of 18967; Indeed,
on the very day, the platform .was adopted, a
distinguished United States Senator, who rep
resented the dominant' party in his place in
the Senate ; chamber, promptly sought jto im
press the country with ; his devotion to silver
as a money metal, but qualified \ his i fealty to
silver by |an avowed superior ; devotion to his
party, and, so far as reported, he made no ref-
erence to a government currency or the bond
question. His confessed anxiety found ex
pression only in the familiar plea of the long
known silver politician who occasionally re
members his constituency.
"The paramont issue at this time in the
United States is indisputably the money ques
tion," so theopeningseutonceof tbe new party
platform declares, and then proceeds at once
to define the money question in words not to
be misunderstood. The issue "is between the
gold standard, gold bonds and bank currency
on;one side and the bimetallic standard, no
bonds and Government currency, on the
other." All the idle and feverish talk about a
party with a single silver issue has now
vanished with the breath that gave it utter
ance, and in place of it we are given a broad
National issue. It is the "money question,"
not the single, silver issue. Thus by a sharp
contrast tbe marked difference between the
old-style silver talk of the last twenty years
and the advance position taken by the great
silver leaders of the new party is made mani
fest. . Â.-â ..,.-.
"On this (money) issue we declare ourselves
to be in favor of a distinctive American finan
cial system." So reads the third sentence of
this new party platform, and this system is to
provide that "the silver coin shall be a full
legal tender, equal with gold for all debts and
dueÂ», public and private." Bo much for silver.
On paper money we have this explicit dec
laration: "We hold that the power to control
and regulate a par currency is inseparable
from the power to coin money, and hence that
all currency intended to circulate as money
should be issued and its volume controlled by
the General Government only and should be
legal tender." This position on paper money
as well as that taken on silver is in full accord
with the position always held by Populists,
and on this statement of "the paramount Issue
of the money question" there is no conflict be
tween the new silver party and the People's
party. ' In opposition to the issue of Govern
ment- bonds in time of peace, and in 6hort in
every declaration made in the new platform,
there is no inharmonv between the silver men
and the Populist--.
The decision made by the new party to hold
the National Convention in St. Louis on July
22, being the same time and place chosen for
the Populist National Convention, is full of
significance, the open and avowed purpose
being to try to unite these two political forces
in the nomiiJetion and support of the same
candidates for President and Vice-President.
The platform closes with an "appeal to the
people of the United States, that, leaving in
abeyance for a moment all other questions,
however important and even momentous they
may appearand sundering if need be all for
mer party affiliation, they unite in a supreme
effort to free themselves and their children
from the domination of the money powerâ
power more destructive than any other which
has ever been fastened upon the civilized men
of any race or in any age." There can be no
doubt that the two g."eat conventions, of more
than a thousand delegates each, will assemble
in St. Louis fully inspired with the spirit and
purpose of this appeal, and it will be a politi
cal marvel indeed if they fail to find the way
to a complete and solid union on candidates
and a close approach to union on platforms.
It may seem a rash prediction at this moment
to say that there are many voters who are now
too indifferent to take serious interest in this
movement that will realize its meaning before
they vole next November.

WORK OF THE MISSIONARIES.
How the Community Has Sprung Up
to Great Power in the
. . United States.
The Paulists bad a special service yester
day. It was in commemoration of the
conversion of Saint Paul, who is ' the
patron of this community of priests.
The historical old church on Califor
nia street was thronged with people at the
solemn high mass, which was celebrated
at 10:30 o'clock. Hundreds were obliged
to stand in the aisles of the church.
The services were impressive and the
altar decorations beautiful. Special music
was provided. The celebrant of the mass
was Rev. Father A. M. Clark, C. S. P.;
deacon. Rev. Father E. Gente. B. M.,
pastor of the French Church ; sub-deacon,
Rev. Father Wyman. Rev. Father Otis
was master of ceremonies.
The other clergymen present included the
Rev. P. E. Yorke. chancellor of the arch

Rev. Father McGovern, O. P., pastor of
St. Dominic's Church; Rev. Father Ed

j Mary's Church at the request of Arch
| bishop Riordan a little more than a year
ago. They are all American priests, and
are imbued with the idea of converting the
whole American people to the Catholic.in
terpretation of Christianity. The founder
of the community was reared in the Prot
estant faith, the faith of his fathers for
generations back. 7 7
In the course of time other Protestants,
ministers of high rank in the church, lay
men, men with professions, men of wealth,
all went over to Rome and began an intel
i lectual crusade against the beliefs which
they left behind. Thus the society has
grown to be quite a power in the American
Catholic church. The members are men
of deep learning, men of ideas.' broad
minded, brilliant, progressive. They are
banded together for a common purpose
and work for a common end. .
The Panlists have two houses in the
United Statesâ one in San Francisco and
the other in New York. Their success
here has been sudden, substantial, lasting.
Father O'Ryan preached his first ser
mon in San Francisco at St. Mary's
Church yesterday. He is quite a pleasing
talker. Ho was educated at the Catholic
University at Washington, D. 0â and is
| one of the promising young men of the
j priesthood in California. Father O'Ryan,
besides being an orator, is an easy and
graceful writer. His discourse yesterday
was on the "Conversion of St. Paul."
In his opening sentences the preacher
spoke of the splendid results that attended
the conversion of St. Paul to Christianity.
He reviewed his far-reaching influence on
the civilization of the world ; his mission
ary labors; the "priceless literature he left
to mankind ; how he became a rabbi. Said
the speaker:-
The one great aim o_St. Paul was to lead the
gentile world into the church. But his ' heart
was rent because of the obstinacy of the seed
of Abrahamâ now he is the David of that race
in his paternal care and the Jercmias in his
lamentations. ( Every great city in the East he
visitedâ Antioch, Ephesus, Athens, Corinthâ
until a divine destiny led him to Rome, where
he consummated. his life sacrifice. Being a
Roman citizen he was accorded the privilege,
if privilege it could be called, of dying by
the sword.
. His | conversion was thorough . - and â¢so
thorough that the remainder of his life was
entirely devoted to the work of Christ. In
Paul we see the real power of Christianity
and of divine grace. . His natural good quali
ties remained, but they were elevated, en
nobled, sanctified. He lived but for one object
and for that he died. There was no harking
back; no doubt on his mind. ,. He was a Chris
tian out and out. How different was that life
from ours who have been brought up in the
truth. ,-â  '-*â â , "-.-, -'â  i. ;,->;â ..*>â¢-. *.;
But for those outside our church there are
wonderful lessons to be learned. While St.
Paul was still an enemy of the church he was
led by blind fanaticism. He never took time
THE SAN FBAISI CISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1896.
to consider. He went on his way and never
took time to consider what motives animated
the youthful Stephen. Paul never imagined
that the law of which he was such a stanch
supporter had passed away; be never dreamed
where the full truth lay. And so though hon
est and sincere he persecuted that which he
knew nothing about. His errors were the
errors ot a misguided intellect. So, too, are
there many people who think harshly about
the Catholic Church without knowing what
she teaches. There are many people, honest
minded, who would shuader at the idea of be
coming Catholics, and yet would not willfully
offend God. Remember that Saul abhorred the
very name of Christ because he did not know
what It meant.
But when divine revelation taught him the
full truth see how eagerly he embraced it. He
needed but light. He had but to know the
truth and the truth and light revolutionized
his career. He was no longer the fierce perse
cutor; he became the apostle w*hose heart
burned with the desire of preaching that
truth, because he knew by his own experience
that were it only known millions would be
won by it. .
Examples of St. Paul are numerous in every
age, but in modern times and in our own coun
try there Is no more glorious example than tho
men who founded the Congregation of St.
Paul and the members of that congregation.
It was founded by Isaac Hecker, who had to
fight his way into the church. He was con
verted by no such miracle as St. Paul.
In younger days the little faith he had was
almost shattered, but he was honest, sincere,
sympathetic. He was a grand specimen of
pure humanity. He was groping in darkness
anxious for truth, yearning to find a solution
for life's riddle, and could not solve it. Finally
this man, sincere and honest, seeking nothing
but the truth and the whole truth, began to
study the doctrines of the Catholic church.
And when the truth possessed in full by the old
church burst on him he followed the example
of St, Paul and immediately embraced.it. Like
St. Paul, he lived for nothing but the truth.
He saw the need of spreading it, of teaching
the outside world. He saw the field ripe for
the harvest. He had a greater missionary field
open before him than St. Paul himself.
Among the millions of his fellow-country
menâand he and his could teach them best,
because from experience they knew how diffi
cult it is to leave the faith of one's fathers, to
see all the traditions which brighten child
hood's dreams shattered. And the big sympa
thetic heart of Father Isaac Hecker burned to
spread the truths of the Catholic church.
As St. Paul's bitterest anxiety was for his
own "raceâ the race of Israelâ his own dear
people, whose glories were before his imagina
tion and in his affections from childhoodâ the
race which had the promises, but had madly
thrown them awayâ so, too, -were Isaac Hecker
and his followers filled with the desire to
spread the truth among the people they had
left. And when ne came to finu a name for J
his congregation there was none more suitable
than that of the apostle of the Gei.tUes. A '
noole work, a grand work is thisâ the work of
.St.* Paul.
The Paullsts only ask to be heard. Their
only desire is to spread the truth. And through
the length and breadth of this golden coast
have they gone on their work of mercy. Why
should we fear the truth? Why should the
tiuth be hid? If the full truth belli the Catholic
Church, why not hold it up before the world?
The triumph of truth is the triumph of reason,
and the triumph of reason is the glorious crown
of civilization. As Christianity had nothing to
fear but everything to Rain 'from the public
preaehiug oi St. Paul, 60, too, has the Catholic
Church everything to hope from an intelligent
presentation of its doctrines. We have noth
ing to hide, nothing to conceal. This i* the
mission of the Paulist Fathersâ to spread the
truth. And on this feast day of . their glorious
patron let us pray that God may bless their
work. Let us pray that we all may stand -firm
in the path, as St. Paul did, that the cry of
every one might be, "Lord, what wilt thou
have me to do?"
PLANS FOR THE ARMORY.
Suggestions for Alterations in . the
Building on Market
.-'/ * ' Street.-. 77 "777
-The trouble which has arisen in the new
San Francisco regiment over the choice of
an armory for the surviving companies of
the former regiments gives promise of
early settlement, and there is considerable
likelihood' that' the companies, exclusive
of the "Nationals," may be domiciled in
the building on the corner of Market and
Tenth streets.
Captain George Filmer, the commanding
officer: of Company B, has submitted to
Colonel Macdonald a plan of this armory,
with suggestions for extensive alterations,
which, if acted ' upon, would r make the
place large enough for the. entire com
mand. *.....: ;
The building was formerly the home of
the old First Infantry ; and < was erected for
regimental quarters originally. All of the
company rooms are sufficiently large 'â â  for
ordinary purposes, and: are well arranged
on the "two floors along the Market-street
front of the structure. â '}Â . â 
Captain Filmer's principal suggestion as
to alterations jis 'â  that an additional drill
floor be built directly over the one now
used, and about on a line with the present
galleries. The 1 great height of the ceiling
â  would | easily permit of | such an arrange
ment, and if the plan be adopted the com
panies located in rooms; on the upper floor
will have an immense drill hall, spreading
from side to side of the building and from
the rear wall right to the entrance to their
quarters. .The companies below will then
have exclusive use of the present hall.
A REMNANT OF HUMANITY.
The Fair Temptress of Rev. Dr.
Brown as Dr. Williams
Speaks of Her.
THE PREACHER'S PROSPECTS.
Three Lines of Defense to Be Followed
by Dr. Brown's Judges and Â«
Friends.
J-tev. Dr. C. 0. Brown will appear before
a mild court-of inquiry this evening. : 'â ;â '/â¢
Owing to his almost complete recovery
I from recent indisposition the plan of hold
| ing the sessions of the committee at Ply
; mouth Church has been changed and the
pastor's study, or office, at the First Con
gregational Church will be the scene of
the investigation. Plymouth Church is
but a block from Dr. Brown's home and
the offer of the use of that church was
made by its courteous pastor in considera
tion of the ill health of the man on trial.
Now that he is well the committee con
sults its own convenience in returning to
the former place of meeting. In case it
| continues to hold meetings, which does
not seem probable to most of the members,
the sessions will be at the First Church. 7:
Professor Lloyd conducted services \at
the ill-starred church at the corner of Post
and Mason streets yesterday afternoon and
evening. No member of the Brown family
was present at either of the services.
Dr. Brown will make his statement of
the case this evening, ana, whether it im
presses the committee favorably or not, the
reading of that statement, it is predicted,
will be followed by a motion to refer the
matter to the First Church, with the ad
vice that it call a council of Congregational
churches immediately. Members of the
committee as well as of the church are of
the opinion that a council of the churches
will serve the same and a broader purpose
in that while ' investigating Dr. Brown's
ministerial standing it. includes his stand
ing as a member of the church, of which
latter consideration only the First Church
could take cognizance. ,
Rev. Dr. W. D. Williams is known to be
in possession of information which will
be valuable in the case, ; which was fur
nished presumably by Dr. Brown and
is as yet a sealed book to g other members
of the committee of investigation. : What
this is he refuses to say but j acknowledges
that it is of such nature as to brighten
the prospects of exoneration of the sus
pected preacher. AT. p.: ,y ;-,A
"It will brighten them," he said reflect
ively, "but whether the brightness of the
noonday sun is a question, depending for
its answer upon the -varying views of the
individual members of the committee."
i "What proof would satisfy the commit
tee that Dr. Brown is* innocent?" asked a
Call reporter.
"First, that the references in Miss Over
man's letter 3 can be -explained by other
circumstances than a violation of ,the
seventh commandment. Certain other
letters of , hers may, prove this. a Second,
that it shall *be shown that Mrs. A.
Stockton's character is such that her testi
mony cannot be accepted. Third, that Dr.
Brown's purpose in .paying those sums of
money was; to aid in the conviction of
blackmailers arid extortionists."
"What view. is ' the committee likely to
take of Dr. Brown's permitting Mrs. Stock
ton to remain in the church after he knew
her true character '
| "I trust a Christian and charitable one,"
said Dr. Williams. ! i "It is no easy matter,
nor is it always well for the church, to
prefer charges and bring about a public
trial of a member. It has been my pain
ful duty to drop the names of one or two
persons from the- church roll during my
ministry. I prevented a church trial by
calling i with two of my ; deacons on the
suspected person, and if assured that he or
she intended to continue in the opposite
of a course of rectitude, to see that we
were | voluntarily authorized to quietly
drop the name from the roll."
; '". "Why did not Dr. Brown adopt such a
method?" .:
"Our methods differ. That is all."
Commenting upon Mrs. .Stockton, Dr.
Williams said: "Any woman can ruin
any man's reputation. It is ' well to avoid
antagonizing an unprincipled woman. I
have labored . most of my life for the up
lifting of humanity, yet I believe there are
some remnants of humanity that t are
hardly worth the saving. Perhaps Mrs.
Stockton is such a woman. The word of a
person living in sin can hardly be taken as
credible by a bod of persons of in
tegrity."
Dr. Williams pronounced Dr. Brown's
course in keeping Miss Overman under his
roof throughout the trouble, "Not pru
dent, but lofty." *
"I scarcely think I could rise to that
height myself," he remarked. "I would
in ad probability ask some friend to shel
ter the girl, were I attacked as Dr. Brown
has been. Yet I consider the aspersions
cast. upon him for that course as unjust."
Concerning Dr. Brown's probable exon
eration by the committee, Dr. Williams
said : "I am aware that a mass of the peo
ple of San Francisco believe Dr. Brown to
be guilty. One element of this opposition
will never believe him innocent. It is of
that .order of. humanity that rejoices in
seeing the strong fall, even if it be John L.
Sullivan. There is another element that
can be convinced. T v
"The public may be assured we will be
guided by conscience. Personally, I
would give up my place and influence
in this City to see Dr. Brown cleared of
these charges. But Congregationa'ism
and the cause of Christ must and will be
considered."
LIKE UNTO HIS BRETHREN.
Rev. Dr. W. D. Williams Speaks of
Frailties and Triumphs.
Rev. Dr. W. D. Williams preached at
Plymouth Church yesterday morning from
the text, "Wherefore in all things it be
hooved him.. to be made like unto his
brethren; for in that he himself hath suf
fered; being tempted, he is able to succor
them that are tempted." V â¢
Dr. 'â  Williams said:
The temptation of Jesus Introduces the ques
tion of his : peccability. In the middle ages
theologians, as theologians sometimes do,
wasted much valuable time in heated discus
sion about the ability of Christ to commit sin.
All agreed that he had power not to sin. The
latter is the power humanity needs. Ability
to sin is common enough. It doesn't require
much power to commit sin. It is divine to
live without sin. i
It is hard to say an agreeable thing. It is
easier to say a disagreeable thing. Jesus was
led up of the spirit into the wilderness, not re
luctantly like a victim in the train of the con
queror, but allured by the spirit of truth and
holiness. Mark says: "And immediately the
spirit drivcth him into the wilderness/ He
was driven only as a ship with canvas un
folded and tilled with a favoring breeze is
driven in her, rightful course, responsive to
the helm. Divine; power does not break or
destroy, it only bends and directs the human
will. Temptation strikes each individual in a
different place. : All: is not gold that glitters,
but all gold does not glitter. If the untempted
still shine it may be that those who do not
shine If tested and proven would shine as gold
purified with fire.
There are but few fast colors in human expe
rience. The dyes that seem so bright to-day
may wash out to-morrow.
. Many persons whose hearts were right have
been perplexed when tempted because their
heads were, wrong. It is because the devil
looks so much like an angel that he is so much
to be feared. There is not one person who
tries to live a true life but is painfully con
scious . that life is a struggle. Let us walk
firmly, for strange paths untrod lie before us
all. Let' us walk' straightly, forgetting the
crocked paths behind, and pressing on with
steadier 'purpose on our brow to accomplish
belter deeds. â -; â â â â¢â¢â 
â : The tempted Christian is infinitely better off
than tho untempted sinner^ The latter is in
sensible to temptation because morally dead.
The "former .' is quickly ; sensitive . because
morally alive. Christ's victory is a source of
encouragement to us. When Corregio first saw
the unrivaled â  creation of Raphael he raptu
rously exclaimed: "I also am a painter." The
â â uccess of Raphael- carried inspiration to his
soul. Since Christ â¢ was human and overcame
temptation we maybe inspired to, say: "We,
also, are mer-."*- What Christ did we may hope
to do if filled with his spirit.

B'NAI B'RITH CONVENTION
Annual Session of the Grand
Lodge of the Pacific
District.
RETIRING OFFICERS REPORT.
Important Recommendations In Re
gard to Financial Concerns
of the Order.
The . thirty-third annual session of the
District Grand Lodge, No. 4. 1. O. B. 8.,
convened in B'nai B'rith Hall yesterday
forenoon. This district embraces all the
Pacific States and Territories, and so wide
spread is the interest felt in tbi3 session
that scarcely a lodge is unrepresented.
After the routine opening business,
Grand President Abraham Jonas read his
annual report. After treating of the gen
eral satisfactory condition of the order the
report contained a number of important
recommendation"!. The Youths' Auxiliary
was highly indorsed and the members of
the parent lodge were urged to visit the
auxiliaries frequently and to do all in their
power to aid and encourage them. It was
also suggested that the youths be com
compelled to cease their connection with
auxiliaries upon reaching the age of 21 in
order to join the regular U'nai B'rith.
The reports of several minor committees
which had reported to the grand president
were approved. The action of the board
of hall directors in removing the free
school from the B'nai B'rith building was
deplored, as the extra expense thus in
curred made it impossible to continue the
school. The Grand Lodge owns a ma
jority of the stock in the building, and the
president recommends that some way be
provided by which their wishes may be
respected.
The principal subject of discussion in
the report is the proposed change in the
endowment plan. The order at present
pays $2000 to the beneficiaries of deceased
members. It has become an agitated
question as to whether the order will be
able to stand this in the future, and a
committee appointed at the last session
rendered a report recommending that in
stead of the present uniform assessments,
the members be assessed on a graduating
scale according to age.
The president's report does not touch on
this feature of the endowment, but it re
quests immediate consideration of the
question. It does, however, recommend
optional endowment for single or married
men; that members be allowed to leave
one-naif of their endowment to whom they
please, and that members aver 70 years of
age bo exempt from assessments, the lodge
paying tnem and deducting the amount
from their endowments.
There are a number of minor recom
mendations, such as that the bond of tbe
treasurer be reduced from $7500 to $5000,
that tbe fee for charters for new lodges be
reduced from $50 to $25, that the individual
lodges levy a per capita tax to be used in
San Francisco for the library and in other
places for liKe objects or oublic gatherings
in the interest of the order.
The report concludes with an account of
the visits the grand president has made to
various lodges during the year.
The report of Grand Secretary Jacob
Levison shows that there are now thirty
three B'nai B'rith lodges in the district
and three youths' auxiliaries. This repre
sents a total membership of 2213 benefi
ciary and 242 non-beneficiary. The finan
cial portion of the report shows the bal
ance in the treasury to be $1403 71. This
is exclusive of the widow and orphan bene
ficiary fund, which at present is $127,435 32.
The average age of decedents of the past
year was 57 years, 8 months and 12 days.
The average duration of membership was
over twenty-three years. .
The report of Grand Treasurer Julius
Platshek tallied exactly with the financial
portion of the preceding report. Both
were referred to a committee consisting of
N. W. Bender, William Lewis and H.
Black. ' '4777/ /. ' â  u/'/v/i
S. H. Schocker, Simon Hochstadter and
Benjamin Harris submitted a report as
trustees showing tbe general financial
condition of the Grand Lodge. Benjamin
Harris also submitted a minority report of
matters upon which he asserts he had not
been advised by the other trustees. Both
reports were submitted to a committee
consisting of H. P. Bush, F. Sperling, L.
Levy, J. Rothschild, S. Zekind and L.
Bernstein. Reports of tne committees on
Jaws, legislation and intellectual improve
ment were also read and referred to com
mittees.
The committee on library urged that
more encouragement be given that feature.
The board of relief, through its president,
Arthur M. Plato, suggested that its means
and scope be extended.
The session adjourned at 6 o'clock until
8 o'clock, when a discussion of the report
was had. - 7
The evening session was entirely de
voted to a discussion of the proposed
changes in the endowment plan.
No conclusion was reached and the con
vention adjourned tili to-day at 2 p. m.
THE THEATERS.
Attractions That the Managers Have to
Offer to Their Patrons This
Evening.
"in Old Kentucky" will be presented at
the California to-night, and this will be
the first night of the second week of its
presentation. The play has drawn well,
and there will no doubt be a crowded
house this evening.
The Frawley Company will this evening
offer at the Columbia Theater "Men and
Women,'' the joint production of De
Mille and Belasco. The play is some
what of the sensational order, and it has
many scenes to it to arouse an extra
ordinary interest.
"A Canting Scoundrel" is on the - bill at
Grover's Alcazar for this evening.. ; it is a
local production, and the plot is based on
the old saying of "Stealing the livery of
heaven to serve the devil in." It is said
that the playwright has produced an in
teresting play. -.â¢.*.....
At the Grand Opera-house this evening
there will be presented an American
comedy drama entitled ''The Editor,"
written by Louis Aldrich and : Charles T.
Vincent. It was originally produced at
Palmer's Theater, New York, and was a
success.
After running live weeks to crowded
houses "Ixion, or The Man of the Wheel,"
is still on at, the Tivoli Opera-house and
to-night the third edition of the produc
tion will be % given. . This I combination of
song and dialogue will be offered with new
features.
S The great drawing card at the Orpheum
Music ; Hall is the * colored nightingale,
Rachel "Walker, 7 whose wonderful notes
have captured the patrons of this house.
She will | appear | to-night, as will also a
number of artists in the specialty line.
THE . BOYS WERE SAD.
Bains Descended and the "Winds Blew,
and So the Balloon Did Not
Go Up.
4 There was disappointment yesterday
afternoon in the hearts of the small boys
at the neighborhood of Castro and Eight
eenth streets.
i The wind blew and the rain fell, but the
balloon did not go up.
' An ascension was billed by the Edmund
brothers for 3 o'clock in the large vacant
lot on Nineteenth street, between Castro
and Hartford, and all the boys for blocks
around went to -bed Saturday night with
parachutes in their heads.
The rain spoiled everything, so the boys
congregated in the doorways and under
tbe awnings of the corner grocery -stores
and talked about the last time the balloon,
did so up. '-â¢'.â¢â¢.' - t- %
"Did yon see how that parachute came
down? Ah, the wooden man on the bar
touched the ground just like a feather
comin' down."
''Wasn't she a beaut, though â went
pretty near out o' sight, didn't she, fatty?"
"Out o' sight? She must be gone a thou
sand feet!"
But the pleasure of the boys was entirely
reminiscent, for in the wetness of the
weather it was impossible to inflate the bal
loon. p<z;ly;:yy-.-s, .? nzy-y â ?;â ;,< 4pj.y -.yyy,

REALTY MARKET REVIEW
Many Noticeable Improvements
Going on in the City
Suburbs.
INTERVIEWS WITH BROKERS.
Energetic Efforts Put Forth by the
Residents of Outlying
Districts.
One of the most interesting features in
the recent history of City real estate values
is the vitality given to the suburban dis
tricts by the enterprising co-operation of
the residents of those sections and by the
extension of streetcar linos, which has
had much to do toward inducing those
persons seeking homes to push out away
from business centers.
The people living among the Mission
hills have done much to enhance the value
of their property and to bring it nearer to
the center of the City by securing the ex
tension of the several streetcar lines to
the county line. Castro, Noe and Eureka
valleys, which a few years ago were con
sidered remote from the business center,
have been made valuable and populous
districts by the energy of the residents and
property-owners.
The opening of the Joost electric road
gave a great impetus to the Fairmount
district, which lies south of Thirtieth
street and extends west from Dolores
street to the Twin Peaks range of hills. It
growth, too, was greatly stimulated by the
extension of the Mission-street car line,
completed about a year ago.
The Potrero has not been behind in the
march of improvement during the past
year, and one of that section's greatest
wants has been satisfied by the better rail
way facilities throughout the district con
necting the territory, as is now the case,
with all the leading downtown retail ar
teries. There is more hope just now for
the Potrero than in a long time.
The Folsora-street residents recently
awoke to the fact that their property has
been decreasing in value for several years
past, and that their street, which is one of
the main thoroughfares south of Market,
has been standing still. By united effort
they have secured an appropriation of
$35,000, the first step toward the rejuvina
tion of Folsom street from tide water to
the Mission hills.
The district south of the park panhan
dle and including the site of the old
Haight-street baseball grounds, subdivided
some six months ago, has grown like
Aladdin's castle, which arose in a night,
and what was an expansive waste a few
years since ' is now a prosperous and
thickly settled portion of the City. En
terprise of a good building character, such
as this district possesses, cannot go on at a
too rapid rate.
The extension of the settlement south
of the park is only a matter of a very
short time. This is a prediction conceded
by all since the acceptance of the Sutro
site for the Affiliated Colleges, the con
struction of which will be followed by the
Sutro Library. The openine of these in
stitutions will lead to other improvements
and serve to attract the attention of home
seekers and speculators.
The westward growth of the City is rap
idly falling up all vacant land in the West
ern Addition, and it cannot be many years
before the overflow will be crowding into
the area on the other side of the cemeteries
till further progress is stopped at the beach
by the ocean. In less than ten years Pre
sidio Heights, covered with sand dunes
and a growth of chaparral, has become one
of the most sought for and finest residence
localities in the City. Few districts have
witnessed such a change as that experi
enced in Richmond property west of the
cemeteries, between the Presidio and
Golden Gate Park ; and the transition is
likely to be accelerated by the railroads
extending their lines westward through
the district.
On every side the spirit of improvement
is manifest. The property-owners of each
section are vieinc with those of every other
district in an effort to build up their par
ticular portion of the City.
In speaking of the improvements south
of the park, Wendell Faston said in a re
cent interview:
One of the most important sections of the
City, comprising an ownership of a number of
prominent people of this City, lying adjacent
to Golden Gate Park on the south, and west of
First avenue, has received Its due proportion
of attention, and at this time is oh the eve of
quits extended improvements. A concerted
movement was made not long since by the
property-owners south of Golden Gate Park,
from First avenue to Eighteenth avenue,
which finally succeeded in getting the estab
lishment of grades, which has encouraged
moderate Improvements in grading of streets
and construction of a few dwellings.
The donation of Adolph Sutro for the Af
filiated Colleges on Parnassus avenue, which
is the extension of Sullivan street extending
south of the park, has given an interest to
the more important class of improvements and
will result in bringing to the official grade
quite a piece of land lying between First and
(Seventh avenues and immediately adjacent to
the park.
This work undoubtedly will be carried on
from Seventh avenue to Seventeenth avenue,
and means the opening of important streets,
sewerage system, as well as improvements of a
general character.
The abandonment of the Metropolitan Rail
way is inducing the Market-street people to
construct an electric line to take the place of
the dummy line-now on II street, and without
doubt the railway competition to the ocean,
now developing, will bring about the entire
reconstruction of tnis line. An improved elec
tric system, with quick transportation from
the center of the City, with one fare from the
ferry, would mean quite an impetus to the sec
tion known 8s the South Side.
The Park Commissioners have just let the
contract for the boulevard south and connect
ing with the old Ocean-house road, which is
to be completed by the Ist of May. This im
provement will undoubtedly be the base line
of improvements in the western portion of this
section, and, all in all, it is a safe prediction
that it will not be long before this territory
will be reclaimed from drifting sand-dunes
and become a desirable portion of the City for
residence purposes.
In discussing the developments of the
Southwest Mission, J. J. O'Farrell last
week remarked :
The extension of the electric street railways
In the Southwest Mission and the vast im
provements made on the- Mission road have
opened up and brought into close connection
with the business center a portion of the City
heretofore considered remote and largely set
tled by the working classes. The homes of the
better class built in this section of San Fran
cisco last season will run far up into the thou
sands. Since the extension oi the Mission car
line a wonderful transformation has taken
place along its course. An era of street im
provement and the establishment of a park on
this side is fully expected.
It is evident that this district is becoming a
more favored residence location. Since the ad
vent of means of rapid transit, many people
have secured homes in the Mission and grati
fied a desire to live in the mild and balmy por
tion of the City. Speculation, too, in Mission
property cannot result disastrously, for it is in
line with the certain development of the City
With a City unbounded by a large body of water
or abrupt hills it is difficult sometimes to tell
which point of the compass will mark the trend
of the City's growth, but with San Francisco
there is no room for error. The property-own
ers of tne Mission have made a good showing
during 1895, which it ls expected the improve
ments of this year will surpass.
"In looking over the appropriations of
money for different; parts of the City one
notices a. startling discrepancy between
the amount â  received from a section for
taxes and the returns to that district in
the shape of either benefits or improve
ments,'' said J. J. McEwen to a Call rep
resentative, and he continued:
Take the southern part of town, for instance,
embracing the region between , Market and
Channel streets, from the ferry out to Twenty
sixth, which is the oldest and most populous
portion of the City. It paid into the City treas
ury this year about $2,000,000 in taxes, and
outside of the general care furnished by the
City, that is fire and police protection, schools,
etc.", the only additional fund set aside for its
betterment is the insignificant amount of
$1500 for South Park. In comparison with
this we have the immense allowance of
$98,500 for care and improvement of parks
and squares in the other parts of the City, and
this docs not take into consideration at all the
lew of about $300,000 for Golden Gate Park.
While no one begrudges money honestly ex
pended for improving or beautifying the City,
still all these benefits should not be confined
to any particular section. The money derived
from "each part of the City should be returned
to it again, as nearly as possible, in benefits,
and where there aro.no parks and squares to
beautify, the streets should be improved and
kept in'order. What the south side of the City
needs, especially, is well-paved streets con
necting the water front with the main outlets
from the City. The cost of one proposed street
is only $10,000, and would be but a small por
tion of the money paid by this section into the
Tax Collector's office.
The parks, such as Columbia square and
Holly Park, can be allowed to remain for an
other year if this money is spent for a thor
oughfare, but when the appropriation is made
next year an equitable portion of the levy
should be spent on this side, which is the most
populous section of the whole City. One-half
of the funds in the Street Department should
be used here, in fact for the next two years
should Justice be done the greater part of the
fund should be used in tuis section.
To show how the southern suburbs feel about
the justice done them in the wav the money is
spent may be cited the disappointed Holly
Park petitioners, who asked that $5000 be
spent in reclaiming and improving their park,
and who teceived through their petition one
solitary policeman to guard them.
I During the past few years the popula
tion of the suburbs of the Mission district
in the vicinity of Castro and Thirtieth
streets has increased wonderfully, and
hundreds of houses have been built and
many streets have been graded and sew
ered, observed A. S. Baldwin in speaking
of suburban improvements:
Tho Castro-street Land Company, for in
stance, have expended pretty well on to
$20,000 in improving their hip; subdivision in
this section of the City, continued Mr. Bald
win, and it is this display of public spirit
that has caused the southwestern limits of the
City to grow month by month aud make a
pretty favorable comparison with other
suburbs of San Francisco. The growth of the
City in this direction has reached a point
which a few years ago would have been con
sidered remote, and it now- looks as if in a very
short time Castro-street Addition will be cov
ered with houses.
The streets have ail been graded and sewered
and macadamized, and water mains are laid
throughout the tract. The petition of the Fair
mount Improvement Club for a boulevard
across this addition to Golden Gate Park has
been granted, provided the Stanford Heights
Land Company will continue the driveway
through their subdivision. In the agitation of
Mission residents for a park the directors of the
Castro-street Land Company nave taken the
lead by reserving about eighty acres for recrea
tion grounds, on which it is the intention in a
month or two to plant out 75,000 shade trees.
It is reported that at the next tax levy an
appeal will be made for an appropriation to
improve Fairmount square, which belongs to
the City, and which has always been an eye
sore. Sunnyside, Castro-street Addition and
the district lying beyond are to have a school
house. While the schoolhouso is being erected
a temporary building is to be used. Educa
tional advantages will not be lacking from
this time on in this neighborhood. It was
about a year ago that the citizens in the south
western portion of San Francisco's suburbs be
gan to make themselves heard, and they have
ever .since kept their district before the public.
Thomas Magee's views of the extension
of the suburbs are tersely expressed in the
following statement by him:
Newspapers talk of the narrow space into
which the hundreds of thousands of "people of
New York City and the millions of London are
squeezed, as if it were a solemn duty for us to
follow their example, and pen our people up
like swine. They forget that if the people of
New York were properly housed the city would
spread over three "times us much space as it
now occupies. We trust that it always will be
true that San Francisco covers a greater pro
portionate space than any other of the large
commercial cities ot the world, so that we may
always have elbow room and fresh air. To live
in London or New York tenements is almost to
forget what sunlight looks like or how fresh
air feels. The people of San Francisco may
be thankful that they have not been, and are
never likely to be, thus closely huddled to
gether.
H. A. "Whitely of the Real Estate and
Development Company, when interviewed
on the Potrero improvements, gave the fol
lowing report:
The past year has been an active one in the
Potrero district, many thousands of dollars
having been expended in permanent imnrove
ments to the public thoroughfares. Below is

of Army street eastward to Kentucky, and of
lowa street, from Nevada to Yolo, and Pennsyl
vania avenue, from Yolo to Army street,
which work was completed during 1895
makes a total of over Â§60,000 spent for street
improvements alone in the Potrero for the past
year.
It is a very difficult matter to secure accurate
and reliable data as to the cost of street im
provements, especially when it is attempted to
cover an entire district for a period of a year,
but the above is fairly accurate, and is below
rather than above the actual cost, as there may
be minor items and private contract work
which has been overlooked. :
A necessary and important work that has re
cently been accomplished in that section of
the City is the surveying and planning of a
sewer system in the district bounded on the
north by Sixteenth street, west by Protrero
avenue, east by Missouri and Connecticut
streets, and south by the summit ot the hills;
also another sewer system in the district
bounded by Missouri, Minnesota, Sixteenth
and Twentieth streets. This work was done by
the City Engineer, in accordance with an order
of the Board of Supervisors.
By having a comprehensive drainage system
established, property-owners will now be ena
bled to carry out many needed improvements,
with a knowledge that the work is being done
systematically.
j Among the enterprising citizens in Noe
j valley is Jacob Heyman, the real-estate
! broker, owner of what is known as the
j Heyman Tract. During the past two years
j the progressive residents of this section of
| the City have spent large sums in im-
I proving their streets and putting in sewers.
"There is no reason that we should not have
! better paved streets, especially in the suburbs,"
taid Mr. Heyman -in- a recent interview, "as
material is certainly plentiful and the im
provement to the appearance of the City would
make it famous. Other cities have won fame
through well-paved streets and boulevards,"
continued Mr. Heyman, "and there is no
reason why this City should not possess a
similar reputation. .
"Property certainly advances on well-paved
streets, and where the cost has been but 5 per
cent on a lot for this improvement of the
streets adjoining, the value of the lots has in
creased 25 per cent. Owners often object to
the first cost of a solid, smooth and clean nave
ment; but if they would consider that after a
time the clogging and breaking up of sewers
on account of the breaking down of macadam
ized streets through heavy rains and teaming,
causing thereby a great deal of expense and
annoyance, they would gladly approve of
bitumen or asphalt. .
"Eight years ago there were no graded streets
in Noe Valley, but by continual agitation and
encouragement and the impetus given by the
construction by the Castro-street cable "road
and later of the electric branches from the
Mission electric line we have been enabled to
grade, sewer, macadamize and sidewalk the
whole district. ..*â â¢â 
"Following close on these improvements in
streets and transportation facilities cottages
began to spring up, and after awhile here and
* i er vi a - ore - and land which was before â¢ un
salable was in demand at better prices than
could be obtained a few years before.
â¢ "The latest of such work in my section has
been done on Twenty-fourth 'street as far as
Castro, and before long similar changes will
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1896.
be agitated on this streets in the Heyman
Tract. I have lately had these streets sewered
and macadamized at my own expense.;
"The proper paving of â¢ the streets in any
city should take place at an early date in its
history, and is, in fact, necessary to any con
siderable degree of fame as a great city;
"The streets of Rome, as well as the high
ways, were paved in an elaborate manner.
Portions of the ancient pavement of the streets
oi Rome are in use to the present day, and the
pavement of Pompeii remains intact. â *,
"The plan now adopted in all the European
cities is to secure a solid foundation, varying in
thickness according to the amount of traffic it
has to bear; this is done, where the 'natural
substratum is not of a solid kind, by covering
the street with a solid bed of concrete, having
a slope from the middle to the sides to throw
off the water. On the concrete is placed the
asphaltum, making an almost everlasting
pavemert, and a comfort to both man and
beast. The great obstacle in the way of laying
really good pavement at present in San Fran
cisco is the necessity of breaking it up for the
laying and repairing of water, sewer and gas
pipes. The true remedy, and in the end the
cheapest, would be to have, in the chief streets
at least, subways or tunnels for all drains and
pipes which would be accessible without
breaking up the pavement."
W. E. Fisher of Will E. Fisher . & Co..
had the following to say of Richmond's
growth : 'â  .-A'-*7
It is difficult to mention any one section of
the City which has not witnessed a steady in
crease in the number and value of the im
provements which have been made during
the past year. Perhaps that section of the
City where the most noticeable improvement
has taken place is that known as Richmond.
Here private enterprise enforced by railroad
extension and street work, including sewer
construction, has worked a transformation.
The 5 cent fare to the Cliff House has
attracted many investors from among the
renting class, who have bought lots and,
erected on them cottages. We have a credit
of twenty-six such; built by parties to whom
we sold lots in Richmond during the past year.
The building and loan societies have given
most favorable terms to their Richmond
clients and the result has been that many have
been enabled to build homes paying for them
in monthly sums, very little in advance of
that they formerly paid for rent. It is safe to
predict that more buildings will be erected in
Richmond during 1890 than there will be in
any other section of the City. -:â¢â  â¢'/- j
C. 11. Reynolds, whose operations have
been largely conducted in the Richmond
district, is also elated over the p:ospect of
better car facilities. He said last Satur
day:
The completion of the Sutro line to the Cliff
House marks the beginning of a new era for
Richmond. Property-owners In that district
have been bottled up, as it were, with a go-as
you-please steam car on Sundays half way out
on D street and no car at all on Point
Lobos avenue, was originally the finest
driveway on the peninsula. Iv view of the
rapid westward development of the Western
Addition, I am surprised that the Market
street Railway Company did not promptly
comply with its franchises. As a consequence
of its backwardness in this respect there is no
telling how much this district has been re
tarded.
For a short time past out as far as Seventh
avenue there has been accommodation by the
Geary and Sacramento-street lines, but beyond
there has been practically no streetcar service.
As Sutro's road, which goes into operation
on the first day of February, passes directly
through the heart of Richmond, every man,
woman and child in the district ought "to feel
deeply grateful to him for the new road and
new order of things.
"Should San Francisco take a rapid
growth, as she is certain to do in the near
future, her suburbs would develop faster
than the average city, being bounded on
two sides by the bay," said A. M. Speck in
commenting on the City's prospective de
velopment. -'"ii
A friend of mine living in a Western city,
continued Mr. Speck, had the relation of the ex
tension of city suburbs and real estate values,
emphasized to him in a way so impressive as
to be the means of making his fortune. He
bought a lot in an unimproved district and
built a small cottage, which was occupied by
himself and wife. He worked away for a few
years on an income none too large to afford a
comfortable living. Gradually houses began
to spring up within a few blocks of him, and
kept getting closer and closer until he found
himself surrounded by a group of near neigh
bors. -.-*' /: :.;
> He asked one of them the cost of the" lot on
which a newcomer's house was being built and
was surprised to learn that the said lot cost
just twice as much per f jot as his own lot cost
him only a few years before that. This set him
to thinkingâ thinking seriouslyâ and he talked
the matter over with his wife. He reasoned
that If the slight improvements and the street
car line, which had recently come within two
blocks, had caused an advance of 100 per cent â¢
in five years, why could not he move a little :
farther out and accomplish the same result in :
a year by enterprising movements. He sold
and increased his possessions farther out, and
in less than five years he had made his fortune
by speculation in suburban property in a pros
perous Western town.

ARMY AND NAVY NOTES
Dynamite Guns Successfully
Handled by the Fifth
Artillery.^
THE BATTLE - SHIP OREGON.
Battery of Eight-Inch Rifles in Posi
tionâThe Ship Could Fight on
Short Notice.
Sentinels night and day now guard the
pneumatic or dynamite battery at the Pre
sidio. Some months ago General Graham,
commanding the post, was criticized *by
one of the City dailies for not having a
guard posted at the guns. At that time
the guns and plant belonged to the con
structors, a New York electrical company,
and General Graham had no right whatever
to make a detail of United States troops
to guard the private property. Since then
the guns and plant have been accepted by
the Government and formally placed in
the hands of the commandant of the gar
rison. * >.* -..,' â  -â â¢ " ,
Last Friday General Graham, accompan
ied by the officers of the Fifth Artillery
stationed at the Presidio, worked the plant
successfully. . The steam engine which
generates power and electrical dynamos
which manipulate the guns were put in
operation and a drill of instruction fol
lowed.
Officers and enlisted men will be in-
I structed in handling the plant from time
! to time until the apparatus for charging the
i chambers with compressed air, adjusting
| the guns and placing the shells in position,
j can be as well operated by the soldiers as
|by the contractors. v ;/.////:
It is fortunate for the service that the
! dynamite guns are placed in the hands of
! a body of men intelligent and progressive,
ln this regard -it is doubtful if the Fifth
Artillery, as a regimental organization,
embracing commissioned officers and en
listed men, has its superior in the United
States army.
The examining board has held frequent
sessions at the Presidio during the past
three weeks, and many officers listed for
promotion have been before the board for
examination. The form of examination,
embracing questions to be answered and
problems to be solved, is laid down by the
department. The board applies the rule
and reports the result. If an officer fails
to pass the ordeal he is eiven one year's
time to make another effort, and then, if
he fails the second time, the wide world is
open to him outside of the army. In the
year's time between the first and second
examinations successful candidates may
pass him in order of promotion. The sys
tem is said to be productive of the best re
sults, as it requires study and intelligence
upon tha part of young officers to keep in
line.
The peace theories of the service are
beautiful, but when war comes many of
the systems are upset. Frequently it
happens that soldiers dull at their books
and laggard at mathematics display
qualities of sagacity, tenacity and enter
prise on the field that cast in the shade
the achievements of the "bookish" men in
the army.
A general court-martial, consisting of
the following: officers, was convened at the
Presidio January 22: Major John A. Dar
ling, Fifth Artillery; Captain James
Lockett, Fourth Artillery; Captain John
McCleilan, Fifth Artillery; First Lieuten
ant Alexander T. Dean, Fourth Cavalry;
First Lieutenant John D. Miley, Fifth Ar
tillery; First Lieutenant Nathaniel F. Mc-
Clure, Fifth Cavalry; Second Lieutenant
Wilmot E. Ellis, Fifth Artillery; Second
Lieutenant Thomas W. Winston, Fifth
Artillery; Second Lieutenant Louis R.
Burgess, Fifth Artillery; First Lieutenant
John A. Lockwood, Fourth Cavalry, judge
advocate. " *
Sometimes it will happen that a few
hard cases will get into the best regiments
of the service. Assumed names may be
given and false records presented to the
recruiting officer.
It is known that several tough custom
ers got into Battery A, Fifth Artillery,
and it is now the purpose of the com
manding officer to get them out. Two
have been tried by court-martial' and dis
missed from the service. Others will be
tried and, if found guilty, expelled.
A board of medical officers, consisting
of Major . Benjamin F. Pope, surgeon;
Major Joseph B. Girard, surgeon, and
First Lieutenant Charles E. B. Flagg, as
sistant surgeon, was convened at Angel
Island January 24.
Dr. Ireland, "U. S. A.', arrived from Fort
Stanton, N. Mex., last Thursday, and went
on duty at Benicia. The post at Fort
Stanton has been abandoned.
Barracks No. 2 of the double-brick row
at the Presidio is now ready to receive
troops. 'A./7 " /^A'-Vy^A
Work on the superstructure of the new
steel wharf at the Presidio is under way.
Owing to the recent stormy weather build
ing operations have been delayed.
The canteen at Alcatraz yields a divi
dend of $2 per quarter to every enlisted
man at the post. The articles sold are
charged at but a slight advance over
actual cost.
Many array officers stationed here are
inclined to credit the statements tele
graphed from Washington that an appli
cation on the part of Colonel Crofton, Fif
teenth Infantry, for- retirement would be
acceptable to the department. Colonel
Crofton is not a West Point graduate.
Early in 1861 political influence in Wash
ington procured him a captain's commis
sion in the United States army. He is a
native of England or Ireland,* and prob
ably had some youthful experience in the
British service before he came to the
United States. He did not gain distinc
tion or promotion during the war, but be
ing in the regular army, promotion in nat
ural order since gave him rank as colonel.
It requires a pretty firm grasp to handle a
regiment of troops, \ especially when the
command is stationed near a large city.
The fifteenth, since it lias been stationed
at Fort Sheridan, Chicago, has supplied
several scandals, including one homicide.
Officers assert that a firm man is required
at the head of that regiment.
i Lieutenant-Commander James W. Car
jin, U. S. N., left San Francisco last even
ing for a visit to relatives in Carthage.

one #of the heroes of the Vandalia in the,
great hurricane at ; Apia, Samoa, some
years ago, and gained the recognition of
Congress for his heroism and 'coolness tin

he has served on the -Monterey, but will
probably be assigned to duty on the Inde
pendence at the 'expiration of his leave of
absence. -
The battle-ship Oregon is now equipped
with her battery of eight- rifles, and is
ready to receive the ; thirteen-inch _ guns.
In a great emergency, the Oregon could be
placed in fighting trim within three weeks'
time. The thirteen-inch guns could not
be placed in position for effective use
within that time, but the ship could make
&'. good - fight with her eight-inch guns
should her presence in action :be de
manded. The Oregon is at the Union Iron'
Works.
CASTRO OF CASTRO VILLE. -
A Young: Dressmaker Arrested for
Stealing 8700 From Him.
Stephen Castro, agent for Wells, Fargo
& Co. atCastroville.had an unpleasant ex
perience Nellie : Murphy, ' a * young
dressmaker, early Saturday morning.
He was a guest at the Golden West Hotel
and Friday night he started out to take in
the sights. About 2 o'clock .' Saturday
morning he met Nellie on Grant avenue,
between Bush and Sutter streets, and the
two visited several - saloons. Then Nellie
took him to the hotel and left him.
Castro on Saturday morning reported to
the police that when he met Nellie he bad
about $1100 in his pocket and after she
had left him he found that $700 was
missing and he blamed her for stealing it
from him.
Detective Gibson and Policeman Clarke
were detailed on the case and on Saturday
night they arrested Nellie and a female
companion at 514 Pine street. They were
taken to the City Prison and yesterday
morning Castro identified Nellie as the
woman who was with him. She was also
identified by several saloon-keepers and
barkeepers who saw her and Castro
together. She was booked for grand
larceny and her companion was released
from custody. The money has not been
recovered. : â'-.â¢-.
Degrees for "Women.
There seems to be some probability that
the admission of women to degrees at Ox
ford and Cambridge is within measurable
distance. At least, movement in this di
rection has been made of late and is still
being made at Oxford, and if one univer
sity is sensible enough to make this educa
tional advance, the other can scarcely fail
to follow suit. There is nothing, one
would imagine, to be said against such a
step, for it is manifestly absurd to permit
women to compete with men for a prize,
so to say, and then, when they win, deny
it to them because of their sex. â Lady's

lector when their bills are due. The move
ment has taken active shape and a com
mittee is now at work compiling a list of !
official beats. The exchange will also j
work to have the next Legislature modify j
the present insolvency bill. They contend
that the present legislation offers too much j
inducement to certain people to avoid pay- I
ing their just debts. That the position
taken by the exchange is not without foun
dation has recently been proved. A short
time ago a county official who is in receipt
of a good salary filed a petition in insolv
ency, and an investigation held yesterday
into the conduct of a police officer proved
that the official owes nearly three times as
much now as he did when' appointed, and
he has been drawing $100 a month right j
along. These facts have opened the mer
chants' eyes and they will endeavor to !
profit by the experience.
f^There is a rule of the Police and Fire j
departments that the members must pay !
their bills or suffer dismissal, but the rule
has not been applied to any other city or
county department. It has long been
considered a piece of class legislation that
a fireman with $75 per month should be
made to pay for his groceries while a
county official with $5000 a year should be
free to beat everybody he desires.
It so happens that "the secretary of the
Exchange is also a School Director, and he I
lias promised that he will use all his en- !
deavor toward having a rule passed that a
school-teacher shall be liable to dismissal !
who does not pay legitimate debts. While '
this will be all that can be done locally, 'â 
the merchants will try to have the in- j
solvency act so amended as to reach higher
game.
I 'urine the past twelve months several
agents representing "large interests" anx
ious to locate in Alameda Count}- have
made their appearance in Oakland and
elsewhere. They have represented gun
makers, boxmakers, bicycle-makers and
glassblowers. They have invariably inter
ested the various public bodies in the cities
and towns, and have been given an oppor
tunity to display their samples and to ex
plain their alleged value. By talking
plausibly about the great advantage that
would inure to the town where they located
them, the increased circulation of money
and the addition to the population, they
have generally created favorable impres
sions. In every instance, however, they
have been making the same offer in a
dozen different towns and asking for in
ducements, and by bidding one community
against the other they have finally found
a very generous offer.
The last case on record happened last
Wednesday night at Livermore. An
agent for a large class works was anxious i
to locate near the Corral Hollow mines, !
and would em ploy*,. over a hundred people i
before the end of two years. He had given i
considerable attention to glass factories '
and had found that there was a greater
need for one in California than for any
other kind of factory. The canners,
brewers and druggists and orchardists are
large consumers", and sufficient business
could be obtained to keep a first-class
plant running for at least ten months in
the year, The Livermore League of
Progress called a special meeting, and
were to make a definite statement to the
agent and were to close the deal.
Meeting night came and a goodly at
tendance was present. After waiting
nearly an hour the agent failed to appear
and the Livermore folks concluded that
he had, like most folks who disappear,
met with foul play. Great was their sur
urise a couple of days later to learn that
while they were waiting for the glass
agent, he was at Martinez telling the
people that he had a semi-concession from
hermore. The League of Progress
denies that he has a semi or any other
kind of concession from Livermore, and
says that until he apologizes for his lack
of respect they want nothing more to do
with him. J*. W. Booth.

BALL-PLAYERS AT WORK
New Men Will Be Given a i
Chance on Wednesday to
Show Their Skill.
The.Philosophical Union Has Secured
the Services of a Noted Scholar
for Next Term.
BERKELEY, Cai., Jan. 26.-The base
ball season at the University of California I
will open next Wednesday afternoon with j
a game between the sophomore and fresh
man classes. The weather having been so
stormy since the beginning of the spring
terra it has not been possible for the play
ers to do much team work on the dia
mond. The. captains of the two nines
which will take the initiative for the sea- |
son of '96 at Berkeley next Wednesday
have not yet announced their players.
Organization for the season's work is far
from complete on account of the inability
of the men, especially in the freshman
class, to show what they are capable of
doing. This lack of development of plans
is due almost wholly to the inclement
weather.
The colleges at Berkeley will have in
addition to the teams from Stanford and
the Reliance and Olympic clubs danger
ous rivals in the nines from the law and
dental colleges. The prospects for bril
liant work from these two latter teams
seem more encouraging than at any other
season since the affiliated colleges identi
fied themselves with the baseball league.
This step in advance is due to the secur
ing of several veteran players on the
diamond. ~/T/:
The law college nine will be made up
chiefly from the junior class.
Walthal, the captain, giant guard on
last year's 'varsity football team, will act
as pitcher. He has the reputation of be
ing second only to Bert Oliver of the Re
liance Club in swiftness. Kemp, alternate
pitcher, has some evasive curves in his
repertoire, and being a 10 4-5 seconds
sprinter, he is exceptionally good at mak
ing bases. . .
For catcher the most prominent aspi
rant is Kennedy, formerly of Santa Clara.
He is quite a heavy man, but quick and
active, playing at his best in an uphill
game. , Â
The likeliest candidates from the upper
classes are Stanley Jackson and Bernheim. â 
Jackson was manager of the U. C. baseball
! team in 1893, knows the game thoroughly
1 and is well qualified for first base or catcher
Bernheim is the star shortstop of the
I 'varsity talent, playing in that position on
i the U. C. team last year against Stanford,
I Olympic and Reliance. Bernheim will not
play against Stanford this season, being
barred out by the graduate rule of the new
intercollegiate agreement, but he will be a
formidable addition to the law team in the
interclass games. Among the other players
from the junior class are Brehm. Clarke,
Church, Deahl, Gardiner, Haynes, Mackin
! tosh, Payne and Peters.
The dental college team will be some
what handicapped in the matter of prac
ticing together, since the hours ordinarily
set aside for work on the diamond conflict
with their periods for college work. They
expect, however, to spend three or four
hours a week together at Central Park.
Henry Abraham, the manager of the
team, states that he is in receipt of many
inquiries regarding the prospects of his
team in the proposed contest with the
U. C. juniors.
Captains Morden and Harvey will form
the battery for the dental college, and it is
anticipated that they will do great things
for their colors, both having played in
'varsity teams in former years. Arelauner
will play first base, Haynes second and
Manager Abraham third. Though the ex
act positions of the rest of the players who
have identified themselves with the team
have not been fully decided upon, it is
generally understood that Scott will play
shortstop, McPike substitute pitcher and
Roth in the field. Other candidates for
field places are Richards, Raymond, Keefe,
Bonnell and Jones.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, IS9G.
BY ANNIVERSARY SERVICES
Two Branches of the Christian
Association Commemorate
the Day.
BISHOP GOODSELL SPEAKS.
The Eloquent Methodist Divine Is
Heard by a Large Audience.
Forty-Third Year.
The forty-third anniversary of the estab
lishment of the Young Men's Christian
Association in San Francisco was com
memorated with a praise service and special
exercises in the association auditorium.
Impressive as the special exercises were,
the principal feature was the splendid an
niversary address by Rev. D. A. Goodsell,
D.D., LL.D.. resident Bishop of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church.
The hail was filled with young men and
old, and there were many ladies in the
audience. All participated with fervor,
remembering the occasion was in com
memoration of a happy event in the his
tory of San Francisco's Young Men's
Christian Association. Upon the platform
SECRETARY NOEL 11. JACKS. ASSISTANT SECRETARY F. A. JACKSON.
PROMINENT OFFICERS OF THE Y. M. C. A., OAKLAND BRANCH.
[Reproduced from photographs. ]
were quite a large number of gentlemen
who have been prominently identified
with religious movements as well as Y.
M. C. A. work. ipPiy
The ceremonies began with a service of
praise led by D. M. Lawrence, at which
the congregation sang "The Banner of the
Cross," "Rescue the Perishing," "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," "I Hear Thy Wel
come Voice," and '-Labor On."
The praise service over the anniversary
exercises began with J. J. Valentine pre
siding. All sang as an introduction the
hymn "Coronation." after which Rev. W.
A. Rader, pastor of the Third Congrega
tional Church, read the twelfth chapter of
Romans as a scripture lesson. Rev. R. J.
Briggs of Centenary Methodist Church
led in prayer, and a qnartet sang selected
hyms.
Mr. Valentine addressed the audience
briefly, announcing that the meeting was
held to celebrate the forty-third anniver
sary â and then reviewing the history of
the Y. M. C. A. throughout the world. "He
said that the year just closed was a favor
able one for the association in every land,
and new friends were springing up on all
sides. He introduced the subject of debt
upon the new ouilding and declared with
emphasis that it was pressing hard upon the
rrrunagement.and unless balance of $28,-
-000 were paid by friends of the iustitutoin
there was grave danger that the building
would have to be incumbered. An appeal
was made for contributions that the asso
ciation could proceed in its path un
trammeled by financial difficulties.
The latter portion of * Mr. Valentine's re
marks were in favor of education and
moral influence as bestowed upon young
men by the association.
The hymn, "While the Days Are Going
By," was sung by the audience standing,
and then Bishop Goodsell was intro
duced.-388|i9
The Bishop began by saying he was glad
that he was permitted to speak before a
San Francisco audience on the Young
Men's Christian Association. It was a joy,
he sam, that he could stand before the
audience and speak the word of truth.
Turning to Mr. Valentine he said he be
lieved tnat when a business man stood up
to plead the cause of Christ his words had
a greater weight even than those of the
minister of the Gospel, who was too often
looked upon as a paid advocate of a stated
cause. And so he was most deeply Im
pressed by the address of the president.
"Why is it that when you enter a large
city traffic carries you through and you
first see the lower forces before seeking or
finding the spiritual?" he asked. Into
cities railroads pass at the backs of resi
dences, by low saloons. These considera
tions present the fact that men are sup
ported, influenced, carried on by forces;
and that men who know the most of the
forces in the world to-day are most suc
cessful. The Bishop said he believed these
forces could be harnessed in behalf of
Christ. The Y. M. C. A. was the outcome
of forces around men and was harnessing
those energies.
Bishop Goodsell described his impres
sions of San Francisco. What impressed
him deepest was the cable-car systemâ the,
car that, moved along without visible forces,'
no puff of steam, no flash of electricity.
He searched for the force that carried
those cars along.
"When I looked up to the sun I ex
claimed: There, there is the source of
power. And when I saw globes, worlds,
whirling about it I saw the source of
power was beyond and I knew it came
from the arm of God."
Fairness demands that all forces should
be investigated, and if there is an energy
in this City that would make a man look
into himself that force is well worth y of
study. It is the power of the Holy Spirit.
The one thing men need to know is
themselves. Every one feels that the
greatest advantage that can come to any
soul is to step out of itself, contemplate
itself and compare it with some ideal.
These forces are around men and the great
point of education is to know how to use
them. A great thing has been done for a
soul when it has been made to look upon
itself, study itself and by comparison see
how it may be improved.
In this City there is an : awful waste of
power somewhere; there are numbers of
men and women playing with toys with
out a realization of the ideal of Christ.
Wherever are churches, Christian associa
tions, there are the realization, the devel
opment of forces. - ...
Wealth had not been laid- liberally
enough at the door of l the association hall
to make it the institution that it should be
for a home j for young men, and Bishop
Goodsell prayed that people * would come
forward and support it as it deserved.
The services â  were concluded with a
benediction pronounced by Rev. Dr. Coyle.
The San Francisco branch of the associ
ation was* organized in September, 1853,
and first located, over; the Postoffice on
Clay street, opposite the plaza. Monthly
meetings were held ,in the little German
church on Dupont . street, ; near Pine.
Early in '56 the headquarters changed to
Armory building, Sacramento and Mont-
J gomery streets, and in '58 to 629 Washing
ton street.. In '64 the association i pur
chased a lot at 522 California street and
erected a building for itself on that siteâ
the first building owned by the Y. M. C.
A. in the United States. In January,
IS6B, ground was broken for the building
on Sutter street, which was dedicated in
November of the following year. Since
that time the history of the association
has been one of progress and good work.
Branches have been established through
out the City, new features introduced and
constantly enlarged for more efficient
work, while the spiritual well-being of its
members was improved with the social
and temporal aims of the association; In
September, 1894, the present magnificent
building on Mason and Ellis streets was
completed at a cost of $335,000, and now
the San Francisco association has one of
the most complete and most imposing as
sociation buildings in the country.
SIXTEEN YEARS OF "WORK.
The Y. M. C. A. Anniversary Celebrated
in Oakland Churches.
OAKLAND, Cai,., Jan. 26.â The seven
teenth anniversary of the Young Men's
Christian Association was celebrated in as
many churches in this city to-day. The
annual report was read at each service and
sermons delivered in keeping with the
celebration.
Secretary Noel H. Jacks compiled the
report and it shows a year of active and
successful work. His assistant, Mr. Jack
son, has also done his share toward the
success of the association.
"The work has been largely one of recon
struction," says the report, "but vigorous
activity has been noticeable in every de
partment. The association takes its place
in Oakland to-day as an indispensable
agency of the church in reaching and in
fluencing the young men who throng our
oity. Our membership and the young
men who attend the various^ meetings,
talks, lectures, receptions, etc., represent
many nationalities and classes of men.
"Young men are constantly coming and
going, and during the past twelve months
many have been influenced by us, who to
day are scattered throughout the world.
The association has sought to provide in
Oakland a social headquarters for young
men, where they can spend their leisure
time not only in pleasant intercourse
under good influences but with every help
for mind, body and spiritual life.
"It consults not only the tastes of young
men in this respect but also their needs.
For the social it has healthful and at
tractive amusements; to the studious it
offers a well-stocked reading-room, educa
tional classes and lectures; for those seek
ing physical exercise and healthful recrea
tion it presents the gymnasium with
trained instructor. Around all the asso
ciation seeks.,, to throw, sound moral and
religious influences. "Prevention is better
than cure" its the great principle under
lying the work of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association.
"The year 1595 witnessed some substan
tial developments in the association which
would take too much time to enlarge
upon, so I can only give a few details, but
they will show in some degree the magni
tude of the work. This compiling of
figures, however, is only as an index
finger pointing to results that cannot be
computed. When we report that such a
number have come into the building dur
ing the year or that so many have at
tended our lectures, the numbers convey
to our mind some idea of the value set
upon the privileges offered, but eternity
alone can reveal the true magnitude, the
far-reaching importance of the work.
"In the sixty-seven religious meetings
held in the building during the present
year, there were present 10,541 men. Com
pare these figures with ISM, when only
3200 attended religious meetings, and we
see the advance made in the strictly reli
gious work.
"In the evening educational classes we
have 163 students enrolled in eleven
branches of practical study. The attrac
tions found in the gymnasium and bath
rooms are found to be potent factors with
the one great object of the work in view.
Cleanliness was not the least of the vir
tues practiced by, the members, for 7020
baths were taken, an average of twenty a
day.
"Our present needs are: First, a more
general moral support from Christian
people. Hundred of Christian men in
Oakland who might sustain a membership
from year to year do not.
"Second, more contributors to the funds
of the general work. Last year only thirty
four persons outside the membership aided
the association financially.
"To meet current obligations the trustees
were compelled to borrow during the year.
This coming year they feel that this
ought not to be done, and they therefore
hope to raise a much larger amount of
â¢ money. The business management of the
association is vested in a board of trustees,
composed of fifteen Christian .business
men, of whom J. Edward Collins is presi
dent, and the affairs of the institution are
conducted on strictly business principles."
THE FIRE PATROL.
Interesting: Figures From the Twenty-
First Annual Report.
The twenty-first annual report of the
Underwriters' Fire Patrol for the year
ending on the last day of last December is
an instructive document for all who are
interested in fire department matters. The
report of Superintendent John F. O.
Comstock shows that the force consists of
a lieutenant, a sergeant, seven privates
and four on the auxiliary force with two
substitutes. During the year the patrol
responded to 458 bell alarms, 36 stills, 32
false alarms, used 15 extinguishers, extin
guished 7 fires, spread 1403 covers and was
in service 409 hours and 49 minutes. The
losses by fire. on buildings amounted -to
$476,344 46, and the insurances on build
ings affected to $3,256,591 97, the losses on
contents $800,736 13, insurance $1,831,
--633 61. :
The insurance paid in building losses
was $363,066 81 and on contents $590,680 71.
The losses on building ana contents not in
sured was $321,057 51.
The report also; gives a list of each fire
and cause and the number of alarms sent
in from each station since 1875. Station
25, corner.Washington and Dupont streets?
takes the lead with 219 alarms, followed by
62, Mission and Fourth, with 116 alarms;
52, Howard and Fremont, 113; and 61,
Howard and Third, 108 alarms.
The only eclipse visible in North Amer
ica in 1896 will occur August 22-23â a par

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Champion Donnelly and T. F. Bonnet
Defeat Champion lliiiLow and J.
O. Nealon.
The rainy weather had the effect of
crowding the handball courts yesterday,
and the spectators witnessed several excit
ing and closely contested games. The
principal event was at the San Francisco
court, where P. T. Donnelly, the amateur
champion, and T. F. Bonnet played against
J. Harlow, the coast champion, and J. C.
Nealon and defeated them. Harlow and
Nealon won the first two games, but the
two invincibles pulled themselves together
and won the next' three, thus keeping up
their unbroken record of victories. The
defeat of Harlow and Nealon, two of the
most scientific players on the coast, places
Donnelly and Bonnet in an invulnerable
position. 7*^7
Another match, which, although not as
scientific as the other.was watched with as
keen an interest, was played between Phil
Ryan and Dan O'Brien and J. Rodgers and
'A. McNeil. Each team had won two
games when in the fifth, while they stood
20 to 19, O'Brien, in attempting to return
an almost impossible ball, fell and dis
located his shoulder, which put an end to
tbe play. . ' .*-_
Besides the usual spectators at the Occi
dental court there was a large delegation
from the Acme and Reliance clubs of Oak
land. The lights had to be turned on for
the final game between M. J. Kilgallon,
the Denver champion, and J. J. Feeney
and Richard Linehan, the over-hand
swioer, and Ed Maloney. Linehan swiped
as he never swiped before and his defeat
was so close that little margin was left for
rejoicing on the part of the winners. A
return match will be played on Wednes
day evening, when Sullivan and McElroy
of the Olympic Club will also play against
John Purcell and Al Hampton.
General J. G. Wall, a great lover and
promoter of amateur sports, has pre
sentea the Occidental Club with $100 to
purchase a gold medal for the best player
in the City. A meeting of the club will be
held during the week, when a single
handed tournament will be arranged.
The fall of rain in the afternoon spoiled
the games at the Union court, which is un
covered. In consequence the match be
tween J. Nelson and Terry McManus and
W. Kelly and J. Roger was postponed till
next Sunday.
Following were the games played in the
courts yesterday :
San Francisco court Ryan and D. O'Brien

THE SAN, FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1896.
PUPILS' LIVES IN DANGER
Menaced by a Concrete Wall Just
Finished at a Public
School.
PLAIN INSTANCE OF JOBBERY.
Deep Ruts in a Newly Asphalted
Playground Planked Over to
Save Children.
The North Cosmopolitan echoolhouse,
on Filbert street, between Taylor and
Jones, was recently remodeled and re
paired. The children who attend the
school are now in dancer of their lives
from the falling of concrete walls or of
serious injury to limb by stumbling into
deep chasms in the newly concreted play
ground. Just three months ago the School
Directors were congratulating themselves
on the clever work they had done in mak
ing a practically new schoolhouse out of
the old building. Last Saturday Miss
Margaret McKenzie, the principal, made
anxious appeal to the Buildings and
Grounds Committee of the board for relief
from the ruin that menaced the pupils.
"The concrete sustaining wall is still
pressing inward upon the yard," she
wrote, "and it is liable to fall" in at any
moment. I have to keep the children
away from it lest the wall might cave in
upon them."
The letter was directed to H. C. Hender
son, chairman of the Buildings and
Grounds Committee, who in discussing
the subject yesterday declared :
"This is about the worst case of jobbery
that has yet come under the notice of the
hoard. The utmost care has to be taken
lest the children attending the school
might be killed or injured by falling walls
that are not three months old.
"The North Cosmopolitan School build
ing was moved back from the street and
two wings were added. New hallways
were put in and the yard in front was
filled about twelve feet. "With the new
arrangement the yard is on the south side
of the buiJding. and this gives the pupils a
chance to play in the sunshine, where it is
dry and pleasant. But the sidewalk is
still a considerable height above the yard
level, say fourteen feet at one end and
about ten fieet at the other end. This ne
cessitated the building of a concrete sus
taining wall for the sidewalk.
. "A contract for the whole work was let
to Thomas Brannan & Son for $14,000.
These contractors sublet contracts for the
sustaining wall and for covering the yard
with bituminous rock. Ransom, Leonard
& Keating built the wall. Hardly had
the boards been removed than the wall be-
pan to crack and bulge in over the yard.
The work was so poorly done we retained
$500 to be used in reconstructing the con
crete wall, but I understand that the con
tractor is going to sue the board for that
money. He will have a hard time get
ting it.
"I am writing a report on this jobbery
to be presented at the next meeting of the
board Wednesday night. I shall recom
mend at that meeting that the board ad
vertise for bids for the reconstruction of
the wall, and also that the present one be
torn down without further delay. An ex
amination of the concrete has revealed the
! fact that there was not one-fifth enough
cement used to make it a good and lasting
job.
''Miss McKenzie, the principal, informed
me yesterday that the wall was still fall
ing, and had pressed inward seven inches ,
or more in the last week. As the wall is >
j about fourteen feet high where weakest it i
j is very dangerous, and the puplis are not
] allowed to go near it at any time. It is
liable to crumble to pieces or fall in upon
the yard.
"The yard itself is another instance of
rascality. It has settled fully two feet in
places and is in a disgraceful condition.
Mr. Kincaid. the inspector of buildings for
the board, made an inspection of it last
week with me, and we came to the conclu
sion that the deep ruts should be planked
t over to prevent children from being hurt
, through falling in. ,
"Even the asohalt-covered playground is
a menace to the children. All over the
bituminous coating is cracked and sunken,
| having followed the imperfect filling, and
I the result is that the yard is a series of
deep puddles and little lakes, through
which the pupils pass with difficulty.
"We notified the Street Superintendent
to stop work on -the sidewalk, which had
been filled to a level with the curb. Had
he finished his part of the work it would
have to be torn up for rebuilding the wall.
The finished portion that had bitumen
laid is in as bad a condition as the school
another evidence of jobbery."

creed to visit upon the head of any mem
ber who succumbs to the darts of Cupid
during the year, and the league has
abated not a jot of its Spartan determina
tion to refuse to allow any oscillatory di
version unless the party .of the second part
has made a showing of business intent by
requesting audience of papa, and taking
measure of the third finger for guidance of
the jeweler.
It was hoped that a compromise might
be arrived at, -whereby the strained rela
lations might be relaxed without a humili
ating recession on either side, but owing
to the signal lack of diplomatic caution no
loophole of retreat was left, and each side
finds itself in the same predicament that
Lord Salisbury -wandered absent-mindedly
into with regard to the Venezuelan ques
tion. There is a mutual spirit of defiance
extant that bodes no good to the wedding
list of 1896.
Recorder St. Sure, being a man of the
law and a merciful Judge, was interviewed
yesterday as to the strained relations fi rst
made public in yesterday's Call.* The
Recorder was perfectly unperturbed, and
his indifference to the painful osculatory
famine that threatens the Alameda bach
elor was most noticeable. The smile upon
his Napoleonic countenance and the nice
carelessness of the lock upon his brow â
heightening the resemblance to the great
French warriorâ told as plainly as words
would have done that he was "fixed," and
that he was not going to suffer any by the
heartless rule of the league-
Postmaster Stoddard was visibly agi
tated. He was found at El Nido Club
playing billiards, and the subject, sud
denly sprung upon him by the reporter,
caused him to miss an easy carrom. Since
Rev. Mr. Bovard announced from his pul
pit that employes of the Government visit
El Nido and play wicked whist at its
oaken tables, he had not been so agitated.
3lr. Stoddard said the trouble comes upon
.him at a bad time. This is a Presidential
year, and will so absorb a man's energies
that he won't have much time to think
about matrimony. And it is hard on a
fellow to be cut off from social privileges
of such long standing.
Dr. Zeyn was appalled at the result of
the bachelors' organization. He had no
idea that it would j>rovoke such bitter re
prisal, and he is in favor of leaving the
matter to arbitration. He said that war
is a terrible thing, and it is in accordance
with the spirit of the closing years of this
nineteenth century that differences be set
tled by humane processes and not by san
guinary and violent proceedings.
F. A. Young, the popular caterer, was
sorry that affairs had got into such bad
Bhape. He feared the complications
would drive trade to Oakland. "If the
young ladies put us on the list," said Mr.
Young, somewhat defiantly though not
without a quiver of regret; ""if the young
ladies go to such unheard of lengths as to
refuse to . Well, there are others, and
the flower of the town will go grazing in
new pastures. Let them beware!"
P. A. Kearney of the San Francisco Mint
had read in The Call of the action of the
Alameda young ladies. He thought the
ultimatum coming so close upon the de
pression of silver and the low price of
wheat was most unfortunate. The year
promises great things to young men who
are industrious and don't forget the day
on which the primaries are "held, and if
the league put off till next year its depart
ure it would not have come" so hard on the
hoys. As it is, it is worse than a ratio of
20 to h !" , _wHS__P V
A. P. Smiley winked one eve impres
sively when the reporter approached him
with the subject, which was taken to mean
that he knew how to beat any such came
as that.
A. G. Burns said he had heard about the
boycott, but it did not trouble him. His
diplomatic relations with the sex had not
been aistnrbed, and he felt that cooler
judgment would soon prevail.
Lieutenant Simpson was sure that the
military men would receive fair treatment
from the gentler sex of Alameda. If they
did not he had some thoughts of advanc
ing on Petaluma, where the hospitality of
the bachelor maids has become famous
through all the regiments of the guard
who recollect the glorious reception ac
corded the blue coats in the year 1894 at
the encampment.

never could play whist, anyhow. Charles

gave signs of deep and ominous thinking.

well, considering, though they might not
have formed a club with a lot of regula
tions and penalties had they known the
result of it.
THE RULES OF KISSING.
San Francisco Ladies Discuss the
Latest Phase of Leap- Year
Trouble.
Kissing â the kissing of un betrothed
young peopleâ has always bothered the
novelists. It has caused the young offend
ers less mental worry, that is generally
speaking, for sometimes, as in Alameda,
it becomes a vital issue. An investiga
tion yesterday revealed that San Fran
cisco girls have not been considering the
advisability of a boycott on caresses un
approved by parental consent.
The question of the advisability of limit
ing the bestowal of kisses is still an open
one in the City. Some look upon a kiss as
an innocuous though delightful social
pleasantry. To them it is a mere symbol
of friendly regard bestowed upon a person
of the other sex who is not personally dis
pleasing.
At church socials Copenhagen and other
games which carried kissing forfeits with
them were once much in vogue. The kiss
in this instance was looked upon as a
mere innocent seasoning to the fun. It
was the result of fraternal confidence, and
was smiled upon with approval by the
elders, who even joined in the games.
Others look upon a kiss as a bait of the
devil. The kisser is considered one of the
unregeneratc, while the kissee, if not an
unwilling victim, is considered quite as
bad. Then, another class of people con
sider kissing as "bad form," and there
fore worse than wrong.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper was not willing,
when interviewed yesterday, to say tha
kisses between unbetrothed young people
are pure and good.
She was rather doubtful, at first, as to
her ability to cope with the subject. She
said she was not in touch with the kissing
habits of the people of to-day and had not
discussed the matter. She was interested,
though, and finally answered by quoting:
Out of the heart Â»re the iisues of life.
"That covers the whole matter, it seems
tome," she added. "If our hearts are
pure, our actsâ any of our actsâ can only
be pure. Like other perfunctory perform
ances, kissine may be inspired by imnure
motives and then it would be bad.
"And so I think the kissine of people
who are not engaged is ill-advised. The
formation of compacts will not lessen its
prevalence, though. I don't know of any
organization to effect that end in San
Francisco, and I think that if there were
one it would fail of its end, for reforms are
not effected by organization but by a
change of motives."
Mrs. M. 11. Hecht thinks promiscuous
kissine is outrageous.
"It is not that anything bad may be in
tended," she said. "The girl may mean
no wrong and be perfectly innocent in p_r
mittine the caress, but it" takes two to per
form the operation and the girl does not
know what the motive of the young man
maybe. Then, too, it indicates a famili
arity that is not respectful. There is no
need of it, and I am sure a girl of good
breedine would never for a moment dream
of allowing a caress from a man who was
merely a friend."'
Mrs. Monroe Salisbury did not know of
any combination in San* Francisco such as
the Alameda young ladies had formed.
As to the propriety of a girl allowing her
self to be caressed by others than her
fiance she would not talk, since she deemed
that it was a matter that was settled once
and all by a proper sense of delicacy.
The Alameda girls had only decided on a
rule that all young women should follow.
Blanche Bates, the young lady who has
so much love-making to do in the Fraw
ley Company at the Columbia Theater,
was intensely interested in the organiza
tion of the young women of Alameda.
She protested laughingly that she would
never have joined.
"Why," she said, ."they practically ad
mit by their protest that they have before
this allowed young men to kiss them.
Think how dreadful! And then, too, I
think they are very unrlatteringlv honest
when they imply, as they do, that the
pleasures of the previous kissing had all
been on the young men's side."
Miss Bates said that she always "set her
face against kissing," that she considered
it highly dangerous because of those
"dreadful germs and things." Then
growing serious, she added:
"It is a more important matter than
most girls think. I know there are girls
who allow men to kiss them and who kiss
the men merely as a sort of way of being
entertaining. The girls who do this must
have moments when they loathe them
selves for it. And sometimes when they
meet the man whose kisses they will
really value, the very memory of those
other caresses will fill them with disgust.
â¢ "Danger also lies in those seemingly in
nocent kissing games of the younger set,
I think.
"Why? Because when the girl grows
older and a young man tries to kiss her,
she will think: 'What harm is it?' and
submit. They are kisses that might be
called property kisses at first. There is
danger of their becoming intensely real."
Laura Millard, the Tivoli's prima donna,
was not inclined to take the action of the
Alameda girls seriously. It was evident
that the very thought of their action
seemed preposterous to her.
"Come." she said, "I'll be willing to
wager that that organization of the girls
goes to pieces before a month. Why. if
they were to be fined for being kissed, and
if they told the [ truth, you'd see that all
their pocket money wens into the treas
ury.
"Kissing wrong? Why, of course not. I
think it's very nice. That is," she added,
"if he's good-looking and one really cares
for him. Why, what harm can there be
in kissing?" '/Ayy-
The disagreeable smell produced by cab
bage in the process of cooking may be got
rid of if a piece of 'bread-crumb, tied in a
fine white rag, is placed in the saucepan
with the water. After this has been in the
saucepan for a quarter of an hour it should
be taken out and thrown into the fire.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL r MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1896.
LIGHTNING STRIKES
AT HAYWARDS.

Destroyed.
A SHARP, AWFUL CRASH.
Every House in the Town Was

Earthquake,

Fragments of the Machine Hurled in
Every Directionâ The Electrician's
Narrow Escape.
Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 26. )
Lightning struck and completely de
stroyed the powerful electric plant of the
Haywards Electric Light Company this
evening.
The storm was at its height about 4
o'clock, and the rain was so dense that
everybody was forced to light the lamps at
their houses, or to turn on electric lights
where electricity was used.
A few minutes aftet 4 o'clock there was a
clap of thunder that shook every house in
town. Accompanying it was a vivid flash
of lightning and a crash that nothing can
describe.
To add to the feeling of awe that the
darkness, the . thunder and lightning
created, all the electric lights suddenly
went out.
The storm-center passed directly over
the town, and while the tempest was at its
height it was the fiercest ever seen in Hay
wards.
F. B. Hooson, whose store is next to the
telephone office, says that the rain seemed
to fall in a solid mass, and before the
sewers could carry it off many houses were
flooded. As the town has just put down a
very complete sewer system the precipita
tion must have been very great.
"The thunder was something awful,"
said Mr. Hooson to a Call man to-night.
"Nothing like it was ever heard here be
fore. It shook the town as if there wa3 an
earthquake, and many people ran into the

streets in spite of the rain. The lightning
seemed to illuminate the whole place.
"It was a succession of crashing flames
that made it appear dark as night as soon
as they had passed. As soon as the light
ning was over the electric lights went out,
and we rightly guessed that something
was wrong at the works."
How the dynamo was wrecked and how
the electric fluid was conducted to it will
never be known, for the lightning did its
work too quickly for any one to watch it.
Edward McKinney, the fireman, was in
the engine-room and when the lightning
flashed he heard a loud noise in the power
room and at the same instant he was in
darkness. He went into the dynamo
room and found that the working parts of
the machinery had been thrown from the
machine and were lying around the floor.
The body of the machine was completely
wrecked. The coils of wire that form part
of the machine were enveloped in blue
flames, which soon died out, and then it
was seen that the lightning had, somehow
orother, been conducted into the dynamo;
the artificial : and the natural lightning
met and the machine was completely
wrecked and blown to pieces.
Joseph Putnam, the electrician who was
on duty at the time, was not in the
dynamo-room when the crash came, and
to that absence he probably owes his i life.
The dynamo weighs several hundred
pounds, and the fragments were hurled all
over the place. The places where they
struck show how forcible must have been
their momentum, and had one struck Put
nam he would undoubtedly have been
killed. 7^777*7*7
Haywards is in darkness to-night, as the
streets and nearly all the stores and hotels
depended upon the electric lights for their
illumination. Several' days must elapse
before a new dynamo can be placed in posi
tion.
â¢In this city â  the sudden storm of this
afternoon proved very disastrous to the
territory between Twenty-seoond and
Twenty-seventh streets and Grove . street
ana Telegraph avenue. A large portion of
this district was covered with : three feet of
water and was utterly impassable. The
street department was busy to-night.
Dozens ol ; people, at whose; homes the
basements were full and ' lower â¢ floors
flooded; sought to obtain some relief.
As the sewers.in that part of town are
small and many were choked, no help
could be given and. the unfortunate peo
ple can only wait till the water works its
way to the bay. The Grove-street cars
were cut down to hourly trips and the
Eighth-street system was cut off altogether
for a time. A little over - one inch of rain
fell in an hour. . * â¢'
DDERANT SEEMS ANXIOUS.
The Convicted Murderer Now Kefusesjto
Talk to Reporters. ;
Durrant, the convicted and condemned
murderer of Blanche Lamont. is morose
and out of humor with himself and
every one wno comes in contact with him.
A week or ten days ago he had a bilious
attack, amd though he has entirely recov
ered physically, his keepers notice a de
cided change in his . manner. Whether it
be due to recent illness or the close con
finement of nine months, or both, none
seem willing to say, but all admit that he
has grown sullen within the past two
weeks. .7' --- 'â  '7 7 ', ... .-, "_".-."'-
A Call reporter visited the County Jail
yesterday. .Repeated knocking at the
wicket of his cell failed to elicit any
response. Finally a prisoner across the
aisle suggested that the visitor pull the
wicket down. -77
This advice was followed, and Durrant
was observed sitting at a table apparently
absorbed in a novel. It was not until the
reporter ventured to make an inquiry con
cerning his health that the - condemned
murderer deigned to raise his eyes from
the book he was so intently reading.
"How are you, Mr. Durrant?" said the
visitor. zA.7'P/z>
"I am very well," was the reply.
"You have been sicic for several days,
have you not?"
"Yes, but I am all right now, and I
don't care to be disturbed."
"Would you mind coming to the wicket
for a moment?"
The unexpected response was a sugges
tion that the inquirer depart for a region
where Truckee's ice carnival wouldn't last
a minute, and Durrant followed this oy
dropping his eyes again on the book he
was reading when interrupted. A few
more questions were addressed him, but to
all purposes he was oblivious to the ex
istence of any one save himself and the
characters in the novel.
Durrant's change of attitude is attributed
to the uncertainty hanging over February
11, at which time his attorneys will move
for a new trial.
DESERTED HIS FAMILY.
Henry Bolenhagen Disappears
With His Little Son and
His Money.
The Man Is Believed to Have Gone
to Germany, Intending to
Never Return.
Henry Bolenhagen of 9 Yerba Buena
street left his home a week ago last Satur
day and has succeeded so well in covering
up his tracks that not the slightest trace
can be obtained of him. He took with
him his son Herman, a child about 7 years
old, ostensibly for the purpose of going to
l'etaluma, where he had spoken of going
into business, but he has not been seen or
heard of at that place. :':'_â¢_
Mrs. Bolenhagen, who has been left be
hind with two daughters, has made in
quiries at the various railroad and steam
ship offices, but failed to gain any tidings
of her recreant husband. The man had
between $2000 and $3000 at the German
Savings Bank, and this sum he is sup
posed to have drawn, and his wife fears he
has carried out a frequently made threat
of returning to Germany.
Mrs. Bolenhagen is quite prostrated with
grief, not only at the sudden disappear
ance of her husband, but also at tho loss
of her boy. â ;";â¢?Â£.
Bolenhagen was employed as bartender
Bolenhagcn's Son Herman, Whom He '
Took Away to Germany.
* [From a photograph.]
at the saloon of Wheeland *fe Collins, on
Montgomery street, where he had been
for years. He was regarded as a reliable
and steady man. But in his domestic
affairs he was extremely irritable. .
He had made frequent threats to com
mit suicide, as he said he could not get
things to go his way. Mrs. Bolenhagen,
who has always been industrious, feels
that it is peculiarly hard, after working
while in business on their own account to
make the money that her 'husband has
taken, to be left entirely. unprovided for.
Bolenhagen had always a strong affec
tion for his son, Herman, but did not pay
much attention. to his daughters.
* ON INTERVIEWING.
Some Timely Suggestions for a Public
Man. .
If it is worth the while of a public man
to grant an interview at all, it is certainly
worth his while that it should be done well,
and it can only be done well if he conde
scends to step down from his pedestal,
and co-operate almost en-collegue with the
interviewer. ;In the first place, the inter
viewer, who has had a large experience in
his craft, is a specialist. He is more likely
than the interviewee to understand the
conditions which go to the construction of
a successful interview, and therefore he
should be allowed a tolerably free hand, as
regards from the arrangement. Personally,
of course I always take stock as rapidly as
can of the interviewee and consult his
humor in everything. After all, he is the
person most intimately concerned with
the success of the joint production, as it is
his name with which the public is con
cerned and not that' of the interviewer,
who is almost invariably anonymous.
I am always in his debt for the conces
sion of the interview, and, if he wishes it,
he must be largely master of its manner,
l am only suggesting that the wisest plan,
after the original ; act of gracious conde
scension has been committed, is to forget,
for the brief hour of the interview, that
you are a Jupiter, and the other man a
black beetle. -Don't; imagine that he is
necessarily unconversant with affairs," po
litical or literary. Why, a . rising politi
cian actually explained to me how a most
elementary word should be spelled. 1 Quite

YACHTSMEN ON A WHEEL
Prominent Corinthian Club Men
Caught in the Popular
Craze.
NEW ORGANIZATION FORMED.
Known as the Calamity Cycling Club.
The Members Will Arrange
Many Country Tours.
The bicycle fad is scorchingly hot,
â  All classes its influence feel ; '
Now the -man at the wheel" is abjuring his yacht
To appear as the "man on the wheel."
The cycling craze has taken possession
of men and women in all stages of life and
society. It has steadily drawn recruits
from other sports, until to-day it ranks as
the greatest outdoor sport of the time, and
has more devotees actually engaged in the
pastime than any other sport ever Known.
While the large body of wheelmen do
not belong to clubs or the .League .of
American Wheelmen, and are therefore
designated by the term "unattached," still
the tendency has been for .a . few jolly
spirits to get together now and then, or
ganize a club among themselves and admit
their friends to membership, and in this
way some of the largest clubs on the coast
have grown to prominence.
: The latest addition to cycling clubdom
promises to be at least a novelty in its
way, and the names of the charter mem
bers and some of the rules and regulations
they have adopted lead to the impression
that the club will be a startling success if
its aims are all carried out.
The by-laws indicate that its name shall
be "Calamity Cycling Club," the objects
being to promote cycling and brewery in
terests. â¢ The officers are to be a chairman,
secretary - treasurer, captain, lieutenant
and repairer. The dues will .be 50 cents
per month, and the membership shall be
limited to twenty-five. The dues for each
month, after expenses for stationery and
postage are deducted, shall be expended
for. solid and liquid refreshments for the
members present on the runs during that
month, of which there are to be two
monthly.
Careful inquiry has elicited the fact that
all the members of the Calamity. Club are
yachtsmen and members of the Corinthian
Yacht Club. This may account for a pe
culiar provision in the by-laws, which
reads: â â-'--.-â 
Any clothes worn at Corinthian Yacht Club
low-jinks are permissible on club runs, bar
ring, of course, the Chapman larabie and the
McLaren dog-skin coat. 7.7/';
To-day was the date for the first run or
cruise awheel, and it was decided to go to
San Jose. The rain has resulted in a post
ponement of the trip one week, however.
The postal notice stated that members
would not be required to ride as fast as
the captain or secretary, as there would
be a separate division to accommodate
every slow rider. No 1897 wheels will be
allowed on club runs.
The officers for 1896, by mutual consent,
will be: M. A. Newhall, chairman; E. A.
Kolb, secretary-treasurer; F. E. Baker,
captain; C. R. McKee, first lieutenant; F.
W. Merrill, repairer.
There are now over a dozen names on
the roll and the full membership of
twenty-five will doubtless be attained be
fore the next meeting. Some of the pres
ent and prospective members, all of them
Corinthian yachtsmen, are mentioned: J.
L. Hawks, Walter Crowell, Oscar Elling
house, J. A. Denhard, Sanford Plummer,
Fred Russ Cook, Pete Sloane, Dave Mc-
Laughlin, Edward and Hugo Neil, Will
Toepke, Robert Tittle and many others.
DANIEL BAUGH IS HERE.
Philadelphia's Art Club Presi
dent Tells of the East
ern Work.
He Offers Some Suggestions That Might
Interest the Local Art
Association.
Daniel Baugh, president of the Phila
delphia Art Club, arrived here yesterday
on his way to Japan. He is accompanied
by Mrs. Baugh. Mr. Baugh is well known
in the East as a patron of art and artists.
He has been president of the Philadelphia
Art Club for- three years and has done
much to increase the interest in art in that
city. He has, offered a number of prizes
to artists in. Philadelphia and has had
much to do with the management of local
art galleries. Mr. Baugh has a splendid
residence on . Locust avenue and recently
entertained there Benjamin Constant, the
great French artist who painted "The
Captive," the picture which Mr. Searles
has just presented to the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art.
The Art Club has done much for art in
Philadelphia on account of the lines upon
which, and the purposes for which, it was
formed. v . Speaking of this yesterday at
the Palace Mr. Baugh said: *
"The Art Club was formed eight or nine
years ago .for the purpose of fostering a
taste for art in the! city. jj Its membership
includes some 800 people who are not
artists and about 100 artists. Of course a
great many, when asked to join, particu
larly those who really cared little for or
knew little about art and were willing to
join for social purposes, predicted that the
club would soon become simply social in
its character. But that has not been the
case. All the members have acquired a
taste for art and take a lively interest in it.
The club has an art gallery *in which are
given three exhibitions a 7 yearâ one of
water colors, one of oil and sculpture and
the third of architecture. Then artist
members are allowed , to hang their pic
tures in the gallery under certain restric
tions at any time.
"The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
Arts has been in existence for fifty years,
has given annual exhibitions, and has
done a great deal for art. ; but Philadel
phians are conservative, and probably their
Quaker proclivities made ? them look with
considerable indifference on art. Since the
starting of the Art Club" a great deal more
interest has been taken in the exhibitions,
and as a consequence they have much im
proved. v ''. .â  "
"Of course, I don't want you to under
stand that the , object of * the club is Â«to
patronize artists and help them to get a
start, but to help, art by instilling in the
people a knowledge of it and a taste for it."
