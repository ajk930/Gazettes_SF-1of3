I! WASHINGTON, â¢ Lâ Senator
Clrllom," a member of the Committee on
Foreign' Relations, was seen by a Call
correspondent to-nigirt concerning the
proposition of Denmark to sell St. Thomas
. Island to the United fs.aj.es. Cullorh had
:'-';ju"st been investigating this abject, and
; : was reading an account of former nego
.â ; tiations with Dehhiark. He said:

harmony in ideals inherent in both
countries, Denmark showed from the
beginning a marked sympathy with
the National cause of the * United
btates. Without infringing the regula
tions of neutrality which applied to her
possessions in the Antilles, she afforded
every possible advantage to the United
States navy in permitting access to the
coaling and supply station at St. Thomas
when it had been refused at Madehia and
the Azories, and without which assistance
we could scarcely n?.ve kept curcruisers in

The San Francisco Call.
emancipator, put an end to the original
movement with reference to St. Thomas
Island. Mr. Reward says:
"The unprotected condition of the At
lantic Coast line of the United States was
never fully comprehended until exposed
by the experiences of war.
"The sovereignty of the islands in the
Caribbean Sea, comprising the West
Indies, is divided among all the naval
powers, the United States alone having no
foothold there. Convinced of the actual
necessity of securing for this Government
a fortified naval supply station in the Ca
ribbean, President Lincoln and Secretary
Seward summoned Vice-Admiral Porter
for consultation in regard to the matter.''
Procuring the necessary charts and de
scriptions of the region, and laying them
before the President, Admiral Porter made
the following strong representations:
St. Thomas lies right in the track of all
sea-going vessels from Europe, Brazil, the
Ettsi Indies and the Pacific* Ocean bound
to the West Indian Islands or to the
United State?. It is the point where all
vessel.- touch for supplies, when needed,
coming from any of the above stations.
It is a central point from which any or all
of the West Indian Islands can be assailed,
while it is impervious to attack from land
ing parties and can he fortified to any ex
tent. The bay on which lies the town of
St. Thomas is almost circular, the en
trance being by a neck guarded by two
heavy forts which can be so strengthened
and protected that no foreign power can
ever hope to take it. St. Thomas is a small
Gibraltar of itself and could not be at
tacked by a naval lorce. There would be
â -sibility of landing troops there, as
the islands are surrounded by reefs and
breaicers and every point near which a
vessel or boat could approach is a natural
fortification and only requires guns with
little labor expended on fortitied works.
There is no harbor in the West Indies bet
ter fitted tnan St. Thomas for a naval sta
tion. Its harbor and that of St. John, and
the harbor formed by the Water Island,
would contain all the vessels of the largest
navy in the world, where they would be
protected at all times from bad weather
and be secure against an enemy. In line,
St. Thomas is the keystone to the arch of
the West Indies. It commands them all.
It is of more importance to us than to any
other nation."
These facts, averred Mr. Seward, ac
cepted in connection with the injuries and
embarrassments suffered by our navy and
commerce, left no doubt in the minds of
President Lincoln's hdministratiou of the
importance to the United States of t'ae ac
quisition of these islands. The question
W8Â« frequently discussed with the Danish
Minister, and in January. ISii,"), both Presi
dent Lincoln and Secretary Seward caused
the desire of this Government to purchase
the provinces in the West Indies to be
made known to Denmark.
The prevailing sentiment at Washington
was favorable, and the scheme was favored
by the Peasants* party, or Liberals, of
Pen mark, but a Conservative Ministry
was in power and it opposed the partition
of the provinces. Again the proposition
was offensive to Germany, and in different
degrees to England, France and Si.-u -i.
and when these facts were discovered the
scheme became less and less popular, as
Denmark had not yet settled the Schles
wig-Holstein imbroglio with Germany and
was in no position to hazard further issues
with her great natural foe, nor to make
other enemies.
The project was completely lost sight of,
said Mr. Seward, in the quick succession
of overwhelming events that make the
year 1565 the most momentous in Ameri
can Listory.
In the midwinter bt lÂ»fe 86 Secretary
Seward .went to the West Indies for his
health, and while there, at the request of
President Johnson, made personal observa
tions with a view to a purchase there by
this Government. The Secretary's precon
ceived opinions in regard to the Danish
Antilles were confirmed, and negotiations
were for a second time opened with Den
mark. In July, I*HH, this Government of-
fered Denmark $5,000,000 for the islands of
St. Thomas, St. John and Santa Cruz.
The Liberals had just obtained control
in Denmark, but the new Ministry was so
deeply absorbed with domestic interests
that no response was made to the second
and formal advances toward the purchase
of the islands.
Ten months after the second proposition
was received the Danish Prime Minister
informed our National representative at
Copenhagen that his Government declined
the 15,000,000 offer, but would cede ail the
provinces to the United States for $15,000,
--000. The United Slates made a second
offer, this timo of $7,600,000, which was de-
L, ami again amended by this coun
try to an offer of $7,500,000 for the islands
of St. ThOmaa and St. John, leaving out
Santa Cruz, an agricultural island, and not
desirable as a post. The United States
agreed to a stipulation that the consent, by
vote of the islands should be the sine qua
non of the transaction.
The AiasKan treaty with Russia seemed
to pave the way to the success of the St.
Thomas negotiations. Russia assured
Denmark of her moral support in the
premises, and on October 24, 18(J7, the
Danish King consented to a solemn treaty
for the trausfer of the West Indian Islands
to the United States, ratification to be con
tingent on a favorable vote of the West In
dian subjects.
It was now that the breach between the
President and Congress occurred, and dur
ing the turmoil in Washington the St.
1 homas matter was cast aside.
Nerertheless the Danish Commissioner
Led with the vote at St. Thomas,
and on January 9, 1SÂ«8, the ballot cast was
declan 1 unanimously in favor of the
United States. The" Stars and Stripes
floated everywhere over St. Thomas, and
Hail Colombia became as familiar as the
Danish national hymn.
The news of the vote reached Copen
hagen, was ratified by the Rigsdag with
out debate and signed by the Kint,', Janu
ary 31, 1868.
Meantime the political storm raged at
Washington; the Johnson impeachment
trial crowded out all treaty matters and
the limit of time for the exchange of rati
fication of the Danish treaty expired.
When the political storm aoated the time
of ratification was extended, at the request
<>f the United States, to October 14, 18fi8.
Foreign influence was exerted in Denmark
and in this country to kill the treaty. The
date of ratification was again postponed to
April 14, 1870. Public opinion was "not
awake to the question nor 'conscious of the
injustice involved." The treaty itself was
smothered in committee, never having
brought before the Senate. The time
of ratification expired, the matter was ex
hausted and thus dropped the great
scheme, until now it bids fair to be
taken up again.

LONDON, Eng., Jan. l.âRight Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, has issued an official state
ment that he is now in communication
with President Kruger of the South Afri
can Republic, in an endeavor to avert seri
ous consequences of the unauthorized and
altogether unjustifiable act of Dr. Jame

Africa Company, in leading a force of from
500 to 70*3 men into the Transvaal to assist
the Uitlanders in their contention against
the South African Republic.
Governor Robinson of Cape Colony has

the act of Dr. Jameson, and has caused to

Cape Colony, in connection with this re

authority.
Dr. Jameson wrote a letter to the com

FIVE MEN SELECTED
Members of the Venezuelan
Commission Named by
Cleveland.
WILL SEARCH FOR DATA.
Brewer, Alvey, White, Coudert
and Gilman Form the
Body.
DEMONSTRATION AT PANAMA.
Wild Enthusiasm of the Populace Over
the Attitude of the United
States.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. I.â The
President to-day announced the composi
tion of the Venezuelan Commission, which
will consist of five members as follows:
David J. Brewer of Kansas, Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court of the United
.States; Richard H. Alvey of Maryland,
Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals of
the District of Columbia; Andrew D. White
of New York, Frederick R. Coudert of New
York, Daniel C. Gilman of Maryland,
president of the Johns Hopkins University.
Judge Richard Henry Alvey is a native
of Maryland. He was on the Judiciary
Committee of the Constitutional Con
vention of 1867, and was elected Chief
Judge of the Fourth Circuit under the new
constitution, and was re-elected in 1882.
He was designated by Governor Hamilton
as Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals of
Maryland, to succeed Judge Bartol. This
place he resigned to Â»ccept the office of
Chief Justice of the Federal Court of
Appeals in the District of Columbia â a
court just created by act of Congress, and
President Cleveland strongly urged Judge
Alvey to take the place of Chief Judge
and organize the new court.
Upon the death of Chief Justice Waite,
durine Mr. Cleveland's first term, some of
the Justices of the Supreme Court
who had been impressed with the opinions
delivered by Judge Alvey of tiie Appellate
bench of Maryland urged the President to
appoint him Chief Justice of the United
States. This the President wtÂ»s disposed
to do. but, it is said, he was deterred by
tire fact that Judge Alvey was a Southern
man, and it was feared that for that posi
tion tp go to the South might create ani
mosity.
Judge Brewer was born in Smyrna, Asia
Minor, in 1837, his father at that time be
ing one of the American missionaries in
that part of the world. He is a graduate
of Yale and a nephew of David Dudley
Field, in whose office in New York Judge
Brewer was a law student. In the year
1858 Judge Brewer removed from New York
City to the West, where he encaged in the
practice of his profession in Kansas City,
Mo., and afterward in Leavenworth, Kans.
He has also occupied various important
positions, including those of Judge of the
First Judicial Court of the State of Kansas,
and from 1870 until 1881 filled ibe office ol
Judge of the Kansas Supreme Court.
Judge Brewer has also taken great interest
in educational affairs and was at one time
president of the Kansas Board of Educa
tion. He was appointed Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court by
ex-President Harrison in 1889.
Daniei Colt Gilman is distinguished as
an educator. He is a graduate of Yale
College and has been an extensive traveler
in Europe, where he gave great attention
to the social, political and educational
condition of various countries. In 1875 he
was elected the first president of Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore.
Among the many works that he has
written is a memoir of James Monroe,
which was prepared for the American
Statesman. His fame as a scientist and
historian is worldwide. Mr. Gilmau is
said not to be affiliated with any political
party, but his tendencies are inclined to
the Republican organization. He is a na
tive of Connecticut and in his sixty-fifth
year.
Andrew Dickson White of New York is
also distinguished as an educator. He is a
native of New York, having been born at
Homer, in that State, in November, 1832.
He is of New England parentage and also
a graduate of Yale. He was president of
the State convention of New York in Octo
ber, 1S(>1, and was United States Minister
to Germany from 1870 to 1881. Mr. White
was also one of the United States Commis
sioners to Santo Domingo, and aided in
preparing the report of that commission.
President Cleveland has not yet notified
the appointees to the Venezuelan Com
mission of their selection, but he has their
assurances that they would accept the
high office if tendered to them. It is further
jSaid that because Justice Brewer's name
appears first on the official list given out
to-night it does not necessarily mean that
the gentleman will be chairman of the
crnmis^on. The selection of presiding
officer will be left to the commission itself
wnen an organization is effected.
It is the President's intention to have
the commission meet as soon as possible,
but information received to-night is that
he has not yet decided when to call the
primary meeting.
Frederick R. Coudert is the head of the
law tirm of Coudert Brothers of New York
City. He has a world-wide reputation as
an advocate and an authority on inter
national law. He served with distinction
on the Bering Sea Committee, and was
complimented by the President of the
French republic for his speech before the
commission, and was entertained at the
palace.
Mr. Coudert was president of the Man
hattan Club for several years and is now a
member of nearly a dozen prominent New
York clubs. He is a Democrat and is
classed as anti-Tammany. . ..
PATRIOTIC COLOMBIANS.
Demonstration in Honor of Fresidcnt
Cleveland's Jlemage.
PANAMA, Colombia, Dec. 25.â The Star
and Herald says: On Monday night, De
cember 24, Panama witnessed a public
demonstration the like ot which has never
occurred in its history before. The demon
stration, as already announced, was or
ganized for the sole purpose of giving
expression of approval of the firm stand
which President Cleveland has taken in
the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute.
From an early hour people began to as
semble in the Santa Ana Plaza, the start
ing point of the procession, and at 8 o'clock
p. m. there had congregated fully 4000 per
sons. The procession was headed by a
cavalcade of about iifty, each rider bearing
a iiag representing the different republics
of America. Two bands of music came
after, followed by the tire brigade with
torchlights. There were also two or three
illuminated transparencies, with mottoes
such as these: "Pueblo de Panama";
"James Monroe, America para los Ameri
canos" ; "Viva Venezuela, Conia Cubana al
Presidente Cleveland"; "Viva la Ame
rique"; "Grover Cleveland."
On the arrival of the procession at the
United States consulate the band played
"Yankee Doodle," at the close of which
the stars and stripes were raised and
dipped three times amid ringing cheers
from the assembled multitude, and sim
ultaneously the band struck up the Co
lombian national anthem. This over.'all
eyes were turned to the balccny of the
American consulate, where several gentle
men had assembled in response to the
Consul-General's invitation. As soon as
Dr. Pablo arose and stepped forward a
loud cheer was given and this gentleman
began his speech, in the course of which
not. the slightest reference was made to
England.
Victor Vifquain. the Consul-General
of the United States, replied. He thanked
the Colombians for [their appreciation of
President Cleveland's message and con
gratulated them upon the grand and fit
ting demonstration, which he character
ized as patriotic. He said tbat he would
like it to be understood that the demon
stration was not hostile to England, nor
was t!ie Monroe doctrine a declaration of
war. The speaker briefly outlined the early
history of the Magna Charta, stating tnat
it was not originally a written law but now
formed the basis of the Nation. He
likened the Monroe doctrine to the Magna
Charta, stating that the Monroe doctrine
was to the United States what the Magna
Charta was to England.
At the close of the demonstration the
Consul entertained about 100 persons at a

WRECKED ON A REEF.
Desperate Battle of the
Elwood's Crew for
Life.
SWEPT BY HIGH SEAS.
Seaman Gastrom Lost While
Attempting to Gain the
Land.
REACHED SHORE ON A RAFT.
Survivors Threatened by Indiana
After They Had Escaped the
Waves.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. I.â The mem
bers of the crew, four of whom, in addition
to Captain Wyman, the master, who pro
ceeded at once to Tacoma to join his wife,
arrived in Seattle to-day on the steamship
City of Topeka, tell' a thrilling story of
their escape from the schooner Elwood,
which was driven during a gaie upon the
reef at Gardners Point at '2 o'clock on the
morning of December 14 (instead of the
12th as first reported) and totally wrecked.
It is one of the most thrilling tales of ship
wreck, and while but a single lifeâ that of
N. P. Gastrom of San Francisco â was lost,
the captain and his crew reached the shore
only after one of the bravest struggles
against the elements recorded in the ma
rine annals of the Northwest.
Arthur Scullin, a Seattle boy, 18 years
old, who had been on the Elwood two
years, gives an intensely interesting nar
rative of the affair. He says a tremendous
gale from the southeast struck the vessel
about a half hour before the disaster. It
was dark, and in spite of anchors and
every exertion of the crew, the Klwood
was driven shoreward and dashed upon
the rocks with territic force, (ircat seas
piled over the disabled craft, and soon
everything movable was swept overboard.
Finding that a big hole had been stova
in the boat, Captain Wyman cut the rope
hawser with the hopes that she would
drift off. This she did and was washed a
hundred yards nearer the shore, striking
a second reef about a quarter of a mile
from the mainland. Another great hola
was made near midship, and it soon tilled.
Seas broke over the Klwood again and
the captain and the crew were kept bnsy
trom this time on in saving their lives.
Captain Wyman, who sought his paper.*..
and valuables, narrowly escaped from
the cabin, the water pouring in upon him
in volumes. Four sailors were washed
across the deck and into the cockpit. The
captain while endeavoring to launch the
boats, which were crushed to pieces, was
swept over the sidei .'reaching the deck
1 again after an almost superhuman struggle.
By this time the Elwood had so far gone
to pieces that the mainmast and foremast
topped over on to the rocks, thus forming
a passage from the deck to the rocks. '1 he
crew scrambled out on to the rocks, but
the tremendous surf beating over them
made it certain death to remain so they
put back to the broken decks of the vessel,
which by this time had broken into two
parts.
Scullin, believing that the wreck would
go down at any moment, left his compan
ions and swam from rock to rock, beinj*
washed off time and again, but. with his
body cut and bleeding, he finally reached
a tree probably fifty yards from shore, and
climbing into its branches sat there until
daylight.
Meanwhile the rest of the crew, save
Gastrom, who bravely volunteered to try
to reach the shore on a raft and was
drowned, remafried on the vessel. At day
break Captain Wyman floated a big piece
of the main deck, and with this as a raft
they made their way to the rocks, whero
they remained until the storm partially
subsided. All the men were practically
naked by this time, their hats, coats f
trousers and other wearing apparel having
been washed from their bodies by the tor*
rilic seas which broke over them.
Reaching the shore the storm-driven and
sea-beaten band wended their way to Mur
der Cove, where was situated a small In
dian village. Here the shipwrecked
men remained for four days, dur
ing which time the Indians held
a pow-wow, deciding to murder the
whole party. The Indians were Kakes,
the most ferocious in Alasicn; but two of
their number â a buck and his squaw â pro
vented the wholesale slaughter of the
whites, and Captain "Wyman and his men
were taken in a canoe and Junded eight days
after the wreck at Killisnoo. The following
day the United States steamship Wolcotl
touched at Killisnoo and took the men
aboard and on to Sitka.
The El wood' was formerly the United
States Coast Geodetic steamer Yukon. Ib
was valued at $.SoOQ aud was uninsured.
Before the crew left the scene of the wreck
there was scarcely a piece of her in sight.
ESCAPE Or A. MURDERER.
Captured the Engine of a Train During
. . , " Ilia Flight for lAfe.
WAY CROSS, Ga., Jan. I.â A^murderer
fleeing from officers captured an engine on
one of the Plant-system trains Saturday
night, and, with pistols drawn, forced the
engineer and fireman to carry him away
from his pursuers. The man was a negro,
and acknowledeed having stabbed a
woman and a man to death at Jasper, Fla.
The trainmen could do nothing until
they met the southbound train. The en

â /.- WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. I.â The
White Houses k roomy, but its capacity
was taxed to the utmost by the crowds
tnat passed in and out of what ; may be
termed the state apartments, namely, the
blue room, where foreign ambassadors and
ministers have their hrst formal inter- ;
â¢views witlv the President,. the red room,
the green room and the spacious east
room, the scene of so many incidents that
have become historical, and lastly the gen
erously proportioned corridor, extending
nearly the entire length of the mansion,
with which all these; apartments com
nr.inicate. :''-.- ;'â¢"'! â  â  : . '."â â -.. ! â  â â ;'â¢ ' ; :.'
A force of decorators under the direction
of Gardener Fister, the veteran superin
tendentof the White House conservatory
and grounds, had -worked hard last night
and early this morning in -making the
mansion look beautiful for the great show
of the year.- The conservatories had been
robbed of : their; choicest possessions, but
not io : Buch an extent: that those whose
observations to their tropical
precincts \yer^. impressed by any sense of
depletion..^/ ; /; ,-. J-V-. .".- *~-
. Wherever, the rye wandered in the blue
room, the corridor," tho east room, or the
other chambers; it was met by groups of
. spreading pa!:ns and tall, drooping rubber
trees, by flowering bushes from the deep
est of poii.settia blooms to the
most delicate.; of ; white rosebuds. The
mantels, the fireplaces, the window em
brasures. were banked with floral beaaty.
The chandeliers were almost hiddefi in
wreaths of green smilax. Ferns waved
delicate branches from nooks and corners,
while stately, and graceful specimens of
the screw. : pine : stood alone in alcoves,
more impressive in . their solitude. . To the
oval ; shaped blue room had been given tie
preference of. blooming;: plains and cut
flowers whose perfume hung heavily on
the air.. The west mantel was a mass of
brilliant color with its profusion of red
roses; i red camellias and. red poinsettias,
standing in marked contrast to the decora
tion of: the east mantel, which was all in
wnite, roses, white camellias and white
hyacinths- From the chandelier was
pendant a large, basket of roses hanging
i above the;- heads of the; receiving party,
\ while, smilax . was entwined with the
jingling crystals and draped in chains
a vi' the doorways, Banked in the man
tels and the of\e great window were palms
a dozen feet in height and poinsettia plants.
The east room, where most of. the guests
assembled after they had paid their re
spects to the President, Mrs. Cleveland
and the other memberi.of the receiving
party, looked like a tropical forest. Palms
ranging in- size from the tallest domestic
variety to th.c diminutive kind so fre*
qucntlv. seen in window gardens were the
principal decoration of the east window,
and these were, surrounded, by ; the red
poinsettiajor Christmas flower, : anid a great
variety of loliage plants. . Jardinieres con
taining" palms,, begonias! primroses and
ferns covered somÂ« of the white gold
mantels, while on; others were 'variegated
pineapple trees. The lireplace and window
had a profusion.: of these varieties, and
the prevailing chandelier decoration of
smilax wreaths â¢ was also noticeable.
Flowering plants were everywhere in the
greenroom, while in each corner was a tall
rubber tree. ", ThJe decoration of the rad
room was much' in keeping with that in
the other apartments, ' except that one
mantel was entirely iirpirik begonias. In
anticipation of a large crowd, and in order
to give it free movementf-a few screw pine
trees and genie plants banked on pedestals
â¢were the only displays in the corridor.
The reception was set for o'clock, and
just at that time, the members of the re
ceiving party, comprising President and
Mrs. Cleveland, Vice-Presidentt Stevenson
and the Cabinet officers ana their wives,
caroe down the private staircase leading to
the corridor, headed by Colonel John M.
â¢ Wilson;. TJ.'S. A., Superintendent of Pub

According to custom, the members of
the diplomatic corps were first received,
and they came in force, headed by their
dean, Sir Julian Pauncefote, that tall and
hearty-looking British Embassador, at
tired in hia court uniform. He shook
hands warmly and exchanged smiles with
the President, as though there had never
been such a thing as "'a Venezuelan note"
or a message to Coneress on the Monroe
doctrine. The occasion of to-day was in
strong contrast to the last previous official
visit of the diplomatic corps to the White
House, in May of the year just ended,
when the body of Walter Q. Gresbam lay
in state in the east room, and the repre
sentatives of foreign governments with
whom he bad to deal personally came to
do honor to his memory. The composition
of the Cabinet had been changed since
then, and two new members â Messrs. Har
mon and Wilson â with their wives, were
having their first experience in the receiv
ing line.
Mrs. Cleveland'? gown was of lavender
and white-striped satin, trimmed with
point lace and high in the neck, as were
all the gowns of the members of the re
ceiving party. It was a matter of particu
lar note that nearly all the members of the
diplomatic body were accompanied by the
ladies of their families, if they had any, or
by the ladies of somebody else's family if
they had not. And it so happened that
one of these women attracted more atten
tion from the spectators than any of the
male members of the foreign contingent,
despite their red and blue, yellow and
white coats and braid and siae arms. She
smiled sweetly on Mrs. Cleveland, then
wt-nt smiling and bowing down the line,
and continued to smile dnnng the progress
to the east room, apparently wholly un
conscious of the interest she created. She
was Mrs. Yang Yu, the wife of the Chinese
Minister, who found herself the cynosure
of all eyes.
Mra. Yang Yu was truly wonderfully at
tired from an American standpoint, and
the most wonderful of all about her attire
was the headdress. It sparkled with gems,
and shimmered in the soft light that came
through the electric globes in the room.
Silk of a most beautiful texture formed the
gown, and Mrs. Yang Yu could certainly
had the satisfaction of knowing that her
dress, if not the envy of all the women at
the reception, attracted the lion's share of
attention and praise.
Following Sir Julian Panncefote came
the secretary of the British embassy, Vis
count Gough, and the other attaches.
Jules Patenotre, the French Embassador,
in his uniform of blue and gold, came with
Measrs. Paul Le Faivre and Maurice Tru
bert, secretaries of the embassy, and other
attaches. Italy was represented by Baron
Fava, the Italian Embassador. Baroness
Fava was with her husband. Baron yon
Thielmann. the German Embassador,
headed the German representation. Senor
Romero, the Mexican Minister, plainly at
tired, followed with Senora Romero on his
arm, a host of young attaches in his wake.
Mavroyeni Bey, the Turkish Minister, and
his secretary of legation, Norighian Ef
fendi, attracted attention less through
their uniforms than through the fact that
they wore the fez. Then followed Pak
Cank Kin, the sole representative of un
happj Korea; Shinichiro Kurino, the
Japanese Minister; L. Hengelmuller
yon Hengervar, the Austro - Hunga
-: ii Minister, followed by Prince Raou|
Wride, counselor of the legation; Yang
Yu, the Chinese Minister; G. de Wrekber
lin, Minister o! the Netherlands; Senor
Rengifo, Charge d'Affaires for the United
States of Colombia; Alfred Le Ghait, the
Belgian Minister; J. A. W. Griap,^Minister
from Sweden and Norway, and Count
Wrangeli ; Senor Mendonca of the Brazil
ian legation ; Alexander de Somow, Charge
d' Affaires for Russia; Senor Lazo Arriaga,
Guatemalan and Honduran Minister;
Senor Gana, Chilean Minister; Senor Jose
Andrade, Venezuelan Envoy, whose ad
miration for President Cleveland and Sec-
retary Oiney is boundless since the mes
sage on the Monroe doctrine was sent to
Congress; J. B. Pioda, Envoy from Switz
erland; Senor Dupuy de Lome, Spain's
diplomatic representative; Constantine
Brun. the Danish Minister; Minister
Frauds M. Hatch of Hawaii; Senor Calvo,
the Costa Rican Charge d' Affaires; Senor
Demonguez, Charge d'Affaires for Argen
tina.
All the diplomatic officers and the ladies
Eccompanyin* them left the White House
shortly before noon, in order to partake of
the annual diplomatic breakfast at Sec
retary Olney's.
Plain, black frock coats and black coats
of other cut succeeded the kaleidoscopic
array of diplomatic attire. The Chief Jus
tice and Ass ociate Justices of the United
States Supreme Court headed the demo
cratic contingent; Chief Justice Fuller, ac
companied by Miss Fuller; the broad
shouldered Justice Harlan; the gigantic
Justice Gray ; the venerable Justice Field,
leaning on the arm of bis wife for sup
port; Justices Brewer, White, Brown and
Shiras; the Justice? of the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Colum
bia, headed by Chief Justice Alvev ; other
District Judges, assistant secretaries in the
Government departments, and a host of
Senators and Representatives, many of
whom had wives and daughters with them.
Among the Congressional contingent were :
Senators Sherman, Lodge, Carter, Morgan,
Burrows, Squire, Bate, Proctor and Shoup;
Representatives Wheeler of Alabama,
Catchings of Mississippi, McClellan of
New i'ork, Northway of Ohio, Pickler of
South Dakota, Lacey of lowa, Herman
of Oregon; Curtis, the New York giant;
Cobb of Alabama and Washington of Ten
nessee. The Interstate Commerce Com
missioners, directors of various public
institutions, the Commissioners of the
District of Columbia, bureau officers of
t!io executive departments, and many
others holding official positions filed by in
endless array.
Then came the army officers, as fine a
looking body of men as were ever seen,
albeit their blue uniforms were not so
gaudy as those of the diplomatic corps.
Ma jor-General Miles headed the line of
his subordinates, making his first official
social appearance as the major-general
commanding the army, gorgeous in yellow
msh and all the appurtenances of the com
manding general's costume.
The army men turned out in full force
chiefs of War Department bureaus, staff
officers, line officers on detailed duty, and
the officers attached to the cavalry and
artillery regiments stationed in and near
Washington. In the army contingent
Adjutant-General Ruggles and a dozen
assistant, adjutant-generals, Judge Advo
cate-General Lieber, Colonel F. C. Ains
worth, Quartermaster-General Batchellor,
Surgeon-General Sternberg; General Craig
blU, the chief of engineers; General Flag
ler, the chief of ordnance, and Paymaster-
General Stanley. A score or more of re
tired generals, colonels and majors closed
the military line.
Then came the nayy â bluff and hearty
old sailors and spruce young lieutenants
and ensignsâ all walking with naval swing.
Commodore Melville, the Arctic hero and
now chief of the steam engineering bu
reau; Commodore Matthews, chief of yards

and docks; Admiral Ramsey, head of the
navigation bureau ; Surgeon-General Try
on, Captain Sampson, chief of ordnance,
and many others bowed past the receiving
party.
A host of the civilian officials followed
the naval officers and then followed the
associated veterans of the War of 1846,
carryme tattered battle flags; members of
the Grand Army or the Republic ; the Loy
al Lesion, tbe Union Veteran Legion and
the Oldest Inhabitants Association of the
District of Columbia.
Between 12:30 and 1 o'clock the public
reception to citizens began. All the morn
ing those w.ho fell within the category had
been assembling outside the White House,
until at the time stated they numbered
many hundred and stretched in a long line
two deep, down the driveway to one of the
main gates and out into Pennsylvania av
enue. Several of the cabinet ladies and a
large number of those behind the line had
left the White House by this time to at
tend receptions of their own, but the Pres
ident and Mrs. Cleveland struck bravely to
their fatiguing task, and had a handshake
and a smile for all who came. At 2 o'clock
the doors were closed and the annual offi
cial reception was over.

REED BUBS ITS PASSAGE
Small Hope for the Success of
the Nicaraguan Canal Bill
This Session.
The Appropriations Committee to Act
in Accordance With the
Speaker's Wish.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 1.-A Call
correspondent talked with Senator Cullora
to-night concerning the prospects for the
passage of the Nicaragua canal bill during
this session of Congress. As chairman of
the Committee on Interstate Commerce
and also as an influential member of the
Commerce Committee, Senator Cullom is
familiar with the canal project and well
qualified to speak on this subject. The
conversation with him tended to confirm
the predictions heretofore made in these
dispatches, that there is bnt little prospect
for favorable action from this Congress.
Senator Cullom said :
"I talked with a member of the House
Committee on Appropriations yesterday,
and understood from him that strict econ
omy would be observed in accordance with
Speaker Reed's wish. Now. I believe in
economy, also, but not in false economy.
I believe that our Government should un
dertake the construction of this canal as
soon as possible, before other nations step
in ahead of us.
"I understand that the Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee of the
House is not favorably disposed toward
this project, but I have no personal knowl
edge of the truth of this report. I can
only say that I am heartily in favor of the
canal, and will do all in my power to help
it along."

Selects a Bride.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Jan. I.â Walter
Sanger, the champion bicycle-rider, is the
hero in a pretty little romance, of which
Miss Dora Kotzenberg of Chicago is the
heroine. Miss Kotzenberg is a relative of
Mra. Cornelius Sanger, at whose house
Walter Sanger met her. The acquaintance
ripened into admiration and then into love.
Miss Kotzenbprg has been on a visit to
Mrs. Sanger for the holidays. Friday
evening a stating party was arranged for
up the river. Walter and his inamorata
took advantage of this to plan a little trip
of their own on the sea of matrimony.
As the party started for the river from
the Sanger residence. Walter and Miss
Kotzenberg dropped behind. They were
followed by Wilfie Sanger and a young
lady friend of Miss Kotzenberg, who had
been let into the secret. Holy Rosary
Church was right on the river. While the
rest of the skaters passed on Sanger and
his little party wont into the church,
where Father McGill was in waiting. In
a few minutes Mr. and Mrs. Walter Sanger
walKed demurely out of the church aud
rejoined their companions, and the even
ing wa3 passed otf as merrily as if there
had been no incident of a private marriage
as a prologue.

New York Republicans Believe the

Party's Choice.
ALBANY*, N. V., Jan. I.â Governor Levi
P. Morton has finally announced to hi 3
friends that he will stand as a candidate
for President before the National Repub
lican Convention to be held in St. Louis.
He stated his position at a dinner given at
Chauncey M. Depew's residence in New
GOVERNOR LEVI P. MORTON OF NEW YORK, WHO HAS ANNOUNCED HIS
CANDIDACY FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL NOMINATION.
[Reproduced from a photograph.]
York City on Monday night. The others
present were Thomas G. Piatt, Benjamin
F. Tracy, Hon. ' War.xr Miller, c tate
Controller James A. Roberts of Buffalo
and ex-United States Senator Frank His
cock of Syracuse. These gentlemen had,
at the dinner tendered Governor Morton
in New York City ten days previous, as
sured him that he could have the solid
delegation from this State and the undi
vided support of the Republicans of the
State without regard to leaders.
The first step in securing him this unani
mous indorsement was the resignation of
State Controller Roberts as president of
the State club, which was organized by
John E. Mulholiand of New York City as
an anti-Platt organization. Mr. Roberts
is preparing a statement, which he will
give out for publication to-morrow after
noon, in which he will indorse Governor
Morton's candidacy and show why, in his
Judgment, Mr. Morton should be nomi
nated. Mr. Platt and other prominent
Republicans will also be interviewed to
night or to-morrow morning and give like
statements to that of Mr, Roberts. These
publications have Governor Morton's con
sent, as he is now satisfied that the Repub
licans of the State are anxious to give him
a hearty and unqualified indorsement.
It is stated that when Governor Morton
acceded to the wishes of the purty leaders
to become a candidate for President, he at
the same time announced that no matter
what the result of his canvas might be he
would not be a candidate for re-election as
Governor when -his term expired on Janu
ary 1, next. If he is unsuccessful, and it
is expected that, he will be by those who
are cognizant of the circumstances which
have led Governor Morton to announce
his candidacy, he would, it is thought, go
to the United States Senate as a successor
of David B. Hill, whose term expires next
year.
The decision of the Governor has led to
much speculation as to who among the
many candidates for Governor is likely to
succeed him. Btate Controller Roberta,
Speaker Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State
Palmer, Adjutant-General McAlpin and
J. Sloat Fassett have time and again been
mentioned as possible candidates, while
there are some who seem to think that
Hon. Warner Miller would profit by the
Governor's declination of a second term,
under the circumstances which have
caused the Governor's announcement of
his candidacy for the Presidency.
ZXJ>OBSBn' BY HOBERIS.
He Says Governor Morton is in the It ace
to inÂ»i.
ALBANY, N. V., Jan. 2.â James A.
Roberts, the State Conptroller, at mid
night gave out the following statement
announcing Governor Morton's candidacy
for the Presidency and his own support
of it:
"The positive knowledge that Governor
Morton is to be a candidate for President
is received with popular favor. It is un
fair for me to assume that Governor Mor
ton would sacrifice any of the distinction
and honor which he has so ably won by
being a stalking horse or a complimentary
vote candidate.
"His candidacy means that he is to win,
and that he will stay in it until the con
test is decided in the St. Louis convention.
His distinguished career in the political
capacity, Mb ability and good judgment,
are the qualities which his friends bank
confidently upon for success. It is a great
thing in a political contest to have a can
didate against whom no one has anything
to say. This is true of Governor Morton,
and in addition the party can point to the
services performed with distinguished
ability in many positions as a guaranty of
what he will do in the higtiest office. I
fully believe he will win."

SHOT BY TUE DOO.
A. Rhode Island Man Serioutly Injured
If/tile liuntiny.
PAWTUCKET, R. L, Jan. I.â Louis
Leizotte was shot by his own dog while
squirrel-hunting in the woods near Reho
both, Mas?., yesterday afternoon. He had
a double-barrel gun with him, and sight
ing a squirrel high up in an oak, Leizotte
let go one barrel, wounding the squirrel.
Standing the gun against the tree, Leizotte
began to climb to secure his quarry.
The dog, which from the time of the
discharge of the gun had been running ex
citedly around the tree. began to jump
against the trunk, as if trying to follow
his master. His paw struck the trigger of
the loaded barrel, sending a charge of shot
up past Leizotte's side and lodging in the
muscles of the right arm near the shoul
der. Leizotte fell, but managed to make
hia way to a doctor in RehoDoth, who got
an ambulance to take the wounded man to
the Rhode Island Hospital. Tnere it was
said that the arm would have to be ampu
tated.
CHEWS Vf TUX CLOTHES.
Destructive Mania of a Lad in Massa-
chuaetts.
f BOSTON, Mass., Jan. I.â Residents of
Roxbury have for two months oomplained
that their clothes, when hung out to dry,
would be torn and slashed into shreds.
Yesterday James Harrington, a newsboy,
was arraigned in the Roxbury municipal
cou:t as the destroyer and was fined $15.
When asked why he did it he said he
could not help it. His mother had spoken
to him about it. "But it's no use," he
said, "I must do it. I used to cut them
but now 1 tear them with my teeth. I can
not stop it."
The sight of garments seems to frenzy
him. He chews the pieces that he tears
out as though they were food. There was
about $300 worth of damaged linen in
court yesterday as the result of the boy's
visits.
CONTINUE THE SLAUGHTER
Armenians Are Put to Death in
Many Portions of
Turkey.
The Government Goes a Step Further
in Stopping the Relief Work
of Missionaries.
LONDON, Eira., Jan. I.â The Constan
tinople representative of the United Prsss
telegraphs under the date of December 31
that United States Minister Terriil has
received telegrams from Aintab, Asia
Minor, saying that elight disturbances had
taken place there in which three persons
were killed.
The telegrams also said that there had
been a bloody outbreak at Orfah, lasting
two days. Miss Corinna Shattuck, a mis
sionary at that place, the dispatches said,
had received the assurance that she should
have a guard and be conveyed in safety to
Aintab.
Telegrams from Harpoot say that the
Government has put a stop to the work of
relieving the needy and suffering at that
place, which has been conducted through
the missionaries.
On December 16th the Armenians in
Zeitoun made a demand upon the Porte
for food with which to feed the Turkish
prisoners on their hands. On December
23d the Sultan issued an order that the
food should be supplied.
During the massacre at Malatia, two
Armenian members of the Governor's
Council rushed into the presence of the
Governor and begged him to save their
lives. The Governor refused to interpose
in their behalf, aad the men were killed
by the guards in the Government building.
The Turkish committee of six which
was to paciiy Armenians have visited
three cities. They refused to pay any at
tention to the written complaints of Ar
menians, but summoned the most promi
nent of the Armenian inhabitants before
them.
The summons was obeyed and the
Armenian notables were blamed for caus
ing all the trouble in Asia Minor and
threatened with death if quiet was not at
once restored. The commission secretly
met the most prominent members of the
Moslem inhabitants before they summoned
the A rmenianb before them.
The apathy of the Washington Govern
ment in regard to the Consulates author
ized to be established by Congress is the
subject of much comment and harsh crit
cisim, the Consulates at Harpoot and Er
zeroum not having been filled.
THE PORTE IS STUBBORN.

LONDON, Eng., Jan. I.â A late dispatch

Constantinople says that the Dragomans
from the Embassies to try the appeal upon
the Government to take action looking to

STRUCK UPON A ROCK
Disaster to the Cunard Line
Steamer Cephalonia
in a Fog.
PASSENGERS IN A PANIC.
They Are Taken in the Lifeboats
From the Stranded Vessel
to the Shore.
WATER FLOODING THE SALOON.
Serious Culmination to a Stormy Trip
of the Ocean Greyhound Across
the Atlantic.
LONDON. Eng., Jan. I.â The C'unard
line steamer Cepbalonia, Captain Sec
combe, from Boston, December 21, for
Liverpool, strucu a rock at South Stack,
near Holyhead, at 7:30 o'clock this morn
ing. Her passengers were at breakfast at
the time, and many of them were thrown
from their seats by the shock. Everybody
rushed upon deck and the wildest excite
ment prevailed. Captain Seccombe suc
ceeded in calming, the panic-stricken pas
sengers and ordered the boats lowered.
When the boats were got into the water
the women were placed in them first and
the men afterward. The boats then put
for shore, the captain ordering their crews
to return to the ship. At 9 o'clock the
vessel, assisted by the rising tide and her
own steam, backed off .the rock, and the
passengers proceeded to Holyhead.
Fifteen of the vessel's passengers had
landed at Queensiown yesterday. She had
a stormy voyage througnout.
The Cephalonia. after being floated, put
in for Holyhead, but was finally beached
at the upper end of New Harbor. Her
afternold is apparently full of water. A
thick fog prevailed at the time she struck
the rock at South Stack. While she was
fast on the rock a lifeboat was sent to her,
but it was not needed.
The Cephalonia is in a position which
does not promise that she can be floated at
the next high tide. The water is now
flooding her saloon. Her bottom is being
examined by divers, Â»he is seriously
damaged in her after parts. The passen
gers of the vessel have been sent to Liver
pool.

The Star and Herald, in referring edi
torially to the message to Congress of
President Cleveland regarding the Vene
zuelan boundary question, says: Presi
dent Cleveland has spoken, the whole
world has heard and now knows that the
Monroe doctrine is not a vain sentiment.
Europe may noc enjoy the theme, but its
mystic influence has found a responsive
cfcord in the hearts of all South Ameri

deputies is now safe, since Great Britain
cannot contemplate any further national
crimes in this hemisphere without meeting
Uncle Sam face to face.
GOrERSOfi MORTOX'3 MESSAGE.
Dtfense of the Monroe Doctrine VrgedL
by the Executive.
ALBANY, N. V., Jan. I.â The Legisla
ture of the State of New York convened at
11 o'clock to-day. Both houses were
promptly organized, the caucus nominees
of the Republicans being chosen. Hamil
ton Fish of Putnam was elected Speaker
of the House. Lieutenant-Governor Sax
ton will preside in the Senate.
After the organization in the Senate,
Ellsworth offered a memorial on the Ven
ezuelan question, which was temporarily
laid on the table for debate. The memo
rial declares in favor of the Monroe doc
trine. In the Assembly O'Grady offered
a similar memorial, which was unani
mously adopted.
The Governor's message was then re
ceived and read in both houses. Upon the
vital Venezuelan incident, Governor Mor
ton said:
"The doctrine formulated by President
Monroe and which has since borne his
name has become so well established in
American National policy that there is no
room for doubt as to the opinion of our
people concerning it. Any disturbance of
the existing friendly relations between the
United States and Great Britain cannot
fail to have a serious effect.
"I cannot believe that the relations be
tween our country and Great Britain will
be ruptured or seriously impaired by the
misunderstanding now existing between
that country and Venezuela concerning
the proper location of the boundary line
of their possessions in South America.
Arbitration affords a simple, humane and
honorable method of determining na
tional disputes, and it is scarcely conceiv
able at this period of the world's history
that any Â«reat nation is willing to. take
the responsibility of the needless sacrifice
of human life and the wanton destruction
of property which would be the inevita
ble result of an armed conflict."
Senator Ellsworth's Venezuelan memo
rial was then Jiaken up, when Senator
Cantor moved to amend so as to approve
of the doctrines and patriotic sentiments
contained in the message of President
Cleveland on the subject. The amend
ment of Mr. Cantor was lostâ l 3 to 36.

it has learned on the highest authority
tnat EarlGranvillein 1885 virtually con
cluded with Blanco a treaty containing an
arbitration' clause covering the Venezuelan
international boundary dispute. The
Marquis of: Salisbury, however, on coming
into power later in the same year, can
celed this clause by limiting the provis
ions of the treaty to commercia] questions.
"Nothing, could have been more unfortu
nate," says the Chronicle, "inasmuch as
the boundary dispute was on the eve of a
permanent settlement."
The Chronicle adds that it is convinced
by careful researches that there is valuable
land both north and south of the Schom
burs line, and that it would be a grave
error to imagine ti.at a rigia insistence on
the Schomberg line and a declaration that
there is no ground for arbitration consti
tute the essence of the English case.
Should Be Sustained.
BOSTON, Mas?., Jan. I.â ln the Senate
this afternoon M. Southard (R.) offered
the following resolution, which was re
ferred to the Committee on Rules:
Resolved, That we believe that the Monroe
doctrine should be firmly sustained by the
United States wherever it is justly applied.

ENDS THE RECEIVERSHIP.
The Santa Fe System Turned
Over to the Reorganized
Company.
Officials and Employes to Continue at
Their Posts Until Further
Notice.
TOPEKA, Kap., Jan Lâ At midnight
the great Santa Fe system was t ran f erred
by the receivers to the new organization,
and the most notable receivership in t'.e
history of the world was practically ended.
The first official notice from the new cor
poration, "The Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Company," received at
the general offices was a circular from
President E. P. Ripley, containing the
simple announcement of the principal
officers, and instructing all officials and
employes to continue in their positions
nntil further notice. General Auditor W.
K. Gillett notified all employes and con
necting lines how to close up the accounts
of the receivership at midnight and open
business this morning with the new com-
pany.
The property turned over to the new
company is in the best condition possible,
as the court directed the receivers to de
vote their strict attention to keeping up
the condition of the system.
Bach's eyes failed completely in his later
years and his last work, "The Art of
Fugue," remains unfinished on that ac
count.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. I.â
Ex-Judge Warren Truitt of the District
Court of Alaska, wLo arrived from the
north oa the Topeka early this morning,
brought full particulars of the brutial mur
der at Sitka of Donald Austin, chief of the
Indian police, on December 21 last. As a
result of the tragedy Judge T. K. De
laney, who succeeds Truitt, has bound
over Herbert Mills, the principal, for mur
der, Chum Long, the proprietor of the
saloon in which the murder was commit
ted, on a charge of manslaughter, and two
sailors from the cutter Wolcott for as
sault.
On the night of the murder a number of
white men and Indiana were drinking in
Long's saloon, when a row started between
Austin and Mills.
Two sailors took a. hand and floored
Austin, and while he wea down Mills
sprang upon him. anil brutally knocked
his head against the hard lloor again and
again*
Unconscious, he was thrown into the
back room of the saloon by Long and left
to die.
The Indians of Siika, among whom
Cnief Austin was very popular, became
ularmed at bis disappearance and began
inquiries. Two day's later Long became
frightened and threw Austin's lifeless
body into the street, where it was found a
few hours later. .
Ad soon as the new 3 spread among them
a genera! Indian uprising was threatviif-.d,
and muttering? became so loud that plans
/or defense were hastily laid by citizens,
assisted by officers of the Wblcott.
For twenty-four hours there was an in-
Creasing- excitement among both the In
dians and whites, the latter being almost
afraid to leave their homes, but the sum
mary action of Judge Delariey gradually
brought about order, though the Indians
declare that nothing less than one life will
atone for the murder of Chief Austin.
The trouble is not ended.

He returned shortly after. 7 o'clock this
evening, making the 200 miles In a. little

MISSING FROM FRESNO
Superintendent Wolcott of the
Sampson Fiat Mine Dis
appears.
His Wife and Child Are Left Pen
niless and in Agonizing
Anxiety.
FRESNO, Cv,, Jan. 1.-C. H. Wolcott, j
for the past six months superintendent of
the Sampson FJat mine in the mountains
about sixty miles east of here, has disap
peared.
A week ago last Saturday he left for San
P'rancisco to sell his one-quarter interest in
the mine which he was superintending.
On Monday he had sold one-half of his in
terest to Mr. Rolf, manager of the Kings
River Lumber Company, for $.~>oo.
He asked Rolf for an immediate advance
on the bargain, but this the latter refused
to do, as he wanted to communicate with
Wolcott's partners in this city before ilus
ing the deal. Wolcott then asked Rolf to !
lend him $20 with which to return home,
as he was entirely without funds. Tins
Rolf did.
Since the time Wolcott left Rolf no
trace of him can be found. His wife and
daughter are in this city and he left them
penniless. They are almost distracted
with anxiety.
It is generally believed that Wolcott has
deserted his family and has gone to seek
Bei4fl anew. No motive for hia departure
is known, only that while here he has
always carried soane weighty matter on
his mind which has not been divulged to
any one, not even to his wife.
Judging from remarks Wolcott made be
fore he left Fresno, it was then his inten
tion to skip out.
Wolcott came to Fresno with his wife
and daughter about two years ago, and at
i;r--t \va?* in the insurance business. He
formerly lived in Montana.

THE SAN FftAK CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 2. 1896.
CITY OF PORTLAND, OREGON.
BY THE SECRETARY OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
Portland is tbe metropolis of the Pacific
Northwest. It is situated on the Wil
lamette River, twelve miles from Its con
fluence with the Columbia, and 110 miles
from the Pacilic Ocean. It has natural ad
vantages as to locality an:d clhuaie which,
combined with the. enterprise of its citi
zens, have effected an eno-mous growth. It
has a population of 90,785 people, showing :
a very rapid increase in t;he last five years,
during- which time capital has been in- i
vested and encouraged, and its manufac- :
turiug products have constantly increased. !
There has recently been constructed a j
deep channel from Portland to the sea, a i
distance of 112 miles. The channel ia \
twenty-five feet deep, and was constructed
at the expense of the citizen* of Portland. I
The deep-sea commerce 6f this port for j
1894: was, foreign and coastwise, abo'-jt . i
$7,600,0Q0, which, of course, is exclusive of j
produce and merchandise shipped from the j
city eastward during the year, which
amounted to about $3,000,000.
The deep-sea commerce for 1895 will show
quite an increase.
For the past six months the experiment
has been tried of running a monthly line I

i and China, and it has -proved. a' success far ..<
I beyond the anticipations of the promoters. !
At the very start the line stepped out of.
j.the experimental stage, and its future Was
AssrireOiv lioth the railroad company and
|. the steamship firm wished to know ex- i
ac.tl-y the condition of the trade before .;
venturing to a heavy extent, and so a six i
months' contract was drawn up. On the
first of December the first contract expired,
and -on the 13th. inst. another was .
; signed; which makes the line permanent.
. The 1 original contract was between the
0, It. aiid X. Co. and Samuel Samuels
â  <fe Co. of Yokohama and London, and was
j to run.il monthly line of steamers be-:
tween this port and I'okohama and Hong
kong.. The contract was entered into June
1 last. The possibilitiesfor such v venture
were limitless, in view of the O. It. and
i N.s Eastern connection with the Great
r Northern-. A similar line, the Upton, had
! been in operation several years before and
. would have built up- a nraenificent trade
had the Union Pacific, which then con
trolled the 0. R. and X., given it the aid it
. should.
Bat the Union Pacific and the Gould in

citic Mail, which operates between Ban
Francisco and the Orient, and the Portland
iine was killed. When the Navigation

Pacific- acd passed into the management
of Mr. McNeill: it was seen that' a trade
might bo opened up between Oregon and
the far East. This was made more evi
dent when the Ore-eon road allied itself
with the Great Northern. Overtures were
made to the Samuels firm, which owns and
operates a large number of steamers in
Asiatic waters,, and F. C. DaVidge, the Vic
toria agent of the firm, came to Portland
and a contract: was drawn up. This was
approved by all parties,, including the
Great Northern, and after satisfactory as
surances of continued patronage had been
made by Inrge shippers on both sides of
the ocean the agreement was signed.
The first steamer of the line, "which was
known as the Oregon Railway and Naviga
tion steamship line, was the'Chittagong, a
Btauuch freight vessel, though of only
medium capacity. She left Hongkong
June 5 and, s-toj.ping at Yokohama, Kobe
and other Japanese ports, came straight
across the Pacific to this city. She reached
Portland. :June 26 and was* given a right
royal reception. Along the river front she
was the principal object of interest, but
what was more satisfactory to the officials
of the company was. the great amount of
freight offered for her return trip. She
brought thti new crop of tea, which was at
once dispatched Eaat in a lengthy bauner
decorated train, and sent flying to Chicaso
end New York on passenger time. Silk,
rice, matting and curios were also In her
inward caigo. Outward bound the Chitta
gong carried a full cargo of flour and did
not have space accommodations for ail
that was offered. . â¢ ; . ; :
The second steamer to arrive was the
Asioun, a much larger vessel than the
Chittagong. She came into port July 261
On her return trip she stopped at Hono
lulu. A good amouut of freight was of
fered for the islands, and ti:ere was. also a
demand for coolie transportation between
Honolulu and Yokohama, which she. could
admirably nil. On August 23 the third
steamer, the Altmore, reached Portland.
The fleet was now complete, but iit
was evident that the vessels were too
small for the rapidly growing trade. The
Chittagong, however, made one more
trip, as the new boat engaged for the
Bervice got worsted in a -Gurnese typhoon
and had to lay up for a while for re
pairs, missingher sailing date. The Qhit
tagong reached here on her: last trip Sep^
terhber 22. The Asioun followed her,
arriving November 8, and; again returning
westward via the Hawaiian isles.
The latest to arrive was the Mount Leba
non, which came into port on the' 2d of
the present month. This: is the steamer
the place of which was filled in September
Iby the Chittagong. Tiie Mount Lebanon
jis a large vessel of the .-^.elouri type. At
â  t ti i-s stase of the .business the corn panv de
cided to introduce an innovation by having
i its steamers call at Honolulu coining ami
gofng. The experiment proved s-ucci-spfi:],
ami hereafter all of the flet't will follow
that route. The Mount Lebanon sailed
! from her dock hero a fe\y days ago carrv
-1 ing about 3000 tons of Hour for Asiatic
ports, and .600 . tons i of freight, including
lumber, hay, feed, 'fruit', vegetables, beer
and other merchandise, for Hawaii. The
third steamer now on the jineâ the Chitta
gong and Altrnore were .retiredâ is the
Rhosina, which. has sailed Iron} Hong
kong and is due here Christmas week. She
i is a first-class vessel of large, cargo cv
; pacity. 'â : ' â¢ .' ;.-. â  :'. - ; ':' â . : i..- ' â¢:. .' â 
Every steamer oiv Ihe route : has beert
, forced to leave more or less freight on the
i dock. The. Mount Lebanon had. to refuse
12130 tons. This is greatly in cbhir&st witb
the business being done bysotoe of the
other trans-PaciHc lines. One of the rea-l
' sons for anxiety in the case. of. ah.oyerdue
; boat of a rival .-company was the. fact that
| she was so high out 6i the Water that: it
; was feared she could not weather tde win
i ter: storms of the Pacific. The Portland
.ships are doing a good business with the
j Sound, and are not depending Entirely on
i the trade of this city. Whenever any
I cargo to go from the Sound is offered^ the
steamers call at Victoria and the freight
is transferred to the upper Sound cities by
means of small steamers.- â '
There are five steamship lines across the
Pacific and ths Portland iineis the young
i est and one of the most prosperous. San
| Francisco has two lines, the Occidental and
! Oriental, Spreckels line, and the Pacific
| Mail, wliich, with Iluntingtoii at. the head,
is practically the same thing as the South
ern Pacific. The steamers of these! two
co-rnpanies run alternately arid, being long
established in the business,, they handle a
great amount of trainc. That the O. R. and
N. Co.'s line has seriously cut into their
flour trailie is ovideirt from the fact that
they recently joined the northern lines
in-cutting rates to run off the Portland
stesimers. Such a move resulted merely
in the home company cutting below the
other lines and carrying off .the cream of
the business. There are two Jines in the
north, the Canadian Pacific and Northern
Pacific. The Canadian steamers sail from
j Vancouver and the Northern V aci.tic from
J Tacoraa. Both lines call at Victoria; and
j nn the Asiatic side all make Yokohama or
Hongkong the terminus. The. Canadian
steamers are fast mi : 1 vessels, adapted
principally to the passenger trade, though
they carry some freight as well. . All the
i other lines carry freight and passengers*
The Portland steamers how in the busi
ness have accommodations, however,- for
only a limited number of guests.
Before the contract of the 0. . R. and N.
and Samuels & Co. expired on Decem
ber 1, Receiver McNeill of the O. R.
and K. had commenced negotiations with
the steamship firm to make the line per
manent, and yesterday the matter was
satisfactorily arranged, and the contract
signed. Messrs, Samuels & Co. agree to run
a monthly lineofsteamersjWitha'minimunv
capacity of 3000 tons each, and provisions
are made for increasing the frequency o.nd
carrying capacity of the steamers as the.
growth.4)f business may justify. The title
of the line is the Oregoo Railway and
Navigation Asiatic Steamship Line, in con
nection with the G -eat Northern Railway..
The results of the six months' contract with.
Samuels ifc Co. have justified the permanent:
establishment of the line. â¢ .: :
Through this medium- we export to the
Oriental countries our flour and niiil
products, our lumber, fruits, vegetables,
meat; and horses.and import teas, curios,
matting, silks, matchwood,, rice, wall
paper.; etc.. â¢ â  . â  : .. :"~v
Probably a number of steamers will he
built specially a4apled for this trade, and
it is quite probable that before long steam
ers will be running oftejier than once a
month. The line will carry passengers' ns
well as freight, and. as business increases
will furnish increased; accommodation to
meet afl demands. . . ...
On. his recent, visit to Portland. Mr. Da
vidge stated that the inerchjants of thiaV
city would 1 see great improvements in; the
service before next summer. : AYhen tSe
new tea crop begins to move if the present
vessels are not large enough to handle the

THE REV CANON S. j. GOOD, THE VETERAN MISSIONARY AND PHILOLO.
GIST, WHO SAYS THE FRASER RIVER INDIANS ARE SYRIANS.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
twenty years he was in the saddle every
day, ar.<! traveled, over a vast expanse of
.Very w-i'.d- country, teaching the Indians
and rendering aid to pioneer whites.
s conceded that the reverend gentle
. man basdone more to subdue the Indians
all other agencies combined.
. . Canon Good has been thirty -five years in
i and church work in Brit
ia, he having come from Eng
viaSan Francisco, in 18GL Though
me years past .rector of St. Paul's
h at Nanaimo, he has always main
eep interest in the Indians there
who were his. original proteges.
.â â¢The :ntrepi.i missionary some years ago
published a dictionary- and grammar of
the. lndian language. The book gave him
.ding, which he has ever since
â .and has been sought for far
asd. near. The Smithsonian Institution at
Washington, D. C, has been specially in
-â¢searcb.es and conclusions,
and at his suggestion has sent men to
British Columbia to collect the folklore of
l_ I .<: : ians. .'. â  .'. _â¢-.. ." â  â¢ "
"I first went to Nanaimo," said the dis
tinguished, missionary, preacher, and re
mained there till l- : ''.. After that I was
twenty years on the main land in charge
of a large area. I founded the mis-ion at
Lytton, at the j\in< tion of the Thompson
River with the Fraser. It is a large mis
sion now. The Thompson River Indians
! civilized and Christianized. They
. farm, raise cattle and do everything
that white men do, beinc useful factors in
civilization. There .are industrial schools
all through the country, and there is quite
a -tiff of clergymen and teachers now
â where I once had so much to do alone.
"There arc 2500 0f tne Thompson River
Indians, and 1.e.- ides thes-e therenj-f several
hundred Bhuswap and LiTooets. The lat
ter tribes speak cognate tongue.-. The
T >oroiriio:i Government now eives large
.nts annually in support of the In
dians. It is turned over to whatever de
!:â¢ ruination is workinjj among them. This
plan has been found to work exceedingly
well."
The missionary is an able Greek, He
brew and Latin scholar. He says his
study of the language of the Indians of
that section has convinced him that they
are of Assyrian origin, and are to all mm
d purposes Assyrians as they now
p.rc. Many of their words now in use are
Assyrian.
"1 was astonished at the richness of this
laneuage," he said, "and its wonderful
ty for accurate expression. The
language vras metaphysical in the highest
decree The morel siudied it the more I
was charmed with it. The language was
devetaping .-ill the time new beauties.
'I found many pure Syrian words in it,
as, for instance, Eneas and Solomon-Chute,
88. * The= words of the
language ure historical and traditional,
and observe t.v- same laws as those of the !
language.
â¢'I think the language of the Thompson
River Indians Ea one : of .the Toranian
tongues. There are direct Syrian worlds
in it. .. :
"Then there are other evidences that
these Indians are the Syrian descendants.
Their medicine man > the same as the
Syrian seer. The burial customs are to
thisday the same. Ik-sides this there is
the character of the people, who are Syr
ians in thought, har.jts of life and general
customs.
"In studying tholr language one can see
that dynasties have risen and fallen; that
there have been great governments and
able men and a hi-h state of civilization
at times. The indications are all there. It
is the language of a refined people. It has
fallen now to a low state; is probably
worse now than it ever was. Yet it is a
rich find for the philologist.
"My opinion is that the Syrians came
over to this country when the land and
water were differently arranged. It was
no odd storm-driven cause that landed by
chance a few people here, who. thus in
creased to tribes. I gave/u p that
view, which was for a long time held by
eminent men. When I became a close
student of the Indians there and their
language, I simply laughed at the pre*
posterousness of it.
"I had occasion to thus express myself
to some noted German pilologists wlio wore
recently sent out to the Indians to make
investigations concerning them. They told
me that I was evidently right; that atleast
the lone canoe theory could not account
for the characteristic Indian population pi
that region. They informed me that the
ideas of European scientists were undergo
ing a good deal of a change. '; :
"There are ten different tongues spoken
by the Indians of British Columbia as a
whole. TheÃlackfoot Indians, who prac
tically include the coast Indiana, are quite
different from the Thompson River In
dians, of whom I speak. :
"The interesting folklore of these In
dians lam afraid, will soon be lost. It is
a wonderful folklore â liner, I think, than
any other with which lam acquainted.
We are so .influencing the rising genera
tion of Indians that in a few years it will
be pone. : .
"For this reason I lately. Tvrote the
Smithsonian Institution, giving the facts in
full, and asking that competent men be
sent on to collect the folklore. I have re
ceived a reply, saying that just as soon as
one of their men linishes some important
work he is now on he will come at once.
The folklore exceeds in interest anything
I ever read.
"When I first went among the Indians
they had their war chiefs as well as their
civil chiefsâ the same as the Greeks. All
I saw in every way convinced me, and I
have during the ensuing years been very
fully confirmed in my conviction that these
Indians are Syrians." .
The distinguished investigator who has
so long labored among the Indians will be
here for some weeks. His health has'.bs
come somewhat impaired by his long and
unceasing labors, and he will now rest up
in a milder climate.
WRECKED BY A RUNAWAY
A Heavy Wagon Demolished on
an Electric Pole on
Broadway.
Two Frantic Horses Dash Downhill
Through Crowds of Little
Children.
There was an exciting runaway yester
day alternoon on Pacific street which re
sulted in the wrecking of a large delivery
wagon and the breaking of Frank Spear
man's left leg, near the ankle. Early
yesterday morning the driver of Riiey's
milk wagon while passing along Broad
way, between Stockton and Powell met
with the loss of one of his wagon wheels.
He went to a stable near by and hired a
large express wagon in order to complete
the delivery of milk to his customers.
Yesterday afternoon Riley, whose ranch
is on the i-'an Bruno road, sent the wagon
hack in charge of James Hogan and Frank
Spearman. They hitched up a younj; un
broken horse in order to give it some ex
ercise. The driver went over Van Ness
avenue to Pacific, and along that thor
oughfare until lie reached the top of the
hiil. Vv'hen he started down the hill to
ward Mason street, the young horse be
came fractious and showed a disposition to
run|away. His actions caused two other
youns men who hail mounted the wagon
to jump to the ground.
The team was noing at a rapid rate
down the steep hill when one of the lines
broke and Hogan lost control of the
animals. In a second both were off like a
shot dashing down the hill. As they
neared Scott place, a narrow street be
tween Pacific and Broadway, Hogan pulled
on the one line and the horses turned sud
denly to the left and daslieU into the nar
row thoroughfare. The wagon made the
turn on two wheels and Hogan and Spear
man were hurled to the ground. Hogan
escaped with a few bruises, but Spearman
went under the wheels and his leg was
broken.
In less than a half minute the team had
passed through Scott place and ran upon
the sidewalk on the norch side of Broad
way. After breaking several fences and
blocks in the artilicial stone sidewalk the
horses piled -the wagon up on its side
against an electric pole standing on the
ed^e of the sidewalk. The w.agon was
badly wrecked, and as an odd incident, it
WAS wrecked in front of the owners-- door.
The horses broke anart and ran 'for many
blocks before they were caught.
Spearman was sent to the Receiving
Hospital by Oihcer Kaskeil. At the time
of the runaway several hundred children
were playing on Pacific street, Scott place
and Broadway, and it was almost a mir
acle that none were killed or crippled by
the horses or wagon.

CRUSH AT THE CENTURY.
the Features Were Music,
Salad, Talk and Egg
nog.
SUCCESS OF TEE FUNCTION.
Five Hundred Invitations Were Given
.. ; by the Ladies of the Insti
tution.
The ladies of the exclusive and in
tellectual Century Club did put on a few
.extra touches to enhance the grace and
beauty of their presence on the occasion of
the "open house" yesterday afternoon.
This is true of some of the members of the
board of directors as well as many who
do not hold official position in the club.
j This signifies' that devotees of art and
literature, the exponents of the higher
civilization of refinement, the disciples of
â culture among women, will select a color,
adjust a ribbon or brush the hair in a
style to please and captivate. If they do
this on New Year's day they will probably
do the same thing all the year round.
. Five hundred invitations were issued for
the reception yesterday, and the result was
a crush. Mrs. John F. Swift, the president
of the Century, stood bravely at her post,
where she received her quests with grace
: and dignity. In a similar position Mr.
Coc, president of the Press Club, could not
have achieved greater distinction for pres
ence of mind and tact, and as for Horace
I'lait, president of the Bohemian Club, he
is simply not in Mrs. Swift's class.
While the attendance at the Century
was large the proportion of women to men
was live to one. Since the club is a
Women's institution and the new year is a
.foap. year, it-follows as a natural sequence
â that the chief interest of the function per
tains to the gentlemen who"graced the
occasion by their presence."
, J. C Siubbs, the stately demi-blonde
from the big railroad office, was sur
rounded by a bevy of admiring Century
stars.
Colonel Frank Sumner, ex-paymaster
general on the staff of ex-Governor Mark
â liainj received a great deal of. attention
from the ladies. He was rirst to enter ana
?last to leave tlie rooms.
Louis Sloss Sr. ( from his position near
the eggnogg bowl downstairs, received
many greetings. He wore a smile of ap
proval. .
Superior Judge Daniel J. Murphy had a
great deal of attention until Judge C'offey
arrived.
Horace Wilson had a beautiful lady on
his arm, and wore the smile of satisfac
tion. . - .' .:' .; -.
Dr. Behr, whose system of moral
philosophy : teaches moderation in the
practice of temperance, was shown to the
Balad counter upstairs. The genial doctor
was dismayed by the crush, and failed to
reach the egg nog stand.
Dr. Middfetpn of the United States army
by reconnoisance early in the
.afternoon that a hallway led directly to
the eggnog alcove, and conld l>e traversed
trom lite enter door without passing
through the main crush. He imparted the
intelligence to A. B. Hallidie, and the
smile of the century lighted the counten
ance of the latter. Mrs. Swift will now
understand . why she saw several gentle
men passing tier reviewing station going
out who were not seen when they came
in. They simply handed their cards to the
door attendant, pa.-sed down the hall
way to the eggnog, and then returned
through the main parlor to the president's
position. â¢â¢:
John Perry Jr. got in the crush at the
foot of the 'stairway leading to the salad
and seemed to:enjoy the pressure.
When B. P. Flint arrived the crush was
gre&teat. His holiday smile, which was
nicely adjusted when he came in, gave
way to an expression of alarm. When
.confidence was restored he saluted the
president, winked at the pianist and sam
pled the refreshments.
11. B. Jlathbone, from the classic pre
cincts of Ãerkeley, received a great deal of
/.attention from the ladies, who were all in
quiring, "Where is Professor Moses?"
Horace Hill of the Pacific-Union Club
was a dream of beauty, and no mistake.
He wore the most radiant of smiles and
lias not been happier since his resignation
from the Board of [supervisors was ac
cepted.
Artist Peixotto wore his hair without
brnament. The pose of the young man
tii <t i served the eggnog arrested ihe ar
tistic attention of Mr. Peixotto.
When Colonel W. R. Parnell entered he
hesitated whether to advance or retreat,
.but seeing that a comrade of George H:
Thomas Post had an eye on him, he ad
vanced tvith a firm step. The crush di
verted him ;from the eg^nog to the salad.
Returning f torn up stairs, he seemed as
happy as a veteran with an increased pen
sion.
l)r. George H. Powers, who sings "Life
for Evermore" in the chorus of "Nazareth" :
with a vigor that animates, seemed to be i
in great favor at the Century. He was j
sighing for salad at â¢"> p. m.
Uncle George T. Bromley was escorted
by Albert Gerberding. It was the duty of
the escort to keep the crowd of ladies in
check when Mr. Bromley arrived. It is j
the custom of Uncle George to terminate a ;
function at 6 a.m.; therefore when the
j ladies proposed to dismiss the musicians
j and cioae the refreshment-rooms at 0 p.. >f.
hi- smile of gratification reiaxed into a
look oi surprise. . <
Thoma; Maeee of real estate renown was
one of the callers yesterday. Dr. George
W. Merritt, Alex Morrison, John Bonner
and quite a .company of younger gentle
men attended the function. Some7)f the
youngsters were with mamma, and all be
haved with exceeding propriety.
The reception was indeed a great suc
cess. The display of posters, the artistic
sketches, the decorations and the music
delighted the visitors.
The directors of the Century are: Mrs.
P. B. Cornwall, Mrs. Frances Edgerton,
Mts. Jiamon Wilson, Miss Agnes Lowry,
Mrs. Ed O. Wright, Mrs. Bunnell, Miss
Agnes Manning, Mrs. Whittell, Mrs.
Elisha Ransome, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,
Mrs. Austin Sperry, Mrs. Sidney Cushing
and Mrs. Robert McKenzie.
/ The reception committee, which deserves
so much credit for the success of the New
Year function, consisted of: Mrs. Henry
Gibbons, Miss Ella Adams, Miss Virginia
Fitcn, Mrs. Ramon Wilson, the Misses Bea
ver, Miss Agnes Lowry, Miss Isabel Lowry,
Mrs. Joseph Marks, Mrs. Isidore Burns,
Mrs. Ed C. Wright, Mrs. A, Gerberding,
Miss Eleanor Briggs, Miss Partridge and
Mrs. Barton.-
Among the recent gifts to the club is a
fruit piece in oil painted 03' Mrs. Helen A.
Fitch, a member of the Century.
TEE TERRY BUILDING.
Contractor CJorrilVs Arguments in Favor
of the Use of Granite in Its
Construction.
R. W. Gorrill, /he contractor interested
in the new ferry depot, was asked Jast
night about the substitution of granite for
Oregon stone on the State building to be
erected at the foot of Market street.
"I ought not to speak about the matter,"
said Mr. Gorrill, "but 1 cannot help hear
ing what Deople.say. I have heard over a
hundred leading business men of San
Francisco discuss the matter and I have
yet to hear of one who does not consider
that granite would be much better than
Oregon or any other stone.
"For my own part, I think there is no
comparison. Granite will be more durable,
will look more beautiful, more solid, more
dignified, if you like, and is. in every way
to be preferred. lam sure no architect
would prefer to see Oregon graystone to
California granite.
"All this criticism and Controversy would
have to cease at once if it became" known
that the Harbor Commissioners had de
cided on granite. There pannot possibly
be two opinions about its durability,
whereas there seems to be a dozen about
the proposed Oregon atpnÂ°. . â 
"A massive granite pile at the foot of
Market street would be . something far
grander than people who have: not seen
such stately edifices can imagine. If it
should cost $100,000 niorie It would, be,, in
my opinion, money well, spent. So long
as ihe appropriation has been, njade let us
have a first-class piece of workv '.."â  -'[ 'â :
"I think that California graniteâ which,.
as everybody knows, is the best in the
world â could be substituted for Oregon
graystone and the price still be lower than
any bid except ours, As the contract is
let at present granite would cost fnore, but
nothing to speak of in comparison with
the improvement in the buildings I do
not even know if it would be possible now.
to make the change with tue contract
being let, but I presume that the narties
to any contract can legally make any
changes mutually agreeable* . -''=â¢â â¢â .-. :
"There is nothing in the world that can
be made to look as handsome a* California
granite, and no matter what stone can be
used, it cannot produce the same effect.
This is not my opinion alone, but is that
of everybody with whom I converse."
COLLEGES I N A CLUSTER
Requirements for the Fine New
Buildings Soon to Be
Constructed, â 
Schools of Medicine, Law, Pharmacy,
Dentistry and Veterinary Sur- 7
gery in Prospect.
Much interest is rife in scholastic circles
regarding the proposed new buildings for
the affiliated colleges of the State Uni
versity soon to be erected on the Sutro
site. The Board of Regents has sent out
a circular containing a list of. requirements
for the projected edifices,, from which
architects desfring to submit plans. will be
able to learn, in a general way, what is :
wanted. â¢â â  V.
The College of Medicine Is to be exten
sive and provided with all requisites of
such institutions. This building is ex
pected to contain, among other., apart*'
ments, two lecture-rooms, each capable of
accommodating 350 students; from four to
six recitation halls, each to contain 100
pupils, and seven laboratories of the flame
capacity. There is also to be a dissecting
room with forty tables, beside, a spacious
museum, six clinic-rooms, from six to nine
apartments for the professors, administra
tion headquarters, students' jheetrng and
recreation hall, and storago^rooms, jani
tors' quarters, etc. :
Another tine miilding will be the Col
lege of Dentistry, to contain an operating
room with space iorei hty chairs, a library
and reading- room, a lecture hall capable of
seating 300 students, the seats in which
are to be graduated, two classrooms, each
for a hundred students, besides seven or
eight laboratories, working-roams for plas
ter and plate work, and other departments
proper for an institution of the kind.
The Collie of Pharmacy will cover an '
area of L'3,Su4 square feet, distributed over i
four floors. On the rim will be the offices
two laboratories, cloak and bat rooms,' !
meeting and recreation halls for male ami
female students and the administration i
headquarters. Above will be the library â 
and museum, two classrooms with apart- '
ments tor two professors two rooms for :
apparatus, a laboratory, lecuire-room and â 
conference hall. A similar arrangement i
will prevail on the other two floors, the
top floor being occupied for the riioat part
by microscopic, chemical, polanseopic an-d
sjiectroscopic laboratories, with two class
rooms, professor*' quartern and two stock-
rooni3. . I
The Veterinary College promises to be ]
very complete in its way if the present
conception is to be realized. The ground
floor is to be a hospital with a large cen
tral space for operations and examination,
of cases brought in for treatment, to be
Burronnded by stalls, ofecÂ©B, pharmacies
and a small room for the faculty: The]
second floor is to comprise a lecture-room, ]
bacteriological laboratory and two class
rooms, while on the third floor the dis
secting-room, chemical laboratory and.!
library and read j, 1f ,-room will be placed.
No information has been given 'as yet re- ]
garding the Hastings Law College,* but it i
is anticipated that no effort will be spared j
to make it in every sense the peer of the}
other colleges. . .. ';. '. j'

UNLOCKED CORISO'S GOLD
Mrs. Bowman's Story of a Treaty
Just Completed With
.. Navajo Chiefs.
WHITE MEN MAY NOW MINE.
Remarkable Triumph Over the Super
stitions of Centuriesâ The
Indian Schools. .
Mrs. S. C. Bowman, for many years past
matron at the schools of the S'ava.jo In
dian' nation in Arizona, thirty miles from
Gallup, whose husband was long agent of
the Mavajos, arrived here yesterday and is
fit the tick. . v / : , ;
The lady, who Is now well along in years,
has had many remarkable experiences on
that part of the frontier and has had
many narrow escapes for her life when the
Indians threatened to go on the. warpath.
Her health is not very good and she has
come to San Francisco for a chango of sur
roundings.
She . has brought â with her. many
interesting souvenirs of . the .strange
peoples throughout the country gener
ally known as the Great Southwest.
Among these are one: or two magnificent
Mrs. S. C. Bowman.
[Sketched by a "Call" arttit.]
Nava jo. blankets, worth several hundred
dollars each; silver and iron rings in
the rough made by aborigines and set with
beautiful pieces, of turquoise gathered in
the mountain?, and other things with
which she has chanced to Come in contact.
Mrs. Bowman says a very important
treaty has just been consummated with the
Navajo nation, whereby the rich mines of
the Coriso Mountains may be worked.
For many years daring white men have
endeavored to work the gold ledges^ of
these mountains.. The ledges were known
to be extremely rich. The yellow metal
brought .out from the mines at. different
times by the Navajos showed this.
The Indians, . however, have always re
fused the white, men access to the mines.
They were killed by. the way or in the
mines, if they happened by chance to get
that far.; Many and many a murder has
been committed because of these mines*
"There have been so many losses of life
because of the insistence, of daring white
men to get into, the Coriso Mountains,"
said Mrs. Bowman, "that, just how many
wore killed no.one knows,, but certainly a
vast number. The ledges were so rich that
the white prospectors' would risk almost
anything to get in. Few of them ever
survived. They were met at the mountain

passes ana abruptly shot down by the
Indians.
â 'During all the years that I have lived
among the Navajos, and back to. the earli
est times, the tribes have held possession
of these ledges and guarded them with the
greatest strictness from all intruders.
"KeDeated efforts have been made from
time, to time to gain access to them, but till
now every effort has failed. Major Con
stant Williams, the agent of the Navajos,
has, however, filially gained their consent
for the .white miners to go in. It is a sig
nal triumph, and could not have been ac
complished but for Agent Williams' long
experience with the Indians and the confi
dence they place/in him.
"Just before i left for San Francisco
tw-etye. or fifteen of the head men of the
nation, including Chiefs Black Horse, Chee
and Manuelito, met United States Agent
Williams at Fort Defiance and made an
agreement with him in writing permitting
the whites to gain.
. ."They stipulated that the agreement
should be good for one year, and that the
miners should work a rich portion of the
Corisos one mile square. AÂ» soon as the
snow is off, therefore, there will be a rush
there.
"The gold is found in ledges. There is
believed to be an enormous amount of it,
judging by the lumps and bars broueht
out from time to time by the Navajos and
exchanged for tobacco, ammunition, sugar
and. other things.
"The. Coriso ledges are 170 miles north
west of Fort Defiance. The agreement,
being solemnly made, as it was, is a matter
of great consequence, as for the first time,
j strange as it may appear, after all the
} murders, men may now safely go to these
fabulous mines, which through so raanv
generations have been so carefully guarded
from the world. It is the most important
concession, probably, that has ever oc
curred in the Southwest.
I; As for the Navajo Indians, they are
pro-pressing steadily. There are about
27.000. Indians composing the Navajo na
tion. Of these between 6000 and 7000 are
of school age, ranking between 4 and 18
years.
"The children learn rapidly and study
everything taught in the ordinary com
mon schools. We have kindergartens,
and tench the very small children in the
same way as children are taught in the
cities. 'â â -. ..'
"The older children learn to sew and
cook, play the organ and do everything
that White children do anywhere. They
Hie very bright and are making rapid
progress.
"There are many rich men among the
Nuvajos. They own vast bands of cattle,
sheepand hor.-se?,: Their women spin and
weave and altogether the nation is very
prosperous. They farm a good deal by aid
of irrigation, and are as a whole the most
industrious and independent of any In
dians on the continent.
"Their concession in allowing white men
to penetrate theCoriso Mountain?, despite
the injunctions of their fathers, is a matter
of wonder. Nobody has ever been able in
all the rast years to persuade them to per
mit this."
Mrs. Bowman will probably remain here
a coude of weeks before returning to the
Kara jo nation. The lady showed the
strange souvenirs of the Southwest to
many visitors last night, who had called
to pay their resnects.
They heard her story of the Navajos and
the opening of the Coriso mines with the
greatest interest.
OWNERSHIP OF RAILROADS.

BEGINNING TEE YEAK.
No new resolution has a value unless |
it is based on experience. The past year
has been rich in lessons both of injury ;
from betrayals of a public trust and the j
discovery of the fact. It is never suf
ficiani that there is a popular impression j
of official rascality, and still such an im- |
pression would never exist in the absence !
of a cause. When this sentiment is era- j
bodied in the form of an official expres
sion we have a legal basis for re
form. In the absence of au effi
cient Grand Jury and diligent peace I
officers and criminal courts the corrective [
power of the ballot b always available. !
But in the intervals between elections the I
most serious popular interests may be J
compromised, and there is at present the
danger that a corrupt political machinery i
may be able to perpetuate the evil.
The Grand Jury jast impaneled cannot
do better than resolve to pursue to the end
the work which the last Grand Jury so
valiantly be^an. That body discovered
that the Street Department was in in
competent hands, and when balked by
the courts on a technicality, courageously
returned to the attack and made
a new issue which will be difficult to de
feat. It pursued the disgraceful bucket
shops masquerading as poolrooms, and
looked down into a fulf in which. lurked
shadowy forms of otneial connivance and
corruption. It only hatf-turned thekey in
the lock of the penitentiary; the present
Grand Jury, by that act of the old body, is j
charged with the duty of opening the door I
for the admission of any official rogues
who would be better behind bars.
To pur^e San Francisco of political ras
cality would be only the beginning of the
useful things which those who have as
sumed to guard the welfare of California
should resolve to do. All the various as
sociations which have charged themselves
to protect and advance the interests of the
State should resolve to appreciate the
serious responsibility which they have as
sumed. They represent in an embodied
form all the decency, all the hopes and all
the aspirations of the better elements of
the State. Their organization has been
created and indorsed by the people.
Their work wi'l be the effort of all that
is best in the State. Weakness of endeavor
and failure of effort will proclaim the
unworth of California and will be notice
to the world' that the natural bounties
with which we are environed are not
meant for our enjoyment.
At the same time no citizen not an ac
tive member of these organizations is re
lieved of the smallest share of responsi
j bility. No representative body should be
i expected to be more than representative,
; any more than a stream should be. sought
I above its source. For the people to lose
i interest in the things which concern their
welfare would be for their representative
, bodies to relax their diligence. The eni
â  plover who ia less alert than his agents
will never prosper. The people must
resolve to stand behind these represent
ative bodies and m every way urge them
, forward. .
, We need the Nicaragua canal. A rail
road iunding bill would be the ruin of
California. We must lighten the burdens
1 which hamper our ocean commerce. We
must seek to push the market for our prod
ucts into all countries reached by ship
; and rail. We must invoke the
aid of the Government to secure
reasonable rates for overland transporta
tion. We must resolve generally to
show the world what California is" and
: what Californians are, to the end that the
: products of our soil and climate shall come
. to be regarded as necessary to all the
: world, and the intelligence of our people
j an essential factor in determining the
; course and character of civilization.
COLLECT THE DEBT.
It k unfortunate that there should have
developed a lack of unanimity in S-an
Francisco on the subject of the fund
ing bill and the collection of the debt
owed by the. aided railroads to the Gov
ernment. The Union for Practical Prog
ress; has taken issue with the Committee
of Fifty, charging, that the: 'committee is
not carrying out the wishes of the people
expressed lib mass-meeting, for the reason
that it has failed to take steps for submit
ting to the people in another mass-meeting
a bill, to be presented in Congress, pro
viding for Government ownership. of these
roads, and that the committee is ronfin
in.q its efforts to a defeat ol the proposed
funding; Jneasures without reference . to
.Government ownerships
The two â propositions, are so radically
unlike in purpose, and : principle/.; that to
consolidate them would be to weaken
them both. The matter of collecting the
debt by foreclosing the mortgage is a sim
ple busines? proposition based on justice
and constituting a necessary rule of busi
ness conduct. Goverrinjent ownership is
purely a political matter, and as such will
be viewed differently by different: persons.
To confound business with politics in this
great railroad question would be to. weaken
the ficht which California is making.
The Committee of Fifty has taken ground
whose merits cannot be called in question.
By ?o doing it has. a voided raising a politi
cal issue and creating injurious antagon
ist:.-. In the order of the settlement of
the whole question the collection of the
debt must come first. Government owner
ship would be impossible without it. To
enforce the collection is to begin at the be
ginning. Political considerations, might
follow if deemed expedient. The collection
of the debt would in nowise interfere with
subsequent questions of a political char
acter..
The defeat of a funding measure would
mean the necessity for the Government to
proceed with foreclosure. So lon^ as the
legal machinery of the Government is tied
up with pending legislation purporting to
aim at the se.ttlemerit.of thequesikm noth
ing can be done. Tf all suca legislation is
thrown out the Government will have to
proceed with the collection of the debt.
The ordinary way is to secure judgment
and foreclose on the mortgage. The Gov
ernment may then, if it pleases, become a
bidder, and so taKe charge of the property
and operate it in the interest of the people.
But this is not the time for raising that
iasue. '-â ['â â 
ASSIST 1-HE /GABNIVAL.
The editor of The Call has received a
letter from J. P. Carroll of Visalia, Baying:
"Acting on an editorial in The Call 1 have
several citrus-erowera interested in the
idea of sending an exhibit of Tulare
County citrus fruits to the Frost Palace at-
Truckee. At their request 1 write you to
use your influence with Wells, Fargo &
Co/8 Express to give us a special rate on
the same, the fruit to leave hero on Fri
day, the 3d inst."
From this we infer that the express com
pany has not made a special rate. If it j
has not we are confident that it will, as in !
the past it has always exhibited a com- j
niendable spirit of co-operation with such i
enterprises. Likely this branch, of the
ice carnival, being of very recent and
wholly unexpected development, has not
been brought to the -attention of the ex
press company. It is hoped thatthis no
tice will be sufficient. .Beyond the force of i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1*96.
a reasonable argument The Call has no
influence to use with that company.
The editorial referred to was one com
mending tne idea originating in one of the
south-.Tn towns in the State of making a
sharp contrast of California's various cli
mates by displaying oranges and lemons
in an ice palace. That editorial said noth
ing of the .plans of the carnival managers
in the premises, but evidently the idea has
been adopted by them, for C. P. Mc-
Glashan, president of the Trucke* Ice Car
nival Company, writes the Visalia Board
of Trade that the offer of that section to
send a citrus exhibit has given the man
agement much, pleasure, and that suitable
arrangements will be made for its display.
While it mieht have been more regular for
the managers of the carnival to make ar
rangements with the express company, in
case this has been overlooked the express
company can do a graceful and useful
thing by taking the initiative and offering
the customary concessions.
AITAIES IN CUBA.
The Cuban situation has recently taken
on some new features of great significance.
Not. only have the insurgents advanced i
almost to the walls of Havana, but they i
are systematically destroying all sugar I
cane which growers begin to press, while ;
giving notice that no cane will be de- 1
stroyed which is not intended for the im
mediate manufacture of sugar. The im
portance of these two recently developed j
incidents of the rebellion will be appre- |
ciated when they are submitted to anal
ysis; .' .I V. .'';;* â â â â â 
-. With regard to the investing of Havana,
the rebels are displaying no hurry. They t
are well aware that their present slow and j
patient tactics are far better than haste. |
While the money and power which control j
Havana are in sympathy with Spain, a
: majority of the city's population are
friendly to the insurgents. For the insur
gents to hover as a menace in the distance
is to put the loyalty of the rich Spanish
j adherents on a strain aud give time for the
i love of freeiipm among the common peo- |
ple to work as a leaven. . The natural re
sult of such a policy, in the absence of one
]or two overwhelming ; victories by the j
Spanish forces, will be to produce in Ha- j
vana such a condition of anarchy as that i
which Paris suffered after the battle of Se- ;
j dan. That would mean the rising of the I
I masses airainst Spanish authority and i
I gold, and the final opening of the city's !
gates to the insurgents. : â ;'â â '.
This end is being hastened by the burn- !
ing of the cane crops in the interior. It :
was a signal act of diplomacy on the part \
j of the insurgents to exempt from destruc
| tion all crops that are not to be manufac
i tured at Once into sugar. To heed Gomez'. I
' warning not to manufacture is to withold
â  a Tich and greatly needed â  revenue from
i Spain, and to ignore it is an invitation to
| ruin. Whatever may be the political mcli:
: nations of the planters (we may be sure,
| they are with Spain), if ; they defy Gomez
! they accomplish their own ruin without,
! aiding Spain, ami if they heed his warn
j ing they lend to that act a color of assist
â¢ ance to hi 9 cause, . This is one of the ablest'
' pieces of generalship, that modem warfare
j ha? developed. It will paralyze business j
j in Havana and reduce the common people
to beggary. From that to insurrection is a
) very short step. ..: â  '_.;']
:; Thus the delay in investing Havana and';j
i the policy of destroying the sugar crop !
; under the conditions adopted have a com-.'!
mon purpose, and in the natural order of .
things will produce the result desired by '
j the' rebels, â :'â .â¢-.â¢. â¢;' ' â  â  I.i
h Minor incidents of the campaign are the
j discovery that the savage : tactics of the j
rebels- overmatch the fine military dis-j
cipHne.of the Spanish troops; that the ad- }
vent of winter, on which. the Spaniards [
counted so much, has shown merely, that,
they have lost ground' and are beginning
to face the fact that they must^make the '
final stand at Havana, where their ener
giea.will be divided among efforts to keep ;
; the enemy at bay, feeding the people and
suppressing insurrections within the Walla ;
that ihe machete, that terrible knife-.
Cleaver with which the natives cut their
cane and which splits open the man upon
tvhom it falls, is more formidable in the
hands.of dosperate fighters than the finest
rifle that mechanical genius can contrive,
and ragged, hungry and ignorant rebels,
Inspired by a love of liberty and the in
herent right of self-government, are
Steadily gaining ground apainst the arms
arid prestige of one of theoldest, richest
and proudest monarchies in the world.

THE PLACERVILLE INCIDENT.
Bishop Wingfield Discusses it
â â â / in a Vigorous Manner. . â 
BE:nciA;Cal., JÂ»n 1. 1896.
Editor of the San Francisco (Jailâ Dear Sib:
Allow me a brief reply to your telegrams from
Placerville. ' " â¢ â  ;â¢; ." â¢ : â¢" .
The Church of the Ssvfor.at Placerville is
not a union church, as, sonie may be led to
suppose, but is the property 1 of the Protestant
Episcopal church,' and wa'6 built by the Epis
copalians of the town, assisted by friends, of
the church outside the congregation; on a lot
presented by the late Charles McLean., for
many years a resident of the place and the
agent for Wells, .Fargo Express Company..- It
was paid for in full and consecrated by the late
Rev. Dr. Kip, s is testified to by Mrs. Fotyler.
who was confirmed on thep(;casibri." ; â¢;. â¢ .%
The present vestry dp ; not know in whpm
the church property is vested, but think it was
deeded to "trustees," Which is not at ail likely,
inasmuch as the property of the church is
I usually vested in the' name of the vestry, or
the Bishop and his successors in : office, or in
an incorporated vestry. Therefore the asser
tion of the seriqef of the telegram that the ves
try contracted with Mr. Peiree.for "services :
to be given gratuitously for life" is not only
absurd, but is far from, creditable to the so
called vestry. . '. â¢â¢ â¢.â â¢ ' 'â â â â â â ': .--.
The fact is' that Bishop Kip sent Mr. Peirce
1 as a missionary to Placerville, and in that ca
i pacity he has acted ever since. Bishop Kip told
I me many years ago that, he had given him a
i great deal of trouble in consequence of his In
i aependrnt and defiant spirit, and that he had
I concluded two or three times to remove him,
which he could not have : done had he been
rector of a parish. It is siinpiy ridiculous to
say that Mr. Peirce "so arranged at the time of
the building of thechureh to prevent itbecom
i ing a part of the'dlocese and under the eon--
I trol of the Bishop, and thereby subjecting him
to removal from his chosen field during his
lifetime." â¢ . . ,- : '
If Mr. Peirce is a graduate of the General
I Theological Seminary of New York, he is no
j credit to tne pulpit, for his average congrega
tion is about six women and one or two men.
Nor does he "conform strictly to the letter of
i the Protestant Episcopal^.ritual." His popu
| larity is not due to h" is devotion to the mm*
' utry, but to the fact of his being a devotee to
secret fraternities and to his presqntsto the :
children. He told me many years ago that.he
had spent $ 6000. in distributing picture-cards
and little books to the young.
Your correspondent charges me with "taking
exception to-M.r. Peirco's.deyotion and time
given to the different lodges and assaulting
I and insulting him, striking, him a : cowarfily
I blow like a living bruiser, and expostulating
with him against his connection with the Ma
sonic society, which detracted so much from
the church." All of .which 1 will briefly dis
i pose of by saying there is not a single word of
I truth in it, or if a strong expression will die-
I pose of it better, "It is a lie out of the whole
i cloth. : â  ..'.â¢â '.:â¢ .- â¢â  â 
Your correspondent, to make the situation
more sensational, says, "the woman screamed," :
! "the Bishop entered into a.discussion with two
I men," both of which statements are in opposi-
I tion. to the facts. â¢ â¢â¢ â¢ ' . â  ' -I
As for the attendance of a Deputy Sheriff; I
I do not believe it, as I saw but two men present
j and I know that neither was a. public officer.
; Then as for the prepared affidavit read by Mr. ;
i Peirce, standing not in the chancel nor in the
f pulpit, but like myself on thelloorof tbeaisle of.
j the church after- morning : service had been
readâ in which he afllrins that I said : "Ah !
j That is what keeps men out of the church;
I they are here, when they ought to be in
j church." thatlsaid: " Hey, jny boy, riothere
I but in the church, sir; -."that I then "struck
j with clinched fist, a violent blow on his affirm
â¢ ant" and followed it : with the : words "Not
here but in the church; my boy," in which he '
reatllrms that he "heard these threatenlngs
and felt the beating of the fist, under -the
â  eÂ«rthly and eternal petia.l;ies of perjury" â
, all this is simply as false U cau be. I again
! say that there is not an iota of truth in such
: affirmations, however solemnly they .were
made. I repeat "tbey are .lies manufactured
out oi the whole cloth." . ' â  .-.- !
Finally, it is state 1 by your correspondent
â  that I "afioloffized for the impulsive language
I used." This is mjypiateinerit ot fact.
I have been taugh t to call a spado â â¢'a spade" ; i
and. when I; stigmatize toischood as "a lie" I !
do not use such a term nnde.r .impulse- or bad
j feeling, but '.simply with a view- of calling
] things by their right proper names; let the
; consequences be what they may. I. wijlgoso
j tar.iaa to say that I do not tt'lic.ve Mr. Peirce
riritended to state untruths,- because I do not
think him responsfbio for what he affirms. :
This is the mo*t charitable coustrtiction r

NEW ARMY FATIGUE CAP.
Yesterday the officers ami men of the- regular
army all over the United States wore for the
first time their new fatigue caps. They are so
different in appearance fr^m the. enps Which
the United States soldiors.have worn' for a hu'.f
century as to be distinctly; noticeable. ' . â¢â ; " :
In shape they are. like those worn .by the
pfMcerg of the navy, and are.not only'-diffe-rent
in form from the old nrmy caps, bui; -the visor
foils down 6ver the brow,.b.eing a prbiec.tion to
the eyf 3 of the.'wearer. â¢: â¢; â  V*.. :
The soldiers are'so-veli pleased' with the
new headgear that they have been wearing
them when off the post and away from the ofli
cers.
'Yon see," said a Presidio artilleryman yes
terday, exhibiting his new cap, "the orders
from the War Department were that the army
Soldier Wearing the New Fatigue Ca
should come out in their new capÃ on New
Year's day all over the country, but the men
would put them .on when coming down
town. Of course they wouid look out and not
let any of the oflicers catch them. But to-day
they are a part of the regulation uniform.
'â¢They are not .as handsome as the old ones,
but are more comfortable. The boys have
named them the 'Dutch caps,' and "by that
tlile they will be known everywhere, I guess.
They cost Uncle Sam about. 74 cent* apiece,
contract price. The officers' caps have a gold
band and a, prettier device,, which makes them
look imarter, and the high privates do iiot
show up quite as well."

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
There is something of poetical justice in the
reception meted out in Berlin to Sir Arthur
Sullivan's "Ivanhoe." Yearsaijo thiscomposer
had two paths open to him. His "Light of the
World" opened the higher way. "The "Sor
cerer" and "Trial by Jury" led in a less ex
alted road. Sir Arthur chose operetta 'â¢be
cause thtre was money in it." In his mature
years he has been taken with the desire to
leave more lasting footprints on the sands of
time than "Pinafore" or "The Mikado" were
likely to make for him. With this end in view
he wrote. "lvanhoe," which had a success of
Sir Arthur Sullivan.
[From an engraving.] :
[esteem in England some years ago. By what is
; vulgarly known as a "pull" he has succeeded
! in producing "Ivanhoe" in Berlin, and in spite
j of the fact that the Emperor has been several
; times to see it, the press aiid the public are not
I at all favorable to the work. One newspaper,
; which is enthusiastic over the costumes and
j scenery which have been lavished on "Ivau
â  hoe," proposes that they should be utilized for
i Marschner's opera, "The Templar and the Jew
. ess," which is also founded on Sir Walter Scott's
celebrated romance.
In the meantime "The Mikado" is attracting
crowds to the little Berlin theater Under the
j Lindens, which seems to emphasize the fact
â  that Sir Arthur Sullivan, having chosen the
way of operetta, must keep to itâ in other
; words, he has made his bed and has to lie in it.
"An antiquary in Rome. M.G. Koppe," says
the Koman newspaper L'ltalia, "hns just dis
covered a splendid quartet, of instruments by
Stradivarius. It is composed of two violins, a
viola and a violoncello, and Stradivarius is
supposed to have executed the order for Philip
the Fifth, of Spain, given through.: Cardinal
Alfceronjt. Each instrument bears in relief the
arms of the Bourbons of Spain, the heads are
inscribed with the royal lilies and the bridges
are of sculptured ivory. The viols bear the
inscription, 'Antoriins Stradivarius faciebat
Cremona MDCCXVIII.V The instruments are
weli preserved, each one being in its original
case of walnut wood. This quartet, which is
absolu te'iy original <>l its kind, has a great his
torical M well as an artistic interest." L'ltalia,
however, omits to say where the instruments
were discovered, and who owned them when
M. G. Koppe discovered them.

Narrow Escape of Three Hunters
Lost From the Sealing Schooner
J. Eppinger.
The agreement which has been entered
into between the Ship-owners' Association
and the Boarding-masters' Shipping Asso
ciation regarding the shipping of men has
Caused considerable discussion along the
water front. By the terms of tne agree
ment the Ship-owners' A ssociation will
only take men on their coasting vessels out
of certain sailor boarding-house 3. These
must be persons who have never been en
gaged in a strike against the association,
and whose record, which will be kept in
the shipping oilice, is pood as regards debts
for clothing and board, etc.
This combination, which is called the
Coast Seamen's Shipping Association, is
destined to oppose the Coast Seamen's
ami to prevent any future strikes on
the part of that organization.
"Of course it is all an attempt to bar out
union sailors," Baid K. Rosenberg, acting
secretary of the Coast Seamen's Union in
the absence of. Andrew Faroseth, who is
in Washington. "Secretary Walt hew of
the Shin-owners 1 ' Association coi.
now that everything is quiet along the
line, and as the union men are not worry
ing over low coasting wagi
he must create a little excitement. Bui
his boycott against those who have â¢
been engaged in strikes cuts no 6gure.
"There are only a few hundred union men
in port and they are engaged in different
occupations and have no desire to go in
association coasters at lnw wag< B, and
neither do they care who does go. None
of those twenty boarding-masters care a
fig for the association, but of course they
will enter any kind of a combine if by so
doing they can ship men who are in their
houses. T/he whole matter hardly inter
est- the members of the union and Wal
thew is welcome toall he can get on t of it. :>
Yesterday morning Peter Bishoff,
Mi< hael McConnell and Peter Anderson,
three men from the sealing schooner J.
Eppipger, came in from sea in one of the
vessel's boats. They had left the schooner
off the Farallqn Islands about 8 o'clock
Tuesday morning to hunt seals, who â 
sudden fog shut down on them, hiding the
vessel and every other object from view.
They iired off their gunÂ«, but heard no
answering report. So all day they sat in
their little hnntine boat and waited fox a
rest -lie. A number of seals were seen, and
two were shot and secured to break the
monotony of the enforced idleness.
Toward night the sea became rough and
trie boat was in clanger of becoming
swamped. The waves would breakover
tliem and while two of the men kept the
boat s head to the sea, the other man
would bail out the water as fast as he
could work. They had no idea which way
they were drifting or in which direction
the' wind was blowing. The sun went
down and still the castaways handled the
oars and bailed out their almost water
logged craft. They were worn with the
-nt labor ana" drenched to the skin
by the spray, but dared not for a moment
, slot, their constant labors.
At morning they were seen by the crew
! of a pilot-boat and taken aboard.
After the fog had lifted and they had
recovered their strength they left the
pilot-beat close in shore and sailed their
boat into the landing at Powell street.
: The men report that the J. Eppinger has
been quite successful in her work of fol
lowing the seal herd along the coast and
had taken eighty-rive skins, a number of
them near the Farallones. They expect
the schooner will come into this port be
fore continuing on her way to the Japanese
waters.

IS NOT A ROBBER.
Peculiar Features in the Case of W.
M. Morrison, a Miner From
Trinity County.
The case of \V. M. Morrison, charged
with robbery, has some peculiar features
in it and the probability is thai Judge
Joachimsen will to-morrow dismiss it.
Morrison was arrested on Christmas
night. He was in a saloon on Washington
and Montgomery streets when a man
named James Kilby from Montana alleged
that he had been robbed of his watch and
purse containing $13. Kilby was consid
erably under the influence of liquor at the
time and he charged Morrison, who had
just left the saloon, with robbing him.
The watch and purse were found upon
Morrison, but he asserted that he got them
from Kilby himself, who was afraid of
losing them.
When the case came up before Judge
Joachimssn on Tuesday several prominent
citizens testified to Morrison's good char
acter and to-morrow several more will
come forward in his favor.
Morrison was, until six weeks ago, super
intendent of a quicksilver mine in Trinity
County. lie was compelled to come to
the City for medical attendance, as the
action of the quicksilver had shattered hi 3
system. He is scarcely ab!e to stand and
h's teeth are quite loose. He is well con-

ABDUCTED HER SISTER.
The rolico Requested to Arrest May
TV'agner, Who Is on Her Way to.
Alaaka.
Mr A. M. Brown of Berkeley reported
at police headquarters yfsterdav afternoon
that May Wagner had abducted her
younger sister, Helen, 13 years of age, and
she wanted the police to take steps to have
May arrested and brought back to the City.
Helen was livinc with Mr--. Kenville, a
friend of Mrs. Brown. On Tuesday May
got her to accompany her to the City
under the rjretext of saying good-by to
another sister. May took her to the
pteaiuer bound for Seattle and detained
her en hoard till the vessel Bailed.
Mrs. Kenville is informed that May in
tends to take Helen to her grandmother
in Alaska, who is 80 years of age. Helen
had v pood home with Mrs. Kcuville and
reluctantly accompanied May to the City.
The police could do nothing and Mrs.
Brown telegraphed to the girl's father,
who is in San .lose, asking him to come to
the City at once and swear out a warrant
for May's arrest on a charge of abduction,
so that she can be caught when the boat

The girls are daughters of C. T. Wag
ner, a former employe of the Alaska Com
mercial Company, who was at one time in
comfortable circumstances. He lost bis
position with the company and shortly
afterward his wife died, which accounts
for Helen having been in the home of Mrs.
Kcnville, who is a friend of the family.
AN ANGRY HUSBAND.

SlungÃhot.
J. H. Penprase, a carriage-maker, living
jatGMerrith street, called at police head
quarters yesterday afternoon and showed
( a hole in his scalp.
"I was walking along Hattie street," he
| said, "when a man came rushing up to me
; and accused me of insulting his wife. I
told him he must have made a mistake,
: that I was a married man myselt and
1 wouldn't think of insulting any man's
; wife.
"The man called me a liar and struck
me on the head with a slungshot. I fell to
i the ground and the man ran away. 1 don't
| Know his name, but I know him by sight.
: He lives on Hattie street and 1 want him
arrested."
Penprase will swear out a warrant foi
the man's arrest.

Bartly Duttyof 1137 Tennessee street while
walking on the beach uear the Spreekels sugar
refinery yesterday forenoon, found a small
bundle which excited his curiosity. On ex

Morgue, where it remains awaiting identifica

NEW YEAR AT THE CLUB
Union League Members Celebrate
in the Old-Fashioned
Way.
ELABORATE NOON LUNCHEON.
An Ancient Member Indulges in a
Historical Retrospect Anent the
Festal Day.
Informal cordiality enthroned itself in
the elegant headquarters of the Union
League Club yesterday. The clubrooms
in the Palace Hotel looked charmingly
homelike, despite their rather imposing
proportions, and many were the admiring
comments on the tasteful decorations of the
dining-hall. This apartment was naturally
the Mecca of most of the visitors. Here
congregated jurists and statesmen, lumin
aries in the social firmament and magnates
in the marts of commerce, all enjoying the
festal occasion. The dining-hall pre
sented a most animated scene during the
noon hour, when most of the members as-
sembled for a late breakfast, or an early
lunch. Twenty-four small tables, di^;
carelessly about t lie aiutrtment, shrouded
in spotless linen and glittering with stiver
ana crystal, provided ample accommoda
tion for the gtwsts, r v f:ir the greater part
of whom were members of the club.
While there was no set bill of fare, the
lunch was both delicious and abundant.
The well-trained waite - teemed rather f o
fly than to run from one tabie to another,
while the steward saw to it that each guest
had his sh.ire of the good things. Large
platters of salad, roasts done to a
turn, dainty relishes and side dishes and
rainbow-hued glasses of Roman punch
circulated freely amid a rattling tattoo of
popping champagne corks and a now of
brilliant conversation.
In one corner sat a lawyer of no iittle
prominence, a man well known in polit
ical circles, and two acknowledged social
leader-. The lawyer was holding forth to
his confreres regarding New Year's day
in Bui Francisco as it is and as it was.
"â Why, I tell you, gentlemen," he said,
'there is nothing like the old-fashioned
New Year's <iay here now. In the fifties
and sixties this used to Lie the biggest day
in all the year. Fourth of July was
nothing to it. In those days people used
â¦o keep better hours than they do now,
and we used to commence making our calls
at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning. Some
times we would hire a carriage for three or
four gentlemen and make our calls to
eether. There was not so much talk about
hard time? t;;en, though everything was
more expensive then than now.
"And then," continued the lawyer medi
tatively, ns he helped himself to a liberal
portion of lobster mayonnaise and another
glass of champagne, 'nothing can be more
charming than the way we were received
at the houses of our friends. If a lady
were indisposed to receive calls, a dainty,
rlower-decked basket at the door pro
claimed the fact, and into this basket our
cards were placed. I suppose those cards
with their roses, forget-me-nots and bril
liant gilding would he thought in very bad
form now, but then they were considered
quite the thing, and men used to vie with
each other as to who might be able to ex
hibit the most gorgeously concocted New
Year's souvenir.
"If the ladies were at home we were
ushered in with effusive signs of welcome.
The calls usually lasted no longer than ten
minutes, though that depended in a great
measure upon the ladies, some of whom
then, as now, made a man forget that time
was passing.
"Before we left it was a cast-iron rule
that at least some little refreshment should
be partaken of. As these were frequently
of a liquid nature it may be readily sur
mised that many of the gentlemen be
came somewhat dizzy after making twenty
or thirty calls. But the ladies of those
days, dear creatures, thought little of
temperance societies, and readily forgave
a little extra jollity on New Year r s day.
"The clubs were not so stylish then as
they are now, but we clubmen used to
have grand times, I can assure you. Every
thing seemed to be managed on a more
liberal basis than at present, and we never
heard any talk about hard times or finan
cial stringency. It seems to me that this
club is more like the old-fashioned City
clubs than any other that I know of. At
least a man feels at home here."
The old lawyer had struck the nail on
the head. The great secret of the Union
League Club's popularity is that it may
with truth be called a faithful exponent of
cordial, old-fashioned Californian hospi
tality.
Stole a Diamond Pin.
Stella Brookfield, a younsr woman who is not
unknown to the police, was booked at the City
Prison yesterday by Detective Graham on the
charge of grand larceny. On December 22,
about 1 o'clock in the morning, she met
Charles Erickson, a gloveeuiter, who lives at
21 Bush street, on O'Farrell street, near the
Oberon saloon, and while talking to him is
said to have robbed him of a diamond pin
valued at $75.
AT THE THEATERS.
What Thig Week Gives and Xext Week
Promises.
Herrmann continues to present his bul
let-catching tries, as well as his other
illusions, to fairly large audiences at the
Baldwin Theater this week. Next Mon
day evening Marie Wainwright and her
company will appear in "Daughters of
Eve."
"The Widow Jones" continues to exer
cise her fascinations at the California The
ater. The May Irwin company will con
tinue the play there till the end of the
week. Next Monday Louis James will
open a season at the California Theater
witli a classic repertory. "'Virginius" will
be nis initial performance.
"Nancy at the French Ball" continues
to do good business at the Columbia Thea
ter. This is Fanny Rice's farewell week,
as the Frawley Company will return to
the Columbia Theater next Monday.
The first edition of "Ixion" is still draw
ing well at the Tivoli Opera-house. A sort
of appendix to the holiday spectacle is
now being; prepared, and on Monday
"Ixion" will be produced with a number
of new specialties, which will quite alter
its character.
"The Runaway Wife" is Droving a suc
cessful production at Morosco's. Butler is
well able to play the lending man, and the
other parts are ably sustained.
Leonard Grover's farce-comedy "Our
Boarding-house" is not so hackneyed as
to have tailed upon Alcazar patrons. The
play is well staged, and some of the acting
is above the average.
The Orpheum has a strong bill this
week. Bernard Dyllyn continues to win
as usual applause for his rendering of
'â¢Never Take tho Horseshoe From the
Door," as if the song were an absolute
novelty.
Tho Bush-street Theater will be opened
Friday night for the first time in several
months. Belasco's Lyceum School of
Acting will give a complimentary perform
ance to Miss Rosollii L.i Faille, who is
sion to make her debut in Nt-w York. "A
Celebrated Case" is scheduled as the at
traction, the cast including Miss Mabel
Rocha. and Miss Heffron, both well known
in local society circles. The best amateur
talent of the City has been secure! for the
occasion and an excellent performance
may be expected.
RAPID CENTURY RIDING.
The Olympic, Imperial and Cali
fornia Club Runs on New
Year's Morning.
The Contestants Rode a Hundred Miles
Around the Bay in Seven
Hours.
To ride 100 miles on a bicycle within
seven hours is a feat not a greac many can
accomplish, and it is made the harder
when the roads are bad and the weather
disagreeable. Still, where club reputation
or glory is at stake, a wheelman will do
almost anything, and when the Garden
City Cyclers of San Jose announced last
week that they would be the first ones to
ride a "century," or 100 miles, in 159(.5,
some of the local clubs decided that they
would give them a rub for the honor at
any rate.
Promptly at midnigbt Tuesday three
parties left this City intent on riding to
San Jose and back on the Oakland side in
as short a space of time as possible. The
Olympic Club Wheelmen sent out eight
men under command of "Will H. Haley.
They were George Tantan, H. C. Ramsay,
R. R. Does-cher, M. L. Espinosa, L. H.
Smith, J. Waite, George Kroetz and \V. H.
11. Haley. They started from Ninth and
Market streets and were soon off down tue
San Bruno road.
At the same moment F. M. Byrne and
B. D. Blnkeslee of the Imperial Cycling
Club left Van Ness avenue and Turk street,
paced by tandems.
Blakeslee recently rode from New York
to this point in record-breaking time, and
Byrne is a celebrated coast racer. Then
from Folsom and Twenty-second streets
the California Cycling Club started Messrs.
Musser, Boyle, Nason, Hansen, Bellman,
Boyd, Wiiiiams, Van Dyne, Seipert, Reid,
Griffiths and Mayer on the same ride, and
they were soon all together on the bay
road.
Blakeslee was the lirst to arrive in San
. NEW TO-DAY.

Jose, reaching there at 3:50 a. m. yester- I
day. Byrne was twenty minutes behind j
him, and the Olympics, who stayed to- I
gether and assisted in making their own
pace, arrived at 5 o'clock, a very creditable
ride.
The Californias, though separated in
some instances by miles from each other,
also got through by 5 o'clock.
Biakeslee was the first to leave San Jose
and got onto the wrong road. He found
his way again shortly, but his wheel broke
down at Irrington and he gave up the
ride. Byrne came shortly after him, and
his wheel also collapsed, but he got an
other from a man named Lyons, a club
mate, and came through to Oakland, paced
by the Rica brothers on a tandem, in
about seven hours, actual time.
George Tantau of the Olympic contin
gent arrived within ten hours, and the rest
of the Olympic party finished at Four
teenth and Webster streets, Oakland,
within thirteen hours, a tired, dusty,
hungry but well-satisfied party, for they
made the best rule of tlie day, being un
paced by any tandems and relying solely
upon their own individual efforts.
The California Club men came strag
gling in all the afternoon, but all com
pleted the trip. Reid and Mayer, on a
tandem, made the trip in ten and a half
hours.
The Garden City Cyclers rode from San
Jose to Alvarado, then to Gilroy and back
to San Jose on their century ride, but it
could not be learned last night what time
they made.
There is considerable rivalry among the
club men as to who shall ride the first
"century" each year. Frank M. Byrne
takes the honor this year for an individ
ual, while the Olympic Club wheelmen get
the credit of the best performance as a
club.
The San Francisco Road Club held a
most enjoyable entertainment at its club
rooms on Golden Gate avenue last oven
ing. It was "ladies' night" with them
and the rooms were tastefully decorated,
while music and dancing served to make
the evening pass very enjoyablv.
The park was filled with wheelmen all
day yesterday, and it was pronounced one
of the best days for riding that we have
ever had at this season of the year or any
other. The air was balmy, the roads good
and tbe sun was just warm enough to be
agreeable. Altogether it was a charming
California winter's day.
DURRANT'S NEW YEAR.
The Prisoner Not Taken to San Quentin
aii "Was Expected.
Theodore Durrant, the convicted mur
derer of Blanche Lamont, received many
New Year calls from old friends and
acquaintances at the County Jail yester
day. His parents came with their hearts
tilled with greetings and good cheer. Dur
rant was in an apparently happy frame of
mind.
Durrant was to have been removed to
San Quentin yesterday, but Judge Mur
phy granted a stay of twenty days more.
The prisoner retains his old- time indiffer
ence.

Utn la entertaining, but ; not verj assaring.
Hcisrither the vicegerent ol God oh earth or
he is the headofthe vai fabric of Catholicism,
doing the best ho can to keep its banner afloat
in all lands. Under this latter proposition we
feel bound to say that he has -.done amazingly
well. We would" not like to rn-anage his crowd.
Bui as a supreme ruler of this part pi the uni
verse we feel equally bound to sayâ though
with deep reeretâ that his success has not been
quite bo marked.
The Bible is either the inspired word <>f God
or the plain record oi the earlyand Jewish
church.
The church has either made mistakes or It
hasjiot. li it has, the burning and torturing
of heretics was a villainous crime; if not.it
was right, and the same church would doit
again it it hnd the power. . â¢
The best way to reason down a senseless an
tipathy is to use plain open truth in a plain
open way. The American â¢ people are long
suffering, but they can't be gulled long at one
time.
If the Roman Catholic church desires to free
ftse.lf from the suspicion tjjat its Jesuits are a
dexterous, perfidious band of holy- foxes, glist
ening with subtlety, bound together by oaths
black with treason, cursing and anathematiz
ing nil who dare to think the thoughts of God
for themselves, let her come out of her hiding
and say in a fair open way that other good
people are as good as she is.
Then there is the position of the attitude of
the priesthood toward the law.
Another fundamental reason for suspicion
now lying at the door of the Catholic church
in America is the anomalous attitude of the
priesthood toward the law of the land. Are
they under or above the law? If a priest were
asked by a court of Justice concerning n matter
of importanco to the state about which he
knew all the particulars through the confes
*ional box, would he answer, the questions?
[fit be snid thai he is under a iiriestly oath,
then plain people must infer that his oath,
whatever else it might be, is abeve the law.
Other ministers make no such claim, nor would
they dare to do so*! the peril oi their stand

If a person should confess ton priest thai he

the criminal, how, then, ea-n the Catholic

Now note three- things which place the
priest under picion: (1) lie refuses to in
lorm the officers, [%) He refuses to testify. f3)

! suppose there must be some way to clear up
this whole matter, but the difficulty is that the

amount to nothing when justice cries out un

Ido not at this time question the validity of
the priest's pardoning actâ which to Protes
tants seems absurd enough~-I simply call nt
teution to the fact that the pries) assumes to
operate a secret cede of morals, and brings
upon, him the curse of self-respecting society
initiated into his ways of doing things.
&eok. :.t one more aspect of theep.se: If a
knew thr&ugh the confessional box that
a msn about to suffer capital punishment was
really innocent, would hisoatb permit him to

II it be saM thnt he occupies the t-arne lepral
ground that is claimed by a prisoner who in
formally pleads "not guilty" and is excused
from testifying in his own case, rhe answer is
twofold: First, the priest is not a. prisoner;
and oond, other men are compelled by courts
to tell what they have confidentially heard
aboal crimes. The laws of this country do not
recognize the secret code of the confessional
for the simple and sufllcrent reason that no
body knows what it is. We suspect- that it va
xies with the moral ideas' of the priest.
These things are mentioned not in reproach,
but to point OUI clearly the reason Catholicism
is under suspicion in America. â ;

REORGANIZING THE FORCE
Policemen Are Agitated Over
the Weeding Out of Lazy
Patrolmen.
Proposed Retirements of Old Men on
Pensions Are Also Causing
Discussion.
The question of which policemen shall
be relegated to the pension list at the next
session Â«>f the Tension Commission Mon
day next is being eagerly discussed by
patrolmen. It has also afforded a topic
for conversation among those members of
the department who know they have no
reason to fear retirement under this head.
The main cause for uneasiness through
out the oliier members of the force is the
I new activity of sergeants in watching
patrols ali over the city. Xor is the an*
pleasant feeling confined to the men
| eligible for retirement as pensioners, for it
â  is now fully understood by patrolmen that
the sergeants are not confining espionage
to that ciass alone, but to every man on
â  duty. The reason given for such unpre
: cedented watchfulness is that a careful es
timate of the patrolmen is being made by
i the sergeants with a view to ascertaining
I who are the indifferent or lazy officers â
part of the new programme to reorganize
,tli e poiice force of Ban Francisco and to
place It on a most efficient footing.
It has been given out that the lazy of
ficers, the patrolmen who did not appear
to participate actively in carrying out
rules of the department, and also those
who through indifference, or for other mo
tives, permitted lawa to be broken on their
respective beats, or still others who failed
to patrol beats conscientiously and with
i an alert eye for thieves, burglars, etc., are
t o be dropped from the roll.
So with this prospect the patrolmen feel
that they are now undergoing a crucial
test and wondering who may come out of
the trial victorious. They know well that
I the object is to cut off a large number of
the : easy-going fellows who have been
drawing money (mm the treasury without
giving ample returns. Vet they have com
plaints to make, charging that the ser
geants are perhaps over-exacting.
Another case is that of two patrolmen
on liar bar v Coast. Their beats converge
at a certain point, and a few days ego
they were con) paring notes when the new
sergeant suddenly appeared in front of
them. lie reported Uiem for violating
I the rules of the department by loitering
;on their I oats. There aro >o many
thieves, Pickpockets and had people; genV,
j erally on the Barbary Coast that it has
| always been the custom for the policemen
to compare notes as to who had been seeri^
on tluir beats. ; :
There are other cases of similar nature,.:
and the effect has been to strike terror to '
the hearts of : tlie men and convpel theija
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1806.
to make it their first duty to watch for
the sergeant's appearance.
In one case recently a new sergeant
jumped on a car and rode to a certain
point, returning on foot, and when he met
the oflicer he accused him of bein^ off his
beat, as he had not seen him while walk
ing in the other direction. The oflicer
strenuously denied being off his beat and
the sergeant threatened to report him.
The sersreant did not tell him that he had
been on a car and not on foot. ,
"I don't know what things are coming
to." ?;iid an old patrolman yesterday.
â¢Time was when men had something else
to do than dodge the sergeant or keep a
constant lookout for him, and they had a
chance to watch suspicions characters at
night. I remember, and it is not so long
a^ either, that if I knew a thief was in a
certain place not far from my beat and 1
went after him and arrested him the ser
geant would compliment me for it. Now
a man dare not leave his hoat.no matter
what may be going on in its vicinity,
otherwise he would be hauled up before
the commissioners.
NEW YEAR'S COURSING.
Dashaway Won the ITnnnlfÂ»he<l Old
Dog Slake at Ocean View
Yesterday.
Old Dashaway came to the front again
yesterday by winning the old-dog stake
carried over from Sunday last sft Casserly
and Kerrigan's Ocean View Coursing Park.
In sjiite of his years and almost constant
training in which lie is kept, the big
brindle hound seems to have lost none of
his speed, and Flashlight and White Cloud
were easy marks for him in the tinal and
pemi-tinal runs. Considering the counter
attractions, the crowd was large and those

who attended saw the "jacks' 1 run as they
never ran before. Eight out of twenty-four
rabbits escaped, after showing the dogs all
the way about the field, 3nd the sport was
high class throughout. The unfinished
sta ke was first taken up and the conclud

Thiro tie*â Dashaway beat Flashlight, White

Finalâ Dashaway beat White Cloud.
A disappointed speculator who had
backed Flashlight against Dashaway
thought that the former had lost through
a fluke and induced the owner of Dash
away to allow a match race between the
two to be run. Dashaway won again,
Flashlight not scoring a point.
The additional sixtee'n-dog stake re
sulted in a win for Dublin Stout, a dog
that was purchased by his present owner,
D. Tweeaie, not a great while ago for |5.
This is his third winning, his prizes aggre

big stake at Newark Park yesterday, after
a hard run with Bam T. Coxe'a game

EISTEDDFOD LEVYDIANNUS.
A Musical Festival Reviving
Memories of a Romantic
Land.
OAKLAND WINS A PRIZE.
S. Jones Declared the Granvillefab.
Success of the Tuneful
Exercises.
The musicians and the orators, the sweet
singers and the literati of the \Velsh colony
of California assembled in great force yes
terday in Union-square Hall to celebrate
their Eisteddfod.
In all the annals of California there had
only been one eisteddfod held here before.
The festival held yesterday was an echo,
and a very successful echo, too, of the
great eisteddfods in Wales, where, accord
ing to the old doggerel â
There are thirty thousand Jennie Joneses
And fifty thousand Owen Owenses,
All sniping in their native tongues,
All over the green.
There were not the great multitudes yes
terday that meet in the old country, but
the smaller multitude was fully as enthu
astic in proportion to its size, and the
artistic spirit that has made the Welsh
eisteddfods such a stimulus Lo literary and
musical endeavor was well to the front,
too.
The prosident of the afternoon session
was Professor Price. He cheerfully an
nounced in his opening remarks tne presi
dent of an eisteddfod is nothing but a
figurehead, as the performers are there to
perform, and not to find the president for
getting himself by delivering addresses.
This being the case, he merely made the
announcement that the eisteddfod is "a
very ancient institution. I believe tradi
tion shows the first was held in the Gar
den of Eden. The eisteddfod has proved
a great blessing to Wales. When the
Saxons and the Danes had driven oai
people into the fastnesses of the moun
tains, they used to assemble for the eis
teddfods, just as you have assembled here,
with this difference, that they always had
twenty to thirty harps."
After the address the assembly settled
down to business, under theconduetarship
of Hu. Tones. In the singing competitions
J. C. Hughes and W. H. Holt were the
judges, and they had hard work in decid
ing between all the talent that came up to
them for adjudication.
In the solo singing competition for chil
dren under 15 years of age two little girls
were singled out for first and second prizes;
one sang perfectly true, though she usea
her nose as a means of production more
than a singer should, so said the judees.
The other little girl sang sweetly, though
rather spasmodically, but her voice was
true, too. After wrestling with the deci
sion the judges gave the first prize to little
Sadie Mendelssohn and the second to
Maggie Jones.
Two children's choruses competed, one
from the City and one from Oakland.
Both were pronounced to be good and
both had fervidly admiring followings
in the audience. Oakland captured the
prize because, to quote the judged, "the
rhythm was better marked and the parts
were better balance.!." This decision
aroused delighted applause from the Oak
land contingent, in the midst ot which Hu
Jones pinned a beautiful green and yellow
badge on to Mis 3 Annie Jones, the conduc
tor of the successful chorus.
The honor of being declared the gran
villefab was captured by S. Jones. This
was equivalent to being "declared the poet
laureate of the festival and was consid
ered one of the greatest distinctions in the
power of the eisteddfod to bestow. Mr.
Jones won his honors by making the best
translation of a Welsh hymn. U. R. Grif
fith was the adjudicator. Rev. B, V.
Griffith judged an essay on the inspira
tion of the Bible, the first prize for which
was won by H. H. Jones of Oakland, the
second being divided by R. Davis and T.
Edwards, as their mark was of equal
merit. : '
In the reciting composition for children
under 10 years of age, adjudicated by Pro
fessor Lloyd, Lizzie Hughes and Gladys
Jones won the first and second prizes re
spectively. Mr?. Anna Williams of Oak
land won the first prize for needlework,
judged by Miss R. V. Griffith and Mrs. O.
Jones. The same ladies awarded the prize
for the best-dressed Welsh doll to Mrs. Cap
tain Price, and the prize for the best knitted
stocking to Mrs. W. S. Jones of Oakland.
For the best-drawn map of Wales Princi
cipal Rowlands awarded the rmzesto Ollie
Jones and Mabel Williams.
Rev. AY. D. Williams awarded the prizes
for an essay on "What Has Christianity
Done for Women?' to Miss L. Jones and
Miss Edwards and the prizes for the best
essay on "Daniel" were awarded by Rev.
Moses Williams to Jennie Russell and
Joseph Williams.
The evening competitions were very ex
citing in character as most of the singers
and other competitors were adults, and
everyone in the crowded hail seemed to
take a personal interest in the whole pro
credings. Congressman K. S. Thomas was
the president and his opening address, on
the festival, was applauded to the echo.
Dr. Jones was the leader of the evening.
The vocal solo competition for adults
stirred up great enthusiasm. There were
seven singers who tri: d for the prize, the
adjudicators being the same as in the after
noon. Several of the vocalists distin
guished themselves, and Miss Florence
Raymond being declared the best, partly
on account of her good phrasing, the prize
was awarded to her. The song sÂ»he sang
was "Asthore." In the competition for
reciting, open to boys and girls under 15
years of age, prizes were awarded to Annie
Edwards, Annie Jones and Phoebe Jones.
John Williams and "William Williams
were given the prizes for duet singing, as
their intonation and expression were pro
nounced better than those of the four other
competitors.
Professor Lloyd, the adjudicator of a
composition in the Welsh language on
"Paul at Athens," spoKe in the highest
terms of the work sent in, and he pro
nounced the successful work a very mas
terly essay. When the pen-name of this
writer was read aloud it was with great
satisfaction that the audience and the
judge found him to be .the genial secretary
Of the Eisteddfod, H. J. Lloyd. All the
literary competitions were conducted in
this anonymous way, and sometimes there
was overwhelming applause when the
owners of the pen-names were discovered
to be popular members of the community.
In response to a call for addresses by the
bards D. Grille read a poem in Welsh,
wishing the Eisteddfod luck. John James
also read several stanzas which were much
relished, but no bard was found bold
enough to come forth and improvise, as
the poets do at the Eisteddfods in Wales.
Professor Stevens of Â£alt Lake, being
called upon tor an extempore address,
spoke of "Music" and Low much the
Eisteddfods foster that art. He also an
nounced that he intended shortly to bring
to S.Mn FranHsco some oi the Welsh sing
ers who had performed at the World's
Fair.
The great competition of the day was
the choral one. It had been observed all
through the exercises that the great Jones
tribe of Oakland seemed to be bearing off
most of the spoils, and every one realized
tha: the ereat tug-of-war would come
w::en the Oakland and San Francisco adult
choruses competed. Each city had raise
an excellent choral society especially for
the Eisteddfad. The Oaklanders had pre
pared "The Last Rose" in Welsh and the
Ban Francisco singers had mastered the
same chorus in Knglish, and there was in
tense interest to see which choir would win
the prize of $30.
While the. singers were consulting as to
which should enter the arena first the an
nouncement was made that Robert Hughes
and Robert Davis had been awarded the
prizes for an essay on "The Beautiful and
Useful in Nature."
After mature deliberation the San Fran
cisco contingent sang first. Oakland fol
lowed and the judges announced that
though the reach of both was good, the
San Francisco altos, were not, always quite
true, and the expression of Oakland was
the best; therefore the ,-irize went across
the bay. For a few moments after tne
announcement it seemed a9)f the building
would be knocked down by the applause,
it was so tumultuous.
The rest of the proceedings consisted of
votes of thanks to the president, the
judges, singers and the ladies who had
prepared the tea. ..
The prizes ranced from 50 cents to $30,
according to the artistic value of the com
petition. In a number of cases the judges
refused to award any prizes, when the
work was not up to the standard. On this
account there were no awards for quar
tet singing, letter -Jwriting, etc. This
seventy only added to the interest of the
proceedings. The Eisteddfod was an
nounced a thoroughly artistic as well as a
financial success.
A NOTED TRAVELER.
! Dr. Maxime Schumann, the Belgian
Naturalist, Here on His Way
to Southern Asia.
Dr. Maxime Schumann, the noted Bel
i gian naturalist and traveler, is in the City,
I having just returned from a trip through
I Mexico and Arizona. His journeyings
! have extended through Central Africa,
I South and North America, also Central
| Europe. While in Arizona a few months
j ago he was reported killed by the Apaches
! and the news was telegraphed to the Bel
i gian Government, in whose employ he
j was at the time.
On the 9th of this month Dr. Schumann
j will start for an extended trip through
j Southern Asia, possibly in the interest of
i the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,
with directions to examine closely among
â  other t .ings the mineral wealth of those
i countries.
"I was in Venezuela for several months,"
j said he, "and had an opportunity to note
: the natural limitless wealth of that region.
I I know something of the grasping, avari
! cious disposition of the English, and
I have had many needless diffi
culties thrown in " my path by
British explorers and officials. Conse
quently I do not like them as a whole, but
! 1 have my doubts about the correctness of
I the position taken by the United States
â  upon the Venezuela question. The Mon-
I roe doctrine is correct as a principle, but
j its application in this case is, in my opin
j ion, not clear. I cannot now go into de-
I tails, bat from what I know I feel that the
) President's Arbitration Commission will
I find much difficulty in demonstrating that
the British are not interlopers in that

A BLOCKADE OF FREIGHT
The Pacific Mail Unable to
Handle Central American
Business.
SOME PECULIAR CHARGES MADE.
Shippers Who Have Opposed the Rail
road Complain of Unfair
Treatment.
According to a statement of R. P.
Schwenn, general manager of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, recently pub
lished in these columns, his company was
in position to handle promptly all the busi
ness that might he offered for the points to
and between which the steamers of the
company ply, despite the recent with
drawal of the Panama Railroad Company
from the Southern Pacitic Panama route.
Only one of the steamers of the latter
company has been withdrawn up to date,
yet judging from the complaints of some
of the most prominent shippers to Central
American points the facilities of the Pa
cific Mail are inadequate, and have been so
for several months past, owing to the re
vival of trade with that portion of the con
tinent.
Not a Pacific Mail steamer that has left
for Panama for months but has had to re
fuse freight, and this state of affairs has
been used, so it is positively asserted, to
unfairly discriminate against those who
were most actively engaged iv encourag
ing the establishment of the rival lines.
One of the methods was to refuse on one
ground or another a permit to ship to such
firms as had openly opposed the Pacitic
Mail in the past. The experience related
by the member of one firm will suffice to
indicate the general plan adopted of get
ting even with merchants who showed too
great a disposition to improve their con
dition. This was his story:
Before goods can be shipped aboard any of
the Pacific Mail steamers application for space
must be made to Mr. fepencer. We have made
application for space long before other houses
and have been refused. These other houses
came aftor us as much as a day or two and got
all the space they wanted. This has occurred
repeatedly.
\Ve eau only draw our conclusions. They
are trying to vent their spite upon us. We
have always been opposed to the Southern Pa
cific and aided largely in bringing about the
competition by the isthmus route which
forced rates down, and the Pacitic Mail find
the Southern Pacitic are, of course, one thing.
We have frequently had to secure permits
through other firms.
Another tiling: which shows how they try
to get "all the traffic will bear" even from'their
best patrons is the way they treat {.'avengers in
reference to baggage. A certain amount is al
lowed free, but not iv single article is allowed
to be taken aboard by ft p"sstnger without be
ing weighed ana charged for if found in excess
of the free limit. An attache of one of their
heaviest shippers had occasion recently to take
a trip to Central America and started to board
the steamer ivfth a little hand-satchel in his
hand. This was takon from him as he was
about to ascend the gangplank and he was
forced to pay excess baggage rates on it at the
rate of 3 cents a pound, despite the protests of
a member of the'firm which employed him.
This would be excusable if the company
were not simply cotui:ig money on this route.
It has been calculated by a gentleman familiar
with the traffic thai the company clears $80,000
on each round trip of each vessel whenever
they carry a full cargo, and for a long time
past every steamer that left here has beeu
loaded to the hatches and freicht refused, and
the round trip takes but a little over a month.
Their talk about having ample facilities to
handle tne freight from this end is simply ab
suid. They have uot be-en able to do itwith
the Panama company's steamers in the field;
how can they expect to do it now without very
largely increasing their facilities, nnd this
they have not yet done. Why, it was not
much more than a month ago that the com
mission firm of Schwartz & Cn. was compelled
to charter & steamer for Guatemala owing to
the inability of the Pacific Mail to take proper
care of their business.
At the office of Schwartz & Co. it was
learned that the 1500-ton steamer Jeanie â 
was rilled by them and a ftÂ«w other ship- j
pers and dispatched for San Jose de Gtiate- j
mala on the 17th of November last. She is j
due to return, and it is possible may be \
again sent on the same trip.

I and when I went after another bott'e" he
informed me that the sale was amply sur-

free from rheumatic pains which made ray
life a burden for so many years. lam not
only free from pain, but I can also state
truthfully that my general health is much â¢
j improved by the treatment. Its action on
the kidneys, in my case, was extremely
gratifying, especially as I hail suffered to
such an extent from this cause in addition â

taheld. Tlic labors u(" the dnb
been practically turned over I
conunittee as nearly every member of the
executive body of the former is an active
worker for the general advancement of the
State in the latter.
At the Development Committee meeting
the resolution passed by the Half-million
Club winding up its business was read.
IUvM Rich remarked that while the club
had i lie out at active existence its memb
ership roil will be kept alive and if the
occasion ever demands the club will reor
ganize again. H> suggested that the use
of the State Development rooms be offered
to the Half-milikn Club whenever the
members of the latter desired to meet. In
making the suggestion, which was agreed
to. M: Kich remarked :
W'h. â  it was found that owing to the name
â¢'HalfrinillionCiub," and some teeling which
Ftili (.-oiitinued to exist notwithstanding the ;
chartg&in-sentisient produced by the excursion
through the State, thut It would l>a impossible
. lorthrtt. organization to do tbe greatest amount
of c^Oit, the Slate Development Committee de
cide.', to take up" so mvi oi the work that had
beru outline^} asporteined to the general devel
cpnieut oi ibe State. This it has done with a
ranrkea degree oi success. Â« inch is evidenced
by. the iact that never Jin 'â â <â¢ history of the
State n&s it been so thoroughly organized lor
aggressive work. along development lines, nor
has tht-rb been : at hiv time within the past
,<i?cada;>uclÂ» unanimnV "i feeling displayed
: between the van<> }>ortibns of the State. This
"commiuee now; hk> presentatlves -in every
â county md one bi \he strongest working execu
tive -committees; 'â ''â  ).:'.:
.It is a recognized. fact that no like amount of
jiracticalwork has ever been done by any pub
lic committee in 50 short a time and with so
: small an expenditure of moi.i'y as has been
accomplished during the ast three mouths by
the State iJevSlqfptnent Committee. The grati
tudtv ot-.-.the e-ritire State is due to the Half
million Club for having originated and so suc-i
â¢ cessfuliy carried out the excursion through
the Sts;e which aas rendered the work of this
COQus possible, and although the child
has outgrown the parent it will never cease to ;
entertain a tilial affection tor its progenitor. ;
: At. the .ast meeting of the committee it
was. decided to increase the number of that
body from fifteen, ana select three promi
nent . tive workers in each county who will
co-operate for the general good of the
State.. Alameda and Los ; Angeles, how
ever, will have tive instead of three.: and

A Runaway Accident Without Ser

All the town was not occupied in calling
and entertaining yesterday, for the delight
fully soft air of Golden Gate Park was en
joyed by many thousands 01 people, It
was a calm dayâ almost dreamy among
the trees and qaiet walks, although the
atmosphere had a touch of crispness in it
that brought blushes to cheeks and stim
ulated visitors to the pleasure resort, to
take long and delightful tramps. In the
broad sunshine a genial warmth rested
everywhere like a benediction upon the
people on New Year's day.

SYMPATHY FOR THE BOY.
Arnold Meyers Arrested on a
Warrant for Battery Upon
Bis Uncle.
Judge Low, After Learning His Story,
Releases Him Upon His Own
Recognizance.
Arnold Meyers, a bright boy 15 years of
age, who is empJoyed in the telephone
office on Sutter street, was arrested yester
day on a warrant from Judge Campbell's
court charging him with battery. The
warrant was placed in the hands of Police
man James Callinan, and the boyieJt co
humiliated and so wretched over His ar
rest on 2s ew Year's day, when he Nvas ex
pecting to make a few dollars extra, that
Callinan took him before Sergeant Hough
taling. ! â¢ â  : '
The boy told the sergeant that lie lived
with his mother at 5 Monroe street, off
Busty. His father died some years ago.
His mother is a mute, and so is bis uncle
on his mother's side, Martin Ansohn, 915
butter street, who is the complaining wit
ness against him. ;.
A short time ago his uncle got him to
sign a paper to appoint him as bis guar
dian. Previous to that his uncle nad al
ways treated him kindly, but aa soon as
he had sighed the paper appointing him
guardian he commenced to treat him quite
differently. He took every occasion to
beat and kick him without tbe slightest
cause. He would come into his bedroom
on cold nights, open the window and pull
the clothes off the bed and take them
away. :
On Monday liis uncle was beating and
kicking him as us-ual when he thought it
was about lime that he began to assert his
manlK)od and a'thou-ib. he is a delicate boy
he struck back at his uncle and that was
why he had been arrested.
Sergeant HoUKhtaling was so impressed
with the boy's st..ry that he determined he
should not nave his New Year's enjoyment
spoiled if he could help it. The warrant
called tor $250 cash bailor $500 bonds
and as the boy had no chance of getting
either the sergeant Utni Policeman Culli
nau with a note explaining the boy's posi
tion and asking the Judge to send an order

OLD MONTEREY.
Glories of the Auclent Capital May Be
Restored by Famous
Astists.
gome of the glories of Monterey, the
ancient capital of California, may be re
stored and the restoration may be brought
about by the painters. In every place on
the globe wherie art studios are maintained
the artists talk of Monterey and its views
of mountain and sea. The rugged shore
at Cypress Point, the weird forest, the
moonlight in the fog and spray, present
scenes that strike the fancy of trie artist.
Bret Harte and Gertrude Atherton have
made readers of tpe United States and
England Jamiliar with life at J^onterey
When the King of Spain was ruler of the
land. Jules i'avernier, Julian Ri*, Joseph
D. Strong, Denny, Raschen, Virgil
Williams and others loved to paint at the
old capital. Robert Louis Stevenson en
oyed life there, and many other writers
have found in the place material for stories
and sketches. ;
Now Charles Rollo Peters, who has been
travelling in Europe for three years, has
leased an old-fashioned adobe house and
with tapestries, rugs and odd things
collected in his travels will convert the
place into a studio. Next summer he will

the leading marine, painters of the day.

that several causes operatynl to prevent such

UNITED IN GOOD CHEER
The Young Men's Christian : Asso
".. â  ; ciation Is in Excellent
Spirits.
YESTERDAY'S . BKr' RECEPTION.
A Grand â¢ Programme Was Rendered
. . and Secretary McCoy .Looks T&:^-'^
/"'.' \\. : : ward a Bright Future, 'yjij.^i:'.
â¢ The. beginning of â  year â¢ -was:.
pleasant .for, the members Young
Men's Cliristian Association of.'-Sah'-Eranr';
cisco,: mainly - because" the magnificent
building occupied by the .organization..bir
the corner of Mason and . Ejli* ; is. almost;
paid for, and incidentally; because the
membership -rapidly, increasing all over
tne world as well as here at home. "'-.â >â¢' ' â¢
Yesterday the doors of , the magnificent
structure werethrowh open to the public
and the entire institution was inspected
from top to bottom. â¢ '.'â '. [â â â â .;
"What the association has done for itself
and the young men who are members is
best set forth in the following invitation
sent:
. My Dear Friend: As we near the close of the
old year and stand at the threshold of the new
tliere are many things that must Interest us,
a.iid I have been thinking what we can do as an
association to help others. . . â¢ â¢
! .The Young Men's Christian Association ha 3
become a powerful factor for good in all lands,
ajn'd its growth- and development during the
past fÂ«Â«w years? in our City-has been phenome
nal. We own and occupy one of tho best
equipped association uuildiugs in the world,
ivith every facility for reaching vounc men
socially, intellectually, morally, "spiritually
nn<l pnysically; and/it would bcem that the
only thing. wo need to make it aprreater power
and blessing to young men in general would
be the. personal interest, and, no jar as practic
.able, -'the active co-operation of every member.
" We ought to have at 'least 2000 members, and
with the help of our present large membership
the'desired result could, and I believe should;
be accomplished duriniÂ» the year 1890." The
ticld is ample; the Institution in its nome and
arrungemehts is second to none in the world,
nnd young men have only to be familiarized
with' the benefits accruing to members in or
der-to be induced to identify themselves with
us. We know no creeds or dogmas: any young
man w.lio respects himself and desires to make
the most of life and his opportunitiesâ or, in
oilier words, if he is a man â will find a wel
come with us. 1 hand you herewith a booklet
giving full particulars of the work; also a
membership application card. Will you not,"
.with others, secure at least one new member
at once?
The outline programme for New Year's,
Wednesday, January i, 1890, is herewith ap
pended. We anticipate an enjoyable time and
trust you will find it convenient to visit the
building during the day. You will be at lib
erty to invite your young' gentlemen or lady
friends to accompany, you.
â¢Wishing you the compliments of the season,
and earnestly soliciting your interest in this
work for the coming year, I remain, very sin
cerely. â  yours, . .â  -- â â â¢.â ;.â ,:â â :/â 
H. J. McCoy, General Secretary..
This invitation had the effect of bringing
out a crowd of interested workers in the
cause of a union of Christianity, and the
day was spent in congratulations that the
old year had passed with so little distress
and that the new year gave promise of so
much; for those who had lived to see it
come ont of. the storehouse of time to per
form its duty in the circle of aces and then
pass away to join the departed.years in the
tomb : of the past, . where many pleasant
recollections .were resting with the dead..
Between the hours of 1 and ;5 music
by the Knickerbocker Quartet. rea'difiÃs by
Miss Fisher and duets by the Misses â 
Graham were the order, and the big recep
tion-room on the third floor was .filled with
ladies -and gentlemen who are faithful to
the association". - . â¢ . . â¢ . â¢

i barytone solo by D. M. Warde were par
ticularly tine and both gentlemen were in
''excellent voice. I >. Ke^ensburser's cello
solo elicited an encore, and the other par
ticipants received considerable applause.
A great many new applications for mem-
Iberenip resivlted from yesterday's recepÂ»
tiou, and those who had not attended
before expressed surprise at the extent of
the work and the depth of sincerity. Sec
retary McCoy stated that he was encour
aged "by the fact that over $70,000 bad been
I raised to pay off the.debt of $100,000, and
; that the association hoped to be free from
all financial incumbrance within a few
months. ___^________

The Diana, recently launched at Glas
gow, is one of lour cruisers of 5000 tons, or
about as big as our Oiyrnpja, building on
the Clyde. The others are the Venus,
Dido and Isis. There are two more of the
same class, the Juno and Don?, building
at Harrow; stili another, the Eclipse, at
Portsmouth-; an eighth, the Minerva, at
Chatham/and a ninth, the Talbot, at Dev
onport. The last three are at Government
yards, which are thus vying with private
establishments in hurrying forward the
additions to the Meet.
IStill larger and newer cruisers are the j
Diumond, Enropia, Niobe and Andromeda,
building at Civdebank, at rlarrow-in-Fnr
ness, and at Pembroke. They are to be !
longer and brooder than our Colombia
and Minneapolis, and to be far more ;
heavily armed, the main battery beiqg
fifteen qulcfc-tiring six-inch gans, and they ;
are to have 20,000 horsepower under forced i
draft. These in turn are to-be outdone in I
size by t lie cruisers Powerful und Terrible. I
now building, of 14,200 tons and 25,000 j
horsepower^ so that the new Fox and
Flora, of 4360 tons ami 9000 horsepower,
about like our Philadelphia, look small by
contrast.
England is plainly hot neglecting her
cruiser type merely "because she is build
ing ten big battle-shij>s and scores of fast
torpedo craft.â New \ ork Sun.

â¢ . 908 Broadway,. Jan. 1. f i
If anybody went hungry in Oakland toÂ«
Jay it was not the fault of the Salvation
Army. From noon till late this afternoon
the old barracks on Eighth ptreet re
ceived the most pitiable lot of guests that
have Deen gathered together since last
New Year's day.
Tables were built wherever room could
be found and the large floor of the hall
was ihe busiest part of the city for several
hours. For two weeks the Army people
have been preparing for the New Year's
dinner and during the past four days ihe
tin buses exhibited In various partsof
town have been freely patronized. Con
trary to the custom of former years the
people seemed more willing to give money
than donations of goods.
As soon as the doors opened a crowd
was ready to sit down. It would have
been sarcasm to have sj.oken to them of a
"happy' New Year, for. judging- by their
looks, they knew but little of the elements
of happiness. Hut they were a!l hungry
and were anxious to be filled, and that waa
all the demand for admission required.
The scene inside was a very busy one.
Dozens of bonnetted lassie? and men in
red (luernsey? t!ew around and waited on
aeÃta.
The outside air was cold and the appe
tizing steam rising from scores of hot
: dishes looked especially attractive. One
| of tne most thoughtful acts of the Salva
;.-, *nd one which won the adiuirn
uon ci the whole Police Department! mi
! Â king after the "lodgers" whom abject
poverty drives to the City Hall each night.
A lieutenant called at tha prison at mid
night, asked the number of lodgers and
left a card of invitation to each to come to
the free dinner at noon.
"That's wnat I call religion," said Cap
tain Fletcher, "and it's the first time I
ever saw anybody who cared ..bout our
poor lodgers. " There were about fifty at
the prison last nicht and they all were
<_".iest? of the lads and lassies at the New
Year'? dinner.
About 400 people partook of the free
meal, but this number does not represent
all that was done. Many families were
Ack and others were too proud to be seen
at the army tables. But they all had to
be provided with a dinner and many er
rands of mercy were made by the cadets
with well-filled baskets. Ensisn Reed
found that the contributions fell some
what short of the necessary outlay, so
theie is still a chance to help."

to be made have attracted a swarm of elec
tric-light men, foundrymen, boiler-makers
and contractors. It â¢is estimated by the
City Trustees that the improvements to be
made will cost $15,000, but judging from
past experiences those who are keepinej
any account of it expect the sum to reach
fully $20,000. The electrician claims that
with the new works the city, will be en
abled to sell incandescent light enough to
pay all expenses of operation and â¢ have a
nice surplus besides.

Insuring the New City Hull.
LAMBDA, Cal., Jan. I.â The new
City Hall is to be insured. There is an
overwhelming number of applications for
insurance, at the rate of 80 cents for three
years, and the Municipal Board has de
cided to place $25,000. to be/divided be
tween a larce number of companies. The
building is more nearly fireproof than such
public structures generally are. and there
are no exposures, so that the risk is con
sidered an unusually good one, and com
mands a very low rate.

TRYING TO OUST RAWSON
George Schmidt Says the Deputy
Marshal Is Not Eligible
to Office.
The Berkeley End ;of Some Marin
County Practical Politicsâ ln*
junction Served. . . .
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. I.â George
Behmidt has* served upon Town Treasurer
Squirea an injunction to prevent him from
paying the salary of Deputy Marshal
Rawson of West Berkeley.
Mr. Schmidt claims that Rawson has not
been v resident of Berkeley for a sufficient
length of time to qualify him to hold office
in the town, the claim being based upon
section Bof article 111 of the new charter
which declares that no person shall be eli
gible to hold any office in the town unless
lie bhall be a resident and elector therein
and shall have resided within the town for
three years prior to his election or appoint
ment. . .
According to a letter received by Mr.
Schmidt from the Deputy County Clerk of
Marin County Rawson was registered in
that county on September 19, 1894, thus
becominpia citizen of Marin County. The
entry of "Rawson's name in the register of
Mann County was canceled on April 10,
1895, and in May of that year Rawson was
appointed Deputy Marshal of Berkeley by
Marshal Lloyd, who took office at that
time. j
Rawpori claims that be is a victim of a
Mann County political doal. He has been
a resident ot Berkeley for about twelve
years, but spent about ten months in
Maria County during lSÂ£Â»4-!>s.
"During my stay in Marin County my
vote was solicited for certain measures/
said Mr. Rawson, "and I made the reply
that I was a citizen of Berkeley and could
not vote in Marin County. I was told that
it would be all right, no one would know
the difference and I might as well vote
anyhow, but. I did not do so, neither did I
register. If my name appears on the
Marin County register it was placed there
by political schemers who wanted a vote,
add if any vote was cast under the name
of Rawson I did not cast it.
"I took no oatnof registration and never
in any way relinquished my citizenship in
Alarneda County. During all the time of
tny stay in Marin County my wife and
family remained in Berkeley and I was and
am a citizen of that town."
Town Treasurer Squires says he will
follow the advice of the town attorney and
trustees in the matter of the injunction
served upon him by Mr. Schmidt.
The matter will be considered on Friday
evening, when Rawson 'b salary as deputy
marshal for the month of December be
comes due.
The Building Boom.
The Berkeley Herald to-day issued a
twenty-eight page "Improvement Edi
tion," giving a review of the building and
other improvements that have been made
in Berkeley during 1895. Tue figures show
that over $325,000 has been expended on
building in Berkeley during the year just
closed, about $260,000 of that sum having
been spent on residences.

CAME FROM COLMA.
Patriotic Party That Drove to Town
With Flags Flying to Serenade
'â¢ The Call."
A patriotic party af young men came
from Colma to the City yesterday in a
vehicle that attracted general attention.
They drove six dashing horses all be
decked with evergreens and completely
filled a big wagon that was also gayly dec
prated, and it was quite evident that the
jolly fellows were having a merry celebra
tion of New Year's day behind the green
bo ughs and American flags.
Their original ideas in the way of
decorations caused these Colma boys to be
heartily cheered until their passage through
the City streets seemed like a great ova
tion. Their wagon was lined with the stara
and stripes, while along the railings on
each side were written the words, "Mon
roe doctrine." And with this enthu
siastic display of patriotism went the
music of fife arid drum, which sounded in
many a martial and NationaL air. The.
boys, too, had a yell: " 'Rah, 'rah, Colma.
First in peace, first in war. Monroe doc
trine!"
Thoy serenaded The Call at the busi
ness office and the. editorial rooms late in
the evening, when Thomas' Naylor, the
leader; said they had. left their ladies at
home and come from San Mateo County
to wish The Call a happy and prosperous
New Year. The party consisted of Wil
liam Fay. Ben Greene, James Oakes, John
Con way, Patrick McCa.be, Hugh Rodgers,
Joe Cannon, Thomas Kelly, John Rodg
ers, Thomas Nayhbr, James F. R.odge'rs,
Vasila Semanoff, Daniel Desmond, James

sider either, as.entitled to hold and conse
quently not entitled to vote. -;â¢
That the three majors were not legally
fiel'l officers of the new regiment and not
entitled to vote must also be apparent.
Under the provisions of paragraph 381, for
the. consolidation of companies and reci
mehts, if made : to apply to battalions,
ail . the field officers of these battalions
would become supernumerary, for under
section IGS2 of the Political Code the bat
talions of a regiment are not formed until
after the regiment has a designated num
ber of companiea, and tnen only "as the
commanding officer, of the regiment shall
direct."
General orders No. 18 simply organized
the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Battalions
into "one regiment, to be known as the
First Infantry" ; thus up to the time of
issuance of that order they had been
separate battalions with certain field offi
cers asigned to them for duty(vide general
erdersNo.l7),theÃe field officers serving and
holding their commissions and qualifica
tions in the old regiments and assigned to
such duty thereunder, and not under any j
new commission and qualification as re- 1
quired by the regulations. That the bat
talions to which these officers were as
signed were formerly a portion of the com
mand" in which they held commissions
maybe a coincidence; lieutenant-colonels
on the Governor's staff micht have been j
assigned, as was|done with the Naval Battal- |
ion. !';â¢.;
That they were not considered as officers
of the new regiment is shown by the clause
in general orders No 13. "The permanent
assignments of the lieutenant-colonels and
majors to duty with their respective regi
ments "will- be announced in future' or
ders."
If General Orders No. 18 organizes a new I
regiment, the field officers should be
elected by commissioned officers of the
different companies, as provided by section |
1985, and not appointed. â  The election j
must be held under the provisions of that
section, the officer detailed to preside,
among other matters, to give notice "of
the olhce to be filled." As this was not !
done, neither- Colonel O Connor . nor Cap
tain Tilden can be considered as. elected,
and as neither of them was connected with
the bodies organized or consolidated into
the, new regiment, they cannot be con
sidered as transferred officers. â¢ The entire
matter mtkes a very pretty muddle with
no early improvement, in sight. â¢' â¢
In the meantime the armory question
is still in a chaotic state. A few days ago
a meeting of captains was held under the
auspices of Captain Cunningham, the
Warwick of the old Second, to ascertain
what arrangements could be made to set
tle this matter. One of the propositions
submitted was asking for two companiea
to volunteer to remove their quarters to
the armory of the Nationals on Ellis street,
the other eight companies to be quartered
at the Page-street armory, but as none of
the companies appeared to be willing to
incur the expense of removal for the bene
fit - of the others the matter is still in
abeyance. , T.he companies of the Third
prefer, the 1 Marjcet-street armory on ac
count of locality and accommodations,
the companies of the First still, there re
fuse to locate on Ellis street and decline
to move to Page street on account ol tLe
expense of removal unless all are ordered
â¢there. â¢ . . â¢ ...
The indications are -that to settle this
matter the entire regiment will bo order d
to the Page-street armory, particularly bo
as it is the only armory where sufficient
accommodations can be furnished, the
owner of the property having expressed a
'willinjmess to -build, necessary, additions.
. ,As the regular compahy drilla will com
mence next week, company commanders
are worried over the.requiremehts of Gen
eral Orders No: 11, . directing that the
attendance' at weekly drills shall not *be
less than fifty men; riot-. knbwfhg' what
will be the result of mabill.ty to comply
therewith as it is well known Chat hut fÂ»w
companies have been able to obtain such
attendance during the past year. If. ai.
was intimated at the time that the: order
was issued, companies unabk- to com
ply therewith would be mustered out, the
chances are that there will shortly be but
one battalion in tnis City and a few un
attached companies throughout the State.

MEXICAN LAND GRANTS
How the Spanish Law Affects
Some of the Big Liti
gation.
A Bret Harte Fiction Learned to Be
Only the Record of
Truth.
Bret Harte, in one of his typical Cali
fornia novels, furnishes a graphic pen
picture of the delegation which went to
Washington, D. C, in the early fifties to
lobby the passage of a bill through Con
gress operative on the head of the Mex
ican treaty and land grants. The story
has often been recalled since then.
Lawyers who have had occasion to in
terest themselves in litigations anent the
grants held under the treaty with Mexico
have discovered that what the literary
world has regarded as fiction, or facts
focussed for fiction's purpose's, are legal
matters of record. In their turn the Span
ish-Mexican dons have learned that the
delegation of 1850 succeeded in securing
ihe passage of laws that transferred the
titleship of much valuable land from their
hands to the new-comers from Eastern
clinics.
The erudite of the legal profession are
acquainted with the story. Many have
profited by their knowledge, but the early
Spanish settlers have lost. Their knowl
edge came too late.
The recent land-title suits, involving
millions of dollars, have revived the pub
, lie interest in Spanish law and the pro
visions of tne treaty following the Mexican
war in 1847.
"Very few persons are familiar with the
provisions of that important treaty, or the
Spanish Jaw that is back of it," said a
prominent attorney yesterday.
"When the Mexican citizens came to
the Territory of California and settled
upon lands granted to them by the Gov
ernment they felt perfectly safe in making
whatever improvements they thought fit,
for they had good grounds lor believing
the title by which they held iheir ranches
to be absolutely perfect. When the Mexi
can war came they were, of course, uneasy
and did not know how long they would
hold their property.
"When, however, in 1847, the treaty of
Guadaloupe Hidalgo was ratified, they
ap.ain were reassured, and diligently set to
work to improve the holdings and till the
soil. Why did they feel so reassured?
Because that treaty guaranteed to them
the full and complete enjoyment of the
property granted to ihem by the Mexican
Government.
'â¢Was it by chance that this article was
incorporated in the treaty, or was it by
design? If by design it must have been
suggested to tue Mexican Government by
some person or persons familiar with the
condition of affairs existing in this State
at the time the treaty was proposed. It
was clearly the intention on the part of the
Mexican Government to ask, and on the
part of the United .States to grant, full,
complete and unqualified protection to the
holders of land by Mexican grant and
tcive them an absolute title thereto.
''The Mexican settlers were chiefly of an
uneducated class, many being unable to
either read or write. Their magnificent
holdings, instead of being a comfort and
pleasure to them, were a menace to their
happiness, ior among the thousands who
came from the States in the late forties
were many unscrupulous men with slip
pery tongues and well-tilled purses, who
played upon their credulity and unsophisti
cated honesty. Not satisfied with private
robbery, or robbery of one Mexican at a
time, these land-harks conceived the great
and patriotic idea that these vast tracts of
land should be taken away fr> m the Mexi
can settlers and aiven to the first person
who could secure a patent for it from the
United States Government.
"it would not do, of course, to effect a
public and wholesale robbery without at
least an apparent sanction of law, so to ac
complish their yurposes they sought to
make and succeeded In making the United
Slates Government, or rather the members
of Congress, a party to the crime. How
did they do it? They organized what
should properly be called an anti-Mexican
movement, and selected the most un-
BCrnpolooa and cold-blooded of their mem
bers as a committee to go to Washington
and lobby through a bill declaring the
lands held by Mexican grant to be public i
domain and subject to settlement and j
patent.
"This, however, was rather a bold step
to take, and Congressmen did not have
the courage to provoke another war with
Mexico by enacting such a law. They en
deavored, however, to accomplish the
same ends by attempting to cover up their
real intention, which resulted in the leg-

"When itie treaty was ratified and the
Mexican people knew their. Government
had provided i for their protection they
little dreamed that the other party to the
treaty would so basely betray tticm. Many
an old Mexican living to-lay in this State
cannot understand how it* was that the
Yankee settlers could take possession of
their property, drive them out of ; heir
homes,, seize their Rrowii crops and
make beggars of them. They cannot un
derstand how a body of lawmakers 3000
miles away could pass a- law authorizing
such a wholesale theft. : "â "
"The Spanish and Mexican resident?, as
has been evinced by the : recent suits, are
beginning to revive the old laws, and with
the assistance of able lawyers are seeking
to regain some of their former possessions.
When that law was passed the day of the
newspaper on this coast' had not arrived
and the mail coach was intermittent. In
stead of tive years, the limit prescribed by
Congress, it was ten, fifteen and twenty
years before the Bpanish and Mexican
land-owners learned that they had. to pre
sent their claims to the commission.
"By the law of 1851 each pueblo could
present its grants to ihe Land Comrn --
sioner for confirmation the same as might
an individual. Severalof the rueblo* of
California were never so presented. You
ask me why? I can only answer why
by presenting the theory that the officers
of such pueblos were interested in the suc
cessful operation of the law of 1851, and
that there were numerous squatters around
ready to do their bidding.
"The land sharks are not all dead yet.
It was only a short time ago 1 had occa
sion to Investigate the title to a large ram
in Monterey county. I found that the
grant to the land had never been pre
sented for confirmation, and consequently
not patented to the Mexican grantee."

TEIHD SUCCESSIVE TIE.
Companie 8 A and C of tlie I^oacjtie of
tlie Cross Play -and Fail
to Decide Supremacy.
Company A and Company C of the
League of the Cross played a tie game of
football, at Central Park yesterday after
noon.
Early in the game Company A went
through, its opponent' s line as easily as a
circus rider goes through a paper hoop,
but after the touchdown was scored the
wearers of the green shamrocks rallied,
and from that time on the ball was see
sawed back and forth without any close
calls on either goal until about the middle
of the second half, when Company C tied
the score with a touchdown from which,
like their rivals, they failed to kick a goal.
A muffed punt was secured by Company
C.and downed two feet from tiieir iroal,
but they managed to work out of the pre
dicament, and after numerous exchanges
time was called on Company A's twenty
yard line and in possession of Company O.
The Interestine feature of the contest is
that it was a match to decide a rivalry that
has been heightened by the ties preceding
this one. On Thanksgiving, 1894, the two
companies met at football and neither side
scored. On September 9, 1895. they met
in a lield day at Park and each
side scored 41 points.

BRIGHT MISS YANAGISAWA.
The Only Japanese Co-Ed Taking
an American Course of
Higher Culture.
Her Ambition Is to Return Home and
There Teach English to Her
Own People.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. I.â One of the
most interesting students from various
j>oints of view whose name appears on the
roils of the University of California at the
present time is Miss U. Yone Yanagisawa.
a Japanese co-ed.
She is interesting from several points of
I view, but more particularly from the fact
j that she is the only lady student of her
I race who is at the present time pursuing a
j course of sttidy in an American institution
'. of higher learning.
In a number of preparatory schools aird
; academies in California there are to be
I found other Japanese "girls who are fitting
I themselves for collegiate courses, but there
Miss U. Yonc Vanagisania, a Student at
the California University.
[From, a photograph.]
I are none who are as far advanced in the I
scale of learning as Miss Yanagisawa. '
Several years ago it was quite as uncom
mon an occurrence to see a Japanese male
student in an American university as it is
.j now a female; but they have "rapidly
i grown to be more numerous, and now there
j are twelve Japanese male students pursu
ing the various courses at Berkeley.
Almost an equal number are at Stan
ford: The graduate who received the most
enthusiastic round of applause on last I
. commencement day at Berkeley as he ap- ;
proached the president to receive his'
diploma and lieutenant's commission was
i Mapano, the first Japanese to take a
j ; degree from the University of California :
! He graduated with high honors from his
, academic course and advanced far ahead!
, of the majority of his fellows in the mili- i
j tary department, having received die of
1 thÂ° six commissions of second lieutenant
! granted on that day.
; Miss Yanagisawa entered Berkeley as a
| regular student in the College of 'Social -
Sciences last August with sonhomore
standing. Advanced ciedit was given her
j at tlie U. C. in recognition of the record ]
â  she made in the collegiate department of
the University of the Pacific, which insti
tution she entered eleven years ago, be- '
ginning with the kindergarten. Her cliild
i hood was spent in her native city, Tokio,
j Japan, but. her father having business mi
i terests in America brought his daughter
to this country thirteen years ago.
: After two years' residence hpre she be- :
gan' the study of the English language,
and, as she became more and more familiar
with it, decided to lit hers.-lf for the work
of a teacher ol English in Japan. She is I
] now studying mainly the English branches, i
taking two advanced courses in English,
two history courses and elementary work
in German.
In speaking of her work at the univer
sity and the associations she ha? formed
there, she said: "I find the greatest of I
pleasure in the pursuit of my studies at ;
; Berkeley. My favorite subject, of coarse, ''
is English, and the more I study it the
j more I like it. The language cornea natu
ral to me perhaps, because of mv coming i
to America in my early childhood and be- j
cause I. at once commenced the study of
j the language under competent teachers.
I The instructors at Berkeley are very kind
| to me and lend every assistance I "could'
j ask to make my work easy. Of course I I
i have not the vocabulary nor the ability to
express myself a 9 well as my English class
mates, and sometimes it is quite an em
barrassment to get up and recite before '
them. I have made a few very agreeable
acquaintances at the university, which, of
course, tends to make my life there a
pleasant one.
"Most of my time while at Berkeley is !
spent in the library, reading and studying. ;
"The one ambition I have is to linish :
my course so that I can return to Japan
and teach those of ftiy country who have
i not. hÂ«wi tbÂ« aiivantp.ge's of even a common
school' erttication."
Miss Yananisawa is far above the aver
age of her race from the paint of intellect
uality, and .the professors under whom she
! is takinsr work speak of her ability in the
| highesttefms. She is of . medium build,
; Jind of fi modest and unassuming nature.
I Following is a letter she has written to
I The Call,; in wliich she speaks of her
'.work at the university and tne good that
1 *he hones may result from her taking the
'â  initiative for* her kindred women in tne
I matter of pursuing a course of higher edu-
I cation in America : :
j Editor of The. Callâ Dear Sir :I am happy to
be able to respond to the request of your cor
respondent lor a few "words in regard to my
course :u the .University ol California. It is
j certainly a. very great privilege for a Japanese
! girl to pursue a course of study in. one of the
i higher institutions of learning in America.
! Alttiough (juite a stranger at school, still I
â¢ rind my \vork and earroandingl very pleasant.
The teachers and students are all" very kind
j and thoughtful.
1 am pursuing the English and history
i courses and I hope to fit myselfas an English
teacher in Japan,
I feel my inability to undertake the work
among our girls, still I certainly do hope that
by my examplejnany other ot my sisters who
are more Kitted may follow in the same line
ana be able to accomplish more good.
There are many excellent native male in
structors in English, but as yet, I understand,
there are very lew lady instructors.
As you know, Japan is a growing nation.
Her advancement in every brancn of learning
has been marvelous. She is the promising
country of the Orient, but until her daughters
are educated to stand side by side with their
brothers 1 fear she will never be able to be
ranked as one of the leading nations of the
world. But I am certain that she will not
neglect her daughters.
They, too, must be carried along with the
tide of civilization, and ere another quarter of
a century lias rolled by ive will find in Japan
one of the best civilizations that has ever been
known to the world. The field is certainly
wide ami there is .opportunity for much work,
but whether I will be able "to accomplish my
desires the future only can tell.
We Japanese have to work against many dis
advantages in order to obtain little English
education. Far away, from home, without
much goon home influence, we are obliged to
battle against circumstances- that are very
oiton discouragine.
But 1 must bring this letter to a close.
Pardnn me if I have taken too much of your
precious time. lam very truly,
U. Yone Yanagisawa.

AN OVERMAN CONFESSION.
Mrs. Thurston of Oakland Corro
borates Part of Mrs. David
son's Story.
Rev. J. H. Allen of 802 Jefferson street,
Oakland, is an evangelist of considerable
note. It-was at one of his meetings that
Miss Mattie Overman confessed conver
sion and became deeply interested in his
teachings on the second coming of Christ.
He is not at all surprised at the turn
affairs have taken, as he was warned
nearly a year ago to get away from the
women interested and avoid any chance of
becoming involved in anything that might
occur. He took the advice and is now
congratulating himself that he did. He
was seen at his home last evening and
I told the following story:
"1 conducted evangelistic services in
the Lutheran Church on Mission street,
in San Francisco. TheÃe were at
tended by a large number of people,
among them being Mrs. Davidson, Mrs.
Tunnell, Miss Overman and others. This
was in 1594. Abotit the last of the year I
had a Bible class at Mrs. Tunnell's, 132
Tenth street. Miss Overman professed
I conversion atone of the meetings at the
church, and became an attendant at the
Bible class. She appeared to be a very
happy, joyous woman after her conver
sion, and I had no reason to believe she
was not as sincere as she appeared to be.
"Matters went along for awhile, when
one day 1 was notified by a friend that
there was a suandal brewing and the best
I could do was to discontinue my Bible
Class at Mrs. Tunnell's, so that when it
broke I should not become involved in any
manner.
"I questioned the advice and then my
friend told me that Miss Overman had con.
fessed that she was in trouble. I discon
tinued the classes at once and have held
them at Holmes' Mission, 1237J4 Market
street, ever since. I will not say who the
friend w.as of what further was said by
Miss Overman, as it was told me in confi
dence.
'â¢I do not .believe it is best to tell in ad
vance the testimony that may be brought
put on a trial, as it only gives the other
side an opportunity to secure rebuttal evi
dence, even though they have to manu
facture it. If anything I know will help
either. side 1 am willing to goon the stand,
but I cannot see what help it would be to
either party.
"I can say, however, that at the close
of our mission, before Mattie Overman
went to Tacoma, she was the most happy,
joyous Christian woman I have seen, and
was very eager for Bible light on the
subject of the Lord's second coming. She
was then living at Dr. Brown's.
"In fact she. had become so imbued with
my teachings that she talked about it to
all she came in contact with, and was the
, means of interesting Dr. Brown to such an
I extent that he attended several of our.
meetings. When. l next saw her was one
day about six weeks ago; and. I remarked
to a friend that :she looked as if she had
lost all the joys of her salvation. I have
never seen tier sinceJ" 'â  :! V' '
The person who: warned Rev. .1, H. Allen
to discontinue his Bibleclass at the little.
St. Paul's Church on Mission street was
| found by a: C a i/l reporter last night. She
is Mrs. C. E. Th-UTston, at present residing
in Oakland. She and her husban.d : have
been two of the best known traveling
j oyan j|e lists in. this State! for twenty years.:
: if lie; story told by her aha her husband
contains some definite statements regard
ing points in the BrOwnj-Davidson scandal
that have hitherto been obscure.
Miss Mattie Overman niade a confession
to. Mrs. Thurston very similar to what she
is reported to have told Mrs. Davidson.
M r *.Baddin is not a : myth, but was a
. Ymember of the St, Paul's Bible 'class, and
kept a lodgjng-hpuse, not at Sixth and
Bryant but at Fourth and Mission.
Mrs. Thtfrston declines to give the de
tails <?f what Miss Overman told her, but
last night she made; us 4 of the following
very plain statement:
"Everything that has been said about
Dr. B.Town can. easily be â¢ proved/with the
ex..ceptiqn of: that part relating to the pay
inentof imoney." 'â  - '
Mrs. C. E, Thurston, formerly a resident
of San Francisco, moved to Oakland last
July.; She was a regular attendantat Rev.
J. H. Allen's meetings at the church and
at Mr, Tunnells. Sire is the one who gave
him thewarning. She knows a great deal,
but refuses to divulge details at present,
but says she will be ready to go on the wit
ness stsnd if needed ajnd tell what will
substantiate Mrs. Davidson's story re
garding: the confession of Miss Mattie
Overman. She is; very adverse to saying
anything until she rinds it is absolutely
j necessary to do so.
"I was assisting asa worker at Brother
Allen's meetings in the Lutheran Church.
Mrs, Davidson, Mrs. tunnell, Miss Over
man; and others were regular attendants.
"One hieht Miss Overman professed con
j version and was soundly and thoroughly
converted. I know she was not at all re
ligious before this, as I knew her. She be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1896.
came deeply interested and attended the
meetings regularly, taking an active part.
She naturally looked to me for advice on
certain matters, which I do not believe
would be right at this time to divulge.
"I advised Brother Allen to discontinue
his Bible readings at Mrs. Tunnell's, for
fear he would become involved in some
way with the trouble that I knew must
come sooner or later. The greatest amount
of information was derived from Mrs.
Tunnell, and this is the woman who can
tell the secret of all that now appears to be
full of mystery. Dr. Brown attended the
Bible meetings about three times, but it
was not the Holy Spirit that brought him
there. This was before Mattie Overman
went to Tacoma. She went north about
March 11, 1895, if I remember rightly. Any
way, it was at the time Dr. Brown went
north on a lecture tour last year. They
went up on the same steamer.
"At that time I knew everything and I
have not seen Mattie since my return. I
have often thought of the subject and
knew that it must all come out sooner 'or
later. I knew it would make a sensation,
but felt that the guilty must suffer the
consequences of their sins. I want to see
right prevail and want to see the guilty
punished. It seems strange that Mrs.
Davidson's story should be discredited, as
I consider it is borne out by Miss Over
man's statements. Mattie is the one who
disclosed the affair with Mrs. Stockton.
She said that so long as Mrs. Stockton got
money she did not see why she should not
have some, and yet Dr. Brown professes to
have such confidence in her.
"If Dr. Brown was on trial instead of
Mrs. Davidson I would feel freer to speak.
"It would bean easy task to prove his
position. Mattie Overman is a woman of
the world and is sharp. She will not be
caught if it is possible to avoid it, but she
has confided her story to several people
and it will not be any easy matter for her
to evade telling certain things when the
trial conies. I have read the confession
which Mrs. Davidson says Miss Overman
made to her, and I believe Mrs. Davidson
is speaking the truth. lam deeply inter
ested in seeing the matter probed to the
bottom regardless of who suffers. The
guilty one is an injury to Christianity and
the sooner exposed and thrown out the
better for the cause.
"This much I can say, it will be a very
easy matter to prove that Dr. Brown has
figured in trie case, just as Mrs. Davidson
says he has. Everything that Mrs. David
son has said can also be proved, with the
exception of that part relating to the
money.
'â¢I shall watch the case closely, and when
I consider the time opportune to save the
wronged party I shall make known -what
Mattie told me. lam here and have no
intention of moving, and if Dr. Brown
would like me for a witness I will appear,
but 1 have no fear that he will send for
me."
Mr. Thurston was present during the in
terview with his wife and concurred in all
that she said.
"That Mrs. Baddin is not a myth," he
he said. 'She was a member of the Bible
class and was a very handsome, rather
stout, middle-aged woman. She kept a
lodging-house at Fourth and Mission
streets and was sold out, I believe, about
a year ago. It seems strange she should
have disappeared."
MRS. STOCKTON'S STORY.
She Gives Her Version of the Visit
Paid by Dr. Brown.
Reclining on a couch in the pretty par
lor of her home, Mrs. M. A. Stockton yes-
terday afternoon told a Call reporter the
story of her relations with Dr. Brown dur
ing her active membership in the First
Congregational Cnurch. She is a hand
some blonde, bright and witty. Her man
ner of conversation is easy and graceful.
"I realize that the time has come when
I must defend myself against the charges
of Dr. Brown," she said. "In the first
place. let me deny that I ever attempted to
blackmail him. What I say, I say of my
own free will.
"I joined Dr. Brown's church over two
years ago. My motive in doing so was of
the purest. It was Mrs. Sara B. Cooper
who introduced me to Dr. Brown. That
was my recommendation, and my only
one, when I became a member of the
church. And that recommendation would
admit me into any church in this City.
Mrs. Cooper knows me well.
"I was for nearly two years engaged in
one of her training schools in kindergarten
workâ one of her graduates, in fact.
"I wanted to join the church for my own
religious comfort and satisfaction, and be
sides would meet nice people and be en
abled to keep up my kindergarten work.
These were my purposes in joining the
church.
"I expressed a wish to the superintend
ent of the Sunday-school to the effect that
I would like to take a class, as ray kinder
garten experience would stand me in good
stead. Mrs. Dutton, wishing a rest, gave
me charge of her classes. My duty was to
teach the children's lesson for the day.
"While acting as substitute for Mrs.
Dutton, I often consulted with Dr. Brown
concerning the lessons. He encouraged
me by praising my work. His words were.
Your work is beautiful.' Up to this time
I did not notice that he had any particular
interest in me other than a pastor should
have toward a member of his flock.
'â¢Now as to Dr. Brown's statement. On
the occasion of my sending for him when
I was ill, he says that I made advances to
him while lying in bed ; that I put my
arms about his neck and that I had a con
federate in the room at the time. I wish
to state most emphatically that it is un
true. Me did call on me daring my ill
ness in his capacity as minister, and at
my request. I made no advances toward
him, but as he was about to take his leave
lie leaned over me and kissed me of his
own free will. We were alone in my bed
room at the time. I did not think
.strangely of his caress as I was ill and\
despondent at the time and attributed his
act to his sympathetic nature. This in
cident occurred shortly after I became a
member of the congregation.
"I had no reason suspect Drl Brown
had any infatuation for me, and even if I
were as black as he paints me I would not
have dreamed of such a thing as making
Dr. Brown a victim of my designs.
"I became convinced that Dr. Brown's
interest in me was more than a pastoral
one, when one evening I called at his
study to consult him concerning the Sun
day-school work, as I had often done be
fore. As I extended my hand to him on
leaving he suddenly embraced me in a
most impassioned manner. He only
kissed me once. I was greatly astonished.
I told him that I did not approve of his
conduct and immediately took my de
parture.
"Dr. Brown met me quite frequently on
the street as I was teaving the Surveyor-
General's oiiice, where I held a position.
He met me so frequently that I told him L
thought that he must be neglecting his
duties. He usually walked home with
me. These walks were interspersed with
long and exhilarating streetcar rides to
Castro Heights.
"Once we made a little excursion to
Rincon Hill, and the doctor expatiated at
great length and with usual eloquence
THE CHARMING MRS. M. STOCKTON.

upon the beautiful scenery. As I was a
lone woman in the world and shut up in
an office during the day. and as the doctor
was a most delightful companion, our
streetcar rides were greatly enjoyed by
me. 1 We were not limited to the dummy,
but sometimes took a bobtail car. The
doctor always paid the carfare. As he
was obliged to appear at home for dinner
at 6 o'clock, our rides were usually ter
minated about 5:30 o'clock.
"These rides were always taken at Dr.
Brown's invitation. His conversation al
ways showed that he cared a great deal for
me.
"It has been stated that Dr. Brown and
I were in the habit of frequenting res
taurants noted more for their good din
ners than their morality. I will say truth
fully that on the occasion of our ride to
Castro Heights a dinner was spoken of, as
the climb had given me a sharp appetite.
On our return we went to the Maison
Riche, where we had a modest dinner
served in a private room upstairs. To
the doctor's credit, be it said, that we
drank nothing stronger than tea, and very
weak at that. The doctor, with his usual,
generosity, paid the check, which was not
large. He also tipped the waiter.
"Between courses the doctor said that he
considered me a very bright woman and
that he admired me exceedingly. Tne
doctor's conduct on this occasion was that
of a gentleman and a good fellow.
"He continued to call on me frequently
for a short time. He waxed warm in his
protestations of love for me and declared
that he would leave his wife and family
for me except for the disgrace and ruin
that would follow, as he would be kicked
out of the church and would not be able
to get another. I began to doubt his
sanctity, as he acted very strangely at
times. On one occasion when he cams to
the house to see me he said that he felt so
unhappy with an uncongenial wife and
the hopelessness of his love for me ever
being reciprocated.
"Suddenly he whipped out a large and
rusty pocket-knife and said he had a mind
to end his existence. Realizing he could
not succeed in his purpose with the rusty
knife 1 advised him to wait until he had
had it sharpened and perform the act in a
more dignified and effective manner.
"Dr. Brown says i foisted myself upon
him. The truth, the solemn truth before
God, is that his attentions toward me be
came so marked as to arouse the jealousy
of his wife and attract the attention of
certain members of the congregation,
which made it very humiliating to me.
"Mrs. Brown spoke to me about her hus
band's manifest regard for me. We had
a stormy interview over the matter. The
doctor, in the presence of his wife, con
fessed his affection for me. I replied that
I had no desire to alieniate his affections
from her and was anxious to retain her
friendship. My assurances calmed her and
I was invited to dinner at her house on
various occasions. Dr. Brown's visits to
me discontinued and there were no more
street-car rides.
"1 emphatically deny that 1 ever at
tempted to blackmail Dr. Brown. He vol
untarily offered to assist me, as he knew 1
was in straitened circumstances and
was struggling to get along. This assist
ance at various times I accepted with grat
itude, little dreaming that I would be ever
confronted with such a foul accusation.
"The statement has been made that I
received $600 from Dr. Brown through
Lloyd Tevis is as groundless as the other
charges. Mr. Tevis, not being a member
of the First Congregational Ciwrch, could
not very well be interested in its affairs.
On account of his great friendship for my
father, with whom he crossed the plains
in the early fifties, lie felt, on his death,
that he should take a kindly interest in
the family. I know Mr. Tevis in that way,
and I am very sorry that his name has
been used in this connection. He had
nothing to do with the matter.
"I discontinued attending Dr. Brown's
church because I lost respect for lain.
Our relations were discussed by members
of the congregation and I thougnt it advis
able to withdraw. On leaving the church,
now over a year ago, I severed all commu
nication with it and its pastor, andjnever
by word or deed have sought to injure Dr.
Brown, his family, or any member of the
congregation.
"To show the public that Dr. Brown
would sacrifice another to shield himself I
recall that when about to leave for the
East I asked him for a letter to another
church. He refused on the pretense that
it would substantiate the suspicions of
those members of the congregation of his
infatuation for me as true. It would show
that he was what, they believed him to be
âmy ardent admirer.
"The Mr. Bass spoken of I do not know
except through hearsay.
"I admit that I received money from Dr.
Brown, but he urged me to take it. I
flirted with him, it is true; but he ran
after me all the time. He was insanely
jealous of me. On one occasion, to prove
what I say is true, his son Vincent acci
dentally happened to walk home with me
from prayer-meeting. His father saw him
in my company and became so insanely
jealous of his son that he went to him and
told him not to walk home with me, as it
was distasteful to me.
"The doctor told his son that I had
spoken to him about it. When I next met
Vincent he completely ignored me and
turned away. As we had been very friend
ly I made bold to ask him the cause and
he told me what his father had said.
'"As to my feelings toward Dr. Brown
they are only one of pity, mixed/of course,
with regrets when I recall those long rides
and the burning words of love that fell
from his lips. The doctor admired me
even to my dress. He said I displayed
excellent taste."
Mrs. Stockton was very happy in her con
versation and did not appear to be worry
ing over the statements of her former
spiritual adviser.
MRS. TUNNELL IS MISSING.
Dr. Brown Says He Would Pay
to Learn Her Where-
abouts.
A conference is reported to have been
j held yesterday in the First Congrega
i tional Church between Captain Lees,
[ Dr. Brown and Mi^s Overman. The
I purport of the meeting is mere con
jecture. Both Captain Lees and Dr. Brown
emphatically deny any such occurrence.
"This is the first time I have heard of
such a meeting," said the doctor last even-
I ing, and Captain Lees averred that he had
I seen none of the Brown contingent all day.
A Call representative visited the Brown
| residence last night. Miss Overman came
to the door and held it partly ajar.
"Are you a reporter?" she asked. "Well,
I guess the doctor has nothing to say for
the newspapers to-night."
After a minute or two the door opened
with a crash and sudden swing and the
doctor himself appeared.
'On what subject?" he asked brusquely,
and without awaiting a reply added : "I
have nothing whatever to say in this mat
ter. My attorneys have forbidden my
making any statement at all."
When it was suggested to him that a
j rumor was afloat to the effect that he had
I very recently mode a statement of the
case, he said with some heat, "Those are
false charges. I have made no state
ments and I shall make no statement un
til the matter comes before the court. My
attorneys have forbidden such a thing."
"Why did you allow Miss Overman to
make the long statement yesterday?'
"I know of no such statement," said he,
emphatically. "I have not read anything
of the kind. I saw only the flaring head
lines last night in the evening papers that
j the newsboys were crying around town.
"If Miss Overman made any such state*
I ment, she did so without my knowledge
and when I was away from home."
With regard to the whereabouts of Mrs.
Tunnell, the doctor said:
"If you can find Mrs. Tunnell, we will
â  give you a good deal of money. I know
nothing of her whereabouts, but we want
to subpena her. She has not been in this
i house since Sunday night last, and I have
not the slightest idea where she can be
found."
KNEW MRS. DAVIDSON.
William T. Doane Tells of His Early
Acquaintanceship With the
Aged Prisoner.
"I attended the same school with Mr?.
Davidson in Bucksport," said William T.
Doane of Doane & Henshelwood yester
day. "It was at the East Main Confer
ence Seminary in Bucksport.
"She was Mary Abbott then, and one of
the most beautiful girls I ever saw. Her
family were eminently respectable and
quite prominent in the little town. lam
of the impression that her father was a
man quite well-to-do. I can remember
distinctly how she looked, simply because
of her striking beauty, and I recollect how
one time her brother was kicked by an old
gray horse of theirs.
"I attended the wedding when she was
married to Frank Pierce. He was a re
markably handsome fellow and very well
educated.
"I left there soon afterâ in 1859â and
since then I lost all track of her.
"Mrs. is a very estimable lady,
and we were, as she says, all young people
there together. It is as incredible to me
as to Mrs. Silsby that the handsome and
pious Mary Abbott could be guilty of any
participation in a blackmailing scheme.
"I am a membprof Dr. Brown's church
and I thoroughly believe in the doctor's
innocence. lam inclined to believe, how
ever, that he has told this Mrs. Davidson
things about himself which he should not
have uttered, and that she is now trading
on what he related to her.
"I never had much confidence in these
ultra-prayerful people, but I tell you Dr.
Brown is a fighter all the way through and
he wili right this woman to the bitter
end."

of the Crystal Baths, was born in Bucks

I have is only a boy's meacer recollec

would know as we were little children
there, but I left, as I say, quite young and
went to sea. Girls would remember, any
way, more of people than boys.

"TOO MANY STORIES."
Faith of the Flock In the Pastor
Shaken by the Stockton
Story.
The publication of the story of Dr.
Brown's relations with Mrs. StocKton has
caused considerable change of feeling
among members of his congregation.
There are many who, while not friendly to
the pastor, on account of past troubles in
the church, particularly tne Strauss case,
were strongly disinclined to believe Mrs.
Davidson's story, and were ready to stand
up for the doctor's good name.
Meyer Strauss, who was dismissed from
the church several months ago and after
ward reinstated, has no friendly feelings
for Dr. Brown, but will not speak of the
case because, as he said yesterday, "a
burnt child is afraid of fire." The cause of
his trouble with the deacons was over a
letter he had written to one of the ladies
who taught in the Sunday-school, in
which he criticized Dr. Brown in connec
tion with his relations to the Christian
Endeavor Society. Over this there was
made a wide breach in the church which
has not been healed, and most of those
who then espoused the cause of Mr.
Strauss' cause are still unfriendly to Dr.
Brown.
"I have been very thankful, since this
scandal came up, that I know nothing of
it," said Mr. Strauss. "Idon'i talk about it
and won't talk about it even to the other
members. I have suffered enough over
my own trouble not to care to get into
another dispute."
Mr. Strauss said that he knew very little
about Mrs. Davidson, and could not judge
of the case at all. He hoped for the good
of the church that the stain would be re
moved.
Mrs. French, who is one of the leaders
in the congregation, was inclined to criti
cize some of Dr. Brown's methods in con
ducting his case. It was at her house that
Mrs. Davidson stayed for three days just
before Christmas. "Mrs. Davidson came
to my house on the Sunday before Christ
mas," said Mrs. French yesterday.
"She said that she was afraid for her
life, and I asked her to stay over night.
While she did not evince great fear by lier
manner, may have believed that she
was in danger. You know Miss Overman
has a very vindictive look. On Monday
she said that she would like to write out
a statement in case anything should hap
pen. She wrote all day Monday, and said
nothing about going, and stayed over
Tuesday and until Wednesday, Christmas
day. I did not want her to stay with us
during our Cnristmas celebration, and had
to. as kindly a3 I could, ask her to go. I
suggested, as she said she had a cousin in
the City, that she go to him. She did not
know where he was, she said, but finally
went. I heard nothing from her after
that, and on Saturday went down to her
room to see if anything had happened. I
found her there all right, and so happened
to be there when she was arrested. I did not
know what she wrote while at my house.
She did not offer to read her statement
to me.

"A great many of the members feel tha|
even if she is not all right herself she may. .
be telling the truth. Many of the state-:.
ments that have been made by Miss Over
man are confirmatory. Still her state
ments as to Mrs. Baddin should be Â»Ã¼bÂ»
-stantiated. ...
"Of course, no one believed Dr. Brown,
guilty in the Stockton case. No one knew
then, however, that he had paid any.:
money. Dr. Brown is not the sort of man
that any one would expect such charges to
be made against, and there has never beert
the least talk in that direction about him.
I am perfectly staggered at it all and sick
of the thought of it.
"Those who knew of the Stockton case
believed him innocent, but now to have
this second charge come up, one hardly
knows what to think of it. It seems very
strange that a man should pay $<JOO in one
case and $500 in another if there was noth
ing in it. It looks very black for that
Overman girl, whether Mrs. Davidson was
in league with her or not. She is not a
woman who would fail to take care of her
self."
MRS. DAVIDSON CONFIDENT
Says That Truth and Justice Must
and Shall Triumph in the End.
Mr?. Davidson is still in the City Prison,
though she has strong hopes of securing
her freedom to-day. She is confident that
the evidence which will be offered by Dr.
Brown in his charge of extortion will not
be strong enough to warrant the court in
holding her. However, should matters
turn out differently, the lady has the
promise of bail, and will probably occupy
her private apartments to-night.
"The theory advanced in a morning
paper : " she said, "that Mrs. Tunnell and
the so-called 'mysterious' Mrs. Baddin
are one and the same is absurd. I know
Mrs. Tunnell fairly well and I did not
know the woman who called herself Mrs.
Baddin.
"The latter always visited my house at
night and generally came veiled. I would
have known Mrs. Tunnell under any cir
cumstances; first because she has a very
striking figure, and second because her
voice is of such peculiar intonation as not
to be forgotten if once heard.
"Confined as I am here it is impossible
for me to learn anything new, so all that I
could say would be to repeat an oft-told
story, and, as God is my witness, all that I
have said concerning Dr. Brown, Miss
Overman and every one else connected
witn the disgraceful proceedings is true in
every detail. He will rind that lam not
a woman to shrink from any ordeal when
truth and justice are the poinrs at issue.
Dr. Brown nas brought all this on hin>
seif, and now he must take the conse
quences.
"I am not one bit afraid of the final out
come, though it is barely possible that the
man who poses before the world as a
Christian gentleman and an expounder of
Christ's teachings will triumph tem
porarily. He is a man full of devices and
schemes, and of such strong influence that
it would be an easy thing for him to
Svengali both Judge and jury for the time
being.
"I am deeply grateful to the press for
the uniform courtesy shown me, and
whether I come out of this disgraceful
situation fully vindicated or am made to
suffer the consequences of this vile man's
strength I shall never forget it. The situa
tion here js not by any means pleasant
but I am supported by Cnrist Jesus, who
tells me that truth will triumph in the
end."
