[Copyright, 1898, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Eng., March Yesterday's
meeting between the Queen of England,
who has been for tifty-nine years on her
throne, and the Emperor of Austria, who
has been for forty-eight years on his, is
said to have been their first. It sounds
strange enough that the two venerable
xnonarchs, whose capitals are only a few
hundred miles apart, and whose countries
for more than a generation have been on
peculiarly friendly terms, should never
have laid eyes on each other until now.
Ordinarily such a curious fact, if it be a
fact, would have appealed to journalistic
imaginations all over Europe, . but it
receives only the barest incidental mention,
for the reason that it is a thousand times
more important to wonder what they said
when finally they did find themselves face
to face. There is undoubtedly much that
is impressive in the spectacle of these two
saddened old sovereigns at last coming
together and looking out, side by side,
upon the wild skies which overhang
Christendom, vivid with angry portents of
storm; but, for once, people are too busy
thinking about the storm itself to dwell
much on its picturesque personal incidents,
however suggestive. Where will this storm
break, and who will be struck first, are
questions which lie at the back of every
mind. From its turbulent birthday, this
year of ISS6 has worn a sinister aspect in
men's thoughts, until now faith in its evil
character', has " become almost a general

campaign is. this week's quota to the
crowded sensations of the season. Already
Italy's disaster is half forgotten and next
week who knows what fresh surprise is in
store for the world? It is as if events had
wrested themselves free from human con
trol and were hurling forward as caprice
dictated, shaking kingdoms as they come.
Just a little more clearly than before it
can be seen that the Triple Alliance has
been badly wrenched by the recent shocks,
and is perhaps too much hurt to survive.
There are rumors to-day that William,
Francis Joseph and Humbert" are to have
a hurried personal conference next week
somewhere in Northern Italy, but the
value of the story it is not possible to
guess. It is permissible to imagine, how
ever, that William is frightened at the rev
elation of the results of his past year's
statesmanship, adopting in an evil moment
that vicious Bismarckian policy which in
his saner years he had discarded. The
German Emperor has been openly chasing
the will-o'-the-wisp of Russian friendship
and lending himself complaisantly to one
Muscovite plan after another till now, on
the very brink of the gulf, he seems to halt
and recognize where he is. His two part
ners in the Triple Alliance are visibly dis
cussing the possibility of leaving him in
the lurch altogether. . England has been
violently alienated from him and his peo
ple, and now it is borne in upon him that
Russia and France have been merely play
ing with him, pocketing his gifts and ac
cepting his services, but holding them
selves ready, all the same, to fall upon and
rend him the moment his foot slipped on
his treacherous path. I believe this is
something like the situation as he sees it
to-day.
it is plain that the Austrian Premier, in
his visit to Berlin, has been laying great
stress on the necessity of Germany getting
back the English friendship. All the of
ficial press of Y Vienna and Buda-Pesth
teems with this advice, and through it one
continually catches the suggestion that if
Germany can't do this then v the Triple Al
liance is in a bad way indeed. Austria in
this matter speaks as well for Roumania,
which finds itself suddenly alone, among
the Balkan States in attitude of defiance
to Russia, and is terrified at its isolation.
Italy seems to have accepted and digested
its lesson. Rudini will patch up â¢ a com
promise with Menelik, saving as much of
King Humbert's dignity as possible; â -, will
release most of Crispi's political prisoners,
and will f make overtures to France . for
more amicable trade and political rela
tions. At Rome not less" than at Vienna
and Bucharest almost everything depends
on what England may resolve to do.
But who can tell what England will do?
T is sudden development of an aggres
sive Soudan policy confuses and disturbs
public opinion here. It is apparent that
France will be furious about it, and yet
until, how' every V one had believed that
Lord Salisbury. was sincere in trying to
establish a p-rmanent close understand
ing with France. . No. possible triumph
over Dervishes or consequent; indirect as
sistance to the Italians in Africa would
weigh for a moment against the disaster of
provoking a fresh .Anglo-French . quarrel.
Yet this is apparently what is being done,
and the English people do not like it at
all. Unless Curzon's speech next Monday
puts a better face on, the thing than it
wtars now, there â¢ will begin, to be the
genera! \. outcry against Lord Salisbury's
conduct of the foreign affairs. He has al
ready scored more diplomatic failures and
got into more dip'oraatic hot water : than

whole i country to mutiny against its
Foreign Office. ' The discovery of the bull
headed incompetency with which this
Foreign Office got together the Venezuelan
blue book had a great moral effect there in
this same line of educating the public to
distrust the whole Downing-street outfit.
No one supposes that there was any dis
honest intention underlying these gross
blunders, but in troublous times the na
tion has far more to. fear from its fools
than from its knaves.
Although the oldest member of Parlia
ment hardly recalls a time when the Gov
ernment benches were able to turn on at
will such majorities of from 150 to 200 in
every division on every subject as those
which are now wielded by Balfour, rumors
that Ministerial disasters are impending
obstinately continue to haunt the lobbies
and smoking-rooms in St. Stephen's. It is
true that no tangible signs appear of fric
tion between the Cecil Rhodes and Cham
berlain groups in the Cabinet, but sparks
are struck with increasing frequency
among their respective retainers in the
rank and file of tne party. Last Tuesday,
for instance, Galloway, who is a Tory
member for one of the Manchester divi
sions, had put down a notice of the ques
tion that he is to ask about the fair wages
resolution of, 1891. Chamberlain sent his
private secretary to him with the polite
request that he withdraw the question,
and Galloway returned the simple reply,
"I will see Mr. Chamberlain first." This
incident borrows significance from the fact
that Galloway's constituency adjoins Bal
four's, and that they are close political
friends.
Predictions that the open split between
Chamberlain and his Tory colleagues will
come over the Transvaal business continue
to be heard, but they grow less confident
now that the matter has got into British
law courts, where the science of delay has
been carried to the heartbreaking point of
perfection. So far as it is understood, the
Jameson hearing next Tuesday will occupy
only a few hours and then be adjourned
another week, and after that everything
will be suspended for a month or so, os
tensibly to await the arrival of evidence
from the Transvaal, but private letters
from the Cape ' say that the Colonial Office
men sent out thereto gather this testi
mony are doing nothing but to. amuse
themselves, and the suspicion is strong
there that the whole thing is to be strung
out indefinitely till public attention is di
verted to other topics of interest, when it
will be quietly allowed to drop. I would
not like to say that you could not find that
same suspicion here in England if you
looked hard for it.
A week of further meditation :on that
annual grant of Â£1800 to the Duke of Cam
bridge smuggled into the army estimates
has aroused such wide-spread hostility
among the Tories themselves now that it
is hardly doubted that the Duke will be
pressed by the Ministry to decline the
thing in advance. If he refuses to do this
then the Ministry will' have 'to face the
alternative of abandoning the grant them
selves or probably of being beaten on it.
This royal begging for money used to be
common enough, and there were periodical
scandal^ about it, . till Mr. Gladstone and
other old servants and friends of the crow
arranged a new system of snppoet for the
â, â me it wan -supposed prrcma-vt
further incidents of that unpleasant sort.
The Duke of ' Coburg'a grant' skated over
very thin ice, it is true, but it was possible
to make a certain defense of it,' and the
House of Commons decided that it was un
wise to make a fuss, over it, but this Cam
bridge grant has no defense whatever. He
is an extremely rich man as he is, and,
moreover, this present Ministry made a
specific promise only last August that
â¢nothing of the kind should be attempted.
It is not only the .Liberals now, but appar
ently a half of the Tory party and all the
Liberal-Unionists, who have ' determined
that the promise shall be kept, and appar
ently the old Georgian Duke will be cudg
eled into evacuating one more last ditch.
Another rather unexpected'demonstra
tion of Liberal views among this huge
Tory majority was found in the vote by
which it become? immediately possible to
open all the state museums and picture
galleries to the public on Sunday. This
long sought-for boon had been stolidly re
fused by the previous House of Commons,
and the casual precipitancy with which it
has now been all at once conceded ; has al
most taken the public breath away. The
Sabbatarians, too, are so completely taken
aback . that they have not yet collected
themselves for a chorus of protests. By
the time - that they begin to make
themselves heard the British Museum,
National Gallery and the great collections
of South Kensington will all be open for
seven days in the week, and after this is an
accomplished fact it is vain to imagine that
it can ever be upset.
The triumphant moral vindication given
to Harry Marks by two of her Majesty's
Judges, who have been inquiring into the
Whitechapel election for over a month, is
enough to make a dog sick. It needed
only this crowning -result to convince the
last remaining doubter that the corrupt
practices act, as it has been whittled down
by successive judicial decisions,' is ridicu
lous rubbish which must promptly be shot
into the dustbin.
The story that the Kaiser's malformed
left arm has been diagnosed by. the Roent
gen process, and that surgeons by this
help will now be able to restore its useful-,
ness, is very pretty, but will : hardly hold
water. The limb in question has no bones
worth talking of. and it is incredible that
auy structural operation can bring vigor
into a member which has been withered
and lifeless for thirty years.
It Is not surprising that it has already
occurred to the Parisian press wits, to call
the young cousin of the Orleanist pre
tender who has ' just been decorated with
the Legion of Honor Henri Egalite. For
over a, century the royal house of France
has always contained a cadet branch which
played the part of . demagogic treason
against its dynastic head. Up to 1883 five
generations of Orleans princes bad.con
spired against, their family chief, with
regicide and usurpation as incidents in a
sustained career of intriguing and faith
lessness. ' Now that the Orleanist family
by process v of exhaustion represents " all
that is left of the French Bourbons, it de
velops out of its own vitals its malignant
parasite' and foe. V Prince Henri is two
years older than his ' cousin, the Due
d'Orleans, and ..' has _ been pursuing ' this
game of personal advertisement ever since
the collapse of the Boulanger movement.
It is his sister who was formerly affianced
to the Due d'Orleans who is now to marry
the Due de Macmahon, and it is apparent
that the whole Chartres group of the fam
ily are to utilize their exemption, from . ex
ile by outwardly acknowledging - the . re

: A quaint newspaper correspondence has

the project of raising a ; cavalry regiment

who was impressed by the fact that a large

know enough to pass examination and get
commissions in the army . and yet bad the
muscle, and , .predatory instincts which
make good soldiers. - He got a committee
together, sent ont ...a circular and got 537
applicants, all vouched for as gentlemen,
but the War Office ; . callously refused 'to
hear of it. He appeals to the papers now
for an expression of public opinion, and
to-day. one of the Rugby masters says that
everybody who has to do with the public
school must have seen numbers of young
men who are in tastes and physique just
what the army j wants, and who yet have;
not brains enough to enter Sandhurst. He
is very hot for the scheme, and so are oth
ers who write. ;It is said that all the ap
plicants accepted the stipulation that they
would ask for no ; privileges or pay more S
than ordinary troopers, and would'
serve contentedly as J privates on the only
condition that they would be kept together

esting commentary on the English social
existence. My only surprise is that the
projectors while they were about it lim
ited their scheme :to a mere paltry regi

should Y be" true to the most rudimentary
principles of 'â¢ justice or . morality Colonel
Jull, who has been recently appointed mil
itary Governor of Matanzas province,
should be in the galleys among criminals.
It is but a short time since he was relieved
by General Martinez Campos Âof the mili
tary command at Cienfuegos,- as he had
not once encased any of the ; insurgent
forces, but vented all his ferocious instincts
against innocent and inoffensive peasants.
'â¢In Yaguaramas, a small town near Cien
fugos, he arrested as suspected spies An
tonio Morjon, an honest and hard-working
man, and Ygnacio Chapi, who is well ad
vanced in years and ': almost blind. Not
being able to prove the charge against
them, as they were innocent, he ; ordered
Major Moreno of the Barcelona battalion,
doing garrison duty at : Yaguaramas, to
kill them with machetes and have them
buried immediately. Major Moreno an
swered that he was a gentleman who had
come to fight for the integrity of his coun
try and not to commit murder. This dis
pleased the colonel, .but. unfortunately a
volunteer sergeant with six' soldiers were
willing to execute the order of the colonel,
and Morjon and Chapi were murdered
without pity. â  ;'-: > \,
"The order of Jull was executed in the
most , cruel manner. It horrifies to even
think of it. Mr. Chapi, who knew the
ways of Colonel Jull, on being awakened
at 3 o'clock in the morning and notified by
the volunteer chief of the guard that he
and Morjon had to go out, suspected what
was to come and told . his companion to
cry out for help as soon as they would be
taken out of the fort. They did so, but
those 5 who* were .to execute -the order of
Jul! were neither moved nor weakened in
their , purpose. .. On the contrary, at the
first screams . of Chapi and Morjon _ they
threw a lasso over their . heads and pulled
them till in a few moments they fell to the
ground choked â¢ ; to death. They were
dragged on â  the earth : without pity to the
place where they were buried. â  All tnis
bloody scene was witnessed by Jull from a
short distance. Â» " '.
"Providence has not ; willed that such
iniaiiity should remain hidden forever. In
the hurry the grave where these two in
nocent men were buried was not dug deep
enough, and / part of the rope with which
they were choked remained outside. . A
neighbor looking for a lost cow saw the
rope, took hold of â  it, and, on pulling, dis
interred' the head jof one of the victims.
He was terror stricken, and immediately
gave notice to \ the Guardia Civil and the
Judge, j These authorities soon found out
that the men had been killed by order of
Colonel Jull, and therefore proceedings
were suspended.

Plant and Significance of the Anglo-
Egyptian. Expedition.
-LONDON, ..: Engâ -. March 14.â 1t is the
opinion in , highly informed military cir
cles that the objective point of the Anglo-
Egyptian expedition, mention of which
was made in these dispatches this week, it
not Dongola, but Berber. The Govern
ment' is interested in minimizing the im
portance of the. enterprise and it will
doubtless, when explaining the matter ' to
the House of Commons, speak of the ex
pedition as an Egyptian one arising ; from
the necessity of checking the projected ad
vance of the Mahdists into Egpyt. /
The object of the expedition is not the
â¢ protection of Egypt, but is to make a di
version in favor of the Italians > at Kassala.
This , seems to ;be the best possible line of
action to assist : Italy without drawing
upon the British treasury, while at the
same time jit > will shelve i indefinitely the
demands for the British evacuation of
Egypt. : The main cost of the expedition
will .: fall upon ; the :. Egyptian treasury,
which is now in a condition to ' bear a
financial strain. The financial report
shows for 1895 a ; revenue of Â£1,088,000 in
excess of the expenditures. This is a most

striking proof of the prosperity of the
country under British administration.
Fighting is certain. The Mahdi has a
.large force at Dongola, an*d this will un
doubtedly bo formidably increased before
the expedition has time to get within
striking distance. Grave fears are enter
tained of the fighting qualities of the
Egyptian army, and the expedition will
prove a severe lest of its courage. It may
â  be attended by disaster.
The Anglo-Egyptian expedition has the
unstinted approval of the Conservatives
and Liberal-Unionists, the hesitating sup
port of the Liberals and the fierce opposi
tion of the Radicals. A statement relative
to the matter will be made in the House
of Commons on Monday night by the
Right Hon. George Curzon, Parliamentary
! Secretary of tee Foreign Office, and will lead
' to the warmest debate of the session, which
will be followed by every device of obstruc
tion. In gleaning from official opinion it
is found that the line of defense of the
Government will be a denial that the ex
: pedition aims at a reconquest of any part
â â 'â  of the Soudan, and a statement that the
British troops will only be employed to
puard the line to Wady Haifa, while the
Egyptian troops advance to Old Dongola,
making their headquarters at El Ordeh
(New Dongola). It is stated this afternoon
that the Egyptian troops will not go be
yond Old Dongola. Defense, not conquest,
will be the substance of the Government's
explanations.
Assurances of this sort will deceive no
body. According to Cairo advices the
12,000 Egyptian troops who will take part
in the expedition will begin to advance
immediately. Part of them will march
1 along the Nile, while the others will pro
ceed in light-draught steamers >up the
â river, which is now so low "that in many
' places camel transport must be largely
used. Field Marshal Lord Wolseley and
General Kitchner do not seem to place
much trust in the Egyptian troops. It is
not expected that the Dervishes will make
a stand at El Ordeh, but in case of fight
> ing the British troops will be ready to sup
j port the Egyptians. With a view to giv
ing this support, a railway will be con
structed for 100 miles southward from
Wady Haifa, and river steamers, armed
with guns, will be stationed between the
point where the railway will terminate and
El Ordeh. The Nile at this part of its
course is navigable for light-draught
steamers for the greater part of the year.
The British troops, if the real designs of
the Government are carried out, will ad
vance in force up the Nile in August. A
contingent of the Indian army, chiefly
Sikhs and Ghoorkas, will, it is reported,
I be likely to be landed at Suakin to operate
jin conjunction with the Anglo- Egyptian
! forces and march to Berber. The London
papers have arranged to send special cor
respondents with the expedition. It is
generally conceded that the campaign will
be a big undertaking, though the Govern
ment is reluctant to disclose the whole
'< scheme.
' Simultaneously with the Dongola expe
dition a Belgian-Congo Free State force,
led by Baron Dhanis, will attack the
| Dervishes on the Upper Nile. Acting with
; the consent of the British Foreign Office,
, Baron Dhanis has recruited at Lagos 680
Houssas, who have been drilled by British
; officers. These natives, who are splendid
j fighters and who will go wherever they are
l led without fear of danger, will join the
Belgian and Congo Free State forces. The
Congo State has chartered thirty steamers,
which will convey the expedition as far as
possible on the Congo River.
BROKERS BADLY WHIPPED
Blue Jay Corner Manipulators
at Denver Meet With
Disaster.
Ruin and Disgrace Confronting the Con
spiratorsâConsternation Among
the Dupes.
DENVER, Colo., March 14.â The corner
attempted by Brokers Randall and Royer
in Blue Jay yesterday proved disastrous
to the schemers and dragged in many of
the outside brokers who had attempted to
scalp the market. J. H. Royer failed to
appear at the Clearing-house to-day and
34,000 shares were sold out by the secre
tary of the Exchange. His shortage to
the Clearing-house was over $36,000, while
to other brokers it was very much more.
Because of Royer s failure Brokers Ger
araghty and Keithley were unable to clear
and they, too, were sbld out, all three be-
ing suspended. Randall evidently pro
tected himself at the expense of his'asso
ciates in the scheme. The stock dropped
from 29 cents on yesterday's quotation to
4 cents to-day.
This affair has created a great sensation
and much indignation among the brokers,
who were forced to settle by giving checks
instead of receiving the profits they
thought they had made yesterday.
Trouble now awaits Randall on Monday,
when he must meet his futures.
The Blue Jay Company disown any
knowledge of this conspiracy of the brokers
to corner the stock. On contracts 95,000
additional shares will be issued by the
company on Monday.
- During the flurry of Friday Royer loaded
up with 123,000 shares, most of which was
on cash transactions, while Randall kept
shy of cash trades and dabbled in futures.

DR. CARL PETERS
MUST BE TRIED
Foundation for Accusations
Against the African
Explorer.
BEBEL'S CHARGES STAND.
For His Fiendish Practices the
German Official Was Ac
cused of Murder.
TO BE PUBLICLY PROSECUTED.
That Decision Reached After Revela
tions Brought Out by the Debate
in the Reichstag.
BERLIN, Gmmany, March 14.â The
concluding incidents of the debate in the
Reichstag to-day upon the occasion of the
discussion of the colonial budget, which
developed charges against Dr. Carl Peters,
the African explorer, abundantly justified
the demands which were made and ac
ceded to by the Government that an in
quiry be made into the accusations brought
aga inst Peters. The defense of Dr. Peters,
which was attempted by Dr. Kayser, the
Secretary of the Colonial Department, left
the position of the Government lament
ably weak, especially in view of the de
clarations made by l)r. Lieber, the clerical
leader, that the Central party held that
Dr. Peters was a criminal in the eyes of
all honest men and that the whole Ger
man-African administration ' had been
placed under suspicion.
The accusation made by Herr Bebel,
the socialist leader, that Dr. Peters had
forced the daughter of a native chief to be
come his mistress and had subsequently
hanged her and his male body-servant
upon discovering that illicit relations were
being maintained between them, formed
the pivot of to-day's debate, which was of
a most exciting character. The charge
made by Herr Bebel is based on a report
made by Bishop Tucker to the English
Missionary Society, and also upon corre
spondence which passed between Bishop
Tucker and Dr. Peters in which the Bishop
accused Peters of murder.
In reply to this accusation Dr. Peters
wrote to Bishop Tucker that he had mar
ried the girl according to African rites,
and that in accordance with the native
African law he was entitled to kill her
upon discovering that she was guilty of
infidelity.
Dr. Kayser, Secretary of the Colonial
Department, announced that the Chancel
lor, Prince Hohenlohe, had ordered the in
stitution of disciplinary proceedings
against Dr. Peters in order to. establish
the truth or falsity of the contents of the
letter supposed to have been written by
Dr. Peters to Bishop Tucker. pCÂ«j:i
Herr Lonzman was cheered on all sides
when, in reply to Dr. Kayser, he said that
what the Government had proposed to do
in the matter was not enough. The pub
lic prosecutor, he said, must try Dr.
Peters, not a disciplinary court, which had
proved to be ineffective in the cases of
Herr Leist, the Chancellor of the Came
roons, and his substitute, HerrWehlau,
who ought also to have been tried by the
public prosecutor.
Count yon Arnim read a letter from Dr.
Peters denying that he had ever written to
Bishop Tucker in the terms stated by
Herr Bebel.
The result of to-day's debate will be that
Dr. Peters besides being tried by a discip
linary court will also' have to undergo pub
lic prosecution. Dr. Peters still holds a
position in the service of the State at a
salary of 6000 marks a year . and is the
leader of the party which is agitating Ger
man colonial extension. The revelations
brought out by the debate and the disclos
ures yet to be made in the courts will be
altogether likely to end his career of use
fulness if, indeed, there is any of it re
maining.
The strain in the relations of Germany
with England is rapidly relaxing under
the influence of the conviction that a
British expedition to Dongola would be
the very best practical intervention in favor
of Italy, and no better proof can be given
to the political circle in Berlin of Eng
land's friendliness toward Germany's ally.
Count Goluchowski, the Austrian Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, learned of the decis
ion of the British Government to advance
against Dongola before leaving Berlin for
Vienna yesterday and called upon Sir
Frank Lascelles, the British Embassador,
and congratulated him. and the latter es
corted ' the Austrian Foreign Minister to
the station.
It ie a fact that Count Goluchowski ten
dered to Prince Hohenlohe the good offices
of Austria to settle the difficulty between
Germany and England, â¢ and he also re
ferred 1 to the trouble between the two
countries in conversation with the Em
peror. y â¢ ?' â ' '' "
Rumor adds that the , Kaiser assured
Count Goluchowski that no difficulties
existed between Germany and' England,
and the relations between the two Govern
ments were absolutely harmonious. V In
regard to the renewal of the Triple Alliance
treaty, there is no doubt that Count Go-
luchowski's visit to Berlin was closely con
nected with the object. The treaty of
Italy with the "Zwei Kaiser Bund" ex
pires in 1897, but it will continues another
six years unless one of the contracting
parties gives a year's notice . of witrMjgwal
prior to the termination of the 1 treatyT
Marquis di Rudini, Italian Prime Minis
ter, had the option of giving a year's no
tioe, but he has intimated his acceptance
of the convention in its present form. The
Dreibund is therefore safe until 1903.
The Emperor's visit to Count Lanza di
Busca, the ' Italian Embassador," at the
Italian embassy on Wednesday, the inter
view lasting four hours, is understood to
have clinched the matter. V
The United . States embassy > here has

Ring. V
NEW YORK, N. V., March 14.â The
heavy-weight championship battle of the
world is just as much in the embryo as
ever. Corbett bar? signed articles of agree
ment that purported to be from the Na
tional Sporting Club of London. : ' :
This organization has repudiated the ar
ticles of agreement and sticks to its origi
nal declaration". That is that \no proposi
tion in which Corbett's name is involved
will be seriously entertained until the
ex-champion I has withdrawn - his rem arks
made about the National Sporting Club
and apologized to the members' of that
organization. ....;.; ";,p
When asked for his views on the situa
tion to-day Fitzsimmons laughed and said :
"The fake articles of agreement have', a
Sioux City flavor about them. I have the
highest opinion of the gentlemen ; con
nected with Â« the National Sporting Club,
and am willing to meet any man under its
auspices that they consider worth offering
a purse for, but Corbett. ' I draw the line
at that man 'for several reasons.
"1 am how several classes by . myself. I
am the heavy-weight and middle-weight
champion of the world.
V"I will fight any man from 150 pounds
upward that honestly wishes ,to fight. I
draw the line, however, at Corbett. I will
give him a dose of his own medicine. I
will not be so severe with him as he was
with me, though. All I; demand .is that
he vanquish Peter Maher. If he can, and
does defeat Peter Maher, and I doubt very
much if he^can, I will take him on at once.
"When he refused to fight me and prac
tically put Maher up in his place, it is ..not
generally known that I offered to' stop
him in ten rounds. This, however, is the
case. I instructed Stuart to make a match
of this kind when he came to New York to
try to get Corbett to meet me. Corbett
never honestly intended to fight me, or we
could have met long ago. He is afraid of
me, but is now seeking to advertise himself
as an actor at my expense.
"His idea is not to fight, but to keep
himself before the public. I have driven
him out of the prizering and. I will drive
him off the stage before I am through with
him. If no one lays claim to my title 'of
champion, I may waive my conditions
slightly in Corbett' s favor. I may even go
so for as to not insist that he defeat Maher
and get him on in a limited-round contest.
i'-.. "I : mean to agree to stop him in ten
rounds. This he knows I can do and he
will no doubt meet my ultimatum with as
many subterfuges and dodges as he has
done heretofore. The only chance he will

to-day fought on â¢ gamely, but had finally
to resign after sixty-six moves.

. LONDON, Eng., March 14.â When it be
came known in London chess 'Circles this
morning that the British team would have
a : good chance of Y winning Y the match
against America, many chess-players hur
ried to the Cannon-street Hotel, where the
Britishers were conducting their games, in
order â¢to j witness the V play. Great enthu- ,
siasm prevailed when; shortly after! the
beginning of play the i first victory fell to
England. The winner, E. M. Jackson, is
still a very young man. - All 5 the ' experts
present admitted that Jackson won his
game in good style. Â
p Alter this the spectators became mostly'
interested in the V Pillsburv-Blackburn
game, and ,at about '4:3o, it was thought
that Pillsbury would draw the { contest.
After Showalter : : had i won ~ h is game i the
general impression here was that most of
the games would be drawn, and that J the
issue of the match would depend upon the
Pillsbury-Blackburn game; but after Mills
consented : to ; a i draw, much to the disap
ointment of all present, and X when ': Bird
became, a ; prey to Burille's combinations,
BxRP, it \ was realized v here that . the
Britishers would lose the match. V
V- There \ is : only one \ game \ left to Ybe fin
ished, the one between Tinsley and Barry.
The latter player : is = scarcely known \ here,'
and his i wonderful and precise Pay was
the object of: much admiration. The Brit

manner, ;J and | Sir * George '% Newnes, Bart.,

JACKSOX AMD WALLIXG.
Pearl Bryan's Slayers Fight Against
Returning to Kentucky.
CINCINNATI. : Ohio, March 14.â
intention of the Circuit Court to hear the
Jackson and Walling extradition matter,
this morning was balked by the fact that
the attorneys in the case had not perfected
their record in error from the decision of
the Common Pleas Judge. In consequence
a delay of several hours ensued, during
which the attorneys were busy making up
the papers.
The case opened at 11 o'clock before
Judges Ewins, Smith and Cox. Jackson
and Walling were not present. Attorney
Shepard, for Walling, made the announce
ment, ana ex-Judge Ermston read a peti
tion in habeas . corpus, setting â¢ forth that
Jackson and Walling were unlawfully de
prived of their liberty, and pleading errors
of law and lack of evidence. A bill of ex
ceptions was presented and 'defects : al
leged in the Common Pleas decision as to
the warrants supporting requisition
papers. Ermston then devoted himself to
argument as to the position of Kentucky
if the prisoners should be extradited arid
as to any injury the accused would receive
if taken there and 1 placed recklessly on
trial to determine which is the principal
and which theÂ»accessory.
No -decision was reached, court adjourn
ing. until next Monday.
ALBERT WALLACE HANGED
Brought to the Scaffold at Pekin,
111, for Killing His
' Sister.
The Dissolute Man Was Crazed With
Jealousy, Because Dis
, V inherited.
PEKIN, 111., March 14.-Albert Wallace
was hanged to-day for the murder of his
sister. He was pronounced dead in eleven
minutes after the drop fell. He made no
statement. â¢â ;. ,V
: The crime : for : which Wallace suffered
to-day- was the murder of his sister, Mrs.
John Bowlsby, the evening of February
19, 1895. All the parties lived in Dillon
Township,' Tazewell County. Albert had
borne a bad â¢; reputation, often drinking
heavily, and was considered a dangerous
and quarrelsome fellow. When his father,
Andrew Wallace, met his death some years
ago, his property was left to his daughter,
and Albert was cut off with nothing.
Mr. and Mrs. Bowlsby gave him a home
and treated him well, though there were
continual quarrels over the property. Oh
the evening the crime was committed Mrs.
DrÂ»wloKjr wan i. T>laviner an - orenn- in- 'he
sitting-room, her husband, Lawrence
Linam (the hired man) and Albert stand
ing about it singing. Albert suddenly left
the room, and a moment later began
shooting through the window with a shot
gun. Mrs. Bowlsby was shot in the
stomach and died the next day. Her hus
band had ' his right hand shot off and
Linam received a charge in the limbs.
Immediately after the shooting Wallace
drove to Pekin and gave himself up, though
refusing to acknowledge the crime.
At the â¢ September term of the Circuit
Court he was found guilty : and sentenced
by Judge N. W. Green to hang October 25,
1895. The case was carried to the Supreme
Court for the Northern District at Ottawa,
which granted a supersedeas two day? be
fore the day of execution. The motion for
a new trial was argued before the Supreme
Court of the Central District at the Janu
ary, term and on January 23 was remanded
to the Circuit Court for resentence. Feb
ruary 19 he was sentenced to hang on
March 14.
When the Supreme Court granted the
supersedeas a mob was ; organized in Dil
lon Township to lynch Wallace, but lack
ing a leader nothing came of the attempt.
Throughout the trial Wallace V has pre
served wonderful coolness and up to the
last joked and laughed with his guards.
He has married sisters in Peoria and Tre
mont, who exhausted every resource to
save his life.
Dillon Township is a rough locality.
Lewis Perrill was shot there by George
Smith, who is now under sentence of death.
The list of the crimes committed there is a
long one.
KRUGER'S TRIP TO LONDON
It Is Fiercely Opposed by the
Organ of the Boer Gov

Movements in the Transvaal Which
Both Puzzle and Alarm the
English.
LONDON, Eng., March 14.â President
Kruger of the South African republic told
his latest interviewer, the editor of South
Africa, that he was going to London as
soon as he had "arranged matters with his
Government. The Volksstein of Pretoria,
the accredited organ of ; the Boer Govern
ment; vehemently opposes President Kru
ger' : acceptance " ; of ;' Colonial Secretary
Chamberlain's: invitation to visit London
to discuss Transvaal affairs.* The English,
says the Volksstein, have a shrewdly accu
rate desire to get President Kruger to Lon
don, iin ' order to ; show .Europe; that the
Transvaal is a vassal state of Great Britain^
The journey, it : adds, will humiliate the
President and will make him appear, not
as a ; ruler to carry out the wishes of the
Transvaal, but "â  as the ; tool of Downing
street. p. ;., : Y'.-V -Ipv^SS-'' : "- : .'"â ''â â '
f The fact. is that President ' Kruger con
tinues to puzzle English officialdom.
While ; seeming] to ''â  be all' frankness â ': and
friendliness, reliable advices report him to
be secretly continuing his elaborate opera
tions to arm the Transvaal. It is a matter
of the greatest uneasiness here that small
groups >of Germans, who are ;; understood
to ~~j be ;- veterans, ' ' are J systematically ?? im
ported into the Transvaal.;' The '; artillery
strength of the republic has been greatly
increased and there are now a number of
retired German officers attached to that

YET TRYING TO DEAL DIRECT.
Some Significance Attached to the
Meeting of Sir Julian Pauncefote
and Senor Andrade.
NEW YORK, N. V.. March 14.â A Her
ald special from Washington says: There
is absolutely no foundation for the report
that the United States andÂ« Great Britain
have come to a definite and satisfactory
settlement of the Venezuelan controversy.
That there will be an amicable settlement,
however, no one familiar with the case has
the slightest doubt.
- It is believed that Lord Salisbury is
.wavering in his position against arbitra
tion, but at the same time it is thought
he has â¢ not abandoned the hope of reach
ing a- settlement directly with Venezuela.
'< In this connection considerable impor
tance is attached to the recent meeting
here between the British Embassador, Sir
Julian Pauncefote, and the Venezuelan
Minister, Senor Andrade. There is a pos
sibility that this meeting may lead to a
resumption of diplomatic relations be
tween the two countries and eventually to
the settlement of the boundary question.
LONDON, Eng., March 14.â The Venezu
ela Blue Book, issued last week by the
Government, gets scant respect on any
side. The Speaker says that it cannot
suppose that the Blue Book is all that
Great Britain Intends to place before the
Washington Commission. The Govern
ment, it adds/has been served with lam
entable inefficiency.
If this country has to put up with a Na
tional humiliation the blame will rest with
the officials of Downing street.
The St. James Gazette says that there
ply made . in the House of Commons last
night by Sir Richard Webster, the Attor
ney-General, in response to a question
asked by Sir E. T. Gourley relative to the
alleged misquotations in the Blue Book
does not vindicate the British case as pre
sented. It adds that there has been no in
tentional garbling of the evidence, but
that it is impossible to deny that there
was carelessness in the preparation of the
work. This has created the belief that the
Blue Book is less cogent and convincing in
favor of the British claim than it really is.

BADLY SWINDLED
Bold Schemers With Plenty
of Capital Make a Big
Haul.
ROYAL NETTIE BEATEN.
But Bets Aggregating Thousands
of Dollars Are Promptly
Paid.
THE WRONG RESULT IS WIRED.
Success of a Daring Plan That Started
at the New Orleans Race-
Track.
CHICAGO, 111., March 14.â One of the
most extensive and successful swindles in
the history of racing in the United States
was perpetrated on the poolroom keepers
of the country to-day. The conspirators
had agents in every city where gambling
on racing is cairied on, and money was
placed with a freedom which indicates
that the schemers were backed with all
the capital necessary to make the fraud a
gigantic success.
That their plans were carefully laid is
evinced by the fact that money was dis
tributed by telegraph from New Orleans
and Chicago twenty-four hours in advance.
The last race at New Orleans was selected
as the medium for the fraud. When the
race was finished the news was flashed
from the track all over the country that
Royal Nettie won.
Soon after the bets had been paid, the
suspicions of the bookmakers were
aroused, but it was more than an hour
after the race had been won that they
learned that Plug had come in first. In
Chicago Royal Nettie was played heavily
in .every poolroom in town, and it is be
lieved that the agents of the conspirators
secured from $15,000 to $18,000.
Owing to the reticence of the poolroom
managers, who refuse to talk on the sub
ject, it is impossible to give the exact loss.
One room was hit to the extent of $8000
and another lost $4000. .
To all appearances here the race was run
legitimately, and it was not until some
minutes after the official result was re
ceived and the poolrooms had paid their
bets that a flash message was received by
them stating that something was wrong
and ordering a delay in the payment of
bets that anything wrong was suspected.
It is said that $5000 was sent to Louisville
from here last night to play on the race,
and $1000 was telegraphed here from New
Orleans to be played.
The first odds from New Orleans quoted
Royal Nettie at 12 to 1 and she was nibbled
at by the piKers. When the second bet
ting came in, giving Nettie at 8 to 1, show
ing that she was being played at the track,
ibc agents of the swindlers began putting
I heir money on and kept it up until the ,
liorses were off. One of the large rooms
Ilrj. ,-. .._,iÂ» ...Â» ,v. j .ucy CUimx pCT,
but had to cut the odds to 3 to 1 at the
post. The conspirators are not known
here, and it is not believed that the rooms
will recover a cent of the money paid.
NEW ORLEANS, La., March 14.â There
was a fine piece of work done at the race
track here to-day, by which every pool
room in the country was hard hit. The
sixth and last race of the day was won by
Plug, but the official result was changed
by the telegraph operator at the racetrack
to read that Royal Nettie had come under
the wire first. She was a ten-to-one shot,
and this deliberate falsification of the re
sult by the operator was, no doubt, the
consummation of a carefully laid plan by
himself and confederates at various points.
It is stated by telegraph experts that the
wire could not be tapped, as the wire to
the racetrack i 3 what is known as a duplex
wire and an intermediate set of instru
ments could not be put in without attract
ing instant attention.
The Western Union officials are very
reticent about the matter and will not
make a statement, but the foregoing is
gathered from an absolutely reliable
source.
' LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 14.â A1l the
poolrooms were hard hit to-day in the last
race at New Orleans through a shrewd
system of wire tapping. Royal Nettie was"
heavily played in all three rooms, and
when the mare was announced as winner
the bets were promptly paid. The amount
of money lost cannot be learned, but it is
said that the horse was very heavily
played in every noolroom, being backed
down in one room. The poolroom men
did not learn that they were duped until
to.night, when they learned that Plug had
won the race.
The poolroom men are howling, but the
loudest howlers are the ones who had
tickets on Plug and tore them up after the
result was announced.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 14.â There
are no poolrooms in Covington known to
the law, but several institutions of that
character doing a regular business under
cover were hit to some extent by the Royal
Nettie telegram to-day. This information
is gleaned from outside sources not con
nected with the management. How far
local bookmakers were hurt cannot be
learned, but it is believed they Tost but
little. 'â

the standard of 'God's American Volun

purity, and in the center a single large
blue star, typical of truth.
"Centrally placed within the radius of
the star is a white cross,, emblematic of
sacrifice for others. Above the star is the
motto 'The Lord My Banner,' while below

representative of the forty-rive States of

principles of truth represented by the
standard will prevail for all time."
Among the voyagers on the American
line steamer St. Paul, which arrived to
day, were Major Susie F. Swift, Captain
Elizabeth Clark and Caroline Pease, who
are Salvation Army officers. All are
American girls and have been at work the
past few years in England. They were re
cently ordered from international head
quarters to report to Colonel Eadie in this
country. Major Swift is an ex-Vassar
girl, and when asked as to how the rank
and tile of the army in Europe looked on
the recent action of Ballington Booth said:
"The rank and file are absolutely
astounded. They deplore and deprecate
the action of Commander Booth. The
army in England is loyal."

CHALLENGED BY PHELAN.
Representative Linton of Michi
gan Called Upon to Fight
a Duel.
Since He Opposed Appropriations for
Sectarian Schools He Has
Been Threatened.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 14.â Jour
-1 nal special from Washington says : Cap
tain Thomas Phelan, a resident of Kansas
City, well known as a broadsword fighter
and at one time famous as a friend of Ire
land, who was stabbed' in the office of
O'Donovan Rossa by a body of assassins
there in hiding to kill him, has issued a
challenge to Representative Linton of
Michigan to fight a duel at Bladensburg.
Captain Phelan based his challenge on
Linton's connection with the American
Protective Association and with his at
tempt to prevent the unveiling of the Mar
quette statue in the Capitol.
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 14.-Rep
resentative Linton of Michigan is not in
the least disturbed by the letter written
him several days ago by Thomas Phelan
of Kansas City. To a United Press re
porter Mr. Linton this morning said that
since the pronounced opposition taken by
him some weeks ago to appropriations for
sectarian schools his mail has been filled
with letters from cranks all over the coun
try threatening his life. Phelan's letter
was regarded by him as belonging to this
class of communications, and it was con
temptuously tossed into the wastebasket
as soon as its contents had been hastily
scanned. Mr. Linton said that since the
text of Phelan's letter had been made pub
lic through sources other than himself he
might find it advisable to notice it. i
Whether he will do so or not is a question
which he will determine later.

Over Three Thousand Ballots
Cast During the First
Week.
NO WITHDRAWALS ALLOWED.
Changes Are Expected When Sur
rounding Towns Begin to Back
f Their Favorites.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 14.â The
ballots in the voting contest for queen of
the rose carnival were officially counted
at 2 o'clock to-day and again at 7 o'clock
to-night. The big ballot-box was well
filled with jingling envelopes bearing the
names of the forty-odd candidates now in
the race, and the scarcity of small change
ouring the past week is explained. Over
3000 votes were cast during the week, but
as yet the voters have ' contented them
selves with depositing the small silver.
The following list of the twenty leaders
was displayed on the bulletin board to
night: Mrs. L. W. Burris 201, Miss Sara
Hall 190, Miss Adah Hall 183, Miss Millie
Mathews 160, Mrs. Rose Campbell 166. Miss
Rose McMahan 126, Miss Julia Guerne 126,

Adelaide Elliott 71, Miss Florence Speegle
62, Miss Margaret McMahon 71, Mrs. Min
nesota Thompson 71, Mrs. H. J. Kirsh 71,
Miss Frances Phelps 69.
Mrs. L. W. Burris, who leads in the con
test for a floral crown, is the wife of Luther
W. Burris, cashier of the Santa Rosa Bank.
Mrs. Burris was, before her marriage, Miss
Laura Mathews, and is a Santa RoÂ«a na
tive daughter. The cultivated and win
ning manners, high social standing and
great personal beauty of the leading candi
date combine to niaice her very popular
with all classes, and if selected she would
wear the crown with a queenly dignity
that would reflect credit upon herself and
the carnival.
Miss Sara Hall, who received the second
largest vote, is a daughter of James W.
Hall, chairman of the Board of Supervisors
of this county. Miss Hall is a product of
this valley, of the pure blonde type. She
has deep blue eyes, with a thoughtful ex
pression in their serious depths, a com
plexion of dazzling whiteness and clearly
defined yet regular features. Being tall,
erect and graceful, with a shapely form,
Miss Hall is well qualified to grace the
rose-covered throne.
Miss Adah Hall, who received the third
largest vote, is the only daughter of Gene
ral George Hall, director- of the
floral parade. This charming young lady,
who is still in her teens, has the support
of the High School, the Methodist ; Col
lege and, in fact, the whole of the "younger
set." She has large, dark eyes, shaded by
jetty lashes, a clear olive complexion, and
s in every respect a winning type of bru
nette beauty.
Miss Millie Matthews is another of Santa
Rosa's extremely popular â  and beautiful
candidates who is well up among the lead
ers and will poll a large vote.
Many friends of Mrs. Ross Campbell, the
stylish and handsome wife] of Attorney
Ross Campbell, are backing up their
choice with that which speaks louder than
words, and her name is already well up oh
the list.
Miss Rose McMabon is another of the
prominent candidates. She is a niece of
Con Shea, the millionaire cattleman, and,
besides having many accomplishments to
recommend her, . is one of Santa Rosa's
most beautiful girls.
There was a large scattering vote and
many of the ladies tried to withdraw their
names, which would not be listened to by
the committee. It is not definitely known
when the vote will be counted again, and
great changes may be : expected when the
other towns of this county begin to back
their favorites. *: . â¢ :â â â -.'â  ;-'â â â : V

city, has been notified that she is one of
the heirs of the famous Wetmore estate in
Holland/Mrs. John Wetmore, the great

ing a fortune estimated at this time at
$80,000,000. Nearly all the heirs reside in
the United States, and the proceeds of the
estate have been on deposit in an Amster
dam bank for ninety-nine years. Y."
For a long time Mrs. Jenkins has known
that she would some day come into pos-
session of a portion of this fabulous
amount, but she received the first specific
information through an Oakland dispatch,
which stated that the Wetmore millions
were soon to be distributed. Since then
she has been in communication with her
uncles in Oakland and they have retained
a lawyer who is shortly to take his depart
ure for Holland in connection with this
matter.

AFFRAY AT XORTBPORT.
Guards Surround a Prison to Prevent a

NORTHPORT, Wash., March 14.â A
lively shooting affray occurred . here this
evening between Timothy Vogel, ; a gam
bler, and Harry Finnich, a Chicago travel
ing man. Finnich won $350 playing at
craps against Vogel's table. This "broke"
Vogel, who persuaded Finnich to enter a
disorderly house. As soon as they were
inside Vogel drew his revolver and told
Finnich that if the money was ' not re
turned he would kill him. Finnich grabbed
Vogel's revolver just in time to prevent a
bullet entering his heart. The bail passed
through his hand, cut a diamond from his
tie and plowed a furrow in his cheek.
Finnich then drew a revolver and several
shots wore fired without effect. Vogel was
arrested and lodged in jail. There is strong
talk of lynching and the jail is being care
fully guarded. Finnich has the reputation
of being an all-round athlete, and is better
known in the East as the "Arkansas Kid."
Vogel is a notorious gambler. V

FIGHTING FOR
MILLWOOD LAND
Prominent Marin County
People Placed Under
Arrest.
FENCES ARE TORN DOWN.
One Woman Accused of Having
Removed a Government
Landmark.
TRIUMPH OF A SQUATTER.
Holds the Fort Despite Repeated
Attempts to Drive Him From
the Tract.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 24.â
strife over a small tract of land near 31 ill
wood, on which Caspar J. Gardner "squat
ted" some time ago, and whence he still
holds forth, resulted in a series of arrests
to-night. On warrants sworn to by Gardner,
Hugh Boyle, Mrs. C. Boyle and Jessie Def
enbach were taken into custody for unlaw
ful assembly. They went before Justice
Fottrell and were released on their own
recognizance.
The warrant charges this trio with the
destruction of property. Late this after
noon they had repaired to the disputed
tract, and for the third or fourth time
began to tear down the fences erected by
Gardner. After their arrest constables
were sent to guard the property.
In addition to these arrests a warrant
has been issued for Hilario M. Reed Ly
ford. Peter Gardner is the complainant,
and accuses the woman of having removed
a Government landmark between the
Rancho Corte de Madera del Presidio and
a tract of public land at Millwood.
These suits are but the beginning of a
series of legal battles growing out of the
contest for this land. Many of the most
prominent people in southern Marin
County are involved. The tract i-> a trian
gular-shaped piece of property just below
Millwood that is not on the maps as owned
by any person." Three different Spanish
grants come together, and their boundaries
are so arranged that a strip of over seven
acres is left without an owner.
Gardner, knowing this situation, built a
small cabin and "squatted" on the land,
claiming that as there was no owner it was
Government property and could be treated
as such.
Dr. Lyford, the guardian of the Defen
bach heirs, hearing of the invasion sent a
gang of men to fence in the property, but
as fast as they put the stakes for the fence
into the ground Gardner pulled them out,
and the fence was not built at all.
Then Gardner tried to erect a fence
around the land he had squatted upon,
but he met with an unusual reception, for
the womenâ the Lyfords, the De ecbacha
and the Boyles â over in a body and
knocked the fence down.
Dnring this raid a Government monu
ment used as a. landmark was carried
away, and this resulted in the warrant for
Mrs. Lyford being issued.

Trying to Prevent the Seizure of an Aye-

MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 14.â A1l
day a watch has been kept upon the men
employed by the California Construction
Company in the building of the Mill Val
ley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railroad
to see if they attempt to plow up Corte
Madera avenue in front of tlie Mclnnes
property. No attempt was made, although
the road just above the lands of J. H. Mc
lnnes has been graded and put into readi
ness to receive the rails which have ar
rived.
Secretary Louis L. Jane of the Mill Val
ley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railroad
Company was to-day .-served with a notice
from the law firm of Muiiany, Grant &
Cushing to the effect that they have been
retained by the Mill Valley Property-own
ers' Association to take l*gil proceedings
against the electric road ami the California
Construction Company it any attempt to
gain possession of Corte Madera avenue is
made.
All day yesterday surveyors and others
connected with , the mountain road were
attempting to move the line of the road
away from the Mclnnes property on Corte
Madera avenue. The tracks, as they ore
now mapped out to run, wou'd come
within a foot and a halt of the sidewalk of
George Anker's property on Corte Madera
avenue. They would almost cross the
sidewalk of Jacob Gardner's property on
the same street. Mr. Gardner learned this
fact to-day, and as he is the Supervisor
from this district and the roadnias.er alio
he is quite surprised; .
The Mill Valley Property-owners' Asso
ciation is determined that the road shall
not run upon CorteMadeia aveniu at ul!.
and if any attempt is made to run' on thai
street an injunction will 'b â¢ p-ocurcd, and
every man turning a shovellul of dirt wi.l
be arrested. .

CAPTAIN HOOPER AT SEATTLE.
The Former Commander of the Bering Sea
Fleet Favors the Extermination
of the Seals.
SEATTLE, Wash., March Captain
C. L. Hooper, who was in command of the
Bering Sea fleet last year, arrived in the
city to-night from San Francisco, his mis
sion being to superintend repairs on the
revenue cutters Wolcott, Cor.win and
Grant, now in course of overhauling at the
Seattle drydock. These vessels will proba
bly be in readiness for sea by the Ist of
April. It is the intention, so Captain
Hooper stated to-night, to have the Bering
Sea fleet, which will consist this year of
the revenue cutters Wolcott, Corwin, Bear,
Rush, Perry and Grant, sail from Port
Townsend on April 26, so as to arrive in
Bering Sea about May 1, when the closed
season. begins. Concerning the seal ques
tion Captain Hooper said:
"If seals cannot be protected, I certainly
am in favor of the bill now before Con
gress, which provides for their extermina
tion. Bering Sea and its seals, by right
and justice, belong to the United States,
and if the seals cannot be longer protected,
they should be killed under the direction
of our Government, as provided by this
bill.
"Under the recent condition of affairs,"
Captain Hooper concluded, "Canadian
pelagic sealers are reaping the most benefit
from the Bering Sea seal, while we derive
but little."
Captain Hooper said he had not been
advised as to whether he would be ordered
to command the Bering Sea fleet again
this year. '

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 14.â The preliminary gentlemen's
teams tournament came to an end this
morning when Guy Cochran, '96, was de
feated in the finals by Picher, '98. The
scores, 9-7, 7-5, give an idea of the merits
of the game. Cochran put up an unusu
ally careful game and until meeting Picher
had taken most of his previous games with
little trouble, but Picher proved himself
the better player this morning. The win
ner, however, did not put up "as good a
game as be is capable of playing. In the
present I tournament he met and defeated
Harry Hazzard '97, one of the best players
here," by score of 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
The tennis management has determined
to hold another tournament before the in
tercollegiate match. Freeman' '99, will en
ter in the; championship tournament and
will give Picher a try. for first honors.
Last September in the championship tour
nament of Southern California held at
Santa Monica, Freeman took second place.
At that time he defeated Picher, but their
play is very nearly on an equality. Both
ihese men have played together in doubles
for a number of seasons and make an un
usually strong team.

CLARKSON AT
LOS ANGELES.
The Republican Statesman
Discusses Presidential
Candidates.
STRENGTH OF ALLISON.
He Says the Hawkeye Senator
Will Receive Powerful
Support.
LIKED IN WEST AND SOUTH.
McKinley Has the Hurrah, but That
â¢ Does Net Always Carry the
Election.
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., March 14.â
Allison boom made itself felt in Los An
geles to-day upon the arrival of Hon. J. S.
Clarksou, who is championing the Hawk
eye statesman in bis race for the Presi
dency of the United States. Ciarkson es
tablished himself at the Westminster Ho
tel, where he received many local Repub
licans during the day. Adherents of Mc-
Kinley and other candidates, as well as
Allison supporters, called to pay their re
spects and gel in touch with the man who
wields such a powerful influence in the
politics of the country. Speaking of Al
lison's candidacy. Ciarkson said:
'*! am for Senator Allison for President,
because 1 believe he would make the
strongest candidate and the best Presi
dent that tne Republican party could
nominate. He is not a one-idea man, but
a thoroughly qualified statesman. He has
been in Congress thirty -one years and was a
contemporary of Lincoln and his asso
ciates in the earlier part of Republican
history. He participated with Salmon P.
Chase in devising the monetary system
which carried the Nation through the
Civil War and saved the Union. He has
been a member of the Finance Committee
of the Senate for twenty-two years, and in
knowledge of the finances of the country
has no equal except Senator Sherman. _ .
"He was recommended by Blame to Pres
ident Garfield for Secretary of the Treas
ury, and in fact the secretaryship of the
treasury has been offered to him by three
Republican Presidents. He was the au
thor of the administrative act accompany
ing the McKinley tariff bill, a part requir
ing a most intimate knowledge of Govern
mental details.
"When Blame was endeavoring to ex
cite interest in his reciprocity plan he
could hardly get leading Republicans to
accept the idea. Even McKinley was op
posed to it. Allison and Aldrich were the I
only Senators who agreed with Blame at
the start and assisted him in getting the
reciprocity feature incorporated in the
McKinley bill. In 1888 the Re
publican party promised to revise the
tariff, and Blame had prepared
a revision of the old tariff, he thinking
it unwise to make an entirely new bill, like
the McKinley bill, which raided the price
of nearly all manufactured articles so that
every woman who purchased a tablecloth
or a napkin was confronted with an ad
vance in the price of the article. That's
what lost us Congress in 1592 and event
ually the Presidential election in 1894.
"Senator Allison represents a National
policy which covers and fosters the agri
cultural and mining industries of the West
as well as. the manufacturing industries of
the East. He has been in politics in lowa
for forty years and during the whole of
that time never lost a friend and never had
a faction in the party in that State. Party
leaders are generally favorable to him
because they believe he would build up
the party while building up the coun
try. They while building by the coun-
They believe be would by a wise arid
tactful policy keep the party in .power
eight, twelve or sixteen year 3. General
Harrison was a great President, but a poor
party President. V ..Â»-.
"The Associated Press is sending dis
patches all over tbe country which would
indicate that McKinley is a very much
stronger candidate than he really is. much
nger candidate than he really is. One
of he leading officers of the Associated
Press is one of McKinley's managers and
the dispatches are given a strong McKin
ley coloring. It is . not always' the candi
date who has the hurrah who makes the
strongest nominee at an election.. They
say that the 'bosses' arc against McKinley.
Those who are called 'bosses' are leaders
whose experience has taught them that a
party idol is more than likely to be the
weakest candidate.
"Allison is not a demonstrative man, but
he is a wise and safe' man. There is not a
man in Congress, unless it be Senator
Morgan of Alabama, who understands the
details of government like Senator Alli
son. His opinions upon financial ques
tions are held in high esteem, not only in
this country, but in Europe. -He is not a
free-silver man, but he is a bimetallist,
and in the International Monetary Con
gress his arguments in favor of ! the joint
"use of silver and gold were received with
the greatest respect. ; . Rothschild said
that there was .not another American
whom he ever heard, speak so understand
ing^ noon monetary subjects. He has
the training of a statesman. â -
"The Associated Press is giving out the
idea that Allison has no strength in the
South, but it will be compelled to acknowl
edge its mistake at St. Louis, ldo not
think that McKinley has more than 100
votes in the Southern' States. Many lead
ing colored men are with us. .
. "Allison is a man of the people. Not
a stain ever attached to his name. He
lives in the same little house in Dubuque
he moved into when he brought his wife
from Ohio thirty-rive years ago, and his
fortune consists of a small competency,
amounting to perhaps $25,000 or $30,000*'.'.
Ciarkson left for San Francisco this
evening. His traveling companions are
Senator Andrews of Pennsylvania, Major
E. M. Ford and E. A. Barnes of New York.

MODESTO RANCHER'S PLAINT.
j Canty Is Now Sorry That He Relented and
Fed the Weaker of McCarty's
â  - t Horses.
MODESTO, Cal., March "White
Hat" McCarty left Modesto this afternoon
to again visit the starving horses over
which there has been so much trouble. J.
M. Canty, the owner of the pasture, was in
Modesto to-day. McCarty and Canty were
very bitter toward each other and threats
of legal proceedings were made freely by
both. â¢
Canty complains that McCarty distorts
his statements and actions, and says Mc-
Carty promised to take away the horses
over two months ago. After the last fail- '
ure of McCarty to keep his promise, Canty
I says he concluded to quietly and secretly
' feed the weaker portion of the stock, do
j ing it secretly for fear that McCarty, find-
I ing that the stock was being feu, would re-
I fuse to remove them. He left enough in
the barren pasture to hold McCarty to the
contract, and says he did not give him a
load of hay. McCarty offered to buy it,
but when it was furnished showed no in
clination to pay. He had ordered his hired
men to separate and feed the weaker horses
before knowing McCarty was coming to
the ranch, but he says he feels sorry now
that he did anything to help the beasts.
Canty laughs at the threats of a damage
suit, and says he will make a present to
McCarty of half the amount of the judg
ment if any is obtained against him.
TRAGEDY NEAR BANNING.
Miners at Twenty-Nine . Palms
Quarrel and Two Are
Killed. â¢
Their Slayers Claim They Were First
Attacked and Fired in Self-
Defense.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., March 14.â Dis
trict Attorney and Coroner were notified
this morning to go to Banning and con
duct an inquest over the body of two
miners, named Robert Conover and James
Roof, who were killed on Thursday by P.
R. Nicholson. The details of the murder
are meager, owing to the isolated section
in which the murder took place.
It appears the two men and their sub-
Sequent murderer, as well as a brother of
the latter, were partners in a mine located
about ninety miles east of Bamiing, near
a place called Twenty-nine Palms. The
men were about to dissolve partnership,
and a row resulted over the division of
property. P. K. Nicholson says that Con
over and Hoof attacked J. J. Nicholson, C.
Conover using a gun and Poof a pick
handle.
Nicholson was knocked down and shot
in the arm. P. R. Nicholson then at
tempted to separate the men, and was in
turn struck with the club by Roof. Nich
olson then procured a Winchester rifle
j and shot both Conover and Roof dead. J.
! J. Nicholson, who was shot in the arm, is
I dangerously hurt and came near bleeding
to death before medical aid could be se-
I cured.
The Nicholson brothers started at once
| for Banning, where they surrendered to
i Constable Carpenter of that place. â¢,â¢â â 'â â 
V The bodies of the dead men were brought
i to Banning yesterday.
Another account of the affray is to the
I effect that the murdered men were
: working a claim, when the Nicholsons
, came along and a light ensued over the
I ownership of the mine. The Nicholsons
j ordered Conover and Roof away. This
! order they declined to obey, and the-shoot
ing resulted. Roof and Conover were for
mer residents of Pasadena. The Nichol
sons are expected here to-morrow in
charge of officers.
CARSON TRIAL NEARING AN END.
All -^Evidence in â  the John T. Jones Case
' Has Been Taken â The Defendant-
' on the Stand,
, CARSON, New, March 11.â The testi
mony in the trial of John T. Jones, the al
leged bullion thief, closed to-day. Jones
was- on the stand, but made no explana
tion'of where he secured the, large sums of
money he spent in the .'last three years.
George 'McLaughlin testified in rebuttal,
and swore as an expert that the molds in
which the bogus melt was made bad been
used a great deal since the bogus melt was
run off. Jones swore that he invented the
method of keeping consolidation melts,
but when shown a consolidation melt ac
count kept years before he came into the
mint, admitted his mistake. Hofer, the
ex-superintendent, denied that a shortage
had existed during his administration, and
disclaimed all responsibility for his bonds
men. On cross-examination he admitted
that he had not assayed the bars in settle
ment, and also that there "was no way of
telling value except by assaying. ....
At the close of the testimony the case of
Henry Piper, charged with stealing bullion,
at the. mint, was set for March 25, and a
Grand' Jury was ordered drawn. â¢ The case
of Coffin," the , attorney charged with run
ning witnesses out of the State in the
Heney trial, will be presented. ' 'â 
WILD HORSES MM OREGOX.

PORTLAND, Or., March 14. âH. S.
Merrill of Eastern â¢ Oregon says that
portion of the State is overrun by use
less horses which are becoming wild as no
one cares to feed them and they are turned
loose.
"Up to a short time ago," said Mr. Mer
rill, "we thought, that the horse-meat in
dustry down here would furnish a market
for our surplus stock. ; But as that scheme
has proved a- failure we are at a loss - to
know what to do with the animals. > There
are 100,000: horses in Eastern Oregon that
can't be given away, and > we can't afford to
Jet them run wild upon the 'ranges v for
they will breed so fast that the country
will be ruined by them. The only solution
to this problem I see now is that we will
have to kill off 50,000 to 100,000 headland
use the carcasses for fertilizing purposes."

PRECEDENT IS PUT ASIDE.
Democratic Editors Appeal to Wash
ington Authorities Against the ;
Unfairness.
FRESNO, Cal., March 14.â ConsiSering
the records of some of President Cleve
land's Cabinet officers and many of his ap
pointees in disregarding plain provisions
of the laws of the land and construing
other Jaws to suit their convenience and
disposition, S. P. Patrick, register of the
Land -Office at Visalia, must be a man
after Grover's own heart. According to
reliable information Register Patrick has
not only disregarded an explicit and man
datory law respecting the publication of
homestead final proofs, but an unbroken
chain of precedents at the Visalia office as
well. -Y;:Y : ;
Itis'the custom to comply with the law
in publishing notices of final proof in
newspapers printed nearest the land de
scribed in the settler's application. Regis
ter Miller, who conducted the affairs of
the Visalia Land Office during Mr. Cleve
land's first term, rigidly adhered to the
plain provision of the law, regardless of
the politics or other predilections of the
"newspaper published nearest to the land
described." M. J.Wright, Mr. Harrison's
appointee, followed the example of Regis
ter Miller and his other predecessors at
the Visalia office.
It remained for Patrick to find a way to
violate this law and at the same time hold
on to his office. The tegister's conduct in
this particular has been the means of
bringing down upon his official head the
maledictions of a half dozen editors. Some
of these newspaper men are stanch Demo
crats and Patrick will hear from them in
tones loud and long. Editor Dewey of the
Lemoore Leader is in the vanguard of this
fight against Register Patrick.
The first discrimination made by Regis
ter Patrick occurre d soon after his induc
tion into office, ana was against the Le
moore Leader, a weekly newspaper then
conducted by Gill & Son. The senior
Gill had in some manner incurred the dis
pleasure of Patrick, and the latter sought,
it seems, to get even with the editor, by
denying him the privilege of publishing
any land notices, regardless of said land's
contiguity to Gill's newspaper/ "" V
.Gill & Son subsequently sold the Leader
to Wilbur T. Dewey who, soon after he
took charge, reminded Register "Patrick of
his duty and- the Jaw in the case.' The
Register disregarded Mr. Dewey's request,
and instead of awarding him the advertis
ing placed it in the Hanford Democrat, a
paper which had been ' launched in the
meantime.
It was then that Editor Dewey made his
complaint to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office at Washington, D. C.
Since that time the contest of authority
and opinion has been kept up between the
gritty editor and Mr. Cleveland's register
at Visalia. -Y?H- r ;:
Having established his . own precedent
and put his own construction on the law in
the case, Patrick did not hesitate to dis
criminate against other country news-
papers in his district which had just
claims upon the' register's consideration
by being published nearest the land de
scribed. Among these are the Delano
Courier, Traver Advance, Tulare County
News, -Kern County Californian, Exeter
Penny Press and the Hanford Sentinel.
The editors of all these newspapers are
preparing an onslaught upon Register Pat
rick,, who will find his official path any
thing but "downy" in the future. .
Whether the claims of these gentlemen
will have any effect at Washington is
problematical. The next issue of their
journals . will contain some "mighty
interestin' readin' " for Register Patrick
and the Land Office Department . at' Wash
ington. %e9H6BBpI&
' The settlers,. too, whose interests are at
stake and whose titles may be clouded by
the proceedings of Register Patrick, are up
in arms over the matter, and are denounc
ing that gentleman in unstinted terms. '
In support of his position Register
Patrick in his correspondence with the
department at Washington referring to
Editor Dewey of the Lemoore Leader and
his brother, F. V. Dewey of ' the Hanford
Journal, used this language: >
"The Leader never has been, is not now
nor can be a Democratic journal while
controlled by any member of the Dewey,
family. They are a lot of journalistic
freaks and have no political convictions."
When it â¢is remembered that Editor ;F.
V. Dewey controls one of the \ stanchest
Democratic journals in the San Joaquin
Valley and himself is a; member of the
Democratic State. Central Committee, the
allusion to that gentleman may be ! re
garded somewhat strange.
The case as it now stands before the Land
Office at Washington may be very accu
rately determined by Mr. Dewey's latest
communication,' with accompanying ex
hibits, to the Land Commissioner. ".' In the
course of the communication Mr. Dewey
says: gg^JJMM
Mr. Patrick probably Indulges In a joke when
he says that, by virtue ' of : seven years' experi
ence fas publisher of the. Tulare Times he be
came well acquainted with the status of ' all
papers; published in Tulare and adjoining
counties, and then, by way' of â  illustration,"
shows how well he was acquainted with* their
standing for "character and stability" by ad
mining that before he had published one final
proof notice the requisite number of times one
of : the papers in which he \ ordered \ the said
notice published died of newspaper fits by an
overdose of '-public ' pap", from his office, and
another one (the Review) : to \ whom J he . gave
patronage died only six months later.
In conclusion, we inclose you herewith sworn
proofs as against Mr. Patrick's mere assertions,
on the two questions upon which i the : case at
issue rests, viz.: Is the Lemoore Leader a paper
of ; general circulation, and has it the proper
financial backing \ to \ Insure the publication of
final proof notices in accordance with the law?,

the Supervisors of Tulare County, that the

WOODLAND, Cal., March 14.â William
Smith, who is serving a sentence in the
County Jail for burglary, and James How
ard, a tramp, who is doing a long term,
made a break for liberty yesterday... It
is the jailer's custom to work the prisoners
in the courthouse yard, and it was thus
while engaged that they took advantage of
the guards. Howard was easily captured,
but Smith ran nearly three miles and was
made a target for the jailer's pistol before
he was finally overhauled.
Both prisoners resumed their labors in the
afternoon. Smith was ordered to cut
brush and was using a hatchet in the work
when he startled his fellow-prisoners by
deliberately chopping off three fingers of
the left hand. His reason for committing
the act was, he said, to avoid work. In
this he will De disappointed, for as soon as
his condition will allow he will be com

HAPPY VALLEY INCENDIARISM.
Arrest of a Ranch Employe on a Charge of
Having Destroyed His Employer's 'â "
Residence.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 14.â The
investigation by Sheriff Besse and District
Attorney Lindsay of the reported incendi
ary tire in Happy Valley has resulted in
the arrest of John T. Smith on complaint
of his employer^ W. 'H. â¢ Duke. Smith ,is
the man who told the story of having
surprised a man lurking about the premises
on Wednesday night. â¢
Smith's story, which is believed by the
officers to be a fiction, was embellished to
day by some extraordinary statements
which "caused the officers to suspect him,
and in addition to this a thorough investi
gation of the premises disclosed the im
probability of his tale.
Smith said that after he shot the in
truder' the fellow vaulted a picket fence,
and he described with wonderful accuracy
the appearance and . dress of the alleged
incendiary, although the night was dark,
saying he wore a black cutaway coat and
negligee shirt, was smooth of face, with a
slight mustache, if any.
He explained how the : barn could have
been opened, and got an iron bar, claiming
that it was the instrument used. The, in
spection of the burnt portions of the house
lea to the belief that the fire was started
by some one from the inside of the. build
ing and near the window of Smith's room:
Smith was held in $5000 bonds, which he
says he can get. He adheres to his story
and will have a chance to explain in court.
SPOKANE BURGLAR'S FATE
Frank Robinson Slain by an
Accomplice to Prevent a
Confession.
Driven to Crime by Poverty, a Car
penter's Midnight Raid Ends
in His Death.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 14.â The body
of Frank Robinson, an old resident, of
Spokane, was found by a bootblack on
Boone avenue this morning. Driven: to
desperation by poverty, he" had turned
burglar, been wounded while looting a
residence and his partner in crime had
closed his lips forever to prevent the con
fession he might have made when found
where he had fallen after the bullet fired
at him by the man whose house he was
looting had pierced his body. His mur
derer is believed to have been, like him
self, a man respected in the community
and fear of exposure caused him to turn
assassin.
About 1 o'clock this morning William
Holcomb, who lives on Boon avenue,
heard some one in his house. He got up,
and found that burglars had just left after
taking everything of value that they
could find. . He at once telephoned
to the police and went back to
bed. Not half an hour later a resi
dent named Mann, living across the street,
was awakened by some one in his house.
He got up very quietly, and saw in the
next room a man going through a desk,
using a match for a light. Mann raised
his revolver and pulled the trigger.
The burglar fell to the floor exclaiming:
"Oh, my wife and children, what will they
do!" -
, Mann, fearing the intruder was sham
ming, sent his wife to. call the ; police, and
himself kept out of .range. Suddenly the
burglar jumped up and jumped through
an open window. \ Mann's shot had passed
through his left breast. â â ..'
â  When tne Doay 01 the Burgiviv--^v,
proved to be Robinson, was found -this
morning, there was a second wound, a
bullet Having passed through his skull.
He had also been choked.
Then the police agreed that, while dying
or seemingly dying from â¢ the wound in
flicted by Mann, he had been murdered by
his accomplice.
Robinson had for years been engaged
in carpentering here. He was considered
honest and industrious, but of late had
been unable to secure employment, i and
his wife and four children were in distress.
This drove .him to crime. The widow is
almost crazed with grief.
XUGGETS FOUXD XEAB KELSEY.
Chunks of Pure Metal Taken From a
Four-foot Ledge.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., March John
C. Murphy, who dwells with, his sister. on
a ranch near Kelsey, occasionally does
ground sluicing, wording toward a four
foot ledge that finds its way out of the hill
into the little creek. This has proven a
bonanza to him. On January. 29 he took
from his sluice-boxes $1600 in nuggets, the
smallest worth $30 and the largest $600. A
week ago yesterday, while working the
boulders from the riffles, he found upon
his sluice-fork a chunk of yellow metal
which, upon examination, was found to be
one-half ounce of quartz imbedded in fifty
five ounces of pure gold, in one solid
chunk.

Feted and Feasted in the Temple

NOVITIATES CROSS THE SANDS
Thirty Reach the Golden Mecca and
Quaff at the Fountain of
Zem-Zem.
â¢ SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 14. -The
Caravan of Islam Temple, Nobles of the
Mystic Shrine, arrived in this city from
San Francisco shortly after 6 'o'clock this
evening, and was greeted by the local
members of the tribe, who, in company
with the Second Infantry band, had
marched out upon the desert to meet the
incomers. Over sixty local wearers of the
fez were in line, and the incoming caravan
was escorted to the Golden Eagle Hotel
for dinner, after which all adjourned to
the Temple. There, thirty novitiates, in
fear and trembling, awaited their coming
to begin the journey across the desert,
whose glowing sands they were to tread
with unsandaled feet, and whose lofty
pyramids they fain would climb on bended
knees in the hope that they might be
allowed to quaff deep draughts of the
fizzing waters of the fountain of Zem-Zem.
The caravan was under the immediate
direction of Illustrious Potentate Charles
L. Patten, who was supervised by the im
perial potentate of America. Charles L.
Field and upward of a hundred pilgrims
accompanied the long train of salt- laden
Camels to the green and glowing oasis of
Sacramento. What happened to these
fearless yet trembling pilgrims is only
known to themselves and those who, in
former years, have likewise been bound
with ropes and led blindfolded and bare
foot across the redhot sands.
After their perilous journey those who
had not fallen by the wayside had their
wounds dressed and oil poured over their
blistered feet and were led beneath the
tali palm trees of the banquet hall and had
their shattered nerves soothed with copious
refreshments. Then they were regaled
with sun-dried dates, while strains of
dreamy music filled the air.
Ttie costume of the Sbriners was full
dress suits with red fezes, embellished in
front with tbe silver emblem of the order â
the scimeter and claws. The novitiates
dressed at will.

TEARS IX A PORTLAXD COURT.
A. Murderer Breaks Down When His
Doom Is Pronounced.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 14. â Judge
Stephens this morning sentenced to
life imprisonment Theodore J. Luebeck,
who last month stabbed William Solomon,
a family friend, to death. When asked if
be had any reason to give why sentence
should not be passed, the murderer could
hardly keep on his feet, so nervous was he,
and the tears streamed down his cheeks.
His wife and children were present, and
they joined in the weeping spell, which
affected every one witnessing the scene.
' Luebeck began to speak, mumbling mere
to himself than to any one else, but his re
marks were incoherent. Those persons
near the man heard him uttering some
thing about his wife and Solomon. When
he beard his doom pronounced he cried
out in a most audible tone: "I can't stand
that; I'd rather go to the gallows and be
done with it." ,
He was at once removed from the court
room, and ; his moans were heard until the
heavy iron county-jail " door beneath the
courtroom prevented his voice being heard
on the outside.
EXHUMED AT FORT TOWXSEXD.
Bodies of United States Soldiers to Be.
Interred at Benicia.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 14.â
Instructions have been received here to
prepare for transfer to the army barracks
at Benicia the remains of twenty-nine
United States soldiers interred in the re
serve known as Fort Townsehd, across the
bay from here. The bodies will be ex
humed and sent first to Vancouver. and
thence to Benicia, where they will be per
manently interred. The instructions are
looked upon as a forerunner of . early
preparations to make ready for the six
comnanies of light artillery which are to
occupy the important position, as a result
of the recent indorsement of that site Â» by
the army board of officers sent out to select
the most suitable location on Puget Sound.
DROWNED AT BEXICIA.
Ex-Second Slate. Taylor of the Ship
Dirxgo Metis Death.
BENICIA, Cal.V March 14.â the ar
rival of the steamer Monticello^ last even
ing one of, the â¢ passengers was , noticed .by
the officers to go across the wharf and fall
overboard. Every exertion was made- to
save him, but as the tide runs very /swiftly
at the place where he fell the body was not
recovered until over an hour afterward. .
The Coroner held â :â  an inquest . Friday,
when" it was learned that the name of the
deceased was Bartlett A. Taylor, and that
he had an honorable discharge as second
mate of the ship Dirigo, that arrived in
San Francisco on : the 29th of February.
Appearances indicate that owing to the
darkness his death was due to an accident.
ROSSLAND DISASTER.
Four Miners Killed and Several Injured by
an Explosion at the Center

SPOKANE, Wash., March 14.â A spe
cial from Rossland, B. C, to-night, says-
A terrible explosion occurred here .this
afternoon. A magazine at the Center Star
mine containing several ; hundred pounds
of dynamite blew up, entombing six
miners. Mike Shanahan died while being
taken to the hospital. A man named Col
lins was badly injured and was removed
to the hospital. Joseph Dolan was taken
out dead and W. Brook is fatally injured.
It is reported two more are dead at the
mine.
PUGET SOUXD EJECTMEXTS.
Hundreds of Settlers Ordered to Leave
Government Reserves.
PORT TOWN SEND. Wash., March 14.â
The War Department is now beginning
the enforcement of an order- which will
cause considerable hardship in many
places along the shores of Puget Sound,
and an effort will be made to have the en
forcement again postponed as it was last
year. This is a general order to remove
all trespassers from Government reserva
tions on Puget Sound.
Hundreds of fishermen and small
ranchers are squatted on Government re
serves in this vicinity, and last June an
order came to have them removed
It was shown that it would be a great
hardship on the squatters to enforce the
order, and it was suspended. To-day Lieu
tenant E. W. Clark arrived from Vancou
ver with peremptory instructions to en
force the order of ejectment, and it is said
no opportunity will be given for a remon
strance on the part of the squatters and
their friends. Hundreds of fishermen will
be forced to tear down their shanties and
seek new locations, and they are bitterly
complaining of the Government's action.
It is supposed Congressional action about
coast defenses is responsible for the order.
BID FOR EUREKA'S TRADE
San Francisco and Portland
Representatives Appear
at a Banquet.
Lower Rates From Humboldt County
to the East Are Pledged by
This City.
ETJKEKA, Cal., March 14.-The fifth
annual banquet of the Humboldt Cham
ber of Commerce was held last night. Un
usual interest attached to this affair
because of the Eureka-Portland trade dis
cussion. One hundred and fifty couples
were present. Ex-Mayor Kinsey of the
Eureka Bank acted as toastmaster.
J. N. Gillett, who responded to the toast,
"Our Guests," expressed the unanimous
opinion of the Chamber regarding the
Portland trade question. He said that
despite the fact that our sympathy was
with San Francisco our prosperity was
toward the north. After welcoming Mar
tin. Wallace, the representative of the
Portland Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Gil
lett said he believed that soon after Eureka
had secure *Â»Â»Â»-iÂ«iÂ».i t-Â«*u^ Â-itv. I.*1 .* vÂ« u Â»
"She would be connected with Eastern trade
centers by a line of her own, and owing to
Eureka's westward position the distance
from the coast to the Orient would be
much shortened.
Martin Wallace of Portland affirmed that
Portland had taken the matter in hand in
earnest and would immediately put on a
better and larger boat, which would make
Eureka its terminus. Although terminal
rates could not t>e guaranteed to start
with they would surely come. He assured
the chamber that nothing that San Fran
cisco could do would induce the Oregon
Navigation Company to pull off the
steamer.
D. K. B. Sellers, resident agent of Well
man, Peck & Co. of San Francisco, de
clared that Eureka's emancipation had
come from the south, and read the follow
ing dispatch:
Traffic Association of California to the Cham
ber of Commerce of Eureka: The Central and
Union Pacific railroad companies have agreed
with us to make, from Eureka to the Missouri
River and Chicago, the same rate per 100
pounds on shingles (carloads) as from Puget
Sound to the same destination, and these rail
roads will pay charges from Eureka to San
Francisco, provided that the charge is not
more than $1 50 per ton weight on board cars
at San Francisco. The steamers North Fork
and the Alice Blanchard or the Empire will take
at that rate. _YVV. B. Curtis.
H, H. Bubne, a ship-chandler, spoke on
the Traffic Association, and said that he,
as a representative merchant, preferred to
take the hand that first proferred help and
trust to Portland.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 1896.
QUALITY IN PICTURES.
Jules Mersfelder Paints Some
Strong Impressions of
Nature.
AMBITIOUS OF RECOGNITION.
The Young Californian Artist Talks
About the School Which -In*
spired Him.
Jules Mersfelder, who has undertaken
the distinctive role of exponent of the
quality school of painting, is settling down
to serious and earnest work after what he
himself terms a long period of dreaming.
He has opened a studio in the St. Anne's
building at Eddy and Powell street, and in
the seclusion of this eyrie has painted al
most incessantly for a month, putting on
canvas the ripened knowledge of years and
combining compositions from sketches
with his favorite scheme of "quality."
Already he can show three large and pre-
tentious paintings and quite a number of
small but effective sketches and pictures.
In both his large and small efforts he por
trays marines and landscapes, the latter
being of the impressionist order, with that
mysterious and perhaps uncertain charac
ter found in some of the modern masters
of this school.
Mersfelder is a Californian artist, whose
worK received favorable consideration in
New York some years ago from painters
and patrons of art. An ardent admirer,
it not, indeed, a pupil of Innes, his am
bitions were directed in the footsteps of
the great American painter, and no doubt
it was while following this bent Mersfel
der found inspiration and love for the
"quality" type of painting. â¢ And now
wnen he presents nature on canvas, it is a
picture of moods and impressions which
depend largely on quality for worth and
beauty. Corot's fame came mostly from
Quality â wonderful union of feeling
and expression in color.
"I am making a struggle to stay here in
California and be at home," said Mr.
Mersfelder yesterday, "and that is why I
have endeavored to go beyond myself in
my latest pictures. It is my ambition to
prove that I am worthy of recognition
and support in California, and my soul
has gone into my work. I intend to show
two of my large pictures at the Art In
stitute, as I am desirous of seeing how
they will be regarded by the critics and
art patrons. Certainly there is feeling in
themâ deep feeling as I could com
mand â and as for quality, well, I have fol
lowed Corot and Innes.
The artist says he is a dreamer, and un
doubtedly there is evidence of this fact in
his productions. A day dreamer has the
pleasant muses to woo, poetry and art, and
if he be an artist all the better; he has an

opportunity of conveying his dreams to
impressions of nature â a delightful occu
pation which Mr. Mersfelder declares has
influenced his brush and inspired him to
creditable efforts.
"A Foggy Morning in the Oaks" is one
of the large paintings. At first glance it
resembles Keith, but a second look dis
closes the different technique and treat
ment of color. It is painted in a gray key
and represents an opening among gnarled
and massive trees, with the cold, foggy at
mosphere dominating everything. The
color scheme is in gray-greens deepening
from the misty light to dun shadows,
wnich throw the oaks out in strong relief.
In all, though inclined to be impression
istic, it is a strong picture.
Another characteristic painting with
"quality", as its chief motive is "The
Restless Sea" â a large canvas portraying
the ocean in angry mood. The artist' is
happy enough in his idea of color of ocean .
waves, and strong in his light effects, and
besides the murky, stormy distance, and
overhanging sky are really impressive.
The most striking picture is "Evening
in the Forest." There is in it something of
the earlier style of treatment, attractive in
a way and unconventional, and the subject
offering vast possibilities in the effect of
sunlight bursting through an open space
has been conscientiously studied. A flood
of evening sunshine touches the trees and
reveals some of the colors of autumnal
foliage. This is the center of attraction
for the eye, and it is treated with a lumin
ous brush. Behind are the shadows, blue
and dark, and over all an air of mystery.
TO RELIEVE DIFFICULTIES.
Brosius Has a Bill Relating to the Mon
etary Situation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 14.âRep
resentative . Brosius of ; Pennsylvania has
prepared "a bill to relieve the difficulties
in the monetary situation." First, it au
thorizes the National, banks to issue circu
lation to the par value of their bonds; sec
ondly, it reduces the taxation, of National
bank circulation to V one-fourth of ; 1 per
cent; third, it authorizes the organization
of National banks with a capital stock of
$25,000 in towns of not more than 3000 in
habitants; fourth, it utilizes the $125,000,000
of silver bullion now lying idle in the
vaults of the Treasury by uniting it with
an equal amount of gold which is now in
th** Treasury, making a combined gold and
silver reserve redemption fund of $250,000,
--000, which shall be set apart by the Secre
tary of the Treasury and kept separate and
apart to redeem outstanding legal-tender
notes and treasury notes as they shall be

C APT A IX MUXGER'S CASE.
Lieutenant Ross' ' Charges Regarded as
" Presumptuous and Impertinent. YY
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 14.â The
Call correspondent made inquiry at the
Treasury Department to-day concerning
the case of Captain M unger,' formerly in
command' of the revenue "cutter Corwin,
against whom, charges of â  inebriety/ and
misconduct were preferred by Lieutenant
Ross. â /. V'
There is no doubt; that Captain Hooper
(in command of the Pacific Coast revenue
cutter V fleet and : who V sympathizes ; with
Captain ; Munger) has considerable V in-;
fluence lat \ the Treasury Dep-irtment ; I but
as ide l from this the Treasury/ Department
officials are ; provoked ; at Lieutenant Ross
for presuming ;to . criticise the; action of
Captain Hooper and "the department in
assigning Munger YtoY special service at
Seattle after, the charges < had ; been pre
ferred against him. . -
/ Captain Hooper declined to take any ac
t
tion on " Lieutenant Ross' _ charges agains
Munger. declaring that while Ross', charges
misht . be - true ' Captain Munger's offense
had not been repeated v The Treasury De
partment officials indorsed Captain Hooper
in this and, acting upon i his recommenda
tion, assigned Captain*. Munger ;to Seattle,
in the face of Lieutenant Ross' protest.
The department officials are inclined to
regard Lieutenant ' Ross' persistent criti
cism of Hooper and of the Treasury De
partment for r ignoring the charges made
against Munger as a piece of presumption
and a species of insubordination; and it iv
possible that Lieutenant Ross may be cen
sured for wnac they term his , "imperti
nence." : :: ' 'â ' : '.. '-Yp;* ';â¢
At any event, from what The Call cor
respondent was able to learn at the Treas
ury Department' to-day, it is not probable
that Lieutenant Ross' charges against Cap
tain Munger will receive any further at
tention. *- '
THE PACIFIC RAILROADS.
California's Delegation, With the Exception
of Johnson, Pledges Itself to
Oppose Refunding.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 14.â The
California delegation met to-day in Repre
sentative Loud's committee-room : for con
sultation on Pacific railroad matters.
Those present were: Senators Perkins and
White and Representatives Maguire, Loud,
Barham, Hilborn and McLachlan.
The Morgan resolutions were discussed,
but no ' conclusion reached concerning
them. For the purpose of ascertaining the
sense of those present, the following propo
sitions were submitted â¢ separately, and
unanimously agreed to: : p '
Firstâ That all members of the California
delegations, in both Senate and House, are
pledged to oppose refunding of the Pacific
roads' debts.
Secondâ all members of the California
delegation, in both houses, are pledged to
favor and support foreclosure of Government
mortgages on the Pacific roads and the sale of
the roads and foreclosure to satisfy the mort
gage.
Other propositions were discussed with
out result, but all the members present ex
pressly agreed to the foregoing. ;
The delegation adjourned with the un
derstanding that another meeting will be
called as soon as any plan shall be out
lined or presented by either the House or
Senate committee.
Mr. Bowers was absent to-day on ac
count of sickness, but sent a . letter reit
erating his opposition to the refunding
plan. Mr. Johnson was notified of the
meeting, but did not attend.
There is a rumor in circulation to-night,
which cannot be verified, that the House
Committee on Pacific Railroads ' will re
port the bill recommended by Attorney-
General Harmon, giving exclusive juris
diction of the Pacific - railroads to the
Supreme < Court of the District
of Columbia, and authorizing the
court to determine the rights of the
Government and all other mortgages and
claimants, and to finally and conclusively
adjudicate the title and the lien upon the
Union and Central Pacific railroads.

FRESNO, Cal., March 14.â Saturday,
March 21, is the date fixed for the next
great 'rabbit drive and slaughter in this
valley. In speaking of the coming drive a
West Side- rancher said to a Call corre
spondent to-day:; * l
"The Washington Colony Rabbit-killing
Club has been busy of late preparing 1 and
making as perfect as possible : every detail
connected with the work of gathering the
scourges to their fathers. If Sheriff Scott
will kindly send one or two of his deputies
to keep misguided persons out of the pen

ress, .it J will "be.: successful. The farmers
south and : west of us cast rueful looks on
their vanishing crops, and exclaim in very
vigorous Anglo-Saxon that no man can
grow wheat under the jaws of 100,000 rab
bits." . ,
The Board of Supervisors to-day appro
priated $300 to be expended in purchasing
wire for a fence for.the forthcoming drive.
A committee, consisting of Hon. iVY F.
Rowell, D. W. Smith and H. O. Marshall,
has been named to superintend the pur
chase and construction of the fence. This
sum, it is estimated, will provide for about
five miles of fencing for each line. Word
was received here to-day from the South

cursion rates from San Francisco and other
points Y for*. the event. Notwithstanding
this, a large number of visitors are V ex

HENRY: TILLMAN/'
The pictures and testimonials that have
been given to Mr. Henry Tillman on his
journey through the Pacific Coast were so
numerous that only a few . of them could
be used. V The only reason why the â ; enor-
mous amount of space is used to tell the
people of ) the Pacific Coast of the .) virtues
of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is because
there/are) many druggists, especially
around San Francisco, who) still i continue
to offer people "something 'â  just â ; as /good";
for r Joy's /Vegetable / Sarsaparilla. This
substitution business jis hardly ,) fair and
will sometime or other prove unprofitable."
The public will recognize that it is hardly
just for druggists to endeavor to cause peo-
ple to take something else when they - in-
quire for the native remedy.

their attention particularly to ; the Red

that the method and supervision of select

ers of the committee and the manner in
which these powers should be exercised
by the committee as a whole and by its in
dividual members.
During this discussion, which lasted for
some time and covered the ground pretty
thoroughly, the prevailing consensus of
opinion was that the details of the selec

the local organizations of the party. .
.. It was finally decided that, in order to
give the members of the committee an
opportunity in which to consult the wishes
of the constituents of their various local

and such action was duly taken.

A Proposition - Adopted to Organises
Branch Clubs in the Various Counties.
At the meeting of the State Council of

the California , Hotel yesterday, morning,
Grand Sachem Raleigh Barcar in the chair,
the proposition of organizing clubs
throughout the State was discussed. About
twenty- five members wer e present.
Colonel A. Kinney and M. C. Marsh of
Los Angeles reported relative to the con
dition of things in that section of the State.
It was stated by them that there was a
very favorable outlook for thorough organ
ization of the Democratic party in that
county,- and that the recent visit of Max
Popper and J Louis Metzger had been pro
ductive of much good.
Joseph- Gorman of Sacramento reported
that there were excellent orospects of a
club consisting of 50 or 100 members being
organized there.
W. M.' Gibson of Stockton promised an
organization there of 100 to 200 members.
In this City the local organization wag
reported to be doing active and excellent
work in behalf, of the party.
After all these reports had been discussed
and considered a motion was adopted to
have the grand sachem appoint a commit
tee of three to devise ways and means for
the purpose of organizing Iroquois Clubs
in the various counties.

GAVIN M`NAB BEAT
THE BUCKLEYITES.
The Democratic State Cen
tral Committee and Its
Merry Row.
FOUGHT TILL MIDNIGHT
McNab's Resolution Recogniz
ing the Junta Got
Through.
THE PAETY SPLIT COMPLETE.
W. W. Foote and His Railroad Reso
lutionsâSacramento Gets the
Convention.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee held its meeting yesterday in the bil
liard-room of the California Hotel, and the
expected row between ' the Buckley and
the Junta factions occurred.
Gavin McNab at midnight got through
his resolution bestowing recognition on
the Junta as the "regular" party organi
zation. Mr. McNab feels highly tri
umphant.
The Buckleyites are sore and angry and
they will go right ahead assuming to be
the regular party organization and send a
contesting delegation to the State Conven
tion. he local split in the party is now
made complete and sure. There will be a
Buckley and an anti-Buckley war, with
Sam Rainey fighting Buckley until the
two can agree upon terms.
Chairman Gould was an open and strong
partisan of the McNab faction throughout
the meeting and from now on he will come
in for many kinds of abuse and contempt
from the Buckleyites.
Sacramento won the convention without
opposition and a â¢ convention call was
issued, fixing the date for the convention
as June 16.
It was 2:15 p. m. when Chairman Frank
Gould called the committee to order. He
stated in a few words that the meeting had
been called to determine the time and
place for a State convention, in order that
delegates to the National Convention be se
lected and that Presidential electors and
members of Congress be nominated. This
being the first meeting of the committee
since the last campaign he congratulated
the committee on the election of a Demo
cratic State ticket.

the several district conventions.
â¢ Resolved, That the basis of representation be
fixed at one delegate at large for each county,
and one delegate for each 200 votes or a
majority fraction thereof cast for James H.
Budd for Governor in 1894.
The representation of tbe several coun
ties upon the foregoing basis is- hereby

8, Sutter 5. Tehama 5, Trinity 3, Tulare 10,
Tuolumne 7, Ventura 6, Yolo 9, Yuba 6;
total 614.
Resolved, That members of said State con
vention be selected in such a manner as the
various county committees shall aetermine to
be expedient, the holding of primary elections
tfterelor being recommended wherever practic
able, and that the test for voter ; at such pri
maries be the following:
"Are you a Democrat, and will you support
the nominees of the National Democratic
ticket and Congressmen to be named at the
convention?" .
Resolved, That county conventions called for
the purpose of selecting delegates to the State
Convention are requested to select their coun
ty committees at the same time, and to
promptly forward the list of the names to the
secretary of the State Central Committee.
Resolved, That duplicate copies of the cre
dentials of all delegates selected to the said
State Convention must be certified to by the
chairman and secretary of the various con
ventions and committees and forwarded to
John Markley, secretary of the Democratic
State Central Committee, at Sacramento, at
least ten days prior to the meeting of the said
State Convention.
Then Sacramento was given the conven
tion in short, graceful and unanimous
order.
Shields of Sacramento made the Sacra
mento motion at once, reading letters of
greeting, invitation and . assurances about
convention expenses by Mayor Hubbard
i of Sacramento, the Chamber of Commerce,
; the Board of Supervisors and a committee
i of citizens, and he said some nice things,
including the statement that the water
: was good, which caused a laugh.
Stockton and Los Angeles had suc
cumbed to Sacramento over night, and
representatives of both cities seconded in
nice words the motion which gave Sacra
mento its first Democratic convention in
: seventeen years. By this vote Sacramento
; drew three of a kind, as it were, having
| already gained the Republican and Pop
; ulist conventions of this year.
There was some debate about the date,
beginning with Raleigh Barcar's motion
j that it be June 2. W- R. Burke wanted to
! wait until -the Republicans had made mis
takes, and, finally, the -motion made by
M. J. Laymance that the date be June 16
was carried. It was intimated that the
: convention would run four or five days
and that it would get a chance to hear
from St. Louis, and act accordingly.
F. R. Wehe started a little battle in
favor of Sierra County getting one more
i delegate. He said that he did not re
i member just what the Budd vote was, but
that he knew there were more than 500
Democrats in Sierra County. This was
, very funny. It was decided that the ap
! portionment would depend on the reports
in the office of the Secretary of State, and
j the secretary was given power to correct
the apportionment in the call if it was
NeitherGavinMcNab nor the Buckleyites
closely concerned with the local fight had
taken any special interest in all these pro
ceedings which merely concerned routine
State matters. . Both local sides were wait
ing for the supreme moment of war.
Gavin McNab sat in front, .pale and
nervous and smiling by turns. He was
the head, front and boss of the anti-Buck
ley movement in San Francisco and a
critical moment was at hand. Whatever
damnatory may be said about Chris Buck
ley he is a foeman worthy of the steel of
any Democrat who calls himself a poli
tician and the pending battle was mo
mentous and of uncertain outcome in
spite of the distribution of proxies.
Mr. McNab arose, announced that he
had a resolution to present and he laid on
the secretary's table a folded piece of
yellow paper. It was not read, but the
Buckleyites knew it was something loaded
for them and that the time for conflict was
at hand.
. George R. B. Hayes was already stand
ing and he made the objection that the
resolution could not be regular because
there was other business which regularly
took precedence.
Mr. McNab swore that the resolution
was in order, and General Hayes moved
to adjourn.
â¢ The battle seemed to have opened. x The
hubbub began. The spirit of fierce Demo
cratic conflict could be sensed as pervading
the California Hotel billiard-room. Any
body familiar with Democratic meetings
knows the meaning of that. Each mo
ment may bring an explosion and a Don
nybrook fair or a motion, resolution,
speech, protest or some other pause which
changes like a change by lightning the
course and spirit of events".
Well, it happened that W. W. Foote was
there. He was with the Buckleyites inci
dentally in their local fight, but he was
there for one great and chief purpose, and
that was to get through some anti-railroad
resolutions.
The way the meeting went with all the
hubbub and confusion about Buckley and
the Junta, â¢no California Democrat but
"Billy" Foote would have been likely ;to
get any resolutions voted on at that meet
ing. Mr. Foote jumped to the breach at
the first scent of danger to his opportunity
and all through the meeting, more times
than are recorded in this report, he inter
jected .himself into the Buckley row amid
the motions to adjourn and to do all sorts
of things, and ; with all his fierce aggres
siveness demanded consideration for his
own. He finally won his hard battle, it
may be early mentioned. .
At this first juncture, when George R. B.
Hayes moved to adjourn, he roared that
he had some resolutions about the fund
ing, and fiercely swore that "it would be
cowardly to adjourn without giving an
opportunity for a member to present such
resolutions." .
They did not adjourn and Mr. Foote
waited standing up. George R. Hayes,
assuming that the ; unread resolution of
McNab was anti-Buckley, - : said , that : the
author was trying to get before the com
mittee something . that : was ; beyond ; the
State Central Committee's power and care.
Gavin McNab made his first speech. He
said: V *' p
If others are permitted to speak to this reso
lution, I think I ought to be allowed to speak
to it also. I say that the resolution which I
have presented is eminently proper matter for
the State committee to consider at this time.
It involves a most vital point in relation to the
status and condition of the party in this City
the facing ot the question of Buckley ism in
this City. : - --.? p -
"Good! Good!" said McNabeys. ; Âi
A vote was taken on Hayes' motion fto
adjourn. The vote was nearly eaual,
many members being willing to let pass
the bitter : cup/ but Chairman \ Gould de
clared the motion lost. ' kk%'M
Hayes and the chairman bad a tilt about
what the latter was doing with the meet
ing, ; and then W. W. Foote squeezed in
and grimly. 1 held .to ; the sticking ', point a
motion that a committee be appointed to
prepare resolutions on the pending fund
ing bill, to be reported back to : the com
mittee.-'" "' ' -p : -
Some Buckleyites tried to shove the Mc-
Nab and all other resolutions on that com
mittee, but i the' committee : escaped â -. by a
vote of 50 to 42. YY
, By this time the crowded little billiard
began to - tell on those present/ and
-Mr. Fox started a protest in favor of venti
lation. "â '. Five : minutes * of ..' a: : row about the
hall followed. M. J. Donovan -started \to

crats intererf ed in the proceedings, and he
moved to adjourn to a larger hall.
Gould brought the meeting back to busi
ness and amid difficulties got the resolu
tion of McNab read and forced it before
the meeting in spite of various little
obstructionist tactics. McNab's resolution
was as follows:
Resolved, That the chairman and secretary of
the State committee, in issuing the call for the
selection of delegates to the State convention,
are hereby directed to send paid call to the
committee of which W. P. Sullivan Jr. is chair
man and John H. McGovern is secretary.
This would amount simply to an in- ;
dorsement of the Junta by the State Cen
tral Committee, but it would give the
Junta a prestige in the local war with the
Buckley faction and before the State con
vention when rival delegations arrived.
George R. B. Hayes quickly raised the
point of order on jurisdiction, on which
the Buckleyites count so much, they hold
ing with constant persistence that the
State Central Committee has no initial
right to interfere ; that it may only act as
an arbitration board when two not one
factions request its concern, and that
they are free to disregard any thine the
State Central Committee may do and ap
peal to that higher power, the State con
vention. Said Mrf Hayes: ; / -.-::';
This is a resolution beyond the jurisdiction
of this committee.' The State Central Commit
tee is appointed for the purpose of conducting
the campaign and selecting the next State
Central Committee, and if there be any trouble
and dispute in any county committee it is for
them to settle it for themselves. The attempt
of this committee to settle this dispute in the
absence of mutual consent on the part of both
factions is a piece of impertinence. It is with
out and beyond its functions entirely. It has
no business to take up such a subject unless it
takes it up with the consent of all the parties.
We know what a lamentable result once fol
lowed such an action, even where the consent
of both sides had been obtained. , It is for this
question to be brought up in the State Conven
tion when that body meets. '
Then Gavin McNab replied, saying:
We have a precedent for, this action .in the
action of the State committee four years ago,
when I remember that I assembled with that
body as one of its members, and was one of
the commtttee which appeared before the con*
vention on a similar matter. Mr. Hayes rep
resented the Buckley Bide of that committee in
asking questions and tried to defeat Ban Fran
cisco's real Democratic organization That
was what caused the lamentable result :he
referred t0. .-: But what was the result? Because

being â  chased . from the State to escape the

: There was much cheering from the ( rival
sides as the duel of words went on 'amid
points of order and things. Mr. McNab's
speech above quoted â 'ââ  was interrupted 3 , by
Joseph Rothschild with a point of order
about speaking to the question, and; Mr.
Gould whacked the table and said, .."Sit
down, Mr. Rothschild."
When Mr, McNab said that in. 1892 the
party elected more men than ever on \ the
local ticket, one of the many things heard
in the interrupting chorus. was, "We can't
do it again," and then somebody shouted, â 
"That's a lie." â .'.:â -'-â ".â '-
Pretty soon Mitchell of Los Angeles got
in the following:^
This committee has been called for a specific
purposeâ to put in operation the machinery of
the party by calling a State convention. t This
proposed action is ultra viresâ to go outside of
its legitimate functions by taking up a local
party quarrel in this City. pWe are not here for
the purpose of settling, local differences that
may arise in all the county commltees from
San Diego to Siskiyou, and I for one do not care
to be used as a â¢ catspaw to pull chestnuts out

W. W. Foote and his railroad resolution
were engulfed. <-YY'Y
In interruption of M. J. Donovan, \ who
began an appeal, Chairman -Gould stated
that the matter before the house was the
point of order by G. R. B. Hayes, that the
State Central Committee had no jurisdic
tion to pass the McNab resolution.
There was a "Tah ! Tah IV and more hub
bub, and amid it Donovan strode forward
and excitedly charged the chairman with
having allowed Gavin McNab to digress
in his speech.
Mr. Donovan said, amid the difficulties:
I deny the right of Jurisdiction of this com
mittee and its right to take up or consider
local questions any more than the National
Committee of the United States has the right
to take upon Itself the question of deciding
which is the State Central Committee of this
State. 1 would like to ask the last gentleman
who spoke (McNab) if he supported the Demo
cratic ticket at the last election? (Shouts of
"He did not" from various parts of the hall.]
He referred to the refusal of the ' Demo
cratic State Central Committee to take
any j>art in the trouble between the two
factions in , Sacramento two ; years : ago
unless both parties agreed 'to .arbitrate
through it and abide by its decision.
"W. M. Gibson of Stockton sniffed at San
Francisco party fights in behalf of the in
terior, and his 'speech was punctuated and
rounded by lobby cries and applause.
F. R. Wehe called attention to the call
for the meeting, which provided only for
State Convention arrangements : These
and other . speeches by interior members
displayed a certain \ weariness with San
Francisco Democracy in the interior. Sev
eral speeches were in favor of all sorts of
things and amounted to nothing practi
cally. ',' '-ââ :.
George -R. B. Hayes metaphorically
jumped on Gavin McNab by saying : "The
gentleman who presented this resolution,
and under disguise of discussing a point of
order accused me \of | having at any time
represented Buckley, says i that which is
untrue." ' [Cheers and laughter.] 'â ': *
After awhile Chairman Gould forced his
ruling, amid the excited but profitless dis
cussion, that the point of order . was not
well taken and that the committee " had
jurisdiction to act on McNab's resolution.
About this ' time J. C. Nealon began to
talk, and somebody objected to his right
on the floor. . "I have a proxy," said Mr.
Nealon triumphantly. It ; was produced,
as it came by mail, and Mr. Marsh Was
shown to have received a later proxy from
the member by telegraph. Marsh voted
that . proxy along with . others, and ex-
Assessor Nealon was discomfited.
Robert Boyd got in -one of the many
brief speeches, and- he got â¢in a whack â¢at
McNab by saying: p"I want to remind the
gentleman that he was once on the Demo
cratic ticket and had to come off." p
The point of jurisdiction ' being settled,
McNab's resolution was to the front on its
merits.
; Amid -. the discussion ; Chairman Gould
said : '- : - "There is .: a responsibility â¢ resting
on the chairman and secretary in deciding
what committee " should : receive ', the call,
and I would like to have it settled."
7 Rothschild wanted to refer the resolution
to the next State * Convention ; and George
R.B. Hayes wanted to. hear the author's
reasons '-â  for â¢â  presenting ', it. V This ?: is the
speech Mr. McNab made in support of his
resolution: .' ': .:' ' k- 'vk~ :â â  . '-'. ' > :'â  h - ' .
! "My reason. for offering 'this resolution
at this time is that there are in : San Fran
cisco f to-day N two V organizations setting
forth that ; each -is ; the ; only legitimate
organization of the Democratic party of
this City, and on ; behalf 'of the organiza
tion in whose interest ji ; think the party
has most at stake ;i I* offer this ? resolution,;
and in order that yon may understand the
exact position I will explain the situation."
He then reviewed the history of the local
party organization, c including the occasian
of the formal disruption in Pioneer Hall,
and claimed that he had a certified copy of
the â  minutes f of i that I meeting | attested by
Chairman Watkins, showing that the fac
tion which he represented had adjourned
that meeting sine die and thus put an end
to its existence, and that a new committee,
which he how represented, had then been
properly called into existence. He then
charged Christopher ' Buckley with con
spiring; with certain . members of ' the
old committee to reconvene that commit
tee, which was done. :
"And the committee," he continued,
V was then turned over to . Buckley as an
organization to set -against; that of Mr.
Deuprey, organized on the authority of
the last county convention." He then
submitted the certified copy of the min
utes of the meeting referred to.
George R. B. Hayes then suggested that
in the interest of harmony the call be
issued to both factions.
This met with the approval of Joseph
Rothschild and a motion to that effect was
made by Hayes. But it ; did - not suit
McNab. â 
Rothschild arose to reply and said that
he did not come with any certified copy of
the minutes of a meeting .to prove the
claim of his organization for recognition.
He : saia he had affidavits from 223 mem
bers (a majority) of the old committee to
show that the Metropolitan Hall meeting
was not adjourned sine die and that these
228 took part ,in the ; proceedings that
brought ; into being the committee whose
interests he was present to protect and
which was the legitimate successor of the
old committee. k.&Bgggfgg&sqg&ffi
Rothschild hesitated a - moment in his
speech to look : for a document, and Crush
ing rose and moved the previous question.
Rothschild was plainly yet homing the
floor, but Chairman Gould, ready to force
a vote and shut, off discussion, instantly
recognized tbe motion. ; ; ;;Y
. Here came the critical moment of the
whole meeting. The Buckleyites . were
ready for almost blood at the unfairness.
There was quickly a surging and a roar
and a threatening like the "quick gathering
of a thunder-cloud. V :/-
All was instant disorder and excitement.
The crowd all rose and surged to the front.
There was shouting and shaking of fists.
"No gas rule," shouted Joseph Roths
child. â¢
"I will break this 1 ' party in two," M. J.
Donovan managed to shout above the din.
"Don't turn out the lights; " shouted
some strong-lunged Buckleyite. ,",
"If they want a fight let them have it,"
shouted Jim Neal, the Buckleyite.*
/ "If you want a fight you ; can have it!"
shouted George Browning, starting to pull
off his coat. }'â 'â  â '.:'â â¢ 'â â ': 'p
Rothschild insisted on his right to speak
and to present evidence.
Another motion for the previous ques
tion was made and seconded by Gavin Mc-
Nab and others. V pY
"Mr. Chairman, I was still speaking and
I have the floor," protested Rothschild. .
- "The chair rules that you had finished,"
said Gould. p / ; - ' * v
There was â an ineffectual attempt to ap
peal "â  from * the decision of * the chair and
Rothschild, white with rage, shouted: "I
call on all good Democrats of San Fran
cisco to leave the hall."
â  M. J. Donovan '. and '( others checked the
bolt amid the excitement < and the battle
went on. -: r k-k*'~k--.kk-v? : y kk-kk v.
After five or ten minutes' deafening up
roar and excitement Gould got a rollcall
on the motion Yin l favor â of , the . previous
question, ruling i On inquiry, that â¢: a ma
jority ' could : order V it. p^ During â  rollcall

asked unanimous consent for the report
of the committee, but Gavin McNab ob
jected that his " resolution was : first .? in
order. â  - -.'
k% Pretty soon another hot ; period ; arose
with conflict and stubborn fighting in it,
and Chairman Gould did a Napoleonic
and unexpected thing kby arbitrarily Â» de
claring a recess of ten minutes. ; -.
J The recess lasted; over an hour and both

home. The hotel lobby was crowded with
an interested throng, and uncertainty and
connubiating reigned.
V When proceedings were resumed at 5:35
p. m. a season of motions and discussion'
followed. It was resolved to adjourn to
7:30 p. m. to hold an executive session.
Amid the discussion Rothschild reiterated
that his side would not agree in advance to
be bound by any action of the committee.
W. W. Foote finally got in his commit
tee report, which was as follows: ;
â¢â¢â  Whereas, There is now pending before the
Congress of the United States certain measures
intended to refund the indebtedness of the
Central Pacific Railroad , Company; and,
whereas, it has been asserted in Washington
and elsewhere that a large majority of the
people of the State of California are in favor
of such refunding; therefore, be it v
Resolved, That we, as members of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee of the State of
California, voicing the sentiment of the De
mocracy of the State, declare that, so far as the
Democratic party is concerned, it is practically
a unit against the said refunding measures.
:"- And we further declare that the Democracy
o f this State is In favor of compelling the
Central Pacific - Railroad Company and all
other corporations to discharge their honest
obligations to the Government in like manner
as Individuals are compelled to discharge their
obligations to one another. â -'â -.
That we 'denounce the so-called equities of
the.Southern Pacific Company which have been
voiced by members ot that corporation and its
hirelings for more than twenty years in this
State as a stupendous fraud, only calculated
to catch the ears of the groundlings; be. it fur
ther â  - â¢ -* â â â¢-â  ' - ' /;::â¢-.-:."â¢;â ;
Resolved, That the Democratic State Central
Committee of this State hereby 5 extend their
thanks to the members of Congress and Sena
tors from this State, who have faithfully kept
their obligations to the people, ~ and they: also
extend their thanks to the eight members of
the State Senate of the State of Kentucky who
voted to repeal a charter which permitted the
Southern Pacific Company of Kentucky to
prey upon every State and Territory except
their own.
Mitchell of Los Angeles introduced a
substitute, brief in form, opposing the
funding bill and declaring especially in
favor of the Government ownership of the
railroad. This resolution was by many
taken to be a railroad â¢ play. V- -Y. â¢; -kkv
Foote jumped to his feet and he made
an eloquent ; and impassioned appeal . for
the resolutions. . '
V- Mitchell's substitute was defeated and
Foote's , resolutions were V carried with . a
whoop. Thereupon the committee ad
journed until evening.- â¢ V ' '
'The evening session was long and warm.
A sergeant of : police and four officers were
brought to ~>. the hotel to protect the exec
utive session from the ea^eri crowd of
Buckleyites ready to demand and force ad
mission. The policemen succeeded.
. : The proceedings â¢ opened "? with - the i ap- ;
pointment of | Messrs. Barcar, McGee and
Gibson as a committee to prepare rules for
the State Convention^ to be i presented 'to
the convention for its consideration. . p
'â¢â  Then the Buckley-McNab fight began
and lasted nearly four hours. .;/ â¢ -*z 'â â  V "A-kk
.:. After warm "â â  discussion it was decided to
let each side bring ;in five champions," not
members of j the committee, and to give
each : side ' one â¢ hour ; to :.. present I its \ case,
Joseph V Rothschild ".protesting that â¢' the
proper investigation of the situation would
take V two days.' V The V proceedings -: were
cracked through on this basis. ;
â¢v The Junta opened' its case with a two-"
minute speech by Eugene N. Deuprey. who
made a Drief, matter-of-fact ' statement of
the action of the last 'municipal conven
tion, of " which he I was \ chairman, in t the
creation of V the "Deuprey committee."
He made no argument and took no sides.
W. P. Sullivan took up the story of local
political affairs and i recited -.the ' action iof
the Deuprey, committee in creating a new
general committee, from k which had
sprung the existing organization of which
he is chairman. k
YY Clitus" Barbour followed at length ;in a
forcible and at times eloquent â¢ speech in
.which v he upheld the regularity of f the
Junta 1 organization, and â¢ "roasted" - with
much vigor the Buckley side, Boss Buck
ley and Buckleyism. /" '
- Joseph Rothschild opened for the Buck
ley side and made an effective argument.
. Rothschild < was followed by Reel B.
Terry and J. C. Nealon. . The proceedings
were attended by much excitement.
Finally a motion to table the McNab
resolution was lost by a vote of 58 to 21.
This showed the Buckleyites where they
stood, and they cleared out of the hall in
a body. Then the resolution was adopted
by a vote of 61 to 7, giving Gavin McNab
and the Junta a great, though hard-fought
victory.
V : M. C. Hassett gave a history of the Dem
ocratic party in San Francisco since 1879,
describing the rise and decline of .the
Buckley regime, giving details of alleged
corruptions by the blind boss, and stating
that Buckley had absolute control of the
party from 1884 to 1890.
Mr. Rothschild asked the speaker if he
had not gone to Bucklev's ranch in the in
terest, of a candidate, Mr. Hassett denied
that he had ever gone to see Buckley, and
declared he was under no obligation of any
kind to Buckley. L. Conlan of the Buck
ley committee interrupted to say he was
on Buckley's ranch when the speaker ar
rived there. Mr. Hassett vouchsafed no
reply to the gentleman. ;â¢' -Â-â 'â :
â In speaking of the Democratic conven
tion in this City of 1894 he referred to what
he called the filching of the minutes and
.the roll on the last day of the convention.
Mr. Gavigan' vehemently .disclaimed the
filching and said the records were in the
room now. The Metropolitan Hall meet
ing of disruption was then reviewed from
the speaker's standpoint.
V T. E. Treacey began by saying: "I know
you. Mr. Chairman, are prejudiced and
not fair in this matter and will therefore
appeal to the members of the State Central
Committee." pHe then read what he asked
to have adopted as an amendment ;- to the
McNab resolution. It provided for sub
mitting tne whole matter to the harmony
committee named by Judge Maguire.
It was ruled out of order by .Chairman
Gould. rv ip.y '""",:â¢- '
V J. A. Fenton moved that a vote be taken
on the resolution of McNab without fur
ther debate.
Mr. Mitchell of ' Los Angeles moved to
Jay the whole matter on the table, but sub
sequently, withdrew i his motion and then
proposed a plan for the settlement of the
San Francisco Democratic factions' fight.
He proposed that ; each faction select
eighteen men; that the State Central Com
mittee also select eighteen;; that these act
as ra V joint committee to arrange "â  for pri
maries to elect a new county. committee.
:: Joseph Rothschild said he was willing
to accept the plan and asked if the other
side would do so,' but no â  reply was made.
-The chairman then declared the Mitchell
proposition out of order, and on this decis
ion being announced ? Mr. Mitchell moved
to lay. the McNab matter on the table.- -Ââ  ,
Y'-A roll-call was demanded and it showed
21 for and 58 against the motion to lay on

DIVERT LIQUOR LICENSES.
That Is Mrs. Helen M. Cougar's Way
Out for the Unemployed.
. Mrs. Helen M. Gougar addressed a large
.audience at the Young Men's Christian

I thank God for organized labor in this coun

It* means better conditions for worklngmen.
Nothing happens. Everything is an effect of
some moving cause. You all have some idea
of the cause of the hard times. The good Re
publican brother, for instance, thinks it is the
tariff. But do you know that the difference
between the McKinley and Wilson bills is
$ 17,000 of revenue? ,
The organ of that strongest band of traitors
in America, the National Protective Associa
tion of Liquor Dealers, said at the time of
Republican triumph: "We will be safe as long
as the two parties are twisting each other's
ears over tariff." The same statement was re
peated when Democrats triumphed. You may
not know it, but while you have been wrangling
over tariff the liquor king, with head in
England, has been voting every mother son
of you. mWggmwSS^BSmJS

Don't talk to me of overproduction. There
is an overproduction of only one article in
this country, and that is political cussedness.
Until a man has three good, fat meals a day
don't talk about overproduction. Under-con

There is a new and dangerous English in

Englishmen who have interests in breweries

A way out for the unemployed is the direc
tion of the money that flows into the coffers of
the liquormen into the channels that tend to
ward homes. If we might be allowed to stive
f 2OOO from the liquor license each to the
homeless men of Chicago for instance, and
therewith buying a 25-foot lot and erecting a
cozy home in the suburbs, how advantageously
we might expend the money to the benefit of
families, and what a boom there would be in
outside lots! I would see the margin of

She Was Successfully Towed
Down From Mare Island
Yesterday.
HER TWO SAWED-OFF GUNS.
First Day's Work of Her Crewâ A
Public Reception to Be Given ;
on Board.
Lieutenant-Commander Louis H. Tur
ner, United States Naval Reserve, hoisted
his pennant aboard of . the monitor Com
anche at Mare Island yesterday and the
old ironclad, after thirty years of idleness,
went into commission. There was none
of the usual formalities. The colors went
up and the vessel passed quietly under the
control of the State of California. .
Early yesterday morning Captain Tur
ner, Lieutenant Gunn and Lieutenant
Dennis, with a detachment of the battalion,
in the harbor tug Markham, which had
been detailed for that duty, proceeded to
THE MONITOR COMANCHE, TOWED BY THE GOVERNOR MARKHAM TO SAN FRANCISCO.
[Sketched 'by a "Call " artist.]
the navy-yard, where they found the Com
anche ready for her departure. The Mark
ham hooked on, the shorelines were cas
oft and the trip began.
" The monitor was a little rusty from he
long sleep, and the rudder-chains rai
creakingly through their sheaves, but shÂ«
swung around to her helm, and the wate:
rippled along her sides as she went out
into the stream. Captain H. N. Turner, thi
father of Lieutenant-Commander Turner
took the wheel, with two seamen, to over
come whatever tendencies the Comanch<
might have to ram tbe Independence a:
she passed down the straits. All thestean
whistles of .the yard blew the monitor i
'good- by," and her old mooring place was
va o-i t Â«n - sah'Pa bio " ay the r.tme,*": gin
ning it * ebb, helped the tow, and the grea
mass was dragged along at a good speed.
The Monadnock went by about a mill
to starboard dipping her ensign in a sis
terly salute. During all the way dowi
Captain Turner, with his entire crew
worked industriously getting his mooring
ready. They consist of a large float weieh
ing several tons and a ponderous 23.000
pound sinker, which will hold the monito
against the southeaster and fierce tides o
San Francisco Bay.
Notwithstanding her age the Comanchi
proves how well the Navy Departmen
takes care of its vessels. The engines an
as bright and clean as if they had bec-r
placed in the hull * yesterday, and thi
roomy apartments below show* where fresl
paint and the scrubbing-brush have beer
used. .-
A machinist and fireman have been sta
tioned in the monitor during her long res'
at the yard, and every day the boilers, en
gine-room, turret and turret-chamber and
the guns have been examined. The engine
has been turned over, the turret revolved,
the battery run out and -in. Three men
enlisted at Mare Island for special service
will remain aboard and continue to care
for the vessel and her machinery. They
will also exercise diligence in guarding
against fire, for which an alarm will bÂ«
given by the rapid ringing of the ship's
ell and the closing of the ports and
hatches to prevent any draft of the flames
The steering wheel of the Comanche i;
on too of the turret, where jis also located
the iron conning-tower for the accommo
dation of the helmsman when shot and
shell are whistling painfully near him
The turret itself holds the two big, old-fash
ioned smooth-bore 15-inch guns that wen
considered dangerous a quarter of a ' cen
tury ago. Their muzzles, when -run out
look through two narrow slots at the world
around them. . ' V , .
The guns do not protrude through tht
wall of the turret as in the Monterey and
Monadnock, but fit snugly against the pori
to fill up the aperture, thus preventing the
smoke of the discharge from blowing back
into the turret and suffocating the gun
ners. The pieces have the appearance of
being sawed off like an express messenger's
shotgun. The guns are moved and the
turret revolved by compressors and levers
from within the structure. V- It sweeps
around on a central pivot carrying the two
great guns easily ana smoothly in an en
tire circle at the will of the operator. â¢
The vessel has much more deck room
than the Monterey or Monadnock, being
more convenient to the crew as an open
drilling place. She is fitted with the four
handsome black boats s belonging to ; the
battalion, besides the fine, swift steam
launch . received a few days ago from the
navy-yard.
Besides the heavy mooring, float and
sinker she is provided with a mushroom
shaped anchor, which is drawn up through
a well in the hull, near the stem, when the
Monitor is under way. It is never visible
when the vessel is afloat and its existence
is only known by its weight on the cable.
The only thing in poor repair is the deck,
which is rotten as punk, but as the plank
ing is laid upon an 'â :â¢ iron deck there is no
danger of tbe naval reserve going down be
low through the seams. - An effort has
been made to protect the deck by a thick
coat of tar covered with sawdust, which
gives the big platform a sort of prize-ring
appearance. â¢ â¢ â¢
Captain Turner and his officers and crew
took charge of the . ironclad like ; old men
of-war's men. The young fellows worked
faithfully and cheerfully all day at the
difficult labor of getting the cumbersome
moorings ready, proving that I the 'â â  State's
Naval Battalion has " the right ; stuff in it.
and would make a good showing should
they be; called upon :â  to fight . their craft
against a hostile ship. \:
Lieutenant-Commander â¢ Turner is a
roaster mariner, a practical seaman, and is
enthusiastic in his efforts jto bring the re
serve up to a high standard of proficiency,
consequently, he is pleased that the naval
militia has a drill snip, even if her battery
and herself is of a past day. â¢ : :
At the entrance to San Francisco,; Bay
the Comanche was joined "by her new
steam launch, having ton : board Colonel
James, the inspector of the battalion, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 1896.
Lieutenant Elliot, who --brought a fresh
crew to assist those aboard the monitor.
V Arriving off Harrison street,. about- ,7
o'clock in V the [ evening the % vessel was
moored in the berth ':. assigned her, .the
stay-lamp > lighted and she was left in
charge of the ship-keeper, Cockswain John
Lund. To Captain Petzinger of the tug
Markham, who managed his unwieldy tow
so skillfully, much credit for the success
of the undertaking is due. ' "â¢ V
As ; the battalion is desirous of ' making
some small immediate repairs on its ves
sel and if possible put a new deck in her,
they .intend soon ,to give a Sunday recep
tion on board to raise funds for that pur
pose. As the Comanche, though an old
type monitor, is in good condition and
well worth a visit, the plan of the young
men will doubtless meet the approval of
the public. The admirer of naval progress
will then note the gap jof thirty years be
tween the Comanche and the Monterey.'*

ried to the home of her friend, Mrs. A. A.

her sojourn in the City. V'
Miss Anthony looks as vigorous as when
she left the State last summer. She spoke
deprecatingly of the telegraphic stories of
her supposed demise last summer. "I was
in a small country town and the boys were
put to it for news." she remarked, laugh
ingly. "I don't believe they credited it
themselves even for the two minutes I was
in a swoon. Don't say much about it,
please. lam ashamed of having fainted,
even though it was for the first time in mv
life." *
â  Miss Anthony is as confident of the ulti
mate success of her cause as ever.
"We must depend upon on amendment
to the National constitution : for the
triumph of woman suffrage in the con
servative East," she said, "but in the pro
gressive West it can be accomplished by
State legislation. Reports from California
have been encouraging. I cannot speak
of the outlook from personal knowledge as
yet, but the sentiment is waxing strong in
the West. Â-.-'â â  <h :â ;
. "The; matter of amendments granting
equal suffrage is being agitated in Arizona,
New Mexico and Oklahoma, and Mrs.
Chapman Catt has taken a force of work
ers.to Idaho, whose efforts will be directed
to the same end.
"It has been my good fortune to meet
club after club of women since I left ? Cali
fornia. For - instance, there was the
Woman's Club, , numbering 700, in Chi
cago. Jane Adams, who is at the head of
the Hull House, read â â ; a paper on 'The
Modern Tragedy' that I consider one â of
the finest efforts I ever, heard. No mem
ber of the â¢ present Congress could do as
well, I am sure.
"I was at Ann Arbor at the time the 600
girl students gave their leap-year ball. It
was a most amusing affair.

Narrow Escape of the Canadian
Pacific \ Company's' Steamer
Miowera,
i. - .
SPRANG A LEAK WHILE AT SEA
Charlie Fair's Yacht Lucero in Col
lision Againâ Now Preparing
for a Cruise.
. The Canadian Pacific Company's steamer
Miowera, from Australia, had a narrow es
cape on her last voyage. She left Sydney
for Vancouver, B. :C, but when two days
out it was discovered that she was leaking
badly. The pumps were set to work, but
they could not keep the water down and
some of the furnace fires were put out.
The steamer was run back for port, and
after great labor on the part of the crew
finally reached there.
The bilges were cleared, the pumps put
in good order, and the leak stopped, but Just
as the vessel was ready for sea it was found
that the supports of the combustion cham
bers had given way, and . that further re
pairs were necessary. When these were
completed, the Miowera made a fresh start
arid reached Puget Sound in safety.
When the steamer got hack to Sydney
some of the cabin passengers left her, and
one of them, G. W. Dickerman, came over
on the Alameda. He insists that the Mio
wera was not well found, and asserts that
he wrote to the Sydney, Morning Herald
and Daily Telegraph to that effect, but the
papers mentioned refused to " publish his
statement. The Miowera is ; the r steamer
that went on the.reef at Honolulu and on
the rocks off the coast of Norway.
â * Charlie Fair's new yacht Lucero seems
â 4Â© bÂ» â¢till in the "unfortunate class." She
was brought over from .. Sausalito yester
day, and -.while being ; docked at Mission
street wharf ran into the shed and
damaged her standing rigging. She is
now being fitted out for a cruise, and took
on board a full supply of gasoline. - Every
thing will be in readiness about the Ist of
next month, and then Mr, Fair and 'â¢. his
friends will make a trip up the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers. Governor Budd
in company with ; George A; Knight in
spected the pretty little craft during the
j afternoon, and the Governor was loud m
his praises of her. . He knows all about
I gasoline launches, and thinks the Lucero
will be a success. '* ; â¢ YY--Y
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
China sailed for the Orient yesterday.
The managers of -the concern were careful
to see that she could not get into the same
| predicament as the Rio de Janeiro, as they
put nearly 500 tons of extra coal aboard.
The ' China took away 43, cabin passen
gers, of whom only one was for Hongkong,
and 126 steerage, of whom 100 were Chinese
for the Flowery Kingdom. Among the
cabin passengers was General George Wil
liams, who is going to Yokohama to repre
sent the Cramps. He expects to be able
to secure . a contract for , building a ship
for the new Japanese navy. General Mana
ger Fillmore of 3 the Southern Pacific and
Irving M. Scott of the Union Iron Works
were down to see him off. ".,
J. Sohji, a Japanese sailor boarding-house
keeper, was also a cabin passenger. Some
say he has gone to Japan to escape from a
white wife of whom he is tired ; others *ay
he will be back inside of two month's with,
a consignment ol Japanese, who will; be
ready to fill vacancies on vessels that may
be snort of sailors during the summer
months. , About a ; month ago Sohji . at
tempted to get away, but his wife locked
up all his oeiongings and he was compelled
to come to terms.
â  Nao â  Nebraka,: manager of the Yoko
hama Specie Bank, and the Japanese Con
sul-General to Mexico were also passen
gers. The respect in which Mr. Nebraka
is held in the > mercantile community was
shown by the , number of business men
who were down to see him off. He estab

THEIR MATINEE CONCERT
Ondricek and Materna Again
Arouse Plaudits at the
; Auditorium. \\
_ â
The Violinist's Wonderfully Charac
teristic Rendering of Hungarian
Airs.
- Ondricek and Materna repeated their,
success of Thursday evening at the mati
nee concert given in the new Auditorium
yesterday. There was a large audience,
and the enthusiasm displayed was posi
tively ardent in its warmth.
Ondricek invaded the severely classical
repertory more than he had done on the
opening night, for he played a romance in
G major by Beethoven and an air by Bach.
These pieces, however, were more tastes
than solid classical meals, and one would
have to hear the brilliant Bohemian at
greater length to judge whether he excels
as much in Bach and Beethoven as he
does in characteristic work, such as
Ernst's "Hungarian Airs."
. In characteristic work Ondricek is sim
ply magnificent;, the Ernst airs, for in
stance, were .not only played with astonish
ing technique, but with the verve and senti
ment that are so characteristic of the Hun
garian music. ; The player almost trans
ported his nearers into "a state of Hunga
rian rhapsody as they 'listened, and at the
end their gratification broke out in pro
longed applause.
Tne Max Bruch concerto in G minor
was splendidly rendered by Ondricek, and
Isidore Luckstone, ' the pianist, showed
himself to be a thoroughly sympathetic
collaborator. The romance, which pre
ceded the "Moto Perpetuo" by Ries,
showed especially how delicate are the vio
linist's nouauces, and the "Moto" was an
exhibition of brilliant technical skill. As
an ; encore he played a "Legende" by
Wieniawski. A Tarantelle by OndriCek
proved to be a remarkably effective com
position as he himself played it, though if
tamely rendered it would probably - be
shorn of most Of its charm. Yp p iy ;
.' Â« Frau Arhalia Materna again showed her
self to be a phenomenal artist. . In spite of
the years of work it has gone through her
marvelous voice shows no signs of wear in
the high tones. She Bings with a purity
and reserve which assures â¢ one immedi
ately that never will Materna attempt what
she cannot execute with more than ease.
The art of her j singing, in fact, is no less
remarkable than the volume and resonance
of her voice.
1 Yesterday Materna gave an aria from
"Rienzi," an opera which many Wag
nerians regard with scorn and contumely,

FOE OF SCALE PESTS.
Professor Albert Koebele Tells About
the Australian Ladybug;â Ed Morphy .
Heard From.
Professor' Albert Koebele. the man who
brought the ladybugs from Australia,
China and Japan to fight the scale insect
pests of the California orange and olive or
chards, returned to this ; country on the _i
steamship Alameda. He is to remain here
three weeks and at the expiration of that
time he will return to Hawaii, where he is
experimenting in the removal of the pests
from coffee and sugar plantations.
At Hawaii," said the professor, "I in
troduced the ladybug to kill the scale in
sects that > destroyed the ; coffee plants and
the orange and ornamental . trees. The
coffee industry was practically dead. .; It
was my agreement to remove the pests in
three years, and now, at the end of two
years, the work is practically done.
"There is a - parasite that attacks the
sugar cane, too,'' and a year ago I intro
duced the ladybug on some of the sugar
plantations. The results will be benefi
cial." â â â :â¢ â â .;â  '..:- '\;;;y. '; â  ; , y- ;Y y

SENIOR CLASS TAKES ACTION.
A Unanimous Decision Against Gradua
tion at Berkeleyâ A Meeting
Yesterday.
The senior class of Hastings Law Col
lege has a grievance' against the Berkeley
alumni and is appointing committees and
adopting resolutions in consequence.
* "At a meeting of the class yesterday
morning charges were made that the
alumni at Berkeley is attempting to ex
clude the Hastings graduates from ' mem
bership in the alumni of the University
of California. The Berkeley alumni were
severely criticized for their action.
Stephen L. Sullivan, the president of
the class, appointed a committee for the
purpose of drawing up resolutions em body
ing the sentiments .of the class, as ex-
Dressed at the meeting. ; â¢ . p'Ypi
The question whether it is advisable for
the law department classes to graduate j at
Berkeley was taken up, and it was unani
mously decided that the present senior
class should not go across ihe bay for grad
uation. -. â¢â¢'.-,> . :'; â â '-; â¢â .-..:; -:'â . â â â 
Considerable feeling was expressed in
regard to the Berkeley attempt to deprive
the law department; graduates of their
right to membership in. the alumni asso
ciation of the university, and it was de
termined to take up the issue in a forcible
manner and insist on the rights of the
law graduates. The matter will be brought
before the university members in the reso
lutions of the senior class, and the gradu
ates of Blasting's college will be urged to
declare in favor of rights or alumni mem
bership.
Another meeting of the law class will
be held this week for further action in the
matter. '. : ____________________
MOLLENHAUER'S SOLOS.
The Violinist Plays Fagantnl Variations
With the Symphony Orchestra.
Beethoven's "First Symphony" was the
I chief orchestral feature .: of the k concert
I given by the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra Friday afternoon in Golden
Gate Hall. The performance of the work
was heartily applauded by a large and evi
dently critical audience. â¢ â  V
The overture to Schubert's v "Rosa
j munde" was played by the orchestra with
I expression and finish. r The performance
| of Saint-Saens' "Danse Macabre", would
have been benefited by more rehearsal,
â  though Bernhard Mollenhauer, the first
violin, labored heroically to hide the fact.
! Any little shortcomings in the "Danse
; Macabre," however, were more than
\ atoned > for by the. rendering given to the
I toreador aria from Bizet's "Carmen." This
| ever-popular selection was played so
I crisply and brightly that the conductor,
| James Hamilton Howe, was warmly ap
! plauded before the audience consented to
depatt, for the "Carmen" number was the
last on the programme. . -
'... The soloists wereÃerrihard Mollenhauer
and Mrs. Leckie S. Reynolds. The former,'
| who played Paganini's variations upon the
air "NelCorPiu," received quite an ovation. ;
Mr. Mollenhauer competed remarkably well
with the immense, technical difficulties of
the piece; at . times they were overwhelm
ing enough to bluut his attack a little, but
on the whole his exhibition of virtuosity
well deserved the delighted plaudits it re
ceived. As an V encore Mr. Mollenhauer
played a "Berceuse" by Sauret tenderly
] and sympathetically, though with a slight
indifference here and there as to intona
tion. â â â¢-." "-'./â '.;
Mrs. Leckie S. Reynolds would no doubt
have appeared , to better advantage in a
modern song, for; her singing of Handel's
, "He Was Despised" from "The Messiah"
showed that sue scarcely possessed;, the
dignity and breadth of style requisite for
oratorio work. , .*-'.

MISS OVERMAN'S
FLIGHT SOUTHWARD
Will Be With Her Friend,
Mrs. Tunnell, at Ense
nada To-Day.
HAS PLENTY OF MONEY.
Pastor Brown's Young Friend
Left the City With a Big
Roll of Cash.
THE COUNCIL FAILS TO AGREE.
The Severest Verdict Will Probably Be
Unmmisterial Conductâ To Meet
Again To-Morrow.
After nearly twelve hours of calm, ma
ture deliberation, Pastor Brown's jurors,
elected to determine his guilt or innocence
on certain grave charges, are to all ap
pearances no nearer a verdict than when
they retired for executive session Friday
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
This long session is not necessarily con
strued as prejudicial to the interests of the
accused man, but to the contrary, rather
beneficial.
It is now generally conceded that Dr.
Pond's resolution of Friday night, to the
effect that Dr. Brown was guilty of con
duct unbecoming a Christian gentleman,
was not, after all, a supplementary mo
tion, but rather a sort of cloture propo
sition. It is thought now to have been
merely an effort to bind the council as to
their final verdict.
But there are members of the council
who are not willing to render such a com
promising verdict. It is a matter of con
science and principle, and if they cannot
bring their fellow members to a similar
way of thinking they will either return a
minority report or else hold out for an
"unministerial conduct" verdict, unquali
fied in any way.
It is generally understood that if the
council finds Dr. Brown guilty of "unminis
terial conduct," unaccompanied by "ifs"
and "ands" and "wherefores," it would
kill his chances of ever securing another
pulpit.
On the other hand, if such a conclusion
is reached with these "strings" attached,
Dr. Brown's future pastoral relations with
church affairs will not be affected in the
least.
It is now generally conceded that Dr.
Brown will be acquitted on the main
charges; that is, such as are covered in the
immoral conduct specifications. This
much was practically decided at yester
day's session of the council.
Eighteen of the twenty members do not
believe Miss Overman's explanation of the
Overman - Tunnell letters. They bold
that Miss Overman and Mrs. Tun
nell are the central figures in the plot
to ruin Dr. Brown. It is further argued
in a corroborative sort of way that Mrs.
Davidson, learning of this plot, figura
tively and literally nipped it in the bnd.
Dr. Brown and his family, not being at
that time on particularly friendly terms
with Miss Overman, he saw no way out
of the difficulty but to pay the $500 de
manded by the aged class leader, Mrs. Da
vidson.
When, however, Dr. Brown, as stated in
his sworn testimony, managed to secure
an interview with Miss Overman, he dis
covered that he was the victim of a scheme
to ruin him. and further, that his young
friend was not then an actual party to it.
Acting in accordance with this belief, the
reverend gentleman secured the arrest
of Mrs. Davidson, and thereby caused, un
fortunately for him, the explosion of the
largest bombshell manufactured by scan
dal-mongers since the time of Henry Ward
Beecher.
The accused man's conduct since this
supposed premature event has not, how
ever, been of such a character as to com
mend him to his brethren. They are in
clined to administer to him a rebuke for
unministerial conduct, more as a matter
of discipline than anything else.
One cause for this almost unanimous
opinion of the council is found in the
difference existing in the letters of the
three principal characters in the scandal.
It is contended by the ecclesiastical judges
that there is an entire lack of similarity
between the letters of Mrs. Davidson, Miss
Overman and Dr. Brown. They have been
inclined to accept the theory advanced by
the accused pastor, to the effect that Mrs.
Davidson's letters, written to Miss Over
man, gave the lie to any assumption that
he was at that or any other time harboring
for her friend an illicit love. .
' In addition to this theorizing the council
has concluded that there is no absolute
proof in the Overman-Tun nell letters of
immcral duct on the part of Dr. Brown â
all tne evidence contained therein is con
sidered purely indirect.
Contrary to expectations the testimony
of Mrs. Stockton was again considered.
There are three or four members of the
council who are inclined to pin faith to
this woman's story.
It is contended by the adherents of this
belief that while Mrs. Stockton may have
been at times decidedly gay it does not
follow that Pastor Brown was unwilling to
acknowledge her charms. The fact that
no witnesses have come forward to sub
stantiate Mrs. Stockton's story counts but
little with them when it is remembered
Dr. Brown's defense in the Overman mat
ter is practically entirely unsupported. It
is argued by them that Mrs. Stockton
could have had no reason to concoct such
a story.
It is also remembered by these gentle
men that the now famous Gear affidavit
was secured by Dr. Brown some six or
eight days after he paid the $500 over to
Mrs. Davidson. This, taken in connection
with the after results, clearly indicates
that Pastor Brown anticipated some pos
sible action on the part of Mrs. Stockton.
The natural conclusion, therefore, is that
there was some foundation . * for . the
woman's accusations, though just ' how
great will probably never be determined.
The suspicion," however, that all is not
just right in this direction still remains
with these three or four members.
At this point the council adjourned to
meet at . 2 o'clock . Monday. ; Dr. Brown's
judges were particularly reticent concern
ing the work of the day, evidently not
appreciating the publication of what had
been intended to be strictly private,, as
given exclusively in The Call of yesterday.
Dr. Brown is. seemingly weighed down
with the uncertainty attached to the find
ings of V his ecclesiastical brethren. So
much is he depressed: that he refuses to
see all visitors,', except V Deacon Morse.
That gentleman extends to him .the same
solace he is currently supposed- to nave
given to the late Dr. Barrows during that
gentleman's troubles. |9S___
Pastor Brown is not yet, prepared to be
lieve that the council will give him any
thing but an unqualified victory. He fails
utterly- to see in any act. that which is tin
ministerial, and contends that if such a
Tcdict is reached and handed in it will be
a travesty,, on * truth and ,â¢ religion. He
wants a whole victory or notning.
â  The sudden and somewhat mysterious
disappearance of Miss Overman Thursday
afternoon, which fact only came to the at
tention of the council yesterday,- has
caused the individual members' of that
body to indulge in considerable unpleasant
speculation. Unless some satisfactory ex
planation is given at the time of tne next
session of the council it is not improbable
that Miss Overman's flight will cut a big
figure in their final decision.
A Call representative inquired at the
home of Dr. Brown Thursday night after
Miss Overman. He was told that she ; was
well, though still fatigued, and conse
quently did not care to see any one. At
that time she was already four or five
hours on her southern trip.
' Rev. Mr. Rader was quite indignant
yesterday at the statement made in a
morning paper that he had an abiding
faith in Miss Overman and her explanation
of the Tunnell letters. He stated to a Call
representative yesterday in tbe presence of
Dr. Williams, another member of the
council, that he wished that statement
corrected, though this denial is not to be
construed as an expression on his part of
Dr. Brown's guilt. Mr. Rader refused
afterward to tell the reporter anything of
the inside deliberations, though he ad
mitted with some reluctance that the pro
ceedings, as published in The Call of yes
terday, were correct in detail and fact.
OVER THE LINE.
Miss Overman Makes Her Escape
Into Mexico.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 14.â Mattie
Overman is on her way to Ensenada as fast
as a six-mule team can carry her. She left
this city early this morning and took the
National City and Otay train for Tia
Juana. She was* unaccompanied and went
about her business as if she had lived here
all her life.
At the hotel here she showed quite a
sum of money when she paid her bill, but
did not vouchsafe any information.
The train arrived at Tia Juana at 11
o'clock, and a few minutes afterward Miss
Overman appeared at the International
Hotel and registered for luncheon.
She was sired up as a female detective
by the loungers at the hotel and many of
them connected her with the famous gold
brick robbery at Ensenada last year. She
inquired about the stage for Ensenada and
engaged a Â«eat, and in the afternoon left
for the south.
It was learned here to-day that Mrs.
Tunnell has been at Ensenada for over a
month. She lives in the outskirts of the
town with a Mexican family, and so far has
tried to avoid meeting Americans.
She and Mattie Overman evidently have
a well-arranged plan, as Miss Overman ap
peared to be quite jubilant when she
crossed the line and was practically sure of
reaching Ensenada.
SAFE IN MEXICO.
Mrs. Tunnell Finds a Safe Hiding
Place Across the Border.
ENSENADA, Mexico, March . 14.â Mrs.
Tunnell is quietly living with a Mexican
family some half a mile from the center
of this city. She has been here since Feb
ruary 25 or 26.
She is a quiet, unassuming woman, ap
parently about 60 years old. She first went
to the leading hotel in this city, and after
looking around for a day or two secured
lodgings with a family, as stated before.
It was not known immediately on her
arrival here that she was the much
wanted Mrs. Tunnell, as she registered at
the hotel under the name of Fowler. One
day she called for her mail, and in some
way discovered there was a letter for a
Mrs.Tunnell. She immediately claimed the
letter, saying she was the party named, j
but for reasons which she did not then care I
to disclose had assumed the name of Fow- â 
ler. Later it was brought to light that she
is the woman who has figured so promi
nently in the Brown scandal.
A few days ago Mrs. Tunnell announced
to her friends for she had by this time
become quite well knownâ that she ex
pected a young lady friend to visit her
soon. It now develops that this person is
none other than Miss Overman, Dr.
Brown's alleged platonic friend.
Mrs. Tunnell has given it out that her
stay in Ensenada, as well as that of Miss
Overman, is likely to be indefinite. She
would only discuss the Brown scandal in a
general way, though she declares with
great emphasis that she knows nothing to
the discredit of either Dr. Brown or Miss
Overman. She says that the interview ob
tained by The Call correspondent while
she was rusticating at Visalia was correct
in detail, though she can now see that her
momentary exhibition of feeling over the
production of the Overman-Tunnell letters
was calculated to do the interested parties
great harm.
She endeavored to correct this the next
day by writing a statement to The Call,
but she has since learned that this has
been . questioned by many of the enemies
of Dr. Brown. What feeling she might
have displayed in the first interview she
declares was wholly without meaning.
Mrs. Tunnell came into the city to-day
expecting to find, Miss Overman, but re
ceived information to the effect that the
young woman would not arrive until to
morrow.
MRS. COOPER SPEAKS.
Bickford Reports Regarding Dr.
Brown's Trip to Oregonâ The
Identity of Jane Baddin.
"Mrs. Baddin exists, and no one can
deny it."
So said.Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper yesterday
evening.
"A short time ago," continued Mrs.
Cooper, "there came to my home a man
named Augustus de Gay. He seemed as
though in reduced circumstances, but his
air and speech were those of a gentleman.
In one lapel of his coat he displayed a
Grand Army button. Before disclosing to
me the object of his visit he referred me
to A. J. Ralston and to Professor Le Conte
of the State University as acquaintances,
and told me he had been a professor of
German, Spanish and French.
"He then proceeded to relate that during
the previous â¢ hop-picking season he had
found himself without means, and in order
to live he had gone to work in the hop
fields at PleasEnton. He was working
there in section D of the field when one day
there appeared beside him in the same sec
tion of the field Mrs. Jane Elizabeth Bad
din, accompanied by a man, presumably
her last husband, and two children of 12 or
14 years. The four were in great destitution,
and were intending to pass the day with
out food until they should get their pay in
the evening. Mr. de Gay, seeing their
plight supplied them with food. Mrs.
Baddin's eyes were much inflamed, and at
her work she always wore a pair of blue
goggles. On the completion of - the job
the t Baddin "quartet ; departed and Mr. de
Gay never saw them again; He assured
me, however, that their names were on the
paymaster's books, which he said were in
the possession 'of Ya man named Oppen
heimer or some similar name, who had a
store on Front street. â  \ =Â-'â 
"After giving me this information ] Mr.
de Gay departed,>nd I have since learned
he sought and obtained admission to the
Veterans' Home at , Yountville, where I
believe he is at present. His story seemed
strange, Y but his manner waft* sincere.
He had assured me that his â¢ only object
was tto give me :. information, . by. using
which I might be able to assure myself,
that Mrs. Baddin was not a myth, but a
woman of flesh and - ; blood. A ; few days
elapsed, and then I- commenced finding
out more â  and more about Mrs. Baddin
from, various Â» sources. â¢ The k stories were
fragmentary, but, fitted together, formed a
complete whole. Mrs. Baddin, whose
maiden name Iâ¢; did v not : learn, has \ been
married three times; first to Baddin, then
to a man named Jones, and lastly to one
Scott. : She seems to prefer the * name of
Baddin, and is not, so far as I could learn,
known by any other. p During her resi
dence here she was a midwife, and: the

name of Miss Overman has been strangely
connected with her sudden disappearance.
I suppose she must be down \ south â ': some
where with Miss Overman and Mrs. Tun
nell. " TiiMii(ft|Hii||L i|iiiiffl*n*Miiii'jLi iiipi.iiiwmwm
At this juncture the doorbell tinkled and
Bickford, the kalsominer and sleuth; made
his entree into the cozy parlor. ;He had
spent the day in Oakland seeking certain
railway conductors and Pullman-car por
ters, who are thought to know something
about the behavior of Dr. Brown and Miss
Overman during their trip to Tacoma. I
. "The one who could tell us all about it
is Street, then the conductor' and now
agent for the railway company at Port
land. He knows the story."
"Yes," " answered *"â  ' Mrs. Cooper, "he
knows the story, but when requested by
telegraph to make a statement he refused,
wiring back that he had nothing to say
about the Brown-Overman matter.
Bickford then proceeded to recount
some gossip which he had heard retailed
by porters, cooks and trainmen. One
trainman recollected i that Dr. Brown had
preached on the train during his return
trip, the train being delayed by snow
drifts on the track.
"I wish to state," said Mrs. Cooper,
"that all the evidence which I have pre
sented has come to me unsought and unso
licited. My daughter has done a little in
vestigating, but I have not. Mrs. Barton
is called one of my witnesses; but Ido
not know with what reason. She came
to me a few days . before she ' testified,
and told her story. I advised her to omit
certain irrelevant parts of it, particularly
the circumstance of her intense hatred of
Miss Overman. On one occasion, when
Mrs. Tunnell, who was an intimate friend
of hers, desired to introduce Mattie to her,
she refused to have anything to do with
'that red-haired woman.' Mrs. Barton's
manner is peculiar; and well it may be,
for she has had much trouble with her
husband, a preacher, who left her and
betook himself to company and quarters
more to his liking. Her story, however,
was a strong one, 'and certainly should
carry weisrht.
"We are approaching the termination of
this sad affair," said Mrs. Cooper, as she
Judge T. 11. Taylor, Who Went , to the Livermore Valley Forty Years Ago.
rose to accompany her visitors to the door,
"and I hope the cause of right may tri
umph. I am known as Dr. Brown's
friend. He and 'his wife alone have al
luded tome as an enemy. It seems as
though his guilt were well nigh evident:
but whatever his fate, my prayers and
good wishes will always follow him."

SEES A HOPE
FOR FARMERS
Livermore Valley Needs
New Landlords Rather
Than Tenants.
JUDGE TAYLOR'S VIEWS.
He Has Watched the Develop
ment of the District for
Forty Years.
â  â¢â¢â  i
SHORT LEASES CONDEMNED.
Under the Present System Nothing
but Periodical Failure Can
Be Expected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 14. J
Judge J. H. Taylor of Livermore, who has
grown from a young man to gray hairs in
the Livermore Valley, sees a possibility of
making farming a success by the abolition
of prevailing methods of 'short leases. p' ~k
He also sees the realization of a vision
he had forty years ago. In 1857 he first
visited Livermore Valley, where land was
taxed for 25 cents an acre, and as he now
looks at the same land covered with towns
and railroads and coal mines he declares
that there is a very prosperous future for
the valley.
"When I rode over the valley in 1857 it
was covered with a luxuriant growth of
wild oats," said Judge Taylor yesterday.
"At that time Robert Livermore, who had
obtained a grant from the Mexican Gov
ernment of four leagues of land, aban
doned half of the grant, because he did not
think it worth the taxes. As late as 1864
George May purchased a tract from one
of the heirs of Livermore for $4 an acre.
I met a gentleman on the road
as I was driving through the valley, who
told me of May's purchase. He made the
remark that May's money was thrown
away. However, the same gentleman who
questioned Mr. May's business ability
bought in 1873 a tract of land of nearly
300 acres a few miles west of May's pur
chase, for which he paid $90 an acre.
"The natural soil of Livermore always was
unusually productive. Considering tho
gravelly nature of some portions of the
valley the yield of wheat was a surprise to
the early settlers. In many instances
2500 pounds of wheat to the acre was
harvested from the lighter soil, and in the
heavier soil the yield was greater.
â¢ "In JS72, I think it ; was, Antone Bord
cini planted the first vineyard of foreign
grapevines in the eastern portion of the
valley, near a part of the Montgomery
estate. It was not a success, but in 1878
the vineyard passed into the lontrol of a
party who, by good cultivation and judi
cious pruning, gradually brought the vine
yard into bearing. The third crop proved
such a success that the industry was ' soon
after thoroughly established. v
"From 1868 large portions of our valley
have been cropped' continually. ; The 'â  ex
ceptions to that rule are such portions as
have been put out to vineyards and'or
chards and the very few farms that have
been leased for a term of years.
'â¢On the last mentioned farms the
tenants have been successful. The system
of summer fallowing and; pasturing is
gradually restoring the ; original strength
and ; productiveness of the soil. V But when
we turn to that portion of the valley that
is cursed by short or yearly leases, a dis
couraging condition: 5 of things p is V ap
parent- a lace of necessary improvements,
houses unfit for families to- occupy and
barns that will hardly protect stock from
the storms of the winter months. In many
instances there are no ; fences at all, and
subdivision . fences, which would enable a
tenant to pasture i a "few i cows on green
fallow, cannot ; be afforded. â¢If : a tenant
should ask such a landlord for a place
where he could keep butter cool or milK
clean he would be met with a very decided
refusal. With such a condition of things
how can a tenant succeed?
"First the landlord arranges to take the
last cent out -of ' the tenant | that he I will
bear. .Then the tenant's only show is to
take from the land all he can V possibly
extract from it without returning any
thing to the soil. When' the' crop is har
vested he 's forced to move* it "or let it rot
on the ground where it is. V Everything is
turned on to the market at a time when
the market is ' always at the ' very lowest
price. ,) â >
"In many cases the tenant has to hurry
up, because he has to hunt another place,
and what is still worse, he cannot pay. the
current expenses of the year.'and some of
his creditors have to charge his account up
to the wrong side of the led ger.YS Such con
ditions : should not exist in our beautiful
valley. -We want a change of landlords
more than a change of tenantsâ a class of
men who will : look ahead for a longer pe
riod than one year; who can see and \rec
ognize the fact ; that ' it will pay them to
furnish ;' their . tenants comfortable houses
to V live ?in ,-' and the necessary .'?. buildings
connectedâ barn 'k-s sufficient - for â  stocfe."
fences and â¢ subdivision *. fences that ?" will
enable him' to pasture or green fallow
a portion of .** the farm every year. Then I
think : : thrift and success will r take the
place of annual failures, and the landlord

Defeated a Field of Good Ones
in the Stake Event at
Ingleside.
SIR VASSAR A HANDY WINNER.
Uncertainty at 25 to 1 and Morven at
Equally Long Odds Were the
Big Surprises.
The big crowd of racing enthusiasts
witnessed some rare good sport at Ingle-
Bide track yesterday. The stately Liber
tine carried off the prize in the rich Gen
eral Arthur Cigar stake, worth $1500 to
the first horse, and the victory, was a most
popular one, for the grand looking bay
has a host of followers among local turf
goers.
The racing throughout was above the
average. To be sure there were not a few
upsets, but old timers Bay it is the un
certainties of the game that make it bo
attractive, and it was uncertain .enough
yesterday to suit the most fastidious.
One slight accident marred the day's
sport. Four of the youngsters in the two
year-old race fell soon after the start was
made, and the promising filly Lady Laurel
wood was so badly injured as to have to
be killed. Si McClain, who had - the
mount on Sister Modred, was badly shaken
up, but the other "riders escaped without
injury. . Y'-;p.
The followers of the first choices went
down hard. Of the seven that went to
the post Libertine and : the 1 to 7 chance
Kowalsky were ; the only ones returned
winners. The good thing of the day was
Uncertainty, in the hurdle race, who won
comparatively easy, backed down from 25
to Bto 1. : at -
IThe greatest interest was displayed as to
the.probable outcome of the state event.
The. distance was one and a sixteenth
miles, and nine of the best horses at pres
ent m training faced the issue. In, the
opening betting Libertine, carrying top
weight, 120 pounds, opened a 2 to 1
favorite, which was quickly cut to 9 to 5, .
and that price was obtainable throughout
the wagering. Against the other starters
very liberal odds were offered. Wheel of
Fortune 4, Pepper 6^,Lovdal9.and In-
Btallator 9 were the ring odds against the
most eligible as the bugle announced post
time. The gate sent them away well lined
up. Passing the stand Installator was in.
front, and 'the Brutus horse -headed. the
bunch to the far turn, where Macklin on
the favorite assumed the lead. . Into. the
stretch the big sprinter was trailed closely:
by Braw Scot and Installator. The latter
I pair were soon passed by Lovdal ,and
Wheel of Fortune, who put in a bold .bid
for the big end of the stake. Libertine was
extended at the end, but finished strong, :
passing the wire with Lovdal and the
"Wheel" lapped on his saddle skirts, in
the excellent time, considerine the strong'
wind that was blowing, of 1:48%. Lovdal
secured the place by the shortest of heads.
The prize, as is customary at the new
course, was suspended from the wire in a
dainty silver bag, which was taken down
by the winnine jockey.
"Fourteen two-year-olds went to the post
in the opening event, a four-furlong dash,;
with the Burns & Waterhouse pair, Ro
r w ena B and Kingstreet ruling Bto 5 favor
-19 ites. Installator 111 and The Sinner, third
choices in the betting, showed the way
into the stretch, and the former, finishing
camely, won by a short half length from
Kingstreet. who passed his stable mate the

chance, and after leading until opposite
the drawgate began fading away, and was
unplaced at tho wire. Morven, at odds of
25 to 1, won; handily, with Model in the
place, a head in front of Ferris Hartman.
The mile and a furlong handicap was a
peculiarly run race, and one that caused a
deal of grumbling among those that had :
their coin down 4on the Cambridge' and
Lone stable's pair, Yankee Doodle and Key
del Bandidos, the 4 to 5 favorites. The
stable was considered a "copper riveted,"
and the speculation on Ed â  Kearney, Sir
Vassar and Tenacity was slight. The
stable undoubtedly desired to win with
Rev del Bandidos, and . Coady on the
Doodle horse must have been given in
structions not to win unless all of the
others fell down. Strangely enough.
Bandidos was sent out to make the run
ning, his stable mate back in the bunch
under a choking pull. The bie chestnut
was a length in front as the stretch was
reached, with Yankee Doodle and Sir as
sar, on nearly equal . terms, following.
Bandidos soon began showing signs of dis
tress, and Garner on Sir Vassar took the
lead and his mount won well within' him
self by a length in 1:5*% an excellent per
formance. Bandidos finished in the place,
over a length in front of Yankee Doodle. .
The mile and a quarter hurdle race de
veloped a very hot tip. Uncertainty was
backed down from a long price to 8 to 1,
and leading all the way won easily by a
length, with Hello in the place. Content
ment, backed down to even money, was
never prominent, finishing back in the
ruck. KhSSJMB
W. B. Sink's mare, Sister Mary, was
scratched out of . the stake event and
started in the seven-furlong run. It looked
a soft spot for . her and the public backed
her down from twos to 3to 2. She ran in
front to the stretch and was then lost to
I view. Major Cook, whose last appear-
I ance as a favorite caused the scan
dal mongers to gossip, then took command

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 1896.
THOUSANDS CHEER SUTRO
Citizens Show Their Appre
â¢ â¢â¢ ciation of the* New
Baths;
THE MAYOR CONGRATULATED.,
Inaugural Speakers Compliment Him
Upon the Culmination of His
Victory. \
"I'm first, just the same," shouted a
small boy, as he slid down the chute and
struck the water with a splash. In an in
stant a dozen other lads had joined him.
Mayor Sutro had not yet finished his pres
entation speech, but it was superfluous for
him to announce that the baths were
thrown open for the enjoyment of the peo
ple' of San Francisco. The action of the
irrepressibles, whose patience did not suf
fice for any further waiting on formalities,
demonstrated it to the entire satisfaction
of the spectators, and they cheered their
appreciation. â¢
It was a most disagreeable day. A cold
wind blew from the ocean and the sun
shone dimly through a veil of mist. Sea
ward a dark banK of clouds marked the
horizon, and the smoke of passing vessels
suggested a gale. In spite of this unat
tractive programme in the weather" there
were about 7000 people at the Cliff during
the afternoon.
The inauguration exercises commenced
at half-past 2. On a platform in- the cen
ter of the baths were seated Mayor Sutro,
Colonel Taylor, Henry E. High ton, Taylor
M. Rogers, Dr. C. D. Clevelana, William;
C. Little and Cassasa's California . Exposi
tion Band. V p Yv pÂ» >pp .
After, a selection by the band, Colonel
Taylor, as president of the day, made a
brief speech, eulogizing the Mayor and
commenting on the magnitude of his pres
ent achievement., v He introduced Colonel
Thomas F. Barry, who said that when he
contemplated the ' grandeur and mag
nificence of these baths and tried to ex
press his sentiments, he stood between the
devil and the deep sea. "I have had the
honor," ;he said, "to preside over meetings
of citizens who .were in hearty, sympathy
with /Mr.- Sutro when he was endeavoring
to construct the road, and now it Is a great
pleasure to witness the final realization of
his hopes." â¢ â  - -'..-â  â¢
Henry E. Highton V paid an earnest
tribute to the persistence and energy
which had resulted in V the realization of
Mr. Rutin's comprehensive schemes to
benefit the citizens of San Francisco. "This
. building," he said, "is a triumph over
monopoly and corruption, and it will shine
as a grand memorial to founder. Con
trast the actions of Mr. 'Sutro and Mr.
Huntington. While Huntington is busily
traducing this State ,in the East, Mayor
Sutro is here earning and receiving the
praise of his fellow-citizens." He tendered
his personal congratulations to Mayor
Sutro upon the completion of his task.
Dr. C. P. Cleveland made a brief address
congratulating the people upon -the ac
quisition of such a colossal benefit and
the Mayor upon the successful issue of his
unceasing energy.
With an appropriate speech Colonel Tay
lor then introduced the Mayor. The peo
pie rose en masse and made the building
ring with their cheers. The band caught
the spirit of the occasion and played a
few strains of "He's a Jolly Good Fellow,"
and it was fully five minutes before he
.was allowed to proceed. He said in part:
â¢ It is a great honor and pleasure to welcome
you to the opening of this structure that haÂ»
_ri<Â»eÂ«ilÂ»wJVt.fÂ©- /Jx> Â«innÂ«Â»want, <iol.ctÂ«Â»tiu!l anil
instruction of the people of the City of San
Francisco and of the visitors within her gates.
' There were obstacles in its construction and
no mean ones, either. For instance, that big
glass wall that fronts the waters of the Pacific
could tell a long story of difficulty, perse
verance and final success. To obviate all dan
ger of ever being washed away it had to be
raised safe and sound on a strong foundation.
There were many days when the angry sea
prevented work, and there were more when
the men could not labor for more than two or
three hours a day.
This is only a sample of th 3 difficulties that
were met with in the erection of the building
and that delayed the construction. Suffice it
to say that these difficulties were so numerous
and so great that I am within bounds when 1
assert that the invisible work of the sub
structure cost as much or even more than the
visible superstructure under whoso ample and
airy roof we are to-day gathered.
In various parts of the building you will find
collections of natural history, of coins and
intaglios, curios from Eeypt, Mexico, Pales
tine, Assyria, India, Japan, all parts of Europe,
Alaska and other countries, as well as hun
dreds of other objects that will amuse and in
struct and at the same time will help to instill
in the minds of youthful' visitors a desire for
learning.^ This was a leading motive in mv
idea of collecting a library and to a large ex"
tent also in collecting the relics and curiosities
contained in this museum. Should such De
the effect it would be a gratification beyond
anything that money could give.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I would
express the hope that these baths may serve to
extend the reputation and fame of our fair
City, may prove a , source of health-giving
amusement to our men and women, to our
boys and girls, and fit them for the struggles of
life. p. - .
I now declare the baths open. â¢
At the conclusion of ; the speech three
rousing cheers were given for Mayor Sutro.
In a few minutes the water was alive with
bathers, and the spectators were laughing
at and applauding their antics. Cassasa's
band rendered a number of selections dur
ing the afternoon.
-In the evening there was an athletic
exhibition by members of the Olympic
Club, followed by a band concert.
LADIES' CONTEST ENDED.
Pavilion Cycle Tournament Stopped for
Lack of Patronage.
The proposed three days' ladies' bicycle
tournament at the Mechanics' Pavilion
was terminated last nicht, after two days'
riding, as Manager Wikidel found that
the public did not care for the sport. ;v 'â â

Sleeting* arid ; Fly Casting. V
â  Several mem of the Fly Casting Club
held a very interesting ; meeting ; yesterday
afternoon at ' Stow ; Lake. , As very little
wind was blowing at the time, - some very
long distance casting was done ;by Henry
Skinner, J. V Mansfield and other; noted
yielders of the bamboo. Among those who
cast lines over the lake were A. Cumming,
M. C. Allen, "Doc" Simpson, H. Goicher,'

The directors of the Olympic Club have
decided that if the members who patronize
the handball courts and are anxious for a
new building will contribute $1000 of the

immediately on the lot V that - adjoins the
club. â '-./.'â¢â¢ ->.%/-â¢â¢" : k'k : k;.V k::.k.k\kr
The directors are of the opinion that the
patrons : of vine .* game <:â  should V contribute
their share, and doubtless the money will

IKE MEXICAN VETERANS.
Preparations for a Big Time at
the Monterey Celebra
tion.
Senator Perkins in a Letter to Secre
r tary Sherman Says Bancroft Has
Done Sloat an Injustice.
The Mexican War Veterans are making
preparations for.a great demonstration to
be held on their fiftieth anniversary, July
7, at Monterey.
V The occasion is to be made, especially
notable by the laying of the cornerstone
of the monument to be erected at Mon
terey to the memory of Commodore Sloat,
the man who saved California to the
United States.
Arrangements have been made for an
imposing naval display. Hon. Edwin A.
â¢Sherman has received an interesting letter
from ; Senator Perkins anent the contro
versy over Bancroft's reference to Commo
dore Sloat. The letter is as follows : â¢'â¢â ".
United States Senate. )
Washington, D. C March.7, 1896. j
Hon. Edwin A. Sherman, Oakland, Cal.â MY
Dear Sherman: I know that you will be grati- â¢
fled to learn that I find from the official records
that your estimate of Commodore Sloat is cor
rect, and that there is no tinge of dishonor re
flecting upon him in any way for the Bancroft
charge of alleged want of promptness in obey
ing the orders of our Government in not pro
ceeding more promptly to Monterey and taking
possession of California. .- ; -
The letter herewith from Lieutenant Lucien
Young is self-explanatory. Mr. Young is ' a
lieutenant in the United States navy and has
been detailed as an assistant superintendent in
the library of the Navy Department for the
purpose of compiling and editing "The
Naval War Records of the Rebellion," and
of course is recognized authority upon the
subject-matter under consideration. I am
sorry I cannot send you the executive docu
ments to which Lieutenant Young refers, but
there are only bound volumes here, and there
fore I am unable to send them to you.' I think,
however, Lieutenant Young's letter covers the
whole ground. The documents fully vindicate
the good name of Commodore Sloat, and show
that Bancroft is, in this case, anything but a
correct historian.
I will make an. effort now to press our bill
for an appropriation for a monument to the
memory of Commodore Sloat to a successful
conclusion, but so many other bills now have
the right of way that 1 am uot so sanguine of
success as I would have been had 1 pressed it
a month or six weeks earlier, which I should
have done had it not been for this Bancroft ex
pose.
. Again congratulating you upon being right
in defending a patriotic and gallant naval
officer, whose memory has been most unjustly
maligned, I remain, very truly yours, -;.
George C. Perkins.
THROWN AT BAY DISTRICT
Serious Accident to a ; Young Man.
While Exercising a
Filly.
His Mount Collided With Terrific
Force With Two Othersâ
Horses Killed.
i A serious accident occurred at the Bay
District track yesterday morning through
which a young man by the name of ('raw
hall, in the employ of . the Southern ; Cali
fornia horseman Al Morine, will probably
lose his life. -
\ .Crawhall, together with another exercise
boy, were "working out" two fillies owned
by Mr. Chamberlain of Sari Diego. As the
pair swung into the stretch Crawhall per
ceived a horse ridden by a small exercise
boy in the center of the track and yelled
to him to "pull out." , " .
â¢ â¢ The lad - attempted to do so, but his
mount bolted, : and turning around col
lided with terrific force with â¢' the : two fast
moving fillies. ~ '
One of the animals was killed instantly,
and the other so badly injured . that it was
found necessary to destroy her. Â«.â â â¢'
*' â  Crawhall was picked up in an uncon
scious : condition, and -an examination
showed him to be suffering from a severe
concussion of the brain. Up to a late hour
last night he was still lying: in a comotose
condition, and Dr. Brigham, who was in
attendance on the injured man, stated
there was scarcely a chance for re covery.
' Strangely enough neither of the other
boys received any injury.
"It is estimated that.of.the 90.000 paupers
of London two-thirds are able-bodied and
capable of working. " V,

"man may be consulted on all. matters pertaining to
the welfare of the human race. ' p V
HE GIVES ADVICE ON BUSINESS,
Speculation, investments, insurance, love, court-
ship, marriage and divorce; settles lovers* quar-
rels, reunites the separated, and causes a speedy
and happy marriage with the one of your cho cc.
The earth reveals to him the, hidden treasures
buried in her bosom. He locates mines and burled
treasures, Interprets dreams, tells of your friends
and enemies, removes evil Influences, gives ad-
vice pertaining to. lawsuitsâ everything.' -â¢ The
troubled and unfortunate should seek â¢ his counsel.
Thousands of families long separated have been
reunited by his efforts; thousands of hearts -made
glad through his truthful predictions. He is. the
only clairvoyant on earth recognized by the profes-
sion as their brightest star. His power approaches I
tho miraculous and he might well be termed 3
the Isaiah of the nineteenth century'- All per-
sons unsuccessful in business, who seem to be un-
.lucky, should visit the Pro essor, seek his aid and p
counsel and start aright. "He is constantly in re-
ceipt of congratulations from those whom he has
assisted. Thousands have become wealthy through j
his advice. He is ever ready to assist all those ,
wi.h capital to find a safe aud good-paying invest-
ment. Young men starting in business will find it
greatly to their advantage to consult the Professor
on all matters of financial interest to themselves.
The Professor positively does all that he advertises
to do. Remember that the Professor Is perma-
nently located in San Francisco and that his past
work Is his future reference; it speaks for itself.
The Professor always gives perfect satisfaction In
all things he mentions in this notice. Developing
mediums a specialty.
THE PROFESSOR ' â¢ / - ; ,
Should not be classed among the many cheap pre-
tenders who infe t the city and bring" disrepute to
the profession. , Professor Eugene's - parlors are
visited by. business men of good repute, anxious
for re lable information as to the outcome of future
investments, and by ladies of high social standing.
Scores who have consulted him consider . his ad-
vice and assistance most valuable. He has made
fortunes for many, finding Mr them, through his
power of second sight, investments that returned
them great profit.- Many married couples who
heretofore have quarreled and led miserable lives
are now united and living contented and happy.
Drinking husbands have been reformed and re-
claimed and restored to their families. Absent
friends have been . found': wayward girls
have been shown the folly >of their , '.ways
and started In the path" of obedience* and
duty; and a moral reformation has . restored
their social standing in their community. All of
these things are of daily occurrence right lv the
heart of a great city. Letters come pouring in
from all parts of the world involving quesiions of *:'fj^.
great import and complexity, and every reply Is
most gratifying. To the troubled and unhappy his
advico is soothing and beneficial, giving them that
â peace of mind that wealth nor power can produce.
Men. of the world consult him upon matters of
business and speculation; f porting men ; upon
games of chance. Even ministers of the Gospel
send for bis wonderful Egyptian Charm and mar-
vel at his power. â  . p
- Professor Eugene is the only clairvoyant in the
Western world who thoroughly understands the
preparation and the working of the real oriental
Egyptian Charm. His truthful' reading of the
past, present and future continues tr> be the source
of great pleasure and profit to all his many patrons.

SELF-KNOWLEDGE IS THE KEY

Crowds of thinking people who. may be daily .
seen at Professor Zanzic's parlors are sufficient
â¢evidence to convince tne most skeptical that his
reading of the past, present and future are mar-
velously correct: our ci y has seen so much of
which is worthless that the very stones have
seemed to cry. "fraud" ; the press and public of the
entire country have unanimously classed Professor -
Zannc as the greatest living exponent 'of clalr-
voyancy ; then it ls little wonder that he is con-
sulted upon every subject which otherwise would
rest dormant In the breasts of humanity; a volume
could be written of his wonderful skill, yet a single

the truth-seeker ("that truth is stranger than fic-

SOME PECULIAR MARKS.
Which Have Been Placed on

Few Days.
MRS. WILMORE IS DISCHARGED.
Strong Executive. Committee Named
; . to Conduct the May -Day
. Fete.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â 908 Broadway, March 14. j
â¢-â During the past few days nearly every
residence in this city has been marked with
a hieroglyphic that nobody can decipher,
bat which is causing some uneasiness. The
marks are mostly double crossings, and in
one corner or at the top or at the bottom is
an initial or cabalistic sign. The marks are
on the right-hand side of the doorpost in all
instances and have all appeared within the
past forty-eight ours. As they have ap
peared simultaneously 'in Berkeley, Tem
escal and Oakland, it is evident that it is
the local joke of a few boys, but evidently
is the result of a concerted movement.
V Several men prominent, in secret socie
ties have tried to find out a reason for the
markings, but so far have been unable to
find any. The whole affair is a mystery,
but the fact remains that the marks are on
thousands of houses. â  N

Judge Ogden Holds the Evidence Was
â  ' Insufficient.
'OAKLAND, Cal., March 14.â second
writ of habeas corpus to secure the release
Mrs. Ella Wilmore was sued out to-day
by her attorneys on the ground that the
testimony on which she was held was in
sufficient to establish the petitioner's
guilt or" warrant her being held for trial.
It was claimed that there was no evidence
directly connecting Mrs. Wilmore with
the crime of receiving the proceeds of. the
Wilmore and Majors burglaries or evidence
of her knowledge of their acts, except that
of. Abe Majors, who was an accomplice in
efEect.
The District Attorney's office was repre
sented by H. A. Meivin, who handled, the
case in the Police Court. He contended
that the question as to whether or not
Majors was an accomplice or not was one
to. be determined by a jury, and claimed
that there were other circumstances point
ing to the guilty knowledge on the part of
Mrs. Wilmore.
' Judge Ogden said he had pursued the
testimony with great care. It was not his
duty to pass on the credibility of witnesses,
but to.determine whether there is evidence
sufficient to warrant a conviction in the
case in which the defendant was held. In
reviewing the evidence the court said that
it had been contended that the finding of
the money in Mrs. Wilmore's room was a
circumstance of suspicion, warranting the
holding of Mrs. Wilmore, and a proof of
possession by her of the money, but in the
case of The People vs. Hurleyâ 6o Cal.,
aire 74â the rule is laid down that where
the room in which stolen property is found
is not occupied exclusively by the person
charged a legal presumption of possession
must not be assumed.
ln. Jthis case it is in evidence that the
r -Cfm was not occupied exclusively by Mrs.
Wilmore but by her daughter also,' and
" I^^^-^^. te~
testimony this -connection ; of Mrs. Wil
more with the possession of the money is
established, is . an. accomplice, and Y comes
within the rule that the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice is not suffi
cient to convict. â¢ 7.
"In any view,'' said Judge Ogden in con
cluding. "I do not think there is evidence
to establish a distinct and conscious pos
session on the part of Mrs. Wilmore. Ido
not think . there is one : particle . of testi
mony warranting, the connection outside
of that of Majors, and he is confessedly an
accomplice ii his evidence is to be relied
upon. < The petition, is granted, and the
petitioner is discharged from custody."
Mrs. Wilmore wept -with joy when she
heard the last words. Leaning forward,
she grasped the hands of, .her attorney,
thanking him for her release. A party of
lady friends who havf been attending her
were in court, and they pressed forward to
congratulate her. . . ' Y-Y;

LEMONS AND ORANGES.
The Frost Hoes Them No Damage In
.' Alameda , County.
OAKLAND. Cal., March 14.-Reports
received from* all parts of the county show
that very little damage was done to
fruit of any kind. by the recent snow. and
frosts. . '".' ...-â¢. '-.'"'
In the city of Oakland, in the orchards
in the hills back of town, on the ranches
around San Leandro and Hay wards, and
at NUes and other more distant parts of
the county j there are many : orange and
lemon trees growing. Few,. persons,, if
any, have -made it a' business. to grow
oranges," but so far as any frost damages
are concerned they could do it with per
fect safety, for the record of twenty years
shows that this county is as much exempt
from frost injury as < even the 'favored
orange belt of Riverside in Southern Cali
fornia.
W. J. Dingee. who has about 100 orange
trees, says: "My orange trees are in fine
condition, and so are ray lemons. The
Mandarin or small Japanese oranges are a
sight worth seeing, the .little trees being
fairly loaded down with fruit. As for
lemons, I think there are none in the
country superior to those i grow just back
of Oakland. Neither oranges nor lemons
have been injured in the slightest degree
on mv. place."
A. D. Pryal, County Horticulturist, and
who resides at Claremont, north of town,
says that lemons are more sensitive to
frost than oranges, but they grow to per
fection in the vicinity of Oakland. He says
as far as he has been able to find no dam
age has been done.
Julius- Seulbergerp the florist, says
the frost damage in the flower gardens of
Oakland seemed to be confined to a few
tender young plants and some flowering
shrubs.* "Good oranges can be and are
grown" here," said he, "but the soil and
climate appear to be especially adapted to
lemon culture. In Frnitvale they grow the
lemon to perfection."

-.BERKELEY. Cal., March 14.â The
freshmen baseball nine defeated the Den
tal College team in a hotly contested game
this afternoon on the' Berkeley diamond
by, a . score of 13 to 10, thus winning the
silver, cup and the championship of the
university for the season of '96. The
largest crowd ' that has witnessed a TJ. C.
baseball game for the last' two years was
present and cheered the players loudly and
centinuously. The Dental College turned
out in full force and brought with them
f rom . San . Francisco at . least 200 people.
The loss of this game registered their first
defeat for the present season. What gave
the freshmen Â the game was their ,'few
errors and neat base-running. Their play
throughout was more steady than, that of
the dentals. Morden's pitching for the
affiliate- college men was not as strong as
was expected, which fact was attributed to
his recent illness, p 'â ;â  v V . :

-Oldenbourg Is Silent.
BERKELEY, Cal., March . 14.â Charles
Louis Oldenbourg, who is reported to be
an heir to the royal title of Duke of Olden
bourg and to vast landed estates in Ger
many, refused to make any statements to
day regarding the published accounts as
to the ; improbability of his ever succeed
ing to the dukedom. He appeared very
indignant at the article||in question, which
attempted to prove that he has no just
claim to the royal cognomen. He stated
that he would telegraph to his father, who
is now in -Mexico, for the complete gene
alogy of his family so that there can be no
mistake as to his identity and his direct
relationship ' with the present Duke iof
Oldenbourg. Since having come into no
toriety Oldenbourg has lived in almost
complete retirement at his fraternity house
on Bancroft way, and is seldom seen on
the streets. . % , . V 77-;"

OAKLAND, Cal., March 'â â  14. â Police
Officer Banks handed -in his resignation to
the Chief of I Police Friday. His ; action
has caused much surprise and 'has revived
all the scandals in which he figured a few
months ago when investigated by the Com
missioners.
Banks '. has ' told bis friends that he is
going to, take a position as carpenter in
San Francisco at a salary of $85 a month;
keeping Â« in repair the ; property of some
landlord. :- His salary as an officer is $100,
and* this has caused much comment as to
his purpose in resigning, p. -._ i
; Banks is the.most important witness in
an alleged case of s bribery that took place
at bis home three months .ago. It is
said that a Chinese 7; lottery man made
a deal with Banks â¢ to Y buy protection
from Chief Yof >, Police n Lloyd at Yso
much each game. Although the China
man is held for trial - there were many
peculiar circumstances connected with the
whole transaction. Banks' action in leav

surprise. ' : 'vk.-

SCHOOL MONEY GALORE
Mayor Davie Denies Certain
Statements That Reflect on
His Budget.
He Hints That Certain Publications
Have Been Made for a
Purpose.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 14. ;, f
A statement was published ' last night
that there would be a deficit in the school
fund and that it was not impossible that
the schools might have to . close for a
period for lack of money. 'Ypp
The Mayor was asked about the matter
to-day and said :
The article states in substance that there
will be a shortage of $8000 in the school fund
for this year, due to a decrease in the amount
to be received in the second Stale apportion
ment. The statement is also made that "the
wisdom of the Board of Education in not at
tempting extensive improvements at the High
Schooi ' grounds is now demonstrated," and
"It was well the board did not adopt Mayor
Davie's views." ' p- â â  7 p
The loregoing statements as appearing in
said article are false, misleading and not fair
to the public. In fixing the tax levy it was es
timated that $116,000 would be the income of
the school fund from the State, and according
to the statements of the State Controller, State
Superintendent and County Superintendent of
Schools, the total income for the school fund
from the State will be $113,244, or only $2756
less than the amount fixed in the tax levy.
I iFrom the county, $47,412 has been received,
and the County Superintendent estimates that
the balance for the year to be paid the school
fund will be $25,000, making a total: of
$72,412 for the year. As $62,000 was allowed
in the tax levy, it shows that an. excess, of
$10,412 will be available. 7
Hence the amount of funds to run the pri
mary and grammar schools will be $7656 in
excess of the total amount fixed in the tax
levy, showing conclusively that the school
fund has more than sufficient funds to meet its
obligations. ' ' .
The statement in reference to the improve
ments to the High School grounds is false, as
the High School does not receive any money
from the income of the State or county. The
entire income ,of â¢ the High School fund, the
sum of $45,000, is received from the city taxes,
and is more tnan sufficient for the main
tenance of the High School.
The following tabulation gives a correct
statement of - the funds available for the
Primary and Grammar schools for the coming
year: .-.

A BLANKET INJUNCTION
Electric Light Poles May Be
Erected in All Parts of
the City.
A Corporation That Received More
Than the Municipal Authorities
; Desired.
_Â â . . -- â¢ "p ". _. . .
The Superintendent of Streets is won
dering just how he is going to prevent the
indiscriminate placing of electric wire
poles throughout the City, in view of a re
cent restraining order : granted by Judge
Sen well, and is also a little at a loss to un
derstand how such an . order", slipped
through without his being apprised of the
matter by the City and County Attorney.
Som e time â¢ ago an electric : light; and
power company Degan erecting poles in
front of the Bly the: property on Market
street and was ordered to cease by Chief
Deputy Donovan. . The company at ?. once
went into court and procured a restraining
order, pending a suit for a permanent in
junction against the Superintendent, which
the ; Street Department supposed related
only to the poles in question. -Y V ; V V
' Yesterday the company began putting
up poles in front of . the Parrott building,
and when warned to stop the . employes
coolly informed the ' Street Department
Deputy that â¢ the courts had ordered the
Street Superintendent ;to stop hindering
them. â  â 'â '- k..-:: .
V Chief Deputy Donovan at once hurried
to the City Hall and inspected the order in
County Clerk's office. To his astonish-'
ment . he found .hat the restraining order
was of the blanket I kind, f and virtually
throws the door open for the company to
erect as many poles and in as many locali
ties as it pleases while the case is' pending.
Judge Seawell's order reads as follows:
Upon reading the complaint, duly . filed â  and
verified by the plain till in the above-entitled
proceeding, and it ; appearing therefrom that
it is a proper case for an injunction, and that
sufficient grounds - exist -' therefor, 7; and
the necessary and proper _ undertaking
having been given : upon motion of "."â  coun
sel for - plaintiff, it is ordered v that > the de
fendants in said proceeding show cause, if any
they have, before this court; in department No.
1. at its courtroom in the new City Hair in the
City and County of- San Francisco, on the 6th
day of March, 1896, at 10 o'clock a. M.," why a
writ of injunction | should not |be ; granted as
prayed for in said complaint; and it is further
ordered in the meantime and until the forego
ing order to show cause is ' heard and deter
mined that the ** departments, their officers,
deputies, agents, employes, servants Â«' and
attorney s be restrained - and ' enjoined i from .
interfering with,-. obstructing or prohibiting
this plain tiff , r its servants, , officers '-. and em
ployes from erecting its posts and making the
necessary connections with " its ' supply wires
and furnishing electric lights; to .the citizens
and " inhabitants 'â  of the ? City and . County 7of
San Francisco, and especially from preventing
and hindering from making connections with
its electric supply wires as I aforesaid on said
Market street in the said* City and County of
San Francisco in the block bounded by Geary,
Kearny, Grant avenue and Market street. pp
. It is further ordered that a copy of this order
to show cause and restraining order and of the
said complaint be served on the defendants at
least three days before the time herein fixed
for hearing. 7 7 k;k J. N. Seawell, Judge.
Judge Seawell' will probably be asked at
once to modify the order.

MISSION HIGH SCHOOL
Statistics Show the Reason Why
the Mission Should Be
Recognized..
EEV. E. B. CHURCH'S VIEWS.
The Residents Unanimously in Favor
of Having a High School in
Their Section.
It would be difficult to find any person
south of -Fourteenth street who is opposed
to the locating of a high school in that sec
tion of the City. ; XkiXiXX
In interviewing the residents of that por
, tion mapped out by the originators of the
scheme there was only one expression
of public opinion found, and this
' was that such an institution should have
been provided for long ago.
Judge F. W. Van YReynegom, who has
taken more than a passing interest in the
Mission section, when spoken to regarding
the high school question said :
"Why, of course, I am in favor of it ;
We have one-fourth of the population of
the City in the section mentioned and
more than one-half of the area of the City
and County, and yet our children have to
fo about three miles to attend any of the
igh schools. .This, distance and. the ex
pense in carfare are matters that appeal
to those living south of the line laid down
by the proposed boundary."
Ex-School Director Daniel Sewell, whose
residence is at 1105 Shotwell street, said': . ;
"When I was a School Director I tried
to have this very same subject agitated,
but unfortunately I could not obtain any
sympathizers, so the matter dropped for
the time being, But lam glad to see that
the Mission people are determined to urge
their rightful claims, even at this late date.
I hope we of the Mission will get what we
are entitled to."
James H. Winter, whose .residence and
place of business is at Valencia and Twen- j
ty-fifth streets, said: .
"No need asking me regarding my opin- j
ion. I am in favor of it, of course, and !
further, since I read of the proposition in
The Call I have looked the matter over
ana formulated some further reasons why
there should be a high school out here. 7
"Here is a : list of the schools, with the
number of classes in each school affected
by the proposition : .
Horace Mann Grammar School, on Mission
street, with eighteen classes.
Bernal Heights Primary, six classes. 'â¢
AgasEiz Primary, . between Twenty-second
and Twenty-third streets, twelve classes. :
Buena Vista Primary, Solano and' Butte
streets, four classes. ; '
Columbia Grammar, between Twenty-fifth I
and Twenty-sixth streets, thirteen classes.
Douglas Primary, corner,- of .Douglas and
.Eighteenth streets, lour classes.
Edison Primary, corner of Church and Hill i
streets, eight classes. â¢ '" '." '
Everett Grammar, Sanchez, between Six-'
teenth arid Seventeenth , streets, fourteen
classes. - â¢ -â ' : .- {
Fairmount Primary, Randall and Church
streets, twelve classes. : -
Haight Primary, Mission, between Twenty
fifth and Twenty-sixth streets, ten classes.
Hawthorn Primary, Shotwell, between
Twenty-second and Twenty-third streets, nine
classes.
James Lick Grammar, Noe and Twenty-fifth
streets, fifteen classes. -
Marshall Primary, Mission, between Fif
teenth and Sixteenth streets, twelve classes.
r Mission Grammar, Mission, between Fif- i
teenth and Sixteenth streets, fourteen classes. I
Ocean House Primary, one class. 7" : *
j Potrero Primary, Minnesota . and â¢ Napa
streets, twelve classes. â â *.;-. '.'"
Sheridan Primary, Ocean View, five classes.
South End Primary, William street, near
Henry, four classes. M^|S
South San Francisco Primary, " Fourteenth
avenue and L street, twelve classes.
West End Primary, San Jose road, near Six
mile House, three classes.
"Two evening schools, the Horace Mann
and the Potrero, added, to this list, and
approximating say about fifty pupils to the
class, will show thenumber of bchool child
ren covered by this section.
"Is not this sufficient to show the neces
sity there exists for a high school?" - â¢
i The Rev. E. B. Church, principal of Irv
ing Young-Ladies' Institute, favors having
a mixed high school in the Mission, but
would consider it good policy to remove
the Lowell School from Sutter street.where
the present Boys' High School is located.
"This building is old and must be either
rebuilt or moved, and inasmuch as this
must be done, and that soon, why not erect
it out here where there is an absolute neces
sity for it?" said he.
John H. Dawson, 1117 Valencia street,
concurred in the views of the previous
speakers, as did B. Cord of ,1200 Valen
cia, street, who considers it an outrage on
the; Mission people, who are compelled to
send their children to : the other end of
the City to finish their education. . ' \*'
School - Director Henderson, ; ex-School
Director Dr. Clinton and Joseph O'Connor,
principal of the Horace Mann Grammar
School, all favor the proposition, sas does
in fact every family living in the Mission.

THE !. SAN FRANCISCO, CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 1896.
TO REMOVE THEM ALL
N. S. Wirt Petitions the Gov
ernor for New Police Com
missioners.
SAYS HE CAN IF HE WILL.
Because the New Constitution Re
pealed the Law Under Which
They Were Appointed;
N. S. Wirt, acting wholly upon C his own
motion, so far as appears in the record, has
gone to the ' Governor .with a plea for the
supplanting of William Alvord, Richard
Tobin and M. A. Gunst . by some other
three, whom he does not nameâ leaving
that matter to the Governor himselfâ to
serve the City and County of San Fran-
Cisco as Police Commissioners.
He seems to assume that the Governor
would be pleased to : perform ' this service
of his (the Governor's) own motion, if he
saw the way clearly through the mazes of
the law to do so. Mr. Wirt, therefore, has
accompanied his petition with a long and,
as he says, thorough exposition of the law
on the matter. To the layman, too, it must
appear that be makes out a very good case.
His petition has been already forwarded
to the Governor. .He begins by saying
that he is himself a lawyer. Two impor
tant legal propositions "are set out to pro
pound : .-. and ' elucidate* the \ whole con
troversy." The first is power and author
ity to fill a vacancy in - office. -The new
constitution, ;he * says, abrogated all that
part; of the act of 1878 that directed 7 . the
"three certain District Judges'! to appoint
the : Police Commissioners. ; : Section 16 of
article XX of the constitution thus pro
vides:
; When the term of any officer ; or Commis
sioner is, not provided for in this constitution
the term of such officer or Commissioner may
be declared by . law ; and .if not so declared
such officer or Commissioner shall hold his
position as r such officer or ' Commissioner dur
ing the pleasure of the authority making the
appointment, but in no case 1 shall such terms
exceed four eears .p ..'.â¢'â¢. ;.'P.
v Whether the office is held by virtue of . an act
of the Legislature or by the power of appoint
ment the term must be limited in all such
cases to four years. It is as positive and cer
tain as ii the Legislature had provided that all
such officers shall be appointed to hold sue h
office for the term of four â¢ years. ;; That bein g
the test ;to govern, then , the > term of ; oflice of
such; Commissioners expired â : in ; 1882, their
commissions expired and all their powers and
duties by virtue of the constitution: then
ceased. Â«;*..- 7.S "â â â  - ' : .- --.7 .*â¢-.' 7. â â¢ Y-7.-.-'"
Mr. Wirt relates; the history of the ap
pointment of , the ; present : Commissioners
and declares* that I the ; Governor V made 5 a
mistake in trying to remove Gunst while
the Legislature was in session. ,V 7 p*
The term prescribed ;by law for said Gunst
to hold office was till the end of the next > ses
sion of the < Legislature. 7 He was appointed
and qualified before | the : session commenced.
The appointment was for a definite and cer
tain time, and not for the balance of the un
expired term. No one could remove him until
the end of that session except ] the I Legislature
In session, in the due exercise of Its legislative
authority granted -by the constitution. The
reason it has not done . so : for years : every in
formed man' of the State well knows. The
constitution and law sets out two separate and
distinct thtngs, to wit: Filling, vacancies and
making appointments. Section Bof article V
provides : --.."When any, office ' shall, from any
cause, become vacant, and' no mode is pro
vided by the constitution and - law for filling
such vacancy, the Governor shall -have i power
to fill such vacancy by granting a commission,
which shall expire at the end of the next ses
sion of the Legislature or at the next election
by the people." .Section 999 of the Political
Code provides: ; "When ; any office becomes
vacant and no mode is provided by law for
filling such- vacancy .the Governor must ; fill
such vacancy by granting a commission, to
expire at the end of the next session of the
Legislature or at the next election by the j peo
ple." These provisions need only a plain con
struction. p 7" '." ' 'â "
"This construction,". he says,, "will meet
every, conceivable emergency which may
rise and any other will lead the mind into
confusion and perplexity.7 To fill -the
vacancy for a certain period of, time is the
first requirement. Â« By the new constitu
tion the power to appoint for such office
was already in existence and the power to
appoint after said- act was '-. repeated was
substituted from said ' District Judges to
the Governor." â : 'â  ..'.>"; â¢ â 'â 
"This," he says, "is just as perfect and
complete as if the Legislature had i passed
an express act at that session for the pur
pose. "After citing a number of authori
ties he prays "by virtue of the -premises
that three new "Police Commissioners ; be
appointed , forthwith ; and that | you take
such legal advice and'suoh other action' in
the premises vested in you by the constitu
tion and law in such cases made 'and
provided." 'â¢ "â â â¢.* -; â '.. k- y>y ; - t
TO CONDEMN RANCHES
Board of . Health Against Hog
; Raising Within the City
' \ .Limits. ' â¢"
The . Pens at Bay View Declared to Be
a Nuisance Within the Meaning
of the Law. â¢ *
i The members of the Board of Health are
not in a very thankful ; mood Yto ward the
majority in the Health and ' Police [ Com
mittee -â  of ' the . Board ';'; of Y. Supervisors in
consequence of the -action taken by the
committee on Friday in postponing action
regarding the 'hog ranches at ; Bay.- View
for.six months, and it is more than prob
able that the matter will 1 not be allowed- to
stand as it does at present. â¢_'â¢> -y
When the committee decided to recom
mend tbe postponement, it was divided, ;
Supervisors : King, Morgenstern and Dun
ker taking the side of the ranchers, who
were before the meeting to argue that their
places were not a nuisance and a menace
to health, ; and Supervisors DimondYand
Benjamin inclining to ; support ' the Board
of Health in its efforts to have the ranches
moved to ' new locations where they = will
not endanger the public health.' .
This fact has led the health authorities
to hope that when the committee's report
comes up for adoption * on' Monday next,!
the matter will ?, be laid over 'until the

a few bosses who are stubbornly deter

strikers and officially learn of their de

held a long conference yesterday and each
will report to its respective organization. r
As stated ' a , final meeting and ' agree
ment is expected by Monday or Tuesday.
Since the strike began the union ' has
almost doubled its membership. The
Painters' Union started with about 750
members, and at last nieht's initiation this
was increased to about 1300. ' There are not
now over 100 to 150 ' non-union' painters in

There were three interesting meetings
yesterday. ' " V' ' ."' â"* '
At the meeting of the. Master Painters'
Association Friday evening a committee
consisting of Messrs. 1 p Black, ' McCord,'
Eaton, McCauley and Kuss was appointed
to /meet the executive committee of ; the
Painters' Union, consisting of Messrs. Mc-
Ivor, T Rose, Ames, Hoffman, Coffin and
Merrill. At 1 o'clock ; yesterday , the two
committees met in a back room out on
Mission street, near Tenth, and discussed
the situation for over two hours. '.- The
, master painters made a large number of
inquiries and wanted (to - know 7 if i.. the
Painters' Union is an incorporated body,
the attitude of the union on the apprentice
system, whether they objected to laborers
in the shops, "if the 'shop foremen must
belong to the union, the principles of j the
Building Trades â¢;' Council, .working-card
system, ' etc. â '.â¢.'â  - â¢ "â¢.: -â  â¢ â  '.â¢'â â  ..'
All of these questions were answered in
full by the journeymen's representatives.;
The master painters said that they were
not authorized to act, but would have to
report back to the association. They
would probably be able to discuss the
terms for a settlement with the strikers,
they said,. by Monday night. And thus
the meeting ended.
Owing to the conference of the two com
mittees the regular open meeting of the
striking painters was delayed. Upon
opening the following reports were* made:
Committees 1 and 7, Danielson chairman,
reported that on Rae's job on ". Pine street
there are two men at work and the foreman
stood guard over them. Called on George
Smith & Sons, "union backsliders, "7 who
promised not to offend again. There is no
work being done in the Latin . quarter.
The chairman said that his committee is
hot for more work. He was â¢ told to tackle
the St. Denis job, that being the toughest
in the whole lot. 7* .
.. . Committee 3,"- Wilson chairman, reported
calling on Jollye at 1106. Eddy. . He gave
In to all - damsnrls , RTlfl his mon f,->ll_ .rod
suit. .v,p'7 --"-*. 'â  , ,
The executive committee reported the
result of the conference with the committee
from the - Master Painters' Association.
Mclvor and Rose expressed the belief that
the committeemen were convinced of the
justness of the strikers' demands and pre
dicted a speedy settlement of the troubles.
The strikers would probably know some
thing definite by Monday evening or
Tuesday. V
Committee 6, Doyle chairman, reported
for the Richmond district. One of Upbam's
men promised to come in Monday night.
Upham only objected to having the fore
man in the union, but the committee told
him it was necessary to have ' the foreman
in the union. v.\ - p V â¢-â "< .:';-â¢..' ':'

of 926 Washington street, stating that he
has always paid the best wages, and advo
cated few â  nours i and '.unionism; . .'By an
oversight his name was (omitted from the
list published in The Call yesterday.
A special ' meeting of \ the Painters' , and

for .the J purpose "of. i initiating 'those who <
have desired to join since the strike began'

Union, New York City, last Sun
day answered finally the question
as to whether or not there is to be
a split in the Salvation Army.
There is a split in the Salvation Army.
Cooper Union was crowded with people,
who, upon the entrance of Ballington and
Mrs. Booth, broke into a tumult of ap
plause, waving hats and canes and crying
"Hail to our American leader." Again
and again was the outburst renewed, and
ceased only after many minutes and when
exhaustion itself checked it.
Before .this hurricane of enthusiasm,
provoked by their personal presence, Mrs.
Booth threw herself upon her knees and
buried her face in her hands. Ballington
Booth remained, with bowed*head, stand
ing.
It was a demonstration such as it is
scarcely in human nature to withstand.
They have not withstood it and have taken
their; places at the head of a corps of se
ceders from the Salvation Army.
; The Salvation Army teaches self-abnega
tion. That is its prime article of faithâ
everything for God and humanity.
The incident has given pause to the
whole world, and the great religious or
ganization, the growth of which has been
one of the wonders of the time, has been
tran&Â£xed in the public eye. Ex-'
cent to those especially enlisted the
army. has been hitherto allowed to go on
with its work without much inquiry as to
its methods. It was known to be "doing
religi m on a practical basis," and doing it
well, and as such was favored and en
courn red by almost everybody. But the
brea_ ng away from the father by the son.
supposed to be one. of the leader's most
capable and trusted lieutenants, has turned
the questioning eye of the world upon the
army. Soldiers land outsiders alike are
asking, "Why?" and "What is this Salva
tion Army that it should ask of a leader
something -which he should feel that he
ought to' refuse even at the risk of being
called 'traitor'?" .
Only a short ' time ago Mrs. Ballington
Booth was here In San Francisco, preach
ing above all things "loyalty to the flag"
and "discipline in the army." Discipline
it is' not generally known â is the super
structure 'upon ; which â¢ the army is built.
It is insisted' upon as strictly in this as in
the army of the United States. Hence the
more surprise is felt all down the line of
tY.red-shirted battalions at the action of
their late commanderâ all down the line in
the West, at least, where there seems to be
no disposition whatever to follow his lead :
in this. â¢
The cry of "Americanizing the army,"
under which the big defection has been
organized, is not new. A split was
effected under it in 1884 by Major Thomas
E. Moore, the then American Commis
sioner. He had got his accounts in a
tangle, and there was much gossip about
misappropriation of funds to the point of
a revolt, when an agent was appointed to
come over from London to investigate.
Moore resisted and immediately set up the
cry ; of English interference.
; He himself had come over as an English
man, but had had time to become natural
ized just as has Ballington Booth. Moore
declared for a distinctly American army,
appropriating the whole paraphernalia,
the uniform, the name, the War Cry and
every other feature of the army. He
carried neaily the whole American army
of *. that day with him. His successor of
the army proper had a hard contest oh
hand, but without making any special
-war and simply working on original lines
was entirely successful. Pretty soon there
was a split in Moore's army; An adjutant
had a falling . out and set up for himself.
Pretty soon again there was a split in that
corps, and, by such degrees the "Ameri
canized army" fell to pieces.
â  This is what the officers of .the
Pacific Coast Chief Division pre
dict for the Defenders' LeagueÃalling
ton Booth's enterpriseâ having ever be
fore it the example of the leader. Not one
of them has an unkind word to say of
their late commander, but all speak of his
action with sorrow and regret. But of the
"Americanization of the army," of which
bo much has been said, they uniformly
eh aracterize it as "rot."
"So. far as the working of the army 'is
concerned,'' said Brigadier Keppel yester
day, : "we would not know that England is
on the map. It is true that reports go to
the J. London headquarters monthly and
quarterly. Everything goes there so that
the London office is thoroughly posted on
the work, but it does not interfere. Our
headquarters are at New York. It is an
in herent part of the system to conform to
the national spirit and customs of the peo
ple wherever the work is prosecuted. Bal
lington Booth was naturalized when he
became commissioner to America. Com
mander Booth-Tucker, his successor, will
no doubt become naturalized.
"As for our ? sending money to London
.; it is all nonsense, it is true we do re
spond to an occasional special plea or
send a little now/and then, but in my
three years of command of this division I
do not think we have sent $1000 altogether
: : away from the coast. We do not. even
send money to New York. Yes, we do
send a percentage of our revenue to the
fund lor the support of. ftroken down bffi- |
cers as is required from V every division i
headquarters, but as we have a home here I
and take care of our ownâ the only divis- I
ional headquarters that does so that
money is returned to, us. â  \.
- . ''We know that the money that comes j
into the coffers of the army everywheie is I
put to the best possible uses; and the army
is sustained by t this bond of absolute mv- J
tual confidence. It is used for extending I
the; work, for; relieving the distressed. I
have been many years in . the army. I
entered it! with a determination" to cry out
against any fraud that I might ; discover |
â¢ â  . 1 .---,. â -.".' ... â -, ...... Â-..
Song may it
wave
I immediately I had discovered it. Either
I am a fool for not having discovered it, if
the re is any, or I am in collusion with
the m, for I declare my firm allegiance to
the admi nistration. I believe the army is
operated with no other end than to save
| â body and soul. General Booth him-
I self has said it was his great ambition to
Ibe able to say that he did . not
i gain his livelihood from the organ
! ization. He is able to say so. Three
men came forward and offered to bear the
expenses of his living his and his family.
He lives with extreme modesty, in what
most people would call poor quarters. His
children as they have grown up have all
entered the army and become self-sup
porting. No," continued the britrader,
"people who question the methodd of the
army do so because they do not under
stand its moving principle. It is the so
cialism taught by Jesus Christâ to 'serve
each other with love.' 1 -have hail many
people say to me 'If I could only get ser
vants to work for me as these girls work
for the army 1 would be willing to pay
them large wages.' But they can't buy it,
you see. They do this work for the love
of it. Don't you suppose I could go and
make my living â a very good living â in
some other line? 1 was engaged in the big
j publishing-house of P. F. Collier & Co. in
I New York when I joined the army. But
I no employer could pay me to perform the
| work 1 do here. Nobody knows what a
j strain -it- is. In any other employ
ment a man quits at a certain
hour of the day and. throws oft his
worry. This work is a part of. myself; it
is always with me. My remuneration is
only what will barely keep me. Many a
captain in the field receives more because
he has a larger family. The pay is gradu
ated not by 'ability, rank or. length of ser
vice, but by necessity alone. Neither is
there any distinction on account of rank. ]
No looking up to or bowing down before |
rank. We are bound together by a great
bond of mutual love and confidence and
assistance. We equally share ;in the for
tunes of the army. If the revenues are
short we all suffer alike, often going with
out any spending money at all. , If they
are large no one gets more than what in
any other trade would be deemed a pit
tance, for the; surplusages are devoted to
l extending the work and relieving the des
titute; yet every soldier in the army and
I every officer is happy in his work, exhaust-
I ing though it is, and would not change it.
"So, therefore, I give no thought to any
i of the insinuations as to ; Ballington Booth
I on the money question. . I know that he
j was perfectly honest. His orders to fare- |
well were only those that, were issued to !
â  all other territorial commanders. For j
: family reasons he saw fit to refuse. That !
|is all there is to it I believe. I am sorry ]
for the general's sake. It is a great blow- j
! to him, returning from the magnificent
campaign in India to find disruption in j
his own household."
This is the sentiment of all the officers j
of the army. here.
Booth-Tucker, the new American com- j
mander,' comes from India, by the way. !
Speaking of him Major Halpin.'editor of
the War. Cry, said : "His career is a strik- I
ing illustration "of ; this, very i principle of I
discipline that mostly prevails lin the
army. V Tucker was an* English Judge in
India, receiving a splendid salaryâ

"It is a part of the system that has grown

The territorial commanders expect to be

Booth has been the American commander
for nine years. Yl think General Booth has
raised himself immeasurably in the esteem
of the army of the world in that he has not
made >an exception; of ! or ? deferred ,to the
"wishes of his son in this matter. It is no

| arid ; personal, v and :Y inquire . after every
'phase of the applicant's life. These forms,
properly filled out, are sent to the division
commander and ** are examined yby -â¢',' him
alone.- He then transmits them to the
.national or territorial commander, and he
to the general headquarters.;. The appli
[ cant has also to pass a- satisfactory physi
. cal examination, especially as to his throat
; and lungs, showing himself or herself able
! to meet the demands of "field work"â
that is, speaking in the open air and under
' going. the general strain of the*' meetings,
which is said to be severe. V "7. 7 7
â " Some -of the questions required. to be
answered are of the most delicate and per
sonal nature, such as "Are you -'engaged
to be married?" :" Are you writing to any
one with the idea of marriage?" - r.
Ana among the promises exacted from
candidates is that marriage shall not be
; entered upon for some time at least.
! "These questions; and- pledges," ex
plained Brigadier Keppel, "may be thought
by outsiders who do not j understand | the
scope of the army to be an unwarranted
interference 7 in v personal matters. But
they are precautions found to be necessary.
or instance, a young woman, 'a lass,' as
we call them, may enter the army with an
entirely: pure and- devoted purpose, ex
pecting to find everything /and everybody
within the circle as good and pure as she
lis.** Some scheming rascal may see her
and enter the army, making every profes
sion of religion, as others do, and there lay
siege to and win her. When they are mar
ried he will throw off the cloak, appear in
his true colors and bring great misery to
her. Instances of that: kind caused the
general to take these precautions. Mothers
came to him and said, 'General, we cannot
allow our daughters- to enter your army
unless they and we have some protection
against such uses being made of it.' So
both women and men are required to tell
all these relationships, in order that
neither shall be made victims of."
With the application also must be sent
a photograph . of the applicant. ' -.- The ap
plication being approved, the candidate is
admitted to the training barracks; as -a
cadet. There he is instructed in the "art
of salvation"â -how to ; make visits, how to
conduct rtreet 7 meetings, how to 7 canvass
saloons and other public places,' sell War
Crys, and their judgment and - : _ reading of
human 7 nature is developed: They are
also put through a course of Bible ' study.
The garrison of the lasses is at the divi
sional 3 headquarters . .* on IV Market i street.
That for the men is in Oakland, V The gar
risons accommodate about a dozen candi
dates at one ' time and- are i always : full.
Often applicants are required to wait their
turn.' Cadets remain in the training gar
risons for six months. If they show them
selves fitted they are, upon recommenda
tion of the officer in charge, sent to some
post as a lieutenant.-'. When entering the
garrison > , they give 7 their : promise : if not
chosen for a commission to return a faith
ful soldier kto the ranks. 7
7* The lieutenant is not eligible to com
mand of a corps â a captaincy â until " after
a service of 'â  one year, so that no man can
become commander of 7a ; post I until two
years of service in the army. ;-. An ordained
minister of the gospel would have to go
through';. this - course.': Neither . influence
nor money can buy a commission.' After
the captaincy is reached promotion is , by
selection from headquarters ton the score
of merit and adaptability to the various
phases of the work. The pressman in the
"War Cry office/ for instance, is a . captain,
appointed I for ,- long i and - faithful service,

But it is the : visible results of the work
of -the; army that enlist the sympathy of
the whole people in ; its behalf, as Ensign
McFee says. Ensign McFee, under Mrs. '
Keppel, is with his wife in charge of the
social ; wing of the army's work. "We
look out for the bodies as a preliminary
step to saving the soul." The social wing
began its work in "November, 1891, by
undertaking to provide shelter for an old
lady who had been turned out of her home.
p â¢ -:.- They had considerable

the Body : feat. That was . only five
Irs ' years ago, but the array has
since then established a rescue : home for
women who have made a misstep and de
sire to reform ; a men's shelter, the place
referred to where a place to sleep
and a ' cup of coffee are provided for a
nickel ; a children's home, where j care is
taken of little ones whose parents are un
able to do so; a woman's shelter similar
to that for men recently established.
Then they have recently established a sys
tem under which prisoners as they are
discharged are taken under .their kindly
wing, work provided for them and every
opportunity given them to start life again
on proper * lines. Then they have been
making a specialty of caring for old and
friendless women. The little money
handed them from the Robinson bequest,
which stipulates that it be so expended,
started them on that tack, and Ensign
McFee says that it has also set other
people to "donating money for that pur
pose. Considerable sums of money are
donated to the different; funds that have
been established for these various institu
tions and the utmost care is taken not to
divert such sums to 'any but the stip
ulated purpose. They have, too, a re
cently : inaugurated , "children's shoe
fund." Children - cannot go to school
very well even in California with
out . shoes. Cases coming to the at
tention of .schoolteachers of children
detained at "home from this cause we re
ported to the Salvation Army. The chil
dren present' themselves to Captain Mc-
Fee, who satisfying himself that the re
port is correct, fits the child out with the
shoes, being careful to keep the old pair
so that the child must wear the new ones
away. This is a precaution as against any
temptation which the father might have
to take the shoes away from the child ami
sell them for" liquor. Ensign McFee has a
room at the headquarters for the storing
of old clothes and such things donated for
distribution. -
This is the part of the work of the army
that is said to '-" have "visible signs." It is
charity, on a big scale, but managed with
"system and care to avoid imposition. But
there is that something in what the briga
dier calls the "art of salvation" that goes
with it that is also a vissible sign, and sur
prises - the ;' onlooker. It is that ' which the
lady saw .-' who was seeking V the servant
when she said she would be willing to pay
well ' for such work and devotion ;as she
saw among the. army lassies in the army

. "For instance," said Ensign -McFee
speaking of this feature, "we had the case
of a man who had gone down, down,
down under the influence of ; liquor. Love

TARRAGUF IN CALIFORNIA
p ;s T| =^HE name and fame of Admiral
I David Glasgow Farragut are dear
I to the people by the Golden Gate
JI. for more reasons than those which
make his glorious achievements
the whole nation's common heritage.
Farragut was something of a California
pioneer. The spirit of adventure did not
bring him hither, neither did the desire
for sordid gain ; yet, although he came in
obedience to a Government order, he was
Mare Island's naval pioneer, and the
commandants of that navy - yard may
pride themselves on having as their primal
predecessor a man ;no less groat than Far
ragut.
It was in . August. 1854, that Farragut
v.as ordered to California as first com
mandant of Mare Island Navy-yard. The
site had been selected in 1852 by a commis
sion of three officers; but no navy-yard
existed as yet, and it was to be Farragut's
particular duty to plan and build it up |
under the general instructions of the de
partment. There were no accommoda
tions on the island, and Farragut and his
family lived for seven months on board an
old sloop-of-war that was anchored hard
by. For four years he remained at this
ptation, and great progress was made in
the development of the island. '
Men, now grown old in the service, who
were boys in the navy drilling at Mare
Island when Farragut. (nearly three-score
years of age) was commandant, tell numer
ous anecdotes to illustrate the great cap
tain's simplicity of character and to give
evidence of some of his remarkable traits.
Farragut was not spoiled by long au
thority. A midshipman at 10 years of
age, commanding a vessel successfully at
12 and gradually rising in the scale of pro
motion, he was "always the same simple,
unpretentious man. . The sailors loved
him, and it has been related that it was
nothing unusual for him to call up some
of the crew under his command to have a
bout with the single-sticks. He was an ex
pert in all physical exercises, and on his
birthday would invariably indulee in a
few handsprings, declaring that until such
time as he failed in that feat he should
not feel that he was crowing old. ...
While the relations of this country with
Spain are of a nature decidedly strained,
while our representatives in the halls of
Congress are making the walls of the
capitol ring with denunciation of Spanish
despotism, while students of Spanish col
leges are working themselves into foolish
frenzy and showing hatred of Uncle Sam
by tearing up a few copies of the stars
and stripes, and while students of an ex
ceptionally few American colleges are try
ing to outdo the boys of Spain by tearing j
to tatters the colors of the Baby King, it
is not wholly uninteresting to stop and '
note that the peerless naval commander
of our war of the rebellion, the hero who
ran the fiery gauntlet of ' rebel forts and
ships at New Orleans, and who. with his
glass directed the victorious Beet at Mobile
Bay while lashed to the shrouds, was de
scended from some ' of the best blood of
Spain.
"One of' his ancestors, Don Pedro Farra
gut," says Captain Mahan, "served with
great distinction under James I, King of
Aragon, in the war against the Moors,
which resulted in their expulsion from
Majorca in 1229, and from the kingdom of
Valencia, in the Spanish peninsula, in
1238." The admiral's father, George Far
ragut, was born on the island of Minorca
in 1755. As that island had previously
been ceded to Great Britain, Farragut was
born under the British flag; but he severed
his connections with his native country
and in 1776 emigrated to America, where
he espoused the cause of the colonists. At
the beginning of the century George Farra
gut's adventurous nature led him to the
frontier, where North Carolina and East
Tennessee meet, and where he wedded
Elizabeth Shine, the mother of the future
admiral. David was, therefore, of Spanish-
American descent.
During his four years at Mare Island
Farragut furnished material for many an
amusing story. He was not one of those
who would seek to awe anybody by as-

sumed gravity. His part was not acted
with the consciousness of mere acting. If
he thought ho was doing right he did what
be chose to do and had no regard for criti
cal opinion.
He built the commandant's bouse, put a
neat fence around it, and bordered the
fence": with rose bushes. Farragut took
delight in these rose bushes, as they made
such homelike adornment. Some cows on
the island looked upon â¢ roses as a dainty,
meal and several times a hush had been
pulled up by. the roots." -
"One Sunday morning," said the narra- I
tor of this ' incident, : '' Captain and Mrs.
Farragut, the clergyman and I started |
from, the commandant's .house to the j
chapel. , We y, were proceeding slowly j
toward Ihe place of devotion and listening |
to some instructive "observations from the
preacher on . ay solemn - Script tiral; topic, i
Suddenly, ami without a bit of .warning I
Farracut sprang away from us and ran as j
fast as he could toward the house. ; Simul
taneously v. c noticed a stray cow : playing
havoc with a bush of ' - roses. '- The t
cow was gifted with rare instinct.
Sho heard the captain's footfalls,
and straightway left her honeyed meal
and sauntered down the road. A moment
later, Farragut reappeared, horsewhip in
hand. He glanced down the road and
then started on a wild run after that cow.
The animal moved slowly till the captain
was within a few yards of her. Then she
threw up her tail, perhaps in scornful de
fiance, and quickened her pace. Farragut
was determined and doubled his speed.
For half a mile they raced, and then the
captain came back." He was so wet with
perspiration that he looked as if he had
ducked his head in the water.
" 'All I wanted,' said he. 'was to get one
good crack at that infernal cow. Just one
cut! When I fail in such a thing as this,
it makes me think I'm getting old.'
"Then the captain slapped the dust off
his clothes and went into the chapel to
hear the services."
Imagine what a picture it would make
for the marines and sailors to-day were
the Mare Island commandant to take a
notion and chase a predatory cow half

way across the island in the vain endeavor
to get a cut at the animal with a whip!
But Farragut had taken it into his head to
give that cow a lesson, at that very proper
time, even at the sacrifice of a part of the
Sunday sermonâ and he was a faithful
church attendant, too.
Farragut was in bis fourth year
when he assumed charge at Mare Island;
but he was as active as a boy. In those
days he weighed about 135 pounds, being
of rather slight build, ln height he was
five feet seven inches. It was a common
thing for him to vie with youthful friends
in the performance of gymnastic tricks.
He liked to stand, backed up against the
wall, and then, without bending his knees,
stoop over and touch his toes with his
bands; and he would laugh heartily at
young men who failed. to do the. trick. In
pleasant sports and pastimes he rejoiced.
While Farragut was in charge at Mare
Island the little pilot-boat Fennimore
Cooper arrived there from Japan and
Bering Sea and was held for service on the
bay. She was a swift-sailing craft, and the
commandant took her out on his excur-
sionsand boasted cf her speed.. The top
sail coast survey schooner Ewing visited
Mare Island during' these ; times, under
command of a; : young Â£ lieutenant. The
Ewing was a vessel of good size and by her
officer reckoned â ' fast. : The day and hour
came for tho Ewing n to depart. ? Shortly
after she had set sail there was commotion
on the shore. V Commandant Farragut was

anything be wrong? Why should he deem
it necessary to overtake the Ewinsr, when
she had only a few minutes before set sail?
The men on .shore remained guessing,
while Farragut sped ; away on the Fenni

returned. 'Then the people flocked down
to the -shore to hear what news the com
mandant might bring. *.
"Boys," cried he, laughingly, "we gave

thought to , the idea of himself, a high
naval officer/ in , a mean little vessel, sail
ing in contest against a fine, big craft pre
sided over by an inferior. He had the fun
and the sport of beating the Ewine, and
that was all he cared for.
The commandant was a strong believer
in hypnotism, which in ' those days was
known under the common term of .mes
merism. He beiieved it to be a force in
nature. The way he came to be convinced
that there was something in mesmerism
was as follows: . .
When Farragut was a first lieutenant,
and on board ship in one of the Eastern
navy-yards, the ship surgeon operated on
a negro member of the crew. The black
was made the subject for mesmerism.
One morning, when the boatswain yelled
"All hands up hammocks," there was one
hammock that failed to go up, and that
hammock belonged to the negro boy, who
lay listless and unmindful of orders. This
breach of discipline was immediately re
ported to the offieer'of the deck.
. Aboard ship culprits are chalked out on
j the logbook and at a certain time of day
j are called before the mast to answer to the
I charge that stands against them. The
| negro boy duly appeared before the mast,
I when the surgeon stepped up and cx
i plained to the officer of the deck that the
' boy was not to blameâ that the young
darky had been mesmerized. After this
the captain of the vessel dictated an order
to the surgeon warning him not to repeat
his mesmeric experiments aboard the
ship, as they were hurtful to the necessary
discipline. " ;^' p
__ Farragut was afterward on shore leave at
Norfolk, Va., when his attention was again
called to . a mesmeric feat. /'ln the house
where he was staying a negro servant had
as regularly as clockwork washed the front
steps and polished off the big front door
every morning before 9 o'clock. His mas
ter found him, with his work undone,
asleep on the front steps. He scolded the
negro harshly, when that *, tame surgeon,
who was also enjoying shore-leave, made
his appearance and excused the negro, say
ing he had noticed that the fellow was
about to begin work and thought he would
see if it wasn't possible to put him to sleep.
The surgeon then astonished the behold
ers,' Farragut among the number, by
breaking the spell and bringing the negro
back to consciousness.
Among the close friends of Farragut
during his four years on this coast was
Commodore C. H. Harrison of Sausalito.'
"Farragut was worshiped at Mare Island
and Vallejo," said the commodore. "His
life on the island, however, was compara
tively uneventful. Nevertheless he showed
himself to be as full of energy as an egg is
full of meat. Few men in his position
would haye striven to build up the island
as be did. . He did not scruple to get right
in with the laborers and to furnish. an
example of how a thing should be done.
I recollect one day being on the island
when Farragut was overseeing the sink
ing of a. well. It was noontime and the
laborers had finished for the morning and
were leaving the hole. I was -looking for
Farragut,' and .'my query as to his where
abouts was answered by somebody!direct
ing me to that well. I went over, and was
rather surprised 'to see at the bottom of
the hole, pecKing away at the earth, and
all arrayed in bis naval uniform, the com
mandant of the island,' David Farragut.
'There are very few officers in the service,'
thought I, 'who would sacrifice a portion.
of their dinner hour to such labor as Far
ragut is engaged in.' "
A story full of amusement is told of one
of the earliest ''â¢functions'': at Mare Island.
The stone dock and ; drydock were com
pleted in Farragut's time and he had : de
cided on a day for the opening.' He "had
not planned 'nor did ho anticipate a cele
bration on any extensive 'scale, and had
made no elaborate preparations for the
event. His friends had concluded, how
ever, to make the day a memorable one.
The day came and the crowd that came
with 'it; amazed the commandant with its
proportion. Â£ There; were men ;? of g promi
nence s from all: around the bay and they
had to be entertained. 7 " " p, .
The commandant â¢ knew that the crowd
had to be fed, and he was thunderstruck to
learn from his steward that the stock of
liquors was down almost to nothing.
Farragut I was.' equal *to j the emergency.
He summoned a servant and ordered him
to go with all possible haste to various offi
cers on the island and request them to con
tribute whatever liquors they could spare
for the general benefit of the occasion. ;fp.
| The officers responded V nobly. y White
bottles and red bottles -and i black bottles
poured into the gap to supply 'â â  theâ¢defici
ency.; The stone dock and 1 drydock were
opened with any . amount of impromptu
eloquence. Then the i crowd was invited
up to the commandant's house to drink to
the future usefulness of tie new improve
ments. V The crowd was not very, hungry,
but it , was an awfully thirsty crowd. The
liquor held out well.' 77 ' -V. ' ; '.
V 7 After the â¢â  feast :- Commandant v Farra gut
could not hide a look : of pain. Calling a
friend to one side, be exclaimed i\!Tm' en
tirely amazed at some of my officers.; Some
of them who have always borne reputations
for sobriety are reeling around under i the
influence of liquor. lam actually shocked,
and would never believe such a thing were
I not myself a witness to "it." YYYYY^Y "â '<"* 'l"kk'
k ; Th e whole : matter ? was *Â« soon 'i explained *
from the kitchen, where thÂ»i> servant who
had superintended the distribution of the
liquor had got into a row on account of
assertions ?; that .; he didn't know t whisky
from ; lemonade. He \ might : have t known '
lemonade, 7 but of ; fortified yj liquors 7' his
ignorance was supreme, lie was forced to
confess , that,' in order not *to be serving
drinks outof all sorts of bottles (thus ex
posing the scheme of the emergency con
tributions) he bad poured brandy, whisky,
rum, gin ; and high wines into t one â¢ big
demijohn. One "glass of this combination
was enough to stagger the stoutest man.
; "I suppose I owe my friends and officers
an apology," said Farragut, "but perhaps
the best thing to do in the premises is to say
nothing. Men who can stand such liquor
as that and live have one of ; the elements
of greatness in them. T I imagine that the
opening of th* drydock /fill .be strongly
remembered by many for a number of
days." kk
';. The tilt between Commandant Farragut
and Commander Boutwell of the warship
John Adams is, a matter of history. Ac
cording to Commodore Harrison, Farragut
was a strong vigilance committee man.
V "When boutwell came ashore on the
night of his arrival in the bay," said the
commodore, "Farragut escorted . . him
through the City. When Farragut saw the
vigilance array â 4000 men under arms and
organized like an armyâ he said: 'Call this
a mob ? ;.: Why, this is one of the finest
bodies of men I ever saw. They open
ranks to receive us like veterans.'
"Farragut passed through 7 the ranks
without a question. He saw the elements
that made up that army, and appreciated
the gravity of circumstances that had
made necessary such an uprising."
; One of the most interesting of the many
reminiscences of Farragut told by Commo
dore Harrison is one giving an account of
the former's opinion of Heavy ordnance.
In 1855, just after the battle of Petro
paulovski, which resulted in that -post
falling into the hands of the allied
English and French fleets, a number of
the men-of-war engaged in the affair
visited San Franci. Co. Among the English
vessels was the Amphitrite, which carried
a 7-inch gun, something very wonderful
.in those days. - The ; commodore went
aboard of the Amphitrite soon after she
anchored off Sausallto and of course viewed
its big gun, which the commodore said had
done good work at Petropaulovski. The
following day being at Mare Island Howi
son told Farragut about the 7-inch gun.
"Yes, that's a big gun," said Farragut,
"but it's of no use-in real service. Why,
Harrison, I'd be willing to have the Eng
lishman fire away at ray ship all day
if .1 was a mile; and- a quarter
away, and if I was in a small
boat I'd stand it at the distance of a mile.
A gun like that will carry a big shot and
make a loud noise, but it can't be relied on
to shoot with any accuracy. There is
nothing like our 32-pounders to do effec
tive work."
To show his faith in the latter the com
mandant ordered a 32- pounder got in readi
ness, and having; anchored a mark in the
stream at a distance of a mile and a
quarter, tired.several shot? at it, but with
out success. Finally he called up an. old
quartermaster,. who trained the piece and
knocked the target to pieces at the first at
tempt. Farragut then, frankly acknowl
edged that 32-pounders could not always
be depended on even at that distance. He
was greatly astonished, however, a few
days later when Harrison recounted the
result of his sscond visit to the Amphitrite.
The English captain on hearing of: Far
ragut's doubt as to the efficacy of his 7
inch ; gun ' ordered it cleared away, and
training it on a rock in the bay just one
and a third miles distant knocked the
top of it â '. off. Two other shots were
plumped into it, and shattered if to piec-s.
"As to Farragut's simplicity, of man
ner," continued Commodore Harrison, "he
was easily approachable and unpreten
tious, but you could never tread on . his
corns./ He was a man, every inch of 'him,
and he believed in giving every man a fair
show. He was a born sailor, too, and
loved a race over the waves as much as
any one."
. The -commodore takes pride in a cane
that was recently presented to him by a
naval officer. It. was made from wood" of
the old Harford, Farragut' 8 flags hi d, the
good old vessel that will ever be known in
-connection with - the admiral's- glory and
that now awaits the touch of the rebuilder
off the island where Farragut planted the
navy-yardâ the island that .might with
propriety be '"â  fechristened "1-arragut's
Island.'' -â ' V .
Some Grotesque Dog Exhibits.
So far as any dog show can be said to
have interest that lacks the presence and
support pf .Lobengula, the exhibition of
chow-chows, ; schipperkes and otner for
eign dogs opened yesterday at the Aqua
rium is very interesting indeed. It is a
show without mastiffs, or bulldogs, or ter
riers, or collies, or any of the recognized
orthodox dogs. It confines itself to strange
nightmare, grotesque, gruesome, gargoyle
animals, some of which cause persons with
preconceived religious ideas on the sub
ject of dogs to arop down dead at first
sight, while others send people coming
suddenly upon them into nervous shivers
or tits of wild, maniacal laughter. There
are chow-chow dogs in like numbers; they
come, like other curious things, from
China and Japan, but in comparison with
some of the .other breeds and alleged
breeds exhibited' they are of fairly Chris
tian appearance. They arc foxy-headed,
sharp-eared, woolly coated things. Some
are fawn, some black and some griz
zled, but they all have jet-black
tongues and jet-black roofs to their
mouths, so that the effect /when they
yawn is something lika that of a piece of

HOW JAPANESE MARRY
The Question of Love Is Not
Considered by Either
Party.
. '- â * â , â¢-;
THINK LOVE MATCHES IMMORAL
Very Often the Bride Does Not See
Her Spouse Until the Knot
Is Tied.
It is not commonly known that the
Japanese look ..upon, marrying for love as
positively immoral. V They say. that to
choose a companion for life is to place one
self on the level with the lower animals.
A pure, noble and unselfish love, there
fore, is unknown to nearly all Japanese
excepting those who have come under the
influence of Western ideas. I have in
mind one very notable exception to this
rule. Among 7 those whom it was my
pleasure to know intimately was a young
woman about 26 years of age, who, having
received no less - than . fifty offers of . mar
riage, had refused them all. Venturing to
ask her one day why this was she confided
to me the following story : '.'When I was
a girl about 14 years old I became engaged
THE GIRL .who HAD over fifty offers of marriage.
I _ io7)i a photograph. Â» -''
to a young man a little older than myself,
and,' like you foreigners when you marry,
we truly loved each other. Being, young
and not so wise as we might have been
; we naturally sought each other's company
: when opportunity offered, and thus be
; trayed to our relatives and friends the
; affection that existed between us. As
j soon as it was discovered, several old
j women came "to my mother and said:
| 'This will never do. Your daughter and
| this young man actually love each other.
i It is a disgrace. You must oreak off the
match at once, for everybody is taliting
about it, and they will never be happy.'
So after some delay my ; mother very re
luctantly compelled 4 me to" abandon the
thought Of marrying, and never have any
thing more to do with; my lover. This
nearly broKe my heart, and- ever since
when any man is suggested to me, I com
pare him with the lover of my youth, and
that ends all thought of marriage." And
so this young woman ..had to suffer for
having lived two three generations
ahead of her time. It is this idea of love
that has given rise to the custom of having
all matches made by a go-between, a man
being g prohibited Iby | all j sense of decency
from addressing a woman with a view to
marriage. This feeling, that people must
never marry for love, sometimes leads to
amusing little deceits. YfA Christian young
man of ; my p acquaintance, having -â¢â¢â -' very
cautiously -.â observed the V young ladies
in :Ya girls' vj> school, made up his
mind r that fay certain ( one would '. mate
him a good wife. We .would say ? that ; he
fell in love; but not so in Japan. .-, He went
to ] an ;: elderly married ? lady , and y put ; the
case before thus: ' 'My ; father is very
anxious that I should marry soon, and if I
do not V find Ta j Christian wife ss he i will
surely compel me to marry an unchristian.
Therefore Iâ¢* ought to ! become ; engaged as
soon as possible.. I have no special choice,
but I think perhaps Miss K. would make a
good wife." JY So the - matter was V talked
over by the numerous friends and relatives
on i both ; sides, but ;it was . finally/decided
that ?- she, though of lower * rank LasJ to
family, was too â  good; for Â» him I because of
her superior education. This is as high a
tribute as I ever heard paid to the educa
tion :of women in Japan. While * the ma
jority of girls would rather marry almost
any one than to run the risk- of being a
bachelette this custom of having parents
or friends , choose a girl's life companion
sometimes drives a girl almost to despair.
One very bright and worthy young woman
about 22 years old told me her experience/
This is her story: -7 " ' v *;> 1 ykykik
"When I was a girl, there being no boys
in the family, and I the elder of two sis
ters, my father adopted a boy, with the in
tention of ' having . him marry V me. We
grew up together as brother and sister,
and 7 when I :-; was 14 it was suddenly an
nounced to us that we must marry at a
certain date Â not j far distant. I rebelled ,
and tried f. to : persuade ; ray: parents to let
me continue at school, as women's educa
tion, was a subject much talked of at the
time, but it was of no avail. This be
havior simply led pmy parents : and
friends to . denounce me as a re
bellious and V disobedient V daughter."
This girl's ; husband ran away soon
after they were married, having got
into some serious money difficulty, and she
thinks he is dead, but feels no sorrow for
his loss. She is soon to marry a good and
respectable man of her own choosing. A
few years ago the way was opened lor her
to take the course of study in a school for
girls, where her record both in scholarship
and deportment was above reproach.
During the period of engagement young
people know nothing of courtship as in
this country. If they are even seen to
gether unpleasant stories are apt to be
started about V them. Sometimes an
engaged couple will happen to meet at
some gathering of friends,; when neither
will appear to see the other, 1 and they will
try to avoid even looking at each other.
It is a common thing for two young people
entire- strangers to k become engaged
through the efforts of a' go-between and
not meet even once until the day, of their
marriage. This is considered an ideal
'r# -
I match, and if the wife is very humble, has
| no will of her own and succeeds in pleas
j ing her husband in every little detail it
| will be a happy marriage according to
i Japanese ideas. But should the wife have
j a little of the spirit of new Japan, or should
| she fail to please her master and her
mother-in-law in every particular she is
i apt to be sent home in disgrace,: and an-
I other wife takes her place in a few days.
I If she has a child her husband keeps "it,
and thus all the joy of that young mother's
life V suddenly fades away. " Many of
I these poor creatures, half demented
I because of all hope in life thus blighted, are
j dragging out a miserable, lonely existence.
There may be seen on the streets of one of
the cities "of Japan to-day a forlorn look
ing woman, playing a banjo and singing
from door to door to earn a few pennies.
She s was once the wife of a man who is
now living with his third wife, and who is
looked upon as a man of influence in the
community, being the principal of a large
public school.
.No sooner is . a couple united in mar
riage than the husband, assumes a very
commanding attitude toward his wife, in
order to let her know from â : the beginning
that he is master. She is kept very closely
at home and never dares to go -anywhere
without asking his permission, which is
often refused.; So the young wife is not
only in constant fear lest she displease her
husband and be divorced, ; but she is
obliged to remain in the house like a pris
oner, Statistics; show that two out of
every three marriages in Japan result in
divorce. No lawsuit is necessary to annul
a marriage, just as no ; legal ceremony is
required to unite people in the bonds of
matrimony. When a man takes a wife,' he
registers ' her name ; as belonging to his
family, and ' when he j Wants to - make a
change he simply transfers her name back
to her father's family. To celebrate the
marriage friends are invited, and several
hours are 1 spent in eating, drinking and
having a good time generally. ; Sometimes
a man begins even "before the marriage to
humble his wife. A widow once told me
that when her intended came into the
room on the night before they were to wed
â¢he said to some; one so she "could hear it,
"Humph 1 I thought she was better look
ing." She was undoubtedly a pretty girl,
however, and her : eldest daughter ;is now
one of the â  handsomest young women in
Japan. A3 girls are taught from their
early childhood to look upon their broth
ers or other boys as their superiors, women
accept an inferior position in the house
hold economy very gracefully, they do not
rebel when ordered to do anything as
though they were servants; and always ex
pect to occupy a more lowly place. '
When we consider how 7 very light a
thing it is in Japan to break the marriage
tie we ' can '.*. the * more readily] understand
how girls sometimes think it a meritorious
thing to lead an immoral life for the sake
of supporting : their parents ; k how others
are | seen 1 carrying their ; illegitimate chil
dren without any thought of shame, and
how others still consider the position of a
concubine an honorable one. The Em
peror of Japan is the son of "a' concubine,
as is also < the Y present heir ; to the throne.
In this way only has it been possible to
keep one family' on the throne 'for 2000
years, the ? greatest boast of .' a Japanese
subject to-day. , . , V â :.- *--
kk No V doubt v some wives yY really V be

no demonstration of y affection is ever
allowed 3 between men and V women even
though i they be ;: married. Y 'A . wife must

When the war between \ China and Japan

an American friend if her* husband, who
was a military officer, had /been chosen to
go to Korea, and she replied with tears in

THROUGHFARE
DO you know Kearny" street? I |
fancy most readers of The Call
giving an ; unhesitating and
affirmative answer to the ques
tion. Nevertheless, I doubt if
many San Franciscans really know Kearny
street; queer, suggestive, businesslike,
sordid, solendid, repellant, fascinating
Kearny street, wherein one jostles and
meets and passes in the course of an hour's
walk all sorts and conditions of men, and
encounters the outward and visible evi
dences of nearly every known phase of
human existence.
Whether one starts from the fountain,
circled with newsboys and violet venders,
ana climbs upward to the rookeries on the
hill where the thoroughfare's aspirations
culminate, or starts from Telegraph Hill
and manes the descent to where its teem
ing life unites with that of Market street,
the impression received will be much the
same. A constant succession of strange,
unfamiliar pictures, glimpses of quaint
foreign life, little touches of human nature
that bear witness to our human kinship,
visions of fashion and wealth and beauty.
a suggestion of travel and a keen savor of
adventure and the possibilities that lurk
in the unexpected, all these are part and
parcel of Kearny street from end to end.
Up from the steep, cleated walks that
climb Telegraph Hill wander devious by
ways whence issue quaint and pictur
esque, or startling and grotesque, pathetic,
laughable, sometimes even beautifuL and
always interesting figures. This City is
sometimes called colorless, but never by
him who has climbed Kearny street. The
old, weather-beaten houses "are gray with I
age, the premature age of houses early
fallen a prey to change and vicissitude. \
They are green with mosses that flourish!
in the damp air, showing rich reds and '
yellows and browns where the tender Cali- j
fornia sun has kissed them into beauty and i
bleached to a peculiar ashy whiteness by
the salt sea air. The people, too, add to I
the bright kaleidoscopic effect, even amid i
their dmginess, and especially upon Tele- '
graph Hill, the bending blue sky, the
rounding, curving outlines of the farther
green hills and the reds and browns of the
clayey roadway make a wonderful setting
and background for the whole.
One gets, perhaps, a better idea of this
most picturesque street in making the de- j
scent from Telegraph Hill. I climbed its
steep sides the other day, to where, about
the tall electric-light mast, a group of boys
were flying their kites in the strong March
wind. A gang of men were at work aoout i
some sheds that were being newly roofed, j
and about them hovered a throng of boys j
and girls â sturdy street arabs â of all na- ;
tionalities, bearing away old shingles and j
stray bits of wood. One urchin had con- j
trived a queer kite from a broad shingle,
and was endeavoring to raise it against
the breeze. He made a pretty picture as I

The STAKE-LIGHTS
off
Point San Bruno
WHEN the Government en-
NX //\ / gineers first figured on erect
>V/ \\/ ing navigation lights off
V V Point San Bruno, several
years ago, they were con
fronted with a difficult problem. The con
ditions were most unusual, possibly rot
occurring elsewhere in the United States,
and none of the accepted systems seemed
to fit the case.
Point San Bruno is that portion of San
Mateo County that projects into the bay
near South San Francisco. As traffic in
that direction is not very heavy an expen
sive lighthouse was out of the question.
At the same time it was known that an oc
casional southeaster was in the habit of so
stirring up the surface of the water as to
make the ordinary stake lights, used at
the mouths of rivers and in sloughs, abso
lutely worthless. It was suggested to place
the lights on . shore, but this was also
found to be impracticable, as the contour
of the hills was such that the lights could
only have been seen from a certain direc
tion.
There was a real need for the lights two
decades ago, but they did not become an
absolute necessity until the Baden Meat
Company put up their establishment and
began bringing in cattle at night. The
problem had to be solved then, and Cap
tain Mariner, a retired shipmaster, who at
the time wa3 working on the meat com
pany's new bulkhead did it. The lights
were put up according to his suggestions,
founded on what his years of experience
told him was needed, and they have an
swered every requirement from that day
to this. Â ,
The Point San Bruno lights are known

to the department as stake lights, but they
are in reality very different, and are called ,
by that name for want of a better one.
In all there are three lights off Point
San Bruno, although one is. within the
dredged channel and is of little import
ance. The two outer ones are each about ,
a quarter of a mile from land in compara
tively shallow water, but can only be
reached by a small boat. They are ex
actly alike and were built at the same
time, so that a description of one will
answer for both.
The principal portion of the San Bruno
Point lights might be called a tower. This
is a three-cornered structure built of piles
driven in the mud that rise about twenty
feet above the surface of the water at low
tide. On the top there is a triangular
platform, each side of which measures
about twelve feet. A small house is built
on tbis platform that is used for filling and
trimming the lamps and also for storing
extra material and" tools. In the center of
the triangle of piles there is a fourth pile
that rises ten feet above the platform. On
the top of this, which is thirty feet above
low tide, the lamp is fixed. This pile is
also used as a ladder for the keeper.
To meet all requirements the lamp is of
peculiar construction. It is made to burn
eight days without attention, provided no
! accident happens. This is necessary, as
in bad weather it is often impossible to
get anywhere near the tower without
great danger. The lamps are allowed to
burn all the time, but are of course at
tended to everyday if the weather permits.
The lamp is what is known as a "tubular
I lens lantern." ;It is about two feet high
and nine inches in diameter. It will give a
light equal to about twenty candle-powers.
The oil reservoir is on top, so constructed
that it will not become heated from the
flame below. Mineral oil is used that is
fed to the wick much on the same principle
as in the old-fashioned student lamp.
The wick is made of such material that it
does not "char" easily and will last a long
time. The flame. gradually gets dimmer

haired, laughing baby high in the air. . A
dark-eyed daughter of the Romany Rye
accosted me as I descended, smiling in

blue striped shawl that covered beau and
shoulders. "Tell your fortune, lady?" she
pleaded, f shook my head. "She hits it
every time," urged a companion who
ing, but is, of course, bright enough fcr
all purposes. The lamp is fastened to the
pile by a set of springs that clutch it
around the bottom and firmly hold it in
place. It is always removed for the pur
pose of being lighted, and afterward re
placed.
Both of the Point San Bruno stake
lights are in charge of Captain Mariner,
the man who designed them and helped
put them up, and his ' job is at times a
wearisome and hazardous one. Unlike
most other lightkeepers, Captain Mariner
does his watching from shore. All night
long, in all sorts of weather, he walks over
the hills, keeping a close watch on the
beacons out on the water. If everything
goes well he has no trouble, but if a sud
den storm comes up and one of the lights
is extinguished It is his duty to relight it
if possible. To do this it is necessary to
take a' small boat and row through the
breakers for over half a mile, and should a
heavy sea be running this is a most dan
gerous undertaking.
â¢ At one time Captain Mariner used to go
to the lights by himself, but now he al-

ways takes somebody with him in bad
weather. The reason "for this is that on
one occasion he went out alone, and while
he was looking after the â¢ light the storm
increased so in fury that he was unable to
get ashore again for several hours.' It was
an awful night, the captain "- says. y: The
tower was shaken so violently r by waves
that almost reached i the platform that he
thought each moment it would be carried
away. His boat at last .went adrift, and
even after the storm had subsided he had
to wait several hours until help came.
In nice weather. the captain's job is not
so bad, as there is little to do beyond a
pleasant row each morning to fill and trim
the lamps. But the location of Point San
Bruno, at the y foot of a ? range of hills,
makes the atmospheric conditions uncer
tain, and many days when the sky is
cloudless and the weather warm a cold
wind will blow and the bay will be stirred
up by squalls;
The Point San Bruno lights are no longer
of much use to the Baden Meat Company,
as cattle -< seldom come by .steamer any
more. The lights, however, have become
of such importance to bay :. shipping that
the Government still maintains them.

At an early age he "'. went ; to -; sea with his

eral packet ships that 'sailed between the
Atlantic coast and England. During the
war he did a little work in the way of run
ning the blockade. Captain Mariner came
to California about 1866, but was unable to
get a ship on account of the depression in
the snipping business. He at last accepted
a position as superintendent of a pile driver.
The pay was good and he "liked j the work
so well that he stuck to it and never went
to sea again. "

The canine population of the upper end
of Kearny street is as interesting, as full
of picturesque suggestion as are its human
denizens. Assembled in solemn caucus in
the; center of the road in ; one block I
counted a French poodle, an Irish setter, a
dachshund, a spitz, a fox terrier and a bull
dog, besides any number that were just
dogs. The sight brought ;to mind Josh
Billings' dictum: "There iz 500 dawgs j in
this here town, and 250 of em cud dew all
the bizness."
They were interesting, however, â¢as an
indication of the various^iationalities that
people this part of our City, for beyond a
peradventure nearly every doglet of them
represented an owner to whom he stood as
a reminder of other days in sunny France,
in the Vaterland, in "the ould counthry,"
or "at 'ome," wherever may have been the
place left to try fortune in this strange City
by the Golden Gate. " â 'â¢'
Little Italy, little . Mexico, lesser Spain,

A little lower down and the street skirts
the Chinese quarter. Warned by a queer,
high-keyed yell of the approach of danger,
I turned aside in the descent, just in time
to avoid collision with a "three-abreast"
team of gayly attired Mongolian urchins
dashing along at a pace that showed them
to be thoroughly imbued with the Ameri
can spirit of getting there. They were
driven, their Jong queues serving as capi
tal reins, by a fourth lad of their race, and
their queer little coats flapped wildly bacK
in the breeze as their ridiculous little silk
clad legs worked like small pistons to the
accompanying ; clatter of their absurd
shoes.
It looked like an illustration from the
Arabian Nights' tales, and the impression,
was still with me as I watched a crop
headed, red-fezed, candy-peddling Syrian
dodge the rushing quartet as they whirled
in their wild career over the back trail.
Portsmouth square and the cheap-clothing

of old California when it comes to the
City always seeks out Portsmouth square.
Tired, bewildered, almost lost in the con
stantly making changes, it comes to rest
on the plaza benches to muse upon the
mutableness of all things Californian and
talk to any one who will listen of those
wonderful days "when the water came up
to Montgomery street." Among the pic
turesque loungers always to be found in
the plaza you may surely reckon upon
finding one old-timer come up to see the
sights, and so surely as you linger near the
bench whereon he sits you will catch tLe
oft- repeated phrase, "Why, I remember,"
prefacing some new reminiscence of the
old days. We should; note him when we
see him with his broad-brimmed hat,
his impossible coat and his high
heeled boots. for he is passng
from our midst more rapidly than we
realize. Turk and Christian, Greek and

AN ARCHITECTURAL CURIOSITY.
It Is the Oldest House Now Standing in Fresno County.
The oldest house in Fresno County, and
possibly in the whole San Joaquin Valley,
is still standing not far from the : ruins of
Millerton, the former county ' seat. Aside
from the interest that its age gives it, it is
also worthy of study as an architectural
curio, or monstrosity. The house is built
of adobe bricks, but the Spanish style of
structure with which that cheap and ser
viceable building material is associated is
nowhere apparent. 'â ;' At first, glance the
house would not appear so unusual, , but a
few minutes' study will reveal the fact that
it is in a class by itself. ' There is a little of
several styles of architecture in the general
shape of the house, but they were never
before seen in an adobe structure. In fact
the more it is studied the more it seems
like an architect's nightmare, and the
wonder is that it has not fallen down long
ago.'
.The house is said to j have been built by
a Mrs. Leech about forty-five years ago.
She was quite a wealthy Eastern lady who
had her , own ideas "about i everything.
From the. general appearance of the struc
ture it would seem as if she had one of the
old log cabins of Illinois in view when she
gave her directions. This is apparent in
the two end walls, which run to peaks,
and also in the chimney, which is built on
the outside ; and rises to a considerable
height above the roof. The doorway is of
enormous size. It has double doors of
heavy oak, something after the style of old
colonial houses. . The ground plan is
square, each : side being about forty feet.
The walls are about three feet thick. The
roof is of the old English thatched style,
.and is still in good condition, although it
has received no attention for years. The
ridgepole is only a thin sapling, and in no
way adds to the strength of the structure.
; The wonder is that the end walls have
stood so long with nothing to brace them.
How the beam across the top of the door
sustains the enormous weight of the adobe
wall above it is another thing past under
standing. TheY wall 'of â  the front is still
further weakened by what appears to be
a second-story window.

queer things can be seen -as on the out

Great Sahara. v
; The Biskran oasis, with its 150,000 trees,
is only about two miles long, and extends
in half a dozen little villages by the Oued
stream. The Arabs, in their poetic phrase

Queen," the "Queen of the Oases" and the
"Pearl of the Desert." Seen after two
days' journey through barren, treeless
wastes, with its waving palms and brilliant
verdure, it is :' a sight difficult to rival.
Biskra has several fine buildings, of which
the town hall, built in the oriental style,
with * gleaming V cupola and '.'. a - forest of
dainty pillars, is the gem. It cost Â£6000,
and is cheap at that. figure, but, of course,
labor here is had for a song. 'k k
. The Oued Biskra flows through the oasis
and causes much of its prosperity. The
chief industry is date-raising, and nearly
all the inhabitants own a little plat of
ground devoted to this purpose, and gen
erally their only source of revenue. Biskra
owes much to the Corapagnie de l'Oued el
R'irh, who bored artesian wells and laid
out vast date plantations. They also
erected a fine casino and constructed a
tramway to the celebrated Ham mam Sala
hine, about six miles distant springs well
known to the Romans, whence Biskra was
called Ad Piscinam. In consideration ,â  of
all these benefits the company was granted

SOCIETY
SOCIETY decrees a strict observ
ance of Lent as the proper thing,
and the disastrous result is a
dearth of social gayeties of all
kinds. With the exception of a
few quiet little dinners and luncheons
given in stealth and referred to in whis
pers, society is resting and planning be
wildering gowns for the summer campaign
and Easter entertainments.
Prominent among the entertainments
announced for Easter week is tbe private
theatrical and ball to be given by Mr.-.
Hager. Active rehearsals of the play-,
the name and character of which, save to
the initiated, are a profound secretâ have
begun, and tbe actors at this early day are
already letter perfect. The date of the en
tertainment has not yet been decided
*npon, neither the hall where it will be
held, offing to the limited accommodations
of Mrs. Hager's home.
Two years ago Mrs. Hager gave an elab
orate ball for her daughter at Armory. Hall
that is referred to as one of the most mag
nificent affairs in the annals of San Fran
cisco society. This most clever and ac
complished of hostesses at that time aptly
demonstrated that it was possible to lend
the subtle charm of "home" to a private
entertainment at a public halL.
While every one is busily discussing
summer plans, strange to say but few hav.e
decided where they will pass the season.
There is every indication that Ross Valley
is going to be extremely gay during the
early summer. Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Mc-
Cutcheon leave for their country place at
Koss next week.
Mr. and Mrs. William Thomas have
taken one of Mrs. Barber's cottages. Mr.
and Mrs. Henry BotHen the *Dibblee house
and Mr. and Mrs. R. J. Davis the Bosqui
cottage.
Mrs. Kittle and Miss Lucia Kittle, who j
have been spending the past two years i
abroad, are expected to pass the summer j
at their place in Ross Valley.
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Schmieden (form
erly Miss Alice McCutcheon), after a tour
through Japan and China are in the land
of the pyramids, and at last accounts were
going up the Nile.
The travelers have been collecting many
valuable curios, and by the time they
complete their contemplated tour of the
world will doubtless possess many, rare
bits of art. Mr. and Mrs. Schmieden are
taking things leisurely and will probably
not return before next fall, and possibly
later. . - '.X"
Mr. and Mrs. E. J. McCutcheon leave
for Europe in June, with the expectation
of meeting Mr. and Mrs. Schmieden m
Paris.
Miss Collier has been entertaining a
jolly little party during the past week at
her home at Clear Lake. The Misses
Juliet and Hannah Williams, Miss Mary
Eyre and Walter Hobart went up last
Saturday and ' expect to be Miss Collier's
guests for some ten days or more.
Mrs. Will Tevis left yesterday for her
home in Bakersfield. Mrs. Tevis, for the
past month, has been a guest at the Palace
Hotel and has been devoting all her time
to purchasing furniture and hangings for
her handsome home, now in course of
completion at Bakersfield. The exterior
architecture of this elegant new home is
in the picturesque adobe style, while the
interior boasts of all the improvements
that this end of the century commands.
Mrs. Tevis will have a large number of
house parties during the summer months.
Mrs. Delmas and the Misses Dalmas are
still in Paris, where the young ladies are
devoting themselves to the study of music
and the languages. Although they have
not accepted many of the social cour
tesies extended to them, they, are de
voting much of "their spare time to sight
seeing, the opera and the theater. The
date of their return is indefinite.
Mrs. Julius Kruttschnitt and family wiil
spend their first summer in California at
Lake Tahoe.
W. Frank Goad is anxiously waiting to
dispose of his elegant home on Washing
ton street, and then, with his daughters,
the Misses Aileen and Genevieve Goad,
will make a two years' tour of Europe.
The past has been a busy week in Jew
ish circles. The engaged girls have been
dined and wined extensively and the early
departure of several popular young ladies
has been the occasion of many luncheons,
teas, dinners and theater parties in â¢ their
honor.
On Thursday Mrs. S. W. Ehrman gave a
delightful tea in honor of Miss Carrie Sachs
and Miss Jennie Schwabacher. The hours
were from 4 till 6, and about forty young
ladies were entertained. . . ,
On Friday evening Miss Helen Sutro
gave an elaborate reception in honor of
Mrs. Bchwabacher.
Mrs. Dinkelspiel gave an elegant dinner
on Friday evening, complimentary to Miss
Ruby Lowenberg and A. Brown, and Miss
Leah Gerst and Mr. Lowengart. Violets
and La France roses made an exquisite
table decoration. Covers were laid' for
eighteen.
On Saturday last Miss Irma Triest gave
a luncheon at her residence*- on Sutter
street. in honor of Miss Carrie Sachs.
The Verein Bal Poudre last evening was
one of the most delightful affairs of the
season. It was . a triumph for woman's
ingenuity and skill, the ladies having en
tire management of the affair.
They received the guests, arranged the
programme, attended to the decorations,
music, , etc. ' Between the dances there
were living pictures, prominent among
which were the "Rose Callend," Gibson's
"Leap Year" and that lovely novelty mini
ature, in which. only the. handsome head
of the subject is seen, framed handsomely.
There were also fancy dances and a
silhouette pantomime illustrating .the
various advancements of the "new
woman."
The costumes of the ladies were all elab
orate and elegant "and all. appeared to ex
cellent advantage in spite of the trying
powdered hair.
The ladies" to whom all credit is due for
the excellent success of the entertainment
are : y Mrs. M. Heller, Mrs. Alfred Greene-
baum, Mrs. Feuchtwanger, Mrs. S.-Rosen
baum,. Mrs. Marcus Gerstle, Mrs. S. Ebr
man, Mrs. A. Mack,. Mrs. Walter- Castle
and Mrs. M. Ehrman.
Previous to the ball Miss Sadie Hecht
gave a large dinner party after which
hostess ami guests proceeded to the ball.
A very delightful entertainment will be
given at the Hotel St. Nicholas next Tues
day evening, March 17, when Mr. John T.
Wenyon of London will give a dramatic
recital. He will be assisted by Miss Helen
Marshall Anderson, pianist, and Miss Flor
ence Wyinan, Edith Scott Waters and Mr.

TAME CATS TURNED WILD.
They Now Overrun Goat Island V and
Kill All Small Game.
y Naturalists , have never been able to
definitely settle the origin of the domestic
cat." â¢ By | many eminent men it has been
considered the descendant of a distinctive
gentle breed that had its origin in Egypt,
and ! they base their theories on the fact
that mummies of cats have been found in
the most ancient tombs. ' Other natural
ists, equally as learned, have held that it
was : the tamed progeny of some specifes of
the felts tribeâ likely the wildcat that
is so common in many parts of . this . coun
try. If a return to first "principles will
count for as much, in mammalology as it
does in geology the advocates of the latter
can prove their views by a visit to Goat
Island, as that place is overrun with wild
cats, the changed descendants of a few
common housecats. p
It has taken about twenty years to pro?
duce the wildcats of Goat Island, the de
generative process commencing soon after
the lighthouse was established â â¢ there .in
1875. It seems that the first keepers brought
a number of cats with them, but- with, un
restrained liberty the animals gradually
forsook the comforts of civilization. Goat
Island is the home of thousands of birds
and squirrel's, and to this, is '.possibly due
the temptation of the. cats to forsake the
keepers' fireside. , At first the cats would
absent themselves for days at a time, but
the kittens were born at home. In time,
however, they got over this and lived alto
gether in the underbrush. After a few

years, the descendants of the first cats were
so wild that they were afraid of human
beings and made their dens in the crevices
of the rocks.
-- From that time the cats became wilder
and wilder, until now they are as fero
cious as the terrible creature of Y the
mountains. \ They have increased in size
and changed -altogether in disposition.
They are always seen in pairs, and appear
to mate, as all species of the cat tribe
do, in the wild state. The cats live on
squirrels, quail and sparrows, as well as
such other small animals and birds as they
can catch. They are supplied with water
from a dozen springs in different parts of
the island.
In addition to other changes the wild
cats have become hostile to such, tame
cats as are brought to the island from
time to time. They will attack them en
sight, and never stop until they have killed
their victims. 'â 'â . â¢-.-..â¢â¢ : y7*ly
.. The chief destruction wrought by 'the
wild cats is on the quail that inhabit the
island. The '.'artful, drummers", used to
be there in abundance, but are now pretty
well thinned out. The cats are constantly
on the alert, and not only kill every quail
they can catch, but often destroy 'whole
nests full of young. To prevent "this the
lightkeepers are always on the lookout for
wild cats and; shoot every one that comes
anywhere near the house.,. As ; a conse
quence the cats keep some distance away
and the quail seem to know they are safe
in that locality, for there are more nests
there than in any other part of the island.
Many plans have been tried tfithin the
last few years to rid the : island ;of y the
hungry, carniverous pests, but the more
they are persecuted with shotgun, trap and
poison the more rapidly they seem to mul
tiply.
GREAT SPECIAL OFFER.
500 Sets the Encyclopaedic IMctionary
at Introductory Prices*
The Pacific Coast Newspaper Syndicate
has such unbounded faith in the merits of
the New Encyclopaedic Dictionary that it
has adopted an original, liberal and wholly
unique plan to introduce the work. ' f
The syndicate believes, and with much
reason, that 500 sets of the dictionaries
scattered through that many . cultured
homes will create widespread comment,
because of the easily apparent superiority
of the book when compared with others
that: have up to now been considered
standard.
- The New Encyclopaedic is in four large
quarto volumes of over 5000 pages, embel
lished with numerous i explanatory . illus
trations. It is based on the Encyclopaedic
Dictionary issued in England, which for
over seventeen years claimed the services
of a large corps of ; editors, literary work
ers and â â ': specialists, among whom were
such men as Professor Huxley, Professor
Proctor and others standing equally high
in their several departments of knowledge.
The labors of the American editors and
experts, of whom there were a large num
ber,' consisted in revisions and , additions
necessary to make ; the dictionary thor
oughly practical and useful for Americans,
not only thescholastic and literary,' but the
busily occupied man of affairs, who wants
to know quickly, concisely and accurately
about words, things and facts claiming his
notice from day to day.
...- In this regard the encyclopaedic features
are of paramount value," since one* is ena
bled to â 'â¢ practically.; dispense with many
other reference works, if the Encyclopaedic
Dictionary is at hand. 7 y â

BAB WOMEN WHO WORK
They Should First Make Care

. Vocation.
SUCCESS IS SURE TO FOLLOW,

Too Many Fail Because They Attempt
' to Do That for Which They
Are Unfitted. '
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â Even
the most learned of magazines thinks it
worth while to take ! up the question of
wages paid to women and whether they
really earn them or not. I do not know
why this ola question has been brought
up, because I fully believe that wherever
civilization exists the woman who.c work
is on a par with man's gets a man's salary.
But â you see that will corn el do not be
lieve that, under many circumstances,
women do more work for the same money
that men do, because it is the nature of a
woman to busy ; herself about that which
her hand findeth to do.' A business man
engages a woman typewriter; four days
after X her arrival she is â  not only
doing all the work - : involved under
the head -of stenography and type
writing, but ten to one-she -is keeping
the office in orderâ l don't mean sweeping
it, but making it neat-â running the letter
book, and doing the hundred and one
things that are required, but which a man
stenographer would scorn to do. I don't
know but that he is right.: He is hired as
stenographer and private secretary, not as
man of all work; but womenâ well, my
friend, women usually need the money so
badly when they work for it that they are
willing to give a helping hand wherever it
is needed,, and forget that by so doing they
lessen the value of their services.
Do you think am wrong? No, lam not.
The wise woman will do that which she is
hired to do, do it well, and, except in the
case of an emergency, let the work of oth
ers alone. I agree with the learned maga
zine in one respect: Women will never be,
physically,' fit to compete with men. Their
nerves are finer -strung; on a more sensi
tive chord, and, being women, they throw
heart and body into whatever they may
may be doing, with the result that, while
it is well done, the woman herself is worn
out and fitted only for rest. There have
been articles written on how women
should work, how they should live, how
they should eat, and how they should have
their being, until one would think that
the average woman was so drunk with ad
vice she found standing on her feet with
firmness somewhat difficult. Of course,
that women have to work outside the home
is a misfortune. But that they do is a fact.
They can starve, but it is not a pleasant
mode of death, and most of them have a
strange fancy for clinging, to life, poor as
it is, that is wonderful.
Mrs. Tom Brown, who last year was as
merry as a grig, did not think there was a
trouble in life and â¢ believed â¢ that Tom
Brown was the greatest man on earth, to
day faces a problem. 7 Tom Brown has
failed, and instead of being man enough
to go out and look for -.work of any kind,
no matter what it is, he sits at home and
moans and worries and blames his trouble
on everybody but his .own short-sighted
self. In the meantime, food, coal and
wood are needed. Poverty has, if anything,
increased the appetites of the children, and
Mrs. Tom Brown says to herself, being a'
loving woman, "Poor Tom, he can't help
it; but I'll try and get something to do."
Mistake number one. The chances are
that if Tom Brown had.,. seen his wife
and children hungry and -cold, and real
ized that they would starve or freeze unless
he worked for them, it might have made a
man of him, and he would have started
out and done something; or tried to. As
it is, he says: "I can't do anything; the
world is against me; if she wants to, let
Mary try." '.
And Mary does try. Poor, foolish Mary !
She has read of the immense' amount of
money made by Mrs. Humphry Ward, of
the great 'sums earned by Mrs. Burnett,
and she sits down and 'writes a story.
And while she is writing the story the
Brown family go in debt to the grocer and
the butcher and the milkman; and the
baker. And the story comes back to Mary,
and she concludes that the editor of that
magazine is a fool. And then it comes
back from another, and . lis concludes that
the editor of that magazine is .influenced
by other women not to take the work of
other women. Then that poor story comes
back J from another magazine, and then
Mary does what she ought to have done
in the first place puts the story in the fire
and warms the children by it. Do I under
rate Mary's ability? No. But the woman
who can write a good, original story is not
treated as Mary is,' and, in j addition, she
forgot that success of the pen comes to the
few, for, after all, my friend, the women
who make much â  money with their pens
are fewâ very few. _ '
What would I advise her to do? Put all
the children to bed and think awlile.
Think and think until she knows what she
can. do best. If her talent lies in the bak
ing of cakes and the making of bread and
the concoction of dainty dishes, and this is
a great talent, then, if- Mary t is wise, she
will go to those neighbors whose cooks are
poor, who have no knowledge of the great
art of cooking themselves, and she will let
them know that she will make Â for a
proper price whatever they Y may need in
this special line. The deviled eggs for
Sunday evening's tea; the light lady,
cake, that is a joy to the taste, a pleasure
to the eyes and hot an insult to the stom
ach; the meat salads that the men like, or
the dainty. puddings that the whole family
enjoy, Mary can make^to order. Now, if
Mary has a talent for cooking and man
ages properly,'; she can, in her own little
town, make"; an income that . ought â to
shame Tom, but which doesn't/though it
will keep tnat awful wolf, -Debt, from the
door.'.3Si^S^sa^iraÃÃÃ|^9S9fc)SÂ§SPÃ|_
' Possibly Mary's talent is with her needle.
She can take the finest cambric needles, a
very cobweb of thread and hemstitch 1 the
daintiest of linens. y Oh, no, she needa't
embroider center pieces or doylies or tea
clothes; the world is full of them. Instead
she can go to little Mrs. Matron -across the
way. 4 who is young and happy, and who is
hoping for; a greater happiness, and she
can offer to mate for her all the tiny little
dresses, the oretty petticoats, 1 the funny
little caps that are to be worn : by the most
wonderful baby in all the world. And do
ing this work and doing it well; will cause
Mary's reputation to spread, and it is pos
sible that she may have teach her oldest
girl to help her when the orders are many.
And Tom? Oh, well, Tom is a man, and
he will let Mary earn- the money while he
tells the men when a fellow is married
he ought to be master in his 'house. y And
Mary .will continue to love him. For such
is the nature of woman. y ? pYY â â 'â â  YY

her to beg an orange blossom for the bride.

ries. V Why should ' Mary, write poor stories
when she can ? grow good i flowers ? The
boys help her make a pit, and papered it,
so to say, with bundles of i straw, and cov
ered it with old glass," and Mary had hun
dreds of violets for Easter Sunday as her
offering, when \ her I neighbors ; had % none.',
It ;is; a ' curious 1 thing, but flowers i know
when ( j people- love them, and f grow j and
blossom under the hands that express ten
derness in touching them. Mary, may feel
like selling her soul when she takes money
for these i lovely, blossoms, but | she is not; ;
she is saving her soul by trying to be hon
est.y You think these things are not pos
sible? I have * not* told you of one case
that is not true, and in which a really and

; 1 sometimes think that it is the women
who have been most gently, bred who Care
most willing to do that honest work which'
their hands find; for tbem to do. V The
world and all of us in it have a fashion of
jeering jat V; boarding-houses, /and : yet, , I
know no more honest way and*, no 4 mere
womanly, way . for â a 7 woman - to ' earn her
living than by making a home: for those
who* have none.; Unfortunately, most
women do . not . look at this :in .* the * right
way. They start out with the determina
tion to make as touch money and give as
little consideration as possible, forgetting
that everything pat in the market is only
j worth the I market price. Consequently,
she who offers to her boarders an untidy
table, a badly cooked' dinner, rooms not
properly cared for, and none of the polite
ness which a hotel keeper shows his guests,
need not expect to make enough mpney to
pay her landlord. Good cooking does not
cost any more than that which is bad, and
only a 7 little more / care 'is required 'to
achieve a dainty table than an untidy one.
Some time ago a young woman; came to
me who was eager to make her living. She
was alone in the world, except and always
when a woman"' needs *to earn her living
there comes that exceptâ for one old lady
who depended on her. She had a little
money and a few diamonds, and she
thought' she would succeed* on a" news
paper. I threw my .whole soul in my talk
to her. Generally, I do not indulge "in
that worst of vicesâ^advice. But in this
case I did, and the > result isâ success.
This young woman rented a small house
in the neighborhood of the big clubs; she
got a man friend in each club to permit
her to use his name on her cards, which
were business cards V and -; nothing'; else.
They stated that she would rent com
fortable rooms at a reasonable .price; that
she would serve a light breakfast, if de
sired, and that a valet would come every
morning to attend those gentlemen who
wished his services. The first month she
lost money, but her diamonds went into
pawn that her rent for the next month
might be paid in advance, and at' the end
of that time she had made enough money
to pay the rent, though the furniture and
the valet were still a loss. However, I
used to see her and cheer her up, and we
would have a lovely cry together. In four
months' time her house was full. â * Now
she is making money, the furniture is paid
for long ago, and she says she doesn't
believe any lodger will leave until he dies.
Because? Because she has given what
she promisedâ value- for value received.
Instead of one small towel, strongly sug
gestive of a dinner napkin, the towel racks
in the bedrooms are covered with great big
ones, such as men like, and there are dam
ask ones, and rough ones, and Turkish
ones. The rooms are kept immaculate.
The bathrooms, on each floor, do not have
in one. corner a collection of brooms and
dustpans, in another three or four trunks
piled up, while the hot water doesn't run
until 12 o'clock in the. morning, and no
water runs after 11 o'clock at night. The
tub itself does not require a thorough bath
before one enters it, but there is a com
fortable chair, foot baths, plenty of towels'
and a bathtub that shines so you can see
your face in it. The only request made is
posted in 'â â ' the bathrooms: "After using
bath gentlemen- are requested to ring the
bell, so that the room may immediately be
put in order.".. She pays the valet so much
a month; she charges the men who require
his services so much a week, and makes a
good percentage on this. Breakfast is
'served at a cost of 50 cents a morning. It
consists of a pot of the best coffee, boiling
hot, not tepid ; two French rolls, a pat of
fresh butter, a pitcher of boiling, not tepid,
milk, and all this is served on dainty
napery and in delicate china. .
There are no rules and regulations. If
Mr. Burgundy fancies coming in at 2 in
the morning and not getting up until 3
the next afternoon that is entirely bis busi
ness, and as my friend refused to receive
any but gentlemen who had references in
her house she docs not fear the scandals
that occasionally , arise in houses where
people are not known. : '-XX
Do I think keeping 1 a boarding-bouse is
easy V work ? k I do ; not. But I think if
women want to make money out of it they
had , better find out what their boarders
would like, and cater to the. people who
pay them. The average landlady seems to
regard her boarders as enemies, wretched
people from whom she must try to get the
most and give the last. ' My friend, this is
not the way to succeed in business, and if
women must go into business let them
show what fine creatures they are by mak
ing successes of whatever they undertake..
Miss Determination, who has taken her
degree as a lawyer, scoffs at the very fem
inine ways by which I think a woman can
earn her living. But I wonder how many
cases she has had that have been paid for.
I suppose a woman lawyer is all right, but
I prefer a man :to conduct any case in
which I might be interested.
. Miss Chatter scoffs at my quiet ways of
making money, for she is a doctor; some
how I wonder if there aren't times when,'
like all other women, she is capricious and
nervous and wishes she were dead, and I
conclude tbat I would rather have a man,
stupid though he may be, to attend me
when I am ill, to find fault with me- if 1
have not taken good care of myself," and to
make me conscious of the fact that I am
going to get well. It may be only igno
rance, but I don't like to think of Miss
Determination in court pleading for some
horrid wretch who is guilty and for whom
she is forced to lie. Honestly, I would
rather the men would do the dirty work.
That: sounds very mean,: but- it is true. . 1
don't like to think of little Miss Chatter,
who is going to marry your . sou or :j your
neighbor's son, coming into a sickroom
With a business-like air, feeling your pulse
and making a doubtful statement. V Oh, I
am glad if she can be a nurse; I am glad
if her fingers, so cool and soft, can touch
the hot forehead and make it seem better,

women doctors and women preachers.

THE RAREST OF STAMPS
Recently Brought to Light by an
Enterprising Collector of N
Louisville.
Its Value â¢ Authoritatively Placed at
$5000â The Only Specimen
Known.
. What is authoritatively declared to be
the rarest stamp in existence has just been
brought to light in â¢; Louisville, Ky., by a
collector. It is the only known copy of
the 10-cent Baltimore postmaster's stamp."
printed on white paper, / and its value
is placed at $5000, or just .ââ¢ twice what
any other stamp has ever before been â  sold
for. The stamp is at '*. present owned .by
the C. H. Mekeel Stamp and Publishing
Company of St. Louis.which firm pur
chased it from the gentleman. who was its
fortunate finder, a young : man named
Duncan. The latter's story of _ the great
and valuable discovery is as follows: \: -p
He bad secured the permission of a
Louisville lawyer, a friend of his, to look
over his papers, and on Saturday, Febru-
Rarest of Stampsâ Value $5000.
ary 29, he reminded the attorney of the
promise, and offered him one-half of the '
value of the stamps he might find as com
pensation . for the inconvenience that
might be caused the friend by the work of
rummaging among his old correspond-:
ence.
â¢ Permission was granted by the attorney,
however, without any conditions, and with
the assurance that he did not care for re
muneration and that the searcher was wel-'
come to everything that he might rind in
the way of rare stamps. He further ex
pressed the opinion that he very much
doubted whether anything of value would
be found, as the papers had been over
hauled by many others. But this did not
discourage young Duncan, who immedi
ately set to wort to make a systematic
search. ...
-It took all of Saturday afternoon and
several hours Sunday morning to complete
the work of going through everything, and
the result of the find was as follows: 1
Baltimore postmaster's stamp (10 cent), on
original cover; 5 New York 5-cent stamps;
150 United States 5-cent stamps of 1847;
110 United States 10-cent stamps of 1847.
â¢These stamps, exclusive of the Balti
more, are worth in the neighborhood of
$200; so that even if Duncan had not un
earthed the great rarity his labors would
still have been well rewarded. ' . . â â 
The firm which purchased this philatelic
gem from the finder has this to say in one
of its publications regarding the matter:
"Record prices are always interesting to
read about. It is well known that our.
publishers received the highest price ever
paid for one stamp. They now hold the
record of paying the largest sum of money
for one stamp of any dealer in the world.
The day has passed when great rarities
cannot "find ready purchasers among the
trade.
"The largest known number of 20-cent
St. Louis stamps of any one type is eight.
Specimens on original cover are valued at
upward of $3000. Thus the value of a per
fect copy of the 10-cent Baltimore, white
paper, and the only one known to exist,
at a low estimate should be placed at
$5000."

LATEST FASHION GOSSIP FOR WOMEN AND MEN
THAT the Easter season will be a
gay one there can be no doubt, for
we know of more than one fashion
able wedding which is to be sol
emnized. Then there will be a
Presidio ball and a reception at the club
house on Sutter street, given by the Daugh
ters of the Revolution, and many more in
teresting and delightful affairs which are
destined to keep us more than busy. The
past week has been far from dull, and this
week the reception on California street
will be well attended, and so the time
flies. x .
It should be remembered that! visitors
need never hand their cards to the maid
who answers the bell, nor do they leave
them in the drawing-room, but in the en
trance hall instead.
Vanity tells of an interesting and novel
entertainment recently given in Balti
more. It was called "An Observation
Party" and is thus explained: "A large
number of articles were distributed on
tables in the rooir, into which the guests
were taken two by two, as the Noah family
and the animals went into the ark, and
were given exactly two minutes to observe
all they could. They were taken out then
and given paper and pencils to write down
the names of the things they could re
member and make guesses as to the total
number of tbe articles. The most success
ful guesses won' the prizes."
I have just been informed, on the best
authority, that real pearls, when dis
colored, should be worn night and day to
restore their color. I refer to pearls which
are unset, only strung, otherwise nothing
can be done.
It seems to have become an epidemic
East the desire to possess, by fair means or
foul, a crest. As a natural result I read
that our colleges of heraldry are as prolific
in fiction as the writers of the "penny
dreadfuls." The manufactured crests, ar
n;ori-.l bearing and mottos of aspiring
individuals are a source of the keenest
amusement to the initiated. It is surpris
ing the amount of old family silver in this
City, which is adorned with old historic
crests which proclaim its age, even if the
quaint shapes did not do so.

Princess had such exquisite linen. Evi
dently her mother, when giving the order
for it, felt that nothing could be too fine
or beautiful for her lovely child. The
wealth of beautiful lace employed is said
to be something fabuious. Every stitch
was done by hand and 100 dozen of each
article were prepared and finished in six
weeks. Many women must have blessed
the Countess of Flanders for so large an
order, but she has always ordered every
article of clothing for herself ana children
in their native city. The wedding dress
was of the richest white satin, the front
and folds being exquisitely embroidered
with silver wheat ears, and bordered with
pearls; tie cut of the skirt snows to great
advantage magnificent lace which was pre
sented to the Princess by the ladies of
Belgium, a narrower kind was used for
the bodice and fell gracefully over the
sleeves, where it was looped up with
shoulder-straps in orange blossom and
myrtle. The priceless veil was draped on
the train, for it is nearly five yards long,
being veil and tram in â¢ one, which pro
duced a delightful result. One of the
Princess' ball gowns is also spoken of as a
model of perfect taste. It is of brocade
pink satinâ the bodice encircled with
drapery of brocade and strings of brilliants
and pearls, large puff sleeves in pink satin
â with butterfly bows of "vert billeul,"
with loops of pearls. The skirt is trimmed
with panels lined with green satin and
hemmed with pearl and brilliant beading.
Tne train is of pink satin. The bride's
mother, the Countess, is described as hav
ing been charming in a toilet of the most
delicate shade of electric blue, the front
embroidered .in glace, and the whole
trimmed with delicate lace. The sister
also wore light blue, for, as I have several
times lately remarked, blue, especially
turquoise blue, is to be in great vogue.
For useful ordinary skirts shepherd's
plaids and checks oi all descriptions are
being made ud to wear with fancy waists
and black jackets, for in spite of all the re
marks made by the best authorities con
cerning odd waists they continue to flour
ish and dresses made with waists to
match are still the exception, although
for stout women the effect of the fancy
bodice is distinctly bad. The first model I
selected to present to you is of a white
chine silk, upon which mauve and green
flowers are scattered, and the sleeves of
this are close-fitting and small, made of
mauve chiffon, mauve chiffon again put
ting in its appearance to form the pleated
front of the bodice, while a full frill of
cream-colored lace falls over the shoulders.
Such a frock is admirable for the south
now, and later for any one of our fashion
able resorts, and the style is amply in ad
vance so that no one need fear that it will
not remain in style for the next six
months, as it has just been designed for
Monte Carlo. , ' , . â
Another made by the same house is wor
thy of imitation, being of a beautiful Qual
ity of white alpaca lined with pale blue
glace. The bodice. has â  an inner vest of
tucked white chiffon and is edged, with a
fichu bordered with tiny fn s of the alpaca
laid over equally tin y frills of the blue
glace, and round the waist is a broad belt
of black velvet. V V " p - , ,_ .. .
The next gown is charming also, for it is
of palest green glace silk trimmed with
ecru lace and chine silk, and the seated
figure is beautifully clad in ecru chine can
vas, lined with ' pink silk, triacmed with :
lace and pink ribbon.- *Y< â¢ â  , . i
TherÂ«can be no doubt that the silk of
the season will be peau de soie.'and the
newest brocades have this for a ground
work. Silks will be used for morning toil
ets quite as â  much - as V for evening wear,
hence the wonderful selection -of < silks
now on the market. Cameleon Luxor, in
such artistic mixtures as shades of eer
anium and gold, dark and light moss and
mordore, blue, green, white and lavender
and two tones of green, with blue and
peach. Orange *. and 7- magenta -'. will Vbe
very popular. The silk itself has a velvet
like surface, with the exquisite bloom of a
geranium flower, particularly noticeable
in such combinations as green and Parma
violets. â¢
The newest chines are remarkably lovely.
Many of them are thrown on shot taffetas
and shaded grounds, as ombre effects are
among the latest novelties Â» this year;
some of them have stripes that shade into
one another. One unusual chine effect is
on a shaded ground, which appears to be
covered with minute white network, and
the chines are thrown on pink shaded
stripes and on carmele stripes. The best
of the chine effects are printed on the
warp; it is only the less expensive class in
which the pattern is printed after the silk
is woven, but this is so cleverly done that
it exactly imitates the results obtained by
the superior methods. Chines are also to
be had in a watered pattern, and numer
ous are the Cashmerian figures. For maid
ens and youthful matrons these silks are
obtainable in colors and designs that recall
the Watteau period.
Brocades have not lost their hold on
popular favor; indeed they are . much
sought for, although the best are very
costly, having become more elaborate and
complicated than ever. In white they are
thrown on chine grounds, when the flower
petals overlap each other. Satin still takes
a front rank and will continue to be much
worn. t
Plain colors will be favorites for walking
costumes, for unceremonious occasions,
but there are a number of new fancy
woolens so beautiful in designs and shad
ings that they are sure to enjoy great
favor. The tbick sackcloth in blue and
the natural color will be much used for
tailor costumes, and as the buttons and
waistcoats are extremely chic they will be
considerably worn. Tbe material is thick,
although made of cotton or -linen thread,
and is well suited to the style of skirt and
bodice we expect will be in vogue. Also
to be noted among the spring materials
are the mohairs and alpacas, with woven
silk patterns in many shades. I hear also
of a kind of . now'flake upon a canvas
ground that is destined to be much liked,
as the flaice is always white, while the
ground may be had in any color. The
white flakes' on a gray surface is very de
sirable, but think inappropriate for sum
mer. ..'â¢"
--â Etamines of a totally new style are going
to be favorites. They are of a much coarser
texture than those worn last year and will
be used only by those who can afford a silk
lining, the weave being so transparent.
The novelty in these etamines consists in a
tiny colored, bead being dotted over the
material. - They are gold, silver, blue, red
and occasionally green in color.
A new make of woolen canvas is also to
be had with sil_ brocade of a well covering
renaissance pattern, and the silk grena
dines with satin stripes or chine patterns
give the promise of pretty gowns. Many
of the colorings are less vivid than they
were, and the combinations are wonderful
and the treatment original. One of the
newest tones of green is malachite, a' de
cided coloring, for indeed we are return
ing both in patterns and tones to the fash
ions of the early part of the century.
The revivals are vivid coquelicot, the rich
plum violet which of late we have called
eminence and glowing yellow greens. The
diagonal coating serges are sold in all the
new brieht colors, and fancy woolens of all
sorts and kinds are so excellent that a choice
is more than usually difficult.
I thoroughly recommend the grass
linens. Those with silk stripes are charm
ing, but yon will find the best quality
obtainable" in the plain fabric more eco
nomical, if money is a consideration, for
the smart New York girl has hers made
with insertions of gold lace and wears
a gold belt. This is a gown worthy of
our admiration, and very numerous
are the changes which can be made by
having an extra waist to which can be at
tached bright-hued ribbons, making an
apparently new frock every time they are
changed, but be sure to have one at least
with gold lace and insertions.
A queer, new garment has appeared and
been received with favor, it is between a
jacket and blouse, and is said to have "a
narrow ruffle effect over the hips, and the
fullness is belted in with a narrow gilt belt.
In front the fullness hangs down over the
belt." Brown and black are the two
favorite colors for this odd creation. The
gilt belt, will become ; common all too
quickly, and black ribbon will soon displace
it, as black is being used a great deal, giving
as it does, when artistically used, a certain
air and touch truly Frenchy. White will
be much seen, but will not become general,
as it is expensive, having to be constantly
either washed or cleaned.
If golf is generally taken up this summer
red coats and capes will be ordered, as they
have met with approval East, .being
picturesque and appropriate on the eolf
field. Golf capes are to be slightly wider
this season, otherwise the cut remains the
same, and they are now in demand ; for
country wear, as when driving no more
useful earment can be had. Double-faced
cloth is always used, and dark colors are
preferable.
It is safe to predict that our skirts will
be less voluminous this spring, but will be
quite as graceful. The godet proper . will '
vanish and the fullness placed m pleats or
. gang ngs at the back; the sides will be
flatter. The jackets will all repeat" the
Louis XV and the Louis XVI form of the
winter, and the waistcoats will be prettier
than ever. A walking costume is all that
can he desired when made : over silk of a
good quality with a jaunty short coat and
a dear little" waistcoat, perfectly. fitted, just
a trifle longer than the veste. In a short
time we shall most probably be wearing a
sleeve of moderate width from shoulder to
wrist, : a sleeve which â  has ; narrow revers
over the top of the arm. or â  a puffimg or a
pleating of silk or lace something . like
the /epaulet once worn, and the au
tumn will probably y bring the severe
coat sleeve, and that will mean the Wal-;
teau style , of - gown, and , '.; indeed, if ' the
fichu continues "to flourish their, effect
should be completed by paniers, as they
are their indispensable adjuncts, and by
those who remember their charms, and
certainly the fichu is one of the most be
coming" articles ; of ) attire ; ever invented,;
but tit: must 'be arranged with much care
and real art to suit the ( individual figure.
Some require it to be fixed so as to' form a
V, others a square, or a round, as the case
m'av be. Most of the light gowns are to
have a ficl.u, and very charming they, are

A 'CHINE SILK DRESS.
velvet ribbon, and tbis reminds me that
in Paris black velvet ribbon upon lace is
quite the rage, and black- velvet trimming
will adorn almost all of our summer gowns,
and will beautify the most fashion
able fichus and in combination with
frills of lace and lace insertions will form
the new sleeve. A correspondent says:
"The top portion of the new sleeve may be
frilled in this fashion, while the lower por
tion, which is .to commence about six
inches above the elbow, a point not to be
forgotten, can be formed of the lace
wrinkled tightly around the arm. On a
rounded arm the transparent lace sleeve
wrinkled is quite charminc. The woman
who is, however, unfortunate in the pos
session of a flat arm should abjure its
attractions. As a waistcoat for the open
coat, which is certain to be as popular as
ever it was. the white lace frills and the
black velvet trimming will be most effec
tive. Another piece of fashionable intelli
gence that I have gleaned is that braid is
to be once more in favor. A plain skirt
looks exceedingly well trimmed with gra
duated lines of braid up to the knees, ana
this may be completed with one of the new
short boleros, which escape the waist by
three inches, and hang loose and straight
at the back and front."
Stout women should rejoice that the
latest skirt being moderate in dimensions
has a tendency to increase their height
and slenderness by having less fullness at
the sides, the tube-like folds are gone.
All the new flat trimmings are on black,
white or colored nets; thus a delightful
effect is gained.
Mohair is said to make stylish and de
lightfully inexpensive: dresses. A good
model has a severely simple skirt, well
hung, made walking length, y The bodice
should be round with a flat plait in tbe
back ; the fronts are to have about seven
small tucks on each side, as a setting for
a broad chine ribbon with melange of
orange, browns and blues sifted together
and gliding into a balf-distinct figure;
which the newest chine ribbons have a
way of doing. This forms a pretty blouse,
the girdle being a , narrow : fold of chine
ribbon completed by a frisky little bow at
the left side. -p.-'" k-'I Y:
Now that many are going to play ; golf
and ride the wheel, a dress that will
answer for both may have the skirt cut on
the ordinary principle, should not
measure over three yards (but two and a
half yards are sufficient) round ; the . hem,
and fasten at one side. The usual covert
coat, with medium sleeves and no fullness
in the basque, has^een found satisfactory.
An excellent material lor this purpose is a
Venetian cloth of a cedar tone. A Tarn
o' Shanter of the ; same material, with
three or five black ' quills at one side, is
suitable. With ; this can be r . worn, - for
golfing,' a scarlet waistcoat fastened with
small gold buttons, which is cut so as to
show a white shirt and pretty,; tie. When
cycling a Tattersall "vest is good form. Y:p<,

turning back to the waist on a straight

.; -The warm weather again inclines . us ,to
consider seriously light, V pretty fabrics.
Chiffon, although an expensive luxury, is
to be more generally used than formerly.
A waist of waved chiffon, accordion
pleated, having a squaro yoke of cream,
colored lace insertion, with' satin rosettes,
is charming in any light shade. A blouse
of shot < silk, with ; a * box pleat ,'down r . the
back, ? a ] frilled :' front ' and .; a s deep { square
collar ot i cream-colored ; muslin and > lace
cut into tabs and trimmed with , many

ornamental .affair, p A slender debutante
would be especially' fetching in a bodice of
white chiffon made full between rows of
gauging?,' and ruchings of the chiffon
should edge the decolletage and a bow of
black velvet on the left shoulder gives a
chic touch. 77 Yy- y': '.""-. p -â 
1 have just read about another sof thin
light gray and white striped glace, which
is lined with pale blue silk. It has a yoke
of white chiffon, which is tucked and
edged with frills, and they are bordered
with yellow lace put on with the narrow
est of black velvet ribbon. These frills
cover the sleeves, which are correct, being
tight, with just the puff at the elbow, the
undersleeves from wrist to elbow being of
the white chiffon tucked with the combi
nation of lace and black velvet ribbon.
For an elderly gentlewoman an excellent
traveling mantle is princess-shaped, tight
at the waist, the back forming puckered
pleats below the waist. Heart-shaped
shoulder slope with velvet facings joined
to a round turned -down collar, the whole
edged with a stitched slope; sleeves open
and turned down, mounted in hollow
pleats, the open part' of the front is
trimmed with velvet facings edged by a
stitched slope. This sleeve discloses that
of the dress and is lined with striped silk.

FOE MEN.
Men are pleased at the return of the
shepherd's plaid, as it suits most of them.
Englishmen have always liked it, and
trousers of it are effective.
One reason Americans should be cautious
about wearing plaids is because they are,
as a nation, comparatively slight, at least
Vogue's authority thinks so.
The ; long walking-coats of rough mate
rial, which are so generally worn, are not
at all suitable excepting for very tall men.
V As the season advances y there "is a
tendency shown to order grays in small
checks. ;';'. ;: "
; I expected to V shudder oyer the vivid
pink shirts ; which are to be fashionable,
but am quite an '* admirer of some to be
had at one of our haberdashers; "but those
of bright green or ; sulphurous f hues will
never excite; my enthusiasm. However,
fads are the order of the day and to be
a faddist is quite interesting, but safety only
lies in conservatism. As y yet the latest
styles have not arrived; even in New York,
so we must possess our souls with patience
and give no unnecessary; orders until the
styles are more settled. #

drawing-room or remain with it on with
out until asked to do so. . The answer is
good;" so I give.it for the'Benent of many
readers.
What one should do depends upon cir
cumstances. There are man}* kinds of visits
that a \ man can make at a private house.
He j could call in the morning, that is to
say, before noon, which is the usual hour
that women of affairs discuss; their affairs
and ; have their business transactions, in
which case he goes strictly on business,
and is | not 1 supposed to be calling. : He
would then leave ; with the servant his
outer coat, for example, a heavy storm
coat, or overshoes, but he would enter the
drawing-room, or whatever room is
used as a reception-room, as if he came on
business, and not as if he were making a
personal call. He would therefore take
into the room his hat, his stick and his
gloves, and if he is wearing a light top
coat he would keep that, but if he is wear
ing a heavy storm coat and is wet. or his
overshoes are wet, or there is anything in
his dress that, if carried into the reception
room, would look as if he were bringing
the weather in with ( him, he would leave
them with the servant. This , covers the
question of business calls.
If he is making a formall call as one of
the friends of the Household, whether he
removes his top coat or not or whether he
carries his hat and stick and gloves with
him or not depends upon whether he is ex
pected or not.
If he has been invited or comes by ap
pointment for a purely social visit, ; and is
quite intimate with the people, he would
leave his hat and stick and gloves with the
servant.
If he is making a call and is not ex
pected he would take his hat, gloves and
stick with him. 7^ y " ;
The safe side is always the conservative
side and a man is always less likely to
make an error of good form if he takes his
hat, gloves and stick with him.
Foreigners are much more accustomed
to taking their hat/gloves and stick into a
drawing-room when making calls than are
Americans. V -

authorization of the work is shown - by the
certificate of the Rev. Dr. Samuel Hart,
custodian of the Standard Book of ' Com

': Original illustrations form the most
striking feature of the volume. These in
clude pictures suitable to the festivals of
Christmas,*; Easter, Ascension, Whit Sun
day and Trinity. The first Sunday in Ad
vent is faced by a representation of Moses
lifting up the serpent in the wilderness, as
the Old Testament type of the crucifixion,
and the series closes with a plate facing
the prayer of consecration, representing
the crucifixion. These pictures are the
work of Robert Arming Bell of Liverpool,
a designer in the front rank of English
artists.: All of the seven plates in the book
are surrounded by decorated borders in
black and - white, which are the work of
Bertram â¢ Grosvenor Goodhue, and the
pages opposite each plate have borders
surrounding the gospel for the festival of
the same elaborate character. All the
fourteen borders differ, and every collect,
epistle and gospel | begins with an initial
letter designed by Mr. Goodhue. Upon
the large letters for each collect there is a
shield or scroll, bearing, from the first
Sunday in Advent to Trinity Sunday,
symbols of the seasons or saints to which
the collect is proper, and for the Sundays
after Trinity the names of the cardinal
virtues, the gifts of the spirit, etc., in
Latin. * ' y
. In the border for Christmas day bats and
moles are int6rwoven in foliage, signifying
the darkness of the old dispensation, while
owls hold, in their talons scrolls bearing
the . names of the patriarchs, the major
prophets, etc. The Easter border contains
peacocks, , the ancient emblem of the res
urrection, holding in their place scrolls
bearing the names of the four evangelists,
the doctors of the church especially asso
ciated with the prayerbook, and the three
Marys, as typical of the light of the new
dispensation and the triumph of the
church over the synagogue. : Sir John

! ME. HUNTINGTON'S SLANDER.
In its issue of last Friday morning and
among its Washington dispatches .. con
taining the testimony of C. P. Huntington
before the House Committee on j; Pacific
Railroad The Call published the state
ment that during his examination before
that committee Mr. Huntington "went
on to explain that when he became presi
dent of the Southern Pacific the Examiner
was on the : payroll of the company for
$1000 a month, and ' when he . ordered this
payment stopped the paper immediately
began to attacK him." ,
In so much of the dispatch as attributed .
this statement to â¢ Mr. Huntington while
testifying upon, the witness-stand and
under oath before the House committee
The Call was in error. After a full in-
vestigation ".." of the circumstances under
which Mr. Huntington uttered the above
slander against our contemporary the
facts have been found to be these: |
At the conclusion of Mr. Huntington's
testimony, when he had left the witness
stand and immediately after the commit
tee had adjourned, but before its members
dispersed, jj Mr. Huntington " made '[ the
above statement in the presence of | several
members of the committee and of others
who were there. . It j has ''â  also ' been ascer
tained, with reasonable certainty, that an
effort was made by certain of Mr. Hunting
ton's adherents to draw from him the
same or a similar assertion in the course
of his examination "under oath before the
committee. In this respect, however, Mr.
Huntington was wiser than his advisers,
and with characteristic cunning avoided
uttering this slander under conditions,
which . might have subjected him to the
pains and penalties of psrjuiy, while with
equally characteristic unfairness he poured
its venom into the ears of the committee
a? soon as he could safely do so after leav
ing the witness-stand. |t_"^_-
There is in this episode so much that is
characteristic of the method which Mr.
Huntington has long employed to vilify
the opponents of his cherished plans with
the vilest of slanders and the most absurd
innuendos that it hardly required an inves
tigation to bring conviction that the fact
of his uttering this slander was true, and
that he did so in fact and in the hearing of
at least some of the members of the com
mittee our careful inquiry fully confirms.
What course our contemporary should
pursue in the premises it would not be be
coming for us to indicate, but that the
members of the House committee who
heard from the lips of Mr. Huntington
this slander when off the witness-stand
should compel him either to repeat or're
tract it under oath and in the presence of
the full committee there cannot be the
slightest doubt.
A PEOPLE'S VICTORY.
The entire State of California may con
gratulate itself on the last ruling made by
tbe Supreme Court with reference to the
franchise of the Valley road through the
city of Fresno. When the directors of the
road applied for the franchise the City
Trustees of Fresno, though anxious to
grant tbe privilege, feared to run the risk
of violating the act requiring that all fran
chises for railroads in cities should be sold
to the highest bidder, and hence an agreed
case was submitted to the Supreme Court.
It came in the shape of an application
from the Valley road for a writ of mandate
compelling Fresno to grant the franchise
without competition. Upon an imperfect
understanding the court denied the writ,
and the entire San Joaquin Valley, which
had based so strong ; hopes on the relief
which the new road would afford, was
thrown into consternation. Tho railroad
company petitioned for a rehearing. This
was granted, the case was fully presented,
and yesterday the Supreme Court made an
order directing the -City Trustees of Fresno
to act upon the company's application for
a franchise without reference to any bids
for the privilege soueht, and to grantor
deny the application on its merits, as the
Trustees may . decide. This means that
the Trustees will grant the franchise, and
that the progress of the road through the
valley will be unhindered. The ruling of
course applies to all other cities and towns
through which the road is to pass.
The ruling is eminently just, though in
making it the court was compelled to ex
ercise a large discretion not expressly per
mitted by the bungling construction of
the statute. It is a notorious fact that the
act was intended solely to prevent the cor
ruption of municipal bodies by unscru
pulous street-railway companies, and that
there had arisen abundant reasons for
erecting this 7 safeguard. The law was
never intended to require that the fran
chise for a through railroad covering a con
siderable distance and passing through nu
merous towns should be included, unless,
perhaps, there was competition for a fran
chise over the same route by two competi
tive companies. Neither of those condi
tions existed in the present case. For that
matter, considering the number of streets
and possible routes which even competi
tive railroads might secure through any
city, it is hard to imagine that even the
second of these conditions could be forced
into a construction of the statute.
It is now, clear sailing for C the Valley
road, and Fresno might appropriately cele
brate this Wise and just decision as the
most important ever rendered to affect its
prosperity. V The . road will arrive in time
to move a large part of its valuable crops
of this year, and that will mean a great
saving in the cost of transportation, reason
able profits on the valuable products of the
county and a large accession to the money
value of productive lands.
/ USEFUL (EXPOSITIONS.
While it would be utterly profitless now
to attempt an estimate of the possible
benefits received by California from the
Midwinter- Fair and compare them with
the cost to our people, the question still
remains, Have we acquired the art 'of
mating the wisest expenditure of money
for making known the resources and at
tractions of San Francisco and the State?
This question is brought to view by a re
markable movement in France against the
World's Exposition y projected for 1900.
This has taken the form of an organiza
tion in Lorraine, calling itself the .League
of Decentralization, and it is propagating
voluminous pamphlets against the project
and stirring up a strong sentiment through
out the republic.
France held her first exposition in 1855.
Prince ; Jerome" Napoleon bitterly opposed
it, advancing some able arguments against
the idea of universal shows, in his ad
ministrative report he declared them to be
inextricable, of arbitrary classification and
valueless as to instruction. 'At the same
time he commended the idea of partial,
technical, special expositions given fre
quently and restricted to a judicious choice
among such products as most attract cur
rent attention, and a study of them by
critical ; and competent visitors. In 1867
M. kLe ! Pay â¢ reopened the attack on 'the
same grounds and : - urged the substitution
of permanent for universal expositions at
determinate points on French soil, 1 away
from the vast centers of population â com-
mercial ? and - industrial museums, as be
termed * themâsuch as since 'have been es
tablished in England; in Germany, those
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 1896.
countries having ; abandoned the idea of
universal expositions as responding to no
need of modern times.
"As much of the most intelligent edu
cation of the world concerning the attrac
tions of 'â¢ California must be conducted on
exposition lines,'; the movement in France
has a special significance for the people; of
this State. The manager of the California
State Board of V Trade has made encour
aging reports ' of â  the good . work accom
plished by the California exhibit at the At
lanta Exposition, but there happens to be
no way of ; securing proof ' that he is right.
Much practical demonstration was given
in connection with our \ exhibit there, and
hence it is possible that through the whirl
and confusion of a world's fair, a thought
ful person here and ' there was able so to
concentrate his attention on the California
exhibit as to receive an intelligent concep-
tion of its meaning. But we venture )to
say that with a permanent exhibit of Cali
fornia's products in a number of Eastern
cities, and with the traveling exhibit which
Santa Clara County is sending through the
country, we can accomplish more than, all
exhibits made in the swirl and fury of a
universal exposition. Similarly, the superb
exhibit of the State Board of Trade in this
City, by the employment of diligent means
for informing visiting strangers of its
existence, might ;be * made a most useful
engine for advertising the State.
TWO ERAS., COMPARED.
There never has occurred a single thing
to depress' the prosperity of California,
except greed or lack 'of intelligence. In
the old days of Spanish occupation the
people enjoyed a prosperity unequaled in
the history of the whole country. The
peace, content and honesty which accom
panied it have never since been approached
in California. The facilities which then
existed for extracting wealth and happi
ness from the soil and sunshine were piti
fully meager in comparison with those
now in our possession. The splendid
wealth of the gold mines had not then
been opened; the mellow wines grown
from the choicest vines since imported
from Europe and yielding so handsome a
revenue were unknown; irrigation had not
been employed to multiply the fecundity
of the soil; no railroads existed tÂ© hurry
to eager millions the gorgeous fruits which
the people since have learned to cultivate.
The only ships that visited thes. shores in
the old days were those which came to
bear away the hides for which cattle were
raised and slaughtered.
Yet in spite of all these disadvantages,
in spite of all this ignorance, the Spaniards
amassed fortunes. The inferior members
ol their society drew water and hewed
wood in perfect content. Their farming
was exceedingly primitive and confined to
their own necessities. There was no hur
rying, no scrambling, no theft and hardly
any crime. In those days California was a
real Arcady, a perfect picture of pastoral
content.
Since that time our opportunities for en
joying the blessings of the early; settlers
have been multiplied prodigiously. We
have discovered sources of wealth of which
they never dreamed. We have had the
opportunity to bring to bear on the re
sources which they so imperfectly under
stood all the force of modern intelligence
and progress/and still, with all these su
perior advantages, we do not enjoy, the
prosperity that was theirs. The reasons
why we have fallen short of their standard
are exceedingly complex, but it would be
a shameful confession of weakness to ad
mit that we should not prosper immeasur-
ably beyond our predecessors. Whatever
may be v the pressure of extraneous â  in
fluences, they can never affect the intrinsic
value of the natural conditions which en
viron us. These natural . resources are
opened far wider to us than they were to
our Spanish predecessors, and a con
fession that we are unable to make them
that much more available for our pros
perity and happiness is a proclamation
that we do not deserve the blessings which
are so freely offered.
Civilization is a failure if it does not en
able us to improve on primitive condi
tions. As a matter of fact, everything
that hampers our prosperity is purely
artificialâ of human invention â the out
growth of greed and incompetency, and
can and should be made amenable to the
curative effects of ordinary intelligence.
NEWSPAPER ACCURACY.
It is the aim and object of every honest
and self-respecting newspaper to be as
nearly accurate .' as possible in the pre
sentation of news to its readers, and : to
give them, as nearly as may be, a correct
summary of the world's state of affairs
day by day. The limitation of compara
tive exactness will understood and ap
preciated, it is to be hoped, for literal ac
curacy and exactitude is, in a newspaper
office, only an iridescent dream. The ob
stacles in the way of perfection are too
great to be overcome, so every newspaper
must be content with the nearest possible
approach to certainty.
Every day ' somebody, " and 7 often the
somebody who ought to know better, says:
"You can't believe anything the news
papers say." The assertion involves . a
double fallacy, the- first branch of which is
that the statemen t is wholly unsupported
by evidence, - and '. the second is that the
speaker himself, if he will but stop and
think a moment, will be convinced of the
folly of his utterance. He speaks, as most
of us do, without thinking. .
It is quite true that mistakes are made,
especially in the spelling of names of per
sons and places, and often in dates as well,
and that there is /always somebody read}*
to pounce on an inaccuracy in details, and
to insist that Smith should' be spelled
Smyth, or that some baby Prince or
Princess died in July instead of August;
but what -of y it? If such hypercritical
critics only knew the difficulties which en
compass telegraphic transmission, . the
rush and scurry of the telegraph editor
and the never-ending struggle of ' the
proof - reader, he would wonder, hot
that Smyth; should be spelled Smith, but
why it should hot appear in print as Brown
Or Jones, and why the capital of Herze
govina should not be located in Madagas
car or Patagonia.
To this should be added^the all-import
ant fact, with .which newspaper men are
only too familiar, that in attempting to
secure an exact account of 'some particular
incident / the j reporter ; is , confronted 1 with,
maybe, half a dozen stories, each of which
is told in perfect honesty and V sincerity,
but all differing in detail; depending upon
the point of view of the narrator. V Out of
this confusion order must be evolved, and
the best result that can â â¢ be hoped for. is a â 
consecutive narrative, for the exigencies of
the daily press do -hot permit >a ; lapse of
twenty-four hours in which to verify de
tails.- Â£Â ;' 'Â*'," ' *
Of course - the fact is that people do be
lieve what the newspapers say, though at
times ": they may detect ' some r ; inaccuracy
which is within their personal knowledge,
and, r more y than ;;; this, y they derive % the
greater part of their knowledge of current
events from the newspapers. As to the
policy of a newspaoer, as to its comments
upon the affairs of the day; as to its views
on politics^ ethics, government,^ or what
not, every reader is at perfect liberty to

agree or disagree with | the paper, as he
may be minded, but it does not lie in the
mouth of any intelligent man , to charge a
newspaper with deliberate distortion or
suppression of \ tacts, for there is no possi
ble ground '* for such ah accusation. -The
daily newspaper is one of the greatest and
most potent educational factors of the age,
and it ill becomes ; the man who' receives

case, may be shadowy and incomplete.
THE ARMED SAVAGE.
The terrible defeat of a splendidly drilled
and armed European army by a horde of
North African savages was one of the most
remarkable and significant events in his
tory, It is true that the Abyssinian army
was four times as large as the Italian, and
I that it fought the great battle on its : own
i ground, but it is true also that the elabor
ate and scientific care taken by the Italians
to surprise the blacks was an utter failure,
and that the savages fought with an intel
ligence that gave the highest efficiency to
their courage. The battle : went ; against
civilization because savagery was armed
with modern weapons and had mastered
the science of modern fighting. Had China
been armed as efficiently as Japan the ; re
sult of their war might have been very dif
ferent. ! ; ':.
The "spread of civilization" has placed
modern weapons of war in the hands of all
who will accept them. The lower races
have a fighting instinct with which the
patriotic sentiment; of I highly developed
races cannot be compared, and when this
is re-enforced by machinery for defending
the home against invasion and destruction,
it is formidable in the extreme. Armies of
defense against the rapacity of â¢ an invader
have a' strong moral advantage; among
civilized nations it is patriotism, with sav
ages it is the defense of the lair; and the
lowest animal will fight desperately for
that. ' '- â "' ! . 1" <.. :â¢-
The situation in Cuba is ' somewhat
j analogous. A large number of the insur
; gents are the native blacks, who had their
| origin in Africa. The beautiful island is
â  theirs, and they are j , fighting for its
j freedom with a spirit deeper, fiercer and
I closer to' nature's heart than patriotism.
The one circumstance against them, the
one thing that prevents the immediate
triumph of their ; cause, is their lack of

by no fine sentiment of valor, for when it

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
CHEAPER FARES WANTED-
Some Reasons Why the existing rates to San
Rafael Shovld Be Reouceo.
..' To the Editor of the Sain Francisco' Callâ Sir:
An enthusiastic and unanimously harmonious
meeting was held in San Rafael last Tuesday
evening to discuss the best methods to con
vince the management of the two railroads
running into this beautiful town that it is of
vital importance, as much to the railroad itself
! as to Marin County, that the fares between
here and ; San 7 Francisco ' should ', remain no
longer nearly 300 per cent higher than the ex
isting rates between San" Francisco and cities
in Alameda County. y The > people ;of San j
Rafael are alive :to â¢ the fact that their town,'
with all ; Its natural beauties and Its unap
proachable virtues as a summer, winter and
health resort, unequaled' by any other place
within a radius of 100 miles from San Fran
cisco, has been discriminated against and is
still handicapped and being injured by the un
wise policy of the two local railroads. â ;
The injustice of -their course was fully
demonstrated by the unanimous indorsement
by the thousands who attended Of the resolu
tions asking that the rates be lowered to such
a figure as to allow Marin County to compete
for a portion of the traffic that is now being
directed toward the eastern side of the bay. p
I The I rates that were suggested as being rea
sonable,â >. and which compare ; favorably with
those enjoyed by other communities, were:
Monthly commutation tickets, ground trip,
25 cents; single trip, 15 cents. .The present
rates changed by both roads are: Monthly tick
ets, $5; round trip, 50 cents; single trip,
cents-. When it is considered that .ban. Rafael
is but 15 miles or 50 minutes' ride from San
Francisco, and : Berkeley, Alameda aDd Fruit
vale are 11 mi'es or 50 minutes' ride, with the
fare only 10 cents each way, the injustice and
unwise policy of our local roads must be clearly
demonstrated to the most disinterested,
"it can hardly be expected that many people
will decide to make their permanent residence
In Marin when J they can go to nd | from^Ala
meda County at more frequent intenals for
about one-third the cost. - These railroads have
had many practical illustrations of the benefits
to be derived from cheap rates.' Whenever they
have run special trains at reduced fares the re
sult has generally been profitable, but for some
unfathomable reason San Rafael -has never en
joyed the privilege, but has been discriminated
against in the matter, as time-tables offering
cheap rates specify for "all points north of San
Rafael " The result of this system is that after
an existence of over forty years, and, notwith
standing its beauties of nature and advantages
of climate, San Rafael remains comparatively
little more than a village.* having a population
estimated to be about 3500 while wltfi proper
treatment from the railroads she should have
not less than 20,000.7 .*-"-. "\
. San Rafael has at last become tired of being
referred to as the "bedroom for San Francisco. ,
Marin County has ever.been debarred to the
working classes, and 7to the business mad
whose occupation requires that he be in San
Francisco by 7 a. M. > Boats and trains . have
been so regulated that the person who is com
pelled to be in San Francisco by 7 o'clock can
not reside in Marin County. . This certainly
shuts out a large class. - . _\ V"
. Mr. Smith, who it was understood at the
meeting voiced the sentiments of the control
ling interests of the narrow-gauge, road, gave
the people to | understand in very polite. and
eloquent language that they, the narrow-gauge
people, would not grant j the request for which
the meeting was called â¢ until ; a consolidation
of the two roads now running into San Rafael
had been effectedâ but, although ' Mr, Smith
pronounced the word | consolidated, every one
present spelled it m-o-n-o-p-o-ly, and they have
since realized that if the temporary injunction
that was served on the officials of the broad
gauge road was made ' permanent, the hopes of
a reduction of rates might as well be at once
abandoned, while on the other hand the im-
prcssion seems to prevail that if the directors
of the broad gauge, bad not been restrained
from acting they would have decided to give
the experiment of cheap fare a trial.
As the matter now stands, the people only
look to the broad-gauge road, and their hopes
are based in anticipation of the injunction
now restraining the officials being dissolved,
and leaving them freedom to act on the peti
tion of the people asking for the reduced sched
ule. But should the narrow-gauge people see
the error of their present course in regard to
fares, and decide | to reduce them, "the people,
while being surprised, will be proportionately
more pleased. '
Of course the people of San Rafael are not
quite unanimous on the subject, but as nearly
so as possible. . There is a' small minority,
very small indeed, whom Father Lagan ap
propriately chriatenca the "snobocracy," who
would prefer that the corporate limits of the
town be divided only into private -grounds;
that only > mansions of the highest order be
allowed to be constructed thereon, and that all
business and trades be , excluded j therefrom.
But, as has been remarked, this : class consists
of so few that they have been entirely ignored.
Then there is the chronic objectorâ he is
usually a unit, alone in his alleged ideas. He
waits until he has heard the opinions and ex
pressions of everybody else on any subject,
then he studies and plans arguments (he never
acts) in contradiction of all . he has heard on
the subject, just to be contrary.
With these exceptions the people of San
Rafaet are unanimous that they are treated
unjustly, and not with the consideration that
is due them, and if relief is not afforded them
soon they will devise methods to help them
selves. A Resident.

A PLAIN SHIRT WAIST.
The special features of the shirt waist shown
here are the high turnover collar and the five
box pleats In front, the center one serving for
the buttonhole flap.
The cuff and collar may be made detachable
by finishing neck and wrists with straight
bands an inch wide when finished. Make but
tonholes at the ends and one at the center
back of neck. Finish the cuffs and collar by
turning in at the edges' where they join the
garment and place corresponding buttonholes
â  Tne new batistes with line, of -bright colors
in stripes or cross bars , make very stylish
waists. When ' made with detachable collars
and cuffs, ribbon collars ; and,' trimmings

INCIDENTS in the career of King
Alfred the Great are the foundation
for a four-act dramatic poem, "Eng
land's Darling," which is Alfred Aus
tin's first production :in book form
since his appointment as poet laureate.
The poem is dedicated to the Princess of
Wales, "daughter of vanished Vikings and
mother of English Kings to be." In his
interesting preface Mr. Austin says that in
the spacious gallery of commanding char
acters commemorated in English poetry
there is a strange and unaccountable
blank. Where we look for the most illus
trious figure of all there is an empty niche.
The greatest of Englishmen has never
been celebrated by an English poet. /Ex
tolled by a succession of prose historians
and deeply rooted in the affections of his
countrymen by an unbroken tradition,
which for a thousand years has
designated him "England's Darling,"
Alfred is forgotten by Chaucer, all
but ignored by Spenser, . unnamed
by Shakespeare,' and but fortuitously
alluded to by the most eminent of their
successors. King Alfred has always been
Austin's favorite hero, the name and the
tales that clustered, round it forming the
most enthralling pages of his nursery
erudition. The language of the characters
in the poem is mainly of Saxon origin â
the natural utterance of English men and
women living in the ninth century of our
era. The production is a notable one,
brilliant in many respects, and the poet
laureate has well begun the work of em
balming Alfred's memory m verse.
The first act relates the love-making of
Edward, son of Alfred, and Edgiva, the
Danish maiden. Then Alfred appears on
the scene, disguised as a peasant, and the
poet tells the familiar old Â«tory of the King
sitting in the hut, studying his book and
allowing tbe cakes to scorch. In the sec
ond act Alfred appear* before the Saxon
Witanagemote at Athelney, a noble and
heroic figure, surrounded by the lords and
ealdermen. He makes a strong speech,
showing the necessity of war to rid Eng
land of the Danish heathens. The assem
bled freemen join in striking their shields
with their spears and hailing the King-
Alfred: Alfred!
Lord of England!
England's comfort!
England's shepherd !
England's Darling!
Alfred! Alfred!
The King is next seen in his study, mak
ing models of long-oared boats to cope
with the Danish esks. In the third act we
find Alfred addressing his son in view of
the approaching war, and then teaching
Edgiva to read in the forest. In the fourth
act he rises to the heights of heroism by
overcoming Guthrum, Oskytel and the
heathen Jarls. In this act, before the bat
tle, King Arthur sipgs thus happily of the
origin of England:
In the Beginning
When, out of darkness.
The Earth, the Heaven,
.. The Stars, the Reasons,
The mighty mainland.
And whale-ploughed water,
By God the maker
Were formed and fashioned,
/ Then God made England.
tHe made It shapely
k.'kk With land-locked inlets,
>nd gray-green nesses ; â¢
With rivers roaming
From fair-leafed forests
Ti rough windless valleys,
Past plain and pasture.
To sloping shingle;
Thus God made Kngland.
Having conquered his foes, the King de
clares
For me, I have no other wish on earth,
Save to leave long remembrance after me
Of something done for England.
For a genuine Saxon song, rich in dis
tinctively Saxon words, there is commend
able merit in that sung by the serfs in the
first scene of the second act. Here it is
reproduced
Fetch me a hunk of salted flitch
And a jug of sweetened ale,
Aud off 1 trudge to bank the ditch
Or bang about the flail.
Who recks of summer sweat and swink,
Or winter's ley pang?
. . Tilt up the mug, my mates, and drink,
And let the world go hang,
iV-V. Go hang,
And let the world go hang !
Boar, youngsters, snap the fallen sticks
>"oÂ«, hearthwife, boll the pot,
For we have thatched the barley-ricks,
And plowed the gafol plot. .
The shepherd's star begins to wink,
' The she-wolf whets her fang:
Up with the mead bowl, mates, and drink,
And let the world go ban?,
Go hang,
And let the world go hang !
The volume also contains the "Passing of
Merlin," originally published in the Lon
don Times. October 7. 1892, being the
author's tribute to bis great predecessor,
Tennyson, on the occasion of the latter's
death. Here is a stanza:
April will blossom again, again will ring
With cuckoo's call and yaffel's flying scream,
And in veiled sleep the nightingale will dream,
Warbling as if awake. But what will bring
His sweet note back? He mute, it scarcely will be
spring. fI|p_MpHHHMI

brary. It professes to be "the brotherly
words of a Briton. to his fellow-men at
home and abroad, with a special message
to his Brother Jonathan." The author
sails under the norn de plume of Novus
Homo. As the title implies, the book
maintains that the "alpha". of all- human
improvement is in the - human "bodily re
generation," in the breeding and training
of true thoroughbred human animals and
"the ultimate extirpation of low grades."
After showing mankind, as far as he is
able, how to attain the physical and intel
lectural high-grade standard for the race,
the Briton brims over with advice to the
American Republic. 98SGP
He has the nerve to suggest what he
deems "improvements" for injection into
our Declaration of Independence. He
may certainly be assured that the Declaia
tioh is very good as it' stands, and served
quite well as an epoch-making document
in historyâ in history with which even a
Briton sfiould be tolerably well acquainted.
Novus Homo wants us to raise .first-grade
men and * women. . As - far as that goes
America can y challenge * the world right
now lor high-grade average. Novus Homo
suggests that we make the "welfare" of
the people the ? Nation's p supreme law.
Upon inquiry, he could j have learned that
tbis Nation was built r specifically for the
people's welfare and is still being run with
that laudable intention, and it* was built
in /spite of the -rather unfriendly,
and persistent efforts of our beloved cous
ins over the water. v Novus Homo desires
us to educate all our children and support
the common schools, yHe * ought to come
over here and ; glance;; around. 7; He would
find : our system v of public education the
best in the " world, as it ; is, and steadily
advancing to even a higher plane. Y. In
fact, despite Novus s Homo's ; fears - for our
future,^ it may be' said .that Americans
have been able* to take .care of 4 themselves
for the past hundred years : and Y more, and
they will probably succeed in keeping up
appearances in the van of the procession
of nations for some time to come. The
author calls the American Republic the
"Greater Britain of the Western World,"
and he wants Brother Jonathan to
initiate a commercial and defensive
federation of amity among English speak
ing people for the maintenance of interna
tional peace and the furtherance of racial
and international prosperity. This is ex-;
pected to lead to the federation of the
world. Meantime, let us observe our cous
ins across the ocean â¢ are continually
adding to their navy and Brother Jonathan
is preparing to preserve peace, so far as he
is concerned, by showing well-wishing rel
atives that they will find him ready to kick
if they tread on his corns. [New York:

A RICH MAX'S DAUGHTER.
In "A Rich Man's Daughter," Mrs. J. H.
Riddell has furnished a peculiar story that
is, nevertheless, put together in no un
attractive manner. A young London phy
sician, who has been pursued by ill luck
from childhood, is practicing in the poorest
quarter of the great city, when he chances
to meet the daughter of a rich man. They
fall in love and marry .in secret. Luck
doesn't change, however. The daughter
I fears her father's rage if he should learn
the secret, and ' refuses to disclose it in
j spite of the urging of the young- medico,
who has a keen eye to his possible finan
cial betterment as well as the society of
his wife. Time flies. The father . favors
the suit of a wealthy and ardent
admirer. To this man the doctor's
wife confesses, but the information is
still withheld from the old man. At j
I length the husband departs for the East. j
| Then the father fails, and, to add to his
despair, discovers that his daughter has j
become a mother. He is about to end
i both lives with a revolver when the old- j
time wealthy admirer appears and ex- j
; plains matters. Then a dispatch comes to
j say that the doctor has fallen a victim to j
the cholera, the wealthy suitor helps out i
j the old man â¢ financially, marries the
! young physician's widow, and the secret j
; marriage i's never mentioned. [New York : J

THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
This is a reprint of one of Thomas
Hardy's works which was first issued in I
1873. The hero of the story is described as
one who takes ennoblement rather than ;
j repentance for his text. He has a convic- j
] tion that the want of most men is knowl- j
edge of a sort that brings wisdom rather
than affluence. He lives in a rural world
i that is not ripe for him and the author
; remarks: "A man should be only par
j tially before his time; to be completely to
the vanward in aspirations is fatal to
fame. In the interests of renown the
forwardness should lie chiefly in the
capacity, to manipulate. Successful pro-
Sagandi-ts have succeeded because the
octrine they. bring into form is that
which their listeners have for some time
felt without being able to. shape." The
hero throws up his business to benefit his
fellow creatures and does not receive the
blessings which, Hardy says, "come to the
well-proportioned mind"â happiness and
commonplace. He finds bis vocation at
least in the career of an itinerant open
air preacher and lecturer on morally un
impeachable subjects, and of course there
were many in the old home who were
ready to say that "it was well onongh for
a man to take to preaching who could not
see to do anything: else. [New York:

EDITOR VERSUS POET.
Neith Boyce, in the Philistine, complains
that some magazine editors mischievously
meddle with the songs or sonnets of con
tributors, who naturally wax wroth when
th^ir verses are accepted "and in the course
of years published" to find the trail of the
editor's blue pencil over all the printed
lines. One might opine that R. W. Gilder
is suspected of "editing" some of Neith's
poetry in the manner hinted at. Neith
pleads her cause and goes after offending
editors in this capital style :
If the editor knows to a comma how he wants
his poetry written let him write it himself, as
Mr. Gilder mostly does. If he thinks he can
improve on the poetical style of his contributor
and wants to put in his time that way let him
write and propose collaboration, or at least
submit to the poor mortal of an author a plan
of the contemplated improvements. But to go
ahead on his own hook and change the whole
complexion of the thing perhaps, and then
send it out over the original signature? It is
not honest.
The author relinquishes I for a time the child
of his brain, fondly expecting lo get it back
again in beautiful new clothes of type. What
be does get is a changeling with dyed hair
and a clothesoin on its nose. Is he grateful?
Hardly.: * ' â '- . . ..
When the editor accepts a drawing for his
magazine, does he proceed to work it over,
put in a few more shadows, touch up the high
lights and perhaps alter the arrangement of
the model's back hair?- Not as a rule."
A magazine is not a school for. drawing, nor
ls it a literary kindergarten. An editor is not
a pedagogue. . 7- .. '
If hethinKsa thing good enough to print,
let him print it honestly as it was made; if not,
let him return it with thanks and encourage
the author to send it somewhere else. That
author, if he is worth his Attic salt, would
rather have his verses printed in : the Podunk
Thinker as he wrote them than in the Century
with R. W. Gilder's emendations.
A GRAY EYE OR SO.
This is. an English story of. love and
politics, in which parts are played by peo- j
ple of high and low rank in society. The
author, F. Frankfort Moore, does not seem
to hold a very high estimation of the
British conscience. At the conclusion of
the volume, when hero and heroine, after
many vicissitudes, < approach the usual
outcome, the heroine cries: "You are a
fool if you cannot ; see that your career is
just beginning. People are talking of you
to-day as the Conscientious One â the One
Man with a Conscience. Isn't the reputa
tion for a conscience the beginning of suc
cess in Endand?" V . â¢
The reply is: "Helen, will ; you marry,
me. With our combined money we can
make ourselves; necessary to any party.
Will you marry me?"
The marriage winds up the book. But
Mr. Moore is probably . not much of ; a
student of the British! conscience. YHe is
just a book-writer. [Chicago: Rand, Mc-

THE LOST STRADIVARIUS.
In this weirdly attractive story J. Mead
Faulkner enlarges on the idea that the
mind may be directed on the one hand to
ascetic abnegation by the systematic use
of certain music, or on the other, to illicit
and dangerous pleasures by melodies of an
opposite tendency. It is contended, how
ever, that after a comparatively advanced
standard of culture has been once
attained, music is the readiest if
not the. only Key which admits to the
narrow circle ; of .the highest imaginative
thought. V' Briefly outlined, the story is
that in the year 1738, wherein the world's
greatest violin-maker, Antonius Stradi
varius, died, an Englishman of culture,
traveling in Cremona, attended an auction
sale of the stock of Stradivarius fiddles.
Having a remarkable ear for music, and
being a violinist as well, he purchased the
instrument which most appealed to his
fancy. A history attached â to that instru
ment. Though it was of the master's
golden period and * probably the finest
violin he ever. made, Stradivarius would
never sell it and it had hung in his shop
for an age. As he lay dying, it was said,
he gave orders I that it should be buried,
but his instructions were neglected and it
came under the hammer. The original
possessor became a victim, mentally and
physically, to the influence of the peculiar
music to which - ; the instrument was par
ticularly responsive. He kept the fiddle in
a secret spot, and after his tragic death
the Stradivarius was lost for years, until
John Maltravers discovered the hiding
place through the violin's responsiveness
to certain strains, which also seemed to
conjure up the ghost of the dead owner.
Maltravers, in turn, becomes a victim of
mental degradation. The music which
enchained him had an unwholesome effect
on his impressionable nature and dragged
him to his ruin. At the death of Mal
travers the curse which seemed to attend
the possession of the instrument is got
rid of in a summary manner. The guar
dian of Maltravers' son burns the Strad
ivarius fiddle and the book with the mind
conquering evil music. [New York: D.

OLD FAITHS AND NEW FACTS.
William W. Kinsley, in : preparing this
religious work, has recognized the fact, so
he declares, that there is a public, rapidly
enlarging, made up of vigorous, progres
sive inquirers, eager after truth and will
ing to follow it wherever it may lead, to
which the old proofs of the Christian faith
appear wholly inadequate, and conse
quently the old beliefs to be shrouded in
the gravest doubt. "It is not enough for
them to be shown merely what the Scrip,
tures teach and the canons of the church
authoritatively affirm. They call for facts
âfacts incontrovertibly established with
scientific accuracy, with cool judicial pre
cision, in the various departments Yof
physics and .metaphysics, biology and
psychology, history and biography, of the
many different branches of modern : re
search. They call for an orderly, logical
grouping and interpretation of these facts
and a clear demonstration of the underly
ing principles and laws that witness to the
active y presence of ;an , organizing, â '- over
ruling mind." It is to such inquirers that
he , addresses his work, "Old 'Faiths and
New Facts," and be aims to -carry on his
discussions^ from (their standpoint while
endeavoring to answer, to. the satisfaction
of ; the scientific ; investigator, ; such vital
questions as these: Does prayer avail?

NEW YORK AS A LITERARY MART.
Edward W. Bok, in March Ladies' Home
Journal, writes of "The American Literary
Center," and presents the claims of "New
York and Boston (between which cities it
may be inferred it rests) for the distinc
tion. He summarizes New York in"; this
way: "* * *â¢ New York undoubtedly
offers the largest market ' for literature of
any city in America. This is naturally so,
as must always follow in the case of the
largest and wealthiest city of any country.
The Empire City controls : the largest
number of publishing-houses, even though
it cannot claim all the principal ones. V It
has a larger number of magazines and
periodicals of all kinds than any other
city, even though it is deprived the right
tothe first and foremost of : all literary
periodicals, the leading eclectic magazine
of the world, or of the most widely
circulated channels of serial 7 litera
ture. But, unquestionably, it has the
â¢majority, and a powerful majority; it is.
It has libraries galore, one might almost
say," yet the two .principal! libraries of the
country are in other . cities. Its ~> list of
authors, resident of ": tbe city or near it, is
long and representative, embracing some

SOME LITTLE OF THE ANGEL LEFT
Mrs. John M. Clay, whose famous
stables in the Blue Grass State were re
cently described in The Call, is a woman
of literary ability, and her spirited racing
story, "Some Little of the Angel ; Left,", is
a production that reflects credit on her as
an authoress. In depicting scenes and
incidents of the training-stable and 'the
excitement of the racecourse she - is
thoroughly at home. The race in which
the horse Don Juan and his jockey are
killed with victory almost within "their
grasp is remarkable for fidelity' and
pathetic power. The leading characters
are strongly drawn. The love story in the
book is quite charming, and . a Crimean
battle-scene makes V a splendid climax.

GRAY'S IMMORTAL "ELEGY."
Gray, the poet, omitted two -. four-line
stanzas from the "Elegy." - According to
Mason the stanzas were omitted by the
poet (just before the epitaph) because "he
thought it was too long a parenthesis.''
Of the first stanza James Russell Lowell
affirmed that "Gray might run his pen
through this, but he could not obliterate
it from the memory of men. Surely
Wordsworth 'himself," continued the
American critic, "never achieved a sim
plicity of language so pathetic in sugges
tion, so musical in movement as this.''
The two verses are as follows: kXk'k
There scattered oft, the earliest of the year, .
By hand* unseen are showers of violets found;
The redbreast loves to build and warble there,
And little footsteps lightly print the ground.
Him have we seen the greenwood side along
While o'er the heath we hied, oar labor done;
Oft as the woodlart piped her farewell song,
With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun.

is- From a review in the Critic < the interest
ing r fact yis y learned - that Mr. Gladstone ?
usually reads three books at the same time,
| changing from .one to the other for his
I mental well-being, as one would change
from mountain to seashore for: his physi
cal health. "When there are no visitors at
the castle he enjoys the society of his
.family or his book, never a pipe. 7 He does
not smoke now and never has smoked.
He goes to bed early and reads in bed, a
luxury which he has just begun to allow
himself. Seven hours jis â¢; all he gives to
sleep because he thinks it sufficient, not
because it is all he wants. He would
rather have eight and admits that he hates
to get up at any time, but adds that "one
can do everything by habit, and when I
have had ray seven uours' sleep my habit
is to get up."

be of value to persons engaged in literary
and journalistic work. It tells how to

FRANZ ONDRICEK , came and
played and conquered on Thurs
day evening. The little violinist
achieved his sudden victory by a
brilliant charge on the emotions of
his audience, a carrying by assault, in which
his reckless verve and fire swept all before
him and made his hearers captives of his
bow and "Strad" before they had had time
to steel themselves against exhibiting, an
enthusiasm of which under less excitine cir
cumstances San Francisco would blush to
be guilty.
When Ondricek began the Ernst "Con
certo Pathetico," he was listened to
pathetically, not to say coldly, but the
Edwin Milton Royle in "Captain Impudence" ("Mexico") at the California T heate
icy atmosphere did not seem to affect his
spirits. The little violinist just tossed
back the rugged mane which had fallen
over his eyes and looked round the house
with a pleasantly inquiring expression,
which seemed to say, "Oh! you won't
warm up V Well, we shall see," and then
he began to trace out those intricate
musical embroideries in which the concerto
abounds, ana people suddenly sat up in
their seats and bestowed upon Ondricek
their undivided and admiring attention.
More musical embroideries followed, and
the attention grew terser and terser till it
broke at last in a storm of enthusiasm,
such as this City has seldom seen.
Ondricek well deserved all the applause
he received. He is a player of verve and
fire, sure of his technique and brilliant to
an extreme degree, both in his execution
and interpretation. He does not possess
the breadth and classic purity of concep
tion which would make one long to hear
him in Beethoven or Spohr, but, on the
other band, he is peculiarly at home in
works of a Slavonic or Bohemian charac
ter, which in addition to brilliant tech
nique demand temperament on the part
of the performer. Marsick was almost de
void of temperament, which was the chief
reason why, with all his refined school, he
appealed only to the few, but the magnetic
Ondricek, who is peculiarly a player of
temperament, possesses the power of ap
pealing to the many. Unlike many tem
peramental . players, however, the Bohe
mian is not careless in the matter of in
tonation.
Materna won as great a triumph as
Ondricek. What an artist this woman is !
Her voice is like a fluegelhorn, clear, pene
trating, magnificent, and after twenty
five years of music drama she has her great
organ as thoroughly under control as if it
were the thread of voice owned by a color
atura singer. What phrasing, what ex
pression Materna has ! Truly, it is a price
ess lesson to hear her, and nothing so gives
the lie to the oft-repeated statement, that
music drama means shrieking and bellow
ing, as to hear this great Wagnerian artist
Bing with a school that an Italian might
envy.
"The Milk White Flag," like most of
-Scene From "The Hoop of Gold" at Morosco's Grand Opera- House.
The
Theatres
Hoyt's plays, has one great advantage. V I
gives you an opportunity of hearing re
fined and expunged variety "turns," while
you can lay the pleasing unction to r your
soul that you are patronizing "comedy."
So many sensitive souls shrink from the
word "variety." Music halls and cafes
cbantants, where this form of entertain
ment prevails, are called low and vulgar
and are associated in the public mind with
beer and tobacco y smoke. Any one, how
ever, who imagines that .variety only ap
peals to the public mind in such an atmos
phere should hear Miss Agnew sing her
"Baby" song, or listen to the deafening
applause that follows Watson's magnifi-
cent take-off of how the Oakland trains go
"click, click, click." In short, it is not
as much the play that's the thing as the
excellence of the variety artists. . /'"!,
Baldwin Theater.
"A Milk-white Flag" has proved so at
tractive that the management of the Bald
win Theater has decided to give the public
a chance of seeing more of the amusing
Hoyt farce-comedy by having Sunday
night performances. The first will take
place to-night.
James O'Neill follows "A Milk-white
Flag" at the Baldwin Theater. He will
present during the first week of his en
gagement ".Monte Cristo," "Virginius,"
"Courier of Lyons" and "Hamlet." Mr.
O'Neill will be supported during his en
gagement by a company of players which
includes a girl who is said to be the young
est leading lady on the American stage.
California Theater.
To-morrow night the California Theater
will reopen with the first San Francisco
production of the new romantic comedy,
"Captain Impudence," or "Mexico," by
Edwin Milton Royle,. tbe author of
"Friends."
In one sense "Captain Impudence" is a
war play, but it does not depend, for its
interest on the war element of the story.
The plot deals with the love affairs of two
soldiers, one ' elderly . and pompons,
the other young and dashing. The tragic
events which happen to a senorila, who is
in love with the hero, adds an element of
sadness to the lighter phases with which
the play abounds. It. is said that the in
terest is not allowed to flag all through the
drama and that a pretty picture of soldier
life is afforded by .."Captain Impudence."
Grover's Alcazar.
A new order of entertainment will be
inaugurated at Grover's Alcazar to-day in
the shape of the. Bailey continuous show,
which commences at the . matinee and
continues ; till the usual time for closing
the theater.
Continuous show performances have be
come very popular in i the East, but the
idea is a novelty in this City. ; The com
pany which will make the experiment at
the Alcazar is said to be a strong one. It
includes Lester and Mitchell, travesty
artists; Le Grand Ayling, who rejoices in
the title of "SkatorialKing'!;. Helen
Hathaway, a banjo artist; Avis, who

Leonard Grover 'Jr. will appear in the
farce-comedy, "My Wife's Husbands."
Jerome K. . Jerome's comedy," "Sunset,"
will be presented at each performance.
There will be ; matinees every day, at
which icecream and cake will* be served.
Special Easter gifts will be presented. The
prices for the continuous show will be 10
cents, 15 cents and 25 cents. Matinee and
night the same.
Columbia Theater.
"A Texas Steer," headed by Tim Mur
phy, the well-known comedian, will be the
attraction at the U Columbia Theater to
morrow night. The role of the cattle king
who bursts upon Congress in a sombrero
hat, with a gun, still remains one of Hoyt's
very happiest creations, and it is a role
,with which Tim Murphy's name is thor
oughly identified.
. Although "A Texas Steer" has ceased to
be a novelty it is a satire on American
politics, which, if well acted, never fails to
arouse hearty laughter, for its clever hits
are as applicable to-day as they were when
Hoyt first wrote them, and the intrinsic
fun of the piece has not been surpassed by
any of the playwright's later worm.
New Auditorium.
On account of the success of Anna Eva
Fay's performance at the Auditorium she
will play a' return engagement of seven
appearances. The first of the series will
take place to-morrow evening, when the
mystic lady, will repeat all her feats, in
cluding .an exhibition of "The State of
Somnolency," in which she answers ques
tions which members of the audience
have previously written on slips of paper
and have put away in their own pockets.
Considerable mystification is always
caused by the positive certainty with
which Miss Fay answers almost all the
questions.
Auditorium Concert.
Fran Amalia Materna, the Wagnerian
singer, and Franz Ondricek, the Bohemian
violinist, will give a grand concert at the
new Auditorium to-night. The following
programme will be rendered:

Grand Opera-House.
Mortimer Murdock's "Hoop of Gold" is
to be the attraction at the Grand for the
week. It is described as a realistic spectac
ular melodrama, which suggests that its
plot is of less importance than scenic
effects and sensational situations. The
story, however, is said to be well wrttten
and to be full of strong interest.
The chief feature of the production will
be a representation of Westminster Bridge,
London, with a distant view of the houses
of Parliament and the moonlit Thames.
This scene has been especially: painted
from photographs by bydney Chedley.
The re-engagement of -" the V popular
comeay team, Gilbert and Goldie, will
augment the attractions of "Hoop of Gold."
Tivoli Opera-House.
Vincent Wallace's melodious and famil
iar opera, "Maritan_," will be heard to
morrow night at the Tivoli Opera-house.
Carrie Roma will sing the title role of
Maritana, the Spanish gypsy ; Kate March!
will beLarazillo, the" apprentice, and Mar
tin Pache will be Don Caesar de Bazan, the
dashing noble, whose sword is his fortune.
With regard to the rest of the cast John J V
Raffael will be the Don Jose and Ferris
Hartman the Marquis de MoDtefiori. The i
conductor will be Carl Martens, who . is
doing good work at the Tivoli.
After the production of "Maritana"
Richard . Stahl's romantic Oriental comic
opera, "Said Pasha," is to be heard, It
will be followed by a revival of Balfe's
ballad opera, "The Rose of Castilie." after
which the Easter burlesque, "Blue Beard,"
upon which the stage artisans and cos
turners are now at work, will be given an
elaborate production.
At tbe Orpheum.
A long list of new people will be intro
duced at the Orpheum to-morrow night.

sparkling brunette of medium height, over
flowing with energy and vitality . and pos

With a firm intention to master the art

significant. By diligent and conscientious
work she has been steadily advancing
under the appreciative encouragement of

from her desire. Next season she hopes
to secure an engagement with a stock

this means an incredible amount: of hard

statistics that inform us of this fact.'; If we use
the club you are to blame for putting it in our
hands.

drunkenness, debauchery and licentiousness
was a menace to womanhood, childhoodâ aye,
and manhood. y . ".
We hear sometimes that a man's wife does
not want to vote. Now, I am .ashamed of a
man whose wife doesn't . wan to vote. He
ought to go home and convert her.

â â BREEDING
BUFFALOES
IN
CALIFORNIA
A BOUT fifteen years ago it became
ABOUT fifteen years ago became
apparent that the American
/-^\ ' bison, or buffa o as it is com-
A j\. monly called, was rapidly being
exterminated. The alarm was
pounded, ami every State and Territory in
the Union where the animals were in
digenous passed laws prohibiting the kill
ing of them in the future. The alarm was
Bounded a little late, however, as there
were hardly enough buffaloes left to supply
the circuses and menageries of the coun
try, and for some mysterious reason those
running wild on the different Government
reservations and parks failed to multiply.
Young were born, to be sure, but they did
not exceed the deaths from natural causes.
Since that time a great many efforts
have been made in different parts of the
West to properly care for the few buffa
loes left, so that they could breed and
thereby perpetuate the species. In Colo
rado the experiment has been a failure on
account of the intensely cold winters,, and
in Utah the so-called "success has been
rather dubious, although the promoters
feel that they are on the right track and
have reason to be hopeful. It is most
likely that the many failures were due to
a lack of understanding of the habits of
the buffalo. There is little doubt but that
the animals are naturally sensitive to
changes of climate, and in the wild state
used to travel, south in the winter and
north in the summer, so as to avoid ex
tremes of heat and cold. In the experi
ments made in Colorado and Utah these
HERD OF BUFFALO ON MORO CIJO RANCH, NEAR CASTROVILLE.
i conditions were hardly complied with.
The real cause of trouble is greatly due to
the fact that scientists never had "a chance
to study the buffalo before, they were so
scarce it was impossible to do so.
But in spite of the many failures else
where,! it looks as if the buffalo-breeding
experiment will be a success in California,
and if it is it will be largely due to the mild
and equable climate.' The experiment in
this State has been made by the well
known capitalist, Esteban, J. .Molera, and
after nearly six years he feels more en
couraged than . ever. Mr. Molera has
studied the buffalo, and in his experiments
has endeavored to keep as close to nature
as possible, and at the same time make use
of all the scientific knowledge he could
obtain on the subject.
Mr. Molera commenced his experiments
on a modest scale in the autumn of 1890.
His first purchase was a magnificent buf
falo bull that he obtained from a traveling
exhibitor named Gardener. The animal
was in the best of health and Mr. Molero
knew it must be hardy or it would not
have been able to have stood the discom
forts and hardships of travel. He had the
animal taken to his Point Sur ranch in
Monterev County and turned loose on the
range. It was contented from the start
and soon became fat. Seeing that the
winter climate agreed with the bull -Mr.
Molera sent to B. Jones of Nebraska and
obtained a buffalo cow, which he also
turned out on the range. '
That was in V 1891 and in 1892 a fine bull
calf was born that has now grown to ma
turity and is in the best of health. En
couraged by his success Mr. Molera ob
tained from Mr. Weaser four more cows,
all of which gave birth to calves that are
now nearly 2 years old. Some of the cows
have given birth to two calves, the last of
which are still very young. Including his
purchase Mr. Molera's herd now numbers
fourteen. He has not lost a single full
bred call, and the entire herd is in the Dest
of health and spirits, and they should
multiply in the same ratio in the future as
they have in the past; If they do the herd
will increase to over 100 in the next seven
years and as they ' will be all acclimated
animals there 'seems to be no reason why
the buffalo should become extinct.
In addition to his experiments with full
blooded buffaloes, Mr. Molera has also
tried the effects of crossing the buffalo
bull with the Galloway cow. His success
at first was not as encouraging as with
the full breeds. The first season four
calves were born, but three of them died.
The other, however, grew up in good
health, and Mr. Molera thinKs the loss of
the other three was due to carelessness on
the part of the men whovcared for them.
Since then . other calves have been born
from the same cows and all appear to be
in the best of health. Strange to say, all
of the half-breed calves were females. '/
Some of these calves are now nearly three
years old, and an effort has been made to
cross tbem again and it promises to suc
ceed. â  To avoid inbreeding Mr. Molera
has put the first buffalo bull he purchased
out in Golden Gate Park and taken fero
cious . Ben Harrison down to his ranch.
The old fellow seems happy and contented
on the range and has greatly improved in
appearance. Ths : crossing with the half
breed Galloways will produce an animal
three-quarters buffalo, and; if they prove
strong and hardy Mr. Molera will obtain
other buffalo bulls in different parts of the
country and conduct his experiments until
he has produced an animal that is fifteen
sixteenths buffalo. He thinks that when
that stage: is reached, he will have an al
most distinct breed of cattle that will mul
tiply without any crossing. ...
The effects of crossing is a much more
interesting and important matter than the
simple breeding of the full-breed buffaloes,
which is, after all, more a matter of science
and sentiment than anything else. Should
the full-breed buffalo he raised insufficient
numbers to warrant its being killed, only a
small portion of * each animal makes good
food and the skin can yonjy bemused for
robes. On the other hand, all of the half
breed makes good meat. The skin makes
the best kind of leather and also has a finer
and thicker growth of hair than the full
breed buffalo. Some ; of the cattle, in fact,
have a fur that is almost as fine as seal
skin, only the hairs are much longer. â -.â¢_
In conducting his experiments Mr.
Molera has made an effort to keep ail of
his buffaloes contented. YAs soon as he
detects any signs of restlessness he has
them moved ; to another ranch." The ani
mals have passed their time between Point
Bur ranch, below Monterey, and ' Moro 1
Cojp ranch, near Castroville. AH have J
shown the indications of a need of change
at the same time and are driven the en
tire distance between the two places.
After they have made the trio they are as
quiet and contented as can be for a few
months. â¢*ft~rtWH__
In addition to changing the animals
from ranch to ranch they are constantly
being given a change of range. They are, j
of course, always kept within fence, but as ,
none of the ranges contain less than sixty j
acres, this is practically no restriction.. j
Part of the time they are kept on wild land'
and made to get their living off the natural
vegetation, and then they are kept In al
falfa fields for a few days. The idea has
been to let them do as they please.' Sheds
are erected in different parts of the ranges
which they can occupy if they, choose, but
no effort is made to house them. ,
It is to this method that Mr.. Molera
thinks his success is due as much as any
thing else, because when an animal be
comes restless it loses its appetite and'
soon grows poor and -thin. Mr. Molera.
has also been fortunate in having: good
dispositioned animals. They have all run,
together on the same range in the most
perfect harmony. Even the buffalo cows
and the Galloway cows have got along in
the most friendly -manner, and in the
whole six years there has not been a single
fight. Results in breeding are slow to
reach, but if Mr. Molera realizes all that
he expects, there is no reason why others
should not follow his example and thereby
add to California many valuable re
sources. -kk~

Questionsâ Report of Expert

-- The' G. A. R. court of inquiry which
was ' recently appointed by Department
Commander Wilson to consider the charges
preferred by Lyon Post against the man
agement of the Veterans' Home held two
long sessions yesterday. -
"The court is composed of Judge A.J.
Buckles of Solano County, Judge J. M.
Walling of .Nevada County, Judge R. F.
Crawford of Sonoma, Major William Haw
ley, U. S. A. (retired) and General W. H.

Among witnesses examined were J. C.
Currier, J. J. Scoville, D. W. C. Thompson
and George A. Norton. â¢ â¢ - ~. y V
The principal witness of the day was
General Thompson* ex-commandant of the
Veterans' Home.. It was ascertained that
his testimony was somewhat reluctant and
evasive concerning the authorship of the
resolution adopted by Lyon Post. He de
clined.to state whether he had anything to
do with' the preparation of the charges.
His answer was that the question was a
"mixed -proposition," whereupon there
was a general laugh. To many other ques
tions he declined to answer on the advice
of his counsel, Judge Talcott, and refused
to tell the court why he declined to an
swer. . . .'- '.'â¢
Â© The charges were considered seriatim by
the court, and the witness questioned as to
his knowledge of the truth or falsity of
each. Concerning the charge of dishonesty
in the purchase of supplies pointed in
quiries were addressed to the witness, and
he was pushed steadily toward a specific
statement. Finally after much hesitation
he replied that Director Currier had bought
two plows in San Francisco that could
have been purchased for 10 per cent less at
Napa. He would not say that it was a
corrupt purchase, p
Captain Currier explained that the plows
were purchased by the committee in regu
lar order from a well-known firm.
The ex-commandant also testified that
many other articles were purchased ih San
. Francisco at prices 10 or 15 per cent more
than the market price at Napa. He also
said a boss painter was employed to favor
George H. Thomas Post when the work
could have been done for much less money
by competent painters at the home. The
witness thought Lincoln Post was about
as active as Thomas Post in looking for.
places for men.
The commander of Lyon Post, George A.
Norton, was called as a witness, It was
disclosed in the testimony that Comrade
Calhoun introduced the resolutions charg
ing mismanagement, but did so by request.
The post commander said he ruled out of
order the motion to have the resolutions
published. He knew nothing \ about the
action of the post in printing the resolu
tions. Copies were sent to the Governor
and others as directed.
The court had the room cleared â¢to con
sider the charges, and after deliberating
for a half hour opened the doors and an
nounced that the matter had- been taken
into consideration and that a full report
would be submitted in due time*- to the
department commander. It was the gen
eral j sentiment of the. Grand Army com
rades in attendance that the . report' of
the court would not sustain the charges;" 'â *.
Following is a synopsis of the report of
Comrade Philo Â£. Daniels/ an expert ap
pointed by the court of inquiry. It was
read at the morning session.
The investigation covers a period of
about three years' accounts, embracing in
that time nearly three thousand entries.
The report says :
I crosschecked the cashbook from the bank
book and the vouchers and ascerfained that
the receipts and disbursements of the same
were correct. The balances were drawn monthly
and I found no lapse, each month's accounts
of receipts balancing exactly with each
month's accounts of disbursements. ' The
method in use at the office was orderly and
systematic. J.J. Scoville, the present book
keeper, and J. C. Currier, treasurer, employ the
books in general use in nearly all classes of
business. â â - â â¢< *
I began my work with the cashbook, taking
the first entries, dated April 28, 1893, starting
in with the cash then already on hand in the
bank when Treasurer Currier assumed the du
ties of his office. The total receipts from the
United States and State appropriations, the
canteen, farm, discounts, etc., up to M arch 1,
1896, amount in the aggregate to 349,713 30,
and the expenditures covering the same pe
riod to $337,896 17, leaving a balance of
$11,823 19.
Warrants covering the amount appropriated
are clearly and accurately entered in the cash
book under proper dates and appropriate head
ings, showing the source from which it was
derived, and 1 checked all such warrants with
the bank books of the First National Bank of
San Francisco, proving that the same had been
promptly and correctly deposited therein from
time to time as they were received.
1 found the vouchers for all of the expendi
tures, amounting to $337,890 17, on file, num
bered consecutively from one to two thousand
and ninety-six, each and all of which corre
spond with the numbers of warrants and
checks drawn in payment of same.
I found that all bills before being paid were
first approved by the auditing committee of
the board, after which " their payment was
authorized by rollcall vote of the directors in
accordance ' with the by-laws, and such pay
ments were made first by a warrant on the
treasurer signed by the president and secretary
of the association and made payable to tho
creditor; and second, by check on First Na
tional Bank signed by the president and treas
urer. So that ior every bill paid there are in
reality three vouchers on file, viz.: the bill It
self duly receipted, and the warrant on i the
treasurer and the check on the bank, each
duly indorsed by the party . to whom the pay
ment was made. . â  -â :-. k -â â â â  '* â > ' ; p
Particular examination of the receipts and
expenditures of the $50,000. appropriation of
the State, for permanent improvements .was
made and the expert found that all the trans
actions in this respect were conducted as the
law directs and were approved by the State
Board of Examiners. * A detailed account of
the expenditures accompanies the report. J
In regard to pensions the report says: "The
books of the Treasurer show that on March 1,
1896, he had $10,330 37 belonging to the pen
sioners at the home. ' Of this amount $5085 20
IS deposited oh time: deposit in the San Fran
cisco Savings Union and the. balance, $5245 07,
deposited in the Sather Banking Company, sub
ject to the order .of the members of the home
.who are pensioners.- v. :â¢';â â¢ .-P p yyr.p . '
"Since December 16. 1893, the treasurer has
received the sum of $60,731 30 and paid to
pensioners and dependent relatives $50,400 43.
Every dollar' drawn out has been drawn* by
draft or check of which 1 there is record." .'-}' pY
The expert finds that the San Francisco office
is necessary- for the. economical maintenance
of the home, and that $5000 a year is saved by
having the office in this City. Concerning the
canteen the expert finds \ that it has . been ; a
source of profit rather than a loss to the insti
tution.â â '..â ' y:; , â¢ -y.yy. 'kk''' '-.-'â -' " .â¢.;â "â 'â '-.'â¢* â¢â¢
The report contains a detailed statement of
money expended for refurnishing five rooms
in the main buildings. ;-:â¢ y.-'P- . â¢ '
The expert is surprised at the magnitude of
the work carried on .by the directors and offi
cers at the headquarters of the association in
San Francisco. Suuplies are purchased by con
tract, and records or purchase are transmitted
to the State Board of Examiners and National
Board of :â â¢ Directors. *.' The ? expert cannot see
how It is ; possible for the friends â of - the di
rectors or officials sto be favored- in the pur
chasing of supplies. He is unable to discover
where fraud, embezzlement or .: misappropria
tion could be indulged. The schedules con
tain the names of bidders and the prices. ""-._â 
k: Treasurer J. C. Currier is highly commended
for the â â  orderly ?. and *". systematic ' method ,' of
keeping the pension accounts; and .surprise is

IN Childhoods Realm
YOU have told me so correctly
what is meant by the term "Red
Letter Day" that this week I am
going to ask. you to write a little
story or description of a "Red Let
ter Day" which you' have some time en
joyed.
Please don't forget about writing on only
one side of your paper.
And, by the way, did any of you ever
hear, or see written the words, "Oh, day to
be marked with a white stone?"
If you have, tell us about it.
I have introduced myself to you to-day,
so in the future you will know to whom to
address your letters.
The boys and girls of San Francisco have
their spring vacation this week, and that !
they may have a happy jolly- time is the
earnest wish of the editor of "Childhood's
Realm." .
A Little Child.
There is nothing more pure in heaven,
And nothing on earth more mild,
More full of light that is all divine,
Than the smile of a little child.
The sinless lips, half parted ;
With breath as sweet as the- air,
And the light that seems so glad to shine
. In the gold of the sunny hair. ' v --y.yp-
O, little one, smile and bless me! - â â¢
For, somehowâ l know not why â
I feel in my soul when children smile,
That angels are passing by.
I feel that the gates of heaven
- Are nearer than I knew,
That the light and the hope of that sweeter world,
Like the dawn, are breaking through.

The Ruined Hat.
A TRUE STORY. , , ,
Dear grandmother got out of the lumber- i
ing old stagecoach at the door, her arms
filled with boxes and bundles.. i
She had been away on a visit to the big ]
city, and now that she was safe at home j
again every one was happy, especially the
children ,* for she had brought" to them
beautiful presents. To her two little
granddaughters, Annie and Mary, lovely
spring hat- , all trimmed with green rib
bons and pink roses, and ' to her little
grandson. Jock, a fine suit of clothes and
a wonderful humming-top. â 
1 said every one was happy. So they
THE FAIN LITTLE GIRL PUT THE HAT ' UPON HER HEAD.
. [Sketched by a "CaU". artist.]
were, with the exception of Mary, who was
not quite happy.
Her hat was very, very pretty, but An
nie's was a little bit prettier, and I'm
sorry to say tbat ' t this was the reason why
she was not quite happy.
The hats were of the same creamy white,
trimmed with -the same kind of satiny
ribbon, with â¢ bunches of pink' roses and
buds of exactly the same size at the left
sides, but all around 9 the edge of Annie's
hat hung a lovely fringe 'of straw 1 and
crystal beads, which rattled and sparkled
whenever she shook her bead.
This fascinating fringe was the cause of
all the trouble. ,
Annie was the older of the two girls, so,
of course, it was right that her hat should
have a little more trimming on it than
Mary's, but that little girl did not think so.
BLOWING BUBBLES.
! She pouted and fretted over it all morning
and was altogether, so unhappy that she
could neither enjoy her picture books nor
play. When lunch time came that won
derful fringe kept twinkling and rattling
before her so that she could scarcely eat a
bite. .
. Her grandmother and mother felt very
much worried when they saw the little girl
so quiet, ior usually she was such a bright,
joyous child, and they feared she was ill.
She told them she was not ill, but was too
much ashamed of herself to let them know
the real cause of her ilnhappiness.
In the afternoon, when grandma -was
taking her usual nap and her mother and
sister had gone to call on a neighbor, and
Mary and her little brother were left to
amuse themselves, a naughty thought
popped into her head.
No sooner had it popped in than her
busy brain went to work to pop it out
again, at her finger-tips.* -
Climbing on a chair, ; she took her sis
ter's hatbox from its shelf, and catching
her little brother by the hand, slipped with
him in behind the. great kitchen door,
which stood wide open all day long.
| . It was an immense' door, for when it
was closed it formed' one , end of the
kitchen wall, so you see there was lots of
room behind it for Mary, her brother, and
the hatbox. , '- .-'.-.. â 
The vain little girl then took the hat
from . the box, and putting it on, called
upon her little brother to admire her, look
ing coquettishly at him with her brown
eves, and making sweet music with the
jingling crystals as she shook her curly
head.
"Don't you think it's a ; shame that

| hat hasn't any fringe," she inquired^
i after. he- had satisfied her with his looks
[ and words of admiration. -â¢"â",
"Dcs I does,'' said the child.
' "Let's V pull - the beads all â¢ off] then, and
her hat won't be any prettier ' than mine."
"All wight," answered Jock, always
ready to follow where his sister chose to
lead. '. . . "
: So busy fingers went to work and found
it by no means an easy task, but they kept
diligently at it. .
After a while grandma awakened from
her nap and came into the kitchen to look
for the little ones. Calling them by name
and receiving no answer, for the culprits
behind the door i kept as still as mice, she
supposed they were out under the trees
having a good time and : went : back to her
room. â  ' - 'k : ' r Â '
â¢ Then the little fingers faster flew. They
must get through before mamma returns.
They must put the box back in its place.
Then when she sees the -hat again she will
think Mary's good fairies have done the
work and never find out how it really
happened. Thus the little girl reasoned.
My. how dark it was growing behind
the door! What a quiet, far-away world it
was ! Then tired fingersâ sleepy eyes
nodding heads. .
What was that 1 Mamma's Voice calling
"M-a-ry, John-nic," in frightened tones.
"Where are youâ where are you?" ; Yy \
Great rushing around and slamming of
doors. *
"The babies are lost ! No one can find
them was heard on every side.
Finally some one thought of looking be
hind the great door. There, rubbing their
eyes and gaping as they awoke from a
sound slumber, were the two little ones
with the ruins of the beautiful fringe scat
tered all about them.
Mamma gave an exclamation of joy
when she saw her loved ones were safe,
but when she heard poor Annie sob and
cry at the discovery of her new hat, deco
rated with a fringe of tattered straw and
threads and all the beautiful beads gone."
her lace wore an expression both sad and
stern. '--â .".* v '
Something happened to Mary, then; I
need not tell you what. You know the
punishment she deserved for being so jeal

DONALD SERIES-NO. XX.
FOB TINY BOYS. â¢
One day as Donald and his . mamma
were sitting in the shade of the leafy fig
trees "Paul Pry ," : carrying ;aY little â¢ gray
mouse, came and crouched at their feet,"
looking up in ; their faces and beseeching
with ; his * eyes for words of praise, which'
| were freely given.
Satisfied that he had; been a good pussy
to '; catch such -at plumps member <of X the
"Gray" family, 4 he thought he would have
a little fun before his meaLY ".: rkkk
So he commenced to tease it by letting
it run a little ways from him, and then he
would spring at it and draw it back with
his paw. p -> Â» ..-*â¢'â 
Once be let the morsel get so far away
that Donald feared his pet was going to
lose his dinner, so up the little fellow
jumped and : before :; mamma ' could 't speaK
bad caught the mouse and held it strug
gling in his hand. Master Gray did not
like this at all and showed his displeasure
by inflicting a 'sharp bite ion one of the
lad's chubby fingers. â¢
"With; a frightened cry Donald dropped
it to Paul, who was so anxious to regain
his prize that in his eagerness he gave the
little boy's other hand a terrible scratch, j
â¢ Mamma was very fearful V lest the bite of
the mouse, wild with [ fright, might prove
poisonous, so after drawing: all the blood
from the wound she bathed it in J turpen
tine and covered it with a piece of soft
linen, while "Paul Pry" munched the
bones of the poor little animal with a great
deal of satisfaction after sucb an exciting
time. '
Donald nursed his wounds and said he
was 'stonished' to ; think ; a little mouse
could bite so ham and that he would leave
all the 'mice-catching to -'Paul Pry" and
the mouse-trap after this day's sperience.

The Schoolboy's Dram.
How much heroism there is in everyday
life no one knows until it is almost thrust
upon the observation.
V The most recent instance concerns an
Omaha schoolboy, Offie Downs, who, by
his presenco of Â« mind, prevented a panic
and a. terrible calamity among 500 chil
dren.
At this school there was an exercise
known as the "fire drill," and twice a day,
every pupil, from the primary class up,
marched out to the tap of the drum.
Every boy and girl knew just where to
stand, ' and so accurately; and thoroughly
were tbey trained that the principal often
boasted that the big building could , be
emptied- in two minutes without con
fusion. '"â  .': ';..â "'
Offie Downs, aged 14, was the drummer
boy of the school. It was his duty to
stand at the foot of the stairs and march
out the boys and girls twice a day to the
rat-tat-tat of his drum. . ' a
The other day the principal had an op
portunity to practically test ;. his fire-drill.
a teacher came ; dashing into , his ;.- room, ,
crying that : the building was on fire. The
principal ran to the gong, and there was a
; rush of excited children and cries of alarm
; from the teachers. V - V
â  A panic and a; stampede was imminent, 1
and in allYthe school only the drummer
boy kept his head. He saw smoke coming
through the register, and he did not think
it necessary to ask permission to leave the
room. . - ' , - " - â 'â â '-' -'

Capturing a Live Wolf.
"One Â» of the favorite sports of a Polish
conntry gentleman is to capture a wolf
alive; and as his mode of doing it is prob
ably new to many Englishmen, I will
briefly, describe it. A wolf being driven
into the open, the well-mounted horseman
pursues it, armed only with a long whip
and some rope. The wolf after a time tries
to take rest, but the rider forces it on with
his whip, till, after repeated attempts at
rest, it sinks exhausted. The rider then
springs from his horse, jumps astride the
wolf, and holding it by the ears secures it
with the rope.
: Most men require the assistance of a
mounted companion, who ties the wolf
while the other holds its ears with both
hands, and in this way the capture is com
paratively easy, but to do it single-handed
is a difficult feat. Nasty bites and even
dangerous wounds result, should the
hunter have miscalculated the strength of
the animal. No one, however, is consid
ered a perfect sportsman till he has done
this, vet many never succeed.
Of the large party assembled, only our
host, two of his stalwart brothers, and one
other man had obtained this blue ribbon
of Polish sport. "f-kX- '-'; *. 'â

DAVID B. JAMES of this City
writes The Cam. as follows re
garding a new device for navi
gating the air: In your Sunday
edition, March 1, appears, under
the heading of "Human Flight,"
an article contributed by Otto Lilleh
thall, embodying his ideas of muscu
lar flying. I will not discuss the
practicability of his theory, or the absurd
idea advanced and published of the great
Inventor Edison, of building ships and in
flate the sails with gas, and sail through
the air the same as if they were on the
ocean.
Man has wanted to fly ever since he
knew the birds navigated the air, and
many minds have given the subject great
study. So far none have solved the prob
lem farther than to go up in a balloon.
We all know that flying is not impossible,
that it is demonstrated by the flight of a
thousand different kinds of birds and in
sects that employ only mechanical means J
to overcome the action of gravitation, i
They simply understand how to do it. -; 1
Inventors so tar have not got on to the
lines that promise success, and have made
but little advance beyond the balloon.
The day will surely arrive when the air ,
will be navigable by aerial machines as !
safely as carriages are drawn through the
streets, but inventors will have to discard ,

A rocket soars into the air to a great
height and with great force. What does
it? It is simply the combustion of the
material used turned into gas as it is
lorced out of the tube as it is created, and
the expansion creates an impact against
the atmosphere while the rocket is speeded i
by a continuous recoil until the explosives
_re consumed. I suppose nearly every
one is aware that rockets are employed in
carrying lines from distressed ships to the
shore, and from the shore to ships. Think
ing over this, it has occurred to my mind
that gas exploded in a chamber
arid discharged out of a .bell
mouthed tube again the atmosphere
would propel the vessel in proportion
to the amount of gas used at each explo
sion and the surface of the atmosphere
covered b\ the mouth of the discharging
tube. We also know what great force is
exerted to expel a cannon ball of a ton
weight for miles from a cannon ; it is sim
ply the combustion of the powder into gas,
and this same force will drive balls
through plates of steel a foot thick. The
power is there, if it can be controlled and
harnessed.
My idea for an aerial machine is to have
a cigar-shaped cylinder with folding aero
planes on each side of it fastened to the
car that would cover a large surface and
open immediately, like parachutes, to pre
vent a too rapid descent and also a rudder
on the forward end of the car and the ex
ploding chamber and tube on the other, _s
per sketches of side and end views. ; No
matter how fast the machine was going
through the air it could not create any
vacuum and as it were there would always
be air for the gas to operate upon as a ful
crum, r' p-
I submit this idea for such men' as
Maxim and others that are experimenting
in this field to think over. p-' 7 p
New Rail for City Roads.
Commissioner Collisand Engineer North
of the Public Works Department of : New
York City have adopted a hew rail for the
surface railway system of the city. The
rail has already been approved by John D.
Crimmins. It differs from that now used
The New Kail- â â â¢â /,
by the Broadway and Third avenue lines
only in the height of the flanee, marked
A in the diagram, that of the new rail be
ing slightly hi-her in order to bring it to
the level of the paving stones. The ad
vantage, according to 1 General Collis.of
this rail over the side-bearing rail now in
general use is that the carve of the flange
A assists any wheel, the tire of which is
60 narrow that it can follow in the slot, to
rise out of it. The curved portion catches
the wheel and as the wheel rolls forward
acts as an inclined plane; to lift the wheel
easily and smoothly from the slot.
Oil In the Anchor.
A new sea anchor has been invented by
Michael McCarthy of Middletown, Conn.
The anchor is filled the oil: in Mich way,
that the oil is diffused over the waves as I
the anchor is tossed up and down, and so
a comparative calm is created in which
the vessel may ride out a storm in safety.
Electrical Devices on Shipboard.
Nearly all the electrical devices which
i are at present used on American vessels
j are the inventions of an American naval
J officer, Lieutenant Piske. . The latest form
! of his engine-room telegraph not only sig
i nals by dial indication such orders as
"stop, "back," etc., which are sufficient
I for the control of the engines of ships
| cruising aione, but conveys to the engi
i neers explicit directions as to the number
! of revolutions of the propelling screws (cor
i responding approximately to a certain
J speed) that is necessary if ships are to
: cruise in fleet formation, and then auto
j matically repeats back its message "and the
j fact that it has been obeyed to the sending
' station.
Another ingenious appliance is the helm
indicator, which enables the captain not
only, to inform the helmsman the exact
angle at which the rudder is to be put, but
it makes the rudder itself automatically
signal back to him the information that
the steering order has been attended to.
By means of these devices the captain of a
ship can now control both the speed and
the movements of the vessel with a rapid
ity and a decree of certainty which has
hitherto been impossible.
Still another invention of Lieutenant
| Fiske, and the latest of all, is an electrical
; arrangement for accurately measuring and
' instantly 'indicating a; ship's speed. It is
; so adjusted that an index before the com
â  manding officer's eyes shows him the speed
: of his vessel at all times. Pittsburg Dis

The hull is divided into four water-tight

The two pumps are of considerable ca
pacity ; they can be used either for lifting
or for delivering an efficient jet of water
in case of fire. Together they have a duty ;
of 800 tons for the former and 300 tons for
the latter purpose per hour. The contract j
made by the French Navy Department
with the builders specified that the main
engines should develop 000 horsepower
with a speed of 120 revolutions, and with a
steam pressure in the high-pressure cylin
der of not more than ;50 per cent. The
horsepower developed on a trial was 740.

A Useful Device.
The two- illustrations, printed herewith
show an ingenious and very simple device
invented by a man in Camden, N. J., by
which the old-style mouthpiece of the tin
speaking-tube is done away with and the
â¢tube practically converted into a telephone.
The great advantage of the device is that
one may talk into the tube and receive
the answer without changing from mouth
to ear.
One of the cuts shows the device In opera
tion. The receiver, which is fitted with a
rubber cushion for the ear, is attached to
an inner rubber tube through which the
talker receives an answer to what he may
say. In this respect it is just like the tele
phone, no change of position being neces
sary at either end or the line while the
conversation is going on.
For all interior communication the de
vice seems to be admirably adapted to its
purposes, as it is simple, cheap and free
from liability to get out of order.
CATS AND DOGS AS TEACHERS.
Kept in Menageries \ to Import Better
Manners to Lions and Tigers.
If you were to obtain entrance to James
A. Bailey's big menagerie one of these
bright winter days â privilege money can
not buyâ you would be astonished to see i
what a number of cats and dogs make
themselves at home, in the buildings which
quarter so many queer beasts from all
parts of the globe.
The dogs are of all sorts and sizes; huge
and voracious Danes and wolf hounds and
the tiniest pets. The cats are large, hand
some, bright-looking fellows, famous
mousers some of them, and have that air
ol sleek and well-fed respectability shown
only by cats of breeding who are well
treated.
"Why is it," asked a recent visitor,
"that with so many wild animals you keep
so many domestic ones? I should think
you would have ;. enough to do feeding and
caring for the former." ".' â  .
"An,' there is.where you show your ignor
ance,"^ said the attendant. >V" We wouldn't
let one of these little fellows go for a good
deal if there were; none to replace them.
The psychological effect of those animals
is a very big consideration."
"The"what?" V . '/ '
"The psychological ; effect. â¢ - Oh, you

Weighing: Common Air.
The weight of air has, often been . tested

pump. That it really has weight when so
compressed is shown by* the fact that the
weight of the vessels -is increased slightly
;by filling l them \ with compressed air and
that .';;â â¢ such ; vessels p become g specifically,

Adventures . of a Maestro. â¢
I " : Mascagm, or M. Intermezzo, as an Eng-
I lish' composer called him,, recently made a
J journey to Berlin under, great difficulties.
| He does not understand a word of Ger
man, and his torrents (of excited Italian

moved or ? heartily amused. â¢ In â¢ Munich
both M^ascagni* and , his luggage would
have been left behind save for the kindly
assistance of a kindly stranger, who acted
as interpreter and rescued him from his
difficulties.' Full of gratitude the com
i poser was about to press < a; liberal tip on
his -benefactor. who turned out to be
Prince Frederick of 'Hohenzollern. His
next adventure turned was to encounter a
Frenchman who was^-0 pleased to meet
j the maestro that he changed the plans of
i his journey just to see the composer at
| work on his new opera. As neither could
i understand the other, conversation was
out of the question. In relating Ins ad
ventures to Sir Arthur Sullivan, Mascagni
said: "Those Frenchmen was easily satis

How the Czar Bought a Picture.
,y A kind-hearted act of the Czar at a re
cent charity bazaar at the Winter Palace
has excited much comment in St. Peters
burg. On a certain. day the school-chil
dren, ' for whose ' benefit the bazaar was
held, were permitted tb r see the works of
art, and each child was presented with a
lottery ticket as a present. One of these
tickets happened to draw a valuable prize, ;
the picture of "Charity," by the French
artist . Berthier. And ; th.c happy ,. winner
was a Jittle girl belonging to one of the
poorest families in the city. The Czar j
had greatly admired the picture and made |
inquiries as to who had won it. Hearing
that it had fallen to the share of a poor
little girl in humble life, the Czar offered j
to buy it, and the sale was closed for $4000.
The money will be invested in a marriage
portion for the child, who already finds
herself an object of much juvenile atten
tion. .
Starboard and Larboard.
The words "starboard" and "larboard,''
as used in the nautical vocabulary, are
from the Italian words questa borda,
meaning "this side," ~ and quella borda,
"that side." Abbreviated, these two
phrases appear as sta borda and la borda,
and by corruption of languages were soon
rendered "larboard" and , "starboard" by
the English sailors, y Years ago an order
of the admiralty, discontinued the use of
"larboard" and substituted "port."

Electric Lights for the Microscope.
Professor H. yon Heurck has applied to
the microscope an electric light apparatus,
by the. use of which he is independent of
the time of day for his scientific investiga
tions. His system of lighting is very
effective, and .at the same" time its con
struction is inexpensive. He uses, all
told, three lamps. The 'first one, A, is
placed I above the object to be examined;
and is particularly adapted for opaque
objects.- It is attached to the objective
proper by a small ring, and cany be turned
in all directions. V. Several points at the
arm B .enable the operator to, turn 'the
light around to any desired point. The
second lamp, B,' is also a smell lamp.and
may be easily, moved. about by the sliding
frame of the microscope V upon which it
rests. The third :â  and largest J lamp, -C,
takes the place of the': ordinary reflector,
and its universal joint equally allows
adjustment at any desired point. A small
rheostat, D,' is provided, and fastened to
the base of the microscope for the purpose
of regulating the current of the electric
lights. A small switch on the stand at B
enables the operator/to turn on any or all
of the lamps at one and the same time.-

The balloon is how building at Vaugirard^

The diameter of the "Pole NordM will be

will be charged at the point of ascension
will not leak and will retain its buoyancy
until Andree and his two companions
either reach the 'pole,' or, baffled, land on
the most northerly part of the American
Continent.
A curious feature of the balloon is the
bis: guide rope of cocoanut fiber weighing
1000 kilograms, a weight sufficient to
maintain the balloon at a height of about
600 feet, at which elevation the explorers
can study the regions over which they
pass and which will enable M. Steindberg,
the photographer,- to picture tbem, ;,, ;
The expedition will start from Gothen
burg on a specially chartered steamer, the
Virgo, and will reach Northwestern Spitz
bergen in two weeks. There the explorers
will debar, and erect a temporary house,
a picture of which is presented here. In
this house" the balloon will be charged
with gas carefully made by experts. It
will require some time to make the gas
and charge the envelope, but M. Andree
expects to get away in the balloon early in
July.
The Pole Nord will carry three persons
M. Andree, who is a capable aeronaut:
Professor Gustav Ekholm, the scientific
observer, and Dr. Nils Steindberg, physi
cian and photographer. Andree does not
know how long he will be in the air before
be finds an air current that will drift him
over the pole, but he expects the Pole
Nord will be able to stay aloft three weeks
and cover a distance of 3000 miles, and the
balloon will be provisioned for that period.
This novel expedition ; is exciting the
greatest interest in scientific circles in Eu

found an inadequate protection. Admiral

of collision would flatten out and oppose a

AT HIDEN WATERS
A CALIFORNIA SKETCH
WE tumbled over them again,
for the third time that
month, . in Giiroy; yet the
moment we reached Hollis
ter those two young fellows
turned up once more.
My lady had made up her mind to rest
the horses at Hidden Waters. Well! It
was too much, to find ' that" same couple
resting al ready when we got there.
"Almost as good as an introduction,"
laughed the little chap with the curly
black poll, which phrase so tickled her
ladyship that the adopted tbem at once.
They laid themselves, literally as figur- I
atively, at her test, for it was very hot,' !
and the shade of the old peppers where we
were for the nonce - camping was grateful
to man and beast.
" 'Hidden Waters'â name sounds I
delightfully romantic," said the taller and
fairer of the two.
"Yes, but where are the waters? I do
not see any," said the curly one.
"Maybe there's a legend," said her
ladyship, with a wistful look over to her
uncle and me.
I was adamant. Her uncle fidgeted, for
he had just succeeded in making himself ;
very comfortable. Yet to Lim (as to me) i
every wish of hers was as a sacred com
mand. Only when a fellow is thrown over
for a couple of whipper-snippers never
even properly introduced, I'll be hanged if
one is going to jump up instanter, and in
the hot sun go and search for legends.
She had her punishment ready.
"Let us go and see," she said to the over
willing two. "There is a house yonder."
The taller' insisted on holding an am- j
brella to keep the sun from roasting her.
("You're not in it, my boy," whispered
her uncle, with a malicious grin.) For
the shade, she thanked so sweetly that I
could have punched his eyes out that
minute.
"Don't disturb yourself, old darling," '
she called out to her uncle as she departed,
never vouchsafing me so much as one
glance.
â¢' "All right, my lady. You will get it for |
this." 1 mentally noted, and noted. I !
guess I noted to sleep, for the next thing
noticeable hv me was a loud "hallo from
her uncle, who was on the side of the hill
across the road.
Tnen her ladyship frantically .waved for ;
me to come.
I went.
"Oh, the loveliest thing," she beamed on
me (and all her sins were wiped away that
moment.) "Here's the waters!"
"Is they ?" I inquired. *'*
"And the most beautiful watercress. We i
are going to stay with Mr. Grey for sup- !
per, she said, thus introducing the owner :
of the hidden waters and the watercress
with a smile that won the old Californian's ;
heart. "Fancy a little lake on the hill- '
fide hidden from view ! No wonder the
Indians called it Hidden Waters."
"You are fortunate, Mr. Grey, to possess !
Euch a treasure," said her uncle.
Grey was tickled with the* genuine ap- :
preciation of his natural wonder. In j
reality it was many springs which, by the i
formation of the hill, formed a lake on a
ledge on the hillside, truly, "Hidden
"Waters,'' for we had camped opposite tb it.
vet failed to s __ . it, though it was only j
hidden by being elevated above our ranee
of vision. The taller of the two fellows
was evidently a bit' of an artist, for he
made a very good and clever sketch of it j
with Grey in the foreground, and pre- I
sented it to her ladyship. She in turn I
showed it to Grey, who seemed fascinated '
with the sight of his own ' face. My lady
whispered something to the artist, upon I
which he whipped out the pad a^ain and
commenced sketching. This time my j
lady's chin was in too. Of course he had
her head, but that chin he caught the
identical aggressive pose of that chin, and
passed the picture over to Grey.
"Just to remind you we appreciate your
hospitality," said the artist. It was signed j
by a widely known name.
Â» Grey made no attempt to conceal his de
light at the charming souvenir. "Well, I
guess supper'li be 'bout ready," he said,
leading down the little trail, pointing out
where pipes were watering the blackber
ries beyond. Her ladyship, to the neglect
of the couple, not to say her uncle ana me,
*V : < Tll*_ LANDLADY COLLECTING THE RENT.
I closely followed our host of the hour, ut
: terly ignoring us all at suppertime. her
sole attention bestowed on the host and
; hostess. That worthy couple, with that
hearty, yea, loving hospitality, the like un
| known elsewhere in the world, but found
, all over California, in return plied her
i with "Sech as it is" and "The most won-"
! derfnl blackberries," until she pleaded ex
' haustion. .Y-{PQg_H-i
How loath they were for her to leave them
i "so soon," as if she and all of us were in-
I vited guests leaving too soon, instead of
: each and all nothing else but intruders.
I My lady had such rare intuition she
j always divined how good a traveler's story
| was to such of these that were martyrs to
j routine. I never knew whether she was at
â  her best baiting or landing a story. Any
way, she "harmonized," as she called it,
by going over to the parlor organ, and
commenced "Maxeltown braes : are bon
nie." Aye and aye! As she sang we all
thought lor one Annie Laurie, at least, we
could "lay us down and dee." Then came
our great surprise.
. "Sing something, Serge," said the artist
to the little fellow.
"What shall I sing?" he laughed.
"Something decent and in English," the
other answered.
"All my songs are decent," said the
curly headed one with demure accentua
tion. "Iâ"
. The taller interrupted hi* friend with
an explanation to the company, j
"He goes in for all kinds of strange
music, and if I bad not suggested differ- j
ently, like as not he would be giving us
Russian or Chinese, or some such." ' â¢
My lady nestled up to her hostess. She
knew by instinct we were going to have a
treat. (Besides bad she not argued he was
a musician, for in Giiroy he was whistling
from "The Meistersinger.") He began
only an old song, but < i
"Kathleen Mavourneen, the gray dawn
is breaking," and the pathos of that won
drous voice filled with emotion. Gradually
the room was peopledâ on the hair sofa j
her ladyship, her uncle and the hostess;
the two chairs, respectively, by the chum
and myself ; the host's sister on a camp
stool; the host himself finding a partial
seat on the little table, where in state re
posed two gorgeously bound big books.
The farmhand and a neighbor's son and
a neighbor's daughter dropped in, but re
mained standing as if glued to ' the wall.
Who could resist? Not he, the gifted fel
low. One song after another he poured
forth in that square, bare, artforsaken j
room. Urged on by his adoring chum to
yet another effort, each more beautiful |
seemingly than the last. The chum,
catching his cue from my lady's eyes:
"Tell them, Sergus," said he. "Tell them
how we plotted to see 'Tannhauser.' "
"Tell * them yourself," he answered
jovially, finding a seat on the little ocr
tagonal footstool by the fireplace.
But, by the insistence of her ladyship,
he told us of the plot.
Clive over there (nodding to the artist) j
and I have rooms together in San Fran
cisco. One month a little while ago we
had been very extravagant â spent a great
deal of money â in fact, giving a Tittle
party, and going to two or three more.
We both of us get a little money
monthly from back East; not much, but
we needn't starve.
Now we had a landlady that was a jewel.
She was a nonesuch for cleanliness. The
bouse was always full. I No wonder, for it
was neat as wax. And the food- (on the
European plan) was a thing to be con- I
tented with. Also she had a faculty of
keeping our rooms clean and sWeet with- |
out apparently disturbing either Clive 's i
painting or my music.
But on, she was a perfect terror on rent. !
To the hour, in advance, her rent must be
forthcoming, or you received your dismis
sal then and there, from which there was
no after appeal, though you offered her
double. It was her idiosyncrasy.
As she spoke slightly broken English
we often wondered of what nationality she
was.
We were together counting our resources,
wondering if it would run to a little sup
per afterward, for we were going to hear
"Tannhauser" that night. As it happened
we were both wild to see it. Accident had
ever kept us from hearing it in full, and
Clive is as Wagner-mad as I am. (My
la_y gave a patronizing little nod.)
When all at once, the same thought
came to both of us. Together we said:
"What's the day of the month? Gracious!
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 896.
It was our rent day." : No wonder Mrs.
Trapp hj-d been dusting twice, never be
fore nad the rent? been elsewhere but on
the end of the mantel on rent day. y y; V
We gasped, p We nad forgotten all about
it. Our remittance came day after to-mor
row, and $10 must be forthcoming within
the hour (we only ; rented â¢ the rooms and
furnished them ourselves).
â¢We turned out every pocket. There was
but $9 75 between us, after finding the last
60 cents of it in coins from coats and vests
and trousers in the wardrobe. It was the
sum total. When Clive, with a whoop re
membered y the stamp- There were
ten 2-centers onlyâ and oh, ye irods, a half
dozen 1-centers. Clive tore . the odd one
off, and solemnly arranged the rent on the
mantel.* But "Tannhauser!" .
We dropped into a chair like whipped
school-schiidren, as miserable as could be.
That opera we : must see. For a moment
we felt we could, to see "Tannhauser,"
defy Mrs. Trappâ dozen Mrs. Trapps. As
quickly.our bravery subsided. We knew
her too well. Clive suddenly had a bright
idea. : ; . \-' ; â ;. p.:
"Sergus, we're saved. Cannot : you sing
something softening to her, and when she
is softened we will get her to wait another
two days."
"What is her country?" I said at once,
falling into the plot, and catching at any
straw.
"She's here." said Clive. _*'. y , :

HUNTING INDIAN RELICS
Stanford History Students Ex
plore Two Mounds Near
This City.
Professor Barnes Collecting Data for
a New Record of California
Aborigines.
Professor M. Sheldon Barnes and a
party of five Stanford University students
mad? explorations yesterday of two large
Indian mounds in the vicinity of South
San Francisco.
. Both mounds are near the San Bruno
road, and one, about a half mile from the
railroad station, is nearly 20 feet hi*n and
was originally snaped something like a
peanut, the base area being over a half
acre. .During the last two years, however,
much, of the rich, loamy earth, formed
partly of : crumbled clam ' shells, has been
carted away for fertilizing purposes. The
symmetry of the aboriginal pile lias thus
been destroyed, but the excavations have
left a broad lateral surface cut perpendicu
larly down near the greater summit. â¢ The
university party, : therefore, . began work
with the heart .of the mound' almost ex
posed. ,'p y/, '.-":
>... After a very little : digging a crumbling
human skull, which afterward fell to
pieces, was found, and with it were several
of the larger bones of the Body, all very
old and brittle and showing that they had
been subjected to fire. -..'
Miss Mabel y Miller, a member of the :
party, has for two yeans ; been making a
special study of the historical aborigines of
Northern; California. It is V her ; opinion
that these Indians cremated their dead
upon the mound, afterward covering the
bodies ; with a layer of clam and ' mussel
shells. â¢"> . .-" ', ''k : -y\y:\
'â â .â ;., As a result of her personal investigations
a year ago Miss Miller , has made a map of
the northern part of the State, from Benicia
northward, locating upon it all the ancient
rancherias of the so-called "Diggers." She
has in >; preparation two . articles for the'
Scientific -Monthly of New' York .dealing
with. the Indian history of a large territory
in and north of the Sacramento Valley,
much of the data" having been collected
while ' on < a buckboara - tour a' of ; six i, weeks
last summer, during which time she trav
eled and explored entirely alone. ; ;%\i "i
V The ; extremely perishable : state of the
remains found- in the first i; mound and the'
apparent absence of other relics caused the
students to abandon the work i; in hope of
soon finding | something more ; tangible in
the second mound, a lower but . more 3 ex- a
tensive i pile on a hillside some two miles
nearer City. : But their superficial pre
liminary excavations met with little better
success, another crumbling part of a skele
ton and .pieces of a very thick skull with
well-worn ; teeth being; the principal find,
although, as in the i first mound, bits of
stone mortars were unearthed. ;.:- â -. pY
"k Yesterday's visit of ; inspection will prob
ably be followed ; by, a thorough examina
tion of the larger mound and of another
near by at ay point V called V Chinese : Camp,
where relics are said to be visible through
the squirrel holes in the mound.
For over four years Professor Barnes has
been collecting material v for a Stanford
University YY history . of y the â¢ California
Indians. Every year some of ! the students
are employed assisting in some particular
feature of the work. k-y.. kk . p '.-:
In the last three years student exploring
parties have exploited the Indian ; mounds
at Castro and near Mountain View, p From
the former : over thirty skeletons were re
moved, some of l which were placed in the
university museum. V 'â  ? â¢ - ppp
EDITOR TILLINGHAST.
An lowa '; Journalist . on the - Enormous

and Phil Armour.
; B. F. Tiilinghast, editor of ', the Daven
port (Iowa) Democrat, owned by the Rich
ardson brothers, and which position he
has held for many : years, is ; at the Occi
dental. Mr. Tillinghast has also for a
long time been connected with the Chica
go Tribune, St. Louis Globe-Democrat and
other papers as special correspondent. In
this capacity he has reported some of the
National conventions, y, He has also at
different times been a contributor to lead
ing magazines.
At the time the five ships were loaded
with food and clothing for the Russian
sufferers a few years ago Mr. Tillinghast
filled the responsible position of maKing
collections for than.. As will be remem
bered, so " spontaneous were the compli
ances with the requests that Mr. . Tilling
hast was obliged to ask, at length, in sheer
defense, that the public cease giving, for
the ships could carry no more.
Mr. Tillinghast is in California, he says,
to get a little rest after a long siege of hard
work. He thinks he will stay about three
weeks. He says as a general thing there
is prosperity throughout lowa.
"There were 300,000,000 bushels of corn
produced during the year just closed," he
said, "which is about three times what the
yield was the year before. At that time it
was so scarce that it went up to 75 cents a
bushel, and thousands on thousands of
farmers ceased to use it. They fed their
horses, cattle and hogs on wheat. Hun
dreds on hundreds of thousands of bushels
of wheat were consumed in this way.
"This year there has been such an
enormous product of corn that the cribs
extend for miles and miles along the
Northwestern, Rock Island, Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy and other- railroads.
The corn is especially plentiful along the
line' of the latter road. But there is so
much of the product that all the farmers
can get for it is 15 cents a bushel, delivered
in cribs at the railroad.
"Phil Armour has had his men out all
over the State for months buying it at
this figure, and cribbing it at the track.
He has bought up millions of bushels in
this way." â >'â¢;'
Mr. Tillinghast says ex-Governor Boies
is living quietly on his farm in Grundy
County. Some time since his daughter
diea, to whom he was much attached, and
this has affected him greatly. His wife died
some years ago, and it was this daughter
who acted as hostess at his home in the
capital. .-..,.
"Recently the ex-Governor instructed
his friends." said Mr. Tillinghast, "to on
no account allow his " name to be pre
sented for any office.. He was out of poli
tics, he said, for good. ; This especially re
ferred to the matter of. the .presentation of
his name in the National convention: : The
old Governor seems to be failing. He is
now about *7o years of age." > V'-
LITALIAS APPEAL.
A Local Newspaper . Auks the Colony's
Assistance for the Italian
Wounded.
L'ltalia, the well-known local Italian
paoer, has just opened a subscription list
for the benefit of the helpless and de
pendent relatives of the soldiers who have
been slaughtered in Abyssinia. In its ap
peal to the colony L'ltalia says:
"The number of victims has risen, ac
cording .to, reports, from 500 to 1000, from
1000 to 3000,. and f rom 3000 to 5000. The
last seems to be the authentic number.
"The families, the Y mothers, the wives
and children of these valiant ' victims will
see their loved ones i no more, and, worse
still, can no longer look to them for sup
port. Mourning for them is accompanied
by the terrible prospect of want.
"And what of the wounded?
"Their exact number is not known, but it
has been proved that they .are many and
that Â» they â  are there .awaiting help. ; Of
them and of the families of the dead it is
our duty; fellow-countrymen; to think.
"While the Italian Government thinks of
vindicating the honor of our arms philan
thropist's all over the world are more occu
pied in considering how. Ihey can aid the
wounded; the mutilated; the poor wretches
who are lying .- on comfortless v cots _ in
hastily improvised p hospitals, mangled
and shattered by bullets and lances.
"The Russians and the French are plan
ningâand they do wellâ to send aid to the
wounded Abyssinians. The Italians must
think of the Italian wounded. "The Ital
ian colony of; St. Petersburg: has already
sent 10,000 roubles to the Italian Red Cross
Society and subscription -lists have been
opened- in â  New .York and many; other
cities in the United States.
"Tne sad anxiety with which the resident

FEDERAL LAW WAS VIOLATED.
The Animals ; Were Smuggled Over
the Border and Sent East Against
the Rules.
â¢ A large trainload of cattle from Amadee,
Lassen County, was stopped at Ogden Fri
day by the United States Inspector of Ani
mals. The livestock was en route to
Chicago, and to all appearances was in
perfect condition. In spite of the evident
sound health of the cattle the entire ship
ment was placed under a ban of , quaran
tine. y' ""
The reason given was that all California
this year is quarantined on its livestock.
It seems that the Southern ' Pacific re
ceived the train at Reno irom the Reno
and .^.madee Railway, and did not know
that the cattle had crossed the â  boundary
line from Lassen County. The shippers
stole the cattle train over the border, and,
as Nevada livestock, it "was transported
eastward. At Ogden the Government in
spectors discovered that the cattle had
come from â¢ California, and as they were Y
travel in ." violation of ; quarantine and
sanitary Taws, the animals were held sub- j
ject to the order of the shippers. *
â  According to an act of : Congress for the
establishment of a Bureau of Animal In
dustry to prevent the exportation of dis
eased cattle and other food animals,
splenetic or " Southern fever exists among .
cattle, or rather is said to exist, in Cali- ;
fornia and the Southern States as follows:
All that country lying south of or below a
line beginning at the northwest corner of the- â¢
State of California, thence east, south and \
southeasterly along the boundary line of said
State of California to the southeastern corner
of said State, thence southerly along the west
ern boundary line of Arizona to the southwest
corner of Arizona, thence along the southern
boundary lines of Arizona and New Mexico to
the soutneastern corner of New Mexico, thence ;
northerly along the eastern boundary of New i
Mexico to the southern line of the State of j
Colorado, thence along the southern boundary i
lines of Colorado and Kansas to the south- I
eastern comer- of Kansas, thence southerly |
along - ; tlie western boundary line ." of j
Missouri to the southwestern corner of Mis- â¢
souri, thence easterly along the southern '.
boundary line of Missouri to the Mississippi
River, thence southeily along the Mississippi
River Jo the southern boundary line of Tennes
see, thence easterly along said boundary line
to the southwestern corner of Polk County, i
Tennessee, thence northerly along the eastern
boundary line of Tennessee to the southern j
boundary line of Virginia, thence west along |
said boundary line to the boundary line of
Kentucky" at the. western point of Virginia,
thence northerly along said boundary line to '
tne -northernmost point of Virginia, thence
southerly â â  along . said boundary line to the
northeast corner of Viginia where it joins the
southeastern corner of Maryland at the Atlan
tic Ocean.
From February 15 to . November 15 each
year no cattle are allowed to be trans
ported from this area to other parts of the
United States, except in ; disinfected cars,
by rail for immediate slaughter and under
strict quarantine conditions, one of which
is as follows : _â _&__<_
All cars carrying cattle from said area shaft [
bear placards stating that said cars contain
"southern cattle," and each of the waybills of
said shipments shall have a note upon its face
with a .similar statement. Whenever any cat- J
tle have come from said area and shall bo ro j
shipped from any point at which they have
been unloaded to other points of destination,
the cars carrying said animals shall bear simi
lar placards with like statements, and the way
bills be so stamped. At whatever point these
cattle are unloaded they must be placed in ;
separate pens, to which no other cattle shall
be admitted.
â¢California cattle: are classed under the !
comprehensive head of "southern" to con
form with this law.* The train stopped at
O^den was not so labeled, and the shipper
consequently failed of his purpose 'to get
his stock through. to Chicago. Freight of
ficials of the Southern Pacific Company
say, that the quarantine is not a matter of
much importance in this State since but a
f.Â»w trains of cattle are sent East from j
California every year.

An area of high pressure overlies the plateau re

pushing its western half southwestward and will
probably cause an area of low pressure which was
hovering over the northern coast of California to
r.ove out to sea. Decidedly colder weather has ac
companied the march of this high area, and the
conditions are favorable for frost in Southern Cal

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V.. March -Speculation
at the Stock Exchange was quiet and professional
again to-day. At the opening the market was firm
lor sugar and tobacco and weak for General Elec
tric The railway list was also inclined to weak
ness at this â  time, owing to lower cables from Lon
don/but the loss in this group was unimportant
except in the case of the Northern Pacific, which
was exceptionally heavy. The common fell from
_ :; 4 to _:, .-.nd the preferred from 15iÂ£ to 123.4.
The selling was small and by small holders who
desire to evade the payment of the heavy assess
ment, which is considered inevitable under the
plan of reorganization now being discussed by
leading bankers. > Â» . . . .
it is understood that the scheme will be given
out on Monday next. In the closing hour of busi
ness Sffgar displayed more life and advanced to
H734. he best price of the week. The advance
1.- certain classes of refined Sugar strengthened
the market for the certificates. Tobacco moved
up to 83"*-- and 826/s on buying by brokers identi
fied with inside interests. Rumors of an early re
sumption'of dividends forced timid shorts into
covering, and trie buying was partly responsible
for the improvement.
Distilling and Cattle Feeding was firm, while Gen
eral Electric was Inclined to weakness on liquida
tions and sold dawn to 36 vg. Speculation closed
firm in tone. Net changes snow gains of 14 to %
I I r cent, Sugar leading. Northern Pacific lost 11/4
percent; preferred 2% and General Electric ',Â£.

CHICAGO MARKETS.-
CHICAGO^ It.i., March After tha break
In wheat values which took place yesterday It was
natural to look for a recovery this morning. That
was one reason for the firm- tone seen in the mar
ket '..day. Another was found in the action of
Liverpool, prices at that place declining but V_d,
which was not sufficient to : fully reflect American
weakness. A goal ; business; in .covering "shorts"
was done this morning, the! bears being willing to
accept the results of their victory. "..Receipts in
the Northwest were heavy at 541 curs, against 403
la- Saturday and 327 a year. *_o. Chicago re
ceived 33 cars and Inspected out 104.4fc6 bushels.
Bradstreet's report Of exports for the week from
both coasts was â¢ disappointing,; only 2, 01,010
bushels going out. Kx|>or clearances of wlica.

some sympathy with wheat. Trading was' listless
and uninteresting. Liverpool oaMea were quiet
ana steady. Receipts, SO - -, oars, were 12 over the
estimate, and ITS,**- 3 bushels: were, withdrawn
from store. < Exports of corn from both coasts for
the week were 1,708,000 bushels. Clearances at
Atlantic ports in 24 hours just past were 307.896
bushels. May corn opened at 29~4c. sold between
29 % c and 29*j4c to 29-'*ic, closing at 29"*4 c, un
changed from yesterday.' Estimated receipts for
Monday, 500 cars.
.:: OATSâ Reflected the firmness- of wheat and
corn, and through the influence achieved a slight
gain. Receipts were 270 cars, and 10,500 bushels
were withdrawn from store. The only conspicu
ous trade .was the buying by commission houses,
their orders presumably being for the account of
shorts. May oats closed a shade over yesterday.
Estimated receipts for Monday. 270 cars.
- FLAXâ Cash, 90c; May, 901 _c Receipts were

PROVISIONSâ Recovered some of the lost
ground of the past few days this morning. There
was at times a really good business, with evi
dences of investment buying. Higher hog prices
were primarily responsible for the firmness. The
recovery, in wheat was also of an encouraging
nature to the speculative trade in product. May
pork closed 17% c higher, May lard 6C higher, and
May ribs 10 c higher.

MUST CONSIDER
THE FRANCHISE.
The Valley Road Wins a
Point in the Su
preme Court.
NO AUCTION NECESSARY
Fresno Trustees Need Not Call
for Bids on the Right
of Way.
ONE OBSTRUCTION REMOVED.
âââââ
A Victory Which Will Mean Much
in the Road's Future Pro
gress.
The Valley road has gained its point be
fore the Supreme Court. It sued to have
the Trustees of Fresno consider its appli
cation for a franchise through the town
without first putting up the franchise de
sired at auction, and the Supreme Court
has Issued the desired writ. This means
that the Fresno Trustees must consider
the bid of the Valley road without first
putting it up at open competition. . The
full text of the opinion is as follows:
This is an original proceeding, in which the
petitioner asks the issuance of a writ of man
date to the respondents commanding them to
act upon itÂ» petition for leave .to extend its
railway track through the city of Fresno and
across and along certain streets and lands of
said city. PP. *
The petitioner is a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of California, and
by its incorporation authorized and empow
ered to construct, maintain and operate a
steam railway for the transportation of passen
gers and freight from a point at or near the
bay of San Francisco, in a line generally east
erly and southeasterly, to a point at or near
the city of Bakersfield, in Kern County, a dis
tance of about 350 miles. p .-'*â¢:â  'V
The route of the road as laid out passes
through the city of Fresno, and the petitioner
has already constructed a section twenty miles
in length on such proposed route between
Stockton and Fresno. It is necessary for the
proper and successful operation of the road
that it should be constructed as laid out, and
this involves the right to-pass through the
city of 'Fresno upon a line and over and across
the streets particularly designated in an ap
plication which was by the petitioner duly
presented to the respondents. But they, in
stead of passing upon the question as to
whether the proposed route was properly lo
cated, and the application one proper to be
granted, resolved to advertise for bids for the
privilege of operating a steam railwpv over
'the route proposed, and determined that they ,
would grant said privilege to the highest bin- I
der, without regard to the question whether* !
such bidder was engaged in constructing a I
road between the same termini or not. There ;
is not, in fact, any other corporation or person .
proposing.to build such a road, or who could !
make a bona fide bid in competition with the ;
petitioner, and the award of the privilege !
sought to any other person would simply pre- j
vent the construction of the road through the â¢
city of Fresno, and to that extent defeat the
purpose for which the petitioner was incor- :
porated. ' â¢ P.. i Â»!;â 
All these facts are admitted by the respond
ents, and it is not denied that the course they
are pursuing involves a seeming absurdity;
but they hold themselves bound to that course
by the terms of an act of the Legislature, ap
proved March 23, 1893, entitled "An act pro
viding for the sale of railroad and other fran
chises in municipalities and relative to grant
ing of franchises." [Statutes 1893, p. 288.]
This act does in express terms provide that
"every franchise or privilege to erector lay
telegraph wires, to construct or operate
railroads along or upon any public street or
highway, or to exercise any other privilege
whatever hereinafter proposed , to be granted
by the Board of Supervisors, Common Council
or other governing or legislative body of any
county, city or county, city, town or district
within this State shall be granted upon the
conditions in this act provided and not other
wise," i.e.. the fact that , a franchise or privi
lege (describing it) has been asked and that it
is proposed to grant it to the highest bidder shall
be advertised, and at the expiration of the time
limited the bids must be opened and the fran
chise or privilege must be awarded to the
highest - bidder. Any member of a Board of
Supervisors or other governing body who by
his vote violates or attempts to violate any of
the provisions of the act is guilty of a misde
meanor and of malfeasance in office, for which
he may be removed from office by any court of
competent jurisdiction.
It cannot be denied that the language of
this act is broad enough to Include the fran
chise and privilege which the petitioner
seeks, but a statute will not always be held to
include every case which ifalls witnin its
literal terms. The penalty of death de
nounced against any person who draws blood
in the street is not incurred by a surgeon who
bleeds one who has fallen In a fit, and so gen
erally the law will not be so applied as to work
a palpable-absurdity.- The word railroad is
certainly broad enough to cover a steam rail
road, and the privilege of laying and oper
ating a steam railroad through a city is clearly
Included in "any privilege," but at the
same time if it is perfectly evident
from . the whole tenor of this .act, and
other acts in pari materia, that the Legisla
ture could not have intended the conse
quences of a literal 'construction of the lan
â¢ guage above quoted such a, construction can
not obtain. '
It is the policy of the State to encourage the
building of railroads, and a corporation com
plying with the statutory prerequisites acquires
among other things the right to construct and
| operate its road between the termini named in
its articles of corporation. - In the exercise of
this right it may pass through cities and towns
along Us route, if they are willing to grant the
privilege. Generally it is to the interest of the
inhabitants of such towns - and cities, as well
as of the railroad : company, to have- the road
pass through the corporate limits, and it is not
to' be supposed that the Legislature intended
to make it impracticable, if not impossible,
for the. builders of the road and the governing
bodies of the cities and towns along the route
to promote their mutual interests in this way.
But if this law* to be enforced in- a literal
sense such must be the result. . When a rail
road is constructed to the boundaries of a town
or city the corporate authorities may be as de
sirous as the builders of . the road to have it
pass through on its selected route, but their
hands are tied. They cannot grant the privi
lege to any but the highest, and the highest
bidder may be some one who merely desires to
prevent the road from passing through, and
who cannot make any use of the franchise ex
cept for that purpose. In fact, the franchise
sought is not the subject of competition.
A particular railroad company desires per
mission to construct its road through the town,
or in other words, to make a connection through
the town of those portions of its road extend
ing upon either side of the town to its opposite
' termini. In the nature of things there can be
no competition for this privilege. The build
ers of the road must own and operate the
whole line, the right to do so is part of its
corporate franchise, and how is it possible that
any other person or corporation can acquire
the rignt to construct and own and operate as
a distinct and independent road and franchise
that part of the road necessary to connect its
two ends? This law was not intended to apply
to such a case,. but only to those casesâ as of
street railroadsâ which bona fide competi
tion is possible. . . * , .
It follows that when the application of peti
tioner was presented it was the duty of re
spondents to consider and act upon it without
subjecting the petitioner, or themselves to a
condition which -might .preclude them in the
exercise of a proper discretion from granting
the privilege sought. , It is ordered that a per
emptory writ of mandate issue commanding
the respondents to act upon the application of
petitioner; without reference to j any bids for
the privilege sought and to grant or deny it
according to its merits. Beatty, C. J.

A Wise Judge. .kk".
A curious judgment was pronounced
the other day by a judge in a court of law
at Volisso,,in the island of Scio.- An action
for damages was brought by two persons
against the local railway company for
losses sustained by a collision. It ap
peared that a man had lost an arm and a
young woman had lost her husband. The
judge, a Greek, assessed the damage thus:
He gave 6000 piasters to the man for the
loss of his arm and 2000 to the woman for
the loss of her husband. .At .this there
were loud murmurings, whereupon the
judge gave his reasons in these terms:
"My dear people, my verdict must remain,
for you will see it is a just one. Poor
Nikola has lost his arm and nothing on
earth can restore that priceless limb. But
you (turning to the woman)â you are still
young and -pretty. You have now some
money, you, will easily find another hus
band, who possibly may be as good asâ
perhaps better thanâ your dead lord.
That is my verdict, my people, and so it
must go forth." So saying the judge left
the hall. The people cheered . him and
congratulated themselves on having such a
judge. ' -;â â .'â 'â .'â  'rk'k^:k:rk

Fisher Says the Action of the Com

908 Broadway, March 14. [
' The Alameda County delegation of the
Third District Congressional committee
held a lively meeting to-night that was
succeeded by some lively demonstrations
in the lobby. By a vote of five to one the
deadlock was broken, arid the delegates to
the State Convention will be named by the
committeemen of the various : Aasemby
Districts, and no primaries will be ordered.
The meeting opened with all the six
mem present. E. â¢K. Taylor's ' first
motion to order primaries met with the
same vote as at the last two ; meet
ings. Senator Earl arid George Morrow
voted with Taylor and C. Long, W. Mor
rison and C. L. Ingler voted against him.
Morrow then offered a resolution provid
ing that as there was a deadlock with no
possibility of it being broken the delegate
be nominated by petitions containing not
less than the [ names of â¢ 100 : Republicans.
The county State Committeemen were
then to select the delegates. This was de
feated by the same vote.
Morrow and Earl then retired for a few
minutes, and while they were away a
powerful delegation from the Second Ward
arrived with a resolution, which they had
just passed, approving of the stand taken
by Earl, Morrow and Taylor for pri
maries, and demanding â < that primaries be
ordered. After the reading of .the resolu
tion, Long offered a motion that the selec
tion of delegates be made by the committee
of each Assembly district, and that the
responsibility for â¢ the selection rest upon
the committeemen. V An argument fol
lowed, during which Earl and Morrow ex
changed some sharp passages. When a
vote v was taken . EarlY was the only oppo
nent. He explained that \he ; was more
than' ever convinced that the people at
large desired primaries and was in favor of
doing their will. ' Pr '.r-:;
â  There was much: indignation expressed
anion: the ,. big. lobby, and some bold
threats were made. .-'. ; Dr. Carpenter; said
that if the Third â¢ Congressional V District
Committee accepted the recommendation
of . ' _ the Alameda: County V members the

and the fight would be carried to the con

stated that the doings of the committee
would disrupt the party as fit; had done in

i Henry I. Kowalsky is the latest claimant

wants $60,000 for legal services, and he has
commenced suit to get it. â¢ V V V --. â 
He is suing ! Mrs. Kate C. Byrnes, form

Henry/ Mohr, Samuel G. Murphy, A.

> In iWi, the complaint state*, when Mrs. j
Hinckley was still, Florence Blythe, she
entered into an agreement with Mrs. Kate
C. Perry, â  afterward â  Mrs. Byrnes, % by ' the
terms of which Mrs. Perry was to receive
10 per cent of | whatever amount Florence
should get from the estate, provided, how
ever, that Mrs. Perry should not get more
than $500,000. This agreement was made
in consideration of -the; fact that Mrs.
Perry had : cared t; for Florence ; ;. since her
childhood and had paid â¢ for her support
and education. Henry I. Kowalskv was
a witness to i the 1 agreement, which was
dated March 12/1892.
It further appears from vKowalsky's ver
sion of ' the case that "in consideration of
the professional services rendered by
Henry I. Kowalsky in the Blvthe litiga
tion," Mrs. Perry, on March 30, > 1892,
turned over to him $45,000 of her prospec
tive 10 per cent, and on the same day she
gave him $15,000 more of her claim.
It is alleged that Mrs. Hinckley is willing
to pay over the amount of the claims, but
Mrs. Byrnes has notified her not to do so,
as the agreements under which they; are
demanded are "k invalid.- The complaint
asks that the amount 1 due' Mrs. Byrnes
from Mrs. Hinckley be determined, and
that the $60,000 claimed to be* due the
plaintiff be made a -first lien on Mrs.
Byrnes' claim, and that Mrs. Hinckley be
compelled to pay the same.
