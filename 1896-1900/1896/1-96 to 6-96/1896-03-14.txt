NEW LIGHT SHED
ON THE DISPUTE
Venezuela Sends Important
Information to the
Commission.
TACTICS OF THE BRITISH
Daring Attempts to Grab the
Gold Fields of Invaded
Territory.
PEOTEST AGAINST USURPATION
At One Time It Was Feared That
England Would S^ize the En
tire Orinoco River.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13. -The
Venezuelan Commission, at its regular
meeting to-day with all the members pres
ent, virtually reached the conclusion that
the main points at issue in the dispute
hinged on documents lying in the royal
archives of Spain and Holland, and per
haps some other countries, and that
while such documents would probably be
quoted by each of the disputants in sup
port of the contradictory claims presented,
the duty would devolve on the commis
sion not only to verify by actual exainina
tfon all such citations, but. if practicable,
to develop contemporary documents which
might throw strong side lights upon the
evidence submitted.
While definite action was postponed
until the full British and Venezuelan case
shall have been formally brought under
consideration, there remains no doubt that
some of ihe commissioners, or, at ail
events the secretary of the commission,
Mr. Mallet-Prevost, and agents under his
direction, will soon be sent to Madrid and
The U&gaÂ«.
It is explained that this determination is
nut due to the alleged di covery of mis
quotations in decrees and treaties already
in the commission's possession, but from
the conviction that the final decision of
the commission ought not to be open to
any attack as to inconclusiveness of the
pivotal evidence upon which such decision
will in all probability be found to depend.
In the preliminary investigations of the
commissioners they have been confronted
with numerous diametrically conflicting
..-.Mid translations. While geograph
ical discrepancies are within the power of
-the commission to harmonize through the
tiiiormous mass of corroborative charts it
commands, comparatively indecipherable
and partial illegibility of royal decrees are
thought to be matters which necessitate
personal and expert examination.
The commission expects to be in pos
i of the British Blue Book as well as
the greater part ot Venezuela's case early
next w< ek, and in view of this anticipation
Coudert and Oilman, who have hitherto
spent little time in Washington, will re
main here for the present for daily meet
ings, at -which the weighing and com
parison of evidence will be prosecuted con
tinuously. No one of the commissioners
has yet hcd an opportunity to carefully ex
amine the British case, as the only avail
able copy that has reached them was one
of the advance edition sent by Embass.ador
Bayard to the State Department, which
may contain typographical or other errors
incident to hasty prepaiation. The regu
lar copies for the commission will arrive
here, in all probability, to-morrow even
ing or Monday next. While access to a
State Department copy ha 3 been allowed,
there has been no opportunity to examine
it fully.
The agents of Venezuela have presented
to the Venezuelan Commission, among
other documents, the official report of the
Minister of the Interior at Carat as to the
Minister of Foreign Relations, dated May
23. 1960, consisting of forty printed pagi-s,
(> v< ring the radical advances of the Brit
ish colonial officers into the disputed ter
ritory following the rich discoveries of gold
from 1885 to 1890, as investigated by a na
tional committee appointed by Venezuela
to make a scientific exploring expedition
in Guiana territory. The elaborate report
of this commission is now forthe first time
di.sclosed, and shows, according to the tes
timony of the British magistrates and
others in the territory, that as late as 1883
no British settlements existed even as far
west as the Pomaroon River.
As iate as 1888 the settlements are re
ferred to by the English as the '-lecently
acquired district," and the colonial Gov
ernment is shown tobeeierting its author
ity in every way to rush emigrants into
the interior, its success in some degree
being shown by these figures of gold ex
j.oris: 1885, 939 ounces; 1886, 6518 ounces;
1887, 11, 90*3 ounces; 1888, 14,510 ounces; and
for tne first six months of 1889, 14,424
ounceÂ«.
These documents, and especially those
relating to Venezuela's formal protest
against the usurpation, seem to place Vis
count Geoimanston, Governor of British
Guiana, in the light of suppiessing the
tacts, although it is shown that he was in
constant communication with Lord Salis
bury. Testimony is adduced to demon
strate that the British authorities were
most generous to the Indians, thereby
securing access to the gold districts in the
interior deserted by Venezue'ans.who were
attracted by British b'amd is-hnients to the
coast settlements.
The publication has been submitted
without argument, Venezuela relying alto
gether upon the simple statement of
fiicts. It appears from the Venezuelan
official report of the Guiana-boundary d.is
].ute that the expedition was sent out be
cause Venezuela became alarmei lest the
British should attempt to seize te entire
Orinoco River and prevent the republic
Irom using it in anyway. The c ief ex
ecutive of the commission, R. F. Zeigas,
formerly Venezuelan Minister to England,
found everything to confirm the most seri
ous fears of his Government, and only
through his energetic protests to the colo
nial Governor and the activity of Vene
zuelan Ministers abroad was the policy of
The San Francisco Call.
the boundary extension temporarily
lowed to rest by Lord Salisbury.
"IT IS VXWAitItAXTABLE."
The Demand That Knalund Jlust Arbi-
trate the JHtpute.
LONDON, England, March 13.â The St.
James Gazette says that the Venezuelan
dispute will not be settled until the United
States no longer insists that we must
arbitrate before it upon terms fixed by
itself. The more quickly the British and
American nations understand that this
demand is unwarrantable the greater like
lihood there will be of a settlement upon
other lines than the ignominous retreat of
Great Britain.
DOUBTS NANSEN'S SUCCESS.
Antarctic Explorer Borchgrevink Will Seek
the South Magnetic Pole Next
September.
WASAINGTON, D. C, March 13.â C. E.
Borchgrcvink, the ijTorwegian Antarctic
explorer, who arrived here to-day, doubts
the success of Nansen as reported recently.
He knew Nanseo as a boy; they grew up
together in Christiania and attended the
same schools. He says of the report from
Siberia:
"I do not regard it as probable, coming
as fhe news does iji the dead of winter. I
am not at all certain that he followed the
currents as indicated, because of my
knowledge that Nansen did not place
credence in the drift theory himself. In a
private letter, just before his expedition
sailed, he expressed doubts as to that
course, and said it was hut a faint theory."
Mr. Borchgrevink announces that he
himself proposes to start from England in
September next on an expedition to dis
cover the south magnetic pole, from which
he anticipates incalculable benefit to
science.
HARRISON IN THE MIDST.
The Ex-President Had Difficulty in Extricat
ing Himself From Fighting
Students.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 13.â
During the oratorical contest to-nicht the
Butler students hung outn piece of canvas
with a woman caricatured upon it, and
beneath it the words: "Earlham-Humilia
tion."
The Earlham struJcrts construed this
into a reflection upon Miss Gertrude Sim
mons, the Indian maiden who represented
that institution, and hisses were hearo!
from all parts of the opera-house. A few
moments later an umbrella fell from the
upper boxes to the floor, and the Butler
students tried to recover it. Tlie Earlham
students made a rush for it. and a fight
ensued in which some fifty engaged, and
which was stopped only when a detail of
police arrived. Ex-President Harrison
was in the midst of the struggling mass of
humanity, but finally extricated himself
and left the scene.
MOB VIOLENCE FEARED.
The Lcuisville Legion Ready to Protect the
Suspected Murderers of Pearl
Bryan,
LOUISVILLE, March 13.â The Louis
ville Legion is now holding itself in readi
ness to be ordered to Covington at any
time. Colonel Castleman yesterday re
ceived orders from headquarters to get

been most confidential.
The object is to prevent mob violence to
the murderers of Pearl Bryan should any
be attempted. Jackson and Walling are
to be tried in Cincinnati to-morrow and
there is apprehension of trouble on account
of the strong feeling existing in Covington
and Newport.
Llxcitetnent is running high among the
Legion boys and the army to-nignt pre
sents a very warlike appearance.

urer of the lowa Pharmacy
Commission.
DES MOINES, lowa, March 13.â S. J.
Spaulding. secretary and treasurer of the
State Commission of Pharmacy, w.ns ar
rested to-day for embezzlement. He has
custody of fees collected by the board and
for some time has beer, suspected of
irregularities.
It was impossible to get absolute proof,
and nobody had access to his bankbook. It
was learned that he had lost large amounts
on the Chicago Board of Trade, and to-day
the commission flatly accused him of los
ing the money. He confessed and states
he has lost about $15,000 of fees and $6800
of his own money. YVhen taken into court
and asked if he desired to give bonds, he
said be did not, as lie was unwilling to go
abroad again in ihe community. He went

Gomez and Maceo Are Not
Ready for a Big
Battle.
EVADE AN ENGAGEMENT
Roving Bands of Insurgents Con

MINOR VICTORIES ARE WON.
Some News From the Disturbed Island
That Did Not Come Through
a Censor's Hands.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 13. âGomez,
the rebel commander-in-chief, was re
ported near Jovelianos, province of Matan
zas, yesterday. Maceo has entered the
province of Havana. He is said to have a
strong force, but refused an engage mentÂ»vith
the combined columns of Vicuna Burnal,
Inclan, Prats, Tort, Molina and Alamanza.
A battalion is now in active pursuit of
him.
All of the 17,000 additional troops sent
from Spain since the middle of February
have arrived and been equipped for service.
Most of them are now in the field. Some
6000 are being held in Havana and its
outskirts aa a precaution against disturb
ances in the city. The new troops were
better than the average sent from Spain
and should give a good account of them
selves.
Nine important towns hare been laid m
ruins, tobacco-houses have been burned
and a large portion of the great tobacco
district is a waste. -
Gomez has been in Mantanzas province
alK>ut two weeks, and Maceo has also been
there during the past week. Witn their
two columns aggregating 12,000, and the
column of Lacret and others, they have
effectively prevented owners of sugar es
tates from obeying the order of General
Weyler to begin grind lug. '
Cane has been burned from one end of
the province to the other, but buildings
and machinery have not "been harmed, so
far as can be learned. The outlook for any
more grinding in Matanzas and Havana
pr vinces is not bright. In addition to
burning cane, many railroad culverts and
bridges have been totally destroyed, dyna
mite being used in some cases.
Half a dozen columns of troops are hav
ing aniJy skirmishes with the rear guards
or outposts of Gomez and Maceo. By the
time a sufficient force of Government
troops is brought up to make an effective
attack, the insurgents, being all mounted,
move on. Tney apparently have sufficient
ammunition for these skirmishes, but have
not enough to make a decided stand.
There is no qnestion that if rifles anu am
munition are landed in any quantity there
will be many more men in the field, and
hot tights will follow almost immediately.
VICTORIES OF IJSSUKO&STS.
Some Xeu>Â» That - Escaped <- the I'm*
- ' â¢ ' â¢â¢ Censor* Supervision. :'â ' ; :
; KEY WEST, Fla., March ! 13.â Private
advices receive*! in this city by the steamer
, Olivette ; irom Havana, dated March 10, at
General Aguirre's headquarters, report a
battle at the town of Jiguiabo, in which
the rebels defeated a detachment of
Spanish troop's, capturing all their arms
and ammunition.
. The insurgents, under the command of
Major Paul Arrango, captured the town of
San Antonio de Rio Blanco, half a milo
from the city of JanVco, which was guarded
by a detach men; of A SÂ§AÂ«iah volunteers.
At |th c \ approach of the" < insurgents the
volunteers sent a commission to the insur
gent leader, offering i, to : surrender. -. They
delivered about eighty rifles', and '.â ;â  2000
rounds of ammunition, and twenty volun
teers deserted and followed the insurgents.
Arrango went in the direction* of the Ovi
deo plantation. There they were ambushed
by 300 Spanish troops. They charged the
troops, dislodged them and drove thcru in
great disorder from the field. The troops
left twenty dead and the insurgents lost six
killed and two wounded.
From Ovi^eo plantation the insurgents
went in the direction of Campos de
Florida, where they met a train carrying
500 troops. They wrecked the train and de
feated the troops, killing many and cap
turing a lot of arms and ammunition.
Jose Azoui and 127 other Cuban sympa
thizers have been transferred to Morro
Castle dungeons, where their sufferings are
something terrible. They are fed on bread
and water, and are compelled to sleep on
the damp eround amid a lot of tilth.
On the 10th inst., six small Cuban boys
were met on the public road by a detach
ment of Spanish troops, who fired on the
boys, killing them.
At Palraos de Pedroso the Spanish troops
entered the town, killing everybody in
sight. It is said fifteen persons were shot,
and among the killed was a man named
Perdomo, an American citizen.
CONSIDER EH BY CLEFEIjAXn.
The I' resident Giving Attention to Affairs
in Vubn.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 13.â The
President is known to be giving much
attention to the situation in Cuba. So far
as can be learned nothing definite has yet
been the outcome of his consideration.
Rumors that an investigating committee
or an army officer has been or will be sent
to Cuba does not find corroboration
among well-informed officials. Several
army officers have applied for leave of ab
sence with permission to go to Cuba, but
the permission asked for was refused.
While it is not believed at the War De
partment that any of the officers who
made such application desired to take
part in the present hostilities it was
deemed best to keep them away from
Havana.
It is obviously im^. i. ]f that any
American army officer should have vitited
Cuba under present condition? without his
presence being promptly reported.
It is aiso learned tbat permission to go
to Bermuda and other British fortified
ports near the United States coast has
been refused to United States army officers
since Mr. Clevelapd's Venezuelan message
was sent to Congress. The reason for this
is obvious. American officers must be
held in distrust as persons seeking infor
mation about the British forti heat ions,
and the AVar Department did not propose
to take any chances.
A HUX oir "BLVK JAY."
Canted Oreat Exritetnent in the Colorado
Mining Exchange.
DENVER, Colo., March 13.â A run on
Blue Jay caused intense excitement on the
Colorado Mining Exchange to-day and
over half a million shares were sold at
prices from 6 t0 29 cents. It is reported to
night that but lilt c stock has been issued
and some of the orokers will have diffi
culty in making settlements. The excite
ment was due to a report of a great strike
on the property. Later in the day a report
was afloat that officers in the Blue Jay
Company had combined to raise the price
so as to secure money to meet payments
due next week. For a mouth the mining
stock market has been lifeless, but to-day's
excitement has set the speculators crazy.
A livelier time is predicted lor to-morrow.
MOVES FLASHED
UNDER THE OCEAN
Opening of the Greatest
Chess Tournament
on Record.
EXPERTS ARE PITTED.
Games Played Simultaneously at
Brooklyn and London for
the Championship.
AMERICANS EXPECTED TO WIN
On Both Sides of the Atlantic Many
Persons Watch the Prelimi
nary Battle.
LONDON, Enq., March 13.â The British
team which did duty in the international
ches3 match between the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland on the one
side and the United States of America on
the other, conducted their games in the
Pillar Hall of the Cannon-street Hotel in
this city to-day. The affair created the
greatest interest and no end of enthusi
asm. At about 2 o'clock the hall began to
fill with the most notable persons known
in metropolitan chess circles, the arrange
ments being supervised by Sir George
Newnes, the president of the British Chess
Club. Among those present were the
president of the City Chess Club, a good
many officials of the Metropolitan, Bo
hemian, St. George's and other chess clubs.
A friendly greeting sent over by the
American team from the Brooklyn Chess
Club was very cordially received and
caused much applauding when read by
Sir George Newnes to a brilliant assem
blage of chess experts. Sir George also
announced that owing to the indisposi
tion of the British player, O. E. Jones, E.
M. Jackson had to take his place on the
team. Before the beginning of the match
the general opinion prevailing here was
that the American team was decidedly
stronger than the British.
In the course of the play the opinion
about the strength of the American team
and the expectation of an American vic
tory was borne out by the positions arrived
at in several of the games. The admira
tion for Showalter's brilliant and dashing
attack in his game against Burn was gen
erally shown and no end of flattering re
marks were made by the spectators about
the Kentuckian.
Pillsbury, too, had Blackburn at his
mercy. anÂ«.i Gunsberg, who was one of
those present, remarked to some other
bystanders that Pilhbury had an easy win
by playing 19 11 x B Ch. The spectators
were more surprised when Pillsbury later
on played 26 X r B 7, losing thereby a most
valuable piece, and general regret pre
vailed at the accident. Jackson' splay was
very much appreciated by his many
friends, but speaking generally the British
ers found it very hard work indeed to cope
with the American players, and they were
rather glad when time was called, half an
hour earlier than originally agreed upon.
Among the numerous spt ctators was the
Lord Chief Justice.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 13.â The
international chess match which opened
to-day between the United Kingdom of
GreaJ Britain and Ireland against an
American team, a contest which was
played on eight boards, the moves being
forwarded between this and the British
end by cable, the length of the wire being
3483 miles, was the biggest chess spectacle
ever known in this country. The hand
some and beautifully decorated hall in
the Bank building at Court and Remsen
streets, Brooklyn, was the scene of action
in this country. Over 1500 spectators, in
cluding an extraordinarily large number
of ladies, were present during the fight.
While the players were placed on a large
platform, with their boards and men
placed on tables in front of them, the
moves made on these boards were repeated
on very large boards which were sus
pended on the walls of the hall, and
every spectator present had a chance of
seeing the game at every stage during the
progress of the fight.
Most interest was centered in the games
played by Pillsbury and Sbowalter. It is
a pity that Pillsbury threw away his
chances of winning when he had the vic
tory within easy grasp. Showalter, how
ever, is surely going to win his pame to
morrow when play will be resumed.
After players had been paired and after
it had been ascertained which players
would have to conduct the white and which
of them the black pieces play commenced
at about 10 o'clock and was continued until
6:30, with an hour's interval between 2 and
3 o'clock.
The details of the play:
First tableâ Pillsbury (A) against Blackburn
(B); Queen's gambit, 35 moves. Pillsbury got
the best of the game In the opeuiug aud middle
game, but for an ill-considered move he might
have won straight cut. As it was he had to
give up a piece and he will brobably lose to
morrow.
Second tableâ Burn (B) vs. Showalter (A),
Queen's gambit declined, 35 moves. Showalter
excelled in this game by brilliant and dashing
tactics, and, barring accident, he will win to
morrow, i
Third tableâ Burille (A) vs. Bird (B), Ph Q4
opening, 40 moves. This was a pretty game
and full of interest because of Bird's irregular
style of play. At the call of time the game
looked even. Â»
Fourth tableâ Tinsley (B.) vs. Barry (A.)
Queen's gambit declined, 29 moves. This game
was evenly conducted throughout, the po
sitions being equal at adjournment to-night.
Fifth tableâ Hymes (A.) vs. Locock (B.), Ruy
"Lopez, 32 moves. At first Locock had the ad
vantage, then Hymes gained in position, and
honors stood easy to-night.
Sixth tableâ Mills (13.) vs. Hodges (A.), Ruy
Lopez, 34 moves. This was a pretty and even
fight all along the game, neither side being
able to claim an advantage at the adjourn
ment.
Seventh tableâ Delmar (A.) vs. Atkinson (B).
PQ 4 opening, 33 moves. These play
ers conducted this game very cleverly and in
spite of repeated trials neither side could make
much impressions and so things stood at the
adjournment.
Kizhth table â Jackson (B.) vs. Baird (A.),
Guioao piano, 30 moves. Jackson's bril
liant play will probably carry victory in this
game to be resumed to-morrow for Baird's
chnnce looked hopeless to-day.
Play will be resumed to-morrow at 10
o'clock to be continued until 7 p. m., when
the games left unfinished will be adju
dicated.
DIED FROM A BROKE* HEART.
Sad Circumstances Connected With the
Demise of a Voted Hector in
New Jersey.
LONG BEACH, N. J., March 13.â The
sudden death Wednesday night of the
Rev. Dr. E. D. Tompkins, for the last
Twenty-live years rector of St. James Prot
estant Episeopel Church, was a great
shock to the com inanity.
The circumstances surrounding his
death are extremely sad. L<atoly he had
noticed a marked change in the de
meanor of his parishioners toward him.
Last Sunday morning when he appeared
in the church not a single worshiper was
in the church. This was too much for him,
and returning to the parsonage he wrote
out his resignation. He then took to his
bed, where he remained until his death.
It is given out that death resulted from
nervous prostration, but it is generally be
lieved that he died from a broken heart.
Outside of his immediat^parish he was be
loved by the entire community, and the
people are still at a loss to understand the
cause of the sudden affront put on him,
except it be his tendency to the high
church form of worship, which to some of
the members appeared objectionable.
INDEPENDENCE OFFERED
England Ready to Relinquish
Suzerainty Over the
Transvaal.
Kruger, However, Must First Redress
the Grievances of the UitÂ« <
landers.
LONDON, Eng., March 13.â The Times
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, say
ing that President Kruger is considering
an important dispatch which he received
through Sir Hercules Robinson, the British
High Commissioner in South Africa, in
which Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, the
British Colonial Secretary, suggests the
abrogation of the Anglo-Boer convention
of 1884 which gives suzerainty to Great
Britain if the Transvaal will redress the
grievances of the Uitlanders and enfran
chise the British subjects in the Transvaal
who desire to become burghers.
Mr. Chamberlain al~o suggested a treaty
of amity, by the terms of which Great
Britain will guarantee the independence
of the Transvaal.
President Kruger has intimated that he
â will reply to the dispatch in about three
days. The dbpatch adds that the prepara
tions that have been made for Preident
Kruger's visit to England indicate that he
will probably start very shortly.

OVERTURES ONLY TO GAIN TIME
Another Great War in the Soudan
May Grow Out of the Anglo-

ROME, Italy, March 13.â Official con
firmation has been received of the rumor
that negotiations were in progress to bring
about peace between Italy and Abyssinia.
Tne news has given general satisfaction,
for tne great mass of the people have been
opposed to the war, especially when there
were prospects that reserves would bÂ«*
called out to serve in Abvssiuia.
Ever since this action seemed probable
men who were liable for military service
have been fleeing from Italy. The rail
roads into France have been loaded down
witii refugees. And this flight to avoid
service in the army, instead of diminish
ing, has been increasing uitil it is about
reaching the point of a panic.
News was received to-day that the whole
garrison at Verona has deserted and has
crossed the Austrian border into Tyrol,
tnking their arms with them. Hundreds
of Italian deserters are crossing the Aus
trim border every day.
The news from Africa continues dis
heartening. The Abyssinian King
threatens the Italian garrison at Adigrat
with annihilation, and the situation is al
most equally dangerous further north, in
the neighborhood of Kassaia. The Der
vishes are closing in on that town in large
numbers.
News was received to-day by the Gov
ernment authorities of another Italian
defeat. A large force of Dervishes attacked
Sabdevali, a small place between Adisrat
and Kassala. The Italian garrison, greatly
outnumbered, was driven from the place
and retreated to the hil!s. The loaa on.
each side is unknown, but it is believed to
be considerable.
Major fealca, who went into the AbysÂ«
sinian army for the purpose of asking per
mission of Kine Menelik to bury the bod
ies of the Italian soldiers killed in the bat
tle of Adowa, has announced that he has
entered into negotiations with the King
for the conclusion of peace.
Accordine to the Italian Militaire, King
Menelik offers in the peace negotiations as
much as Italy could have hoped for before
the battle of Adowa.
DEVEA TED CHIE F ALiy URIX.
Conflicting Stories Concerning the At
tack Upon Sabderati.
LONDON, Eng., March 13.â The Rome
correspondent of the Central News tele
graphs that information has been re
ceived by the Italian Government that a
strong force of Dervishes has made an at
tack upon Sabdevali, between Kas.sala and
Adigrat. The Italian force, beine greatly
outnumbered, retreated to the hills. The
losses of either side are not known.
The Post will to-morrow publish a dis
patch from Home saying that the report
that Dervishe% had attacked Sabdevali is
inaccurate. The Dervishes defeated Chief
Alinurin, an Italian ally, and not to
Italians themselves. A hundred of the
latter re-enforced Chief Alinurin and
enabled him to maintain communication,

A.\GL O - EG YPIIA X EXPEDITION.
It May Lead Vp to Another Great Sou
dan War.
LONDON, Exc. March 13.â The Anglo-
F.pyptian expedition that is to make a
demonstration toward Berber and Wady
Haifa, in favor of the Italians at Kassala,
is much discussed in the lobbies of the
House of Commons.
In an interview, Sir Charles Dilke, M. P.,
who is an acknowledged authority on for
eign affairs, denounced the decision of the
Government to join the expedition. He
said that if the affair should result in a de
feat, Groat Britain would be compelled to
immediately intervene on a large scale,
and it would possibly lead to another Sou
dan war.
The Times to-morrow will publish a dis
patch from Cairo saying that the ultimate
object of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition
to the Soudan is undoubtedly for the relief
of Kassala, wnicb, if it should be captured
bj the Dervishes, would become a serious
menace to Suakim and Tokar. Possession
of the fertile province of Dongola is es
sential to the protection of Egypt from
Dervish raids, inasmuch as besides being
a convenient base for hostile operations, it
furnishes large food supplies to the Soudan
countries ruled by the Khalifa. The
writer of the dispatch hints at a final ad
vance to Omdurman and a re-conquest of
the Soudan.

MANY VETERANS EXPECTED
There Is a Promise of a Large
Attendance at the Grand
Army Encampment.
Railroads Have Been Compelled to
Make Concessions in the
Rates.
CHICAGO,^ 111., March 13.â There is
now no doubt of the success of the Na
.tional encampment of the Grand Army in
Bt. Paul the first week of September from
the standpoint, of attendance. The rail
roads which run to the Twin Cities have
surrendered to the survivors of the Union
army on the question of the return limit
of thirty days on the tickets, which was
the only bone of contention between the
railroads, the citizens' committee of St.
Paul and the Grand Army executive.
This change came about at the meeting
of the Western Passenger Association in
St. Louis this week. The passenger offi
cials did not formally grant the concession
â which the Great Western and Wisconsin
Central roads had previously given, deem
ing the establishment of such a precedent
detrimental to their future interests, but
half a dozen of the lines in the Eastern
committee of the association applied to
Chairman Caldwell for relief from the ad
verse action of the association in Chicago.
With this wholesale desertion from the
stubborn stand taken by the Western
trunk lines, the chairman was compelled
not only to put the roads applying for re
lief on the same footing as the three who
had taken independent action, but he gave
all the members of the association permis
sion to take independent action, which
means submission to the terms dictated by
the G. A. R. and citizens of St. Paul.
GOING INTO THE BIG BASIN.
All the Arrangements Complete for Dock
ing the Warship Indiana at
Beaufort.
BEAUFORT, S. C. March 13. â The
docking of the great warship Indiana at
the adjacent Port Royal Basin has been
anxiously looked for here and by the
people of the entire South Atlantic Coast.
The railways worked up lal|fe excursions,
and there was quite an invasion of visitors
to see the docking of the noted vessel.
The Indiana had quite a rough time of it
down from Hampton Roads, encounter
ing a gale and heavy southwest winds. The
hatches leaked a bit from the firing of the
heavy guns fore and aft for the board of
inspectors.
Captain Evans is deligfited with the
trip thus far. The Indiana is drawing
24:3 feet, and had she been drawing 29
feet she could have come in as well. If
nothing unfavorable occurs and the west-
erly winds are not too high the docking
will occur in the morning in the high tide
at 9 o'clock. The authorities of the naval
station and the dock officers are confident
there will not be the slightest trouble in
docking the vessel and giving her bottom
the first cleaning it has received since she
has left the Cramps' shipyards.
The Government Coast Survey boat,
Blake, is now in Port Koyal Bay to see
whether there have been any changes in
the course of the channels since the last
survey. If the Indiana goes in the dock
en time in the rooming the expectation is
the two large pumps will have the basin
empty by noon.

BLAME LAID ON FOSTER.
A Republican Secretary of the
Treasury Said to Have Made
a Surrender.
ONE CURIOUS CUBAN INCIDENT.
Sherman Admits That He Made a
Mistake, but Will Explain Only
m Secret.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13.-
With the exception of one rather curious
episode at the opening of to-day's session
the Senate was entirely relieved of all con
sideration of the question of Cuban bel
ligerency, ana had its attention turned to
financial questions. An allusion had been
made in Sherman's speech on Thursday
to a private communication which Lodge
of Massachusetts was supposed to have
received from the Secretary of State and
to have made known confidentially to
the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Lodge said Sherman had fallen into an
unintentional error, that he had had no
interview with Mr. Olney and had received
no private communication from him, and
that the paper which had been sent from
the State Department and had been read
to the Committee on Foreign Relations by
one of its members was the statement by
the Spanish Minister giving the Spanish
version of affairs in Cuba. Sherman ad
mitted the mistake he had fallen into,
and to a suggestion that he should com
municate the paper to the Senate he re
plied that it was a matter only to be read
in executive session.
Hoar of Massachusetts and Wolcott of
Colorado commented upon the peculiar
position in which the matter was thus
placed, and Hawley of Connecticut indi
cated his purpose to move that the Senate
insist on its disagreement to the House
substitute for the Cuban resolutions and
ask for a further conference.
The financial condition of the Govern
ment was presented in a four-hour speech
by CocKrell of Missouri, in which he ar
gued that every Government obligation,
with the single exception of gold certifi
cate?, was payable in gold or silver coin,
at the option of the Government, and he
charged that Charles Foster, while Secre
tary of the Treasury, had, in October, 1891,
surrendered voluntarily, meekly and sub
missively the right of the Government to
redeem United States notes or greenbacks
in silver as well as in gold. That action
on the part of Foster Cockrell described
as the Pandora's box out of which had
come all the financial ills that had since
fallen upon the country.
Immediately after the reading of the
journal Lodge called attention to an inci
dental statement made yesterday by Sher
man as to a communication which he
(Lodge) was supposed to have had witb
the Secretary of State and to private pa
pers which he was supposed to have re
ceived concerning affairs in Cuba. The
paper referred to was a full statement of
the Spanish Minister giving the Spanish
side of the question, and which was sent
to the committee from the State Depart
ment and was read to the full committee
by one of its members (Frye). The read
ing of these papers, Lodge said, had been
confidential and had been mentioned by
the Senator from Ohio simply by inadver
tence.
Hoar commented upon these disclosures
as presenting a remarkable condition of
affairs, and asked whether the papers re
ferred to ought not to be laid before the
Senate. %
"Certainlyâ in executive session, " said
Sherman.
Wolcott suggested that the Senate found
itself in an unusual dilemma. If it were
essential (he did not think it was) that
Congress shonld act on the question of
Cuban belligerency, the Senate was con
fronted with the position of having to vote
on questions of fact, on testimony repos
ing in the breasts of the members of the
Committee on Foreign Relations alone â
testimony which they could not divulge to
the public and could divulge only in ex
ecutive session. He would be glad to
have explained to him whether or not
Senators were expected to yield their own
judgment and conscience, and to follow
the opinion (intelligently formed no doubt)
of the Committee on Foreign Relations,
based upon information which could not
be divulged.
Hale called for the regular order of busi
ness. The House bill, providing for a tem
porary increase of the revenue, was taken
up in order to give Cockrell (D.) of Mis
souri an opportunity to address the Senate.
He commenced by giving the condition
of the treasury on the 3d of March last.
He argued that all Government bonds
were payable in either gold or silver coin
under the Stanley Matthews joint resolu
tion. He declared there was not a single
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1896.
obligation pi the Government payable in
gold, with the solitary exception â the gold
certificates â and that their exclusive pay
ment in gold was a voluntary assumption
on the part of the Secretary of the Treas
ury. If it had not been for that assump
tion on the part of the Treasury Depart
ment there would have been no trouble.
There had been no raids the treasury
gold prior to October 19, 1891. "Why? Be
cause of the general belief that the notes of
the Republic were redeemable in silver and
that the Government reserved the option
so to redeem them, as stated by Secretary
Sherman in his finance report in 1878. The
silver dollar had been up to that time the
watchdog of the treasury, and had been in
finitely more successful in keeping off gold
raiders than the Rothschilds and the Bel
monts had ever been since, and they are
still the watchdog 3of the treasury in
France and Germany.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada suggested,
"Yes, everywhere except in the United
States." In this connection Cockrell read
a letter of October 8, 1891, from' the Re-
publican Club of Boston to Charles Foster,
Secretary of the Treasury, inquiring as to
the payment of United States notes in
gold, and Mr. Foster's reply, stating,
"Treasury notes are redeemed in goJd
when presented to the treasury or any
sub-treasury." .
That correspondence, Cockrell said, bad
opened Pandora's box, and all the ills that
since had fallen upon the country had
been simply because Secretary Foster sur
rendered voluntarily, meekly, submis
sively, the right of the Government to
redeem those notes in silver as well as in
gold.
Secretary Foster had not redeemed a
dollar of those notes in silver after October
14, 1891, whereas Secretary Carlisle has re
deemed some nineteen millions of them
in standard silver dollars, redeeming and
canceling the notes, and no harm had
come of it. If every ounce of the silver
bullion in that treasury had been coined
into silver dollars and paid out in redemp
tion of treasury notes, no harm would
have come. The surrender on the part of
a Republican administration was, Cock
rell said, voluntary, and was in defiance of
the express letter and purpose of the law.
Cockrell proceeded to argue against the
proposition for the issue of fifty-year
bonds to retire legal tender notes as anti-
Democratic and as in direct conflict with
Jefferson's inaugural. It was the worst
remedy for financial ills that an execu
tive officer had ever proposed. It would
be a tame surrender of the use of silver
and would cost the people at the end of
the fifty years over $2,631,000,000.
Referring to Secretary Carlisle's recent
speech in New York Cockrell said the dis
guise had been thrown aside and that
"sound money" meant gold and nothing
but gold. He declared such mono
metallism was anti-Democratic, contrary
to the Democratic platform. England, he
declared, had been unable, with all the
resources of the Bank of England, to
carry out its gnld monometallic standard
and twice had to borrow from France.
He denied that a courageous advocacy of
free silver would dmde the Democratic
party.
Reading from a list of Democratic rep
resentatives elected in 1892 and 1894, he
showed that tliere had been a terrible fall
ing off of Democratic representatives
elected in the latter year, due to the fact
that that election had been under the gold
monometallic standard of President Cleve
land. Cockrell quoted extensively from
the speeches of Secretary Carlisle, and,
speaking of his speech at Covington last
summer, declared he was loth to believe
that any Secretary of the Treasury could
make such ridiculous statements until he
read of similar statements made b y other
tools in the employ of the gold bullion
company of New York. It was ludicrous
that Secretary Carlisle should attempt to
bolster up the "theories to which he had
come a recent convert" by reliance on
such "stuff"' as that, the only excuse being
the latitude always allowed for the zeal
of converts. He appealed for the re-estab
lishment of the conditions existing prior
to 1873, for the country could not be worse
off than it had been since the perpetration
of the crime of 1873. Bimetallism was no
experiment, having been in use from the
time Abraham marched out of Chaldea
until Great Britain drove silver from use.
In conclusion Cockrell appealed to the
country to declare its independence and
declare for the equality of gold and silver,
or else resume its dependence upon Great
Britain, whom it had twice defeated, and
ask her to take it under her avaricious and
selfish guardianship and protection.
"We should," he declared, "haul down
Old Glory, the starry banner which has
waved over the power and freedom and in
dependence of the country, and hoist in
stead the gold-standard banner of Great
Britain, and cry out, 'Long live the Queen
of Great Britain and Empress of India.' "
During the latter part of this speech Sir
Julian Pauncefote, the British Embassa
dor, bad been an occupant of the diplo
matic gallery and an attentive listener to
Cockrell's speech.
At 6 P. m., the Senate adjourned till
Monday.
ASSAILED BY HERR BEBEL
Vigorous Denunciation of the
Acts of Germans in
Africa.
This Causes a Great Uproar in the
Reichstag, and Socialists Make
the Most of It.
BERLIN, Germany, March 13.â During
the discussion of the colonial budget in
the Reichstag to-day the chamber was the
scene of a tremendous uproar and con
fusion. Herr Bebel, one of the Socialist
leaders, made a violent attack upon the
systems pursued in Africa by Dr. Carl
Peters, the explorer, Herr Leist, formerly
Governor of the Cameroons, and Herr
Wehlau, who was Leist's substitute, de
claring them guilty of every species of bar
barity, including murder. He denounced
the discipline pursued by the courts in
these cases, which had proceeded from the
palace at Potsdam, and declared that the
mild sentences imposed upon Leist and
Wehlau was an act of blackest shame
the world had ever seen. He demanded
that Dr. Peters be tried for murder.
The remarks of Herr Bebel created
great excitement, and the chamber soon
drifted into a state of tumult, the Social
ists shouting violent denunciations of the
Government's course and the President
vainly ringing his bell for order.
Dr. Kayer, director of the Colonial De
partment, finally obtained a hearing, and
declared that Peters had only executed
blacks in cases where the safety of the
lives and property of the Germans in
duced such a course. He was assured, he
said, that the lives of the blacks in the
German colony were as safe as those of
the whites.

IMPORTANT BILLS AEE PASSED.
One Provides That Engineers and As

Register Must Be Citizens.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13.â The
Republican strength in the House of Rep
resentatives was increased by one this
afternoon when, by a vote of 173 to 59,
Gaston A. Robbins (D.) was declared to be
not entitled to the seat occupied by him
as a Representative from the Fourth Dis
trict of Alabama, and William F. Aldrich,
hiÃ Republican opponent, was placed
therein. This result followed a two days'
debate of the report of the Committee on
Elections No. 1, to-day's session being oc
cupied by Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas, in
a three hours' speech in behalf of Robbins,
and Daniels (R.)of New York, closing in
an argument of an hour or more for Aid
rich. The Republicans now number 247
members, the Democrats 101, Populists 7
and silverites 1.
There is a vacancy from the Eleventh
Texas district, caused by the recent death
of Representative Cram. Aldrich ap
peared at the bar and was sworn in by
Speaker Reed, amid Republican applause.
The vote was along parity lines, the Pop
ulists uniting with the Republicans in vot
ing Robbins out. White of Illinois was
the only who voted for Rob
bins, while Cobb, Dockery and De Armond
(D.) of Missouri voted with the Republi
cans for Aldrich.
Before the election case was taken up
two bills were passed. One was to require
that engineers and assistant engineers on
steamers sailing under American register
shall be American citizens; the other was
the tonnage-tax bill, repealing the recipro
cal provisions of the law of 1384, of which
only Germany and the Netherlands took
advantage, and reducing the tax on the
coastwise trade between the Americas, be
tween the United States and the West
Indies and between the United States and
Hawaii from 3 to 2 cents a ton.
At the evening session not a single item
of business was considered. Upon the
usual motion, made as soon as the House
reassembled at 8 o'clock, to go into com
mittee of the whole, Erdman (D.) of
New Jersey made the point of no quorum,
The roll was called and 145 members re
sponded to their names.
On motion by Pickler (R.) of South Da
kota, a resolution was adopted directing the
sergeant-at-arms to arrest members absent
without leave, but it was within a few
minutes of 10 o'clock before the warrant
was prepared and signed by acting Speaker
Payne (R.) of New York. At that hour a
vote by ayes and roes was obtained upon
a motion to recall the roll, and that ex
hausted the period intervening until the
nour when the session expired under the
rulesâ lo:3o o'clock. The House then ad
journed until Monday next.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 13. âThe
alleged cable dispatch sent out to-day by
the Chicago Associated Press stating that
the National Sporting Club of London
"has not yet offered a purse for a match
between Robert Fitzsimmonsand James J.
Corbett, and that no articles have oeen

Mr. Austin read the epunous dispatch of
the Chicago concern to-day he at once
cabled Mr. Atkinson to learn if there was
any foundation for the statements and that
gentleman replied as follows:
"If articles are signed as sent they will
be accepted by the National Club, but they
will not allow any fresh conditions. As

TAILORS JOIN THE STRIKE
Ten Thousand Garment- Workers
Involved in the Trouble
at Chicago.
Non-Union Men Will Assist Other Em
ployes in the Fight Against
Reduced Wages.
CHICAGO, 111., March 13.â Seven thou
-Band men and women, members of the
fourteen local unions of tailors, went out
on strike this morninp in sympathy with
the clothing cutter? and trimmers.
While the strike was practically brought
about by the clothing cutters' and trim
mers' trouble, the tailors also have griev
ances of their own. They say that before
they will return to work they must have
an increase of wages of 25 per cent. The
strike not only affects the wholesale houses,
but ten friendly firms who are having no
trouble with their employes.
Since the cutters' and trimmers' trouble
with their employers beean the tailoring
trade haa been very dull, and leaders of
the new strike say that many workmen
have been idle for weeks for lack of | ma
terial to work on. These people are not
included in the estimate given at head
quarters that 10,000 garment-workers are
involved in the strike which began to-day.
The leaders declare that 3000 tailors who
were not members of the union have
joined hands with them, believing the em
ployers intended to reduce their wages
after the defeat of the cutters and trim
mers.
Secretary Abel of the Clothing-cutters'
Association said 13,000 tailors had re
sponded to the call to strike. Telegrams
were sent to-day to Meyer Schoenfeld of
New York, the noted Hebrew organizer,
and Charles F. Reichers, president of the
United Garment-workers' Union of Amer
ica, requesting their presence in Chicago.
They are expected to arrive before Monday.
The strikers are conlident of winning,
because spring orders are coming in and
must be filled, while *he strike of the cut
ters and trimmers has depleted the stock
of unfinished garments. The manufactur
ers declare they are not affected by the
strike. They are stillordering non-union
cutters from New York.
At a meeting of the Cutters' and Trim
mers' Association to-night it wa3 decided
to call out all their members. This will
tie up the entire clothing manufacturing
industry in the city.

EVACUATION OF

ERRORS IN THE BLUE BOOK.
Some Small Mistakes Which the At
torney-General Explains Were
Due to Haste.
LONDON, E.n-g., March 13. â In the
House of Commons to-day Mr. Reginald
McKenna, Liberal member for North
Monmouthshire, inquired whether the
Government of the United States of Co
lombia, in notifying Great Britain that
Colombia would not recognize G. F. B.
Jenner, British Minister at Bogota, in fu
ture, had stated that the action of the
Colombian Government was due to defects
in Mr. Jenner's diplomatic temper.
George N. Curzon, Under Secretary of
the Foreign Office, replied that Mr. Jenner
himself had stated that the Government
of Colombia would not recognize him, but
that Colombia had not notified the British
Government of the fact or of the cause of
its action.
In the course of the discussion of the
army estimates Mr. Labouchere, Radical
member forNortbampton,orfereda motion
demanding the immediate evacuation of
Egypt by Great Britain.
"Mr. Labouchere, speaking to his mo
tion, proceeded to criticize the policy of the
occupation of Egypt, but the Speaker
stopped him, saying that the chair would
only permit the discussion of matters im
mediately relating to the army.
Mr. Labouchere replied that it would be
impossible to discuss the question upon
that basis, and that he therefore would
not move the resolution.
Sir William Harcourt contended that
the mere accident of the forms of the
House ought not to prevent the discussion
of the situation in Lgypt. He suggested
that the debate on the Egyptian situation
should take place on the coming up of the
vote for men, which he thought the Gov
ernment should allow to be consid
ered at the earliest possible time.
Mr. Balfour, the Government leader,
agreed that the vote for men should be
taken on Monday, when Mr. Labouchere
should open the debate.
Sir E. T. CTurley, Liberal member for
Sunderland, a.Â»ked the Government to
explain how it was that certain quotations
in the Venezuelan blue book marked with
inverted commas as having been taken
from documents embodied in the appen
dix did not correspond with the words in
the documents. He also desired to know
why in more than one case the sense of
the original passages had been departed
from.
Sir Richard "Webster, Attorney-General,
replied that the quotations were material
parts of the case and were correct. Tiie
slight verbal discrepancies were due to a
hurriedly revised translation of some of
the documents, and there had been no
time to make corresponding alterations in
the quotations. The errors in one case
consisted in putting a summary within
quotation marks.
EXYL, iIX Hit BY MIUK.
A Union Pacific Receiver Before the Sen
ate Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13.âOli
ver W. Mink, one of the receivers of the
Union Pacific Railroad, was before the
Senate Committee on Pacific Roads this
morning. He had been connected with
the road, he said, principally with the ac
counts and finances department, for
twenty-seven years
Questioned by Senator Wolcott, Mr.
Mink gave in detail the earnings and ex
penses of the Union Pacific road and its
various collateral branches since going
into tho hands of receivers in October,
1893, up to January 1, 1896.
In that period the gross earnings were
$32,832,602, and expenses $21,171,233. Sen
ator Wolcott then turned the inquiry into
the diversion of main-line earnings to the
payment of collateral trust obligations,
and Mr. Mink said the interest on these
bonds was paid for the purpose of holding
the system together, to preserve intact the
road from Kansas City to Denver, so it
would not end with the Union Pacific
proper, in the middle of the great plains.
When the receivers were appointed it
was not thought the financial depression
would last over a year. While the depres
sion still continued the earnings of the
road were increasing. The main line, he
said, would always earn the interest on its
first mortgage bonds if the system were
kept intact; the only danger was that a
very large part of the principal was due.
The overdue interest on the main-line

YET TO BE TAKEN.
Increase of the Anxiety of
the Party Leaders of
Kentucky.
FOR THE LAST EFFORT.
Republicans Determined to Elect
Boyle to the United States
Senate.
BLACKBURN'S CHANCES WANE.
Democrats Defeat Legislation of the
Session by Booking Measures
in the Senate.
FRANKFORT, Ky., March 13.-Only
three more ballots can be taken for United
States Senator, and as time brings the final
ballot nearer, the anxiety of the party
leaders becomes more feverish. It be
tokens a forthcoming struggle as a last
effort to elect, but whether that will take
place to-morrow, Monday or Tuesday none
but the leaders can say, if even they know.
There are very few who believe a Sena
tor can be elected, and these few believe
that if any can it will be a Republican.
Among these are St. John Boyle himself
and his leaders and advisers.
As for the Blackburn leaders, they have
given up hopes of electing him and are
centering all their energies upon prevent
ing Boyle's election, and that is why they
persist in having so many of their friends
present in the State House each day.
They will, if possible, prevent Wood
Duniap from entering the House and
taking his seat, and Senators James and
Walton from entering the joint assembly
and voting for United States Senator.
It was fully expected that Duniap would
take the oath this morning, and as the
hour of noon approached members were
anxiously watching for his appearance in
the House; but he did not come. Sen
ators James and Walton were in the
House, and sat out. the joint assembly, no
effort being made by the Democrats to
have them removed.
The joint assembly took another fruit
less ballot at noon. The vote stood:
Blackburn 50, Carlisle 13, Buckr.er 1. No
Republican voted.
There was the usual amount of vaporing
talk, but no blood was spilled. The Sheriff
and a number of deputies we-e in the State
K<>i;se at the request of the Governor, but
their services wer^ not required.
To-night Governor Bradley stated most
emphatically that he would not call an
extra session. The financial legislation
will be unfinished when the Legislature
adjourns. The measures have passed the
House, but are being hung up in the Sen
ate. A Senator who is a leader of the
DerÂ«*>crats made it his boast to-day that
nooe of these measures wouJd ever pass
in ftte Senate, the object being to cripple
Kp^ublican Government. In view of
the attitude of the Democratic majority of
the Senate in this particular the Governor
considers that it would be useless to call
an extra session.

SILVER 31 EX OF OHIO.
They Hold a Strong Session and Indulge
in Sarcmtn.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 13. â A
meeting of silver men, renresenu'nz nearly
ever county in Ohio was held at the Hol
lenden Hotel to - night. It was stormy
from the outset, and at several junctures
it seemed that the meeting would be
forced to adjourn. The main source of
contention was the proposition of A. A.
Brown of Cincinnatiâ that four silver men
be recommended to the Democratic State
convention as delegates at large to the Na
tional convention. Arguments pro and
con on the political advisability of the
motion were hotly made, sarcasms, satire
and innuendo being freely handed about.
The motion was finally laid on the table.
At an early hour Saturday morning the
meeting adjonrned. It is likely that an
other meeting will be held.
McKinley'a Name Applauded.
PITTSBCRG, Pa, March 13.â A mass

NEW YORK, N. V., March 13.â 1t is un
derstood that the Northern Pacific plan of
reorganization will shortly be issued. It
provides for an assessment of $10 per share
on the preferred and $15 per share on the
common stock, for which no security will
be given. The preferred stock, however,
â will receive a portion of its face value in
new first preferred stock. The common
stock will receive less than its present face
value in new common stock.
The consol bonds will receive first pre
ferred stock to the extent of at least the
face value of their bonds. They will prob
ably receive some security in adjustment
or overdue interest. The bond charges of
the new capital will not be far from
$3,000,000. abou-t the figure named by Mr.
Hill in the London agreement. It is un
derstood that there will be a voting trust
of at least three members and possibly
five. J. P. Morgan and August Belmont
will" be among the trustees and it is prob
able that the Deutsche Hank will be directly
represented. It is not likely that James J.

CHICAGO, 11i,., March 13.-There, was
a big break in wheat on the Board of
Trade to-day, May selling nearly cents
under closing price yesterday and 1
cent below the opening price to-day. The
market opened weak on the depressing
cables and generally finer weather, "the
start being 63)4 cents to 63% cents, which
was the curb price yesterday. There was
a wild rush of the longs to unload and
selling by the discouraged holders of May
wheat. The covering by shorts and buy
ing by New York houses helped to sup

GEXERAL WALKER'S LETTER.
Jt I'uta a Aetr Â¥ha*e on the Blue and
Gray Controversy.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 13.â A
Journal special from Richmond, Va., says:
General L N. Walker has sent a letter from
the headquarters of the G. A. R. at In
dianapolis to an editor friend in this city
denying tLat he fver made the statements
witb reference to the Blue and Gray parade
credited to him. "I entertain no such
sentiments toward the men who stood up
in the ranks on the other side and gave me
a manly chance for my life in battle. We
fought it out like men and I believe that
the matter should be buried forever."
This letter has attracted very general
attention in Confederate circles. A circu
lar inviting Southern veterans to attend
the laying of the cornerstone of the Jeff
Davis monument, in which reference is
made to Walker's sentiments, has just been
prepared. The letter was to have been con
sidered to-day by a sub-committee, but
General Walker's letter puts a new phase
on the matter.

SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 13.â A spe
cial committee of ladies, consisting of
Mrs. E. F. Woodward, Mrs. L. W. Burris
and Miss Isabel Donovan, re-enforced the
regular decoration committee to-day on a
visit to the Board of Supervisors. The
board was asked to decorate the court
house with evergreens and azaleas for the
coming carnival, at a cost of about $100.
All of the members of the board seemed
willing to comply with this reasonable re
quest except Chairman Hall, and neither
the beauty of the ladies nor the eloquence
of the gentlemen could obtain from the
economical presiding otticer more than a
promise to consider the matter.
It i-Â« now definitely settled that Ronco
vieri's American concert band, of thirty
five pieces, will be engaged for the corona
tion concert, as well as to lead the parade
and play for the floral ball.
J. C. Snell, a balloonist and parachute
jumper from Sacramento, will risk his
necfc twice during the festival for the edi
fication of the crowds, and a swartiy gen
tleman from Mexico with an unpronounc
able name will ride fiery, untamed bron
cos, which will probahlv be purchased
from some of the streetcar companies of
San Francisco.
Captain John H. Witts of the Crescent
Cycle Club of Fall River, Mass., wheeled
into town to-day and is the guest of the
Santa Rosa Bicycle Ciub. Captain Witts
has just finished a trip across the conti
nent on his wheel and will be in attend
ance at the carnival. He was,shown the
sights of the city to-day, and, among other
tilings of interest, saw the big ballot-box,
half-full of silver-laden envelopes, by
which the contest for Queen will be de
cided. Captain Witts soon became
affected by the voting mania, and during
the afternoon deposited over 500 votes Jor
his favorite candidate.
Miss Julia Guerne lias forged steadily
ahead all day and is now thought to be
leading in the contest. Miss Guerne is the
daughter of George Guerne. the well
known breeder of trotting horses, from
whom the town of Guerneville takes its
name. That she is an exceedingly popu
lar young lady is evidenced by the heavy
vote that has been polled for her every day
during the contest.
Ben Pippin, Marshal of Guerneville,
while in town recently said that his town
would have a candidate in the race for
whom the boys from the redwoods would
go to the bottom of their purses. Mr.
Pippin quaintly declared that his candi
date "might not be the bell-cow, but would
travel well up in the herd."
t The vote will be counted to-morrow at 1
o'clo ck p. m. and again at 7in the evening.

San Quentin. She alleges that she some
time ago gave Bi E cailuz $12 .50 to send to
her boy, who was sick in prison. Bis
cailuz pretended that he sent the money,
but she afterward learned from her son
and the prison officials that he appropri

RESULT OF AN EXPERIMENT.
Instantaneous Reproductions of Many
Articles Through a Hard
wood Board.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 13.â Otto V.
Ort, a photographer and electrician, has
concluded experiments at his studio that
HIDDEN OBJECTS PHOTOGRAPHED BY MEANS OF A HORSESHOE MAGNET.
[Otto V. Ort of Santa Cruz has discovered that he can picture articles through m hard substances instantaneously by a system much more
simple than that of Roentgen. With a common magnet the. outlines of a number of objects were reproduced through a hardwood board.
The negative from which this illustration was made showed that the objects had shifted position after the magnet had been placed upon
them, and consequently had been reproduced in duplicate and triplicate. They are pictured more clearly at the poles that at the
curvature of the magnet.)
demonstrate the fact that emanations -from
a horseshoe magnet have the same effect
on a sensitive plate as that produced by
the Roentgen or X-rays. He accidentally
left a common horseshoe magnet near a
bunch of dry plates and found in a little
while that the plates were "fogged" or
clouded from the action of the magnet.
This suggested to him that the permanent
magnet might have the same effect on a
sensitive plate, so he undertook the exper
iment.
Mr. Ort was aware that emanations from
an electric magnet would affect a dry plate,
the same as the light would affect it, and
since the horseshoe or permanent magnet
also affected the dry plates, as instanced
by the accidental placing of one near a
bunch of them, he concluded that the ex
periment would become a demonstration.
Otto V. Ort of Santa Crnz, the Photographer Who Photographs Hidden Objects by
Means of the Horseshoe Magnet.
He took an ordinary hardwood plate
holder, such as photographers use, and
placed within it the sensitized plate
adapted to photograph and on the top of
the box placed various articles of alumi
num, cojtper, zinc, abalone shell, brass
and sheetiron. The aluminum was repre
sented by small squares, the copDer by
small washers and one-cent pieces, the zinc
by triangular putty points such as are
used by glaziers, the abalone shells by a
round fragment about the size of a nickel,
the brass by a Yale key and the sheetiron
by a flat drawer-key. On these articles he
laid an eight-inch horseshoe magnet, and
wrapped around this box, anicles and
magnet :i piece of olack pap^r, placed thÂ»
package within three 1 1) ickrtesses of card
board and carried it into the dark room,
where it was left for twelve hours. The
plate was then removed from the plate
holder and developed by the liko-hydro
potash process.
Ort found that he had produced a fair
negative, but was surprised to see that
some of the articles had been photographed
in duplicate and triplicate. It occurred to
him that this was produced by a jarring of
the pieces. The sheetiron key was taken
in triplicate and the brass key in duplicate,
and the one-cent pieces in duplicate. One
of the washers and one of the putty points
lodged on the piece of abalone shell. This
disturbance was causea by the placing of
the horseshoe magnet. But it opened to
Mr. Ort the possibility that the production
was instantaneous, and if this could be
proven the twelve hours in the dark room
would be shown to be unneccessary.
He toot another plate, confined it in the
box only one second, and was rewarded
with a faint impression of the articles.
The first picture shows the outlines of
the several articles quite distinctly, so that
an observer may distinguish their shape
and form with ease, though the duplica
tions look much like shadows. The ob
jects are more strongly represented under
the poles of the magnet than at the curva
ture. There is a light circle on the photo
at the end where the curvature of the
magnet lay, while the poles are not repro
duced in the picture.
Mr. Ort is confident that the permanent
magnet may be used with success in this
Jine of experiments and feels that he has
demonstrated that there is no need for the
production of fluorescence in order to pro
duce a photograph. He says he has never
used a Crookes tube, though he is satisfied
that he could use it successfully from the
information he has gained from newspa
per accounts. He believes that there is
something beyond the mere production of
a photograph in the uses of the permanent
magnet and he will give some attention to
experiments that may prove of benefit to
science.
SAW A. WHITE SEA OTTER.
Santa CrUt Fl.thirtnen Allow A Small
fortune to t'.srupe.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 13.â Two
fishermen. William Bw&nson and Arthur
I Googins, while off Lighthouse Point this
â  morning, discovered a sea otter that at
tracted small attention at first, as they are
often seen in these waters; but within in a
few minutes t lie otter came within thirty
five feet of their boat, and to their surprise
they discovered it was mow white. Mr.
Gooeins and Mr. Swanson had never
believed in the white sea otter stories, and
were inclined to doubt their first im
pression, but white it was without doubt,
and that it was a sea otter they were quite
as certain.
The stranger seemed tame enough, and
as they made no effort to molest it it
played about the boat for nearly half an
hour, when something frightened it away.
They had no firearms or means of captur
ing it, and while they supposed that it
wo uld have been a valuable catch as a cu
riosity they were not aware of the commer
cial value of the white sea otter. When
they returned to the wharf this evening
and reported thoir adventure and learned
that the skin would havu been worth sev
eral thousand dollars they v,-ere greatly
chagrined. *

AN ELOPEMENT
AT HOLLISTER.
A Young Woman Leaves the
City With a Putative
Preacher.
AIDED BT HER SISTER.
Professor Simmons, Revivalist
and Phrenologist, Carries
Away a Convert,
MISS M'CROSKEY'S ESCAPADE.
Comes to Town With Her Mother and
Boards a Train With the Wily
Exhorter.
HOLLISTER, Cal., March 13.â The an
nouncement this evening that Miss Annie
McCroskey, a young lady of about twenty
summers, had eloped with Professor Sim
mons, who has been holding revival meet
ings here for the past few weeks, threw
Hollister into a state of excitement.
Simmons' daily and evening meetings,
which were conducted in a tent, have at
tracted large congregations. In addition
to preaching, he pretended to know some
thing of phrenology, and the flattery
which he gave to many who came forward,
to have their "bumps" examined resulted
in a short time in the formation of a large
clasÂ«, of which Miss McCroskey was a
member.
Last week the young woman branched
out and occupied the stand in the tent
, both as a preacher and phrenologist. Her
; success at this first attempt was more than
I she could stand, and the encomiums of
i the wily professor placau her completely in
\ his power.
The elopement was evidently a prear
ranged affair. Miss McCroskey came to
town to day with her sister, Edith, aifti
they were heard to remark as they parted
with their mother on the street, "She is
not on to the racket."
This would have been true had not Dis
trict Attorney Dooling and County Clerk
Foote been on the train on which the
elopers departed. These officials recog
nized the young lady and her companion,
and as soon as Uilroy was reached word
was sent to the parents of the girl, who are
prominent and respected people.
Professor Simmons came here from
Napa, where, it is said, his actions were
not above reproach. He had been here
but a few days v.ben there was questions
as to his moral life. One of the local pa
pers published a statement at which he
took offense, and to vindicate himself he
had many persons testify in an open meet
ing as to what he had been. It was
reported here this evening that the couple
were arrested in San Jose, and will be re
turned here to-morrow.'
ARRESTED AT SAX JOSE.
Sitnmona Apprehended and Placed in the
County Jail.
SAN JOSE. Cal., March 13.â T. J. Sim
mons, the so-called evangelist, was ar
rested in this city this evening on the
arrival of the 5 o'clock train from Hollister,
on instructions received from Sheriff Hol
brook of San Benito County. Simmons
was accompanied by Miss Annie Mc-
Croskey of Hollister, and his detention
was due to a warrant sworn to by the
young lady's father, charging him with
abduction.
Deputy Sheriff Black made the arrest.
The minister objected vigorously, and de
clared that the officer could not arrest
him without a warrant. Simmons was
taken to the County Jail. The yoÂ»ng lady
was not taken along, as instructions had
been received to have her sent to a hotel.
Simmons is about 49 years of age, and fs
both an evangelist and a phrenologist. He
talked freely.
"I hardly know what kind of a state
â¢ment to make," he said. "My arrest was
uncalled for. There was no reason in the
world why I should be laken from a train
and thrown into jail like a common crim
innl. Miss McCxoskey and I were on our
way to Calistoga, and intended to stop in
San Francisco long enough to be united in
marriage. I have been married before and
have four children, but my wife died four
years ago. I am an evangelist, also a
phrenologist, and for the past two months
have been holding meetings in a tent at
Hollister. I taught MiÂ«s McCroskey the
science of phrenology, and we learned to
think a great deal of each other.
"Alter we had decided to get married I
asked the father if I could have his daugh
ter. He refnsed, and â you know bow it
is â I was determined to have the girl any
way. I went to the train to-day and the
young lady came of her own free will and
joined me before the train started. I
can't be held for abduction, and Miss Mc-
Croskey is nearly 23 years old. My arrest
is an outrage, but I an: determined to
have redress. If it takes money to get
satisfaction I've cot lots of it, and this
affair will cost somebody $20,000."
Miss McCroskey, who eloped with Sim
mons, is a daughter of Ben McCroskey,
an old resident of Hollister. She is of
medium height, slight build and is of pre
possessing appearance. She seems to be
very much in love with Simmons, and de
clares that she will marry nim in spite of
all parental objections.

Warm Weather a Soon to the Santa Clara
Valley Orchards.
SAN T JOSE, Cal., March 13.â The warm
weather of the past week is bringing for
ward the fruit buds rapidly throughout
the valley. The prunes, cherries, peaches
and other fruits are bursting into bloom,
and if the cold weather had any damaging
effect upon them it is not yet perceptible.
Thus far the prospects for a good crop are
very bright. Apricots and almonds were
generally getting- into bloom when the cold
weather came. The indications at that
time were that the apricot crop would be
short, from causes in no way connected
with the weather, and there has been little
if any change in the prospects since then.
All" the otuer fruits are making as good
a showing as could reasonably be desired.
Considerable more rain will be needed,
however, to carry the fruit through to per
fect maturity.

One Mare Found Nearly Buried Under
the Earth Pawed Up in Her
Struggles.
MODESTO, Cal., March 13.â "White
â¢Hat" McCarty returned this evening from
Canty's ranch, whither he went to see hig
band of starving horses. When inter
viewed he said he had put 2&4 into the pas
ture. To-day he found 109 living and
thirty-four dead, the balance being on the
lower part of the ranch. He will go down
to-morrow to hunt up those in the brush.
McCarty was accompanied by Admer N.
Brown, a former employe. When they ar
rived at Canty's ranch this morning they
found the men, under Canty's directions,
separating the weakest horses and feeding
them, giving them better pasture and haul
ing feed. McCarty offered to buy a load of
hay and Canty sold it. McCarty found
three valuable animals unable to rise. One
was the mare Crescent, sired by Prompter,
and another Daisy S, the mother of three
of the finest horses on the coast â Little
Bob, Mesattent (bought for $6500) and
Phyllis. At present the horses found by
him to-day are being well fed on bran, hay
and grass. McCarty denounces Canty
strongly. He says:
"I wouldn't think of letting such an
j outrage go unpunished. I nave $300,000
! invested in the horses, their value ranging
I from $300 to $4500. Some of them belong
!to my son. It is pitiful to see some of
i them. Crescent, when approached, neighed
! feebly. Brown and I carried water in our
j hands, which the mare licLed eagerly.
One mare was nearly buried by the earth
pawed up in her struggles.
"When they were hrst put into the pas
j ture Canty told me the horses could run
: the entire length of the land to the river;
! then he put in a cross-fence, confining all in
I the poor pasture on the island. Cftnty tells
i me he buried all that died near the road.
â¢ I cannot see why his neighbors, seeing the
\ condition of the stock, did not breafc down
i the fence and let all out to feed."
The date for McCarty's examination has
not yet been set by the court.

Caught by a Constable While Tarry
ing in Stocktonâ Long Record
of Crime.
STOCKTON, C.vl., March 13.â Constable
F. B. Fenton of Sutter Creek boarded the
Sacramento train at noon to-day in a
happy frame of mind. This was due to
the fact that he had for a companion
"Rev." J. A. Smith, reputed to be a very
smooth swindler, whom he had arrested a
few hours before on the water front in this
city. The constable had returned from
San Francisco on the morning boat after
an unsuccessful hunt in the bay cities for
Smith, and found him while awaiting
a train.
The officer and his prisoner stopped at
the Sheriff's office, and the former told the
local officers who dropped in to inspect his
catch the story of the operations of the
swindler in and about Sutter Creel:, Ania
dor County. Smith, according to t Beer,
drove the gospel-car into Atuadi r < ' unity
about six months apo with the ay ed in
tention of evangelizing the sturdy moon*
tain population.
As camp-meeting services vere in
progress at the time he had ample oppor
tunity to display his accomplishments as
an exhorter. He won the confidence of
the people from bis first appearance, and
an actual jealousy sprung ap as to who
should entertain the gifted speaker and
show him ihe deference duo his high at
tainments. J. \V. Siebule carried Suiith
away and gladly lodged him under his
own roof.
One day the hum bte preacher confided
to his host that he had just got word from
England that he had fallen heir to a fortune
of 140,000, by the death of a titled relative.
He. said he had no use for the money; all
he wanted was a home in which to rest
after labors in the spiritual vineyard.
If Sebole would agree to lodge and feed
him during the term of his natural life he
would leave him the bulk of the $40,003,
|600 to the pretty servant girl, and $1000 to
each of his host's nieces. The offer was
accepted. This was rive months ago, and
the confidence man had never been both
ered E>y board bills.
I: is now learned that during this period
of rest Smith varied his church work by
making love to several marriageable
women and several who were not in a
position to consider matrimony. His at
tentions created talk, and about a week
ago the preacher said he would have to
make a trip to San Francisco to interview
the British Consul in regard to his finan
cial standing and to make arrangements
to collect the interest on his legacy.
Sebole did not suspect anything until sev
eral days after the preacher's departure,
when he found that he had taken all his
belongings with him.
Then the people in lone and Sutter
Creek began to talk, and when Seboie
besan to investigate he found evidence
sufficient to satisfy him that he- had been
duped. The erstwhile host and friend got
mad and swore out a warrant charging
Smith with swindling, and it is said other
charges will be made. Constable Fenton
started out to look for the man, and, pre
vious to finding him on the water front
here this morning, he learned considerable
of his history.
It appears that but ashort time ago
Smith was released from Folsom, where
he had "done time," having been sent
from Santa Cruz for obtaining money
under false pretenses.
He also married a girl named Hattie
Lawrence in San Francisco and took her
to Santa Cruz on a honeymoon trip, the
expenses of which were paid by his dupes.
He cut a wide swath in Santa Cruz and
lived part of the time at a fashionable
boarding-house on Fourth street. When
discovered he escaped to British Columbia,
was apprehended there, brought back to
Santa Cruz, tried and convicted and se^t
to Folsom.
Constable Fenton started for Amador
County to-day with the convict. There he
will he made to face some lively music.
Smith preached here about two years ago.
He evidently did not know the othoers
were looking for him, as he did not seek
to hide bis identity.
ROMANCE OF PETALUMA
A Divorced Wife Breaks Into
Her Ex-Husband's Home
With an Ax.
He Had Refused to Pay Alimony and
Is in Jail â Progress of a
Family Feud.
SANTA ROSA, March 13. -Two cases in
the Superior Court of this county are at
tracting much attention. One is an action
for unlaw.ul detainer brought by Mrs.
Mary A. I'erry atTainst .Joseph Perry, her
brother; Frank Justen, her foster son,
and Gussie Josteu, her niecej'and the other
is tlÂ»e divorce mil of Gussie Justen vs.
Frank Juften. All of the parlies are from
Pefaluma, and the litigation is the result
of a big family quarrel.
, Many years ago Mr-. Mary A. Perry, be
in well-to-do and childless; adopted two
children to cheer nndtiomfort her old age.
One of these was Frank Justen, who upon
reaching man's estate fell in love with and j
married (.ussie Perry, a niece of his foster
mother. In order to secure a home to the
young people, Mrs. Perry deeded to- her
foster son about $4000 worth of property, I
but placed the deed in escrow \v;tu Lip- i
pit & Lippitt, attorneys, of Pttalunia.
The couple took up their residence on j
the property, and for a while the course of >!
true love ran smoothly. But some time '
last fail, after several violent quarrels, the
young wife left her husband and com
menced' a suit fora divorce. " She asked for j
a division of the property and for alimony
an<( counsel fees to the extent of $120.
The court granted the prayer for ali
mony and counsel fees and made an order
directing Justen to pay within ten days.
Justen claimed to have no means of rais
ing that sum and refused to comply with
the order, and so a few days ago he was
pinced in the County Jail here, where he
lias since remained.
Shortly after commencing her suit Mrs.
Justen, "accompanied by her father, re
turned to her husband's home, only to
Bod all of the door* tightly locked and
the premises vacant. Thinking that pos
session was nine points in the law the
yoUBR wife procured an ax, and, battering
down the front door, took possession of
the house. She and her father have since
resided there.
Now comes Mrs. M. Perry, who declares
that Blie is .-till the owner of the property,
and asks the court to dispossess all of the
defendants and declare the escrow deed to
be vaid. An effort will be made by Jus
ten s attorneys to-morrow to show the
court that he is unable to pay the $120 ali
mony, and have him released from jail.

JAIL-BREAK AT LAKEPORT
George Coburn, a Kleptomaniac,
Cuts Through the Floor
of His Ceil.
Had Been Convicted of Burglary and
Sentenced to a Term in
Folsom.
LAKEPORT, Cm.., March 13.â George
; W. Coburn, who has been confined in the
; County Jail at this place for four months,
: escaped Wednesday night by cutting
through the tloor and then through a 20
--inch brick wall. His flight was not dis
; covered until yesterday morning, and the
| oih'cers of San Francisco nnrt intermediate
i points were notified at once. It is sup
posed that he will make tor Sa:i Francisco
' and endeavor to obtain passage to Ukiah.
His father, W. K. Coburn, spent consid-
J erab'.e time with him in his cell and last
Monday went to San Francisco. He is
'â  suspected of having aided his son in ar
ranging the escape and officers were in
structed to shadow him.
Young Coburn is a kleptomaniac of the I
worst type. He has been stealing from his :
neighbors for ten or twelve years and al- i
though many of his thefts were commit- i
' ted in open day he was only recently ap- |
; pri'henued. At his trial a "wagon-load of j
, articles which he had taken was exhibited '
jin court. The plunder consisted of old
clothing, boots, shoes, books, canned fruit,
pepper sauce, bottles of ink, crowbars,
axes, lamps, stoves and innumerable other
\ articles. Some of these were utterly use
less to him and could not be disposed of. !
He never soid any of his stolen goods, but j
hid them in caches in the brush.
Coburn was convicted of burglary in the !
â  second degree and sentenced to three years i
in the penitentiary. He was to havebeen
taken to Folsom several days ago, but the
â¢ Judge granted a stay of proceedings to i
; give his attorney time" to prepare a bill of !
i exceptions.
CoDurn is about 30 years of age, has a '
, sandy complexion, light hair, blue or gray i
! eyes, and is about five feet six inches tall. !
He has a cunning, foxy appearance, and at
the same time a cringing, apologetic air, j
: and never looks one in the eye.
A MISSION HIGH SCHOOL
People South ot Fourteenth Street
Will Petition for
One.
An Enthusiastic Mass â¢ Meeting and
Birth of the "Mission High
School Club."
The citizens of the district south oi i
Fourteenth street held an enthusiastic
mass-meeting last night at the Mission C
Parlor of the Native Bons.
The question of having a high school in
that part of town was thoroughly dis- !
cussed, and an association known as the !
Mission High School Club was started, !
which will continue to aeitate this desire
of the !ar<re number of inhabitants living j
in this part of town.
Thd following officer? were elected : John
H. Grady, president; Mrs. W. .1. Hardy,
vice-president; Miss Lucile Bailey, secre
tary, and E. P. Murphy, treasurer.
Hi eeches were made by J. F. Crosset, J.
H. Grady, E. P. Murphy," William Metzner
and St'libol Director William Henderson.
Mr. Grady stated that 30 percent of the
High School children of the City came
from that portion of town south of Four
teenth street and that in the present state
of affairs the children were new oblieeu
to traverse the length o^ the City in goinsr
to and coming from school.
Director Henderson said the matter of
expense was the main thing that the
board would have to first consider. He
thought, however, this difficulty might
perhaps be obviated by bonding the City
for say $5,000,000. He was of the opinion
that the Lowell Hijrh School for boys
might be moved to the neighborhood of
Twenty-third street.
It was decided to hold weekly meetings
of the club on Friday nights.
The following resolutions, submitted by
President Grady, were adopted:
Whereas, The large district south of Four- 1
teenth street, representing 60 per com of this I
City and Couniv, and its inhabitants paying a I
large share of taxes and furnishing several
thousand school children, whose intelligence
and ability cannot be excelled, is entirely
without a high school or high school
facilities; and whereas, there are now sup
ported in part by our people four high schools, i
ali of wliich are' situated in one section of the
city, and as by their great distance our chil- !
drcn are practically denied the advantages of ;
the course of studies they teach or would |
teach them; therefore be it
Ktxoh'ol, Tnat the parents of this large dis
trict, in mass-meeting assembled, earnestly I
request the Board of Education to take imnu. ; - i
diate steps to till this long-falt want and piace '
us on the same footing with other sections of j
the City. Be it further
/.â < * That a committee of seven be np- i
pointed by this club to present the-e resolo- '
ttons with Mich other facts as may appear to j
them at once to the Board oi .Education, and i
ta!;e such steps as may be required to attain j
our end.
The appointment of the committee of
Bfren was postponed until the next meet
ing.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1896.
THE STRIKE IS
NEAR A CRISIS.
I Union Men Confident of Suc
cess Within a Very
Few Days.
MASTER PAINTERS MEET
They Discuss Their Troubles in
Secret Behind Closed
Doors.
SIXTY BOSSES HAVE GIVEN IN.
If the Strike Lasts Two Weeks Longer
the Building Trades Will Be
Involved.
!
________
The painters' strike for higher wages,
shorter hours and a recognition of the
Building Trades Council working-card ;s
still on, but the strikers are confident of
an early victory.
Their confidence in this ultimate end is
based on two or three propositions. First,
nearly sixty of the boss painters have
capitulated to the union's demands; sec
ond,if the strike continues two weeks longer
it will involve the entire building trades
in this City, which threatens to tie up
every piece of work under way and stop all
contemplated work, and, third, the strik
ers are satisfied that there is a division
in the Master Painters' Association, a
majority of which have already agreed to
the union s terms.
There are several remarkable features in
the present strike, which has been on for
rive days. Every meeting of the strikers
has been held with open doors, a thing
unprecedented in labor 6trikes, and the
most singular thins is that the strike has
cost the union only $47 30 for relief of mem
bers, hall rent, etc. So far not a single act
of violence has been committed.
The Master Painters' Association held
its first meeting since tbe strike last even
ing, but it was held with closed doors and
the members and officers were pledged not
to divulge what had been done or said.
Whether this means that they are prepar
ing to compromise with the strikers or
tight can only be surmised.
MASTER PAINTERS MEET.
A Division of Opinion as to the
Policy Toward the
Strikers.
The members of the Master Painters'
Association held a meeting last evening,
the first since the journeymen painters'
strike began last Monday. There was a
large attendance present and the debate
lasted from 8 to 11 r. m.
The debate as to the policy of the asso
ciation on the strike question was longand
spirited and judging from the silence of
the members after the meeting was over
no conclusion was arrived at.
A resolution was passed enjoining all the
members from giving any news to the press
or public of what had been done in the
meeting.
One thing was learned and that is that a
committee of about ten was appointed,
but whether to confer with the strikers, to
organize a fighting campaign or to draft an
agreement, could not be learned. After
the meeting the committee was organized.
BOSSES COME TO TERMS.
Encouraging: Reports Made by the
Striking Painters' Com
mittees.
The regular afternoon meeting of the
striking painters in the Temple yesterday
was a most enthusiastic affair. The reason
was that with very few exceptions the re
ports of the committees showed that there
are very few master painters now holding
out against the union's demands. A list of
over sixty boss painters who have given in
was read and received with cheers.
Danielson of the North Beach committee
made a statement that caused a little sur
prise. He said that all of the shops in the
Latin quarter, except the recognized union
shop*, are tied up, and not a single foreign
painter is now working. These painters
are all standing firm for the union.
This condition of affairs, Danielson said,
was caused to a very great extent by
Pietro Gori, the anarchist. The latter had
been of L-reat service to the committee, as
he had given much of his time to explain
ing to his countrymen the principles of
unionism and the' importance of all union
men standing together in trouble and in
peace. A vote of thanks was extended by
the striking painters to the anarchist.
Attention was called to newspaper adver
tisements for painters and decorators.
The advertiser offered the former $3 .50
and the latter $4 50 a day. This was de
nounced as a bosses' trick to fill the town
with worJcmen to fill the strikers' places.
Several of the committees and a number
of strikers made reports on individuals and
jobs.
Committees 1 and 7, A. M. Beach
chairman, reported that at 220 O'Farrell
street four men were locked in so that the
committee could not see them, and James
Kienfteld, 2019 Hyde, Pessano ifc Caratto,
2008^ Mason, and L. Bedoni, 12 Jasper
place, have given in to all demands.
"The Mis-ion diÃtrict is all tied up," was
the report of committee 2.
Committee 4, Mclvor chairman, reported
nearly every job so ith of Market from
Tenth to tTie water front is all tied i t>.
Took out two men from a job or> Fourth
street. Koch, the painter, who has held
out so long, at ast gave in and sent in his
application with the assurance that here
after his will be a union shop. Molvor
preen ted the following communication
from liradley & Son:
This is to certify that Bradley & Son agree to
all conditions an d accept the card system of the
I'aintets' Union. Bhadley "Â«fc BOH,
, * 9~'3 Mission street.
The letter was received with cheers, as
this tirrn. which does a large amount of
work and employs many men, has beld
out up to the present time with much tiini
ness.
Committee 7, Saurwine chairman, re
ported two men working on Franklin
street who are not union men. This is
Haver's job.
W. M. Welch is out for the union and so
are his men.
Tuson on Larkia street has given in.
Lavigne on Golden Gate avenue has
given in to all demands.
Committee 10, Kerrepan chairman, re
ported that Palmer & Speetzen have
given in.
O. W. Boyd of i'4ol Sutter street and C.
G. Foley of 2110 Filliuore street have
xiven in.
The Shaffer Bros, are still holding out
aeainst the union.
C. F. Schadt, business agent of the Car
penters' and Joiners' Union, was called
for. He stated that in his rounds he has
Kept a 6harp outlook for non-union paint
era. Only at one place, at the farther end
of Taylor street, did be find a non-union
job, but the boss promised to support the
painters. In all his rounds he has heard
much discussion by tbe public in general,
and all seem to hoL>e the painters will win
the strike. He advised the men to keep
on lirmly, but not to resort to violence,
and said:
Your fight is the fight of the carpenters and
all branches of the trades unions, and I for
one would be in favor of nil the carpenters and
all the other unions turniug out to-morrow to
help the striking painters if necessary. Your
fight ia our tight, and if you lose all the rest of
us will lose. When your wages go down ours
are sure to fall, so 1 say we must stand to
gether, and if it |s necessary let us tie up the
whole building trades in this City. All our
hopes of getting our rights for the next four
yenrs depend upon our success this year.
This is the election year, ana now is our chance
to secure our rights.'
Mr. Schadt told of an experience in the
forenoon on Hyde and Union streets. Dur
ing a discussion with non-union carpen
ters an olhciou? policeman told the gath
ering of men that when the lathers get
ready to go to work for them to do so and
he would be ready to shoot the head off
the rim striker who interfered with the
workmen. The union laborers, who to a
great extent pay the taxes from which this
policeman secures his pay, greatly appre
ciate this kind of police protection. The
speaker is glad that the entire force is not
made of the same clay as that of the
North Beach policeman.
A report wits made that in the Physi
cian's Home Hospital, on Sutter and Jones
street*, the nurses arc painting the floors.
President Rose ipld of an interesting ex
perience he had with Krebler's men on a
job on Bush and Jones streets. He said
that the non-union men were very abusive
and even threatened the committee with
violence. One of the carpenters there was
also very ugly and ahused him roundly.
Some one became alarmed and sent for t fie
police and a squad of three arrived a little
later, but found nothing to warrant police
interference. However, before the com
mittee left they took out two painters who
will join the union at once.
The painters will acain meet at 3 o'clock
to-day and again at 8 o'clock in the even
ing at 115 Turk street and initiate over 200
new members.

INDORSE THE STRIKERS.
Words of Encouragement From the
Labor Council and the Car
penters' Union.
There was a pood attendance at last
night's meeting of the. San Francisco Labor
Council, and those present expressed their
sympathy for the striking painters in no
uncertain terms. One member stated that
he had found seven sailors about to under
take a job of painting offered them by one
of the firms which the Painters' Union i|
endeavoring to bring to time. He showed
them a copy of The Call, wherein was
contained what he considered the fairest
and most complete public statement of the
condition of aff iirs, and when the sailors
had seen it they gw up the job.
"Sailors, as a rule," h> explained, "don't
go a-scabhing; at least union sailors don't,
unless they are fooled, as these fellows
were."
.1. K. PriiUips, chairman; vV. McArthur,
secretary; A. Milner, O. Grassmann anJ
Josep Walter, all of the committee on
law and le.tris'ation, presented the follow
ing resolution aneni the painters' strike,
which was unanimously adopted:
Whereas. The California Painters' and Deco
rators' Union No. 1 is now on a strike forthÂ©
introduction and maintenance of 'the union
card system, for the eight-hour day, and for a
minimum uaee of $3 par day; and whereas,
these demands are reasonable And in keeping
with the principles of decent labor; therefore,
be it. â¢â _ ." -\'. . ... ' . â  . â¢ .â .â¢.,.
Resolved, That the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil In regular session assembled, indorses the
strike of ihc Mid ion, and guarantee* its
support morally and financially, and --â -' .* â 'â  :
, Jit-olvui, That the Han Francisco Labor Coun
cil requests the support of the public, the
press and all fair employers toward , the end
that the workers involved may secure their
demands.
The secretary of the Coast Bean?en's
Union requested that a rumor to the
t-ffect tliu" that otyanibatkm was on t)>e
eve of a strike be disregarded, as it wa.< en
tirely without foundation.
.1. T. On yon, representing the Iron
mooluers 1 Union No. KM entered a protect
against the sale of prison-made Stove*.
lie reported that large numbers of these
stoves, made in Salt-ni, Or., by convicts
employed under contract in one of the
foundries there, were shipped to this City
for sale, and that a fresh carload was now
on the way, consigned to a leading hard
ware house.
The council decided to take no imme
diate action in the case of the striking
lathers.
At a meeting of: the "Carpenters' and
Joiners' Union No. , 22 a resolution was
adopted providing for the sending of a
latter to the sinking pa"nterÂ« voicing the
union's approbations of their attitude in
words of. encouragement and good fellow
ship. ' â  '/..â 'â  . -, ;â  ...'â ",' ': â  .;â  .
The union decided to" raise its initiation
fee, which will be $10 in place of $2 as here
tofore, after the Ist of May next. A union
of Italian carpenters : will be formed by
delegates ;: from union No 22 .- on â  next
Thuisday night at Apollo Hall, on Pacific
street," near Stockton. Delegates from the
union.will also attend; the Labor Conven
tion to-morrow. * Preparations j are being
made for the union's annual picnic, which
is set for April 26 in Sunset Park, among

THE DEMOCRATIC ARENA
Hot War Over Buckley for the
State Central Committee
To-Day.
BUCKLEY WARRIORS READY.
The Fate of the Junta Depends on the
Hazard of the Meeting This
Afternoon.
The Democrats will occupy the political
arena to-day.
The meeting of the Democratic State
Central Committee in the billiard-room of
the California Hotel at 2 o'clock this after
noon is a momentous one to the partyâ at
least it might be a momentous one if this
happened to be a Democratic year.
The meeting to-day may not' decide the
political fate of Chris Buckley and the old
friends of his who have rallied together in
exceedingly formidable array, but it will
have a strong if not a determinative influ
ence on the local party situation.
The party now consist* mainly of three
elements. First come Buckley and the
Democrats who lean to the faction he
dominates. This faction has the bulk of
the "push," the bulk of the old-time and
experienced practical politicians of the
party, and the bulk of the votes and vote -
makers^ which count at election time. It
has, too, the bulk of the political skill and
shrewdness if not the brains and influence
of the party in San Francisco. It regis
tered 11,800 votes at its last enrollment
and it voted about 6000 names at its recent
uncontested primary. A large majority of
these nanns are believed to be legitimate.
\ . Among the avowed members and cham
pions of the Buckley element are such
men as Judge Robert" Ferral, George R. B.
Hayes, Peter F. Dunne, the United States
Land Receiver, Railroad Commissioner
James I. Stanton, John McCarthy, James
H. O'Brien. E. T. Mills, Joseph Roths
child, A. J. Clunie, James C. Nealon, Dr.
Bryan.
Secretly favorable to this element is a
large number of men of party influence
who would exhibit no open alliance.
Among them are generally reputed to be
Kussel! Wilson, W. W. Foote, Jud?e Gar
ber, E. C. Coogan, W. F. Goad, Fleet F.
Strother,- E. P. Cole, Thomas E. Bishop,
A. H. Lough borough, W. B. Wilshire and
many others of liKe standing. .
The second most notable element con
sists of the aggregation of political forces
which has come to be Known as the Junta.
Gavin McNab and his friend and follower
W. P. Sullivan now and for some time
have controlled and managed this organ
ization. It, contains a larger percentage â
leaving actual numbers out of considera
tion â of the decent, honest and respectable
element of the party than does the Buck
ley element. The Junta was organized
and it exists solely to oppose Christopher
A. Buckley's return 10 political power. It
has no other end. It proclaim* the slogan,
"Decency, anti-Buckleyism and anti-boss
ism," and it asks recognition on this
ground alone, regardless of the wishes of a
majority of the party and regardless of
whether or not a large majority of the
party want Buckley, and Buckleyism.
The Junta enrolls among its supporters
a large number of good, decent and some
what influential Democrats.
This support of influential and yet highly
respectable Democrats is, however, rather
passive than active, as Is often the case
under such circumstances. But these good
people constitute a minority of the organ
ization. The Junta aggregation is com- j
posed first and mainly of- Itainey and
lis Fire Department political strength,
Superintendent of the Mint : Daggett and
his patronage political strength and Inter
nal Collector Welburn and the political
strength he wields through his patronage.
To those three powers Gavin McNab is in
close friendship. Gavin McNab alone can
hold them together and Gavin McNat)
wields their combined powers as one club.
Added to these factors is a minority ele
ment of unquestioned decency, in the name
of which all things are done by Gavin Me-
Nab.
So ps far as practical politics go the situ
ation now presented is one of Gavin Mc-
Nab vs. Christopher A. Buckley.
But there is a third element in the party,
and it is a big one. It is composed of
Democrats who have no use for Buckley
for one thing. For another thing they
have no more use for Sam Rainey who,
they believe, controls the Junta, when it
comes to practical politicsâ not the talk
ing, which is attended to by Gavin McNab.
This third element includes nearly all of
that large element of the party that has no
use for John Daggett, who figures so
largely in the Junta in. conjunction with
his personal and political friend, Sam
Rainey, who has fomrht Daggett's battles
in Sacramento and elsewhere and who gets
men in the Mint whenever he wants them.
It is the general understanding among
local politician* that Daggett and Rainey.'s
combination looks to Daggett's interests
in State politic* and Rainey's interests in
local politics. Dacgett has had the hand
of many Democrats against him since the
famous Stockton convention of 1884, when
he was formally read out of the party, and
he has reopened a lot of those old sores
Â»nd gained a fresh lot of Democratic ene
mies through the way he has wielded his
Mint patronage. Some are simply dis
appointed and some kick because Daggett
has come down from Siskiyou and tried to
control San Francisco politics. What Dag
gett wants just now is the delegation to
the National convention.
â¢ This third element includes, too. the
many anti-BucKley men who have no use
for Gavin McNab, th*Â» anti-Buckley boss.
Among the legion of local Democrats who
have enemies ready with a club M Nab is
a star. Among thesf are counted Judge
Sullivan and J. J. Dwyer, who led the
anti-Buckley revolution of 1892, and many
who took leading parts with them. Still
others, who have simply a hopeless desire
to see something decent loom up in Demo
cratic politics, care nothing for anybody
whose name gets mentioned in all the mess. |
\ Their position toward the \ Buckley and I
Junta factions is, "A plague on both your !
houses." Eugene* Deuprey. chairman of :
the last municipal convention, and ap- J
pointer of that "Deuprey committee,",
which was used to start the Junta organi- I
zation, is one of these ahti-Bucklevites who !
will have nothing to do with the Junta.
This is the local situation which con- I i
fronts the Democratic State Central Com
mittee to day with its chief problem. It is
partly a matter of principle and discretion f ,
nd largely a matter of practical politics.
The members from the interior are nat- !
rally opposed to Buckley. For four or
, five months Gavin McNab, assisted by Max I
Popper and others, have been \ seeing and ' \
â  writing to the country members of the i
committee, explaining, that the. situation I
was one of the: entire decent elements of i ;
the party against a dethroned and unscru
pulous boss, who has sold - out and who
won"d sell out the party, and getting their
assurances of support and their proxies.
The State Central Committee consists of I ,
103 .member?. , Most of the 'eighteen San i
Francisco member? are against Buckley. I
Nearly nil the interior members * are i"
against BucUey; but the Buckleyites !
have not don â¢ the missionary work that
Gavin McNab has done.;: ,
There are two main question? related to
to-day's meetingâ ln>w far will the mem- â¢
bers, present consider ; the situation .â¢â .:. to I
be one -that calls for a new and clean deal j t
in the shape, of an open primary, and to
what extent will it be a ' proxy . meeting,
with Gavin McNab voting the proxies? v'
It r was generally thought yesterday that J
not more than 80 of 60 of the 103 members '
would answer rollcall to-day. The Buck- | Â«
leyites concede, that > the proxy , Business ' i
will defeat them, if they are defeated, and [ c
! . -./â¢ :.â ..â '
Gavin McNab was yesterday quite hilari
ous over the prospects or victory he
thought he paw before him.
The interior delegates have generally
taken lately the position that they will
wait and hear the evidence before they will
dec Me.
The question that will arise to-day will
be, as lias been often explained, whether
or not the State Central Committee shall
give the Junta the prestige of official recog
nition by resolution and the issuance to it
alone of the call for the State convention.
This would be only. a matter of prestige,
but it would b!*"a ::reat advantage and
victory for Gavin McNab.
The Burkleyites claim to have "the" reg
ular local party organization, are pre
pared with abl': orators, witnesses and af
fidavits to prove the regularity of their
organization and that the Junta faction is
a minority born in trickery. To-day the
old liners will be championed at the
meeting by Julge Ferral, George R. B.
Hayes, Peter F. Dunne and others.
The position of the Buckleyites is, first,
that the ttate Central Committee has no
initial right to interfere; that its sole duty
is to can a state convention, if two fac
tions come before it and ask it to act as a j
committee of arbitration then it may do j
something.
It is planned that the fight shall come !
up on the presentation of a resolution j
instructing the secretary of the State j
Central Committee to issue the call for the |
State Convention to the Democratic or- j
ganization of San Francisco of which W. |
Jr. Suhivan is chairman and John F. Mc-
Govern secretary.
This would extend official recognition to
the Junta, though if it is adopted the
Buckleyites will go right ahead as the reg
ular party organization, send its delegates
to the State Convention and light it out
there. But the Buckleyites don't want tho
damage that would thus result, in the way |
of moral and political effect.
The committee oi twenty-rive appointed '
at the meeting of the Buckley general !
committee last Thursday night to take I
charge of the case before the State Central !
Committee held a meeting at 935 Market '
street last night and chose a sub-commit- j
tee to do the talking and fighting to-day. j
This committee is asfollows:: George R.
B. Hayes, Keel B. Terry, M. J. Donuvap,
Henry Ach, Jowph Rothschild, James H.
O'Brien, D. fid. Gavigan. James Devoto
and James C. Nealon.
When tne resolution mentioned is of
fered to-day some member of the commit
tee friendly to the Buckley side will ob- j
ject to iis consideration, on the ground ;
that the committee has, by all Demo- ,
cratic principles and prestige, no jurisdic- j
tion to thus intrude itself into local politi- j
cal affairs and judge and regulate them.
It can only act as A committee of arbitra- :
tion, when both sides agree to present a ;
case.
The committee will probably decide to |
proceed to do something, and then the de- i
inand will be made, and undoubtedly con- i
ceded, that representatives of the "regu- j
lar" local organization be given an oppor- !
tunity to be heard before they arc cxc- j
cuted.
Then, according to what appeared yes- I
terday to be the favorable course of" things, j
Gavin McNab will object to their being ;
given a bearing unless they vÂ» r iil agree in J
advance to be bound by thederision of the j
State Central Committee. Mr. McNab, j
feeling confident of a majority of the com- j
mi tee, will agree to submit his case with- j
mi reservation and abide by the judgment, j
rhon the h>bt wili develop.
The Bucklfyitcs wiil not agree to sub- ,
ruit to anything in advance. They will |
*ay that if the committee wants to be fair j
they will accept its arbitration on the basis ;
that there be lield an open primary in the ;
selection of the officers of which both sides j
Â«hail fairly share. In other words, they I
will offer to meet the Junta at a primary !
ilection.
Quite a number of State Central com- j
mitteemen arrived in the City last night. I
Few or none from the interior would com
nit themselves on the local situation. All
wanted to "hear the case first."
Daggett controls several of the commit
tee, and they and others who are controlled
n other ways will "go down the line" for
McNab. Many of the members were open j
:o conviction as to what ought to be done
n the interest of tha party. Then there
ire the proxies.
Ihe Burkleyites say that the calling of
the meeting for a Saturday afternoon was
1 scheme to shut off debate and fair in
vestigation through the members wanting
to hurry through and get home, and de
bate and investigation are what the Buck
leyites want and what Gavin McNab does
nut want.
Next to the loca' fight the only thing of
interest, unless some anti-railroad resolu
tions are introduced, will be the selection
of a place to hold the State convention.
Stockton began its campaign earliest,
but last evening Sacramento was making
the most noise and feeling continent of
winning.* The last time the convention
was held in Stockton was in 1884. That
was the famous Stockton convention. It
is said that John iJagsrett has bitter memo
ries of Stockton, and that his influence
will not go to that city.
Sacramento has not had the Democratic
convention for about seventeen year?, and
the Sacramentans were declaring last nipht i
that it is time tsioy saw one.
They hold that it cuts no figure that the ;
Republican and Populist conventions are i
going there this year.
Isidor Alexander was the first Sacra
mento hustler to appear. Last evening he j
was joined by M. R. Baird and P. J. I
Shields, who are with him on the com- |
mittep, and by a committee of citizens ii>
Muding William Beckman and Postmaster
Fox.
W. M. Gibson led the delegation of Stock
ion workers that appeared about the hotels
ast evening.
BUDD MUST BOW TO LAW.
Some Cold Legal Facts Which
Confront the State's
Executive.
Impeachmnt and Mandamus Threaten
H:m if Lieutenant - Governor Is
Omitted From His Proclamation.
If Governor BucM carries out the pro
gramme whi h he is raid to be c< ntempiai
iiiK of omitting to provide for the election
of a Lienn nant-GuVemor in hia coming
proclamation it is the opinion of enfinent
lawyers that lie will fi rid a deal of cold,
hard law to explain away. Tiie object of
this omission is, of course, to continue his
nominee, Jeter, in office, thus insuring a
Democratic administration in case the
gubernatorial chair should by any means
become vtcant.
To do this it In reported that he intend.?
to go contrary to the obvious spirit of the
statutes and the unmistakable will of the
popple who adopted the State constitu
tion on the pretense of what he considers
serviceable technicalities in tliecode provis
ions. That those technicalities are mate
rial is not generally believed by legal au
thorities.
Article V of the State constitution
reads:
When any office shall from any cause, be
come vucant, and no mode is provided by the
constitution or law for filling such vacancy,
the Governor phall have po^er to fill such
vacancy by granting a commission, which will
expire at tiie end of the next ?esslon of the
legislature, or at the next election by the
people.
This section seems to decisively deter
mine the ultimate method of tilling vacan
cies, but to provide against any possible
temporary vacancy of tbe important office,
section 15 of the same article provide?,
after stating Â»he manner in which the
Lieutenant-Uovernor is to be elected, that.
"If during a vacancy of the office of Gov
ernor, the Lieutenant-Governor shall be
impeached, displaced, resign or die, or be
come incapable of performing the duties
of his office, or be absent from the State,
the Pr sident pro tern pore of the Senate
shall act as Governor until the vacancy be
In view of the preceding article, the
purport of this section is obvious.
The Political Code virtually re-enacts
the provisions of the constitution and
further says in section 999:
When any office becomes vacant and no
mode is provided by law for tilling *ucn
vaeaÂ»ev the Governor must nil such vacancy
by erantin* a commission, to expire at the
nexfse"sionof the Legislature, or at the next
election by the people.
Section 1001 provides that:
A vaeancv occurring in the office of either
the Secretary of Slate. Controller, Treasurer,
Attoruev-General, Surveyor-General or clerk
of the Supreme Court must be tilled by a per
son appointed by tbe Governor, who shall hold
| office for the nnexpired term.
It is upon the omission of Lieutenant-
Governor in this section that Governor
Budd is said to rely for his authority to
withhold a proclamation for that ofhee,
yet it would seem that the very omission
here brinus it under the section of the
constitution which urovides for the man
ner of filling offices for which no mode is
! particularly described. The spirit of the.
| section providing for the appointment of
| a temporary occupant for this orh.ee ap
; appears by analogy in section 2 of article
I V of the" constitution, where it is pro
! vided that "vacancies which occur in
| offices during a recess of the Legislature,
I the appointment to which is vested in the
Governor and Senate, or in the Legisla
ture, must be filled by the Governor; but
the persons so appointed can only hold
office until the adjournment of the next
ses s ion of the Legislature."
Political sections 1053 and 1054 provide
for the issuance of .a proclamation at least
thirty days prior to an election which
"must contain a statement of the time of
election and of the office* to be filled." It
is intimated that this section is another on
which the Governor reiies to retain Jeter
in office. His medus operandi will be to
wait until exactly 30 daj> prior to election.
He will then issue his proclamation, and
any proceedings commenced after that
date will be too late to result in a va'id
election for Lieutennnt-Governor, as it has
been held that a special election without
the full time of notice prescribed is illegal.
In speaking of this matter Attorney John
E. Richards said :
It is evident from the law on the preposition
that it is the duty of th<- Governor tol.^uea
proclamation for the election of a Lieutenant-
Governor in tho faH. Should he neglect this
duty the people have two remedies. One is by
writ of mandamus. The people can sue for a
writ on the showing that the Governor threat,
ens to issue a proclamation leaving oft' this
office.
It is true some doubt has been expressed as
to the availability of this remedy, when di
rected aguinst one of the three co-ordinate
branches of the Government, but California
cases have repeatedly held that where the
act is one Â»>urely ministerial anil not the sub
ject of discretion the Governor oi a state is
liable to mandate.
In a case reported in the thirty-ninth Cali
fornia it Ik said : "If the act is enjoined by law
and the non-fulfillment of It is a wrong to a
particular person that particular person may
apply for a writ of mandate."
In this case perhaps any person deprived of
his right to vote lor a Lieutenant-Governor
would be held to have suctained a particular
wrong. At any rate by that time there will be
regularly nominated candidates for the office,
and these will certainly have sustained a par
ticular wrong.
ShoulJ the people deem it inadvisable to
employ mandamus pfooeedlngl a .-<econd
remedy is at hand, namely, impeachment.
In view of the plain provisions of the law, tt
is not likely the Governor will run the risk of
impeachment by what will undoubtedly be a
Republican Senate. Moreover, it is the gen.
eral view among Republicans that when Mr.
Millard died the President pro tern. of the Sen
ate became Lieo tenant-Governor. Should Mr.
Jeter remain in office it is not unlikely that a
Republican Senate would recognize its own
officer. Governor Budd would then be put in
a dilemma. The principle exempting coÂ«
ordinate branches of the government from
mandamus, which is urged with doubtful
pertinence in his defense, would be unques
tioned where the Senate was concerned, and
the Democratic executive wou'd be without
any possible means of forcing the recognition
of his nominee.
Other attorneys expressed themselves in
a similar vein.

much the best end of it. George Palmer'
Mount McGregor II and Toano all stepped
over the plate at remunerative odds, but for
the most part were allowed to run loose.
There was a decidedly Arctic tinge to
the air, and the weather prophet pre
dicted either a typhoon or a snowstorm,
but fortunately neither was experienced.
The sport was good and the crowd large,
as usual. Eddie Jones carried off the
riding honors, getting two winners past
the wire in front and once finishing
second.
A coap was tried with Louis Ezell's old
black horse Dungarven in tbe mile and a
sixteenth selling event, but the aged racer
proved unequal to the occasion. Eddie
Jones, on the 6 to 5 favorite, Cabrillo, took
the lead after passing the stand and took
no chances thereafter. He said "adios"
to Cochran on Dungarven at the far turn,
and, gradually opening up a cap of day
light, won by "four lengths in 1 :48 U. The
black horse finished about the same dis
tance in front of Hidago. The latter horse
opened a warm 7 to 5 second choice, but
1 receded to four, the smart ones claiming
that little Slaughter could not do him jus
tice, and he did make a sad mess of it.
The great Crescendo's chestnut sister.
Dolce, made her public debut under very
unfavorable auspices, for she was left at
I the post in the two-year-old race, along
i with Straggler and The Roman. When
i the barrier was raised Geo. Palmer, at 7
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1.84*6.
to 1 in the betting, carrying President
SprecKels' red, white and blue colors, soon
parted company with the remaining five
starters, winning easily by a couple of
lengths in 50^ seconds for* the four fur
longs. St. Dunstin, the 7to 5 choice, fin
ished third behind Early Notice. The post
odds against Dolce were 4 to 1.
The unlucky Walter J finally struck a
winning gait and landed the purse in the
second event of the day. a six-furlong run.
He opened an 11 to 5 choice, receding in
the books until it was 13 to 5 against either
Walter or Doubttul. Macklin on the
former had his mount in the lead after a
quarter had been traveled, and he had no
trouble in winning by half a length from
Brametta. All Smoke was third.
The erratic Mt. McGregor II was the
startling surprise in the seven-furlontr
snin. Going to the post 12 to 1. Jones had
the big colt in front, almost from the jump
and he won romping in 1:28}4, with Babe
Murphy and Mobalasca, each at 6 to 5 in
the ring, trailing in behind in the order
named.
Sam Hildreth's chestnut gelding Wil
liam Pinkerton, was an even money
chance for the fifth event over six furlongs,
and leading the entire distance, passed the
judges an easy winner by a length from
Judge Dennv. Sam Leake, the7tossecond
choice, ran disappointingly.
The betting on the concluding race of
the card was very open, there being no
very pronounced choice. When the horses
were called, Tim Murphy was first in de
mand at threes, with Service, Shieldbearer
and Sir Richard fancied in the order
named. Practically friendless, with 15 tol
about him, old Toano headed Shieldbearer
at the end of a quarter and came in a
shifty winner, a scant length before Serv
ice. Tim Murphy was unplaced, Shield
bearer finishing in the show.
Track and Paddock Items.
The card for this afternoon is a grand
one, seven well-filled events being down
for decision. The feature of the day's
sport is the General Arthur cigar stake,
at one mile and a sixteenth, with one of
the greatest fields that has yet faced the
starter at the meeting. Among the prob
able starters ia the crack Libertine, asked
to carry top weisrhtâ l2o pounds. With
Sister Mary, Installator, Wheel of Fortune
and Pepper also in, a new track record
sh ould come very near being hung up.
W. L. fetanfield's consistent gelding
George Miller has placed so many races to
his credit that many racegoers have a cu
riosity to see the "Kansas City Hindoo
s>how"his caliber in company with some of
the "best of 'em." He will be piven an
opportunity on the coming "ladies' day"
at lngleside.
The management has arranged a special
race at hve and a half furlongs, for a $1000
purse, weights to be 10 pounds below the
scale. The starters with their weights will
be: George Miller 110, Libertine 113, Belli
coso 109, Magnet 109 and Yankee Doodle
97. This event will excite more interest
than any that has yet been given since the
advent of the Eastern division.
Dick Ledgett did some great "rooting"
for Walter J when that cult was leading
his field to the wire in the second race.
Dick owns imp. True Biiton, sire of the
youngster, and is very proud of the black
horse's record as a getter of winners.
George Barren, the wealthy young turf
man, has booked six of his fnares to be
bred to Ledgett's horse. Following is the
list: Lottie L, Carasade, Monday mare,
Fabiola; mare by Kingston and a mare by
Judge McKinstry-Ursula.
Sir Reel refused to break when the bar
rier was rained, and the stewards decided
to refuse his entry in the future.
PARDONED, BUT DYING.
William Mugarrieta Has Only Kscaped
San Quentin to End His Life
at Home.
There was a sad scene at the Sausalito
ferries yesterday when the steamer that
connects with the San Quentin train
arrived. A convict who had been pardoned
by the Governor was on his way home to
die. J"u?t as he was being welcomed by
his mother and sisters, a violent nt of
coughing seized him, and a few minutes
later blood was flowing from his mouth.
A violent hemorrhage followed, and for a
time it seemed as though he would die on
the wharf. The police ambulance was
summoned, but by the time it reached the
ferries, the man had partially recovered
and was driven home in a hack which his
relatives had in readiness.
The unfortunate man is William Mugar
rieta. and he was sent to San (^uentin in
February. 1895, for robbery. Even at that
time he was in very delicate state of health
and hiQ attorney made a strong plea on his
behalf. The Judge was inexorable, how
ever, and gave him the full sentence.
Ever since his relatives have been trying
to get his term commuted. Governor
Budd would not acquiesce until last
Wednesday, when the prisoner had two
hemorrhages. Warden Hale telegraphed
the Governor that the man was dying and
recommended his pardon. The Governor
at once acted on the suggestion, and Mu
garrieta was set free.
HYACINTHS AND VIOLETS
California State Floral Society
Holds a Successful Ex
hibition.
Exquisite Display of Bulbous Plants,
Roses, Tulips and Wild
Flowers.
The California State Floral Society held
a very successful meeting yesterday at the
maple-room annex of the Falace Hotel.
The display of flowers was varied and
beautiful. Violets of gigantic size and deli
cate perfume were moat in evidence, al
though the tall stems and white blossoms
of the narcissus, togetner with multi-col
ored roses, tulips, wild flowers and quanti
ties of bulbous plants, did much to com
plete the excellence of the exhibit.
An entertaining paper on the iris was
read by Mrs. 8. L. Walker.
"The Iris Germanica," said she, "should
be in every gardenâ it is exceedingly beau
tiful and easy blooming. Buddhist.priests
take a lively interest in the plant, and the
Buddhist shrines are largely decorated with
the iris. It should be sown early in the
spring and will Â«row well in any rich soil."
The treasurer was instructed to hereafter
pay the premiums as soon as awarded, in
stead of waiting until the awards are ap
proved by the board of directors.
The advisability of introducing at the
next spring exhibition the featurs of prac
tical demonstrators in the cultivation of
plants was discussed. This will be for the
benefit of amateurs, and the work of trans
ferring planty, budding and grafting will
be carried on by competent persons.
The society has in progress a grand
azalea show at the nurseries, at Lombard
and Baker streets. The display of azaleas
is said to be particularly tine.
The thirteenth semi-annual exhibition
or spring exhibition will be held at the
Palace for three days, commencing April
30. The entire east side of the hotel, which
includes the ladies' reception-rooms and
Marble and Maple halis, will.be devoted to
the exhibit.
The exhibits yesterday were: Native
bulbs, twenty varieties, by Carl Purely,
Ukiah; Golden Gate violet, Professor
Emory E. Smith ; new extraordinary varie
ties of violets. Duchess of Marlborough and
Princess of Penoea, grown by De La Koche.
The following premiums were awarded:
For the new collection of violets, to Mrs.
G. C. Boss of Belmont. For the best col
lection of bulbous cut flowers, Mrs. E.
Lewelling of ban Lorenzo.
A Coventry firm is executing an order
for 150 bicycles for the use of officers of
the Salvation Army.
REV. MONSIGNOR NUGENT
The Liverpool Divine Will Ar
rive in This City Next
Week.
WORKS FOB HOMELESS BOTS.
How He Organized the Yonth of Eng
land Into Great Temperance
Bands.
Very Rev. Monsignor Nugent of Liver
pool, England, is coming to San Francisco.
He is now at LO3 Angeles. There is a
probability that he will accompany the
Archbishop on tho return of the prelate
from the south the latter part of next
week.
The Monsignor will stay in San Francisco
for a week or more. He will be the guest
of the Archbishop while here. The Mon
signor is well known as a lecturer and
writer. He is the editor of the Liver
pool Catholic Times, which is said to have
the largest circulation and to be the roost
influential Catholic publication in the Eng
lish-speaking world.
Monsignor N agent is a canon of the ca
thedral of Liverpool. He has always been
prominent in rescue work and social re
form in that city. He invested several
thousand pounds of his personal estate in
founding and maintaining a home for
newsboys.
He is regarded as one of the pillars of
the diocese ot Liverpool and was a great
favorite with the late Bishop of Liverpool.
He is idolized by the people and a great
favorite with all classes by reason of his
broad and tolerant religious views.
Though advanced in years he is exceed
ingly active and his mental faculties are
unimpaired. In personal relations with
all he is simplicity and directness personi
fied. He has always been very charitable,
but is recognized as an able financier. None
of his charitable enterprises has been
known to fall through by reason of poor
management.
Monsignor Nugent is perhaps the best
known and most popular man in Liverpool
of Irish ancestry; he is a great favorite
with the sons of Erin who form so consid
erable a proportion of the city's popula
tion, while Englishmen, whether Catholic
or Protestant, look upon him with much
favor. His charities, so wise in their ad
ministration and so tar-reaching in their
results, have endeared him to the hearts
of all. He was the first to establish the
League of the Cross in England. This
organization has enjoyed a wonderful
growth in that country, and has spread to
America, where numerous bauds of young
temperance workers are springing up. It
is after the English organization that the
League of the Cross in San Francisco was
planned.
Monsignor Nugent will doubtless receive
a warm reception from the Irish and
Catholic people of San Francisco. Already
the officers of the League of the Cross are
considering arrangements for his re
ception.

ATTACHED HILL'S REALTY
The Mining Man Sued on
Heavy Promissory
Notes.
Stock Speculations Get Him Into
Financial Straitsâ Heavily
Mortgaged.
Sheriff Whelan took formal possession
of sixteen pieces of property belonging to
John T. Hill, the millionaire minintr man
who kept a record of his periods of hilarity
in a "jag book," yesterday on attachments
issued in a suit begun by Charles P. Har
ris, the Pine-street stockbroker.
This property consists of business blocks
on Battery, Sansome, Broadway and other
downtown streets and is said to be worth
|500,000. Several years ago Hill, who is
now president of the Benton Consolidated
Mining Company, was one of the heaviest
operators on Pine street and carried heavy
blocks of stock in many then prominent
mines. Through his speculating he be
came indebted to Harris to the extent of
several thousand dollars, the latter carry
ing him at times when funds for margins
were not readily available. About a year
ago Harris asked for a settlement, but as
the mining man was not in funds at the
time he persuaded Harris to take notes to
the extent of over $18,000 at 7 per cent in
terest.
One of these notes, amounting to $1000,
fell due in August last, and a suit on it is
still pending. Day before yesterday notes
for $83S8 became due, and as the coin was
not forthcoming suit was begun.
Hill is said to be heavily involved and
the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society
holds mortgages, executed in 1894, on his
real estate to the extent of $250,000, nearly
all of which has been invested in mining
ventures.
Attorney George W. Fehell, -who repre
sents Harris in the litigation, said last
evening that while the mortgage held by
the Hibernia Bank was a heavy one, there
was little doubt that the property was
worth far more than the obligation, and
that the notes would be satisfied before the
attachments were released. Harris also
holds other notes against Hill to the ex
tent of $8500.
TRUNK LINE IN CHINA.
Colonel Jefferds Proposes to Build a
Koad 1400 Miles Long From
Peking; to Canton.
Colonel M. R. Jefferds of New York, who
has been six months in China in reference
to the building of a grand trunk, north
and south railroad, is at the Palace. The
road is to be 1400 miies long and extend
from Peking to Hankow, and thence to
Canton.
Colonel Jefferds claims to have raised
10,000,000 taels in support of the road al
ready. He says, however, that the Chi
nese, as yet having had no experience
with railroads, are not fully assured that
railways are beneficial to the country.
They have suggested that he see the Chi
nese merchants here, and if they are will
ing to commend the road and aid it in
every way they can, they will come to the
front and subscribe more. A tael is $1 35,
Mexican money.
Through Prince Kung. Superintendent
of Military Affairs, and Prince Ch'ng, the
assistant, representing the Emperor of
China, Colonel Jefferds received a docu
ment somewhat in the nature of a conces
sion, and authorizing him to go ahead
with his enterprise. The cost of the road
is estimated to be 40,000 taels a mile.
However, only the section from Peking
to Hankow, a distance of 750 miles, is to be
at first considered. The capital stock is to
consist of 100,000 shares of 100 taels each.
Colonel Jefferds, after being here a week,
will go to New York and Londen in the
interest of his enterprise. A large portion
of the route proposed is over almost level
plains.
Baldwin Theater.
It Is announced that in consequence of the
success of "A Milk White Flag" at the Baldwin
Theater, a performance will be given every
Sunday night during the run of the piece.
Loss of Blood and Dropsy
From the Nug?et, Chehalis, Wash.
The neighbors called her a walking corpse.
For fifteen years she had suffered from loss of
blood and dropsy. She had not the strength to
standalone. She had spent thousands of dol
lars with the doctors and had been unable to
find relief. Her case was considered hopeless.
That is the experience of Mrs. C. Reed, a well
known lady of Chehalis, Wash.
A Nugget reporter called upon her at her
home last Tuesday. She was willing to be in
terviewed, she said, if sbe could be the means
of pointing out to other unfortunates the way
to recovery and good health.
"It has been over fifteen years since the
malady asserted itself." said Mrs. Reed. "Since
then, until within the last few months, I never
knew what it was to be well for a single day. I
could not sleep. My appetite went away and I
began to lose flesh. This continued
for years. I became so weak I could
not wait upon myself. I had to have
the help of others to dress und undress, even
to walk from one room to another. I lost all
my strength. In addition I had dropsy of the
blood. My limbs were swollen and nothing I
could do seemed to afford me relief. The doc
tdrs said I must take iron to strengthen and
invigorate my blood. I took ironâ took it by
the tÂ»ottle and by the box ; took it morning,
noon and night; but it did no good and I had
finally lost all hope.
"At last I saw an account of Dr. Williams'
Pink rills for Pale People. I thought this
fitted my case exactly and I tried to get some
of the pills. They were not kept at the drug
stores here and I had to send to Olympia.
They came finally, however. I began to take
them and experienced relief immediately.
I sent for two more boxes to the Dr. Williams'
Company at Schenectady, N. V., and by the
time I had taken them I felt like a new woman.
I have been taking them occasionally since
then.
"It was two years ago that I began to use
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. I was sixty years
of age th.en and had not been able to do my
housework for many years. Now lam able
to care for myself, to do my own work, and 1
can waik lone distances without being espe
cially fatiguea.
"I think my cure is a marvelous one and is
due entirely to the Pink Pills for Pale People.
Without them I fear I should have been dead
before now.
"Since my cure has become known the drug
gists here nave always kept the pills, and I
do not have to send away for them any more.
1 have recommended them to several of my
neighbors, and I know that they have done
much good in more than one case similar to
my own."
In order to confirm this statement beyond all
doubt Mrs. Reed offered to make affidavit to
Its trutn and the affidavit is here presented:
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 14th
day of May, 1895.
J. M. Kepner, Notary Public.
Dr. Williams 1 Pink Pills contain all the ele
ments to give new life and richness to the
blood and restore shattered nerves. They are
for sale by all druggists, or may be had by
mail irom Dr. Williams' Medicine Company.

students of Berkeley and Stanford uni

SATURDAY..... MARCH 14, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Republican harmony is assured.
The Democratic rumpus has the floor.
So long as there is no deficit in the duck
shooting G rover doesn't worry.
They have more weather in the East
than we do, but we have the best of it.
The Brown case is ended and there is a
breath of relief in every breeze that blows.
Russia has not put her foot into Africa,
but it is by no means certain she has not
had a hand in it.
Bayard has been shooting off his mouth
again, but this tiuie he wasn't loaded and
nothing was hurt.
Campbell of Ohio says he won't run. and
thus does another Democratic possibility
go rolling off the log.
It is now said the British Blue Book on
Venezuela is full of garbled statements,
and the expected has happened.
As KingMenelek is said to be advancing
slowly, the Italian have a chance to get
peace with honor by beating him in afoot
race.
The Senate is so accustomed to postpon
ing things that even a motion to delay is
nearly always laid over for further consid
eration.
The anti-option bill, of which 90 much
was expected, has gone to pot. The House
Committee on Agriculture dropped it in
the i=oup.
The wisest thing the Democratic party
can dcrts to follow its great leader and go
duck-shooting and fishing for the rest of
the year.
The report that Cleveland objects to mid
dle-aged women riding the bicycle was
undoubtedly started by some one who
wishes to boom the custom.
A mid the noises of the time it is worth
noting that Carlisle has relapsed into si
lence and quit guessing when the revenues
will begin to yield a surplus.
The withdrawals of gold from the treas
ury have now run up to about $150,000 a
day, and it won't be longbefore the reserve
is down to the danger point again.
Huntington's statement that seven
eightbs of the press of California favor the
funaing bill is a final and conclusive proof
that the old mans memory is completely
gone.
In saying "The Republican party is the
protective tariff" Mr. Clarkson has ex
pressed a whole platform in a phrase terse
enough to serve as a motto for a campaign
banner.
From the rapidity w^th which the gar
ment-makers' strike is spreading in the
East, it is probable clothing will be so short
this year that everybody will have to wear
knee-breeches.
By the steady process of declining, one
after another, the Democratic leaders
are forcing the party into a position where
it must either renominate Cleveland or go
out of business.
It won't take more than a hurried sur
vey of the situation for the Democratic
State Committee to find out what kind of
a time the Buckley parrot and the Kainey
monkey have been having here.
The bill providing for the establishment
of a naval station at Goat Island has been
reported favorably to the Senate, and from
tbe way things are moving we may see the
new station before we see the new post
office.
From the frequency with which Senator
Hill appears as a defender of the admin
istration, there seems to be something more
than a possibility that he may yet show up
as the administration candid ate for the
Presidency.
Between popular sympathy with the
cause of Cuban independence and patri
otic indignation at the insults to America
committed in Spain, Cleveland has a
Bplendid opportunity to make another
grand-stand play.
The Senate has passed a bill creating a
body to be known as "The Art Commission
of the United States," and while such a
commission mieht promote our art the
chances are it will simply sit down on it
and draw a salary.
Senator Sherman's heated question, "If
there is no state of war in Cuba, where in
the name of hell does war exist?" may not
have been expressed in what Senator Hoar
regards as the proper way, but it was perti
nent to the occasion.
It now appears that the protest of
Havana merchants against the action of
Congress was obtained by forcing most of
the signatures', and it therefore stands as
a protest against Spanish methods rather
than against this country.
General Weyler is something of a politi
cal boss as well as a butcher. lie is said
to have put up all the tickets to be voted for
in the coming election in Havana, and,
besides, will appoint the men who are to
count the vote. He has a sure thing.
Tho proposal to put upon the angel of
the City Hall a set of movable wings at
tached to gearing, so that when the wind
hlew thny would generate electricity, has
the merit of novelty and utility, but it
would never do to let the idea get abroad
that the tutelary angel of our City is a
windaaiJJ.
REPUBLICAN PLATFORMS.
The Examiner of yesterday, in entertain
ing its readers with criticisms on the plat
forms adopted by the Republicans of lowa
and Ohio, declared the utterances of the
first to be vague on the tariff and those of
the second to be vague on the currency
issue. The lowa idea on the tariff, it
thought, would suit Democrats as well as
Republicans, while the Ohio idea ou the
money question, it declared, would suit
nobody at all. From the judgment thus
pronounced it drewno conclusion in ex
press terms, but evidently intended the
reader to infer that Democrats have a
lighting chance against Republicans this
year, and that to find exercise for their
energies are not of necessity compelled to
resort to fighting one another.
The hope which our contemporary has
thus held out to the warring factions of
the party whose State committee meets to
day has, however, no foundation to rest
upon. The lowa platform on the tariff is
an indorsement of the record of Senator
Allison on the subject, and there is no
vagueness in that record. He has taken
part in the making of three tariffs for this
country, and in every one of them his
handiwork has been shown in the upbuild
ing of protection in the broadest and full
est sense. He was also the man who
brought about in the Senate the adoption
of Blame's great plan of reciprocity in con
nection with the McKinley tariff. His
record, therefore, includes protection and
reciprocity, and is as definite, distinct,
clear and luminous as that of any states
man who ever served the American peo
ple in the halls of Congress.
Equally unfounded is the charge of
vagueness made against tlie Ohio declara
tion on the currency question and most
futile is the assertion that it will please
nobody. The declaration is the same that
has been made by the Republican party
on the subject since the controversy be
gan, and is the one which the people have
repeatedly indorsed by overwhelming ma
jorities. The essential part of it is em
bodied in the phrase "We favor bimetal
lism and demand the use of both gold and
silver as standard money." On that plat
form in Ohio McKinley was raised to of
fice and Bushell after him, by majorities
so large that Democracy was well nigh
swept from the State, nor can there be any
question that the people of the Union, as a
whole, will give an equally strong support
to whatever Presidential candidate stands
on that platform in the coming campaign.
On the same day the Republican coaven
tions were held in lowa and Ohio there
was a Democratic convention in Rhode
Island. The Examiner would do well to
study the declarations made by that con
vention before it again undertakes to criti
cize Republican platforms. The dispatches
of the day stated that the platform adopted
by the Rhode Islanders ignored National
issues altogether. That is the Democratic
platform so far as it has been madeâ a
platform of nothing.
A NAREOW ESCAPE.
The fact that the steamship City of Rio
Janeiro has not been lost is a subject, for
rejoicing, but the Pacific Mail Company de
serves none of the credit. The story is sim
ply this: The ship was supplied with coal
sufficient only for a run in fine weather,
and her sailing power was inadequate to
make headway against adverse winds.
W hen she had covei-ed 2000 of the 3000 miles
between Honolulu and Yokohama her coal,
under the stress of severe head storms, \v;is
exhausted, and it was impossible to pro
ceed 1000 miles further to her destination,
i^he was compelled to put back 2000 miles
to Honolulu, flying before the storm, to se
cure coal. Even there she had great diffi
culty by reason of the fact that her owners
have no supply station on the island. Her
mastÂ«r managed to borrow coal and then
proceeded on his way. In time the ship
will reach Yokohama in safety.
Meanwhile the passengers were sub
jected to a terrible strain of fear and
anxiety, their business suffered, and their
friends on shore were in great distress.
Every life on board was in peril, to say
nothing of the valuable cargo, including a
million in treasure. Had the steamer been
coaled properly before leaving San Fran
cisco all of these sufferings, losses and
anxieties would have been avoided, nut
there was a very heavy demand for space
on the vessel, and an adequate supply of
coal could have been taken only at the sac
ritice of considerable money ready to be
paid for freight. The company was well
aware of the possibility of such a storm as
that encountered, but it proceeded on the
chance that none would occur and that the
trip would be made without accident.
It was just such a policy as this that
caused the wreck of the Colima on the
southern coast some months ago. That
steamer also belonged to the Pacific Mail
Company. The deck was loaded with
lumber. Everything would have gone
smoothly had not a violent storm been
encountered, but when it came the top
heavy ship was unable to live, and she
foundered, drowning many persons and
destroying much property. In all prob
ability the Colima would have ridden tbe
storm safely had she not been made top
heavy.
AN AVOIDABLE DANGEK.
A study of the list of those who have
been killed by cable and electric cars would
show that a very large number were
crushed by the meeting of cars. The case
in Oakland, in which two little girls lost
their lives, is illustrative of the prevalent
danger. They had waited for a car to pass,
and not observing one approaching from
the opposite direction and unable to see it
by reason of the intervention of the car
which they had avoided stepped in front of
it and were run down and killed. It will
be found that many children thus lose
their lives, as they cannot be expected to
be so careful as adults; but the list of such
casualties by no means concerns them
alone.
While the victim is unable to see the car
concealed by the one which he has avoided,
the gripman or motorman of that car
likewise cannot see the victim. The rem
edy for this would be the requirement that
when cars meet one of them should be re
quired to stop until the other bas passed
on and left the view clear, and should pro
ceed very slowly until it is entirely clear of
the other. It should further be required
that when two cars meet and one of them
stops to discbarge a passenger the
other car also should stop, and remain still
until the other car has passed on.
It has been suggested that the teachers
of the public schools urge these rules con
stantly upon the pupils: "1. Look both
ways when crossing a street or alighting
from a car. 2. Never try to cross the street
when a car or team is near. 3. Do not
board or leave a moving car. 4. Always
leave a car from the right-hand side." The
first of these admonitions covers the danger
here mentioned, but net sufficiently, and
perhaps an ordinance regulating the speed
at which cars may pass one another may
be necessary to eliminate ii altogether.
Of course, any such requirement would
not reduce the obligation of the companies
to furnish their cars with efficient fenders.
Those on some of the electric cars could
not Lave been more ingeniously devised to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1806,
mangle the unfortunates after tripping
them. The subject of fenders seems to
have been lost sight of lately, and doubtless
the companies hope, by the employment
of careful operatives, to prevent the fre
quent sacrifice of lives and an ensuing agi
tation, which would require an expendi
ture of a large amount of money in
equipping the cars for the protection of
life.
Even the best fender that can be devised,
however, is not a pleasant thing to encoun
ter, and fendorsarenot the only safeguards
that might be employed. The unfortunate
phase of the matter is that the cruelty of
some of the fenders in use causes them to
be charged with all the evils that the pres
ent system of operation embodies. The
question is larger than that of fenders.
PROGRESSIVE ARIZONA.
The report made by Charles F. Hoff in a
Call interview concerning affairs in Ari
zona is highly encouraging. Under the
stimulus of a prosperous year for cattle,
an extension of irrigation and the develop
ment of numerous gold mines, the cities
of Tucson, Phoenix and Prescott are eager
to make improvements which shall put
them abreast of modern cities, and for this
purpose are appealing to Congress for per
mission to issue bonds each to the amount
of $100,000. Naturally these progressive
people chafe under the cumbersome Terri
torial regulations which require them to
seek authorization from Congress for the
performance of acts, the value of which
they alone are competent to judge, and
accordingly are moved to secure laws
which will permit them the exercise of a
wider liberty of action.
The interests of California are so closely
identified with those of Arizona that a
nearer relation than has heretofore existed
should be established, and the influence of
California's delegation in Congress should
be thrown into the scale with Arizona's
needs. Unlike every other State or Terri
tory of the great West not bordering on the
ocean, Arizona has no mountain barrier
separating it from the coast. It is natur
ally a part of California, being very similar
in climatic and other conditions to South
ern California. Under a higher state of
development it would be in a position to
command the commercial facilities of the
Pacific both by land across California and
down the lower reaches of the Colorado
River to the Gulf ot California.
The development of Arizona would mean
a draft upon California for some of our
most valuable products, including lumber
and bituminous rock. It would have the
further effect of creating a local rail traffic
which would tend to reduce the overland
transportation charges with which Califor
nia is burdened. Being convenient to
Mexico the Territory is in a position to
establish commercial relations with that
republic which would be valuable to our
entire Nation.
California and Arizona present the best
opportunities in America for the invest
ment of capital in the development of rich
native resources. While our State is much
better known Arizona, with all its vast
wealth of soil and minerals, is practically
an undiscovered country, its development,
rapid as it has been in recent years, not
nearly approaching the volume of its
native wealth. It can produce many of
the line products which have given Cali
fornia its fame, its climate is Wonderfully
healthful and it lies convenient to the
markets of Mexico and the Southern States.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The leading feature jof to-morrow's Call
will be an exhaustive discussion of the
Salvation Army, giving something of its
history, its general scheme, its work, pur
poses and discipline ana the desertion of
Ballington Booth. It will be found an
interesting review of one of tbe greatest
religious movements of history.
Adeline Knapp, in "Our Busy Streets,"
gives a graphic picture of one of the most
interesting charms that San Francisco
possesses.
"The San Bruno Light" is another of
the series of articles which have appeared
in The Sunday Call describing the light
houses of California, and it will be iound
as readable as its predecessors.
An instructive chapter from history will
be devoted to "Farragut in California," as
it will be remembered that at one time he
was in command at Mare Island.
"Marriage in Japan, 1 ' by Euphemia Bur
ton, is a delightfully written account of
the quaint customs of that country in a
matter which has an untiring human in
terest.
Those who have bewailed the extinction
of the buffalo will be pleased to learn that
here in California there has grown up a
considerable industry in the breeding of
this noble animal. The description of a
breeding-farm in this part of the State will
be read with considerable interest.
These are only a few of the special arti
cles that have been prepared for to-mor
row's issue, and besides these are tbe regu
lar Sunday departments devoted to novel
ties in the realm of science, literature, the
drama, society, children, and all the oth
ers. The Sunday Call is entirely an origi
nal production, is unlike any other Sunday
paper, and is particularly welcome to East
ern people who want to know something
about California.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
â¢'Of all the places that 1 ever got Into and
didn't want to get into again," said L. W.
Adams yesterday, at the Grand, "that place is
British Guiana.
"When I went down there, about a year ago,
to take charge of a number ol placer and
quartz mines for a New York syndicate, I
didn't know the siege I had to run.
"If I had I suppose I wouldn't have gone.
Not because the mines are not good enough,
for they are. They are really about the richest
I ever struck. Tne placers there averaged
somewhat near 16 cents a pan, so far as I pros
pected, and average quartz was about $40 a
ton. My comDany made money, and so did
about all the others there.
"We were on the Barima River, quite a long

distance up from Georgetown. Had, in fact,
to get a lot of natives and paddle in small
boats a good part of the way and twist around
waterfalls. There is a dense tropical growth
along that river, and in the boiling sun
malaria and fevers were bred. They attacked
Americans and Europeans with unusual fatal
ity. It took only a little time in many cases
for these fevers to get a grip on a man, and un
less he had a strong constitution he was
liable to be carried off. The natives stood it
well. They did not seem to be affected like
the outsiders.
"These natives worked for $1 or a little more
a day iv the mines, and I found them very
tractable and useful. My company made
money. It was really interesting to note the
development of wealth in those mines.
"The British residents down there are very
slow. There are no people like the Americans
to push forward and make themselves felt.
With them, to see that a thing was good was to
act on it. They were generally successful.
The British were too slow. Still, notwitn
standing the richness, I would not advise any
of our California miners to go to British
Guiana. I think, on the whole, they will be
happier, and in the long run as prosperous,
here."
Every actor of prominence has had his ups
and down in the profession. It is almost nec
essary that the follower ot Thespis should buck
up against the downs at some period in order
that his nature may be mellowed and h:smind
broadened by the hard and lasting impression
of experience. There was a time when Tim
Murphy was lighter in purse and heavier in
heart than he is this season. It was in the
days before he crossed Charley Hoyt's horizon
âbefore he had been given the small part of
Dodge Work in "A Brass Monkey," the acting
of which, however, gave Hoyt a "line on the
ability" of the man who was afterward to make
of "A Texas Steer" such a tremendous success.
They were the days of Murphy's callow youth,
but he already had the theatrical bee buzzing
under his headgear. It was then his wont to
organize a company of amateurs in his home
city, Washington, and go barnstorming for
weeks at a time.
On this particular trip the attenuated Mur
phy had led his aspiring actors and actresses
down into the country school district of Vir
ginia. At Culpepper there was a hall which
also did duty as an opera-house. Murphy for
gets now whether it was "Ten Nights in a Bar
room" or "Julius Caesar" which was down for
production that night. At any rate he used to
take tickets at the door until near curtain
rising time, then rusn back on the stage, make
up In a desperate hurry and be ready for his
cue.
This night at Culpepper the hosts were slow
coming out to buy tickets at 10,20 and 30
cents and the house was meager when time
compelled him to give up the door to the rural
manager and go on the stage. He severely
cautioned the house manager about letting in
people without the price and skipped to the
rear.
When Murphy obeyed his cue and stalked out
on the stage what was his amazement to find
the hayseed manager sitting in the front row.
As soon as his time and business would permit
him he went down under the stage to the door,
through which the orchestra emerges and dis
appears, and yelling at the rustic asked what
in thunder he was doing there.
Mr. Rural Manager, having in mind only the
terrible warniug Murphy had given him to
prevent the possibility of letting all his country
friends in to see the Bhow for nothing, yelled :
"That's all right, Mr. Actor; theykain'tanyof
them git in on yer. I've locked the door and
got the key in my pocket."
When Murphy finally induced him to go
back to the door there were fifty or sixty people
waiting patiently for th*e doors to open.

Our advice to the men both old and young

it and going to a country that you know not

you.
The Way to Resume.
Fresno Kcpubllcan,
Horace Greeley once remarked that the way
to resume is to resume. The idea applies with
force to a good many other things which some
people appear to think should be done in a
rvundabout way. The way to coin silver tor
instance is to coin it, and all of it which ia
taken to the mints trom the mines of this coun
try. To do anything less than this is to dis
credit the white metal and weaken its value in
comparison to the favored yellow metal.
THE WRECKERS.
All night the sea has thundered :
The wluds have fiercely reaped.
And first fruits of the harvest
Along the shore are heaped.
I watch a group of children
Upon the bearh bolow.
Glad wreckers waiting for their spoil
After the nijjht of woe.
From out the thlcklv driving mist
A dory leaps to land ;
The fisherman is ambushed by
The eager shouting band.
The boldest wrecker of them all
springs on his shoulders brown.
While others seize his brawny aims
And liercely pull him down.
They lead their captive slowly
To their stronghold by the hill;
A cottage low, where weary eyes
With tears of welcome fill.
O children! keep your prisoner fas>
Sot let him once Â«?o fr^p.
Till tempest clouds be overpast
And sunsbiue light the sea!
George T. Packard In the Youth's Companion.
AN OLD CITY NURSERY.
The oldest nursery in San Francisco and,
possibly, in California occupies a plat of land
near the corner of Battery and Oregon streets.
It is not the first nursery started in the City,
but those that were started before It have long
ago been removed to maice room for improve
ments. One would not look for a garden of
flowerÃ and young trees in this locality, as the
immediate surroundings are old tumble-down
buildings, crowded in together so closely as to
scarcely leave a square yard of land between
them.
The garden is a quaint old place that some
how makes one feel as if it did not belong
there. Everything about it is old-fashioned
and 60 cramped for room as to make the plants
seem to be gasping for air. The garden does
not occupy much more than 125 square yards,
Portion of the Oldest Nursery in San
Francisco.
and yet over 5000 plants of different kinds are
growing there. There is scarcely room to walk
between the different beds, and hundreds of
plants in the first stages of germination are in
boxes ranged one above another on a tier of
shelves. Every inch of the garden is pictur
esque and interesting, no matter from what
point it is seen.
When the nursery was first laid out it was in
the center of San Francisco. The Merchants'
Exchange occupied the building just across
Oregon street, and the Postofiioe opposite on
Battery street brought crowds down that way.
While the garden is now used mostly for grow
ing trees and vines, in the oldjdays thousands
of flowers were grown there. Most of the roses
for the first State ball in the Legislative hall
were grown in the same beds that are in use
to-day.
The nursery was started by Reed & Williams
in 1860, at the time when they attempted to
get a corner on the tree and plant business in
California. The first use of the garden was as
a supply depot. In 1863 the present proprie
tor, H. Meherin, bought them out. He made
few if any changes in the arrangement of the
garden or greennouse, so that it looks to-day
much the same as when it was first laid out.

A MODEST AND PRETTY BICYCLE
COSTUME.
Experienced riders who do not approve of
bloomers find the rather short skirt the ideal
garment. It is becoming off the wheel as well,
and is graceful and really more modest than
the longer skirts which are narrow enough
not to catch in the wheel, for these latter cling
and show the outline of the form very plainly.
The skirt if properly made never annoys one
by blowing. To insure this the fabric muij
have some body to begin with, ana it niusi
further be faced up about live inches with the
goods. The neatest finish for this is small rows
of stitching. If the goo-is is not heavy an in
terlining of canvas may be used between facing
and skirt. The skirt should be lined with satlne
to Insure a freedom of movement tnat is impost
sible with woolen goods. The knickers may
be made of the satine for summer wear, and
then a skirt lining is not necessary. The leg
gings should match the costume or the facing.
A cheviot of mixed tone is very jaunty with
leather facing and leggings. A band of leather,
is put on the hat also, and the gloves and but
tons should be of the color of the leather.
The skirt has a front gore, and from that is
seamless to the center back, where one pleat is
laid on either .side.
The skirt buttons at the top of the front. The
top fits perfectly smooth without darts, as it la
cut circular at the sides and back. The waiss
fits smoothly over the nips, and is cut with the
back and side forms in one. A plain cloth,
black or brown, looks exceedingly well with
white cuffs and collar.
This skirt Is appropriate to wear with shirt
waists for the summer. t

CAMARINOS ATTACHED.
The Sannome-Street Fruit Merchant Is
Trying to Get a Rebate on
His Bent.
An attachment was levied upon the
property of D. G. Camarinos, the Sansome-
Btreet merchant and proprietor of the
Fiarta restaurant, yesterday, by A. O.
Larkin. The cause of this action is an
arrears of rent amounting to $900. For
some time Camarino? has been trying to
get a rebate on the fiOO per month, which
he paj s for the lease of the premises, on
account of extensive repairs he made three
years ago on the building. The agent re
fused to negotiate on this basis, hence the
attachment. .
"It all comes of a renter trying to fix up
the place he occupies," said Mr. Cnmannos
yesterday. "It has l.een fourteen years
since I leased thi< place at $100- a month,
bo yon see I nave paid Mr- Larkin almost

and about three years ago the rotten floors

I made anything like a good showing was
i the Cape Horn Pigeon, which came in full
:of oil and bone. Captain Scullun was so
! well satisfied with his venture that he lias
I fitted out the brig Hidalgo and will make

yearly trips to Eenng Sea instead of to
the Arctic. Captain Dollard ha? chartered
i the La Ninfa and hopes to bring back 150
tons of lish. He is one of the best Known

is live years since he his last cruise,

The La Ninfa has been laid up in Oak
lard Creek for more than B year, and it is
! to be hoped that this new venture will be
! a success. She will carry ten boats and a
I crew of fifteen men and will be gone about
six months.
The Harriman, which is also being
transformed into a cod-fisher, is an olu
j timer. She was built at Searsport, Me.,
in 1882, and made her maiden voyage from
| Nantucket. During her time sbemadea
I fortune for her owners, but on her last
i cruise she only brought in 120 barrels of
| oil. That was in 1883, and since then she
; has been tied up in Oakland Creek. Both
vessels are being fitted out at Fremont
street wharf, and two gangs of men are
. kept constantly going on each. The "try
ing out" apparatus is being removed and
; the vessels cot ready for their new voca
: tion. The Harrinian will take 350 tons of
i salt with her. as the captain expects to
j take at least 000 tons of lish if he gets any
thing like a showing.

aside portions of land for public purposes
In 1853 the Home for Inebriates incorpor
ated, and in 1870 the Legislature passed a
law giving to the home title to the lot as
signed to it by the Board of Supervisors.
In March. 1895, the Legislature repealed
the act of 1870, and in May, 1595, in the
case of the California Academy of Sciences
against the City and County, it was decided
the Board of Supervisors had no power to
set apart any land for the use of private
corporations, and therefore the plaintiff
could have no title to the lot, at least until
after the passage of the act of 1870. The
question considered by Judge Hebbard
was whether or not the home acquired
title under the act of 1870, and if so. did
the repealing act divest it of that title.
The court holds that while in 1868 the City
granted a right for a public use, the Legis
lature two years later conferred it upon a
private corporation. This was, however,
only a trust, or in trust only aould the
home take the land, and the* act of 1895
could and did act in the nature of a ter
mination of the trust. Judgment is there
fore given for the City.

RECEPTION TO MRS. GOUGAR.
Ilonored by the County Woman's Chris

HOG RANCHES MAY STAY.
Supervisors Have Postponed
Action in the Matter for
Six Months.
Attorneys for the Owners Claim That
No Nuisance Exists at Bay
View.
The Health and Police Committee of tho
Board of Supervisors at its meeting yester-
day decided to recommend the postpone
ment of action on the petition of the Bay
View residents, who want the hoe ranches
removed from< that district. The last meet
ing of the committee was given to listen
ing to the arguments of thf property-own
ers, and yesterday the members listened to
the ranchers, who were represented by At
torneys Grr&ysoÃ and Mogan.
These lawyers asserted that the ranches
were rot a nuisance; that they
were situated on land overflowed frp-
quently by the tides, and that as a matter
of fact the section was not at all suitable
for residence purposes and not likely to be
utilized as such. They claimed that the
district was more than usually healthful.
Healt Inspector Kinney was of an en- I
tirely different opinion. He denied that
the ranches were on tide lands, and stated
that on his last trip to the neighborhood
he had seen the carcasses" of four hops that
had died and were left by the ranchers to
rot and taint the air. He declared that the
filth from the pens wa3 let in the open to
be bak'd by the sun, and that at times the
stench was almost unbearable.
The attorneys for the ranchers suggested
that the odors might come from Butcher
town, but Mr. Kinney COmbatted any such
idea, saying that he was thoroughly fa
miliar with Butchertown stenches, which
he could, if necessary, divide into sixteen
distinct classes.
The committee discussed the matter,
Supervisor King claiming that to remove
the ranches would be to kill the. industry
in the vicinity and work a hardfl ip on
many poor people who had invested their
all in tli*"- business.
Supervisors Morganstern and Dunker j
fcjp-eed with King, while Benjamin and :
l)imond took the vie.v that the ianche3
were a nuisance that should tie al atei. A
motion to lay over for six months was
carrie 1 by the votes of King, Morganstern
;m<i Dunker.

National Hank Kxaminer for many years,
but was removed by I'resident Cleveland.
Miss Hay iÂ» a most affable woman to

much Hkc Miss Shaw, but somewhat
younger. She was connected with the W.
('. T. I*, work of her native Stale for seven

The glories of this State tilled Mist Hay
with enthusiasm.
"It was the grandest sight of my life."
said she, "to emerge from the snow and
cold of December into the warmth and
balmy air of June to-day. The change
was so sudden that I could n.ot realize it at
first. We had been plowing along through
ice and snow for hours', indeed days, when
all of a sudden we were in the warmth
and sunshine, surrounded on all sides
with all kinds of fruit trees in full bloom.
It :s much farther across the continent by
travel than when you look at it on the
map, but it pays one to take the journey
now to enjoy that >rrand scene as we saw
it to-day, I for the firs; time. I have never
been farther west before than Denver."
The National headquarters of the
Woman's Suffrage Association is in Phila
delphia, where Miss Rachel A very, as cor
responding secretary, has charge of the
office. The headquarters of the California
association is at lÂ«J30 Folsom street, where

PRESIDIO HEIGHTS.
Property-Ownerg Indignant Over As
sessments for the Lyon-Street
Sewer.
The regular monthly meeting of the Pre
sidio Heights Improvement Club was held
last evening with President George R. San
derson in the chair.
Andrea Sbarboro denounced the pro
posed assessment of Presidio Heights prop
erty for the purpose of enlarging the
Lyon-street sewer. He said that the sewer
would benefit only the Fair property at
Greenwich and Union streets, and that only
that property should bear the expense.
The Fairs had, he said, bought the prop
erty for a song and could well afford to
bear the expense of necessary improve
ments, which doubtless had been figured
on at the time of thepurchase.
Others agreed with Mr. bbarboro, and
Secretary B. E. Severns was instructed to
draw up a formal protest to be presented to
the Supervisors. A list was circulated for
signatures to the protest and forty names
were secured.
The caib also resolved to petition the
Supervisors to erect an electric-light mast
at Maple and Sacramento streets; to grade
First avenue to S per cent, so that bitumen
may be laid as ordered, and to erect a
modern school house on the lot owned by
tne City on Clay between Walnut
nd l.aurel, the site of the old Clay-street
School.

DR. BROWN'S FATE
IN THE BALANCE.
The Council's Sacret Session
Leans to Condemna
tion,
DR. POND'S BOMBSHELL.
A Strong Vote on the Grave
Charge of Intimidating a
Young Lady.
MATTIE QUIETLY DEPARTS.
The Pastor Made a Dramatic Argu
ment in Defenseâ A Verdict
Expected To-Day.
Dr. .Brown's twenty judges went into
executive . session yesterday afternoon at
2::-:0 o'clock, and for nearly eight hours
(straggled with the knotty prohloms which
they were called upon to adjudicate with
that wisdom and conseienciousness with
which they themselves would like to be ad
judged.
Last night at 10:30 o'clock they ad
journed to meet this morning at 10. They
declared that r.o conclusion had been
reached as to whether the pastor is guilty
as charged. It was evident from their reti
cent manner that the subject of their con
sideration bore heavily upon them.
Not one of Dr. Brown's ecclesiastical
brethren but bore a look on his face of in
tense sorrow and in some instances a look
of extreme sadness. They seemed to ap
preciate the fact that i)r. Brown's life, as
that gentleman often expressed it, was in
their keeping to do with it as they willed.
If an unfavorable conclusion was reached
it meant the utter ruin of the accused pas
tor. On the other I, and, a partial exoner
ation would surround him with an atmos
phere which would cling to him the bal
ance of his days. Should a verdict of ac
quittal be handed in they appreciated the
fact that not a few would be willing to cry
"whitewash!"
Altogether Dr. Brown's brethren recog
nized the weight upon them, and no belter
evidence of this can be found than that
they labored for nearly eight hours and
then announced that they had determined
nothing.
Immediately after retiring to the library
Dr. McLean called the' council to order
and then in plain though terse language
omiined the work before tnem. Just what
happened at the afternoon session is not
definitely known, but it may be said, as
coining from one who claims to know, that
the entire case was briefly reviewed, not
with a view of reaching a verdict in so in
formal a way, hut rather with the idea of
refreshing the minds of the council as to
the et.rl:er details of the scandal.
Miss Overman's explanation of the in
criminating Ovcrman-Tunnoll letters was
discussed at great length. Some few mem
bers of the council were outspoken as to
their belief of the truth or falsity of her
Btory. Others had become impressed with
the fact that whatever else had cone before
Dr. Brown's chief witness had in this in
stance at least related a plausible tale.
Then the evidence of Mrs. Thurston was
canvassed, as well as that of Mrs. Barton,
Mr. Bickford and the widow Stockton.
This last lady's statement, evidently
told by her with keen relish, was not con
sidered by the council as worthy of belief.
They did not, however, hold Dr. Brown
entirely blameless for certain details con
nected with Mrs. Stockton's first appear
ance in the church. It wa3 argued that
the pastor would have been much nearer
his duty had he told his wife of that first
impassioned kiss voluntarily offered by
the winsome widow and involuntarily re
ceived by him. This was not considered
7'articularly non-ministerial, for the one
reason, probably, that the osculation was
not of his own seeking, but the fact that he
waited nearly one month before recount
ins this episode to his better half was con
sidered at least a mistake of judgment.
At 6 o'clock the council took a tem
porary recess, coming together again
one hour later. As the reverend
gentlemen fiied out of the Mason-street en
trance, en route to the hotel, reporters
vainly sought to learn something of the
proceedings. Dr. McLean merely put nis
linger to his lips and passed on. The
other members of the council toot the cue
and did likewise.
The evening session was productive of
something tangible in the way Dr. Brown's
judges feel concerning the evidence intro
duced against him. Enough was said and
done to show that the council thought Dr.
Brown guilty of un-ministerial conduct, if
nothing more.
The layman from Stockton introduced a
resolution in effect that Dr. Brown was
guilty of unministerial conduct in the
charge of intimidation brought by a young
lady member of the church. " Thirteen
members voted for this expression ot opin
ion, for such it was, for the reason that the
council will take no definite action until
Midi charge has been thoroughly sifted to
the bottom.
Rev. Mr. Rader, Mr. McKee and Dr.
Williams spoke at great length on tnis
subject. Dr. Williams said Dr.' Brown had
come to him soon alter this matter became
public property and toid him the whole
s-tory. He personally did not think that
the accused man meant actually to in
limidate the young woman, but rather to
urge upon her a suspension of judgment
in his o'.vn case. Mr. Scudder and Dr.
lioyi also took part in the general debate,
the latter claiming that inasmuch as Dr.
Brown had apologized to tne young lady,
the matter sh uld be allowed to to at that.
Dr. Freeland, however, took quite another
* i*-w of the ea^e.
He said that Brown only added insult
to injury in commenting in any way on
the visit of the young woman to" tho
church and her subsequent inspection of
the organ. When tins witness had ap
peared be ore the council, the reverend
gentleman said, she had shown herself to
be rnodesi and unassuming, and one upon
whote character not a breath of suspicion
had ever rested. J)r. Kreeland added that
one lady had said to him that people were
more angry over that matter than any
thing else.
Then another rote was taken on the in
timidation matter, and it was voted as the
sense of the council that the accused pas
tor's conduct on this, occasion was. in a
Â«-nse, unministcrial. This action of the
council is not to be considered final, but
merely a means of getting things in shape
for to-day's work.
K<*v. Ur. Pond surprised his brethren by
offering a supplementary motion to the
effect that Dr. Brown's conduct on this oc
casion was unbecoming that of a Christian
gentleman. Mr. Barker, who had voted
on the previous question, asked the privi
lege of withdrawing his vote. He thought
tbat it the matter was brought to the at
icntion of Dr. Brown in this way it would
Lc of lasting benefit to him.
ilev. -Mr. Hatch, who had voted against
the original motion, f.-*n r e another little
surprise wh n he declared with much ear
nestness that, though lie was opposed to
tiie council taking tiie action suggested by
Dr. Pond, he personally felt that Dr.
Brown, in this one case at least, had been
uneentlemanly, unmanly and unministe
rial. This opinion, however, would not
cause him to vote, in this one matter at
lea^t, with the majority.
The case of Mrs. French, or more, cor
rectly speaking, the Turkish tea episode,
was next considered. The council was not
at all certain as to just how much imuor
anoe should be attached to this affair.
Some were of the opinion that it should
he eliminated entirely from the proceed
ings of the body, while others contended
that The charges were vital to the general
accusation of unministerial conduct. At j
this point further discussion of the matter |
was postponed until to-day. The balance I
of the evening was spent in reviewing j
what had be^n accomplished since the j
council had gone into executive session I
and formulating plans for reaching, if pos- j
Bible, a speedy conclusion to-day.
Miss Martha Overman has given a sur- i
prise to her friends and members of the
council by a hasty departure for Southern
California. Her objective point is said to
be Los Angeles, but as Mrs. Tunneli is
known to be on the Mexican side of the
border, it is thought that she is making
straight for the arms of her aged friend.
The sisrnih'cance of this movement fol
lowing on the heel* of the close of the case
is not fully understood at present. It is
generally thought, however, to secure an
affidavit of some character from Mrs. Tun
neli, return it by mail to the City, but to
keep herself alool from the courts of justice
and possibly Grand Jury proceedings.
Miss Overman left on her soutliern trip
Thursday afternoon at 5 o'clock, but her
absence from the City was not related by
Dr. Brown to any one until to-<!ay. The
council was kept'in absolute ignorance of
her departure.
At the close of Dr. Brown's address to
the council yesterday a most unusual
scene occurred. His partisans and a few
of those who have bitterly opposed him
sent forth yells of applause, shouted all
sorts of congratulations, waved their hats,
handkerchiefs ami parasols, and behaved
in a generally unseemly manner. One ex-
Dr. Brown Receiving the Congratulations of Friends on the Close of His Argument.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
cited citizen shouted the name of Dr.
Brown as a possible Mayorality candidate,
his speech being received with loud and
prolonged applause. D:. Brown was im
mediately surrounded with a host of
friends who assured him of their confi
dence and congratulated him on his mag
nificent oratorical effort.
Deacon Morse said last night that Pastor
Brown was greatly overcome by his exer
tion of the morning, and had been forced
to take to his bed.
DR. BROWN'S ARGUMENT.
He Caused a Number of Women
and Old Men to Shed
Tears.
Dr. Brown made the speech of his life
yesterday forenoon before the council.
It was the speech of his life because it
was on behalf of bis life as a minister of
the gospel, and, as was expected, it was
characteristically picturesque. Strong
lights and shadows passed across its skill
fully woven web. In the drama which he
was reciting there were sunshine, clouds,
thunder and rain.
The sun shone when he spoke of himself,
of his unspotted record as a minister of .
the Congregational church; and the rain
fell from his eyes when he begged the i
council not to believe the wicked and per- j
jured witnesses against him, but to re- :
] member not only his own innocence but
that of his grown-up sons in the East, his
devoted wife andhis sorrowing parents.
Young women and old women and old
men shed tears when his words began to
flow, but they were his partisans. The \
eyes of half his audience were dry, cold,
skeptical and hard.
A paid attorney could not have pleaded j
better for Dr. Brown than did Dr. Brown .
i himself. He overlooked no point either j
| within or without the evidence brought be- :
I foie the council. He introduced alleged |
j evidence in his speech, prefacing its intro
, auction with the statement that his argu
| ment to the council should be considered '
ias testimony under oath. Thus, he de- I
! cared that the retail saloon-keepers were !
i seeking to destroy him and had collected
I a fund for that purpose, some of which
j fund- he /"believed" (and doubtless under
oath) "had be^nused, by the way in which
i I have been maliciously maligned in the
I public newspapers of this City.
His slap at a venerable and respectable
lady member of his congregation and at
her daughter was greeted with approving i
smile 3by his Christian friends, male and '
I female, when he remarked that Mrs. Stock
ton had entered the council chamber "with
appropriate escort." Her escort on that i
occasion were Mrs. Cooper and her daugh- j
ter Hattie.
It stormed and thundered in the stento- j
rian tones of outraged innocence when the
speaker told the council what wicked I
women Mrs. Stockton and Mrs. Davidson |
were, and what magnificent liars were Mrs.
Barton. Mrs. Thurston and other wit- i
nesses against him, who had vilified him â 
and persecuted trim for months.
It was remarked as an appropriate sequel i
to this characteristic speech that one of !
his gray-haired admirers should have nor- I
mated him a<Â« a candidate for the mayor- j
alty of San Francisco, thus mintrling reli- i
gion, perjury, scandal and politics in one !
unsavory stew.
The doctors argument, or very copious i
longnand notes of the same, were in a i
manuscript which the doctor held in his I
hand and consulted at frequent intervals, j
He began by informing the council that j
the trial was one of the most remarkable
that had taken place in the history oi Con- J
gregationali^m, and that the same could [
be said of the council. Then he said that j
it was his province to plead before the j
council that lie might be permitted to live. !
The council had been called for the pur- I
pose of ascertaining the truth of certain
grave charges which had been made ]
against him primarily by two individuals i
and "taken up and iterated and reiterated
with strange intensity and persistence by
the great daily newspapers of this cosmo
politan City."
"These charges were made." he repeated,
"by two women, both of whom on their
owu sworn testimony, one in your presence
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1596
and the other in the Police Court, are
utterly unworthy of credence. These
charges were made by one of those women
only after she had been arrested and placed
in jail for extortion, and were made against
the man who had caused her arrest, and
by the other woman after she had^ been
publicly accused of an attempt to commit
blackmail, and they were made against the
man who had dared to expose her."
Dr. Brown recalled the words of Judge
Campbell, who, when holding Mrs. David
son to answer, said that it was the very
essence of blackmail that the blackmailer
will lie and swear to her lies to blacken
the character of her victim. And she will
have a story definite and specific ready to
tell to the community if he dares at any
stage to resist her demand upon him.
The speaker proceeded to comment upon
the life and character of the woman, to
whom he referred as Mrs. Davidson, Mrs.
Pierce, Mrs. Buck, Miss Abbott and Mrs.
Mary A. Sturgis, some of which names, he
said, were legitimate and some of which
were illegitimately gained. He raked up
everything of her alleged career that had
been published in the newspapers, but he
did not say that the newspapers had ma
liciously maligned Mrs. Davidson as he
had said that they had maliciously ma
ligned him. On the contrary, he did not
mention the newspapers at all in connec
tion w:th ttio alleged record of that pious
and gray-haired chanter of psalms.
The attention of the council was next
called to the series of Overman-Tunnell
loners and the Overman-Davidson letters,
whose contents were spoken of as tending
to corroborate Miss Overman's testimony,
to the effect that she, at Mrsi Davidoon's
instigation, had rewritten and remodeled
the original letters for the purposes of the
conspiracy between them.
Dr. Brown laid stress upon the proposi
tion that in one series of letters Miss Over
man speaks of him in terms of respect ana
in the other series in terms of disgust and
reprobation. The letters written by Mr<=.
Davidson to Miss Overman at the same
period aivi a Jthe very time that Mrs. Da
vidson declared that the doctor was con
1 fessing to her a series of violations of the
seventh commandment sliow that Mrs.
; Davidson entertained for Dr. Brown the
: highest possible respect, speaking of him
! as '"truly called of Uo;i to do a great work
in the church in San Francisco, and a man
j tilled with the Holy Ghost." He was not
in those letters anywhere referred to as
â  "an old reprobate 1 ' by Mrs. Davidson.
Dr. Brown instanced the tone of his own
letters to Miss Overman, partly extending
over the same period, as a proof that no
illicit relations existed between him and
her. In connection with this matter the
doctor remarked tbat any nian who would
be fool enough to have illicit lov<Â»3 would
be tool enough to write illicit letters. He
asked the council whether they considered
his letters to Miss Overman love letters or
were they what upon their face they pur
ported to be â letters of advice on literary
and spiritual matters.
These slanders, continued the doctor, in
a burst of indignation, were circulated
against a man who had led a spotless life
for forty-eight years; "who had never been
known as a ladies' man and who l.ad rather
been regarded and remarked upon as an
icicle among women."
The speaker proceeded in his argument
to contend that the theory of his guilt
came into collision wit h all the admitted
facts of the case. 'Ihe specific charges
against him by Mrs. Davidson were
five in number: First, adultery with Miss
Overman; second, that his crime was com
mitted on November 24, 1894; third, that '
it was committed at a certain specified
place, namely, the corner of Sixth and
Bryant Btreeta in this City; fourth, that
that place was a lodging-house; and fifth,
that that lodging-house was kept at that
time by one Jane Elizabeth Badain.
Here were live specific allegations cap- !
; able of being proved or disproved. No at- |
i tempt even had been made before the j
j council to prove them, he said.
Dr. Brown in commenting favorably
; upon the testimony of Detective Keymour
referred to him with much apparent fervor
i as "that Roman Catholic, Detective Sey
: moor, who, during these months of trial,
i has been a second brother to me."
Dr. Brown made a very ingenious argu
: ment as to the reason why he paid Mrs.
Davidson $500 on demand and why he :
had refused to pay anything to Mrs. Stock- |
ton. He cited the fact that Mrs. Stockton j
was her own only witness. She was not
backed up by a white-haired woman be
i lieved to be a sincere Christian person and i
! of good standing in the church as Mrs. '
Davidson was. When he turned Mrs. I
; Stockton's lawyer out of his house he had !
: not ni3de so many enemies, except Dy his
1 position on the public school question, but
that enmity was not personal. The church
of Rome was not friendly to his course,
; but he would say that members of that
church had given him personal assurances
of their sympathy and help in this trial.
He added :
In the midst of all the vicious, malignant
and slanderous articles ever written about me
the Monitor has been silent, and there is a
significance in that which 1 shall not now at
tempt to explain.
He should forever honor the men who
had been able so completely to bury their
prejudices and forget their pride and to
remember only the elements of common
humanity which bound them to a suffering
man.
Dr. Brown proceeded to argue that pub
lic sentiment was not specially alert and
aroused over crimes against the seventh
commandment at the time Mrs. Stockton's
lawyer visited him and made certain de
mands upon him. That was in Novem
ber, 1894, but in November, 1893, he argued,
there was a totally different set of circum
stances. Mrs. Davidson was believed to
be a noble Christian woman and she pro
fessed to believe the story alleged against
him. He was led to believe at that time
also that there were three women in
league against him, namely, Miss Over
man. Mrs. Baddin and her lodger, who
would swear that he was a guilty man.
That was a formidable array as compared
with the unsupported word of Mrs. Stock
ton.
Public sentiment at that time had been
aroused as it had never been aroused be
fore in San Francisco against the offense
which Mrs. Davidson had alleged aeainst
him because of the North Beach ex
posures. Besides that, he had aroused
the antagonism of large classes of people.
He had made a vigorous canvass among
the residents of his neighborhood to ob
tain their sienatures to a protest which
he had prepared against . the proposed
establishment of a liquor saloon almost in
front of the church door, and he had
thereby incurred the enmity of the
saloon-keepers. He continued:
At'that time I was painfully aware of the
fact that the eyes of every retail liquor-dealer
in the community were upon me, aud that a
larjre sum of money was lodged with those
j liquor-dealers to be used against me in any
j trial in which I might be concerned. I have
j reason to believe that some of that money has
been used by the way in which I have been
maliciously maligned in the public news
papers of this City.
Dr. Brown also mentioned the fact that
at the time he paid Mrs. Davidson the fSOO
a considerable number of members of the
| church were arrayed against him. Mrs.
j Davidson chose her time when he was at
his weakest and when his foes were at the
maximum of their strength. Of all these
things she skillfully reminded him. The
community was in a state of mind ready
to convict any minister accused of a viola
j tion of the seventh commandment, and
! was prepared to accept without proof any
! charge against the pastor of the First Con
! gregational Church.
Mrs. Thurston's statement was com-
I mented upon most severely. She had
i given her testimony with an air of mys
; tery, he said, as if she were keeping back
more than she cared to telJ. Her testi
mony as to Dr. Brown building a tire for
Miss Overman was false, because there was
: neither stove, grafe nor fireplace in the
room, nor any other place in the room
where a fire could be built without bnrn
, ing down the houÃe. He had no doubt
| that the rest of Mrs. Thurston's story de
: pended as largely upon her imagination
;as that part of her story had. That
, is, ne added, observing a good opening
to get in a whack at the newspapers,
: Mrs. Thurston's imagination, aided by
i the newspapers, which had published
i those matters before Mrs. Thurston had
' testified anywhere, and "aided by a latent
' grudge against the pa.*tor of a rich
church," comprised her testirnonv.
1 Stripped of all imagination, the only truth
â  ful statement that he would admit that she
; had made under oath \\; % s that Miss Over
man and Mrs. Tunnell had told her that
i Miss Overman was in love with Dr. Brown.
Alleged inconsistencies in the testimony
;of Mrs. Barton were taken uj Her story
I that Miss Overman and Mr-, i^tvidjon had
invited her to sleep at Mrs. Davidson's
house on Geary street on the night before
Christmas eve he declared to be palpably
false, becau3e Miss Overman and Mrs.
Davidson hud had a rupture of their
friendly relation* on December 19.
Dr. Brown's grotesque penchant for get
ting funny in the midst of the mots sol
emn things cropped out in his review of
the testimony of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper.
He alleged ironically that her statements
were as essential to the case as were those
of Mrs. Barton. In the first place, she had
proceeded to affirm that some one had
called her daughter "a pock-marked
thing." Then she had said that Mrs. Tun
nell had left Dr. Brown's house through
the back gate, when the fact was that there
vras no back gate on the premises. Ho
also poked fun at fl familiar stanza quoted
in Mra. Cooper's statement, beginning:
Right forever on the scaffold,
Wroug forever on the throne.
Having read the stanza in elocutionary
style Dr. Brown threw the audience into a
tit of merriment by facetiously pleading
guilty to the charge if Mrs. Cooper had
quoted the stanza as an accusation against
him.
Miss Hattie Cooper's testimony was dis
missed even more flippantly by his remark
that he could not commend anything j
better for Miss Cooper's consideration i
than the motto which she said was hang- i
ing in the Co-operative restaurant:
' PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD. :
Dr. Brown next turned his attention to
the intimation that he was, or had been,
interested in sending Mrs. Tunnell out of
the City and keeping her out of the way.
He flatly denied that he had anything to
do with any conspiracy of that kind. He
would be the happiest man in the world,
he said, if she* would return and testify.
He added:
She left this Citvat the Instigation of Martha
Overman, who had been hepeful that she might
pass through this terriblo ordeal without be
ing obliged to reveal her Â«.'.vn guilty love for
me.
Tho charges of intimidation preferred by
Mrs. Blanchaid and a young woman of the
congregation, who inspected the big organ
in tbe church, wore taken up next. The
speaker declared that Mrs. Blanc i.ard was
not and never had been a member of his
church, yet she had voted twice on the
"THE SANDS WILL GLOW WiTIl A FERVENT HEAT."
floor of the lecture-room in ihe Brown
matter. She had made a sworn statement
in the preseyce of a notary pubiic one
night, .and when the transcript of the
shorthand reporter's notes of that state
ment were brought to her the next day for
her signature she refused to sign it, alleg
ing as the reason that she desired legal ad
vice.
Then Dr. Brown said to her. "If you in
sist ur>on not signing it, bnt upon going
for advice, I shall consult the police
authorities of this City." Dr. Brown
argued that tnat statement could not, by
any means, be construed as intimidation,
tie also denied that it had been bis mten-
tion to intimidate the young woman,
whom he had seen coming out of the
organ.
With reference to the allegation that he
had done an unministerial act in continu
ing the church relations with Mrs. Stock
ton after the commission of an act that
looked like immorality, the speaker dwelt
upon the fact that on the Sunday follow
ing the Stockton kiss Mrs. Stockton had
begged his pardon, and for months after
ward had conducted herself with the de
corum of a lady. He asked the council
what was there in the forgiveness of one
who has erred that could conflict with the
standing of a minister.
Attention was next called to the arduous
nature of the duties for which he was re
ceiving a salary of $4000 a year. On ordi
nary Sundays, taking the two services to
gether, more than 2000 people stood before
him, he said. Extra addresses had brought
him into* contact with large audiences in
Metropolitan Hall and Odd Fellows' Tem
ple. Men whose names he did not know
had stopped him on the streets, had taken
him by the hand ana thanked him for
those addresses. In spite of the fact that
he was so well known the charge had been
made against him by Mrs. Stockton that
for months and months he used to wait
for her on the street corners with pleasant
propositions to her to spend a lovers'
hour with him on the rock piles of Castro
Heights or on the scrap-iron heaps of
Rincon Hill, and yet nobody of the thou
sands who knew him by sight had been
produced on the witness-stand to say that
they had seen him. If Mrs. Stockton's
story were true, he said, she could bring a
thousand people to prove it. He added :
But, instead of that, Mrs. Stockton, with ap
propriate escort, conies Into this council with
stories of restaurants, etc.
This thrust at Mrs. Cooper and her
daughter, who were Mrs. Stockton's escort
when she came to testify, was greeted
with smiles by the friends of the speaker.
He went on to call attention to Mrs.
Stockton's apparent poverty a short time
ago, and he inquired now it was that since
then, without any visible employment or
compensation, she had. accumulated "a
capital 6O large that from the income of it
site can dress like the daughter of a mill
ionaire and bedeck herself with diamonds
like a queen?"
The peroration of the doctors address
was eloquent and at times pathetic. When
he spoke of his wife, his aged father and
mother and sons in t:*e East, his voice
broke and the tears came. With him
wept his wife and those women members
of his congregation who still believed him
to be innocent of wrongdoing. Referring
to his wife he t^aid: "I was married as
young as Shakespeare, but far more hap
pily than he."
He spoke of his eldest son, a farmer on
the plains of DaVota; the second son, a
minister of the Congregational church in
lowa, and the third, holding a responsible
position in one of the largest dry -goods
houses in the city of Chicago.
"Do you think," he asked, "that I would
wait until this time of life to wreck an
honorable career, to sport with harlots and
to spoil the virtue of a confiding young
woman?"
He spoke in terms of praise and grati
tude of the Jewish woman who bad come
to him with her husband to express their
confidence in Iris innocence. This ex
pression of commendation was followed by
the reading of a letter from the president
of the First National Bank of Kalamazoo
and also trustee of the First Congrega
tional Church of that place speaking in
the highest terms of Dr. Brown as a man
and as a minister of the gospel. Then Dr.
Brown referred to his army record, and
said that he had risked his life more than
once for the preservation of the nation,
and he had imperiled Iris position by ad
vocating unpopular reforms.
He asked whether he, with such an
honorable record-, was the type of a man
who would wait until his gray hairs came
upon him, and he, a grandfather of a
beautiful child, to become guilty of charges
made by two women, one of whom had
left a trail of crime all over the continent,
and the other of whom swore that she has
nothing to lose when she swore to her own
infamy.
His 'home, he said, awaited with bated
breath the decision of the council, and it
was a home which, until now, had no
shadow of suspicion or scandal. His sons
in the East and West, his father and
mother, who had consecrated him to the
ministry before he was .born, awaited the
verdict that would fill. them with new
gratitude to God. If the council should
decide him to be unworthy of his trust ho
would never see again tlie faces of his
father and mother, whose gray hairs
would be stricken down in sorrow ana in
shame to the crave. He asked:
Have you considered what will be the effect
on society if your verdict will be adverse?
Have you considered that in the face of the
greatest odds I have undertaken to battle tor
every man of moans sufficient to make him a
target for blackmail? Ciive me the victory and
the business of the blackmailer throughout
America and throughout the world, for the
story of this thing has crossed the oceans, the
business of the blackmailer in every city on
the globe will receive such a blow as it never
received before.
He closed by likening himself to Xeno
phon's hosts when they came in sight of
the ocean and cried "The sea! the sen!"
So also would he cry in the event of a
favorable verdict "The sea! the sea!"
As the doctor concluded there was a
burst of hand-clapping with cries of
"Hurrah! bravo! bravo!" from the west
side of the room near the door, and when
the clapping had subsided a gray-haired
man arose in his seat and. shouted: "I
nominate Dr. Brown for the next Mayor of
this City. Three cheers for Dr. Brown!"
The cheers were given by the old man,
who possessed the husky, stentorian voice
of an old sea lion on the Cliff House rocks.
The council then took a recess until
2:30 p. m.

LOOKING FOR KELLY.
An Engineer Who Slipped Away From
His Captors to Escape a Warrant.
The Police Department would like to
know what has become of William Kelly,
an engineer, who lives at 318 Ghenery
street. Kelly was arrested Wednesday
last by Policeman Carson on a charge of
drunkenness, and after having been
charged at the Seventeenth-street ptation
he was transferred to the Central station.
While he was sobering up from the
effects of his debauch his wife appeared at
the Poiice Court and swore out a warrant
charging him with battery. She stated
that previous to his arrest he had beaten
her cruelly, and she wished him sent to
some institution where he could be induced
to mend his ways.
The warrant was issued in due form, but
when it was sent into the prison to b<;
served on Kelly he was not to be found.
His coat was in the cell, but neither him
self nor a Droom he had been sweeping
up with could be found.
Mrs. Kelly stated yesterday that Kelly
had been seen at liberty and was laughing
at the tricK he had played on the prison
Officials. He said that when the "drunk"
squad went out to clean corridors and the
Police Court floors he had gone with them,
and on learning on the outside that a war
rant had been issued for him he had
quietly slipped away from the inebriates
and gone to his usuai haunts to get an-
Other coat.

of Warning.
TT IS A PITY THAT THERE ARE NOT MORE
i 1 people in this world of ours who are willing
! to let the rest of us benefit by their experiences.
1 When a man knows anything that is for the
; general benefit of his race it is strange that he
j does not see how absolutely unfair it is to keep

i And yet the men who do this continually are

i infinitely more public-spirited and of those
who abhor anything like injustice, Is Mr. S. J.
Baily, the well-known and highly respected
thinker, whose home is now in Marysville.
Like most men occasionally subject to nervous
strain, Mr. Bailey became once the victim of an
insidious disease, which was gnawing at his
very heart's strings, and he was at a loss as to
what it was best to do. That he did the very
best thing possible is now not a matter of doubt,
for he applied to the managers of the great
medical institution which is located in the big
white building at the junction of Market, Ellis
and Stockton streets, and of what was done for
him by the specialists of that grand establish-
ment he speaks in plain terms. And he tells of
what he knows well. Read his letter; it is
right straight to the point: . â¢

you for your speedy aid. And I will herein
state that any person suffering from any nerv-

Here is comfort for every nervous man that
there is on earth, for Mr. Bailey was indeed a
sick man when he placed himself unreservedly
in the hands of the clever physicians of the
Hudson Medical Institute, but they have suc-
ceeded, as thousands of others will willingly
testify, in curing all the curable cases which
have been brought to them.
K. C. Taft of Stowe, Cal., writes: "I am feel-
ing fine with not a sign of the disease now."
Mr. A. Burton of Grass Valley says: "The
medicine that I took did me lots of good." '

not felt as well in five years as I do now." i
S.M. Hooker of Los Angeles writes: "I ndw

Prompt Verdict of the Jury
in "The Call" Libel
Suit.
EXPOSURE OF A SCHEME
Architect Chadwick Swore That
Chase Asked Him to Com
mit Perjury.
THE SPEECH BY MR. DELMAS.
A Powerful Argument Reviewing the
Attempt to Build Up a Dam
age Claim.
The $50,000 libel suit of John G. Chase
against Charles M. Shortridge, proprietor
of The Call, was concluded in the su
perior Court yesterday, and the jury gave
an immediate verdict in the defendant's
favor.
It was shown that there had been no
libel in an article published in Thk Call
and that the charges against Mr. Chase
were true.
The trial of the case was in Department
5 of the Superior Court, Judge Matt F.
Johnson cf Sacramento presiding in the
place of Judge Hunt.
D. M. Delmas and John E. Richards
represented the defendant, and the attor
neys for Mr. Chase were C. A. Reynolds
ana J. H. Heenan. The jury was com
posed of John F. Quad*. Charles Whelan,
Henry Root, J. J. Pastene, L. T. Lewis, J.
B. Lewis Jr., John Watkins, C. R. Haw
thorne, Thomas BlanchfieJd, James Bad
ger, John Corbett and D. L. Mayers.
On February 5, 1895, an article was pub
lished in The Call stating that several
charges had been made against Mr. Chase
by members of the order of Foresters.
Among other things, according to the
article, Mr. Chase, an ex-chief ranger, was
charged with drawing money from the
sick-benefit fund when not entitled to it,
and issuing to himself a clearance-card to
join another court when objection was
made. The heading of that article was as
follows:
CHARGED WITH FRAUD.
Queer Practices of Forester John G. Chase.
His Expulsion Ordered by the
Grand Council.
LOCAL FORESTERS ARE , INDIGNANT.
The Members of Court Enterprise, Which
He Nearly Bankrupted, Demand
His arrest.
. Claims for damage^ were based on alle
gations that Mr. Chase had lost building
contracts on account of the publication of
the article, and that lumbermen had re
fused to deal with him.
In the trial of the cese the plaintiff had
evidently depended on Architect Jame3 P.
Chad wick as the chief witness, bur the
whole sum of Mr. Chad wick's testimony
was a plain, emphatic declaration that
Chase had tried to induce him to commit
perjury in the plaintiff's behalf. Mr. Chad
wick declared that Mr. Chase had not lost
certain specified contracts on account of
The Call publication, though' the plaintiff
had personally sworn to the contrary. He
produced documents which appeared to be
bids that Chase offered on certain build
ings last July and declared that the docu
ments had really been presented to him
by Chase on Monday of this week for the
first time and with the intention that the
witness should use them in giving false
testimony. It was on Tuesday that the
trial was begun, and Mr. Chad wick then
declared that the bids were first seen by
him the day before.
This revelation created a decided sensa
tion among the listeners in the courtroom,
and there was a little ripple of merriment
when Chase's attorneys set out to impeach
their own witness.
Before Mr. Chadwick had been called
Plaintiff Chase wan in the witness-box.
He told many things about his experi
ence in various fraternal organizations,
and when Mr. Delmas began the cross
examination he told some more. Ques
tions as to whether Mr. Chase had been
arrested sixteen times for drunkenness
and other misdemeanors were not an
swered, as Mr. Heenan's objection was
sustained.
"If you are 52 years old to-day now old
were you in 1855?" asked Mr. Delmas, re
ferring to statements that the plaintiff
bad made regarding his early life in Massa
chusetts.
"Eleven."
"And you say that you were treasurer
of the Good Templars' organization at that
time?"
The witness said that he might have
been 12 years old at the time.
"Were you going to school?" was asked.
"I was."
"Studying arithmetic?"
"I don't remember about that."
"Where did you keep the money, in a
child's toy-box or in a bureau drawer?"
"In a bureau drawer."
"Who kept the key, you or your
mother?"
"I did."
"How much money did you have on
Land at one time?"
"About $100."
"In coin?"
"No, I think not."
"In greenbacks?"
'1 don't think we had any greenbacks
then."
"Do you remember seeing any green
backs at that time?"
"No. :l
Mr. Delmas inquired about the connec
lion of the witness with the Good Tem
plars, and asked:
"Were you not repeatedly arrested here
for drunkenness?"
Again an objection was made and sus
tained. r
In the direct examination Mr. Chase had
testified that on account of The Call arti
cle about him he had lost several building
contracts, which contracts he specified.
He asserted that he had presented bids to
Architect James P. Chadwick. and that
although the bids were the lowest, they
had been rejected on account of the state
ments in the paper. â¢
Architect Chadwick was then called, and
it was on his declarations that the plain
tiff expected to win tne Â«50,000 libel suit
against Mr. Shortridge.
The witness, however, plainly stated that
Mr. Chase had asked him to give false tes
timony in the case. He said that on
Monday of this week Mr. Chase had hand
ed hocus bids to him, expecting that they
would be used in the case as bids that had
been rejected last July on account of the
article in The Call.
He had been very careful not to commit
himself, he stated, giving Mr. Chase "all
the rope he wanted," but not saying that
he would or would not swear as requested.
When the bogus bids were presented to
him he informed Samuel M. Shortridge,
the defendant's brother, and made a com
plete statement of the case.
The plaintiff was evidently not prepared
for such an exposure, but Attorney Hee
nan launched out a vigorous attempt to
break down the architect's statement. Mr.
Delmas objected to the form of one of the
questions.
"I have the right to impeach the wit
ness!" exclaimed Mr. Heenan.
"But he is your own witness," was the
retort.
Mr. Heenan abruptly abandoned the in
quiry and Attorney Reynolds, his asso
ciate, arose ana asked for permission to go
on with the questioning. Judge Johnson
would not permit that, however, as it was
contrary to the rules of practice. Mr.
Reynolds then communicated his thoughts
to Mr. Heenan and the latter asked the
questions.
Architect Chadwick ilatly contradicted
the plaintiff on every material point.
Mr. Delmas at the cross-examination
produced one of the documents which was
alleged to be a bid presented by Chase to
the architect last July.
â¢When did you first see this?" he asked.
"Yesterday," was the reply, and Mr.
Chadwick related his conversation with
Mr. Chase and the incidents connected
with it.
The other alleged bids were produced
and Chadwick gave similar testimony re
gardinc them.
"And he asked you to swear to these
things which you declare under oath to be
false?" continued Mr. Delmas.
'â¢Ye?, sir," replied the witness. "He
wanted me to commit rank perjury."
Harry B. Jennings, a barber, was the
next witness. He testified that he wa9 a
member of the order oE Montezuma. Mr.
Chase applied for membership but was
blarkoalled on account of the charge of
embezzlement.
Patrick D. Fitzpatrick, a plumber, was
called to testily about Mr. Chase's business
affairs. On cross-examination it was shown
that after doing work by order of Mr.
Chase, he had been compelled to sue the
owner of the house to get his money, but
he did not regard Mr. Chase as responsible
for thai debt, and in other instances the
latter had }>aid him.
Michael McGreevey is a bricklayer. He
has held Bab-contracts under Mr. Chase.
Though called on as a witness for the
plaintiff, he admitted to Mr. Delmas that
he had experienced difficulty in collecting
money. Once he had quarreled with Chase
at a primary.
"Did that election fight have anything
to do with business affairs?" was one of
the questions.
"There micht have Deen some feeling on
that proposition."
"Was the trouble settled there and
then?"
There was vehemence and a sort of sup
pressed excitement in the answer that shot
t'.irth:
'â¢It was not, sir."
"Did yon have trouble in getting your
money from Mr. Chase?"
"Well, he sent me to the owner of the
place and I had to put a lien on the prop
erty."'
The next witness was John C. Chase Jr.,
who, although a carpenter ana living at
his father's house during the period in
question, knew practically nothing about
his father's building operations.
"Didn't your father tell you about his
contracts?" asked Mr. Delmas.
"Yes, he told me when he got a job."
"Didn't he tell you what it was?"
"No."
"What was the contract that you say
Mr. Chadwick went first to talk with your
father about?"
"A. cottage, I think."
"Whose cottage?"
"I don't know.
"Where was it to be built?"
"I couldn't tell."
"What was the price?"
"I never heard."
"Did your father get the contract?"
"No."
Other alleged contracts were gone over
in the same way and the grown-up son of ,
Mr. Chase showed that he had little knowl- j
edge of his father's business affairs.
"Did your father ever get a contract
from Mr. Chadwick?" Mr. Delmas asked.
"No."
Attorneys Reynolds and Heenan, repre
senting the plaintiff, went to the witness- i
stand to declare that Mr. Chadwick had'
told them that Chase had lost building
contracts on account of The Call article
and that he would so testify.
The two attorneys admitted to Mr. Del
mas at the cross-examination that as fees
in the case they were only to get a per- i
centage of any damages that might be
awarded to Chase.
When tho defense was begun on Wednes
day Mrs. Martha Wiebeke and other
property-owners denied that they had re
fused to give building contracts to Chase
on account of his reputation after the Call
publication. They swore positively that
they had not received bids from him.
Mr. Chadwick was recalled to testify
furtner about the building operations
which Chase had alluded to and he pre
sented a notebook containing the record
of his work for more than two years to
show that Chase had not presented bids as
claimed.
Mrs. Lyons, a cook on Second street,
testified that she had paid $1 80 in lodge
dues to Chase, and that the latter had not
made any raturn of the money.
Several officers in the Ancient Order of
Foresters were called to prove the allega
tions made by Tim Call.
George F. Brown, who has been the pre
siding officer of Court Washington, A. O.
F.. testified that Chase had made illegal
claims for si<k benefits and had received
the money when not entitled to it.
"Once the financial secretary and I called
on Mr. Chase," said the witness, "and we
were told at the door that he was sick
that be either had smallpox or was going
to have it."
"That he was going to have smallpox?"
Mr. Delmas inquired.
"Yes, that was what the young lady at
the door told us. Two days afterward I
SÂ»W Mr. Chase driving along Market street
in a wagon with a load of lumber. I didn't
know what to make of it."
"Perhaps," suggested Mr. Delmas, "he
was going to buikl a pesthouse."
Other testimony of the tsainc nature was
given by Mr. Urown, and the records of
the order were introduced, whereby it was
proved that Chase had been expelled.
Mr. Brown's narrative was supplemented
and emphasized by other officers of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1896.
order, including Permanent Secretary Fal
coner.
Miss May Frances Nelson was a witness
who gave some testimony about Mr. Chase
and his lodge dealings. She left the wit
ness-box just before the forenoon recess,
and when Judge Johnson had the court
called to order again Mr. Delmas requested
that she return to the stand.
"Mrs. Nelson," said the counselor, "did
anybody make any slurring remark to you
as you passed out a little while ago?"
"Yes,'* was the reply, "a remark was
made by John G. Chase Jr."
"What was the remark?"
"It was so slurring that I do not wish to
repeat it."
Judge Johnson displayed an active in
terest in the proceeding, but it was found
that it was just outside of the courtroom
that the words had been spoken. When
the statement of the witness had been
heard, Mr. Delmas announced that he was
not inclined to go any further with the in
cident. Judge Johnson, however, declared
that he would not tolerate any attempts,
such as mentioned, to insult or intimidate
witnesses.
Mrs. John G. Chase Jr. was a witness for
the defense, testifying about the alleged
illness of her father-in-law when the lodge
benefits were claimed.
Witnesses in long array testified in re
gard to minor points of the case, and the
subject of character was taken up.
Yesterday forenoon the arguments were
begun, each side being limited to an hour
and a half. Mr. Reynolds argued for
Chase, and delivered a forcible, eloquent
plea, in which he asked for charitable con
sideration of his client's case.
Mr. Del mas replied. At 3:45 o'clock
Judge Johnson pave his instructions to the
jury regarding the law of libel. The jury
retired, and in three or four minutes riled
back into the courtroom.
Henry Root, the well-known San Fran
cisco inventor, was a member of the jury,
and he had been chosen foreman. When
asked by the Judge whether a verdict had
been reached Foreman Root replied in the
am'rmative and presented the document to
the clerk. The reading showed the verdict
to be in favor of Mf. Shortridge.
There had been no delay in arriving at
the verdict against Mr. Chase, and only
one ballot was taken. The verdict was
unanimous.
MR. DELMAS' ADDRESS.
The Counselor's Eloquent Argu
ment Before the Jury Yester
day Afternoon.
The address delivered by Mr. Delmas to
the jury was, in part, as follows:
If your Honor please and gentlemen of the
jury :
It is not my purpose, gentlemen, to detain
you at any very great length.
As you all understand, this is a case for
libel brought by Mr. John G. Chase against
Charles M. Shortridge, the proprietor of The
Morning Call.
Without going into any minute details, the
charge alleged to be take is, In substance, thnt
i Mr. Chase, the plaintiff, while being a member
i of the Order of Foresters, was guilty oi ernbez
-1 zlement of certain sums of money which were
j paid to him. The other charge is that Mr.
Chase, while a member of this order, whs
guilty of fraudulently obtaining sick benefits,
and that on account of these practices he was
finally tried by the order In the court properly
instil uted according to its rules aud constitu
tion, and was with disgrace expelled from the
order.
This article was published with the idea that
' this paper owed it as a public duty to make
i known to the numberless members of this
j charitable institution called the Forestersâ
! people ns a rule of humble rank, of humble
station in life, as you have seen themâ that in
their ranks was a man unworthy to be of them;
a man who, instead of seeking the noble and
lofty purpose that they pursued, was acting to
their detriment. The charges were made by
the newspaper after full, deliberate investiga
tion, and they are true. We assert that it is
true that Chase, while a member of this or
ganization, received moneys in his official
j capacity, kept them and appropriated them to
: his own use, and that while a member of this
association he also resorted to fraudulent prac
tice in order to obtain allowances of sick bene
fits to which ne was not entitled.
The whole question before you, gentlemen,
turns upon this plea which is called in law
"A plea of the truth in justification. "
My learned young friend on the other side
has chosen to place himself before you in a
position of humble standing, alleging his lack
of learning, alleging his lack of experience.
Let me tell him that in the cause of truth and
justice these are advantages. It does not need
a lawyer to point out truth to your oyes. The
truthful woman who appears before you does
not need a lawyer to point out to the jury that
she is a good and truthful woman. If the
cause of the plaintiff is true, if lie has been in
jured, if his character has been such in this
community that these charges against him
have produced a wrong, his own wrong would
speak triumphantly and be aided by the voice
ox the most part of the world. \
Now, gentlemen, let us examine the charges
before us. The first charge is that of embez
zlement. Well, that consists of two items. In
the first place these are not great items. We
do not charge that Mr. Chase embezzled $50,
--000 or if 100,000 as some bank cashiers or presi
dents have done. You have seen these Forest
ers. It is the first time in my life that my at
tention has been especially called to them.
They seem to be well-meaning, earnest people,
blacksmiths, carpenters, worters of all kinds,
daily laborers and contractors, all flocking to
gether according to the great laws of the earth
to afford ample support in the hour of distress,
in the hour of sickness and in the great hour
of sorrow and death.
Now, here is a humble woman cooking in &
saloon on Second street. Ido not Know why it
lies in the mouth of the attorney of Mr. Chase,
who himself, although a Good Templar,
kept a saloon on Brannan street, to
criticize her occupation. If there be any
taint or disgrace in the occupation it applies
to him as well as to her. This woman tells
you that this man came to her after he had
ceased to be a member of Court Washington
and collected $1 80 from herâ not a very large
sum, but yet it took a few days of hard work
from her, and she paid it to htm, being $1 30
for two months' duesâ os cents per monthâ
and 50 cents for a death rate. She tells you
specifically he took her book from her, and
that money never was paid by Mr. Chase into
the funds of that court. We deem that if he
received it then for that purpose he em
bezzled, and the only question for you to de
termine is, Did he receive it? or, in other
words, Is Mrs. Lyons telling the truth? For
what motive she could have for that falsifying
upon that subject nobody can imagine.
The counsel says: "Of course I do not charge
that this woman was bought by Mr. Shortridge.
'Of course I do not charge that she was tam
pered with by counsel on the other side."
But he clearly insinuates, and if such be the
Insinuation it hardly deserves a reply. A
charge of that kind cannot be supported by
insinuation, especially when it would be as
false as it is in this case.
If Mrs. Lyons is telling the truth, therefore,
it being admitted that that money was not
paia over by Chase into Court Washington, it
is a fact that he embezzled.
Mr. Chase had claimed that the money
received by him from Mrs. Lyons was the
initiation fee to another circle, but Mr.
Delmas dwell upon the fact that no at
tempt had been made to prove that allega
tion, which would have been easily suscep
tible of proof if true. He left to the jury
the question of veracity between Mrs.
Lyons and Mr. Chase.
The plaintiff had aserted that instead of
being expelled from the Ancient Order of
Foresters he had withdrawn from it be
cause it is an English order. Mr. Delmas
took that up in connection with another
item of the embezzlement charges, and he
said :
We will now take Mr. Frederickson and his
initiation fee of $2. Mr. Fred?rickson is one

of the men of very moderate means and it's a
matter of marvel to me, gentlemen, It is &
matter of wonderment to me, that an American
of such Americanism as Mr. Chase, whoshrank
with horror at the idea of being connected
with the English institution, that he could
have received the $2 from Mr. Frederiekson,
who is a Dane. But he received this $2, and
there is no ques tion about that. But did he
pay it over into the treasury?
Miss Nelson, the treasurer or financial secre
tary, produced her books. She says that she
never received the money from him ; that she
asked him io y>ay it over, but that he never
paid It. He alleged that ho was amply respon
sible for the amount, and he remains respon
sible to this day; and financially the lodge (or
court) under these circumstances forgave the
$2 initiation fee for Mr. Krederickson.
The simple proposition, gentlemen, is
whether Mr. Chase, upon this subject, is tell
ing the truth, or whether Miss Nelson is tell
ing the truth; whether Chase kept that $2, or
whether Miss Nelson stole, as counsel inti
mated, that $2 received from the Dane, Mr.
Frederickson.
Mr. Chase, gentlemen, was expelledâigno
miniously expelledâ from the Order of Fores
ters. That is not a matter with which Tin:
Cali, had anything to do. It was a trial in
which we didn't participate. It was a trial of
the court, as I understand it, the court of high
est jurisdiction in that order, composed of ear
nest, upright men, desiring to do what was
right, desiring to declare and enforce justice.
Mr. Chase appeared with the Fame counsel
that represented him here. That court, sitting
as you now sit, doing justice, unanimously
pronounced him guilty.
After some discussion as to the merits and
demerits of the case the court decreed that
John G. Cnase Sr. be found guilty as charged.
All the members of the committee voted in
favor of the motion. It was further declared
that "the verdict of the committee be that
said John G. Chase be expelled from the order
for the period of ninety-nine years." That
was a fair and impartial trial, and certainly
we had nothing to do with offering any evi
dence there against Mr. Chase. It was a trial
among his own friends, among his own breth
ren, represented by his own counsel ; and
the jury after discussion, sitting by themselves,
as you will see, unanimously declared him
guilty as charged.
â¦ â¢ â¢ Mr. Chase claimed that he was sick
with smallpox; not Uvo days later he was seen
driving along Market street on a load of lum
ber. Two days after he was so dangerously
sick he was cured by a dose of cobblestones on
Market street administered through a lumber
wagon. * â¢ *
You can appreciate what it is to get out
every morning with the regularity of the
rising sun a newspaper of twelve or sixteen
pages with all the matter that goes to make
up a great metropolitan journal. Judge Mr.
Shortridge by what he has done. Was malice
his purpose in this publication? He did not
know Chase. He had never had any dealings
with him.
These facts were brought under his notice
after the charges had been brought up in the
Foresters' court. Ho deemed it his duty to
publish these charges and he has done so.
Mr. Delmas closed his address with a
request that The Call be vindicated for
its action in publishing news that the fra
ternal organizations with which Mr. Chase
might associate himself had a right to
know. '

MONASTICISM IN AMERICA
Major T. C. Ryan Declares It
Has No Place in the
United States.
HIS VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT.
Convents and Monasteries Alleged to
Be Maintained in Defiance
of Law.
Major T. C. Ryan, the eloquent speaker
in the cause of the A. P. A., last night
again attracted a large attendance to Met
ropolitan Hall.
President B. P. Hudelsqn of the State
Council of the A. P. A. opened the meet
ing by asking the audience to sing "Amer
ica." This done, he spoke as follows:
Friends: It is not my purpose to attempt to
make a sueech or anything like a speech this
evening. lam before you principally to per
form a duty that la laden with pleasure and
honorâ that of introducing Major Kvan. Since
his coining into our midst we have been made
to realize more than ever our great responsi
bility in this tremendous hour of our country's
life and history.
If there is an American within the border
lines of the United States to-tlay who does not
realize that this is a critical hour in the history
of our Republic, that man is not alive to the
issue and his eyes have not yet opened to look
upon the great and momentous questions and
problems with which we are confronted.
1 am giad that in the far-away West the peo
ple are becoming aroused as never beforeâ the
people are thinking as they have not thought
for very many years. And after studying the
situation carefully for a year or more in the
State of California, I will say to-night, it is my
profound conviction that the people are so
thoroughly aroused in California that with
two or three exceptions it is an absolute im
possibility to elect to any office in any county
of the Slate any man who is under the domin
ation and control of the Roman Catholic
Church.
This is certainly encouraging, and. as we
think of this, we can, indeed, congratulate our
selves. Friends, let us, as true, liberty-loving
men understand that we are standing for
great principles. Let us ever rise above these
little bickerings; these contemptible questions,
whan compared with the momentous ques
tions confronting us. This is an hour when 1
hear a voice and call from the Almighty (iod
to every man and woman in America to ri.se in
their might and do their whole duty. Let us
hear that voice and forget the little things.
The hour is coming when we, like the fath
ers of this great Republic, must forget the little
questions on which we have been divided
heretofore. I trust that in all these meetings,
in all our work, there shall be that harmony
that conduces to the upbuilding of our great
order and the observance of the great prin
ciples that conduce to the up-building of our
magnificent Government and the perpetuation
ot our American institutions.
In introducine Major Ryan he paid a
high tribute to that gentleman's elo
quence and probity. MajqrKyan spoke as
follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It
gives me great pleasure to stand before this
audience in the discussion of what to me is a
great <iuestion. 1 have chosen for my subject
"Monasticisrr has no place in the Republic." I
hope to impress you with the thought that in
a land of liberty there is actually no place for
an institution into which the citizen of good
repute may not walk at any time and investi
gate as to its character.
A real man ought to be able to govern him
self; a real man ought to be able to pray for
himself; a real man ought to be able to tight
for himself, and a really honest man ought to
pay all his bills himself. We are now too much
inclined to leave these duties to others. The
duties of American citizenship fail to impress
us as they onght. We fail to remember that
our liberties have been handed down to ur at
a tremendous sccrifico of blood and treasure.
We fail to remember that a nation.is a family
largely extended and thai a father always en
deavors to prevent the introduction into his
family of anything detrimental or menacing
to the best interests of his family. The same
holds good of a Government, which should pre
vent the introduction of everything that may
be a menace to tbe welfare of the Nation.
Peace is never likely to come to America
until we order the Jesuits from our borders.
With the coining of these Jesuits has come the
low idea of citizenship. I believe that citizen
ship shoul'i not be conferredon anyone unless
he has shown his ability to perform the duties
of an American citizen and a patriot. Citizen
ship is one of the cheapest thiugs in the I'nited
States to-day. I believe it should be obtain
able only at a great price; there ought to be a
premium on it. Along with the Jesuits have
come anarchism and all the worst aspects of
socialism.
He then mentioned a number of organi
zations wbich lie said came with these
Jesuits, and included also the inmates and
those in control of monasteries and con
vents. Continuing, he said : "Monasticism
is but the adopted child of paganism,
nothing more or less." He described mo
nastic institutions as "constructed like
penal structures, and behind the walls of
Which no law officer, or even the President
of the United States, can go without the
permission of some foreigner, who has no
respect for American institutions." He
continued:
I do not know what is going on behind those
walls, and I do not care, but I object to any
foreign power coming here and defying the
power of our authorities. Let me say to you
that the time is near in Missouri when no or
ganization will feel it necessary to petition tlia
Legislature or the Governor of that State to
open these monastic institutions there. The
young people are growing up and will soon
have the ballot in their hauds, and they will
see that such men are elected that petitions
will be unnecessary for this nurpose.
The first principle of conventual life is the
crushing out of natural instincts-. These
people of whom I am going to speak have
been improperly educated. They think it is
impossible to be in the world and not of it. â 
Instances were cited 10 show that this
idea wa.^ wrong â that contact with evil
does not necessarily contaminate. Refer*
ence was the*n made to the requirements
for leading a monastic life, the abjuration
of all that, is most passionately loved,
whether music, flowers or children. Then
the renunciation of the wiil power by
monastics and conventual inmates was
spoken of. Tnese requirements, he said,
were impeachments oi the wisdom of God.
He added:
Uo you realize that a life in a monastic in
stitution requires the renunciation of a moth
or's love, that sweetest thing in human life?
If I had a son I would rather he carried the
instinct of murder in him throughout life; I
would rather he carried the instinct of theft
throughout his life; than forget his love for
the mother that bore him.
Any organization that requires the renun
ciation of the love of music, of flowers, of home,
of mother, is unfit to exist within the domains
of this Republic of liberty.
The people who live in these secluded build
ings are barred from that intellectual growth
that comes with wide interchange of thought.
They uelieve that pure thoughts can only be
cultivated in this isolation. They fail to con
ceive that the pure in mind has never any but
puro thoughts- Think of a person extremely
lond of Kood literature being compelled to re
nounce all except a fevr prescribed Docks. This
is not only un-American, It is un-Christianlike.
Monastici9m ro'us its inmates of all that is
good and dear in friendship. What has God
created us for, anyway? Wo are put here to
aid others as well as ourselves. When a man
or a woman is shut up in a monastery or a con
vent all this power for good to otners is taken
away from t tie in.
In monnsticism we are deprived of the won
derful and great influence of women for good.
I protest against this state of things. It is a
relic of barbarism.
CRISPI'S BLACK EYE.
How PuptU of the Italian School I'p
-Im-IÂ«I Their Honor.
There is a hard-working little woman,
proprietress of -a stationary-store on Pacific
street, between Stockton and Powell, who
can hear evidence to the fact that there are
stanch defenders of Italy's cause among
the rising generation of the local colony.
She took the unfortunate idea into her
head on Thursday of exposing in her store
window Le Petit Parisien, a French news
paper, whose title-page was adorned with
a caricature of Menelik administering pun
ishment to Crispi. A band of pupils, re
turning from the Italian school, liappened
to pause before the window to gaze at the
rich stores of marbles and other delights of
boyhood which it contained, and their
eyes were caught by the sight of C rip pi in
Bersagliere uniform fighting with Wene
lit. According to the pittire, Crispi had
received a pronounced black eye.
"Impossible," cried the boys, "this is an
insult to the Italiansâ to our lively sharp
shootersâlet us tear up the paper." No
sooner said than done; v deputation of the
diminuitive warriors entered the store and
intimated to the proprietress that she had
better hide the Crisni-Menelik !ight. The
good woman begged to be excused, saying
that it was a matter of business with her
to expose her wares where they would
catch the public eye but this was not re
ceived as a satisfactory excuse by the little
fellows, and they were proceeding to
menace her window when she concluded
that it would be wise to capitulate. The
odious Petit Parisien was removed from
the public, view and hidden under a pile of
old periodicals, after which the small war
riors left the field of battle, jumping for
joy at the victory they had won.
FOR CONVALESCENT WOMEN.
Farlor Meeting in the Interests of the
New Institution.
A profitable parlor meeting was held at
the home of Mrs. G. Barstow, 927 Pine
street, yesterday afternoon in the interests
of the philanthropy for women under the
auspices of the French Christian Union.
The design is to build up a borne fur con
valescent women in connection with La
Famille at Torrens court. It has been
recommended by. hospital authorities of
the City that such an institution be en
couraeed, as the need for it is great. "La
Famille." the home for young women who
are temporarily unemployed, is one of the
worthy charities of the City.
Mine. Marie Marshall presented the
work in a manner calculated to interest
the large audience. She emphasized the,
fact that the work of the French Christian
Union is non-sectarian and has no na-
tional lines.
A feature of the afternoon was the ar
tistic rendering of a Haydn trio by the
daughter and two sons of Dr. Huss.'Miss
Huss accompanying them at the piano.
Will Not Enter Politics.
The Woman Suffrage Association is adhering
to its policy to affiliate with no political party.
An invitation from the Woman's Republican
Central Club to join its ranks has been ig
nored. The request that it be read at thÂ«
meeting of the association on Tuesday was
refused because of that policy which Miss
Anthony impressed upon her followers in her
final instructions in May.

The rifle and trap shooting clubs will
gather at the Oakland and Shell Mound
parks to-morrow where several interesting
matches will be decided.
Judging by the many boats that are be

Oakland a very lively season of aquatics
may be expected.
As the Olympic Club will hold a boxing
tournament in April in the Pavilion inter

Now that the big indoor tournament is
over, as far as the club wheelmen are con
cerned, they are turning some attention to
the sport in other directions. Touring will
he very popular from now on, and the
great annual relay is only distant three
weeks from to-morrow.
The recent indoor meeting has been an
immense success from all points of view.
The dealers have profited immensely by
the advertising it gave them and the way
it boomed the sport. The racing men were
brought into competition with one another
pportunitv to win valuable
s. The interest in clubs was revived,
for it had lagged somewhat during the
winter monl
There was intense rivalry between the
Bay City Wheelmen 111111* the Olympic
Club Wheelmen, out it was the sort of
r:\alry which promotes the sport. Thurs
day night, when Wells, Bay lity, beat Ed
wards, Olympic, in a match race, there
â¢i the malti se cross cam]).
Later in the evening the tables were
turned, and Tantau, Olympic, bent Grif
fiths, Bay City, in a five-mile match race;
but the Ba} Citya did not sulk. They
joined in the Olympic Club yell, which
fhook the building, and grasped hands
with the Olympics, saving: "Now it's
horse and horse; the honors are easy. 1 '
And the goon -fellowship which is so char
acteristic of the individual members of the
two clubs on the road was preserved in
the same decree as rivals for supremacy
in track honors. This Is .all as it should
bp, and marks a new Â«-m in the sport on
this coast, for heretofore there has always
been endless strife between these
two big clubs The hatchet was
I ractically buried Thursday nisht when
'resident Kerrigan of the Bay Citya
grasped hands with President Adams 01
the Olympics directly after the Tantau-
Grimths race, and they declared it '"horse
and horse." The Olympics were glad to
win, the Bay Citys were glad they had won.
A:iti thus eni- a fight which commenced
in 1884, when several active cyclers who
withdrew from the old San Francisco Bi
cycle Club, which was absorbed by the
Olympics in 1893, organized the Bay City
Wnenlmen. The rivalry has always been
extreme, and it was carried into the Olym
pic Club. It will be just as intense in the
future, but in a gentlemanly sportsmanlike
Way.
The most consistent performer during
the indoor meet of the new racing men was
George Tantau of the Olympic Club Wheel
men. Last Tuesday night was the only
night during the entire tournament that
lie did not win a heat, semi-final or a rinal.
His record is summarized as follows:
Thursday niirht (opening night), won
ninth heat mile scratch; won third semi
fnial; also rode dead heat with Griffiths,
Bay City, in the ten-mile club cup
race. Friday night, won eleventh beat
mile handicap, from 45 yards, and third
semi-final; won third heat two-mile
scratch. Saturday night, won third heat
mile invitation; " lost semi-rinal, but al
lowed in rinal on a foul; won linal in
2:303-5. Monday night, won fourteenth
beat mile handicap, 45 yards; won fourth
semi-final. Tuesday night, won nothing.
Wednesday night, in quarter-mile scratch,
won third neat, second semi-final, and rode
second to Edwards in the linal. Thursday
night, defeated Griffiths, Bay City, in live
mile match race. Time, 13:26
For s new rider this is 1 remarkably fine
record, and Tantau, who is ft modest, un
assuming young man, is deserving of all
the credit that has been showered apon
him. He rode all his races fairly and be
came very popular with the Pavilion audi
ences.
The California Cycling Club will hold a
ten-mile try-out to-morrow from Fruit vaii
to Hay-wards, to aid in the selection of the
club's' relay team, which will be particu
larly stroiifr this yoar.
The regular monthly meeting; of the
North California division, League of
American Wheelmen, will be held next
Saturday evening at 8 o'clock at the rooms
of the Gar-len City Cyclsrp. San JoÂ«e. All
the delegates from this City and Oakland
will go down early Saturday afternoon,
some !>y wheel and others by train. Chief
Consul Kerrigan and the secretary-treas
urer are going down on a tandem and offer
to pace any of the delegates or officials
who think they can ride fast enough to
keep up with them.
The steamer Alviso, which makes daily
trips between Alviso ai.rt this City, will
hereafter leave the furmer port for here at
7 r. M., the old time card having been
changed. It is a popular route for wheel
men returning from a trip to Snn Jo:-e, as
they only have to ride a few miles op on
the Oakland side and then take the steamer
and liave :: pleasant trip home by water.
The run of the Camera Club Cyclists will
return that .vay to-morrow.
The Olympic Cyclers have a joint run
scheduled for to-morrow with the Garden
City Cyclers at Centerville. After one of
If r- Gregory's fine lunches, for which fee
has become celebrated among the wheol-
Baen. there will be a match camÂ« of base
ball between nines from the two clubs and
other competitive athletic events.
W. K. Bouton, who has beid the position
of secretary of the Liberty Cycling Club
for the past two y<-ars, has resigned his
office, owing to press of business. Frank
Thrali has been appointed secretary pro
tern, until the next reirular election of the
club, which will be held on Tuesday,
March 12.
The < harden City Cyclers will hold a five
mila handicap road race next Sunday
over a new course which they have re
cently chosen, from Morgan U ill to San
Martine, Santa Clara County. The start
ing-point is about twenty-one miles south
of San Jose. In this race Otto Ziec'.er Jr.
will ride trim the scratch mark, paced by
tandemÂ«, and as the course is perfectly
straight, smooth and level, he hopes 'to
reduce Hamiin's world's five-mile road rec
fcrd of 11 :11 2-5. After the race the cyclers
will hold a bullshead breakfast and bar
becue. They have invited the It-ague
officials, who will hold a meeting in San
Jose the night before, to attend, and the
invitation has been accepted.
A physician offers the following sugees
tions to wheelmen: "Remember that a
long ride on a hot and dusty road beneath
a hot broiling sun is attended by consider
able fatigue and perspiration. Always
take a coat with you to use when alighting
from your wheel. Do not stand around in
some draught for the danger of taking cold
is very great. Throw your coat over your
shoulders at least. Don't kill yourself on
the road; there is no reason forover-exer
tion in a spin for pleasure, if it is expedi
ent to make a fast run and you come home
in a >:reiit state of perspiration do not take
a cold bath; dry the body well and b?the
in lukewarm water, afterward refreshing
yourself with a cold shower bath. And,
whatever you do, don't smoke while you
are riding."
The regular meeting of the Imperial Cy
cling Club will be held next Monday
yev c yen ing.
The Olympic Club will have a club run
to Redwood City to-morrow. The mem
bers will take the 10:45 train to MillDrue,

The laiest news about Arthur A. Zim

"The Camera Club Cyclists will tour to
San Jose to-morrow, Maying ontheÃ:4j
narrow-gauge boat for Alameda. Alter
luncheon at San Jose the cyclists will visit
Alum Rock Canyon, where those who
t.ike their cameras can get some
pretty views. The return home will be
made by steamer Irom Alviso, leaving that
point at 7 p. m.. or those who wish can take
the train at San Jose. Captain Argenti
assures an easy pace, and expects a large
number to make the run.
The San Francisco Road Club is growing
rapidly in membership, seventeen new ap
plicants having been admitted at the last
meeting. The racing men of the club
showed up particularly well at the recent
indoor tournament and gave the club a
standing in that branch of the sport. Last
Saturday evening after the races the club
aave a banquet to some of the visiting
members of the Petaluma Wheelmen and
San Jose Road Club who were its guests.
Captain Pixley acted as toastmaster, and a
â very jolly time was had.
The Liberty Cycling Club will have a
run to Centerville to-morrow, taking the
9a. m. broad-gauge boat. A committee of
three, consisting of W. E. Bouton, J. Mc-
Laughlin and W. Beattie, has been ap
pointed to arrange for a five-mile road
race from San Leandro to Haywards on
April 10.
An Eastern cycling paper tells of a queer
race which was run in South Africa a few
weeks ago. For some time the question of
the speed of an ostrich has been the sub
ject of considerable discussion, and a
noted cyclist there determined lo test his
speed against the powerful bin.. A smooth
course was selected and the chase began.
The wheelman drove the pedals around
with great velocity and came abreast of
the bird. No sooner did it perceive the
man than it started at a headlong gait, and
although the rider was covering ground at
a two-minute clip, the ostrich quickly dis
tanced him.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a ten
mile road race a week from to-morrow.
Some of the entrants will be Wells, Long,
the Terrills, Hall, Vincent, Day. Reid,
Menne, Languetin, Freeman, McKay and
Goddard.
To-morrow a joint run of the Imperial
Cycling Club of this City and the santa
Rosa Wheelmen will be held at Santa
Rosa. The members of the local club
will take the 7:30 Tiburon ferry and the
train to Santa Rosa, using their wheeis
there.
Since the upper crust of soe'ety adopted I
the wheel, says a prominent dealer, there j
has been little hesitancy on the part of the >
middle class to fail in line with the gene- j
ral procession. Rich and poor alike enjoy !
the exnihrating pastime. It isa sure roa>i ;
to health and strength. An insight to j
nature can be had in no better way than
on the seat of a bicycle. It affords the j
laboring classes an opportunity of reach
ing their places of labor without the daily
expenditure of from 10 to 20 cents in caf
fare, and this little sum will grow into I
hundreds in years, and those hundreds j
will uuild a home. While the rich use the !
wiieel for recreation, the less fortunate j
mortals use it for business as well as
pleasure.
The Adeline Cycle Club of Adeline sta

THE BOXERS.
AH About Green, Ryan, Corbett and
Fltzslmmonsâ Skull Protectors.
The National Athletic Club has an
nounced that its next fistic exhibition will
be held in April and that the stars of the
evening will be George Green, the boxer
who defeated Danny Needham at the
Auditorium last month, and Tommy
Ryan, the Chicago weiter- weight, who was
defeated a few evenings ago by "Kid"
McCoy before the Empire Athletic Club of
Long Island, N. Y.
According to the latest news from the
ring side, it appears that Ryan was not in
as good condition as he might have been,
and besides, he met an opponent who
handicapped him several pounds in
weight. McCoy, however, proved to be a
tolerably clever and game fellow, and also
a heavy puncher.
Commenting on the match, this is what
the New York Sun gays: 'Ryan was a
I strong favorite at 2 to 1 when the match
was made; the sports predicted that Mc-
Coy would certainly be defeated, but those
familiar with Ryan said that he was not a
j game fellow, and could, not undergo pun
ishment without quitting." "Why," said
a clubman once when he had Ryan booked
for a right, "he is the hardest man in the
world to get in the ring. He is like a rat,
for you have to corner him before you can
make him tight." When he did "right he
was all there and the sporting men never
j let slip any opportunity to pee him meas
i ure his sjteed against some other man, and
that is why a big crowd jonrneyed_io Mas
j peth, L. 1., last night in the face of a nasty
i wind storm. It was a punching match
â  from the call of time. McCoy astonished
| the crowd by the ease with which he
! punched and got away. Most of the time
| Ryan was on the run, but he was not fast
enough to avoid his opponent.
"McCoy assumed the lead and the aggres
sive from the start, and after he had struck
! .Ryan as he pleased for eleven rounds he
j forced him entirel}' on the defensive. No
I one had doubted the result after the eighth
j ruund. One minute and rifty-four seconds
i of the fifteenth bad gone by when McCoy
, crossed Ryan with a right and left punch
lon the jaw. Ryan dropped to the floor
; and was counted out. McCoy DOW has an
j excellent claim to the welter-weight ciiam-
I pionship of the world, and no doubt Ryan
| regrets having separated from his old
manager, Parson Davies. Larry Burns
and Jack Downey fought an eight-round
preiiminarv, which the referee, Tim Hurst,
decided a draw."
So far as George Green is concerned
Ryau will find the Californian as g:une as
a Mongolian pheasant and as clever as any
of the boxers of the present day. Green
stands an excellent chance of whipping
the Chicago welter-weight, but it can be
safely said, however, that a contest between
men of the caliber of Green and Ryan
should prove very interesting and well
wonh croing a long distance to see. It is
to be hoped that the National Club wili
secure this match.
As a precaution against possible acci
dents it lias been -suggested, that the man
agers of the Nationel Club place padding
on the floor so as to softly receive the skull
of any representative of the awkward box
in? squad who may fall like the great Mc-
Goldrich of Los Angeles on Thursday
evening last, when he lost his equilibrium
owing to a failure on his part to protect
his chin from attack. A hint to the wise
in this respect should prove sufficient. A
fall upon a hard floor is frequently at
tended with serious results, especially
when a knock-out blow is administered.
The following article concerning Cor
bett, Fitzsimmons et al. appeared in the
New York Sun, and some good, sound
arguments are produced in it to prove that
Corbett is a better man as a lighter than
Fitzsimmons:
James J. Corbett, it is stated on excellent
authority, is trying to arrange his Western
trip so that he can return Kast for the purpose
of having a businesslike talk with Robert Fitz
simmons. ('ort)ett haR made several mistake'
in iiis lifetime, anl one was made on the night
when he turned over the world's heavy-weighi
championship to I'eter Maher. He reolizes
that it was foolish to take that step, but his
most intimate friend explains the situation in
tii is way: "Corbett is not only a boxer, but
lie is also a business man. Heis willing to
yield to any demands within reason that may
be made on his time to the neglect of his busi
ness,'but he does not propose to ruin his
money-making ability as an actor. Last year
Coroett exhausted several months getting
ready for Fitzsimm'ons, and every man who
knows anything about boxing knows that Jim
was not only in condition, but was anxious to
settle the question of trie championship. Win
or lose, he wanted the case decided. He ex
pected to win, but he viewed the fight in the
light that it would be better to lose than have
this tiresome rivalry continue.
When the year opened Corbett had made all
arrangements to go on the road; his company
had been sinned ana his route laid out. For
him to default at the last moment meant the
loss of a large sum of money, and besides he
would suntain a loss to his business reputation
it he breke his engagements. His friends nd
vised him to give up tne championship for the
reason that if he fought Maher and won he
would have to fight Fitzsinimons, thus making
two lights, and on the other hand if he fought
Fitz with the opening of the new year he would
have Maher following him about for tliÂ«> re
mainder of 189(>. To-day he has only one man
to light, and that is Fitzsimmons. Fitz must
tight him, or Corbett -naturally becomes the
holder of the championship. Let me say right
nere that tbere is not a cowardly bone in Jim
Corbett's body, -and he does not deserve the
abuse that has been showered upon him so
unstiuudly. Compare his record with that of
Fitzsimmons I Corbett never laid down for
$35. Tha most creditabie fight of his life was
against Peter Jackson, and yet there is a man
that Bob Fitzsimmons has said he could not
defeat.
The only chance that Fitz has to defeat Cor
bett is by a chance blow, and I think that is
not a very bis one. Corbett does not shrink
from it, and it may interest the public to know
that Corbett last 'fall trained up to the best
condition of his life Oi course he was two
years older than when he fought Mitchell. He
had deteriorated perhaps^.o percent, but he
was 40 percent better than JoeChoynski when
Joe narrowly missed beating Fitzsimmons at
Boston. Another thing not generally known
is that Corbett has a new punch that is an im
provement on the celebrated Fitzsimmons
puncn. It is the surest, most accurate blow
Jim has ever tried, and in practice it has never
yet failed to work. Much has been said against
Corbetts health, and I desire to say that, whiie
he has been sick at times, he is really in first
class health. Last summer and full he had
trouble with his knee, but that was conquersd.
His stomach never required more than two or
three days to get in good condition. Those who
are willing to back him have not the slightest
cause for alarm, and you have only to ask one
of his backers to know how they feel regarding
him to get Jin expression of satisfaction.
The so-called dead-game sports who haunt
barrooms, wear yellow diamonds and their
best clothes at boxing shows don't like Jim,
aud they never will. What is more, lie does
not care for their friendship. Corbett has al
ways been square and honest in his dealings
wuh all men. He lias been a generous oppo
nent; he attends to his own affairs, and only
.asks for the same treatment in return. Be
cause Bob Fitzsimmons has defeated Peter
Maher twice, that does not prove that he is
a better man than Jim Corbett. There is con
siderable talk about Fitzsimmons making
Corbett wait two years for a light. Well sup
pose that he did so. Corbett is the younger
man and age is telling on Fitzsimmons more
than it is on Corbett. Both men have fought
tneir best tights, but delay will be more serious
to the Australian than to the American. As to
the business Corbett is doing, 1 can say that
since the late fight he is playing to more
money than had been taken in since the year
opened.
THE ANGLERS.
Fly-Casters Will Practice at Stow
Lake This Aftarnoon.
The anglers of this City will be pleased
to learn that the Fish Commissioners have
had some of their deputies patrolling; the
streams which are within easy reach of
the local fraternity.
Last week the clerk of a prominent hotel
at Glen Ellen was arrested by a deputy,
who caught the poacher with trout in his
possession.
The transgressor was taken before a
justice, who lined him $5 and costs. The
coin was handed over and now the resi
dents of (!len Ellen and vicinity who have
a predilection for catching trout out of
season are a bit careful that no strangers
are about when they cast their lines.
Two men were chased by a deputy of San
Rafael a few days ago who happened upon
"the anglers" when they were fishing the
headwaters of Lagnnitas Creek. The deputy
or constable was searching for poachers
who have been killing deer when he en
countered the fishermen.
Bame Warden Mogao discovered recently
a new scheme by which some professional
fishermen who reside near Ager were ship
ping trout to this City. The fish were
taken from the Klanuith River and shipped
in boxes which were labeled "wild rab
bits." The warden looked with suspicious
eyes upon this rather strange address, and
had tne boxes opened for inspection.
They were shipped by (i. Rogers of Ager
to 6. Berti of l'-'O Washington street and
A. J. B. linmel of 1UÂ» Washington street.
The consignees declined to accept the
boxes from the expre>s company, and con
sequently the Game Warden was power
less to arrest the merchants.
During the past month angling for steel
heads in the tide waters of the Russian
River has been very goon. John Butler
and Mr. Donaldson returned from Dun
cans Mills last Tuesday with nine beauti
ful tish, that averaged from two pounds to
eleven pounds in weight. Several tisJi
were also taken from the Taper-mill Creek,
near Point Reyes.
According to the appearance of the
weather a rainstorm is not far off. Con
sequently a rush of winter fishermen is
expected' to-day to various points fre
quen'ed by the handlers ot salmon roe
and shrimp.
John Gallagher, the champion angler of
OaKiand, recently returned from Pesca
dero, where he enjoyed several days of
good fishing in the Pescadero laÂ«oon.
Among a party of anglers who enjoyed
pood fishing ]aÂ«t Sunday near Point Reyes
were Rod McMillan,. lohn Benn, Al Smith.
Louis Rondeau, J. McFarland and several
other disciples whose names oould not be
ascertained. McMillan caught five fish,
but one of the number hn<l the appear
ance of what is generally known among
the jrinteT anglers as a hookbill. "1 con
tend that the fish, notwithstanding its
color, is a stoelhead that has been in fresh
water for some time," said General Battu.
McMillan did not acquiese, however, but
argued thattne fish belonged to the hook
bill variety.
"I a>:ree with you, McMillan," retorted
John Benn. "Any fish that is as brown aa
this fellow must be game and a memner of
the hookbill family. Yes, that's a hook
bill sure enough, Me; can't you see," and
old Benn smiled blandly as ho looked into
the eyes of the handsome disciple of Wal
ton.
The Fly-casting Club will meet this
afternoon at Stow Lake for the purpose of
enjoying a little practice in casting.
A. N. Cheney, the Slate Fish Ctilturist of
New York hasissued the following circu
lar relative to the planting of fry, which
should prove interesting reading to Dep
uty Fish Commissioners:
Rrook, brown, rainbow and Loch Leven trout
should be planted in small spring rivulets
tributary to the larger intended to be stocked.
From the rivulets they will work down as they
grow into thr- main stream.
Lake trout snotild be planted among bowl
ders or rocks on a shoal in midlake very near
to deep water, into which the young trout
soon find their way. In the absence of such
shoals with rocks to afford hiding-places for
the youiiK trout they may be planted on nat
ural spawning-bods, when they are known.
In transporting young trout If tnev come to
the surface of tne water in cans it is a sign of
exhaustion, and the water should bti frequently
aerated by dipping it from the can in a dipper
and let fall into it again from a considerable
height.
It is safer to aerate the water placed in the
cans at the hatchery than to add fresh water
during the jo urney, the qualities of which are
unknown. Should the water in the cans be
eurae warm, the temperature should be reduced
by the addition of ice broken into small pieces.
If the water in the cans containing young
trout should be warmer or colder than the
water in the lane or stream at the time of
planting the fish, the temperature thoula be
equalized by mingling the two waters in the
can before the tish are turned out as marked
changes in the temperature may Kill the young
trout.
Fishcans ordinarily hold about 5000 trout
fry, and not more than three cans of fry
should be planted in one year in a .stream from
six to eight miles long, and the fry should be
well distributed throughout the length of the
stream by planting in rivulets, as previously
stated, as by bunching the plant there is
danger of exnausting the food suitable for the
young tlsh.
Fry or yearling fish should be planted as
soon as received and never under any circum
stances kept over night without constant
watching and aerating the water. Trout are
sent out by the Mate in the spring or fall, as
transportation during the hot months is at
tended with great risk.
Applicants for tisli should so far as pos
sible ascertain the kinds and quality of the
fish food in the streams they desire to plant.
THE OARSMEN.
South End Rowing Club's Entortaln-
mentâ New Shells and Barges.
The South End Rowing Club will hold
its rirst reception in three years on Thurs

Hall.
The club will be assisted mainly by the
Olympic Club Minstrels.
A well arranged programme, chiefly
musical, will take up the tirst two hours of
the evening, to be followed by a reception
and dai.ee.
The committee having the matter in
hand consist- of Messrs. J. E. Scully, John
D. Mahoney, William J. O'Brien, James P.
O'Sliea, John A. Lenalian and Al Fritz.
The South Ends are abo maninc prepar
ations for a championship regatta, to hi
held at El Canipo on Decoration day,
May 30.
The Stockton Athletic Association,
Olynndcs, Ariels, St. Mary's College, Dol
phins, Pioneers and Alamedas are expect
ed.to take part.
Joe Brennan, formerly of the Ariel Club
but now a member of the Farragut Club
of Vallejo, is in the City and states that he
will endeavor to get up a strong crew from
Vallejo to row in the junior events at El
Canipo.
The South Ends will hold a special
meeting next Wednesday evening. Al
Rodger?, the raceboat builder, has been
awarded the contract for building the club
two outrigger skiffs, to be finished by
April 1.
The Ariel Boat Club's entertainment and
dance at Union -square Hall on April 7
promises to be a brilliant success.
The principal professional talent of the
City have volunteered their services, and
the rowing fraternity will undoubtedly
attend in a body.
A new juniorcrew has been orsanized ia
the Pioneer Club, composed of the follow
ing men: W. Foley, stroke; \V. Cook,
afterwaist; F. Panow, forward waist; J.
Hanley, bow and captain; and G. Fitz
simmons, coxswain.
The South End senior barge crew, the
candidates to represent California in the
regattas of the N orth and East, will soon
begin active training.
Within the next two we>ks the Dolphin
Club at North Beach will have selected
its racing crews for the season.
Many candidates for positions in the
boats liave been tried out, and Captain
W. 0. Patch thinks he can select a crew
that will prove worthy emulators of the
crack South End crew.
The Dolphins will all be bedecked in
their new uni forms next Sunday and will
rendezvous at Harbor View.
The rowing fraternity will be pleased to
lf-arn that Bob Ellis, the crack rower of
the Ariel Club, is rapidly recuperating
from the accident he met with recently.
Efforts are now being made to have the
Columbia Boat Club of Oaklapd join the
Pacific Athletic Association.
GUN AND RIFLE.
Contests That Will Be Held To-Mor
row Before the Bi'tts and Trap?.
To-morrow the Gruetli Shooting Section
will hold a prize shooting competition at
Schuetzen Park, San Rafael, and the dis
tribution of prizes won at the butts will
take place on the evening of the 19th inst.
at 421 Post street.
The California and Eintracht Scbuetzen
clubs will also put in an appearance to
morrow at the San Rafael ranges.
Speaking of backing for targets, this is
what Shooting and Fishing says:
Get a piece of boiler-plate of suitable size and
one-quarter of an inch thick and bore holes for
screws. Fix it firmly on two inches or more of
solid hard-wood backing. Cut bottom and bide
pieces to project at;out four inches from the
face of the plate and cover them with two
layers of tin. On the side pieces nail thin
strips, leaving a space between in which the
cardboard slides. Have it at least three inches
from the plate, to prevent its being torn by
splatters. With this arrangement the fresh
targets can be .slid in from the top to replace
the old ones; thu lead will not fly and can be
collected for melting, and if plenty of thick tin
is used the sides will last a long whMe.
Howard Black and C. Neuraan killed
3."j0 Â«eese in one day's shooting recently
near Rio Vista.
There will be a number of trap-shooting
contests held to-morrow at the Oakland
Trotting Park.

WILL MAKE THE SURVEY.
Hearts of the South of the Park
Property - Owners Glad
dened.
AT MR. TILTON'S OWN BISK.
The Work Will Go Ahead in Spite
of the City and County At
torney's Opinion.
If City and County Surveyor Tilton cares
to go ahead and make the survey and
establishment of grades asked by South of
the Park property-owners and then look to
the courts for his compensation he is at
liberty to do so.
The matter came up before the Judiciary
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday, a number of the property
owners being present to urge the matter.
Some time ago when the board was
petitioned to do do the work at an expense
of $11,000 the opinion of City and County
Attorney Creswell was aÂ«ked as to the
i legality of the Surveyor charging anything
[ for the work outside his regular salary.
The answer was in substance that under
the law the $500 per year salary received
by Mr. Tilton was all he was entitled to.
This aroused the property-owners to ask
the opinion of other attorneys who fur
â¢nished opinions that the survey was a legal
charge asrainst the City and the result was
yesterday's argument.
Edward Ewald addressed the committee
i on the great necessity of establishing
j grades so that a sewer system might be
I put in. He said that in the present con
dition of the tract not only the property
but the lives of the residents were in dan
ger, owing tothe manner in which the win
ter rains accumulated in the lower places
to become stagnant and a menace to health
during the summer months. The winter
rains, he said, sometimes made the houses
so dangerous from washing under the
j foundations that the occupants were afraid
to stay in them. He declared that the
i laws quoted by Mr. Creswell, in his opin
ion, had been declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court, and intimated that
i ueless the board granted the request of the
I property-owners to have the work done by
Mr. Tllton as City Surveyor suits would
be brought to compel them to do so.
Mr. Ewald also intimated that Mayor
Sutro was opposed to the work because he
wanted all ttie improvements made on the
north side, in which he was more inter
ested.
Mayor Sutro then opposed the proposed
survey on the eround that at present it
would be a waste of money to survey the
tract and establisti grades* in the present
condition of the district because of the
shifting sands. He declared that the first
thing to do was to plant grass and shrubs
on the sandhills so that they would be
come stationary and not sllift over the
stakes and monuments as fast as they
were placed.
Mr. Ewald explained that the district
which was to be surveyed did not contain
shifting sand, and that the larger portion
was already covered with grass and shrubs.
Tne motion to recommend the authoriz
ing of the Surveyor to go ahead with the
work was passed unanimously.
A LUXURIOUS MONGOL.
Ridea in a Pullman, Eats Big Dinners
and Insists on Going Buck
to China.
United States Marshal Frank Morrell of
"Williams, Ariz., arrived here yesterday in
charpe of a Chinese woman 75 years old,
who is to be sent back to China in default
of the usual certificate allowing her to re
main. It is a singular case and the Gov
ernment has been trying for a year ana a
half past to avoid the expense of deporta
tion. The elderly Ci.inese woman, how
ever, who was discovered on this side of
the Mexican border, has been determined
that the deportation law of this country
shall be carried into effect.
She wants to go home to die, and as she
realizes the cannot live much longer, and
doesn't want to spare any of her own
money, she insists that X'ncle Sam pay
her expenses home. On the train from
the south she occupied a seat in one of the
finest Pullman cars and ate her meals reg
ularly in the dining-car. As she is an Ori
ental of anything but hitrh degree such
luxury was never before known by her,
and she seemed to enjoy it to the utmost.
Her expenses must "be paid back to
China, as they have been here.

REMEDIES CURE
CATARRH m ALL THROAT AND LOG
DISEASES.
Catarrh Leads to Indigestion, Insomnia,
Nervous Disorders, Consumption and
Many Other Diseasesâ Munyon .Posi-
tively Cures by His New Method.
Catarrh, itself an unpleasant disease, is
an insidious foe, and leads to other very
serious diseases. If not cured it will ex-
tend to the stomach and affect the di-
gestive organs, causing dyspepsia, which
makes life a burden. Weakness, debility,
insomnia and even insanity have followed.
Catarrh negiected also reaches the lungs
and ends in consumption and death. Dis-
charges from the Nose and Throat, Baa
Breath. Stuffed- np Nostrils and Head,
Pressure and Sharp Fains in the Head,
Dizziness, Sneezing, Nose-blred, Inflamed
Watery Eyes, liability to take Cold, stupid
heavy "feeling in the Head, Nausea, Deaf-
ness and Hawking and Spitting of Mucus
are some of the symptoms of catarrh.. -
Are you a sufferer with catarrh? Have
you taken all sorts of drugs and patent
nostrums? Are you tired of paying big
doctor bills without being cured? Are you
willing to spend 50 cents for a cure that
permanently cures catarrh by removing
the cause of the disease? If so, ask your
druggist for a 25-cent bottle of Munyon'a
Catarrh Cure and a 25-cent bottle of Ca-
tarrh Tablets. The Catarrh Cure will
eradicate the disease from the system and
the Tablets will cleanse and heal the
afflicted parts and restore them to a health-
ful and natural condition.
:=-;,; :;fi A Specific for Each Disease.
Professor Munyon puts up a separate
remedy for every disease. His Rheuma-
tism Cure seldom fails to relieve rheuma-
tism in from one to three hours and cures
in a few days. His dyspepsia Cure speed- â¢
ily cures all forms of stemach troubles.
His Cold Cure never fails to cure the most
severe cold in a few hours. The Munyon
Remedies are sold at all druggist's, mostly
at 25 cents a boitle.

Probability That Counsel for the Rail

Chief Counsel Herrin concluded his ar
gument in the Southern Pacific case in the
United Ststes Circuit Court yesterday
morning, closing his three days' speech
with a scathing denunciation of the prac
tice in vogue on the part of political par
tie* in exacting pledges from candidates,
whereby they engaged to perform certain
public acts after their election.
'"One of the Railway Commissioners, a
defendant in this action," continued Mr.
Herrin, "was pledged by his party to
secure a reduction of freight rates. It ;s a
remarkable fact that the only reduction

made by this commission was in the
case of the Southern Pacific, to the exclu
sion of the other lines in California. The
act of a party or people in pledeing a Rail
road Commissioner to reduce rates, or
to perform any other function whatever,
is unexampled in the history of any State,
save California. I maintain that if ihe
acts of a body pledged before election to
do certain ihincs were to be sustained by
the court ii would virtually mean a con
fiscation of railroad property in Cali
fornia."
At the close of Mr. Herrin's argument
Mr. Pillsbury, who was to have been the
next to address the court, waived his right
to speak at this juncture, provided he
might be allowed to do so later.
Judge McKenna said he could see no rea
son for not acceding to Mr. Pillsbnry's re
qnost, if the other counsel had noobjection
to ita being granted. For himself, he said,
the order in which the arguments might
be made wab of no moment.
After a brief sottovoce discussion among
the barristerial luminaries on both sides
it was decided to allow Mr. Pillsbury to
follow Attorney-General Fitzgerald. As
sistant Attorney-General Anderson will
precede his chief in reciting the history of
the mortgage which the Government holds
against the Central Pacific Company. Ex-
Judge Haynes will follow Mr. Pillsburv,
and Mr. Garber will close for the railroad.
When this course was finally agreed
upon United States District Attorney Foote
addressed the court on behalf of the inter
vention of the United States Government.
Mr. Foote looked rather feeble, and several
time during his spirited address his voice
trembled and became husky. Still his
argument was well worthy of the man,

terpiece of oratory as has been heard

time.
He said that while no court hadfpower
to arbitrarily set aside a legislative enact
ment still courts might use their authority
I in applying the provisions of an enact
| ment to particular cases. He could not
I see how California should be treated by
} any other rule than the other States of the
! Union. If the Government has a right to
; tax one business enterprise it may tax all.
If the power exists in the Railway Com
'â¢. mission to override all other powers, then
I the Federal Government cannot be called
supreme nor the Federal constitution the
I highest law of the land.
"It is pretended now," he continued, "to
reduce the rates of the whole Southern Pa
| cine system and its leased lines. This
seems to strike a blow at the'rudimental
principles of justice. Surely taxation
should be as far as possible uniform.
Why, then, should one institution be
i singled out for attack?"
The matter of reducing transportation
; rates of interstate railways pertained, he
contended, to the Federal Government
and not to the States in particular, nor to
any State-constituted commission. He
cited the law to the effect that Congress
was the proper authority to pass upon
such is>atters. The Government, in con
stituting the railway company a legal cor
poration, supposed that its roads would be
run in a manner conducive to the general
good of the people of the entire Republic.
The corporation was to hold itself in readi
ness to transport troops, munitions and
mail matter as well as freight and pas
sengers. To do this the roads would have to
be kept in perfect order, whatever the cost,
and their owners were responsible under
this head to the Federal Government. He
cited dicta of Justices Field and Waite of
the United States Supreme Court in sup
port of this view.
The railway, he went on to argue,
should be subject to the public control in
so far as its business might affect the pub
lic interest. A diminution in its revenues
might work an injury to the republic,
either by forcing the railway into the
hands of a receiver, or by rendering it un
able to make any contributions to the
sinking fund. With the- railway thus
crippled, he said, many evils might with
reason be apprehended. Who could tell
when war might cast its blighting shade
over this country? In such an event the
utility of the railway to the country at
large would be luminously apparent.
How, save by means of the railway, could
troops, ammunition and supplies be con
veyed across the continent to places where
they might be most urgently needed.
"Congress," Mr. Foote went on to state,
"has given evidence of its intent to retain
the right of supervising the business of the
transcontinental railway and of regulating
its rates in case they mfght require adjust
ment. This right stiil remains with Con
gress, and has never been transferred to
the jurisdiction of any other tribunal."
Mr. Foote gave an outline of the rail
way's history, dwelling particularly upon
the events in connection with its incorpor
ation, as tending to show that the Federal
Government had retained in express terms
the right to control the operation of the
road, placing it under the jurisdiction of
Congress.
"The Government," he said, "aided the
establishment of the railway as a National
thoroughfare, a transcontinental highway
between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
this ReDUblic. The project hung fire for
some years, until the civil war opened the
eyes of the people to the need of such a Na
tional highway, and the scheme was forth
with carried into effect."
In conclusion Mr. Foote said the ques
tion to be decided was whether the action
of the Railway Commission in the present
instance could be considered constitu
tional. He claimed he had proved to his
| own entire satisfaction, if to no one else's,
I that the Railway Commission had no con-
I stitutional right to take such action. Con
| gross reserved to itself the power to limit
j railway transportation rates, and had not
delegated that power. * Regard must also
! be had to the principles of natural justice
| and equity underlying the case at issue.
The railway, the country's protection in
the day of war and its comfort in time of
peace, had done much to render California
great and famous. He thought Califor
nia's hand should be the last to be raised
I against an institution which had so sig
nally benefited the State.
Court adjourned until next Monday,
when the counsel for the Railroad Com
missioners will open.
WHITE SUES ONCE MORE
He Wants the Lot Mrs. Galla
gher Left to the Arch
bishop.
The Deed Was Executed Too Near
Her Death, He Says, and Was
Never Delivered.
P. J. White, administrator of tne estate
of Ellen Gallagher, has added another suit
to the litigation over the disposition of
Mrs. Gallagher's property.
The suit is against Archbishop Riordan,
and it is to set aside a deed conveying to
the Archbishop a lot on fourth street
valued at $25,000. The deed was executed
April 5, 1895, and three days later Mrs.
Gallagher died. She had not given the
deed to the Archbishop, but had placed it
in the care of Father Nugent, the defend
ant in the recent suit. It was not deliv
ered by Father Nugent until after Mrs.
Gallagher's death.
The plaintiff claims that the deed -was
testamentary in character, and so was
void because executed within thirty days
of Mrs. Gallagher's death. It is also
claimed that the deed i a void because it
was not delivered to tne Archbishop until
after the maker's death.
The property is situated near St. Rose's
Church.

DEALER IN SLAVE GIRLS.
Wong Sam Is Exposed as an
Importer of Chinese
Women.
SAD STORY OF DONG SUN YET.
She Was Sold as a Slave in China and
Brought to California to Follow
a Life of Shame.
Dong Sun Yet is a pretty Chinese girl, 20
years of age, and now a central ligure in
THE DEALER AND HIS CHATTEL BEFORE THE COURT.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist, i
i the Custom-house scandal. She was im
ported from her native land for the pur- |
â¢ pose of engaging in an immoral calling in j
I San Francisco. She was brought over last
I November by a Chinaman engaged in the j
business of importing Chinese slave girls
and sold to Wong Bam and a woman
j named Ah Ling.
Dong bun Yet was on the witness-stand |
in the examination of Wong Sam before j
United States Commissioner Heacock yes
terday. She figured in the Custom-house
and Treasury Agent scandals, inasmuch as i
she exposed the character of Wong Sam, j
who is the one man on whose evidence \
i Major Moore expected to get a conviction
\ is the case against "Dick" Williams, the j
â  inspector now under a cloud. According i
' to her story Sam is c lit person for San
[ Quentin. llis businass is said to be that of
: a dealer in Chinese slave girls.
The witness stated that Ah Ling and i
i Wong Sam met her at the steamer on her
! arrival here. After being sold by the Chi
naman who brousrht her to this port for
the purpose of leading an immoral life
[ Wong Sam told her that he and Ah Ling
had bought her. Though a native of Chi A
she was told to say that she was born in
California, that, sbe went to China with
her mother when only 3 years of age, and
that her father was & merchant in China
town.
Dong Sun Yet admitted that her life in
Canton had not been the fairest. She had
been a slave for live years and was sold as
such lor $350. Mexican coin. This was
when she was about to embark for Califor
nia. She was told on leaving that after
serving as a clave for four years and a half
in San Francisco she would have earned
her freedom. Fortunately the missiona
ries had heard her story and took her un
der their sheltering wing.
Another Chinese woman testified that
Wong Sam had asked her to negotiate for
the sale of Dong Sun Yet. On being ques
tioned as to how she knew it was the same
woman that she was asked to sell she pro
duced a picture of Dong Sun Yet taken in
China.
Special Agent Moore was not present at
the examination of Wong Sam yesterday.
He has been vanquished all along the line
by Collector Wise, and is now regarded as
a person of a retiring disposition. Collec
tor Wise, on the other hand, took an ac
tive part in the prosecution, which was
conducted by Assistant District Attorney
Slessinger and Lyman I. Mowry.
The case will* be continued at 10:30
o'clock to-day.
"Texas Steer" at the Columbia.
The sale of seats for Hoyt's "Texas Steer" at
the Columbia Theater next week began Thurs
day with a rush, and the management confi
dently predict big business for the entire en
gagement. Everybody knows the fame of
"Texas Steer," and from the sale of seats so far
it seems as though everybody intended to see
it again for the second and perhaps third times.
It is computed that there are in
London some 50,000 families in such a
miserable plight that each family has only
one room to live in.
A GRAND JURY SESSION
An Indictment for Obtaining
Property by False Pre
tenses.
Supervisors May Amend the Open
Poker Ordinance as the Jury
Requested.
The Grand Jury yesterday afternoon
indicted James H. Cummings for obtain
ing money and property by false pretenses.
The indictment was found on the testi
mony of L. W. Schelle, W. H. Schooler
and A. Bainbridge and in due form re
ported to Judge Slack.
According to the testimony and thÂ«
documents in the case Cummings in Sep
tember, 1894, obtained from G. Scheele on
an assignment of a promissory note and a
mortgage real property to the value of $7500.
Cummings represented that a promissory
note of one W. T. McCarty was secured by
mortgage on land in Sonoma County
valued at $5000 and land in Butte County
worth $2500. It was further represented,
according to the testimony, that H. M.
.Barstow, an attorney of JSapa, had ex
amined the title to the Sonoma County
land and found it perfect.
The complainant went before the Grand
Jury ana stated that the Sonoma County
land was not as highly cultivated as repre
sented; that it was not near Petaluma, as
Cummings stated, and that the title had
not been examined by Barstow.
It was further snown to the jury that
the Butte County land was not adjacent to
Bidwell's orchard, as represented and that
the soil was not a rich loam.
The Grand Jury was satisfied that Cum
mings made false representations to
Schelle and upon the false pretenses did
obtain valuable property.
The case was once in Judge Joachimsen's
Police Court, but waa dismissed on the
ground that the land was there for Schella
to examine before he parted with his
goods.
Last Monday the Grand Jury sent a com
munication to the Board of* Supervisors
asking that the ordinance against open
poker games be re-enacted to cure a defect
in the penalty clause. The Judiciary Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors has
recommended that the board correct the
ordinance according to the suggestions of
the District Attorney and the Grand Jury.
Early in the session of the present Grand
Jury a communication was received from
the Board of Education inviting thorough
investigation of School Department af
fairs. The subject was referred to the
committee of the jury which consists of
Frank P. McLennan, Alpheus Bull Jr.
and C. L. Haskell. It is expected that an
investigation will be made in accordance
with the request.
Says Mr. Searlea Does Not Care.
to the Editor of Tke CallâSib: In The Call
of to-aay you have given prominence to a
statement that Mr. Searles desires to have me
j elected president of the 4rt Association. You
also recommend an opposition ticket, but add
that the members would not care to oppose
1 Mr. Searles' wishes. There is no foundation
! for the above statements. Mr. Searles does not
j know that there is to be an election, and has
! never given a thought to the presidency. He
j would be not only surprised, but indignant, to
know that such a rumor was afloat Ido not
want to be president, and Mr. Searles does not
I care who is president. Such unauthorized and
! lalse publications do not tend to encourage his
| generosity to this institution. I hope that you
| will give to this communication equal promi-
I nence with the article above referred to, in
j order that the members may have that free
dom of choice you intimate they do not care
to assert. Respectfully, H. G. Platt.

>'EW YORK MARKETS,
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 13.â Speculation
at the Stock Exchange was quiet to-day. Total
sales were only 173,750 shares. General Electric
was the feature of : the trading at the opening, sell
ing at 383,4(&,39%. The final sales yesterday were
373/ 8 . The. jump in the stock was the result of the \
oflicial announcement of the settlement of differ-:
ences between the company and the Westing- :
bouse, which includes an interchange of patents to
a certain extent, a division of territories, etc. After
the â¢ Â»ny rise the stock receded to 37 1 /2<!J37 s /i.
Pacific Mall was also a strong feature in the ear.y
trading, and advanced to 27*4-
It was reported that the steamer Rio Janeiro had
arrived at Honolulu and this strengthened the
stock. Later on there was a reaction to 26, bat a re
covery to 27 followed. The railway list did not re
spond to the advance in General Electric and Pa
cific Mail and ruled weak. London was a moderate
seller. Cable advices had it that the foreigners j
were disposed to sell because of the Senate debate ;
on the Cuban question. The currency plank I
adopted by the Ohio Republicans it was also said '
was unsatisfactory to certain European holders
of American securities. It should be said, how
ever, that the offerings by foreign houses on the i
whole were insignificant.
In the. afternoon dealings Tobacco was the spe
cial card and advanced 3 per cent to 82. The ad- :
vance was ascribed to manipulation and covering
of short contracts. Northern Pacific affairs re
celvt d more attention, ant it was given out that a
syndicate headed by .1. 1". Morgan liad been I
formed to reorganize the company. The reorgani- j
sation plan will be given out on Monday. Specula- I

CHICAGO MARKETS. \
CHICAGO, In-, March 13.â Yesterday after
noon's curb on wheat was weak, with selling of
"long" wheat in small lots taking place. The
opening this morning was with all the depression
remaining, and numerous stop orders were exe
cuted at the decline. During the morning there
was ' a moderate ' rally, but it was as a result of
covering by "shorts" and not of buying for an ad- (
vance. It is agreed to by all classes with few ex- .
ccDtions that it will only be through the means of
actual damage to winter wheat that values will j â¢
appreciate. Liverpool cables v&re weak and y$A I
lower. The weather, though cold, was not pre.ni- ! '
dicial to the crop. Receipts at Chicago were 26 :
cars, and the Northwest had 290. Local.withdraw- :
als from store were 122,716 bushels. About noon ! 1
the liquidation by "longs" became energetic and j
prices slumped to 62% c for May, a full cent and a â  :
halfdecllne from the outside for the day. Export j
clearances were fair at 312.648 bushels. Closing
Continental cables were generally lower. The
close was weak at tht inside quotations of the day.
May wheat opened from 62V2@63S y ic, sold be
tween 64(5;64V8C and 621 ,c, closing at 62 Vjc bid.
15/ 8 c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 40 cars.
CORNâ Was dull. The wheat market was the
principal explanation for the weakness, although
there was nothing reassuring in the situation of
corn itself. Receipts were 283 cars, and 76,800 ,

. DUX'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
. NEW YORK, K. V., March 13.â R. G. Dun &
Co. will say to-morrow in their weekly review of
trade: Failures for the week have been 300 in
the United' States against 266 last year, and 60 in
Canada against 57 last year. .
Waiting Is still the rule. Large hopes, but little
actual business - explains the strength of some
markets and the weakness of others. ThoÂ«, far
there is a decided increase in the demand for boots
and shoes secured by considerable concessions in
price, but in other branches of trade concessions
are made in vain or are not made. Meanwhile, it
is encouraging to know that one of the most im
portant business Interests has realized definite
improvement.
The insurance companies, of which returns are
given- in detail this week, show a larger business
and larger income than ever before, and also a
I remarkable soundness of mortgage loans and other
Investments. Â» * â 
As prices about February 21 were on the whole
I the lowest ever known, in this country consider
i able space is given this week to comparison of
[ quotations in the most important branches of
! manufacture which show the extent of the reaction
since the rise last fall. It is especially noteworthy
' that prices of materials have varied quite differ
ently from prices of manufactured products.
Thus cotton is 27.6 per cent higher than a year
: ago, but cotton goods average only 10.7 percent,
: Wool s but 5.3 per cent higher than a year ago,
; but woolen goods are on the whole but 4 percent ;
lower. Pig iron Is only 17 per cent hieher than a I
year ago, while finished products of iron and steel
; average 45 percent higher. Boots and hoes are
! practically no higher than a year ago, while leather
has risen 11.5 per cent, and hides at" (he moment I
] are only 2.2 per cent higher. '1 hese comparisuns
are important because they disclose something of
I the grave dislocation of prices which inadequate
1 consumption arid combinations have produced. ;
The output of pigiron March I was 189,583 tons
weekly, against 198,599 February 1. but the un
sold stocks have risen 69,764 tons during the past
month, or 17,441 weekly, and the unsold stocks of.
the great steel companies are not included. There
is reason to believe that actual consumption is
I still at least 10 per cent smaller than the produc
! tion of pig, and the price of Bessemer at Pittsburg
j has iigain declined slightly to $12 25, with excep
-1 tionally large sales below that figure. Prices of
I finished products are not quotably lower, although
j all markets are weak In tone. Of the minor nie
alscopper is in moderate demand at 11.12 c, and
there is more movement in tin at 13.4 c, while lead
is slightly weaker at 3.15 c. Tin : plates are weak,
> in part because of light demand.
Cotton goods sell but slowly, notwithstanding
I recent reductions in price, and the enormous ac
| cumulation of unsold stocks causes apprehensions
; in many quarters. In woolens the demand is very
! largely for low-grade goods, and fierce competition
affects the prices of the better grades materially.
j In clÂ£y worsteds the manulacture has been so fur
j overdone that stoppage of some most important
works Is considered not impossible. Sales of wool
at the three chief markets are the smallest in live
i years. Prices are still maintained, with decrease
I in Australian supplies.
The market for wheat Is weaker, with no belter
; reason than the Government report of wheat In
! farmers' hands, which is altogether out of keeping
I with the Government estimate of ayeprago. and
I yet is probably more nearly correct. : Western re
j ceipts still exceed last year's, and for two weeks
! have been 4,567,392, against 3,636,715 last year.
I while the Atlantic, exports, flour included, this
i week, a little smaller than a ; year ago, have been
I for two weeks 2,921,097, against 3,510,152 last
' year, : .
Corn Is a shade firmer, without apparent reason,
; andcottuD gaimd a sixteenth, although the pros
pect of the yield this year is at least as good as it
has been at any time. ,"
'1 he stock market has not been much changed.

COALâ Harrison 's circular says: : "During the
week there have been; twelve arrivals: from the
northern collieries 24,997 tons of Coal, from Aus
tralia 8394 tons, from New York '200 tons. Job- â 
bers and retailers are complaining or the stagnancy I
of trade, as since our snowstorm orders axe coming
in very slowly, hence . there Is quite an accumula
tion of British Columbia' Coal in yard, which must
lead eventually to diminishing, their Imports, as
they are now taxing their yard room. The demand
for steam uses holds up. and cargoes on arrival are
delivered to consumers â â  direct from ship's I side.
Each week we hear of some I new source of supply
whence cheap fuel will find its way to our market:
these promises do not materialize,: as the cost of
production added to the transportation is Invari- |
ably in excess of pencil calculation. Freights from
Australia are being marked I up, now making the j
cost of Colonial imports fully 10% higher; than I
prices named In January, and unless outward grain
freights improve still higher quotations will rule.
Besides, the f. o.b. colliery prices have been cut so
fine In Australia that it is generally believed a
higher cost may ; be named in the 'near future.
Freight rates from â  Great Britain are > steady."

BARNE`S REPORT
IS UNEARTHED
Lyons Post to Fire Some
Hot Shot at the Direc
tors To-Day.
WAS LONG SUPPRESSED.
The Methods of Conducting the
Canteen Characterized as
Disgraceful.
HUNDRED PER CENT PROFIT.
Not One of the Directors Was Doing
His Duty or Obeyicg the
By-Laws.
K Oakland Office Sax Frakcisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 13. )
The report of the committee appointed
two years ago by the Veterans' Home As
sociation and which was suppressed by the
d. rectors has been secured by some of the
old soldiers interested in the present
charges made by Lyons Post and it will
iorm a large portion of the evidence that
will be introduced at the coming investiga
tion. Referring to this report, which
is known as the Barnes report, General
Barnes said: "It has been trampled out
uf _.it and instead of adopting it the
directors applied to themselves more white
wash than a colored man uses on his back
tiled. I was 'eleemosynary counsel' of
that investigating committee and knowing
the feelings of the directors I robbed it
of everything that might hurt the feelings
of the directors."
The following sections of the celebrated
report, every copy of which vanished as
toon as it was rejected, are those which are
said to sustain the charges of Lyons Post:
It may as well be noted here that the by-laws
of the association call for four Quarterly meet- !
ings of the board of directors. They prescribed
that prior to such meetings the committee
known as the auditing committee should
examine the rep rt and books of the treasurer
and fully verify the correctness of his a counts.
The treasurer was himself a- required by tne
by-laws to present at such meetings a full, de
tailed and itemized report of the finances of
the association in his charge and of his re
ceipt? and expenditures.
Comrade C. E. K.Royce became treasurer of
the association on the 2Sth day of January,
1592. examination shows that almost imme
diately after Comrade Royee became treasurer |
he commenced misappropriating the funds of
the association, his first embezzlement amount
ing to $290 94, and occurring March 2, 1892.
At the .time when the first quarterly meeting
should have been held hi? misappropriations
. amounted to the sum oi* 34 lS *6. a considerable
Bum, it ii true, but small in comparison with
the amount misappropriated at the time of his
resignation as treasurer, and which now ap
jears to be the sum of $18,973 09.
It' the required quarterly meetings had been
held, and the treasurer had been compelled at
such meetings to present hi! books and ac
counts for examination, and if the auditing
committee had, as required by the by-laws,
jersonallr examined his accounts and re
ported" â Jhereon, the enormous loss which the
tsjociat^in has sustained through Treasurer
Koyce would have been rendered impossible,
aud his peculations., if be had indulged in any,
wouid have been limited to the first three
months of his administration as treasuer. The
probability is that Treasurer Royce knew from
past experience in the board that the directors
of the association did not hold the meetings
required by the by-laws and had not habitu
ally or otherwise "required the treasurer to
keep any books or j-resent any regular de
tailed of itemized statement of his transac
tions. The loose method! which had preceded
: .- term of office were in themselves an en
couragement and instigation to embezzimeut,
of which he promptly availed himself.
During the whole course of the investiga
tion, tnough the committee has sought to ob
tain the statements and views of the board of
directors concerning the condition of the af
â  lairs of the Home, it nas not been aided to any
great extent in the solution of any question,
and is compelled to report that in whatever
direction it has turned its investigations It has
foand numerous evidences of neglect upon the
part of the board of directors and of its com
mittees, which certainly justifies severe criti
rclsm, if not the institution of lesral proceed
ings to recover of them the moneys which, if
thÂ«y had attended to their duties, would never
have been stolen.
Your committee took samples of such staples
bp coffee, tea, rite, sugar and other articles as
were then on hand, and procured the same to
be carefully examined and tested by the Pur
chasing .Department of the United States Gov
ernment, dealing in similar goods for the use
of the army of the United states. So far as
these samples were concerned, none of them
were of the quality or character represented by
the sellers or the members of the committee
on i-upphes. They were of inferior quality and
told ai considerably above average market
prices even of goods of the pooi quality deliv
ered. These- fact." and the investigations of
the committee lead it to the conclusion that
the present method of purchasing supplies for
the Veterans' Home, tbrongh the agency of a
committee ou supplies, ought to be stopped.
There is no reason, as far as the committee
can learn, why bids for supplies should no; be
solicited and advertised for in the way usually
adopted, by other public institutions, nor why
contracts should not be made with responsible
lowest bidders, protected by proper bonds and
â¢with all the usual and ordinary guarantees for
the fulfillment of such contracts. If contracts
were made for supplies, and samples furnished
wherever possible, and copies of duplicates of
contracts deposited with the commandant at
Yountville, it would be possible for the busi
ness to be inuch'more economically and satis
factorily conducted than at present. It is
enough to say upon this subject that the pres
ent system has Riven rise, whether justly or
unjustly, to suspicions of unfair dealing and
iilegitimai2 profits, which will continue to re
dound to the injury of the institution as long
as it continue* to be sanctioned by the board
of directors.
Your committee has given considerable at
tention to the canteen established at the home
in July 1892, and which has since been and
now a in operation there. Quite a divergence
of opinion has been found to exist as to
whether or not there should be any canteen at
â â < the Veterans' Home, bat there seems to be no
difference of opinion that tne method in which
the canteen has been operated is subject to just
criticism and ought to be changed at once.
Your committee has examined with some
care the annual and other reports of soldiers
homes both State and National, and while the
canteen sysiem appear- to have been adoi ted
in -ome of them nothing like the canteen at
the Veterans' Home at Yoiintville Is found to
exist anywhere. In homes where the can
teen Is tolerated no spirituous or intoxicating
liquors are permitted to oe sold. Ko beverage
wronger than beer is permitted to be used, and
even the per diem quantity of that to the con
sumer is limited.
At Yountville. in addition to steam beer, va
rious alcoholic preparations and bitters and
an abominable concoction known as "whisky
bitters" are freely supplied and drunk by the
barrel. 'i'hiÃ la*i compound in said to consist
of hich-erade spirits, doctored with essences
aud bvniPS the effect of which upon thÂ« per
sons using it cannot but be most injurious. -No
restraint appears to have been piaci d upon
the i'oiiÂ«ijwpilon of these intoxicating and in
jurious liquids, the only limit to tneir use
ueing the pecuniary capacity of the veteran to
Koree of the members of the board who have
appeared Defore the committee cud officers at
ttio home have estimated the profit* of the
canteen us hijth as 100 percent. This exorbi
tant profit appears to have been Justified and
allowed .upon the theory that it would be de
voted to the benefit, in some form,- of the
Home. Xo such result has been reached so Jar
in the- history of tne cauteeu. duo partially, 1.0
tloubt, to the met that the moneys derived
from the can-.- fund have nearly .â ..: <>.â¢â¢â â :
embezzled by Treasurer Rofee and cons.ltute
a considerable portion of bis stealings.
While the committee is not wholly agreed as
to the advisability of maintaining the canteen,
it Is unanimously of opinion that the methods
hitherto adopted in its.operation ought, to bo
changed, and particularly that the sale of ftlO
holic beverages should be stopped and some !
limitation lie put upon ihe right of individual I
member! of the home to avail themselves of its
privilege*. It is a shame and a disgrace to I
everybody connected with its operation that j
so large a part of the pension money received !
by veterans and the money earned by their !
labor a i the honie should be expended in get
ting drunk, on poisonous liquors sold ai a profit :
of 100 percent at the canteen, and the commit- !
ommends that the board of directors, j
without more ado. take the matter of the can
teen in hand and see that, if it Is maintained,
it shall be administered as in other homes for
old *oldiers, Mute aud National.
The committee, moreovor, believes that the j
canteen ought not to be run as a business \
t, that whatever is tarnished
to tha inmates of the home in the way oi
erases, I etc., should be of the best j
quality ?,:, | as nearly a; cost v may be.
In considering the question at pensions the j
committee baa been often reminded by the de
vocates of the can to en that the old soldier has i
a right to tret drunk if he desires. While this j
may be true insomemeapurÃKformsnoJasrifi- i
ration for Use practice of getting him drunk
or furnishing aim alcoholic drinks as long as
bi has a dollar of pension money with which
sh his inebriety; and if the veteran
is to keep his pension and' the canteen is to be
continued, it ought to be maintained under
suitable restrictions and with an entirechange i
In the present and pas; systems of supplying 1
alcoholic drinks in unlimited quantities to the
injury of the imbiber and the destruction of
the peace and decency of the home.
Your committee is informed and believes
that in most, if not all, of the State homes, the
hospital department is attended to by compe
tent, trained, educated nurses. ma:e and
female, who know what to do and how to do
for the sick, diseased and suffering men in j
their Charge. Such nurses should be provided
without delay. Moreover, the committee ob
served that in tne laundry department the ;
clothing, bedclothes and other articles u.>ed by \
the healthy and well fire mil gied with and j
washed in the same water and at the same ,
time with those of the diseased and sick and
those whose misfortunes necessarily render
filthy all they toaeh. This ought not to be;
and "in some way provision should be made
for keeping the hospital clothing, bedding,
towels and cloths from contact la the laundry |
with similar articles used by the well and I
- free from disease.
The committee has no desire to inflict pain
where pain is not necessary to the accom
plishment of an object, and it therefore re- !
trains from the expression of its dissatisfac- |
tion at the manner In which business at-the j
office in .San Francisco has been manaeed, but ,
a -â¢â¢> rotary must be made of sterner stug than ,
Comrade Rockwell if he failtd to catch some
thing of the spirit of negloet, inattention to
and ienorance of the regulations of their
mod responsible stations, which character
ized many of his superiors in- uftice.
When during the course of Mr. Rockwell's
examina;ion he was inquired of concerning i
plain and unmistakable failures on the part
of the board of directors to comply with the
by-laws of the home in respect of its meetings !
and accounts and general business, he could
onl}- reply that such matters were not in his -
department and were none of his business, j
When some oT the directors, who ought to
have known better, wen inquired of concern
ing the requirements of the by-laws they had I
..r.ly to answer that they had never read the j
br-Lawl and did not know that such acts were
expected of them as the by-laws demanded.
The committee regrets that it is unable to
select any members of the board of directors;
who have fully dischareed the duties of the
office to which they were elected. While raeet
â¢ the board" have been held, those re
quired by the by-laws nave not been convened,
and the business of the home has oeen prac- ,
tically in the hands of a few. The board as a
board" has undertaken neither to control the
administration and discipline of the home nor â 
the purchase of supplies, nor the expenditures !
of money, nor the auditing of accounts, nor
any other matters essential to the proper con- !
duet of the affairs and discipline of the home: ;
arid the committee feels compelled to s-ay that ;
much of the real responsibility and blame for
the acts and omissions of duty of officers of the :
home most rest upon the board_ of directors.
For this neglect of duty and of the require- .
ments of the by-laws no explanation or even
apology has been offered beyond that of ignor
ance, and the committee is of the opinion that
public confidence in the a<im:ni.'-trauon of the i
affairs of the Veterans' Home, which has cer- j
tainly been lost, can only be restored by the
resignation of tnose of tne present board who j
were members of it prior to the recent election
and by the appointment or election of others
in their places.
The argument will be made that every
thing reported two years a^ro will oe
equally applicable at tnia time. The in- j
gating committee consisted of: B. J.
Loop (chairman), C. A. Fuller, Magnus
Tait, E. C. Thatcher, Jerome Dea?y (sec- ;

OAKLAND POLITICS.
; Forthcoming Meeting of the Third Con
gressional District Committee.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 13.â Ala
xneda County members of the Third Con
gressional District Committee Till meet
next Wednesday evening at the City Hall
in Alarueda to finally arrange for the
selection of delegates for this county to tne
State Convention. There is so far no ap
parent break in the deadlock, and each
faction is working bard to gain a vote from
its opponent, one vote in either case
meaning a decision.
It la well known that Senator Earl,
George Morrow and E. K. . Taylor are
inclined to send ex-Mayor George C. Par
dee to St. Louis to name the next Presi
dent, while Morrison, Long and Inkier are
considered friendly to Senator Denison.
As Denison has said that he is confident
of success in the county delegation and
that he does not care whether the dele
gates are appointed by the committee or
elected at a primary, the position of Ingler,
Morrison and Long in forcibly objecting to
primaries is not easily understood.
County Clerk Frank Jordan, who is en
ergetically working for primaries in the
interest of his stancti friend and supporter,
Dr. Pardee, saicl to-night that the feeling
in favor of primaries is beinp manifested
more every day.
"Ail the dust-throwing and all beating
around the bush will not serve any pur
pose," said Jordan. "The Republicans of
this county do not want any body of men
to do their politics for them." They .will not
stand it. It Denison's friends have cause
to feel so confident as they say they are,
why should they oppose primaries? If
the* committee is* not working for an ulte
rior purpose it will order primaries."
The action taken next Wednesday night
by. the Alameda men will depend in some
measure upon the decision of . the Third
District committee which meets in San
Francisco Saturday. .

SVENGALI COMES
Then the Sleeping Jap Will
Be Roused From His
Trance.
FRAUD OR HYSTERIA?
Violent Experiments Tried on the
Man Who Only Wakes
to Eat.
HAS SLEPT FOR TWO WEEKS.
One Doctor Thinks He Is Shamming,
but Anothei Says It Is a Genuine
Case of Hysteria.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 13. J
The Japanese doctors are at swords'
points regarding Tushako Hirano, who
has Deen sleeping at the Receiving Hospi
tal, with the exception of meal times, for
over a week. Dr. Kurozawa says Hirano
is actually a marvel, while Dr. Kodawa
thinks he may be a fraud.
Steward Victory of the hospital is a stu
dent of psychology, and he believes that
the little Japanese is under some myste
rious influence and that not until he is re
leased by the same person that now con
trols him will he awake from his slum
ber. The steward says there is no differ
ence between the sleep of Hirano and that
of any other hypnotic subject.
When the sleeper's Svengali appears
then he will awaken.
Tushako was picked up by an officer at
Twelfth and Franslin streets and taken to
the City Prison, where he was charged
with violating the "sleeping-out" ordi
nance. For several days he lay in a. stupor
at the prison and no food rjassed hia lips.
He was then taken to tr-e Receiving Hos
pital and after a little time he took nour
ishment. For several days he has been
roused and fed three times a day, but as
soon as his ravenous hunger is satisfied he
at once resumes his sleep. When it was
thought that the man was shamming vari
ous devices were resorted to for the pur
pose of testing his sleeping qualities.
Dr. R. Kodawa of San Francisco, who
came over to see the sleeper, is not certain
that the sleep is genuine.
"It may appear strange," he said, "but
It may be that Hirano is feigning. I have
seen him before, and I had experience with
him on two occasions. In each case he
was in a sleep like this, and in each case I
woke him up. He was once in a Japanese
mission in San Francisco. He fell asleep
there and I went to look at him. I spoKe
to him, handled him and poured cold
water down his back and he came to him
self.
"On another occasion, when I was at the
medical college, he claimed that he suffered
a great deal from a tooth, and I wanted
him to have it extracted. He said that he
worshiped God and that God would re
move the pain if he went to sleep. He
slept, but he woke up soon after I called.
He had the aching tooth, too, and I guess
he has that tooth yet. Ido not know why
he. should deceive, but he may think that
if he appears sick he may bring people
who will give him money and other arti
t cles. I think that if be should be left
alone in a room with nobody in a position
where Hirano might be watched he would
soon open his eyes."
This morning Dr. Kurozawa conducted
a severe ordeal on Hirano. He was ac
companied by the supjrintendent of the
' Japanese Mission at San Francisco.
! Hirano's fingers were bent backward until
I they were almost at right angles with his
j hand. His toes and limbs were likewise
'â  treated and placed in unnatural position?.
1 The eyes 01 the sleeper, however, never
opened, although he writhed in pain. He
did not eive expression to any articulate
utterance, but he groaned in agony, some
times sitting up in bed and at others
squirming away, from the experimental
ists. The doctor and the superintendent
left the hospital declaring that the case
was the most pronounced one in hysteria
that they had ever known.
The patient was taken to the County
Hospital this afternoon. ;
SAYS SHE STRUCK HIM.
Murderer Hill's Excuse for Taking His
Wife's liife.
OAKLAND, Cm.., March 13.â The attor
ney for Benjamin Hill, on trial for the mur
der of his wife, made his opening state
ment for the defense to-day. Attorney
Bradley reviewed Hill's married life. With
respect to the events that immediately
preceded the shooting he said that after
leaving the house Mrs. Hill had; told her
husband that she would not live with him ;
that she had been unfaithful to him and
that she wanted to be taken care of by the
man who was the father of her unborn
child. She also told Bradley that she did
not love her husband; that Â»he had never
loved him and that sheÂ«married him solely
for the money ho had supplied. â 
Hill begged her to forego her resolution
to ; abandon him, and when he did so, she
became angry and .-truck him in the face.
These acts, Attorney Bradley said,- might
not in themselves justify killing 'in a sane
man, but were sufficient to render a man
who loved his wife as Hill did to become
insane, and on that ground he would -ask
the jury to acquit the prisoner.
When reference was made to the aban
donment of the prisoner by his wife, Hill
laid his head on the table and wept. Sev
eral witnesses from Snisun testified to the
good character of Hill before he left Suisun,s
and the case was continued to Tuesday
morning.
Mayday Fete.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 13.â A meeting
of the Mayday Fete Association was held
last night and steps were taken to prepare
for the Moral display at the Oakland Trot
ting Park.
Tiie management of the park will have
expended fully $100,000 in erecting a new
trianu stand and other buildings, renewing
the track and remodelingttoe grounds gen
erally by thar time, and it is hoped it will
be possible to have the grand opening of
the park on the same day. A. committee
will wait on President Williams of the Cal
ifornia Jockey Club to-day and make the
necessary arrangements tor that purpose.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 13.â Adelia

ious to become somebody's wife rather

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND.
Mrs. J. A. Sample Owes Her Strength to This the Best
of All Remedies.
For the unfortunates who lie awake,
staring at the ceiling and counting the
strokes of the clock, every sleepless night
is an eternity.
Mrs. J. A. Sample of 1558 Broadway,
New York City, was afflicted with insom-
nia until her nerves were on the verge of
prostration. She thinks her condition
was due to indigestion. Here is what Mrs.
Sample says:
'â I have used Paine's celery compound
with marked and decided benefit. It is
especially useful in insomnia, arising from
indigestion and poorly nourished nerves.
"I should add that my granddaughter,
Vera HaHeigh, was so thin and puny at the
age of 10 as to cause us the greatest
anxiety We had no difficulty in inducing
her to take Paine's celery compound. To-
day the roses bloom in her cheeks, and I
never saw a healthier, stronger child than
Paine's celery compound has made her."
The brain is the center of the nervous
system. Sleep alone rests this vital organ,

Last' night a bundle of resolutions of street
work were ordered each one loot less than
a complete block. This will prevent pro

together with the nerves. During the i
waking hours the nervous svsteni work 3
incessantly. Poor sleep means a poor !
nervous condition, and prolonged insom-
nia leads in every case to prostration, and
too often to dread insanity. The mischief
that results from weakened nerves is much
greater and more destructive than most
folks even dream of.
The all-important thing for nervous,
run-down persons, and for those who are
losing sleep is that Paine's celery com-
pound builds up the whole physical sys-
tem, and by improving the digestion and
regulating the nerves it insures sound, re-

In winter most women and many men
lead hothouse lives. A flagging appetite,
a disposition to pick at this dish and that,
rather than to eat a square meal, is among
the early indications of failing health.
Then comes delay in falling asleep, and
the fretful, uneasy feeling the next day.

liilÂ»t-<'!:i-s Baseball.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 13.â The final
game for the baseball chain nionship of the
university will take place to-morrow after
noon between the dental college and the
class of '99, which two have been Victors
j in the contests that have already taken
place.
A great deal of athletic enthusiasm has
been aroused in the dental college, and
Manager Henry Ahrahm of the dentists'
nine says that the Thole dental college
will turn out to cheer their representa
tives to victory. The advent of the
affiliated colleges in Berkeley athletics is
something almost new with this season,
I and much satisfaction is expressed at
prominence the affiliated men bare
won, for the co-operati n in athletics
of the several hundred State Uni
versity students who study in San
Francisco means that the number of
men from which Varsity teams or nines
can be selected will be much increased, and
consequently that better records may be
hoped for.
The deutal college nine to-morrow will
pound has caused men and women from
every section of the United States to write
sincere, hearty words of praise and thank-
fulness for this grand invigorator. People
enjoying perfect health sometimes wonder
at this gratitude; but whoever has suffered
from prostration of the nerves, of which
insomnia is ons of the symptoms, will
understand how hard it is to overstate the
torment of this condition. And whoever
has been made completely well by Paine's
celery compound feels that no words can
overstate the joy and gratitude such per-
sons feel.
This is the state of mind of thousands of
nervous, sickiy, broken-down persons who
have used Paine's celery compound and
been made well.
Mrs. Sample tells of the happy result in
the case of her grandchild. One of the
most conspicuous instances of the remark-
able power of Paine's celery compound
over debility is shown in the relief it has
afforded children. Of course, the dose is
adapted to the age of the little patient.
The compound purifies the blood and cor-
rects any tendency to constipation. PalÂ«.
puny children are made vigorous, rosy ana
healthy by this incomparable remedy.

The New Josh.
! To-day/under the auspices of DeWitt H.
Gray and James M. Oliver, will be pub
. lished Josh, in the interest of the uni
| versity men of the Pacific Coast.
In appearance the new Josh is bright,
clean-looking and "smart." In many re
i spects it recalls the attractive features of
; New York Life. In policy it is apparently
conservatively aggressive.' Its salutatory
i runs in this way:

one has said. Poor, moldy Public Opinion I
They have told you that with this issue Josh
becomes a lampoon of the most lampoony
type; that henceforth Josh will cut and slash
without fear of God, man or the faculty.
Nothing of the sort. As for cutting and slash

! first edition, "we have come to "'and shall

There is a manifest intention to make the
paper newsy, as far as compatible with the
; avoidance of crQuble, and with that idea
even the opinion of the dailies is not
. scorned by the management, which sub
mitted advance copies yesterday for a "no
tice" in these columns. . Similarly the
sweet girl graduate is catered to, although *
in a critically superior style that is strictly
non-committal. The editor will also en
i deavor to take the alumni into camp. He
says:
Among the new features of Josh which we
hope soon to introduce is a series of letters
from the alumni throughout the State. There
is not one among us that would not enjoy hear
ing of Brown in Portland, Smith in Los Ange
les and Jones in the Interior. Their college
training still influences their action?, and
sometimes they do things really humorous.
Josh will let you judge ere long.
The illustrations are distinctly good and
the advertising patronage shows a faith
that is encouraging.

from the Michigan manager ro-day. The
letter was in response to a communication
sent by Captain Menvin some time ago
asking if a meet between the two teams
could be arranged should the Californiana
again cross the continent.
'The stipulations which they made in
accepting our prouo.Â«ition are very satisfac
tory, on the whole," said Captain Merwin.
"They will guarantee us $200 cast* and
many courtesies to us. They will meet us
in all the events, both on track and field.

The following letter from Rev. D. M.
Ross is self-explanatory:
Eev. Peter r. Yorktâ Snt: T see by The Call
of Sunday and Monday. March 8 and 9, that
you are eoing to leave the City for awhileâ two
weeks, I think you cay. lam sorry you are go
ing, because you h?.ve not finished answering
tl"e quotations which I submitted to you at
yonr own request. You told me last week you
were jroins: to devote one whole letter to the
"marriape" question : and while the people were
honoring you with their attention and their
expectancy you ya ss ed the question over, and
announced that you had answered everything
and every person in sight. How comes it that
you say i'r. <>:ie Utter you are going to answer a
charge, and in tho next, without giving the
answer, declare that you answered everything
that hail hen said against yon t I? it by the
rules of loeie or of grammar, or of mental
reservation that you accomplish the feat of do
ing and not doing the same thing at the same
time?
I think that your bump of making promises
is so largely developed that it has crowded out
the bump of fulfilling them. Early in yonr
newspaper talk last December you promised to
write to a priest back Kast for confirmation ol
a fish story you told, but you have not yet ful
filled the promise you made of prod-uclng his
letter. At a debate in Healdsburg, where Mr.
Walarap knocked you out so completely that
yon swore off debating, you stated that the
priest in Swartsville was" dead, and that you
had the proof, but you did not fulfill your
promise to produce It; and, by the way. we
nave since learned that the said priest is alive,
and that yon forgot to tell the truth. But per
haps you were rattled at the time.
You were not rattled, however, when in the
quiet of the Monitor office you wrote in answer
to Mr. HubbellN inquiry after Father Becker,
late of St. Helena, that the sa:<i lather was
dead. We knew that here also you forgot to
keep to the truth.
We sent a quiet letter to his new Bishop,
Rev. John Vertin, a man who tries to keep to
the truth, except when the interest of the
church requires otherwise, an 3 received a
ci> mt, concise answer.
In order ttiat there should be no mistake we
inquired for the Father Becker, late of St.
Helena, Cal. Let me append yonr words and
the Bishop's side by side, in the' "deadly paral
lel." so that you may see yourself as others see
you:

Call, December 28, 1895. John Vertis,

Are you not ashamed of your falsehood and
of your language? You call a man at once a
cur and a leper for exposing your pruriency.
What is the sense of callinsr any one a d< p ?
While on the question of promises and con
sistent conduct let me draw your attention to
your original position and subsequent course
of action. If you remember, you came at me
in your first letters like a scalping Indian.
Yonr onset nearly scared the wits out of me.
For some day^ I could see war paint and feath
ers and scalping knives wherever 1 raised my
eyes. At nieht I dreamt of all the Indian sto
ries I had ever heard or read. Your war-.vhoop,
as you danced around me, was "put up or shut
up." I said: "Let the public in to see the
Fcalping." You answered in Vanderbilt's la
conic words: "The public be anathema." But
finally, when C. A. Hubbell took your bet op
(ondition thai proofs be submitted in open
court, you said: "Thatsuits me admirably."
We thought you. meant what you said, hut
â¢what was our surprise when Foote let your cat
cut by Baying that you engaged him with the
express understanding that all be in private.
You made Foote your scapegoat. Perhaps he
is happy.
Besides, you ought to be brave enough to
meet me anywhere, seeing you have the whole
deposit of truth and religion on your side,
and I have only lies and forgeries "on mine.
Again, let me "hold the mirror up to nature"
in the deadly tmrallel .

strives more for victory than for truth? Is he

you, sir, the lie which you uttered about
Becker, and which Bishop Vertin brings home
to you, will stay with you. It will be with you

In your interview of Stinday, March 8, in The
(all you shY: "These old slanders against my
<hurch have heen Fqnarely met and refuted.'"
That sentence is worth "looking at for a mo
mer.t. Who t-landered your church? What
were the slanders? When did yon ever meet
anything squarelyâ except a square meal?
What have you tefuted?
I know of r,o fewer than a dozen Roman
Catholic laymen in this City who have sn:d
that you told lalsehoods in your attempted re
plies to my lectures. I know of a number of
Roman Catholics who have looked upSchrader
and found out your willful falsehood about
the Syllabus. I have read your hysterical at
tempts to answer or refute or turn aside ray
proofs, as you tried to set yourself right with
the public. But let me ask you what can be
an answer to my proofs? Let ns see. lam
asked by you to find the following statement
or the substance of it, in any Roman Catholic
publication: "In case of conflict between eccle
siastical and civil powers the ecclesiastical
ought to prevail. " Please note that your own
words are ''the statement or the substance of
it."
I take this proposition first because I took
it first in the lectures, and since you give me
the choice between the- sutement or its sub
stance, I choose to find the substance of it
since it gives a wide and clear field.

That quotation from the Jesuit Schrader is
clearly the thing you demanded from me. It

language so perfectly r.s you say you do that
bince the civil. law does not prevail whenever
it may happen to be' in conflict with your
church the church law ought to end mustpre

Let me show in the deadly parallel what you
asked me to find in substance and see if I
have not found it in this quotation. Lit it be
understood that it is the Pope who says the
state laws do not prevail when in conflict with
his church law.

Follow that up with Brownson, Sehouprje,

On the 9th you say you must stop writing
for a while, but that if anything worth no
ticing: is said it will keep. No doubtâ truth
always keeps. So will the A. P. A., and you
will know on election day. Do you remember
the last thing you said as you jumped on the
train to get away from your wreck and failure?
It was an answer to Major Ryan, consisting of
"You dirty dog." That is choice language for
a priest, isn't it ? And of course it was a con
clusive answer to all the mfljor's quotations
from Dens moral Theology! I see you are
going to gather your stuff up into a cheap
book. 1 hope you will. I'll guarantee you
that I shall buy a copy and I will put up the
money for it. I'll not do as you did with that
hundred dollars wnich you promised to "put
up." I will not run away to Los Angeles on
what I promised to give to charity. I'll give
what I promise for your book for future refer
ence. And if you do not put into your book
all the nastiness that appeared in your letters
to the press I shall carry a file of" the papers
and the "bit" 1 book with" me, so that I can say
in the language of the ballad singer:
Jus: look at that.
Just look at this;
And tell m â¢ if I'm not
A very pretty Miss!
Let me quote a few of my proofs and see
what your answers are. I shall use the
"deadly parallel."
Rnss' FIKST PROOF. TOBKE'S FIKST REPLY.

Is that quotation not plain enough in its
assertion that State laws are subject to repeal
when they come into conflict with the church?
: Is my quotation not the substance of your
j challenged proposition? But what a learned
answer you gavel
Againlei us draw the "deadly parallel."

1 cannot see the connection between the proof
anil your answer, but it must be there, for you
I say you understand the English language fairly
well and no one else does.
Lei me submit your own church laws, as
ound in "Klemeuts of Ecclesiastical Law"
PROOr. TOKKE.

Why cannot you say that these quotations
are not from Catholic publications? Never j
j mind telling us what they mean. Other peo- j
pie areas learned as you and can tell what
th â Beuieocea mean. Simply show that they
; are not in the text-books referred to or that
( the text-b'.>oks are not Catholic publications.
j Failing in that, put up your hundred dollars !

I in your cowardly "run away."
I purpose showing you lip in this matter,
I even to your heart's content.

i quest onably lawful to'
I transfer him.â Volume
I, "Elements of Ecclesi
astical Law," page 171.
Let me ask you why is that law in your
church? What is the occasion for it? What !
percentage of priests comes under it? If there j
were only a few priestsâ rare instancesâ for j
whom such a need existed, would that law be
made! Does it not require over half the priest- !
hood to feel the need of such a provision before i
I it would become an accepted statute? True, i
the laws of your church are not made by vote
I of the priests, but if the priesthood was "white' '
I such a law as that could not exist for a single ;
: day. Imagine what a bellowing you would in
j dulge in if such a law was found in or prac-
I ticed by any Protestant denomination! Do
I you remember any cases of immoral priests
] sent to parishes where their immorality was i
i not known ? I know of several at present.
Do you think such a man as comes under i
I that statute is God, even in the confessional. !
! I approach the inside of your church with
reverence, and will not slander any holy thing !
within it, but I say without hesitation that I
when a church or society or Club covers up the
"bad morals" of its members, there must be j
"something rotten in the State of Denmark." i
And you, sir, a member of that institution, |
j call other people "dogs," "asses," "bulls,"
"frauds," "humbugs," "lepers," "liars" and
what not! Fie on your coarseness! Clean out
your mental stable, and show yourself a master j
! of refined language and a companion of moral ;
| men only before you assert in your conceit i
that you refuted all slanders. Can an institu- !
tion that covers immorality be slandered?
j The greatest slander on your church this year
: is your vulgar, coarse and indecent defense of
; it. Yours truly, Donald M. Ross.
HEIRS TO LARGE WEALTH.
Mrs. I.aiiclilm of New York ClaiuiM an '
Interest in a California K-t.-it.-.
Mrs. Laughlin and daughter of New
York are in the City to inquire into the
estate of James E. Lauphlin, who came to
California with his brothers, Peter ana
Patrick, about fifty years asjo.
They acquired considerable wealth,
which finally passed into the possession of j
certain attorneys, who have been paying
interest in tne sum of $1500 annuaily to
two nephews of the deceased, James Langh
lin, but have refused to close up the estate
because of the absence of other heirs.
Mrs. Laughlin, who is here reeking in
formation on the subject, is now quite ill
at the International Hotel, where s*he and
her daughter have room?. She feels that
she will have no aimcultv in eventually
establishing her claim. All she knows fs
that the nephews have been receiving in
terest from the estate for a number of
years. She has no knowledge as to who
controls the estate.

TALBDT CLIFTON'S
POLO BREECHES
Sued for Their Price in the
Justice's Court Yes
terday.
WHITE AS DRIVEN SNOW
Collectors Utterly Failed to Find
His Lordship at
Home.
LILIIE WINTERS' LITTLE CLAIM
She Asks $65 for Services and Goods,
Wares and Merchandise
Furnished.
' A few wpeks ago a fender and a
pair of andirons entangled Lord Tal
bot Clifton, the English nobleman who
has $60,000 a year and spends more, in a
legal fight with a gas-fitter's linn which
insisted on being paid for the utensils,
and now it is a scarlet coat and pair of polo
trousersâ spotless white polo breechesâ
that have performed the same operation.
When his lordship became a member of
the Buriingame Club, from which fifty
members recently resigned because of the
un-American manners and sports that had
taken possession of the organization, his
wardrobe, despite its magnificent propor
tions, did not contain a pair of polo trou
pers that had not been worn at least twice,
and a scarlet coat â absolutely necessary
for the maintenance of his position as a
scion of the English nobility â was also
conspicuous by its absence.
The trousers and coat were indispensa
ble, and Lord Clifton sent his valet to the
most fashionable tailor the employe could
find to see that the deficiency was sup
plied.
Those trousers â or breeches as they are
described in the bill rendered, but not an
swered by his lordship â were a marvel of
the tailor's art.
No bicycle girl's bloomers were ever cut
with more care than were Clifton's
breeches. The snowiest of white cloth
was used in building them, the trimmings
were of the richest fabrics, and when the
tall and elegant form of Clifton dawned
on the gr.ze of the young scions of the
aristocracy assembled at Burlingame the
green-eyed monster took possession of
many hearts. When astride a dimin
utive polo pony Clifton's pedal appendages
nearly came into contact with the vulgar
earth, but the set of those breeches was
periect.
Nor was the coat in the shade in respect
to style. All agreed that the cut and fit
were a dream. But Lord Clifton failed to
pay for the clothes with the same grace
that he had worn them.
At first the firm, after waiting a respect
ful period, sent a bill and later a duplicate
of the same. No response being forth
coming a collector took a hand in the pro
ceedings, but was no more successful than
the paper intimations that the time for
settlement had come and gone.
Though he called frequently and not
always patiently at his lordship's luxuri
ous apartments in the Maison Riche he
never found any one at home but the
valet, who invariably explained that his
master was out. sometimes exhibiting a
stack of unopened letters, some of them
bearing on the envelopes the addresses of
well-known business firms, to prove his
assertion.
Tnen the firm became impatient and
turned the bill over to Raver with instruc
tions to sue it" necessary to get the amount
due. $77.
Thus it waa. that a suit entitled "J. J.
Raver vs. Talbot Clifton, a lord," was filed
in the Justice Court yesterday.
The tailor's claim is not the only one
that Raver is endeavoring to collertfrom
his lordship, for in the same complaint is
included ttiat of one Lillie Winters, which
demands $60 for "services rendered and
goods, wares and merchandise furnished."
INTELLIGENCE OF ANTS.
Their Socialistic Communities
and Almost Civilized
Methods.
They Have Nurses, Soldiers, Laborers,
Milkmenâ Dr. C. H. Steele's
Lecture.
Dr. C. H. Steele, professor of materia
medica in Cooper Medical College and resi
dent physician at the Lane Hospital, gave
a very lecture last night on the
Lilliputian institutions of ants and the
almost human socialistic principles of ant
dom.
There are four stages to the period of
growth of the young. The ege hatches in
from iifteen davrf to six weeks, when the
larva.' or grub state is reached. These
grubs are assorted and consigned to com
partments according to their size by the
ever watchful and patient nurse ants. In
another six weeks the grub assumes its in
sect shape, though it is still very tender
and white, ana in this condition it is a
most tempting morsel of food to cannibal
neighbors from another tribe. But in an
other six weeks the nurses lift it from its
KEW TO-DAY.

Ants have regular hours for labor and
recreation, their common work purpose
being the laying in of supplies for winter.
So systematically have they ' arranged
their co-operative system that there is no
wasting of energy.
In youth each ant is educated to per
form s-ome special function in the com
munity, and consequently there is no fric
tion, and in every household there is great
harmony.
The queen or mother ant's duty is
simply to lay the cg>rs. ami she is not par
ticularly respected, but when she dies the
family affection manifests itself in much
ceremony over the body, which is per
mitted to lie in state for many weeks be
fore it is ejected from the habitation.
The males are the least important. As
the lecturer remarked it shows how com
pletely deteriorated the male becomes
where the female has obtained complete
sway, and this he predicted might be the
case with the new woman.
The females are the workers and they
not only perform the labor but do the
lighting* when two ant armies meet in bat
tle, as is often the case when one settle
ment in nice battle formation moves upon
another settlement to capture the edible
young.
The ant abodes are wondrously con
structed and consist of subterranean pas
sageways connecting different rooms,
among" which are large assembly halls,
living apartments and storerooms, all
guarded at their approaches by a regular
system of sentries.
Ants build roads, construct open and
covered bridges and make tunnels some
times of great iength. They hunt singly,
but they fight and forage in armies. They
never assail a prostrate foe, nor do they
pursue one that is fleeing, unless he be
escaping with booty.
Some species capture their black neigh
bors and make them serve as slaves, the

result being that the captors finally be
come unable to care for themselves, so
much do they rely upon their serfs.
There are" carpenter ants, that build
homes of bits of wood; mason ants, that
make plaster by the aid of an acid they
exude; agricultural ants, that clear and
cultivate the ground and plant out grass
seed, and there are ants that milk the avis,
a sort of plant lice that secretes a sweet
fluid.
It is estimated that the ant can raise 3000
times its own weight.
The sick and injured are carefully tended
by the nurses, but if a diagnosis indicates
fatal injuries the case 19 abandoned.
HE STOLE THREE WATCHES.
An Ex-Convict Makes Free With the
Jewelry of an Actor.
Eugene Girard, alias Erniol Girardieu,
has been booked at the City Prison on a
charge of petty larceny. The charge, how
ever, having been preceded by prior con
victions on the same grounds magnifies it
to the degree of a felony.
On March 6 Girard entered the dressing
room oi Frank H. Crane at the Baldwin
Theater and stole a silver watch. On March
9 he entered the jewelry-store of Erick
Puthon, at 508 Bush street, and while the
proprietor was in the rear of the place stole
a silver and a sold watch.
Detectives Harper and Bee have recov
ered the three watches.
Girard served three months in the Coun
ty Jail, dating November, 1894, on a con
viction of petty larceny, ami on Augtist 8,
189">, be was again convicted and sen
tenced to six months' imprisonment for a
similar offense.

Inspection of Chinese Dead-
Houses by City
Physicians.

Interior Views of Some- of the Worst
of the Chinatown "Quiet
Nursing Places."
Some of tbe "Chambers of Tranquility"
and "Quiet Nursing Places" in Chinatown
Interior View of the Chinese Deadhouse in the Rear of the Wong Wan Company
on Stockton Street.
[Sketched on the spot by a "Call" artist.]
j described recently in The Call were visited
yesterday by City Physicians Dr. J. JL
McMurdo and Dr. A. P. O'brieu, who were
accompanied by the regular Chinatown
Health Inspector and a Call artist and
j reporter.
The visits were quite informal ami un
expected, and the condition of affairs dis
closed to the visitors was even more dis
tressing than the descriptions already
published.
However, much that is horrible and
ghastly to the sensibilities of the Cauca
sian in these "deadhouses," where the
dying and the dead are huddled together
in dark rooms within touch of each other,
is beyond the reach of legal process. There
is no law which prohibits the housing of a
dying man next to a corpseâ if the corpse
is removed and buried within the legal
Hve days. Another corpse may be substi
tuted for the one Intricd, often is, and thus
the dying man kept within constant sight
and touch of lifeless formsâ and there is
no law beyond the moral code to prevent
it if the dens are kept reasonably clean.
There is no law that can reach the case
of a family which hides tbe dead body of
its member until enough money has been
raised to pay the undertaker's expenses.
This is frequently done in Chinatown.
Sometimes the corpse is hidden in the
cellar or in trunks or boxes for a week or
more at a time â and no white man knows
it or can learn the secret until at last the
necessary burial money has been secured
and the Chinese undertaker is called in.
The dead body is then hauled away to one
of the "Chambers of Tranquility," de
posited on a table beside the dying, and
left there till the coffin has been made and
all the formalities for burial concluded.
There is a great deal of this sort of thing
in Chinatown, but it is only among the
poor people; and, of course, they don't
count. This is Chinese philosophy, at
Jeast; so vastly different from Caucasian
practice, wherein the poor are cared for in
health, nursed as tenderly when sick and
buried with as much honor when dead as
the rich. But the Mongolian is entirely
heartless toward the poor. The rich in
Chinatown are buried with great pomp
and ceremony, while the poor are left to
die amid all the horrois of the "Chambers
of Tranquility," and then are buried in
the City graveyard, in case their cousins
are too poor to pay for the shipment of the
bones to China.
Some of the things viewed by the visit
ing physicians yesterday are so atrocious
in their nature, so ghastly and so filthy in
their surroundings, however, as to come
plainly within the law. Dr. McMurdo will
report to Health Officer Dr. Lovelace rec
ommending that these places be con
demned as public nuisances.
Perhaps the worst of these was found in
a narrow alley running off- the north side
of Jackson street, between Stockton and
Powell. The alley is foul and damp, being
the dumping ground for the refuse of a
dozen families whose kitchen windows
conve niently open on it. The alley is
malodorous, and one must step carefully
or slip in the slime of the refuse. Near
the far end of it, on the eastern side, is a
rickety frame structure, from the door of
which when opened still fouler smells greet
the nostrils. It is dark and dump and
cold within. It is also bare and comfort
less, and squalid and unclean. Yesterday
the visitors found no dead bodies here, for
there has not been a death in Cbiuatown
reported within the past ten days.
But there were the tables upon which
the corpses are laid. Dr. McMurdo him
self vouched for it that many dead are
brought here. One patient was in the
dark and foul room. He was idiotic,
speechless from disease â his voice not as
strong as a low whiaperâ and his frame so
! feeble and tottering that he must cling to
! the wails for support when moving from
his coach (one of those tables on which the
iiÂ«';i<i are placed) to the fitucet for a drink.
I He was all alone, evidently a prisoner.
i Heavy cobwebs and s(r.hrtit a s of filth
| were pendent from the ceiling, and under
foot the broken boards were Slimy.
By and by. when the eyos of the visitors
became used to the darkness, a narrow
staircase was seen near the door. Mount-
I ing this and uoundine on the door and
calling out, "The doctor from the City
Hall," and repeating the calls and the
poundings many times, finally brought a
response. The door was opened and the
visitors passed through a long passage
way, which ended in the rooms of the
"Wong Wah Company, fronting on Stock
ton street. Here half a dozen Mongolians
were found, every one of whom disclaimed
all knowledge of the deadroom downstairs
and its living occupajit.
In an alleyway almost as foul with rot
ting vegetable matter and much other
refuse, which runs north from Pacific
street, between Stockton and Dupont, is
the Ah Lick Hospital, or "Quiet Nursing
Place."
It is certainly very quiet. Knocking on
the first door in the long brick building
brought a response from a very voluble
and somewhat rotund heathen, who was
overanxious to prove that all was well in
his deadhouses. He said they beloneed to
the Man Fook On Company, and reluc
tantly opened the three outside doors that
lead to as many dirty, dark and narrow
deadchanibers. Here the small chambers
are divided off into spaces like stalls in a
stable, and in each stall five boards rest on
sawhorses, making tables or couches; two
of these in each stallâ one for the corpse,
one for the pauper that is soon to become
a corpse. There they lay and grin at each
other until at first one and then the other
goes off to the City cemetery in a pine box.
In one of these deadchambers was a tuber
culosis patient under the influence of
opium. He must have had "cousins" of
some means to enjoy the nepenthe. The
other living occupants of these dead
chambers in this "quiet nursing place" lay
motionless and so far as one could see un
attended.
"He die soon," said the voluble China
man, pointing to one patient. Indeed, it
would be remarkable if he lived another
day in these foul and wretched quarters.
Beside him was a door fastened with a
great heavy padlock, which could not be
opened for the inspection of the visitors
bpcause the keeper who had the key,
"Him glon away," explained the guide.
But inside this padlocked room were the
bones of the rich dead awaiting shipment
to China. In each one of these three dead
houses is a "bonehouse," as it is called,
and the man who had the keys to all of
them could not be found.
Both of these alleys will be condemned
by the Health Board, it is expected. At
least they will be reported as public nui
sances. They are certainly endangering
to the public health, for the odors that
come from them are laden with the
microbes of all sorts of diseases.
Haifa dozen other Chinese undertakers
were visited, most of which were found
fairly clean for Chinatown, and one or two
were scrupulously so. But the best of
them are sad affairs, and all of them con
tain berths for the dying. Sometimes a
thin partition divides the bunks of the
quick from the deadâ sometimes not.
What a gruesome, ghastly custom it is,
though, to take a sick man to the under
taker's before death has closed his eyes to
the unpleasant scenes of such places.
In the best and cleanest "Chamber of
Tranquilitv" in Chinatown â that on Stock
ton, near Pacificâ the visitors found a man
making coffins in the front room for the
two dying men in the back room. And
the back room and front room communi
cates hy a large open doorway. It is not
an improper thing, in the Mongolian
scheme of ethics, for the dying man â if he
be poor â to lie in his bunk at the dead
house and watch the undertaker nail to
gether the redwood box that will soon hold
his lifeless form. It was a question, often,
whether the coffin will be ready before the
man dies or tlie man die before the box is
finished.
THE LADY BIKE RACERS
Miss Farnsworth of Minneapolis
Leads in the Pavilion
Contest.
Two of the Riders Collide, Another
Drops Oat, and the Other Is
'Way Behind.
All the exhibits were removed from the
Pavilion yesterday and the cycle show,
which had been conducted so successfully
for the past seven days, was brought to a
close.
The three days' ladies' racing tourna
ment commenced yesterday afternoon and
was continued during the evening. The
contestants were Miss Farnsworth of
Minneapolis, Miss Worth of Oakland.
Miss Mack of New York, Miss West of
Alarr.eda and Miss Peterson of Chicago.
The racing consists of continuous riding
around the track one hour each afternoon
\ and two hours in the evening. The riders
indulge in occasional sprints in the en
deavor to gain a lap or favored position,
which lends considerable excitement to
the sport.
The score after yesterday afternoon's
hour ride was: Miss Farnsworth, 19 miles
4 laps; Miss Worth, 19 miles 3 laps; Miss
Mack, 19 miles 41aps; Miss West, 18 miles
1 lap; Miss Peterson, 19 miles 4 laps. Miss
Farnsworth had a slight advantage over
the others in the finishing sprint.
Dunne the evening's riding Miss West's
wheel broke down, and she was obliged to
drop out after having ridden 27 miles 1 lap.
Miss Worth also dropped back somewhat,
not being able to holu the pace.
All went well until about fifteen minutes
before the end of the evening's racing, |
when Miss Mack and Miss Peterson col
lided on the track and fell. Misses Farns
worth and Worth escaped the general mix
up, the former immediately sprinting and .
gaining -two laps before the others re
mounted and tried to regain the lost time,
but it was a hard race and they were un
equal to the task.
Miss Farnsworth led at the finish, the
score being as follows: Miss Farnsworth,
55 miles 5 laps. Miss Worth, 45 miles 2 j
laps; MiÂ«a Mack. 55 miles; Miss Peterson,
55 miles 3 laps; Miss West, '27 miles 1 lap.
The racing will continue this afternoon
from 8 to 4 o'clock and this evening from
8 to 10, and the same hours to-morrow,
after which cycle racing at the Pavilion is
at an end for this year.
President White of the Associated Clubs
is going to remove John IS. Egan of the
Imperial Cycling Club from his position
on the racing board for what he considers
a very mean trick, Kgan tried to play on
the association Thursday night at iia bene- j
lit ai the Pavilion.
Egan and Jaecling were asked to pace
Otto Ziegler Jr. in his record trial and
agreed to do so. Five minutes before the
event was announce! Egan went to White
and demanded a $25;pri7.e or they would
not ride. White was obi ieed tn accede to
j tlieir demands in order not to disappoint
the public, but at once brought the matter
before the other officers of the association,
and Egan will be removed and severely
censured at the next meeting.
It h probable that the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen will also take up the case
and suspend Eagan from all track-racing
for life. Jaetrling is not criticized, as it is
said he was not a party to the scheme.
The association netted a nice sum for its
treasury by the benefit. All the officials
worked hard for it and the racing men did
their best to make it a success, and they
are all very sore to think that one of their
I own men should try to make anything out
I of the bent-tit.
DEAN'S MINNEAPOLIS COIN
The Forger's Deposit Garnished
by the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank.
WHICH WAS DEFRAUDED ?
The Nevada Bank Has Been Sued for
the Amount of the Raised
Check.
The Crocker- Woolworth Bank has com
menced suit against the Nevada Bank for
the recovery of the $22,000 which it paid
out on the raised check cashed by forger
Dean and his accomplices.
Several days ago the suit was filed by
Lloyd & Wood, attorneys for the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank, and since that time
about $1600 of the amount has been recov
ered. The recovery of this sum was ac
complished vejy quietly and successfully.
When Detectives Seymour and Whittaker
went to Minneapolis to bring back Dean
and McClosky, they were accompanied by
the former office-boy of Dean. He posi
tively identified the men, and this fact not
only facilitated the extradition of the men,
but also satisfied Mr, Maxwell and tne
other officials of the Minneapolis bank
that they would be entirely safe in paying
over to the Crocker- Woolworth Bank the
$1000 which it held as a deposit from Dean.
There is, in truth, (juite an interesting
story in connection with the Dean forgery
case that has yet. to be made public, and
there is involved in it also quite an inter
esting legal question for the courts to de
cide, quite aside from the guilt or inno
cence of Dean. When Dean was first
arrested the Minneapolis Bank officials
announced that there was about $1600 de
posited there in Dean's name. Of course
this sum rightfully belonged to the defraud
ed San Francisco bank, but there was no
precipitate haste made in claiming it.
For a time no one seemed to want the
money. The Nevada Bank had lost noth
ing in the Dean transaction, so it professed
no claim against Dean's estate. The face
value of the check was paid out by the
Crocker-Woolworth B;ink. Still this bant
had assumed the position ihat it was not re
sponsible for the big amount, and there
fore it hesitated to seemingly abrogate its
position by making a demand for the
$1600, which, though a small portion of the
$22,000 check, was yet a sum not to be
thrown away merelyfor the chance of re
covering the whole amount.
In its suit against the Nevada Bank the
Crocker-Woolworth institution disclaimed
all responsibility, and asked the court to
make the iNevada Bank refund the full
amount of the Dean check.
The Nevada Bank's answer to this suit
has just been filed by Attorneys Delmaa
and. Shortridge. This answer alleges, in
brief, that at tne time Dean deposited the
$22,000 check in the Nevada Bank be had a
legitimate balance there of $2200; that the
Nevada Bank received the check merely as
Dean's agent for the purpose of collection ;
that under the rules of the Clearing-house,
of which both banks are members, it is
provided that clearances shall be made at
2p. m., and if for any reason tne check is
refused by the paying bank it must be re
turned to the other bank before 4 p. m. of
the same day; that no money was paid to
Dean till the day after the check was de
posited, when he was paid $20,000, and the
cherk was not returned until about three
weeks after it had passed through the
Clearing-nouse.
Upon these allegations of fact the Ne
vada Bank claims that the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank was negligent in the matter,
and therefore solely responsible for hs own
lO3S.
Before this answer was filed, however,
the Crocker-Woolworth Bank, guided by
the lecal acumen of Messrs. Lloyd & Woou,
began to have a very large yearning for at
least the one-eleventh of a loaf that Jay
within reach, and as a preliminary meas
ure the $1600 in the Minneapolis Bank was
garnished.
Yesterday the money was finally paid
over by the Minneapolis Bank to the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank, the latter risk
ing the technical point involved. It is
definitely understood, however, that the
Nevada Bank will seek to take no advan
tage of this transaction and that whatever
matters are involved in any way in the
criminal proceedings against Dean and his
bank account will in no way affect the
status or bearing of the civil suit pending
between the Crocker-Woolworth and the
Nevada banks.
