An Interesting Bit of
Southern Pacific Cor
respondence.
FOUND ON THE BEACH.
A Railroad Confession That
a Patron Had Been
Squeezed.
THE CHASE OF A TWENTY.
Secretary Gunn Was Led to Protest
That There Was Such a Thing
as Overdoing.
The sea has cast up a curiously unan
swerable bit of evidence against Collis P.
Huntington, which yesterday came into
the possession of The Call.
It is conclusive to the effect that the
policy of the "great man" to charge all
the traffic will bear is by no means new.
Mr. Huntington has been devoting all
his energies and a great deal of his money
in an effort to convince Congress that he I
is a perfectly moderate man ; that what he i
has is the result of legitimate industry on i
his part, and that he never robbed any
body â never did charge all the traffic would
bear, and never said he did.
. A well-known citizen of Sausalito walk
ing along the beach at Lime Point near
the Government works a few days ago,
came upon two large packages .tied up
with ropes. He undid them and found
them to be made up of letters, telegrams and
other papers of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. A greater part were mere dis
patches, telegrams or copies of them bear
ing dates of several years ago. . There
were a number of letters, however, and of
these was the following very interesting
bit of correspondence :
California Pacific Railroad Company,)
Office of assistant Superintendent, >
:,- South Vallejo, Cal., June 5, 1875. >
J. 08. Gunn Esq., Secretary, San Francisco â <
Pear Sir: Queen's circus used our lot at i
Woodland for showing. I didn't know of it
until too late to ask Mr. Towne about charge
and get reply before they left the road. Since j
then 1 have endeavored to have , J. A. F., Sac, ,
collect $20 for me, but they refuse to pay, say
ing lot was included in contract. This Mr.
Towne doesn't so understand. Will you have
men; ares taken from general office to collect
$20 on our account before they leave C. P. R. R.?
Yours truly, A. D. Wilder, Asst. Supt.
On the reverse side of thin letter was
written the" answer of Mr. Gunn to Mr.
Wilder. It is addressed simply "A. D.
W." and signed "J.G." . , ./-.;â 
A. D. W.: We received $1586 for the trans
portation of this circus. Our expense doing
so, at the most extravagant estimate, could
not amount to more than $500, leaving a very
heavy margin in our favor, and 1 think it ex
cessive illlberality to push them for this mat
ter of $20 when they were such a benefit to us
and to our intimate connection, the S. P. R. R.

There it remains and may be seen by any
who may wish.
Nothing that might be added to this sim
ple narrative would strengthen it. J
The California Pacific Railroad Company
is one of the lines embraced in the South- :
crn Pacific system of to-day. The' letter
bearÂ» date one year previous to the consoli
dation. - The line running down the Napa
Valley was built and operated by the big
four, Stanford, Huntington, Crocker and
Hopkins. The California Pacific was' ab
sorbed by the Central Pacific in the con
solidation of 1876. " i l"-.
Its headquarters were at that time at
South Vallejo. ; R. D. Wilder was 'then as
sistant superintendent of 1 that line, sta
tioned at South Vallejo, arid . J. 08. Gunn
was secretary of the company, in the gene
ral offices in San Francisco. r
â¢ Mr. Wilder ; is' now division superin
tendent of the Southern Pacific Company,
stationed at Oakland. The J. \ A. : F."
whom Mr. Wilder endeavored to have col
lect the . $20 at "Sac." is no \ doubt J. A.
Fillmore, now manager of the Pacific di
vision of the Southern Pacific. " 'â¢â  ."â 
The office boy has no doubt been clear
ing out the old files and pigeon-holes of
the : Oakland < office : and has thrown these
dusty old letter* and telegrams in the bay,
whence they have drifted and been finally
thrown up ='â¢ by r wave or tide to the beach,
this one to be recovered and offered in evi
dence here. > â  -- â¢ ..-.'..
If Mr. Huntington has never seen these
letters before his pleasure at the evidence
it gives him of the faithful manner in.
which his orders were carried out in Â» the
olden time will be somewhat offset by the
inopportune time and manner with which
the knowledge comes to him. - . r : !
The wonder is that J. A. Fillmore, who
failed to collect the twenty, has not only
remained in the employ of the company,
but has " been advanced 'in its service.
This would seem to : more than indi
cate that Huntington did not know * of
the incident. that Mr. Wilder should
have progressed rapidly in the favor of the
company is not a matter of .' surprise 1 any
more than that Mr. 1 Gunn should ; long ago
have left the service. He is now secretary
of the Union Iron Works.

sensation that involve? the reputation of a
commissioned officer at Jefferson barracks.
A short time ago First Lieutenant Dugan
of the Third Cavalry, stationed at the bar
racks, came to this city with several other
officers and half a dozen enlisted men.
They are alleged to have made a royster
ing night .of their leave 'â -; of absence. : ; In
company quarters next day Private Hurley
stated that Lieutenant Imgan had become
intoxicated and was taken to the barracks
dead drunk. This caused Hurley's court
martial for disrespect to an ' officer. The"
I other enlisted men supported Hurley, who
i was sentenced to imprisonment, and they
sent a "round robin" to the Nebraska Sen-
I ators at Washington, asking their inter-
I ference. This was ! followed by an investi
i gation by Colonel Henry, commanding the
barracks, and Lieutenant Dugan must un

COMMITTED TO THE

Curious Outcome of a Long
Period of Uncertain
Plotting.
STRENGTH OF ENGLAND
It Is Materially Increased by
Identification With the
Central Allies.
FRANCE CANNOT INTERFERE.
Great Britain Will Now Attempt to
Cut a Wide Swath Through the v
Dark Continent.
[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Eng., March 21.â At all events
Europe finally knows where it is. After
fifteen months of diplamatic chaos there
is a certain relief in touching the firm
ground again and in having light enough
to see where things are, even if the spec
tacle revealed is not what one desired.
For the first time since the death of Alex
ander 111 it is possible to speak of the
international relations â¢of the sir great
powers without all â â¢ sorts of reservations
and doubts. Where such momentous .in
terests are involved this in itself is a good
deal.
Briefly, Europe .is where ;it was at the
close of the late Czar's life, only that Eng
land- is considerably more committed to
the Triple Alliance than it was then. There
are once more two rival hostile camps
with France and Russia in one and the
rest in the other. . Russia has strengthened
herself by gathering into her train Turkey,
Bulgaria ; and Servia, but on the other
hand this .is offset by England's closer
identification with central allies and by
drawing Belgium under ; her wing, ] which .
does not stand for much, but may prove
of considerable importance during the
year.
This is the curious outcome of 'this long
period of uncertainty of underground plots
and overtures to treachery, and of visible
tendencies to break old ties and form new
combinations, and, j sentimentally, ;it is
rather unpleasant. From the ethical point
of view, would rather see Germany
and Russia yoked up ethef , Where they
belong, at least .so long as the Germans
tolerate the ; autocracy that William '. im
poses on them, and see France shake her
self free from; her , abominable association
with oriental despotism and -take: her
proper place again in the band of civilized,
progressive peoples. But, practically, the
Triple Alliance is England's best hold,
and .she has it on reasonable terms, and
has found some way to compel William to
pull straight. ;
Thai some such guarantee is believed to
exist may, I understand, be taken for
granted. Both Austria and Italy have
made bitter representations at Berlin for
the past fortnight, . reproaching William
with perfidy' in his Franco-Russian side
alliances and with gross disregard for their
interests in his silly estrangement of Eng
land. / His answer that only, by these
courses could he make the English com
prehend that they must either join the
Triple -Alliance or. be isolated and
squeezed.
On this line of reasoning he may save
his pride by arguing that his policy tri
umphed, but in effect his allies have said
to him, "Well, don't do it any more,"
aud he was pushed lorward to shake
hands with England and agree to. the
terms of the new quadruple partnership.
What these terms are we have yet to learn,
but of the fact of the bargain there is no
doubt.
The first visible token of this new deal
is England's decision to reconquer at once
the Soudan. It has taken a whole week
to wring little by little from the reluctant
Ministry the confession of this design. It
was not till last > night that . its . inspirer
and author, Chamberlain, deemed : the
moment opportune ' for a complete dis- -
closure". England will continue to de
scribe her stay in Egypt a3 temporary if
her neighbors think It important that she
should do so, but she is not coming out,
all the same, and she is to cut her, way in
force through the Soudan and equatorial
Africa, building roads and permanent
British posts as she progresses, until she
comes out in the Nyanza country, and the
map is all red from Alexandria to Uganda.
' Here Belgium will come in, though this
was hot said, and the : Congo Free , State
will once more <.. cede that strip along the
German East African frontier which Rose- 1

bery vainly tried to secure in 1894, and
which will give to the British a continuous
stretch of territory on the whole length of
the Dark Continent. This is the game,
and Chamberlain is -so. proud of its con
ception that the time came when he could
no longer sit still and hear ' Curzon and
Balfour twaddling about the danger of the
dervish invasion of Egypt. and the im
portance of assisting the Italians in
Kassala; and similar paltry devices for
obscuring the truth. ?;..:â  : ...y---..
--"â  So many official lies were told about the
project at the beginning "of the' 7 week that
the English only to-day began ; the task of
deciding bow they like this fine, bold ad
venture. Plenty of Tories were shaking
their heads until yesterday, but Chamber
lain put a lot of heart in them last night,
and I shall not be surprised if next week
they turn up all cock-a^whoop ' for over
running Africa and painting everything
scarlet.
The argument that with s'ach an enor
mous majority" in the House they can
afford to do something prodigious appeals
to every human instinct, and will probably*
sway them for a time, but 1 g-ravely doubt
if the enterprise will be popular in the
country, even if it remains uncomplicated
by a foreign war. "After all, England's pe
culiar strength is on the sea,. and English-'
men know it when they stop to think, and
a policy which risks their empire in a land
enterprise, locking up their best troops in
the heart of a savage continent, is bound in
time to be feared and hated by them. For
the moment, however, the jingo craze may
enjoy full swing.'
The chances of French opposition and
even interference are not to be measured
merely by the French sentiment on the
Egyptian question. It is true that it will '
.be hard for the French at any time to
listen quietly to such cynical treatment of
England's pledges about the evacution as
is Chamberlain's, but the British project
'touches France even more nearly by men
acing its plans of a mid-African empire.
The inland expansion of the French Congo
territories is not well defined by even the
latest maps, but England can hardly get
beyond Dariur without trampling on
French claims of some sort, and such an
expedition is now outlined, not to men
tion the Belgian force, also preparing to j
Osman Digna, the Famous Dervish Leader, at the Head of His Troops.
[From a sketch made at the time of his warfare with the Egyptians thirteen years ago.]
. start out from the Congo frontier, makes
the prospect of a collision somewhere in
this no man's land almost inevitable.
Hence France feels bound to protest in
plain language. It is clear that there will
be a powerful outcry for something more
than a protest, and that it is to be difficult
for the Bourgeois Ministry to behave as
cautiously as one feels sure it would pre
fer to do. But this reappearance of the
consolidated Triple Alliance on England's
side is lelt to be very embarrassing in
Paris. There are plenty of ways for Eng
land to take as much Egyptian money as
she needs for the expenses of this invasion
whether France or Russia refuse to con
sent or not. It is not even certain yet that
Russia will join France in this refusal, or
if she goes that far that she will go fur
ther. Russia plays always her own hand
in her own way. She can command
â¢ French support for any conceivable plan
of hers, but the French know better or
will soon learn better than suppose that
the converse is true. Russia will not lift a
finger for France if it be not plainly to
Russian advantage. France alone can
only scream reproaches at perfidious Al
bion. --*/-'â -
No doubt they will be tolerably well de
served, but by themselves they break no
bones. It is of course possible that Rus
sia may see a profit to herself in encourag
ing immediate disturbance, but her more
probable policy is to counsel patience and
silence until some dark day when England
finds her African task too terrible for her
strength and must perforce submit to the
will of her enemies. Therefore, unless
Paris gets out of hand and, thrusts a vio
lent policy upon the Ministry, I fancy that
England will be allowed to walk unre
resisted into th c Soudan morass.
So wrapped up in the exciting theme of
. the Soudan has Parliament been this week
that other topics have" had- very litlle
chance of attention. It is rumored now on
the ministerial side that the ordinary ex
tra pension to the Duke of Cambridge will
be dropped from the army estimates be
fore the House reaches a discussion of it.
The first impulse was to ascribe' its mys
terious appearance there after the definite
government pledge that there would be no
such thing to the personal interference of
the Queen, but it is now known that she
resented all her venerable cousin's demon
strations of protest when he was forced to
retire, and was especially, indignant at
this effort to evade the stipulation which
Bhe herself sanctioned when it was made.
Other information narrows the responsi
bility for the trick to the War. Office, and if
this sensational Egyptian business ,, had
not swamped everything else there would
have been by this time a sharp outcry
against Landdowne. Very likely it may
still come, for he is the least popular mem
ber, of the Cabiuet, alike with his col
leagues and Parliament, and if troublous
times are impending the country will
readily respond to a demand for a stronger
and abler War Minister than he has shown
himself to be.
One of the best-known labor members in
the House, Haveiock Wilson, has waged
an obscure warfare in the courts for a
long time with some press critics, whom
he describes as an organized gang of ene
mies who are banded together- to destroy
him. Finally the matter came to an issue,
and his libel suit against them for calling
him a thief resulted in the jury giving
him a farthing of damages. This is equivi
lent to an indorsement of i, the epithet, and
Havelpck Wilson, who insists strenuously.
on his innocence, has begged the House of
Commons to appoint ! a committee of in
vestigation.
This the Government declined to do, and
so Haveiock Wilson will resign his seat
for re-election at the bands of his Middles
borough constituents, who gave him a ma
jority of 2000 votes last summer and will
probably increase it/now. The /'charges
against, him turn on his use of the ship
ping trades union funds, over which he
had control, and only differ in degree from
those continually hinted at ; about other
labor members, who â  are also trade union
organizers and managers. It seems worthy
of comment," however, that {this necessity
for vindication seems \ accepted as natural
in the case of a workingman member of
the House, whereas a rich Tory ex-Mihis^
ter, like Forwood , who has t failed almost
as conspicuously to get a judge and jury
to take bis view of an alleged libel on his
commercial honor, sits tight in his seat
and nobody suggests that he ought to do
anything else.
Yesterday's announcement of the result
of the bye-election in South Louth was
awaited with a certain interest only be
cause of the idea which was abroad that
the Dillonite candidate might actually be
beaten. As it was he scraped through
with about thirty of the Irish Nationalist
majority. Next week the Hon. James
Roche, brother of . Lord Fermoy, who is
said to be a home ruler of some sort, but
whose chief recommendation is that he
will be able ; to draw a comfortable check
j for the bankrupt party fund,, is to be
\ smuggled into the vacancy in East Kerry.
j Ireland, however, no longer pays much
; attention to the performances of this kept
| party, and at Westminster they have
I fallen into utter disregard. Dillon ad
; tried to intervene in the Soudan debates
i several times this week, but he was
! snubbed by the Speaker and coughed down
by the impatient House. John Redmond,
on the contrary, with less than a dozen
votes all told, is coming to be listened to
by the Commons with more attention each
session.
Since the rise of the halfpenny evening
papers to popularity in London the in
creasing space given to circumstantial de
j tail of salacious reports of divorce and
breach of promise * trials has grown to be
generally regarded a3 harmful, and prac
tically there are no two opinions among
decent people as to the desirability of
abating the nuisance, which is quite as
marked in t the penny evening Standard
and Globe as their cheaper rivals, but the
question of means is another matter.
The Lord Chancellor secured a second
reading in the House of Lords yesterday
by a narrow vote for his bill giving to
judges the power to indicate portions of
evidence which the press must leave alone,
but a protest against it by the Lord Chief
Justice, who said that the bench with a
single exception was opposed to it, and by
others in the name of ; tbe liberty of the
press, renders it unlikely that the measure
will ever pass. at least in its present form.
The superior officers of the Salvation
Army here dislike to say ranch about the*
American trouble, but it has been a -great
shock to them and I fear they will hear
some unpleasant reflex action over here,
especially among their women who can
not fail to be more or less " affected by the
news that their seceding American sisters
are to be rid of the odious poke bonnets
and to have uniforms of engaging .-tints'
and shape. They profess to see in those
changes ample evidence that Ballington's
head has been completely turned by social
flattery and that he lost altogether the con
ception of primitive simplicity and
poverty which is the essence of the
army idea, and scout the notion that this
defection will have any disintegrating in
fluence, but it is plain enough that the
poke bonnet issue makes them nervous.
There is a curious report afloat in Paris
that a majority of the Academicians are
privately arranging to elect Alphonse
Daudet to the Dumas vacancy," in defiance
of the old rule about personal visits of ap
plication' by a candidate and in spite of
his savage onslaught on them in 'L'lni
mortel" eight .years ago. It is even said
that an envoy has been appointed to sound
him as to whether he would accept. -His
friends seem to credit the story and are
divided in opinion only as to what view
he is likely to take of the suggestion. The
reactionary papers have been pointing out
for years back, as the. standard of literary
performance was steadily lowered in the
Academy elections, that the effect of the
republic was to strangle literature, and
soon, it will be difficult to find people with
any qualification whatever for a "fau
teuil," and very possibly some such idea
is underlying whatever there is in this re

by the fact that he was a weakly infant.

TO MEET FORMIDABLE FOES.
England* : Advance on Dongola Opposed
. by Well- Armed Dervishes.
: h LONDON, Ekg., March 21.â Last night's
debate in ' the House of Commons added
nothing to the i meager 'â  information 'â¢ that
the Government deems it prudent to reveal
regarding ' expedition that ;' is to "go to
THE l SAN FRANCISCO CALL, _ SUNDAY, MARCH 22, 1896.
Dpngola and perhaps further in an attempt
to reconquer the Soudan. , T y. , "; ";, '
The sensational rumors with which the
British press- is unusually rife deal with
the expedition as a sudden decision of , the
Government, the fact that it was to be dis
patched"} being unknown to the Khedive.
The facts are that the expedition was pro-"
jected last autumn, when General Kitch
ener of the Egyptian army was in England.
Though the date of the campaign was not
then fixed, 'General: Kitchener made no
secret of the â¢ fact; that some big scheme
was being hatched.
'.â [ According to the plan originally decided
upon, Kitchener's first objective point was
to be Dongola and then : Berber, with a
simultaneous advance froiA Suakin on the
Red Sea. A railway was to.be built- to
link Dongola and Berber before a march
was made upon Khartoum.
v According to the Times Dongola may be
reached in three or four weeks. The mil
itary authorities at Cairo, however, cal
culate that that place will not be reached
before June.
The position of the British Government
is easier under official news from Paris
that France will either not oppose the first
credit of Â£500,000 from the Egyptian funds
for the expenses of the Soudan expedition
or will confine her opposition to a formal
protest against the use of j the money for
this purpose. â¢ Russia will remain strictly
neutral and will give no support to France
as against the expedition. Russia is even
credited with viewing the British : projects
with some measure of good will as being
likely to divert the whole energies of Great
Britain in a direction where Russian in
terests* are not ' likely to be greatly con
cerned. M. Berthelot, the French Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, clearly recognizes,
though the French, people do not, that
France is powerless to take an effective
position.
' Russia has no vote in the commission of
the Egyptian public debt, while Great
Britain holds two votes, France two and
Austria, Italy and Germany one each. . A
difference of opinion exists as to whether
the statutes relating to the commission re
quire a unanimous or a majority vote. â  In
several instances : decisions have been
based on a majority vote, notably the
grant of Â£250,000 for the abolition of the
corvee, at which time France protested
against, the grant. At any . rate, M.
Berthelot, * feeling himself powerless to
prevent the expedition, has beaten a re
treat. .
The War - Office officials here declare
that the expedition will be only a recon
noissance in force, and will not admit, that
the present phase is anything but an ini
tial step in the autumn campaign. The
Army Intelligence Department possesses
only the most vague information regard
ing the strength of the Mahdists. . Military
experts distrust the estimates made by
Slatin Pasha, though as a mutter of fact
his. long captivity . among the Mahdists'
should, on the face of things, make him an
authority on the subject.
: The experts consider that a report made
by the Russian traveler Elisefef, who was
recently elected a member of the Russian
Geographical" Society, is more reliable than
that of Slatin Pasha. He says that the
Khalifa's force numbers 40,000 men, in
cluding 10,000 cavalry and camelry. They
possess . 100,000 rifles, of which 20,000 are
Remingtons, really fit for service. The
artillery is poor. There are twenty guns
at Dongola, and five Krupp and ten siege
guns at Omdurman. .
A correspondent of the Army and Navy
Gazette says that the dervishes are now
able to deliver a deadly rifle fire. They
will combine European tactics with the
formidable onsets of cavalry and spearmen
in the old style. The correspondent de
clares that the British tactics of forming
squares and awaiting the shock of battle
will not do now in .fighting the dervishes,
and if they are followed will result in rout
and ruin.'
The consensus of military opinion is
that if a reconquest of the Soudan is in
tended a picked force of British and Indian
troops, 20,000 strong, will be necessary.' It
is no wonder that the British Government
is reticent regarding the details and ulti
* mate aim of the expedition. Even with a
solid Parliamentary majority the Cabinet
does not dare, in the meantime, to arouse
the opinion of the country on the great en
terprise, which is certain to ultimately in
volve large ': expenditures by the British
treasury. Until Parliament rises in Au
gust, Lord Salisbury will; not - disclose the
game that the Government is playing.
The Belgian-Congo Free - State expedi
tion, under the command of Baron Dhanis,
which will attack, the dervishes on the
Upper Nile . simultaneously- with the
Anglo-Egyptian attack upon those on the
Lower Nile, is an assured fact. :
The French press denied that it was the
intention to dispatch such an expedition,
but the semi-official Etoile Beige confirms
the statement made by The United Press
last Saturday that such an expedition had
been formed, and that with the consent of
the British Colonial ; Office a number, of
Houssas had been recruited for it at Lagos.
King Leopold will shortly come to Lon
don to conclude the arrangements for the '
advance of this expedition to the Nile. '>;.'
Baron , Dhanis, with . a strong force, is
now nearing t Bahr-el-Bazel. He has with
him a number of Maxim and Krupp guns. I
The coming conference of the National
Liberal Federation will discuss a special
resolution against the Soudan expedition,
preliminary to the Liberal leaders opening
an agitation against it throughout the
country. . ~, , ;V;.\.'-.-u.r*.. -â â

The Indiana Stranded.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 21.â A Sun
special from Washington says : : The big
battle-ship Indiana, V which failed to be
docked at Port Royal this week for lack of
water, is now in . a situation where she can
neither dock : nor reach the ocean, and
should her services be suddenly required
the Government would ', find itself minus
the most powerful righting ship now in
commission. Â ' ;.Â»'**â¢
- The high western winds swept the water
of the sound out to sea and reduced ; its
normal depth several feet. Where ' there
was thirty feet at the dock's entrance some
time ago there is | now hardly twenty-four.
The vessel therefore now lies in a hole a
few hundred yards below the dock, unable
to get to the sill or pass across the bar. to
sea. She will have; to remain until next
week, when the moon is full and the tide
gets up to the - normal height, when she
s will probably slip into - the - dock without
trouble. Â° ' \'
The question of the location of this dock
is one about which/ there is a difference of
opinion, and some of the best-known of
ficers of the Navy Department believe that
a serious â¢. mistake was made when < Port
Royal was selected '":, by a? commission ap
pointed by Secretary Tracy. . A dock, these
officers say, should be so situated that a

badly routed.
Colonel Francis was brought here se

MADE VERY GOOD SPEED
Satisfactory Builders' / Trial of

Massachusetts.
â¢
It Is Estimated That the '; Cramps Will
Secure a Handsome
Bonus..
PHILADELPHIA, ; Pa., March 21.â
battleship Massachusetts : , dropped anchor
in the Delaware \ River ; this .evening at
Deepwater Point, off Wilmington, â  after
having been put through a most ; satisfac
tory trial yesterday off the Delaware Capes
by her builders, the Cramps of -this city.
The made a record of 15.6 { knots'/ in
an hour's run, which translated means
18)4 miles of land variety. Should she do
as well when called upon for her official
trial under Government auspices she will
net the Cramps $50,000 in premiums, every
quarter knot in excess of 15 knots, the re
quired speed, meaning $25,000. -^
j"5 That the vessel will easily accomplish
this and probably do better is rib doubted
by the builders, "for ' the trial -.% just com
pleted was made under anything but the
favorable conditions that surround an offi
cial â -. test. During â¢ yesterday! sVtrial ; only
steamboat coal â : was used, and, while â¢it is
good enough for ordinary purposes, it has
not -the C steam-making \ propensities of
hand-picked Pocahontas coal, which will
be used on* the official trial. In addition
the bottom of the battleship was decidedly
foul as the result of two years' immersion
in fresh water, and this acted as a draw
back to great speed.
" Most important of all, the course off the
Delaware Capes is not as favorable as is the
Government run off : the New England
coast. . :, , ; ;; - Â V .,â¢.." -"â â 
: J - No special effort waa \ made to push the
ship to her full speed except for one hour.
This, in fact, was divided into halves, and
the ship had only reached her speed when
the end of the course was neared. --â â 'â¢
The Massachusetts left Cramps' ship
yard on Tuesday in command of Captain
Sargent, the machinery â¢ being under the
Eersonal supervision of Edwin S. Cramp,
he arrived at the Delaware Breakwater on
Wednesday and waited until Thursday to
proceed to sea. ,: \
: Old ocean was anything but kind to the
new ship, meeting her with a terrific gale
that caused ; a tremendous sea. Beyond
giving a few plunges to see how she be
aved nothing was done on this day, and
the ship - was put in safety : behind the
breakwater for the night. The -Massachu
setts demonstrated her seaworthiness to
the satisfaction of all on board. She was
steady and broke the billows easily. Yes
terday the sea â¢ was in a more pleasant
frame of mind, and at 8 a.m. the vessel
cleared the capes and headed for deep
water.
Off Five Fathom Bank lightship to Fen
wick Island lightship, a distance of eleven
knots,- the trial was made. The ship sped
over the course in grand style, and after
being turned about sped back again, com
pleting her trial; and making 15.6 knots as
her best hour's run. After some trials of
the steering-gear, which were satisfactory,
the battleship was headed for the capes,
and she passed in during the afternoon.
The run up the Delaware Ktver to-day
was uneventful, except for the continuous
salute of all, passing craft, and she an
chored for the night off Deep Water Point
to avoid any chances of an accident in the
dark.
Edwin S. Cramp and several others left
the vessel to-night and returned to Phila
delphia in a tug.. Mr. Cramp was much
pleased with the success of the trial. He
said the engines worked nicely, marking
128 revolutions when the ship was put at
her speed. The Government will be noti
fied immediately that the battleship is
ready for her official trial, and this will
probably take place within a month. If
possible she will be docked before it occurs
and have her underwater body thoroughly
cleansed. She will come up to her berth
at the shipyard to-morrow.
CALLING IN WORN COINS
Subsidiary Silver to Be Replaced
by the New Design
of 1892.
Since 1890 the Government Has Lost
Over a Million Dollars in
This Way.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 21.â A1l
the old and worn subsidiary silver coin of
the United States will soon be replaced by
the new design adopted in 1892. The
progress being made, in that direction by
the United States mints is most encourag
ing to treasury officials.
For some years past efforts have been
made by the Treasury Department to keep
the subsidiary silver coin in good condi
tion.'|Bsfi|Efe!'' . *5 H
With this view appropriations have been
obtained from time to time to reimburse
the treasury of the United States for the
difference between the face value of worn
subsidary silver coin and what they would
produce when transferred to the mints for
recoinage. , Since 1890 the amount of such
coin, worn and uncurrent, and subsidary
coin transferred by the treasury to the
mints for recoinace, has amounted to $29,
--642,384.
The value of the same in the new sub
sidiary silver coin is $28,535,745, showing a
loss by wear of $1,106,633, which was re
imbursed to the treasury of the United
States from appropriations for that - pur- i
pose. The amount transferred from the
treasury to the mints from July 1, 1893,
to December 31, 1895, was larger than from
any other period, amounting in the aggre
gate to $20,964,962, face value, and pro
ducing $20,113,820, showing a loss on coin
age of $848,843.

Disposal of the Surplus in
the Revenue Almost
Caused a Crisis.
' "
DR. MIQUEL VICTORIOUS.
Adhered to the Statutes and Pre
vented an Imperial Sink
ing Fund.
WILLIAM HEARD THE SQUABBLE
The Prosecution of Dr. Peters for His
Barbarities in Africa Will Not
Be Dropped.
- -
BERLIN, . Germany, March 21.â The
strong divergence of. opinion existing be
tween Dr. Miquel, Prussian Minister of
Finance, and Count Posadowsky- Wehner,
Imperial Minister of the Treasury, over
the question of the year's surplus of the
imperial revenue has come very near pro
ducing a Cabinet crisis. The affair has
been very widely discussed by the press
and public, and has divided public interest
with the matter of the attitude of the
Dreibund toward the Anglo-Egyptian ex
pedition. The newspapers have made the
announcement that Count Posadowsky
had resigned and have also hinted at Dr.
Miquel's resignation, but neither the an
nouncement nor the suggestion was true.
The facts of the case are that an actual
crisis has been averted, leaving Dr. Miquel
in occupation of the stronghold of advan
tage, fortified by the statutes. Under the
laws and constitution of the empire the
â¢ surplus of imperial revenue goes to the
Federated States by division. The trouble
came about in this way:
Count Posadowsky proposed to comply
with the spirit of a recent vote of the Reich
stag and divert part of the surplus for the
amortization of the debt of the empire, and
Dr. Lie be r, leader of the Centrist party,
supported Count Posadowsky by introduc
, ing into the Reichstag a motion proposing
the creation of an imperial sinking fund,
while Miquel adhered to the statutes pro
viding for the division of the surplus
- among the Federated States. The dispute
came during the proceedings of a Cabinet
council at which the Emperor unex
pectedly made his appearance. Not one
of the Ministers seems to have suspected
the intention of the Emperor to interfere,
and it is probable that his action was the
result of a suddenly formed resolution.
His Majesty first drove to the Chancel
leiie, presuming that the council was being
held there. He found that Prince Hohen
lQhe was absent and that no council was in
session there. From the Chancellerie he
drove to the Reichstag building and entered
the Bundesrath chamber, where the Minis
ters were assembling.
. - , He took a seat next to Prince Hohenlohe
and gave close attention to the discussion.
In the debate which ensued Dr. Miquel
supported the Bavarian, Wurtem berg and
Saxony plenipotentiaries in the Bundes
rath. He insisted upon the strict obser
vance of the provisions of the statutes, con
tending that the question had close rela
tion to financial reforms which he had
long planned. It was necessary, he said,
to demonstrate to the Reichstag that the
disposal of the surplus of the imperial rev
enue . must have a bearing upon these
plans. It was finally agreed to prepare a
bill providing for such temporary appro
, priation of funds for the purpose of amor
tization of the imperial debt from part of
the surplus as will not interfere with the
claims of the Federated States. This dis
cussion is a compromise indorsing the
principle of Dr. Lieber's proposal without
infringing upon the statutes.
The debate in the Reichstag on the
colonial estimates has had another victim
besides Dr. Peters in Dr. Kayser, the di
rector of the Colonial Department of the
Foreign Office, who resigned. It is prob
able that Prince Arenberg will become the
bead of the Colonial Office and Freiherr
Marschall yon Bieberstein Minister, of
Foreign Affairs, with a view of making
the post acceptable to Prince Arenberg,
- who is understood to be willing to raise
the Colonial Office from a mere adjunct to
the Foreign Office to an independent sec
tion with a Secretary of State at its head.
This would imply that Prince Arenberg
will be a colleague of the Foreign Min
ister, not a subordinate, as Dr. Kayser has
been. This step will secure to the Govern
ment the support of the Colonial party
and the Centerists in the Reichstag. It is
. possible, however, that the Emperor will
not find Prince Arenberg to his taste as a
Secretary of State, as the latter is a strong
opponent of the idea of increasing the
strength of the navy.
The inquiry into the accusations made
against Dr. Peters has been confined to
the direction of Councilor Schwartkoffen.
The principal witness will be Herr Bau
mann, Austrian Consul to Zanzibar, who
went to Kilimanjare after the executions
which Dr. Peters ordered had occurred,
and gleaned from the natives the details
of the executions. The inquiry promises
to last a long time, as , the necessary wit
nesses are - scattered the world over; but
the investigation will not be suffered to
fall through in consequence of the delays
which will be inevitable. The Centerists,
Freisinniges and Socialists are as eager to
see Dr. Peters punished as the other par
ties ars to see him vindicated, if possible.
The Kaiser's visit to the Court of Vienna
in the middle of April will be strictly pri
vate. There will be no fetes and no dis
play.
> ~" Professor Fine of Princeton University
is in Berlin. He has been introduced by
J. B. Jackson, United States Charge d'Af
faires, to Dr. Bosse, Minister of Ecclesi
astical Affairs, Instruction and Medicinal
Affairs. There is now reason to state that
a prominent Berlin savant will go to the
Princeton celebrations commemorating
the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary
'of the organization of that institution as
the guest of the university. Although the
Berlin University, through its rector, Pro
fessor Wagner, will decline the Princeton
University's invitation and the Breslau
University also declines, there are plenty
of German professors ready to become the
guests of Princeton as individuals, but if
the university wants such guests as repre
sentatives of the German universities they
' will be difficult to obtain.

dozen enlisted men from Jefferson Bar
racks, St. Louis, on a charge of having
given perjured testimony before 'a recent
trial board at their barracks in a case aris

men. The accused men are said to have
shielded their comrades.

from Omaha, was side-tracked here to-day
and the members of the party received an
enthusiastic welcome. Governor Richards

NOT A COMMON CARRIER
An Answer Filed in the Suit
Against the Joint Traffic
Association.
Lake Shore Outlines the Defense of
Thirty-Two Railroad Com
panies.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 21.-The
Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Rail
road Company, one of the thirty-two rail
road companies defendant in the suit of
the United States against the Joint Traffic
Association, has filed its answer with the
clerk of the United States Circuit Court.
In substance, the document recites that
the Joint Traffic Association is not incor
porated, is not a common carrier and is
not engaged in the transportation of
freight and passengers nor in trade. It ad
mits that all the defendant companies are
common carriers, either separately or in
connection with one another, but denies
that any of them hive been otherwise en
gaged in interstate commerce or that they
have been engaged in any trade or in rela
tion to any article or commodity "within
the scope of said agreement."
It is denied in the answer that the joint
traffic agreement entered into on Novem
ber 9, 1895, is in any way unlawful, or that
it is intended to restrict honest competi
tion or to establish rates of fare or freight.
The joint traffic agreement, it is alleged,
does not surrender the control of traffic to
the board of managers, although the asso
ciation is advised and believes that it has
the legal rights to do so. It is the purpose
of the association to prevent illegitimate j
competition and the payment of -rebates
aud commissions, which ; are ruinous to
legitimate railway traffic. The fixing of
rates by the hoard of managers is contem
plated only so far as to give connecting
roads their pro rata share.
In concluding the answer declares that
the railroad companies parties to the
agreement are not, nor is the Joint Traffic
Association, subject to the provisions of
the act of Congress entitled "An act to
protect trade and commerce against un
lawful restraints and monopolies," ap
proved July 2, 1890.
The answer of the Lake Shore and
Michigan Southern Company is said to be
identical, in substance at least and prob
ably in text, to the answers to be received
from the other defendant companies, and
which it is expected will be filed with the
CiÂ«rk of the Court on Monday next.
FUR DEALERS COMBINE.
Will Control the Entire Trade of the
United. States. >
CHICAGO, 111., March 21.â A secret
meeting was held in this city a few days
ago, the result of which will be watched
with the greatest interest by not only the
retailers, but also the wearers of fur gar
ments throughout the country.
The meeting was attended by represen
tatives of all the large firms engaged in the
manufacturing and wholesaling of fur gar
ments in the United States, and was called,
it is said, for the purpose of effecting a con
solidation or trust. The following firms
were represented : H. S. Liebes & Co. of
San Francisco, Charles Glanz of Chicago,
John T. Shayne of Chicago, The A. E.
BurKhardt Company v of Cincinnati and
Robert Meyer & Co. of Leipsic, Germany.
The conference resulted in the formation
of a consolidation, Chicago being selected
for the headquarters of the organization,
which will be known as the North Ameri
can Fur Company. The principal whole
sale and retail warehouses will be located
in this city. '
The capital stock was placed at $1,500,
--000, and the executive management will
be made up of representatives of the vari
ous firms which are members of the com
bine. The entire fur trade of the United
States â¢will be controlled by the company.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 21.â the
atrical matinee express train on the ele
vated road, which left One Hundred and
Fifty-fifth street at 2 o'clock this after
noon, southbound, collided with a light
engine northbound, on the lower end of
the big curve at One Hundred and Tenth
street and Columbus avenue at 2:10, and
three men were injured.
Daniel McGrady, engineer of the express
train, is internally injured and may die.
Theo Schroeder, engineer of the light' en
gine, had his right arm fractured.' Michael
Smith, fireman of the light engine, re
ceived internal injuries, but will recover.
The accident is due to the custom of
Sherman Smith, the train-dispatcher at
Fifty-ninth street, to start two trains from
opposite ends of the road, going in opposite
directions on the center track.
The light engine reached the big curve
at the lower end just as the express came
in sight around the corner of One
Hundred and Tenth street and Co
lumbus avenue. Both engineers reversed
their engines, but could not stop them.
Before either engineer could jump to save
his life the crash came. The express train
butted against the front end of the light
engine, staving the boiler head in and de
railing the forward trucks. The mo
mentum of the train was so great that it
bumped the light engine fully twenty feet
before it could stop.
In the cars of the express train there was
intense excitement. Passengers were
hurled from their seats, windows were
broken and for a few moments it looked
as though death were at hand. The cars
i crashed together and some of the. wheels
l were lifted several inches into the air,
; but fortunately not a car left the track.
i The accident was seen from the One Hun
dred and Fourth street station, and word
was telegraphed to One Hundred and
Forty-seventh street for a wreckage tain.
The employes of the One Hundred and
Fourth street station removed the injured
men from the wrecked engines and Am
bulance - Surgeon Robson took them to the
j Manhattan Hospital. After a delay of
nearly half an hour traffic was resumed.
CRAZY HORSE'S MEDICINE
A Bullet-Proof Mixture That
Cost the Life of His
. Brother.
Pawnees, Comanches and Kiowas
Have a Serious Attack of the
Dancing Fever.'
WICHITA, Kans., March Pawnee
Bill, who has returned from the four bands
of the Pawnee tribe in Western Oklahoma,
brings word that the majority of the In
dians have left their farms and moved into
tepees on Black Bear Creek, where they
are engaged in the Messiah dance and
i medicine-making.
Crazy Horse, one of the principal medi
cine men of the tribe, claimed to have
made a medicine that rendered bullet
proof any one anointed therewith. It was
agreed. that the test should be applied to
his brother. The Indian was placed in
front of the council of chiefs, stripped and
smeared with the medicine. At a given
signal he was shot at with a rifle. The
bullet penetrated the heart, causing in
stant death. The Indians were, greatly
incensed at Crazy Horse, and he was
brought before the council for trial. He
was rich in cattle and horses, and it was
decided to confiscate all of his property.
The Federal officers, it is . expected, will
indict him on the charge of murder. b The
dancing fever is spreading to the Co
manches and Kiowas. .
CHINESE BOYS COMING.
They Will Be Educated in the Regular
Western Way. -;.â¢"
NEW YORK,' N. V., March 21.â
Journal says this morning: Some time in
May ; Rev. K. - K. Hule, whose Chinese
name is Hule Kin Kwang, will arrive in
this ; city convoying ; thirty-five : Chinese
boys, each one about 10 years of age. They
are coming : with the consent of the Em
peror of China and the favor of this Gov
ernment. The boys are all from the prov
ince of Kwang Tung. :
There is this material difference between
the cases of these boys and the little
fellows who ' were â¢ sent here twenty-five
years ago to c be educated by the Chinese
Government: Those boys, some of whom
are , grad nates:; of Yale, Harvard and Am
herst, still live " here, honored, : respected
and ' thoroughly " Americanized, = ; with
American wives and : children, came b bent
on training, their j minds only. The com
ing thirty-five are to train their hands and
eyes as well . as ; their i brains. - It >is pro
posed to develop them into civil engineers,
mechanical engineers, electricians, I con
structors of -railways and to ' thoroughly
and practically instruct them in various
trades.
: The. boys are coming by way of San
Francisco and the Southern Pacific, and
all arrangements have been consummated
in Canton and Hongkong to enable' them
to come through smoothly. The ! Presby- c
terian Board ;of Missions has had this
practical - undertaking in view for. a long
time. 'The boys will receive their prepara

INEFFICIENCY AND NEGLECT.
Serious ; Charge* I Preferred Against New
Orleans Mint Official*. _'
- WASHINGTON, D. C. , March 21.â There
are ' serious charges spending against
United States Mint officials {in \ New } Or
leans of inefficiency and neglect of duty.
These charges are contained in a report of
Cabell Whitehead of the Mint Bureau at
Washington, who recently made an ex
amination of the t mint at- New Orleans.
His report has been referred by Mint Di
rector . Preston to !, Secretary Carlisle, r who
will no doubt take an; early opportunity. of
laying the same before : the President, as
the superintendent, .melter' and] refiner,
coiner and assayer are : all Presidential ap
pointments. ; A 7 copy of the : report ? was
sent to Superintendent Cade, some dayiÂ»
since, who was authorized to show the
same to the other officers of the mint and
his attention was particularly called to the
law - and ' regulations governing . the at
tendance of officers and other employes.
The New Orleans mint was closed last
November, ' but opened again for silver
coinage on February 1 last. . ~ z . v T- '
RELEASED A MONTH AGO.
That Pari* Dispatch About Waller Was
Rather Stale.
WASHINGTON, D.C., March2l.-Secre
tary Olney , said' to-day that he could not
understand the basis for the story from
Paris, published to-day, that John L.
Waller had been released yesterday from
prison, as Waller, had been released last
month. Waller's relatives here say he is
in England. A dispatch stating that
Waller was still in prison was published in
American papers about a week ago. The
statement that Waller was released yester
day probably arose from the formal ex
change of notes between Embassador Eus
tis and the French Minister for Foreign
Affairs closing the Waller incident. Waller
was released just one month ago to-day
and the State Department was promptly
notified by cable of the fact by Mr. Eustis.
HEARING AN ADJUSTMENT
Good Offices of the Unite*
States to Settle the Uruan
Incident.
Venezuela Will Soon Pay Dearly for
the Arrest of a Petty
Constable.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 21.â The
so-called Uruan incident has been divorced
from the Venezuelan boundary dispute
and practically terminated, it is under
stood, through the good offices of the
United States, without the representatives
of Great Britain and the South American
republic coming into direct relations re
garding the affair. The Uruan incident,
so called, had at one time a somewhat
threatening aspect, but finally developed
into comparative insignificance, capable of
exceedingly tame adjustment. It is stren
uously contended by those most inti
mately concerned that the incident never
had an ultimatum stage, and that there
was never any foundation for the report
that a British fleet would be called upon
to imitate the Corinto demonstration.
â  While ' originally the claim presented
through the German legation in Novem
ber, 1894, was for a violation of the frontier
of British Guiana, and therefore insepar
able â¢ from the ; boundary controversy vat
Secretary Olney s insistence,' Great Britain
a few weeks ago modified it into a demand
similar in effect to that pressed by Italy
against the United States on account of
the New Orleans riots in 1890, which claim
was settled by the payment by President
Harrison of a certain sum of money out of
the State Department contingent fund.
It is understood that the Uruan demand
now simply becomes one for personal dam
ages'inflicted upon British property and
persons by Venezuelan officials, leaving
out -of the controversy -' the question
whether the occurrence was : upon Vene
zuelan territory as being irrelevant.
'When Douglas Barnes, the British
Guiana ; constable, was arrested in July,
1894, by Venezuelan soldiers, on' the right
bank of the Cuyuni River, which he had
crossed' to stop a Venezuelan, planter from
cuttinc trees on land which he owned, the
Venezuelan Government paid Barnes $300
or $400 on account of his imprisonment,
which he personally considered as satis
factory. But when the Colonial Govern
ment heard of it considerable indignation
rose in Demarara and the damages were
soon, magnified to enormous amounts
which at that period the Home Govern
ment felt constrained to present as a claim
against Venezuela. After two years, how
ever, and in view of the changed aspect of
the boundary dispute the claim has
dwindled to "$5OOO,- and this amount is
firobably about what Venezuela will short
y -pay, with the distinct understanding
that it does not affect the title to the terri
tory upon which the arrest occurred.

Two big windows full of these goods, and
it being the first Saturday of this offering no
doubt had a tendency to bring out the crowd,
which it did and nearly blocked the entrance to
our store and locked up every aisle for nearly
an hour. Those that passed the big store
between the hours of 3 and 4 will attest to it.
It was an ovation tendered one of the greatest
mercantile sales in the history of commerce,
that for pluck arid nerve cannot be excelled any

LABOR RIOT AT
INDIANAPOLIS
Clubs, Stones, Brickbats and

Used.
INTENSE EXCITEMENT.
Two Non - Union Men Fatally
Shot and a Bystander
Wounded.
MANY SKULLS WERE CRACKED.
The Battle Opened by Foundrymen
Who Went on Strike a
Year Ago.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 21.â
serious labor riot, which resulted fatally
to one man and the injury of several
others, occurred here between 5 and. 6
o'clock this evening on West Washington
street, the rioters keeping up a running
fight for more than a square and creating
intense excitement on the crowded thor
oughfares.
Nearly a year ago the employes of
Taylor & Chandler's foundry went out on
strike on account of a difference regarding
wages and since that time there has been
periodical troubled The strikers were de
termined that non-union j men should not
work and the management was equally
determined to employ no other labor. .
The strikers proved so aggressive when
non-union men were brought here from
Pittsburg and other Eastern cities that the
firm was compelled to place bunks in the
shops and serve its men with other needs
inside the works. .
This evening, when the men left the shop
for the day a crowd of union men advanced
upon them from the west and at the same
moment another crowd appeared on the
east, thus having them between two ' sec
tions of their enemies. With a shout the
strikers attacked the non-union men with
clubs, stones and brickbats and a general
fight ensued.
While the men were thus struggling
with each other several pistol shots were
fired, and William Watson : and Walker
Davis, non-union men, and Hopker Lee, a
bystander, were shot. Lee received two
bullets in the neck, but neither of the
wounds is considered fatal. Watson was
shot in the thigh, the bone being shat
tered. The wound may prove fatal.
Davis was shot through the head, and
was taken to his home in a dying con
dition.
A number of the strikers were beaten
with stones and clubs and some badly bat
tered by the tin dinner-pails in the hands
of the employes. Several of the employes
were also beaten with stones and clubs,
but they, scattered and ran when the
pistol-shots were fired. The full list of the
injured could not be secured. The police
finally quelled the riot.
STUBBORN MANUFACTURERS.
Chicago Clothing Men Positively Refuse
to Arbitrate.
CHICAGO. 111., March 21.â commit
tee of clothing manufacturers, represent
ing the association which is .fighting the
Cutters' Union, met in conference this
afternoon a special committee of promi
nent men and women named by President
Baker, on behalf or the Civic Federation,
to make a final effort to induce the em
ployers to arbitrate, the Cutters' and Gar
ment-workers unions' having consented.
The manufacturers positively refused to
submit to arbitration, claiming the right
to deal â¢ with tneir employes separately.
They were in an angry mood at the pub
lished reports of the starving condition of
the strikers and their families, as discov
ered by the Hull House investigators. The
report denounced the manufacturers for
refusing to arbitrate, and declared that the'
destitution of many garment-workers was
due to the payment of starvation wages
and getting work only eight months of
the year. The sympathy and: support of
the public was bespoken for the strikers. '
NOT PERMITTED TO FIGHT
Police Cause the Bout Between
Choynski and McCoy to \
Be a Fizzle.
Boxing Dead in New York, Except
When Carried; on by the /bj
Big Clubs.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 21.-Tfae
prospect of seeing a six-round bout 'be-;
tween , Joe Choynski and Charles (Kid)
McCoy, who recently defeated Tommy
Ryan,'. the welter-weight champion, drew a
big crowd \to the ; " boxing ; tournament at
Grand ; Central Palace to - night.;! The
sports were all anxious to see how the
"Kid" would acquit himself when pitted'
against the well-known strength and
ability of the shifty Californian. On his
showing to-night the sports expected to
get a line on the "Kid's" true form and!
determine whether he' was a * first-rater or
not. "Brooklyn Jimmy" Carroll officiated
.as referee. ; ; 'â 'â¢' ;-â  '.'"' 'â¢
The first bout was between Solly Smith
of Los Angeles, Cal.; and Jerry Barnett of
this city, at 123 pounds. Smith did all
the leading and had his man clearly over
matched when the police interfered â¢ and
the referee stopped the bout after forty
seconds of the first round had been fought.
Smith got the decision.
The next pair were ; Charley j Ãarmon of
Jersey City and Morris liagerstrom of
Providence, R. I. â¢ They boxed four rounds
and Hagerstrom was the winner.
Paddy Purtellb the Kansas* City welter-'
weight, and: Jim? Butler of Brooklyn, the
old-time ex-amateur ; middle-weight, fol
lowed in a six-round bout at catch weights.
Butler had his -man guessing during the
first round, but. after that it was almost
plain sailing for. Purteli. in the third
round ; the ;- police interfered. Purteli was
declared the victor.'- ?b'bbb'.
Jim Handler of Newark and; Jack Mur
phy of Long Island City engaged in the
next bout. The police stopped" it in the
second round, deeming the boxing too
rough. .''-?-. .v.. â , -'â¢ "b- ' :> "T-Xf. "';'â ' â - ':' '
Then the Choynski-McCoy bout, the star
event of the evening, was. announced. The
police said they would not allow the bout
to go on on its merits.: At this ; the crowd,
rose as one man and hissed. Tne men then
shook hands . and confined themselves to
exchanging love taps. 'â¢ ''. - f : â¢â¢''-"
The ; greater ; part of ; the crowd rose to
leave, while \ the demonstrations of disap
proval continued. The men finally stopped
sparring, and v Choynski -'! stepped to the
front of the stage and said that it was, no
fault of c his McCoy's that ; the bout was
stopped by the police. *â: 'â¢â â ". A.-" < '
This appeased the better element,' and
it remained silent. The show ended in a
fizzle, and the men stopped sparring at the
end of the third round. : - .- ..:,'. .>:
The general opinion of the disgusted
spectators was that boxing was dead in
New York City . except when carried on
under the auspbees of the big athletic clubs,
and then only in buildings occupied by
said clubs.

Yacht* Moved Very Slowly in the Cannes
Race*. .. -
CANNES, France, March 21.â The yacht
matches to-day from Cannes to Nice were
hampered by light winds. The yachts
moved so slowly that little interest was
taken in the races and many people left
the shore, seeing that it was going to be
practically a drift to the finish. The rac
ing began at 8 o'clock this morning and
lasted until nightfall. The Satanita led
at the outset, with the Ailsa second.
The yachts got ~ into > the doldrums of
the Gulf of Juan and lay becalmed there
for a long time. Finally a flaw of wind
struck the Ailsa and she slowly - forged
ahead and managea to. carry i across the
finishing line. \ It was after dark when she
won. The Satanita is believed to have fin
ished second.
The second match was won by Mr.
Ogden Goelet's Samphire, * with the Ste
phani second and the Dusky Queen third.

A MILLION DOLLAR FIRE
Works of the Pennsylvania Salt

Streams of Gold and Silver Solution

TARENTUM, Pa., March 21.â A de
structive fire broke -'out at 6 'o'clock this
evening in the works of the 5 Pennsylvania
Salt Manufacturing Company at Natrona
and for a time complete destruction was
threatened. The loss is $1,000,000,; proba
bly covered by insurance which.is placed
through the Philadelphia; offices of â¢! the
company. The greatest. loss is sustained
â¢in the -melting of the tanks in which the
gold and silver solutions were stored and
their escaping- into the river. Some idea
of this may be gained when it is said that
100,000 ounces of silver, a/id j 3,000,000
pounds of copper were produced monthly.
This department consists of a large num
ber of frame buildings, covering an area of
three acres and which contained blast fur
naces, smelting furnaces and leaa-linea
tanks for storing the gold and silver solu
tions. . .; ... \", â¢ â¢; â  -
The works possessed fine electrical ap
paratus and chemical appliances and were
the, finest in the United States. The in
vestment in 'this alone amounts to $940,000.
Nearly GOO men were employed and it was
being run ': double turn. ; '"..' 'â¢"'.
: . The flames [ spread -with such rapidity
that it was with difficulty that the men es
caped, although only two were slightly in
jured. The officials here are reticent as to
the origin of the fire,, but it was learned
from good authority that a quantity of
water was allowed to escape into a furnace
which caused an explosion. The depart"
ment destroyed was the cause of the law
suits now pending between the farmers in
the vicinity of Natrona and the company,
the farmers claiming the fumes destroyed
their trees and crops. The litigation has
already cost many thousands of dollars.'"""

VIRGINIA-CITY, Nev., March 21.-H.
W. Tangerman, the superintendent 'ap
pointed by the new management of the
Hale & Norcross Mining Company, V was
violently seized by members of the Virginia
City Miners' Union this morning, placed
in a buggy and driven out of the county-
He was not i released until Dead- Man's
Point was reached. Then he was notified
that if! he did net proceed on his way
he would be killed without being
granted the privilege of a last prayer, and
then released. V v
Early this morning a crowd of miners
congregated on the streets and a crowd of
several hundred men began a search for
Tangerman. '.The superintendent 7 was
finally discovered in a barber-shop getting
shaved. He! was taken bodily out of the
chair with v his face still covered with
lather and placed in a buggy amid a cheer
that shook the foundations and rattled
the glass in the adjoining building?.
The buggy then beaded for Geiger grade,
accompanied by hundreds of miners. At
the end of C street the large crowd halted
and returned to town, while fifty miners
in buggies continued with Tangerman to
the county line, where he was notified to
go on and never to return to Virginia.
Sheriff James Quirk made a futile ef
fort to stop the demonstration, but the
odds against him were ; too strong. The
only man he could find in town to depu
tize was Director McDonald, who finally
refused to fight. There was no stemming
the tide, and the citizens had things their
own way.
This trouble has been brewing eve*" since
the control' of the mine passed to
Jeremiah Lynch at the stockholders' meet
ing held at San Francisco on March 11.
The new officers gave an intimation of
the policy of economy they intended to
pursue ;by knocking $25 a month off the
president's _ salary, making it $100; taking
the $50 a month salary from the vice-presi
dent; reducing the secretary's salary from
$200 to $125 and combining the positions of
superintendent and foreman at $175 a
month. b
These positions formerly paid salaries of
$200 and $175 a month respectively. It was
also decided to move the offices of the
company into the Stock Exchange build
ing, which would bring about a saving of
$127 a month, making a total saving of
$477 a month effected by the recent elec
tion. Ifg^SpÃl
President Lynch and Superintendent
Tangerman arrived at Virginia shortly
after the San Francisco meeting and at
once were met by the refusal of the Min
ers' Union to work with Tangerman. The
miners had no objection to open the Hale;
& Norcross, but Tangerman must go. That
was the ultimatum. Mr. Lynch stood by
his superintendent and this morning the
situation remained unchanged until the
miners took the law into t heir own hands.
There will be more f serious, trouble if
Tangerman ventures to disobey the orders
of the men who escorted him out of town.

Tangerman Appeals to District Attorney

RENO, Nev., March 21.â Superintendent
Tangerman, who was escorted out of Vir
ginia City by the miners to-day, arrived
here shortly before 4 o'clock this afternoon.
â  He was taken as far as Dead Man's Point
by the miners and made to alight from the
rockawa'y in which he and his guards were
riding, and told to continue on \to Reno
and never again set foot in Virginia City,
under penalty of death.
Dead Man's Point is about .'fifteen miles
from here, and Tangerman was compelled
'to walk most of the way, securing a ride
on a hay wagon for a short distance. Im
mediately on his arrival here, he made ap
plication to United States District Attorney
Jones for protection, and that offioial later
left- for Virginia City by private con
veyance. Â-.-.,

the crowd commenced .to i flow away from

their vacations at home, and those who do
not are leaving every hour on tramps and

Stanford has the affirmative.
The debaters have already collected quite
a large amount of material, and each one

tion,' although they will individually cover
the- whole ground. They ; ,will '.;â  spend : a
freater part of the vacation ;in the : San

great benefit thereby. Professor Ross
stated . that, individually, he favored the
popular election of the Senators very em
phatically, and believed that our men bad
chosen the stronger side of the question.
Professor Ross stated that the evil of the
present system was the mixing of National
and - State politics, whereby State issues
were neglected, to the . harm of ~ the ; com
monwealth. The recent Kentucky dead
lock was an object-lesson which, no doubt,
the debaters would take advantage of. He
stated that the question was a live one, and
would require careful research through
many files of papers and periodicals. : '

SONORA JAIL TRAGEDY.
Rancher Randall's Body Found
Suspended' From a . Bar

Grief Over the Killing of His Son
While Insane Drives Him to
Suicide.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 21.â Rhodes
B. Randall, the aged Sonora! stockman
who yesterday shot his son, Hazard Ran
dall, in cold blood, will never face the bar
of earthly justice, nor will he be examined
as to his sanity. At 7 o'clock this morning
the cell in which Randall was confined "at
Sonora was opened by the jailer in order
that the prisoner might be given his
breakfast. Randall was found hanging
from the bar !in the window, dead. He
had passed his blanket around the bar and
then tied it around his throat. Then his
weight was thrown upon . it, and \he was
strangled to death. Â
. The old man left no word for his family
and had evidently become sane enough to
realize the enormity of his crime and that
the shadow' of the gallows hovered, over
nim. v \; ; b 'b b-b.b'bbb"'.'.; '- !.b f ;'' ;' "'-
Randall shot his son yesterday morning
on his! ranch, about four miles â  from La
Grange. The circumstances of the killing
indicate that the old man was insane. He
had for some time exhibited symptoms of
insanity and had been under the surveil
lance of the members of "his family. Yes
terday morning he took down his rifle and
asked Hazard if he could go out hunting.
The young man advised him not to go,
whereupon Randall aimed his gun at his
son and,- pulled the trigger. The bullet
passed through the breast and out at the

VISALIA'S DEAD
BANDIT BURIED
Dan McCall's Brothers the
Only Mourners at -
His Grave.
BITTER TOWARD LOVREN
They Declare the Saloon-Keeper
Planned the Attempted
Robbery.
STORY TOLD BY AN INEBRIATE.
Boasts While Intoxicated That the
Accused Men Made Him Their
Confidant. - ...
VISALIA, Cal., March 21.â The funeral
of Dan McCall took place from Locey's
undertaking parlars at 10 o'clock this
morning. The dead outlaw's two brothers,
Frank and James â  McCall; who arrived
here from . Santa Cruz last evening, were
the sole mourners. ' Joe Arana, an old
acquaintance of the family, rode with the
brothers out of respect to their feelings.
The interment took place in the city
cemetery^ . -
The two brothers are bitter in their de
nunciations of Sy Lovren and Ardell, and
declare that Dan McCall was led into the
attempt to rob the Southern Pacific over
land by these men and used as a tool by
thera. The last time Dan visited them at
Santa Cruz he told his relatives of two fast
friends he had here. The description of
these "friends" and their place of business
tallies exactly with the Lovren saloon and
the two men who presided over it.
Sheriff Merritt, his men and Special Offi
cer Jim Meade of "the Southern Pacific are
working day and * night securing evidence
against Sy Lovren and his partner, Charles
Ardell. .After Ardell closed the saloon
Wednesday night he visited the places
that were open with friends. They were
at the Visalia House bar when a boy
opened the door and shouted that a train
had been held up and Earl Daggett shot.
Ardell said, "Let us go to the Palace
and get facts." This they did, and some
time after one of the party, a piano-player
at Lovren's saloon, returned and reported
that the boy spoke truly. Ardell, instead
of waiting for the ; tram , to arrive with the
body of McCall, went to a; notorious resort
and was found there by the officers.
Ardell's friends overdid themselves, in
trying to fix up an alibi for him. The evi
dence against Sy Lovren seems conclu
sive. The red cheesecloth he bought for
the lantern will be the strongest evidence
to hang him. ! .
The officers have another frequenter of
the deadfall under surveillance. The
morning after the robbery he said: "I just
missed getting in that hold-up. Sy knew
I was game and would stay." He boasted
that he knew enough to; hang the whole
outfit. The fellow is a good workman, but
at present is on a spree. On f being ques
tioned closely he denied ever having made
such remarks, but the ; fact is he did make
them.
-No arrests have been made to-day. Sev
eral frequenters, or rather hangers-on, at
Lovren's have bean run down and made to
explain their absence and doings during
the past week. Two of the principal ones,
George Hens haw and Fritz' Stumpf, left
here a few days ago in a buggy with three
guns. On returning last night they ex
plained that they had visited the Burris
ranch, about six miles from â¢ Traver, to
hunt coons. b .
'They did not hear of the hold-up until
Friday evening. After treeing and cap
turing a coon they came to town and were
informed that the officers were looking for
them. They in turn found the officers
and after announcing their whereabouts
were not arrested. ; ; ' -
Frank Davenport, a young man who
works but visits Lovren & Ardell's place,
was invited to the Sheriff's office this
morning and explained his ride of last
Sunday morning to Goshen in company
with Dan McCall.
' ' "About 8 o'clock ; last Sunday morning
Dan McCall drove by our place with a
horse and cart," said Davenport. "On
seeing me he stopped and started to talk
about going over to Alma Hall's about a
horse trade he had in view. I asked him
if he was going to town and: he answered
â¢yes.' : I asked him to wait until I changed
my clothes. We then : drove to Hall's,
but he -did â  not stop there. I asked
him why and he b turned it 'off
with the remark, 'Sunday is an unlucky
day; some other day will do; I would
rather go to b church.' ' Just as we were
passing the Kaweah Flour 'Mill .his' horse
stumbled and McCall flew into a passion.
He said to me, 'I will -give him- a good,
long drive; . don't you want to come?'
Having nothing else to do I accepted.
"We drove through the main street of
Visalia and out the Linwood lane. On
nearing the Southern Pacific track: instead
of turning around for Visalia he drove on,
turning ' north toward Goshen. I wanted
to know why, and he said, 'That's all right ;
we have plenty of time. When we reached
Mill Creek crossing (near the scene of the
attempted hold-up Wednesday night) he
got out and walked a short distance toward
a big oak tree. When I loooked , around
later he was not in \ sight. b I called, but
there was no answer. Some minutes after
.ward I called again, waited and called the
third time. It was r almost a half-hour be
fore he showed up. I told him I was afraid
a train would come along and frighten the
horse. He said nothing, â¢ but now 1 re
member that he was in a deep study. We
drove on to Visalia via Goshen,
â¢.â v: "I y have a gold 'watch- and chain and a
ring worth about $80 belonging fto! Dan
McCall. ' They are in pawn to â  me. \ I will
deliver them to the Coroner.".; ;. ...
V Davenport was not arrested. Everything
is quiet, and there is no ' talk of lynching.

RACE ON SAN DIEGO BAY.
Spirited Contest Between the Rowing Teams
From the Flagship Philadelphia's
Sturdy Men.
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. March 21.â A spirited
boatrace between tbe firemen and deck
hands of the flagship Philadelphia this
afternoon brought a big crowd to the bay.
The race was for $100 a side, but in addi
tion to the main wager something over
$2000 was put up on the side.
The firemen rowed in the ship's first cut
ter, which is a much heavier boat than that
used by the deckhands, it weighing be
tween 2600 and 2700 pounds.
The race commenced at 2:15 o'clock.
The course was from the flagship to and
around Diamond Beacon and return to the
Philadelphia/a distance of about three
miles.
There was a tremendous crowd on board
the Philadelphia, and the launches and
yachts on the bay were well filled with
interested spectators. A big cheer from
the flagship was given the boys as they
started, and another cheer greeted them
as they passed the Monadnock.
At the start the firemen, who were an
especially strong crew, took an easy lead,
which they increased as they neared Dia
mond beacon. The beacon was rounded
beautifully by both crews and every man
pulled a strong and steady stroke.
On the return the deckhands made a
slight gain, but the firemen could not be
caught. They finished the race winners
by twenty second*. The total time was
26 mm. 55 sec.
The finish was greeted by more cheers
from everybody, and by the shrieking of
steam-whistles "from the coal-bunkers and
all the launches and steam craft on the
bay.
Visitors from all over Southern Califor
nia are here to see the Philadelphia and
Monadnock.

HOLLISTER POISONING CASE.
Body of a Third Tramp Found Near the
Town â Had Stolen Meat Intended
to Kill Rats.
HOLLISTER, Cal., March 21.â A third
body was discovered this morning near
the scene of yesterday's poisoning. It
was found at a tramp's camp, and near by
was a can containing calf's head stew.
Evidently t is was the cause of the three
deaths. The calf ahead had been stolen
from a slaughter-house, where it had been
poisoned with strychnine to kill rats. The
last body has been identified as that of a
tourist named John O'Brien.
Ail three bodies have been interred in
one grave in potter's field. The two bodies
found yesterday in a barn near town were
not identified. -
EVERY ONE WANTS IT.
Application!! Pouring: In for the New
Encyclopaedic Dictionary.
. The fame of the new Encyclopedic
Dictionary has evidently preceded its dis
tribution in this community, for the an
nouncement a few days ago that it' could
be secured has resulted in numerous appli
cations, not only from the city, but'remote
points.
The evident desire on the part of the
public to possess the book has doubtless
been materially augmented because of the
fact that the Pacific Coast Newspaper Syn
dicate of 36 Montgomery street, in order to
introduce the work, has offered 500 sets on :
terms absolutely unheard of for so vain- '!
able an educational work. -
It is published in four large quarto vol
umes oi over 5000 pages with numerous
illustrations to explain the definitions, and
to secure one of these few introductory
sets it is only necessary to send $1 as the
rim payment and the complete set will be
delivered at once, the balance being pay
able at the rate of $1 25 per month for one
year or at the rate of about 4 cents per
day.
Â£ut of course this nominal price applies
only to the introductory sets, for the sub
scription price of the books is $42 per set.
Even at this latter price ths work has
practically ," no competitor, .; for '_ it is not
only the most recent and, complete Eng
lish dictionary extant, but it is also a most'
comprehensive encyclopaedia: *
Even with- all this wise condensation the
volume of the work: much exceeds either
Webster or Worcester and contains 110,000
more words than the former and 1.14,000
more than the latter. v
And when â > one considers that it is pos
sible to secure a complete and : perfect set
oi this splendid publication and after the
cash payment of $1 have a full year to
complete the purchase at the rate of. $1 25
per month, it would indeed seem that
the. book-buyer's millennium hart arrived.
Such is | really the case, but this ' most
favorable opportunity to secure ; a ; work
of life-long ; value at a merely; nominal
price will pass -when the introductory,
sets are exhausted, at "which tilne the reg
ular subscription price of $42 per set will
prevail."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAIECH 22, 1896.
FRESNO'S GREAT
RABBIT DRIVE.
Ranchers Rid the County
of a Myriad of the
Pests.
WAGON LOADS OF DEAD.
Estimates Place the Number
at Twenty Thousand or
More.
PENNED IN BY A HUMAN WAIL
Frenzied Animals Charge the Line
of Men and Boys in Efforts to
Escape.
FRESNO, Cal., March 21.â "We have
met the enemy, and they are oursâ about
20,000 of them." The rabbit-rushers of the
San Joaquin Valley have redeemed them
selves. The' kill to-day has been variously
estimated at from 15,000 to 20,000, so that
20,000 is a fair and conservative : estimate.
It was the people's day, and well they did
their work.
The estimate of the kill was based on
that of the G. A. R. drive of 1892, when
Governor Markham was in attendance.
There was then a bounty of 1% cents on
each pair of ears,. and the county paid for
over 15,000 pairs from that drive; 10,000
more of those caught were lost or hauled
away, and the number of slain rabbits was
placed at 25,000. The slaughter then, it is
conceded, was greater than on the present
occasion. . b.b
The double-entrance corral plan worked
to a charm to-day. The line of people
crescent . shaped, started about seven
miles on either side of the corral, and was,
at the outset, about eighteen miles in
length. The great â¢ semicircle was grad
j ually contracted until the corral was
j reached 2p. m. Very few of the pests got
| away, and no complaint this time attaches
ito the right wing. b b ; '
About 8000 people took part in the drive.
The extreme north point of the crescent
started near Collis, and the south point
near Caruthers. On the approach the
right or north wing outspeeded the south
field, and this forced the great body of
pests to the south of the spur-fence line.
When the lines had sufficiently contracted
to permit the elbows of the men and boys
to touch the order was given to drop to
their knees.
Then they formed such a compact mass
of humanity armed with clubs that escape
i for the rabbits was impossible, but the
! little animals boldly charged the solid line,
; and nearly half the great slaughter took
j place outside the corral. At least 10,000
i animals were forced into the enclosure
J and there killed.
la a few minutes aftei the corral was
reached wagons with â  four ana six horse
teams were loaded with dead rabbits and'
were being hauled in every direction for
the benefit of neighboring hogs and
chickens. Hundreds of others will be
shipped to San Francisco, where they will
form part of many "chicken" tomales.
Two coyotes met their death in the drive
i and another was overwhelmed and killed
; by a mass of rabbits after he entered the
! corral. Hundreds of the rabbits were also
j killed in a like manner. Altogether there
! was glory enough for one day.
The territory over which the drive was
] made embraced about seventy square
j miles. The corral into which the rabbits
! were finally driven was situated at a point
I about fifteen miles southwest of this city,
near the west side railroad. The corral
covered about three acres of ground.
Diverging from it were two wings, made
of fencing, to form a perfect barrier against
escape of the rabbits. The wings extended
about four miles on each side of the corral.
The country which was traversed by the
drivers is of a rabbit-producing nature,
being unsettled and just at the edge of the
colonies. In its wild and natural state the
! rabbits find a perfect home, with delight
ful feeding grounds, cultivated by the in
dustrious colonists only a few miles dis
tant. It is an ideal location for rabbitdom.
It was in just such a place that .the
thousands of rabbits could be found, and
this is why the promoters of the drive se
lected it for their operations. Beside? an
ideal home for rabbits it was an ideal place
for a rabbit-drive.
At 10 o'clock the line of march was
formed. It stretched for several miles in
a semicircle from the extremities of the
wings. The line < was well formed and
thoroughly under the control of the com
mander-in-chief and his aids. The contin
gent from Oleander, Washington colony,
Fowler and Chicago baa started at 8
o'clock several miles east of the regular
line. '.â 'â¢â 
They arrived with a good drove of rab
bits at 10 o'clock and took up a position at
the southern extremity of the line. Every
thing was in readiness for the general ad
vance when the word was given.
The . people from the city formed the
north end of the line and those .from the
| country between Fresno and Washington
colony the center.
It was a most striking gathering of peo
! ple. Vehicles of every description were in
line. Men and boys could not restrain
themselves, and had to go to the front on
foot and hurl their death-dealing clubs.
And such noise! It was almost pande
monium. V. ' -
Assemblyman Frank Rowell was com
j mander-in-chief, and he showed good gen
eralship. At the recent drive this feature
was entirely lacking, and failure; was
mostly due to this. At to-day's drive the I
people were kept in regular line and under
the directions of the marshal throughout
the drive. ; : -^\y. , ' â  . -
'â¢,_-; A few of the more excited ones, who
would rush ahead of the regular line of
march, were quickly sent back to where !
.they belonged jas soon as Frank Rowell
caught sight of them.
\ The marshal was ably assisted by H. W.
Skinner and Supervisor' C. W. arratt,' who
as aids had charge of the right division.
The left â¢, division was under Dan Smith I
and J. T. Lowery, and the Center under j
Grand Marshal Rowell. b These bad num
erous subordinate aids to carry out their
, orders. filtP@^*Â§PJ ' ' "'
b Taken as a whole the crowd obeyed very
well. It Sad been generally given out sev
eral days before the drive that steps would
be taken to keep absolute order in the line'
of i march."?: The ; people came j with '.-j this
idea, and the commands 'were promptly
obeyed.
As the great semi-circle of people,
wagons, horses and bicycles narrowed be
tween the wings toward the corral the
line doubled and redoubled , until it was 1 a
dense mass. As the corral was neared
there was a great mix-up. The people
surged around the corral to get a glimpse
at the sea of jackrabbits: b ; r .'.''-~. ;â 'â â;
For nearly a half-hour were the unfortu
nate cratures kept in suspense of life that
the people might view the unusual-spec
tacle. Finally, the .word was given, to be
gin the slaughter. ;o.; J; -Â
It seemed as if : < the people were frenzied.
They were â¢ bloodthirsty. Whack, whack!
; went the clubs as they descended upon the
[ cowerihg rabbits. Men and boys crowded
I into the corral to exterminate the pests,
j and in the dense throng many a shin re
j ceived a blow w.ich was intended for a
I rabbit. Pitiful as a babe's is the cry. of a
rabbit, but no heart was moved in that
slaughter-pen.
To stamp and crush and beat out the
sparks of life of the innocent creatures was
the whim of the crowd for the hour.
The farmer looked on with glee. To him
it was a benefaction. Self-preservation is
the first law of nature, and to the farmer
the saving of his crops is self-preservation.
The amusing . features, of course, oc
curred during the progress of tbe drive.
As the rabbits were springing from their
retreats in weed-bushes and the ground
as the people advanced, some of them
would become so excited that -they would
attempt to plunge through the line of I
people.
Then the clubs would fly, mercilessly in
tended. The flying clubs would ; open a
gap in the crowd and Mr. Rabbit would
in some rare cases make his escape through
the line,- but generally he would be struck
by a well-aimed missile and stopped from
further progress or escape.
The fencing which was used for the cor
ral and wings was recently purchased by
the county. The Supervisors appropriated
|3CO for the purpose. They have appointed
a committee :of citizens to take charge of
it and keep it for future drives in the
county.
The Supervisors are desirous of pro
moting rabbit-drives, and if ; a few more
drives as successful as to-day's are held it
will materially lessen the number of the
pests. _________^____
THE FIGHT FOR TITLES
Mission Defense Union Held a
Rousing Meeting Last
Night.
Speeches Made by Supervisor Hobbs,
Auditor Broderick and Director
Henderson.
The Mission Defense Union, whose
motto is "Millions for defense but not a
cent for blackmail," held a largely at
tended meeting last night at Phoenix
Hall, President Noit m the chair.
The principal object of the meeting was
to discuss the question of protecting the
titles of the property-owners from the
claims of the Noe heirs, and also to discuss
the proposition of purchasing the ground
of the abandoned Hebrew cemeteries
bounded by Nineteenth^ Dolores, Twen
tieth and Church streets for the purpose
of a public park.
Incidentally the question of the Mission
High School was touched upon and that
desire of the people emphasized.
Rousing enthusiasm was manifested j
from the dropping of the president's gavel
for order till the end of the last speech. g|
Among the speakers of : the ,'; evening
were Supervisor Hobbs,: School Director
Henderson and Auditor Broderick.
Resolutions submitted by John Bolger
were adopted, outlining 'â the plan of work '
for the union and stating that the main
purpose ever before the members should be
to protect and defend the titles of their
property against the fraudulent claims of
the Noe heirs.
Secretary A. P. Van Duzer, also attorney,
lor the club, stated he would move Mon
day to have the case set for trial at the
earliest possible day; also, that there was
over $150 in the treasury and that the
membership had increased from 321 mem
bers last Saturday to 368.
The committee appointed to confer
with the cemetery trustees reported
they had communicated with the trustees
of both Sherith Israel and Emanu-El,
who had evinced a willingness and a pref
j erence to sell the land at one deal rath r
j than by piecemeal for residence nurposes.
David Hughes : of Ocean View was
I elected a member of the executive com-
I mittee. '
Mr. Van Duzer stated he wished it dis
j tinctly understood that not one dollar of
the money contributed by members should
j be used for any other purpose than for
I fighting the Noe heirs. It was to be â  de
voted exclusively to this, and had noth
ing to do with the improvement " feature
lof the club. He explained in reply to a
i question .. that the San Francisco Savings
Union had written notices to property
holders having mortgages simply to show
that that corporation would carry on the
fight if the property-owners did not, and
that by an arrangement he had made the
Savings Union now referred all such cases
to him. '
Supervisor J. K. C. Hobbs said he had
seen Attorney, Creswell in regard to the
legality of the City's purchasing the cem
etery land for use as a park, but : the . at
torney was unable at present, owing, to a
rush of affairs, to investigate, but would
do so in a few days.
"Where we live," said George Van Rey
negom, "is the most picturesque portion
of the City." We need a park â to further
beautify it and a high school for our chil
dren, and we should state unanimously
our desire to the Supervisors." j
T. V. O'Brien advocated the transforma
tion : of \ the Spring "â  Valley , Lake Merced
land into a public park to balance Golden
Gate Park in the western part of i the-City.
"I think we had better let the next gen
eration deal with that -park," said George
Walcomb.' ..â 'â â  b :
"I am for a park out here," said Mr.
Hobbs, "for the poor to useâ one so
far away that they f must pay carfare to
reach it. I believe the City can buy tne
cemetery ground without regard to the
one-twelfth act, and! pledge ;my vote for
any undertaking of tnis kind, but do not
propose to vote tor a park out near Ingle
side."
Auditor Broderick said he saw no ob
jection to the City buying a lot, and if legal
proceedings are necessary, he; promised to
put the amount into the estimate for taxes
tor next year. â¢*.
School Director Henderson voiced the
sentiments of the previous speaker. He
saw no trouble' in 1 getting a park if the
legal side of it was all right. .;.
A. B. Maguire of the -Folsom -street club

SANTA ROSA'S
WATER FIGHT.
Citizens May Be Denied the
Benefits of the New
System.
OLD COMPANY ACTIVE.
McDonald Elliott Files a Claim
to the Output of Spring
Creek.
ANOTHER LEGAL FIGHT LIKELY
Scheme to Sell the Consumers That
Which They Now Receive for
Nothing.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 21.â A sen
sation was created here to-day, when it be
came known that some one had laid claim
to the waters of Spring Creek. And when
it was definitely ascertained that it was
McDonald Elliott, a nephew of Colonel
Mark L. McDonald,, the president of the
old water company, and the real plaintiff
in the case of Mock versus Santa Rosa to
defeat the new water system, some indig
nant talk was indulged in. bfb} â 
The waters of Spring Creek flow past the
wells from which the water supply of the
city is derived under the new system.
This creek is, in fact, looked upon as part
of the new system. If from any reason
the wells should fail, or should be pumped
out during a large conflagration or other
emergency, the waters of this creek have
been relied upon to fill the deficiency. In
order to secure the supply Mayor E. F.
Woodward, on behalf of the city, filed a
claim on the stream some time last fall.
A well was sunk to the creek bed, and it is
claimed that this is sufficient work, in the
eyes of the law. to secure the city's rights
for a year. â  Â£ V
Elliott declares that he claims and ap
propriates all of the waters of the stream;
that it is his intention to, use the water for
irrigation purposes, and to conduct the
same through a 12-inch main to the city of
Santa Rosa for domestic purposes. There
are many objections urged to Elliott's
scheme, the principal one being that the
people of Santa Rosa claim to own the
water. The proposition to bring this water
into town and sell it to those who are now
getting it for nothing is not meeting with
a clamorous public approval. .
A VGERED MAYOR WOODWARD.
Attorney Lynch* Strictures Call Forth a
Protest to the Court.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 21.â The
case of Wesley Mock versus the city of
Santa Rosa, to obtain an injunction ; re
straining the city from accepting the new
water works, has been on trial. all the
week, and the taking of testimony, was
concluded to-day. Attorney Lynch of
San Francisco opened the argument; for
the plaintiff and claimed the attention of
the court until adjournment. Lynch de
nounced tbe City Council in unmeasured
terms, and accused : the city officials of
fraud.
At one time Mayor E. F. Woodward be
came indignant at the pointed remarks
and jumped to his feet to protest. The
Mayor asked permission of Judse Dajn er
field to correct some of the statements of
counsel, but was informed that the attor
neys for the city would soon have an op-
Eortunity to "roast" the plaintiff and that
c must wait his turn.
Lynch will continue his speech Monday
or Tuesday and will be followed by ex-
Supreme Justice De Haven, Judge Rutledge
and City Attorney Co wen for the defend
ants and C. S. Farquar' of Petaluma will
close the argument lor plaintiff.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 21.â
Officers of the steamer Al-Ki, which arrived
from Alaska this afternoon, reports that
the streets of Juneau present the appear
ance of a typical boom mining outlet.
Every business house and dwelling is
occupied, and hundreds of miners are
camping in the streets waiting for the time
for going into the Yukon.
It is now apparent that . scores of men
who have gone north from California and
Puget Sound intending to go into the
Yukon this spring will never reach there
on account of lack of funds. Many are.
already stranded in Juneau and Sitka and
will be able to go no further. They are
bewailing their fate and desire to advise
friends to keep away from Alaska unless
they have money enough to carry them
through the summer. There are only

MASS-MEETING OF
UNION PAINTERS
A Public Demonstration of
Strikers and Their
Friends.
LARGE STREET PARADE
Metropolitan Temple Filled With
Workingmen From Other
Unions.
THE TRADE AT A STANDSTILL
Master Painters Say the Spring Work
Will Be Postponed Until
the Fall.
The striking painters held a street parade
and a big mass-meeting last evening. They
started from their headquarters at 115
Turk street, and, headed by a brass band,
marched 1100 strong down market street
and back to the Temple,- where prominent
speakers addressed them on the labor sit-

uation. Songs and. recitations enlivened
the meeting. The big hall was filled from
the rostrum to the extreme end of the gal
lery, and the greatest enthusiasm pre
vailed. *
At a regular meeting of the painters
yesterday the committee's reports showed
that nearly every one of the large jobs in
the City are completely tied up. So far as
the strikers could learn not over a dozen
of their men, out of about 1100 members,
have proved unfaithful to their union ob
ligations and are at work. These men will
be expelled in disgrace from the union
and blacklisted. As soon as the Building
Trades Council's working card goes into
effect the backsliders will be driven from
every job where union men of any class
are employed. The painters are confident
of winning the strike, for they are sure of
being supported - by the Building Trades
Council on April 1.
So far very few have been reported as
being in bard circumstances, and tbe
wants of these few have been relieved.
The relief committee is having good suc
cess, and is in receipt of many donations
from the sympathizers and friends of the
striker?.
The Master Painters sum up the situa
tion by saying ''all is quiet along the Poto
mac." They claim that the present strike
will cause them to postpone until the fall
much of the work they should be perform
ing now. They say that the, property
owners are willing to wait until the strike
is settled before making contracts. The
association has nearly doubled in mem
bership since, the strike began.- It is
equally confident of winning.
THE PAINTERS' PARADE.
Over Eleven Hundred Men Cheered
as They Marched to the :
Temple.
The parade of the striking painters, pre
ceding the mass-meeting, was a grand suc
cess in spite of the rain. They assembled
at the Temple at 115 Turk street to the full
number of , the union and started - out led
by a volunteer band from the Musicians'
Union.
The only transparency in the parade was
one on which was the inscription "Painters'
and Decorators' Union. Card System."
It ! was carried by G. W. Freeman. Just
behind this were carried two beautiful
large American flags, between which was
the elegant * banner of Carpenters' and
Joiners' Union No. 483.
The men stepped i out with a cheer Â«as
the band struck up the "Red, White and
Blue.".' .
V When each* division of fifty men turned
on the countermarch at Third street three
cheers were ) given": for The Call, and the
"cheering continued for ten minutes.: ,
; At several points along the route hearty
cheers were given to the striking painters
by their- sympathizers * on , the sidewalks.
*On the whole the parade ; was very impos

IN METROPOLITAN TEMPLE
An Enthusiastic Meeting and a
' Strong Arraignment of the '
Master ' Painters.
Metropolitan Temple was crowded to the
gallery b with the red-ribboned painters.
The meeting was called to order by Presi- ;
dent Rose, who. after a few remarks intro
duced Charles Isham to the applauding
audience.. . ..-...:, ..<...
The speaker dwelt enthusiastically upon 1
the united action of ; the painters in their \
struggle against wage reduction: He spoke
! of the excellent demeanor of the Painters'
Union during the present strike. No act |
j of violence had been perpetrated, and only
I moral suasion had ; been used to carry out
' the objects of the strike. Said he: -' -'.
Never has a movement swept a city as this j
one has during the last ten days," and it can be
said that the Painters' Union of San Francisco
has conducted this strike more creditably than
the painters of any city in the United States.
But the great bone of contention in the pres-.
ent strike is the card, that little piece of paper.
It seems to have caused as 'much trouble here
as the ballot In the hands of the negro caused
to the politicians in the South. I hear the most
idiotic definitions from the boss painters. They
say falsely that nobody can work without the
card.
The card is one chart of reforms, and here
let me speak of one of those reforms. , I have
worKed in a number of cities, and I can say
there is not so much peril to life and limb
anywhere as here. I refer to the scaffolds on
which the painter works. In New York, Chi
cago and St. Louis the boss is responsible for
the safety of the painter; but -no such pro
vision prevails here. There is nothing for the
workman's preservation. This shows how
little is done for him.
Thomas Bree then delighted the audi
ence with a very artistic rendition of "The |
Last Rose of Summer" on the banjo. A
loud burst of cheering greeted the entrance
of the Carpenters' and Joiners' Union, the
delegates from which came into the hall
preceded their banner and a number of
Hags. As they took their places a voice
yelled, "Three cheers for the Carpenters',
and Joiners' Union," which cheers were
loudly given with a "tiger." Mr. Bree
then continued his song, which, abounded
in local hits, some referring to the strike,
being vociferously applauded, and before
leaving the stage the songster gave a ditty
entitled, "Tbe Girl Who bold the Gum."
Mr. Rose then announced that a local
eating-house bad arranged to give a re
duced rate to strikers who might patronize
it during the pendency of the strike.
â¢ John McAuliffe sang "The Armorer" in
spirited style.
R. T. Mclvor was the next speaker. He
read a statement from one of the master
painters, published in a local newspaper,
wherein it appeared that the master
painter gained the lion's share of the
profits. Mclvor, continuing, said that the
master painters marched under the black
banner of piracy'with a black president at
their head, whereas the working painters
appeared with a rosy president and
standard, whereat Mr. Rose bowed his
acknowledgments. Mr. Mclvor continued:
The tactics of our. opposers have | been so
mean and dastardly. The fact is that this or
ganization intends to demand, more than a
minimum wage of $3. The master painters are
not workmen. Not one among twelve of them
is a practical mechanic. All they know how to
do is to drive men. Nay.it would be nearer true
to say that not one in fifty Knows aught of
anything save bulldozing. We shall demand a
well-recognized apprentice system. The pres
ent regime is disgraceful.
If we lose this strike our condition will not
be greatly imoaired: The worst that can come
to us is that* we shall return to the circum
stances from which we are endeavoring to
escape, ; But I for one am sure that we shall
win the day. We are making a manly, cour
ageous, stubborn fight, with little money in
our treasury and with nothing but morality
and justice on our side. I Our contention is one
which Involves great principles of right.
Hence we call upon the public: we invoke
the aid of .organized labor In r our supnort.
Hitherto we have received : naught but scoffs'
and insults from our drivers and tyrants. We
must see how they will greet, the protests of
1500 united journeymen painters. Will they
tell all these men to "go to the devil," as they
have until now answered every plea offered by
their employes? : .b^ ,
. Let us have order, discipline and solidarity.
We have no intention of returning to work
under former conditions. ; We will stick to the
strike, if need be, till we starve. Let us only
keep . faith with each other, and ' stay ;by each
other, and, in spite of all opposition, we will
win. " - â¢ -;â¢ ' -.. â¢ .
, President .McCartney of the Carpenters'
and Joiners' Union spoke as follows: â /[': l
I congratulate the painters upon the stand
they have taken in this struggle. 1 have affili
ated with painters in ! many States and I can
say I nave never met a finer body of 'men than
I meet here. Your organization is splendid
and your unity of action will carry you to sue-
What Is the trouble? . The card. \ The Master
Painters' Association says â¢ that they are kick
ing against the card, but I say they are kick
ing against your organization. What lies they
tell about the card! A master painter said he
proposed to run his ; own d usiness, and inti
mated that the union â¢â  would take ' from him
what was his own. . They are fearful of , "their
own." . They are a piratical crew sailing under
a black flag, and their leader Is Black. That is
their color all through. -They call everything
"their own." [Applause." â¢
"They, these master painters, pretend to : be
the intelligent class. 1 tell you there . is : more
brains in the painters' organization in one day
than you will find in the Master. Painters'
Association in â . a ."lifetime. ; I know some of
these so-called master, painters who left jour
neymen work because they would have starved
at it.-. Part of their labor? is to join with the
wholesalers and keep the painters from pur
chasing in the market if. they would ; compete
with the bosses for work. â >--... â¢-"- Â - i.

I have been told that the master painters are :

The men on this platform know.' this. 'Master;

and coercion :is their method of work. : Why
can - there not 'â¢ be a decent modus : vlvendi,
whereby one party engages to employ and the
other to be employed?; ; â¢ -f ; â 
The employers are 'â â¢ now ,' claiming â â¢ that you
are seeking to coerce them. * But they seem
to forget that they, having become arrogant
with power, are trying to coerce and bulldoze
you. One man with a wife and little ones can
be made to work for a mere pittance when be
stands alone. But when . he has beside him,
shoulder to shoulder, a strong union of 1500
men the bulldozing process is not so easy.
It is to the' interest of oppressors to crush
trades unions, but their maintenance in : full
force and vigor is a matter of life and death to
the workman. , -
Under the present competitive system the
best a workman can hope to get is a pittance
in place of what is rightly his. Statisticians
say that wealth in the United States is increas
ing in the ratio of $10 daily to each man em
ployed. : "Which of you receives $10 a day? If
you do not receive it why do you not?
The answer is simple. The fruits of your
labor must be divided with your employers,
giving them the lion's share every time. There
is something wrong about our present social
conditions. We see a man dressed in the
height of fashion, and he, who does not work
at all, receives the homage and consideration
of the crowd. The workingmau whose
labor and earnings go to build up
the social, political . and commercial
fabric of American life is barely
recognized as human by those whom
he has helped to feed. This must and will ; be
stopped. The reckoning day is coming and
cannot be long delayed.
Mr. Martin's words were applauded to
the echo, and the meeting adjourned, after
giving three cheers for. the press, which,
the members say, has done much to ad
vance their cause.
HOLDING TOGETHER.
Very Few Union Painters Are
False to Their Obli
gations.
bAy rousing meeting of . the . striking
painters was held yesterday afternoon at
115 Turk street. The men seemed to '', feel
encouraged on account of the reports that
not over half a dozen jobs of painting are !
in ' progress in this City, and not over a
dozen union painters have proved unfaith
ful to : their obligations. v Much time was
consumed iri listening to reports, after
which about a dozen new members were
initiated.
. C. L. Ames stated that he had heard that
impostors are out in the City asking for
money and goods for the striking painters.
Mr. Bean of the relief and financial com
mittee said that he wants the public to
know that the only ones authorized to
make I collections nave â¢ their credentials
bearing the seal of the Painters' Union. '
, A painter who arrived in the morning
from Portland, Or., reported that the San
Francisco bosses are advertising; in the
Portland papers for journeymen to work
in San Francisco. The water-front commit
tee was instructed to watch all $of the in
coming boats and trains and capture all
incoming painters possible.
A letter of sympathy and a set of reso
lutions were received from the American
Railway. Union No. 345, in which the
writer said : "I am fully aware that sym
pathy don't fill stomachs worth a cent, but
as you ; are aware â  most of our members
have been on the 'hog train' for nearly two
years on account ;of a : small strike in '94,
so we are not flush : and can't vote any
thing from an empty treasury. JBe assured
when we meet next' we will pass the hat
and . send you results. ; With a : heartfelt
wish lor a successful ' termination of your
strike we remain," etc. A vote of thanks
was returned to the A. R. E.
IT POSTPONES WORK.
Master Painters Say the Trade Will
b Be Crowded Into the Fall
/â  â  Season.
E. H. Black, president of the Master
Painters' Association, speaking of the
strike - situation, yesterday, , said : "It is
unfortunate/and is causing us to postpone
much work that we should be doing no wb
It will probably crowd the spring" work
into the fall. Still, we are not worrying.'
You can head the master painters' end of
the story, ; 'All. is quiet along the Po
tomac.' Property-owners are all i willing 1
to, postpone; the work until a set
tlement-is effected. There, is, not much
work ;to do, anyhow;* The painters could
not have taken a more i unfortunate time
tor themselves to inaugurate the strike." r

MONSIGNOR NUGENT HERE
The Founder of the League of
the Cross Arrives in
This City.
HIS GREAT WORK IN ENGLAND.
Owns and Edits the Largest Catholic
Paper Publishedâ A Man of
the Time.
Mgr. Nugent, the celebrated English
priest, lecturer and writer, arrived in this
City last . night > from Los Angeles, where
he had been staying for a brief while in
his trip round the United States. He
came here with his grace, Archbishop
Riordan and Rev. Peter C. Yorke, who
met him in Southern California. While
in San Francisco Mgr. Nugent will be the
guest of the Archbishop at 1122 Eddy
street. '
The distinguished visitor has kept
abreast of the foremost men in social re
form movements : for more than thirty
years. In the cause of temperance it may
well be said he has been a leader for over a
quarter of a century. At the same time
be founded and published the Liverpool
Catholic Times, which is ; to-day the most
extensively .circulated and most influen
tial Catholic paper printed in the English
language, if not, indeed, the leading Cath
olic newspaper in the world.
The destitute and homeless lads of Liv
erpool also engaged his attention, while a
large part of his work was . among . the
prisoners of that city. Father Nugent has
reached his seventy-fourth year, but ap
pears very much younger, though his long,
flowing, white hair gives him a venerable
look. ' ' "..."'.
. The journey had . not caused him the
least fatigue, and he was only too willing
to speak about his work last night shortly
after his arrival. , .
The League of he Cross, that great Cath
olic temperance organization, was men
tioned .to the Monsignor, who was its
founder. <*, - â¢ -
"The first establishment of the League
of the Cross," he said, "took place Febru
ary 29,1872, in Liverpool. j I had felt for a
long â¢ time the :: necessity of r : some effort
being made to lift our people out of the
intemperate habits into which they had
fallen. I had been chaplain j of, the^ Liver
pool prison for over eight years, and I had
long before become convinced * that drink
was the prolific cause of crime. j That was
my experience f in ; tbe â  prison, which was
one of the largest in England: \â 7 , ."
"I established in 1864 a temperance soci
ety, in which the members promised not to
enter public i houses (saloons) on Saturday
afternoons, Sundays or ; Mondays.^ Expe
rience, however, taught me that this was
not equal to remedy the evil. I had known
Father ; Mathew <in my boyhood, and also
after I bad become a priest. ; I determined
in 1872 vto lift up the standard of Father
Mathew; having been convinced that noth
ing less than total abstinence would vbe
effectual. " â¢*

! created in favor of total abstinence I wrote
to Father Lockhart of London 'and askea
him to inaugurate the same movement in
London. He consulted the late Cardinal
Manning upon the matter, who at once
persuaded him to take up the work, and
this was the beginning of the revival in
London.
"In 1873 the Cardinal placed himself at
the head: of the movement, and from his
position and influence, the League of the
Cross soon spread throughout the country.
Branches were established in the great
Catholic centers throughout England. In
1878 the League of the Cross found a home
in Cork. Ireland. Conventions were held
in London, Manchester, Newcastle-on-
Tyne, Thurles and Cork. The league has
gone all over the world. It is very strong
in Glasgow, where almost every parish has
a branch. 'i^^^^^j^^^^^gSS^j^B^
"It has created among our people a pub
lic opinion in favor of total abstinence,
and had lifted thousands out , of their
vicious habits." . â¢
Monsignor Nugent remarked that he
was 50 years of a^e before he took up the
work in this line. r He did not feel he. could
do much for temperance, â ; or total 'j ab
stinence before, for the reason he was ac
customed, through - living, in Italy and
France when a young man; to drink wine
at dinner. At 50, however, he burst
through the . habit of a lifetime ; that he
might enter heart and soul into the move
ment for abstinence.
And now he can claim to have admin
istered more i pledges of , total ; abstinence
than any other man since Father Mathew.
Quite frequently he pledged at one meet
ing fully 1000 persons.
b As a publisher and editor Monsignor
Nugent is one of the most successful men
of the time. . He is 5 the ' founder and pro
prietor of the Catholic Times, y.
"The Times," he said, "has a circulation
of over 50,000 copies. ' : It is a weekly paper
ished in Liverpool and London, and
esides T have branch offices in Dublin
and Manchester. I founded it in 1862, and
now it has the largest circulation of any
Catholic paper jin the ; world. To-morrow
(Sunday) three reporters will go out of the
office in* Liverpool i for i news among; the
churches, four will visit the > churches in
London, two in Manchester and one in
Dublin. ' . :
'%' "I have an office with : thirty printers
constantly at work. As for myself, I don't

' "My chief work, ; : however, . has been .in

and outside that in temperance and among
the boys." 'â¢-."".'
"What .is .the - history of your labors
among the poor lads of Liverpool?"
: â  "In 1864 I established the Boys' Refuge
in Liverpool. There are 240? boys in the
institution, who' are | educated and taught
trades by which they can earn a livelihood.
They remain till ; about 15; and then tbey
are given j employment. ;, One of the chief
trades is printing, as there is fat very large
steam Drifting works at the Refuge. >, ;;. : .

and are now filling positions with credit to
themselves in various walks of life.
:.b ''Web have bin., Liverpool 'â¢; a parochial

of Notre ; Dame, who have 15,000 children
in their care each day. The Government
pays on results, and as our schools arc sec-"
ond to none we are satisfied. We have
compulsory education, and we find that it
works satisfactorily. It is all the same
throughout England." .
, Mgr. Nugent is traveling for rest and
change, as his doctors advised him to dis
continue work last year.
"I came to San "Francisco to pay the

FESTIVE HOODLUMS.
People Who Suffered From Being Hit
With Apples and -Oranges.
Some of the members of a club who were
enjoying a dinner at a restaurant on O'Far
rell street last evening indulged in the
practice of hurling apples and oranges at
pedestrian? who were passing on tbe street
immediately under the dining-room. Sev
eral ladies were struck in the head and
face with oranges, and one young man bad
an eye closed, the result of being hit with
an : apple, The policeman on the beat was
informed of the fact, and he found on. in-;
spection that all the banqueters were very
hilarious, but he did; not neglect to repri
mand them for their conduct; and threat
ened to 'arrest the first person he found
throwing anything from the window.
This, however, was poor consolation for
those who suffered from the in juries sus- i
tamed. .

FELL FIVE STORIES.
Terrible Accident to a Child in th c
Lombardo Hotelâ Almost
Instantaneous.
Joseph Grannucci, a bright little boy 3
years and 6 months of age, met almost in
stant death last Friday evening from the
result of a fall from the fifth, story of the
Lombardo Hotel, at 249 Pacific street.
The child's mother was washing on the
porch of the fifth story and the child was
playing by. her side with several other
children. The mother went into the hotel
after some water and left the child on the
porch. When she returned he had disap
peared, and the r stationary washstand
near the railing that surrounds the porch,
which was open "when she went into the
house, was closed. She looked for the
child but was unable to find him.
Peter Bright, aged 12, who had ; been
playing with the deceased on the porch,
told the distracted mother that he had
; last seen his playmate on the stationary
washstand, and on looking down into the
yard, five stories below, she saw her un
conscious babe lying on his back. A physi
cian was immediately summoned and he
pronounced the child's injuries fatal.
PHe would probably have been kiiled in
stantly but that he fell on a large pile of
cabbages in the yard. The fall was also
partly broken by the chila's striking a
washline in his descent. Deputy Coroner
McCormick investigated the case and is
satisfied that it was purely accidental, but
the parents of the deceased have not yet
waived an inqnest.

I Contract Let for Steel Work
of the New "Call
. Building.
TWO THOUSAND TONS.
Claus Spreckels Prefers to Pat
ronize the Home Manu
factories.
THE PACIFIC ROLLING MILLS.
Scores of Men Will Be Kept Busy
for Months Turning Out the
Great Girders.
A contract for over 2000 tons of steel
beams and girders was let yesterday to
the Pacific Rolling-mills. This is by far the
largest contract for steel work ever let in
this City or on this coast.
It will be used in the superstructure of
the largest steel building on the coast, and
one of the largest steel-framed buildings
in the worldâ the new Call building.
The closing of this contract means a
good deal to San Francisco, particularly
to the iron and steel workmen. In exact
figures the contract calls for 2200 tons of
steel. The manufacturing of this quantity
of steel will keep the rolling-mills running
full force for the rest of the year it is ex
pected.
In the letting of this contract Claus
Spreckels has only followed out the char
acteristic policy adopted by him in the
construction of all his other buildings â
that of patronizing home industry wher
ever possible. In order to carry out this
policy Mr. Spreckels instructed Reid
Brothers, the architects of The- Call's
magnificent new home, to design the
shapes of the steel beams and girders
needed in such a way as to meet the re
i auirements of the home mills and permit
the work to be done in this City. In the
buildings previously erected by Claus
Spreckels this was, comparatively speak
ing, not such a difficult thing to do. In
the case of this gigantic nineteen-storied
strnctuie with its knotty problems in en
gineering, wind resistence, weight distri
bution and the still more complex archi
tectural problems that may scarcely be
stated in non-technical terms, it was no
easy task to design the shapes instead of
permitting the ordinary shapes to guide
the construction.
But the task has been accomplished, and
if builders and architects were inclined to
pay more attention to the limitations and
peculiarities of the local factories a great
deal of material heretofore supposed to be
only practicable when produced abroad
can be purchased in this City, thus giving
work to a great many more men.
The accompanying illustration is an out
line of steel work in the plan and eleva
tion as taken from" the architect's draw
ings, There is a bewildering maze of steel
beams and girders here, yet the problem
presented in this great network of heavy
metal was by no means as great a task as
that presented by the necessity of securing
for this nineteen stories of steel and stone
a sure and solid foundation.
There was a deal of preparatory work
necessary for a building of this magnitude,
and most of this preparatory work is now
completed. First of all, at a distance of
twenty-five feet below the level of the
street a platform of concrete two feet
thick was spread over the entire surface to
be occupied by the building and project
ing nine feet beyond this area at all four
sides. This projection was necessary in
order to prevent the great weight of the
superstructure from bearing with undue
pressure on the sand beneath the founda
tion.
On this flat and perfectly level surface of
concrete were laid course* of fifteen-inch
steel beams, spaced at an average of seven
teen inches apart. This space between the
beams was carefully filled in with con
crete. On top of this surface of concrete
and beams, at right angles to the beams,
the work of laying still another row of |
fifteen-inch beams is now progressing, j
When these beams have been placed and
the abutting pieces firmly riveted so that
each makes a continuous girder from one
side of the foundation to the other, the
spaces between. them will also be ' filled
with concrete.
Again, at right angles with these beams
and directly under, the center of each of
the eighteen columns will be . placed the
bases. These bases will be formed of
20-inch steel beams, firmly riveted together,
and. the spaces between them filled with
concrete. On these solid foundations will
be placed the , true columns, the â¢ bases of
which will be made of cast iron of 3000"
pounds weight each. Upon these column
bases will rest the great columns them
selves; each of which will support a burden
of GOO tons. *
All this preparatory work has been so
carefully planned that, with the help of
the projecting nine feet of foundation, the
great load which each column will be re
quired to support will be carried gradually
downward in such a manner that no single
square foot of the underlying sand will be
loaded to a greater extent than the weight
of two and a quarter tons. ,
In less than a month all this preparation
work will be completed and the building
of the superstructure will commence. It
will require about two weeks to erect the
framework of the first or main story, and
after that the great towering structure will
proceed skyward at the rate of one story
a week, and the entire superstructure will
be finished by the middle of October.

adoption on Saturday, March 14, of the fol
lowing resolution:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this commit'
tee that the delegates to the State Convention
lor the purpose of selecting delegates to tin'
National Convention be appointed, and that
the appointments be, made by aud the respon.
sibiiuv rest upon the committeeman from each
Assembly district, and each appointment must
be ratified by this committee.
A motion by 8. K. Thornton, â  seconded
by Long, that :â  the report be â¢; ratified/
brought the, matter squarely before the
committee. George P. Morrow said that
several gentlemen from; Alameda County
wanted to address the committee, and ft
general invitation was extended to such
people. ' ; r â¢
W. A. Dow began the protest, which was
heard with bland consideration, while UnÂ«
cle Eli rubbed his; nose with perfect self
possession. .. -'â¢'â¢â¢''. ."-"..â 'â ) 'â ';J'^ ';
"Since it has been stated that there is to
be no primary election Â- in Alameda
County,", said Dow; h beginning his brief
and temperate address,: "there has. been
much i dissatisfaction. What was once,
Jierhaps, a custom, is now considered a po
itical right." ;
He told of the Thursday-night mass
meeting, read ; the resolutions adopted
there and stated that there \ had been sev
eral ward meetings expressive of the same
sentiment. - :-"â >â 
J. T. Bell said that ; the proposition he
was helping oppose was contrary to tho
traditions :of the - party.':: The ;, party was
entering on an era of prosperity and power
and there was no greater question before
the people : than '-. the privilege of ; saying
who should be their President.
' P. M. Fisher spoke strongly and at some
length. . ' ,
'. ' "It has been asserted,", he began, "that
one. or two ; people have i got up all this
trouble in Oakland. -While I called that
mass-meeting; I â 'â¢ acted only i in 'harmony
with public sentiment. That was a digni
fied and temperate meeting, and its whole
temper; and tenor hammered away at the
one proposition,' ' Give the people a chance.'
I wish to urge this committee* to disregard
pressure in individuals and go closer to the
people. Let the rank and file of this intel
ligent p^rty vote." ' -â¢ : .
; A question by Chairman Taylor started
ventilation of : the possibility of the Con
gressional conventions ; deciding 1 ' to nomib
! hate Congressmen when they got together
I at Sacramento May 5, an \ idea that was
made much of at the mass-meeting as an
other reason why six men' should hot act
for all Alameda County.
,; Morrison asked f Fisher to read the sec
tion of the call issued by. the State Central
Committee which was said to contain this
possibility. The section 1 , was: read i as \ fol
lows: " -- v â¢ â¢ ; :: - .- " 'â¢ -"'-â¢- :.'.;
b : It -Is further - directed that - the delegates
chosen to the Congressional conventions shall
meet in State convention at the city; of Sacra
mento on Tuesday, the sth day ; of May, ' 1890,
at 2 p.m., 7 to -select four delegates at large to
the National Republican Convention and four
alternate delegates to act in ease the delegates
selected be absent, and for the transaction of
such other and * further Â business as may be
brought before said State Convention. V
"It has; seemed to me that the mass
meeting was called under a misapprehen
sion of what the convention may do," said
Taylor.
. i Fisher said that it was a member of the
Congressional committee ;â  who . had first
pointed out to him that possibility. b.
Thornton couldn't see how any intelli
gent person could draw such an inference
from the call. -
. Morrow here flashed up. a practically
new idea by asking Fisher if a better ex
pression of the will of the people could not
i be secured from the Republican clubs than
at an open primary. There developed the
intimation that the committeemen might
consult the clubs in making appointments.
, Mackay of Alameda rose to say that the
main question was not, "Will the conven
tion nominate Congressmen?" but the
right of electors to choose delegates who
nominate their officers. It had been said
that this convention was to "only" choose
delegates to nominate a President. He
urged the committee : to "get its second
wind" and provide for primaries.
f Matthews of the Army and Navy League
of Oakland reported the meeting and pro
testing resolutions of that organization,
and be made an appeal for primaries.
S. K. Thornton of Oakland, represent
ing Glenn County, said that he was an old
Republican who never kicked, over the
traces; that he thought the selection of
delegates should be left with the commit
tee, and that a better representation could
be secured from Republican clubs' than
from a primary. The idea that the con
ventions could nominate Congressmen
under the call was preposterous, he said.
â : Wells of Contra Costa said that he would
favor anything tbe Alameda County dele
gation adopted. ; Nearly, all the country
members seemed to want to keep out of
the Alameda fight. ..â¢â .;
,; Powell, , representing -Jones of Colusa,
read ; a letter from Jones. favoring prim
aries in ail the counties.
; Pond of , Yolo said that he did not pro
pose to take any hand; in Alameda
County's fight, and he believed , that . mat
ters should be left to : the committeemen
from the various counties.
The talking was; over, and Cbairman
Taylor called the ayes and noes on the
motion to ratify, the report from Alameda
County. Three weak ayes were heard
two from somewhere in the neighborhood
of Eli Denison,' and Powell alone voted no.
The motion was declared carried.
Then the reports from other counties
were approved in short . order, without
debate. , ... Â â '.
Wells reported that . in Contra ' Costa
there would be a primary run by the
County Committee. ; â¢ - ' ; . .
Hockeimer reported that the committee
man from Glenn would appoint.
.. Lake being unrepresented was left to the
committeeman (Read) with power to act.
In Solano the' selection of delegates is
left to the County Committee.
Pond of Yolo* reported "the people of
our county will hold a primary." [Applause
from the Oakland citizens.]
Powell "said he had no definite report
from Jones of Colusa and things wereleft
to Jones of Colusa with power to act.
The matter of drafting a call came up
and was left with the committee appointed
for that purpose at the previous meeting.
, There was inquiry about the number of
delegates, but nothing definite resulted. -
At the previous meeting it had been or
dered that delegates should be selected by
primary or otherwise on April 25. On mo
tion of Wells this order was amended by
providing that counties should select dele
gates when they pleased, returns to reach
the Congressional committee by April 25.
The committee adjourned to meet at the
call of the chair.
"I do not like to express an opinion off
hand and so soon," said P. . M. Fisher a
few moments after adjournment, "but
there is no question that profound dissatis
faction will result from the action taken
here to-day. - It has been suggested here
that the committeemen would probably
leave the choice to the Republican clubs.
That would be a compromise that would
mollify somewhat the objectors, though
they insist on the principle of the absolute
right of the voters to select the delegates.
But in some wards there- are no clubs. If
in these two or three clubs are organized
which is to be recognized? You see the
chance for more confusion."

Republicans Who Demand Pri

I ' OAKLAND, Cat,., March When the
decision of the Third District Congres

primaries.
There will be a council of those who
favor primaries held next week, to decide
on what course shall be taken. There are
still many ward club, leaders who demand
primaries, and declare that they will hold
them and carry the fignt for the seating of

A POLICEMAN SUSPENDED
William Gilheaney, Who Terror
:-'. ized the Women on Berry
Street.
For Â«the Past Six Weeks His Conduct
Has Made Them . Imagine j He
Was the Strangler.
For the past six weeks complaints have
been made ,to. ; the . police by women on
Berry street that a man representing him
self as a police officer had been terrorizing
â them.
* The man would â  stare through the win-;
dow at the woman, and if she was pretty
he would open the door and walk in. To
her astonishment he would brusquely say,
as he threw back his coat and displayed a
start. "Yon see, I'm a police officer. I've
been watching you for a long time. I
Want you to come with me to the police
station."
He would stand beside the terrified
woman while she put on her street cos- '
tume, After she was ready to leave he ;
would say : ' 'Well,? I won't arrest you i
this time, but will give you another
chance ," and coolly walk out.
'He did not o^ar them any violence nor!
demand any money, but his peculiar con- j
duet kept the women in a state of terror* |.
as they \ had the â¢ strangler constantly in
their minds ; and they did not know but
that he 'might be masquerading as a
police officer. . â¢ . '
v The ; sergeants -in the ; district were in- '
structed to notify their men to keep a
sharp lookout for the man. Last night
while Policeman Sylvester was patrolling
Horry street a woman, who had been fol
lowing a man, pointed him out to Sylves
ter as the peculiar visitor. : He had just
left another woman. ,
. Sylvester placed the man under arrest
and -took . film j to the California-street I
station, where he was recognized as Police
man William Gilheaney. ; â¢ ' 'â¢'â ".-â >;.'
The sergeant in ohargo ordered Sylves
ter to take ' him to poiece headquarters,
and Captain Lees, who is, acting as Chief
in the absence of Chief Crowley, who is in
San Jose, ' ordered Gilheaney to give up
hie star and suspended him. He will ap
pear before the Police Commissioners. on
Wednesday; night. Several of the. women
on Berry street will be called as witnesses.
.Gilheaney was appointed on the force on
November "25, 1895. After doing special
duty for a short time be was assigned to
the beat on Oak street. He soon distin
guished himself by arresting a man as a
common-drunk, although he had never
seen him drunk, and, by arresting two
boys for disturbing the peace who were
playing a game of "tag" on the street.

NAGLE MAKES DENIAL.
Says He Read the Verdict to Mr.

Telegram.
OPPONENTS OF BROWN WORK-
Over One Hundred Names Secured in
One Dayâ The Pastor Hears From
Miss Overman.
Dr. Charles Oliver Brown, contrary to
his vehement declaration not to again oc
cupy the pulpit until his name had been
cleared of every vestige of suspicion, will
preach at the First Congregational Church
to-day. The subject for the morning dis
course is "I know that my Redeemer
liveth." . â¢
Pastor Brown's reappearance in the pul
pit is an event in Pacific Coast Congrega
tionalism, and regardless of what may
come after will always be.so considered.
The man who has been found guilty of
nnministerial conduct, ; and : whose word
has been brought under the shadow of
suspicion, if nothing more, will talk to his
followers and. the curious-minded of the
meek and lowly Nazarene.
Pastor Brown's utterances will be made
from a rostrum, heavily laden with em
blems of purityâ white violets, hy
acinths and roses, whose sweet perfumes
permeate every nook of the vast audi
torium, and whose odors will probably
mellow any harsh words which might fall
from the lips of the speaker.
Dr. Brown's feminine friends, particu
larly those who sat within the charmed
circle during the sessions of the council,
have made a , magnificent' display. To
many of them the occasion would fail of
its purpose did not the pastor speak his
first words from a bower of whiteness.
These lady admirers, some twenty or
thirty in number, spent all yesterday in
preparing this offering, and when Dr.
Brown enters the pulpit to-day if a great
streak of white goodness does not tempor
arily rush through his frame his friends
cannot but feel disappointed..
Mrs. Rogers acted as general superin
tendent of decorations, ably assisted, how
ever." by her daughter, Miss Ruby, Miss
Blake, Mr. and Mrs. Jacques, Miss Jacques,
Mrs. Taggart, Mrs. Mac Davis, Mr. Wil
liams and Deacon Morse. Of course, there
was much more material for decorations
than could be easily handled, but .by per
sistent work the faithful few managed to
transform the bare altar and chancel into
a garden of living, growing calla lilies,
hyacinths, white violets and smilax, con
spicuously relieved by tall wavy palms
and wreaths built of evergreen.
The only thing needful to complete Dr.
Brown's new appearance was a dove the
emblem of innocence. The doveâ a pure
white article, delicately stuffedâ on
hand, but it was finally determined that
the pastor could get along without this
additional evidence of faith. So the white
feathered inanimate, traditional token of
innocence was" carried home by the
owner, Miss Rogers.
The opponents of Dr. Brown are not
losing any time in the matter of ousting
him from the ' pastorate of the First
Congregational Church. Yesterday they
circulated the following petition
To the deacons and standing committee of the
church and trustees of the society of the First
Congregational Church of San Francisco: We,
the undersigned members of the First Con
gregational Church of San Francisco, respect
fully represent that, in our judgment, Rev. C.
O. Brown, D. D., has ceased to be efficient or
acceptable as pastor of the church, and that
the best interests of the church and of the
cause of Christ require his retirement from
that position. We, therefore, earnestly call
upon you to request his immediate resignation.
This petition was industriously circu
lated, and by 7, o'clock last night 104
names had been secured. It is the pur
pose of those having the matter in chaige
to make an individual canvass of every
member of the church, including b Dr.:
Brown's friends, so that they may know
just what force the pastor has to back the
claim that he is supported by the ma
jority.
' The most active workers injthe "crusade
for righteousness," as it is termed by them,
are Mrs. Cooper, Miss Hattie Cooper, Mrs.
Dutton, Mr. and Mrs. McDonald, Deacon
Barnard and Deacon Hatch. Ex- Judge-
Advocate Woodhams is also said to have a
petition, but he is working on the outside,
where it is not likely to come to.thejknowl
edge of Dr. Brown or his friends. / /
Attorney Nagle has prepared a statement
concerning the imposition practiced on the
United Press representative by Dr. Brown.
It reads:
At the suggestion of J. V. Kimball he, Attor
ney Nagle and Dr. Brown went to the repre
sentative of the United Press ; immediately
after reading the findings of the council. His
office is In The Call editorial-rooms. 1 'â 
We went there to give a correct statement of
the findings, so that no mistake would be made.
Mr. Nagle forthwith upon? arrival 'read Â£ the
official statement of the council to Mr. Fraser,
Including the censure and the words follow
ing, namely: "While we gladly recognize the
kindly and manly words of appreciation and
. reparation offered by him." : This was com
â  mented upon by Dr. Brown, Mr. Nagle and Mr.
Kimball. During the reading of the findings
Mr. Fraser had that document before him, and
:he read ;it with Mr. Nagle. Mr. Fraser asked
for the; document, but upon being informed
that it was Dr. Brown's only copy asked to be
permitted to make a synopsis of it, which was
granted. Mr. I Fraser then asked Dr. Brown .;
what he would like , in the dispatch, and put
his j typewriter ;in position^ As he was , doing
this Mr. Drury appeared ; and * offered f his con
gratulations and engaged Dr. Brown In con
versation. Mr. Nagle meanwhile went forward
with I the ' suggestion â  to Mr. . Fraser. of '. what
would be proper for > the message.' : Mr. Drury
then asked Dr. Brown ; to go with him for an
interview" with Mr. MacMullcn, which Dr.
Brown declined. Thereupon Mr. Drujry said:
"I will go and have Mr. MacMullen come up
- ? aere^^f^^^aPBESSBBBBPPQBBQHBSaQBiW
A young employe of the office then appeared
and ottered bis congratulations .' and -i engaged
Dr. Brown in conversation. During all of this
time Mr. Nagle went forward with Mr. /. Fraser .
in the work of the message, and reading a' part
of it from the "finding." After the young em
ploye '" left / Dr. Brown . then J turned Jto i hear
what had been written. Mr. Fraser took the
sheets from the typewriter and had read only
two sentences which Dr. Brown* heard, when
Mr. Drury reappeared accompanied by Mr. Mul- 1
let. i Mr. Drury called Dr. Brown's attention and
the' three J immediately engaged \in conversa
tion on the result of . the council, Mr. MacMul
len offering his congratulations. Mr. Fraser
then looked up as if he were astonished that
Dr. Brown > gave no 1 more attention ;, to the j
important matter of the message, and i waited j
a few seconds for < bis further attention which,
not receiving, he added a sentence " and then j
read : , the whole to Mr. '; Nagle. ? Mr. V Kimball |
then reminded Dr. Brown that it was (time to j
go to the Associated Press office and asked him I
if he didn't want to read what had been pre
pared. Dr. ':â  Brown ; said "Oh, ; no ; j anything |
that Mr. Nagle has said is ball right." There
upon we withdrew and met Mr. Morse at the
Associated Press office. He having . a copy of
the "findings" we were able to â¢ leave a copy
with them. / â¢
We all agreed that upon the various charges j
of which the public knew anything the report j
was an acquittal. We did not think that the ,
council could express as it does its "hope that
In consequence his future years may be i more i
fruitful than any -in the : past," unless they j
meant to exonerate him from the ; serious
charges which they were callec on to Investi
gate. ... , ;^V r ,'"
At the Associated Press, rooms the conversa* i
tion was with the night manager, Mr. Paul I
Cowles, who the next day as soon as he saw |
the false statements with reference ;to the ;
alleged attempt to deceive him, telephoned
Dr. Brown, saying that he (Mr. Cowles) was not j
in the least responsible for the misrepresenta
tions, and asking that any person making such
statements be referred to him. Mr. Cowles has !
since written Dr. Brown the following letter as i
to what occurred jin i his office. / Dr. Brown's j
recollection is that \in answer to Mr. Cowles' i
question he said "acquittal," rather than "vin-. |
dication," but Mr. Cowles has of course given
it as he remembers the conversation:
San Francisco, March 21, 1896.
Rev. C. 0. Brownâ Dear. Sir: Â I notice in sev- J
eral newspapers the statement that you at
tempted to deceive the Associated Press with j
regard to the findings of the Congregational .
council.
I wish to state that not only did you not at- ;
tempt to deceive the Associated Press, but that
your attorney, Mr. Nagle, went over the report j
with me and pointed out the vital parts of the ;
verdict After the reading aloud of the docu- '.
ment you said: "I consider that a complete
vindication on the main charges." Mr. Nagle
also made the same statement.
My attention was called - particularly to the
verdict of censure, and you then . explained
that in your judgment the council had no
right to take up that matter, as the alleged in
timidation had occurred after the council had
been called. At my request you wrote out a
statement commenting on that part of the re
port referring to the payment of money to
Mrs. Davidson.'.
There was no attempt to deceive the Asso
ciated Press in any way, and the report itself
was given the same publicity as your criticism
of it that the public might form its own opin
ion of the matter. â¢ Yours truly,
Paul Cowles, Night Manager.
The above statement, including Mr. Cowles
letter, recites as nearly as we can recall ex
actly what occurred at both press dispatch
offices. J. V. Kimball,
Chas. G. Nagle,
Chas. 0. Brown.
MR. FRASER SPEAKS.
He Disputes the Statements. Made
by Dr. Brown and His Com
panions.
Mr. Fraser was shown the statement of
Brown, Nagle and Kimball, and immedi
ately prepared the following affidavit:
Referring to the statement of Dr. Brown and i
Messrs. Nagle and Kimball:
The three gentlemen called upon me on the
night of Tuesday, March 17. Dr. Brown was
introduced by Mr. Kimball. His (the doctor's)
opening remark was: "I want you to tell the
American public that Dr. Brown has, by a
unanimous verdict of â¢ the council, been ac
quitted of every charge. The verdict is a com
plete vindication." These were the doctor's
exact words . and my story was built upon
them.
The statement of i the three gentlemen says: j
"Mr.: Nagle forthwith upon ; arrival read the
official statement of the council to Mr. Fraser, ;
including the censure and the words follow- j
ing, namely: "While we gladly recognize the |
kindly and manly words of appreciation and
reparation offered by him."
This is a. deliberate falsehood. Mr. Nagle
never/read me tie complete findings of the
council. The only portion of the same i
which he did read was as follows: Ques
tions a and 6â "Did Rev. C. O. Brown,
D.D., commit adultery with either Mrs. M. A.
Stockton or Miss Overman?" and "Has he been
guilty of. any conduct seriously affecting his,
ministerial character?" "Second â Touching I
the first of these two questions, we are able to j
make answer that the evidence before us does \
hot sustain the charge of adultery with either !
Mrs. Stockton or Miss Overman."
Dr. Brown interrupted at this stage and
asked me if I did not think that adultery was
what the public were looking for? I agreed
with him that this was the most serious charge
involved, and I congratulated ; him upon the
; finding on this point. i:^&$&&B&&
Mr. Nagle then ' continued the reading:
"Thirdâ That touching the question of unmin
isteriai conduct we find in Dr. Brown certain
constitutional Infirmities of temper, in the
light of which his actions must be judged, and
which to some extent modify opinions of his
conduct." â  / b .'â .!'
Dr. Brown again interrupted and made some
remark about his infirmity of temper, and then'
asked Mr. Nagle to read the conclusion of the '
verdict beginning with the words "it is our j
hope and prayer," etc.
1 wish to call attention to the fact that the en- i
tire portion of the verdict from the end. of the I
first . sentence in ' the paragraph - beginning :
"Third" down to the paragraph beginning "It |
is our hope and prayer", were adroitly omitted
by Mr. Nagle, even to the first sentence of the
paragraph reading. "While we have been com
pelled to . condemn the acts now specified in
our brother's conduct."
During the reading of the selected portions
of the ;. verdict by. Mr. Nagle, Dr. ; Brown
listened intently, and was fully cognizant of
what was going , on. . I . then took ;my / type-,
writer out, , and . asked ; the doctorâ , Mr.
Nagleâ what he wished me , to say. He then
repeated the remark which be made upon first
entering the < room, and I wrote my story, re-/
peating It word J for word as, I did so. Dr.
Brown looked over my shoulder during the
whole performance. When , the â  first : para
graph of the story bad been concluded, I asked
the doctor what comment he had to offer upon
the verdict, and if -he was J perfectly satisfied
with the * same. He ' replied: "You may say
that Dr. Brown is perfectly s satisfied with the
finding of the council."
Then I added: "And you think they could
have gone no -\ farther .in. vindicating you
I than / they did?" ' At , /this J moment : Dr.
i Brown's attention was distracted for a second.
i When he caught ,my i eye again Mr. Nagle * re
j peated my question to him, and he concluded
I the sentence by saying: "No; they could not
| have gone any farther in vindicating me than
I they did."/ b-bbbb-T'.'' '/./b b'-^-/.
--// then suggested the reference to Mrs. David
i son's case," Dr. Brown explaining that the coun
cil had misconstrued his motive in paying her
the $500. Having /received * Dr. Brown's \ and

Frank L. Perkins, employed in The Call
j editorial rooms as; stenographer, makes a
| statement; corroborating % Mr. Fraser in
every detail. He says: <â¢

Immediately after the arrival of Dr. Brown
I at the editorial rooms I had . occasion â¢. to s pass
j through the telegraph-room and was surprised
I to see Dr. Brown standing at Mr. Fraser's desk
j In company with two other gentlemen. v His
I rather excited appearance and the emphatic
j manner of his speech attracted my attention,
and I halted, thinking that he had taken the
telegraphic editor to task for something j that
l had been sent East concerning his' connection
j with some jof the women '; who ; figure in the
investigation of the , council. But a sentence
from his lips dispelled this illusion. In a voice
| that trembled with emotion he atated: "It is
a complete vindication; 1 have been acquitted
jon every charge."?" ; 'â 'â¢â â¢â *â¢": /. - J:S l ";.'.". .â ''â ''â¢â '
: I stepped â  forward and glanced .: over - the
I shoulder of Dr. Brown at a roll of . manuscript
; that the gentleman, who j stood . next to Dr.
Brown was handling. I . have since learned
that this" gentleman was Mr. Nagle. '/As he
rapidly interchanged the sheets ihe and Dr.
Brown kept up. a running fire â of words with
Fraser, who nodded assent as they: spoke. I
paid no . particular attention to the words of
Mr. Nagle because I did not know him, and re
garded the doctor as the principal figure.
. As the doctor and Mr. Nagle read they would
make remarks upon the extracts quoted. "As
you will see." said the doctor at the end of a
quotation, "this . completely vindicates me of
all guilt in the matter." ' r '.
When he read what the council had to say
about his infirmities of temper, he added: "I
know that 1 1 am the possessor cf a very nasty
temper and I am very sorry for it," or words
similar to these. ...
Just at this juncture Mr. Drury came in and
had a short talk with the reverend gentleman.
I heard none of this, for it was in the nature of
a private conversation, and I moved out of
hearing. .." â¢ > /â¢;':.â¢
As soon as Mr. Drury left the room Dr. Brown
stood a ! moment irresolute. | I addressed him
and said: "Well, you feel as if a burden were
off your mind now/do you not. doctor?"/
His answer was: "Yes, 1 do. No man ever
won a fight with the odds so against him as I
have."- I then offered my congratulations and
we had a ; short talk over , the way the news
papers had treated him. He thought they had
hounded him, and I agreed that several of
them had been pretty harsh with him, but
| thought The Call had been fair in its attitude
| toward him. Before" he I had time 'to answer
Mr. Fraser asked him if he did not want to
make an individual statement â  and jhe said :
"Tell the American, public that;! have been
completely acquitted on every charge and that
I am perfectly.; satisfied with ; the verdict."
These are very nearly his own words. =
While I was present Mr. Nagle did not read
the complete findings of the council, nor did
Dr. ' Brown. â¢ They . read only - certain t para
graphs which they seemed to have in mind be
! fore they read them.-
It ; makes no j personal difference to me
j whether the doctor is guilty or not. As a mat-
I ter of fact, however; I have always believed he
was the victim of a conspiracy, and this was
| why I congratulated him when I thought that
he had been vindicated.; When I read in the
papers the next day that the council had virtu
ally condemned him I was | as | surprised as Mr.
Fraser when . he found out that â he had sent
statements to the Eastern papers that had no
foundation in truth. .
Dr. Brown, when asked last night if he
had anything ;, further { to ; say, concerning
the false telegram, replied he had not.
| The reverend gentleman took occasion to
j deny, * with / some bitterness, the ' author
| ship {of the Mayer â¢ letter. Referring ;' to j
j Miss Overman's flight he said : /
r-' "When I returned home that afternoon
I found a note from Miss Overman, saying !
she thought it best to go away. I did not j
advise her to go," but 'as b she is; her own '
mistress there is no reason why her leaving
should excite comment.
. "Miss Overman wrote me a short note on
the train. Later I heard from her at Tia
Juana. Mexico." â 
b "Is that the last time you have heard
from her?" was asked. ;â¢ . b : -
"Well, I : would 1 not care to ' say," an
swered j the . doctor cautiously. "I ; don't
care to discuss that point." . :

j that gentleman's eagerness ; to 1 shoulder it
: all has placed ; both in s unenviable
j light. In ; the ', face of i the ; affidavits ;of

â¢â  .V Particular Attack.
â¢In the course of 'an interview yesterday
Mr. Xagle, after stating > that he ] had read
the ) entire 'â  findings of the â  council to Mr.
Fraser, said: " ". r ;
: "With reference to the young lady, and
the point made ;.' that ith is; council â  had no
right to go into this matter, and the state-*
merit by Dr. Hoyt that Dr.' Brown should
have raised that objection ;.. lon gb before
he did, ; I would state that I personally said
to Dr. Hoyt that the council had 'no right
' to " go i into. that <] question} because '.- it oc
curred long after.the time , that the council
was called, and further â  than that it was
not one of i the > rumors which the council
â was called ;tol investigate. b But- Dr. Hoyt
said to me that this 'council proposed to go
into everything no \ matter v what] it was,
and would not listen to any objection of
that kind. jvl further than that said to Dr.
Hoyt that the action' of â¢ Dr. Brown was
not an intimidation of the young lady, but
an appeal by him to her }to be just toward
him as he had been toward her., .â _-..,
"I want further to say that I would never
have taken so active a* part in that church;
council had it / not = been for Dr. McLean
himself. When we were together in the
railroad ticket office under t the Grand Ho
tel/he spoke to me arid suggested : that I
represent b Dr. Brown band that/ he would
take no advantage over; the accused pastor
as he knew Dr." Brown was a very sick man
and was not able !' physically to undergo
the 'examination and trial of that case.
"Dr. McLean then, when this question of
this young lady came up, after his request
aforesaid, required that I leave the room,
and Dr. Brown was deprived of the counsel
which Dr. McLean said he would/ allow
him, and / that . is the reason why the
question was not raised before the council
at the; time the matter came up. I fully,
intended to raise it and would have raised
it had not Dr. McLean taken advantage of
me / after his agreement with me in 5 the
railroad ticket "office. ;'; I consider that Dr.
McLean ' owes me an apblogv for his con
duct, but 1 do not presume that he will
tender it. *
Â-- "I consider that it was the duty of those ;
councilmen to defend > Dr. Brown as much
as >. it was to persecute i him as they did. ;
They admitted .in i the examination hear
say evidence arid slanders of /the grossest
kind. I/called their attention to it, ob
jected to it and in every way that I could
protested against it. ' They overruled my
objections, and some of them became vexed
when told / that it was incompetent and
should not be admitted, and â  I was told
that the council â¢ had --. heard that class of
evidence previously in the 'proceedings,
and that they would / have to . continue it.
I j replied, 'Because : you have ; committed
one wrong against/ the accused is no rea
son why you 1 should continue <to commit
other wrongs by listening â to hearsay evi
dence,' but Mr. Freeland ; arose and / in his
characteristically abrupt / manner, while
I was speaking, said, 'I ; move that the
council proceed,' and the council pro
ceeded. ' - bb^ ;
'Further than that, I asked these ; gen
tlemen what class of Jaw they intended to
try the doctor byâ whether . by \ the law
taken from the / divine Scriptures which
they teach or by the law prescribing rules
of evidence as laid down in the municipal
law of the land. They could not answer j
me, but told [me to read the Bibleâ that
they did not know what law they would
take ; arid I think they were right. They
did not know, what law they were acting
under. / In < fact* they went under no law
whatever, if they had said they
took the Bible they would have found that
the word that they taught is the founda
tion of all religion and justice, and directly
condemns the / slanderer in the strongest
terms, and the class \of evidence they ad
mited; against the / unfortunate ; minister
would have been excluded.
"It is not ! necessary for me to say that
the .' municipal law of our country con
demns hearsay evidence.
"But if i am right in my conclusion I |
would say that they went to the pagan I
laws, and from Caesar they got the remark j
that a minister should be, like - Caesar's !
wife, 'above suspicion.' "
AN ACTIONABLE LETTER.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper Speaks of the
Charges Brought Against
.Herself.
. Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper has not the least
doubt on the subject of Dr. Brown's hav
ing written the Henry Mayer letter, and
she considers the charges brought against
herself in that document actionable. ;:
"Of : course . his motive .in â â¢ bringing
charges against me was apparent," said
Mrs. Cooper; "it was to disprove anything
I might have said before the council. But
that be should defame that fair young girl
was a crime. - it would ; go hard with Dr.
Brown if he were / compelled :to prove the
charges. When I see women and; men of
the church upholding that man you can
imagine how I feel. It is painful espe
cially to see the way in which women
hang on his words and take his part. A
very large proportion of the people who
have made such violent demonstrations in
his favor during the meetings are people
he himself had brought into the church."
When it was suggested that the First
Congregational Church' was being deco
rated with flowers in Dr. Brown's honor
Mrs. Cooper remarked sadly, "Yes. It
needs fragrance." '
. It is not Mrs. Cooper's intention to
leave the church on account of Dr. Brown's
reinstallation.
â  "He will not be there long, and ; I shall
not hear, him preach. If / Dr. Brown
would stand up like a man, as David did,
and ; say 'I have ; sinned â  and repent' . he
might yet do the best work of : his life, but
j unrepentant he can accomplish nothing."
. Mrs. Cooper considers that was a con
temptible act of cunning for Dr. Brown to
instigate the dispatches declaring that he
was exonerated by the council.

WANTED TO BURN IT.
How the Henry Mayer Letter Came
Near Being Thrown Into/the
Fire.
Rev. Dr. Williams considers it hasty to
give an opinion respecting I the whitewash
ing dispatches which Dr. Brown caused to
be sent East, but he said yesterday,' when
questioned on the / subject, that any one
who felt aggrieved about the dispatches
had a very simple remedy.
"Let such a person "; formulate a charge
and lodge it ; with the committee on cre
dentials of the Bay Conference. t The/sub
ject would then be investigated," he ; said,
and when asked to name his authority for
this assurance, Dr. Williams referred to
article VII, section / 2,"0f I. the - constitution
of the Bay Conference, which reads: , .
"When the standing of a minister
or of a ; church of the conference is
called in question, bit shall /be the
duty of the committee on credentials to
entertain specific charges, from responsi
ble persons, to inquire into the case and
to report to the conference. "
â¢ This article is part of the amended con
stitution of the Bay Conference, which was
adopted ;in May, 1893. / Previous to the
Brown scandal the committee on creden
tials ; for 1895 and 1896 had had absolutely
nothing to do; but as the constitution is
the marching orders of /a -standing com
mittee it is now in order for the committee'
on credentials to investigate the findings
of the council against Dr. Brown and re
port to the Bay Conference! which meets \
early in April. As meetings of the j
committee would ;be private, it :is by no j
means improbable that : the work of in- j
vestigation has already commenced.
â¢ When asked as to the jurisdiction of the
Bay Conference, Dr. Williams said it stood
to the council in the relation of a judge to
a jury. '"â '/' ( .
/ "The findings of the council, reported by
the committee bon credentials, can -be
passed on by, /the Bay Conference," ;he
said. "The conference can inflict suspen
sion or expulsion from the ministry if it
considers chastening is necessary. The !
council had jno power to inflict ; these ;
things." J //'
Dr. - Williams considers that both the !
Valentine letter and the Henry Mayer let- j
ter were written /by the same person, but |
beyond that /he was unwilling yesterday
to advance an opinion. .
' "When the letter was first laid before us
one of the lay members made a motion to |
throw it into the fire, but the. motion was
not seconded. A good committee was ap
pointed to investigate, but -finding there
was no Henry/Mayer they laid that state
ment before ;us without comment. After
that we were satisfied/ that/the letter was
job work arid poorly done, but we had no
jurisdiction to question Dr. Brown on the ,
subject, /and never for a moment enter
tained the idea of doing so."
MR. PAUSON WILL RETIRE.
A Member of Hymns, Panson & Co.
Will Sever His Connection.
The announcement made a few days ago
that Mr. Pauson was to retire from the
firm of ; Hyams, Pauson <fe Co., was in the
nature of ; a surprise to the business world.
The firm is ;an old band well-known one,
and has conducted stores in Portland, Se
attle and San* Francisco for a number of
years past. During their V existence the
house has become identified with the lead
ers in the ; clothing trade fin \ the ; several
cities in which they have done business,
particularly in San rrancisco. y b
-The announcement- made by the firm
that the dissolution V would ..necessitate
holding a sale at which material reduc
tions in prices would be a feature was suffi
cient to throng the store 1 with customers
during the past week. It was realized that
the sale is a genuine dissolution of copart
nership sale, and b hundreds have availed
themselves of the" opportunity, to invest in
clothing at manufacturers' cost. '
â¢ As an ; illustration; of the great cut in
prices that has been made, the manager of
the store stated yesteiday in an interview
that children's suits '. sold formerly at $10
to r $12; are now being sold at $2 65, while
boys' suits and overcoats,*; the former price
of which was $15 to $20, are now selling at
from $7 50 to $10. The interest that has
been aroused in this .sale will no doubt re
main unabated until its termination.

SOME STRONG MEN
The Way In Which They Peso
' Before the Public.
Truth About the Workings of ThÂ« 8Â»
"Men of Muscle."
THERE ARE NOT A : FEW ENTHUSIASTS
1 , who are wrapped up in the feats of the men
"with highly developed muscles who are known
as the -strong men r 'of the world. Those easily
impressed wonder-they admireâ they in fact
worship. But it only needs the most ordinary
industry to develop as the result of inquiry that
the faculty of these "strong men as â¢ stayers .-
is very small. And, indeed, if the truth* were
told, they would most of them -have^.'a;weaK;
back" very suddenly if they were called on to
do an ordinary day's work. Most people know
what that weak back means. -It means a. cer-
tain indication that the individual who has it
is not in good health, it may mean (taken tn
the abstract as a symptom) that one \ is < suffer-
ing from a severe nervous disorder, for s in-
- stance. â¢ But as a rule it means that the system
is "run down," and from this state the most
serious illnesses of which the world has any
record grow. Any one who has any â¢doubt on-
that matter may very â  readily have his ideas
put right by consulting any reputable , man
who has ever suffered from it. Perhaps a
brighter or better example could not be | found
than Mr. George H. = Bent of Rochester, s Cal.
Not long ! ago Mr. "i Bent found himself with a
weak back and a completely shattered system,
and placed i himselfâ he was in imminent
dangerâ in communication with the physicians
of the great HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE.
That was the most sensible thing he could have
done under the circumstance?, of course, and
now that â¢; they have . saved â¢ his life (as he is
abundantly willing to testify) he has written
them a letter of thanks, it is of interest be-
cause; although he has virtually been snatched
from the jaws of death, his back still bothers
him a little, showing how vital is that symptom.
ROCHESTER (Cal.), August 3, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute, ban Francisco,
Cal.â Dear Sirs: .Yours of 24th duly received.
This is here the good feeling comes in, for I
am sure that you like to. hear from patients
who, like myself, are about cured. lam sure 1
like to be able to write in this way, for as I am
now, I think that by the time 'that I get the
medicine taken that I am on now I shan't need
to take any more if you think I will stay this
way. My back does not bother'me hardly, any
now, and I feel better in every way. Yours
very truly, ;"-; GEOR&E H. BENT.
Mr. Bent's letter bears on it the very impres.
sion of truth, and he is like hundreds of other
patients of that grandest of all curative estab-
lishments, the HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE,
in that < he, knowing \ where he has received
great good, is not ashamed or afraid to tell of it.

good now as it is possible for a man to feel." ;
. J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah, writes: "lam

rible disease that I had."
If testimony of this sort does not show-skill
that cannot be surpassed, what on earth can?
No! It does bring conviction to every honest
mind, and as relief is certain it is a truthful
motto that if you are ill at all "THE HUDSON

The Humorist ; : Tells How : Much
Better It Pays to Talk f
; Than to Write. â- :
THE ODD STORY OF HIS RISE.
His Interesting Reminiscences of Bill
Nye and James Whitcomb Riley.
â¢ Never Overworked. j
â 
Robert J. Burdette, the widely known |
humorist and author of several I books, j
who made his reputation on the Burling- |
ton Hawkeye and since then has delivered
funny lectures in all parts of the country,
is at the Occidental. The humorist was
here eight years ago. He has come to
speak on the "Rise and Fall of the Mus
tache," and will address himself to the j
public here on Tuesday night. .Last night j
he spoke in Alameda.
Mr. Burdette is below the medium size
and younger by much than the average
person would suppose from having, in a
general way, followed his career. His
hair, which is rather long, is black, and
his eyes and mustache are of the same
hue.
The humorist is the close friend o
James -. Whitcomb ) Riley; with whom \he
has been associated in times past,' and
was also an admirer of Bill Nye. Unlike
Mr. Nye, however, Burdette says he never
overworked, but on the contrary was lazy,
and so can hardly remember, - even when
doing" the routine work of a daily paper
for years, that he ever got tired. Mr.
Burdette began; doing his first humorous
work on the Peoria Transcript. It at
tracted attention, and Frank Hatton ' of
the Burlington Hawkeye engaged him to
go on that paper and write funny para
graphs. . b/. :
"It was the proudest moment of my
life," said. Mr. Burdette, "when some of
the papers began to say I was the Dan
bury News man of the West. No, when 1
began to lecture I got along all right, too.
But scared? Great Scott! Scared to death.
I could hardly stand up and say anything.
Still, I managed to get along. " I lectured
in halls and schoolhouses throughout
lowa and some of the adjoining States
and usually managed to do very fairly. I
stood in with the committee and we
divided. Sometimes I didn't get more
than would pay expenses, but this was
not frequent. . '
"I remember one night I had [been lec
turing at Noblesville, Ind., and on my way
back I met Whitcomb Riley, who had been
lecturing at a little place near by. 'How
have you done?' he asked me. 'Oh,' I re
plied, 'I got some of the committeemen
and thus had something of a crowd. How
did you. do?' â¢ 'Oh, I held the janitor spell
bound for an hour,' he said. 1 think Riley
is a great humorist and has a way of say
ing things that is calculated to bring hilar
ity to any audience. -. , ;
."Poor Bill Nye died too soon. There was
more good sniff in him than ever came
out. If he had lived he would have done
some great work. But he overworked and
then there was something the matter with
his spine. " He got hurt once a few years
ago in Wisconsin during a cyclone. Bill,
in explaining how it was afterward to some
people who asked him how it occurred,
baid he didn't know; he guessed he stepped
on peal of thunder.
"Nye was very methodical in his writing.
His syndicate letter came out regularly
every week no matter how he felt. He grew
rich, he had a fine residence on Staten Isl
and and another very fine residence at Ashe
vilfe. He ? also had ; ; money in the bank.
"In regard to â  lecturing and writing, it
pays much better to do the former than the
latter. It is an old story that spoken words
are r much more profitable than those that
are written. Dr. Talmage told me a story
recently that well illustrated this. He had
written a careful and as he thought an in
teresting and important article and sent it
to a leading publication, saying .that if a
check for $".'OO was forwarded him he would:
let the publishers have the article. . After
a while it came back with a note from the
publishers saying that while they regretted
it they found the article hardly available.
"Then he sent it to some friends who '
published a weekly paper, and marked the
price down to $100" but word came back in
much the same way. " Then the doctor,
Bent it" to a daily, and offered the whole
thing/big as it was, for $25. But the pro
prietors sent the manuscript back, saying.

v Henry Sparling, a resident of Fruitvale,
.may. 'have to be photographed .by the
cathode process to locate several trouble-,
some - shot that ' were fired into his back
nearly two years ago. y The peculiar man
ner in which the shot were imbedded in
Sparling's back was never told till to-day.
'^Ye were shooting at our camp near
Nile's,** he said, "when an argument arose
as to the penetrating power of birdshot
fired from a distance of a hundred yards.
Another of the party, whom I will not
name just now, offered to be a target for
birdshot at a distance of a hundred yards.
.'He ; was confident thai he would not be
hurt, and at his request I was chosen to
shoot at him. He walked off about thirty
yards and told me to shoot. I told him to
go further. When he was about a hun
dred yards away I fired, aiming at his
ankle. I knew that he would feel the shot,
and so he did. . Some of it went into his
leg, and he got mad instantly.
"To the surprise of -everybody be raised,
his own gun and without any warning
fired point blank at me. I saw what he !
was doing, and immediately turned my
head. The shot struck me on one shoul
der and my back, and I think about fifty
entered my skin. Nearly all of them were
Eicked out, but about a dozen are still in.
ately they have been troubling me and I

Enthusiastic "Meeting of the Young
Men's Club.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 21.â The Young
.Men's Central People's Party Club of ! Ala
meda County held a very largely attended
and enthusiastic meeting last night. The
president and '; secretary were authorized
to enter into an arrangement with the
County Central Committee with regard to
the lease of a hall for. a permanent : meet
ing place. The matter of . organizing a
â¢campaign quartet was presented and taken'
under advisement.
H Attorney N. : J. Man son addressed the
club upon the relations of the citizen to
the Government â city, State and Na
tional. He referred to the various func
tions.of the Government, particularly | the
right to coin money and fix the value
ttiereof. He declared that this was one of
.itie sovereign functions of government,
and that it is the stamp; of the Govern
ment,; and not; commodity value, - that
-makes money. Continuing, he said: '
, The daily press, with rare exceptions, , sedu
. lously suppresses the statements of the growth
â¢of the People's party. ' The People's party to
day is the second strongest party in twenty
States of-. this Union. In several States it
quadrupled its vote in 1894, as compared with
its vote of 1892. â  In four States it trebled its
.vote, In eleven States it doubled its vote and in
forty-one States it increased in 1894, compared
with the vote in 1892. In November, 1895. in
, Ohio, polled 56,000 votes, in lowa over 32,
--000; in Kansas, there being no election for-
Governor, People's party carried a major
ity of the counties. , The great reforms -for
â¢ which the People's party stands can only be
secured, through education and legislation,
; but great progress is being made and the out
look for the People's party is very promising. -
';".- ;;... Colored Impostor. .
- -OAKLAND, Cal., March 21.â There is a
colored man going about Oakland, Berke
ley and San V Francisco begging. He
pretends to be a deaf mute, and is believed
' to have realized a neat sum from business
men and attorneys, whom he seems to par
ticularly seek. He has been ; a frequenter
of ; the Montgomery -street offices in San
Francisco for several days this week. His
method of approach, is to draw attention
' to himself and then present the following.
letter: Ybby Âyy ;*yy; .-. 5
Berkeley, Cal.
To whom it may concern: This is to certify,
that the bearer is no fraud. He is a colored
. deaf mute who came out here to teach the col
ored deaf and dumb, but found out when he
f arrived here that there were none â to i teach,
and he can get nothing to do and: has not the
money to return home. He has papers with
him from the deaf mute institute at Raleigh,
Carolina, showing he is no fraud. I feel any;
contribution you may giveâ let it be ever so
littleâ will be given toward - a good cause. He
will be thankful for 5 or 10 cent contributions.
..: '.'.';. V : J. W. AVilkeeson,
â  j^;; Manager Deaf Mute Institute, Berkeley. :
This appeal usually resulted in the fellow
securing a quarter of a half dollar,' and he
went his way, rejoicing. - This morning
one man to whom he presented the letter
: saw, that it did not read smoothly and that
r the signature was incorrect. He took- a
copy or it and forwarded it to Professor
Warrir, Wilkinson of the California insti
. tution : or the education of the â â  deaf - and
dumb and the blind at Berkeley, who re
plied: j -
' That fellow is a scoundrel and fraud. I have ;
never sren him, nor did I ever, write such a
letter, i You see be has not spelled my name
correct) but not one man in twenty would r
notice I -. The letter is a tissue of falsehoods'
throughout. The colored deaf mutes are cared
for in this institution the same as the whites.'
I do not know even whether the â  fellow is a
mute himself. I desire the press to give him
the widest publicity, that the public may not
be imposed upon by such a fraud and scoun

an extensive industry.
Captain E.H. Nielsen, the new. manager
of the company, says: "We expect to pack
10,000 or 15,000* cans at Milpitasâ mostly
asparagus and : pears, and asparagus will
predominate. To get these articles put up
in good condition it is necessary to pack
them as quickly as possible alter they

they soon grow hard and tough. We will

--... 908 Broadway,- March 21. J
â¢ The announcement ; that â¢: the War De
partment . has \. decided b that . the 4 present
bridges across the estuary are obstructions
to. navigation - and b that ; propositions re
garding a single: bridge would be enter
tained has created general interest, and a
special meeting of the ; Supervisors has
been called â¢ for .Monday to consider' the
matter. - â  -'-Â-' " .
: The ideas expressed by Mayor Davie in
this morning's Call are very generally
approved, although it is thought by many
that the farther east a bridge is placedâ in
case a single bridge: is decided upon â the
better for the future of the harbor. "What
would be the foot of Fallon street, if ; con- !
tinued, will be advocated by many at the
meeting called â ' by Colonel Sutter for
March 25. It is argued that should i, one
double-deck bridge be decided upon â¢it
should be east of all .existing -deep- water
wharves. If the bridge is placed at : Oak
street it will interfere with the; commerce
at the large Adams -wharves," 1000 feet of
which is constructed and 500 feet of which
is now being built. .. â  y<yy.
In the case of a single bridge with two
decks it would , be necessary to have a very â 
easy grade for, the teams on the - upper
track. This could not possibly be done at
either Webster or Alice streets, where the
present bridges are. now located. In a few
months' time when the new wharves east
of Alice street are being used the two
bridges will have to be open nearly all the
time to accommodate the commerce of the
estuary. Not " only, would vessels ' at tne
wharves require that the draws be opened,
but the -little tugboats that moor there
would also have to ,be accommodated.
This would . seriously interfere with the
communication between Oakland and Ala
meda. With one bridge at Fallon street
the whole of .'. the 1 space that is used by
deep-water ships *. would be entirely unob
structed, and it could be built so 1 that
small tugs and gasoline i launches could
pass beneath one of the piers. At the pres- ,
ent time every little bit of a vessel | reqires
the opening of | both bridges. One of the
greatest objections to the present draws is
that they are much too narrow. '. " ; ;* â 
It is never safe for a big vessel to move
in a harbor unless the tug can make fast
alongside.-; This is impossible with , the
present draws and .while towing with the
steamer a head many vessels' have ' been
sheered off by. wind and tide and have in
jured the bridges and damaged tbeir hulls.
The marks of several broken bowsprits arid
booms are to be seen on both bridges.
: There has been some \ doubt expressed
as to the rights of the Government on the
premises to interfere with ; the ; bridges,
he . following section :of the :? river â¢ â  and
harbor act approved September 19, 1890,
clearly shows 7 that the War Department
has : absolute â â . control of , all such .bridges
and has ample power, to remove obstruc
tions:-, -.. '."-,."**. â '.-â ;; :.~.-^.'- ' .',- -â '.-v
V "That whenever the Secretary of War
.shall have good reason to believe that any
railroad or other bridge now constructed,
or which may hereafter be constructed'
over any of the navigable waterways of the
United States, is an unreasonable obstruc
tion to the free navigation of such waters
on account of insufficient height, width of
span, or otherwise, or where there yis
difficulty in passing the draw opening or
the draw span of such bridge by .; raits,
steamboats, or other water-craft, it .shall
be the duty of the said Secretary, first giv
ing the parties, reasonable opportunity to
be heard, to give notice to the persons or :
corporations owning lor controlling j such
bridge so to alter the same as to render,
navigation through or under it reasonably
free, easy and unobstructed ; and in giv
ing such notice *; he ; shall j specify .; the
changes required to ;be made, and shall
prescribe in each case a reasonable time in ;
which to make men*. If at the end of
such , time the ; alteration â  has not been
made, the Secretary . of War shall \ forth
with notify, the * United \ States District
Attorney . for the district in which" such '
bridge ia situated, to the end that the
criminal proceedings mentioned in the
succeeding section may be taken.
"That if tbe persons, corporations, or as
sociations owning or controlling any rail
road; or other bridge, shall, after receiving
notice to that effect, as- hereinbefore re
quired from the â  Secretary of â¢ War, : and
within the time prescribed by him, will
fully fail or refuse to remove the same, or
to comply with the lawful order of the
Secretary of War in' the premises, such
persons, corporation or association shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and.
on conviction thereof, shall be punished i
by, a fine not 1 exceeding ; $5000, and every
month such persons,^ corporation, or asso
ciation shall remain in default : in respect
to the removal or alteration of such bridge
shall be deemed anew offense, and subject
the persons, corporation or association so
offending to the., penalties above pre
scribed. Y'Y'Y'Y y'.y
" The news was also received : from Wash
ington '. to-day ; that the harbor * improve-*
ment work will be transferred to the con
tract list. Henceforth it will not be neces
sary to labor hard every year to get an ap
propriation into the river and harbor bill.
The appropriation will be contained in the
civil sundry bill, which passes every year,
and the amount will be decided â¢ by the re
port of the Government engineers saying
what sum can be profitably expended. The
whole battle for the improvement of Oak
land i harbor, showing < the necessity for
the work, justifying ' Its V character J and
proving its urgency, will no longer have to
be fought over at each session of Congress.
All of that is avoided by adopting the con
tract system, which is the : basis Â« upon â 
which the principal harbor | improvement
enterprises of the country have been put
recently. V This will .prove; a great help to
the work and the prospects for the develop
ment of the harbor are â  brighter now than

but a short time, so that after a few weeks
all that remains of what might be a class
memento: is a withered 'twig. . y'yyyyy ,
A suggestion is being considered that
the '96 graduates make their class-day ora
tions over some permanent improvement
that will be really a memorial of , the class.
Among.:. the schemes mentioned are the
construction of a water fountain or a stone
walk and the donation -of some ; needed
books to the university library.. : ,
* . A plan for future graduates .. to follow is
the "* transplanting â¢> of : oaks " to shade * . the
"Students' Pathway," as suggested by
Regent Reinstein. It is too late for '96 to
attempt to do this, but the matter is receiv
ing attention from other classes.

. - Ex-Mayor W. ;R. Davis has issued a call
to -the people of this city to unite in mak
ing the coming Fabiola Floral Fete an un
precedented } success. â¢ It reads as follows:
(... The > Executive ; Committee* of ;â¢ the "t Fabiola
Floral Fete are earnestly at work to make May
day next not only a successful day for the Fa
biola Hospital (one of the worthiest and best
administered charities of : California), but also
an Oakland day worthy of the city and.county.
The good name of our city is involved in this
undertaking as well as the benefit to charity.
Last: year's fete was an unqualified success.
Let us improve 'upon it this year.'-* We nave
that much added experience; let us add new
zeal to that which made last year's success. A
city as well as an individual should grow every
year., What was enough before is not enough
now. During the past year our citizens have
learned to co-operate practically and success
fully on three or four different public matters.
V None was more important than this will be
in * its ' bearings ' upon â  the city's good : name.
Other places in the State are astir, and it be
hooves our i friends of â¢ the . charity and of the
city to contribute to I the ' success of Oakland's
coming \ fete day. y'A" grand â¢>' floral : display,
worthy of , Oakland and Alameda County, will
be â . the central :' event of the * festivities. Ar
rangements haVe been made to add a most
attractive >; feature, an exhibition of â  college
athletic events by tne athletic team of the
University of California, the crack team of the
Western intercollegiate States. Their work at
this fete will be their last day in California
(and their only; exhibition day) before their
departure for the Eastern intercollegiate con
tests. _ The wheel contests 'Wilt; surpass in im
portance - anything before seen here.- .Other
attractions of novelty and interest are to be
added.: -.-, â â¢'â :: 'â  "- "y
Â The desire of the "management is to render
service to a splendid charity and to do credit
to our city, both in one. 4 . The committee be
speak the assistance audi the exhibit of every
exhibitor of last year ' and of all other liberal
and progressive citizens who have pride in
their home city or interest in her benevolent
charities. The ladies of the Fabiola work year
in and year out without compensation or re
ward except only that ; which arises from un
selfish acts. If they do this work by the year
all others ought to oe willing to do their share
for the one ; day dedicated to such benevolent
purposes. * -
-.: The headquarters are at rooms 201-202 Cen
tral Bank building, Fourteenth street and
Broadway, Oakland, where the secretary, is in
daily attendance from 8 :30 a.* ii. to 5 p. M. â â â  All
questions and correspondence will: be courte
ously and | gladly answered. Those intending
to make floral displays. will confer a favor on
the : committee ;by - sending sin their names
early, with a statement of what the nature of
the display is to be. The pressure of details
toward the last will be , great, and early infor
mation will be a favor to the committee as well
as a stimulus to others. The committee rely
confidently upon the local- pride and the sup
port of the people of Oakland to enable them
to make the fete a great aid to a worthy charity
and the day one memorable in the progressive
development of the city. âV .

Here in Years.

â¢
The Steamers Noyo and Pasadena, That
Were in Collision, Returned
to Port
The first Russian sailing vessel that has
visited San Francisco in years arrived
The Barkentine Behring,' the First Russian Sailing Ship That Has Visited San Francisco in Twenty Years. â 
-,/b . â ' by b . [Sketched by a "Call" artist.] - ' -'b
from Yokohama yesterday. She is the
handsome brigantine b Behring, and has
come ere in .',' ballast ._ to load a general
cargo for the Russian Sealskin Company.
From San Francisco she will^ go to Beh
ring Island and thence to Kamchatka to
deliver stores and ; collect the -furs*' that
have been.; secured- during I", the ';'; season.
After calling .â¢ at Vladivostock ;' she will re
turn here { to winter and ; . will ; make ; the
rounds again next year.-- - V "â¢
The I steamer ,-Kotik,' now in port, is also
under the Russian flag; and this is prob
ably first time in forty years that two
trading.vessels.; flying that flag have been
together in this bay. Y.
The Behring is on her maiden : voyage,
having been built in Scotland last year.
She i* 377 tons net burden, 149 feet 5 inches
long, 27 feet 1 inch - broad and 11 feet 8
inches deep. She carries water. bailast,
and will thus be able to make her way up
the rivers on the Siberian coast -. without
any trouble, as it will be easy to pump the
ballast out of her and thus reduce the
draught. / ,
Balfour, Williamson & Co. of 'â  London
yesterday libeled the Ship Lyndhurst for
$7715. The claim is that this i firm ad
vanced Â£1500 on the freight earnings of
the ship. The loan was advanced last
June and was due in three months. It
was never paid, hence the attachment.
The barkentine Tropic Bird arrived from
Tahiti yesterday after a;. lengthy passage
of thirty-three days. She was caught in
two storms, and during one of > them the
bobstay snapped and the c jibboom was
almost torn out of the vessel. .- Captain
Burns hove her too and set the crew at
work. It took over twenty-four hours to
splice the stick, and the work was so well
done that it never gave an inch during the
succeeding gales. The Tropic ; Bird will
discharge and then dock for repairs. .'.;
The barkentine brings the news that
Mamea, Queen of. Raratea, is still holding
out against the French. H- The * gun boats
.... . :. .\y .-.-yy yy â¢
have ; driven her from the coast, but I the
French troops . cannot * reach y her j. in the
mountain fastnesses of the island, and she
is thus able to hold her own. Mam ea will
never % be \ conquered ">. until ? roads are built
throughout the island. .:,_-.b'*V'.;Y'"bb .

steamer Caroline â will Â« make '.regular] trips

â  The ship Empire will take a Japanese
crew. She is going from here to Moody
ville to load lumber for r Australia, and- as
.Captain Krebd is a lover of cooly labor he
took the Jans along, because, they are
cheap. The Empire is a : shabby looking
craft and looks â as though she" had not
been cleaned for a year. Captain Krebs is
said to have a ; Chinese - crew : in - trainine.

. The salt has all been taken .out of the
Emma F. Herriman and the old whaler
will be docked for a survey. The sinking
of the vessel will result in a lawsuit be
tween Captain ; Jorgenson and A. Robin
son, the charterer. The latter says the
former must make the damage good. -Jor
genson says he will not. The holes that
let the water in were bored by Jorgensoa's
orders.
, ; The steamers Noyo and Pasadena that
were in ; collision V near ; Point Arena last
Friday in the fog | have gone on the mud;
flatsâ the Pasadena at the Mission and the
Noyo in Oakland Creek. Captain Hamil
ton says the Pasadena was at a dead stop
when the Noyo struck her. a Six of her
timbers were smashed in and 6000 s feet of I
lumber was ';. jettisoned ;-*;.; and J 10,000 feet
moved to port in order to j, get the hole out
of the water. The Noyo has her bow* stove
in and r will take _a| long time \ to *; repair.
There will be an interesting right over the
placing of $ the blame, as one captain ac
cuses tiie other. The Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers will probably settle the/mat-"
ter. ' . * ,

NANSEN AND THE POLE

Nansen's Heroic Work.
'â¢; 'â .'___"
Dr. G. H. Salamonsen of Copenhagen,
Denmark,' a wealthy gentleman 1 who has
devoted: much ~ time to philosophical and
scientific research, is at the Palace.
He has recently visited Venezuela and
Cuba, and f is now ien route to Japan. - Dr.
Salamonsen has. as a matter of pleasure
and to inform is friend s; been correspond-,
ing with several /Danish' newspapers; in
cluding the Dannebrog, the most powerful
daily in the kingdom. â¢
Dr. Salamonsen is intimately acquainted
with Dr. Nansen, who sailed in the â¢ Fram
to discover the north pole; and Dr. E. An
dree, who is to sail shortly in a great bal
loon on the same quest, b
He tells many things regarding those
noted men not known in America; and con
siderable that is perhaps not known to the
majority of â¢ their countrymen. V -
He says both Nansen and Andree are
men of extraordinary endurance^ and of
great determination. He believes that Dr.
Nansen has already found the ; pole and
says the majority of the Danish, Norwegian
and Swedish people also Believe this. "As
for â  Dr. Andree i he says; he believes also
that Nansen has found the pole, but never
theless he will set out himself and try and
find it by the novel method of sailing over
the ice. ;;';-' â ' < v ; â ";â¢ â¢;'';â 
"He is a little bit cast down," said Dr.
Salamonsen, "for" fear he will not be the
first to arrive at the pole. , If Nansen has
found it of course Andree will not get the
glory he would if he had Â» got there .first.
Dr. Andree will set out nevertheless. 7
"I believe myself that Dr. Nansen has
found the pole, and is "coming back. This
opinion is shared by .the majority of the
people; in : my country'.; The news thus far
has come, from ; a 'trader ;on the remote
frontier. I think b that ';, Nansen bas dis
patched a boat ahead of him' /with * a dis
patch signed by him, arid' that it was' lost.

greatly interested in him. ; ., â¢.'..^'yyy^y

did riot expect' to* be back in less than three
years, and Mrs. Eva Nar.seri,his wife, who
lives in Christiana, and who > was asked
recently about it.- said she had never ex
pected . him inside â of that time. Now,
however, the time is about up. . , ; , , ]. I
'"Mrs.. Nansen is a teacher of music in
Christiania arid sometimes appears in con
certs-there. The doctor and his amiable
wife are. simply like ; thousands of, other
meritorious and ambitious young people.
They have little' money, but lofty pur

themselves. ; They have Ia A. little y son, ; I

FARES TO SAN RAFAEL.
The Railroad Commission Will Make an
â¢â¢â¢â .', Investigation in the Public's
Interest.
. Railroad Commission Stanton stated
yesterday that he was making an "investi
gation into the conditions of passenger
business on the San Faancisco and North.
Pacific Railway with a -view of ascertain
ing how the fares between Sari Rafael and
San Francisco might be reduced. c
"This is a matter," he said, "in which
we do not caw to ; take immediate action.
The Donahue broad has always been re
garded by the press and the people as a
popular road, and even in this matter of
reducing the fare from r Sari Rafael it wri
the president who made the first move. V
' .'.'He wanted to make the reduction, but i
was - enjoined by th c * other \ road. So it
would hardly have been 1 â fecessary," for the
commission to think of official ; action in
the premises I if i* more Z: railroad j litigation
had not been instituted. The line is in my
district, and I amy gathering data upon
which to establish a basis for reduction of
the rates. There are j many* factors that
govern rates, and each of '* these should be
carefully considered. -y -' * -V '
-"For instance, if ; the Donahue b road was
carrying half as many passengers as cross
the ferry to Oakland, it could well I afford
to reduce its fares. But with a limited
.patronage it is doubtful how far a "railway
company may go in ! lowering the fares and
rates. It certainly cannot make â * such -J a"
low figure as the road with a large pat-"
ronage. . â¢ y -
"* "This is the case with the Donahue road.
; The patronage has not been sufficient to
admit of very low fares, but that is some
thing I have to estimate closely. V I would !
like, however, for the line to fix its own
rates, because it is a popular, road and our
intervention would seerr/like an intrusion.
As soon as the Attorney-General is fin
ished with this Southern ; Pacific case we
propose to go ahead with our work and
take up the matter of cheaper fares be
tween here and San Rafael." '"" by; >y

ALTHOUGH having no legal claim
to the title, San Francisco '* was
once, to all intents arid purposes,
the capital of j California. The
Governor had his office, both
houses of the State Legislature held their
sessions and all the business pertaining to
the management of "affairs of state" was
transacted here. Most of , the - old-timers
who were middle-aged at the time
have passed away, but those still living
remember the circumstances well.
It all happened in that memorable. year,
1862, the first day of which " broke so
ominously. Clouds of war hovered over
the Nation, and large sections of Cali
fornia were being devastated by the ac
tions of the elements. Hundreds of people
perished in floods and thousands were
brought to the verge of starvation through
the ruin wrought to their ranches and
homes.
"When the Thirteenth Legislature met in
Sacramento ,on January 6, 1862, things
were most discouraging. The city was
partially flooded and the American River
was still rising. Streets were like lakes of
liquid mud and it was almost impossible
for the statesmen to get from their hotels
to the legislative, halls. On the 7th, Bth
and 9th of the month the rain came down
in torrents and the rivers Kept crawling
up higher and higher. On tbe lOthLeland
Stanford was inaugurated Governor. . It
was a most dismal affair, in spite of the
efforts of those present to put off the de
pressing effects of the gloomy, tenacious
dampness. Only ten ladies were present
as it was imp ssible, on account of the
weather, for others wbo ; intended to come
to leave their homes. There was no in
auguration ball, as that night a flood came
down upon the city an there was several
feet of water in the streets.
The next day, the 11th, the legislators
went to the Capitol in boats and were so
discouraged that ' the Senate, by a vote of
20 to 13, adopted a concurrent resolution
to adjourn the meeting of the Legislature to
San Francisco for the remainder of the
session. The Assembly refused to concur
by a vote of 36 to 40. This caused great re
joicing among the people of Sacramento,
who feared that if the seat of government
was once removed from their city it might
never be returned. The Senate then took j
a temporary adjournment until the 21st,
by which time the members of the Assem- j
bly bad changed their minds, so that on
the 22d both houses agreed to adjourn to
San .Francisco. - v* v x
As, soon as the affair was settled the
statesmen acted as if their lives depended
on getting out of town as quickly as possi
ble. Less than two hours elapsed after
the passage of the- resolution before the
steamer Chrysopolis started down the river
with some 100 out of the 120 members on
board. In addition there were the families !
of some of the -members and an army of
clerks, so- that the vessel had about all it
could carry. There was not accommoda
tion for more than half the number, but
all seemed to take on new life at the pros- [
pect of getting away from the rain-soaked |
capital. ; .
The next day, the 22d, the few remaining
statesmen followed, accompanied by the
desks, chairs, etc., belonging to both
houses. They arrived in San Francisco j

called to .order/; The Senate was given
quart rs which" were afterward occupied by
the United [States District Court, and the
Assembly" was located in the Circuit Court
room, which was the larger and more con
venient. '' -V . ..','â  ,
The session that followed was Jong and
exciting, and at times [became strongly
dramatic on account of the intense fueling
prevailing as a result of the war.} There
were many men in the Legislature who
were Southern sympathizers, ; although
they made efforts to conceal the fact.; and
when any question l "came up that called for
support ' of â¢ the ' National ' cause there "was
sure to be strong" language, and on several
occasions personal J encounters took place.
One of the first bills, before the Senate
was a proposition; to pay at once the, war
tax apportioned to' California by the Na
tional Con-res;-. The debate was a violent
one, as those members who', had a friendly
feeling for ihe South attempted to prevent
the payment by ail sorts of excuses. The
tax was , 1254,538, and [these : members
pointed to the destitution caused by.the
floods t prevailing in many .parts of the
State as a reason for deferring payment for
a time. ' They said $250,000 would go a long
way toward relieving the suffering people,
while it would be very little; in the vast
sum- needed, to carry on the war. {Â.;. y
At such times great excitement prevailed |

on the floor, as many members made an
attempt to : speak at the same time. The
chairman rapped for order and the specta
tors cried, "We have money enough for
both," "Let us stand by our country if it
ta_es our last dollar," etc. When the
question was at last put to a vote it was
carried by a large majority and the State
Treasurer. was ordered , -.to pay the money
"at once."
For several weeks the session was un
eventful ! until President Sbafter intro
duced a bill in the Senate on behalf of the
Taxpayers' Union. It provided for "the
general quieting of title on all outside
lands and the issuing of grants to all par
ties who would make actual improve
ments." The idea of the bill was to over
come the effects of land-grabbing. Many
men had filed on 160-acre tracts of lands
within the grant of the Pueblo of San
Francisco, and were simply holding on to
them as an investment. The Taxpayers'
Union was composed of some of the best
business men in the City, who thought
that everybody should have a chance io
secure a home without paying an exorbi
tant price. They simply intended to carry
out the spirit of the old Mexican law.
A great deal of thought had been spent
on the bill and 99 out of every 100 people
in tne City wanted to see it pass. Crowds
filled the streets while the debate was on.
As the weather was warm the windows of
the Senate chamber were open, so that
many of the speakers could be heard 'in
the yard of tne United States Custom
house across the street. V It was impossible
for vehicles to pass along Battery street, so
dense was the crowd that cheered, groaned
or hissed, according to the way the - utter
ances of the speakers suited them. The
taxpayers made a hard fight, but the land
owners/to whom the passage ;. of the bill
meant ruin^made a "money fight" in the
lobby with the result that the bill was
beaten by a small majority. The excite
ment that prevailed when this was an
j nounced beggars description. People al
most trampled over one another in their
I efforts to get into the building, and could
! the men who voted against the bill have
j been found there is little doubt but that
! they would have sustained bodily harm.
.Within' a few days, the Senate was called
i upon to sit as a ; nigh court of impeaoh
j ment to try Judge Hardy of the Sixteenth j
! District Court tor "disloyalty and viola
â  tion of the oath of office." It .seems that I
Hardy was a strong Southern sympathizer 'â¢
and was . liable to be ; bitter ;in his utter- j
ances against the United States Govern- i
ment." While coming down the " river â¢on ;
the steamer he saw a Union soldier arid j
made disparaging remarks about his uni- j
form. He told the man that if he had any |
sense he would wear a gray suit instead of
a blue one. An argument ensued in which !
! Hardy referred to the American flag as "A
dirty, rag." He said that if he had one at
the moment he would tear it into ribbons
arid throw them into the soldier's face.
Tbe trial of Hardy was a long one and it
[ is said that evidence not directly con
i nected with the case was brought ajainst
him,- principally - the . little * strategy.; to
which he resorted to avoid trying Terry
for the killing of Broderick. Intense feel- ;
ing prevailed among the -people and the
I discussion of the case often led to personal
encounters of ' a violent character on the
streets. ".' ':}";;;--Â«-; 'â .-.'.â 
Judge Hardy, however;. was not particu-
l arly disturbed during the . trial," although
i it meant a great deal to him. ; He referred
to the matter as a joke, but never admitted
that ;he diari't mean [what he had said.
The verdict was, of course, against him,
arid after the furor had subsided that fol
lowed its announcement he rose i in ; his
seat and thanked the court for not finding
anything against his honor. "While I
deeply regret," he said, "that [-1, have met
this humiliation, I accept the verdict and
relinquish my office. But," he continued,"
"I am of the same opinion still." *
..-[ A great patriotic demonstration followed
the night after the verdict was announced.
B fires were .built in the principal streets
and speeches were made by the most prom
inent men. Everybody cheered and swore
allegiance to the; Union until long [after
midnight, and there was no more fuel to
feed the bonfires.. ;,.;.; , â¢ â 
The next exciting business of the Legis
lature -'was also "; due â¢to 'â¢' partisan feeling
caused by the war}. It seems 'that: at that
time a [ law existed ;on trie statute-book
similar to one in force in the Southern
States. ;b:lt prohibited ;, a person -of more
than one-eighth negro blood from testify
ing in the courts of justice. The war had,
of course, stirred rip feeling against it, but
it was brought to a climax by several acts
of a criminal character. The first case wwars r

i it appears that he put the drug in the man
gers on Saturday night,- and on the follow
ing Sunday, when the horses were -but "on
the road, they fell; sick and died. In all
twenty-six * horses ; were poisoned. The
purchase of the ; strychnine was traced to
the discharged man, and he was seen to
go into the stable by George Dennis, also a
colored man, whose evidence, of course",
could not be given in court, so the culprit
was discharged. b â¢
The next case happened while the Legis
lature was in session. ' It was one in which
a negro barber named George Nichols, who
had a shop under the old Tehama House, 5
was killed by a young man named Shell.
The only person who saw the shooting was
another barber named b Cowes, who had
always passed : for a , white ' man. But his
hair was examined under the microscope
by Dr. Toland and trie roots were found to
be curly. This marked him .as 'â ' more | than
one-eighth negro and his testimony was
barred, while the murderer was ; set free
"for want of evidence." .

| Senate â¢.. trouble y commenced. Many of
! those [ statesmen held .the "view that ne
i groes were not as -[ good as 'â¢ a white man
â  and that God had created them so.
; One" rather ; boisterous member*" got; up
| and baring his arm to the elbow pointed
| to the veins and said: i "See that; Anglo-
Saxon [: blood in there, It ;is not like Af
rican blood.. It has come to me through a
long line of noble ancestry and I would in-,
suit my race if I acknowledged that it was
no different from the blood of a negro." 'â â â â â 
The little sally brought forth . rounds of
applause,' until a very small member got
;up excitedly and * cried : "No ! â¢ It's â¢ not
; like negro blood ; but if you examine your
noble ancestry you will most likely find
they were ; robber " barons, cutthroats and
pirates." This squelched the; other mem
ber, but when the bill was put to the vote
it was defeated.
While the Legislature was in session the ;
citizens ;of San Francisco exerted them- j
selves to the extreme to * entertain the ;
members. There ; was at least some big j
social function every week, and the ladies i
of the City held . several fairs for the bene
fit of the flood sufferers. ; The largest re
ception during the session was given by
Mr. Maynard in his elegant residence.
Nearly all of ; the members were in attend
ance, and it is said to have been one of the ;
grandest social events in the City's history. '
The Thirteenth Legislature did not fin- j
ish its labors until May 15, 1862. In addi- ;
tion to other work.it made arrangements
for a capital building -. fund and ordered
changes in the foundation of the present
building, then in course of construction. It
was discovered that when the flood was at
its height what was intended , for the first
floor was seven feet under water.
'â â  The adjourning of the Thirteenth Legis

important point of law, and there .is
still some doubt "; as to whether ; the laws
then \, passed * are Â»; legal. =[ Many eminent

THE misadventure by which ;. I in
nocently assisted the ' escape *of
Thomas Quigley, whose crime is so
familiar to the older persons living
. hereabout, was not Â« altogether in
excusable, for had I ; Known as much then
as now jI â¢ might not 'â¢ have gone * astray.
Still, when I reflect upon the inexplicable
mystery of the typewriter, and trie strange
confusion and entanglements ; into i which
it led me, I fall upon uncertain conclusions
with regard to my .". matured estimate â of
that famous case.
It was under the following circumstances
that I met Quigley and the man whom he
afterward murdered:
.1 took : the train at Salt ' Lake City for
San Francisco, and on the following morn
ing, when I went early into ' the dressing
room of trie car, I discovered two men
sitting, there fully dressed and talking very
earnestly together. They did not discover
my entrance "< at once,' but when"; they ; ; did
they were evidently* embarrassed, and sat
in an/ uneasy silence.; It might have been
possible for me to hear â¢ a little ; of what
they had been saying had I listened,", but I
had heard nothing and had : been present
but j a moment. Afterward I < accounted
for their confusion on the ground of their
uncertainty concerning the length of ; time
I might have been an eavesdropper. : I gave
so little attention at that time to their odd
behavior that it made only a very r slight
impression. Having a way of seeing with
out looking, I became conscious of ; quick
signs which they made and which 'I con
strued as : having reference to me; but I
cared nothing for that. }- . â  'â '
; They soon "â¢ resumed their talking, -\ arid
when I had finished my toilet I took a seat
opposite them, next )â â  to J the window, . and
addressed ' some indifferent though civil
remark to them. ; The ' larger of the two
responded promptly ; the other remained
silent, ; with . a "pair of dark sharp eyes,
deeply shaded by the ; visor of *. a black
traveling cap which ,he wore. Had it not
been â¢ for; their strange recent conduct . I
should not have studied them 'so narrowly.
The two men sat side by side, the smaller
near the window, to which, I afterward re
membered, he kept his back "constantly
turned. " His features were tine arid ; per
fect, his drooping mustache hardly Con
cealing a thin, shrew<" mouth. ; His man
ner mighf have been taken to be satur
nine and surly, but at that time it
seemed to me to have a habitual* air of
being bored. , -, r .y . â¢ Â â  â¢ â¢ ';.â "
'. His companion was his opposite in every
respect. * Though motr not a very large man he
was larger than the other, having a very
florid face, reddish hair and deep red mus
tache, and uncommonly' -large - hands,
heavily freckled and covered with coarse
hair. His blue eyes were frank and pleas
ing ;'â¢.! he faced the light openly, ; talked
freely and was clearly a man of a large and
hearty vemperamer.t. He was constructed
on much ruder lines than the i other and
lacked the other's â  refinement, he was
far more comfortable a companion. "'.-.'â

and no names were spoken in the strange
conversation : which soon ; ensued, I - saw;
that a valise on the floor at the feet of ; trie

' The only part of our conversation which
is relevant ' t0 "... this story is - that -which , I

y Our talk bad drifted to, those " strange
â  phenomena which, with the ignorant, give
; birth to a belief in supernatural agencies.
I had mentioned tbe superstitions of > some
marine arid locomotive engineers with '\ re
gard to the complex machines which they
handled, when the florid ' man boldly an
nounced {that' he firmly believed 4in such i
things V arid related : ; strange .incidents f of ;
their occurrence. When he had concluded
his stories the -small 4 man;; who had lis-;
tened with a sneer on " his ; lips, made the}
following statement: "â¢'.., Â«"â â â¢-.'â '.
â¢b; "All this is very 4 interesting, but quite
absurd. Nevertheless, he jisj a bold \ man
who will attempt to explain all the things
peculiar to complicated machines. Has it
ever occurred ~to you," he asked, address- ,
' ing me with: a shifting, uncertain glance,'*
.''that ; such a machine may taKe on the
character of the"-" person" who operates it
arid betray the peculiarities which distin
guish him?" . â â  yy _ - .
"No,'' I answered, smiling; . "but that 1
seems; as incredible as this . gentleman's
anecdotes."
,:; "Doubtless. But let us reflect a mo
ment. Take - a writing-machine for illus
tration. A typewriter has a complicated';
mechanism, and as, unlike a steam-engine;
it has -no , power except that which the ,
operator gives from : his â¢ own ; personal : ; re
sources, its efficiency is wholly dependent,
upon* him. Its delicate ; bars ; and levers, :
made of highly tempered steel, are highly
sensitive. In the wide and complex range
of impulses which tbey receive from trie
operator ;â¢ their , molecular constitution
must undergo specific modifications which
the distinctive individual touch of the ope
rator imparts. There will ensue a definite
rearrangement ; : of the metallic crystals,
bearing an absolute relation '.. to the tem
perament of the operator. Is not this con
ceivable?" ','.-'-. , ;
: "It at least is interesting," .I ; answered. .
""But granted that it is true, how can it be
proved and what purpose could the knowl
edge serve?" y <
â  "Knowledge," he rejoined, "is not to be
despised merely because no use for it may
appear. As. for testing the matter, Ido
not care to take the 1 trouble, â¢; but I can
imagine . that ; a very sensitive and highly
organized person might ' learn something
of , the character, of : a writing-machine's
owner .by making' a r close b study of its
peculiarities. " This is my v experience." I
use a ; typewriter very much and find the
use of my machine easy and pleasant, but
I know that with ; a . strange machine,
in all outward respects identically re
sembling mine, my thoughts stumble and
the work is laborious."

I was suddenly summoned one day about
a week after ray return to San -Francisco to
write for one of the newspapers an analysis
of the published disclosures of a singularly
ferocious and mysterious murder . that had
been ; committed two - days before. The
facts ; were exceedingly; meager, trie prin
cipal discoveries being these: . y
,'â _â â ' A strong, florid man for a few days .past
had occupied a room in a lodging-house
on Market "street,;; the noisiest' thorough
fare in San Francisco. He was free and
hearty of manner and had gone out a good
deal. He had paid for a week's lodging
in advance and had given no name, or if
he had the landlady could ;' not ; remember
it and a search of his valise failed-: to give
any clew to his identity, .except a card 1 '
which bore the name, "Thomas Quigley."
This did not recall to my mind the mdi!
-! dent of the strangers on the train.
''Trie man drank heavily. One morning
j the chambermaid found a card >. pinned to
tbe door of his room, saying that he 'did
not wish to be disturbed that day. The
card remained there all that day: and the
next. Toward evening of , the second day
the landlady, becoming uneasy, tried to
rouse her ',:â¢ lodger, and; then to ] open '.the.
door, '. but found that impossible. Upon
attempting to peer through the keyhole
she saw that it had been covered ' by some-
thing hung upon the inner knob, but ; she
could see that ', the ; doorkey .' had ' been re
moved' bs From this she inferred^ that the
door was bolted on the inside. These cir
-1 cumstances alarmed .: her* and she sum
moned a policeman.
. -- The â  'officer burst - in the door and
was confronted with a scene of uncommon
horror. â¢ Not only had there . been 'â¢- a mur
der, but the body) had been dismembered
and comminuted with extraordinary pains.
This ' work 'â¢; was so complete that had not
the landlady and )'; the chambermaid fur
nished [so clear ' a description of the lodg
er's appearance the ~\ identification would
have been impossible. No one -but him ;
had been seen about the room.
V There were various minor circumstances
that gave me a little working ground, but
as the whole- case was apparently an un
solvable mystery bit v. was i with no light
whatever ; that if 1} set about a study of '. the
published accounts.-" - .
It happened that my typewriter i had
broken down the day before arid that I had'
sent it ;' to the agent for repairs. So I sat
'down ;'. to -the unaccustomed task of think
ing with a ; pen, but could make no head
way at all. The chaos of the murder was
supreme and overshadowing. YMy nerves
. went astray, my patience broke down and ,
Heft the task. ' â  '','*'
Still, I hated to give it up.. It occurred I
to me; that possibly my typewriter, which
helped me to think ',; with : ease; might have
been repaired. b I hurried to ' the k shop and
was told that > the work had riot vet been
completed. b y yb b- ,"' y*
,;; "However,", said the agent, "I can lend

-; I shook my head, feeling that without
my own instrument I could do nothing.
; ;"I have just " remembered," said the
agent, "that I have on hand an old ma
chine of this make which I repaired a few
days ago for a stranger, who has not yet
called for it. "It V is as ; limber arid " easy* as
yours. Give it a trial." â¢
It is impossible for me to explain why I
decided to make the experiment, for it was
riot the stiffness of trie new machines, that
; had kept me aloof from them. And yet
â¢ the indescribable: feeling which clamored
within me for ; my own machine broke
r down before the suggestion that' a particu
; lar strange machine be given a trial. The
- temptation to discuss this part of the
whole mystery ; is very strong, ; but not '
stronger than my ability to resist it.
I sat down to the typewriter,' adjusted a
. piece of paper to the carriage and tried the
â  mechanism. /All the external features of
the machine indicated that it might have
I been my own, arid yet, the very first touch
; of a key was a shock. ' I persisted and ran
, a, sentence through. V I -had tried many ,
strange machines before, but never one so
harsh and rebellious. }
v At first I took it for a stubborn and alto- -
! gether unnecessary refusal} to help ' me
, think. '/: Instead of 1 lending me,' that assist
: ance it confused and bewildered , me, caus
ing my wits \to escape restraint and my
spelling and misuse of words ,to be atro
cious. . This b impression ['â  was ' so much
stronger and more exasperating than any
that ' I y had ' ever before received from a
strange machine that; I came near com
mitting .what â ': I- then ; supposed was ; the
error of '; charging the typewriter with ' the
confusion of â¢my own â â â  mind. No sooner,
however, had 1 taken what I deemed to be
the wiser course in accepting a res_onsi
bility which 1 could not imagine belonged
' to ; the machine than a most surprising
thing occurred.
Ail at once, . after I bad forced the
machine under approximate control and
had adjusted a fresh sheet of paper
upon which to write whatever I could
regarding the mysterious crime (though
with no idea whatever with which
to follow ;up an ' â '- introductory state
ment of the known circumstances), the
machine suddenly became extremely
friendly and feverishly hurried me into
an inexplicable account of two men who
had met on a westbound train at Ogden. '
The apparent irrelevancy of the narrative
did not cause me to stop. It was only
when I myself was , brought by the ma
chine in contact with the men in the
dressing-room of a sleeping-car, and the
name "Thomas Quigley" glibly spelled it
self out ; from the machine, that "I, with
profound amazement, found myself under
tbe control' of <an influence which was as
inexplicable as it was irresistible. .What'
assistance 1 may have received from the
â¢ machine I do not find-it at all necessary to
discuss. I felt simply that it had put me
' in the way of solving the mystery. *
The first' j thing ': that appeared clear '
â¢ (after, the * typewriter "Â£ had * made me re
member the name Quigley as I had seen it
on the valise and heard it from the re
pairer of writing-machines) was that this
: machine was then or very recently, bad
; been the property of : Thomas Quigley.
Had it , not been that the typewriter was
rushing me forward with the narrative of
the two men and myself ;on the train I
should have gone instantly to the repairer
â¢ and asked him for a description of the
man who had left it with him. But it
, happened that before the supposed* solu
tion of the mystery was reached, the type-,
writer fell; into a dumb mood and would
yield nothing .; more. Then : I went to the
repairer, and was not at all surprised to
learn from him that the person who had
brought the machine to be repaired was a
small, dark, saturnine man, with a forced
manner of speech.
111.
My elation over the news may be im
agined. " Still, when I returned to [ the V
machine to complete the narrative (which
was a very different thing from the analy- :â 
sis of evidence which I had started out to
write) -^discovered that, although the
cause and circumstances jof the ; tragedy i
were clear enough to my imagination from
inductive reasoning, I â :. could not force the
instrument to assist; me in their coherent
presentation. T. blundered, faltered arid
; found the typewriter alien and antago
: nistic. - *â  â¢ ; *
Up to this point I had* written nothing
of an analysis of the published accounts of} â¢
the murder, but had squandered ball the
time on a narration of the sleeping-car in
cident. The typewriter had- failed to be
responsive at the moment when the narra
; tive was ended and. the deduction required-
It then became necessary to cease at-,
tempts at 'writing and do some hard think-' '
ing. :To weigh ] the men } and publish a ,

; dangerous thai difficult.; .Then I reflected .
that apart from the garrulity of i the type- .

pairer and the landlady," I had no ground, *
upon which to stand. There was no cvi

- from the machine had any connection ,'
whatever with the. murder.;; More than all '
- that, sudden cessation â¢,, of the type- . "

plicable. The longer I: pondered, on that
coincidence the more bewildered I became
and the more astonished that I had been :
led unaccountably into ; the V assumption'
that the perverse little machine had been
: assisting me with the mystery.;;- All these
reflections served to dishearten me , and I

She was my
Sister
ABOUT five miles before we
reached Sidney, pur , train swept
by a farmhouse standing at some
distance from the . track, and as i
I looked back at. the woman in
the doorway with her hand over her eyes,
watching the train, I wondered if it could
be possible that there was my sister's
home. Nothing more desolate could be
imagined than the little wooden shanty
standing alone in pitiful bareness on the
Nebraska prairie, surrounded only by
fields of sun-dried grass. I had heard how
lonely it was and how unfortunate my
sister and her husband had been, but as I
was an inexperienced optimist with no
troubles of my own to make me realize
those of other people, I had put on a supe
rior air, and thought it "would come out
all right." .
My time for vacation had arrived, and I
was to spend a couple of weeks here.
There was no necessity for my sister and
her husband taking so dark a. view of
things, I thought. The crops had failed,
to be sure, but such matters were all in a
lifetime, and should not be taken too
seriously.
I had telegraphed my brother-in-law to
meet me, and here he was at the station.
The bronzed features under his wide straw .
. hat were so hard and the lines about his
gray eyes were so drawn that I could
hardly recognize in him the young fellow
who had taken his bride from our home
only a year before. Then his eyes 'were
laughing, and although his face was tanned
it was not so blackened as now. And
where was the air of buoyant courage that
had assured us Gertrude's life would be
made easy for her?
He smiled when he saw me. but it was
not the glad, spontaneous smile I had ex
pected to . see. I was sorry that I had
come. Perhaps I should "have written
them before; perhaps they did not want
me. The men in faded brown jeans hang
ing about the station mopped . their faces
and stared at me. I began to fear I had
done myself an injustice in coming out
bere where it was hot and uncomfortable.
My work for the next year would suffer
should I not secure the rest needed. Why
bad I not gone on with the camping party
for Estes Park, where the mountain air
would have given me the strength I
needed? But I was fated now and would
not think of shortening my visit, so I as
sumed an air of enthusiasm and handed
my check to Marion. * -
While he was attending to the baggage I
climbed into the wagon. " The seat was not
comfortable; I could not touch the bottom
of the wagon with my feet, but braced
them on the front endgate. . It would be
very hot riding five miles, even with my
parasoi, but I must be cheerful about it.
be road was barren, without a tree to af
. ford the least shelter. For a time we were
silent. Finally I said: .
"How is Gertrude? Does she get very
... lonesome? s I thought I might be able to
cheer her up a little."
All the while I felt my heart growing
; fainter. For the first time I seemed to
. realize what her discouragement must be.
' It had been easy for us to sit in our cot
* tage at Englewood and plan a free, happy
life for her with the man she loved, and
with no care exceot that of being poor.
Marion was* not thorouehly established,
' but he had good business ability and was
[energetic. *â¢
"On, Gertrude is all right, I guess," he
responded. "We have been in rather hard
luck this year. Everything burned up,
- and there is no prospect for anything bet
; ter that one can see."
They had written me as much, but I
"had been exceedingly cheerful with my
* $75 a month in a pleasant office. I wrote
i them in reply that discouragements come
- to all of us, but that there is no use being
, down-hearted. They should remember
the grasshopper, year. People had. lived
. through that. It would have been very
hard to say this now to the man sitting
beside me with the drawn look about his
eyes.
I felt faint and overcome with the heat,
for my journey had been long - and tire
some. I : wished the horses would move
faster, but there was no life in the poor,

She did not come forward to meet. me,
and I could see the tears standing in her
brown eyes. My poor baby. [She tried to
force back the sobs as I took her in my
arms. .'.--.â '
There were only three rooms in her little
home. They were neat and pretty, but
there was about them an air of stillness or
sameness, although [how that should im
press me at once I could not tell. Later I
understood itâ how nothing new, no

months. There was nothing new to bring
in; no money for: magazines, no trifling
sums to be spent upon new decorations,
not even a flower could grow in that dry
alkali. The shades were drawn to shutout
the white light. It was cooler inside and I
soon felt that life was not so hard after all.
"How hot and dry it is out here, isn't it,
Gertrude?" I said, taking a light view of
the case for the moment and speaking with
much briskness. â¢ .

"Oh, there he comes now."- She left me

; "Oh, I'm all right," he replied.
Y ''Well, how is everything in Chicago?"

me as though we had not seen each ether
! before. "How is your mother? Have you
l seen anything of my people lately?''
"Yes, indeed/ I forgot /to tell you. I
i have a picture of your little sister," I said,
i and brought it from my trunk. .;.
i "Well, well, is that little Harriet? How
1 the child does growl" His face "glowed
: for the . moment, and then " dropping : the
' picture and resuming his former mood he
said : "I hope father is going; to get along

would be bad for a man of his age to lose
his hold. ;: He is going to need all of his
' money to make him and mother comfort

It was growing late in the afternoon and
I Marion and I sat: talkingâ chiefly of the
I crop failure and lack of rainâ although he
tried occasionally to throw off the thought
of that and speak of other matters. But
that one fact was constantly : before us. I
forgot all that was interesting, in my lifeâ '
' so different from theirs and became ab
â¢ sorbed, too, in this one topic/ .- Gertrude at
. last . announced " - supper, , which ' â  she had
spread in the room where we I sat. Her
table was pretty with her wedding gifts of
solid ; silver " and cvt * glassâ but s why had
she provided so little? ,-//';
. This ' day and evening were i much like
the others that followed ' during my visit.*
When I realized how strongly the trouble
had laid; hold t upon :my sister. I resolved
with desperation that I would '- break - the ;
chain which was weaving itself about her.
With* all the reliance L upon Infinite
; that lies back of every soul, I ; struggled to
free - her with - all r the ': strength /I * could
summon I tried to arouse her to a realiza
tion of the danger she was in. There was
a thought in my mind that I did not dare
to i speak Kof even to her husband. 1

quences .:â  of so >:â :.' much Â£ anxiety,*-; but
1 1 did not tell him 'â¢'â . of -A that about
which I thought constantly fand with fear.-
He would have the right to inquire why
this bad not ;i been -i told b_im long before,
when he asked her hand in i marriage.",
be sure, it would not have mattered to him
then, he would have said /as we -did
when we kept *it 'from > him, "That will

tion." But " now 1 dared not ; tell; him
dared 1 not i even hint r : it ; to;' himâ he
could not see how the strength of his will
was dragging her down. ; ' r
The time of my visit drew to a close,
and, s in spite'of all the efforts tlf had made
to some life into their home and
turn the channel of their/thoughts/I could
but feel that my going would only intensify
the loneliness which had been there be

with him. We talked over the matter of

spicuous in San Francisco he decided to
take lodgings in an obscure house where
his name would not be required. To. this
end he was influenced by the stranger,
who -revealed to him glimpses of a
stupendous scheme for manipulating cer
tain mining shares for their common
benefit. ' "
All this seemed new and interesting
matter as I read it. It would have been un
usual for me to concoct so intricate a story,
without a painfully, conscious effort. The
florid, hearty man who had taken lodgings
on Market street ; his heavy drinking; the
dark, cynical,' saturnine man who had
kept completely/ in the shadow and who
had told me of his using a typewriter; the
man of ' similar appearance who had left I a
typewriter , to $be repaired ; the : ease with
which this machine ' had brought me*fac
to face with the two men whom I had sup
posed to be the principals of the tragedyâ
these were â } coincidences * which it was im
possible to ignore.-.
y The discovery of the recent whereabouts
of the small, dark man would be a matter
for patient police research and was foreign
to my, undertaking. A more pressing duty
was to lay my evidence before the Chief of
Police and thus make it possible for him to
intercept the murderer's flight. V -
â¢i His deep interest when I â¢ had told him
everything may be imagined. The hour
for the departure of an eastbound over
land train was nearirig. .'ln ; order not to
miss a chance the Chief hurried in person
to the ferry band I > accompanied him to
identify the fugitive should he appear. I
had written oat description:
"A small, dark ' man with aTcynical air,
and ' possibly carrying a ] valise marked
'Thomas Quigley.'." â  'â .-â  ' y'
At the * ferry we " rah plump ' into the big
florid man ! . The surprise and - shock were
so great and felt so foolish to realize that
all; my ingenious ' fabrication was utterly
without foundation J that I did * not \ even
draw the Chief's attention to him. The
big man passed ' on ; our watch had been
unproductive. The case fell with my
pride and the murderer was never caught.
I submit, however, that my logic was good
and my conclusion intelligent. This was
the only consolation ? I*?. could draw from
my humiliation. Y^ - Y 5

so sooner, but the isolated position of the
islands made work slow. ..
[ ; The lighthouse ' has been erected on the
island ; kriown as East Brother, . although
West Brother projects farther into the bay
and appears to be the better position. â  The
reason for this is apparent in the fact that
East Brother has a -flat; surface, while
West Brother is a round [ hill on which it
would be difficult to build and inconveni
ent to move about in stormy weather.
.The immediate vicinity of the islands is
EAST BROTHER LIGHT STATION, FROM THE SOUTH.

a most treacherous one for navigation, as
a reef following the same general direction
as the islands runs out into the bay a dis
tance of! half a mile/*- Buoys are anchored
at different i points,' but the tide often runs
so swift that they are - pulled beneath the
surface '; and concealed from view. ; . Small
river steamers are frequently * unable to
stem the current, arid will remain in the
same position for hours; Before the light
house was -built 'few iif ' any vessels i at
tempted to pass the * islands at night; ex
cept, i perhaps,;" an occasional man-of-war
when it was a matter of .great importance."
y The first work of the engineers :on East
Brother Island was to build a wall ; around
the top, so as to make a perfectly level sur
face for: the buildings. This was an easy
matter,' as the rocks scattered over the sur
face were simply piled ,up aiong the sides
and cemented "together. The * work ". was
well done, for it has stood the dashing of
waves for twenty-eight years without ever
being repaired. b :-'> v '
The question of water was an important
one. V There was none ;on ' the island , and
the ' only way 'to obtain . it was . from the
rain that fell in the winter. To do this all
of that portion of the island not occupied
by buildings was converted into a "rain
shed." The 'â '. entire V surface was ; covered
with ,- a few inches of } concrete i made . to
slope to the center, in which a s cistern was
located. V Plugs were arranged so that the
water could be allowed to settle before be
ing " turned in. } The â¢ rain r shed contains
about 15,000 square feet i and "â  has the ap-
Eearance of an immense tennis court. It
as always furnished enough water for the
engines and domestic purposes. y
The first building put up on the island
Captain J. O. Steinmark.
[From a photograph.} y
was the light tower. The lamp was first
lighted on : March 2, 1874, and â â > the keeper
occupied the room on the first floor that is
now used as a storeroom. The first light
put in was a revolving red and white flash
operated 4bv weight g machinery .% It re
quired three keepers and/fori some reason
never gave satisfaction so that it was soon
taken out and the present lamp put in/;
: >.:- East Brother light ' is known \as one of
the V fifth \ class. The lenses were made by.
Sautier & Co/of , Paris, who made I nearly
ail of the lenses for the Government about
that time. The lamp burns \ mineral .'.oil
and can develop about? 100 ' candlepower,
that is increased ito 500 by the lenses. It
has two wicks ; and 1 gives ' a steady i white
light. The lamp is sixty-five feet above the
surface of the water, and can be seen from
almost any point on the bay. The location
of East Brother light lis % such that "" on \ a
clear day a person standing in the tower
can see the shore line of every county that
borders %on V the f San ' Francisco ; and San
Pablo bays. ; San Mateo and s Napa show
dimly ,*Â£ but San Francisco,' Alameda, Con
tra Costa, Solano, Sonoma and Marin : can
be plainly seen. * . . ; YY â¢ , â  " "' , \ â¢* ..
Jk The I keeper's 1 residence ." is " made.' to ac
commodate two ' families ' and ,is _ built up
against one side of the tower, so that it is
unnecessary to go outside unless there \is
need \ of ,. the foghorn. The \ building %is \ a
pretty and substantial structure arranged
as conveniently as : ; ib : = possible under the
circumstances. : v ;' yy: ' * "''
â¢ The foghorn was /put up at "the; same
time as the light and occupies a ; building
at the eastern end of the -island//; Steam is
f urni-ned by/ a twenty-horsepower j boiler
and the twelve-inch whistle i 3 blown by a
small engine. -It ? gives a' four-second â  and
an eight-second â¢â¢ blast \ every ./ minute. As
there is always 'some sort of j craft, passing
within a short distance \ of '.the island the
keepers have to V keep .. aS sharp 'lookout,
ijteam is - not kept in the boilers all the
time, but on the first : sign of fog a bell is
riling and kept ringing until the engines
are ready. 1 '; | The boilers are jso constructed
that steam can be "raised in ten or twelve
minutes. - '' _, >
:' ; In its " natural condition East Brother
Island | is | as 3 barren . as Death Valley, but
the ? keepers have brought ' soil : from the
mainland in â  bucketfuls, ; and have suc
ceeded in making quite ; a garden grow on
its surface. V Flowers of different i- kinds
bloom all -j the : year around ? and enough
vegetables are raised to supply a family. - ; :
East Brother light station, has been in
charge of the present keeper, J. O. Stein-,
mark, for the l last three years. He has
but one assistant, James Anderson, an old
time ; memoer ,r of ' the 5 life-saving - service.
Together they do all the work of attend
ing to the light and; keeping the grounds
and machinery in : order. - Mr. : Steinmark
has been in the^ lighthouse service i or ten
years and has been at several' stations On
the coast so that he is thoroughly familiar
with bis business. Â«..' y â  V;
The postoffice address 7 of the East
Brother Island is San Quentin, into which
place the keepers go once or twice a week
for mail : and supplies." On account of / its
peculiar location -: East Brother is not al
ways easy to reach. *i- When". the tide runs
out a very light breeze from the south will
be enough to turn the surface of the bay
into whitecaps through which it would be
impossible to pull a small | boat To make
a landing is nearly always .'a" difficult mat
ter. In very bad weather it is impossible
to come or go, so that, the keepers are fre
quently prisoners for. many days at a time.
; In the winter East Brother Island is a
most, lonesome : place,,, as visitors never
come there. ; "But in the summer the sur
face of the bay in i the vicinity is "covered
with yachts loaded with pleasure 'parties,*
nearly all of whom stop off *at the island.
Hundreds of fishermen also frequent the
locality. V / :-b
:: There are very few casualties near Twin
Brothers, but an occasional fisherman
loses his oar and has to be picked up ;by
the lightkeepers.

SOCIETY
past week has not been qu^te
THE week has been quite
as monotonously dull as its pre-
I decessors. ! While the Lenten ab
___ stinence from all pleasures still
holds good, active preparations for
Easter entertainments have helped to
brighten things up a bit. ;'"â â¢>.
The most discussed Easter entertain
ment yet announced is the private theatri
cals to be given by Mrs. John S. Hager for
her daughtersâ the Misses Emilie \ and
Alice Hagerâ at a date not yet decided
upon. is
it is to be regretted that much unauthor
ized infomiation regarding the nature and
features of the affair has been published,
much to Mrs. Hager's annoyance. A gar
bled society report, as many society lead
ers will testify to, causes much .unneces
sary trouble and involves numberless ex
planations. . . '
No definite details have yet been decided
upon in regard to Mrs. Hager's entertain
ment. The nlay to be presented will prob
ably be a three-act comedy entitled "A
Modern Ananias," but even that is indefi
nite. The cast has not yet been selected,
nor the hall where the entertainment is to
take place.
Invitations will be limited to 200 and the
guests will all be young people. .During
the entire acts there is to. he a divertise
ment of some sort, and after the play, if
the young people so desire it, they may
dance. Light refreshments will be served." :
A professional is to have entire charge of
the stage; No date has yet been fixed for
the affair, which/in spite of -the
indefinite condition in which it at present
rests, is sure to prove, like all Mrs. Hager's
entertainments, a delightful success. I
Tbe Misses Williams, Miss Eyre and;
Miss Hobart, who have been the guests of
Miss Collier at her home at Clear Lake, re
turned to town on Saturday last.
The Misses Williams Â«pent Monday and
Tuesday in this City, devoting much of the
time to -shopping. On Tuesday evening
Mr. Hobart gave a theater party at the
Baldwin in their honor, and the following
day took his guests down to Burlingame.
Among those in the party were : Mr. and
Mrs. Seward McNear, the Misses Morton
of New York and the Misses Williams.
Now there is a doubt a3 to whether the
cotillon which was to have been ; given by J
Mrs. Darling in the hoproom at the Pre- '
sidio complimentary to her daughter, Miss \
Catherwood, will take place at all. Miss
Catherwood is at Coronado visiting her j
aunt, Mrs. Jerome, and it is doubtful <
whether she will return in time for the
proposed affair in her honor. If the af- !
fair is "off" it is much to be regretted, for j
Mrs. Darling is one of the most delightful i
of hostesses and all entertainments over
which she presides are marked by
originality and novelty.
Within the past ten days Mrs. H. L.
Dodge has given several very handsome
dinners at her home on Franklin street.
Mrs. Dodge excels in the art of dinner
giving and her entertainments are always
delightful and enjoyable.
A week ago Friday Colonel Crocker gave
an elaborate dinner at his residence, cor
ner of Pine and Leavenworth streets, com
plimentary to Baron and Baroness Hun- j
ge'.milles of Washington, D. C. His guests i
included Baron and Baroness Ilungel
milles. Baron and Baroness yon Schroe- â¢
der, Prince and Princess Poniatowski, |
Mr. and Mrs. W.H. Crocker, Mr. and Mrs. !
E. D. Bey lard, Mrs. Coit, Miss Hager, Miss !
Hobart, Joseph D. Grant, Walter Hobart. i
There were two interesting engagements
made public during the weekâ Miss Butler
and -Lieutenant Lopez of the navy, and
Miss Claire Ralston and Dr. Bullitt of St.
Louis. No date for either wedding has yet
been announced.
It is rumored that the wedding of Mrs.
Favre and Mr. Babcock is to be quietly
celebrated before the expiration of the
Lenten season. No invitations will be
issued for the event, the date of -which has
been kept a profound secret even from their
most intimate friends.
â¢ In spite of the reports to the contrary Dr.
Tevis has not the . slightest intention at
presentâ as he would like -toâ of
visiting the land of chrysanthemums. Mr.
Lloyd Tevis returned on Wednesday from
his visit to New York and reports the con
dition of Mr. Hag-tin as much improved. b
It is not probable that the wedding of
Miss Fanny Crocker and Mr. McCreary will
be an Easter event. No date for the mar
riage has yet been ; arranged owing to the
absence of Mr. McCreary's mother, who is
visiting at Honolulu for the benefit of her
health. . /-' â -, b.;b b- \y â â 
â¢ On Thursday Mrs. H. M. A. Miller gave
an elaborate luncheon at the residence of
her mother, â  Mrs. . Jones, on Pine street,
complimentary to Mrs. Sherwood, who ;is
visiting here from her home in \ Spokane.
The table decorations were all in peach and
apple blossoms. Covers were laid for six

LATEST
FASHION GOSSIP
FOR WOMEN
AND MEN.
MANY are the rumors of interest
ing engagements which will be
very shortly announced, and
all our belles, as a result, are
anticipating an exceedingly
bright Eastertide, and I sincerely trust
they may not be disappointed, and that
the various resorts will be unusually gay
this summer is a safe prediction. ' The
meeting of the Fortnightly during the
past week was very successful, as were
also the card parties and the pretty but
small tea at which about twenty guests
were entertained.
It is quite the thing to discuss trous
seaux, and one lovely girl, soon to become
a bride, has rarely perfect taste, which she
has always exhibited even as a bud. All
her gowns are to be models of simplicity;
but even the most insignificant are to be
lined with exquisitely tinted silks, and
her house gowns are revelations of what
dressmakers can accomplish, and make it
very apparent that it is not necessary to
send across the continent or to Europe for
satisfactory clothing. It is no longer the
style, for those who can afford it, to wear
anything even at home not composed of
the richest fabrics, which are truly ad
mirable when made without ornamenta
tion with long flowing draperies. Two or
three materials are not infrequently used
in combination.
Cashmere is again to be worn in the
house, and is of a very superior weave, and
may be had. in every shade imaginable.
A mohair crepon is a fabric being much
asked for, as it is correctly considered
more satisfactory than cashmere, and for
evening wear great will be the demand for
all sorts and kinds of fancy gauzes, which
will be made up over silks or satins into
ideal dresses.
The rumor that black and white is to be
the "age for spring wear is now confirmed,
for all the clothes direct from Paris that
are not black and white are white and
black, while frequently black is seen faced
with white, and some especially fetching
models are made of black and white check.
The small blade and white check, com
mercially known as shepherd's plaid, is a
delightful fabric in its way, and : should be
bou.ht in tweed and not in a material of
a light texture. Undoubtedly it is most
effective when faced with black, and worn
over white shirts, or those which have a
broken line of black on a white ground.
There are many varieties of detached
motifs in the grass-cloth guipure in jet em
broidery and in brorierie anglaise. Many
are sold in sets of threeâ graduated. The
most artistic results in muslin are pro
duced by light guipure effects. The Bre
ton laces are again coming in. Great
quantities appear in a single frock, as they
are gathered and very full. Spotted Va
lenciennes, Brussels, Ohantilly and appli
que are to be used in the same way, and as
butter lace is found to be more .adaptable
than dead white ;it will be first choice.'
Tambour laces are also revived. Many old
patterns-are to be seenâ such as the Etrus
can and Swiss embroideries of . several
kinds. Many laces appear on new foun
dations, among which are the wire -rounds
and the cherry ones, and one of the latest
novelties reported are the Astrakan laces,
disks in the pattern representing the fur.
These, I hear, are almost all carried out in
geometrical designs. : Very lovely are the
laces embroidered in the many colored
Eilks. Some have but ope color to outline
the pattern. V4Nw&9%&S&
At present in Paris there is a sad' lack of
good plays on the boards, even at the prin
cipal theaters, so the feminine portion of
the audiences have to "content themselves.
1 with criticizing what is worn, as what is
supposed to constitute the plot of say
M. Meilbac's new play, "Grosse Fortune,''
is not worthy of much thought, and even
Mile. Bartet, the leading lady, is said not
to exhibit her usual excellent taste in the
selection of the materials which compose
her costumes. However, they are all
handsome dresses/worthy of description.
The one worn in the first tret is very simple,
being of rose pink crepon over a beautiful
quality of glace of the same shade. Lace
adorns the neck and . wrists and a
ribbon of satin the waist. The sec
ond ! toilette is of , white ', and gold
brocade opening at the sides and in front
over pleated mousseline -de soie. The
sleeves are of mandarine velvet richly em
broidered in gold, and are very much ad
mired. Miss Bartet shows a fancy for odd
sleeves in strong contrast to her gowns,
and in many ! cases the results are not
happy. -A- gorgeous evening robe is next
exhibited. It consists of alternate stripes
of yellow moire and , pink roses ; : upon a
white ground. The bodice is of pink satin
covered with" lace. The! sleeves are of a
double fall of lace. The tea sown worn by
this actress justified the price charged for
itâ s6ooâ the front being of mousseline de
soie literally - covered Y with Parisian dia
monds. The back is of bright yellow satin
embroidered -. with scarlet ; and red roses.
The sleeves are of the mousseline de soie
caught up with roses and choux of ribbon.
Critics remark concerning this robe that
anything more vast would be difficult to
imagine. - __â¢â '__- O'y . '-
In the same play Mile. Brandes appeared
in an exceedingly tasteful frock of /Nile
green mirror -velvet; exquisitely, cut. but
-imply/made. The skirt was; perfectly
plain, just sweeping : the ground at V the
back. The bodice was cut in a low square
back and front, and the sleeves reached the
wrists: Pale -pink roses and white lace
encircled the decolletage, and at the left
side was a large bunch of Parma violets.
Her ball dress also excited admiration,
being of satin of ' a' crevette shade embroi
deied with branches of drooping glycine
worked in gold." The sleeves were of c- lace.*
Over this was worn an opera cape of ; white
mousseline fde soie, with ; three s bands '. of
embroidery inserted within half a yard of
the hem. The upper " part % was ; composed
of a deep fall of lace from the shoulders in
the form of a pelerine sewn upon a square
eropiecement of pearl embroidery.;. White
. ostrich leathers completed the collar. '.
I have just heard of a delightful gown
recently ; worn by the : new -Â±)uchess 'i de
Vendome (nee i Princess Henriette). It
was a brcche silk in rose color and silver,
had a pointed court bodice artistically
draped with embroidered lisse /laid over
pale-blue satin,'' the sleeves being of the
same, with insertion bands of the lisse and
silver â¢- ribbon. â  -Panel i of ' the s blue.? satin

.'.-It has long been permissible for men to
wear a Tuxedo : coat at home for dinner,
so now in Europe women who have worn
elaborate tea gowns (which were really
nothing more nor less than: stylish Prin
cess gown's) at sucn functions ; now hail
with joy. the tea jacket, which is certainly
an advance upon the tea gown," as it offers
several advantages, being more becoming
to most women and 'less (expensive, thus
admitting of many changes, It takes up
but little room when packing and is readily
slipped on, and it certainly is a novelty
which at once recommends it to our con
sideration. It is usually composed of silk,
satin, or any rich - fabric, in combination
with lace, mousseline ;de soie or chiffon,
and fits closely but comfortably. So we
may look for a long reign of this new con-
fection.
The very handsome jacket given you
this week is of black brocade, the ; pattern
outlined in jet; : fronts of ? gray satin : em
broidered with steel and silver, and an ap

b THE SAT? FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 22, 1896.
- Many bodices are to be braided; and silken
: braid : outlined with 'â¢ a - narrow . threadlike
gold cord is being much used. y3E&ft&ggÂ£
Chatelaine bags in \ the richest of ,bro
cades : and ; velvets are '; in" great demand,
being especially. valued when the owner's
crest or j monogram adorns them. They
make most appropriate gifts.
.Beige batiste gowns I recommend which
have the bodice made without lining, and
the : skirt separate from a silk petticoat of
the same shade. The skirt for such a skirt
is gored and plain. The bodice should tbe
wound with seven half-inch tucks : in ' a
horizontal cluster across 'â â â . the back from
arm to arm and fits quite flat to the figure.
The fronts match; being : tucked ;on the
same line and fitted flat to the waist. .The
same "" croup of tuckings is seen in the
eigot : sleeves ", and the line } must -be un
broken from waist to " sleeves. ;", Cuffs and
waistband of black satin always produce a
satisfactory effect and the [ neckband is
composed of lace and mull, with graduated
jabot of s lace on the front of the corsage.
â¢Various ribbons make a pretty change and
fancy " jeweled belts are frequently worn
instead of ribbon one*. .
It has been well -said, "Simplicity must
be the stamp of distinction," for that, in
| connection with taste, will make " the sim
j plest frock a thing of beauty; and during
'â < these bright Lenten days what more lovely
bit of fancy work can dainty fingers find
to do than to stitch and ruffle pretty
fichus; as an unlimited number will be
worn for many months, and the historic
gown of black satin is to be relieved with
these pretty trifles. Those of old lace are
the choicest, but not to be despised are the
many made of chiffon or mousseline de soie.
A creamy white one, edged with lace, ": is
excellent, but if it cannot be afforded a
j ruffle of the same ; is ; effective. A toilette
J can be wonderfully improved by a white
jor pale yellow fichu: Our ' belles will not
' be slow to appreciate the charm of these
charming toilette adjuncts once they learn
I how. to arrange them properly. *
A fete dress designed for the Riviera is
I worthy of a description, being of heliotrope
; taffeta shot with green, enhanced with
j blouse fronts and : choux 'i bows in ':-. wnite
j pleated ; ; crape. â  The (â¢ side â  of the blouse,

Sad to relate, dresses of grass linen are
| going to be common and the smart women
| .will only tolerate them' i when made by an
j artist, over silk, and* then, of course, they
j cost just as much " for the making 5 as ' any
; other sort of \ frock, but i the \ mora ent gar
: ments are to be had .'.'ready made" by the
j hundreds they cease to be i desirable, and
! the simple but chic little; toilets made at
! home are in far better taste. 'Aim at mdii
i viduality, ' but do not . imagine you are
j proving yourself to ybe - artistic '. by going
; around in frocks . fit , only for the* family
j circle. One .strikingly 'pretty girl' here is
j usually alluded to with a simile or spoken
I of as a frump, because she insists on wear
ing; garments designed by herself/which;
she ; consider? .-,â  highly : effective, - when, in ;
reality, not one of them s should be worn
outs-de^of her j home, and f. in Â¥ reply, to | all
: ; well-meant suggestions she invariably re
| plies : that she "prefers to be â â â  artistic f in
| stead,, of . being stylish." My dear "' young
i woman,'; did any - one ever â¢ tell you that
lit ,is v possible %to>be ibo ? y But/; truly,
[ it takes all sorts â¢ of people to make up our
i little world, and how dull y it. would be
without a ; sprinkling of cranks and â¢ fad
dists! ,yy,y: *. : *
There is a scrap of news just from New
York which will i make us all pause and
consider and tit; is 'this. ;? There iis 4 a de
cided; movement to i; supplant the shirt
â  waist and blouse by a pique vest bodice,
which 2 may be \ made round or pointed,
with a short basque in the back. With a
skirt and jacket the results are excellent.'
-Vogue says:.' ,".<-*. '.'-.
fb/A corn-yellow or ; buff pique vest bodice
will be in good taste for beige color or blue
material. If the vest is pointed it should
.be buttoned in front. When the waist is
f round; a band \of J cream-white : lawn i em-
; broidery laid flat over " the bust, an entre
deux or Jv insertion with finished edges,
having below the square a perpendicular
band tapering into the girdle,' which looks
best, by the way, in black or white satin
ribbon.?; A buckle or two large buttons for
finish. 2 A pique j. fitted necKoand,
high,*' is attached to the vest bodice and
rolling over is ?at satin collar in two parts
to match the 'j belt, either black' or white
satin. Nothing ?'<: could > be - simpler cr
smarter than' this gown. Its style may be
made to conform ; through change 'of ma
terial, color and: trimming to 'a desirable"
toilette "i for sa f . woman f. of mature years,
either in black or colored silks, plum color
mohair or foulards in mixed colors. YY Y.
y During the past week several good dresses
were ; noted : at \ Del Monte. ; One ;of "j black*
mohair, made with a plain skirt, had an
Eton jacket with i deep collar of s revers of
embroidered grass / linen, of which the
blouse _ was also '- composed ; deep "*' cuffs
matched the revers.' it A black satin ribbon
encircled aâ ; pretty waist and ' ended in â  a
well-tied, bow. YY yb-'b- b~''b -b ../'â '
: â  A gray â  serge dress, with : collars, cuffs
and waistcoat of cadet blue cloth, was well
made. The coat was rather long; : ' a belt
crossed the back and then vanished. A
stylish 'English walking hat of dark blue,
with two dark blue quills, was worn. A
tourist appeared in; a tailor suit of a new
weave of cloth, blue in color; relieved
only with a thread-like braid of gold, six
rows 'of which were //in/Y the .collar;
I and ; the little waistcoat '.was* very
prettily embroidered ly with â  ' it ; The
smallest gold â¢ buttons imaginable gave
the â¢-'. finishing touch. : * The V- â¢ dress y was
made / over, deep orange-colored silk;
around the bottom of the skirt were trim
mings of a silk which ; changed from/ blue
to orange. Such a simple ; frock, but one
that cost just $150. V Indeed we have to pay
well for style and finish. /â¢ At last there is a
marked tendency to do away with the odd
-waist for . street and % traveling wear,
although very numerous are " the 1 fancy
ones worn at home and in the evening. b;
A chestnut-haired girl last evening was
a picture good to look at in', a;. bodice of
pale-gray silk; which was crossed with the
gayest of plaid stripes ;in ; green, red.blue
and yellow ; her ; skirt was of the same
shade of gray as the ground of the waist.
A soft collar of crimson velvet finished the
neck; and the elbow sleeves had a small
roll of velvet around them.-. -V.V
Easter is coming, so I -may: remark for
the benefit of those who intend to purchase
new dancing or full-dress slippers that the
insteps are b to /be trimmed- with rather
small bows, prettily â â '. beaded. ; In i patent
leather the Biucher tie has a wide ribbon
bow. i Oxhide is being used for house shoes
and they ; are lined with ? curled lam
wool. â  '- yyy . .
In Paris veils of rose pink with peach
dots are to be seen and also dotted colored
net veiling in ; brown, yellow ' and ; blue.
White veils of all sorts and kinds are in
demand, and all : Paris h as "; become : en
thusiastic over the big hats trimmed with
white and colored tulle. Alas, we: shall
only be able to wear such hats out of San
Francisco unless we can afford fresh tulle
every time we encounter a fog or a cloud
of dust, so for those who I remain in the
City much during our windy season I al
' ways recommend 'â â .. smart, chic, compact
hats, which cannot act as dust traps, and
eschew feathers. Those who attended the
first openings of the most fashionable mil
liners were, as the boys say, "in luck," for
an unusually excellent collection '/ of ' hats
were in view. : I saw sufficient to be able
to ,say that the hats selected showed on
the whole good taste, all styles having
been consulted, for one dream of achapeau
worthy of Virot was gay with exquisite
flowers,: and choux of tulle nestled here
and there. y Its next door .neighbor was a
quaint Quakerish hat in an entirely ;< new
weave of straw, and . on it were flowers of
the softest mauvre shades the f osprey,
gave the ; necessary tone of > color, being
black. And speaking of subdued .shades
reminds me that it is conceded ; this season
is to be a Quakerish one, as numerous are
to be the gowns in grays, tans and browns.
To return to my subject, I have observed
that bonnets will be very broad | round the
face, for we are to wear our hair a la Pom
padour, and wreaths of roses; minus their
foliage are among the novelties, and violets
are seen as much as : ever by themselves,
nestling among their cool green leaves, and
also combined with roses. .
The fancy straws are very numerous,
and are woven or run ' with gay-colored
ribbons or chenille;' and be sure," girls, to
select your hats first, then : : your * gowns
that are to go with them, as they are really
the first consideration, and if you can only
afford to spend - $18 or $25 in headgear;se
cure one good hat, instead of f two or three
nondescript " affairs. There ? . has * been an
idea out here that in New York hats can:
be had much more reasonably than out l
here. This is positively absurd, for a sim
ple stylish hat ' of brown straw, with two
bows of soft brown satin-ribbon and a good
cock's* feather * in ,:; shaded , browns -, and
blacks! : is ' considered very reasonable "in
New York for $16, and of course this hat is
suitable for unceremonious occasions only.
More dressy ones cost from '$26 upward.
This I: quickly discovered when last in
New York, for on pricing a simple black
chip hat with a large bow of black - satin
and a little good lace," I was promptly in
formed by the milliner, who. by/ the, way;
was not quite one of * the swellest ?in â  that
city, that she could let me have it for $24,
and absolutely could not ; even trim me a:
plain white sailor; with a blue ribbon and ;
two quills for less than $16. so since then I .
have fully believed] the Eastern woman
who declared that she could purchase im- '

ported models more reason ably here than
anywhere ; else fin f America, and ** let jme
quote] a seasonable remark: "The choice
of a hat is not such a trifling matter. Let'
none i' of "us deal i too * lightly ./.with * it, but
seek to find one that; becomes I the I, wearer,
and adds â  a crowning glory to her stylish
new costume."."' I, however, only Â» differ,
on (one ? point I r believe in first securing
the hat. : . ' '^j^SBBSSB^sM
; AH the new millinery shows many com
binations 'of black * and "-. white and black
with ecru. Black \ straws j, trimmed with
scarfs of black and white tulle are in great
vogue. The * newest \ toque is -'called a the
mob-cap toque; and it is to/be seen made
of black glace silk, lined with green satin
and ; trimmed with \ ostrich tips. "J" Hereto
lore glace silk has not been used in this
way. ; A great feature in the latest millin
ery ;is horse-hair lace, ornamented? with
pailettes,^ which has to:; be woven on the'
same pillowas torchon. As a result horse
hair '" will i command \ a '<â¢ larger price * than
usual, as it is in great demand, veils from
eighteen to twelve inches wide are neces
sary for the large hats,' and again the black
nets I with * white spots will v. be â  worn. A
correspondent says ecru muslin is mingled
even with black lace,* and the most charm
ing capes to shoulders have been prepared
in b this ; fabric â especially in V black $ and
ecru, with V cord to emphasize the pattern.
; Hatpins are V- considered very choice
when they are jeweled or enameled; but to
be quite the thing they must now represent
buttercups, : daisies ' or some spring "i posy ;
but must be very small in size and perfect
in coloring. V Speaking of bonnet and hat
pins : reminds .me X that" I "often ' shudder,
when I see; mothers holding ; their babies
in their arms with the 'end of -a Jong 'pin
sticking out from their/hats; which is fre
quently within quarter of an inch of baby's
eye. / Really they should be more careful.]
It is a matter of "much wonderment to: me
that half ; a dozen children do not daily;
have their eyes put out * â "â¢â¢'.'
At tbe present' moment a small round
biscuit sprinkled with cheese is a favorite

lar superstition this gentleman believed in

A TALE PROM THE SEA.
As the stars my their courses bought
against Si-era;' so the waves of the sea rise
up to bear witness against that great hea
thenâthe monopoly. In another; column
we publish a letter written by an official of
the Southern Pacific Company, giving an
account of a little business transaction of
that company^ This letter was thrown
into the sea that it might be destroyed, for
there was in it. the statement of a profit
worse than Jonah, but the ocean waxed
wroth at the desecration of its waters arid
indignantly hurled the letter back to land
again. .. ' :
This letter rejected of the sea we com
mend to the reading of the general public.
In it an official of the Southern Pacific
Company, states in plain ' terms . that the
company charged and received $1586: in
return for. a service for which it would
have been grossly exorbitant to charge
$500. Is it any wonder the ocean refused
to take into its bosom and hide any such
outrageous trade secret as that?
The Pacific has nothing in common" with
tbe monopoly that has so insolently
usurped its name. It can tolerate the
sea serpent, the octopus and thehogfish,
but it cannot tolerate -Mr. Huntington's
business accounts. Such records/would
indeed, the multitudinous seas desecrate.
They would blacken the translucent green â¢
of the far-rolling billows, and in place of
milky foam would crown their surging
crests with a scum like that of the bilge
water that lies in the foul recesses beneath
the holds of rotting ships.
There is something like the * hand ; of an
avenging Nemesis in the power that brings
this letter from the sea back to the people
of California at this juncture. It would
have been exorbitant, says the officer of
the company, to. charge $500 for the ser
vice, and yet the. charge was $1586. It is
not strange that of the books and records
of the business of this company some
were buried, some are hidden and some
were thrown into the abysses of the ocean.
It is ; by reason of such ; charges as these
that palaces on Nob Hill are raised, foreign
princes subsidized, African railroads pro
moted, while all the time the company re
mains too poor to pay its debts, its interest
dues or its taxes.
â¢ "I can call spirits from the vasty deep,"
said Owen Glendower proudly, but he was
silenced when Hotspur asked him "Will
they come?" In this case they have come.
Though the Southern Pacific Company
thought they had sunk this record deep as
ever plummet sounded it has come up to
torment them. "We have received $1586
for this service, and it would have been
grossly exorbitant to charge $500 for it."
That is the way the official told it, and,
when the record was thrown to the sea,
the spirit of the vasty deep rose up un
called and gave it to the world.
HE OAKLAND HARBOR.
The people of Oakland have abundant
reason to rejoice over the notice issued by
Colonel Charles R. Sutter that' the Secre
tary of War proposes to consolidate the
Webster-street and Alice-street draw
bridges over the Oakland estuary, and to
â¢ erect a modern steel bridge in their place
with a draw of 150 feet operated otherwise
than by hand." This means that the stub
born obstacles which the Southern Pacific
Company oppose to the free. use of the
estuary for water traffic are to be abolished.
Should the Supreme Court sustain the de
cision by Judge Ogden awarding the water
front to Oakland the victory of the city
will be complete and its commercial im
portance assured. .
The General Government at last seems to
have been awakened. to the splendid har
bor facilities of Sari Francisco Bay. There !
can be little doubt that under the pressure
being brought to bear by the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce Congress will
make an appropriation for the removal of
sunken rocks dangerous to navigation.
The State of California is ably arid intelli
gently doing its part in developing the
best efficiency of the harbor, as it is steadily
constructing a seawall on the" San Fran
cisco side and is beginning the erection of
a superb ferry building at a cost of $000,000.
The benefits which California would re
ceive from the improvement of the harbor
and the encouragement of shipping are of
minor* importance when compared with
the great national interests involved.
This bay is one of the most* interesting
sheets of water in the world. The greater
part of it is shoal and unfit for navigation,
but all that is required for commerce is for
tunately self-dredging through the action
of the tides, and hence can never shoal and
will never require heavy expenditures for
keeping it in perfect condition. 'It would
be better if the broad stretch of water â in
the southern . end were converted into
land, leaving such needful channels as
those to the; various shipping points all
the way : around from Oakland to Baden."
The marshes bordering the bay constitute
in themselves an empire, and in good time
they will be reclaimed arid devoted to agri
culture, to assist in maintaining the dense
population that must line the shore in
the years to come. .
\ It is not difficult to foresee the time when
i this splendid bay, backed as it is by the
, most fertile country in the Union and con
: stituting the "entrepot of the United States"
for the trade of the Orient, will ae3 its
shore lined with great cities of which tho:e
â  already in existence are hardly a begin
ning. No transient hindrances to transpor
tation can operate against this destiny.
THE WORLD'S < UK REST.
; Something ; has occurred of late to make
the civilized Â» world restless, uneasy and
discontented and to threaten disturbances
of every kind, from diplomatic interpella
tions and quarrels to actual war. b At' the
present moment " there "is no nation in
Europe which can . promise : itself assured
peace for the . next decade, arid even . the
United States, having always in mind the
warning of Washington against entangling
alliances, finds ; itself necessarily, compli
cated with the affairs of the Western Hem
isphere and [called upon to make the Mon
roe doctrine an absolute entity in place of
a mere political abstraction.
That .apart, ';â  howeverâ for this country
can take care of itselfâ the condition ;of
Europe is such as to cause serious [ appre
hension to [any one who 'believes in peace
in "preference to war band who! main
the proposition that only as a last resort
should there be an * appeal to arms. To
such a one, studying the question from an
outside point, i looking at â  interna-*
tional differences and disputes with a dis
passionate ; eye, there can Ibe neither logic,
reason nor good sense in the probability
of a ; general European war. and yet > the
fact of such' a thing stares every one in the
face who studies the existing condition of
affairs. *
; Assuming, then, as we must, that there
exists a feverish condition, a state of gen
eral unrest, an intense and continually ex
aggerated , [international! * jealousy" ; arid
rivalry,' it becomes - a matter of interest to
inquire \ into causes .. arid ; reasons .arid i* to
find out, if ' we > can* why, in this 1 age [of
the world, and with i all the material ad
vances and improvements of which we
boast,* the civilized : world should 'be [ dis
contented, unhappy, miserable and pov
erty-stricken, and â¢ why socialism' and its
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL* SUNDAY, MARCH 22, 1896.
base-born brother anarchy, should *' make
such rapid strides and come so near over
taking the rule of law and order. ...
'For this state of â¢" things a great * many
causes "â  have been 'suggested.'-' One urges
overproduction ; b '. but ' . â  how , can * suc h
a thing be V when V Kansas b arid. Ne
braska ;? farmers .! are :, burning ; their - corn
for fuel, while in Southeastern Europe
people are y starving â¢ fori want of cereal
food ;of any .-sort?, Another declare
that the f trouble is that the rich are grow
ing richer and the ' poor poorer; but that
has been so since - the world ; began. â  The
prudent arid thrifty have made themselves
well to do at the expense } of ; the im
provident, and such will be the case ;as
long as the world lasts. There is some
thing more behind all this, which, if it can
be discovered and explained, will - furnish
a solution for the unrest which the world
is feeling at the. present day; and, if a
conjecture may be , ventured, it .Will be
found in the vexed question of moneyâ
that is, metallic r money, considered -as a
medium of exchange. â ' 'â¢* 'â¢" -- â¢ â  ' '
Whatever; may have been said ; upon
the subject, an era of contraction of
the currency means hard . times, V and
an era of inflation means good times.
It is true that \ inflation may = be 'â¢ car
ried to excessâ that there may be made
extravagant promises to pay which it will
take a generation to redeem â but none the
less it is true that, as between inflation
and contraction, the former produces : the
better results, arid puts the â¢ body politic
! into a healthier and- more active condi
: tion. The United States, with all its vast
resources, 'is . suffering ' from ,-". a - policy [of
contraction, winch is., not only 'un pardon-'
able and -; inexcusable, ) but almost . crim
inal; and when the history of this Nation
comes to be written, in" due time; .the
record of the Cleveland administration
will stand out as a stain upon our banner
and as an adjunct to the misrule and con-;
fusion which mark the history of civiliza
tion at the close of the nineteenth century.
AN ODD COMMUNITY.
; An uncommonly interesting proposition
has reached the California > State Board of
Trade from a representative "of a number
of deaf mutes in lowa. It is that if a
suitable: place can be found in this State
the deaf mutes will settle it in colony.
The naive letter which the deaf mute has
written for information contains this para
graph: "We must be near a running
stream and on a soil naturally adapted to
the raising of corn. . The colonists would I
like also to engage in gardening to some |
extent. -jj&SMfeÃfÃ
V The cheerfulness, industry and sweet- â¢
ness of temper generally possessed by deaf j
mutes make them highly desirable as !
settlers. In colony they would be much
better off than in the hearing of the speak
ing world, for in such association -they,
would suffer under no disadvantage what
ever. Their natural sociability could be
gratified better in this way than any other.
And where - could they find ' Keener en- j
joy ment and prosperity than in California?,
Being intelligent arid "eager readers they
could inform themselves " of the best
methods of agriculture peculiar to this
State, and their infirmity would in . no j
sense burden their "ability to secure the i
best possible results from the industry. I
As most of them have beiri educated in j
some useful craft they could form an ideal j
colony able ; to \ supply all its ; own wants j
and sell their surplus products. By
planting canaigre, which has already been
proved to yield marvelous crops: in; this
State, they could produce tanning material
arid thus establish the complete industry [
of tanning hides and manufacturing shoes. '
A large number of them are expert broom- j
makers. Our soil produces bounteous bar- i
vests of bro.mcorn. Claus Spreckels is
offering to give sugar-beet seed to all who j
will cultivate the plant. Such a colony as
tbat here suggested might make a fortune
out of that enterprise.
Thus established - they could have the
best possible facilities for educating deaf
mutes arid converting them into producing
citizens. ; All who cannot hear and speak
would be attracted by such a colony, and
hence the community might' be expected
to grow with great rapidity and its mem
bers to" flourish as they never have flour
ished before. They would .be removed
from the disturbing influences which tend

SOME PREGNANT PACTS.
During the first eighteen months of its
active ; , operation the . revenues derived
under the Wilson-Gorman tariff were $75,-;
000,000 less than the - running expenses of
the Government, and nearly 000,000
less than the revenue received from cus
toms duties during the first eighteen
months of the McKinley tariff..
Under the McKinley tariff there was im
ported into this; country during . the year
1894 â : about $65,000,000 worth of ; staple arti
cles of farm produce, b"ut in -1895, "j under
tbe present tariff, the â  imports of such
products;' aggregated \\ $134,000,000, repre
: senting a loss ' to , the American ' farmer of
about $70,000,000 in a single year. " ; :'
It is not possible to escape the obvious
conclusion from - such facts as these. The
Democratic party, appealing chiefly to the
farmer on the ground ; that a protective
tariff worked to the detriment of his in
terests, has deliberately- bunkoed him,
tafcen money out of his; pocket and put it
into the coffers .of Canada, ; Central and
South ? America, France, Germany, Spain
arid 'ltaly,' and yet demands that , the
American farmer shall still vote the Demo
cratic â  ticket, aid in , retaining a poor,
inefficient . and ridiculous tariff \ and \ take
his chances -in that great arid ; glorious
future 'of which the free-trader dreams,
when the gospel of .cheapness shall be the
only rule of action for the civilized world.
- If there be State in the Union which
is or should sbe '" logically and consistently
"protectionist-it is California, YWe cannot
conceive of a (Californianiridustry; unless
it be gold mining, which does not demand
the ; fair and just j protection-; of the laws
â  against undue foreign competition. Agri
culture, V horticulture and Â£ manufactures,
wish : the ; vast amount of labor they in
volve, must " be protected > against cheap
foreign production"' or ; they must go to the
.wall. When it costs only about one-third
as much to transport raisins 'i from Malaga
to New York as from Fresno to New York ;â 
when oranges can be brought from Italy
and compete on more : than , even ; terms
with ; the ; product ; . of I Southern" California;
and when free wool has more than deci
mated our l flocks* arid; herds' it is time for
tho people of California ;to do some think
ing for themselves, and we may; be assured
that they, rin common ; with the rest of the
United States, will not neglect the oppor
tunity which the Presidential and 5 Con
gressional elections ;. of b the present | year
offer them. The time is fully ripe for a
return to the regime of a wise , and en
lightened policy of protection, , arid-; No
vember next will see the free-trade fallacy
swept away [ and I buried beneath a monu
ment of ballots so completely that it can
riot be resurrected for half a century.

WHY GO. TO ALASKA?
There are Tons of Golp in the Mountains
op California.
; To the Editor of -the San Francisco Callâ
It seems strange that men will rush away to
to the northern wildsâ almost to the Arctic re
l gionsâ in ; a- most disagreeable r climate in
search for gold, and ignore the great, prolific
and to a large extent unprospected and unde
veloped gold fields of our own ? glorious State.
California has , produced more : than $1,000,
--000.000 in gold, and were half the energy and
; half the capital employed in "gold mining in
, the vast unexplored ; gold â  fields of . the State
! that is being done in Alaska, Colorado, Africa
j or Australia, the results would surpass any
j thing ever Known", in the world. J Tne develop-
I ment â¢' of ; the thousands of auriferous quartz
| lodes throughout the great gold belt of Cali
i forniaâ the same being the source of the rich
placers heretofore- workedâ would result in a
yield of gold that would make the "days of .'49",.
â  seem like a very tame affair. ;; ,;-:*â¢â  . V
; ; ,; The writer spent nearly twenty years along
the Rocky Mountains ; and several years in
I British Columbiaâ Cariboo, Cassiar
and American ' districtsâ and has I spent only
one year in California.***' Yet in that brief time
he has beheld. geological facts proving Califor
nia the most profitable gold-mining region on
the continent., I say, Why go to Alaska when
millions may be obtained near home? yy
Is Alaskan gold better than California gold?
Not so at the United State? Mint. It all goes at
$20 67 per ounce (1000 fine), and it appears
folly to me that men will roam, the northern
wilds after gold when far more can be obtained
In onr own genial climateâ rightrhere in Cali
forniaâthe most prolific I and extensive | gold
belt the world has ever known. As a practical
prospector I can go into the mountains of Cali
fornia and discover a good-paying; quartz lode
[ (I have done so) every week during ten months
i in the year, free milling ore going $10 to $100

the writer knows of thousands and tens of
thousands of acres of -. rich gravel beds where
hydraulic mining can be clone (and ;is being
dene) to immense profit. Â ', There are millions
in it! and, after many years gold mining else
where, the writer must | say California 1 (is still

SEVEN MEN IN ; ONE.
>V AN FRANCISCO has produced a '
SAN FRANCISCO has produced a ''.
philosophical writer whose books
tyy) deal with "(the: highest of ; human ;
-^--^ aspirations and the most profound
of human thoughts. Dr. Je
rome A. Anderson's works go beyond
what are commonly known as the
material sciences and mere speculative
thought. It will : avail' us nothing to
pass them by slightingly in favor of
the. lighter literature that tasks the
gray matter less to appreciate, for
these thoughts and aspirations are
fastening themselves even upon this lighter
literature and.are coming into our daily
lives, whether ;we will or no. Men may
cry for Intellectual peace, but there will be
none. There will be less as the years go on,
and the tide will not turn toward mental
peace until human science has . classified
and named the last phenomena of which
nature is \ capable. Last week we read
that photographs could be taken through
solid substances. Yesterday Edison told
us he could see through a two
inch plank. What will to-morrow
bring forth? In spite of ourselves
we must think, and .we will think
about these verities and subtleties of na
ture, and those who begin to think before
circumstances compel them to will be the
better equipped for the entire struggle
which, perhaps, does not cease with the
shuffling off of the body. This, at least,
is the view taken by the author of the
book, "Septenary Man," and it is no
more novel or modern a view than is the
theory that the human being is com
posed of seven separable parts; func
tions upon seven separable planes. The
latter theory, though almost sensa
tionally new to the Western world,
is in reality as old as the theory of im
mortality, which indeed it seems to eluci
date and make rational to the understand
ing not satisfied with dogmatic faith. Dr.
Anderson makes no claim to originality
in dividing man into sev^n parts, but in
sists rather that "the Vedantic schools
-of Brahmanism held and still hold that
man has at least four or five principles or
vehicles or consciousness entering into
his composition; Buddhism recognizes
seven; Confucianism five; Gnosticism sev
en; the Kabala seven, and Christianity
three. The same teaching can be very
clearly verified in the old Egyptian sym
bolism and in the earlier, as well as the
later, Greek philosophy, particularly, in
Neo-Platonism."
Dr. Anderson presents â¢ the following
septenary formula :
sthula Sharira, the body.
Linga Sharira, astral body.
Prana, vitality.
Kama, the animal soul (desire).
Manas, the human soul (thought).
Budhi, spiritual soul (intuition). -
Atma or spirit. '
Starting upon this hypothesis, explain
in? the nature of each of these seven parts,
and citing evidence of their reality, the
author treats at length and in clear, well
chosen language this subject that to the
Western world is still occult and mysti
cal, tboueh surely no more so than
the ability to sec " through " a two
inch plank * was a month ago.
What makes the book of value for the
non-scientific reader is the fact that its
author affects rather a simple style and
employs homely English words y and
phrases wherever possible.
The first four of these seven principles
are known as the Lower Quaternary
and the last three as the Higher Triad.
Without the triad man would be nothing
more than a perfected animal. Robbed of
the quaternary, man functions on a plane
imperceptible to merely human faculties.
The triad is divisible only in a metaphysi
cal sense. They are but manifestations of
the egoâ essence of the soul, spirit, life,
God, or whatever name one may know it
by which persists. Though the concep
tions of the higher triad, as set forth in
Dr. Anderson's book, are very beautiful
and some of them " present very - clearly
drawn pictures to the intellect, yet those
* who eschew metaphysical subjectsâ or
think they do will find greater interest
in the author's explanation of the quater
nary, or lower mamas. Here the division
of the principles is real i and in a measure
susceptible of proof to the dullest. Hyp
notism, the phenomena' of the so-called
spiritualistic medium, the well-attested
fact of clairvoyance, sleep, dreams and
many ; other and more strictly physical
phenomena, explanations of which | are
impossible, to 'all but the students of
theosophy, are by this theory of the lower
quaternary made clear and reasonable : to
the mind; are proven by the rules of logic,
at least, if not by ocular demonstration.
There is something fascinating about
this book of Dr. Anderson's, and one
whose curiosity is " sufficiently aroused to
lead him to take it up seriously, or at least
with mind open for the reception of new
truths,' no < matter where I they may lead, |
will not lay it down before finished, and i
will ' have "his appetite : well whetted for
further peeps behind the curtain of the i
purely material world.
What is occult to us to-day may be ,
scientific to us to-morrow. 'Yet it always j
was scientific, and it was our own angle of i
vision that changed. Dr.: "Anderson's j
book is occult only to ; those ,i who" have ;
not turned its -leaves slowly and thought- ;
tally, and those who do this will find it in- j
tensely y interesting at ; least. There ?is
always much human interest in the con
templation of man from a standpoint other j
than that of bones and flesh. Has man a j
â¢ finer, partly invisible, less corporeal body !
a linga sharira ?Y Is this linga sharira, or
astral body. . separable from the .physical i
body? Has man a still, finer, still more!
invisible astral counterpart capable of a j
world-wide separation frorj the corporeal
body? What becomes of these finer astral <
shells when the phenomenon called death !
intervenes? And what is this phenomenon
of death? Questions V like these -are i
answered in "Septenary Man,'' not by j
dogma, <? not by ; empirical platitudes or j
generalities, but by a searching examina
tion of ; - tbe premises, ,: followed Yby * the !
logical . presentation' of a science that is i
much older than* any .'-' western science, i
And this science is not dogmatic. Beyond |
the primary postulate of a supreme intel
ligence behind and in the universe, nothing
is presented 'â * on faith, and . the ; reasoning
faculties alone are appealed to. ,

AT THE SIGN OF THE GUILLOTINE.
As the title half implies, J' At the' Sign of
the Guillotine" is a story of the French
Revolution. The author, Harold Spender,
6as i . introduced characters* and -events of
historical importance. The ; leading part
th tbe story is -played by no less a person
tge r Maximilian Robespierre, whose
"lespotic power; and whose tragic^downfall â¢
ire strongly described. A love ;: story j
forms the centerpiece of t the plot. Robes- [
pierre imagine-! that he has claim (to/ the j
|ahd; of Elise Duplay. who loves and is
loved by Deputy Bertrand Louvier.
Robespierre has not made a 'good lover.*
Self-absorbed in the sentimentalism'of.his
â¢tun passion 'he had quite forgotten ; that'
n romance.'as in war, it takes two to play
I game. - -Love had been to him a decorous
I drama, in which he filled the front of the
j stage while the girl played /a secondary^
j submissive part outside of 1 the glare of the
footlights** Elise, in- fact, had been tho
ornamental fringe to ; his existence a pic
turesque ' idyl, hardly gifted . with I a sepa
rate will or personality. *He : looked â¢â  to
find in her not a ; partner in danger, but a
resting-place V after ; storm, ' built -â  for. his 1 !
special : harboring. This complacent con- !
fidence in his v own powers had; not lent j
strength to his wooing., â -';'
It ignored the chief' factor. It expected j
a surrender without a conquest, a victory
without i a battle. : : Elise - is V a . graceful,
charming brunette. " Her home is the cen- |
ter of-gayeties, ' and she is -betrothed to i
Louvier. She has never â¢ considered the j
love of Raobespierre, yet the latter is J
astounded when.. the revelation comes to
him that he lias a rival. This awakes in
the tyrant a burning desire to possess. ' He
seeks an excuse to slay Louvier, easily
I frames one, and has the Deputy thrown
| into a prison and condemned to the guillo
! tine. As a last resort Elise, to save her
I lover, promises her hand to the tyrant
when peace dawns, sacrificing her" own
l freedom to gain Louvier' sY. reprieve;
j The latter is shocked, to learn of j
j the promise and that .the attempt
ito have him slain was ; inspired by
Robespierre as a rival for the hand of
Elise. He makes war upon the tyrant in
and out of the convention. The overthrow
of Robespierre brings victory in a double
sense to Louvier, for it saves Elise to him.
and the twain, from a distant land of
peace, with calm interest watch* the rise
of Napoleon's star. Edmund- Burke, the
famous British statesman, figures in the
story as the friend of the old order, but
which he would fain have bettered by an
infusion of the best ideas of the new. The
character of the Marquis de Saens, a friend
and genius of the old regime, is also well
drawn. The story is one of much strength,
being intrenched behind a history that is
forever alive with thrilling interest. [New

TOMMY ; TODDLES.
A story of remarkable cleverness ;is
"Tommy Toddles," supposed to be told in
response to the plea of a child for -.â 
A tale of animals and boys, " j v.l
With guns and fights and lots of noise.
The author is Albert Lee, and the book
is as full of interest of a peculiar kind as
an egg is full of meat. < It is a story that
will charm the young, and. moreover, it
will win its way ' with the . big " folk, for
. there are very few of the elder people who
will not want to read "Tommy Toddles"
through if they once start : in. The vol
ume is . quite ;as - attractive as "Alice in
"Wonderland." There are two parts to the
work. - In the . first part, Tommy, grown
I tired of playing with the wooden ani
; mals of his . Noah's ark, becomes
| drowsy while .' sitting on . ,'â â¢. a win
! dow-sill, and is . amazed to see his
I animals suddenly .v.", limber up and
j run away. A sheep"' offers to assist
. Tommy in finding the 'lost. animals,* and
i on their long journey they meet : burglars
and pirates and many. fearful' and wonder
ful beings â the queerest; kind of a creature,
j a Thingumbob; the Welsh rabbit, with a
I body that looks lik* cheese; and ears that
| resemble pieces of toast; and different
i sorts of seals that weep different colors of
sealing-wax. They bear a discussion of
Oysters by Clams, and ; a Stone :. Gargoyle
enchains their attention with ' the account
of a duel between the Penguin and the
Sword fish, wherein the fact is demon
strated that "the Penguin is mightier than
; the Swordtish." Two pieces of rich plum
i pudding are responsible for the first dream.
In . the second part an ex-pirate joins
Tommy on a trip through the corridors of
time, the twain being assisted by t old
Father Time himself. The corridor walls
are covered with pictures, and Tom my
catches a glimpse of Washington crossing
the Delaware and of the battle of Bunker
Hill; he sees the taking of the Bastile and
the great London fire; then . the : Spanish
â¢ Armada and the Crusades, and later, the
burning of Rome, Julius Caesar, crossing
the Rubicon, the siege of Carthage,' the
building of the Parthenon, the de
struction of Troy and the fall of
Babylon, and other things, whiz
past in .' a confused. v blur, .; until the
deluge is reached and Tommy and the ex
pirate enter the ark. ~ The ex-pirate is
prolific of .'â¢''-'â¢'â  little classics "which
he is only too ''eager" to recite
on all., possible occasions ."for Tom
my's instruction." -The lalter's adventures
â in the ark are more wonderful than his ex
periences out of it. He is a guest at a ban
quet of animals of every description, and
"Before he: is' l awakened' he has received a
scare that makes his heart leap into his
throat. The book should be 'a favorite in
the home. Peter S. Newhall has made a
notable success in his "illustrations, which
: are as happily appropriate to the letter of
'< the work as Cruikshank's sketches were to
i Dickens. : [New York: Harper. & Bros.,

IT is generally supposed that rHoyt's
comedies were never intended to be
analyzed. In order to enjoy them
with any vestige of self-respect you
must leave your reasoning faculties at.
home and laugh at the absurd situations
without considering how the plot hangs
together or whether there is any plot at
all. Sometimes the inventive press agent
tries to beguile the public into believing
that Hoyt's plays are profound and in
genious satires on social and economic
conditions as they exist in this enlightened
Republic. But the gentle press agent has
departed from the paths of strict veracity
so often that the most confiding of theater
goers no longer believes him, and people
continue to laugh at Hoyt's comedies
without applying any cathode rays of
criticism to see whether the author has an
underlying meaning.
But just imagine for a moment that
Hoyt really has a skeleton of true satire
beneath his apparently joyous situations.
In that case he has been playing a very
low-down game on the great American
public in "A Milk White Flag," for. re
garded as a picture of morals and man
ners, it is more gruesome than anything
Ibsen or Sudermann ever wrote. Ifâ of
course this is merely a supposition if
Hoyt intended his latest comedy as a
"take-off," one can imagine the saturnine
smile with ; which he watched the public
going into convulsions of laughter over
his outwardly funny but inwardly grue
some situations.
The plot, in its native hideousness, is
som -thing like this: A body of idiotically
vain euardsmen decide to outshine an
other body of idiotically vain guardsmen
by holding a spectacular funeral. In or
der to obtain a corpse they apply to a
fascinating widow, who consents, for a
substantial cash consideration, to sell
them the remains of her dear departed.
While the defunct is lying in state within
the widow flirts audaciously with the gay
guardsmen, and, having caused her 17
---year-old daughter to be disguised as
an infant of tender years, she encour
ages the "child" to sing comic songs
and turn somersaults for the edifica
tion of the guardsmen â all within
a stone's throw of the "remains." So
much admiration does this method of pro
cedure excite that before the evening is
well advanced the widow has succeeded in
becoming engaged to marry several eligible
guardsmen. At the funeral of the "re
mains" the daughter of the defunct ap
pears in gorgeous apparel, and enlivens the
proceedings by singing comic songs. " Of
course, it is all very amusing if you regard
it with due levity, but if Hoyt really meant
"A Milk White Flag" as a take-off on
widows it is about time for him to be "dis
covered" by admirers of the Ibsen school.
"Captain Impudence" is really a very
interesting play, and, apart from a few
absurdities, it contains the son of senti
ment that the public likes to applaud. It
is a pity that the author has subjected his
characters to the indignity of being cast off
and disowned as soon as they have no
further lines to say, however. It was ever
thus in melodramas of the old school,
where as soon as a man ceased to have
speech his fate was, a matter of absolute
indifference to every on. concerned. He
might be dying of thirst, racked by poison J
or slowly shedding his heart's gore, but if
he had no more to say no hand held out a
cup of cold water to his lips, no loving
touch smoothed his clammy brow. He j
expired alone and unnoticed in the corner
of the stage where he fell.
This melodramatic callousness unfortu
nately flourishes in "Captain Impudence."
The soldier who is "wounded in the back" I
tells with halting breath of the prisoners'
, projected escape, and then lies forlornly
by the well, while his companions pass by
on the other side. Even the poor senor
ita, after saying a tender last farewell to j
the captain, rushes off at the sound of j

shots to succor her cousin, who is pre
sumably., dead or wounded. Y> The captain
does ' not even" send an orderly to inquire.
He plunges at once into a sprightly com
edy scene with" another lady, and leaves
the senorita to her fate. A little! care
would easily remedy such incongruities;

they detract materially from : the natural
ness of the play, and "Captain Impu
dence" is so good that one regrets to see
it marred by any of the faults of old
fashioned melodrama.

, -OIK FFIf.KK'S HIT.
| The Famous Da__cÂ«. Marie Her First
Success by Accident.
It is six years since Loie Fuller, the in
ternationally famous dancer, made her
; first hit. She was ; plain ; Loie Fuller then,
: and receiving -probably not" much more
; than a thousand dollars a season. -She;
was/ playing .in; a â  farce I: called ; "Quack,
M.D., ' and the company was in â "- hard
lines. ; Salaries were so far in arrears that
they had been almost lost sight of. It was
in the performance of the piece at Holy
oke. Mass. ' In the first act Loie had to ap
pear as a country girl in long skirts and in
the second act, in tights, to dance. The
I audience at Holyoke was so small that she
didn't think it worth whila to discard
j skirts > for the second act, and so she ap
peared and did her little act with the skirts
over the tights. Then it was that, lifting
her dress, at the sides, a little effect was
produced that subsequently made the ser
pentine dance.; // .*.-'i"i'i.. : /
\ The; audience, small as it was. became
enthusiastic, and the, /actress,^detecting
the/ possibilities, set to work to elaborate
it, with/what success is now .generally
known. Loie has now cut loose altogether
from the : serpentine dance. She has in
vented more ingenious land complicated
effects./- She !is announced in Paris and
London/on the bill board simply as "La
Loie ; Fuller," ; and 'â -. that, I suppose," is* the
way she 'will be billed in this City. But,
just the same, it was at a 'one-night stand,'
j when an -accident started her along a ca
reer that has been, dazzling in dollars, if
not in art." .* :

Why Many New York / Successes Fail
on the Road. *
/ Many actors and actresses of. established;
reputation nowadays "'-' find '. it , extremely,
profitable to remain in New York the year
round, accenting at : extra salary nothing
but so-called "special engagements," which
are always of limited duration, and, giving
them a certain amount of ; leisure between
times. A manager/who has a new play
which he wants to take on the road will, if
he possibly can, produce it in New York
arid/present it here for" two or three weeks
with a particularly strong/cast, especially"
I engaged for the occasion. Of course, the
actors and actresses so engaged \ pet enor
mous salaries for the two or three weeks
they play' but when the piece starts on its
tour through the country/ their -places are
filled by much cheaper people, billboards
displaying the- original eulogistic quota
tions from the New 'York papers as to the
strength of the company. *' '- 'Z%3Bt*9&GG&
'â¢â ,--. That's one reason why the theater
goers /of HarriÃburg, - Pa.,* for ; instance,
often : wonder what in the world the New,
York newspapers could ever have '" seen/ to
praise in a play that to them seems noth
ing but a poorly acted "farce or melodrama
of the worst variety". The Harrisburg cast
isn't the New York one 'by many hundred?
dollars,' and as :'al rule a $30 a week : man"
can't act as well as one who gets $300. . If

A PASTORAL
OF
THE
SPRING
WHEN the warm rains succeed
the driving downpours of the
winter, and the young grain
begins to mantle the mead
ows with tender green, is
the time, of all the year, to go out into
field and canyon and forest. Cool and
dripping, and dim and delicious, just now
are all the woodsy places that a little later
will be, perhaps, not less beautiful in their
warm, maturer loveliness, but certainly
less approachable. It is as if the things of
nature grew sophisticated, as the season
advances. In the early springtime they are
frank and confiding and willingly tell the
secrets of their growth to him who asks.
They have time, then, in the first begin
nings of things, to stop and parley, as it
were, to show their tiny roots and bulbs
and let you study the delicate, tender un
foldings of leaf and bud and blossom. A
month from now they will be too busy
keeping up with the swift march of the
season to gossip and visit/even with the
lovmgest of human friends. Already the
TUE FALSE SOLOMON'S SEAL.
[Sketched from nature.]
warm March sunshine is putting the green
growths in a hurry, and they have taken a
big \ start within the past few days. Baby- '
blue-eyes waked up last week, and the
poppies, the brodisea and blue-eyed-grass
are thick upon the hillsides. The maivus,
the buttercups and all the great crowfoot
family are out, and the spring is fairly
here. ' . . â 
But before any of these had dared show
themselves, down in the canyons and
besides streams in the cool, dim woods,
wake-robiu had already aroused itself
and begun the task assigned it by the
sweet old mythos, *of summoning the
birds. The feathered tribes have heard
the call and are here in force. The last of
the nortbingers has fled and the trees are
melodious with the voices of our own
springtime birds.
Wake-robin ! How one loves that quaint
old name for the triliium, first harbinger
of the springtime. Many of our common
wild flowers have several names, but none
has- such â¢ invariably pretty ones â  as * all
times seem to have united in bestowing
upon this one. "Birthroot our forefathers
called it, seeing the birth of the new year,
in its early blossoming, and how many
generations have known and loved it under
the name given it, time out of mind, the
trinity flower. But as wake - robin it is,
probably best known, and the very breath
of springtime seems to be in the name. - .
A member of the great lily family is the
wake-robin, and it loves damp, shady
places, and moist, rich valleys. Out here
â¢n California we /do not find the strictly J
â¦ypical Eastern variety, but we have a

curiou3 . paucity , of imagination, our bot
anists have called False Solomon's Seal. '
It is something of f a reflection upon our
own mental habits, this trick we have of
falsifying the -plants. -â¢" We sayÂ» "false
asphodel," "false rice," "false hellebore,"
"false" spikenard and miterwort, but the
falsehood is in our own vain - imaginings.
Tne plants are â  as true as the earth that
bears them, or the rain and sunshine that
bring them to perfection. The Solomon's
seal is one lily, the "false" Solomon's seal
another, but we have heaped double insult
upon the pretty innocent, first : through
its popular name, in which we "charge it
with deception, and then by giving it a
generic name which stamps it an imitator,
for the name Smiiacina racemosa was be
stowed on the thoroughly individual little
plant because of a fancied resemblance be
tween its leaves and those of the genus
smilax. Man may be false, the "perilous
godhood of choosing" is his, but the wild
things of the woods are true, always, each
in the order of its nature.
5 Do we forget, from soring to* spring, the
wonderful beauty of the years* awakening?
Each winter of our ; discontent, I think I
remember, as I look forward in ; anticipa
tion, the tender cbarm of all i the spring's
wonder, yet with V each recurring year it
comes to me as a fresh and mysterious
surprise. Note the first early hints of new
growths/as you will, there ' always comes
one day when- one suddenly awakens to
the consciousness that spring has really
come. Some ". date its advent from the
'finding of the first ' poppies, â  but
these often., make V their appearance
in late November. The golden-crowned
sparrow is a welcome and unfailing
harbinger of springtime, but the wake
robin gets here- even before he does.
.We find it early in February about
the bay, . spreading its green leaves
and rearing its beautiful head to; remind
us that the time of quickening has come.
More often than not we have forgotten it. I
We have filled" our lives ; so full ,of com
plexities and problems that it is well for
us to have this annual reminder that even
without our taking thought about it r the
real world, that will be here when we,
with . all , ; our business, Â shall have
gone â  from sight, has ; renewed itself,
and restored itself, and stands bid
ding us V come to her and - find
'peace. ' For Nature keeps open â ".â¢,- house
for us, and even when .we. visit her and
leave a trail of. dirt and desolation behind
us. like stupid and : untidy children,- she
only sets herself to cover and remove it,
"with the silent, persistent patience of her
age-wise motherhood. Down in the can-
[ yon, among the triliium and . loosestrife
and wild potato, I found some picnickers'
inevitable tin can, left to desecrate the
landscape, but r completely covered, and
filled with soft mold, and growing in it a
mass of happy green woodsorrel. This is
better.tban going at things with a broom,
removing tly-mirom one place to another,
which is about as far as we have progressed
with our science of cleaning up. -
*-, There V are no ; complexities* about the
wake-robin. You may.see all there is of it
at a glance. â¢' Its principles are "brief and
fundamental," as wise old MarcusAurelius
charges us to let our own be, and yet the
eg has had its vicissitudes; has met and

Steers -of its i great family, it . grew in Â» the

Then times changed. Lands rose and
waters Bubsided, and the triliium found
itself surrounded by new; conditions. The

Whist
(All communications qoncerhing .whist, an
swers to problems-, etc., should be addressed,
''Whist Editor," Call, City.] x , ['' y y< | '-
When you sit" down at a : table to play a
game of , whist you enter into a copartner
ship with the player that v sits opposite
you; â¢ your partnership consists in combin
ing the 13 cards : that v are dealt \ you with
. his 13, . and playing [ the 26 as though they
were all in one hand, against your adversa
ries' 26. In every deal of whist this must
â¢ be done, and the Whist Column will try and
show you how to do it.
: It is as foolish' to sit down at a whist
table and attempt to play the game without
any knowledge of it as it would be to sit
down at a piano with a sheet of music In
front of you and attempt to - play without
knowinga note.
, How few realize this fact. To become a
whist-player you must do just the same as
you would do if you wanted to acquire any
other 'accomplishment, such as music,
drawing, or the languages; you must study.
We have heard lawyers ; and doctors ' say
with a laugh "I have â  played -â . whist for
years and never looked into a whist book."
How perfectly ridiculous it would - sound
to say in tne hearing of these "gentlemen,
"I have practiced â¢ medicine and daw for
years and never looted into a book on the
subject." A bird can ; fly without wings'
just as easy as one can play whist without
knowing the A'B C of the game, â¢ ..'
The study of whist is different from al
most any other. From- the minute : you
commence to apply yourself the interest
starts, and increases all the time, and to
the student it is "a real enjoyment. Let
us, for example, shuffle 7 a pack of ) cards
and turn up a trump and start; in to play.
The opening of the game, .''the original
lead," is the spark that sets the machinery
in motion, and the battle begins. Mark
well ; this fact: there is only one original
lead made every deal, and, strange to say,
the first card that is played? is generally* a
mistake, and is caused by not knowing the
first letters of the whist alphabet.
. There is no combination or possible com
bination of cards that the opening player
can hold, but there is at least one that he
should lead that will enable his partner to
get a great insight into : his band. V We will
give you ' an . illustration: V You '-.. all * know
that a deuce of -a plain j suit |is the most
worthless card a person can hold. We will
select this tone for him to' lead. And now
listen to its story: Â. - - '
; This little- two spot \ says, "Partner, 1
have not a suit of five cards â : in my hand.
I do not hold the ace and king, or ace
queen jack, or* king queen, or king jack
ten, or * queen jack , ten of this ; suit ;
neither have I got five trumps. I. hold at
most but four cards in it, with possibly the
ace, or king, or queen, or jack, or ten at
the top. One thing is certain it is the best
suit I have got and you must not expect
much ; assistance ; rom ; me in it. The bal- .
ance of my hand â the other nine catds-r,
. are : probably divided in 'â â  tne other : three
suits, with three cards each." ".-,-'"
y This and much more is said, Now,
when such ', a valueless card can say .'so
much what will- other cards say? ' To edu
cated whist-players every one -of the fifty
two cards played each deal speaks with in
telligence, and what "it 'â  says is impressed
upon* the mind through the eyes with as
much confidence as though â¢ spoken by
word of mouth.'
â¢ The opening lead of each deal should be
absolutely "conventional." The hand
should be opened in accordance* with t all
recognized whist principles, in every case,*
from your strongest and best suit if - you
have one," and you should select the proper
card 'to â¢ lead from -that suit. What "- is
meant by your' "strongest and best suit" is.
a suit comprise d of four or more cards at
least.; Now it sometimes I occurs "that the
four-card suit held 'by the ; leader :is four
very small cards of no value, or four very
small trumps. In such a case the leader
has the option of leading from these four
cards or from : a three-card suit; ; both of
these ' leads are "conventional"; there is
no such thing *as a "forced ; lead" in the
opening lead of a deal.' A few hours' study
is all that is required to get this much
knowledge of the game. - We will say here
there is no law to compel a person to play
his cards correctly if he wishes to do other
wise: he is his own free agent ; if he wants
to lead a singleton he has a right to do so.
'' * The essence of all good' whist play <is? to
be able to -read â  your partner's hand and
he yours, and this - will : enable : you to
make every trick .possible ' in each ; ; deal.
Always speak truthfully by the; card you
play; don't deceive your partner in whist
any more than you would in business. ylf

A REVERSAL FOR OLDHAM
The Ukiah Deacon Given An
\other Chance by the, Su- '
preme Court. i yy
EVIDENCE WEONGIY ADMITTED
_______
Confessions of .an ; Accomplice Were
Allowed to Go Before the
Jury.
The order denying a new trial to "Dea
con. David - Oldham,' found guilty of ! con
spiring to â ' rob the Ukiah sta^e," has been
set ' aside by the Supreme Court. Oldham
will have to be tried again. ' .'. .'.'-.'-.
: The grounds upon-, which " the order was
aside were f that f 'the; trial, court had
wrongfully admitted damaging evidence
against the prisoner. The' evidence \ thus
admitted was : : that of the : â : officer ,? who ar- -
rested George Hilton, the actual highway
!man, and to whom Hilton; told practically
the whole scheme. ' .- b y
. : Hilton . held iup the coast- bound stage â 
from Ukiah. There : was $1000 in the
treasury * box, and this he secured and
buried. Some days later ; he : was arrested
in an adjoining county, and to; the officer
arresting him he confessed the crime, and
told "enough to implicate Deacon Oldham,
a church member of Ukiah, as one of the
planners of , the hold-up. V Hilton also told \
where h,e had buried the money, and most
of it was xecoveied. *
V When Oldham came to .trial the officer
who arrested Hilton testified to what the
prisoner had told him. This was objected
to on the ground that it J was hearsay, but
the court -. admitted the '-* evidence. -;- After
ward Hilton - came on "the stand* and ' re
peated the statements made by him to the
arresting officer, and to which ; the - officer
testified. The ; prosecution \ claim '"". that
Hilton's b; subsequent - appearance " . cured
whatever .error, was first committed: and
that it was further cured iby the court's
instruction to the jury to disregard every-,
thing not said in the defendant's presence.;
The Supreme ' " Court ' holds the ! error too
serious, however, to be wiped out by later
acts. In commenting on the point it says :
. Evidence of the statements of a co-conspira
tor, made during the life of the conspiracy, IS
admissible against the other conspirator; i but
after the crime has been committed the con
spiracy is an accomplished | factâ it jis a thing
of the* past, and such statements of ' a co-con
spirator stand in no different relation to the
law and are no more admissible against . a de
fendant than though he were a total stranger
to the whole transaction, for they were the
purest hearsay.*
; The court then notes a former decision,
as follows: *
It was never competent to use as evidence
against one on trial for an alleged crime the
statements of an accomplice not given as testi
mony in the case nor made in the presence | of ,
the defendant, nor during the pendency of the
criminal enterprise and in furtherance of its
objects. To hold such testimony . admissible
would be to ignore the rules of evidence settled
and everywhere recognized from the earliest
times. '''''^^SSmÃSSttW^^^^BÃ^^l^
)" Continuing, the court says:
' If Hilton had refused to take the stand and
testify it could not be contended for a moment
that his ; confessions could have been used
against this '. defendant < for 1 the purpose .â  of
proving the robbery or for any other purpose.
It is insisted that the error of the court was
cured ', when the witness Hilton took the
stand and gave to the "jury substantially the
same statements and confessions he had prior
to that time made to the officers. We cannot
say that the jury attached no importance to
those statements of Hilton made shortly after
the commission of the crime, nor that the ver
dict would have been the same if ; they had
been rejected by the court.
SIDE ENTRANCES.
Saloon - Keepers Arrested Two Tears
Ago Again Appear in the
â¢ J : Police Court. V.
' J. . B. Marshall, Eddie Homan, John
McKnight and five other saloon-keepers
appeared before Judge Joachimsen yester
day, to answer fto the charge of ' violating
the "side-entrance" ordinance, but : at the
request of the defendants, the cases were
continued till March ; 26. '.' ; Y.b.
The defendants were arrested about two
years ago. At that time J. Coleman, one
of; the ; saloon keepers arrested, ; was con
victed in the Police Court and 'took an ap
peal to the Superior Court to test the con
stitutionality :. of the â¢ ordinance. y All the
other defendants;. took â¢ steps to secure a
stay of : proceedings -j in ? the *-. lower court
pending a decision on the Coleman appeal,
and promised that should the appeal fail,
they would ail plead guilty. . .. y. V '
After several v delays .Coleman .pleaded
guilty "; before Judge Bahrs and was ? : sen
tenced to pay a fane of -$20. ; ; As.a result,
the constitutionality, of the ordinance was
not tested and the status. of affairs is now
precisely as ;: it 1 was two years r ago, except
that Coleman was convicted. V r â â â

GANGERS!
CAN THEY BE CURED?;
-DR. C. A. HASCALL of 1802 ' Market street
says they can and that/ too, without the use of
a. KNIFE OR ESCHAROTIC. â â 'â 'â  SHOULD l NOT
BE ALLOWED. TO RUN.;; Dr. Hascall is a new
arrival in the City and has what : he believes a
positive cure for cancer; at least,' he has in his
office the ; prpofs of :, the removal of many and
the statements of the individuals themselves as
to the cure. In reply to questions the doctor
says there never was a* time when cancer was
so prevalent as now. It seems to be almost an
epidemic: invading the whole world seemingly
as a pestilence. ,
. . Can cancer be cured by cutting, doctor ?.;. -v y.
J.- My experience is it cannot be. â¢, Many; cases
are reported las being . cured, but if the truth
was ' known t they â  were l lupus or sarcoma, a
seemingly cancerous' jrsowth, - which does not
materially affect the glands, but not cancer. y -
What is your cure, doctor ?Y ; V : yy'y: ry ; Y
.'; I am not quite , ready to give- to the. profes-
sion my cure, but intend to do Iso some time
but I will say it is not an escharotlcâ itis a
purely vegetable remedy, which kills cancer
in a few hours. It is afterward sloughed out
by the : use of i poultices. It requires usually
from eight to ) twelve i days to get the f cancer. '
But my treatment for the cure. takes from four
to eight weeks. My killing remedy affects only
malignant > , growths /. and -i does * not ' ~<~ affect
healthy- tissues. With my remedy I treat
cancer of the tongue and the womb. The can-
cer you see here I .-removed, from the face of
Mr. W. R. Defrees of Oakland, a man 70 or,
more years old, a large cauliflower cancer. He
- was sent home in four I weeks and -had gained

ON NEXT Sunday I am going to
devote as much of our page as
possible.", to our own beautiful
flowerâ the California poppyâ and
I shall be so pleased to have my
dear little letter- writers tell me just as
much about it as they can.
You' Know it is -something to be very
proud of to have a flower belong to us "all
aloney." ' Â-.,....-
-, Tell me where it best loves to grow,
about its size, its color, its peculiar proper
ties, the number and shape of its petals
and its strange way of blossoming.
"Little Miss Shy.
Oh, little Miss Shy, oh, little Miss Shy,
I really wish you would tell me why \
You stand in the door, and won't come near
When surely you know there is naught to fear.
I love little girls: I love them so well,

A HOG ORCHESTRA.
How a Musician Made the Squealers j
Sing a Tune.
During the reign of Louis XI of France !
there was attached to his court one Abbot, j
de Baigne, a man of considerable wit._ The |
abbot was somewhat musically inclined,
and delighted the court with inventions of
odd musical instruments.' One day the
King, after having enjoyed a hearty laugh
over one of these curious contrivances and
desiring to baffle this musical genius, com
manded . him to produce harmonious
sounds from the cries of hogs. This seemed |
an impossibility to the King, prepared
himself to enjoy the -discomfiture of the
abbot. Much to his surprise, however, the
abbot readily agreed to produce them. All
he required was a sum of money, upon the
receipt of which he declared he would
invent the most' surprising thing ever
heard in the way of musical atrocity.
He scoured the country and secured a
large number of hogs, trying their voices
as to pitch and quality and, finally, having
fully satisfied himself, he arranged the. ani
mals in a sort of pavilion richly decorated.
The day. of the trial arrived and the King
and his court entered the pavilion prepared
for something, but greatly in doubt as to
the success of the abbot with the hogs.
However, there were the hogs, sure
enough, and much to the surprise and de
light of the King they commencea to cry
harmoniously and in good tune, rendering
an air that was fairly recognized. . The
abbot had arranged a series of stops that
were connected with the hogs and upon
pulling one of them out caused a spike to
prick the hog it connected with, making
him squeal his note. The rest was easy,
for pulling out the different stops he pro
duced the tune.â Round Table.
.â  A Summer Hour.
One bright summers-days -day a lady was
busily engaged in gathering tiny rice shells
on one of the many little beaches to be
found along the shores of the beautiful
bay of Monterey.
Above and to the left of f this particular
beach was situated a picturesque Chinese
fishing village. f â¢ . â¢ .
â All : at once from out this little town
came a group of children, boys and girls,*
with their" peculiar, gay ly colored gowns
fluttering in the breeze. â¢
It was wonderful to see how easily they
clambered . over the rocks down to the
beach, with all the nimbleness and grace
of the wild goat;- a feat which, I think,,
would be rattier difficult for yon to per
form, even had you not to wear the awk
ward wooden shoes with which these chil
dren were shod.
Two or three of the girls, besides, had
heavy babies bound to their backs by long,
bright silken scarfs. ) - *
Now, I'm sure you're ' just .on tip toe
with 'excitement to know all ,' about what
' these children ; did- after) they had safely
' reached the gently, sloping. beach. ; ...
Well, amid much chatter and gay laugh
ter, with > an ' occasional < shy glance â¢ at the
shell-gatherer, a boy. of 3 about 12 '- years,
who seemed to be the' leader of the { band,;
pulled from his pocket a gorgeous red silk
handkerchief. Holding it in his hand as
* bis companions gathered about him, and
pointing to each one in turn, he repeated a
, "jingle of word's; which' I suppose was the
Chinese version of:
"Eeny, meeny,"'mlny,"'_o,* " '"'â¢
Catch a nigger by the toe, V " .'.
If he hollers, let him go,
". -. Eeny, meeny, miny, mo," . â â  .
or some other of the many rhymes which
- â  . . .-'..-> 2.. â ; l?, --.--â -â  .,
children use to determine the important
question of who is to be "it."
Pretty soon all were ; counted out with
the exception of one of the girls whose;
back was burdened by a chunky baby
brother. Sue did not seem to mind this at
all, however, for a merry laugh burst from
her lips as she allowed her eyes to be
bound, with the handkerchief. ' Y>
. Oh, thought the lady, they are .really
going to play blindman's-buff, " just | the
same as little white girls and '. boys do, as
she slipped to a sheltered nook, from
which she might enjoy watching without
disturbing them.
' The leader, after perching himself on a
rock, took from his packet a "':â¢ small har
monica, on which he played sweet tunes,
while the others entered heartily into, the
dear old game, keeping time to the music
with prancing feet, waving hands and
merry voices as they dodged the â¢ blind
man's clutches ""'
And thus these little" ones â¢ played â one
after another being blindfoldedâ until a
discordant voice from the village called
them back to work, for .'.the .children in
these fishing villages are able to help. their
parents a great deal in the drying and
packing of fish for the Chinese market.
During , the happy hour of play there
were no pouty* looks; not one cross word
was uttered, nor one objection raised to
being "it," and, now when the fun was-

I â¢'* /# in the cutlery works of Thiers, j
_JL - __x France. Each. grinder, man and j
woman, takes a dog to the
grinding-room in winter, and the four
footed heater stretches himself out upon j
the back of his master or mistress for no j
other purpose than to ' keep his owner j
warm. V The reason for this is told by Ed- j
mond Renoir in a recent number of j
â'Illustration, who visited Thiers, which j
is the Sheffield of France, inasmuch as it |
is the center of French cutlery manufac- j
ture. M. Renoir, in his interesting ac- >

count of his visit, says in regard to the
grinding department of one of the large
works:
"Instead of occupying an upright or a
seatea position while at their work the
grinders, men and women, lie flat on their
stom acns upon planks, placed nearly hori
zontally on a scaffolding, which rises above
the grindstones.
"On the pHnks are sheepskins to relieve
the nardness of the wood, and the head
and shoulders of the grinders, project be
j-ond the ends of the planks and their
arms reach down vertically to the rim of i
the grindstones, which are kept in contin- j
ual motion by the belting, driven by water j
power. ". ;\ . ' * i
"But this is not the most curious part of \
the affair. That. which every one notices at j
i.rsi is that each, worker has an auxiliary, j
consisting of a dog, that fills none of the
functions which are peculiar to that friend
of man elsewhere. The dog simply acts
as a stove to keep the worker warm. The
grinder, extended his length on the plank,
soon becomes fatigued and enfeebled and
the cold gains on him without any power
on his part to resist it.
"It is true he may.arise from his place
and walk about for a short time to re
establish the circulation of his blood, but
in a few minutes after he resumes work
and his incumbent attitude the chill strikes
him, and when this i point is reached he
whistles for his dog.
"The dog, called 'tou-tou,' trained to his
duties, immediately springs upon the bench
and lays himself upon the extended legs of
his master, covering him as much as possi
ble and supplying him with a grateful,
warmth. It is not a special race of dogs
that rills this office. All typesâ curs, high
bred and mongrelsâ are. utilized, and no
one concerns himself about pedigree or
anything but the size of the animal. It is
essential, naturally,' that this barking s'.ove
should not be too heavy."
The Communion . Siphon.
â  Considerable discussion has been aroused
in religious and medical circles as to the,
advisability, from a sanitary point of view
of a large number of persons partaking of
the wine from * one cup. I have heard
many express a distaste for it, from the
standpoint of : their unwillingness to drink
out of a glass previously used by a member

ot their own family even; and. then again,
the fear of contagion has often deterred
otherwise favorably disposed persons from
partaking of the general communion. Â;
â  'F;otna medical standpoint the common
cup is looked upon ;as a means : of trans
rnittinjr disease. The bacilli of consump
tion may lurk in the wine, or the lips may
become inoculated with that most dreaded
of all diseasesâ cancer. bi b *
â¢V minister in Boston has V invented what
he* calls a ; revolving cup. This is a large
silver cup . into which ; is \ fitted ; a smaller
cftpand the space between the outer and
Inner cup holds the wine. The inner cup is
made in a series of sections which revolve
by means of a small crank. When one sec-,
tion ' i** emptied! the crank -> automatically
tills it with fresh wine." This prevents any
microbes or bacilli from impregnating the
Wine, but - it; does not prevent contagion
from the lips.YSVYY- Â' . .

seems- to meet evry jection, is the com
munion ' siphon: ylt : retain s; the common
_np and effectually prevents all? danger, of

ness renders it most attractive. -It, is up-

cleaned, and. as pure silver and glass is
used no unpleasant taste is communi
cated.
â¢It comes in two styles, both of which
are here represented. The silver siphon
is a small tube about live inches in length,
and not larger around than a straw. It
curves slightly at the end where it touches
the lips," and about hall an inch from the
lower end is a : valve which prevents a
liquid once drawn above it from returning.
: The siphon is in two pieces, joined in the
center for convenience in carrying. It can
be pulled apart and both pieces slipped
into a short leather case. : The pieces can
be joined as easily as they are taken apart
by simply slipping-: one inside the other.
The glass siphon is all in one and cannot
be pulled apart.
The plan .of the inventor is that each
communicant shall be provided with a
siphon, and the idea of unity same
cup and the same wine being usedâ will
still be preserved.â Pittsburg Dispatch.
To See Thine* in the Dark.
The eyes of the scientific world to-day
are turned to the study of the X and ca
thode rays, not only for the practical value
that they will prove to science, but because
j of the fact that the discovery of their na
i ture may mean life. or death to, many ac
| cepted theories on the phenomena of light,
j heat and magnetism. .'. Of all the recent j
discoveries in the study of light none is j
more, interesting .and likely to prove of i
more practical value than that of Mr." |
The Apparatus.
Georges d'lnfreville, a distinguished elec
! trical expert of this city, says the New
| York Sun, who has perfected an apparatus
I by which it is possible; to see in complete
I darkness. V Mr. d'lnfreville also succeeded
I several years ago in taking photographs in
darkness. His researches : and . their re
suits have been known for a long time to a
number of well-known scientific : men in
this city, but not until a few weeks ago did
he make public the principles of his re
markable process.
When the news of Ron teen's discovery
first reached this country Mr. d'lnfreville
announced in the Electrical Engineer that
he had several years ago succeeded in pho
tographing and seeing in darkness, but he
did not describe his method' Y A recent ar
ticle in the same journal contains, how
ever, an account 5 from his own pen of the
theory ' and application of the process.
He does not use vacuum tubes or any of
the V complicated V electrical V apparatus
needed for. the generation of 'the X ray.
On the other hand, his apparatus is ex
tremely simple. His process consists : of
two operations. First he casts on the ob
ject to be seen or photographed ultra-violet
rays, which are invisible to the human eye.
Secondly, ;he renders visible the objeci
thus illumined. â  ;â 
The ultra-violet rays of ; the spectrum, as
is known to all versed, in the first princi
ples of light, are found beyond the violet.
They are ' the ' most ; refrangible "or "easily
bent rays in light; have the shortest wave
length "and most "rapid vibrating^ period,
and so do not affect the human eye. V They
extend beyond the violet of the solar spec
trum several times as far as the length of
the visible spectrum. y
.: These invisible rays can, however, be
made | visible: ; Plates ; washed with ' bisul
phate of quinine,' an â â  alcoholic solution of
stramonium or barium platino-cyanide,
immediately fluoresce when; placed j in the
spectrum beyond: the violet. This change
to the visible is due to a diminution in th_
refrangibility of the ray which is ordinarily
too retragible to affect the eye. yy
The accompanying cut shows Mr.' d'ln
freville's; method of casting these frays' on
the object and then making them visible.
The figure B represents a tightly closed
box having at C a window with, a sliding
i shutter. From the point L;â  light falls ' on
the prism at ; P and is t there ' decomposed
into various colors of the spectrum, which
are visible on the side A. The prism is," of
quartz whicn ? does : not ', absorb \ the ' ultra
violet rays to any great extent.'; The shut
ter at Bis opened v, and adjusted ;so, as to
allow only tne ultra- violet rays to pass opt
into the darkness and fall upon -the object
lat D. The figure Tis a telescope,? having
I at 0 an objective of quartz or." other sub
; stance which will refract ultra-violet rays
I without absorbing them. In the telescope
at F is a plate /coated with ai . fluorescent
â¢ substance and transparent. The rays that
strike the object and are ! not â¢ absorbed - by
! it are reflected to the objective of | the tele
j scope and pass through it to the plate at F
: ; where the image ; ; is â¢ formed. The image
can be seen from the other side ; by ' meaos
of an ordinary convex ocular.; glass, which
is shown at "N. , .
To photograph the object in darkness a
fluorescent plate is z used 1 - to obtain the
proper focus. Then a ? plate sensitive to
the actinic effects': of tbe ultra-violet rays
is exposed and the picture thus formed on

In his first article in .the Electrical En-,

Calentlrical Odditiei.
A reader of the St. Louis Republic calls
attention to the fact that there are five' Su
ndays, rive Mondays and five Tuesdays in the
present month. Our correspondent gets
i somewhat exefted: before closing his little
epistle and frantically inquires if such a
thing ever occurred before in : the history
of the world, or since our present time
reckoning system came into use.
b We must admit that caiendrical oddities
have been forcing themselves /upon us at a
j pretty rapid gait since the opening of. the
present year. February had twenty-nine
days, something which will not again occur
for eight years, owing to the fact that the
year 1900 will not be a leap year. More
over, it had five Saturdays/ something
which usually occurs but once in each
I twenty-eight years, at the "completion of
j the solar cycle. The last time before the
February just past that the month opened
and closed with a Saturday was in 1868.
The March: leaf of this year's calendar
certainly looks odd, - being ;' ruled for five
each or the three first days of the week, or |
three-sevenths of the whole number. If j
each of the other " four days of the week :
;. could have an extra : inning this month it ;
would contain a total of thirty-five days. I
Ks it is there is nothing very? surprisingly j
unique about it. March begins on Sunday, !
and; ends on Tuesday: (which' gives the !
calendar five of each of the first three days i
of the week) once in each six years, If not !
interfered with by leap year.
March, 1891, came in on Sunday and i
, went out on Tuesday, just; exactly the >
; same as the present month has .done and I
! will; do. So did . March of 1885.;; March, i
j 1880. would have exhibited the same pecu- |
j liarity, but for the fact that that year was !
j a leap year, February appropriating: the |
; day which should 3 rightly have slipped !
j over into the March calendar. There is a !
! rule for calculating the number of times in j
! which five Sundays, five Mondays and five !
Tuesdays will occur in the month of March j
during a century, 'i but : the editor admits !
that he has never yet hit on one that was
infallible.
S The year 1896 has been and will be. "an
odd year, calendrically speaking, but it ' is
nothing compared with the year 46 8.C.,
which is known to the horologists as "the
year of confusion." ? That year had 445
days, and things got so badly mixed that i
it took a first-class /mathematician and j
astronomer to tell summer from winter.
. Rainbows That Can Change Sex.
In many parts of the world it is the gen- j
eral belief that the rainbow has the power
to change sex. This queer belief obtains j
in such widely separated districts as South
Africa and Norway, arid China and Aus- j
tralia. y The Zulus have a " long folk lore '
story of the young man who, was changed i
into a wrinkled old woman by touching;
the many-hued ' arch. : The Scandinavian ;
peasants: have : a similar story, and in i
Greece they say that anybody who runs
against the end of the: rainbow will have
his or her sex instantly changed.' In I
France and India to pass under the rain- {
bow has a similar effect. V

New Departure in Warfare.
" A paper on this subject by Lieutenant j
J. W. Graydon (late of the United States j
navy) was read at the weeKly, meeting of j
the ; Balloon Society by Edmund - triber,- |
chairman for the evening. The writer be- i
gan by stating that every improvement in !
the destructiveriess of implements of war- j
fare would shorten the duration of armed
conflict-, and the contingency of their oc- '
currence as a means; of settling disputes I
between nations would be rendered less |
and less probable. The 'best "naval and I
military scientists,;, while- recognizing the "j
prime necessity of ships, fortifications and
other defensive works, 'were ./becoming ;
more : and/more inclined to discount the i
theory of impregnability, in the light of i
discoveries that invest projectiles with
deadly and irresistible power. / ; /
â "â â : The most recent invention of this kind
was 1 the ' Graydon aerial â high-explosive
projector/a very few. of which would cause
the complete collapse of any modern forti- I
fication. He -claimed the ' following j
vantages 'â  for ' the aerial % torpedoes over i
under- water torpedoes:;; The operator can'
watch the flight and correct his ? aim; >. the
range of the torpedo is eight or ten times
greater -than any / under-water ;â¢ â¢ torpedo |
known,'. and as. accurate as any; modern !
rifled cannon ; the application of ' aerial
torpedoes, loaded with explosive gelatine, '
to ;-. the / modern ; ,-â â  torpedo-boats ;' will/": in- i
crease their destroying power very "greatly !
and : enable th*** operators to project I
their torpedoes through the air with the
accuracy/ of modern artillery; ' the / in- ;
creased "range, of.seven "or eight times that
of the obsolete Whitehead and other tin- :
der--vater torpedoes, will permit the aerial
torpedoes to be ; projected from ; such -dis- |
tances that the low-lying /torpedo- boats
will be mere specks on the ' water, and i
thus poor targets for an enemy to defend !
himself from, even with the best modern;
guns. V The writer of; the paper so re- â¢
ferred \to the Graydon destroyer, a vessel :
that would be so low in the water that at
three miles it would practically ;be 'out of j
sight, and consequently be a difficult tar- I
get. Another invention -referred to was

A PRIMITIVE PILEDRIVER
Used at a Chine fishing Camp on the
" Shore of San Pablo Buy.
One ' of -the queerest and most primitive
piledrivers to.be seen in California ; is at
one of the Chinese fishing camps on the
McNear Ranch,' almost opposite the Two
Sisters, in San Pablo Bay. The. appear
ance of the contrivance is much like J the
piledrivers in general use, but ; the way. it
is put together and operated is ludicrous.
Every part of the machine is made of
wood except the nails that hold it to-

/gether. \ The hammer is part of i a log. It
is about 'two feet thick and five feet long.
It is placed between the uprights and kept
from falling out by several wooden pees
driven' in on both sides. The uprights are
made of Z some o'd scantling picked up ] on
the bay, shore and are nailed and tied to

ber.YYY'f'b.'.Y'.' â  yy i
'â¢; Y The -. operating i machinery is about ;as
complicated as a grindstone. All there is
to it is a couple of pulleys, -a book and a'
piece of 5 rope. k' One f pulley-block is sus
pended from the top of j" the upright , frame
and the other iis allowed to hang loose.
When working the machine a piece of rope
is run through a hole in the top of } the
wooden < hammer, and the hook â¢on j| the ,
lower pulley-block is slipped through. All
hands then pull until the hammer reaches
j the top.'? At i this " interesting I. part of 1 the
performance ; a man 'climbs to the i top of
the uprights and with a knife cuts the rope
that is run through the top of the ham

is certainly effective, for ,^ the pile is driven
a good '( distance into the soft mud at each

TWO OLD-TIME PACKET SHIPS
BY DENIS â¢KEARNEY.
THIS little sea sketch that I write
| I to-day will be read by at least two
i hundred thousand people in this
! City, most of whom at some time
or another, have strolled down ito :
the city front to look at the ships that lay
moored to the wharves and anchored in
bay. Nearly all of them must have seen
the barks Columbia and Germania,-. but
few knew anything of their history. lit
they had they would have. bestowed on
them more than a passing glance. It is
the modern sky-scraping clippers tied to
the other side of the dock that command
the attention of the onlooker, while the
two old sea rovers whose pictures are
given on this page of The Call are passed
by unnoticed.
The Columbia was launched at New
York City in 1846 and four years later the
Germania slid off the ways at Portsmouth,
N. H. They were built for the "Black
ball line," though for a 'time the latter
was a crack Havre packet. They were
full-rigged ships then, carrying * great big
single topsails, but nothing higher than
royals. On their foretop sails, was
painted a black ball so large that it reached
from the footrope to the jackstay, and the
tips of their royal masts were crowned
with gilded trucks upon which the morn
ing sunbeams played. They had high
bluff bows, square sterns and very large
painted ports that were always kept clean
and shiny. .
Up to this time ship-building had not at
tained a very high standard of excellence,
for when these two ships were ready to sail
on their maiden voyage men who were com
petent to judge pronounced them "float
ing palaces." but to keep, up the reputa
tions already gained the officers brought
their brass knuckles along, and the sailors
on both sides of the Atlantic soon began
to denounce them as "floating hells." â¢
They could not be anything else and
fly from their main royal truck the
bouse flag of Charlie Marshall, for the
"Black- line" was . Marshall's line of
packet ships. They were of the same ton
nage, spread the same amount of canvas
and each could carry more .than 600 pas
sengers at a time. Their courses, topsails
and lower staysails, were made of No. 1
cotton . canvas that was as white as the
crest that curls on top of an Atlantic
wave.
What was most needed at the time was
speed as well as strength, and it was to
meet these requirements that both were
constructed and their successful lives on
this and other oceans speak well for the
carpenters who worked upon their ribs,
knees and joints from their backbone to
the sheer plank. Last winter they. were at
sea and safely weathered the gale and
waves which swamped and sent to the
bottom the steamers Keweenaw and Mont
serrat and the sailing-ship Spartan and
others. They were accustomed to riding
out gales and climbing to' the top of
mountainous waves. These two old vet
erans rode outÂ«many a howling wintry
gale on the stormy Atlantic half a century
ago, and the waves that kissed their knight
beads off Cape Mendocino when so many
precious lives found watery graves were as
ripples thrown up against the side of a
Whitehall skiff from the splashing of the
paddle of a ferry-boat in the bay, when
compared to the roaring white-maned
monsters that thundered against their
bows and battered at their sides in the
North Atlantic with a force that made j
every knee and joint creak and groan. I
They were the ocean racers of the forties
and every time they left Liverpool west- I
ward bound their cabins and .'tween decks j
were crowded with the best blood of the |
Old World anxious to reach the New. |
Stowed away in their 'tween decks, packed j
like sardines in a box, could be found youth |
and beauty, mirth,. innocence and virtue,
whose capital were their brawny arms,
splendid constitutions and iron will, , with
no outfit, all mixed up together, every one
being content with his or her quarters, and
there was no growling as to who should
have the lower or the upper bunk, for some
were there who had no bunks at all, and i
many others had neither mattresses nor
pillows. They had to content themselves |
with the soft "side of a board, while their j
heads rested on their hard hob-nailed
shoes, beside which the yellow-covered i
footgear of Joe Gassman, the young as- j
tronomer, is as a soft bed of down. Oh, j
my,, if these two old sea warriors ' could
only talk, how bewildering the stories they j
would tell !
The decks of these Blackball liners were
tne scenes of many bloody rows between
the quarterdeck and the forecastle, and the I
Columbia was no exception to the rule. j
The sailors were the best that ever ree'ed
. a topsail or mast-headed a yard, and at
the same time the toughest. The offic3rs
were just as tough as the sailors. .They
were made up of men who would rather
n_ht than eat. Mrs. Reilly's boarding
house, on Dennison street, "in Liverpool,'
was . the headquarters for most of the
packet ships' sailors, and she shipped them

kind, and if any of their heads tried to
stop a flying belaying pin, there was sure
to be music in the air and blood upon the
deck. The scuppers ran with it. As sailors,
they knew their work, and did it. Most of
the" captains who sailed in the Blackball
line preferred them ' to other crews, for
they liked to crack on sail and they could
safely rely on these sailors to clew up and
furl, no matter how strong the. snow squall
or frosty the weather. It was the grub,
not the work, that usually brought about
the trouble, and the bloody fortys insisted
upon enough of bread scouse and plain
duff. If the pork, as was often the case,
was ill smelling, some one would cut the
harness cask adrift and roll it into the lea
scuppers, where its contents were dumped
out and thrown overboard. . ~' : Trouble was

"Taste â  that, you?-â- i hound, you!" he
roared, at the same time striking the sailor
on the head with " the . heavy spyglass, fell
ing him to the deck.

their allowance of 'â  food ;to the , starvation \
point. The watch was in about as ugly_a
mood as i the T captain, and; they went aft
to : make trouble. V Captain Bryer ; and
his officers were not prepared for this early
morning attack, though they should have
been, for. it was customary? in !; those ships
whenever ans of the crew showed a muti
nous spirit 'to either trice them up or kill
them on the spot. :â ' "â â -)SS'_aS^ob"-- '
No sooner had Bryer knocked [ the man
senseless than ho himself was "laid out
with a belaying-pin, kicked to death in
stantly and thrown overboard, while the
chief mate, who rushed to his assistance.;
had bis right arm broken;' besides losing
one of his ears, which some fellow cut off:
with his ; sheatnknife. '" He, too, would j
have been cut to pieces and his body given!
to the waves, to keep company with the
captain, but for the timely interference of .
a few of I the ; leaders, who ; wanted - his j life I
saved that he might navigate the; ship, as I
they didn't know anything about the quali- i
ties of, the other officers^ iYbY'VYY^Y Yyy
The Columbia was bound tto the west
ward i when I Captain ! Brver, her comman
der, was killed: and thrown to the sharks.
She Â» had ** over J 600 ? passengers '," on % board,
nearly all of whom below at the time.
Only a few of them 4 witnessed the row and
many did not know of : it until 'after their
arrival in New York. -
My iirst recollection of this famous old
craft dates back to the year that I ran away,
from home to go to sea. It was in ; the
winter of 1857 and we bad jus: warped the
brigantine Active, one of whose crewel
was," into the outer basin of " the Waterloo
dock in Liverpool. The ' tide was vet in
the flood and the gates leading to the in
; ncr basin were open to j allow a great ' big
painted port ship.-to haul Y out. As ' she
moved slowly through the gates the sailors
who were heaving on the : forward capstan
nad struck up the chanty:
Heave' away, my Johnny, heave awayâ
To the evident delight ,of themselves and
the * passengers ' on her > decks ' and the
crowds who lined both sides of the ; dock.
Sorrow for the lime being had given ; place
to smiles on the faces of those around,
notwithstanding the fact that the nearest
and dearest of s friends were parting, most
of : them, maybe,' never to see each other
again. â  ;; ' ,-
V; : It - was ' a cold, raw, blustery day. The
ground on shore was carpeted with a thick
layer of snow, that was frozen hard and tne
rigging of the ships about us was full of
icicles. But the crowds paid no attention
to the freezing blasts that whistled through 1
their ears, reddening the tips. Y.Thei'oing
out of a packet ship in those days; ! full of
passengers, was : ; an incident above >\ the
ordinary and created \a % good I deal ?of ex
citement. ; The populace 'turned * out en
masse to ; see V them a depart. V Molly and \
May, decorated in *: cheap? straw hats and
dressed in J clean starched calicoes, came
down to the levee to bid good-by' to their
sailor lovers, and 'â â  the t sobs 1 and f sighs "' of
some J lovesick swain who but"' a few mo
ments before had kissed the ripe red lips
of j his departing sweetheart, gave an addi
tional coloring to the animated scene.
V The Columbia made [fast to I the dock
astern of us, her pilot having 'concluded
that : a â  snowstorm was y brewing, and he
decided * to ) remain in the outer basin all
night. I was glad |of this, for that morn--;
ing our captain handed 'me a letter from
home â  which V contained % the information
that, three of my ; schoolmates had left for
Liverpool a week or 'so ; before to ? sail on ]
the Columbia for; New York. They were
girls ; and their passages had been prepaid
by ; tneir uncles, who â¢ were "; in i the States.
I must go ana see them. With much dif
ficulty I -found them standing in a group
by themselves on the port side forward of
the galley door. They greeted me most
affectionately, indeed % they j wept ; for joy
and Y smothered : me- with kisse3. I was
very young then, they being six years
older, and this chance meeting in a strange
land; with the deep ' blue J sea ; between â¢". us
and our,: straw-thatched homes and the
parents that we loved, 5 made \ it j the"- more
interesting. For six years they; and I "at
tended the village ' school, ' during 'â  all of
which time they sat on the row of benches
in front of me.
Y This i little 'i schoolbouse in which we
learned how to make pot-hooks and hang
ers was warmed in summer from without
by welcome sunshine, and in winter a
blazing turf fire heated it from within, but
the scholars had to furnish the fuel; each
one bringing his or her snare. They were
rosy-cheeked village beauties," all "three ;of
them, with minds as I pure as the opening \
of dawn and ! hearts \ that 'were light and ;
gay. They feared not the wild Atlantic,
and they were not only willing but glad to
risk a winter's I passage over :â  its t stormy
waters to seek their fortunes ."in the land
beyond. Where they are t now I do I not
know, but if alive I trust they were suc
cessful, and if they are dead I hope . >hey
axe in heaven. y ' Â»
* ' I did know three, but since the death of
Detective John Coffey I only Know two
men now who sailed in the Columbia with
Captain Bryer in the fiftiesâ John Decry
and Billy Ellison, the old city j front boat
man. '% Both tasted the sweets and the bit
ter of packet-ship life. They have lived in
this City for more i than j forty years, are
above ! want 1 and "â¢ have | been?, these ! many
years. Like myself they stroll down to the'
wharf to look at the old Columbia. She is
now owned by Renton, Holmes & Co. of
this City and is kept hard at work hauling
lumber." from Puget Sound to this port,
'while the Germania belongs to P. B. Corn
wall ana is employed in bringing coal from 1
his mines. Denis. Kearney.

RULED FOR THE RAILROAD
Judge Hebbard Had " Small Sym
pathy With This Class of
Cases."
PASSENGERS* RIGHT TO REDE;
Frank C. Colville Had a Ticket to
Redding, but Was Only Allowed
Passage to Red Bluff.
"I have small sympathy with this class
of cases," announced Judge Hebbard â¢ on ;
Friday prior to deciding a railroad dam
age suit : involving the: rights of passen
â¢ gers. b- â¢ " "-""'''
It was an appealed case brought by
Frank C. Colville against the Southern Pa
cific j Company. ; Colville - bought a ' ticket
from Oakland to Redding, He rode to
Davisville " and changed ; cars. After leav
ing Davisville the conductor took away the
ticket, substituting a hat check which he
took away on nearing the town of Red
â  Bluff, j; After leaving Red , Bluff, the con
ductor asked Colville for a ticket and re
fusing to accept any explanation, collected
from the : passenger' $1 15 ) fare ; from Red
Bluff, to ;.' Redding, .' paid under b protest.
These facts were admitted, the 'ticket
reading "Oakland to Redding," being
produced 'in court. On these facts Mr.
Colville sued for $299, being $99. exemplary
damages and $200 under section 490 of the
Civil Code.
Attorney Thomas R. Knox for Mr. Col
ville proved the facts and cited the law" of
the case. Section 490 says plainly :
" Every railroad corporation must provide and
furnish to every person desiring a passage on
their, passenger-cars a - ticket which entitles
the purchaser to a ride from the depot or sta
tion where the same is purchased to any other
depot or station . on â¢â  the line of â  their road.*
Every such ticket entitles its holder to ride on
their passenger-cars to the station or depot of
destination. Any corporation failing so to pro
vide : and furnish tickets or refusing the pas
sage which the case calls for when sold must
pay to the person so refused the sum of $200.
This section Mr. Knox explained further
as follows:- "It says to defendant, 'If you
do not give the ride ; which you agreed to
give plaintiff you must do something else
by way of penalty or satisfaction;.. In the
words of the law, you must pay $200. You
bad a plain choice; you agreed to do one
of two things give plaintiff the ride paid
for <or give him $200. V ? You refused .- the
ride called for. and now the law says you
must pay him $200.' ',';
The defense urged that the plaintiff had
suffered through -an . "honest mistake. of
its conductor. :It was claimed that every
thing had been i conducted in a peaceable
and gentlemanly way.
To this Attorney Knox replied : - "In de
fiance of the strongest kind of proof, Know
ingly, willfully aqd deliberately,' the con- â .
ductor refused to look at the ticket,' which
was in J his own possession. -Plaintiff fur
ther informed him that : his baggage had
been checked on that ticket from Oakland
to Redding and showed him* the check and
its number. Did the conductor attempt to
verify, plaintiff's claim by looking for the
ticket or, the baggage, both of which were
in ; his charee? â â¢- No ; ) â¢ but "i showed . him ; a
single memorandum made by himself (the
conductor), and that alone" declared that
plaintiff ( was , making i a false claim ; told
him that if. he had his baggage checked to
Redding it was checked on some one else's
ticket, thereby declaring plaintiff to be an
intruder on defendant's cars, attempting
to obtain a ride through fraud and misrep
resentation. V
;Y "Whether there were few or any passen
gers on the car at that time matters not;
it was a public place and ; plaintiff was ac
cused of wrongdoing, declared to be an
impostor and a -petty larcenist. * For this
indignity "inflicted; willfully on the plain
tiff \ be ' asks f exemplary damages in the
sum of $99 under section 3294 of the Civil
Code." : YY-'Y-V â .-â â :;-: YY'y ;.
It was further contended by the plaintiff
that on the question of . an -."honest = mis
take" by the conductor the law does ! not
contemplate excusing. wrongdoing, on' the
ground? of a correct motive, and cited in
numerable authorities showing that "good
fait:i is no excuse for ;; a violation '< of stat
utes. The , legal wrong is â¢in the injury
'done.*',;;
V Judge Hebbard l stated :at â  first that \ he
did not see the " necessity for argument in
the case; that bis sympathy for such cases
was small. He refused to transfer the case
when â -" taxed ' with bias 'j in ? uttering this
statement and f allowed \ briefs to be sub
mitted. Â y ,-
Finally the court rendered judgment for
the defendant railroad, the Southern Pa- i
cific, stating, among his â¢, reasons; that: the ;
oonductor ; did? not Â» attempt -to eject the
passenger; f.. that V the ? dispute I had been
courteously settled; 5 that the passenger :
had jon claimed ; $1 15, ' which V had { been
refunded him "v by the/railroad;-, and that
the conductor, whose fitness was indi
cated tby twenty-seven years' service, had
only made an "honest mistake." .
y.;; In regard to points ' in \ the decision ' not
touched on, Attorney Knox had explained
that : the : ; passenger .* had K not ; resisted the
conductor under pain '- of committing J a
Federal offense, and that he bad not .''only,
claimed "' $1 15" jin - settlement, '*- but b had
simply written to the company a â  succinct
statement of the unjust manner in which
he had been treated. *; : / YYy ; '

DOCTORSWEANY.
WHY
Is DOCTOR SWEANY acknowledged as SAN FRANCISCO'S
LEADING AND MOST SUCCESSFUL SPECIALIST?
BECAUSE
His reputation has been established by effecting CURES of

edged ability, had failed.

of the world adorn the walls of his offices. >â â  Chronic and Wast-
ing 'Diseases of the Throat, Lungs, Heart, Stomach, Bowels,
Kidneys and the GENITO-URINARY ORGANS have been Doctor
Sweany's study *f or life. There are cases -of this character
which, through neglect or^inri proper treatment, are beyond
medical aid, but there are many more "given up as hopeless
simply because incompetent physicians have failed to effect a
; cure. This especially applies to venereal diseases of the blood
and the GENITO-URINARY ORGANS, and Doctor Sweany
yearly saves thousands from becoming mental and physical
wrecks. â¢
MEN WHO ARE WASTING
AWAY

Brain and Insanity ; if you are tormented with morbid fear and
your days are passed with distressing thoughts of your disease
and you are unfit- for the every-day duties of life; if you have
any or all of these symptoms you are suffering from SEMINAL
WEAKNESS, NERVOUS DEBILITY and their kindred causes.
THE FIRST THING TO DO
In order to get cured is to cast aside all false modesty and place
yourself under Doctor Sweany's treatment. His experience Ah.
treating such diseases has been world-wide. He has cured
thousands of others and CAN CURE YOU. HHfl-HHBBHH
GONORRHOEA, GLEET and that terrible and loathsome

CHICAGO, 111., March : 21.â the opening of
the wheat market this: morning the crowd was In
the humor for selling, finding encouragement to do
so in the news, but a heavy trader who > had a line
out at higher prices was ready |to absorb all offer
ings, at least six brokers, acting in his interest :
having buying orders c for large quantities. The |
market-under these conditions was changed from
a weak to a strong one, and the weather predic
tions of a cold wave being . posted soon afterward,
there was a bulge of about a cent, St. Louis send
ing numerous buying orders on the rise. The
week's shipments from both coasts, as per Brad
streets, were light at 1,592.000 bushels.
Argentine shipments Were good at 1.056,000
bushels. .Northwestern receipts were large at 661

ago. Chicago received 20 cars and lsnpected out
126.352 â¢ bushels. I Export clearances at Atlantic
ports were light at 124,405 bushels. Liverpool
- cables were steady and continental cables lower.

62% c, closing at 62y 2 @625/ c. â¢y B @y a c higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for Monday,
34 cars.
CORNâ Nothing of any importance was appar
ent in the market for this grain. An easy opening
was succeeded by a firmer tone and an advance in
price, the variations In wheat being the motive.

bushels. Shipments from both coasts as reported
by Bradstreet were 1,802,000 bushels. Atlantic

ering of shorts was noted. ; Receipts were 219 cars,

veloped in product to-day, the selling of the past
few days having created a "Short" interest, which
was inclined to cover. The hog market was firmer
at an advance of 6c, that being mentioned in con
nection with the stronger feeling In provisions.
May nork and lard closed unchanged from yester
day, and May ribs a shade higher. . . : v

MADE A CAUSTIC REPLY.
Goodall, Perkins & - Co. in No
Mood to Make Any Con:
cessions.
W. B. CURTIS IS TAKEN TO TASK.
No Change Likely to Be Made in the
Rate Situation Between Here
and Eureka.
There is a war cloud on the horizon, and
there are indications that it is about to
hover over a field of battle in which Good
all, Perkins & Co. and Traffic Manager
Curtis of the Traffic Association are to be
the contending" forces. . ..". .-;
Some little time ago the San Francisco
Board of Trade called a meeting of the
various commercial bodies of this City, to
take action on the alleged discrimination
of rates in favor of* Portland, Or., as
against San Francisco in the Eureka (Cal.)
traffic- As a result of this conference a
committee of four was appointed to wait
upon Goodall, Perkins & Co., the local
agents of the Oregon Railway and Naviga
tion Company, the alleged, offending car
rier. Instead of making a personal call
on -the representative of the .company
named Mr. Curtis was delegated to draft
and send a letter to the firm calling atten
tion to the matter and proposing a remedy.
This was the letter he sent: - . _, .
Messrs. Goodall, Perkins <_ Co., Agents 0. R.&
y. Company. Cityâ Gentlemen : At the confer
ence recently held in the rooms of the Board
of Trade by representatives from the following
organizations of this Cityâ the- Chamber of
Commerce, Board of Trade, Manufacturers and
Producers' Association, the Traffic Association,
Merchants'. Association and;. San Francisco
Fruit Exchangeâ at which you - were * repre
sented, a committee was appointed to confer
with you in reference to the discrimination in
rates which your line is maintaining between
Portland, Or., and north coast ports south of
there, notably Eureka, as against Sau Fran
cisco. . 'â '-. -:
The committee, after: due deliberation, begs
permission to make to you . the following re
quest. We contend that San Francisco being,
but 216 miles from Eureka as against 520
miles from Portland to Eureka is entitled to
the lower rates. * We request, therefore, that
rates from San Francisco to Eureka shall be ad
justed on a mileage basis, San Francisco receiv
ing the benefit of her geographical position.
In refutation of press reports in both Port
land and Eureka papers we wish to here state
that we have no demand to make, nor was any
demand ever made,- that the service between
Portland and Eureka be discontinued... We
would be pleased to hear from you on the
proposition as outlined above at as early a date
â¢as practicable. y "
To this the ' following caustic reply was
sent on Friday: -b* ;
William. Bosurick Curtis, Esq.. Traffic Manager,
Traffic Association of California, San Francisco,
Catâ Dear Sir: Yours oi the 16th, requesting
that rates from San Francisco to .Eureka as
against Portland to Eureka be adjusted on a
mileage basis, in order that San Francisco may
enjoy the advantage of its geographical posi
tion, was duly received and noted.
Your first complaint was that the rates from
Portland to Eureka were $1 per ton, while the
rates from San Francisco to Eureka were ma
terially higher, and you contended the rates
should be the same. . .â...-.:
When at your meeting the other day we ex
plained that the $1 rate from Portland to Eu
reka had been established by the Portland
office in consequence of their understanding
that such rate was current between San Fran
cisco and Eureka. As soon as this error was
pointed out the rates were adujsted so that
. substantially the same rates are now in effect
from San Francisco as from Portland â¢to Eu
reka. There is a rate of $1 per ton in force on
Hour, feed and mill stuffs from both points to
Eureka.
The low rates now in effect to various points
on the coast are war rates. These rates are not
based on mileageâ they were the rates from
San Francisco to . Coos Bay would be higher
than the rates from Portland to that point, but
they are not, and the rates from Portland to
San" Francisco would be as lowas in the reverse
direction, -instead of being two or three times
higher as they are.
Do you contend that rates to all points
should' be made on a mileage basis or only in
cases where it works to your advantage? And
is distance the only factor to be considered in
the fixing of rates? Should not the character
of the service be also considered? . Â«
The comparatively new, large and modern
steel steamer Pomona, costing some $250,000
and with a speed of fourteen to fifteen knots
per hour, makes about eight round trips per
month between here and Eureka. . Because
there is an old vessel, like the Blanchard for in
stance, which we believe was purchased by her
present owner, for some i*Â» 12,000, carrying
freight between Eureka and Portland at ruin
ously low rates, must the Pomona make still
lower rates "between San Francisco and
Eureka? â¢
We should judge there is an. average of fif
teen to twenty vessels per month sailing from
San Francisco to Eureka, while there are about
two per month from Eureka to Portland, and
these are small, slow and irregular. At even
rates, with these advantages, are we to infer
that San Francisco cannot hold her own?
If an opinion from us in this connection
would not be, considered - presumptious, we
would suggest that Ithe interest, of the i mer
chants of San Francisco is not best subserved
by antagonizing its patrons, even if they are,
to a limited extent, its rivals. Nor do we think
there is any advantage to -be rained by at
tempting to crowd a transportation company
which -â  is friendly and furnishing splendid
service for very inadequate returns into an
antagonistic or unfriendly position. \
- A perusal of a recent article in the Eureka
Standard over the signature -of the president
and secretary of the Board of Trade of Hum
boldt County indicates the effect of the agita
tion got up by.; your association and which,
we think, was and is â¢ ill advised and prejudi
cial. Permit us to say that our company is not
responsible for the cause which . has produced
the effect regarding which ; you complain. On
the contrary it was forced on' to us against our
â¢ wish and interest. . We are now - trying s to do
what every prudent and sensible business man
would do under like circumstances, namely,
protect himself and his business.
It has been pretty well understood that you
have been fostering and favoring the outfit
that is principally responsible for the condi
tion of things regarding Which you now com
. plain. Under the circumstances it seems un
generous, not to say unjust, to hold our com
pany, responsible. ./. -
It may not be amiss to note in this connec
tion your very commendable efforts | in trying
to obtain terminal rates on shingles . from
Eureka, via San Francisco, destined East. We
beg to observe, however, that in calling atten
tion of the people of Eureka to this matter you
.advised them that certain vessels which you
name will carry shingles at the . rates referred
to, while you appear to have forgotten that the !
steamer, Pomona has been carrying shingles
for a year at lower rates than those you name,
as you will note by the inclosed rate circular, a
copy of which, we believe, you have on your
files. : ":Y:,. -.J
Permit us to call your attention to the fact
that Eureka is ; 437 miles from Portland and

THEY STEAL "ANYTHING.
An Organized (Jan. of Petty Thieves
Around McAllister and Baker Streets.
Petty thieves have been infesting 'the
neighborhood of . Fulton, Baker, Lyon and
McAllister streets during the past few
weeks, and ;Â» it * is a fortunate landlord who
finds his doormat in the morning. .
It is almost certain that the newspapers,,
milk and bread left in that neighborhood
are carried away by the thieves.
On Thursday" last they became, bolder,
and , prosecuted [- their : nefarious work at
midday. They entered the house of T. J.
.Campbell at 1813 McAllister.:" street arid,
nothing \ handier being sight, carried
away four batteries used in furnishing the
electric service. -' > 7 -v.
. The police have repeatedly been notified'
of. these petty ; and i annoying ; theft;*, but
have as yet â¢" been unable. to prevent them.

GATHERED IN BY PEPPER
The McLaughlin Stake Proved a
Gift for. Pat Dunne's
Brown Horse. .
SERVICE BACK IN THE RUCK.
Magnet Furnished a Rare Exhibition
of Speedâ Dolore a Very .
Hot Tip. ;..
The second of â¢ the California Jockey
Club's long distance events, the. McLaugh
lin stake over the cup* distance, two and
one-quarter miles, with a guaranteed
value to.tbe winner of $2000, was decided
at the Bay District track yesterday. The
talent picked the wrong ; horse, for they
plunged on Service and " Pat Dunne's ;
brown horse Pepper won* easily. â¢ Although
the game â¢ shows " symptoms -.of : approach
ing sluggishness, the attendance . was j
good considering the threatening state of
the weather. *
: The big event of the day, ..which was j
third on the card, called out but five start- J
ers. All were devoid of class, with "i the
exception of 'Pepper, *, but his ' recent per
formances have . been ; nothing ' to .-; exult
over, and although treated very ? leniently
by the I handicapper, '. who gave - him the
light impost of 100 pounds, the general
public- fought shy of him. Y The;. stable
folks, however, could 1 not let 3 and 3J_* to 1
go by and jumped aboard.
Service was the popular choice,' the books
holding him at odds varying from 4 to 5 to
7to 10. Fred Gardner with 97 pounds up
was backed down a couple of points from
sixes, and Doyle, one /of ' the other light
weights of * â  the : party, had his price ; cut
from = 150 t0.50 by; an intermittent v play.
Little Bob, the surprise of the race, was a
25 to 1 chance. . -: b b'
Â».; There was very, little dickering around at
the post. When * the ; flag fell Shields, on
Service went out in front, followed by Fred
Gardner, and the old; horse; cut a wide i
j swath for a mile and a half, when his sus-'
I picious forelegs began to burn and he
began falling back to the rear.
Y\ Cochran on Pepper then made 'his move,
and -going z by Y Fred Gardner ' showed ? the
route the , rest tof k the i way, ' passing i the
judges -an easy winner,, in 3:59}/_. Two
lengths; away Little Bob, *< who .' finished
gamely,' left the others 1 and I took second
place. Gardner finished in the show.' 7 -
Close finishes during the day were ,fow.
Four put of seven favorites got 'to the wire
in front and all struck ; rather easy game.-
The > track ' was* slow, preventing s any, fast
' time. 7 b' Y' : '-'b-yY7- ; y- *. 'â ' y : f'V"l y. 'Y '" â -â  .-
The crowd was treated to a rare exhibi
tion of sprinting powers in the last race of
the day, a six-furlong run. Dan Honig'-i
grand horse Magnet was one of l the en
tries and ruled a 4 to 5 choice in the betting. ;
Pitted against him 'i were * George i Miller,
Bellicoso and Sister Mary. The big chest
nut son of St. Blaise left his field as though |
they were standing still, and running with
mouth wide open and ears pinned back | as
though ' savage sat 'being restrained, fairly )
romped in the easiest ol winners in 1 1:14J4, j
a remarkably? tine performance. George
â  Miller finished in the place. Y'Y'y- â  :,.-.-â -â¢â 'â

but failed to get a mark. Linville, a4to 1'
chance, led i most . of the ( way and -won
easily from O'Fieeta. V V . v
With Rey del ":Barididos,b St. : Lee 1 and
Yankee Doodle scratched; the second race,
over a mile, proved a soft spot for Kamsin. ;
He was a 4 to; 5 chance in the ring, and, j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 1896.
passing Belle Boyd on the far turn, fairly
rolled in. Rebellion took the place just as
easily from Dare Dollar.
The game but unlucky Walter J seems
to j have j experienced a â - change of fortune,
for he' again scored a winning \ bracket *in
the fourth event at six furlongs. !Â§ Starting
with post odds of 6 to 1 he was away " ; well
and disposing of rjrametta by the time the
stretch was ' reach ed, ; and disputing every
inch of the road to the wire with Herman
ita. the second ; choice, finally won ; by/ a
nose. ; Artist, the 7to 5 favorite, was third.
The telephone horse.'Hello, has another
jumping race to â  his Â«>: credit. 'He ", was
played down ; from* twos: to 9 to 10 to win
the steeplechase, and leading from start to
finish passed the finishing post a couple of
lengths before Tom Clarke. V
." The two-year-old sprint with ten starters
developed one of the hottest tips that has
been passed around of late. Dolore, a filly
from the stable of Naglee Burk, was ham
mered down ' f rem 6 to 1 ; to ;. 8 to r5, and,
passing her field before a furlong had been
traveled, - won ridden out from r Scar
borough, a; 15 to 1; shot, who seemed to
suddenly inherit much speed. "

A PRINCE OF PHILATELY.
Hiram E. Deats â¢ of Fleming..--,
N. J., a Recent Visitor to
This City.
EXHIBITED SOME OF HIS GEMS.
His Collection ;of Stamps Worth More
Than $150,000â Plates of St.
Louis.
Among those who may be said to rank '
with the princes 'of ; philately in this coun
try is Hiram E. Deats of Flemington v N. J.,
who was ; a visitor ,in this City for some
thing more than a week, and who left on
Friday evening , for -Pasadena, where
and ; his wife spent the winter. V' There is
probably a collector "of I stamps of any
note in any part of 'the world who has not
heard of Mr.^Deats" and his wonderful col
lection of United States postage, revenue
and envelope stamps, his Mexican and
British North American treasures, and his
exceptional accumulation of United States
Postmaster's stamps and Confederate regu
lar and local issues. Yb : â 'f^BÃÃ^fS^Sk.

this world's goods to make him indifferent '
to the financial side i; of r any : : occupation or
fancy he may choose to .1 take up, so when
he makes the announcement that he is' a
farmer from New Jersey it : is â¢ rather with
the air that Miss Anna Shaw said would
be assumed by the new man, who would
take the greatest pride in being considered
one of the. toilers' of his day. â¢
- While Mr. Deats resorts to farmwork
when the fancy moves as one of his pre
yenlives'for ennui, he ,'; also y nurses., an
; intellectual fad in order,: that : he ' may not
come to -consider; that life is not j worth ;
.living.; Semi-occasionally,"as he confesses,
he publishes ; a'- paper; at, Flemington, de
voted to ;. the ; : local . history of i that * im
mediate section. V But for all round â¢ diver
sion he finds stamp-coliecting and all that
pertains thereto the most fascinating, satis-,
fying and lasting. His strongest predilec
tion, however, 5 in this ' connection *' is * for
philatelic literature. . *
, ; y He collects everything -that is published
on the subject, from a \ newspaper clipping
to the most expensive edition de luxe of a
monograph of some country's stamp. An
idea of the extent of his indulgence in this,
is obtained when it is stated that his dupli
cate philatelic papers number more than
200,000 copies. These are used for making
exchanges with other * collectors of I phila
telic >; literature. .';; .'He ;-; is r-a" subscriber fto
every philatelic paper published s to-day in
every part 'of vi the globe,' including some
from Johannesburg. South -Africa; Bom

After the regular business of the ; meet
ing had been disposed of Henry J. i
Crocker exhibited his collection; of plate 1
numbers of United States stamps: printed |
by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
which lacked not more tnan* twenty plate !
numbers to be complete. , Even the high
value newspaper stamps were in evidence,
though the $100 copies lacked the "imprint
and plate ~ numbsr. y Many; of the .1 plate
numbers were shown attached to half
sheets of the stamps. y V"*
Then Mr. Deats ; took a hand at enter
taining his . hosts and made a display of
rarities such as had never before been seen
in this City. V He was one of the few col
lectors of the country 1 who was ' fortunate
enough to y get copies .of some â ' of
the St. Louis stamps ;â¢ found at ; Louis
,ville,Ky, as described in the Christmas !
edition of The Call. And partly as the re
sult of the purchases made of them he was
able to make up two complete plates of six
stamps each of these extremely rare labels,
the least rare of which ; is ' worth $250 and
the ?; rarest *: $2500. ;. His ':, exhibit included ,
plates I and II and two stamps of plate 111. | '
Plates I and 111 consist of three 5 cent and
three 10 -cent stamps,* and plate II of one
5 cent, three ilO *: cent ') and two 20 ;; cent
stamps. The last named ,: plate is â¢ easily
wortn $10,000 and the value of all the copies
of these stamps shown ; by Mr. Deats is not
less than $15,00.. Ây ' â¢ Yy â  ' :., fy

less "than" 120 copies of ,. the - New York
5-cent ' stamp, a- label :of which most â  col

: i pal of the 7 Eureka High School, 7'
Charged With Grand Larceny.
Mrs. L.K. Grimm, wife of the ; principal
of the ! Eureka High School, 1 surrendered
herself "â â  at police- headquarters - yesterday
morning. She was booked at the City,
Prison on the charge of grand larceny and
was at once released on her 5 own recog
nizance by Judge Low. r l7
7 ln October, 1895. Dr. Arthur Marten of
118 ' Grant avenue swore out a warrant in"'
Judge Vj Low's court '"b for Mrs. Grimm's
arrest, alleging that she had stolen his
Office fixtures and furniture. .On Monday;
Dr. Marten called at "police headquarters
and said he- had > just learned:' that Mrs.
Grimm was in Eureka. He wanted a tele
gram sent at once to '. the Â» Sheriff ; there t to"
arrest her. ""Â» ' Chief Crowley investigated the
I case ! and decided j that the circumstances
I did; not 'call I for such extreme measures.';
He accordingly wrote 'to the Sheriff, and
received ? a reply that Mrs. Grimm would
leave by the first steamer. :
!"'- According to Mrs. Grimm, Dr. Marten's
'action is a piece ;of petty persecution. In
1893 and 1894, she said,* she kept a lodging
house at 903 Sutter* street. Dr. Marten ' |
was one of her lodgers, and ;he left owing j
her over $300 i for rent. She _ procured |a 1
lien 'on 'â¢ his office fixtures j and furniture,
and in April, 1894, when she gave up the
: house, fi she wrote *to Aim >to * c call $ for his
effects and '.nay ""his a bill. She received no
reply,** and the i fixtures and furniture were
sold to liquidate the bill.

Wong Sam, charged with importing
Dong Sun Yet, a Chinese girl, for immoral
I purposes, was held in $500 bonds by United
j States Commissioner Heacock yesterday.
j The evidence was strongly against the ac-
J cused. It was clearly : shown that he had
been engaged in The highbinder business,
and was a generally all-around bad China
. man. -,' fff
b Major/Moore, the special agent of thÂ«
I Treasury, Department, was the chief wit-
I ness yesterday. His evidence was more of
I a reflection :on the management of .the
Custom-house than it was on the charac-
I ter of Williams, the inspector whose life is
j made a burden by the many charges that
have been made against him.
His report against Williams was made
,to the *, Treasury Department on January
18, 1896. On January 31 he received V let
ter ", rom 7 Secretary > Carlisle \ to the effect
: that the information had been turned over
to Collector Wise. Wong Sam was one of
â¢ the chief .witnesses against Williams, yet
he was not arrested till February 11. - y
The inference drawn from this evidence
was; that there" was a conspiracy against
Wong ,> Sam . f: The V court *".- held $ that ; the
question of conspiracy did not arise in the
case. It was ;a; : question of Wong Sam's
guilt, and upon this issue the judgment
was rendered, y '.â â â > -Jy :
