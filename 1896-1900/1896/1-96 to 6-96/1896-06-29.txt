DISMAL OUTLOOK FOR PEACE
AT CHICAGO.
Western and Southern Men Will Die
tale to New Ergland and
New York.
CHICAGO, 111., Jane With the
. speeding of time toward the day when the
great Democratic National Convention of
1896 will assemble in the Coliseum at Jack
son Park, the sectional feeling within the
ranks of the party is becoming more pro
nounced. It has been encouraged to such
an extent by the threats of leaders of all
- factions that the flames of insurrection in
the Democratic camp may break forth at
any moment. The silver men, who are to
day easy masters of the situation, refuse to
take gold as a remedy for their ills, while
the so-called sound-money economists are
moving heaven and earth to force the
issue to a satisfactory and happy end.
The white metal adherents have raised
the battle-cry that the Ease, which has so
long controlled, the financial destiny of
the country, is determined to continue its
career of domination and coercion over the
South and West, and addresses have been
issued to delegates from the Mississippi
Valley and the States beyond the Missouri
to stand firm until the last shot has been
fired.
But is the hand of the East actually
raised against the West and the South?
That is the question which the wiseacres
of the party are discussing in Chicago on
this quiet Sabbath. The consensus of
opinion is that there is no enmity between
these sections. There is, however, a dif
ference of sentiment on certain great is
sues now betore the country, and this sec
tional and individual thought will cer
tainly find expression at the gathering of
the Democratic boats in the Coliseum next
week. In come breasts the feeling of re
sentment toward the great power of the
fEast is found to be strong, passionate,
bitter; others are generous of mind, mild
of manner and even of temper. Some
even hint at secession. But they are the
thoughtless and irresponsible persons who
know not whereof they speak.
It is only justice to the major portion of
the Eastern people, who are exceptionally
honest in their opinions and convictions,
to say that they have a fair conception of
the vastness and natural wealth of the
great Western empire and the restless en
ergy of its people. They realize the sturdy
character of the men who were the pio
neers of oar Western civilization. They
prais the dauntless courage of the heroes
who explored our mountains and valleys,
tracked our streams, settled our frontiers
and fought our Indian wars. They read j
the stories of romance and adventure so
minutely interwoven with the West but* a
quarter and ball century ago, and then
marvel at the great cities teeming with j
thousands of hustling people that have
sprung up on the Western borders and on
the Pacific Coast in that short time.
j Indeed, the phenomenal growth of the j
West has profoundly impressed the peo- !
pie of the East and they have undimin
lshed faith in its future greatness.
But the financiers of the East argue that I
their confidence in and friendliness for the ]
West must not mislead them to the altar
of the silver calf just because the West de
mands it. They add, with goodness of j
soul, that they will do so just as soon as
the other great nations of the world ac
cept bimetallism, and now that European
monarchs are spending their vacations
reading essays on the double standard
some of the readers of The Call may live
to witness the close of this merry war.
Meanwhile the "honest-money" Demo
crats propose to carry the battle into
Africa if need be to win their point. With
them there is no surrender. While the

silver men already claim a Waterloo, the
gold bues are actively hostile. It is cer
tain that neither side will abandon the
field until victory has been won.
Ex-Secretary of the Navy Whitney of
New York will arrive at the Auditorium
on Thursday. He will lead the gold fac
lion. Against him, as the commander of
the silver forces, will be Governor Altgeld,
who is billed to arrive at the Sherman to
morrow. Mr. Harrity, Mayor Quincy of
Boston, who conducted the literary bureau
of President Cleveland's last campaign,
and Benjamin B. Smalley of Vermont are
both coming to Chicago with Mr. Whit
ney.
There is much speculation as to who the
chairman of the National Committee will
name for temporary chairman. The sil
ver men say that any good Democrat who
has not been actively opposed to their in
terests will satisfy them.
Chairman Walsh of the lowa State Cen
tral Committee, whose particular mission
in Chicago is to secure the nomination of
ex-Governor Boies, said it would not make
any difference whether Mr. Harrity favoied
the sound money or silver Democrats; for,
no matter who is temporary chairman, the
majority of the convention will form the
permanent organization after its own
fashion.
"Mr. Whitney may think he is going to
run things in this convention," said Mr.
Walsh, "but he will find out after he has
been in Chicago twenty-four hours that he
has undertaken the most stupendous task
of his life. Everything he has done and
said up to the present time has been cal
culated to excite tbe antagonism of silver
Democrats of the West and South, who
feel that they are standing for a principle.
And in taking Harrity into conference at
his home he is making it apparent that he
is intriguing to secure control of the Na
tional Committee, so that he may name
the temporary officers of the convention.
Harrity can go into that plan if he wishes,
but I will make the prophecy right here
that the National Committee will not at
tempt to check the will of a majority of
the delegates to the convention. If it
does, the convention may take it into its
head to deprive the committee of some of
the powers that are now vested in it. "
"Has lowa any candidate for temporary
chairman?
"That is a matter we have not consid
ered yet. lowa, I think, will not stand in
the way of any good man being named to
preside over the convention until it is
permanently organized, so long as he is a
j good Democrat. Our mission here is to
I secure the nomination of Horace Boies
I for President of the United States."
With this feeling of resentment and an
tagonism in the party it is apparent that
the crisis of a great transitional epoch for
the National Democracy is at hand and
the largest experience and wisdom are in
demand. Frank McGuikk.
BLAND IN THE LEAD.
One Hundred and Six Delegates
Are Instructed for the
Senator.
CHICAGO. 111., June 28.â Sunday was
a quiet day in politics in Chicago, and
news was rather poor picking: â not even
of the spare-rib order â but good. Most of
the Democratic news is being churned in
New York, whose Democracy seems to be
in a rather feverish state, notwithstand
ing all the efforts of Drs. Whitney and
Hill to cure it with a dose of gold.
The handful of delegates here went to
church this morning, and after luncb
were lured to the lake, which is now beau
tifully blue, and found themselves on
steamboats plowing through the water,
with brass bands playing and pretty
girls smiling, so the down-town
hotels and the belated newspaper corre
spondents were left alone in their glory.
It will not be until toward the middle of
the weefc that anything of mucti impor
tance, in a political sense, will be doing
here. We are on the battle-ground before
the hostile armies bave arrived, and we
hear once in a while ihe report of a rifle
from the direction of the picket lines, the
yell of an enraged soldier and the groan of
a wounded one. New York is furnishing
all the yells and groans just now, because
there is a feeling in the air that tne con
vention will be likely to ignore the wishes
or the advice of the Knickerbocker State.
The silver Democrats have a sufficient
number of votes to carry things with a
high hand in the convention, and it is be
lieved that they propose to do business in
their own way without awaiting the
pleasure of New York, which State has
hitherto dominated the Democratic party.
If the silver men believe that it is neces
sary or expedient to repeal the time
honored two thirds vote, which has been
in vogue about a half-century, they will
SAIST FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, JUNE 29, 1896.
DOES WILLIAM CANUTE WHITNEY HOPE TO STAY THE INRUSH OF THE SILVER TIDE?
do so. The rule is simply usage, and a
majority at any time may change the
usage. They are not eoing to allow a cold
man to head tt>e ticket, no matter what
contingency may arise, and it seems likely
that Mr. Bland, who has been so promi
nently the champion of silver, will have
the advantage over ail the other candi
dates for the Presidential nomination for
that reason.
The friends of Boies of lowa and Mat
thews of Indiana are putting up a good
fight and are hopeful, but the best infor
mation that I can gather is that Bland is
in the lead, with Boies a good second.
There is also some Cleveland smoke in the
air, and from the large quantity of it I
should judge there was considerable third
term fire behind it.
It will be remembered that Cleveland
has never yet announced himself as being
opposed to the third-term proposition.
He would, of course, be acceptable to Wall
street and the goldbug crowd that fought
against McKinley in the St. Louis conven
tiop, but if bis name ev?r leaves the lip 1 ?
of any of the speakers in the coming con
vention there will be a demonstration the
reverse of flattering to Cleveland and his
friends. That divinity that doth hedge in
a king does not hedge in a President dur
ing hard times and under the baleful influ
ence of a tariff for revenue only. From
all indications, it will not hedge in this
Democratic National Convention.
Such is the temper of the few delegates
here. Such are the forecasts ticked over
the wires from all parts of the Union,
Mr. Bland has 106 delegates instructed
for him, and in this respect he is better off
than any of the other gentlem en who are
named as his competitors. It is under
stood that he is opposed to such a revolu
tionary proceeding as the abrogation of
the two-thirds rule. It will hardly be nec
essary, however, to resort to so violent a
procedure.
Notwithstanding the array of numbers
against them, the gold men are going to
make a shrewd and determined fight
under mask. The scheme is to announce
themselves as bimetallists, and to try to
convince the convention into the adoption
of a plank declaring for bimetallism by in
ternational agreement. This will satisfy
the gold men, and at the same time will
be acceptable to the conservative element
of the silveritesâ if such an element shall
appear in this convention.
William C. Whitney of New York will
be put forward as the standard-bearer of
the bimetallists, but he has a rocky road
to travel, for the majority sentiment of
the convention is free coinage on a basis
of 16 to 1.
Henry Teller of Colorado does not make
even a ripple on the surface of the politi
cal pool. He has no more chance of a
nomination than a cat in Helvetia without
claws on the smooth side of a glacier.
There are enough rabid silver men in the
Democratic party to choose from without
going over to a shelved Republican or a
raw Populist.
Up to the present writing, the aspect of
things political is thuswise: Bland in the
lead, the silver men in complete control
and the New YorK Democracy in a condi
tion similar to that of the New York Re
publicans in the St. Louis Convention â
without hope and without influence.
Myron D. King, private secretary to
Governor Matthews ot Indiana, is early
in the field in behalf of the Presidential
aspirations of his friend and employer. 1
had a talk with him at the Palmer House
to-day, and found him full of hope, and
energized with a full head of boom steam.
He said, in answer to questions, that sil
ver was going to dominate the convention,
but he did not expect that any of the gold
men would bolt. His confidence in the
true blue Democracy of all the delegates
was such that he felt assured that they
would abide by the will of the majority.
He had heard that the idea of rescinding
the two-thirds rule had been mentioned,
but he was not aware that it was being
seriously considered. Ttfe convention by a
majority vote could make its own rules,
and that matter would probably be the
first to come befcre the convention after
the report of the committee on creden
tials.
Mr. King was of the opinion that the
contest cases would be but few in number.
The most important were between a silver
and a gold delegation in Nebraska, be
tween two silver delegations in Nevada and
a contest in Michiean between silver ana
gold. His latest estimate of the strength
of the two factions was 578 silver and 328
gold; but in case the unit rule should be
broken the silver men will have 610 or 612
votes. It is likely that the unit rule will
be broken, silver being in the majority.
Mr. King did not think that Vice-Presi
dent Stevenson bad any strength. The
men most actively and in
tbe fight were Matthews, Boies and BlanJ.
This was the order in which Mr. King
named them, and he doubtless believed
that thie was the order of their strengtn,
Matthews being his man.
Such are the comforting delusions of
partisanship; and it is well that such de
lusions exist, because otherwise there
would be no battles if one side were bereft
of hope.
"Matthews of Indiana will certainly
have the logic of the situation," remarked
Mr. King cheerfully.
There is no dcubt that Mr. King was
right. Whether victorious or defeated
Governor Matthews will have the logic of
the situation, whatever the well-sounding
phrase may mean.
Chairman Harrity of tbe National Com
mittee will be here on Wednesday, and then
practical politics, as understood by the
Democracy, wilt begin to be done.
Among the guests at tbe Auditorium
are Mrs. Samuel M. Wilson an<l her grand
sou, Samuel M. VV'ilsor', U>it, o: Sr.z.
Francisco. They are on their way to the
East. John Paul Cosgbavb.
"COIN" PLANS A COMBINE.
General Partition of Spoils to the
Factions Opposed to
McKinley.
ASHLAND, Wis., June 28. â W. H.
("Coin") Harvey, in an interview here
yesterday, said:
"I am trying to combine the Democrats,
silver Republicans and Populists, and
have suggested the following plan to the
leaders of tbe parties: For Presidenton the
Democratic ticket "Silver Dollar" Bland
of Missouri. If elected give him the ap
pointment of one Cabinet officer only â
Secretary of State. Let the Democrats in
dorse the Populist nominee fur Viue-I're.-i
-dent on the Populist ticketâ Senator Ma
rion Butler of North Carolina. Let. the
Populists indorse the Democratic nominee
for President. Let Mr. Butler, if elected,
dictate the appointment of Secretary of
the Inferior, Secretary of Agriculture, S< c
retary of War and Secretary of the Navy.
Concede to the silver Republicans three
Cabinet positionsâ Senator Teller of Colo
rado, Secretary of the Treasury; John
Caidwell of the United States Circuit
Court, Attorney-General, and Mayor Pin
gree of Detroit, Posmaster-General.
"The silver cause is desperate, and we
can't beat McKinley unless we combine
as I have indicated, i have suggested the
plan to Altgeld. Bland and other leaders,
but i? has not been made public yet. I
tell the Democrats not to make their plat
form too Democratic. They cannot win
as Democrats, but as a combined Dem
ocracy, Populist and silver Republican. I
am in favor of Bland for President, be
cause his name is a platform in itself, just
as McKinley's name is a whole platform.
"The intention of our forefathers in
establishing our electoral system was that
the electors should be elected as they are
now, and that they should then meet,
and, after discussion, vote for whom they
wished. There is no law compelling an
elector to vole for any man. It is simply
custom. Now I want to tell you that if
the Democrats, Populists and free-silver
Republicans do not get together as I have
indicated they will ultimately combine in
the electoral college.
"The plan I suggest of dividing Cabinet
offices among these parties and of the dis
tribution of Cabinet officers will take care
of eight States. Pinjrree can carry Michi
gan, Teller half a dozen Western States
and Caldwell can carry lowa and the
Southwest. There are 10,000 Republicans
in lowa who want to vote for Caldwell.
There are eight Cabinet positions, and
their distribution in this way beforehand
would carry eight doubtful States for
silver." ,
HARTMAN'S SCHEME.
Would Bind Montana Electoral Can
didates to Vote for Teller
and None Other.
BUTTE, Mont.. June 28.â Congressman
Charles S. Hartman to-day addressed a
long public letter to Senator Lee Mantle,
chairman of the Republican State Com
mittee, outlining bis plan of campaign in
the interest of free coinage, and giving no
tice that he will introduce his plan in the
form of resolutions to the State Conven
tion. After relating his position and the
positions, past and present, of the Repub
lican party on the silver question, he says
he deeply regrets the necessity which im
pels him to decline to aid in perpetuating
the gold standard, with its legitimate and
consequent evils, upon the producers and
wage-earners of this country.
The substance of his plan for Republican
! silver men is to "vote for the electoral
ticket which will, in my judgment, be
nominated to procure the election o*
Henry M. Teller. Mr. TeUer is a platform
in himself. His record as a protectionist
is read with pride by every advocate of the
great principle, and as a leader of the bi
metallic forces he is the natural and log
ical candidate for President.
"I shall present to the State Convention
a resolution instructing the electors nom
inated by it to vote for Mr. Teller for
President and for no other man who is not
in favor of the free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, and also in
structing the present representative in the
| Fifty-fourth Congress that in the event
the election should be thrown into the
House of Representatives, that he shall
vote for Henry M. Teller and no other
man who is not unequivocally in favor of
the free and unlimited coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 toL"
Mr. Hartman's plan to keep the silver
Rpublicans within the party lines is vig
oroujly opposed by Hon. Thomas G. Mer
rill, treasurer of the American Bimetallic
Union. Mr. Merrill said in a interview
to-day that it would be the surest way to
throw the election into the House of Rep
resentatives where 28>Â£ votes would be
caat for a gold standard man and 16 fora
bimetallism and making positive the elec
tion of a gold man.
PANIC VS. NO PANIC.
How Delegate Wallace Views the
Issues Before the Democratic
National Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., June 28.â Hugh C. Wal
lace, delegate at large from the State of
Washington and a member of the Demo
cratic National Committee, who arrived
to-day from New YorK, where he has been
in conference with Mr. Whitney and other
sound money leaders, says:
"The talk of gold men coming to Chi
cago to buy silver delegates is all bosh.
There will be no attempt to coerce nor
will there be any unfair means used.
There will be a host of strong, earnest
Democrats from the East and other locali
ties of National prominence and leader
ship, who will come to dissuade the silver
leaders from party suicide. They will show
conclusively that the adoption of a 16 to 1
platform by the convention will mean an
nihilation of the Democracy of New York,
Connecticut and New Jersey. There are
those who believe these States liave been
tne bulwarks of Democracy in the past and
are ebsential in the future.
"Shpuld the convention adopt a 16 to 1
platform and nominate a silver candidate
it will not be thirty, days before the issue
is clearly defined and reduced to panic vs.
no panic, with the result tbat the com
bined business interests of the country
will be arrayed against that candidate
whose election means panic. No party
has ever succeeded with the business inter
ests of the country arrayed against it. It
la a long time between now and election
and the waae-earners of the country will
have abundant opportunity to reflect
whether their wages shall be paid in fifty
cent dollars."
HOPEFUL FOR SILVER.
Senator Jones of Arkansas Not
Alarmed by the Stand Chair
man Harrlty Has Taken.
CHICAGO, 111., June 28. â Senator
James K. Jones of Arkansas arrived in
Chicago to-day to attend the meeting of
the Bimetallic Democratic Convention
called for Tuesday next. Mr. Jones said
to-niL'ht that, the committee had a great
deal of work before the opening of the
convention.
"The outlook is very encouraging for
the free silver people," he said, "and we
are quite hopeful. It is our desire to sound
the opinions of delegates and take a view
of the situation further before the conven
tion is called to order. The gold element
is well organized. We wish to be pre
pared to look niter the appointment of
committees and see that we get a fair show
in that direction.
"I have read that Chairman Harrity ex
pects to exclude certain silver men from
the convention. I doubt that Mr. Harrity
has made such a statement, but if he has
we wish to know it. Tbe majority of the
National Committee are gold men, but I
do not think they will try to carry the
convention high handed."
WHITNEY A BOODLER.
Governor Altgreld's Opinion of the
Cold Advocates From East
ern States.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., June 28.â 1n re
ply to a question as to what he thought
DEATH IN A COLLIERY SHAFT,
of William C. Whitney's interview of
yesterday on the political outlook, Gov
ernor Altgeld said to-night:
"Nothing. I have nothing to say about
it. I have read it, but do not care to go
into any argument over it. The American
people are not ready to become the vas
sals of the English money-lenders and
their American agents.
"The policy which the Government has
pursued for more than twenty years at the
instance of these Eastern speculators com
pels the producers and consumers of this
country, who bear all its burdens, to give
those English money-lenders $2 worth of
labor, $2 worth of property and $2 worth
of their' life blood for each $1 that they
ever get from those Englishmen. This is
destroying our country, and the Demo
cratic party intends to condemn this
policy in most emphatic terms, and no
matter how much boodle those Eastern
speculators may be willing to spend they are
going to have a very difficult time in try
ing to prevent the party from expressing
its honest convictions on this subject."
PURCHASE OF ST. THOMAS.
One Clause In the St. Louis Plat-
form Causes a Sensation In
Denmark.
LONDON, England, June 28. â The
Times will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Copenhagen saying that the sugges
tion in tbe Republican platform adopted
by the St. Louis convention, that the
United States should purchase the Danish
colonies in the West Indies, creates some
sensation. It is believed that the Ameri
cans covet St. Thomas for a naval station.
The consensus of opinion in Danish cir
cles is that the Government is prepared to
sell at a suitable price.
The Times, in an article which it will
publish to-morrow, will indorse the cur
rency views expressed by the Hon.
W T illiam C. Whitney, but will say it re
gards his threat to secede from the Demo
cratic party as a last despairing effort to
stem the tide of silver sentiment and to
save the situation at the Chicago conven
tion. Possibly, for strict electioneering
purposes, the paper adds, the adoption of
a silver programme at Chicago will be a
good political move, but tbe Democrats
are in a tight corner and are not likely to
triumph in November.
JEROME ROWAN A SUICIDE
The Father of the Actress Who
Challenged Corbett Ends
His Life.
Gives His Reasons in a Letter Which
His Wil w R- loses to Make
Pub'ir.
BATAVIA, N. V.. June 28.â Jerome
Rowan, an ex-banker and father of Miss
Lansing Rowan, a California actress, who
has challenged Corbett to meet her in a
scientific sparring match, committed sui
cide yesterday in a baru in the rear of his
home in this village by shooting himself
through the heart. He left a letter ad
dressed to his wife, the contents of which
she declined to ruakp public.
Mr. Rowan was an eccentric man.
Some are of the opinion that his
daughter's challenge caused the act.
Miss Rowan has made her home with an
uncle in Los Angeles, Cat, since she was a
child. Mr, Rowan was t>6 years of age.
CHICAGO'S BOLD FOOTPADS.
Four Men Raid a Saloon and Attack
the Proprietor and One Is
Wounded.
CHICAGO, 111., June 28.â The thir
teenth hold-up of the series now running
resulted, about 10 o'clock to-night, in the
wounding of Rudolph Stiechel, a saloon
keeper at Kinsie and Leavitt streets,
whom four men attempted to rob, and in
the wounding of one of the bandits, who,
however, escaped with the rest of the gang.
Mr. Stiecliel was< cut about the head by a
wine bottle that one of the robbers broke
on his skull, and as the latter fled the
saloon-keeper, kneeling behind his bar,
hit the robber with a bullet. Frank Keer,
a customer, narrowly escaped death, a
bullet from the robbers revolver lodging
in a watch he carried in an upper pocket
of his vest directly over his heart.
When the bandits fled Officers Gretza of
the Warren-avenue station, Dudley of the
West Chicago-avenue station and* Watch
man Boss of the Panhandle Railway pur
sued them down the Northwestern
tracks, the fugitives finne behind them
and the officers emptying their revolvers
after them. Boss is certain that one of
his bullets hit the smaller of the men, as
he saw him stagger between two freight
cars. Search of the yards by officers failed
to reveal any trace of the wounded man
or his companion.
SIX PERSONS REORNED.
Taeht Capsize* Tturing a Gale on Lake,
ShotP'fno, Wis.
OCONTO, Wis., June 28.â During a gale
which prevailed on Showano Lake last
night a yacht containing nine persons was
capsized, and six were drowned. Their
names are: Margaret Crowe, St. Nazianz.
Wis. ; Mrs. Herman Drackery, Pnlciver,
Wis.; Louis Gokey, Puiciver, Wis.; Mrs.
Louis Gokey, Puiciver, Wis.; Miss Emma
Garbrech', Showauo, Wis.; Mrs. 0. A.
Risurn, Puiciver, Wis.
The party was on its way to the north
shore of the lake for a few days' outing.
The bodies of none of the drowned have
been recovered, as there is still a high
wind on the lakes, which makes it almost
impossible for boats to accomplish any
thing. Searching parties are being organ
ized, and the work of looking for the
bodies will be prosecuted as Boon as the
wind aoates.

WILKESBARRE, Pa., June 28.â The
little city of Pittston is in mourning
to-night as a result of another of the ter

many lives in Pennsylvania. A large
number of her citizens, variously esti
mated at from 80 to 125, are en

The disaster, which was at first at
tributed to an explosion of gas, is now be
lieved to have been caused by a general
cave-in on tbe lower levels. It was
noticed several days ago that the rock be
tween the fifth and sixth veins was "work
ing" and since that time a large force- of
men has been at work taking measures to
insure the safety of the mine. About 3
o'clock this (Sunday) morning, without
warning the roof of the level in which the
men were working collapsed with a shock
which aroused every one in the town,
causing them at first to think an earth
quake had occurred. The truth was soon
learned, however, and within two hours
thousands of excited people were gath
ered about the head of the shaft, the rel
ativ sof the unfortunate men below in
dulging in the wildest manifestations of
grief. The women and children who had
lost husbands and fathers were frantic.
But four men escaped from the mine,
and not one of them could tell a connected
story of how the disaster occurred, or what
was the condition of the lower levels. The
work of rescue was begun as soon as possi
ble, but the first four trips made into the
mine were without result. Later a con
ference of mining officials decided on a
more systematic plan, and a large force
was put to work with all necessary appli
ances to endeavor to reach the imprisoned
men. It was found impossible to work
through the mass of debris in the direction
of the regular passaees, and at a late honr
to-night it was decided to drive a gangway
from an adjoining colliery. This will un
doubtedly take several days, and it is
feared tbat in the meantime such of the
unfortunates as were not killed by the
cave-in will perish of starvation.
Nearly all tbe men in the mine were
married-, and some of them have large
families. As stated, the estimate of the2
entombed varies greatly, but the number
is certainly not less than eighty.
There were three separate shocks, ac
companied by rumblings resembling an
earthquake disturbance. They were so
strong as to awaken the peaceful slumbers
ol the people throughout East and West
Pittston. Immediately afterward an alarm
of the most thrilling character took pos
session of the entire population, which was
added to by the wild alarming whistle of
the Twin shaft at Pittston Junction, ac
companied by repeated fire alarms.
Hundreds of people rushed to the Twin
shaft, operated by the Newton Coal Com
pany', from which the doleful alarm came.
They found that the shock was due to an
extensive cave-in, accompanied by an ex
plosion which had occurred in the sixth or
lower vein of the shaft. It was soon
learned that no less than a hundred men
and boys were imprisoned in the pit.
The awiul news spread with lightning
rapidity and by 8 o'clock this morning
thousands of men, women and children
crowded about the head of the shaft, the
women and children particularly express
ing the wildest grief for their loved ones
in the dark pit beneath.
The hour following the alarm was one
long to be remembered by those witness
ing the anxious suspense of tne workmen,
the grief of the friends and the tender
sympathy for the afflicted ones. The
foreign element in particular, in their
piercing haranzues and their wild de
mands for their friends, made the weird
and harrowing sight one of peculiar
solemnity. Efforts were made to quiet
them by tendering the little encourage
ment possible, but unavaiiingly were those
efforts put forth. Mothers, fathers, daugh
ters, sons, brothers and sisters feared the
worst, and upon the first information re
ceived their fears were found to be well
grounded.
The first to come to the surface from
the shaft below after the explosion, which
carried in its wake from the pit solid
volumes of smoke and dirt, was John Gill,
wno had been at the bottom engaged in
labor. The force of the concussion threw
him with terrific force to the wall. More
dead than alive, he crept to the foot, and
with great diflicnlty signaled to the
engineer at the surface to hoist the
carriage. When he was brought up his
stories gave the few bosses present doubt
as to the safety of any of the men or boys
below. From him was secured the first
intormation of the number likely to be in
the shaft. The closest approximation was
that not less than 100 workmen would, or
have, suffered a horrible death.
Just at this period word came from the
pit that men were ready to be brought up.
Momentary only was the hope created, for
when John Riker, a runner boy, Jacob
Adam and FranK Sheridan, company men,
were brought to the surface, they told the
true story.
It appears that sereral days ago the
officials discovered that the rock between
the fifth and sixth veins had commenced
"working,' 1 and to prevent a continuation
of this all Jay Saturday and Saturday
night the full complement of day men and
such others as could be pressed into ser
vice from off the streets were set at work
pillaring and propping the sixth vein, so
as to insure the safety of the men who
were to go to work on Monday. On Satur
day night the regular night force was
working at a point about 3000 feet from the
shaft at the foot of the No. 3 plane, at n
point under what is known as the Flats, a
n.'tle east of the Coxton railroad yard?.
The force was under the superviÂ»ion of
Superintendent Langan and li is assistant,
Michael Lynott. Orders hp.d gone forth
that about midnight as many men as pos
sible should be sent down to assist in this
t*ing Q rous work, as constant cracking and
splintering o* the roof gave indication
mat the possibilities of danger wem most
strongly founded.
In accordance with this order, between
12 and 1 o'clock Snndav morning about
thirty additional workmen went into the
mine. This new force was placed at a
point beyond that of the light hands and
the news brought to the surface by the
three men ,who may be the only ones to
live to tell the tale, was that all of these
hundred or more men had been caught
and either crushed to immediate death or
imprisoned, to perish slowly by starv
ation.
After hearing this discouraging news
the large throng in waiting became more
demonstrative. It was found to the con
sternation of the workmen present on the
surface tnat all the mine foremen, super
intendents and bosses who had gone to
supervise the work had been caught below.
This left the work of relief without sys
tematic head, but the rescuers, providing
themselves with safety lamps, hurried on
the mine carriage and four were lowered
a thousand feet or more to the mission of
relief. They were: John Doyle, John
Daley, Charles McDonald and James Ten
yon.
After half an hour of suspense they re
turned with expressions of discouragement
and the sad story that the cÂ«ve-in had
become more extensive; that the search
ing party faced great dancer and that
the fate of the unfortunate men could not
be learned.
With no delay, however, they went
down with other men and again made
heroic efforts to obtain information, but,
battled and discouraged, were compelled
to return.
For a third time (now 2 p. m.), with more
ratn, they went beneath the surface into
the pit and tried by the counter gangway
to reach, by a circuitous route, the unfalP
tunate prisoners. After a journey of
nearly a thousand feet they met obstruc
tions Innumerable, the force of concussion
having created disastrous havoc, brattice
work, pillars, air conduits, doors, cars and
top rook being piled promiscuously so as
to interfere with all efforts that could be
made by any human being. Then, to add
to the trouble, gas had accumulated in
such quantities as to endanger any efforts
to reach the imprisoned miners. Not
daunted by these obstacles, they again in
effectively tried their last resource to re
lieve and recover the men.
General Manager John H. Law, who has
been seriously ill for some time, arose
from bed and untiringly worked to give
direction to the work of rescue. Special
messengers called to the shaft all of the
company's workmen. It was certain that
the mine was stil! caving in near the foot
of the shaft, thereby endangering and
making it practically impossible to con
tinue the labor without propping up tha
way as the rescuers went in. Carriaee
after carriage of props were sent to the
bottom, and, under charge of Foreman
Eaean of the Phoenix mine, Mr. Maloney
of the Raven shaft and Mr. McMillan of
the Barnum shaft, much progress was
made in this work, and soon the imminent
danger was prevented and fifty men were
pushing their way to the foot of No. 3
plane, the scene of the extensive cave-in.
Soon word came up that the mules were
alive, and this fact gave the anxioua
watchers encouragement, lending beliel
to the impression that the explosive
sounds heard were due to no pas explo
sion, but only to the rush of air created by
the sudden caving of the earth. The sup
position that a gas explosion had occurred
was later in the afternoon refuted em-
by General Manager Law. The
hopes of life for the imprisoned men, as a
result of the discovery of the unharmed
mule?, were again shattered by later dis
coveries.
At 6 o'clock this eveninjr the aspect was
decidedly gloomy. Mine Inspector Mc-
Donald is on the ground and went to the
foot of the sha ft, where he made a roost
thorough investigation. He used the
knowledge gained by twenty-five years' ex
perience and determined that no rescue
could then be made. He confirmed the
stories of his predecessors in the work of
rescue. The fanhouse had not suffered
any injury, and so far as travel was pos
sible the air currents were perfect. This
fact gave hope to the management that a
sufficient volume of air could be forced to
the rear of the cave-in by sending it in a
roundabout way.
A consultation of the leading mine su
perintendents of Lackawanna and Wyom
ing valleys was held this afternoon. Re
ports by experienced foremen who had
siade these rescuing trips were listened to.
The fear was expressed that possibly the
Susquehanna River, near by the cave,
was running into the mine. This, how
ever, was merely supposition, as nothing
inside justified the opinion. The pump in
this locality is under the cave and its work
is entirely prevented.
At the meeting the possible number of
imprisoned men was mentioned, but this
question is wholly a problem, as the entire
force of bosses and company men â in fact
ail from whom this information could be
derived â are in the pit below. For this
reason the subject of the missing ones is
entirely conjectural.
At 11 o'clock to-night a force of sixty
men from neighboring collieries went into
the shaft to aid the rescuing party. They
will stay until morning. The men are all
old, experienced miners.
At midnight, after looking over the sit
uation carefully, the leader of the rescu
ing party decided the best thing to
do was to drive a gangway through
the coal from the Clear Spring
colliery adjoining into the Twin
shaft, where it is possible to locate tLe
men. The wcrk was at once begun, and is
being pushed with all the speed possible.
This task, however, will consume three or
four days. In the meantime the work will
be pushed by the rescuers in the Twin
shaft. It is now the opinion of the most
able miners that it will take several days
to find the entombed men.
At 12:30 a. m. a gang of men belonging
to tlie rescuing party which went in at 6
o'clock last night came to the surface and
reported that they were making headway,
though it was slow work. The roof con
tinues to settle and more or less danger is
present. They are within 800 feet of the
cave-in. Gas appears to be accumulating,
which makes the labor difficult aud delays
the work to a great extent. No hopes are
now entertained for the safety of any of
tlie men.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 2Â£, 1896.
GOSSIP OF THE
GERMAN CAPITAL,
Prince Yon Hohenlohe Is
About to Resign the
Chancellorship.
A GRAND DUKE'S SPEECH
Its Vigorous Loyalty Commented
Upon Throughout the
Empire.
FUGITIVE LAWYEE CAPTURED
Eanished Prom Germany, He Will
Make His Home in the United
States.
BERLIN, Germant, June 28.â At the
close of the debate on the question of the
second reading of the Government's civil
code bili in the Reichstag yesterday Prince
Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chancellor, made
an important announcement in relation to
the existing prohibitory regulation* in re
gard to political associations havine ram
ifications with each other. The Socialists,
upon whom these prohibitory regulations
have been especially operative, bad moved
the repeal of the measure, but the cham
ber would not assent to its abrogation.
Prince Hohenlohe stated that the debate
need continue no further, as modifications
of the prohibitory measures, which were
tantamount to their repeal, were already
under consideration by the Bundesratb.
In the talk in the lobbies yesterday the
matter of Prince Hohenlohe's early retire
ment from the Chancellorship was re
vived, and members of the Reichstag who
are associated with the Chancellor's inner
circle affirmed that it was absolutely cer
tain that he would resign within a very
short time. Indeed, they asserted the
Chancellor was only awaiting the passage
of the civil code bill when he would hand
his resignation to the Emperor. Count
Philip Eulenberg, German Embassador to
Austria, who is a close personal friend ot
the Kaiser, Prince Furstenburgand Prince
yon Hatzfeidt zu Trachenburg are men
tioned most prominently as candidates for
the succession. The claims of Count
Eulenberg are based wholly upon the
favor of the Emperor, and Prince Fursten
burg, although recovering from his attack
of eout, is said to have disclosed to his
physicians a tendency to diabetes, which
would render the active performance of
the duties of Chancellor a source of danger
to him.
According to the court circle the Kaiser
recently communicated with Prince yon
Hatzfeidt zu Trachenburg expressing his
intention to appoint the Prince to the
office of Chancellor of the empire, to which
the latter replied that he did not feel suf
ficiently energetic to undertake the ardu
ous duties of the post. The Emperpr, ac
cording to the authority quoted, rejoined
by saying that the Prince's energy would
develop once he had assumed the office,
but it is understood that the Prince is still
begging off, and it is generally believed
that his reluctance to take the office is
genuine.
The newspapers throughout Germany
are quoting and commenting upon a nota
ble speech recently delivered by the Grand
Duke of Baden upon the occasion of his
inauguration of the ceremonies marking
the twenty-fourth anniversary service in
memory of the soldiers of Baden who were
Killed in the war of 1870. The speech was
clearly in response to the remarks of
Prince Ludwlgof Bavaria at the dinner
piven to the German Princes by the
Deutsche Verein at Moscow upon the occa
sion of the coronation of the Czar, when
the heir apparent to the Bavarian throne
protested against being alluded to as a
member of the suite of Prince Henry of
Prussia, and declared that he was an ally,
not a vassal of Germany, and was aiso in
tended to rebuke those who have taken
part in the consequent particularist dem
onstrations in the South German States.
The Grand Duke in the course of his re
marks said:
"What ought to be the practical out
come of the celebration in honor of the
foundation of the empire? We must
swear to maintain it and must be ready to
engage in a struggle not only against
foreign enemies but against internal ene
mies. I wish to hold fast to German
unity."
The Grand Dnke concluded his remarks
by calling for cheers for the Kaiser.
ThÂ« trial of the Berlin lawyer, Fritz
Friedmann, who absconded some months
ago, leaving debts aggregating large sums,
and was subsequently arrested In France
and brought back to Germany, has been
the talk of society during last week. The
crowds which packed the courtroom were
openly in sympathy with Friedmann, and
were largely composed of his former
friends and old clients who were extricat
ed from trouble at one time or another by
Friedmann's adroitness. The president
of the court treated him with a degree of
indulgence that was not shown to Baron
yon Hammerstein when that unfortunate
politician was arraigned before the same
tribunal. During the long pause which
took place before his acquittal was an
nounced by the jury Friedmann was sur
rounded by his intimates, to whom he
narrated in a humorous way his adven
tures after his flight and his experiences
In a French prison.
After the trial Friedman celebrated his
release with a grand dinner, at which a
number of his old friends 'were guests.
The Court gave him until Saturday to quit
Germany. It is the Intention of Friedman
to settle in the United States.
The newspapars publish varying so
called authentic reports of the interview
which took place between Li Hung Chang
and Prince Bismarck upon the occasion of
the visit of the Chinese Viceroy to the ex-
Chancellor at Friedricbsruhe, last week,
but the substance of the report
published in the Berlin Post is gen
erally believed to be correct. According
to tiiis version Li Hung Chang asked the
Prince how he would best set about re
forming and reorganizing affairs in China,
to which Prince Bismarck replied that the
best way to bring about the results sought
would be upon the buais of a well-drilled
army, no matter how small, even of 50,000
men. The Prinoe also told the Chinese
statesman that he should create means of
communication which would enable him
to throw bis army against any point. In
acknowledging the Prince's words, Li
Hung Chang said that he would treasure
the advice of the ex-Chancellor and act
thereon, reorganizing the Chinese army
with Prussian officers and upon the Prus
sian model.
Li Hung Chang had a long conference
with Viscount Aoki, the Japanese Em
bassador to Germany, yesterday.
The question of the succession to the
throne of Lippe has been referred to the
arbitration of the Kine of Saxony, as
sisted by the Supreme Court of the Empire
at Leipsie.
In consequence of the insults which the
lower sort of .Berlin workingmen are ac
customed to offer to officers of the army,
the latter are becoming very chary of
going into public places in uniform. An
illustration of the wanton character of
these assaults may be given in accounts of
an incident which occurred last week. An
officer, walking in the street with his sis
ter, was stopped by a laborer named Karl
Fulge, who, without provocation, ad
dressed him in the foulest language and
finally threw him down and tried to
choke him to death. The officer was res
cued by a soldier, and as a result of the
soldier's interference Fulge was carried to
the hospital on a stretcher.

JUBILEE OF ENDEAVORERS
Great Preparation at Washington
for the International Con
vention.
Public Parks and Gardens Adorned
and the City Is Donning
Gala Attire.
WASHINGTON. D. C, June 28.â Much
enthusiasm is manifested here over the ar
rangements for the International Chris
tian Endeavor Convention which will as
semble July 8. The city will soon put on
gala attire, and the officials in charge of the
public parks and gardens have laid out the
Christian Endeavor monograms and com
binations of the letters *'Y. P. S. C. E." in
flowers and gayly colored leaves in the
parks of the city. The churches are also
actively planning for elaborate decora
tions. Ths National colors will, of course,
play an important part in these, and in
addition the special colors of the State
which church will entertain will be
used effectively.
From present indications it is likely the
decorations for the business houses will
exceed those of previous gatherings. Three
mammoth tents are about to be erected on
the White lot, and the seating
capacity of five large churches in
the immediate vicinity of the
tents will soon be increased to the utmost
by the addition of folding chairs. Thus
nine simultaneous meetings with an audi
ence of 40,0<X> will be conducted through
out the sessions of the convention.
ThÂ« prosr+amme, which has been neariy
completed, includes some of the best
speakers in the country, and also several
widely know clergymen and mission work
ers from across the seas. The liÂ«t includes
Postmaster- General Wilson, Hon. John

Great attention has been given to the
work of organizing the choir which will
lead the singing at the meetings. Over

been regularly rehearsing every week for
the past two months.
The Christian citizenship and temper

MINERAL PRODUCT STATISTICS.
Improved Conditions Indicating a Long
Step Toward Recover/ From
Hard Times.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 28âAc
cording to official statistics just issued by
the Director of the Geological Survey the
total value of the mineral products of the
United States for 1895 increased over $80,
-000,000 beyond the value for 1894, or from
$527,368,594 to $611,795,290. This increase
is considered a long step toward recovery
from the depression to which the mineral
industry, like all others, has been sub
jected.
While the coal product is great, it is
much steadier, in spite of the extra de
mand for it in order to produce an extra
supply of iron.
Another noticeable feature was the
profitable producing petroleum districts in
the Appalachian range. Natural gas
showed a decline, the pressure decreasing
In all the fields, thereby shortening the
life of each well and greatly reducing the
product, especially in Pennsylvania.
Almost all the remaining minerals show
substantial improvement.

COMMODORE FIRED UPON.
lliree tthot* From a Revenue Cutter
nhiz by the Vessel.
CHARLESTON, S. C, June 28.â The
Commodore steamed up tne harbor this
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. Captain Mor
ton says:
"When the Commodore arrived in
Tampa her papers were examined and
found to be all right. Then s c was
searched for arms, and of course none
were found. For two days we lay in the
harbor and on Thursday we set sail with
no cargo, and with the proper clearance
papers for Charleston. Before we left the
harbor we were lying very near to the
revenue cutter McLean, and if the officers
of that vessel wished to examine the Com
modore and its papers every opportunity
was afforded them.
"We steamed from the harbor very
slowly, for the machines were not in the
best of workinsr order. When we were
two miles out I heard the report of a gun
and saw tne McLean behind us. Bang!
went another, and I ordered the engines
stopped an'i we waited the arrival of the
pursuer. Bang! went the third, and a
solid shot whistled by us, falling not forty
feet from the vessel. The wind from the
shot as it passed was felt on the face of
every man on deck. If it had struck us
the Commodore would have beeD sank.
"The captain of the vessel came aboard
and I asked what this outrage meant. His
reply was that he wanted the vessel to
stop and wanted to examine its papers.
He asked if we carried a passenger list,
and I told him no. He examined my pa
pers, went through the vessel and found
everything correct. He then left us and
we continued on to Charleston on a peace
ful voyage."
Captain Morton said he would probably
leave for New York in a few days, and
that the Commodore would remain in the
harbor.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, June 28.
â Georgi Pasha Berovitch, Prince of Sa

island of Crete. Abdullah Pasha, whom
he replaces in the Governorship, will re

Since 1832 the island of Samos, which
lies off the west coast of Asia Minor,
seventy-two miles southwest of Smyrna,
has been an autonomous principality or

piastres to Turkey. The island is undor
the rule of a prince of Greek nationality
named by the Porte, its autonomy being
guaranteed by Great Britain, France and
Russia under the protocol of 1832. The

SUED BY FRESNO LAWYERS
County Clerk Hart Defendant in
an Action Brought to
Test a Law.
Determining the Constitutionality of a
Fortion of the County
Fee Bill.
FRESNO, Cal., June 28.â Attorneys G.
B. Graham and George Cosgrave yester
day commenced suit against County
Clerk T. G. Hart to test the constitution
ality of that portion of the county fee bill
which requires the payment of $2 before a
clerk flies a demurrer in an action.
The issue was raised by an application
from the plaintiffs to have thirteen sepa
rate demurrers filed in a case pending in
court. The clerk refused to place the de
murrers on the motion calendar until $26
was paid. They refused to pay and now
demand a writ of mandate to compel him
to rile the demurrers or give hi* reasons
for refusing to do so.
The real object is to tent the validity of
the law. Clerk Hart has been acting
under the advice of District Attorney
Snow in collecting fees. The law is some
what vague, and clerks of various counties
have established various rules.
HIGH PRICE FOR RAISING.
Growers Hare JXot Lost by the Shortage
in the Crop.
FRESNO, Cal., June 28.â The shortage
of the coming raisin crop on account of
late frosts will undoubtedly be a boon to
the industry. Buyers are now in the Held
offering 2lÂ£ cents a pound in sweat box.
This is a better price than growers have
realized for the past three or four years
under the commission system of selling.
The offers are for cash, and they start the
movement for the dealers to buy from
growers, instead of handling raisins on
the business commission plan.
Because it is short, the crop will be of
good quality. About twenty-five carloads
of raisins, the last Jot in the county from
Isst year's crop, were sold yesterday by
George F. West & Sons, to the California
Raisin and Fruit Company, at 2% cents.
Eastern markets are said to be bare of
raising, and growers are elated over
prospectÃ.
S NAHAMARIANS'S ESTATE.
Four Application* for Letters of Ad

FRESNO, Cal., June 28.â There are four
applications for letters of administration
on the estate of Stephen Sliahamarian, the
Armenian who was assassinated Â«everal
weeks ago, together with his son and
daughter. One application on file is by
the trustees of the Stockton Insane
Asylum, of which a daughter of Shaham
arian is an inmate. Another is by Jacob
Sliahamarian, a brother of the deceased,
and a third is by the Public Administra
tor, L. H. Church. The fourth is by T. A.
Bell, a real estate agent of this oity, who
asks to be appointed for the reason that
the friends of the insane daughter, who is
the only surviving heir, want bin to act
as administrator of the estate. The
property is valued at $2500.
Imprisoned Without Cause.
FRESNO, Cal., June 28.â A suit for
$10,000 damages was yesterday brought in
the Superior Court of this county by Owen
Reilly against ex-Under Sheriff George L.
Moore, on the ground that the plaintiff
was arrested for perjury on a complaint
sworn to by Moore, when there was no
cause for the action. The arrest was made
by officers of Judge bt. John's court on
January 10, aÂ»d Riley spent five days in

)eath by Boiling.
In old England before the law was passed
which prohibited "cruel and unusual
forms of punishment,"' murderers were
often condemned to death by boiling. In
such cases the victim were chained in large
kottles of cold water, which was gradually
heated until it caused the flesh to drop
from the bones. The last English victim
of the "boiling death" was one Rouse, a
cook, who, v is alleged, had killed 17 per
sons,âSt. Louis Republic.
BURIED UNDER
REDHOT BRICKS,
Awful Disaster at a Con
flagration in Augusta,
Georgia.
A BIG MILL IS CONSUMED
Wail Falls Upon the Firemen
While Fighting the
Flames.
ONE DEAD AND TWO DYING.
Others More or L?ss Injured, and
There Were Several Narrow
Escapes.
AUGUSTA, Ga., June 23.â One man
dead and two dying at the City Hospital,
with several others injured, is tne result
of a fire which destroyed Miller & Co.'s
big mill on Twigg street this morning.
The los 3by the fire is probably $40,000 and
the insurance $12,000.
When discovered at 1:45 a. m. the mill
was on fire in the third story of the main
building, an iron-covered structure with
wooden framework. The flames spread
from the big iron-covered mill to the
smaller brick warehouses with great
rapidity. Being covered entirely with
heavy corrugated iron, the flames for a
long time were confined to the building
itself. The casualties are:
Dead â Aaron Morton, colored, driver for
Superintendent of Fire Alarms.
Injuredâ Mike Riley, hook and ladder;
cannot recover.
Gabe Waiters (colored); badly mangled.
â Fredericks; legs broken, internal in
juries, cannot recover.
Bob Weafcley, engineer Company No. 2;
left leg broken, head cut.
Henry J. Kale, ladderman on hook and
ladder; cut about head.
Ben Puefher, chemical engineer; cut
about bead.
It was an hour and a quarter after the
first alarm before the tnfgedy occurred.
The brick warehouse had a gable end to it,
and while atteiapting to put a stream
through a hole made in the gable the
brick wall fell. ,
A fireman had been on a short /adder
and knocked out some of the bricks. A
long ladder was needed to put a stream up
and Aaron Morton and several firemen
went to the truck and got a 30-foot lad
der. As they placed it to the wall Ladder
men Riley an i Morton had held of it. As
soon as it touched the side of the wall the
wall was seen to sway and then came tum
bling down. The two men on the ladder
could not eet out of the way and were
buried beneath the redhot bricks. Others
were overtaken by the falling missiles.
Besides the firemen there were few people
at this locality.
Lieutenant Cartledge of the police force
and Wallace Wheeler of the Chronicli 1
were near the foot of the ladder and only
bad time to jump back as the wall came
crashing down.
The fire is of unknown origin.
OUTRAGES IN PORMOSA.
An . Antl-Clirliitlan Movement â Many
Village*) Plundered and Burned.
Reuters Agency has received news of
the outbreak of an anti-Christian move
ment in Formosa and of the dispatch of a
Japanese expedition to the east coast,
where the disturbances have occurred.
Writing from Painanfu, Formosa, on
April 17, Rev. Thomas Barclay of the
Presbyterian Mission in the island says:
"I am sorry to say that last week we re
ceived bad news from the east coast
churches. About the 7th of. March one of
the Christians resident on. the seashore
was visited by sixty or seventy refugees,
who had crossed from the inner valley,
bringing news of an organized attack on
the Christians there. A number of run
away soldiers from, the north of the island
had come down south spreading false re
ports of the Christians being in league
with the Japanese.
"They succeeded in stirring up the Chi
nese, who came in two bands, one from
the south and one from the north, and
swept the aboriginal villages, especially
those where Christians lived. During the
last week of February village after village
was plundered and burnt, the inhabitants
being compelled to take fo the hills. Two
churches were destroyed. The preachers,
however, succeeded In escaping. In some
cases the Chinese followed the fugitives
and took away their bullocks and grain.
Rewards were offered for the capture of
preachers and office-bearers. We hear that
, several Christians have been killed, but do
not know exactly how many have lost
their live*. That was more than a month,
aeo, and we have no idea what has since
happened. It is reported that the Japan
ese have already reached the scene of the
outrages and have restored order, but the
Japanese authorities can give us no infor
mation."

FOR REPUBLICANS
Party Leaders Gathering
for the Notification
Ceremony.
THURSTON WILL SPEAK.
Major McKinley's Reply to the
Committee Awaited With
Interest.
PLANS FOE THE CAMPAIGN.
Political Speeches to Be Made in Many
States by the Standard-
Bearer.
CANTON, Ohio, June 28.â city of I
Canton has witnessed a great many J
demonstrations of an enthusiastic nature j
since Major McKinley was nominated, !
and there have been thousands of j
strangers within her gates. Men of wide \
reputation in politics, statecraft and busi- j
ness have called upon the candidate to
"pay their respects," as the formula is, or
to keep themselves well within McKinley's |
field of vision. All the demonstrations j
and visitors up to this time, however, i
have been of an unofficial if not informal
character. To-morrow the advent of the
notification committee, composed of one
member from each State and Territory,
â elected by the National Convention at
Bt. Louis for the purpose of conveying to
the candidate official notice of his nomina
tion, will be an event of more significance
and importance than the coming of all the
other visitors and delegations which Mc-
Kinley has received.
The chairman of the committee, Senator
John M. Thurston of Nebraska, was the
permanent chairrran of the St. Louis Con
vention and achieved a large measure of
National distinction in that capacity. He
is an orator and will be the spokesman for
the committee to-morrow. Major McKin
ley is very fond of Senator Thurston and
said a day or so ago he thought his selec
tion for permanent chairman of the con
vention was the best that could have been
made, with the possible exception of Gov
ernor Foraker.
Governor McKinley's speech in reply to
Senator Thurston will be scanned with
interest. It will not be long and he will
not at this time attempt to discuss in a
significant or elaborate way the dominant
issues of the campaign. Nothing in the
way of an exhaustive formal utterance
may be expected until he publishes his i
letter of acceptance, which will be in a I
month or six weeks. That is the usual j
time a candidate allows to elapse between !
the date of his official notification and the 'â 
publication of his official acceptance of
- the nomination.
The publication .of the letter of accept- \
ance really opens the campaign, and for I
that reason all of the candidates will be
disposed to defer the writing of their j
letters for a few weeks. In the mean- j
time the National committees will or- !
ganize and be ready to go forward with
the campaign work.
Before McKinley gives his letter of ac
ceptance to the public, he will probably ]
make a short visit to Roxbury, Mas?.
When the campaign is well under way ;
and a host of minor candidates are in the 'â 
field, each one hoping or expecting to
carry his district or his State, the de- j
mands upon McKinley for speech-making I
â¢will be urgent and frequent. Several ;
Republicans of influence and high stand
ing have talked with McKinley upon this
point, and some of them have endeavored j
to secure from him a promise to make â¢
speeches in their States. Major McKinley I
has not committed himself, nor has he j
said he would not yield to their demands I
upon his strength and time. He prefers '
to remain in Canton during the campaign,
and at present his close political friends j
incline to the belief that this will be the '
wiser course to pursue. But conditions ;
may change, and if they do and it seems
best for Major McKinley to take the
stump he will do so. If he makes a speak
ing tour it is safe to say that among the
States upon his itinerary will Indiana,
Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and
Nebraska. ,
THURSTON ON THE BOLT
Deems It Significant That Only Sen
atorial Candidates Left the
Convention.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. June 28. â The
members of the notification committee
were all assembled h^re to-night, with the i
exception of Rogers of Utah, who tele- â 
graphed that he could not come. The
committee goes to Canton to-morrow
morning. Senator Thurston, chairman of
the committee, said to-night:
"I do not think there is any question
that McKinley will win a great victory, but
by what plurality 1 cannot estimate. I
think we will lose Colorado, Utah, Nevada.
Idaho and Montanaonaccountof silver. 1
do not think we can ?ave them. The rest
of the Western States will wheel into line
for McKinley. I think the fight will j
shortly settle down, and the tariff will
force the money issue into second place.
"Senators Teller and Dubois will be re
elected to the Senate on the silver ticket.
It is rather significant that these two
Senators were the only ones to bolt and i
that they were both up for re-election in I
silver communities. Those who did not !
bolt were not up lor another term.
"I have no idea what Mr. Hanna will
do about the executive committee's head
quarters. I think he should be allowed
to fix them wherever it is handiest for his
interests."
WATER FOR SAN DIEGO.
The Construction of the New System
Will Be Commenced at
Once.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., June 28.â The South
ern California Mountain Water Company
to-morrow morning begin the con
struction of the Moreia dam and conduit
to the city and ttie building of a distrib
uting system in the city, in pursuance of
the contract which was ratified yesterday
by the voting of $1,500,000 of bonds, by the
city. E. t. Bibcock, president of the com
pany, was in consultation with hi 9 en
gineers at Hotel del Coronado to-day, and
the result was that orders were issued for
two corps of engineers to take the field
this week. Bids for the freighting of
cement, lumber, machinery and merchan
dise to the dam, which is fifty miles to the
east in the mountains, have been called
for. The company asks for 400 horses and
100 wagons.
Mr. Babcock has had strong faith all
along that the people would vote the
bonds, and accordingly ordered five car
loads of machinery some time ago. This
arrived last week. " This consists of a com
plete Ledgerwood cable and trolley for
handling large quantities of rock.
Another plant oi the pamc size is al
ready in place at Lower Otay dam, and
the new plant will be sent out this week
to join it. A lull force is to be put on to
finish T,ower Otay dam. while preliminary
work is being done at Morena. Then the
machinery will be removed to Morena,
where the dam can be built in a short
time, as the rock is aimost overhanging
the dam site. Lower Otay cam is part of
the extensive system of the company,
which consists of dams at Upper and
Lower Otay, Barretts and Morena, capable
of impounding: about 10,000 inches of
water in all and irrigating 75,000 acres of
land.
The construction of this gigantic system
depended upon the voting of bonds by the
city for the Morena dam, thereby assisting
in the development of the country as well
as furnishing a supply of 1000 inches for
the city, sufficient for a city of 100,000 in
habitants. The city owns 7000 acres of
fine lands within its limits, which will be
be made very valuable with water.
AH day long the people have kept up a
noisy jubilee over the result of the bond
elections, and telegrams have poured in
upon the city officials and Mr. Babcock
congratulating them upon the new era
inaugurated.

CAMPING AT GLENWOOD.
Christian Workers Gather at
the Pretty Mountain
Resort
Missionary Conquests Planned While
the Students Enjoy an
Outin;.
GLEN WOOD, Cal., June 28.â The Mis
sionary Extension Summer School, in
session here, is attracting large numbers
of church people from various parts of the
const, and particularly from San Fran
cisco. They take this means of combin
ing their summer outing with Christian
work. This camping school is under the
direction of the Missionary Extension So
ciety of San Francisco, and that fact draws
a great many from the City, but Oakland
and San Jose and other towns in the
neighborhood send many visitors and
workers.
The past four days have been devoted
principally to the subject of "City Evan
gelization," and to-morrow a course of
Bibie lessons on "The Li/eof Christ" will
benin, to be conducted by Rev. W. W.
Scudder Jr. He will demonstrate with tne
u=s of charts and diagrams, illustrating
the years of Christ's public ministry. At I
the close of this series of lectures Rev. |
Melville H. Tenny of San Jose will deliver j
two lectures on "The Life of Christ in j
Art," which he will illustrate with stere
opticon views that include the great paint
ings of tne various events in the life cf
Christ, from his birth to his asr-ension.
The lectures will be of a nr.ture that will
impress the audiences with the grandeur
of Christ's character and the loving esteem
in which he was held by the world's great
master- in art.
The programme of work for the school
includes daily denominational conferences
on missions in charge of the representa
tives of the Denominational Board of
Missions and also a series of evening lec
tures on city, home and foreign missions.
Mrs. Sarah D. Hamlin, associated with
Pundita Ramabai in India, will deliver a
lecture on the Sorabji family and give a
good deal of useful and novel information
concerning the missions in India from her
view as a traveler.
The Fourth of July will be celebrated,
anl, large excursions of Christian En
deavor societies from San Francisco and
Alameda counties will arrive on that holi
day.
The summer school is not all work and
no play. The class work is done in the
forenoon hours and the afternoons are
given up entirely to recreation. Some of
the visitors po bathing, others trout fish
ing or boat riding, while others occupy the
afternoons in walking or driving on the
delightful roads or climbing the hills.
A great many of the students and teach
ers are camping, their tents forming a
picturesqne scene in the wood, while
others prefer the accommodations of the
Glen^ood Hotel, which stands at the en
trance to the camping-ground.
LEE AND McCLELLAN.
Their First Sleeting as Described by the
Latter After the Civil War.
Entertaining papers giving reminis
cences of "The Lost Cause" were read yes
terday afternoon at the meeting of the
Daughters of the Confederacy. In a paper
prepared by Mr. George Savage and read
by Mrs. D. Giraud Wright was described
the first meeting of General Robert E. Lee
and General George B. McClellan as Gen
eral McClellan had related the fact 3to Mr.
Savage in the summer of 1878.
"It was near the City of Mexico during
the Mexican War," said Genera; McClel
ian to Mr. Savaee, "that I first met my
future great opposing I was
a lieutenant of engineers and Lee was a
major of engineers and a lavonte on
the staff of General Winfield Scott. I
was walking alone across a field one day
when I saw General Scott and his staff ap
proaching on horseback. As the party
drew near to me Major Lee reined up his
hoi>e and, addressing me in an angry
tone, said :
" 'Lieutenant, don't you know you are
disobeying orders? Wnat is your" name?'
"I told him my name was McClellan
and that I did not know I was disobeying
orders.
" 'All officers have been told to remain
in their quarters and await orders,' he ex
claimed, still appearing very augry.
"I replied that no such order had
reached mo, and he then peremptorily or
dered we back to my quarters and hastened
away lo join General Scott and the rest of
the staff, who had not stopped.
i returned across the field to my quar
ters, feeiing much injured, for I had not
knowingly committed any breach ot dis
cipline. I complained to my fellow offi
cers of Major Lee's treatment of me.
Scarcely had I finished my story when I
was told that there was an officer outside
wlio wished to see me, and I was greatly
surprised to find Major Lee seated there
upon his horse. He saluted me and I re
turned tne salute.â Baltimore Sun.

night believed he would recover. When â¢
he realized that he could not live, or that j
the chances were against his surviving, j
he sent for Lieutenant-Oovernor Jeter and j
dictated his will, by which he bequeathed j
all of his property to his wife and boyâ
the latter a baby 15 montls oid.
A post-mortem examination was made at
the request of Coroner Clark, that he might
decide whether an inquest was necessary.
The examination was made by Dr. Bai
ley and Dr. Morgan, assisted by Dr.
Hawkes of the ship Philadelphia
and Dr. Haslet of the Monadnock and Drs.
Keeney, Doyle and Clark. It was dis
covered that the pistol- ball had entered
just below the heart, as Crooks was in a
olightly stooping posture, and ranged
around the left side, cutting tbe sv>leen,
and passed out at the back. He had bled
internally, great clots of blood being lodged
in the body. Had he bled freely exter
nally death would have been hastened.
Dr. Clark, Coroner, was satistied that i
the shot occurred as Crooks said, and de- \
cided that the inque3t was not essential.
Mr. Crooks was very cheerlul, even this
morning, and talked as freely and in as
good voise up to his death as before the
accident occurred, and his signature to the
will was as plainly and strongly written as
though he were entirely well. When
Richard Thompson of the Wells-Fargo
Express Company this morning picked no
the ball, which no one had been able to
find before, and showed it to Mr. Crooks,
the injured man remarked:
"If that had struck the wall before it
got me I should not be in any danger."
He referred to the fact that the ball, in j
its upward course, glancing along the
wall, had bounded across the room with
out further damage.
Dr. Morfew and Walter Newton, broth
ers-in-law of deceased, and their wives,
with Matthews Crooks, his brother, came
down from San Francisco this morning. |
Mrs. Crooks, widow of the deceased, is j
quite ill from the smock and has been un- i
able to decide as to burial arrangements,
but it is believed the body will be taken to
Oakland for interment.
CAPE MENDOCINO DISASTER.
The Schooners Mary Buhne and Jennie
The/in Collideâ Both Are Badly
Damaged. â 
EUREKA, Cal., June 28.â While in the
vicinity of Cape Mendocino, the schooner
Mary Buhne, returning empty from a
southern trip, last night collided with the
Jennie Thelin, bound for San Francisco,
heavily loaded with lumber. The Thelin
was struck amidships and immediately
filled with water. The lumber prevented
it from sinking. Both vessels were badly
damaged. The Buhne's bow was injured,
and the Thelin's side caved in. The tug
Ranger towed them into port this after
noon.
The crew of the Buhne claim that no
side lights wero exposed to view on the
Thelin, and it was not seen until only a
few yards away.

NEWS OF MARE ISLAND,
Liberal Appropriations Permit of
a Large Increase in the
Force.
The Battle-Ship Oregon to Be at Once
Prepared for Active Ser
vice.
VALLEJO, Cal.. June 28.â Many me
chanics, helpers and laborers are awaiting
with anxiety the coming of the new fiscal
year, commencing on July 1, with the
hope that they will be called to resume
work, after long furloughs. The appro
priations for the coming year are more
liberal in some of the departments than
for years past noticeably in the depart
ment of yards and docks. This is due to
the appeals of the Chief of Bureau, Com
modore E. O. Mathews.
The appropriations were made for a
greater variety of purposes, including the
construction of buildings, roadways and
walks. One of the improvements to be
started is the building of a new caisson
and the enlargement of the dock entrance.
It is understood that plans for this work
have been submitted to the head of the
bureau, and if they are approved work will
soon be commenced.
All along the line in the various depart
ments at the navy-yard there will be
ample funds to keep a large force of men
employed the coming year, by adding to
the regular appropriations the amounts
allowed under the deficiency bill for the
repairing of some of the ships at the yard.
In the construction department cards
for employment of men, to the number of
over 200, have been sent out. This does
not, however, signify that the men will
obtain employment the year round.
Work is being pushed" on the gunboat
Bennington. The crew is living aboard
while in dock, and has but little to do, as
the repairs are in the hands of the yard
authorities.
Chief Engineer Kutz, having completed
his forty years' Â«wrvice in the navy, has
been placed on the retired list atid his
position as chief of the steam engineering
department is being filled by Chief En
gineer Joseph Trilley. Kx-Cbief Kutz and
family will reside either in Oakland or in
Alameda. Very little work is being per
formed in the department he has just
vacated, but after July there will be plenty
to do.
Now that the battle-ship Oregon has
been accepted by the Government it will
soon come up to the yard and be commis
sioned, stores put aboard, ammunition
stowed in the magazines and the hundred
and one odd jobs to be done to a ship
going in commission will keep the Oregon
at the yard some weets after the pennant
has been floating at the masthead.
A Fable.
A regal Boom, wearing its coronet and
robes, was taking the air in its orchard
and complacently meditating upon its
own prosperity. Into the sacred presence
entered a Veiled Prophet, who was in
stantly seized by the Bodyguard. Hand
ing his visiting-card to the Chief Myr
midon, the prophet awaited the result.
"Mokanna of Knorassan?" exclaimed
the Boom, " 'tis an Impostor. Away with
him and off with his head !"
"Pardon me," came from behind the
veil in deep, rich tones; "not Mokanna,
but Mark Hanna, and of Canton."
"The differences impress me less than
the ominous resemblances,'' groaned tin*
Boom; "besides, I 3m something of a
Veiled Propuet myself"â and, muttering
"hoodooed," it sanK upon the ground in
collapse.
The moral of this tale, being addressed
to aspiring Cabinet Secretaries only, is of
gen eral appl ication.

FOUND MANY READY TAKERS.
He Claimed Relationship to Chairman

Washington.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 28.â J. C.
Dolan of Portland, Or., whose swindling
operations were detailed in a recent issue
of The Call, numbers a Los Angeles man j
among bis victims. Dolan is now under
Indictment for forging Chinese certificates
on a big scale. An investi ation into tbe
former career of this unscrupulous but
exceedingly smooth scoundrel shows that !
he has been in the babit of swindling !
anxious office seekers out of large sums of J
money by promising to procure for them i
lucrative employment under the general \
Government. One of these is L. C. Tyler !
of 135 South Grand avenue, this city.
Tyler tells an interesting story recarding
his experience with the "Government
agent" at Portland.
"I was living at Portland in the fall of j
1893," said he, "and met Dolan, who was i
a fellow of good appearance. The United j
States Attorney had gone to Washington. |
Dolan was corresponding with him and ]
finally himself went to Washington. Dr.
Lyie did not send him. Dolan wrote back
to Dr. Lyle that he thought he could get <
him appointed Appraiser of the Port at !
Portland and he told the doctor to get up
his petition as soon as possible. He also
wrote to mo that lie could get me the posi- j
tion of Collector of Customs. Dr. Lyle
sent in the petition.
"Dolan claimed that W. F. Harrity, |
chairman of the Democratic National j
Committee, was nis cousin, and that j
through him he could get us appointed. ,
He said he had been promised a position |
for himself, and finally he telegraphed to â¢
Dr. Lyle that he had received it.
"A day or two later Dolan telegraphed i
asking for $1000 and saying that he would
have us both appointed at once. I sent \
him the money. Dr. Lyle supplied $666 j
and I gave the balance. Then as we heard j
nothing more we grew uneasy and Dr. |
Lyle went on to Washington, where he
soon found that Dolan was a swindler and
utterly unable to influence any appoint
ment. I saw Dolan when he returned to \
Portland, but could get no satisfaction j
from him. He was perfectly brazen, and j
when he had a mans money he would j
laugh at him."
Tyler said that Dr. Lyle had written to
him proposing that tuey prosecute Dolan, j
but he was not -willing to throw good j
money after bad. He does not expect to
attempt any prosecution now, and will
not go to Portland unless subpenaed as a
witness. Tyler describes Dolan as a
smooth, well-spoken fellow, of pleasant
appearance and always well dressed.
DUEL WITH A BURGLAR.
Officer Fi field Wounds a Criminal in a
Fifjht With Pistols.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jtine 28.â Officer
West Fifield fought with a burglar early
this morning, and after exchanging eight
shots at each other the prowler succeeded
in escaping, leaving a trail of blood.
The officer walked along Sixteenth street
at 4 o'clock this morning, and at the cor
ner of Hill street saw a man on the porch
of D. Healraes' house, trying to open the
screen door. Fifield called and the man
immediately turned and fired at him.
Without waiting to learn the effect of his
shot the burglar jumped from the porch
and ran throueh the yard toward Hill
street, pursued by the officer. The burglar
stopped behind a hedge and tired two
more shots at his pursuer. Neither took
effect.
Fifield is over six feet tall and weighs
300 pounds, but in spite of his weight he is
one of the fastest runners on the force.
When the second round whistled close to
him he stopped and returned the burglar's
fire. Fifield shot five times at t'e Hieing
man after he left the hedge, and one of the
bal's took effect, as a small trail of blood
was left by the burglar.
There was quite a heavy fog, which was
the cause of the men's poor aim.

FATE ENKIND TO HIM.
Failing to End His Life, a Would-Be
Suiddr Wrrcka His Fumiturr.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 28.â George
W. Floyd made a number of attempts to
commit suicide this afternoon, and when
he discovered that his revolver was use
less he picked up an ax and started to get
satisfaction by wrecking the furniture in
his room.
Floyd was employed as a hackdriver
and had been on a spree for the last few
days. To-day he got so drunk that his
employer discharged him. In settling
their accounts there was a dispute, and
the proprietor called Floyd a dirty thief
and robber. The latter denied the im
peachment with drunken persistency, but
finally decided that it might not have
been altogether erroneous. He went to
his room, took an old revolver and, plac
ing it to his head, pulled the trigger five
times. Four times the weapon missed
fire, but on the fifth attempt the cartridge
exploded and the ball grazed Floyd over
the left eye.
This made Floyd angry. He seized an
ax and began demolishing all the furni
ture in sight. So greai was his rage that
by the time assistance came be had
wrecked nearly everything in the room.
He was taken tc the Receiving Hospital
after a struggle. He will recover.

OLD BOATS AND COLLISIONS.
When the Crash Comes It Is Generally
the Better Ship That Goes Down.
"Did you ever notice," said an old
mariner, "that when a collision occurs on
the lakes, the better boat, in nine cases out
of ten, gets the worst of it, and generally
goeo to the bottom? On the other hand,
the old boat, for in a great many instances
it is an old boat, receives little damage, if
any.
"Take, for instance, the sinking of the
Lehigh Valley liner Cayuga, which oc
curred on the 10th of las>t May. ShÂ» col
lided with the steamer Joseph L. Hurd
and was sunk in Lake Michigan, near
Skillipalee Light. The Cayuiia was one of
the best steamers on the lakes snd worth
about $200,000. The Hurd was an old
lumber barge, which had been condemned,
once and then rebuilt, and worth almost
nothing.
"At the time of the collision there was
a heavy foe. Fog banks are peculiar
things to run up against and rattle many
a captain. This was the case with the
commander of the Hurd. The right sig- j
nals had apparently been given, but with \
hardly a minute's warning, the Hurd took j
a sheer and struck the Cayuga amidships.
The Cayuga went down in anout five min
utes, and the Hurd made for the land,
which was not very far off. where she was
beached. She was leaking quite badly.
Temporary repairs were made and she
was tuen towed to a drydoefc. She came
out again later in the season and ran in
the lumber trade in Lake Michiean. The
Cayuga, however, is still at the bottom,
lying in about 101 feet of water, and her
chances for remaining there are very good.
"Let me cite you another instance
where the better boat was sunk by an old
oneâ well. I won't say she was old, for she
had not been in commission very lone.
She wan called the Jack. Her first feat
that brought her before public notice was
when she collided with one of the locks
in the Welland canal. Navigation
was delayed for several days by
the accident The next prominent
feat that she accomplished was to
sink the big steel steamer Norman,
which was owned by the Menominee
Steamship Company. She sunk her in
the middle of Lake Huron, and in deep
water. In fact, it has been a mystery
where she did go down, for they have
never been able to locate her. She was
worth about $200,000. The Jack sustained
little damage and was soon in commission
again. Now, there are two boats which
were worth about $400,000, and both were
sunk by boats which could be bought for
$20,000, and that would be a big price for
them."â Buffalo Express.

GTLROY, Cal.. June 28.â The Hollister
freight and passenger train which leaves
Gilroy at 6:45 r. m. collided with a special
engine at Carnadero junciion, three miles
south of Gilroy, last evening. The Hol
lister train had slowed down to turn the
switch, when the special came flying
around the curve, and before the lever
could be reversed the trains had collided.
The engineers and firemen, seeing the ap
proaching danger, jumped in time to save
their lives.
Tne special plunged its way into the
front of the Hollister engine, and the con
cussion derailed three flatcars, splitting
them in the center. About fifteen cars in
the rear were the passenger coaches. The
jolt threw the seveu occupants forward,
but luckily they all escaped unhurt.
Engineer Chase was on the special's lo
comotive and the fireman was J. Hartley.
James Lynch, engineer, and M. Rockefel
ler, fireman, with George Clarke, con
ductor, had charge of the Hollister train.
Hartley's ankle was sprained in leaping
from the cab.
The passencecg came to town in coaches
and the section men, under Georee Skilli
corn's orders, cleared the track of the
wreckage. The wrecking crew came from
San Francisco at 3 a. m. and brought the
disabled engines and cars to town.
The engineer of the special was a new
hand and unacquainted with, the road,
and was unaware that the regular Hol
lister train had not passed the junction.
Had there been no freight cars between
the passenger coaches and the engine the
few passengers would iiave been killed.
The engines are badly disabled and will be
sent to the Sacramento yards for repairs.
The regular trains run on time to-day.

BEAUTIFUL NEW
WESTMINSTER,
Third Largest City in the
Province of British
Columbia.
ITS TRADE FACILITIES.
Terminus of Two Great Railways
and Fraser River Nav
igation.
ITS CLIMATE IS UNSURPASSED.
Handsome Buildings, Electric-Car Ser
vice, Busy Sawmills, Foundries
and Factories.
NEW WESTMINSTER, B. C, June
25.â The third largest, city in British
Columbia in point of population is New
Westminster, known as the "Royal City"
because it was christened by the Queen of
Great Britain. This city is situated on
the north bank of the Fraser River, six
teen miles from the Straits of Georgia, and
being on the river bank which rises gradu
ally to a height of 400 feet, it presents a
splendid view from the river. There is
probably no other city on the coast that
can be seen to such advantage either by
day or by night. Its really fine business
bloc.s down near the water front, the
beautiful public buildings and the elegant
private residences among the bright
foliage of numerous ornamental trees and
shrubbery all over the hillside, present a
picture that will long be remembered by
all who have the good fortune to see it.
The citizens claim that it is the best
lighted city on the coast (San Francisco
not excepted), and when the electric lights
are lighted on a dark night the spectacle
presented to one on the river in front or
on the south shore is simply magnificent.
The site was selected by Colonel Moody
of the Royal Engineers in 1358. The hill
on which the city now stands was then
covered by a magnificent forest of Douglas
fir and cedar. Trees measuring 30 feet in
circumference and from 150 to 200 feet in
height were then not uncommon â but no
such trees are now to be found in the
vicinity. At one time, and for several
years, New Westminster was the capital of
British Columbia. Its growth at first was
quite rapid, but when the capital had been
removed to Victoria a period of compara
tive inactivity ensued which continued up
to the time of the opening of the Canadian
Pacific Railway. This event marks an im
portant epoch, not only in the history of
New Westminster but tbat of the whole of
British Columbia. It produced a veritable
boom the effects of which were felt
throughout the whole province.
The Fraser River is navigable up as lar
as New Westminster for vessels drawing
about twenty-one feet of water. Above
the city it is navigable for small steamers
of light draft about 100 miles. It is thus
the natural point of transhipment for al
freight and passengers to and from the
Fraser Valley. Steamers run three times
a week between this city and Victoria,
Vancouver and Nanaimo. There is a daily
t-teamer between New Westminster and
the mouth of the river, and a da; y
steam service up as far as Chilliwhack. It
.s the fresh-water terminus of the Cana
l
VIEW OF A PORTION OF NEW WESTMINSTER, B. C.
dian Pacific Railway and the western
terminus of the Great Northern. It is
connected with Vancouver by an electric
tram railway giving an hourly service.
The facilities of the city for trade are,
therefore, unsurpassed by those of any
other city in the province, as it is easily
reached by railway, steamer or wagon
road from all parts of the district and is in
perfect touch with the commercial centers
of the world.
The city possesses a considerable num
ber of very fine business blocks. The Du
pont block, 89x132 feet, four stories, cost
$75,000; the Douglas-Elliott block, 66x132,
four stories, $70,000: the Guichon Hotel
block, 66x132, three stories, $65,000. These
blocks are all solidly built oi brick and
stone. There are a considerable number
of other brick blocks of large proportions,
among which are the Colonial Hotel,
Queen's Hotel, Begbie block, Duncan-Mc-
Call block, Curtis-Burns block, Masonic-
Odd Fellows' block and others. Here are
alfo situated the provincial penitentiary,
the provincial asylum, the central prison
and the county courthouse. These are all
large brick buiidingte. The asylum cost
over $150,000 and the penitentiary $140,000.
There ie a free public library building
erected and owned by the corporation,
costing $24,000. There are two excellent
hospitals, two colleges, and first-class pub
lic and high school. The Y. M. C. A. has
a fine brick building and an excellent
gymnasium. AH the leading denomina
tions have one or more churches, and
there are a large number of secret societies.
The corporation has installed a first
class electric-light system, from which it
supplies light both for the streets and for
private use. This plant cost $116,000, and
the revenue derived from it (allowing 35
cents per light per night for tiie street
iamps) more than covers the cost of main
tenance, including interest and sinking
fund on the capital. The corporation has
also constructed a tirst-class water works
system. Water is brought from Coquitlam
Lake, a distance of over twelve miles, by a
steel main, to a reservoir on the top of tne
hill, whence it goes into the distribution
pipes. The lake is fed by mountain
streams of purest water. It is about 435
feet above sea level, and the reservoir is
400 feet. This gives ample pressure for
fire protection and all other purposes.
These works cost $450,000. In Quinn's
Park the corporation has erected a tine ex
hibition bui ding where an exhibition is
held every year.
Nff Westminster possesses three saw
miils, a foundry, several sash and door
factories, ice factory and cold storage, and
other industries. It has the best farmers '
1 market in British Columbia, and is the
i principal shipping point for fruit. It is
within easy reach of the preat fish-canning
establishments of Fraser River, the most
remote being only about twelve miles dis
taEt. With such a situation, and having
such unequaled facilities for shipment by
land ana water, it is a most favorable point
for manufactories.
The city, generally, is healthy and clean,
and the climate is unsurpassed anywhere
in Canada. It is, therefore, a desirable
place for residence. It possesses all, or
nearly all, the appliances and advantages
of a well-equipped modern city, such as
electric light, pure water, electric street
cars, telephone connection with ail the
surrounding country as far as Portland,
Or., telegraph connection everywhere,
daily mails, daily newspaper, railway and
steamship connection to every civilized
country on the earth. That the destiny of
the city is great no one acquainted with
i its position, resources and trade facilities
can doubt, and capital and enterprise will
j some day make it one of the chief cities of
the Pacific Coast.

HYPNOTISM USED IN COURT.
Verdict of a Jury Rendered Under Pe
cnliar Circumstances.
"Hypnotism," remarked the professor
to a Star reporter, "is a most peculiar
power. A dozen years ago, when hypno
tism bad not been Triibyed into its pres
ent fame, I was one of twelve jurymen in
a murder trial. It was an intelligent jury,
too â "
"Of course," laughed the reporter,
"otherwise you would not have been
there."
â¢'That's all right," smiled the professor,
"but our intelligence was of no great
value to us. The case was one of murder,
in which the murderer gained a fortune
by getting an heir out of the way and
taking his ulace. The trial did not take
place until two years after the death of the
victim, and the evidence was very nearly
circumstantial, but it was a remarkably
clear case of circumstances. Well, there
wasn't anything peculiar or interesting
that wouldn't nave happened at any mur
der trial, but tiie prisoner was extraor
dinary, at least, as to his eyes, which were
of the piercing kind one reads of in stories
to chill the blood.
"He did not us^e them, however, to any
! extent until all the evidence was in and
t lie attorneys began their talk. Then he
turned them upon the jury and fastened
them there, as if pleading with us to save
! him. All the arguments were in by 6
: o'clock the tir>t day and the Judge began
to charge the jury. All the soul of the
j prisoner seemed, then, to be in his eyes,
| and I could not get mv mind on anything
but the prisoner. What the Judge was
| saying seemed to be a far-off whisper,
; vague and indistinct. Whether the other
| jurymen were affected as I was I did not
, Know, because I hardly realized that there
was any one on the jury except myself
and that the prisoner was looking at me
â  for help.
'I had an indistinct idea that he was
unworthy to be saved, bnt in spite of my
selr I could not bring myself to condemn
; mm. Then the jury was sent out, tne
eyes of Ihe prisoner following until the
door was between us. I was the foreman
and as soon as we had entered the room
and sat down I said, 'Gentlemen, the
prisoner is not guilty.' My statement was
assented to without a dissenting voice ana
in live minutes' time we were in the box
again and ten minutes' later the prisoner
was profusely thanking us for a verdict in
bis favor.
"Then he left the courtroom quickly
and the jury was discharged. We walked
out as if we were dazed, the most peculiar
and uncomfortable feeling I ever exDe
nenced, and I went to bed that night feel
ing as if I were smothering. Next morn
ing I was all right again, and I made it a
point to question mv fellow-jurymen. In
each case I discovered an experience simi
lar to mine, but we hardly dared to say
we had been hypnotized. That winter a
traveling hypnotist came to town, and
that jury put iiself in his hands at a pri
vate seance, and every man on it was what
is called a 'sensitive.' That settled the
business. The prisoner had hypnotized
the jury and had received a verdict as he
wanted it, but it was not to be retracted,
and the verdict stood."â Washington Star.
Slabbed in the Arm.
Durinjj a row at 1119 a Kearny street last
night Sublno Esta bar was stabbed in the left
arm by Longi Riveles. The latter was arrested
for an assault to commit murder. The knife
blade severed an artery and Estabar lost con
siderable blood.
The trouble seems to have grown out of the
arrest of Thomas Delgardo, who was locked up
for robbery at the instance of Estabar. The
latter said that Deljrardo robbed him of a

Countri s.
SALEM, Or., June 28.â Yamhill and
Ltine counties lay claim to the distinction
oi first giving birth in the Northwest to
the new political movement known as the
Union Bimetallic party, which, without
State organization, elected three represen
tatives to the Legislature and carried Yam
hill County in the recent election. The
Union Bimetallists have issued a call for a
State convention at McMinnville on July
I 9, and will follow up the victory already
achieved by State organization. The con
vention will seat 300 delegates, and it is
creating no little stir among the wiseacres
of other faiths, notwithstanding the ex
istence of this party has been resolutely
ignored.
In almost every county in the State lead
ers of the new party are causing meetinga
j to be held at which delegates to the con
j vention are beiug elected. Chairman
John C. Young of the People's party State
Central Committee will be a delegate. Gov.
i Lord has been requested to preside at
j the opening, but he has pleaded other en
gagements.
The leading spirit of the movement is
Colonel J. C. Cooper of McMinnville, who
framed the platform and who is chairman
of the convention. The convention will
be composed of men who favor a platform
of goid and silver as standard money, are
| opposed to a single gold standard and fa-
I vor the free and unlimited coinage of
both. The platform of the bimetallists, to
which silver Democrats and silver Repub
licans, Populists and middle-of-the-road
Independents are subscribinc, declares for
! a tariff for revenue sufficient to meet na
! tional expenses, with protection to Ameri
! can labor and its products, the use of both
I gold and silver as standard money and not
| a gold standard alone, a discriminating
j tariff against gold countries, no more
j bonds, postal savings banks, the election
j of United States Senators by direct vote of
j th,e people, restriction of all un-American
' immigration, the cutting down of all legis
lative appropriations and extra salaries
and the reduction of State, county and
municipalc ipal expenses.

LOVELY BICYCLE COSTUMES.
The Effect of a White Outfit on a Warm
and Sunny Morning.
And speaking of white stockings re
minds me that some foolhardy soul i 3 en
deavoring to revive their memory in the
world of fashion. White silK stockings
and dainty black satin slippers, sparkling
with jeweled embroideries, are now indeed
considered the derniÂ»r cri. No matter
how lacy the hosiery be, however, or how
perfect the slipper tnu' inoloses it, the
white stocking can never be an a Iniirable

covering for the foot of beauty. They are
seen frequently (and rather more of them
than is perhaps intended by their wearers)
in Hyde Park, where the bicyclists most
do congregate.
Wheel-women wear them entirely en
suite â white hat, white gown, white stock
ings and white shoes â and the effect on a
warm and sunny morning is decidedly
pretty. Yesterday morning I saw Lady
Sophie Cadogan, the daughter of the Vice
roy of Ireland, wheeling with her fiancee,
Sir Samuel Scott, in the direction of the
Serpentine. Lady Sophie, who is tall,
slim and graceful, was wearing a perfectly
cut frock of pure white silky alpaca, the
coat bodice buttoning with large ivory
diÂ«ks over a white siik shirt, with stiff
collar and a pale blue tie. The hÂ»t, of
white Panama straw, was trimmed with
rosettes of tulle and a cluster of corn flow
ers, and the capitally hung skirt fell over
neat-ribbed white silk stockings and wnite
doeskin shoes.
White gloves and the sparkling nickel
of a remarkably smart wheel made the
whole effect charming. Miss Muriel Wil
son is another lovely girl who goes in for
absolute accord in her bicycling costume,
and she frequently affects Mephistophe
lean scarlet, from her small toque to the
tip of her morocco shoes. Miss Wilson is
a very splendid brunette and can stand
the rather startling attire admirably.
Very charming also is a dove-gray bicy
cling dress that I notice frequently in the
park. As in the other two instances,
everything matches, from the hat to the
tip of the gray suede shoes. â London Cor

A THRIFTY COMMUNITY.
The Success of the Mennonite Colony
Established in Manitoba in 1874.
The following statement regarding the
success of the Mennonite Co-operative
Colony in Manitoba has been, attested by
Mr. Hespeier, German Consul at Winni
peg: The 180 families who settled <in
Manitoba in 1874 have increased by immi
gration and natural increase to 2900 fami
lies, numbering 20,000 souls. They have
235,160 acres under cultivation.
Last year they harvested 3500 bushels of
grain, exclusive of flax. Of flax they
raised 950,000 bushels. They own 11,000
horses. 8300 cows and 10,000 young cat
tle. In 1874-75-76 they borrowed $195,
-000 from the Dominion Government, at
5 per cent interest, and from their
brethren at Waterloo, Ontario, $20,000 witn
out interest. In 1891 they had repaid the
whole amount of these bonds with interest,
and they are now quite free from debt,
and prosperous in every respect. Some of
the Mennonites thought to better their
condition by going to Washington, Ore
gon and South Dakota. > Most of them had
returned from the far West, and all had
come back from South Dakota, pleased to
be in Manitoba once more. The Men
nonites settlement is on the Pern bin a, a
branch of the Canadian Pacific .Railway
in Northern Manitoba.
The creed of these peculiar people for
bids them to carry arms. They were
originally expelled from â¢ Germany by
Frederic* VIII, and settled in Russia,
where the Empress Catherine granted
them exemption from military service for
105 years. Finding there was little prob
ability of a further exemption they emi
grated to Canada, where the Government
granted them a fertile tract of land and
freedom from military service forever.

A DAY AMONG
THE RIFLEMEN,
Hundreds of Marksmen
Compete for Prizes at
Shell Mound.
A MAN FROM STOCKTON.
D. Galbraith Shows That He .Is
Not a Novice With" a
Revolver.
THE GERMAN SHARPSHOOTERS.
Lively Competition for Bullseye Purses
and Class Medals â Military
Shots.
There was a very large attendance at the
Shell Mound rifle range yesterday, every
target being in use all day. The riarks
men had a number oi difficulties to con-
tend with. The light was very poor, vary
ing from a bright glare to a deceptive
shade, while the wind cut all manner of
capers along the range. For all that a
number of good scores were worked in be
tween times, which encouraged the shoot
ers to greater efforts.
The regular shoot of the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club was not as largely attended
as upon the days when the club's class
medals are at stake. However, there were
enough present to make the sport interest
ing, as many were there who simply
wanted to practice.
There was considerable work done on
the pistol range, which will tell later in
the more important events. J. E. Gorman.
C. M. Daiss and A. H. _*ape were well to
the front on the Blanding pistol medal
scores, and before the year is over the
rivalry promises to be even more keen
than at present. Gorman yesterday got
four flaizs in his scores, which will insure
him a goodly slice in the cash prizes.
D. Galbraith of Stockton was a guest of
the club and he had with him his44-cali
ber revolver, his performances with the
weapon showed that t c Stocktonian was
not a novice in pistol shooting. With the
small target firearms used by the club Mr.
Galbraith won for himself much praise.
Following were the scores made on the
pistol range, Columbia target:
Pistol, Blanding medal, three shotsâ Open to
all cnmers: J. E. Gorman 8, 0, 10, 10; CM.
Daiss 8.10,11; F. O. Young 15, 18; D. Gal-
Drnithlti; K. Jacobson 19.
Pocket revolver, Carr medal, 5 shotsâ M. J.
White 34, 39,29.
W. Glinderroann astonished himself and
friends late in the afternoon by getting
two flaps, showing that he hit the one inch
center on the Columbia target. A. H.
Pape did some fair work with the musket.
The scores werÂ« as follows:
Pimond medalâ W. Glindeman 9.
Target rifleâ Unfred medalâ F. O. Young 10,
H. H. Burfiend27.
Military rifle, Giindeman medal âA. H.

134.
Most flagsâ D. YV. McLaughlln 2, A. H. Pape
1, F. O. Young 1, W. Giindeman 2.
Two of the German snapshooting clubs
held their bullseye shoot, and in each
hundreds of tickets were soid. After the
targets were down for the day the scorers
were kept busy for a long time with the
measuring machines to determine the
winners of the cash prizes. The prize
winners and their points are annexed.

LOOKING FOR
ANOTHER WITNESS,
Attorneys for the Fair
Children Following a
Forlorn Hope.
MARRIAGE CONTRACT.
Mrs. Craven-Fair Causes the Op
posing Counsel Great Mental
Distress.
STORY CF THREE WITNESSES.
Two Women and a Man Who Think
They Can Throw Some Light on
the Pencil Will.
Mrs. Nettie Craven - Fair is not tne
least disturbed over the alleged discovery
of three witnesses who will swear that on
September 24, 1894, the date of the now
famous pencil will, James G. Fair was se
riously ill in his apartments at the Lick
-louse.
The chief surprise of the widow is that
these witnesses did not n umber six, nine
or twelve, instead of three, all of whom are
from one family. William Elliott, wtfe
and daughter are the persons referred to,
and the story that the two Jast named tell
is one so extremely questionable as to find
credence only in the minds of the attor
neys for the fair children.
Elliott is a bartender in Castro's Mont
gomery-street saloon. About tne time of
the writing of the pencil will, so Mrs. El
liutt says, a frend of hers died, leaving
two children. The bartender endeavored
to get passes for the orphans to Los An
geles, but the Southern Pacific could not
see it that way, suggesting that an appeal
be made to some wealthy or charitable
person.
Mrs. Elliott, accompanied by her daugh
ter, accordingly called on Senator Fair at
the Lick House, but he was. so she says,
too ill to see any one. The valet told
them this, and he, according to this story,
volunteered the additional information
that for three days the millionaire bad
been too sick to see any one but his physi
cian. It was during this interesting inter
change of words between Mrs. Elliott and
Fair's servant that the daughter inno
cently ambled over to a pair of heavy
portieres and is stated to have heard
what Heggerty and Knight now believe
will assist them materially in getting at
the true facts of the case. From beyond
the heavy coverings came the sound of
voices â a man and woman in earnest con
versation. Distinctly, according to this
remarkable statement, she heard a woman
say, "If we could only get him to sign it."
At least such is the story told by Miss
Elliott and her mother. The young
woman, after hearing the tell-tale words,
discreetly withdrew to the side of her
mother, and then the couple left the room.
Fair's secretary, however, gave a sufficient
sum of money to enable the bartender's
wife to send the two children to Los An
geles. In any event Mrs. Elliott wrote to
the aunt of the orphans informing her of
their departure. When Mrs. Craven-Fair
produced the pencil will Mrs. Elliott pro
fessd to remember that the case of the two
orphans came up about that time. She
wrote for the letter above referred to and
was fortunate enough to have it returned.
The date is SeptemDer 25, 1894, or the day
following her call at the L<ick House.
All this, however, gives Mrs. Craven-
Fair no uneasiness. She is confident of
her position, and declares it was nothing
more than was to be expected.
"We have heard of all this," said pretty
Miss Margaret Craven yesterday, "and I
assure you that mother is not the least dis
turbed over it. Mother's attorneys have
instructed her not to talk for publication
at present, though you can say that this
latest story is without fo undation in fact."
While the attorneys for the Fair heirs
are busy looking after their own fences
they are not forgetting those built by Mrs.
Craven -Fair. That lady stated in open
court that there was possibly one person
who knew that she was Fair's wtfe.
Knight and Heggerty have been assidu
ously endeavoring to find this person.
Her name, it appears, is Mrs. Rhind of
Jones street, but so far the attorneys have
signally failed in their efforts to draw her
out. She declared yesterday that she bad
absolutely nothing to tell except that a
sister of hers had occupied the upper flat
of the Sutter-street house where the con
tract marriage between Mrs. Craven and
Senator Fair was signed.
Mrs. Rhind failed to tell where this
sister could be found, though she was oon
fident that no information could be gained
in that quarter. In any event the counsel
opposing Mrs. Craven-Fair have so far
failed to refute any of the testimony
given by the widow before Judge Slack.FOREIGN FLAGS
AND THE FOURTH,
The Text of Rev. Dr. Case's
Prelude to His
Sermon.
TALKS OF IMMIGRATION.
A Word for the Class of For
eigners Who Came to This
Country in the Past.
THE RATIO OF POPULATION.
America for Americans and Only
" Old G ory " !o Be Floated in
This Country.
In the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church yesterday Rev. Dr. Case gave as a
pre ude to his sermon "Foreign Flags and
the Fourth of July." He said:
ihe total foreign-born population of our
untry is now not less than 12,000,000,
nearly a fifth of our total population. Count
ing their children to-day our country contains
-LOOO.OOO of foreign birth and parentage,
arW in our great cities, like Chicago and San
Francisco, four persons out of five are of for
eign birth or parentage.
We have twice as many Irishmen in America
as they have in all Ireland, and we shall soon
have to emigrate to Ireland if we would escape
Irish rule. We have one Norwegian for every
three in Norway, one Swede for every five in
Sweden and a Dane for every eight in Den
mark.
Cp to twenty years ago the best of the world
came to us by immigrationâ not as now, the
aged and decrepit, the paupers, anarchists and
criminals. To the lmuiijrr&nts who came pre
vious to 1870 we owe much of our greatness
an a nation. They felled our forests, built our
cities, enlarged our commerce, made our rivers
navigable, dug our c-annl.i, built our railroads.
If no Welsh or Cornish had come, who would
have unlocked the stone doors in Pennsylvania
and brought forth the black diamonds? If no
Irish had come, who would have built our rail
roads and docksâ and for that matter recruited
our police force and run our city govern
ment? If no Germans or Swedes had come,
who would have sealed the great Northwest
and driven the piow through the virgin soil of
our prairies?
Washington -aid: "Would we were rid oi
aii the ioreigners save La Fayette," and Jeffer
son wished the Atlantic were a sea of flame;
but if there had been no immigration alter
independence was secured, we might have
been a" very select Nation, but we cer
tainly should not have been a very great
oue. We must not forget that the Huguenots
who settled the South, the Dut^a who settled
New York and the Puritans who settled New
Kugland were all immigrants. Nor must we
forget that during the laic war thousands of
men of foreign birth freely left their adopted
homes and volunteered in our armies, and
were the peers of native-born citizens in hero
ism and loyalty. English, Irish, Scotch and Ger
man blood ininjrled on a hundred battle-fields;
men from the Tweed, the Thames, the Shan
non and the Rhine marched in our armies,
stood their ground in the fiery front of battle,
and shoutedâ many of them in broken Eng
lishâ ihe watchwords of. the Union. One-fourilx
of the Union Army wa> composed of foreigners,
and that iact ought to rebuke any narrow
Americanism.
I bear hearty tribute to the excellent char
acter of many of our foreign-born fellow
citizens; many of them are in iiearty sym
pathy with American institutions and are
better Americans than some men born on
American Â»oii. They were, not born in
America, but America was born in them. But
the character of our iinir.igratlon has changed
in the last twenty years. Look, for example,
at our immigrants from Italy. Formerly they
were from Lombardy and Piedmontâ grand
men of a grand race. But now we have the
lazzaroni of Naples and the banditti of Sicilyâ
peanut-venders, organ-grinders, tamale-ped
dlers or stiit-Uo-flouriiihers and Mafia mur
derersâand the worst of it is that oue ol our
High School boys, whose father died fighting
for his country, as he walks up to the polls to
cast his maiden vote has that vote neutralized
by one of these fellows, who could not tell the
constitution of the United States from a cigar
store sign. Look at the pursuits of many of
the foreign element in this country. Late
prison statistics show that 75 per cent of the
Irish convicts find their way hereâ and oue
can well believe it from the number of political
, ward-heelers, saloon-keepers and pug
prize-fighters which ihat nationality fur
nishes. In New England in 1870 the foreign
born element furnished 20 per cent of the
population, aud that element furnished 75 i
percent of the crime. That is, it was twelve
times as much disposed to crime as the native
stock.
Kully 90 per cent of the saloon-keepers of
this city are of foreign birth or parentage.
Aud this gives us a glimpse at the political as
pects of immigration. It is immigiation which
sustains the liquor power; and there is a
whisky vote. Immigration is the strength of |
the Roman Catholic Church and there is a |
very compact Catholic vote. Immigration is !
the mother and nurse of anarchism; and there
is an anarohisr.e vote. Immigration tends
strongly to our cities and gives them their po
litical complexion. And there is no more se
rious menace to our civilization than our rab
ole and boss ruled and saloon-cursed cities. I
have stood at Castle Garden aud have seen the
great ocean steamers come in past the Goddess
oi Liberty, aud when they had discharged
their load" hat tury Park was black with those
creatures with the thirty-seven distinct smells
of the immigrant steerage still upon them.
Most of them were paupers bringing noth
ing with them, as Mrs. Partiugton says, "'but a
sarcophagus and an elementary canai." And I
said what a pity the American people should
mingle this brutal and decadent strain with
its fresh and vigorous blood.
We must do three things: 1. Check foreign
immigration. 2. Require a longer residence
and a higher intelligence qualification of for
eigners before admitting them to citizenship.
We must not cast our pearls before swine nor
give our children's brrad ;o dogs. 3. We must
insist that these adopted fellow citizens shall
be Americansâ not hyphenated Americansâ
not Irish-Americans, l.or German-Americans,
nor Italian-Americans, but plain Americans.
When the Irishman comes 'here we want him
to leave his hyphen and his shillelagh behind
him! The man who comes here to wÂ«ge a
political campaign on European issues, to
bring over here tne animosities and the strifes
<;f Europe, is an enemy to our institutions and
a traitor to tne flag that shelters him. Neither
the orange nor the green has any business in
Americaâ a plague on both your housesâ red,
white and blue have got to be your colors here,
gentlemen! There is only room for one lan
guage to be taught in our public schools, and
that is the English, und there Is only room for
one flag in our sky, just as there is room for
only one God in heaven.
A few years ago, in spite of the veto of Mayor
Hewitt, a true Araerieau, old glory was pulled
down from the New York City Hall on the 17th
of Ireland and the green rag hoisted in its
place. That can never occur again in New
York, for there was such an outburst of indig
nation that the Legislature passed and Gov
ernor Flower promptly signed a law forbidding
the hoisting of any foreign flag over any pub- j
â ie building, except foreign consulates, in the
Empire State.
We are going; to have a law in this country
before long that old glory must lead every
procession in this land or that procession does
not march, und it shall be the only flag borue
through our streets on Independence day.
But whence comes this insolent demand for
(he flaunting of a foreign flag on a day that
is sacred to American memories? It only
comes irom one quarter. There is no clamor
lrom Germans, or English, or French, to carry
their honored banners, that for a thousand
years have braved the battle and the breeze,
:n an American Fourth of Juiy procession.
A.nd there is no demand that the green flag
siiftll share the glory that day with the stars
and stripes from our fellow citizens of Irish
birth, with one significant exception, and it
ill beL-omes the priests of Koine to clamor for
the green flag in America, for it is the badge of
their infamy.
It is not the fault of the Irish people that
their flag alone oi all the banners of the na
tions means nothing at home or abroad, on
oca or shore. It is the work of the Komish
hierarchy, which breathes on nothing it does
not blight, and controls nothing it does not
curse, and which never extended a helping
hand to a prostrate people, that unhappy Ire
hind is a mendicant at the world's gates to
rtuy her soldiers iv every array except her
own, her flag of the harp and shamrock every
where except on her own soil.
I would proscribe no man on account of his
rt-.ce or his religion. Ift el like the old lady
who, when she saw a surpiiced boy choir for
the first time and was asked bow she liked
them, "Well," said she, "I don't like the way
they wear their shirts, but if their hearts are
right I am satisfied.*
No religious test, brethren, in America!
If anything is un-American proscribing a
man because of his religion is un-American.
If this republic stands for anything it stands
for liberty of conscience, and I would defend
that of my Catholic fellow-citizen as I would
my own with my last dropof blood. Religious
freedom! Roger Williams, the Protestant, and
Lord Baltimore, the Catholic, shook hands on
that.
1 can never be a bigot in religion, but I am a
bigot about the flag. That bigotry was worn
into some of us by long marches and worried
into us by much drilling; it was chilled into
us by lonely picket duty and soaked into us by
lying in the trenches and sleeping iv the mud;
it was filtered into us by the dews of night and
drizzled into us by the rains of heaven ; it was
starved into us on half a hard tack a day; it
was trampled into us by iron hoofs and
crushed into us by artillery wheels; it was
blown into us by shot and shell and thrust into
us by bayonet and suber.
Ana so we say that the old flag is good
enough for us, and if it is not pood enough for
Father Yorke I'll engage to raise a handsome
subscription to ship him and all likeminded
with him back to Ireland!

DE LA RICH GOING HOME
j Spanish Minister to Japan Re
lieved and on His Way
to Madrid.
Honored by the Empror of Japan.
"Our Attitude In Cu^a Is Our
Historical Duty."
Don Jose de la Rica y Calvo, Envoy
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipoten
tiary to Japan, who arrived on the Gaelic
Saturday night on his way to Spain, left
here yesterday afternoon for New York.
Mr. de la Rica, for such is his name â
Calvo being, according to the ancient
Spanish custom, simply the complimentary
adaition of his mother's family name â has
been relieved at his own request from duty
in Japan in order that be might take some
other Government position, where his
wife and daughter, now in Madrid, might
be with him.
"I have been in Japan two terms," said
he yesterday in his apartments at the
Palace, "first as secretary to the legation
and during the last year as Minister.
"Last August, a month after my arrival
in Japan, 1 signed the treaty entered into
by Japan and Spain in regard to the Isl
and of Formosa. Both countries were
very much interested in that island after
the war. The relations between Japan
and Spain are most friendly. As an indi
cation of that feeling the Emperor of
Japan conferred upon me shortly before
my departure the Grand Cross of the Ris
ing Sun, a token that has been given to
some otiier Ministers Plenipotentiary be
fore .me.
"My successor in Japan is Don Luis la
Barara, formerly Minister to Brazil. I
was stationed at Montevideo, South Amer
ica, three years myself before I accepted
the mission to Japan.
"I am now at the disposal of my Gov
ernment. Where I may be sent Ido not
know, but I asked for a place where my
family could be with me.
"Cuoan relations," remarked the Minis
ter in response to a query, "I fcnow little
about, as I have heard nothing for over
forty days. Our attitude in Cuba is our
historical duty. We received that island
from our ancestors; it came to us by the
discovery of Columbus. To defend and to
preserve it is to guard a tradition and a
heritage. That is the opinion of every
true Spaniard.
"I think at the bottom many Ameri
cans are of the same opinion as the Span
iards. I have sounded a great many
Americans in Japan, officers on your war
ships and others.
"It is a war of races in Cuba. The ma
jority of the insurgents are negroes, with
out morality or breeding."

HER SKILLFUL EVASION.
How a Captivating Parisian Actress
Escaped Tentifying to Her Age.
A servant robbed Mile. Mars of her dia
monds one evening while she was at the
theater. Arrested, he was put upon trial
and witnesses were summoned to hear tes
timony of his guilt. Among these was
Mile. Mars. She was greatly annoyed at
this, as according to the rules of French
practice the witness after being sworn
gives his age.
Now, the age of Mile. Mars was an im
penetrable mystery. The day of the trial
came, and she was put in t'ue witness-box,
every ear was Dent toward her to catch
the age she would give as her own.
"Your name?" said the presiding Judge.
"Anne Francoise Hippolyte Mars."
"What is your profession ?"
"An actress of the French Comedy."
"What is your age?"
"Umpty years."
"What?" inquired the presiding Judge,
leaning forward.
"I have just told your Honor," replied
the actress, giving one of those irreMsti
ble smiles which won the most hostile
pit.
The Judge smiled in turn, and when lie
asked, as he did immediately, "Where do
you live?" applause long prevented Mile.
Mars from replying.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1896.
ENDEAVORERS GO
EAST TO WORK,
Professor Wiles and Dr.
Rader Busy in Wash
ington.
FOR THE '97 CONVENTION
Would Brin? About 25,000 Young
People to San Fran
cisco.
A FUND OF $25,000 NEEDED.
State Delegation to Washington, D. C ,
Will Number About 1500âSub
scriptions Received.
The California Christian Endeavorers
are going to make a strong effort to secure
the 1897 international convention of that
society for San Francisco.
Tbe convention this year meets In Wash
ington, D. C, and will open July 14. It is
Professor James A. Wiles, President of the Golden Gate Union. Who Has Gone
last to Secure the Endeavorers' Convention for 1397.
[From a photograph by BushnelL]
anticipated that 60,000 delegates will at
tend the convention. California's delega
tion will approximate 1500.
If San Francisco is chosen as the place
for the next convention it will mean that
from 25,000 to 30,000 young people will
come here, and after t c convention
doubtless visit other places in California.
Boston had 54,000 delegates, and leading
Endeavorers of this City claim that 25,000
is a conservative estimate of the number
that would come here.
Professor James A. Niles, president of
the Golden Gate Union, is now in the East,
and he will be one of the California dele
gation at Washington.
Rev. Dr. Kader has also gone East for
the same purpose, to be early on the
ground arid talk California from the start.
Great enthusiasm prevails among the
| Endeavorers as the time for choosing the
'97 convention approaches. They say that
if the people of the State will do their
I part in the effort that the ' 97 convention
| will come here. The Endeavorers want to
j raise a fund oi $25,000 to help bring the
convention here. To assist in accomplish
ing this, a reproduction of the tabernacle
of Israel and the heavenly sanctuary, to
beiollowed by a lecture, may be seen in
Calvary Presbyterian Church at Geary
and Powell streets to-morrow evening.
The tabernicle is seven feet in length
and is a complete reproduction in gold, sil
ver and tine linen of the original tabernacle
constructed by Moses. It cost $15,000 and
six years' study and labor by J. W. Kelch-
I ncr who will lecture about it. A very
large picture showing Mount Sinai and
the children of Israel in their encamp
ment forms a background for the taber
nacle. The admission will be 25 cents.
Home of the vessels of gold and silver and
some of tbe rugs were made in Palestine.
The Droceeds will go into the $25,000
fund needed to bring the '97 convention of
Endeavorers to San Francisco.
The guarantee subscriptions received to
date for the convention fund amount to
$16,775. Fonr new subscriptions were re
ceived Saturday.
HANDBALL GAMES.
Union Court Opened Under New man
agement â Exciting Events at the
San Francisco Court.
Both handball courts had a full comple
ment of spectators yesterday and no lack
of players. At the San Francisco court P.
Ryan, the proprietor, kept up his record
by playing in three matches in succession,
showing his wonderful endurance. The
events of the day were two mixed-up
games in which P. T. Donnelly, the
amateur champion, R. Lenihan, J. Har
low, the ex-coast champion, and J. J.
Feeney participated. In the first Don
neily and Leuihan defeated Harlow and
Feenev. and then Lenilian and Feeney de
feated Donnelly ar.d Harlow. Both games
were closely contested.
The Union court has passed into new
hands. Billy McManus, the former pro
prietor, has transferred his interest to
Terry McManus and W. Doran, and the
court was opened yesterday under the
new management. Terry is the champion
heavy- weight, and as both the proprietors
are energetic and popular younÂ« men and
are determined to further the interests of
handball in every possible way their suc
cess should be assured. There was a large
number of their friends present in the
court yesterday, and several interesting
games were played. The event of the day
was a game between R. Lenihan and J.
Nelson ana J. J. Feeney and Terry Mc-
Manus. After each side had won two
games it was decided to postpone the
final till Saturday next.
Following were the games played in the

Anarchist Arrested.
David O. Jones, a street-corner lecturer on
the principles of anarchy, was arrested by
Sergeant Helms and locked up in the Califor
nia-street station on the charge of obstructing
the sidewalk yesterday. Jones airs his notions
about governing the people with tne strong
power of iorce, if force must be us6d, with a
seasoning of anarchy. As he generally collects
a crowd about him, which was the case yester
day afternoon on Pine and Kearny streets, he
was told to move on, but refused. Hence his
arrest.
Slashed With a Knife.
R. H. Long, watchman at Joost Bros.' livery
stables, on Fulton and Gough streets, found a
tramp named Skelly asleep in the barn at an
early hour yesterday morning. He woke him
upana ordered him to leave the place. Skelly
went into the alley followed by Long and
turned quickly upon him, slashing open his
cheek and upper lip with a knife. Long was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where his
wounds were stitched and dressed by Dr. Fitz
gibbon. The police are hunting for Skelly.
WHICH SIDE WILL WIN?
Trial of the Nevada Bank For
gers to Be Commenced
To-Day.
Dean and Wife and Joe . McCloskey
Arrayed Aeainst Becker and
Wife and Cregan.
The long drawn-out preliminaries for
tbe legal battle between tbe police and
the prince of forgers closed yesterday, as
Judge Wallace will commence hearing the
case to-day.
Becker and Cregan, soon after their ar
rival at the City Prison, engaged Attor
neys McPike and Dunne to look after their
interests. They have been materially as
sisted by Mrs. Becker, who has for weeks
been in daily communication with them
and her husband and Cregan.
What the defense will be has not devel
oped, although it is generally understood
it will be a denial that either Becker or
Cregan were here when A. H. Dean forged
the $22,000 draft on the Nevada bank last
December.
The appearance within the past few days
of Joe M:Closkey and Dean's wife has
caused cansternation in the Becker and
Cregan ranks. McCloskey was acquitted
on Dean's confession and a few days later
went East. Now he has returned and will,
it is supposed, appear as a witness for the
prosecution.
Captain Lees and Detective Seymour
have been working assiduously on the case
for weeks past and are ready for the trial
to-day. Like the defendants they are
keeping tneir mouths shut and will not
leave themselves open to attack by the
other side. It is understood they have a
strong case.
The battle is won, so far as the principals
are concerned. On the one side are Becker
and his wife and Cregan and on the other
side Dean and his wife and McCloskey.
Which side will win will be known in a
few days. The general expectation is that
Dean, at any rate, will be either acquitted
or tret off with a light sentence for his
services to the prosecution.
HOW SERPENTS SLEEP.
One Peculiar Fact Is Ihat They Never
Close Their KyeK.
One of the most curious facts with re
gard to snakes is that their eyes are never
closed. Sleeping or waking, alive or
dead, they are always wide-eyed. If we
take a dead snake and examine it closely
we shall soon find the reason â there are
no eyelids. The eye is protected only by a
strong scale, which forms a part of the
epidermal envelope, and is cast off in a
piece with that every time the reptile
molts.
The eye-plate is as clear and transparent
as glass and allows the most perfect vision,
while at the same time (as any close ob
server of the habits of the snake can easily
discover) it ia so hard and tough as per
fectly to protect the delicate organ within
from tnorns and twigs among which, in
flight from enemies or in pursuit of prey,
the reptile so oiten hurriedly glides.
A Strange Death-
A young lady met her death at Laval a
few days ago in a somewhat curious man
ner. 'r She â . nad been . cutting ; roses in â  the
garden, and when returning to the bouse
stumbled and fell so that the scissors in
her hand went through her neck, severing
the jugular vein. She died about three
minutes afterward. â Paris Letter. ;; .:, ..

HIS CRITICISM
WAS RESENTED,
Italian Musicians Declare
War Upon Signor
Lucchesi.
CALLED HIM A SAUSAGE.
Point of the Critic's Sarcasm
Turned Against
Him.
L'ITALIA TAKES A HAND.
Lucchesi Is Advised to Devote His
Olfices Chiefly to American
Singers.
The Italian Philharmonic Society, R. A.
Lucchesi, and the three sausages â these
are the subjects of the hour in musical
circles at North Beach.
Lucchesi is a musical critic who turned
his attention to the Italian Philharmonic
Society, which under the direction of
Professor Spadina has produced a number
of Italian operas with marked success.
The suggestion made to the Italian Phil
harmonic Society was that it should give
as its next opera "I Tre Salami in Barca"
(The three sausages in a boat), a piece of
Italian slang to express a burlesquely
poor performance. It was a fatal refer
ence as far as Lucchesi was concerned.
Years ago he emigrated here from Bologna,
the champion sausage-making city of the
world, and the members of the Philhar
monic Society were quick to recall the
fact. One of them, signing himself "A
Blunt,' promptly contributed a letter to
L'ltalia, in which he said, among other
things:
"In the musical rubric of A Sharp there
is an interesting piece of news which will
certainly please the members of the colony.
The Philharmonic Society has decided to
give as its next opera 'I Tre Salami in
Barca.' Now, I have learned that the
news is true, at least Professor Spadina
wished to give the above-mentioned opera,
and had already found two of the neces
sary sausages, but he was embarrassed
about tne third one, which he wished to
be a genuine Italian sausage. On this ac
count I take the liberty of stating that
here in San Francisco there exists a
sausage, a pure-blooded Bologna sausage,
whicn could make the third in the noble
triad, and that Bologna sausage is, in fact,
the musical critic himself, A Sharp."
This cheerful plea3antry was not to the
liking of the critic, who wrote a letter full
of fire and fury to L'ltalia, to complain of
A Blunt. "We do not accord it the honor
of publication on our papes," says L'ltalia;
"it is a series of trivialities, insolences and
malignities, such as we all know it is bis
special prerogative to write. We will,
i.cwever, reproduce the paragraph which
treats of the Philharmonic Society:
To the Italian Philharmonic Society I have
permitted myself to observe that when it made
public appearances and charged for entrance
I, a critic, I, an Italian artist jealous of his
art, have the right to censure and also parody
it until such times as it shall have reduced
itself to a mere pastime.
"As for the parody performances of the
Philharmonic Society, dear Signor Luc
chesi, were rot yourconcertsalso a joke?"
goes on l'ltalia. "When you tnink that
the chorus singers of the Pnilharmonic So
ciety are honest laborers who work ten and
twelve hours a day and have the patience
and the enthusiasm to pass two "or three
hours after that in the study of opera, be
cause of their love for art, it is absurd and
unjust to ridicule them.
"For the rÂ«st the Philharmonic lives
and prospers amonz the Italians; you live,
and, we hope, prosper among the Ameri
cans. Stay there, the Italians have no use
for you. If you havu no occupation go to
the seaside for a time. You are too fresh
and need a little salting."
This was declaring war with a ven
geance, and now the colony is watching
with interest to see the reckless expendi
ture of ink and paper which will result.
Saturday a letter which was pronounced a
chef d'eeuvre of vituperation was received
at the office of the enterprising journal.
The afternoon issue gave it a good write
up, without however revealing its exact
contents, but it was advertised as being on
exhibition at the editorial rooms.
A big gooseberry or a three - legged
chicken couLi scarcely have aroused more
interest, to judge by th^ number of visi
tors who res-ponded to the invitation. It
has already been proposed to auction off
the autograph copy of the Jetter for the
benefit of the Philharmonic Society,
though the generally expressed opinion is
that it would not bring in enough to pur
chase three sausages, to say nothing of tne
boat. ___^____^^__
HAMLIN A SPEEDY RIDER,
Makes Best Time and Passes
Nineteen Men in the
Road Club's Race.
Kroetz Wins the Olympic Wheel
men's Event and Wing Gets
.Time Prize.
Yesterday was an ideal day for wheeling
in the country. In the City it was cold
and windy, but in San Mateo County and
across the bay, where mo3t of the riders
went, the weather was all that could be
desired, though the roads are somewhat
dusty at this season.
This is the time of year when the club
cyclers delight in road races, and every
Sunday sees several of these events held,
either on the Haywards road or over the
stretch between San Mateo and San Carlos.
There were three such races last Sunday
and three more yesterday, those of the
Bay City, San Francisco and Olympic
wheelmen.
The two first-named clubs held tneirs
across the bay, while the Olympics went
to San Mateo, partly as a compliment to
President Eaton, who resides there, and
partly because they thought the roaa
would be better than the Haywards course.
In tbe latter they were disappointed, as
the road to San Carlos is dusty and un
even, though not much more can be said
of the road over the bay.
Tne Olympics' race was started promptly
at noon, and the men made very good
time, everything considered. There were
no accidents, save to Hadenfsldt, who
punctured a tire and fell back to last
place. Kroetz rode a good race, finishing
first and making second best time. J. E.
Wing made the fastest time, 13:05. Ram
say and Stanley rode a dead heat for sec
ond place, tossed up for it, and Ramsay
won. The handicapping was done by
Jack McGlynn in his usual careful and im
partial way, and was very satisfactory.
The following is tbe table:
The Bay City Wheelmen intended theirs
to be a ten-mile race, but cut it down to
hull that distance, the roads being so poor.
The race started at San Leandro at 11
o'clock and finished in Haywards. C. A.
Kralt made best time, 12:*27, and T. E.
Barry with 2:15 handicap won first place,
keeping the lead from start to finish.
The handicapping was done by Lieuten
ant Dixon, who in the absence of Captain
Caldwell, led a large run of the club to the
finish of the race.
The following table shows the results:
The San Francisco Road Club's event
started at San Leandro at 2 p. m. There
was a larger number ot riders in this race
than in any others, and George W. Ham
lin, who, by the way, is the champion five
mile road rider of the world, made the
best time and upheld his reputation, doing
the distance in 12:03. He rode from scratch
into fourth place, passing nineteen men.
William McGonigle won the race from the
1:45 mark, and the bunch finished as
I follows:
The handicapping of this race was done
by Captain Pbcley and Sol Peiser, and
they distributed the time allowances to
tbe large field of entrants very satisfac
torily.
Of the otner club runs yesterday the
Camera Cyclists went to Walnut Creek,
the Pacifies to Bolinas, the Gar
den Citys to Stevens Creek and the
Golden Gates, Libertys and Californias
to Mayfield.
There will be no club rnns or road races
of any kind of tbe big clubs next Sunday.
They will go to Petaluma Saturday to at
tend the big meet of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen there, and spend Sunday
as the guests of the Petaluma Wheelmen.
R. A. Smyth, official handicapper of the
league, will go to Petaluma this morning
to arrange the handicaps of the various
races.
W. A. Temll of the Bay City Wheelmen
returned from the East Saturday. He has
been following the National racing cir
cuit, but although he won a large number
of races he says the expenses of traveling
are too heavy, and he decided to return to
the coast, where he can live at home and
race when he feels inclined. He left his
team mate, Charles S. Wells, at Hot
Springs, Ark., where be is laid up quite
ill, as already exclusively told "in The
Call. It will* be two or three weeks, Ter
rill says, before Wells will be able to ride
again. Terrill will race at Petaluma next
Saturday.
Frank W. Fuller, Georee H. Stratton
and John F. McGlynn, of the Olympic
Club Wheelmen, will leave the end of this
week on a three weeks' trip into Lake
County.
Byron D. Bent of the Bay City Wheel
men started awheel for Los Angeles yes
terday.
RUN TO TOCALOMA.
Red Rock Cycling and Its Friends
Have a Pleasant Day's Outing.
The Red Rock Cycling Club had a merry
outing yesterday. The club, with its
friends, took a run to Tocaloma, stopping
at Camp Taylor for dinner. Among the
members and guests were: Rome Harris
(captain), El L<ee, William Driscol, Liouis
Duprat, William Harrison. Peter Richter,
George Douglass. Dr. Sichel, Eddie Welsh,
M. Lynch, Mrs. R. Harris, Miss Etta Al
len, Miss Alice Allen and .tliss Rossmore.
In the evening the club was entertained
by Mrs. R. Harris.
LANDING NEWS IN BOTTLES.
The Service Cttptain Bartlett Rendered
to Cuban Patriots-
An interesting story is furnished by
Captain G. Bartlett of the British bark
lodine, laden with sugar, which was ob
tained only through the courtesy of the
Cuban patriots, who control the output of
sugar from interior points in tbe island.
Previous to the vessel leaving Philadel
phia the Cuban women of that city
shipped large quantities of courtplaster,
liniment and medicine of all descriptions,
which were safely delivered at a Cuban
camp five miles in the interior. Captain
Bartlett remained xn the Cuban camp for
four days.
He was able to deliver into the hands of
the Cubans valuable documents from the
Junta in New York, and in return has in
his possession equally valuable docu
ments which he is to deliver to the
Cubans in New York.
The bark was anchored about two miles
off shore and a Cuban swam off to the
vessel in the nignt with the documents
from the patriot camp sealed in bottles,
which were connected to his body by ropes
and towed astern. In the same manner
the documents from this country were
taken ashore by the swimmer.
A schooner bound to CienfuegoS' with
sugar from Trinidad, Cuba, for the United
States, and owned by the American Cen
tral Sugar Refinery, was sunk by the in
surgents at the mouth of the River Maeti,
so that the Spanish Government could not
collect any revenue from it. The lodine's
cargo was allowed to be shipped to this
country throueh the courtesy oi the patri
ots, who permitted the American Central
Sugar Refinery to grind 2000 tons of sug tr.
In the camp visited by Captain Baraett
there were about tifty cultivated and re
fined ladies of Cuban society, who had en
listed in the Cuban army with relatives
and friends. The patriots are well sup
plied with provisions. They however,
are sadly in need of rifles, ammunition and
medicine. In all of the skirmishes wit
nessed by Captain Bartlett the patriots) hud
by far the best of them. â New York Sun.

If you wish prosperity now is the time
to work for it.
The home industry should' haye the
borne market.
All that Whitney gained by his letter is
a reputation as a quitter.
So long as the tariff is kept to the front
Democracy will be kept to the rear.
Young men who cast their first vote for
McKinley will always be proud of it.
The deficit tariff makes more than half
the trouble in the National treasury.
Join a Republican clab and do your
share in the work of organizing victory.
In the Democratic camp the plot is
rapidly thickening to the curdliug point.
Read The Call during the campaign
and eet the news of all parties impartially
reported.
If Henry Watterson had stayed at home
he migbt have been mentioned for the
Presidency.
If the Cubans can stand Weyler off until
Cleveland leaves the White House they
will be all right
Presidential candidates will jostle one
another at Chicago, but not one of them
will give another a push.
What the people of this country need Is
less financial discussion and more work
on a good financial basis.
Carlisle has been the first Democrat to
go op Balt River this year, but there are
others who will go farther.
This is a good time for young men to
leave the old Democratic hulk and get in
with the party of prosperity.
If Cleveland was steering the Demo
cratic ship at a rock he has the satisfac
tion of knowing that he hit it.
Grover may be said to be still in the
line, bnt it is only the extreme gold-bag
ring and it won't count this year.
The issue of work and wages does not
sound big, bnt it reaches every home and
affects the welfare of every family.
This year we sweep the Democratic party
off the face of the earth and give the
Populists a chance to fill the vacancy.
The people do the shouting for Mc-
Kinley, and it will be remembered in this
connection that the people also do the
voting.
The gold Democrats of the East may
abuse Teller now, but when they get to
Chicago they may have to imitate his
example.
The money question is bat one phase of
the great issue of restoring proiperity,
and is so understood by the common sense
of the people.
It is kind of Chicago to prepare an extra
lot of ambulance wagons for the Demo
cratic Convention, but perhaps a garbage
cart or two would have suited the occasion
just as well.
The more the money question is debated
the more the peoDle understand that what
we need most is a tariff that will yield
abundant revenues and provide work and
â¢wages for ihe people.
California âants protection for her
industries and governmental aid in pro
moting her commerce, and as a conse
quence she must vote for the party of
progress and enterprise.
It is worth noting that every time the
country begins to prosper Democracy
weakens and whenever Democracy gets
t-trong the country weakens. It is a
calamity party whichever way you take it.
The free silver Prohibitionists in Rhode
Island are reported to J>ave captured the
party organization and acquired the party
organ, and as a result the resident's of the
other States are complaining of the noise
of the music.
The Sultan has recently declared the
troubles in Crete would rtid if the Cretans
would lay down their arms, and there is a
general belief that under those circum
stances the Cretans would end about the
game time as their troubles.

FIGHT ONE BATTLE AT A TIME.
Carl Schurz is of the opinion that "with
out an active spirit of enterprise there can
be no prosperity." Mr. Schurz always did
say wise things, when he felt like it, and
his long association with the Democracyâ
since 1884â has not impaired his under
standing nor abated the flow of words of
wisdom, when he will allow them to
flow. Now, if Mr. Schurz will add to the
wise words quoted above "and without
confidence in the ability and willingness
of those who are directing the affairs of
the Government there can be no active
spirit, no enterprise nor no prosperity,"
be will have uttered a great truth, but he
will do nothing of the kind.
"Will Mr. Schurz tell us what it is that
creates an active spirit of enterprise, and
what it is that makes for prosperity? If
pressed for an answer he would say "Ap
plied Clevelandism." The people of the
United States are noted the world over lor
enterprise, but they have not been very
prosperous in recent years, nor will they
be until the iron chains which applied
Clevelandism has wound about them are
removed. The spirit of their enterprise
found pretty full play for over thirty
years, and during that time no people on
earth were so prosperous, and during the
operation of tnat great and wise industrial
legislation of 1890 their prosperity was phe
nomenal. This Mr. Schurz knows very
well. But when that legislation was
forced to give way to applied Cleveland
ism the active spirit of enterprise of the
people was so circumscribed and handi-
capped that not only bad they no pros
perity, bat they were forced to stand and
see what they had gained in other years
go from them.
The same old spirit of enterprise which
Mr. Schurz talks about is still alive,
though it cannot be said to be very active,
nevertheless it is watching and praying
for the passing of applied Clevelandism
and the returning of applied common
business sense as it was before the indus
trial props and defenses were removed by
applied Clevelandism. But Mr. Schurz
mast not be misunderstood. What he
means by "active spirit of enterprise" is
the adoption of the gold standard of re
demption money, once for all, and thus
put the seal of the Nation's disapproval
upon any plan or proposition that winks
at or harbors anything that contemplates
the restoration of silver to the monetary
system of the country by international or
any other kind of agreement.
Mr. Schurz, like Mr. Cleveland and
every other Democrat, be he a silver man
or goldite, believes that the present tariff
is too high and that very many more arti
cles should be put upon the free list.
There is no division at all in the Demo
cratic party on that question. Therefore,
it matters not how divided the party may
be on other issues, the rank and file and
leaders everywhere are of one mind as to
the tariff question â that there should be
reductions all along the line so as to give
foreign countries a stronger footing in our
markets. Now, in the face of the indis
putable fact that the Democracy is schem
ing behind all quarrels in its ranks over
the money question to reach an actual free
trade basis for the country, is it not tha
duty of Republicans to drop all other is
sues for the moment and see that the
foundation of the country's industries is
not carried away ?
There never was a time in the history of
the Republican party when tho best inter
ests of the country demanded more imper
atively that it close up its ranks and de
fend the great American principle of
protection to tne peoples farms, shops,
factories and mills. The Democratic part}',
by its threat to destroy our industries,
obliges the Republican party to come to
their rescue, and, as Mr. Schurz would
say, let us engage in the defense of our
wealth-making agencies with "an active
spirit of enterprise." Let us fight one
battle at a time.
FIFTY YEARS AGO.
The fiftieth anniversary of the taking
formal possession of California by the
United States will be celebrated at Mon
terey one week from to-morrow, July 7.
Although the idea of celebrating the an
niversary of the event in a way that should
include participation in the festivities by
Californiang generally originated in Mon
terey the plan was caught up and ap
proved by all localities, so it will be a
State rather than a local affair. It is
doubtful if Commodore Sloat realized,
indeed no man could have realized, what
the hoisting of the stars and stripes over
the Custom-house of Monterey at that
time would mean to the United States in
future year^. It was one of those events
in the history of a nation in which the
hand of Providence can almost be seen.
There seemed to have been a combina
tion of circumstances which turned Cali
fornia over to the keeping of the United
Statesâ a combination so far-reaching in in
fluence and of so much significance that it
is easy to believe that a power higher than
man was directing the course of human
events in those days to the end that
broader and better ways might be opened
for the advance of that civilization which
is the pride of the world and the glory of
America.
The history of the leading up to the act
of taking possession of California by hoist
ing the stars and stripes over the Custom
house at Monterey is well known to every
school boy and girl, but there is a deeper
meaning to it all than the mere history
facts reveal. Had not the ships of the
United States navy been fleeter, better
officered and the crews more enthusiastic
than those of the Englisn navy the flag
of Great Britain and not the stars and
stripes would have claimed California,
and it is just possible that instead of being
one of the grandest of the confederation
of States California would be a British
province to-day.
But, however that may be, there is no
doubt at all about what the people should
do on this occasion. Every county and
municipality of California should be repre
sented at Monterey on July 7, tnat the
celebration may have the dignity, charac
ter and importance of what might justly
be called the fi'tietii anniversary of Cali
fornia's independence; besides, it will be
a very proper time for the societies of the
first settlers and Native Sons and Daugh
ters to gather their hosts and join in fra
ternal greeting.
FIRST-BALLOT CANDIDATES.
Democratic newspapers are trying to
make It appear that Mr. McKinley's nom
ination on the first ballot is evidence suf
ficient that there wag a controlling inner
wheel in the machinery of the Republican
party at St. Louis, otherwise it would
have taken a score or more ballots to
nominate. The fact is, it is a very com
mon thing for Republican National Con
ventions to nominate on the first ballot.
The first convention, held in Philadelphia
in 1856, nominated Fremont on the first
ballot. In 1864 Lincoln was nominated on
the first ballot. Grant was nominated on
the first ballot in 1868 and again in 18?2.
In 1892 Harrison was nominated on the
first ballot just as McKinley was nomi
nated on the first ballot in 1896. Eleven
National Republican Conventions have
been held and at six of them the can
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNG 29, 1896.
didate was named on the first b.illot. So,
after all, there was nothing so wonderful
in Mr. McKinley carrying the St. Louis
Convention on the first call of States.
In this connection it might be well to
observe that when Fremont was nomi
nated the voting population of the United
States was, in round numbers, 4.000,000.
In 1892 it was 12,000,000 and it is estimated
that there are now over 13,000,000 voters.
The voting population between 1856 and
1860 did not increase materially, so it is
safe to say that the voting strength of the
country increased under Republican rule
between 1860 and 1892 fully 8,000,000. Be
tween the came years the wealth increase
of the country was from about $15,000,
-000,000 to nearly $70,000,000,000. No other
argument is needed to prove that the
country needs to have the Republican
party in power all the time.
FORLORN DEMOCRATS.
In its long, tempestuous and more or
less disgraceful career, the Democratic
party has always managed to keep and
maintain some sort of resting-place to
which it could retire during periods when
it was under the condemnation of the
people. Even during the long years be
tween 1860 and 1892 it had its own cabin,
albeit it was located in the swamp of
public opinion, where the party fed upon
such crumbs of comfort as it could gather
from recollections of days when it was in
better circumstances, but never before did
any one consider the party ao homeless
and forsaken that it would have to submit
to the humiliation of receiving an invita
tion from a Taubeneck to accept the
doubtful hospitalities of a Populist party.
No doubt the Democracy is hungry
enough, bnt bad and friendless as it is
there is no charity in offering the thin
and tasteless consomme of Populism.
Dives did not treat Lazarus that mean.
But the Tellerites offend quite as deeply
as do the Populists when they invite the
Democracy to surrender every principle it
ever had and follow their banner. Were
the Democracy to do that or accept Taube
neck's offer it would be nothing more
than an exchange of swamps. It would
still be poor and distressed, besides it
would have the added disgrace of having
sold its birthright. The Democratic party
has done some very idiotic things in its
day. but it has never let go its hold upon
certain alleged political principles, and
what is more, it could not without admit
ting that it never should have come into
existence, which, is true, by the way,
whether it admits it or not.
Senator Peffer is the manliest man of
them all. He is a middle-of-the-road Pop
ulist, and wants no going to the right or
to the left. He says it was Taubeneck's im
pudence or impertinence, and not the
wish of the party, that overtures of any
kind be made to silver Democrats or Tel
lerites. His position is that while re
cruits from all parties are wanted they
are not wanted unless they renounce with
out persuasion all allegiance to their old
faith and come as obedient disciples of a
great cause. And Peffer is right, for
what would it avail himself and the other
founders of the Populist party if the glory
of their labors is to be turned over to
Teller or anyone else? Peffer knows, as
does every other nonest Populist know,
that there is a scheme on loot to use the
People's party to help build np something,
anything, to defeat William McKinley,
and he is to be commended for employing
every possible means to prevent it. It is
evident that Taubeneck, Teller and certain
renegade Democrats are doing their best
to organize a new party for personal politi
cal advantage, but they will fail, poor, for
lorn and hungry as the Democracy is.
THE VETO POWER.
A man may be the constitutional Presi
dent of the United States and still bean
autocrat, and he may be the constitutional
President and be a patriot. The President
cannot deal directly with the people, but
he does indirectly, through Congress, for
its members are the direct agents of the
people. The President has the legal but
not the moral right to refuse to obey the
will of the people by using the veto power,
as Cleveland has done sev er*al times. It is
a power that seems to be necessary to
have lodged in the President, but it was
originally conferred for prudential pur
poses, and never to be used as a means of
coercion or revenge. The presumption is
that if Congress enacts a law it is enacted
because the people want just such a Jaw,
and when the President refuses to let it
become an operative law he assumes that
he is wiser than the people.
In selecting a man for President it is
well enough for the people to consider the
veto-power question. The best way to do
that intelligently is to study the candi
date's public and, as far as may be, his
private record. The Democrats have not
yet named their candidate, but we may be
sure if the Cleveland wing wins the candi
date would, if elected, follow in the foor
steDs of Cleveland in all official acts. If
Bland or Boles should be nominated the
country would have to run the risic of
future developments, but with McKinley
there is no room for doubt. He is a patriot
by nature, and he cheerfully recognizes
the people as the sovereigns and that their
will is law. We know in advance, there
fore, that the will of the people would not
be ignored by employing the veto power if
he were President.

The Mariposa Miner celebrated its first birth
day anniversary lost week. The editor, W. W.
Booth, takes occasion to remark that the
Miner i\ hi done no inconsiderable part of the
work of building up the town of Coulterville
and the mining industry of that section of
California, and concludes: "It may not be
amiss to point out at the present time that the
prospects of this goldfield were never brighter
than they are at present. New mines are
opening up and old ones are being reopened.
The coming twelve months promise to be very
prosperous ones for all in the community."

A gigantic scheme for the generation of elec
tric power and the irrigation of farm lands In
Yuba County has been set on foot, by the or
ganization of the Marysville ana Nevada Power
and Water Company, with a capital of $2,000,
-000. The principal place of business is Smarts
ville, and the Plumes Independent gives these
further particulars:
"The company will commence business with
the right to 70,000 inches of water, and in ad
dition will own over twelve miles of ditches
already in u*e, with clear title to the rights of
way for sufficient ditches to supply a large
area east of Marysville. This company also
owns the land where their dam will be built,
and have acquired the entire system of water
rights and ditches of James O'Brien of Smarts*
ville, who is one of the leading promoters.
'â¢It is the intention to generate power for any
purpose that may be marketable. The com
pany intend to erect a dam like the one at
Folsom, and to furnish electric power, as they
would be able to develop over 7000 horse
power. The ditches will be used for irrigation
purposes. It is one of the most available sites
ou the Pacific Coast for the purpose intended.
They will be able to transmit power to Browns
Valley and many other places. It is the inten
tion to erect a rock dam 200 feet high which
would cost from $80,000 to $125,000. Tne site
of the dam will be 1000 feet above tidewater,
thus affording ample fall to irrigate adjacent
territory."
Experiments in hemp-growing in the vicin
ity of Gridley seem to indicate that an indus
try of much importance to this coast is about
to be developed there. The Gridley Herald
furnishes this information:
"N. S. Kirk's ranch, about two miles east of
Gridley, consists mainly of rich bottom lands.
It has heretofore been devoted to grain, but
this j-ear Mr. Kirk, who is from Illinois, deter
mined to try a more profitable crop. Two hun
dred acres were thoroughly plowed and culti
vated and planted to hemp. It has made a
marvelous growth and now stands on an aver
age nine feet high, and by the time it is ready
for cutting It will reach a height of fifteen
feet Mr. Kirk expects to cut the crop by har
vesters, the plant then being left to cure in the
field. When it is dry it will be hauled to the
river or reservoir ana there soaked until rot
ten, when the fiber is separated and shipped
East for manufacture into hempen products.
A large lot of machinery has been brought
from the East for the purpose of breaking the
hemp and is now being placed in position by
employes."
The Copperopolis mines are to be opened.
'â¢They have been shutdown for several years,"
says the Stockton Mail, "as at the time of their
closing the price of copper was so low that it
did not pay to work them. Now matters are
different, for the increased demand for copper
caused, among other things, by the great de
velopment in all sorts of electrical devices, has
sent the price up to such a figure that the
Ames estate, to which the mines at Coppero
polis belong, has decided to open them up
once more.
"If the Copperopolis mines start again, as
now appears to te certain, it will redound to
Stockton's advantage, for when they were in
operation before this city was made tne bnse of
supplies for everything used by the miners.
They did a great deal more buying here than
the gold miners farther up along the rocd.
For this reason the local merchants will be in
terested in the statement that copper is
again to be minea there.
"There has never been any doubt as to the
richness of the mines at Copperopolis. They
are said to be far richer in copper than the
great Anaconda mine in Montana that was re
cently sola to a Parisian syndicate for a fabu
lous sum. The great difficulty has been in
operating them and eetting the product to
market. The mines are some distance from
the railroad, and it is possible if they are
opened up again on any iarger scale, as is con
templated, a branch road may be run from
the Milton line to the mines. When copper
was very low the mines were found to be un
profitable, in spite of their richness, but now
that the price of the metal has advanced so
materially tnere is a fortune for the owners in
the mine."
At La Grange, Merced County, an electric
light and power plant is to be established and
the current transmitted to Stockton for manu
facturing purposes. Commenting on this mat
ter the Hanford Journal observes: "The con
stantly increasing number of plants applying
the millions of horsepower of wasted energy of
the Sierras promises very shortly to bring
about a development that has for years been
retarded by an absence of cheap power. With
the advent of cheaper power will come a man
ufacturing population that will create a mar
ket for the many products of our farms with
out intervening railroad charges between pro
ducer and consumer."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Colonel John Lane of Spokane, Wash., fell
asleep as he sat in the office of the Occidental
yesterday afternoon, and his identity for the
time being was lost in the small army of chair
boarders, men with schemes and political
hangen-on that dally ana wearily linger in
the comfortable hotel lobbies of the City.
But the colonel's name was on the register
and he had just completed a long journey, so
he came honestly by the privilege he was en
joying.
Some one had pinned on his chair a card on
which was written, "Wake me at 6 o'clock and
come and dine with me." Fortunately for him
he was the first to bestir himself, and the pos
sibilities of a dangerous rush of the long
undined vanished.
The colonel is United Btates Indian In
spector and has been during the present ad
ministration. He has come to San Francisco
to take charge of the warehouse in which are
to be stored the supplies to be distributed later
to the various reservations in the Pacific
States. His father was Senator Joseph Lane,
known after the Mexican War as "Fighting
Joe" Lane. Among the Indians Colonel Lane
is said to be an object of admiration, and a
man to whom they appeal as a just arbiter of
all their disputes.
"The Indians," said he yesterday, as he at

The best known and most traveled cat on
the water front is Tom of the Alameo*. For
thirteen years he has been making voyages
between San Francisco and Sydney, New South
Wales, and in that time has made forty-six
round trips and traveled 667,550 miles. He
is known in Honolulu, Apia, Auckland and
Sydney almost as well as in San Francisco, but
as he is now growing old and fat he very
rarely ventures ashore.
Wnen Tom was a kitten he one day strayed
from the bark Aid en Besse aboard tne Ala
meda. He would make friends with no one,
but roamed the steamer at his own free will.
Chief Engineer Little tried to make friends
with him, but failed, and not even the most
dainty tidbits could coax him into the engine*
room.
As he grew older Tom began hunting rats,
and he soon had the upper part of the vessel
clear of the pests. While chasing one of the
vermin it took refuge in the galley, and Tom
in his eagerness to get at it jumped on the hot
stove. His feet were badly burned and he at
once made for the hold, where he hid himself.
When the cat did not appear for twenty
four hours the chief began to make inquiries.
The sailors told him of the accident and said
the cat was hiding in the cargo. For nearly an
hour Little crawled about in the lower hold
and finally found the poor brute. He carried
him to his room and fixed his paws np with
vaseline. For over a week he doctored and
fed him and now Tom and the chief are in
separable. There are three other cats on the
Alameda, but not one of them dare set foot in
the cabin or on the poopdeck.
In that part of the ship Tom is master. He
is also master of the chief engineer's room
and is a great deal better than a watchdog. No
outsider can get in while Tom is on duty, and
that is almost constantly. On the last trip of
the steamer from Australia Tom and his
master were photographed by one of the pas
sengers. The picture is prized as Mr. Little
expects the cat to finish his million-mile run
by water before he dies. This will be a world's
record.
Colonel Carlos Qonzales, a retired officer of
the Mexican army, is at the Lick. But he is
not alone.
When he arrived the other night it took
three carriages to bring his wife and family
from the ferry, and as he marshaled his forces
in the hotel office the curious loiterers drew
back against the wall and whispered to one
another that an orphanage must have burned
down.
The colonel is from a very productive part of
Mexico. His principal hacienda, :La Concha,
twelve miles from Torreon, in the State of
Coahuila, is surrounded by eight or nine
square miles of cultivated land, all of which
belongs to the man of numerous family.
Cotton is one of the products, although no
less than 500 other families live upon the
colonel's broad acres; so it is a well-settled
country. In addition to this estate, on which
he employs so many men, he has a lot of land
let out to different individuals. He owns land
all along the Nazas River, the best lands in the
country.
The colonel does not speak English, but he
has an interpreter in -the party. He is a short
man, about 55 years of age, and wears a long
black beard, fierce military mustache and a
high silk hat.
It is his intention to place some of h la chil
dren in the College of Notre Dame at San Jose
and others in a school at Los Angeles. He
will, however, take five of the younger ones
back with him to Mexico after he has visited
Monterey and other coast towns dear to the
heart of every Mexican who thinks of what
might have been had the Mexican war never
occurred. _______________

The Silver Questionâ Subscriber, Repub
lican, M. K.,H. D. P., A. R. and Ã., City, Reader,
Riverside and P. H. M., Modesto, Cal.â All
these correspondents want an explanation of
the silver question, free silver coinage, the
coinage law* prior to 1873, bimetallism, ratio
i
of 16 to 1, and one writes: "Will you please
explain in 100 words, for the benefit of young
voters, the silver Question?" To this corre
spondent the answer is, "It cannot be done."
The eminent men of the age have grown gray
haired in their endeavors to solve this ques
tion and explain it in many thousands of
words, so that the general mass of people could
understand it, but they have not as yet been
successful. The question whether it is the
wiser policy of the United States Government
to admit the free coinage of silver In unlimited
quantities on the established ratio -with gold,
or to restrict the minting of the cheaperroetal,
has for many years constituted an important
factor in party politics. Bimetallism is the
doctrine that two metals can and ought, at the
same time, in the some country, be adopted as
standards of value, and to bear to each other
a lixea ratio, established and recognized
by the Government. Bimetallic money is
money constituted by admitting both
gold and silver to free coinage and
making each an unlimited legal tender at a
certain relation in value to the other. Mono
metnllism is the use of only one metal as the
standard of value. Free silver or lree coinage
of silver is to have the mints coin silver bul
lion for individual! the same as it does gold
bullion. The Government coins gold for indi
viduals, making no charge therefor except the
coit M the alloy. The desire of those who de
mand free silver coinage is to have silver
coined, as gold now is, for any one who brings
it to the mint at merely nominal charge, al
lowing the owners of the bilver bullion to se
cure the profits which go to the Government
when it coins silver dollars. An advocate of
free silver coinage says: "Measured by com
modities, gold has ripen 50 per cent since the
demonetization of silver in 1873; silver, as
compared with gold, has fallen not more than
30 per cent. Silver, therefore, as measured by
commodities, has no: fallen, but, on the con
trary, the weight of testimony shows that
there has been a slight appreciation of silver
in spite of its demonetization. The free use of
silver will lessen the demand for gold and in
crease the demand for silver, thus causinggold
to fall and silver to rise, and in this way the
par of the two metals cap be brought about
without injustice to creditor or debtor." On
the other hand, the opponents of silver lay
that the free coinage of the white metal
cannot be demanded as a matter of justice, as
all contracts since 1873 have been on a
gold basis; tnat the Government cannot main
tain the price of sliver; that free coinage could
not restore its value; that it would result in
overproduction, an unloading by other nations
and a further decline in price; that it would
not establish bimetallism, but would drive
gold out, bring the United Stp.tes to the sil
ver basis and result in the inflating of priÂ«%g,
and increase the cost of living. The meaning
of the expression 16 to 1 is that a silver dollar
shall, by weight, contain sixteen times as
much bullion as does a gold dollar, and that
both coins shall be legal tender at equal value.
By the law of 1792 any person could have gold
or silver coined at the mint into lawfu-l money,
receiving therefor coins of the same specie of
bullion, weight for weight, of the pure metal
contained therein. The gold standard was 11
parts pure to one of alloy, the silver was 1485
pure to 179 alloy. The ratio was 15 to 1. In
1795 24 cents per ounce was retained for sil
ver below the standard, and 4 cents for gold.
In 1828 a sum \ru retained from silver bullion
requiring the test for materials and wastage. In
1834 there was a deduction of one-half percent
from all standard gold and silver deposited for
coinage, if paid for in coin, within five days
from deposit. In 1837 the standard gold and
silver coin was made nine-tenths pure and
1 1-10 alloy, and legal tender for any sum. In
1803 tne weight of half dollars was reduced
from 206% to 192 grains, and lesser coins in
the same ratio, and mr.de legal tender to the
amount of $5. No private deposits for coinage
in these coins were received, and charges of >$
per cent were made for refining. By the law
of February 12, 1873, the weight of the trade
dollar was to be 420 grains, of the half dollar
193 grains, and legal tender to the extent of
$5. Silver bullion could be deposited for
coinage into trade dollars only; gold for coin
age for the benefit of the depositor. One-fiftti
of 1 per cent was charged for converting
standard gold bullion into coin and silver into
trade dollars. Silver coins, except trade
ao liars, were to be exchanged for gold coins at
par In sum* not exceeding $100. Seigniorage
is the difference between the cost of a mass of
bullion and the face value of the pieces of coin
from it. It is a percentage upon bullion
brought to the mint to be coined or exchanged
for coin. _________________
A POPULAR SHIRT WAIST FOR
LADIES.
This will be found a very becoming waist,
the fullness below the flat yoke making it a
good shape, both for slender and stout figures.
Made of a colored chambray, say plain pink,
or pink and white stripe, with cuffs and collar
of white, is the latest fancy. The collar and
cuffs may be made detachable, one of the
features of the season's waists, simply binding
neck and sleeves, and making the necessary
buttonholes in bands and the cuffs and collar.
Make a set to match, and another of white
linen, and twice the amount of service can be
got out of one waist.
Plain natural colored linen is much used
this season, and some show a piping of white
around cuffs, collar and yoke.
The patten is No. 7834 and cuts in seven

and Their Lady Friends Eapj
a Banner Ou ing.
The Lincoln Club, which is composed
mainly of the young Republicans of the
Second Ward, held its annual picnic
yesterday at Schuetzen Park. The club,
which is one of the oldest in the City, j
having exisced for many years as the Mor
row Republican Club, has at present a
membership of about 275, at least half of
which number turned out in uniform at
the ratification parade held a week ago.
The following are the officers of the club:
President, Henry S. Martin; vice-presidents,
Charles Heinz, Adoiph Wolf; financial secre
tary, Thomas Mullins ; recording secretary, Ed
G. Kendal; treasurer, Louis Rae Jr.
Executive committeeâ Alex Campbell Jr.,
Fred Jones, H- Eilich, H. Hansen, John
Gleason, Jr.
Investigation committeeâ Joieph Barbetta,
chairman; M. Bushaway, H. Ostheimer, W.
Corcoran, A. Danegri.
Nearly 400 attended yesterday's picnic
and enjoyed the beautiful balmy air that
is peculiar to a June day in Marin. The
vivacious summer girl, unusually charm
ing in shirt waist ana straw hat Was much
in evidence. The picnickers scattered
about the grounds, enjoyed the shade of
the oaks on the hillside or stretched out
luxuriously on the grass.
The games, whicn. were to have been
held, were caned off, but a tug-of-war was
held between the Lincoln Club team, cap
tained by J. Eilich, and the North End
team, with P. Riley as captain and M. Mc-
Gowan anchorman. The 300 pounds of
anchorman, Henry Martin of the Lincolns,
decided the contest in favor of the latter
club.
In the afternoon a spirited contest took
place in the bowline-alley between two
expert bowlers of the club, M. Busuway
and H. Jurrs. The two have frequently
come together in contests at knocking
down the pins and are pretty evenly
matched. The contest was finally decided
yesterday In favor of Bushway, who came
off victor with a score of 20? as against
Jurrs' 183.
Dancing was continued during the day
in the pavilion, where over a hundred
couples "tripped the light fantastic." The
eaze of all onlookers was centered on Jack
Gleason, who led dance after dance with
Miss Alfreits. a wonderfully vivacious and
â¢â¢summery" blonde.
Also prominent among the dancers wert:
Mr. and Mrs. Chanter, Mr. and Mrs. Gra
ham, Mr. and Mrs. *\ L. Jones, Mr. and
Mrs. Bushwell and Mr. and Mrs. Cooper.
Several gate prizes were offered and the
winners will be announced at the ball
which the club intends giving in about
three weeks. At the same time the win
ner of the $100 prize in the guessing con
test that has recently been held will also
be announced. The prize was offered to
any young lady who could guess the
original of a picture on the announcement
card of the picnic.
Quite a number of political celebrities cf
the Fourty-fourtb District were conspicu
ous at yesterday's outing. Among them
were ex-Assemblyman Zocchi of the Forty
fourth, who is a candidate for State Sena
tor, G. Vaiero and Jack Gleason, also can
didates for the Senatorship, J. Baciualupi,
the County Corntnitteenian of the district,
Fred Jones, Tom Moran, Charlie Cooper,
Johnny Wessel and Tom Graham.
Although the crowd at the picnic was
not so large as had been expected, never
theless the outing was successful and very
enjoyable, thanks to the efforts of the fol
lowing, who had the matter in charge:
Committee of arrangements â John Gleason,
chairman; Charles Cooper, Adoiph Wolf, Vie
Casamajou; floor manager, John Wissell; as
sistant floor manager, Frank Bellinger; floor

ESSIE VIOLA'S ESCAPE,
How It Happened That a Bal
loon Ascended Without
an Aeronaut.
The Presence of Mind of Two Men
'Saved a Young Woman From
a Terrible Deatb.
A balloon high up in the air, with a
parachute and trapeze-bar dangling from
i it, but no one on the bar, was witnessed
by thousands of people a quarter before 5
yesterday afternoon.
As the sphere rose higher ana higher
ana floated eastward the impression was
that Miss Essie Viola, who had been billed
to ascend from the Haight-street grounds,
had met with an accident or had been
dashed to pieces.
True, there was an accident, but the
young woman who has soared toward the
j clouds more than sixty times was unin
jured through the presence of mind of
those who stood alongside of her at the
time the balloon was released. By their
action she was undoubtedly saved from a
horrible death by tire.
When the sphere was filled to its capa
city the word was given to the man on
the inside. He was required to place a
large wooden cover on the top of the cyl
inder to shut out the flame that arises
from the mass of unconsumed oil in the bot
tom of the furnace. Yesterday there was
some mistake to that part of the wore.
When the balloon bad been failed Miss
Viola, attired in a neat bloomer suit of the
baggy pattern, accompanied by her sis;er
Millie, walked to her position at the ex
treme end of the parachute lines, raised
the side ropes that connect the trapeze
bar to these lines and was all ready to
make the usual run before the balloon
raises high enough to lift the aeronaut
from the ground. The rope tbat held the
balloon was drawn through the ring, the
swinging arm hauled out of the way and
the order, "Everybody let go!" was given.
This was obeyed promptly, and the in
flated sphere rose 'slowly, and as it got
above the level of the cylinder there was
seen a great mass of flame and a cry went
up from a hundred voices, "She's on fire."
The parachute dragged over the flames,
then the lines and finally the trapeze, but
Miss Vioia was not clinging to it. The
balloon, however, was not on fire.
Miss Viola was being held by two men
and there was a look of disappointment on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1896.
her face, and then, as the balloon soared
upward some one cried "Fake!" whereat
the fair young aeronaut burst into tears
and was led away to her dressing-room.
Those who held her saw tbat if she fol
lowed in tbo line of the parachute she
would be dragged over the name and that
there was danger that her clothes would
have taken tire, and it was to avert that
calamity that they held her.
"It is a areat disappointment to me,"
said Miss Viola, "that I was not allowed
to go up, but what hurt me was to hear
the cry of 'fake.' This is the first time
that I have failed to leave the ground
when I started to make an ascension."

the cares of business he had opportunity
to make observations in New York, Chi
cago, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Wash
ington. In his travels he met many old
Californians. He saw three men in New
York who left this City millionaires, but
are now "broke" financially.
H. B. Slaven, who was well known as a
progressive druggist in San Francisco some
fifteen years aÂ«o, is living in sumptuous
style in New York. Mr. Slaven is a multi
millionaire and a successful business man.
The foundation of his fortune was laid in
the execution of large contracts for dredg
ing tne Panama canal under De Lesseps'
administration.
While to Mr. Kelly's mind business may
be a trifle dull in San Francisco there is
not the stagnation here that he observed
in several Eastern cities. Washington,
for example, was dull beyond description.
A druggist there who bought in two years
ago, paying $9000 for the investment, had

been losing money right along, and was
quite willing to sell out for one-half the
money tbat he paid to get in.
Throughout the entire Eastern section of
the country there was complaint of dull
times and little trade. In the conveni
ences of railway travel the tourist said the
Eastern lines were but little superior to
the* roads in California. As for street rail
way facilities Kan Francisco was unsur
passed. He came home convinced that
this City is alive and up to date.

FIRST McKINLEY
CLUB IN TOWN,
Organized Six Years Ago
for the Man From
Canton.
MEN WITH FORESIGHT.
Republicans of the Forty-First
District Lead Off for
Success.
ACTIVE POLITICAL WOKKSRF.
The Club Stuck to the Magnetic Name
That Is Sure to
Win.
In the northwest section of San Fran
cisco six years ago the wideawake politi
cians saw the handwriting on the wall and
correctly read the hieroglyphic characters
there displayed that the next Republican
President of the United States would be
Major William McKinley of Ohio.
Having thus interpreted the prophecy
there was no time lost in preparing to do
honor to the illustrious name of him who
will restore this great Nation to the high
and lofty station destined for it, and to
which his Republican anflfestors on the
party line had placed it before the all-de
stroying hand of Grover Cleveland and his
followers had pulled it down to a condition
of financial bankruptcy and commercial
stagnation.
Imbued with enthusiasm and full of
hope in the fulfillment of their prophetic
vision, they organized the McKinley Club,
thinking that probably two years later
would bring forth the happy result; but
National politics are as uncertain as State
or municipal in the selection of winning
candidates. Major McKinley did not re
ceive the nomination, and to all ordinary
purposes the McKinley Club was a misfit
in tho campaign of 1892.
But to the loyal forces of the Forty-first
Assembly District this little disappoint
ment in not getting their idol at tiie head
of the ticket was no obstacle. They stood
by their party and did what they could for
the election of General Harrison knowing
that the next time would bring to them
the man for whom their club had been or
ganized and that he would yet become the
standard-bearer of the party.
Time fulfilled their hopes and when the
Republican Convention at St. Louis a few
weeks ago nominated William McKinley
as the next President the hearts of the Mc-
Kinley Club members took a sudden boom
and the club is now one of the foremo3t
political organizations in the city.
This is all the more apparent as it was
the first McKinley club started not only in
Ban Francisco but the State of California.
This year it will be no misfit, but made to
dovetail to a nicety in the grand structure
of Republican clubs organized for the pur
â  pose of giving to the Republican nominee
such a sweeping majority in California as
to leave the word doubtful entirely out of
the question on the morning of Novem
ber 4.
Foremost in the formation of the Mc-
Kinley Club was H. C. Firebaugh, its first
and only president. One of the peculiar
ities of H. C. Firebaugh is that he re
fuses to be led by a time-serving dosb who
has no other interest in the welfare of the
party than his own personal ends. This
he has time and apain demonstrated by
kicking over the boss traces and setting
out a line of policy for himself. Yet,
while so doing his actions have always
been for the advancement of the Repuhli
can party and its nominees. Associated
with him are some of the prominent Re
publicans of that section of the City,
among whom is Albert Stetson, oue of fciau
Francisco's popular young nier, who has
taken quite an interest in Jocal politics.
Oscar Lewis is another of those who pinned
his faith to the elevation of tne man from
Canton. With these are: William B.
Cluff, John S. Daley. H. A. Steffens, A.
M. Hauser, W. R. Nixon, Churles Burdett,
James C. Stevenaon, Thomas R. Knox,
Eli J, Wilkinson, Robert Clark, W. W.
Wade, Captain J. C. Hocjan, Charles H.
Mohr, Henry Gerlach, John Purcell and

PILGRIM OF JESUS
GOING TO CHINA
Father Athanasius Will
Exploit the Province
of Shensi.
SIX TEARS' WORE HERE.
Chinese Mohammedans Threaten
an Invasion of That
Section.
THE MISSION IS DANGEROUS.
He Will Report at Rome First to the
Father-General of the Fran
ciscan Order.
Rev. Father Athanasius, who hÂ«Â»s been
actively connected with St. Boniface
Roman Catholic Church on Golden Gate
avenue for six years, preached a farewell
sermon at high mass yesterday morning.
This church is served by the Franciscan
Fathers.
When a clergyman preaches a farewell
sermon it means that he is going away.
Father Athanasius is going back to China,
leagues into the interior of that strange
country on a mission to carry to and
spread the word of Jesus among the
worshipers of idols and tfce practitioners
of barbarofrs ceremonies.
He will leave this evening and, instead
of sailing direct across the Pacific, wiil
take the overland route, and report first to
the Father-General of the Franciscan
order at Rome.
The dry eyes in the large congregation
yesterday morning were few. Father
Athanasius has labored hard ana faith
fully in San Francisco, and endeared him
self to his parishioners. The scene was
touching. In order that the parting
might not be too emotional, the reverend
father abbreviated his farewell remarks.
Father Athanasius has been in China be
fore. He was in mission work there nine
years before he came to San Francisco.
But death has thinned the ranks of the
forerunners of the gospel among his order
in iar-away China, and as there is now a
vacancy he is called upon to fill it. He
speakÃ the language fluently. The order
has lost eight priests in two years at the
mission to which he is going.
Father Athanasius is going into the
province of Shensi. After he leaves the
steamer at Hankow it will take sixty days'
travel into the interior for him to reach
his station.
The pathway of the Christian mission
ary in China is not one lined with rose 3
and shaded with magnolia blossoms. It
is a pathway of danger from the climate,
danger from the midnight attack and dan
ger from political and relieious insurrec
tions. Father Athanasius knows that he
carries his life in his band when he goes
into the province of Shensi.
Particularly is this true at the present
time. He has two brothers in the work at
the mission where he is going. Last week
he received a letter from one of them
stating that a political rebellion had arisen
among the Chinese Turks, who are follow
ers of Ali and one God in the adjacent
province of Kansou, and adding that they
were expecting an invasion by the Chinese
Mohammedans. It requires over three
months' time for a letter to come to San
Francisco from the Franciscan mission in
Shensi, and by the time Father Athana
sius arrives there the invasion may pre
sent terrors that he knows not of.
QUICK SIGNAL WORK.
Presidio Gunners Who Fired General
Dlmond'g Funeral Salute Informed in
I.ess Than Twenty Seconds.
The simultaneous firing of the guns out
at the Presidio with the departure of the
late General Dimond's funeral train from
Dr. Mackenzie's church has evoked quite a
little curiosity as to how the artillerymen
by the Golden Gate were informed of the
time when the funeral left the church
door.
It seems that the accurately timed sa
luting was the result of a remarkably
quick signal work done by the Signal
Corps of the Second Brigade under Cap
tain G. C. Boardman Jr.
The man with the flag was stationed on
the hill near Davidson's Observatory, at
the comer of Clay and Octavia streets.
Two men were placed in the street to sig
nal round the corners from the church.
As soon as the carriages began leaving
the church the sign was passed to the flag
man on the hill. He signaled to another
post on Pacific Heights, and from there
the signal was sent to the Presidio and
from tbe Presidio to the battery. This
roundabout path was passed over in some

FATHER CARAHER
IS WELCOMED,
Public Reception to the New
Pastor of St. Francis
Parish.
HE THANKS HIS PEOPLE
Company M, League of the Cross
Cadets, Greets Him With
a Rally.
EESENTS BARNES' ATTACK.
The Vigorous Priest Proclaims for
Loyalty r.nd Points a Way for
Catholics.
A public reception was given by the
parishioners of tit. Francis parish yester
day in Washington Hall to the new pas
tor, Rev. Father Caraher, who a week be
fore came from Mission San Jose and as
sumed charge of St. Francis. The meeting
was held under the auspices of Company
M. League of the Cross Cadets, who took
advantage of the occasion to hold one of
their popular rallies.
The spacious hall was crowded with
parishioners and friends of Father Cara
her. The league, the Catholic temperance
organization, was well represented. Rev.
P. O'Ryan, its spiritual director; Thomas
Fallon. its president: N. J. Keogh and
Joseph Murphy of the executive commit
tee and the pastor of the parish occupied
seats on the platform. Company M and
other members of St. Francis pariah
branch were in the front of the ball under
CoQiman<) of Captain T. Dinan and Lieu
tenants P. Quirk and A. Conich.
In opening the exercises ail present sang
the "Veni Creator," after which M. K.
Tupt>le, W. Donovan, Miss Hill, James
O'Donnel), M. T. Dwyer, W. Cadogan and
T. Lyatt entertained the audience. "Amer
ica" and the "Te Deura'' were also sung.
When the chairman of the meeting, W.
J. Keogh, introduced the Rev. Father
Caraoer as the new pastor of St. Francis
parish the audience gave evidence of their
love and esteem for their new spiritual ad
viser by prolonged applause.
Father Caraher said:
"It is impossible for me fully to ex
press the pleasure it gives me to appear
before you this afternoon. I see here
ladies and gentlemen who have not for
gotten me. I need no introduction guide
or map to direct me when I face North
Beach. I have been with you before and
lam with you again. LiKe William Tell
when he returned to his home, he raised
his hands and said to the crags and cliffs
of his youth, '1 raise my hands to wel
come you and to show you that I have
thouehtof you when absent.' And so it
is with me. I raise my hand to show you
that I have not forgotten you when ab
sent, and to signify my pleasure to be
with you once more."
He spoke feelingly and kindly to the
members of the League of the Cross, who,
he said, had been organized to spread the
cause of temperance over the land. This
they have done and he hoped they would
continue to do so as long as they lived.
After exhorting them to continue in this
good work and remain "firm and devoted
members of the church he paid his re
epects to the A. P. A.'s. He characterized
that society as "Canadian curs and Bashi
Bazouks from Belfast who are trying to
stir up strife between American citizens."
"It is also the duty of the cadets to de
fend this Republic with their lives," con
tinued the pastor. '-It was partly carved
out by aid of Catholic swords and largely
brought to its present grandeur and prom
inence by Catholic energy and industry.
"The A. P. A. is misnamed. It should
be called the Aaron Burr Association.
The power that strangled that traitor
should strangle this, and it is the duty of
Catholics to strangle treason wherever it
is found.
"I see by the papers that General Barnes
has made an onslaught on the League of
the Cross. This Barnes is, no doubt, of
the same stripe of generals as General
Morgan, whom Father Yorke has flayed
alive. No doubt they both belong to the
Captain-JinKs-of-the-Horse-Marines class.
"This General Barnes did a noble thing
when he turned his back on the field of
battle and returned to the Pacific Coast,
where there was no fighting.
"He has seen fit to condemn the League
of the Cross because its , caoets bear arms,
but he has not one word to say against the
Junior Order of American Mechanics, w.bo
not long since marched into a Protestant
Church in Oakland and stacked their arms
in the church. But this dribbling from
anti-Catholics will have no effect on the
cadets of the League of the Cross. You
will go on unchecked, notwithstanding
what those patriotic heroes who ran away
from the field of battle may say about you.
It is your duty to defend and protect this
Republic and hand it down to posterity
as you got it from the great and glorious
George Washington
"I love this country as a Catholic and as
a priest. There is no other country on
earth that givis the same liberty of reli
gion ; liberty to the priest and to the peo
ple. 0, Columbus, I love thee for the
blessings thou hast bestowed upon the hu
man family."
He thanked his parishioners for the re
ception given him and urged the parents
to encourage their children to join the
League of the Cross in the interest of tem
perance. ____________

A GAIN FOR BENICIA.

Field Sports at Fort Mason â The
Coming Retire*
meats.
Cariosity is rife in United States army
circles to ascertai n the names of officers
recom trended for retirement under the
recent circular of the Secretary of War, ask
ing for tne names of officers who are physi
cally unable to perform active service in
the field.
It is known that Colonel Crofton, Fif
teenth Infantry, heads the list. He re
reents the recommendation and is in
clined to offer resistance on the ground
that personal prejudice against him was
at the bottom of the report. Other officers
on the list are Colonel Bradford, Seven
teenth Infantry; Major John G. Turnbull
and Lieutenant J. S. Oyster, First Artil
lery; Captain Thomas G. Townsend, Sixth
Cavalry, and Captain Henry Romeyn,
Fifth Infantry.
The Army and Navy Register of Wash
ington, D. C, is authority for this para
graph:
"It is learned at the War Department
that certainly two, and possibly three,
officers of the Fifth Artillery, have been
recommended for retirement."
Some weeks ago The Call published
news to the same" effect as the above con
cerning retirements in the Fifth Artillery,
and the publication caused a lively com
motion and some vigorous denial at the
Presidio.
The War Department has practically
decided the question of changes of station.
The Fifth Artillery of this department
wfll not go south or leave here at all, and
the First Infantry will not go further than
Benicia.
Quite a sum of money reserved for the
transportation of troops will, it is said, be
expended at Benicia in making improve
ments to accommodate the First Infaniry.
The plans of the department, so far as can
be ascertained, are to abandon the post at
Angel Island and make Benicia an im
portant station. The changing of the
headquarters of the First Infantry from
Angel Island to Benicia has been agreed
upon.
The changes to be made in other depart
ments will send the Second Infantry from
Omaha to posts in the Department of Da
kota. The Twenty-second Infantry, in
stead of going to Omaha, will go to Fort
Crook, Nebr. Two companies of the
Eleventh Infantry, now at Fort Whipple,
will go to the new post at Little Rock,
Ark. This post has not yet been named,
but will be christened in honor of some
distinguished army officer.
On May 26 last General Forsyth, com
manding the Department of California,
issued General Orders No. 4, encouraging
and announcing athletic games and field
sports.
At Fort Mason, Captain Vogdes, com
manding, there were interesting contests
on June 26. Records were not broken, but
a good showing was made. Following is
a summary of the events:

SOMETHING NEW TO SMOKE.
Cigarettes Made of Tea to Be Intro-
duced in England.
It appears, according to the gossip of
high society, that we are soon to witness
the introduction of a strange fashion,
which is now conquering London, and
which, according to the tradition of Pa
risian high life, will soon be adopted
there.
We refer to the custom of smoking cig
arettes in which tea is substituted for
tobacco. It was the high-toned Jadiesof
this country that invented the new luxury,
of which they are passionately fond, and
tea-cigarettes are now not only to t>e had
in certain establishments in London, but
they are smoked in a new and fashionable
club just established in Kensington, in
which tobacco is tabooed.
We must admit that the fashion in
question, however extraordinary it may
appear at first sight, may have some good
in it.
At the present time it is customary after
dinner for the gentlemen to desert the
ladies en masse, in order to enjoy their
cigars, while the hostess and her lady
guests, completely forsaken, remain in
waiting until it pleases the guests of the
homely sex to rejoin them, and this, we
must say to the shame of the nineteenth
century gallantry, generally happens very
late. â Pearson's WeeKly.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1896.
THE BEST AND
GREATEST BOOK,
It Is the Bible, Which Is
Also the Most
Abused.
OFTEN MISCONSTRUED.
A Textbook of Human Life,
Teaching Men How to Live
and Die.
WHY IT SHOULD BE STUDIED.
An Able Sunday Evening Lecture by
. the Rev. G F Hall of De-
catur, Illinois.
The congregation of the First Christian
Church on Twelfth street was addressed
last evening by the Rev. George F. Hall of
Decatur, 111. The discourse was preceded
Rev. George F. Hall, the Celebrated Pnlpit Orator Who Preached Yesterday at
the First Christian Church on Twelfth Street.
by a prayer and reading from the Scrip
ture, by tbe Rev. Dr. Wickham of Port
land, Or. The topic chosen by Dr. Hall
was "The Greatest Book in the World."
"The oldest, the best and the greatest
book in the world," he said, "is tbe Bible,
and yet it is the most abused. I take my
text this evening from the second chapter
of Timothy, fifteenth verse, 'Show thyself
approved unto God.'
"It matters not if we please men, so long
as we make our lives acceptable to God.
We are apt to misconstrue and misapply
the word of God. To save ourselves from
falling into these errors, let us read and
study the good book. It is the basis of all
true Christianity, and should be ap
proached in the same spirit that we ap
proach other books. It tells us how to
live and how to die. It is the great text
book of human life.
"With all its greatness, it is still com
paratively simple and easy of comprehen
sion. It is its own interpreter and farjtoo
sacred to be used for no other purpose
than to sit upon or as a receptacle for
chattel mortgages, etc. It should be read
and studied thoughtfully, and not in a
desultory, superficial way.
"The Bible is often misinterpreted by
picking out a verse here and a verse there
and then joining the two together. In
this way you can prove, seemingly, any
thing which you desire. 'Judas went and
handed himself,' 'Go, thou, and do like
wise'âthey might be cited as a justifica
tion of suicide.
"Preachers make a serious mistake in
applying the old laws of Moses to the
present generation. It cannot be done
logically. When God said, 'Remember the
Sabbath day and keep it holy,' he meant
it only for the Jews. Science has never
yet gone far; her in explaining the mys
tery of creation than the first verse of
Genesis, where we are told that 'God
created heaven and earth.' Ido not be
lieve in the six days' theory, but hold
that each day was equivalent to a great
period.
"What grand characters we see in tbe
Bible! There is Moses, the chosen leader
of the children of Israel, and Joshua, who
bade the sun to stand still. The thirty
nine books of the Old and the twenty
seven booKs of the New Testament are
replete with poetry, wisdom and pathos.
The Acts of the Apostles is one of the
most important and at the same time one
of the most neglected books. In the book
of Revelations, we catch a glimpse of
heaven. Ii is just as requisite for us to
live Christians as it is fur us to become
Christians. What we need most to-day is
light, more light, and I know of no better
way to get it than by a careful study of
the Bible."
CIVIL ENGINEERS HERE.

Professor Joseoh" Le Conte, the great
scientist, is a member of the society, but
George Morse, engineer of the Memphis
bridge ana of several bridges on the Miss

members.
REV, PUTNAM'S MISSION,
The Well - Kncwn Christian
Church Evangelist Is in
the City.
By the Strength of His Personal Mag
netism He Carries en the Work
of the Master.
Rev. Melvln Putnam, an evangelist of
the Christian church, held forth last even
ing in the West Side Christian Church, on
Bush street, near Devisadero. The con
gregation was large, in fact the little
church was almost filled, for the pastor's
reputation as an enthusiastic worker in
the cause of Christianity had preceded
him many months.
Rev. Mr. Putnam's theme was "A
Friend to Christ," and he had not pro
ceeded far in his discourse before he was
thoroughly in touch with his people, and
the audience was in sympathy with him.
Therein lies his success, for tbe evangelist
is known to be a man of great magnetic
presence. Rev. Mr. Putnam is a young
man with a smooth-snaven face, a iindly
eye and a low, persuasive voice when in
ordinary conversation. But when ad
dressing his congregation the speaker
hurls with strong voice and great force the
facts that he believes to be truths.
The new pastor is one of the best-known
in the Christian church of any in the
United States. He hails from Ontario
and has been six years in the ministry.
From the start he entered upon evangelical
work, and held numerous protracted meet
ings in various parts of the country, nota
bly some in Nebraska, where he built
three churches. His longest stay in one
place was the past two years that he pre
sided as pastor over the Highlands Chris
tian Church of Denver.
"Mr. Putnam arrived in this City last
Thursday, 1 ' said D. F. Parker, one of
the prominent members of the church,
last evening. "He is the very man we
want here. His personal magnetism car
ries everything before him. It seems to
be his mission to draw people together in
the cause, and in bis career he has estab
lished a number of large churches with a
good support. Money is no object, with
him, for he frequently leaves a good-pay
ing church for one where his services are
needed the more but where the pay is none
the best."
The evangelist last evening stated that
be will continue the meetings every even
ing for some lime to come. How long he
will remain he has not yet determined.
A LIGHTNING STROKE.
A German Estimate* the Force of One
in Bom-power Measure.
It is no doubt interesting to express the
force of a stroke of lightning in horse
power, says a writer in a German review.
During a recent storm which passed over
Klausthal, Germany, a bolt struck a
wooden column in a dwelling and in the
top of this column were two wire nails
one-sixth of an inch in diameter.
To melt iron in this short time would be
impossible in the largest furnace now in
existence, and it could only be accom
plished with the ail of electricity, but a
current of 200 amperes and a potential of
20,000 volts would be necessary. This elec
tric force for one second represents 5000
horsepower, but as the lightning accom
plished the melting in considerably less
timeâ say one- tenth of a secondâ it follows
that the bolt was 50,000 horsepower.
CONVENTION OF
CITY SOCIALISTS.
Active Preparations for
Holding One Here in
July.
DISTRICT ORGANIZATION
It Will Begin Monday and Be
Continued Energeti
cally.
HEADQUARTERS ESTABLISHED.
An Energetic Campaign to be Carried
On Through City and State to
â¦the Polls.
The socialists of San Francisco are ac
tively engaged in arranging the prelimi
naries for a political campaign in every
Assembly district. While they do not
look for success, so far as the election of
municipal officials is concerned, they are
none the less enthusiastic and earnest
over the struggle.
"Onr movement," said one of the officers'
yesterday, "is one that in its history has
never gone backward, but always onward.
And as it goes it increases in volume
and force like an avalanche. So if
there be no possibility of winning
now we know that the socialists will
poll a very large vote in California. Our
sympathizers are increasing in number
continually. What is going to happen
in tne near future will be interesting,
however."
The Municipal Socialist Convention will
be held in San Francisco July 29. About
the same date the State Convention will
take place in this City.
Already the Socialist Labor party is or
ganizing and getting ready for these meet
ings. Headquarters have been secured at
28 Ellis street, and the party's officers are
making it ready for the work that will
soon be transacted there. Suitable furni
ture, desks and large quantities of social
istic literature will be in the new rooms,
and every stranger seeking knowledge of
socialism will be welcome there.
At present there are five vigorous
branches in San Francisco with a total
active and subscribing membership of
1100. They are the American, Liberty,
Prench, Jewish and German branches.
The Jewish and German Dranches meet in
their headquarters at 948 Folsorn street,
between Filth and Sixth.
This â¢ evening thes>e two important
clubs will be disbanded and in their
place will be organized the Thirty-second
Assembly District Club of the Socialist
Labor party.
This will mark the beginning of the new
organization, immediately thereafter tne
other branches will disappear, to be suc
ceeded by district clubs aa part of the gen
eral city organization, which is to be
thorough from one end of town to the
other. The progress of the worK of or
ganizing is said to depend largely on Chief
Organizer Seller. He has appointed E. D.
Kingsley deputy organizer, and stated
that as fast as possible the construction of
the Socialist party in this city will be car
ried forward during the campaign.
Meetings will be held on street corners
every evening. The first one took place at
Pine and Kearny streets Saturday night and
another held at 2 p. m. yesterday at Mar
ket street and Grant avenue. Certain
places for holding these open-air meetings
will be selected within a week.
Incidentally the socialists will take ad
vantage of the Fourth of July parade to
show their loyalty and their strength.
Every member of San Francisco, Oakland
and possibly San Jose will be in line, so
that at least 1000 socialists will show the
people how their cult is growing.
Tbe City organization will be similar to
that of the other political parties, and a
central body will be elected at the con
vention with tbe State and municipal
nominees. This central or executive
council will, in conjunction with the dis
trict clubs, manage the campaign.
The Society of American Socialists has
disbanded and its leader, Morrison I.
Swift, gone East. Its members have
joined the Socialist Labor party. The
Central Trade and Labor Alliance has
indorsed the party's platform, giving still
greater influence to the movement.
At a meeting of this society at 102 O'Far
rell street Friday night, a full attendance
of delegates were present. After
receiving progressive reports from
the organizing and executive com
mittees, the reports of Carpenters'
Union 304, Amalgamated Woodworkers'
Union and the Confectioners' Union 42,
adopting the constitution of the Socialist
Trade and Labor Alliance of the United
States and Canada, were received.
The ailiance having received an affirm
ative reply to the same effect from all its
constituent unions, it was moved and car
ried unanimously that the alliance affiliate
with the Socialist Trade Alliance of the
United States and Canada, and the corre
sponding secretary was directed to apply
for a charter from that body.
An invitation to participate with the
members of the Socialist Labor party in the
exercises and parade on July 4 was re
ceived and accepted, and the secretary
was directed to notify all the unions rep
resented in the alliance and request their
attendance in the parade in a body. '
A committee on by-laws was elected to
draw up rules for the government of the
alliance under its new charter.
Theodore Lynch was elected recording
secretary of the alliance by acclamation.
Other officers will be appointed at the
next meeting, Friday, Juiy 3.

If you buy an ' Electric Belt it is cer-

which has built up a reputation by its

that has cured others is most likely to

more than those whose reputation is built

Here are a few of our late reports from
patients:
"I have suffered from Lumbago and Sciatica
for thirty years. I have tried many remedies
without avail, and have been laid up at differ- j
ent times with my trouble.* After all else i
failed I got your Belt two months ago, and it I
has cured me," writes HUGH FRASSR, ex-
royal deputy Scottish Clans of California, 2063
Encinal avenue, Alameda, Cal.
"I was greatly troubled with Indigestion
and Nervous Debility, and could not sleep at
night. 1 have used your Belt just thirty days,
and I can now eat food which I thought I
would never be able to touch again. My sleep
Is sound, and I am refreshed in the morning."
C. F. ANDERSON, with Ballard & Hall, Fifth
and Britnnan streets, San Francisco.
"I bought one of your Belts five years ago in
Minneapolis for Lumbago. I have used it for
that and other troubles, and it has done won-
ders for me." M. F. ROGERS, Veterans' Home,
Yountville, Napa County, Cal. >â¢;
"I bought your belt six months ago for Ner-
vous Debility and kidney trouble. I used the
Belt about two weeks, and in that short time
the nervous weakness and brain-weariness had
almost entirely ceased, and I gained fast in
weight. I now recommend your Belt highly,
as it will do all you Claim.' E. A. SHANNON,
507 Montgomery street, San Francisco.
"I suffered from Seminal Weakness for
years and spent hundreds of dollars doctoring,
but got no benefit till I got your Belt, and it
has cured' me after wearing it six weeks."
F. B. GALLOWAY. Densmore, Cal.
"I bought your Belt just a week aaro for lame
back and female troubles. I was confined to
my bed most of the time. Immediately upon
applying it I found myself growing stronger.
I now feel like a different woman, ana owe it
all to your Belt. I have used a great deal of
medicine, but I can truthfully say that your
Beit surpasses anything I nave ever tried."
MRS. P. M. NEHBEL, 1206 Trenton street,
Los Angeles, Cal.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt has done a
great deal of good work in this country.
Its cures give it the reputation it has. If
you want an Electric Beit and want one

ON THE A, P, A,
He Springs a Surprise on
the Good Citizenship
Meeting.
CRITICISED THE ORDER.
The Oakland Orator Pronounces
the Association's Prac
tices Damnable.
AFPROVES THEIR PRINCIPLES.
Davis Says the Organization Shou'd
Broaden Its Views of Its Mis
sion to Humanity.
Edwards Davis, the Oakland orator who
has achieved local celebrity as the "actor
prpacher," addressed the Good Citizenship
meeting yesterday afternoon. It was not
such an address as is ordinarily heard from
the rostrum of the Temple Sunday after
noon. His remarks were an undoubted
surprise to the committee which had in
vited him as well as to the audience; yet
the latter maintained its good humor, and
even when the orator declared in dramatic
tones, "The practices of your association
are damnable." there was no demonstra
tion except faint applause.
As a prelude to his remarks Mr. Davis
said that he had intended to say some o
the things he was about to utter the Sun
day previous, but if he had done so he
probably would not have an opportunity
to appear yesterday. After dilating upon
the spirit of discovery which has ani
mated all people, he said:
"There have been various and frequent
attempts to discover New America. These
wouki-be discoverers have all been
wrecked in unseen shoals, and this wrecfc
will come to you, except by one means,
wbicli will be told to you. You will re
member that a few years ago the Grangers
came into existence and attempted to
soothe the hearts of the people. Then
came the labor organizations. But, oh,
ye men whose hands are hardened by loyal
toil, 1 ask you to look back upon your
disappointments and failures â not be
cause of anything wrong with your mo
tives, but because of the untruth and
treachery of the labor leaders.
"Then comes along in splendid propor
tion the organization to which I have
been invited to speak this afternoon, the
American Protective Association. The
question, then, is whether you will be but
another instance of wreckage or whether
you will learn in time.
"The thirteen principles of your or
ganization meet my heartiest approval â
[Applause]â but â you see I conclude with
the ever-potent 'but' â the practices of
your association are damnable. [Faint
applause.] That's right; applaud. 1 will
expect you to applaud more before I am
through.
"I think you have too much appreci
ated the principles of your association
und have overlooked the groat principles*
of human love. What difference does it
make to you to-day whether the A. P. A.
is knocked into annihilation if America
stands? I hope to God that there is not
one of you here to-day who is not less a
member of this society than he is a citizen
of this country. As you have made the
mistake, so has the entire Protestant
ctiurcu. Because Luther in the olden
times started the Protestant movement
by protesting against the iniquities of the
Roman Catholic church is no reason wny
our leaders tn-day should spend their
time rebuking evil rather than establish
ing the truth.
"It is not so much the question 'What is
the iniquity in the church you oppose,'
but 'W hat is the righteousness in your
own.' Because men who are in high places
have fallen that does not mean that there
is not enthroned in the ideals of others the
Christ that was crucified. Wherever the
Roman Catholic church is concerned I am
its enemy. Wherever there is iniquity in
the Protestant church I am doubly its
enemy.
"Because of the enlightenment of the
Protestant church, if its idols shall fall,
then where is the hope in our civilization?
I have a book in my possession containing
accounts of crimes of 600u ministers. I be
lieve that when the minister of the Chris
tian church at large shall rather be a noble
man than a doctor of divinity then will the
president of the university grant that
highest degree â eternal life.
"Uretbern this a mournful state of af
fairs, but it is natural. You must make
the individual believe that he is the unit
of society. He must understand that he
must be himself purified. It makes no
difference to me that one who brought me
the gospel has fallen from grace. He can
not take from me the infinitude of truth.
If one of our Federal officials or one of our
high ecclesiastics shall fall, yet the state
and the church shall stand. What does
one renepade, one backslider count when
in the world to-day nominally 500,000,000
stand for righteousness? The world tlien
need not feel discouraged and feel that it
is to fail because of one little one.
"It is enough to make a preacher swear
this afternoon to think of all the iniquity
that is in this church, and in the Catholic
church and in all the world. Yet that is
not enough to make me forsake my post.
When half the world shall turn traitors
and renegades, yet will it be saved by the
other half. Let us be, as it were, merely
the humble instruments Of that God in
bringing about that salvation.
"There are a few things tnat I want to
criticise this afternoon that will enable
our people to see the new America. You
needn't talk about thirteen principles and
thirty-seven article?. There is only one
God and hÂ« is infinite, and there is only
one principle and tnat is truth.
"The Prohibition party, instead of being
the opponent of whisky, should be the
opponent of all poisonous stuffs, and the
A. P. A., rather than the opponent of the
Roman Catholic Church, should be the
opponent of all iniquity. My God didn't
come to save Israel or to save the Jews,
but to save the world.
"I want to impress upon you that you
want to broaden your view of your prin
ciples. They are broader than you think.
I asK you, Is it any better to have a Pope
in Rome than to have one in America? I
ask you, Is it any better to overthrow the
church of Rome and allow to arise on its
ruins an organization having wUhin it an
ecclesiastic-ism that isdamnable?
"There are men in your society who are
scoundrels. Your organization is as cor
rupt as any in existence. I claim there is
corruption constantly in the work. I
claim that wherever iniquity is found if
tbere is to be peace to you it will be by
forgetting all associations and pleasant
memories and making some men outcasts.
"1 proclaim I am your enemy forever
until there shall come to you a realization
of the individual rather than the social
idea. I come to you to l?t yon know that
there it one man willing to condemn the
Roman Catholic Church and every church
in Christendom and your society, not to
your back but to your face. It is my plea
to you that you broaden your idea of the
humanity of man. You mu3t understand
that you are your brother's keeper.
"In the battle of the world let me not
have one enemy, but let me uosheath my
sword and slash down everyone who
speaks against my God, my church, niy
flap, my country, my home and myself."
The speaker was generously applauded,
and at the conclusion of his remarks Chair
man Quitzow made a brief address thanlc
ing Mr. Davis, and saying the organization
was willing to listen 10 criticism lrom any
true American.

ALMOST BOUNDERED.
Startling Kxperience of the British Ship
Carondelet Off the Coast.
The British ship Carondelet arrived yes
terday morninc. S6 days from Newcastle,
N. S. W. The trip was extremely pieasant
until the vessel reached a point a short
distance off the coast, almost opposite this
port, when she was struck by a squall that
nearly proved her destruction.
The squall struck the vessel so quickly
that there was no time to take in sail and
in consequence a large lot of the canvas
was ripped off the yards like so much
calico. The vessel was thrown on her
beam ends and it was only with the very
greatest effort that she was saved.
For the Lawyer.
The nncle of Sepp, Michael and Hanna
is dead. The untutored gentlemen are
called to the notary's office. The notary
says, "After deducting 2500 marks for legal
expenses each of you will get 12,200
marks.
Seppâ Gee, whiz! Twenty-five hundred
marks for leual expenses! Say, are you
one of the heirs?â From the French.
CRICKET ACROSS THE BAY
The Alamedas Defeat the Pacific
Eleven With Hands
Down.
Two very decisive cricket matches for
the Hunter-Harrison cup were played yes
terday.
At Alameda the Pacifies, who have
hitherto kept first place in the contest!
were beaten by the Alameda team by 130
runs in the first innines.
Going first to bat, the Pacifies compiled
the lowly total of 43.
G. B. Wise and J. A. Harbour were tne
only contributors to this little tDtal worthy
of mention. Ward Jr. bowled in his best
form, taking five wickets for two dozen
runs, and Sioman did almost as well at
tbe other end.
Then the Alamedas took the pitch, their
captain, the veteran Hogue, leading the
ball with a neatly compiled half century.
Randall and Teddy Hood seconded his
eflorts nobly, Anderson and Ward Jr. also
doing excellent v.ork. Five bowlers were
put on by the Pacific's captain, but their
united efforts did not prevent defeat.
In the second innings, played to kiil
time, the Pacifies, thanks principally to
Harbour, put together 4S runs for six
wickets.
It is the first signal cefeat suffered by
the Pacifies this season. Following are
the full scores:

At Golden Gate the Bohemians played
the Californias and came off victorious
by 33 runs.
For ihe former team Doc Bowhill, Rey
nolds and McCrae did yeomen service,
and had not their captain, William Rob
ertson, succumbed to a tempting ball of
Guild's, the total of 106 might have been
doubled. As it was, the score was ample,
for the Californias were dismissed for 73,
Townsley. Guild and Croll doing most of
the batting. As will be seen by the ap

Fewer Questions JL>c*ired.
Before Whitelaw Reid became Minister
to France he devoted a good deal of his
time to the conduct of his paper, the
Tribune, The copy editors who DUt up
the headlines of stories of the day fell into
the habit of making most of them inter
rogative, as, for instance, "Was It Murder
or Suicide?" or "Did She Kill Him for
Love?" or "Will the President Sign It?"
etc.
The whole paper was speckled with in
terrogative points. The thing had been
going for weeks, according to the Mercury,
till one day a postal arrived, addressed to
Mr. Reid, and marsed personal. It read
as follows:
"I'm getting awful tired of your ques
tions. Wny don't you find out someting?
A great newsuaper is supposed to know
everything, and ought not to annoy its
readers with needles inquiries. This
morning you ask: 'Will Mr. Platt Con
sent?' How the hâl do I know?"
That night an order came that the Trib
une must ask fewer questions.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUKE 29, 1896.
A NEW ARRIVAL
AT THE PARK,
The Baby Elk That At
tracts Thousands of
Curious People.
THE WATER SUPPLY.
What It Costs to Obtain It and
the Amount Saved to
the Taxpayers.
FORESTS ON BERNAL HEIGHTS.
Attractions at Sutroville by the S?a.
Preparations for a Water
Carnival.
The thousands who visited Golden Gate
Park yesterday were made aware of the
fact that there had been an increase in the
famiiy of animals that are kept within
the inclosures, and all who heard of it
crowded around the fence of the deer glen
to obtain a view of the baby elk that first
saw the light of day last Friday. The
little fellow was quite frisky for one so
young, and when crowd after crowd had
viewed the new arrival they turned to
otner wonders to be seen in the great park.
The notice in The Call a few days ago
drawing attention to the fact that there
was great delay in replacing the convict
dressed pedestal on which is to be shown
the bust of General Grant, awakened the
memorial committee to action, and during
the week not only has the pedastal been
put in position, but the bust has been
pieced where it is to rest for ages to come.
This, however, is to be hidden from view
by a great white cloth and will remain
there until the committee announces that
it is ready to unveil It. The monument
occupies the site of the one that was re
moved, just north of the north end of the
grand court and diagonally opposite the
Park museum.
"Is this artesian-well water from the
park or is it Spring Valley?" asked Com
missioner Kosenfeld of Superintendent
McLaren, pointing to a faucet in the new
lodge.
"From our own water works, lr was the
reply.
This question and answer brought out
the fact that the park is supplied by six
F. W. Smith, Who Is Looking for Special Features for tho Big Fruit and Mineral
Fair to Be Ueld in Spokane. Mr. Smith Is 6 Feet 6 Inches in Height, Weighs
265 Pounds, and Proudly Asserts Tbat He Is a Californian by Birth.
artesian wells, which supply the pumping
worHs south of the south drive, and that
the water supply costs a little less than
$5000 a year.
"If we purchased the water from Spring
Valley," said the superintendent, "it
would cost 30 cents a thousand gallons,
and as we use 60,000 gallons of water an
hour, twelve hours a day. it would amount
to a large sum annually."
Tben be went to work with pencil and
paper and in a few moments added:
"If we purchased from Spring Valley
we would use the quantity of water I have
just named for eight months in the year,
and the cost would for that period be
$ r )0,840, so we save quite a neat little sum
to the tnxnayers."
Dwelling upon the grand view that is
obtained from the porch of the new lodge,
Superintendent McLaren said, in direct
ing attention to the barrenness of the Ber
nal Heights: "It is astonishing that the
owners of the property on those hills have
not set out trees, as did Actolph .Sutro on
his property right opposite. It would
cost but very little, require no care, and in
a short time produce a forest similar to
that on Sutro's land. In ten years those
hills would be covered with trees, which
would enhance the value of the prop
erty, improve the beauty of scenery and
act as a great windbreak. Maybe some
time those interested may do that.
"What the authorities ought to do,"
continued the superintendent, "and that
before the price of land gets high, is to se
cure a large tract for tiie benefit of the
Mission people, for this park is too far
away. The securing of park sites is oc
cupying the attention of the authorities of
many Eastern cities, for they must have
parks for the people. In New Y T ork City
the authorities tore away four blocKs of
buildings to make way for a people's part,
if our people here do not atiend to such
matters while it is yet time, they will have
to do so in the future and pay high for the
delay."
Sutroville by the bea had its share of
visitors yesterday, and they amused them
selves watching tne waves and the seals,
and spent some time at the many attrac
tions that have been established there.
"This," said an Eastern man here on a
visit, "reminds me of Coney Island beach
on a very small scale: that is, outside the
baths. Coney Island is not in it with your
baths."
The crowd in the baths was large, and
with considerable interest they watched
the racee, diving, the clown of dwarfish
stature on the platform and in the
water and other specialties. Dana
Thompson, the water-wonder, has gone to
Seattle, and his place is being filled by
young Cornell, who performs Thompson's
trick of remainin r under water for several
minutes. Yesterday he remained out of
sight seven minutes, and came up as
fresh as when he went in, despite tr-e fact
that he had been in saltwater. Colonel
Robinson says: "This man goes in the
water, remains out of sight many minutes,
but it's all an illusionâ a triek â and I'd
like to have somebody tell me how it's
done."
On the Fourth of July there will be a
grand carnival in the big tank in imita
tion of the one given at Santa Cruz. A
number of carpenters and artisans are at
work building floats and gondoias, in one
of which will ride the Water Queen and
her maids, and this queen is a belle of the
Richmond district. In one of the gondo
las there will be a mandolin club of young
ladies, "and, by the way," remarked
Colonel Robinson, "we will do as the New
York Alderman once said, 'have a maie
and a female gondola.' "
Within a few days Professor Raymous, a
first-class swimmer, will make a higb dive
from the upper porch of the Cliff House
into the ocean. The dive will be eighty
nine feet.
Herman Vogel of 721 Linden avenue,
aged about 18 years, was a passenger on
eastbound train 1 of the Park and Ocean
line late yesterday afternoon, and when
on H street, near First avenue, he at
tempted to jump off as he had seen others
do, but was not so fortunate, for he fell
and injured his fuce and head. He was
picked up by Special Officer Herve, and
assisted to the train, which stopped and
backed. He was conveyed to the Stanyan
street depot, and irom there to the Re
ceiving Hospital.
Yesterday's Alarms.
An alarm was sounded from box 61 at 2:50
p. m. yesterday for a lire In Mrs. I. Schwartz's
dressmaking establishment, 342 Third street.
The cause of the blaze, which damaged the
building to the extent of $100, Is unknown.
The alarm from box t55 at 6 P. m. was for a
small blaze caused by flying sparks on the
roof of a two-story dwelling-house occupied
by Mrs. A. Griffiths at 5G3 Minna street. The
damage was nominal.
WILL HAVE A BIG FAIR,
Spokane to Display All the
Products of the State of
Washington.
Manager Smith Tells of the Benefits
to Be Derived From the
Enterprise.
Spokane, Wash., is to have a great fruit
fair and mineral aisplay from October G to
17, and F. W. Smith, the manager and
secretary for the community enterprise,
has been in town for several days making
arrangements for additional attractions.
Mr. Smith in appearance is something
of an advertisement of the growth and
prosperity of the country he represents,
for he is 6 feet 6 inches in height, and,
without being at all fleshy, weighs 265
pounds.
"I am a California boy," said he with
pride as he stood in the court of the
Palace and expanded a chest that must
have measured over four feet, "for I was
born at Coloma, up near where the first
gold was discovered. My father, Levi
Smith, was a '49er and planted the first
peach orchard in California, so I guess I
come by this fruit fair business honestly.
"This will be the third annual fruit fair,
and we fully expect an attendance of over
100,000. Last year's fair was such a success
that the merchants have raised $5000 to pro
mote the enterprise this fall. 'Â£ne rail
roads â the Northern, the Great Northern
and the Union Pacific â have iriven a cent
a-mile rate from all points in Washington,
Oregon, Idaho and Montana to the fair.
Now that is an unusually low rate, and the
result will be that the people from 300 to 500
miles from Spokane will come to the fair
with their faimlies.
"Last year the paid admissions to the
fruit fair were 51,000, and it was estimated
that $250,000 In outside money entered
business channels in the city as a result.
"In connection with this year's fruit dis
play from Washington, Oregon, Idaho and
Montana, for whicii $1500 in cash prizes
will be awarded, there is to be an exhibit
of ores from all the mining sections of the
Northwest. It will be one of the largest if
not the most complete collection of ores
ever seen in America, for there is an enor
mous mining country tributary to Spo
kane â whicii is a center for all that great
British Columbia mining region â the Slo
can district and the Trail Creek country.
"Spokane is growing faster than people
know. In the last year its population has
increased 3000, and tbere are now close
onto 40,000 people there. Montana mining
men predict that it will be a second Den
ver inside of five years. Besides the mines
that are proving such a benefit to business
in Spokane, there is a big farming country,
and right at the town there is a water
power that rivals that at Minneapolis,
"Flourmills now turn out 1300 barrels a
day, and another mill is being built to
turn out 1000 barrels a day. It is bound
to be a milling center. We are getting
into the foreign markets with our flour,
too. Nearly every steamer carries a ship
ment for China and Japan.
"We are trying to get a railroad rate
from California points during the fruit
fair, for there are to be two weeks of races,
and California and Montana horses will
compete.
"The Northwest Mining Association
will meet at Spokane during the fair, and
October 7 will be miners' day. A thousand
dollars for prizes is to be contributed by
miners for double and single handed drill
ing contests, and a drilling contest is the
miner's delight."
REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
A Number of Sales of Medium-
Priced Property Re
ported.
BUSINESS, HOWEVER, IS DULL.
A Review of the Records for the Week
and Miscellaneous Notes of
Intereit
The interest manifested in the auction
sale of a portion of the Murphy ranch, re
ported in The Call of yesterday, should
be encouraging to dealers in country lands.
The attendance at the sale was very large
and the prices realized for the lands were
very good.
The market in the city remains un
changed. There are but few sales being
made and it is not expected that there
will be much if any improvement until
fall. The scare over the proposed big tax
levy has about subsided and a menace to
the market is not looked for now from
this quarter. The fact, however, that it is
presidential election year is not calculated
to help matters much, even with tiie com
ing of. the fall season, and in consequence
there may not be any marked revival in
the market until next year. Values are so
low, however, that the few wise ones who
buy now will reap tbe reward of their fore
sight when the market again assumes an
upward turn.
Building operations are also quiet.
There are a number of large structures
going up about town, and when building
contracts for these are filed from time to
time it causes the aggregate to assume
very respectable proportions. But an analyses
of the contracts filed since January 1 shows
that the number of dwellings, flats and busi
ness structures of moderate cost that have
been erected and contracted for since that
date is comparatively small. It is extensive
building operations on a small scale that
creates activity among the building trades,
anil it will require a revival in the real estate
market before there will be a renewal of
building operations in the way of the erection
of moderate-priced structures.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.
Shainwald, Buckbee & Co. are preparing a

made arrangements with several very heavy
capitalists, as well as with some corporations,
who are making loans on â _ mortgages. . They
propose to negotiate loans on property at the
ruling rates of interest. The success of the
other branches of their business assures the
success of the new department. G. D. Shad

CLERKS TAKE BECREATION
A Most Ecjoyable Day Spent
Yesterday at Glen
Ellen.
Half the Proceeds to Go to the Sur
vivors of the Fifth-Street
Disaster.
The retail clerks of this City had a
delightful day of recreation from business
cares yesterday at their picnic at Glen
Ellen. Several hundred clerks and their
friends took advantage of the picnic rates
and enjoyed a day's noliday among the
Sonoma redwoods. The almost perfect
summer weather which prevailed through
the day made the outing a particular'y
enjoyable one to the salesmen and sales
women who had almost forgotten what
sunshine is during the recent foggy
weather in this City.
Messrs. Morris and Louis Metzger were
among the most active in making ar
rangements for the outing. In making
the elaborate preparations for the picnic
they were ably assisted by the following,
who served on various committees:
H. Friedlander, B. P. McDonough, D. J.
Sheehan, J. Adler, M. J. Gildea, W. Hall,
Frank Condon, W. J. Ahem, G. E. Rrss,
Milton Hart, Miss Rosie Jacobs, Miss
Alice Edwarls, Miss Page, L. Kuttner, J.
Backman, Miss A. M. Laurie, MissÃianey,
Miss Lulu Pyat, Martin Erlenbach, A. H.
Grossman, John Hammer, Clark Miner,
Miss Maud LÂ«;vy, C. Olancy.
A generous variety of prizea was
awarded, among the many valuable gate
prizes being a bicycle. The prizes in the
various races and sports were scarcely less
valuable, and included the following:
In the married ladies' race, an order for
a large photo, which was kindly donated
by the Globe Portrait Company, good for
any time party presents her photo.
An order for a pocketbookfromSanborn,
Vail & Co. for the young ladies' race.
To the winner of tne fat man's race, an
elegant smoking set, the very latest from
Paris.
The winner of the single men's race re
ceived one set of cuff and collar boxes
from the Japanese department of the Em
porium.
In the girls' race an order on the candy
stand of tie Emporium for a box of French
cream candies was presented to the victor.
The prize in the race for boys under 16
was an order on Beamish for one sweater.
The winner of the special race of the
San Francisco Call was given a free sub
scription to The Call for one year.
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell gave one silver cup,
finely engraved, for a special race; al.so an
invitation to all the comers to ttiis picnic
to visit his ranch.
One of the most interesting features of
the day's diversions was a tug of war con
test in wuich four teams were entered,
composed of employes of the following
firms: J. J. O'Brien^ Hale Bros.. O'Con
nor & Moffat and the White House. J.
W. Wyckoff of the Emporium acted as
referee of the contest.
One-half of the profits arising from the
excursion will be given to aid the sur
vivors of the Fifth-street disaster. The
generosity of the clerks in promptly show
ing in a substantial manner tneir sym
pathy for the unfortunate sufferers of the
recent horror is particularly commendable
and worthy of general imitation.
STABBED AND ROBBED.
A. G. JohnSon Found Dying in
the Brushâ Claims He Was
Waylaid.
The Police and a Receiving Hospital
Doctor Say He Attempted
Suicide.
A. G. Johnson, a carpenter with a wife
and six children residing at 720 Fell street,
was found in a dying condition in the
brush near the Masonic Cemetery at 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon by a young
man.
When questioned as to the cause of his
injuries he stated that he had left his
home in the morning at 7 o'clock with the
intention of visiting a friend named Jonn
McCready, who resides at 2616 McAllister
street. Taking the Hayes-street car for
that purpose he got off at Lott street to
make a short cut through the brush and
there met two masked men, who attacked
him.
One held him while the other cut him
severely in both his wrists and stabbed
him several times in the region of the
heart and tben robbed him of $46 30 and
some valuable papers, and left him, as
they thought, dead.
The young man who found Johnson re
ported the case to the police, and the
patrol wagon was sent out and brought
him to the Receiving Hospital, where he
repeated the same story as that told his
rescuers, adding that he became uncon
scious after being injured and when he
came to he was too weaK to leave the
place.
Dr. Rinne made an examination of his
injuries und pronounced them self-in
flicted.
Detective Fitzgerald was detailed on the
case and, after making his investigation,
corroborated the opinion of Dr. Rinne
that it was a case of attempted suicide.
But Johnson sticks to his version of the
assault and robbery.

A Horse That Knows His Route.
There is a horse whose business is
to draw a collection wagon over
a postoffice route in the middle
of the city which knows the loca
tion of the letter-boxes as well as its driver,
the postman. There are a number ot'
these boxes near together on Broad street,
just helow Chestnut â too near together for
the postman to bother about driving from
one to the other. He is saved all
trouble of leading his horse, however, by
ti;e intelligence of that animal, which as
soon as the postman ali.:hts at the first
box, walks off to the second and patiently
waits there for his master.â Philadelphia

TALK TOO MUCH,
H Is Presumed That They
Are Doing Their Whole
Duty.
HEARING MANY SECRETS
Bad Policy to Do Anything
That Will Discourage
Capital.
ANOTHER TRAGEDY EXPECTED.
Electric Cars Totally Ignore the Ordi

at Crossings.
Oaclakd OmcE San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 28. |
"Alameda County is suffering from the
talkativeness of some of its officials," said
a man of wealth and influence this week.
Although rich men do not, as a rule, have
rr.uch regard for county officials, there is
much truth in the remark at this time.
Tne particular offender during the fiscal
year has been Harry l)alton, the Assessor.
Every few days an interview with Mr. Dal
ton is printed, in which he gives
to the public some information which
they have no business to expect.
It is presumed that Mr. Dalton does
his duty, as he is well paid for doing it;, it
is not supposed that he is doing more or
less; therefore, it is bad etiquette to pro
claim and defend his position on points
that nobody has raised. In his researches
among the merchants and bankers the
Assessor learns much of the inner work
ings of the taxpayers' affairs that should
be regarded as confidential.
The law makes liberal allowance for the
advertising of all kinds of tax notices, and
does not require the Assessor to give no
tice of his private intentions and views in
regard to making assessments. Mr. Dal
ton has boen quoted as saying that he is
the foe to corporations and that none of
their personal property shall escape taxa
tion that is located in this county. The
Assessor has no business to be the foe of
any tax-paying concern or individual, and
as for the rest, he is paid to assess per
sonal property and to assess it all, and to
assess it honestly.
Mr. Dalton has been a good Assessor,
but it is not good policy for any official to
say anything which carries a different
meaning from that which he intended to
convey.
Many men of capital in Oakland have
received communications asking about the
possibilites of investments and requesting
some light on the methods of assessment.
When the title to the water front is clear
it will present unparalleled facilities for
the establishment of manufacturing plants.
â¢~>niy by ouch additions can Oakland be
come what its splendid harbor entitles it
to be, and anything that operates to the
alienation of capital is bad policy. If an
election were at hand the voluminous "ex
planations" of officials might be some
what justified, but they are all in office
till 1898, and they are surely politicians
enough to know that anything said or
done at this time will cut no figure two
years hence.
The High libel case promises to furnish
the opportunity for which many promi
nent OaklanderÃ have been looking. For
several months the men who play a con
epicuoas part in the superficial life of the
city have been anxious for a legitimate
opportunity to make public much that is
of interest to the masses. The chance has
now come, and to-morrow's trial will
surely be a sensational one in many re
spects. Editor High has collided with
the most powerful interests in this city
and he realizes it, but announces his in-
tention to fight to a finish. He says when
he heard that W. W. Foote was to prose
cute for Mr. Dingee he felt inclined to
engage the services of Messrs. Corbett and
Bharkey, but compromised with himself
on Attorney Beatty, "because he trained
me for my first footrace, and I wish him
to train me for my first libel case, as 1 ex
pect many more." The list of witnesses
includes some bank presidents and lead
ing politicians, and many hints were
dropped to-uay of expected disclosures. It
may be that thers will he some disap
pointment. Judge Wood is not partial to
irrelevant testimony and much of the ex
pected sensation may be ruled out. In any
event the Police Court will be an interest
ing place to-morrow.
A few months ago two beautiful little
girls were mangled by an electric-car in
West Oakland. Their young lives might
have been saved nad not two cars been
passing at a street crossing. This matter
was proved to the satisfaction of the City
Council, and an ordinance was passed
regulating the passing of cars at crossings.
The new ordinance is totally ignored, and
not a day passes that there is not a score
of narrow escapes from exactly the same
cause. On the many lines crossing Broad
way disobedience to the ordinance is par
ticularly noticeable. There will be another j
fearful tragedy before long, and when the
streetcar companies are mulcted in heavy
damages they may find it is cheaper not
to pass each other within fifty feet of a
crossing.
Major Pico of Temescal is opposed to
the veto power of an executive officer.
Twice has the Legislature passed bis
claim for supplying goods to soldiers in
active service many years ago, and both
times the Governor has vetoed the bill.
He was on Broodway this afternoon with
an armful of new evidence that he says
will convince Governor Budd of the just
ness of bis claim. He has found an affi
davit from Senator Fair, another from
Newton Booth and others from the offi
cers of regiments he supplied, and these
he will present to the Governor. He has
also brought out a witness from England
to help him make his fight apain, and now
he feels confident that the veto will not be
applied. A very clear case is made out by
the affidavits, and it certainly appears that
the major ie entitled to the few thousands
he asks. During the alcalde days the
Picos made many munificent grants to the |
State, but the last of his race, now a
broken-down pensioner, is having a hard
time to collect a bill forty years old.
S. YV. B. '
Broke His Wrist.
OAKLAND, Cau, June 28. â Joseph
Hooson, a student of St. Mary's College,
went to San Leandro to-day from his home
in Haywards and on his return met with
a severe accident. He was riding a wheel
when the front wheel came off. The rider
was thrown forward and broke his right
wrist, SDrained his left one and badly cut
his face. He sustained a severe shock and
will be ill for several weeks.
AN UNFAIR DECISION.
Ha > wards Wins a Game That Is
Awarded to San Leandro,
BAY WARDS, Cal., June 28.â The base
ball match with the Southern Pacifies
of San Leandrv to-day resulted in a gene
ral row. The Azaleas went to San
Leandro to play and the game was um
pired by a man named Conner from San
Francisco, connected with the Newspaper
League, under whose auspicei the game
was piayoc". At the conclusion the game
was won by Haywards by a score of 18 to
5. The umpire was then told that some
of the Haywards team were over the age
allowed by the rules and awarded the
game to San Leandro on a score of 9to 0.
The Haywards team at once protested
and the objectionable umpire wanted to
fight. He was finally induced by the con
stable to leave the plaza. The Haywards
team was composed of M. Rose, captain;
F. Enos, pitcher; F. Zambreski, first
base; A. La Cunha, second base; H.
Young, third base ; C. Raver, shortstop ;
M. Riggs. left held ; J. Pann, right field;
C. Gesham, center field. All the players
declare that they are not over the stipu
lated age of IS years.
Indignant Parents.
OAKLAND. Cal., June 28.â Next Friday
nignt the residents of Piedmont will hold
an indignation meeting to protest against
the action of the Trustees in removing
Mrs. Nellie French from tho principalship
of the school. Mrs. French has been a
teacher for eight years and supports her
aged parents. Noreason was given by the
Trustees for her removal.
Death of Mrs. Stevens.
BERKELEY. Cal., Jane 28.â Mrs.
Ellen Stevens of Durant avenue died this
morning at her home of chronic nephritis.
She was a native of England and aged 65
3'ears. The funeral will t.ike place to

family residence.
ALAMEDA CLUB REGATTA.
Good Day's Aquatic Sport
Is Enjoyed on the
Estuary.
Junior and Senior Outrigger Contests
Watcbei With Interest.
Future Events.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 27.â The boat
house and jetties of the Aiameda Boating
Club were filled with intere-ted spectators
throughout the afternoon to witness the
club's regatta yesterday.
This was the first time in years that such
an important event has taken place on the
estuary. The whole affair was a success,
though a protest in the last race marred
what otherwise would have been an ideal
day for oarsmen.
The day was fine and not too hot. At
the latter part of the afternoon a stiff
breeze blew up the reach and somewhat
retarded the pullers. The course was laid
out about due west from the boathouse
for tbre-quarters of a mile, returning to
the boathouse, which served both as a
starting-point and goal.
The officers of the club, which numbers
over fifty members, are: J. A. Sansom,
president: C. J. Lancaster, vice-president;
W. Hinchman, secretary; S. W. Creigh,
treasurer; A. Schumacher, captain; L. A.
Mervey, lieutenant. For the regatta the
judges were J. A. Sansom and A. Schu
macher; starter, S. W. Creigh; referee, Al
Roiijters; timekeepers, J. J. Conro and S.
3. Pembroke.
The first race was for junior outriggers,
the prizes being a gold and a silver medal
for the first and second men. Owing to the
number of entries and the want of skiffs,
the race was run in heats, as follows:
First heatâ W. Hinchman, 12:58; C. Ayers,

Mervy and Hanson beins ties, they
rowed a short race to see who should be
iv the semi-final race, and Mervy won
after an exciting pull. The result of the
semi-final left Hancoct and Webb to row
the final.
Before this was determined the senior
outrigger race was held for a silver cup,
which has to be won three times before
becoming the property of the winner. The
only competitors were Fred Ayers and Dr.
Dennis. They rowed a slashing race, and
Ayers only won by a nose.
Avers says he can beat the time â 12:44 â
easily, and would have done so in this
case had the muscles of his right forearm
not been seized with cramps as he turned
the stake.
The final for the junior outrigger race
brought about a foul. The rowers were
tired and the course was shortened nearly
one-half. Hancock claimed that Webb
took his water in rounding the turn.
It was decided to row the race again a
fortnight from to-day, and have a consola
tion race for a jewel presented by C. J.
Pembroke for the six beaten juniors.
In addition the rest of the events omitted
from the programme to-day will be car
ried out.
This ciub will be represented at Stockton ;
on July 4 by Hancock and Webb in the
junior outrigger class and Fred Ayers and
C. J. Pembroke in the senior. The latter,
who ia the outrigger champion of the
coast, went out alone for an hour to lim
ber himself up. He showed himself to be
in good form, and his easy, graceful style
was much admired.

THE TURKISH KAIK.
It More Closely Kesembles tlin Gondola
Than Any Other Craft.
Crawford, the author, to whose skillful
pen Constantinople is indebted for one of
the most charming volumes ever issued
in its praise, has a word to say about the
Turkish boatmen and their vehicle, the
kaik.
"Constantinople owes much," writes
he, "to the matchless beauty of the three
waters which run together beneath its
walls, and much of their reputation again
has become world-wide by the kaik. It is
disputed and disputable whether the
Turks copied the Venetian gondola or
whether the Venetians imitated the Turk
ish kaik, but thn resemblance between
them is so strong as to make it certain
that they have a common origin. Take
from the gondola the 'ieibe' or hood, and
the remainder is practically the kaik. It
is of all craft of Its size the swiftebt. the
most easy to handle and the most com
fortable, and the Turks generally are ad
mitted to be the best oarsmen in Eurpe.
Indeed, they have need to be, for both
the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn are
crowded with craft of every kin J and made
dangerous by the swiftest of currents.
The distances, too, are very preat and such
as no ordinary oarsman would undertake
for pleasure orfor the sake of exercise. It
is no joke to pull fifteen or sixteen miles
against a stream which in some places
runs four or live knots ao|hour." j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1896.
MYSTERY OF H
OLO ARMY NURSE
Dying at the Receiving
Hospital Without a
Friend.
IS A SOLDIER'S WIDOW.
She Was Seriously Injured While
With the Army of the
Tennessee.
WEAK IN BODY AND MIND.
Un'ess Relief Is Sp?edy, She Will Be
Immured in the County Alms*
bouse.
OAKtAKn Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 28. l
An old soldier's widow is at the Receiv
ing Hospital, and it is thought that her
Mrs. Nellie Bntler, an Old Army Nnrse and a Pensioner. Who Is Near to Death
at the Receiving Hospital.
days are numbered. Enough is known of
her history to prove that she Is well con
nected in the East, but her mental con
dition is so weak that she cannot Bupply
the missing links.
Nellie Butler is the name of the old lady,
and she was found suffering at a Broadway
hotel a few days ago. As sho had no
friends and no money she was sent to the
Receiving Hospital, and she will probably
soon be sent to the County Infirmary,
where she will be lost to all acquaintances
unless her memory is strengthened.
Enough has been learned from her to
show that her husband was killed at Fort
Donelson, for which she now draws a pen
sion of $12 per month. After the death of
her husband, Mrs. Butler attached herself
to the army of the Tennessee as an army
nurse, and in one of the worst engage
ments she was wounded in the leg. The
wound is now bothering her considerably
and is of such a nature that it will never
heal.
Her past is shrouded in mystery. It is
considered strange that a woman with a
record so clear as to entitle her to a pen
sion, and witti the hospital record which
she claims, should be so friendless and un
known to either Grand Army or woman's
Relief Corps. Her residence previous to
her cominp here is unknown and her pur
pose is no better understood. Her cloth
ing is good, but hick of personal care is
painfully evident. The pension would be
inadequate to support her, but she has
always had means to pay her bills. She
rook none into her confidence.
Mr. Linderman, landlord of the hotel
from which >she was taken, says that dur
ing the two weeks she staved there she
was not wholly rational. \Vhen she first
went to the hotel she was accompanied by
two women claiming to be her friends,
but neither of them has sinco called
to inquire after her.
Mrs. Flack of North Oakland has known
the old nurse about a year, but has never
been able to learn how it was that she wan
in California with no friends or relatives.
Mtb. Butler is a very rleasant-looking
old lady with white hair and Boft eyes.
She talks in a rambling manner and
makea many references to people, but no
sense can b8 made out of her remarks.
This afternoon she seemed brighter tn:m
usual and talked considerably of Bar Har
bor, but she could not answer any direct
questions abor.t places or people. The poor
old soul is suffering from cholera morbus
and from her wonnded limb, and the ef
fect of her ailments has been to weaken
her mind.
PIONEERS WAX WROTH.
Their Reasons for Wanting to
Put Up an Independent
Ticket.
Ex-President C. V. S. Gibbs Gives His
Version of "Dry Rot" and
"Pars mony."
The men who courageously came to
California in 1849 and tho spring of '50
dared many dangers, endured many hard
ships and are undoubtedly entitled to the
gratitude of posterity. It seems as though
these hardy pioneers, those who still sur
vive, ought to be enabled to pass their de
clining years in peace and comfort and be
exempt from all future strife and worry.
Unluckily snch is not the case, and the
hoary-beaded argonauts of '49 seem to be
getting their full share of worldly trouble.
As was related in yesterday's Call the
"Young Pioneer?," as they are pleased to
style themselves, are stirring up excite
merit over the approaching annual elec
tion of the Society of California Pioneers.
It is claimed by the sons and grandÃons of
toe Pioneers that the society under its ex
isting administration )9 full of ''dry rot,"
ana unless some severe remedial measures
be immediately applied is in imminÂ«-nt
danger of becoming mummified and as
lifeless as an Egyptian sphinx.
The officers, it'is said, are to all interns
and purposes hereditary and the prevail
ing policy is decidedly too parsimonious.
Even thehall, the juniors say, has a chilly
nir of sepulchral loneliness and the voice
of the secretary sounds like that of a sex
ton speaking from a tomb. For this and
similar reasons the malcontents declare
that they will' put an independent ticket
in the field and if successful in electing it
next month will wake up all of the old
stagers from their Rip Van Winuel sleep
and make tnem think that they are living
over aeain "cLe days of old and the days
of L'old."
The seniors, though, tell another story.
They declare that the young Pioneers
B3 a class are not hostile to the existing
conservative administration and that it is
only the chronic soreheads who are rais
ing ail this "'tempest in a teapot." Fol
lowing is a list of the present officers of
the society :
Presidentâ H. Ht. Tilden.
Vice-Presidentsâ Niles Searls. San Fran
cisco; H. E. Highton, San Francisco; C. T.
Ryland, Santa Clara; T. L. Barker, Oakland;
W\ H. Ellis, Sunol.
Treasurerâ John I>. Tallant.

Directorsâ Christian Reis. D. D. Harris, E. M.
Root, Leon Sloss, H. B. Russ, Charles C. Moore,

Messrs. C. V. S. Gibb.Â«. E. I<. Cooper, W. J.
Tiller, J. S. Wethered, Peer Tiffany, Edwin
JESounell and Alpheus Bull jr., composing the
nominating committee, recently presented '.he
following regular ticket, to be voted for the
7tnof next momh: Elliot M. Root, president;
Niles Searls, J. Z. Davis, C. T. Ryfand, T.L.
Barker, Howard Havens, vice-presidents; Johu
D. Tallant. treasurer; John F. Piukham, mar
shal; H. N. Tilden, J. H. Jewett, H. B. Rubs,
Wakefleld Baker, C. J. King, C. M. Plum, A. R.
Cotton, E. T. Kruse, Leon Sloss, directors.
So well pleased was the committee with
its nominees that at the foot of the ticket
it nrinted the following indorsement:
Efich and every man named thereon has
given this society abundant evidence of his
unswerving devotion to its best interests, and
by retaining on the ticket a majority of last
year's hoard of directors it assures to this so
uiety ft continuance of the wlae and judicious
administration of its affairs.
"Our society," said ex-President C. V.
S. Gibbs, "comprises a minority of sore
heads. Some of them are juniors, but the
mosc of them are seniors. TnÂ« young
I men, as a rule, are too sensible to be
found in such company. Every year
these malcontents put, or try to put, an
independent ticket in the field, and
every time it is overwhelmingly
defeated. The affairs of the so
ciety are in a prosperous condition,
and there has not been any trouble
| recently. An average of $1000 is ex
pended monthly for the benent of needy
i members, but the pioneers â the old
! timers â are peculiar men and some of
i them think that the $200,000 we have now
! profitably and safely invested, should he
i called in and divided among them. That
!is the milk in the cocoanut. If we were to
i adopt such a suicidal policy as this, of
course, we could not perpetuate our organi
zation and the young memoers would be
left bankrupt when they come into con
trol."
ONE OF THE HIGH THREE
Joseph F. Smith, a President of
the Mormon Church, on
Utah.
He Says the Abundance of Utah's Iron
Ore Exceeds That of Any Other
Locality.
At the Pythian Castle last evening Jo*
?eph F. Smith, one of the three presidents
of the Mormon Church, and Abram H.
Cannon, one of the Twelve Apostles, spoke
eloquently on the tenets of their faith to a
large audience.
Alter the meeting Mr. Smith said to a
reporter:
"The Jviormon church i 3 constantly
growing and gaining strength all over the
world. People now are beginning to learn
the truth about us; that is, that we are a
quiet, God-fearing, industrious class of
people that have no greater desire than
to live justly and well.
"I would "rather make no prophecy as to
the ultimate power of cur church in the
future. We truly believe that our faith is
the original faith that Christ taught when
he was on earth. We take his teachings
literally and permit no private interpreta
tion of his word.
"Mr. Cannon and myself are visiting
this coast to look after some mining inter
ests owned by us in Nevada. No, I never
talk of politics. lam a churchman, not a
politician. All I can say of Utah is ihat
it is all right. It possesses gold incalcula
ble and silver beyond belief. Utah will
some time far cxc.cd Pennsylvania in its
output of iron. There are mountains of
irou thero of the finest quality. Yes, in
deed, Utah will become a very rich State.
She has all the resources necessary to such
a condition.
"It is oar custom when visiting a city to
speak in the places of Mormon worship
only when invited to do so by the local
minister."
The party leaves for Salt Lake City to
day.
The clock which was actually made by
the royal hands of Louis XVI came into
the possession of a member of the Roths
child family a few years ago. It is proba
bly the most valuable clock in existence,
its present owner giving no less than Â£33,
-600 for the remarkable timepiece.
PLOTTED AGAINST
BY HIS PEOPLE,
Spirits Suggest That a Man
May Be Taken From
His Family.
BROUGHT FROM TORONTO
Informed That His Mother Was
Dead and His Sister
Dying.
ALL AN TJNNATUBAL PLOT
Now Contemplates So ng His Rela
tives for Ruining His Com
mercial Standing.
Oakland Officb Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 27. )
Another romance has been attributed to
the spirits that bring their messages from
the unseen world at eventide and deliver
them to the faithful in the vicinity of
Castle Peterhoff at Fruitvale.
Very unhappy is the sequel to a peculiar
train of circumstances which have been
the experience of Edward Scarlett of
Toronto, since be left his home last
October. He came here in answer to an
urgent letter irom his sister Kitty, telling
him that she was dying of consumption
and that his mother was dead, and asking
that he come to Oakland to settle up the
estate left by their father.
Scarlett left his wife and family on hiÃ
little ranch at Toronto, and came to Oak
land, only to fina that his sister wa- in the
best of health, and that his mother was
living. His wife is now destitute in
Toronto, his credit destroyed and every
body believes he has deserted his family,
while he is still in this city trying to raise
enough money to get home.
"All this trouble has been caused by the
spirits," said Edward Scarlett this after
noon. "I have been the victim of one of
the most unnatural and unkind plots that
ever a sister and mother planned to ruin
the happiness of a family.
"About eight months aj?o I received a
very pathetic letter from my sister asking
me to come here at once. She said mother
was dead and she was dyine, and that it
would be necessary for me to come out
here and settle up the estate. I knew that
when my father died he left an estate
valued at about $50,000, and as I was
anxious to see my sister alive I came at
once. I had no address but Oakland, and
when I came here I had to engage a de
tective and hnd my sister. I found that
she had married and was Mrs. Taylor,
and that she had been married three years,
but had said nothing of it. After a long
search I found the family at Fruitvale,
and to my great surprisa the first person
I met at the house was my mother, whom
I supposed was dead. I soon discovered
that my sister was in the best of health
and was married.
"Subsequent investigation brought to
light the facts of the whole plot. My
mother and sister did not like my wife
and had been told by spirits that it would
be better if we were separated. Their ob
jection to my wife is that she is a Baptist.
They also object to my being a Presby
terian, and ever since I have been here
they have been trying to get me to believe
in spiritualism. Different parties have
come to me with messages from my
father, but I have refused to believe them.
"Ever since I learned of the way in
which I have been tricked I have been
trying to get back home. I have a beauti
ful little ranch, on whi^h live my wife and
two children. When 1 got my sister's let
ter I mortgaged the place for a small sum
and gave my wife all that I did not re
quire for the journey. Now the mort
gage is about due and my family is in
danger of being put out after we have
worked for twenty years to own the place.
I have been trying to get back for several
months, but my sister and mother have
been continually making promises about
raising a couple of thousand dollars so
that I could go back and make everything
square.
"Now a new chapter baa opened up.
The advisers from the unsaen world have
said that it would be best for my sister and
mother to raise what cash tbey can and
co to New Zealand. lam also told that if
I co along I can do very well in that
country. This last news has caused me
to make up my mind. My mother and
sister have either got to give me enough
money immediately to get home or else I
shall bring suit against them for damages.
I do not think I could recover much, for
all their money is loaned out on notes and
lam not altogether enamored of the se
curity. They tell me that the notes are
good and that tne loans were made on
good advice. The advice, however, was
not of this world, so I cannot investi
gate it.
''To-day I received a letter from my wife
telling me how I am practically ruined
through being called away. I must get
back witJin two weeks or my home is lost.
I have been married fifteen years, and to
attempt to estrange us at this time is dia
bolical. My little girl writes me that her
mother cries all the time and is really be
ginning to think she is deserted. I must
get home at onoe, but I cannot raise a
dollar."
When Scarlett made a demand for
money his mother decided to raffle a gold
watch with which to raise the money, and
is now offering a piece of property for
$1500.
A peculiar feature of the affair is that
Mrs. Taylor, the sister, admits tnat the
whole business was a scheme to get her
brother out here.
"We do not approve of his wife," she
said, "and so I told him of mother's death
and my illness to bring him out here. We
do not like his wife's religion and she only
married him because she thought he
would get some money from his father's
estate." _________^__

THE SOUTH-END ROWERS
A Barge and Single Shell Will
Go Up lo the Stockton
Regatta.
Why the Boys Do Not Care for the
Cup Trophies â Medals More
Tangible.
On the Fourth of July a rowing regatta
will take place at Stockton, and the boat
clubs of that city which are managing the
aquatic affair complain that the San Fran
cisco oarsmen are not enthusiastic over
the coining boating contests.
They say that Stockton has always sent
clubs to the Bay City who assisted mate
rially in making the regattas here suc
cesses and now the San Francisco boys are
aaffiicted with the stay-at-home complaint.
They particularly reier to the South End
Club and their regatta v few weeks ago at
El Carapo, where two Stockton teams com
peted in the rowing contests.
"I don't think the Stockton people have
any complaint regarding our club," said
Frank Dupleisse of the South Enders yes
terday. "We are going to send a bark
crew and a single-sculler to their regatta,
and that is the number they sent to our El
Campo affair. We cannot send any more
than the junior crew as Carison, our best
man in the senior bargr, is employed on a
bay schooner and cannot practice with the
rest of the crew. If our junior boys win
at Stockton they will enter in a senior
race, and that will be equivalent to two
crews. I, of course, will pull in a single
scull.
"Another thing that is a little unsatis
factory with our boys is the prizes to be
given at the comine regatta, They are to
be trophies instead of medals. Now, a
trophy is generally a cup which is pretty
ana an honor to the crew, but it is gener
ally put away in some fellow's room and
is soon forgotton. But an individual
medal an oarsman can keep in his own
possession, and it has more value as a
memento of his race.
"It takes time and hard work to pet
ready for a race, and while the glory of
winning goes a great distance, a fellow
wants something tangible to remind him
of the gallant struggle after the glory has
blown away.
"However, we are not finding fault with
the Stockton regatta committee, and will
cheerfully try to make their affair a suc
cess in every way."
CAKE MAKING.
Many Improvements Made in the Art
in Later Years.
It is interesting to trace back to the
earliest records the history of cake and
cake-making. The ancients made cake,
but it was not the rich, highly seasoned
and flavored confection which we indulge
in nowadays. They had plain cakes, made
with flour and water, some of them with
out a suspicion of sweet or flavor, borne
of them were not unlive our plainest
crackers, and were often eaten as we eat
bread.
Wedding-cake was an institution among
them as with vÂ«, but the cake was a plain
one, and was broken above the head of the
bride as she went into her new home.
This was a special feature of Roman mar
riages 2000 years ago. The breaking of
the cake was part of a solemn ceremony,
and was said to be very impressive.
A similar custom prevails in some por
tions of Scotland, where a bannock is
broken above the head of the young wife
as she for the first time enters her new
home. All of the cakes of ancient History
are plain and simple. It is only as we
come down to more modern times that we
hear of spices and Iruits and all of the rich
and luxurious ingredients in which pres
ent-day cakemakers delight.
In Queen Elizabeth's time sciceoakes
and buns were eaten at weddings. From
these the faÃhion and fancy j>rew for all
sorts of elaborate and deliciously unwhole
some combinations, until there seems to
be a perpetual struggle for something new
and more unusual to stir into the cuke of
the period.
Very many persons think cake is very
unwholesome, borne sorts of cake may
be, but why a simple cake with a little
good fruit in it should bo specially in
jurious is a puzzling question. Cake made
with fresh, sweet butter and fresh eges
can scarcely be a tax on the digestive
powers, and no other shortening save good
butter should ever be put into cake, many
housewives and high-reputationed cooks
to tne contrary notwithstanding. It ia a
greasy, oily shortening that makes cake
dangerous, and when much of this fat is
used the compound is wholly unlit lor a
delicate stomach.
Light, thoroughly baked cake, made of
good materials, may he digested by all
persons In ordinary health, and even "chil
dren of all ages may eat it with safety.â

ME. LINCOLN AS A POLITICIAN.
How He Secured the Adoption of the
Thirteenth Amendment.
Lincoln was a supreme politician, ana
he was a politician who understood poli
tics because he understood human nature.
And finally tne idea was conceived that
the constitution of the Unite! States
should be amended so tnat slavery should
be prohibited in the constitution. That
was a change in our polity, and it was also
a most important military measure. It
was intended not merely as a means of
prohibiting slavery, but as a means of
affecting the judgfnent and the feeling and
the anticipations of those in rebellion.
Well, when the question finally came
around to be voted on in the House of
Representatives it required three-quarters
of the votes, and this vote, this final deci
sion, was canvassed earnestly, intensely,
most anxiously fora long time beforehand.
At last, late one afternoon, the President
canio into my office, a room in the third
story of the \Var Department. He used to
come there sometimes rather than send for
me. because he was very fond of walking
and liked to go about a good deal. He
canif; in and shut the door.
It was believed that the amendment to
the constitution would be equivalent to
new armies in the Held, equivalent to send
ing 100,000 men to tight, because thi3
would be an intellectual army and an in
tellectual force that would tend to paralyze
the enemy and break the continuity of his
idea. In order to amend tne constitution
it was necessary first to have tne proposed
amendment approved by two-thirds of the
States, and when that question came to be
considered the issue was seen to be so close
tbat one State more was necessary.
1 hen the State of Nevada was organized
to answer that purpose and was admitted
into the Union. I nave heard people
sometimes conn lain of Nevada as a super
fluous and petty State, not big enough to
be a State; but when I hear that com
plaint I always think of Abraham Lin
coln's saying, ''It. is easier to admit Ne
vada ttiun to raise another million of sol
diers."
"Dana," he said, "I am very anxious
about this vote. It has got to be taken
next week. The time is very short. It is
going to be a great deal closer thanl wish
it was."
"There are plenty of Democrats who
wish to vote for it, I replied, "and who
will vote for it. There is Governor Eng
lish of Connecticut. I think he is sure,
isn't he?"
"Oh, yes, he is sure, on the merits of the
question."
"Then." said I, "there's Sunset Cox of
Ohio. How ia he?"
"He is sure and fearless. But there are
some others that I am not sure about.
There are three that you can deal with
better than anybody else, perhaps, as you
know them all. I wish you would send
for them."
He told me who they were. It isn't
necessary to repeat the names here. One
man was from New Jersey and two from
New York.
"Wiiat will they be likely to want?" I
asked.
"I don't know," said the President. "I
don't know. It makes no difference,
though, that we carry ihis vote or be com
pelled to raise another million, and I
don't know how many more men, and
right no one knows how long. It is a ques
tion of three votesor new armies."
"Well, sir," said I, "what shall I say to
these gentlemen?"
"I don't know," said he; "but I say
this to you, that whatever promise you
make to those men I will perform it."
"Well, now. this is a fact thai I do not
think is recorded in any history. I don't
believe my friend, Thomas C. Acton, who
sits back there, ever heard of it before. I
sent for the men, and saw them one by
one. I found that tiiey were afraid of their
party. They said that some fellows in the
party would be down on them. Two of
them wanted internal revenue collectors
apoointed. Said I, "You shall have it."
Another one wanted a very important ap
pointment about the Custom-hotiseof New
York. I Knew the man well whom he
wanted to have appointed. He was a Re
publican, though the Congressman was a
Democrat, I had served with him in the
Republican party County Committee of
New York. The office was worth perhaps
$20,000 a year. When the Congressman
stated the case I asked him, "Do you want
that? '
"Yes," said he.
"Well," I answered, "you shall have it."
"I understand, of course," said he, "that
you are not saying this of your own au
thority?"
"Oh, no," said I; "I am saying it on the
authority of the I'refident."
Well, he voted; the amendment was
carried and slavery was abolished by con
stitutional prohibition in all parts of the
United States. That was done and I felt
that this little piece of side politics was
one of the most judicious, humane and
wisa pieces of Executive authority that I
had ever assisted in or witnessed. [Ap
plause.]
Bu 1 this appointment in the New York
Custom-house was to wait a few weeks
until tne terms of the actual incumbent
had run out. My friend, the Democratic
Congressman, wns quite willing. He said :
"That's all right: I'm in no hurry." We!!,
before the time hnd expired, Mr. Lincoln
was murdered, and Andrew Johnson be
came. President. I had gone away, an I
was in the West, wh^n one day I got a
telegram from KosroeConkling, "Come to
Washington. " So 1 went. He said:
"I want you to go and see President
Johnson and tell him that this is a secred
promise of Mr. Lincoln's, and that it must
be kept."
Then I went to the White House and saw
President Johnson.
"This is Mr. Lincoln's promise," I
urged. '"He regarded it as saving the
necessity of another call for troops and
raising perhaps 1,000,000 men to continue
the war. I trust, Mr. President, tuat you
will see your way clear to execute this
promise."
"Well, Mr. Dana," he replied, "I don't
say that I won't, but I have observed in
the course of my experience that such
bargains tend to immorality." [Laugh
ter.]
The appointment was not made. lam
happy to say, however, that the gentle
man to whom the promise was given
never found any fault either with Presi
dent Lirrcoln or with the Assistant Secre
tary, who had been the means of making
the promise to him. [Applause.]â From a

GREAT OIL FIELDS
YET UNDEVELOPED,
California's Prospects Would
Excite Pennsylva
nians.
A. S. COOPER'S VIEWS.
Whole West Side of San Joaquin
Valley Is Rich in Fetro
leum.
WILL BE BIGGEST OIL STATE.
Capital Has Been Timid and There
Has Been Little Intelligent
Prospecting.
The time is coming when California will
surpass Pennsylvania as an oil State, says
A. S. Cooper, the Southern California
authority on asphaltum mines and oil
wells.
For the last eight years Mr. Cooper,
who was formerly County Surveyor of
Santa Barbara, has devoted his entire time
to the study of asphaltura mines and oil
regions, and has collected at Santa Bar
bara a most complete library on tne sub
ject as treated by both American and
foreign writers. In addition he has almost
ready for publication a book dealing with
these products in California.
"There is a district 250 miles in length,"
said he yesterday, "along the we_t side of
the San Joaquin Valley that will be a
great oil country. Commencing at Sun
set depot the oil belt extends northward,
tollowing the base of the mountains to
Mount Diablo; in fact it runs as far north
as Point Arena.
"On the coast side there is oil, too. It
crops out all along to the southward, as is
shown by the asphaitum mines of San
Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties
and the oil wells already known in Santa
Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles coun
ties.
"Wnere you strike gas and asphaltum,
the lightest and the heaviest extremes of
petroleum, there must be oil somewhere
near.
"The fact is the country has not been
prospected, A little work has been carried
on here and there, but it has generally
been stupidly done.
"If these fields and such surface indica
tions were in Pennsylvania there would be
more 'wildcattiDg' tban was ever beard of
before. There holes would be bored for
oil from one end of the district to the
other. It is a most astonishing fact that
no one has gone into it. It seems as
though California capitalists were afraid to
tackle the oil business.
â¢'I believe that California is going to be
a bigger oil producer tban Pennsylvania
ever dared to be. They will not be flow
ing wells. They will have to be pumped.
"The Los Angeles wells produce gener
ally heavy oils with an asphaltum base. I
suppose they will give out after a while.
The field is not extensive; it occurs in a
dome and when that is exhausted they
will have to hunt for another.
"There is always good illuminating or
fuel gas wherever oil is found, but the
formation of stratification in California is
too steep for the gas to last long or flow in
a continuous stream.
"In the Sisquac, where I inspected a
well owned by Thomas B. Bishop, the gas
was so strong" at a depth of 910 feet that it
blew water out of the hole and 130 feet
in the air.
"Last Thursday I visited a new well a
mile north of Coalinger, in Fresno County.
They bad it capped, but they turned it
loose for my benefit, and oil flowed at the
rate of a barrel a minute. It is a pararine
oil with the high gravity of 44 Beaurue.
I found that it is an anti-clinal which ex
tends three or four miles, with good pros
pects of oil being found all along. That is
the best well I have seen in this State, but
there are hundreds of others to be de
veloped some day."

AN UNCLE AND
NIECE WEDDED,
The Ceremony Performed
on the High Seas
Yesterday.
THEY ARE FROM FRESNO
Deceived the Tug Captain as
to Their True Rela
tionship.
A QUESTIONABLE CONTRACT.
Attorney Rossi's Strange Opinion Up:n
the International Law of
Marriage.
Yesterday Vicenzo Maglio and Theresa
Maglio of Fresno were married on the
high seas, and outside of the jurisdiction
of the State of California.
It is well for the wedding couple that
there were three miles of ocean rolling
between them and the beach, otherwise
the penal code would be divorcing them
ere the marriage feast was cold.
Even the fact that the father of the
bridewas present and gave his daughter
away would not legalize the ceremony if
gone through vrithin the limits of this
State, for the gin is the daughter of her
husband's brother. In that case the mar
riage would be within the law of consan
guinity, being that of uncle and niece, and
would have been a crime committed by
both parties, punishable by imprisonment
in the State prison not exceeding ten
years.
The two brothers, with the young woman,
arrived in this City from Fresno Saturday
and secured the services of the tug Yigi
lant. The father represented to Captain
Brokaw that the couple desired to be
married at sea, notwithstanding the
fact that she was his daughter.
He also stated that she was 17 and
and the prospective bridegroom 30 years
of age. He explained the similarity of
names by saying that they were distantly
related. They did not wish to be married
by a Catholic priest, but prefened the
romance of the sea and to be joined to
gether by the master of a vessel.
Yesterday morning the three Maglios,
with Attorney F. A. Rossi and two otner
persons as witnesses, boarded the tug
Vigilant and steamed out through the
heads. The happy occasion was not re
plete with that joyousness that usually
marks a wedding, and the reluctance of all
parties to take the step was apparent. The
young woman was depressed even before
the tug beeran to lift over the swell of the
bar and then seasickness made her distress
pitiatile. In fact, notwithstanding the
ocean was quite calm, most all the rarty
were afflicted by the slight motions of the
vessel.
After reaching a point six or seven
miles outside Captain Brokaw read the
marriage service binding the couple
together in matrimony, the father of the
bride giving his consent to her union with
her uncle. The party then returned to
the City.
Attorney Rossi said last evening in an
interview that the M&gliofl were clients of
his, and he did not desire to give out any
details of the affair to the press.
"The matter," said he, "will hardly bear
discussion. Within the limits of the State
such a marriage would be punishable by
imprisonment, but out on the high seas
it is different. There is no international
law regarding intermarriages outside of a
State Government.
"The young woman was under ace, but
her father was present and gave his con
sent. All of the parties are well-to-do
people living in Fresno. The couple were
married by the captain of the tug, as he is
legally authorized to do."
"Did he know that they were uncle and
niece?"
"No. I believe he was unaware of that
relationship. As 1 said before, I do not
wisn to go into the reasons which moved
the parties concerned to take such a step.
Anyhow, they are married. "
There are some doubts, however,
whether such a union as this is will not
bring the high-sea contracting parties
under the ban of the law. A mar
riage by a. master mariner at sea
Â©n board of his own vessel is a
privilege rather than a moral right, but it
is a question whether a man and woman
so far within the degree of consanguinity,
after going through any form of marriage,
will be permitted to live together as hus
band and wife. It is a void contract, con
sequently no contract, ana the would-be
Mr. and Mrs. Vincenzo Maglio from
Fresno will probably find any act under
its provisions cannot but be illegal, and
the would-be Mr. and Mrs. Vincenzo
Maglio from Fresno will probably
find a policeman knocking at their
pseudo-nuptial door with a warrant for
tbeir arrest. As the young woman is not
a wife and is a minor she is yet under the
legal control of her father, who counsels
her to live in an unlawful relationship
with his own brother.
It waa a peculiar piece of Sunday work,
that marriage.

Stars of the Pugilistic Firmament Stoop to Shed Luster on Two Humble Baseball Fields.
DECADENCE OF THE
NATIONAL GAME,
Hippodroming to Revive the
Interest in Base
ball.
CORBETT AT THE BAT.
The Champion Pugilist Plays on
the Presidio Athletic
Diamond.
THOMAS BHABKEY, UMPIRE.
The Sailor Fighter Did Net Know
How to Duck Away From an
Inside Curve.
"It's mighty hard lines the good, old
honest game of baseball lias fallen into
when the people have to be jollied into
coming to see it by exhibiting a pugilist
as the star attraction," said a disgruntled
enthusiast yesterday.
"Coroett's a pretty good ballplayer, but
he's a much better boxer and baseball
isn't in bis class.
"But Sharkey! Well, he knows as
mucn about umpiring a game as I know
about r.ueilism, and that's nothing. He
was as much use in the Folsom-street
game yesterday as a second tail would be
to a dog. He didn't Know enough to keep
out of the way of the ball."
Although the disgruntled individual did
not use the choicest of English he voiced
the sentiment of almost every lover of the
National game who witnessed either of
yesterday's contests. It is to be regretted
that the managers of the sport which has
for years been above reproach in every re
spect, should see tit, for an ephemeral ad
vantage to aJly it with a business that is
outlawed in almost every State in the
Union.
Mr. Sharkey would doubtless shine as an
umpire in such a game as that at Louis
ville, Ky., one day last week, when several
of the players assaulted the deciding of
ficer. Mr. Corbett might likewise be
a star of the first magnitude in a team
composed of such pugnacious players, but
here, where baseball is conducted as it
should be, there is hardly need of the ser
vice of either of the illustrious gentlemen.
When Thomas Sharkey, professor of the
manly art, resplendent in a new pray suit
and a dream of a hat, appeared on the
ball held yesterday be was accorded a most
flattering reception. He was the recipi
ent of a beautilul bouquet of flowers and
much applause, but when Thomas
Sharkey, umpire, took his place behind
the pitcher the crowd laughed. Sharkey
was ciearly a figurehead. Donahue um
pired the game, while his companion
simply looked on and dazzled ail eyes in
the grand stand by reflecting therein the
brilliant rays of the sun from the diamond
which he wore in his shirtfront.
For one inning the conqueror of the
mighty Corbett successfully ducked the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1896.
ball whenever it came his way. Then as
he began to acquire confidence in himself
be suddenly received a terrific blow below
the ripht ear. Pitcher Doyle haa unex
pectedly turned and tried to catch a run
ner at second base. As he whirled about
he threw the ball with all his strength.
Sbarkey saw it coming but he could
neither sideÃtep nor stop it and he liter
ally "got it in the neck." The missile hit
him squarely. Sharkey shrugged his
shoulders, smiled sheenishly and the boys
on the bleachers yelled loudly. The San
Francisco players scurried around the
bases and before the startled pitcher knew
whether to run for his life or go after the
ball two unearned runs had been scored.
After that the honorary umpire dodged
whenever the ball came his wav and was
evidently glad when the game was over.
When Corbett put in an appearance on
the grounds, unlike Sharkey, he failed to
be the recipient of a bouquet. However,
his carriage called forth the full comple
ment erf wordy gush, with which the
schoolgirls' vocabulary is crowded. "Isn't
he sweet !" "Just see what a lovely com
plexion!" "Isn't he prettily built?" and
ali such stuff, were the exclamations to be
heard, and every once in a while some
irreverant boy would break in with re
marks that were evidently out of place in
a game where it was not baseball the dear
girls wanted to see, but Champion Corbett.
Charles Gagus umpired in a/ most satis
factory manner. That is, it must have
been satisfactory, for at no time did the
Pacifies, with the champion on first base,
have any argument with him. All de
cisions were carefully given against the
Californias, and no doubt they deserved
such treatment. A lover of baseball
would probably go further than that, and
say they deserved worse treatment than
they received.
In the third inning Corbett was caught
napping between first and second. His
friends said he had done it purposely to
allow Strei to make the home plate from
third. Perhaps he did, but he looked
sheepish when a little bit of a playet beat
him running and put him out.
The greatest mix up of the afternoon
was in the fifth inning. The Californias
were at the bat. McCord was on first try
ing to steal second. McCarthy threw the
ball to Corbett in hot style. The cham
pion was busily trying to think whether it
would be better to* let the ball pass or to
try and catch it. In the meantime McCord
played for safety. Unfortunately Corbett
was between him and the base and he had
no time to calculate what would be the
consequences.
The crash came. Talk about the hip
lock Sharkey got on Sullivan's conqueror,
it was nothing like the collision brought
about by McCord. Big Jim's legs flew
l from under him and with a half hand
spring he flew through the air, landing on
a soft spot, for McCord was underneath.
Poor McCord ! It will be a long titne be
fore he will forget the weight of the 190
-pound champion on his backbone.
OAKLAND WON EASILY.
The Local Men Could Do Nothing
With Doyle's Delivery.
The California Baseball League opened
its season of '96 most anspiciously. There
was a big crowd in attendance at the new
grounds, Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
and every one present went away delighted
with the game that was played. After the
first two innings it was as pretty a contest
as one would care to see. Both pitchers
were very effective and the fielding of all
the players, with the single exception of
King, was above the average.
Pitcher Iberg of the San Franciscos was
a bit nervous at the beginning, but soon
steadied down, and during the last seven
innings allowed the opposing batsmen but
five scattered bits. Doyle of the Oakland*,
however, saw Ibers'sgame and went him
a few notches better. The San Franciscos
were able to cull but five safe hits off his
delivery during the entire game.
Oakland was first at the oat and at tne
outset gained a lead of three runs. After
Leonard had been retired, Gana singled to
left and Hanley got a life on Iberg's error,
Zann going to second. Tillson then forced
Zann at third, but gained first on the
play. Doyle, Scott and "Ittg Bell" Brown
followed with a single each, scoring Han
ley, Tillson and Doyle. Delmas retired
the side by striking out.
in their half of the first the local men
made two runs on errors by Doyle and
Tillson, Krug'soutand Umpire Sharkey's
skillful stop of the ball thrown by Pitcher
Doyle.
In the second, Oakland gathered in two
more runs on a base on balls, two errors
and one hit. At this point it looked as
though it was going to be an amateurish
sort of game, in which errors would be the
princpal factors. Everybody was agreea
bly surprised, however, for the two teams
now got down to hard work and but two
runs were made during the rest of the
afternoon.
The home team got one man around the
bases in the fourth. Murphy was hit by a
pitched ball and scored on singles by
Swett and Iberg. The visitors scored their
other run in the eighth on McCarthy's
single, two sacrifice hits and Smith's er
ror.
Delmas, the Oakland right fielder, dis
tinguished himself by two splendid run
ning catches of what looked like safe hits.

DROWNED IN THE BAY.
Fred Western Fell From the Schooner
lolumbuii to Hit Death.
As Fred Western, a sailor, was repairing
the bowsprit of the scow-schooner Colum
bus, anchored off Black Point, yesterday
morning, he missed his footing and fell
into the bay. A ttrong tide was running,
and as Western was unable to swim he
was soon carried quite a distance from the
schooner.
He called for help and Captain George
Fenden, who was below at the time of the
accident, bearing the shouts, rushed on
deck and threw a life-preserver to the
drowning man. Western, however, had
become exhausted through his struggles
in the water, and just as he was about to
grasp the life-buoy he collapsed and sank.
The captain in the meantime had pro
cured a boat and a grappling-iron, but his
efforts to save the unfortunate seaman
were without avail.
The case was reported to the Coroner's
office last evening by Captain Roberts, who
will take charge of the body in case it is
recovered.

CORBETT REPEATS
"SHARKEY'S A DUB."
The Champion Says He
Will Prove It in
the Ring.
'TIS ONLY SMALL TALK.
But the Sailor Lad Is Inclined
to Take It Quite Se
riously.
IS TJBUSED TO PLEASANTRIES.
He Threatens to Thrash Corbett in
His Hotel Apartment If He
Does Not C?ase.
Thomas Sharkey, in a resplendent suit
of pearl-gray, an immaculate shin front
bedecked with diamonds, was kep: busy
yesterday afternoon dodging baseballs
while he umpired a game at the new ball
grounds on Folsom street.
His new calling, coming so fast on the
heels of his debut last Friday night as an
actor, left him in a quasi-muddled mental
condition worse than when Jim Corbett
raised a "mouse" over his right eye in
their memorable four-round "go" at the
Pavilion.
He did not care to discuss pugilism to
any great extent when seen last evening,
excepting to reiterate that he was not go
ing to "lick" anybody for six months ex
cepting Jim Corbett, and if the latter
gentleman did not mind his p's and q's he
might not stand his abuse that long.
It is evident in many ways that Sharkey
is not yet a full-fledged prize-fighter. He
does not yet trrasp the idea that the deens
of the pugilistic faculties must not neces
sarily restrict their qualifications to
thumping an opponent into insensibility.
He does not know that the best of his
class must learn to not get ancry when
called a "liar," "cur," "pup," "dub" and
the like. Instead, the greatest generals in
"pugdom" have for many decades not only
fought with their fists, but stood abuse,
and showed their superiority by winding
all comers with hot. scorching words.
Jim Corbett, on the other hand, knows
more than Sharkey. He has hed a few
years standing the abuse of John L. Sulli
van and Charley Mitchell, both of wliom
he severely punished when he got them in
a 24-foot ring for using his name in vain.
He has likewise had to stand the abuse of
"Lanky Bob" Fitzsimmons, whom he has
chased away into England, and whom he
hopes to some day catch and spank. So
he knows something about these little
amenities of the squared ring.
Yesterday he laughed right heartily
when informed of what Sharkey was say
ing about him. It is not a laughing mat
ter either; for Sharkey has declared if
Corbett calls him a 'dub" again, or any
other such name, he will seek him in the
seclusion of his apartment at the St.
Nicholas and administer to him such a
physical chastisement as he deems will fi;
the alleged insult
"Sharkey's crazy," he said. "He won't
do anything of the kind. I called him a
'dub,' and he is a 'dub.' I will prove him
he's a 'dub' the next time we meet in the
ring."
In the meantime Corbett will leave here
to-morrow for Bartlett Springs with his
mother, sister and wife. The stay there
will not be less than two weeks, after
which he will return ami leave for As
bury Park, his regular training quarters.
DID NOT MAKE A RUN.
The Caltfornlas Badly Beaten by
the Paciflcs at Presidio Park.
The fact that James J. Corbett played
first base for the Pacifies against the Cali
fornias brought out a couple of thousand
people to witness the game at the Presidio
Athletic grounds yesterday afternoon.
To the baseball devotee there was little
of interest in the game, but it must be un
derstood that the engaging of the cham
pion pugilist to play ball was not intended
to bring out baseball cranks but rather
their fellow-wheelsmen and women daft
on pugilistic hero-worship.
There were by far more ladies than gen
tlemen in attendance, and the small ob
trusive boy outnumbered both.
Whether it was that the champion pu
gilist was in the nine pitted against them,
and that they were awed by his presence,
the Californias played execrable ball.
Klopf, the pitcher, did well or rather as
well as could be expected against a fairiy
strong battery and a dastardly support.
His outfield muffed aud fumbled to the
evident delight of the crowd that seemed
to delight in the errors. Buckley, in cen
terfield, was the only other redeeming
feature of the nine.
The Californias made a goose egg in the
way of scores and sixteen errors.
The Pacifies made eight runs and only
four errors. The score:
