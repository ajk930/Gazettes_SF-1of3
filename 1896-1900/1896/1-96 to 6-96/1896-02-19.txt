VOLUME LXXIX.-NO. 81.
HUNTINGTON AN
ARTFUL DODGER
But He Squirms Under the
. Hot Fire of Morgan's
Questions.
THOSE BURNED BOOKS.
Managers of the Contract and
Finance Company Took No
Chances.
FRYE COULD NOT SAVE COLLIS.
Clever as He Is, the Railroad Magnate
Makes Some Very Peculiar
Admissions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 18.-The
examination of President Collis P. Hunt
ington of the Southern Pacific Railway,
by Senator Morgan, was resumed this
morning before the Senate Pacific Railraods
Committee. Morgan directed his line of in
quiry toward the relations between the
Contract and Finance Company and the
Central Pacific, and the destruction of the
books of the former company.
The books ware burned, Mr. Hunting
ton said, because the company was disin
corporated and there was no use in keep
ing them, as the accounts were closed.
He said he had suggested to Mark Hop
kins that the books be destroyed, but did
not remember that there nad been any
reference in his conversation with Hop
kins to the clause in the California con
stitution regarding the personal liability
of stockholders. Such a matter as that
would, he said, have been referred to the
legal department of the road.
Senator Morganâ Did any lawyer advise
you to destroy these papers?
Mr. Huntingtonâ l think not. It was a
mere casual matter. We did not regard it
as serious.
Senator Morgan lt becomes serious
here. I should like very much to have
the books here now.
Mr. Huntingtonâ l should like very
much for you to have them, but in view of
the fact that they are not in existence I
don't see how in the world you are going
to get at them.
Morgan then read the resolutions
adopted at tbe mass-meeting held recently
in San Francisco to protest to Congress j
against the extension of the debt of the j
Pacific railroads, and Mr. Huntington said
it must have been a very large and enthu- !
siastic meeting, for he had been informed j
there were just fifty-two persons present j
at what he termed the Sutro meeting. J
The call had been issued to all the coun- j
ties in the State,. and but five of them were I
represented there. Tie representation
was largely confined to San Francisco and
Oakland.
Morgan having mentioned the names of
James H. Barry, Charles C. Terrill and
John M. Reynolds as members of the
anti-funding committee appointed at a
meeting held in San Francisco fast year,
Mr. Huntington said contemptuously that
lie wondered whether they were on the tax
list of San Francisco.
"They may not be," Senator Morgan
said, "but you know that it is written that
the poor shall inherit the" kingdom of
heaven."
"I no not know," Mr. Huntington re
marked in an indifferent way.
"And I expect you will never find out,"
the Senator remarked.
"We will see," said Mr. Huntington,
hopefully.
"Yes, we will see," Senator Morgan said.
"Do you know either of these gentlemen?"
he asked.
"I do not know that 1 do," said Mr.
Huntington. "I take it they are not
among the merchants or bankers of San
Francisco."
"They may be common people," Senator
Morgan remarked. .
In the same connection Morgan spoke
of the earnestness of the protest coming
from San Francisco.
"There is nothing in it," Mr. Hunting
ton said, "hall so earnest as Adolph Sutro
was when he told me that if I did not
build a road to. his place, where he has a
drinking-saioon, a bathhouse, a gambling
house and rooms upstairs, and build it
right at once, he would fight me in Wash
ington and fight me everywhere. That
was an earnest matter."
Huntington afterward spoke of Messrs.
Sutro, Estee, Cannon, Gibson and others
as being "as uncanny a crowd as a farmer
ever found in his henroost at night. All
these charges emanated from the same
parties," he said.
Morgan, recurring to the building of
several branch roads by the construction
companies, asked how one of the roads
was paid for. "
"By issuing bonds. They were very
nice : bonds," said Huntington.
"i don't care whether they were very
nice or not," snapped Morgan. "Confine
yourself to answering my questions."
[Laughter.]
Again Huntington said he could not re
member exactly how much it cost to build
the Copperopolis branch.
"No. of course not," said Morgan; "your
memory is very bad. You have a way of
not remembering and of saying 'I think'
and "don't know.' Why can't you state a
lew facts?"
Recurring to the destruction of books
of the Contract and Finance Company
Senator Morgan intimated his belief they
had been destroyed so tbat the directors
could not be held liable.
"No," said Huntington. "They were
burned, as I remember it, to make room,
and because the company having been dis
banded there was no further use for them,
It was no serious matter to do so, we
thought at that time."
Senator Morgan said: "You may find
that it is serious before you get through
with it."
"I wish to state," said Huntington,
"that no conversation passed between my
self and Mark Hopkins about destroying
The San Francisco Call.
books in order to shield us from personal
liability."
At another point in the examination
Huntington boasted that the roads con
structed by him in the West had "built up
the country."
Morganâ Yes, and you got very rich out
of your benevolence, did you not?
Huntingtonâ Well, I may not be as
benevolent as some but I meant well and
thought I was doing a big thing to build
up the Western country. I have oiun
parted with my money very easily â
Morgan (interrupting) â You can spare
us that eulogy on your own generosity.
We do not care to hear it. Of course we
know it was not money you were after,
but you worked for glory.
Huntington â No, sir. I have never
worked very much for glory. [Laughter.]
Soon afterward Senator Morgan forced
Huntington to admit that Stubbs, as joint
agent for the Southern Pacific and Central
Pacific.* could divert traffic from the Cen
tral to the Southern route, unless shippers
otherwise directed.
Mdrgan â Then Mr. Stubbs could have
sent most all of the freight over your
Southern route to the impoverishment of
the Central road if he bad wished?
Huntingtonâ Well, no, you see, that is,
I suppose
Morgan (interrupting) You must not
try and get away from the facts and don't
base your statement on mere suppositions.
We want facts. Now, you admit you were
heavily interested in the Southern Pacific
and only had about 4000 or 5000 shares of
the Central Pacific stock.
"I think about that much," replied
Huntington.
Morgan â You think so. Don't you
know? You seem to know very little
about your own business.
Huntingtonâ lt is difficult to remember
so far back.
Morganâ Well, you think you had that
much and admit you had heavier interests
in the Southern Pacific. You have been
vice-president and president of the South
ern Pacific and Centrall Pacific companies?
Huntington Yes.
Morganâ Has it not been your policy to
send as much freight as possible over the
Southern Pacific? -
Huntingtonâ We have shipped much
heavy stuff over the Southern route, but
forty-nine out of fifty cars have gone over
the Central route. I have been ambitious
to encourage fruit-growing and to give
them as good rates as possible, so much so
that New Jersey and Delaware fruit
growers have complained that cheap in
troduction of California fruit into these
States damages the business. Rates over
neither of our roads have been high, only
twelve mills per ton per mile for freight j
and less than two cents per mile for pas
sengers.
Morgan â The Southern Pacific is a very
much longer line than the Central Pa
ne?
Huntington â Yes, sir; almost twice as
far from San Francisco to New Orleans
than from San Francisco to Ogden.
Morganâ Your interest was then to se
cure the long haul if you could? Would
you have dismissed Mr. Stubbs if he had
not sent considerably more traffic via the
Southern than by the Central route? ;
Huntingtonâ No, I think not. "yV i'-y
Morganâ But you would have lost money
by his so doing, and you certainly would
not keep an employe who caused you such
financial loss. The two roads were com
petitors, were they not?
Huntingtonâ Yes, to a certain extent.
Morganâ How much did the Southern
Pacific formerly pay for its lease of the
Central road.
Huntingtonâ We paid $1,300,000 per
year, but when we ascertained that the
Central road could not earn enough to
pay us back tbat amount the agreement
was made that the Southern Pacific should j
not pay more than tbe Central earned per
year.
Morganâ Did not the Central Pacific
earnings decrease because your agents
diverted traffic to your own road, the
Southern Pacific?.
Huntingtonâ No. The results shrank as
a result of competition of the overland
roads.
Morganâ But how do you account for
the fact that Southern Pacific rates did not
shrink also? ; \ y
Huntington â I do not know.
Morganâ Was it not to your interest to,
divert traffic to the southern route?
Huntingtonâ l always wanted to be
fair â Ay" â 
Morgan (interrupting) â I am not asking
about your great generosity. That is very
well known (sarcastically).
Morgan inquired about Huntington's
Atlantic steamships, and whether these
lines were not established in the interest
of the Southern Pacific.
Huntington â Yes, sir.
Morgan â Now, what have you ever done
to get business for the Central Pacific route ?
You say you have been its chief executive
officer.
Huntington â Well, we had our agents in
New York â y-
Morgan â I am not asking about your
agents. I am inquiring about your own
individual efforts.
Huntingtonâ Oh, I never solicit any
freight or Â« passenger business myself.
[Laughter.]
Morganâ Oh, don't be so narrow, Mr.
Huntington. You understand well enough
what I mean. Then you haven't made
any personal efforts to build up the Cen
tral road?
Huntington â Ob, yes; I have improved
the roadbed, rolling stock, laid new rails,
and â
Morgan (interrupting)â l am not speak
ing of the physical road, and you know
it. I shall assume that your attempts at
evasion are sufficient answers to my ques
tions.
Huntingtonâ The executive department
of a railroad has nothing to do with select
ing traffic.
Morgan â Now, will you answer my ques
tion or not? What have you, individually,
ever done to extend traffic over the Central
Pacific, as you have done oyer the South
ern Pacific?
Huntingtonâ l have kept the road in
good condition.
Morganâ You made contracts for steam
ers to feed tbe Southern route? --".â¢â¢'.>-.*
Huntingtonâ Yes, sir.
Morganâ Did any of that freight from
Europe go over the Central route?
Huntington (innocently) No, Senator,
for our ocean going boats cannot run from
New Orleans to Omaha.
Morganâ Who established those steam
ers? .-'-. -y "
Huntingtonâ Well, we directors of â
Morgan (interrupting)â But didn't you
on yesterday claim great credit for your
self because of the establishment of this
line of steamers?
Huntingtonâ l said that we had some
I very fine steamers.
SAN FRANCISCO, MORNING, FEBRUARY 19, 1896.
Morgan â You cannot evade my question
in that way. That won't do at all.
Huntington â I had long tried to estab
lish a good line of steamers between New.
York and Liverpool. ..':'Â»â 
Morganâ ln the interest of the Southern
Pacific? -Â ! â ;"; . y' ;
Huntingtonâ To a certain extent.
Morgan â But you can't say what you
have done for the Central Pacific. Did you
expect the latter road to prosper when you
did nothing for it and everything for its
competitor, the Southern route?
Huntingtonâ The Central Pacific is in
very good physical condition. Forty-nine
fiftieths of the fruit lias been sent over it.
Huntington indignantly denied the as
sertion made at the convention in San
Francisco to the effect that he, Stanford,
j Hopkins and Crocker had made $200,000,
--000.
He denounced it as a lie, as well as the
assertion that they had derived from the
City and County, State and general
sources four times as much as it cost to
construct the road. . . _
Morgan inquired how much . money
earned in railroading had been put into
the roads. >';â  *J y
Huntingtonâ l think I was worth about
a million dollars when I commenced rail
roading, but after completing the Central
Pacific I was considerably poorer on ac
, count of the heavy accumulation of debts.
Senator Morgan inquired about the con
tract of the railroad with the Pacific Mail
steamers, via Panama. *_-*
Huntington said $75,000 had been paid
them, and this contract continued three
years. Itwasdonein order to keep rates
uniform and in a measure prevent rate
cutting.
Morgan â But you, as guardian and prin
cipal executive officer, have never done
anything lor the Central road?
Huntingtonâ l think my management
of the road has been very fair. I know
that I made money out of the Chesapeake
and Ohio, Big Sandy and- other roads in
Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and
Tennessee, after they had been abandoned
by others, but I lost money in construct
ing the Central Pacific.
As to the proposition for the settlement
of the Central Pacific to the Government
Huntington professed the willingness and
desire of the company to pay every dollar
of it on an extension of 100 years at 2 per
cent, but would not admit that there was
any liability on the company to pay inter
est on the interest payments heretofore
made by the Government.
Morganâ l guess we have heard enough
for to-day.
Huntingtonâ Can't you hear me an hour
longer?
Morgan â No, sir.
Huntingtonâ Can't you hold night ses
sions? I have important business in New
York. â¢_ â¢, '. ..,;.-â 
Morgan â No; I don't propose to sit at
night. I work hard enough now for my
salary. lam not made of steel or railroad

WJLL J.OSE THE CHARTER. â -
But Huntington's Men Will Fight Des
perately All the Same.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 17.â There is
no legislative move more preferable
to the professional * lobbyist than to
smother an obnoxious; measure and lull it
to sleep by delay.
Every day it becomes more apparent
that the enemies the bill for the repeal
of the Southern Pacific charter are pursu
ing these old tactics, and it has been their
only effective fight against the measure. >

AN OLD MAN'S REVERIE.
" I really can't remember."
SIXTY MINERS
ARE ENTOMBED.
Most Disastrous Explosion
of Firedamp in a
Coal Pit.
NO HOPE FOR WORKMEN.
All Those Laboring Underneath
the Ground Meet Death
Instantly.
WRECKED AND SET ON FIRE.
The Vulcan Mine at Newcastle, Colo.,
Will Have to Be Abandoned '
to the Flames.
NEWCASTLE, Colo., Feb. 13.â The Vul
can coal mine, located in the hogback, just
below town; was completely wrecked and
set on fire by a terrific gas explosion shortly
after 11' o'clock to-day and all the work
men in the mine were instantly killed.
About sixty men, including foremen and
coal operators, were in the several rooms
along the slope when the disaster occurred,
and so severe was the explosion that not a
single man could have survived the shock
or - the fire which ; immediately ensued.
The old Vulcan mine was abandoned some
years ago because of fire, and this new
mine will doubtless share a similar fate.
With the exception of a few bosses the
killed are Italians, but in the confusion
and excitement of the day it has been im
possible at this time to make a complete
roster of the names of the unfortunates.
The town of Newcastle was shaken as if
by an earthquake by the explosion, and a
dense black cloud obscuring the site of
the Vulcan mine and workings indicated
only too plainly what had occurred. The
entire population rushed to the scene to
behold the surface workmen in the midst
of a thick cloud of dust trying in vain to
start the work of rescuing their unfortu
nate fellow-laborers within.
, The earth had settled perceptibly about
the hillside, and the dense mass of black
smoke issuing from crevices in the up
heaved mass gp.ve evidence that the coal
vein had surely been set on fire by the
explosion. Women and children rushed
shrieking and screaming to the scene,
adding to the confusion. The mine
owned by the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company, two and a half miles away, was
promptly closed down, and all hands
hastened to assist Superintendent Herrcke
of the Vulcan in the work of rescue, but it
was quickly seen that little could be
done. â¢ â  . â¢
Herrcke with several men had torn
away the * broken ; timbers at the landing,
and had rushed into the slope soon after
the explosion occurred with wet sponges
on their lostrils, only to be driven back
again by the deadly fumes. . "'â 
A special train was sent to the mine by
the Colorado Midland Railway Company
with medical ; assistance, prepared *.' to'care
for the wounded if { any were rescued,' but
the sun went down behind the mountains
before any progress could be made.
The force of the explosion may be
imagined when it :is known that the
BulTdihgs'and trestle at the mouth of the
slope were "completely wrecked, a hole 100
feet square carved out of the hillside at
the mouth of the incline, while timbers
two feel square were blown into the Grand
River, 400 feet away. One miner was on
his way down the slope when the explo
sion occurred, and his mangled remains
were subsequently found several hundred
feet away from the mouth of the slope.
- There were 140 men employed in and
about the mine at the time, and about
sixty were at work under ground this
morning. The present Vulcan mine has
been opened only about two years. State
Coal Mine Inspector Griffith was here
â¢February 8, and pronounced the mine in
better condition than it had ever been be
fore. An immense fan in the slope, which
was about 500 feet; in depth, seemed to
afford complete ventilation, and every pos
sible precaution was taken to prevent an
explosion of the gas known to exist in the
mines of this district. â  < â¢
It. is believed that a half-lighted fuse
ignited the gas in one of the new rooms
while the men were blasting down coal.
The old, Vulcan mine has been abandoned
for, several years and was in no way con
nected with the present property, a new
slope having been driven into the hillside.
The Vulcan Fuel Company operates the
property, which is owned- by the Atchi
son, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Com
pany, with headquarters at Topeka, Kans.
Just at this time the mine was being
worked to its full capacity, the output
being from seventeen to twenty cars per
day.
The entire slope is filled with debris, and
it is now plainly evident that many days
must elapse before the bodies of the en
tombed" miners can be rescued. Since
darkness fell the smoke seems to have per
ceptibly diminished, and it may be that
the fire will not destroy the, property as
was first feared earlier in the day, but the
force of the explosion was sufficient in
itself to practically destroy the mine, and
new workings will have to be started.
â¢ The latest estimates place the number of
men in the mine at sixty or more, and not
one escaped death.
The names of the company men were
only known to . the pit boss, James Har
rison, whose body lies with his dead com
rades in the bottom of the ill-fated mine,
and can- only be ascertained by the re
covery of the bodies. From the lamp list
and information gained from those above
ground, the following thirty-eight are posi
tively known to be among the killed;
James Harrison, pit boss ; \ Tom Larrigan,
fire boss; three brothers, Joe, William and
Abe Dore; Peter Patricio, Daniel Morris,
Gabriel Gleese, Frank Rossio, Baptisto
Chowcett, August Matteve, John Scaif,
Alex Scaif. Philip Racha, Peter Brewer,
Frederic Sigmond, Antonio Patricio, John
Pactori, John Coughlan, William Webb,
William Haggerty, Dominic Matteno,
Frank McGourly, Robert Cattle Jr., Alex
Reno, Frank Simonic, Robert Seitiger,
Jacob /Jenkins, .'Domino Ozello, John
Oteno, James Fraegna, Domino Possetti,
Peter Tappero, Antonio Tappero, Andrew
Rolando, Peter Magento, Antonio Martino
and David Evans.
Most of these men leave large families.

CUTTERS AND TRIMMERS STRIKE.
It Is Expected That Nearly Fifteen Thou-
sand Clothing - Worker* Will
Soon Quit Work.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 18.â Hiisch, Elson
& Co., clothing-manufacturers, to-day re
ported that nearly 100 more men had
joined the striking cutters and trimmers
since yesterday. The situation is so seri
ous that within forty-eight hours a general
strike of the Clothing-cutters' and Trim
mers' Union, involving 12,000 >to 15,000
workmen and women, is expected by the
union men as well as by the employers.
C. P. Kcllog & Co. were unable to operate
their establishments to-day because twen
ty-five men joined the strikers. The same
number walked out of Guthman, IThlman
& Silberman's factory, and smaller num
bers quit work in other factories. Hiirch,
Elson & Co. expect all their 400 employes
to be on strike to-morrow night, when a
decisive meeting of the union will be held
as to calling a general strike.
Cutters and trimmers want the manu
facturers to keep the agreement made with
the union as to hours and wages and shop
regulations, while the employers say that
they are simply resisting the arbitrary
edicts of the union and intend to say here
after what wages they shall pay and the
hours their men shall work.
WEDDED AT CASTLE HILL.
Mrs. Amelie Rives-Cbanler Becomes the
Wife of Prince Troubetzkoi
or Russia.
RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 18.â At Castle
Hill, Albemarle County, the home of the
bride, Mrs. Amelie Rives-Cbanler, the
authoress, was at 3 o'clocK to-day married
to Prince Troubetzfeoi, a Russian noble
man. The affair was very quiet and great
efforts were made to keep tne time of the
event from the public.
The ceremony was performed by Rev.
Paul L. Menzel, D.D., of this city, a Gei
man Lutheran minister, and was accord
ing to the form of the Episcopal church.
Miss Gertrude Rives, sister of the bride,

mony.
The groom arrived at Castle Hill about
a weeK ago. The couple will remain at
Castle Hill until the 29th inst. and then
sail for Europe.
TWO INDIANS FREEZE, TO DEATH.
Winnebagos Drink Too Much Firewater and
Wander Away on the Prairie .
to Perish. '
PENDER, Nebr., Feb. 18.â News was re
ceived this evening that three Indians,
living in the vicinity of Big Horse Wawa
ba's farm on the Winnebago reservation,
secured two or three gallons of whisky at
Pender yesterday, and after filling them
selves with liquor proceeded to have an
old-time war-dance, stripping to the skin
for that purpose. After thoroughly ex
hausting themselves they fell in a drunken
stupor and finally wandered out some dis
tance on. the prairie, where they were
found by a party of white men, frozen to
death. The inside facts are hard to ascer
tain, owing to those interested wishing to
cover the matter up. Bootleggers, it is
claimed, furnished the whisky.
CARNEGIE BLACKBALLED.
The Pittsburg Millionaire Shut
Out of the Cleveland Cham
ber of Commerce.
Refused Honorary Membership and
Denounced as an Oppressor
of the Poor.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Feb. 18.â Andrew
Carnegie, the Pittsburg millionaire, was
refused honorary membership in the
Cleveland Chamber of Commerce to-night.
Mr. Carnegie has long been an active cor
respondent of the chamber and has spoken
before it on two occasions. The cause of
his turndown has created a sensation in
this city.
When J. W. Cowles presented Carnegie's
name L. A. Russell delivered a bitter
speech against Carnegie, whom he de
nounced as an oppressor of the poor and
challenged any one to dispute the state
ment.
The Chamber of Commerce is a dignified
body, but the scene which ensued was
much like a squabble in a political conven
tion. Some business men sided with Car
negie, but more opposed him.
Amid much confusion a secret ballot
was ordered, with the result, as announced
by President Wilson M. Day of the cham
ber, that Andrew Carnegie had been black
balled from membership in the Cleveland
Chamber of Commerce.
The action of the chamber is an immense
surprise to the general public, as it was
supposed the business men here looked
upon Carnegie a3 a sort of commercial
demi-god.
DOWN AN EMBANKMENT.
Wreck of a Passenger Train on the Ver-
Mont Central Road.
BELLOWS FALLS, Vt., Feb. 18.â A
passenger train on the Central Vermont
road went down a forty-foot embankment
near Ludlow, Vt., this morning. A num
ber of trainmen and passengers were seri
ously injured.
The wreck was caused by a broken rail.
The baggage-car, mail-car and one coach
went down the embankment and were
smashed. The engine was left on the ties.
Six or eight passengers, besides the
trainmen,. were hurt. - The most seriously
injured is T. J. Baker, employed by tbe
railroad as a carpenter, and it is doubtful
if he can live. This is the third train. to
go off the track within twenty-four hours
within a mile of this place. The rails are
damaged by the excessive cold.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
BRADY MAKES A
FULL CONFESSION.
The Ex-Bandit Describes in
Detail the Yolo Train
Robbery.
SACKS OF GOLD CACHED.
Found the Money Missing When
They Returned to Take
It Away.
FELL INTO HARMEN'S HANDS.
Sensational Evidence at the Examina
tion of the Man Who Squandered
the Loot.
SACRAMENTO, Cat... Feb. 18.â The
examination of John P. Harmen, ' the
tramp who found the loot of the Yolo
train robbery, and who had been posing as
an embryo millionaire in San Francisco
until captured in that, city "ten days ago,
was commenced in Judge Henry's court
10-day. The proceedings created more
than ordinary Interest from the fact that
Brady, one of the participants in the rob
bery, who was brought down from the
Folsom penitentiary to testify, made a
confession of the manner in which the
robbery was performed and detailed in
full all the incidents which occurred.
This is the first time Brady admitted com
plicity in the robbery.
A large crowd was in attendance at the
hearing. The defendant, who is repre
sented by ex-Senator F. S. Sprague, is a
short, stocky, well-dressed man, whose
face indicates that he possesses more than
usual cunning. His hair is gray and
scant, and he wears gold-rimmed glasses
that tend to give him a rather aristocratic
air. The morning session was consumed
in hearing the testimony of the various
agents of Wells Fargo & Co. as to the
amount of coin that had been shipped
on the train that was stopped, and the
story of J, D. Paige, the express messen
ger on the train.
In the afternoon Convict Brady made
his appearance in the courtroom and was
placed upon the stand. He testified tbat bis
name was Harry Williams, but tbat he
was better known as Jack .Brady, gave his
present residence as Folsom, and then
continuing he said:
"On the night of the 11th of October I
and a man named Brown held up tho
overland train about six miles from Sacra
mento, in the direction of Davisville. We
had secreted our arms the night before
near the scene where the robbery took
place and left the city shortly before dark
to walk to the spot. On the way
we met and stopped a trackwalker, who
we stood up, and after taking his watch
and money we made him stop the train.
He did so, not daring to resist, as he was
almost frightened to death.
"Brown went on one side of the train
and lon the other. I heard Brown say:
'Come out of that, you!' and then saw the
engineer get down from the engine. Then
I made the fireman get down and we all
went back to the express car. We told the
messenger to open the door, but he refused
and began firing through the door. Then
Brown and I fired back through the door,
and in a minute or so the messenger
seemed to think better of it and opened up.
Then we all piled into the car, and while I
held the messenger up Brown went
through the local boxes. Then we com
pelled the messenger to open the safe and
Brown took out four sacks of money, and
while doing it the messenger looked at
him, and Brown said: 'Turn around there
or I'll fix you,' and he obeyed.
"We took six packages in all, making
the engineer and fireman carry them to
the engine, which we uncoupled from the
train. Then we got on the locomotive
and pulled out. We kept going until we
came to a sign which said, 'One mile to
the drawbridge.' Here we stopped, took
the money off and then, reversing the en
gine, sent her back toward the train. We
then went into the thick brush a short dis
tance, dug a hole and planted the larger
sacks, retaining the smaller one, which
contained about $1600 or $1700. Then we
hid our rifles about twenty or thirty feet
from where we buried the stuff and
skipped.
"At that time we both had bicycles and
had no trouble in getting away. We came
back six different times after hiding the
money, but of course could get no trace of
it. We always came on bicycles, conceal
ing them in the brush while prosecuting
our search."
After being arrested Brady had gone to
the spot where the money had been
secreted with Detective Thacker. He then,
by aid of a rough diagram, showed where
the robbery had occurred and the money
been secreted, claiming that he had been
told by the real robber. The hiding-place
of the money was just 150 steps from the
track. On the stand to-day Brady said
that be and Brown had carefully laid their
plans for the robbery, but were greatly
surprised to find they had captured such a
large amount. He bad shot into the car
for the purpose of frightening the messen
ger and with no idea of hitting him, as it
would do no good to do that. '
While he was testifying Brady acted as
though he was proud of being a train-rob
ber and rather enjoyed the notoriety he
had achieved. He appears hale and hearty,
as though prison life agreed with him, and
he showed no hesitancy in answering any
questions which were propounded to him.
Ex-Senator Sprague, who is conducting
Harmen's defense, is in doubt as to
whether he will introduce any testimony
on the part of the defense or not, and the
examination will probably be concluded
to-morrow.

Gorman Says the Expenditure
Hangs Like a Pall Over
the Country.
VILAS' AMENDMENT BEATEN.
Rather Sharp Talk Relating to Bond
Issues and Debts of Pacific
Railroads.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. IS.â The
fact that the House, when it rejected the
Senate free-currency amendment to the
bond bill, did not accompany its message
to that effect with a request for a confer
ence was brought up in the Senate to-day
by Alien (Pop.) of Nebraska, and he sug
gested to the Finance Committee whether
the occasion was not a good one to bring
about an agreement on the subject be
tween the two bouses. He was informed
by the chairman of the Finance Commit
tee, Morrill of Vermont, that the com
mittee was waiting for some action on the
part of the House, and he was reminded
by Chandlerâ a facetious wayâ that he
(Allen) could -move that the Senate recede
from its amendment. Alien also had
something more to say about the failure
of the Pacific Railroad Committee, which
is now having hearings as to the adjust
ment of the debt of the Pacific railroad to
the Government, not having specially re
quested the officers of the Farmers' Alli
ance in Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado
and the owners of stockyards in Omaha to
appear and present their views.
The chairman of the committee (Gear)
said that general notice had been given
through the press associations and added
that the committee* had no official knowl
edge of such organizations.
The resolution offered some time ago by
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas for a special com
mittee to inquire into the circumstances of
the recent bond issue was taken up and
discussed until the close of the morning
hour, when, under the rules, it went on the
calendar.
The military academy bill was then
taken up, considered for three hours and
passed. The amendment offered yesterday
by Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin for two addi
tional cadets at large from each State was
defeated.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska before the
journal was approved called attention to
the fact that the Record this morning
stated that the House had refused to con
cur in the Senate amendment to the House
bond bill and that the House had not
asked for a conference on the mat As
far as his knowledge went this was the first
instance where a conference had not been
asked. He thought it a proper time to ask
the Finance Committee if an effort would
be made to bring about an agreement
between the two houses on this bill.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont, chairman of
the Finance Committee, stated that the
committee was waiting for some action on
the part of the House.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire made
a facetious parliamentary inquiry as to
whether it would be in order for the Sen
ator from Nebraska to move that the Sen
ate should recede from its amendment or
whether he would be obliged to wait until
the bill came back from the House.
The journal was then approved. j
Gear (R.) of lowa, chairman of the Pa- !
cific Railroad. Committee, referring to a
complaint made a few days since' by Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska, that the committee
had not invited or summoned the patrons
of the Pacific railroads to appear and
make their statements, said that notice
had been given through the press associa
tions of the country and that every person,
whether bondholder, stockholder or pa
tron had full notice of the hearings. No
body had been specially requested to he
present except two gentlemen. A gentle
man representing the reorganization com
mittee of the Union Pacific (Mr. .Fierce)
had come and presented its scheme and
gentlemen not connected with the rail
roads in any caDacity had come of their
own accord and been heard by the com
mittee.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska said the invi
tation ought not to be confined to persons
connected with the Union Pacific or the
Central Pacific. The city â¢of Omaha had
the third largest if not the second largest
stockyards in the world and were much
interested in railroad rates, and he thought
special invitations ought to be sent to
them.laWÃHijÃl
"What information have you," Gear
asked, "that these gentlemen in Omaha
want to come before the committee?"
"They are patrons of the roads," said
Allen.
"And you infer that they want to be
beard?" said Gear.
1 "I do not infer it; I know it," Allen re
plied. "The Farmers' Alliances in Ne
braska, Kansas and Colorado want to be
heard before the Pacific Railroad Commit
tee."
"The committee has no official knowl
edge of such organizations," Gear said.
"That will not do," put in Allen scorn
fully, "it has actual knowledge,"
Wolcott (R.) of Colorado, a member of
the committee, said there was no danger
that men who had schemes to present in
reference to the railroad companies would
not come before the committee. One
/nan had taken up the time of the com
mittee for nearly two days advocating the
transfer of the sinking fund of the Pacific
railroad companies to build a line of 250
miles from Sioux City to North Platte.
Members of the Farmers' Alliance to
which Alien referred would probably re
pudiate the idea of coming at the Govern
ment's expense. The Senator from Ne
braska certainly did not expect to see the
committee subpena them at Government
expense. They could come and would be
heard by the committee. The committee
had heard for two days a gentleman (Mr.
Coombs) representing Sioux City.
"Where does he live?" Allen asked.
"I do not know," Gear replied. "All
over, I guess. His clients are 400 bankers
who have invested money in Sioux City
and North Platte, and have built a bridge
at Sioux City at a cost of $2,500,000. He
comes here of hi 9 own accord and makes
certain propositions to the committee."
"I know that man," said Allen; "he is a
broker."
"Oh, no," Frye remarked; "Mr. Coombs
is one of the ablest lawyers of New Eng
land."
"Law .is a side-issue with him," Allen
said. "He is a financial lawyer. He rep
resents 140 banks/in what is called tho
Credits Commutation Company."
After further discussion the matter
lapsed.
The resolution heretofore offered by Pef
fer for a select committee to inquire into
the circumstances of the recent bond issue
was laid before the Senate. Sherman (R.)
of Ohio moved the reference of the resolu-
tion to the Finance Committee. Peffer op
posed the motion and argued in favor of
the resolution.
Hill (D.) of New York was opposed,
from the information he had, to any in
vestigation of the. subject, either by the
Finance Committee or by a select com
mittee.
During a discussion Hill asked if the
Senate had not had enough experience at
investigating at the instance of irresponsi
ble persons, and he asked: "Has any
Senator made a charge in the present
case?"
"I make a charge now," Stewart (Pop.)
of Nevada interposed.
"The Senator will not make his charge
now," said Hill. "I will not yield to the
Senator to make a charge now. It comes
rather late. I was speaking of the author
of this resolution."
While Hill was speaking the hour of 2
o'clock arrived. The Senate then took up
the unfinished business, being the military
academy appropriation bill, but the dis
cussion was interrupted to receive the
urgent deficiency bill from the House and
its request for a conference. The Senate
insisted upon its amendment, and the re
quest was granted â Hall, Allison and
Cockrell being appointed managers on the
part of the Senate. An amendment was
offered by Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin to in
crease by ninety the number of West Point
cadets, and one by Sewell (R.) of New
Jersey to the effect that the President may
appoint to vacancies in the grade of second
lieutenant meritorious non-commissioned
officers of the army when recommended
according to the provisions of the act of
1873, although graduates of the military
academy may remain in service until as
signed.
Tillman (D.) of South Carolina called at
tention to the fact that the Government do
nates $15,000 every year to each of the land
grant colleges. These colleges were com
pelled to teach military tactics.and each one.
was presided over by a West Pointer. These
colleges, Tillman thought, were furnishing
all the military education the country
needed.
Gorman said the Senate had already
been criticized for its conduct in the mat
ter of appropriations. There had been
talk in the press of the Senate using hob
nailed shoes to ride roughshod over a co
ordinate branch. The Senate, he said,
would resent this. The Senate had the
right, and it was its duty, to amend appro
priation bills and make them sufficient to
meet the needs of the country. But the
Senate weakened its position when it pro
posed to amend an appropriation bill so as
to enable each Senator to name a cadet.
This amendment would, Gorman thought,
be misunderstood' everywhere. He ap
proved of an increase of appropriations
when the necessities of the Government
required it, and they were in conformity
with the law, but emphasized his disap
proval of the pending amendment.
Hawley and Hoar advocated the amend
ment, and Stewart, Teller and Call op
posed it.
After a three hours' debate by a vote of
24 ayes to 27 noes the Vilas amendment
providing for ninety additional cadets was
rejected.
The bill was then passed, and the pen
sion appropriation forthe coming fiscal
year was taken up.
The pension bill was passed as quickly as
the clerk could read itâ in less than eight
minutes. Gorman, with reference to this
bill, which carried an appropriation of
$142,000,000. saiiTit was one of those appro
priations which added to the great ex
penditures of the Government and hung
line a pall over the country. He recalled
the predict that he had heretofore made
that the receipts of the Government would
not meet its expenditures.
Call (D.) of Florida introduced a resolu
tion, which went over, directing the Secre
tary of the Treasury to dispose of the
lapsed bids in the recent bond sale to "the
highest bidder, including in the bids such
as have been received up to the time of the
passage of this resolution, when such bias
shall be opened by the Secretary of the
Treasury."
After a short executive session the Sen
ate at 5:45 p. si. adjourned until to-morrow.
REVOLUTIONARY DAUGHTERS.
Fifth Annual Congress of Some of the
Most Patriotic and Best Known
American Women.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.-The
fifth annual congress fof the Daughters of
the American Revolution began in this
city this morning behind closed doors.
There was a large attendance of bright
faced, intelligent ladies from nearly every
State in the Union. Mrs. John W. Foster
of Washington, as president-general, pre
sided. The principal features of to-day's
session Were the organization of the con
gress, the address of the president-gen
eral and the response thereto by Mrs.
Joshua Wilbur of Rhode Island. The
Church of Our Father, where the congress
is being held, is beautifully decorated,
principally by a skillful arrangements of
the National flag. The invocation was de
livered by Mrs. Harry Heth, wife of ' Gen
eral Heth. SESh
After the president's address had been
responded to, upon motion of Mrs. Donald
McLean of New York, the announcement
of executive sessions was stricken from
the programme of the congress, so it
would not appear that the meetings were
secret, The congress, alter hearing the
report of the credentials committee, ad
journed for luncheon.
At the afternoon session reports of offi
cers and committees were read. The even
ing session was in the nature of a musicale
in charge of the hymn committee, under
the direction of Mrs. Cuthbert Harrison.
Mrs. John R. McLean gave a reception
to-night to the president-general, ' Mrs.
John W. Foster, at the Arlington Hotel,
which was largely attended.
The Minority on Dupont.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 18.â The
minority report on the Dupont case was
laid before the Senate this morning by
Turpie (D.) of Indiana. It is signed by
the four Democratic members of the
committee. They deny the legality, of
the election of May 19, 1895, under which
Henry A. Dupont claims to have been
elected to the United States Senate, the
committee assuming the position that
Mr. Dupont was not, elected by the vote
then cast.

An Increase of Several Items
on the Big Bill >of
Appropriations.
TO CANCEL THE LAND PATENTS.
Amendments to the Bill Extending
the Time in Which Suits
Can Be Brought.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. IS. - The
House to-day, after three days' considera
tion of the agricultural appropriation bill,
finally disposed of it. The feature of the
debate to-day was the attack by Cousins
(R.) of lowa upon the methods of the Sec
retary of Agriculture in connection with
his refusal to carry out the law for the pur
chase and distribution of seeds, as provided
for in the appropriation acts of 1894 and
1895. He said the corrupted and subordi
nated commission appointed by the Sec
retary had, long in advance of the time
fixed for them to examine and report upon
the bids for supplying seeds to the depart
ment, informed inquirers that there would
be no distribution of seed, showing a pra
determinarion on his part to nullify the
law. The Government, Cousins said, was
no longer a Government for the people and
by the people, but a Government by J.
Pierpont Morgan and J. Sterling Morton.
Amendments incorporated in the bill
make it mandatory upon the Secretary to
purchase and distribute seed as had been
the custom prior to the suspension of the
practice last year, without reference to the
requirements of the statute that they
shall be "rare and uncommon" as that
phrase was construed by Secretary Mor
ton ; the appropriation for seed was, in
creased from $130,000 to $150,000, and the
seed division abolished by Secretary Mor
ton last year was rehabilitated with a full
quota of clerks to enable the Secretary to
execute the law. -~
' Among the miscellaneous business
transacted the House passed a resolution
introduced by Newlands (Silver) of Ne
vada directing the Committee on Ways
and Means to inquire into the effect upon
American industries of the difference of
exchange between countries having the
gold and silver standards of value and to
report by bill or otherwise.
The House entered upon the considera
tion of the bill to extend the time within
which the Government may bring suit to
recover title to lands illegally or erron
eously-patented, but adjourned without
coming to a vote. r." ff<^"f,-V
Several propositions were made to amend
the agricultural appropriation bill so as to
secure the desired distribution of seeds,
and after some discussion a combination
amendment was agreed upon. It directs
and requires the Secretary of Agriculture I
to purchase and distribute $130,000 worth!
of seeds, the best that he can procure,
without reference to the requirement of
the law, which says shall be "rare and un
common." It was because he could find
no "rare and uncommon" seeds that Sec
retary Morton decided not to distribute
any last summer and abolished the seed
distribution.
A motion by Piokler (R.) of South Da
kota increasing the appropriation for the
purchase of seeds fiom $130,000 to $150,000
was agreed toâ 7s to 13. ;yy
Cousins (R.) of lowa offered an amend
ment making the appropriation for seed
unavailable until the Secretary of Agricul
ture had expended the appropriation
made for seeds for the current year, and
making the appropriation for the salary of
the Secretary, except $75, unavailable
until he complied with this law. The
amendment was rejected on a point of
order as being new legislation. â¢
On motion of Baker (R.) of New Hamp
shire, the seed division of the Agricultural
Department was rehabilitated at a yearly
expense of $13,370, in order, as he ex
plained, that the Secretary might not be
enabled to to say that he could not carry
out the distribution of seeds for the reason
that he had not the force to do it. This
disposed of the seed matter.
The committee rose and the amend
ments made to the bill having been agreed
to, it was passed.
On motion by Doolittle (R.)of Washing
ton the printing of the report of the board
of engineers upon the Nicaragua canal,
sent to the House by the President a few
days ago, was ordered. %y^
Lacey (R.) of lowa called up the bill in
tended to carry out the suggestion of Presi
dent Cleveland in his message to Congress
that the time be extended in which to in
stitute suits to cancel land patents illegally
or erroneously issued.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa offered an amend
ment providing that all lands patented or
certified to any State, corporation or indi
vidual, under rulings or construction of
law of the Commissioner of the .General
Land Office or the Secretary of the Interior,
and when no fraud has been committed
by the patentees, shall be excepted from
the operation of the act, and also another
providing for the adjustment of railroad
land grants and for the forfeiture of â¢ un
earned land grants. â  \
Without disposing of the matter the
House, at 5 o'clock, on motion by Terry,
adjourned until to-morrow. yv : 'y
FOR A JOINT COMMISSION.
I Negotiations to Secure Needed Bering Sea
Regulations.
. WASHINGTON. D. C, >eb. 18.â An
interesting bit of diplomatic news was
made public, unofficially, by Assistant
Secretary Hamlin at to-day's meeting of
the House Committee on Ways and Means.
It was to the effect that the State Depart
ment is now in correspondence with the
British Foreign Office looking to the ap
pointment of a joint commission to in
vestigate all the conditions connected with
the fur seal industry in Bering Sea and to
consider and report what further regula
tions are necessary for their preservation.
In order that the worn of such a com
mission should be effective, it is desirable
that Russia and Japan may. also become
parties thereto, but consent, it is well
known, can be easily secured. .
Assistant- Secretary Hamlin appeared
before the commission with reference to
the Dingley bill creating a - joint - com
mission,- consisting of the foregoing
countries and for. the foregoing purposes,
the adoption of a modus Vivendi, pending
tne investigation of the commissiod, look
ing to the protection of the animals, or if
these efforts prove ineffective, permitting
this Government to kill seals of both sexes
on the Pribyloff islands, the proceeds to be
turned into the United States treasury.
PUBLIC SCHOOL LANDS.
Secretary Smith's Idea of Equalizing the
Claims of State*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 18.â The
Secretary of the Interior has seat to the
Senate Committee on Public Lands his
views on the bill to equalize the several
Stales of the Union in the grant of lands
for public school purposes. He says Cali
fornia has received as its portion 6,719,324
acres, and it would require 240,000,000 acres
to equalize grants to other States in pro
portion to what California has received.
Georgia would receive a large grant of
2,062,222 acres; Rhode Island would re
ceive the smallest, 46,435 acres.
The aggregate number ot acres of land
on hand to be granted for school purposes
is 27,651,736. . Under the provisions of the
bid, the Secretary says that Missiouri
would receive only 1,162,136 acres, a short
age of 37,003 acres. y ' ?\
â  m These discrepancies, the Secretary say 3,
indicate that the committee should revise
the schedule or the bill. The Secretary
reviewed at length other provisions of the
measure in which he finds defects and
concludes with the statement that it is
crude, imperfect and impracticable, and
hopes his candid criticism would aid the
committee in framing a bill that would
accomplish the end in view.
ALLOTMENT OF SALARIES.
Its Discontinuance Would Cause Hard-
ship to Naval Officers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. I?.â A de
cision has been rendered by the Comp
troller of the Treasury that no legal au
thority exists by which naval officers may
ask allotments of their salaries to their
wives or others. The practice has- existed
for seventy-five years, and was not ques
tioned until Pay Director Colby brought
up the case, in which the Assistant Comp
troller has given his opinion.
Rear- Admiral 'Ramsay, acting Secretary
of the Navy, has written to the chairman
of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs
in regard to the matter, in which he asks
legislative sanction of the practice. He
â¢says in his letter that to suddenly discon
tinue the allotments now , authorized
would work great injustice to officers now
absent on sea duty and to these dependent
upon them.
SCANDALS OF THE FAIR.
World's Columbian Exposition
Employes Continue Their
Petty Squabbles.
Refuse to Make Reports to Palmer, but
Insist on Addressing President
Cleveland.
- NEW YORK, N. V," Feb. 18.-A Sun
special from Washington says: The of
ficials of the World's Columbian Exposi
tion are still quarreling. Mrs. Potter
Palmer refuses to address her report as
president of the board of lady managers to
Thomas W. Palmer, president of the
World's Columbian Commission, but in
sists upon sending it direct to the Presi
dent of the United States, although he
does not officially know of her existence.
The board of lady managers were not ap
pointed by President Cleveland, but by
the National commission, and the latter
says that Mrs. Palmer has no more au
thority to address President Cleveland di
rectly than she has to address the Sultan of
Turkey.
â¢ Director-General Davis has addressed
his report to the Congress of the United
States instead of to President Thomas W.
Palmer, as he should have done. The
board of control has made a tearful com
plaint on this account to the Committee
on Appropriations, but Davis says that he
will not deliver his report to anybody
until he is reimbursed for the money he
has expended in its preparation. An item
in a pending appropriation bill gives him
$18,000 to cover this.
The report of Mr. Burnham, director of
works, is addressed to Mr. Higginbotham.
and the reports of President Higginbotham
and John Boyd Thacher's bureau of awards
are addressed to President Palmer, who
says he has a report of his own also, which
is addressed to the President of the United
States, ami should cover all the official
documents that relate to the exposition.
Professor Tousley Â« of Minnesota has
again been appointed to prepare a history
of the exposition. He received a similar
appointment in the summer of 1894 and
drew $6 a day from the appropriation for
the bureau of awards for several months,
until Chairman Thacher went to Europe.
Then Vice-Chairman Britton cut him off,
because up to that time he had not written
a line, but had, it is alleged, spent the
summer loafing down in New England at
the expense of the bureau. To revenge
himself, Professor Tousley went up to
Albany and made speeches against John
Boyd Thacher when the latter was run-;
ning for Mayor.
TO BUILD AN AIR LINE.
Dallin. Would Like to Save the Govern-
mi nt Indorse Bonds.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 18.â The
Tribune says this morning: William
Dallin, vice-president and general man
ager of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad
Construction Company, has addressed a
letter to the President of the United States
on the subject of a railroad in an air line,
first to Chicago and then to San Francisco.
The distance would be shortened by this
route 200 miles to Chicago, and to San
Francisco over 400. Passenger trains
would run to Chicago in thirteen hours
and to San Francisco in sixty-eight hours.
The line would cost $400,000,000, : and
Dallin wants the Government to indorse
the bonds to pay for its construction, on
the ground that it would be of benefit to
the country. y <y -, m

TO RESTRICT
IMMIGRATION.
An Interesting Bill to Be
Reported by the Senate
Committee.
THE ILLITERACY TEST.
Those Who Seek a Landing Must
Be Able to Read and. Write,
at Least.
NOT READY FOE A TAX YET.
Methods to Shut Out Classes That
Furnish Paupers, the Diseased
and Criminals.
WASHINGTON, D. C.I Feb. 18.â In lieu
of the various bills before it on the subject
of restricting immigration the Senate Im
migration Committee to-day reported a bill
adding to the classes of aliens excluded
from admission to the United States.
All persons over 14 years of age who can
not read and write the language of their
native country, except that an aged parent
not so able to read and write, who is the
parent or grandparent of an admissible
immigrant, may acegmpanj' or be sent for
by such immigrant. For the purpose of
testing the ability of the immigrant to
read and write the inspection officers shall
be furnished with copies of the constitu
tion of the United States printed on num
bered uniform pasteboard slips, each con
taining five lines of the constitution
printed in the various languages of the
immigrants in double small pica type.
These slips are to be kept in Doxes made
for that purpose and so constructed as to
conceal the slips from view, each box to
contain slips of but one language, and the
immigrant may designate the language in
which he prefers # the test shall be made.
Each immigrant shall be required to draw
one of said slips from the box and read
and afterward write out in full view of
the immigration officers the five lines
printed thereon. No immigrant failing to
read and' write out the slip thus drawn by
him shall be admitted, but he shall be re
turned to the country from which be came
at the expense of the steamship or rail
road which brought him, as now provided
by law.
In the report accompanying the bill the
committee states that there is a general
and earnest desire to restrict foreign immi
gration. The committee believe the coun
try is not yet ready for a_capitation tax on
immigrants, and they are convinced that
the consular certification plan is impracti
cable. They therefore recommend it as
the best proposition yet advanced.
The committee presents a mass of statis
tics, which show that the illiteracy test
will affect \ almost entirely those races
whose immigration to this country had
begun in very recent times, and which are
most alien in language and origin to the
people who founded the thirteen colonies
and have built up the United States; that
it will tell most heavily on those classes
which now furnish the paupers, diseased
and criminals excluded by existing law,
and is, therefore, a continuance of the
present policy of the United States.
BANKERS' CROOKED WORK
Creditors of the Eopperls Make
Serious Charges Against
the Missing Men.
Father and Son Said to Have Escaped
the Jurisdiction of the Illinois
Court.
_______
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 11.â The creditors
of the two Kopperl banks, which are now
in the hands of assignees, now make
charges by implication in their petitions
to the County Courts while the missing
bankers, the bookkeeper of the Canal
street place and the attorney for the elder
Kopperl have been cited to appear and an
swer pertinent questions about receiving
checks and cash on the day of the failure.
The younger Kopperl was said to be in
Chicago to-day, but a Deputy Sheriff who
was sent to bring him into court could not
find him before court closed. His father
and mother are said to be at Mount Clem
ens, Mich., but the indignant depositors
in both banks are not banking upon the
return of either within the jurisdiction of
the Illinois courts. The liabilities are now
believed to be $100,000. The United Shoe
Company, one of the principal creditors,
declared in a petition in the court to-day
that it deposited $2100 in the Canal-street
Bank the day before the failure, having
before that time $700 on deposit. A few
hours before the bank closed its doors the
company sent a check for $11 for payment
and it was returned marked "No funds."
Other creditors reported to the court evi
dence to show that the banks were prac
tically one, although publicly conducted
as separate institutions.

MYSTIC KREW OF CO MUS.
Jolly Paraders Wind Up the Neib Orleans
Celebration.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Feb. 18.â The
carnival parades were concluded to-night
by the gorgeous. and- dazzling tableaux
of the Mystic Krew of Gonitis. This organ
ization is the oldest of its kind in the city,
having made its first parade on Mardi
Gras night, 1857.
Since then its annual display has fit
tingly been the gorgeous conclusion of the
street parades.
The months and seasons of the year were

Members of the Transcontinental Pas

Vigorous Steps.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 18.â The members
of the Transcontinental Passenger Asso
ciation are determined to resist the South
ern Pacific's encroachment on Colorado
territory by inaugurating a California pas
senger rate war if necessary. A meeting
of the association was held to-day at the
headquarters here, officially to act on j
routine matters, but the tactics of the j
Southern Pacific formed a lively subject of j
discussion until a late hour.
The representatives of the Chicago-Col
orado lines wanted an ultimatum served
on the Southern Pacific to stop its cut-rate
alliances with outside roads, by which
large parties have been carried in a round
about way from .New York to San Fran
cisco, from San Francisco to Portsmouth
and from Denver to New York. The Sea
board Air Line, which also has no interest
in Colorado territory, is the principal ac
complice of the Southern Pacific.
This irregular business is considered to
be in defiance of the principles of mutual
interest, on which the association, of
which the Southern Pacific is a member,
was organized. The offending road will be
given to understand in plain terms that
such tactics must cease or the complain
ing competitors will take -independent ac
tion to protect their interests.

CHANCES OF EL PASO MEETS.
Maher's Eyes Grow Brighter, but the
Sporting Men Are Deserting
in Disgust.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 18.-Conflicting
stories concerning Maher's condition came
from Las Cruees on the late train to-night,
one brought by a Colorado sport who had
spent the day at the training quarters
being to the effect, that one of the Irish
man's optics was in as bad a state as when
he was here on Thursday, the inflamma
tion having increased in the past twelve
hours, and that he spent the greater part
of the day in bed. On the other hand,
Referee George Siier, who also came into
town from the grounds late to-night, says
the fighter walked several miles this
morning and did tnree hours' punching
and boxing in the afternoon; that bis left
optic is entirely recovered and the right
one so much improved that he can read
small print without pain or difficulty.
Siler's version is generally accepted as the
correct one.
In accordance with instructions from
Governor Ahumada before leaving for
Chihuahua last night, Manuel Bouch, Col
lector of Customs, was to-day added to the
force of guards patroling the Mexican
frontier along the northern border.
Local interest in the possible meeting of
Maher and Fitzsimmons on Friday has
about petered out. The throngs that erst
while blockaded EI Paso street from store
front to curb have gradually dwindled to
complete disappearance and groups that
arc occasionally encountered on the cross
thoroughfares are composed in the main of
Mexicans from Juarez or rurales from the
surrounding country.
The feeling is next door to universal
that something or other will again happen
to keep the men from meeting in the ring,
while those who are not skeptical on this
point express themselves as caring not a
continental at the outcome.
gether, never has a world's championship
pugilistic contest been immediately pre
ceded by such an utter lack of enthusiasm
or exhilaration.
Fitzsimmons took his daily spin to town
on his wheel this morning. Julian had
preceded him on an international mule-
CltT.
Fitzsimmons took four hours' exercise j
at his Juarez quarters this afternoon, box- 'â¢
ing with McCoy, the local heavy-weight,
wrestling with Jack Stelsener of St. Louis
and punching the bag. There is no ques
tion that he is in magnificent condition,
while his temper toward Maher is de
cidedly ugly. Everything indicates that
be will put up the fight of his life if the
opportunity is offered three days hence.
Fitzsimmons received to-day a dispatch
dated at Chicago and reading as follows:
"To Robert Fitzsimmons: Read in to
night's papers that you said I was a cur.
The first time I see yon I will make you
take it back as i did before.
"J. J. COKBETT."
After making the air sulphurous for a
while, Fitzsimmons turned the message
over to Julian, who promptly sent the
following replj :
"J. J. Corbett, Chicago: All right,
chappie, get ready, put yourself in better
condition than you were in at Hot Springs,
and get down here. Fitzsimmons will put
you out of existence the day after he puts
Maher among the has-beens.

CONSTANTINOPLE. Turkey. Feb. 18.â
The surrender of arms by the Armenians, I
who for months held the city of Zeitoun j
against the Turks, has been completed. j
Five members of the Hintchaks, an Anne- !
nian revolutionary society, found in !
Zeitoun when the place was conditionally i
surrendered to the" Turks, have been con
ducted to the coast for expulsion from the
country.
Murad Bey. late Imperial Commissioner
of the Ottoman debt, who fled for his life i
from Constantinople about the time
"Little" Said Pasha sought refuge a: the
British embassy, and who has sought
refuge in Egypt, has been convicted in his
absence of treason and sentenced to death
for issuing attacks on the Sultan.
Murad Bey, after issuing a pamphlet in
Paris against the Sultan, took up his
residence in Cairo, there to direct the
Arabic press campaign against the Otto- \
man ruler. The Sultan recently demanded I
t at the Egyptian Government turn Murad \
Bey over to him for punishment. The !
Government consulted with Lord Cromp, i
the British diplomatic agent at Cairo, and
then refused to extradite a man who, the |
Government said, was guilty of no crime j
against common law.
LANDING OF RUSSIAN TROOPS.
Secretary Curzon Tells of the Troubles in
Korea.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 18.â In the House
of Commons to-day Arthur Griffith-Ros
cawen, Conservative member for the Tun
bridge division of Kent, interrogated the
Government in regard to the reported
landing of Russian sailors and marines at
Chemulpo, Korea, and the circumstances
of the King of Korea taking refuge in the
Russian legation at Seoul.
Right Hon. George N. Curzon, Under
Secretary for Foreign /ffair*, said in reply
that the reason which had been given for
the action of the King in putting himself
under the protection of the Russian Minis
ter, was that the political situation in
Korea was such as to endanger himself and
the members of bis family.
In reply to further questions Mr. Curzon
said he would not admit that the landing
of an armed Russian force in Korea was
tantamount to occupation of that country,
and further said that the Government had
mad- no representations to Russia on the
object. pMBW
The House this evening agreed to the
address in reply to the Queen's speech
opening the session of Parliament.

Suggestions for the Selection of a Joint

LONDON, Eng., Feb. 18.â The Daily
News will to-morrow say that the negotia
tions now in progress between the United
States and Great Britain will result, ac-
cording to the expectation of the best in
formed circles, in a satisfactory settlement
of the Venezuelan boundary dispute.
The paper gives the line 3on which the
negotiations are proceeding. They are
virtually identical with the suggestions
made by G. W. Sna alley, the American
correspondent of the Times, for the ap
pointment of a joint commission.
The Right Hon. John Morley, formerly
Chief Secretary for Ireland, who is con
testing in the Liberal interest the seat in
the House of Commons for the Montrose
Burghs, delivered a speech at Forfar to
day. In the course of his remarks he said
he rejoiced that there was every indication
of a solution of the Guiana boundary dis
pute by the appointment of a joint com
mission.

PRETORIA, South Africa, Feb. 18.â

Secretary, had a good effect, and it is now
most probable that the Volksraad, in
special session, will give the sanction to
the proposed visit of President Kruger to
England in response to MV. Chamberlain's
invitation that he visit that country to dis
cuss the matters at issue between Great

ROWE AGAINST WILLIAMS.
Injures the Marquette Bishop's
Chances by Publishing
a Letter.
It Was Sent as a Confidential Missive,
but Was Made Public
Nevertheless.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Feb. 18.â The
fight over the consecration of G. Mott
Williams as Bishop of the Marquette Epis
copal diocese has developed a second sen
sation, and one that has brought the Right
Rev. P. T. Rowe, Bishop of Alaska, into
much unpleasant notoriety.
Bishop Rowe wrote to Mr. Williams a
most friendly and sympathetic letter. In
this letter Bishop Rowe showed a kindly
interest, with the result that Mr. Williams
replied freely and without reserve, believ
ing his letter was to be treated confiden
tially.
It is this letter that is now causing the
trouble. For the first time Mr. Williams
appears to have evidenced some feeling in
the matter, and he expressed himself with
out reserve. He stated that it-would be
just as well that they should be kept out
of office, referring to diocesan officers, and
also intimated that it was his intention to
see that they were kept out. Mr. Wil
liams attacked the delegates in rather
harsh terms.
This letter is held by Mr. Williams'
opponents to be strong proof that the
charges contained in the protest were not
without foundation. Bishop Rowe, in
stead of treating the letter as confidential,
turned, it over to the Sault Ste. Marie
delegates, with the result that it has been
printed and sent to every Bishop in the
country.

are ready to meet Huntington's lieutenants

Senators Goebel, Taylor and others, who
are pushing the fight for the.bill, are well
known for their parliamentary ability and
success in legislative matters, and are de
termined in their efforts to reach the bill
in the Senate this week, and its passage is
a foregone conclusion.
There are but three bills on orders of the
day ahead of this measure, and it may be
reached at any time. There has been no
meeting of the House Committee on Cor
porations to consider the duplicate of the
Goebel bill. Chairman Freeman said to a
Call correspondent to-night:
"1 have not called the committee, but
am willing to hear argument on the bill at
any time. I have been daily expecting a
notice from friends of the bill to hear ar
gument, but have received no communica
tion, and shall certainly report the bill
without an expression of opinion unless I
other members of the committee insist on j
an expression."
Senator Goebel and others are awaiting
the action of the Senate before urging the
bill in the House.
Colonel John T. Harrington of Cali
fornia, who is on the staff of Governor
Budd arrived here yesterday, as one of
the lobby against the repeal bill.
This fact has brought to light a security
debt paid for Colonel Harrington by Colo
nel Robert Tyler, at present an officer of
the State Senate, amounting to $1000.
This debt was paid during the war, when
Harrington and Tyler were Confederate
soldiers.
Colonel Tyler this evening filed suit for
the recovery of his debt with interest.
Notice has been served on Colonel Har
rington.

THE MILITARY PARTY TO RULE
Japanese Statesmen Considering the
Best Means of Preventing North
ern Encroachment.
TOKIO, Japan, Feb. 4.â The resignation
of the Japanese Minister of State for Home
Affairs is the first untoward result brought
about by the difficulties attending a work
ing alliance between- the Government and
the Liberals. In Japan each Government
bill is introduced by the department im
mediately concerned, and its conduct
through the houses is entrusted to the
Minister of that department and his dele
gates. This session the Government sub
mitted to the lower house a measure pro
viding a special metropolitan system of
government for Tokio, and erecting the
suburban districts into a separate prefec
ture. The project aroused strong opposi
tion among the citizens of Tokio as well as
among the Liberal party, and the Govern
ment finally withdrew the bill.
This alone would have greatly discred
ited the Minister principally engaged in
compiling the measures and in carrying
them through the houses. But a more
humiliating issue . subsequently, arose in
connection with a bill introduced by the
Liberals for the amendment of the local
government system throughout the em
pire. At present the headmen of divisions,
in view of the important and responsible
functions devolving upon them, are nomi.
nated by the Central Government. Fur
ther, at the election of certain local offi
cials the system of scrutin de liste is fol
lowed. The Liberals, regarding both of
these processes as opposed to the spirit of
local autonomy, introduced a bill making
the position of headman elective and abol
ishing scrutin de liste. To both changes
the legates of the Department of State
for Home Affairs announced at first the
Government's opposition in the lower
house ond were subsequently obliged to
withdraw their protest. The Minister of
Home Affairs finds that under such cir
cumstances his position is intolerable and
has submitted his resignation. Being one
of the ablest statesmen Japan possesses,
his secession is a great blow to the Cabi
net, especially since all ruptures between
the statesmen in office have hitherto been ,
carefully avoided during the Diet's ses- '
sion. I
Rumors grow more and more persist
ent that Marquis Ito intends to visit
Petersburg so as to be present at the
coronation of the Czar, on which occasion
the Emperor of Japan will be represented
by his Imperial Highness Prince
Fushimi. Should the Marquis take such
a step great political significance will be
attached to it by the public, nor can there
be much doubt that his Excellency
would utilize the occasion to remove the
misconceptions that now so often threaten
the entente between Japan and her great
northern neighbor. But it is difficult to
believe that the Prime Minister will leave
Japan before the Diet rises, which will
not be until the 28th of March. In the
event of his departure political indications
now point to Count Matsukata as his suc
cessor, which would mean the restoiation
of the so-called "military party" to power.
The term "military party" is supposed
to signify a body of statesmen radically
opposed to the system of responsible Cabi
nets, and determined to hold in stern
check the growing power of the Diet. But
Count Matsukata does not really entertain
any views of that natuie. During his
leadership of the Cabinet, when the Diet
met for the first time, he came much
nearer to an understanding with the Lib
erals than was ever supposed by the gen
eral public, and if he resumed office now,
he would probably be found in alliance
with Count Okuma's party, the extreme
wing of the opposition and the bitterest
enemies ofthe Liberals. This late consid
eration accentuates the improbability of
Marquis Ito's resignation before the Diet
rises. His association with the Liberals
could not have been intended to have such
ephemeral duration. It must have been
designed to last throughout one session of
the Diet at least.
In discussing the budgetary items re
lating to military and naval expansion
the Japanese House of Representatives
has observed great privacy. Twice its de
bates have been held with closed doors,
but enough has transpired to afford a
glimpse of one important phase of national
j policy. Debating the periods fixed by the
j Government lor completing its schemes of
j expanded armaments, the House naturally
I considered the fact that, after the comple
tion of the Siberian railway, Russia will
be able gradually to concentrate at Vladi
vostock a force aggregating 200,000 men.
In what degree would Japan be menaced
by such a contingency, and what capacity
to meet it would she possess at the time
These were among the questions debated
by the Representatives, and they arrived at
the conclusion that, although Russia
might perhaps succeed in massing a great
army at Vladivostock, she could not pos
sibly maintain it at such an immense dis
tance from its base of supplies by means
of a solitary railway. Maritime commu
nication would be essential, and any line
! of sea communications would be exposed
1 ! to attacks by the Japanese navy, which,
| by that time, will be fully three times as
strong as the Russian squadron now as
i sembled in eastern waters.
The application of the ; Sanyo Railway
Company to purchase the state railroad
between Tokio and Kobe with the object
of doubling the line, altering it to the
broad gauge system and bringing the whole
main trunk line from Tokio to Shimon
oseki under one management, has been re
jected by the Government. But there can
! be little doubt that the attention attracted
by this great project, coming at a time
when people recognize the unwisdom of
employing the narrow-gauge on the
numerous lines now projected, has fixed
the nation's resolve to make a bold de
parture from the narrow-gauge system. Â
The Japanese Government is" about to
â¢-'-.-â¢ 'â â â¢.-â -â  â â â¢â â¢â  " ...
issue an imperial ordinance extending to
subjects and citizens of powers having
treaties with Japan the right to enjoy in
Formosa every privilege secured to them
by those treaties within the empire of
Japan.
The Government of Korea has deemed
it abvisable to abstain from drastic
measures in pushing its air-cutting re
form. Instructions have been ; issued to
local officials that people shall be left to
follow their own opinion in the matter.
Ten Japanese workmen were killed and
eleven wounded on the 20th of January by

Johnson Working for Improvements on the
Sacramento â No Monument for
Commodore Sloat.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 18.-Repre
sentative Johnson to-day introduced a
resolution directing the Secretary of War to
inquire as to the present condition of the
Sacramento River and the effect upon navi
gation of the recent floods therein, and to
estimate the cost of such improvements as
may be necessary to restore the river to its
natural channel and to report generally as
to the nature and extent of such work as,
in his opinion, the circumstances of the
case require.
The Committee on Public Lands gave a
hearing to State agents in favor .of the
swamp land bill. The bill returns to
States the amounts received from the sale
of swamp lands, including lands located
by bounty warrants. On Friday the Com
mittee on Public Lands will give a hearing
to the California committee on Johnson's
5 per cent bill.
Senator Perkins some time ago intro
duced a bill for the erection of a monu
ment to Commodore John D. Sloat, in
memory of his action in taking possession
of California in the name of the United
States at the time of the Mexican War.
It has been pointed out, however, that
the records showed that Sloat neglected
to obey the orders of the Secretary of War
for a long time after the news of the com
mencement of hostilities had reached him,
and that for this refusal to carry out his
instructions he was reprimanded and re
lieved of his command.
He sailed, however, before the repri
mand and order reached him, and thus
saved himself from disgrace. But it is
claimed that his delay endangered or
might have endangered the success of the
plans to secure California for the United
States, and that he has thereby shown
himself to be a man unworthy of such
honor as is proposed.
Unless evidence can be produced show
ing that Sloat has been misrepresented it
is not probable that Senator Perkins will
press the bili.

WILL WED AN
AUSTRIAN DUKE
Actress Minnie Radcliffe
Lands a European
Title.
A CONQUEST AT BERLIN.
Won the Affections of a Grand-
Nephew of the Great Prince
Metternich.
ARE SOON TO BE MARRIED.
ThÂ© Footlights Favorite Will Be
Mistress of a Romantic Castle
in Tyrol.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 18.â Minnie Rad
cliffe, the actress, who became a great
favorite on this coast in 1892 in the role of
Dearest in "Little Lord Fauntleroy/' is to
wed an Austrian Duke, so says a private
letter from New York, received here to
day.
Miss Radcliffe, accompanied by her
mother, an accomplished and refined
woman, spent her last summer's vacation
in Europe. In Berlin they were well re
ceived in the American colony, and at an
afternoon reception Miss Radcliffe met the
Duke of Metternich, a grand-nephew of
.Prince Metternich, Austria's historic
Premier. From all accounts the Duke's
case was one of "love at first sight." Beg
gins permission to pay his respects to the
Radcliffe ladies before his return home,
which was granted, he. with some of the
ladies of nis party, showered much atten
tion upon the two Americans, until they
became objects of envy to their country
women. The Duke gave all conceivable
evidence of his strong attachment for Miss
Radcliffe, but refrained from pressing his
suit for her hand until the day before his
departure from the Prussian capital.
It is alleged that Miss Radcliffe's mother
informed the aristocratic suitor that her
daughter had no dower such as the Gould,
Leiter and Vanderbilt girls bestowed upon
their titled husbands. That was not con
sidered by the nobleman. He argued that
Miss Radcliffe's charming self was all the
treasure he wished for from her family.
The Radcliffes, however, were in no
hurry to give a positive answer then, and
prior to the departure of the.noble party
from Berlin they were courteously invited
to visit the Metternich Schloss, at Inns
bruck, in Tyrol, before they returned
to America. This invitation was accepted,
and a month later the Radciiffes were in
Vienna, en route to InnsbrucK, where, at
the American legation, they were sur
prised to learn of the great prominence
and enormous wealth of the Metternich
ily.lÃÃC|32S
A fortnight's visit at the Metternich
Schloss, so it is stated, settled Miss Rad
cliffe's fate. She became the affianced of
one of the proudest and most respectable
aristocrats in Europe, She now is said to
be in New York City, but very few are
taken into the confidence of the discreet
young woman, and no one knows when
or where the marriage is to be solemnized.
The writer of the letter conveying this
bit of news conjectures that the wedding
will in all probability take place m Vienna,
and with great eclat.
NATIVES VISIT OROVILLE
Members of Chico and Gridley
Parlors Entertained by
the Argonauts.
The "Curly Bear" and "Coyote" De
grees Conferred Upon Several
Aspiring Novitiates.
CHTCO, Cal., Feb. 18.â Oroville was a
lively burg Saturday night, and the hall of
Argonaut Parlor, N. S. G. W., was crowded
with local Natives and visiting members
from Chico and Gridley parlors. The oc
casion was the conferring of special de
grees on candidates from Oroville and
Gridlev. "Coyotes" and "Curly Bears"
mingled fraternally and socially, and a
royal time was had.
In the afternoon the members of Chico
Parlor No. 21, thirty strong, in four-in
hands and private conveyances, left Chico
for Oroville. The ride over was a pleasure,
the roads being in good condition, the
afternoon a beautiful one. and the drivers
anxious to show the speed of their ani
mals. Major Barnard drove one four-in
hand, in which were seven people, over in
2 hours and 25 minutes. Oroville was
reached before dark and, after dining, the
members were escorted to Argonaut Par
lor's hall, where the initiatory ceremonies
were held. y-y:
Gridley Parlor was represented by a
large number, and two of the members
were given the "Curly Bear" degree by
Argonaut Parlor. This created much fun,
and those who had never seen it were
highly amused, but it was not much fun
for the candidates.
But the "Coyote" was the king. While
the conferring of this degree was in prog
ress merriment ran riot. When finished
Chico Parlor was congratulated upon the
success of the ceremonies. A. F. Jones
and Past. Grand Jo D. Sproul acted as
toastmasters.
VALLEJO MAN INJURE O.
A Ranch Employe . Dragged Beneath a
Gang Plow by Runaway Horace,
VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. 18.â Theodore
Blank, employed on Daniel Monihan's
ranch, a short distance from town, met
with a serious accident this afternoon while
driving four horses attached to a heavy
gang plow. One of the traces became
unhitched and as he attempted to re hook
it the horses started to run, throwing him
to the ground. The gang plow, with its
sharp shears, passed on ton of him. In
this position he was dragged quite a dist
ance, the iron cutting him in a number of
places. . â¢ ',
The horses were finally - stopped and
Blank extricated from his perilous position.
His face was badly gashed, his right ear
nearly severed and his < right leg cut â in
several places. The wounds, though ugly
looking, will not prove fatal. .
Drowned at Portland.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. Peter Mc-
Cabe, formerly a policeman here, was ac
cidentally killed at an early hour this
morning while coming from Astoria on the
steamer; Telephone. McCabe slipped on
the gangplank, falling into the water to a
depth of eight or nine feet. The man was
speedily * taken out of the river, but was
dead when he reached the deck of the
steamer. He could not have drowned in
the short time he was submerged, but it is
supposed that he was killed by striking his
head against the side of the vessel.
WANTED AT SPOKANE.
A Missing Fresno Confidence Man Who Ran
Away With the Wife of Another
Individual.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. Charles Good
fellow, who is not all that his name im
plies, is wanted in places other than
Fresno. Goodfellow was a local sewer con
tractor who decamped between two (lays,
leaving a number of laborers minus their
wages for several weeks. On the day prior
io his leaving he cashed a city warrant for
$2600 and took the money with him. In
addition to the laborers who were left
without their money several material sup
ply houses have occasion to rue the day
they extended credit to Goodfellow. A
woman who had posed as Goodfellow's
wife during his residence here was left
behind, but some time afterward she, too,
dropped out of sight.
A letter was received to-day by City
Clerk Shanklin which explains who the
pretended Mrs. Goodfellow really was. It
was written by a deserted husband and
throws new light on Goodfellow's "accom
plishments." It is as follows:
Spokane, Wash., Feb. 14.
City Clerk, Fresno, Cal.-DF.xvt Sip. : I - hear
that the police of your city wanted a man by
the name of Charles Goodfellow, formerly of
this city. Will you please inform me if he is
still wanted on the charge of misdemeanor,
and can you inform me if there was a woman
with him at the time he was in Fresno? He
left here in compa >y with my wife unlawfully,
and I am trying to find them and bring them
back here. Perhaps you could put me in tho
possession of some information which might
assist me in capturing him.
J. M. Anderson, Jamieson Block.
The officers here will not be able to ren
der Mr. Anderson any service, for neither
Goodfellow nor the woman has been heard
from since their flight from this city.
BAKERSFIELD'S MYSTERY.
Diligent Inquiry Fails to Reveal
the Whereabouts of Henry
Brockman.
Valuable Papers Belonging to the
Missing Man Are Found on a
Seattle Street.
BAKERSFIELD. Cal., Feb. 18.â Henry
Brockman, a well-known resident of this
county for years, is missing, and his
friends are greatly worried. On the 12th
of last November Brockman intrusted a
note for $150 to Attorney' McNamara for
collection and then departed, leaving word
to address him at Piute, in care of J. E.
Miller. , On December 9 McNamara ad
dressed a letter to Brockman informing
him that the note had been collected. A
fe.v days afterward a reply came from
Miller that Brockman had left his place,
and he knew nothing of his whereabouts.
Here the matter ended until this morning.
Shortly after Brockman left McNamara"s
office he went to the Bank of Bakersfield
and left $50, and in return was given a cer
tificate of deposit. Recently a letter was
received from Seattle from a man signing
himself Jack Levy, informing the bank
that he had found on the streets of that
city a Bank of Bakersfield certificate of
deposit for $50, payable to Henry Brock
man, with a receipt for a $150 note pinned
to it, and he stated that if the $2 which he
j bad paid out for advertising for Brockman
| were sent to him he would forward thÂ«
papers.
Toe bank complied, but all efforts to
ascertain the whereabouts of Brockmaii
proved ineffectual.
FRESNO DEMOCRATS ACTIVE.
Party Leaders to Embark in a Daily
Newspaper Venture.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 10.â Fresno County
Democrats are determined, it seems, to
have a party organ. A new /syndi
cate of leaders of that party has been
organized for the avowed purpose of bring
ing out an unalloyed Democratic daily in
the near future. A note for a large sum
has been signed by several prominent
Democrats, which, it is understood, will
be hypothecated for the desired funds.
Editor Dealer of the Madera Tribune is
already on the way to San Francisco to
purchase the plant. Dealer will be one of
the new paper's managers. It is under
stood that the new daily will absorb ex-
Senator Goucher's weekly, which reached
its fourth issue yesterday. The venture is
based on the prospects of an election for
county officers next November. The pres
ent county officials, with one exception,
are Republicans. Incase of an election
the Democrats intend to make a deter
mined fight to displace every man now in j
the courthouse. . j

DYNAMITER AT
LOS ANGELES.
Harry Coyne Arrested for
Hurling a Bomb at a
Residence.
POSED AS A DETECTIVE.
He Is Believed to Have Made the
Attempt to Wreck the
Stimson House. â¢
HAD WARNED THE MILLIONAIRE
Offered to Prevent the Dastardly
Crime if He Was Paid a Sum
of Money.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. IS.â Harry
Coyne, alias Hank Coyne, an alleged de
tective, was arrested this morning by De
tectives Auble and Hawley on a warrant
charging him with assault with intent to
commit murder. The arrest is the out
growth of the explosion which took place
at the residence of Capitalist T. D. Stim
son, on Figueroa street, a short time ago.
About three months ago Coyne was en
gaged by Mr. Stimson to accompany a son
of the millionaire to the City of Mexico.
This -in was unruly and ungovernable,
and the millionaire desired to get him
away Irom the city. When Coyne re
turned to Los Angeles he found that his
oflice furniture had been attached by a
constable to liquidate some of his indebt
edness.
A few days after his return Coyne went to
Stimson and apprised him that he -uni
son) was in danger of his life. He stated
that something terrible was likely to hap
pen him. He intimated that he was in the
secret and that for a certain sum of money
an exposure of the guilty parties would be
made. Stimson refused to treat with
Coyne, and soon afterward the explosion
occurred.
Stimson went to the Chief of Police and
informed him of Coyne's actions and im
plied threats. Detectives Anble and Had
ley were then detailed on the case. Coyne,
who appears to have always maintained
his assurance, called on Chief Glass and
gave him a lengthy and detailed account
of another contemplated outrage on Stim
son. He informed the Chief that for $60
he . would place the malefactors in the
Chief's power. Coyne's next call was upon
T. D. Stimson. He notified that gentle
man that there were three men in the
scheme to either blow up the Figueroa
street mansion, set fire to his lumber-yard
or stab him in the back.
The most singular thing in connection
with this affair was the fact that Coyne
invariably stated that these men were in
his power and would do his bidding. He
made the proposition both to Mr. Stimson
and the Chief of Police that if he was paid
$250 he would so arrange it that they could
capture the men in the act, but he stipu
lated that he should be one of the men
who would make the capture.
The police say that Coyne was not alone
in the scheme. When the case of Coyne
is brought up in the courts sensational de- .
velopments are expected. It is hinted that
one of the supposed malefactors is a young
man well known to the community and
not unknown to Mr. Stimson.
BASEBALL AT STANFORD.
Phi Gamma Deltas Defeat the Beta Theta
Pis in the Best Game of
the Season,
. STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
18.â A second inter-fraternity baseball
game was played on the campus to-day,
and in some respects was the best game
seen on the diamond thus far. Captain
McLaine's pitching was line, and Strohn,
'98, Cochran, '96, and Cotton, "98, all

the Phi Gamma Deltas and the Beta Theta

was 13 to 11 in favor of the Phi Gamma

Two Schoolteachers Settle a Dispute as to
California Law.
" CHICO, Cal., Feb. 18.â Gridley was in
an uproar last night, when two of Butte
County's popular schoolteachers engaged
in a fight. J. T. Beven, member of the
Board of Education and principal of the
Girls' High School at Gridiey, and P. L.
Tople, principal of Gridley public school,
met on the street, and during a brief con
versation Mr. Tople remarked that a pri
vate individual could sue the State. Sir.
Beven inlormed Mr. Tople that he knew
nothing about it, that a private individual
could not sue the State.
When Beven insinuated that Tople was
in error, the latter offered to bet he was
not. Before they could put up the stakes,
they concluded to settle it in a prompter
manner. Tople led for Beven's head, and
Beven began to dodge. The fight lasted :
several minutes. A large crowd congre
gated, and the belligerents were separated.
Beven and Tople had black eyes, and each
was led away by his friends.

TULARE COUNTY'S OUTLAWS.
Mrs, Johnson Confesses That Her Sons Are
Guilty, and Urges Them to Sur
render.
VISALIA, Cal., Feb. 18.â In an inter
view with a Call correspondent to-day, in
the County Jail, Mrs. E. J. Johnson, the
mother of Ben and Dudley Johnson, the
boys who are now pursued by a Sheriff's
posse, admitted that her sons were guilty,
and wrote the following letter, which she
asked to have left in her house, near
Traver, or mailed at Traver, where she
hoped her boys would receive it:
,', â \iralia, Cal., Feb. 18, 1896.
My Dear Children: This is your dear mother
that you love more than your life. You know,
dear boys, that you have done those tilings
that you ought not to have done. That man
who came to the House was, I think, the Sheriff
from Hanford. He had a right to arrest you,
and now every bad thing will be laid to you
unless you come back and face it.
Now, dear children, come back and face it; do.
dear children, come, and all things may turn
out for the best. Doit for my sake; come. they
cannot kill or hang you. Trusting that this
may reach you is the prayer of your fond
Mother.
The officers are in close pursuit of the
boys, and it is expected that they will be
caught with but little difficulty, notwith
standing their threat that they would
never be taken alive. Sheriff Merritt has
found that a box of stolen goods was
shipped from Traver a few days ago by one
of the Johnson boys.
The old lady says the box was sent, but
she declined to say where. She says,
however, that Dudley was at Los Angeles
for several days recently, and it is believed
sold some of the stolen goods there.
While living around Farmersville Dud
ley would not associate with any one ex
cept members of good families. T. J.
Brundage took a fancy to him and often
invited him'to his house.
His son Robert has been regularly cor
responding with Dudley ever since. Mr.
BrnndagestiJl refuses to believe that Dud
ley Johnson had anything to do with
cracking his safe or robbing the Lindsay
store.
Dudley has dark hair and eyes, weight
about 145 pounds and wears a small, dark
mustache. Bis brother Ben is heavier,
but shorter and is lighter in complexion.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL 1 , WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1896.
PROBING THE
WILLOWS FEUD.
Political Quarrels Caused
the Death of Druggist
Putnam.
WERE BITTER ENEMIES.
Editor Sehorn Had Excoriated
His Opponent in the Columns
of His Paper.
THEY MET UPON THE STREET.
An Angry Altercation, a Blow, and
Then the Fatal Shots Were
Fired,
WILLOWS, Cal., Feb. 18.â taking
of evidence against W. A. Sehorn, on trial
for the killing of Druggist Putnam last |
October, began to-day. During the morn- j
ing session of court the prosecution's case j
was outlined by Attorney Swinford, and
then H. W. Walker, a son-in-law and part- |
ncr of Putnam, was called.
Swinford said that for four or five
months there had been an unfriendliness
between Sehorn and Putnam. The de
ceased had seen a number of inflammatory
articles in the journal published by
Sehorn, reflecting on him, and had ordered
the paper discontinued three or four
times, but it was sent to his store despite
his protests.
Supervisor H. C. Hulet was the first wit
ness to describe the killing of Putnam.
He was in the act of separating Putnam
and Sehorn at the time the first shot was
fired. On cross-examination, Attorney
Albery labored hard to carry the witness
back to the time of the Democratic Sena
torial Convention in San Francisco, when
the Hon. John Boggs and J. L. Seawell
were candidates in August, 1894, and to
which Putnam was a delegate. It was
finally elicited that Sehorn criticized, at
that time as well as afterward, the actions
of Putnam. '
Dr. Randolph, who was called to attend
Mr. Putnam at the time of the tragedy,
and who arrived just as Putnam was
breathing his last, described the pistol
shot wounds, four in number. He said
that either of the first two wounds was
necessarily fatal.
Frank Putnam, a nephew of the dead
man, had witnessed the killing of his
uncle. He came along at the time and
saw his uncle standing with his back
against a post in front of his drugstore,
and Sehorn in front of and lacing him.
Sehorn was using insulting language and
shaking his finger in Putnam's face. He
called Putnam "a pretty man," and of
fered to bet him $20 that ha did not have
certain papers. Putnam requested Sehorn
to go away and come around in the morn
ing. Sehorn seemed very angry and
would not go away.VyVy'i * '-yy
"Hulet then stepped between them,"
said the witness. "There was a blow. I
thought Sehorn was partly knocked down.
I got hold of my uncle to pull him away,
and Sehorn then shot four times. I
rushed my uncle to the middle of the
street as fast as I could and asked him if
he was shot. I heard gurgling of blood,
and he died â never spoke."
Frank Putnam was still on the stand at
the close of the day's ' session. Judge
Bridgeford ordered the jury into the
charge of the Sheriff, stating that he be
lieved the importance of the case war
ranted it. sUhI
SUISUN VOTES BONDS.
But Six Ballots Cast Against the Proposi
tion for an Extensive Water
Works System.
SUISUN, Cal., Feb. 18.â The election
for bonding the town to acquire an ade
quate water supply was held to-day. The
votes recorded for incurring an indebted
ness of $42,000 necessary for the construc
tion and completion of a public water
works were 145, while only 6 votes were
cast against the proposition. Bonds will
te issued for the aggregate amount, so
that one-fortieth of the indebtedness will
be paid annually, and will bear intereit at
the rate of 5 per cent per annum. The
bonds will be of the denomination of $525
each, and will number eighty in all. The
total amount for the forty years will be
$84,870. The people here, during the past
thirty years, have paid $151,792 to the
present water company.
The source of supply for the proposed
water works is eight and a naif miles from
Suisun, and when the works are con
structed Suisun will own and control one
of the best water systems in the State.
The result of the election to-day will no
doubt cut' an important figure in the en
deavor to have a beet sugur factory estab
lished in Suisun. Enough sugar-beet seed
has been received to experiment on fifty
ranches, and it is being distributed gratui
tously by the proprietors of the Solano
Republican to the farmers in this vicinity.
GOLD IN GREEN V ALLEY.
Sparkling Rlaek , Sand Found Near the
Vailejo Water Works.
SUISUN, Cal., Feb. 18.â Considerable
excitement was caused in Cordelia yester

STEAMERS TO EUREKA.
Proposition Submitted by the
Chamber of Commerce of
Portland.
An Ocean Route That Will Divert
Much Trade From San Fran
/ cisco Wholesalers.
EUREKA, Cal.. Feb. 18.â Great interest
Is manifested here over the proposition
made by the Portland Chamber of Com
merce to establish a regular line of steam
ers between that place and Eureka. Mar
tin Wallace of the Portland Flouring Mill
Company has been sent here as a repre
sentative of the Portland chamber.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company has now a small steamer, the
South Coast, on the route, and as soon as
the merchants here are willing to guarantee
a larger freight and passenger traffic a much
larger and better steamer will be put on.
This company has i. road from Portland to
Umatilla Junction, where a connection is
made with the Great Northern for Spokane
and the East, i y.'- â 
From Umatilla Junction its line extends
I to Huntington, where it meets the Union
i Pacific. The Oregon Railway and Naviga
j tion .'Company then can offer to the people
i of this section the- choice of two connect
ing routes. to the East. If any arrange
! ments can be made so that the same
! through rates enjoyed by the Washington
| shingle and lumber men can be secured by
the Eureka manufacturers it will not be
; long before redwood shingles, doors and
â  window-sashes will be laid down in Chi
cago, Kansas City, Buffalo and other East
ern markets, to compete with the pine in
dustry, which now controls these markets.
For many years San Francisco has
j monopolized tne entire trade of this county.
j Lately, however, the merchants here have
j secured some of their wares from Portland,
! and now a considerable trade is in a fair
I way to be established between the two
places. Next to securing an Eastern rail
road direct, this is considered' by the busi
j ness men as the best proposition the peo
, pie of this district can expect.
Hollister Racetrack Abandoned.

BUILDING BOULEVARDS.
What the Association Has Accomplished
in That Direction Within a
Short Period.
The San Francisco Boulevard Associa
tion met last night and received a report
from its committee on Supervisors and
construction appointed at a previous
meeting. '
The report covers several points. It
states it has succeeded in having Golden
Gate avenue devoted to the public as a
boulevard for light vehicles only. It has
been recommended to the Supervisors that
First avenue, from the park to the Presidio,'
be declared a boulevard. The Ocean boule
vard will be completed by April 1 from the
Cliff to the Ocean House, three and a half
miles along the surf. Seventh avenue, south
of the park, has been greatly improved to
ward the Almshouse and a good entrance
to the park at that point has been made.
The Spring Valley Company has promised
to widen the roadway. by Lake Honda to
the County road, and the Supervisors will
widen the Almshouse road.
Mayor Butro has most generously agreed
to deed to the City a road eighty feet wide,
beginning at a point on the Almshouse
road just beyond the settling-house of the
water company, to run right through his
lands and connect with the Ingleside road.
This gift will bo of incalculable benefit to
this driveway, as it will save a drive uphill
and then downhill, as the road now winds,
and also shorten the distance materially.
It will afford and offer an attractive road
way, from which charming views may be
enjoyed. y^ â¢
When completed this boulevard will
form a continuous driveway from the park
leading up Seventh avenue, past the Alms
house, along the Sutro roadways by the
ingleside, thence down the Ocean road to
the beach, and then along the Ocean bou
levard to the Cliff House on back into the
park. ; -;--;â 
In this connection the committee has
under contemplation the opening and
proper building of a boulevard riuht
through to the County line, and which.it is
expected will be eventually continued
down to San Jose. The committee has
been assured that it will be accorded the
right of way through the water company's
lands, at or ' near a point near where the
Sutro roadway leading from Seventh
avenue ends.
The following resolution on the Pest
house was adopted:
Resolved, That we are unalterably opposed to
the establishment of the Pesthouso on the
Almshouse tract, as it would prove a decidedly
objectionable nuisance to exist contiguous to
the boulevards now being constructed .to
attract the observing citizen and visitor to
MM City's attractions, which are now so near
completion, through the efforts of this associa
tion. . ,-.-:<;â¢-:. ' â¢..,-..â¢: :.-,-.-. -

FOLSOM PRISON
DEATH WATCH
Ivan Kovalev Placed Under
Close Surveillance in
His Cell.
HIS SOLITUDE IS ENDED.
Prison Authorities Are Guard
ing Against an Attempt
at Suicide.
BELIEVE HE WILL CONFESS.
â â â __
A Fellow-Countryman Gains the Con
fidence of the Murderer of Â«
the Webers.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., Feb. 18.â Ivan
Kovalev, the cowardly murderer of F. H.
L. Weber and wife, will pay the penalty
of his crime upon the gallows at Folsom
on Friday mornings and until the men
who have been appointed by Warden
Charles Aull to perform the stern mandate
of the law step into the cell now occupied
by the assassin for the purpose of binding
his limbs and leading him to his death
Kovalev will not be allowed one minute of
solitude. A vigilant watcher will sit in
his cell for the purpose of preventing any
attempt on the part of the condemned
man to take his own life and thus cheat
the law's instrument of its lawful prey.
Ivan Kovalev's life belongs to the law he
has violated and by that law will his life
be ended.
The prisoner, even now that the death
watch has been placed over him, does not
seem to realize that his time on earth is
drawing to a close. He still maintains a
moody demeanor and absolutely refuses to
enter into any extended conversation with
his watchers or any other person who may
be allowed to enter his ceil. He eats in a
mechanical way when his meals are
brought to him, but with no apparent
pleasure or appetite, and he sleeps but lit
tle. Most of the time he sits in his chair
gazing into space witn a look in his eyes
that shows his thoughts are anywhere but
within the narrow confines of his cell.
Kovalev has a fellow-countryman to
keep him company, and who is endeavor
-1 ing to persuade him to give all the minute
[ details of the ghastly crime for which he
\ is soon to suffer. With this man Kovalev
: is rapidly becoming confidential, and it is
believed that eventually he will succeed in
persuading the condemned man to make a
[ full confession.
The attorneys who conducted Kovalev's
defense are fully convinced of the pris
oner's insanity, and have requested that a
thorough examination of his brain be
made after the execution. In the mean
time all the interest which the prisoner
ever displays is when engaged : in playing
dominoes with his fellow-countryman.
Last Sunday Warden Anil, through the
aid of an interpreter, informed Kovalev
that there was no longer any hope for
him. He received the information with
out any perceptible emotion and in
silence. Opinion seems to be equally di
vided as to the probable conduct of the
prisoner on the gallows, some claiming
that he will turn craven, while others be
lieve that his stolidity will not desert him.
TROTTING-HOESE MEN.
New Rules to Be Adopted for the
Advancement of the Light-Har
ness Horse.
The light harness-horse men were out
in full force at the meeting called at the
rooms of the Pacific Coast Trotting-horse
Breeders' Association, 313 Bush street,
last evening. Breeders, trainers, horse
men and representatives of the District
Agricultural Associations from all over the
coast were present. The object of the
meeting was the booming and advance
ment of the trotting-horse industry the
coming season.
Frank Covey, manager of Palo Alto stock
farm, occupied the chair, with F. W. Layng,
editor of the Breeder and Sportsman, act
ing a3 secretary of the meeting. Many
questions came up for discussion, but little
business was accomplished. A resolution
was read by F. W. Loeber of St. Helena
for the relief of owners heavily indebted
to the different agricultural societies
for unpaid forfeits and entrance money,
and whose names are now on the sus
pended list. The substance of the resolu
tion was to allow them to start their
horses in races during 1596 on payment of
their entrance for such starts under the
conditions of the races in which they
enter. If the horse entered prove success
ful in winning the amount of back en
trance money due to be withheld.
The resolution was moved and seconded
and F. W. Kelly, F. J. Brandon and F.
LoeDer appointed as a committee to con
sult with the different agricultural socie
ties for a consideration of the same. One
year was the limit set for allowing owners
to settle baok indebtedness.
Other questions arose for debate and, it
being found impossible to transact the
business during the evening, a committee
of ten was appointed by the chair
to hear the wails and woes of the
horsemen and to formulate a set
of rules for bettering the condition of the
trotting-horse men on the coast. Messrs.
Freeman, Wickcrsham, Brown, Loeber,
Williams, McCauley, Cohn, Durfee, Meek
and P. Williams comprised the committee.
The meeting was then adjourned. The
committee will meet at 10 o'clock a. m.
and report the result of their labors to the
general convention at 8 o'clock this even
ing.
Among the well-known horsemen pres
ent were: L. U. Shippee, Charles Corey,

called to order yesterday morning by V.
Cams Driffield, president of the associa
tion, in the underwriters' ball, Battery
and California streets. ~"
Louis Weinmann read the secretary's
and treasurer's reports. The former
showed that two new members had been
added to the roll during the year. Fifteen
were dropped from the roll, two resigned
and one died, leaving the membership 181.
The decrease was due to the demoraliza
tion of business,' which forced many men
out in the last year. The treasurer's re
port showed that the balance and cash
received amounted to $1293 56, disburse
ments aggregated $613 91, leaving a bal
| ance of $679 65.
In his opening address the president re
viewed the year and referred to the diffi- .
culties that confronted insurance men iii
that period. He outlined the plans to be
followed and adopted this coming year
for the benefit of the organization.
D. B. Wilson read a paper on how in
surance was conducted forty-five years ago.
Lesley Bates made a plea "for local
board organizations and claimed that
San Francisco should have one whether
there was a general compact here or not.
Alfred R. Grim, in talking on "Counter
Business," stated his conviction that all
country insurance business should. be
placed in the local office, but should never
be taken by brokers to city offices.
A. W. Thornton spoke in favor of a non
cancellation -clause in policies. H. D. Bige
low read a brilliant essay on "The Sugges
tion of a Newspaper Man." This paper,
it was stated, was on how to conduct in
surance business and to avoid payment of
losses.

CAPITALISTS ORGANIZE
Many Prominent Men Meet to
Form a New Insurance
Company.
Henry J. and Charles H. Crocker
Appointed on the Committee on
Organization.
The Chamber of Commerce was well
filled yesterday when several men promi
nent in mercantile and manufacturing
circles, and also capitalists, met to estab
lish a new insurance corporation, :to be
known as the California Underwriters.
The object of this new organization, it
was stated, was to transact a fire insurance
business under the form known as Lloyds,
or as individual underwriters.
Thomas J. Parsons, president of the
Del Monte Milling Company, was called to
the chair, and J. D. Maxwell, .City agent
of leading fire insurance companies, was
asked to act as secretary.
The following prospectus was read by
the secretary, setting forth the aims and
purposes of the new corporation:
It is proposed to maintain in the City of San
Francisco an office known as California under
writer.
The name shall be the California Under
writers of San Francisco, Cal., and the number
of members constituting such underwriters
shall not exceed 100.
The said California Underwriters is organ
ized for the conduct of lire insurance business,
under the form known as "I.loyds," where in
dividuals may severally become underwriters
under policies of insurance, and where the
liability of members shall be several and not
joint, a 3 though each underwriter had issued
a separate and individual policy. Other classes
of insurance permitted by law may be under
taken at any time should the same become
advisable.
A manager shall he appointed by power of
attorney of the underwriters, who shall act
under control. and authority of the Board of
Governors, issue policies and conduct an in
surance business in the name of the under
writers. - The compensation of the aid man
ager shall be by commission only, which com
mission shall not exceed that which is usually
paid by stock Insurance companies to their
general agents, and the said manager shall pay
all expenses for the conduct of such business,
.except losses, legal expenses, advertising and
stationery, meaning that the California under
writers will not undertake to pay rents or
salaries.
The manager will be authorized to under
write for each member as follows: On one risk
not to exceed two hundred and tiny ($250)
dollars, on one risk bounded by four streets
not to exceed one thousand ($1000) dollars,
and on all such policies issued the liability of
each or any underwriter thereou shall in no
event exceed the sum of two thousand ($2000)
dollars.
The governors shall have access to all books,
records and property of the. underwriters.
All investments of money belonging to the
underwriters in real property or ln securities
shall be made by the finance committee or the
governors, who shall at all times have and re
tain the custody of such securities or proper
ties.
Membership in the California Underwriters
may be assigned subject to the approval of the
governors.
The cash subscription of each underwriter
shall be $500. The additional liability as
sumed by each underwriter shall be $1500.
Tne total liability of each underwriter shall in
no event exceed $2000. Such liability shall
be limited and stated on each policy issued.
The amount created by the cash deposits shall
be the reinsurance reserve fund required by
law. Losses and expenses shall be paid from
the premium income. The remainder of such
premium income, together with the income of
the cash deposits invested, may be divided
among the underwriters annually.
A committee, consisting of Henry J.
Crocker, Samuel G. Buckbee of Shainwald,
Buckbee & Co., Thomas J. Parsons ol the
Del Monte Milling Company, Charles H.
Crocker and J. D. Maxwell, was appointed
to prepare the form of organization.

>J,^ic*Â«S^ way has manifold
evils. As an old
colored Aunty used
to say: "There's always somethin' the
matter. If it isn't one thing it's two." The
most common trouble resulting from over-
exertion, either mentally or physically, is
constipation of the bowels, with all its at-
tendant horrors.
There is no human ailment that so saps
the energies, so deadens the ambitions, as
that coming from the bowels forgetting
their vocation, or the liver only work-
ing about eight hours out of the twenty-
four.
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets are the most
effectual remedy in the market. They work
upon the system easily, naturally. There
is no unpleasant nausea after taking them.
No griping no pain no discomfort. They
are composed of materials that go through
the system gradually, collecting all impuri-
ties and like the good little servants that
they are, disposing of them effectually.
Mrs. Rosann^ â¢ M. Bliss, â  of - Colosse, Os-
wego County x New York,- says:
"I , had suffered much with dizziness, some-
times faiutness from too much mental work.
Over exertion physically caused Constipation of
the bowels. I tned liver pills. They gave tem-
porary relief. | Two years ago I began using Dr.
Pierces Pleasant Pellets. I have, at intervals,
used three bottles, and I am now enjoying unin-
terrupted good health.",.

GOT OF HIS SKIN.
An Oreironijn Who Says Thai Ho
Might Be in That Pre-
dicament.
He Proposes to Help In a Very Good
Work, and Has Good Reason
to Do So.
Some people in this world who are brimful
of happiness have the faculty of keeping that
fact to themselves, as though they were afraid
that some of it might escape and they would
be a little poorer on that account. But there
are sensible folks, though enough to make up
for these poor misers, and one of these bright,
whole-souled men is Mr. E. W. Fowler of
Kamele, Or. Some time ago Mr. Fowler, who,
as has been noted above, was celebrated on ac-
count of his good nature and ins vivacity, be-
gan to droop a little. His smile had not that
sunniness nor his laugh that hearty ring as of
yore. Those who knew him began to sympa-
thize with him, to tell him how sorry they
were to see him "going down the hill," and a
hundred other equally dispiriting thing-.
And then they had Mr. Fowler as good as
under ground. But they were reckoning with-
out their host. They forgot that he was a man
of good sense and knew where to look for help,
and they had neglected to remember that the
grand old Hudson Medical Institute was still
in existence, and that its corps of great special-
ists were daily, nay, hourly, working wonder-
ful cures. The following letter will show how
wrong these prophets were:
KAMELE, Or.. Aligns! 8. 1895.
HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, San Fran-
cisco, Cal.â Gentlemen: Please excuse my negli-
gence in not writing you before. Ido not think
that I will need any more medicine, because I am

would jumpout of my akin with joy ! Many thanks
to you for your valuable treatment. 1 can and will
distribute about a hundred of -your new circulars.
Tours gladly. E. W. FOWLER.
You see, all the Joy has come back to that
man's heartâ all the life and hope. And there
are many hundreds of hearts on this Coast that
are glad to-day, and all on account of the
great skill of the specialists at the grand old
Hudson Medical Institute.
Mr. George H. Cent of Rochester, Ca!., says:
"By the time I have the medicine taken that I
have now I don't think I will need any more."
S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles: "I now feel as
though I was a cured and well man."
Mr. J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah: "I am
cured of the terrible disease that I had."
Now, when there is a never-ending stream of
testimony like this continually pouring in to
the management of the great Hudson Medical
i Institute (the grandest curative establishment
' on this continent, if not in the world) how can
j It be doubted but that there is HOPE FOU

Merry-Making.
Prince Carnival and his subjects bowed
low to the goddess of misrule last night
and when the shadows of the dawning
crept into the Hopkins mansion on
California street the confusion was still on
and the night had passed away with
naught but the echoes of laughter to dis
turb the perfume-laden atmosphere.
The long canvas lane leading from Cali
fornia street to the main entrance of the
institute was ablaze with Chinese lanterns
and electric lights and the carriages drove
up and deposited gayly attired ladies and
their escorts, while the natives from the
adjoining neighborhood gathered to wit
ness the arrival of Rex and his faithful
subjects.
From 8 to 10 the fairest ladies and the
most chivalrous men of tne land poured
into the old mansion and separated at the
foot of the stairs, passing on either side to
their respective dressing-rooms.
About 9 o'clock the entire building was
filled with couples, and the restless
throng clamored for the King to appear
and let them pay obeisance to his Majesty.
Overhead and on all sides hung the deco
rations of every color, with red lights pre
dominating. Magnificent tapestry, flowers
of â¢ every hue. callas, massive ferns
and palms sheltered the nooks and
lovers' corners, while the ladies of the
court clustered in multi-colored groups
beside the throne to await the com
ing of the King. In the conservatory
a bronze fountain played silver drops of
pure water over the foliage that enveloped
it, and between the leaves all the shellfish
of the sea peeped out and made the picture
grotesque and carnivalistic. A figure
of Venus de Milo looked down upon the
guests and half smiled between her marble
lips. From the surface of the polished
floors to the dome of the reception hall a
thousand hues and tints mingled, and the
festoons of ribbons fluttered in the air as
they were stirred by the passing of richly
attired ladies and ever-attentive noblemen.
Down the 'wide and glistening halls the
merrymakers wandered and grand dames
and patriarchal cavaliers with powdered
hair swept with haughty mem.
Suddenly from out the laughter and
merry-making a stentorian voice rang and
announced that the King would soon ap
pear. A burst of music floated through
the rooms and the great throng opened to
his Majesty.
First came the fool, with antics of the
half demented, waving his baton to the
passer-by, and nodding 'twixt his grim
aces to ladies and to budding girls who
stood near by with widely opened eyes J
gazing at the multitude of beauty.
Then came the King and on his arm the
Queen radiant with smiles and unfeigned
blushes mingled. On either side the boy
faced heralds blew upon their trum
pets and sent forth news viirt pleased the
populace. |
Behind the pages came uniformed young
sters burdened down with silken trails and
half ollicial dignity. Each one looked just
as though the carnival had been arranged
and manufactured for himself con
fidential rascals.
Behold! Now comes the Lord High
Chamberlain, heavy and weary with his
dignity. Clasped within his right hand is
the proclamation, mounted and trimmed
with ribbons gay and rolled upon a stick.
Lo! The music mingles with the measured
tread of royal feet, and the trumpets blare
as the King and Queen beseat themselves
upon the silken throne.
Then comes a lull, wherein the fool plays
pranks and advertises to the guests his
lunacy.
Slowly the royal monarch lifts his scep
ter and the Lord High Chamberlain reads
the proclamation amid the wildest cheers
at its conclusion. It was:
PROCLAMATION OF PBIKCE CARNIVAL.
Dc you hear, there? Pass this word among
the multitude and let it purchase silence for
the brief space of three hours and a quarter
while I, your Prince Carnival, Carnevale, Car
nelevamen, King of Folly and Abbot of Unrea
son do announce my state and order all things
to their worst confusion.
For I tun King of nil men, being King of
Fools, and my best subjects are your scholars
who think themselves the wisest, not having
wisaom enough to know that they are fools,
and thus fooling themselves with their own
folly. Then there be those men who are en
amored of foolishness for its own sake, ever

laughing at nothing, which is to say at them
selves. As for those who wear a solemn visage
'tis because they dare not open their mouths
in laughter for fear some one peeping iv shall
discover the emptiness of their skulls. And so
heaven help us all ! Woman was a happy
thought ! would be but a stupid world with
out woman. And so, being King, my tirst com
mand is that all men within my court to-night
shall use their best endeavor to please ail
women. And he that is a recreant to this trust
let him tremble and remember:

Ladies and gentlemen of tne Mardi Gras, we
welcome you to these enchanting scenes with
a right royal welcome, and thus saith the poet: I
" And the night shall be filled with music
And the cares that infest the day
Shall fold their tents like the Arab
And as silently steal away."
On the shores of the grand old Pacific
We have gathered together to-night -,* *
And with hearts lull of joy and of gladness
Cull a halt to old time aud his flight.
Golden Gate as it swings on its hinges
With the flowing and ebb of the tide.
In bringing this charming crowd hither,
Must have opened unusually wide.
You have come, my dear friends, to a city
Where on earth no such climate is found.
For here's where the strawoerry blossoms
And beareth fruit ail the year round.
What you see In this beautiful mansion
Beats everything seen up to date.
There is Joy for those who come early
But much more for those who stay "late.
As the best of the wine cometh latest,
Should you wish for the best of the fun
You will linger till you hear the echo
Of the Presidio's morning gun.
And now, my dear friends here assembled
Who have gathered from near and afar,
When we get down below where the wine Is
We will drink to the Fourth Mardi Gras.
There were two orchestras of the Hunga
rian type. One was known as Rosner's
and the other as Auber's. The former was
stationed in the ebony room and the other
in the balcony over the reception-room.
They alternated in discoursing music to
which a thousand tripping feet responded.
Sir Henry Heyman was the musical direc
tor.
His Royal Highness Prince Luigi of
Savoy, the* Duke of Abruzzi and lieuten
ant in his uncle's navy, danced with a
strawberry blonde. He wore an imported
smile and she a mask. Both seemed to
enjoy the mazy waltz as well as the long
draughts of lemonade that followed. Cap
tain Bertolini accompanied the descend
ant of the royal house of Italy to the af
fair and shared with the young and hand
some lieutenant of the Chnstoforo Co
lombo in all its enjoyments. Tne Italian
nobility seemed to be heart and hand with
the common folk of the Mardi Gras and
there was no complaint from either source.
The Duke of Abruzzi and the Duke of
' San Francisco, sometimes known as Major
Rathbone, hobnobbed together, and were
the objects of some curiosity. The Duke
: of Abruzzi wore the regulation uniform of
! an Italian naval officer, and the Duke of
! San Francisco was resplendent in a card
inal cutaway with knickerbockers and sil
ver buikles on his shoes. *
The supper was lit for the Rods. It was
served at small tables in the dining-room.
Of course no one overlooked this feature of
the, programme, not even the aitists them
selves. The menu was as follows:
Oysters a la Poulette.
Oysters Fancy Roast, on Toast.
Terrapin a la Maryland.
Shrimp Salad. Chicken Salad.
Roast Turkey.
Ham.
â¦ â¢ Tongue with Gelee.
Pate de Pole eras et Gelee.
Bread and Butter Sandwiches.
DKSSKKT.
Plumbiere and Nougat Icecream.
Assorted Cakes. Soiree Cakes.
Cameliu Cream Cake.
Pistache Cream Cuke.
Candies. Cafe.
Of course there was wine. It was sold in
quarts and pints. Otherwise there was no.
demand and no supply.
The scene in the large dining-hall, ani
mated with handsome men and women,
was one that would inspire the artist, par
ticularly if he were hungry.
But little originality prevailed in the
costuming. Handsome evening gowns
and tiny satin or lace masks were the
rule and character costumes the excep
tion.
Without doubt one of the most stunning
women present was Mrs. Joseph Tobin.
She wore a pink directoire costume and
carried an immense bunch of long
stemmed St. Joseph lilies. The only dis
crepancy in the costume was the hat, a
white Leghorn picture hat, with American
beauty roses. Mrs. Tobin wore no mask.
Mrs. Osgood Hooker wore an elegant
evening gown of delicate pink satin.
The corsage was cut extremely low and
fastened at the shoulders with jeweled
bands. In her hair she wore a diamond
aigrette. Her mask was of white lace and
barely reached to the tip of her dainty
nose. . - xi
Mrs. Alfred Bouvier's gown was of a
dainty black and white striped silk. The
jupe was made perfectly plain and the cor
sage cut V-shaped, back and front. She
wore a small black satin mask.
The Misses Lena and Sallie Maynard
carried off the palm for the best sustained
characters. Both young ladies were dis
guised as "Trilby" in a picturesque cos
tume. They wore :' full masks and suc
ceeded in completely mystifying their
most intimate friends.
Mrs. W. H. Taylor wore a pink domino
that concealed an elegant looking gown of
pink satin brocade. Her mask was of pink
satin. â¢'!-, ',:â¢â 'â¢ - ---.-,
Mrs. Jennie Blair and Mrs. Thomai
Magec both wore pink dominoes.
Miss Hyde wore a picturesque Alpine
costume. The short skirt was of black
sateen and trimmed with bands of vivid
scarlet. The peasant corsage was of black
and red and the tall Alpine hat of shiny
black satin trimmed " with numerous
bands of narrow scarlet . ribbon finished
with tiny rosettes.
Mrs. David Bixler wore a handsome
black satin gown trimmed with exquisite
Chantilly. Her ornaments were diamonds.
Miss Gertie Foreman made a fetching
white domino and wore a small white
satin mask.
Mrs. Colin; M. Boyd was attired in an
elegant gown of pale-blue brocade trimmed
with a flounce and bertha of rare old
point. Her ornaments were diamonds and
her mask, a tiny one, of white lace.
Mrs. A. L. Dodge wore a very handsome
gown of black brocade trimmed with some
exquisite old lace. -'â¢!;;' -t-^ J- S
Miss Froelich and Miss Davidson were
both attired in black velvet court costumes
and wore white Louis XIV wigs.
Miss Isabelle McKenna found it difficult
to conceal her identity under the stiff folds
of a white domino.
Mme. Ziska wore, with charming grace,
the Spanish costume. The gown was of
black satin, trimmed with innumerable
little flowers of black Chantilly. A lace
mantilla was caught round the face and
coquettishly fastened with a red rose.
Mrs. Henry Crocker wore an evening
gown of light blue silk, embroidered with
tiny rosebuds â Dresden pattern. Dia
monds were fastened in the coils of her
satiny black hair. They clasped the slen
der throat and glistened in the soft folds of
her gown. V V
Mrs. Volney Spalding's gown was of
white satin. Her ornaments were dia
monds.
Mrs. Irving Scott was attired in a mag
nificent gown of shimmering gray satin,
the corsage of which was trimmed witn a
magnificent bertha of point applique.
Airs. 'Wright made a picturesque and
fetching shepherdess in a black and red
satin costume; '*-
Mrs. Gaston Ashe looked extremely
handsome in a dotted muslin gown and
white picture hat.
Mr. Greenway was one of the few men
who appeared in costume. He repre
sented in a picturesque manner a Spanish
bull-fighter, and his costume, from the
tassels that dangled from his wide som
brero to the shining buckles on his low
cut shoes, was historically correct.
Major Rathbone wore his pink hunting
coat. James Phelan was a gentleman of
the court, and wore black satin knee
breeches and a powdered wig.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
â '
Carnival days arc with us. â  .
â âº
New Orleans is having the time that we
should have.
"1 do not know," says Mr. Huntington.
"I really cannot remember."
Rejoice in your pleasure while you have
it, for when it is Lent you can't.
Now that Congress has got down to busi
ness let us hope it will live up to it.
The only fault with the art carnival was
that it was not big enough to take in the
whole City.
It begins to look as if the Co'lis Pelican
in seeking for suckers had caught an Ala
bama alligator.
Brice and Frye object, but Morgan per
sists in turning on the cathode ray where
it will do the most good.
"I don't mind being caught," says Mr.
Huntington, "but what grinds me is that
I set this trap for California."
The trouble with the Custom-house is
that too many of its customs are scandal
ous and pay no attention to duties.
If El Paso would post herself on carni
val ideas she would find there is more fun
in a frolic than there is in a prize-fight.
The Huntington lobby no longer talks
of rushing thines. It is now fighting for
delay and calling for "night or Blucher."
At Dallas, at Hot Springs and at El
Paso pugilism has had its three strikes
without hitting anything and it is now out.
In all reform movements in this town it
is cheaper to fight than to back out, for no
one can take water without paying a high
price.
The members of the Junta call Rainey
"a white elephant," hut that raises two
questions: Is be an elephant? and, Is he
white?
As a result of being kept in the dark
<Jxmt tho races the fake poolrooms find
that their play is light, but still they are
not consoled.
As there is to be no change in the water
rates for the people there will, of course,
continue to be a great deal of change in
them for the company.
It seems that not only does Huntington
know nothing about the management of
the Central Pacific, but he has not even
a wicked partner who does.
In the French crisis the Cabinet con
tinues to hold a safe place in the middle of
the teeter board, but there seems to be some
danger of upsetting the President.
We have a better City, a better climate
and a population better fitted than that of
New Orleans for carnival splendors, and
we ought to get in some day and eclipse
her.
There was once a Democratic party that
dissolved into a Mugwump party, which
in turn became a Cuckoo party, but now
there doesn't seem to be any party there
at all.
Kentucky has a chance to do herself
proud in the performance of the double
duty of repealing the Southern Pacific
franchise and electing an anti-funding bill
Senator.
The trouble with Democratic harmony
in this City is that there is too many a fel
low in the orchestra who wishes all the
rest to be silent while he shows his Pade
rewski touch.
Now that both the Senate and the House
have arranged for an investigation of the
bond deals there is likely to be music in
the air all the way from the'Wbite House
to Wall street.
Congressman Talbert was wrong in say
ing the appointment of Morton as Secre
tary of Agriculture was the worst act of
Cleveland's life, for it was not half as bad
as keeping him there.
The prospects of defeating the funding
bill are now so good that the festivals this
year may be accounted as celebrations of
the establishment of the commercial inde
pendence of the State.
Senator Morgan may not have known
much about the true inwardness of the
Southern Pacific Company when he began
to cross-examine Huntington, but little by
little he is getting at it.
At the request of Balfour Parliament
decided not to debate the Venezuelan
question and the request was right enough,
for Uncle Sam can do all the talking that
Is needed on that subject.
As a challenge in the House that some
friend of Secretary Morton should rise to
defend him found do response, it is evi
dent there are fewer fools in Congress than
has been generally supposed.
It is one of the humors of the funding
bill investigation before the Senate Com
mittee that while Huntington could tell
nothing of what is in the books of the
Southern Pacific Company, he was able to
quote quite fluently from the Bible.
If it takes the military forces of the
United States and Mexico to keep two
prize-fighters from fighting when there is
no certainty that they wish to fight,' how
many Arizona constables would it take to
run them in for disturbing the peace by
talking too much?
THE BITUMEN VETO.
For the second time Mayor" Sutro has
been "compelled to veto an ordinance of
the Hoard of Supervisors referring to the
kind of bituminous rock that shall be used
in paving the streets and the manner in
which it shall : be laid, and in. both in
stances his action was made necessary by
the evident intention of 'both ordinances
to forward one set of private interests at
the expense of the other.
The veto handed down Monday evening
presented, two objections. One was the
requirement that the rock should not be
treated in open kettles. This would clearly
shut out the competition of those con
tractors who have invested heavily in such
appliances. The other was the provision
that the rock should be laid down on the
street in its natural condition. This would
not only shut out the open-kettle con
tractors, who have stationary plants, but'
would throw the monopoly of supply into
the hands of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and debar the numerous mines
owned by other parties who might be glad
to compete.
These features were sufficient to. make
the ordinance vicious, in the absence of
evidence that open-kettle treatment im
pairs the quality of the material. This is
a matter determinable only by very care
ful and scientific study, and there is no
reason for believing that the majority of
the Board of Supervisors is capable of
giving the subject that sort of attention.
Mayor Sutro suggests that the ordinance
be further amended to provide for a cer
tain proportion of a sharp beach sand in
the rock. That is an excellent idea, but
seemingly it might be carried further and
be made to include a wider range of tests.
Bituminous rock is a natural admixture of
bitumen and beach sand, and it would be
remarkable if this accidental combination
should have a constancy of proportions
throughout the State. . A certain propor
tion of sand, neither too much nor too
little, is absolutely necessary, but the
proportion of it that should appear cannot
be determined on a quantitative basis alone.
The bitumen itself is of various kinds,
some containing a larger proportion of oil
and volatile elements than others. Ordi
narily that which is the most plastic needs
the most sand, but as an excess of oil and
volatile elements impairs the cohesive
quality of the bitumen the addition of
sand would only aggravate the brittleness,
J even though it increased the hardness of
the pavement.
Hence the quality of the bitumen as well
as the quantity of sand should be taken
into account, and the ordinance should be
framed to cany both tests. In the treat
ment of certain rocks open kettles are
better than closed, and in others the
reverse is true. .All these matters deserve
intelligent attention. But the greatest
need of all is that the majority of the
Board of Supervisors abandon its attempts
to tame an ordinance having for its main
object the creation of private monopolies.
THE MINERAL LAND BILL.
The passage by the House without, a dis
senting voice of the Johnson bill for the
examination and classification of mineral
lands may be safely regarded as assuring
its passage by the Senate. If not a single
vote was cast against it in the House it is
a fair presumption that the justice and ex
pediency of the measure are so well under
stood in Congress there is little chance of
any opposition being strong enough to de
feat it. It would seem, therefore, that this
much-desired work is to be accomplished
at last, and that one of the most important
undertakings of the Mining Association is
to be crowned with success.
It is reported that Secretary Smith has
two amend which he will endeavor
to have the Senate make in the bill. One
of these is to increase the appropriation
proposed for the commission from $20,000
to $40,000. The other is to exempt, from the
operation of the act all lands already ad
vertised. The first amendment ought to be
accepted. Where the work to be done is
so important and so valuable it would be
poor economy to have it stopped because
of a lack of sufficient money to carry it on.
The second amendment is more doubtful,
and it certainly should not be accepted
unless it should be found that a rejection
would entail an opposition likely to en
danger the passage of the bill itself.
It is worth while noting that the success
which has thU3 far attended the measure
has been due very largely, if not wholly,
to the fact that the entire California dele
gation worked for it. For once our repre
sentatives were not divided, indifferent or
mutually antagonistic. Each gave what
aid he could to the measure and all, by
presenting an example of complete accord
on the subject, exerted an influence that
had its effect in inducing Eastern Con
gressmen to listen favorably to arguments
in support of the bill. We have in this
case, therefore, an illustration of what
Californians. can achieve for the good of
the commonwealth if they work in har
mony, and the lesson involved is one that
should be learned and applied with profit.
It will not be long before an occasion
will arise to make the application and
renew the harmonious work. The classifi
cation of mineral lands is but one of the
steps necessary to the full revival of our
mining industry. The next step will be to
obtain an appropriation for constructing
impounding dams that will protect the
farms and rivers and allow the resumption
of hydraulic mining. This second step
should follow the first closely and should
be carried through at this session of Con-
gress. Our representatives have seen what
united work can do in the one case and
they should now apply it in the other.
HOW TO ADVANCE.
If more of the newspapers of California
would give as Clear and definite reasons as
the Gridley Herald, showing the advantages
which settlers and investors would enjoy,
it would be better for the State. Thus, it
says that good building lots may be se
cured there for $100 to $125 each, the lots
being 80x110 feet, with a long time given for
making payments in easy installments.
"We will say," our contemporary adds,
"that the lot costs $100. A six-room dwell
ing can be erected for $300, the whole cost
not to exceed $400. This will readily rent
for $7 per month for at least ten months in
the year, or at a yearly rental of $70.
Figuring the taxes at $1 60 per $100 valua
tion, we have an expense there of $6 40,
which added to insurance of not to exceed
$5, makes a total of $11 40, which deducted
from the $70 rental, leaves a net return of
$58 CO, or 14.65 per cent on the money in
vested. It is certain that the ratio of in
crease in the valuation of the property will
more than balance the amount expended
for necessary repairs. These are no fancy
figures, but are based upon actual demon
stration. .To get the benefits this year,
building should commence at once. The
houses are needed, and the returns are
certain." \ v
The Lodi Sentinel prints an argument on
similar lines and reads its people a severe
lecture. "It is a fact," it says, "that farm
ers and fruit-growers trust too much to
their individual efforts for success. They
are willing, in most instances, to forego
assured profits for the sake of independent
action. .In the business world this feeling
is not prominent. There is a readiness to

join in movements which will benefit all,
directly or indirectly, which unfortu
nately is too often lacking in the country.
Capitalists stand ready to invest their
means in' factories in favored neighbor
hoods all over the State, waiting only for
some assurance that the people upon
whom they must depend for supplies will
act with them in developing a paying en
terprise.. In some places such assurances
have been given and the results are evi
dent .in the shape of canneries,
fruit-drying houses and sugar factories.
Where such factories exist prosperity is
found. Every individual reaps, or may
reap, a benefit. The population is in
creased, the home market for all products
grows and better prices for everything,
labor first of all, are secured. Lodi can
have a sugar factbry and a cannery. No
one man can bring them, but the united
efforts of a tenth of t.he people vitally in
terested will surely locate them here. The
benefits to be derived do â¢ not need setting
forth. Every man who can think knows
that they are tangible and certain. Let
the farmers and fruit-growers come to
gether and get them."
A HAKD EXPERIENCE.
The most uncomfortable position in
which Mr. Huntington ever found him
self was that in which Senator Morgan of
Alabama has placed him. That Mr.
Huntington keenly felt his disgrace
and humiliation all the correspondents
agree. Never before had be been placed
on the rack under circumstances which
permitted so much freedom of inquiry.
Although a few days ago, when the Ala
bama Senator made his first essay in the
examination, it. was evident that he was
not sufficiently informed, he was primed to
the tips of his fingers Monday, and he
went at the central figure of the funding
proposition hammer and tongs. Through
out all bis questioning there was evidently
a veiled feeling of contempt and scorn and
a determination to place the great man in
the light of a criminal who is giving false
testimony to save himself.
It was a dramatic and pitiful scene.
Mr. Huntington, in order to avoid telling
the truth, was forced to admit virtually
that he knew far less of the affairs of the
Southern Pacific than Senator Morgan
himself, who had given but a few days to
study of the subject. Mr. Huntington,
when it was impossible to pretend forget
fulness, boldly resorted to the only alter
native left him. The other members of
the committee, taking pity on their tor
tured friend, tried repeatedly to shut off
the Alabaman, but with a sharp retort
that always silenced them he returned to
the attach.
Mr. Huntington told a number of tales
familiar to Californtans. He had never
seen the books of the Contract and Fi
nance Company and could give no ex
planation of their disappearance; after
much evasion and hesitation he admitted
having been a member of that company.
He did give some new ami valuable in
formation. It was to the effect that the
small roads absorbed by the Southern Pa
cilic after the receipt of the Kentucky
charter were held merely through posses
sion of their stock; that no record ofthe
transfers had been made and that the
Southern Pacific is not responsible for the
debts of those lines. This will be cheerful
reading for the original owners of the
roads.
Mr. Morgan has not finished with the
great man, but will take him in hand
again next week. Meanwhile Mr. Hunt
ington will be -tortured to-morrow by a
man equally as sharp and persistent as
Morgan and a great deal-better informed
on this subjectâ Congressman Maguire of
California before the House Committee
on Pacific Roads. Mr. Maguire's misfor
tune is that he is not a member of the
committee and will doubtless find his lati
tude narrowly confined.
The whole situation is remarkable and
instructive, for it has now assumed that
odd and unaccustomed phase in which
Mr. Huntington is on trial for veracity
and honesty as well as a Government
debtor. As Mr. Morgan properly con
tended, it is the right and duty of Con
gress to ascertain if crookedness has ani
mated the policy of the roads.
CAREFUL GRAPE-PICKING.
It has been supposed that ait winemak- I
ers realized the importance of care in the
picking of grapes, and that the manner in
which this is done goes far to determine
the character of the wine. Attention is
called to this matter by an interesting re
port from Healdsburg.- B. W. Paxton,
who has been accompanying Mr. Lach
man of the Wine Association in a tour of
the Cloverdale and Healdsburg districts,
tells The Call that much of the wine,
though all was sound and of fair quality,
carried an excess of acid, and that the rea
son for it was the picking of the grapes be
fore the berries had fully matured. The
presumption is that the makers will re
ceive a smaller price than if the needed
care had been taken.
As a rule, those winemakers who do not
produce their own crop of grapes entirely
have very expert buyers. to receive the
fruit brought in by neighboring growers.
These buyers can determine at once under
what circumstances and conditions the
grapes have been picked, and they make
payment accordingly. The growers who
are most careful and intelligent receive
the best prices. That picking is an art of
itself may be inferred from the following
narration: {V t . â  ,': "". ' >i4y';--
A few years ago one of the largest wine
makers in the State examined a neighbor
ing vineyard which was ready for picking,
made careful tests .of the leading ingredi
ents of the grapes and offered a price based
on his tests. This was accepted and in a
day or two afterward the crop was picked
and delivered by the grower. The wine
grower on receipt of the fruit made a sec
ond test before accepting it finally and dis
covered that the proportion of saccharine
which he had originally discovered had
shrunk surprisingly. As this was a vital
matter be declined to pay the price he had
offered and tendered a lower. The grower
declined it- The grapes were fed to hogs
and a suit was brought for the recovery of
the amount first offered. ,
The maker proved in court that in the
interval between his two analyses a heavy
fog had fallen, that its moisture had been
absorbed by the grapes, and had, therefore,
diluted their juices and reduced their per
centage of saccharine, and hence . their
value, and that the grower had picked the
crop before tbe grapes had had time ; to
resume their normal condition under the
sun's heat. On that showing he easily
won the case. The whole affair was a
revelation to the grower, but he learned a
lesson that he will never forget. yyy - â 
Much of the great reputation â of Euro
pean wines depends on the care taken in
such details as that. The lessons to be
learned are all very simple, but they must
be mastered before the best results can be
secured. Happily, they are familiar to the
older growers, but that does not lessen the
obligation resting on winemakers to give
them all needed advice.
All the voices of Great Britain are now
for arbitration and there is not left a sin
gle man to say anything about the flying
squadron. --'â ;' -jy '"\ .
PHOTOGRAPHED HIS OWN BRAIN.
The human brain has been photographed. In
the rivalry of scientists excited by Roentgen's
application of the cathode X rays to photo
graphy, Dr. Carleton Simon of New York steps
forward and exhibits a picture Of his own
brain, obtained from a process in which the
cathode ray is not a factor. The doctor ex
plained to the Herald how the thing was done
and also furnished that paper witn the nega
tive from which the photograph was developed.
Dr. Simon said that he used an ordinary
camera, with platinum plates, subjected
neither to heat nor to any especial chemical,
treatment. The time of exposure was limited
to two minutes in the case of photographs re
produced in the Herald. Ordinarily, the doc
tor said, the time of exposure would be regu
lated by the depth of material through which
the light must pass. . v '
For the present Dr. Simon will not make
known the details of his apparatus. "I do not
like," he said, "to withhold it from the public,
DR. CARLETON SIMON'S PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS OWN BRAIN.
[Reproduced from the New York Herald.']
but I desire to more fully perfect it before mak
ing the details known. I produce the effect by
attraction of the light and propulsion through
the brain substance. '. At the time of photo
graphing the whole internal chamber of the
brain is lighted up.'
In conclusion the doctor said: "I am at the
commencement. My discovery is not conse
quent on the application of the cathode ray to
photography. My idea preceded it, but of
course, I have lately been inspired to push my
experiments."
For two days and a half the doctor worked
uninterruptedly, save a couple of. hours for
sleep, vvnen his tirea brain dreamed of its own
likeness. The work had not been without at
tendant dangers. Many small animals were
sacrificed in the cause of science. Even the
final and successful effort was made with no
assurance that the camera might not hold the
picture of a dead man. Though in a meas
ure satisfied that the process was one by
which the brain could be photographed with
out risk of life.it maybe stated that the ex
perimenter selected himself as his subject
that no other life might be endangered.
George Francis Train had consented to sit,
but the doctor finally decided not to permit
him to do so. As a matter, of fact the success
of the experiments was no less in that the
operation was without sensation than in the
reproduction of the brain picture... ... '
So far as the use of the apparatus was con
cerned the- doctor consented to say that the
light was thrown from one â  side of the head
against it, as In a magic lantern, while the at
tractive force was at the other.
He had arranged mirrors so that he might
observe the effects, and was thus enabled to
view his own brain. It was lighted up so that
he saw the interior and even . tne pulsations.
His sensations, so far as he had any, were at
the strangeness of the phenomena and emo
tions of success rather than any physical effect
produced by the forces he manipulated and
which were controlled by electric buttons, the
camera being exposed at the instant that the
light was directed at the head.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Joe Gavin, one of the leading citizens of
Cripple Creek, Colo., who is known from one side
of the continent to the other as a "dead game
sport," is at the Palace Hotel.
Mr. Gavin owns the finest saloon and the big
gest faro game in Cripple Creek. He was for
merly at Leadville and be lore that at Virginia
City, Nev. At different times he has contributed
his share to building up the leading mining
camps of California, Montana, Idaho, Utah,
Nevada, Arizona and Colorado, so he knows a
good prospect when he sees it.
"I suppose there is not another mining dis
trict on earth that has so much cold in sight
and easily available as Cripple Creek," said
Mr. Gavin last evening. "The entire country
in that vicinity seems to have itâ placer and
quartz. _.;^.Â». : -
"The work of development is going on con
j stantly, and where proper knowledge and
I facilities are applied there seem to be very few
disappointments and no failures. All the busi
ness men of Cripple Creek are making money,
but most of them are getting excited over the
mines and it is hard for them to keep at their
own business where the chances for making
fortunes in the mines appear so alluring.
"The distance from Colorado Springs to
Cripple Creek is only about forty miles, but it
takes four hours to make the run, for it is all
tho way uphill. You remember that Sutro
used to talk about Bill Sharon's 'kwoofced
wailwoad' from Reno to Virginia City;, well,
that road is straight as compared with the
line from Colorado Springs to Cripple Creek.
But we are used to it and don't fret on that
account. The people there live wellâ as well
as any place on earth, and the place is growing
right along. Just now houses are rather
scarce, but they are building night and day,
and will be able to" accommodate the hundred
and odd thousand of people who'are expected
within the next six months."
I . .Mr. Gavin was asked in regard to the special
train which tb-a telegrams said he and Bat
j Masterson were about to ; run i from Cripple
! Creek to El Paso for the purpose of witnessing
! Stuart's big fistic carnival. .
"Well, you see, it was like this," replied Mr.
Gavini j "the railroad folks wanted us to take
charge of the excursion, because we know all
the boys, and I said I'd stand in if they would
give us a vestibule train, with a big car in the
middle, from which we could remove the seats
and put in a bar, a wheel and a faro game. The
railroad people were willing enough, and it
would have been a go if those Congressmen in
Washington hadn't passed that law against
Fitzsimmons and his crowd. After that, with
those Government Marshals and the- Texas
Rangers prowling around, I saw it was no use;
so I declared myself out of the scheme and
came on to San Francisco. They wanted me to
hang on, but I said, "No, thank you; Uncle
Sam deals a game. that 1 don't care to buck
against." y.~ :y y';'- 'v"Vyyv

Applicant for pass (in light, breezy way)â Mr.
Fillmore, I am very anxious to take a trip with
my wife and three children to Salt Lake. Ah.
ah, how about passes?
Mr. Fillmoreâ Are you a married man ?
Applicant (shifting the right leg to the left
knee)â Well, somewhat. But jesting aside, Mr.
Fillmore, you know, I suppose, of ; that little
turn I did the company some years ago over in
Utah. Do you think it would be possible to get
transportation, as I suggested? -â .Â«Â«.
Fillmore (reaching for his pen)â l do not
recall the exact occurence you mention, but' I
know you have always laid awake nights try
ing to keep the people from imposing on the
railroad company. Ever been to Salt Lake?
Applicant (drawing up a little nearer)â No,
but I would like to go very much. Just for my
wife and chiidren, you know.
Fillmoreâ How old are the children ?
Applicantâ There are two boys, sixteen and
seventeen, and .a" girl twelve .. years of age.
You see, Fill, I intend to go. any way, but I
thought if you would give us passes that we
could have just that much more money to give
the children a good time on.
.Fillmore (dipping his pen in the ink and
opening a little drawer filled with blanks)â
Good scheme. How long will you be gone? â¢
Applicant (beaming with anticipation)â Oh,
a couple of weeks. Just a little jaunt. By the
way, Fill, you are looking very well of late.
How is your general health? Of course, I
know you are annoyed to death with appli
cations for passes, but I imagine you only'ac
cord them to friends of the railroad.
Fillmore (overlooking the "jolly" owing to
its chestnut flavor)â do you want to go?
Applicant (rising and leaning confidentially,
on the desk)â Well, we are all packed, ready to
go next Friday, and I have telegraphed my
wife's folks to expect us two days afterward.
Fillmore (with a winning- smile)â Are you
bound to go Friday?
Applicant â Oh, by all means. I have de
cided to go Friday. .â¦' .
Fillmore (closing the drawer and rising to
welcome one of the directors)â You will have
to excuse me now. (Looking the applicant in
the eye, as though to hypnotize him.) Come
in Saturday.
The applicant, thoroughly rattled, murmurs
deep thanks and retires to the hall, where he
suddenly drops on himself and goes down to
Montgomery street, cursing the elevator-boy
and the united railroads of the Southern
Pacific.

Trim tailor effects are coming to the front,
and-, the NorfolK jacket is a favorite model.
Cheviots, tweeds,serges and novelty wools are
used for these serviceable gowns that are ap
propriate for general wear, for traveling and
for the business woman.
The waist shown here has a fitted lining, the
goods being fitted by the pleats. The sleeves
are of the lee-o'-mutton shape, of generous
proportions. The skirt cut with a circular
front and two gores in the back which are laid
In box-pleats. The only stiffening now used is
a band from five to ten inches deep all around
the bottom. Haircloth wears best, but canvas,
wirene and many other substitutes are used.
Mixed woolen goods are much liked and the
top of each pleat may be decked with tiny gilt
or smoked pearl buttons. The favorite gilt
belt looks extremely well on such a gown.
A blue* serge gown had each pleat stitched
along the edges witn gilt thread and was worn
with a gilt belt.
A tan mixture had each pleat bound with
light brown leather and was worn with an inch
wide belt of the same material.
This style of waist is much used for bicvele
costumes, and the leather trimmings just de
scribed are especially pretty on these, the skirt
being bound with the same" leather.
The skirt shown in this illustration is one of
the newest shapes and is used for separate
skirts of silk, satin, crepon, etc., as well as
for costumes of one fabric.

Burns" by Mr. Swinburne. Its form is that
which Burns himself mostly employed, and its
eighteen stanzas form a tribute, of passionate
admiration and exquisite imagery and music
such as only Mr. Swinburne can give us. The
London Chronicle quotes a few stanzas, pre
mising that their beauty is still greater when
they are not thus torn from their context:
He loved and sang of love: he laughed
And bade the cup whereout he quailed
Shine M a planet, fore and aft,
And left and right.
And keen as shoots the sun's first shaft
Against the night.
But love and wine were moon and sun
For many a fame long since undone,
And sorrow and joy have lost and won
By stormy turns
A a many a singer's soul if none
More bright than Burns.
*******
The daisy by his plowshare cleft,
The liosot women loved and left.
The griefs and joys that weave the weft
Of human lime
With craft man's cunning, keen and deft,
He carved in rhyme.
****** ..V* ;./ J
But never since bright earth was born
In rapture of the enkindling morn
Might godlike wrath and sunlike scorn
That was and is
And shall be while false weeds are worn
Find word like his.
*******
Above the storms of praise and blame
That blur with mist his lustrous name
His thunderous laughter went and came
And lives and fliesâ
The roar thai fallows on the flame
When lightning dies.

DARING DAYLIGHT ROBBERY OF A BANK
The Market-Street Bank
Looted by Three
Masked Men. *
SHOT AT THE CASHIER.
Officials Forced Into the Vault
While the Coin Was
Taken.
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS.
P. J. Donohoe, an Architect, Saw a
Man Leave the Bank With
a Sack of Coin.
The liveliest bank robbery that ever oc
curred in San Francisco was witnessed by
the cashier and bookkeeper of the Market
street Bank yesterday morning at 10
o'clock.
Ordinarily the Market-street institution
is a very quiet place, but the scene was
very animated for a few moments at the
time the looters made their haul.
It appears that three men entered the
hallway which approaches the bank on
the right-hand side of the Gutzkow build
ing, and proceeded up to the cashier's
window, which one of them first climbed
through, following his entrance by calling
GEORGE H. HOPKINS, CASHIER OF THE LOOTED BANK.
upon the gentleman in charge to throw up
his hands and do it quick. The luck of
haste that Cashier Hopkins evidenced ap
peared to offend the robber who had suc
ceeded in entering so unceremoniously
through the wicker-framed window, so he
forthwith punctuated his demand with a
pistol-ball, which new past the head of the
cashier and lodged, after glancing from
a frame over one of the desks, in a door
of heavy oak.
By this time the cashier, who did not
seem to be in a hurry at first, suddenly I
took it into his head to do as requested j
ank the offending hands went up with j
great haste, after which another man wear- i
ing a Jong mask like his brother in crime I
crawled in .. through the entrance that
seemed to be most in use, and added to
several vociferous requests that both Cash
ier Hopkins and Bookkeeper Hayhurst
get into the vault and stay there" until
the men had helped themselves to the
loose gold and silver visible in the cash
tills on the left of the window. In the
meantime the third robber was maneuver
ing around the door which he had fast
ened by fixing a screw between the door
frame and the casing. What happened
after the desperate men had taken posses
sion of the office is best told in the words
of the cashier.
"I was standing at my desk," said he,
"when I heard some one coming into the
room from the hallway. I. turned and
started toward the window, but was sur
prised to see the first man bound through
it as lightly as a cat. He got on the coun
ter and took several steps to the right, all
the time carrying a pistol, which seemed
to be a foot long, in his hand. 'Throw up
your hands, I say.,' he commanded me,
but as I did not realize the situation I did
not obey him. "Throw up your hands,' he
yelled again, and immediately followed
his request by raising his revolver and
taking a shot at me. The bullet passed by
my cheek and lodged in the door after
glancing from a part of the top
frame of the desk at which I was working,
when the entrance of the three men
attracted me. Tbe powder marks are still
on my face. Then, and only then, did I
realize that robbery was intended anti 1
said: 'Do not make a fool of yourself. I
will throw up my hands of course. You
have the drop on me and I am willing to
quit.' In the interval when we were talk
ing the other burglar got through the
window and was giving his attention to
Mr. Hayhurst, who was also covered with
a gun. Immediately after my hands went
up both men approached us and ordered
that we get into the vault as soon as
possible." "â SPSS'
"Were you forced in the vault as stated
this morning?" inquired The Call repre
sentative.
"No, we went in without further parley.
What else could we do? We had no arms
and they had the dead drop on us. It
would have done no good to talk the
matter over when they seemed to be so
desperate and we retired at once. It was a
very fortunate thing that I had shot out
the bolts and locked tbe combination or we
would have been smothered to death."
"How did it happen that the bolts were
shot out and the combination locked ?"
"Well, live years ago I gave an order
when we were running a bank up in
Fresno that when the doors opened in the
morning the combination was to be set
and the bolts shot out so as to make it im
possible to shut the vault. I took that
precaution because I had read of so many
bank cashiers who had been locked in and
absolutely smothered to death before as
sistance could reach them or the combina
tion could be learned. It is very danger
ons to remain long in a" tightly closed
vault and 1 did not propose to be caught
in such a predicament. " '
".When we had entered one of the rob
bers attempted to close the doors entirely,
but the protruding bolts made it impossi
ble. They thought it was because the car

pet was in the way and one of them ripped
it up. The result was the same, however,
and the door still remainad open several
inches. This seemed to aggravate them
considerably and one suggested that we be
killed immediately. I distinctly heard
the words "Let's kill them." I suppose
they were too excited to nave me turn the
combination and shoot the bolts back and
had 1 been requested to do so it would
have taken me some time. However, in a
few moments after we had listened to the
threats and the curses of the raiders one of
them went over to the cash tills and I
heard the money rattlej as it was being re
moved. From the sound outside the door
I was pretty sure that it was being guarded
to prevent our getting out." â¢
DID NOT "WANT OUT."
Tho Cashier Says They Were Con
tented to Stay In the
Vault.
"Did you make any attempt to look
through the aperture made by the partly
open door so as to get a better sight of the
men for the matter of future identifica
tion?" was asked. T ' \
"Not the sligntest. We did not want to
get out. We were too well satisfied where
we were. There were a great many things
outside that we did not want to get mixed
up in. We were absolutely without arms,
and everything was quiet and peaceful
where we were. Oh, don't make any mis
take about our wanting to get out, even
just to take a look at, the way things lay.
At one time I thought of going to the
vault door and pushing it open, but Hay
hurst reasoned that it would be a foolish
thing to do, and I finally agreed with him.
We remained there something less than
five minutes, and could hear the men
moving about the bank helping them
selves. After a little time we heard the
front door open and close, as though some
one was leaving, and we came out of our
temporary prison to find the men gone
and a few coins of small denomination
scattered over the counter near where the
cashtrays usually are.
"I made a hasty examination of the office
and the safes, but found that nothing but
the trays had been disturbed. They got
away with some notes besides the coin, and
ni'.st have been very familiar with things
to jave arranged the plan so successfully."
"How much was secured in all?"
"That I could not say, as I have not yet i
counted the balance. There was not much, ;
however, as we never keep much coin in ;
sight. We do not propose to tell the amount
until it is definitely known."
"Is there not generally a revolver in the
vault?"
"No; had there been I would have made
a fight and stood mv chances of petting out
of it with a whole skin. I would have had
the advantage of such a fight from the start,
as the iron door was between me and the

the Hallway Watching the Front Door.

men. I very much regret that there was .
not a revolver on hand. I can assure you
that had there been we would have been in
a much different position from the one we
are in now. I was not in the least bit
nervous and felt as cool as I do this mo
ment. By George, it's too bad 1 hadn't a
gun," said Mr. Hopkins, with a grieved
expression, but it was perhaps better for
him that he was without that variety of
weapon.
"I could not describe the men with any
accuracy," he continued, "as they were
too well masked and it was all done so
rapidly. Further than the fact that the
man who burned me with*rowder was about
my size and wore a long coat I am unable
to give descriptions. The masks of all
three of them came down below the collar
and completely covered up the neck and
breast. 1 saw very little of the third man.
He appeared to be busy watching the front
door, having pulled down the curtain after
jamming in the screw to keep it tightly
closed. Ido not think he got inside the
railing at all, unless it was when I was in
the vault. Perhaps he came in at the door
near the end of the counter leading down
from the right, but if he did I was not
aware of it."
That was about all that Cashier Hopkins
had to say regarding the affair, and the
bookkeeper bore him out in so much as he
saw. The episode of the vault was sub
stantiated, but neither of the men had
much time to see anything.
There is no foundation to the statement
that all three of the men got into the ele
vator and forced the boy, Froyd Curry, to
take them to the top floor, where they
escaped into Stevenson street by the aid
of ropes previously fixed for the occasion.
Curry was in the basement at the time
the shot was fired, and says he heard the
report, but thought it was the failing of a
letter-press or some heavy piece of ma
chinery or office furniture. A close ex
amination of the fire escape was made
from the top story, and accumulated dust
remained undisturbed on each rung.
There is no reason to believe the men es
caped by that route, at least from the evi
dence secured after a very careful research.
Crowds of curious people hung around
the bank entrance all day, and the cashier
was the subject of much congratulation on
his narrow escape from death both by a
pistol shot and suffocation in the vault.
The following statements were made to
Detective Seymour a few minutes after the
robbery was reported at police head
quarters:
W. S. Hopkins, cashier, said: "This morning
about 10 o'clock, while I was standing beside
a desk, near the vault, I turned my head and
immediately after turning my head a fellow
poked a pistol at me and said, 'Hands up.'
The bookkeeper had his hands up already.
"One of the fellows jumped over the counter
and fired off his pistol. The man in the lead
who fired off the pistol was about 5 feet 9
inches, weight 150 to 160, had on a soft hat.
and ."lark clothes, black mask tied around his
face, covering his nose and mouth.
"After he fired the shot I told him not to act
so foolish. The other two men then came up
and forced me into the vault, and I said,
'That's all right.' I knew the vault could not
be locked, as the custom is to keep the bars
thrown out, so the vault cannot be barred.
"They worked quite a while, and I guess we
were in the vault about three minutes, and as
soon as the men got out of the bank we gave â¢
the alarm.
"The elevator-man was in the basement and
the janitor was on the fifth floor. 1 grabbed
my pistol and ran right out. It was not two
or three minutes after 10 when this happened.
I think the last man who had come in had
pulled down the curtains and closed the door.
"I cannot tell how much is taken. I do not
think it will be a great deal. I unlocked the
vault door this morning. There is some money
in the vault. I can't say whether they got
money or not out of the vault. I can't say
until 1 have a private talk with Hayshurst.
"The most peculiar feature of the matter is
that two little coin trays usually on the coun
ter I" find now in the safe, which to me
is a very strange thing. The Bank of Califor
nia is our correspondent. We were formerly
in Kmgsburg, Fresno County. I cannoÂ£give a
description of the other men . The skin of No.
1 looked brown, as though in the sun a great
deal."
J. F. nayshurst, accountant, said: "Mr.
Hopkins and myself opened the bank at 9
o'clock. A few minutes before 10 o'clock three
masked men came running in the bank and
leveled their revolvers at us. They hollered
for me to hold up my hands. I did not obey
the first command, and at the second command
1 saw that I could not get at my pistol, it being
on the counter, so I did as they demanded.
"One of the men jumped through the window
of the paying teller's desk and commanded
the cashier to throw up his hands. He did not
comply until the third command. Before the
third command the man fired a shot over
him. Then the men forced us both into the
vault. ,
- "We always keep the bars thrown out so that
the vault cannot be barred. While we were
in there they talked about killing. They were
in the bank three or four minutes after we
were in the vault, and as soon as we heard the
door close we gave the alarm."
At this point President Lillis sent Hay
burst off on a message, and the balance of
his statement could not be taken. '
THE ROBBERS SEEN.'
P. J. Donohoe, an Architect, Saw
the Man With the Coin.
P. J. Donohoe, an architect, whose office
is at 330 Pine street, saw one of the robbers
as the latter was leaving the bank with a
sack of coin in his hand.
Mr. Donohoe told his friend Arthur Mc-
Guerren, at the corner of Market street
and Park avenue, the following story:
I happened down that way this morning
about 10 o'clock, and when near the bank!
. heard something that sounded like the report
of a firearm, although at the time I did not
think that it could be a pistol shot at such an
hour of the day.
A few minutes afterâ could not have been
more than two or three minutesâ l saw a man
a little above medium height come out of the
bank carrying a sack in his hand.
It looked like a sack of coin, and, in the light
of subsequent events, it probably was the best
coin of the realm. -
At the time, of course, I did not pay much at
tention to the incident. Afterward I was glad
that I had noticed the man with the sack. I
think I could identify him if he was brought
before me. As to his'dress I cannot speak with
as much confidence.
Thinking that the man with the sack in his
hand was an employe of the bank I did not
pay further attention to him, and could not
| say where he went after he left the bank doors.
President Lillis, as referred to above, was
closeted with Captain Lees la.-t night.
What he said to the chief of detectives was
afterward repeated in part to the reporter.
He has the most implicit confidence in
the honesty of the cashier and bookkeeper
and poohpoohs the idea that the robbery
was an impromptu dramatic performance
gotten up for the benefit of the principal
actors.
Beyond giving the amount of the money
taken Mr. Lillis could give little other in
formation of interest or importance. "In
fact," he said, "there is nothing more to
say. The story is told. The robbers were
there and the money is not there."
THE MONEY STOLEN.
Description of the Robbers as
Given by the Bank Officials
to Captain Lees.
President Lillis, Cashier Hopkins and
Accountant Hayburst had a consultation
last night with Captain Lees, and the
captain advised them, for prudential
reasons, to make public the exact amount
stolen by the robbe
The total money stolen was $3600; of
this there was in currency $200, in silver
$400 and in gold $3000. There was $40 in
new dimes. $16 in nickels, $40 in $1 and $2
old bills, ten $20 bills and $200 in new *>5
gold pieces coined in 1895.
It was also decided to give for publica
tion a full description of the three robbers,
which is as follows:

Unanimously Adopted. -
The Howard Republican Club held Its
regular semi-monthly meeting last even

members were present. After the regular
business of the club had been transacted
the club was addressed on the political
situation of the day by Chris Newman,
Thomas F. Graham, Fred Eggers and
others. The members were then enter
j tamed by an interesting programme, of
j songs, music and recitations. John W.
Koch, corresponding secretary of the
club, then introduced the following reso
i lutions which were adopted: .
Whereas, The financial and industrial con

bill looking to the speedy completion of such
canal.
TWO PHYSICIANS AT OUTS.
Doctors Ford and Fields Seri
ously Disagree Over a
Case.
SCARLATINA SIGN TORN DOWN.
Dr. Lovelace Agrees With Dr. Field
and Says No Scarlet Fever
Symptoms Exist.
Dr. Campbell Ford has prepared a letter
complaining of negligence in the Health
Department. Yesterday morning he for
warded one copy of this letter to Mayor
Sutro and another to the Board of Health.
The letter reads as follows:
San Francisco, Cal., Feb. IS, 1896.
To the Hon. A. .iutro. Chairman, ami Members
of the Board of Health of Han Franciscoâ Df.ar
bias: 1 wish respectfully to inform you that
on the night of February 8 Mr. Beverly called
at my office, 734? i Broadway, and requested
me to visit his child. 1 accompanied him and
called at 1803 Dupont street.
I found the child, aged 6 years, had during
the previous week hurt its knee by failing
downstairs. From the angry appearance of
the knee, and as Mr. Beverly'* brother-in-law
was ill in the house with erysipelas, I sus
pected that the knee had been infected with
erysipelas and so informed him. In addition
the child was covered from head to foot with
a scarlet rash. 1 ordered the child isolated
and under treatment its improvement was de
cided by the next day, and by the 12th the
rash had disappeared and the skin commenced
to desquamate, completely confirming the
diagnosis of scarlet fever. 1 ordered the child
annointed with oil and bathed.
On the following morning, February 13, 1
addressed a communication to the Health Of
fice, informing them there was scarlet fever at
1803 Dupont street.
I did not call the following day, the child be
ing convalescent. I called on the 15th and
noticed the house had not been quarantined.
I called again in the afternoon, accompanied
by Dr. J. C. Stinson, and was met by Mr. Bev
erly, who indignantly informed us that a man
called with "his little pots and pans, ".went in,
looked at the child and said that it did not
have scarlet fever and departed without quar
antining the house.
I lmmeaiately called on Dr. Lovelace, in
forming him ot the facts. I also interviewed
the Inspector, who admitted that he had re
ceived my notice, called at the house and failed
to put it in quarantine; he gave as an excuse
that he saw the child In the bed playing with
its toys, and that the woman who opened the
door told him that the child did not have scar
let fever.
This seems to me a flagrant, gross criminal
neglect of duty not to quarantine this house;
not only on account of the serious nature of
the disease, but because Mr. Beverly, father
of the child, is the proprietor of the Elgin
Dairy, which daily distributes its milk
throughout the City, furnishing & means of
readily carrying the contagion far and wide.
I call your attention to the fact that the most
common way of spreading this dread disease,
which is estimated to have caused one-twen
tieth of the entire mortality of England and
America, is by means of milk. The rapidity
with which the germ life . of scar
let fever multiplies in a suitable
medium, such as milk, ie well known.
One scale of the millions that are thrown off
from the skin will, if dropped into milk, make
a solid mass of culture the size of a teacup
within four hours. Cattle and calves are also
susceptible to the disease, and in that way will
increase the contagion. it is well known that
the disease is increasing in virulence, and in
stances, are recorded where milk is known to
have carried scarlet fever to half the families
to which it had been delivered, although it
had not been touched by the milkman or other
members ot the infected family. It is my firm
belief that not only the house, but also the
dairy should be quarantined until all danger
of contagion is past, and all articles subject to
the liability of infection have been thoroughly
disinfected.
"This letter," said Dr. Ford yesterday,
"clearly sets forth the whole matter.
"The seriousness of the case, owing to
the fact that the father of the child is a
dairyman who personally attends to the
distribution of his milk to customers, can
not be enough emphasized.
"Milk is the most favorable medium for
propagating the disease known. I have
learned that last Monday Mr. Beverly was
granted a license to sell milk. This shows
conclusively that the case has been ac
corded very little notice by the Health
officers.
"It is more directly the fault of the in
spector. His duty is simply to go to the
house mentioned as infected and to tack a
placard upon the door. It seems that this
inspector, a Mr. Fay, entered the house
and, deciding that the child did not
have the disease, went away without pay
ing any more attention to the matter.
"The case demands a thorough investi
gation.
"How did the disease get into the fam
ily? It might have been carried to the
child by the father. Not only this, but
erysipelas can be carried through the milk
in the same way. This disease is nearly
as virulent as scarlet fever.
"The dairy should be quarantined until it
has been definitely settled by microscopic
examination of the milk as to whether or
not scarlet fever germs exist in it."
Health â¢ Officer Dr. Lovelace said:
"There has been a great deal of unneces
sary talk about this matter. In the first
place, on receiving the notice from Dr.
Ford, 1 sent Inspector Fay to the house.
He returned and said that since the visit
of Dr. Ford to the child the family had
had Dr. A. M. Fields examine its condi
tion, and he found the child showing no
symptoms of scarlet fever whatever.
"There has been no negligence," contin
ued Dr. Lovelace. "It is simply a dis
agreement between two physicians.
"I went to the house and examined the
child myself. I found not the slightest
symptom of scarlet fever, nor of erysipe
las. The child was simply suffering from
an abscess in the knee, induced by a fall.
"I had Mr. Fay tack a scarlet fever
notice on the house yesterday, but after I
examined the child, as I say later, I tore
the placard down.
"There is no necessity of posting up
such a notice with simply a sprained knee
in the house."
Dr. Fields examined the child Monday.
*'[ found no rash, only an abscess on the
child's leg," said lie. "There were no
symptoms of scarlet fever. It is true the
child hart some fever, but no more than
would be caused by a local inflammation."
There are 2487 different varieties of fire
escapes and ladders to be used in emer
gencies.

THE COUNCIL OF
THE CHURCHES
First Session of the Body
" That Is to Try Dr.
Brown.
HEARING OF TESTIMONY
The Pastor Objects to the Inter
pretation of the Letters-
Missive.
MISS OVERMAN IN ATTENDANCE
A Committee Appointed to Receive
Chargesâ Many People Fail to
Gain an Entrance.
The ecclesiastical council called to pass
on the charges of immoral conduct resting j
against Dr. C. 0. Brown, pastor of the I
First Congregational Church, began its ;
official existence yesterday at 2 o'clock.
After live hours consumed In motions,
resolutions and counter-resolutions and an
almost endless interchange of ideas, in
which Dr. Brown was not infrequently j
heard either in protest or commendation, !
the council perfected a permanent organi
zation, limited the scope of their investi
gations and then adjourned to meet to
day at 2 o'clock.
Long before the hours named in
letters-missive for the convening of
the council people began to gather
at the Mason-street entrance. They
clamored for admittance, but two big
policemen gently, though persuasively,
refused to hearken to their appeals. The
protestations of the anxious ones came
first in whispers, then in sidetalk and
finally in a clamorous demand that the
gates be open. But the guardians of the
ace had other orders.
In the meanwhUe 2 o'clock had arrived,
and in the lecture-room where the council
was to convene some thirty or forty per
sons were gathered, including the princi
pals of the great scandal, and those who
have battled most earnestly and fearlessly
tor the good of the church.
Dr. Brown, accompanied by hi? wife ana
Miss Overman, was among the first to
enter the room. They looked calm and
confident, and apparently in good humor
with the world. Attorney Nugle arrived a
few moments later, taking a chair just be
hind that of Dr. Brown, and across the
aisle and one row back of them sat Mrs.
Cooper and her daughter Miss Hattie.
Attorney Bartnett occupied a chair on the
right of Mrs. Cooper. Rev. John W. Ellis
of Oakland came in shortly after the
council convened, taking a seat near Dr.
Brown, the two holding frequent and
earnest whispered conversations.
Miss Overman, who, for a time, was the
observed of all the observers, was probably
the happiest-looking member of the pas
tor's little party. If she was nervous or
fearful of the coming ordeal, or if the Tun
nell letters, which she will be called upon
to explain, gave her any uneasiness, ncr
face gave no out outward evidence of it.
Miss Overman was dressed in a handsome
suit of black and wore a neat little bonnet
with green trimmings.
Just before the council came to order
Rev. Mr. Hal leek, pastor of the First
Chore of Tacoma, entered the room, and
mating direct lor Dr. Brown and his party
spoke a few encouraging words to each.
Dr. Halleck succeeded Dr. Brown at Ta
coma, and is in one sense an old friend of
all the principally interested parties.
Prompt to the minute the members com
posing the council filed into the lecture
room from the library. Temporary or
ganization was effected "by electing Dr. W.
C. Pond chairman and "Rev. George B.
Hatch scribe. Rollcall showed the follow
ing members present:
I'lymoutn Church, San Francisco, Rev. Dr.
Williams, Deacon 8. F. Bufford; Bethanv
Church, San Francisco, Dr. W. C. Pond and
A. P. Ruthaff; Third Congregational Church,
Dr. William Rader and J. D. McKee; First
Church. Oakland, Dr. S. M. Freeman, J. M.
Haven; Plymouth-avenue Church, Oakland,
Dr. J. K. McLean, Professor George Mooar;
First Church, Alameda, Rev. W. W. Scudder
Jr., Â£. J. Dodge; First Church, Berkeley, Rev.
G. B. Hatch, Thomas Addison; First Church,
Sacramento, Dr. 11. N. Hoyt, M. J. Curtis;
First Church, Stockton, Rev. R. H. Sink, J. C,
Holbrook; First Church, San Jose, Rev. J. M.
Tenney, William Ross.
The council then went into permanent
organization, electing Dr. J. K. McLean
moderator, A. L. Barker assistant moder
ator. Rev. G. B. Hatch scribe and Deacon
Bufford assistant scribe. With this for
mality completed the doors were opened
and the anxiously awaiting throng al
lowed to pour themselves into the lecture
room. Five minutes later there was not a
vacant seat to be had.
Dr. McLean read the one hundred and
twenty-second psalm, followed by an
earnest, fervent prayer, in which he in
voked the earnest "blessing of Almighty
God on the .First Church and the delibera
tions of the council. The moderator then
announced the organization of the council,
concluding with the remark that the Bole
charges to be considered were embodied in
the letters-missive.
The first sensation, if such it might be
termed, came when Dr. Brown addressed
the council saying that he questioned
their right to meet before the appointed
time. He had read in the newspapers
that they had held a long consultation the
evening before and he wanted it distinctly
understood that ho protested against such
action.
Dr. McLean then asked with some show
Three of the Prom nent Figures in the Council to Investigate the Moral Character and Ministerial
Standing of Dr. Brown.
of uneasiness if he challenged their right
to proceed with the investigation. The
pastor disclaimed any such intent but in
sisted on his right" to know everything
that had been done at Monday's meeting.
The secretary then read the minutes of
the proceedings, showing that the matters
discussed had been confined to the course
of procedure in the trial and that a com
mittee of two had been appointed to re
ceive and formulate. charges. Dr. Brown
objected vigorously to this last, but when
assured that no action had been taken
withdrew his remarks.
The pastor then sprang another little
alarm by asking Dr. Pond if Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper had not approached him with evi
dence calculated to influence his mind.
He intimated that if this was true he
would certainly object to the reverend
gentleman continuing a member of the
council. i'~yy
Dr. Pond, however, cleared the atmos
phere by admitting that Mrs. Cooper had
done the things suggested by Dr. Brown,
but that he had not even considered them,
consequently his opinion was not in the
least biased.
The event of the day came when Attor
ney Woodhams as representative of the
church gave his interpretation of the let
ters-missive. He referred to the Overman
incident and the Stockton episode, and
how it came about that Dr. Brown paid
$500 to secure evidence against Mrs. David
son.
Dr. Brown objected to the second
clause of Mr. Woodbam's statement relat
ing to charges current in the community.
He said it was a dragnet and should not
have been inserted. The attorney replied
that if things grew out of the main charges
reflecting on the character of Dr. Brown
they should certainly be investigated, be
cause no one wanted any after-talk.
Nearly every member of the council had
! something to say on this point, though Dr.
| Mooar seemed more vigorously opposed
than any to limiting the scope of the in
vestigation.
He said that three points were involved
lin the letters-missive; first, the moral
! character of Dr. Brown ; second, his min
isterial standing; and third, his pastoral
| relations with the church.
After an hour's argument for and
; against Mr. Woodhams' suggestion, in
: which Dr. McLean, Dr. Brown, Dr. Rader
! and Key. Mr. Tenney took an active part,
the council adjourned to the library to ar-
I rive at some conclusion satisfactory to all.
I The deacons, Dr. Brown and Mr. Wood-
I hams were asked to participate in the de-
I liberations. At the expiration of three
; quarters of an hour the council returned
j to the lecture-room, Dr. McLean announc
ing that a committee of three had been ap
pointed to correctly interpret the letters
i missive.
At the evening session Mr. Tenney,
| chairman of the committee, made a report
in effect that the letters-missive called
i for an investigation only as to the moral
character and ministerial standing of Dr.
Brown.
Tho pastor had gained the first point,
and the smile which lighted his face when
this announcement came showed that he
did not undervalue its importance.
Messrs. Hoyt, Rader and Williams were
appointed a committee of three to receive
such charges as members of the church
and outsiders might desire to prefer
j against Dr. Brown.
i Mr. Hoyt as chairman announced that
| the committee would meet immediately
after the council and again this morning
i at 9 o'clock, prepared to receive and lav
! before the council all matters pertaining
to Dr. Brown's character.
The result of the first day's proceedings
of the council may be briefly termed a de
i cided victory for Dr. Brown. He carried
every point that he made, and was sus
tained in all his objections. Persons hay
, ing charges to prefer against him must
present a cony of the same to him, in or
der that he may be able to make a proper
defense.
He is to enjoy all the rights of a de
fendant in legal proceedings and to offer
: such testimony in rebuttal as he may have.
In a word, Dr. Brown has drawn first
blood.
"This is the happiest day of my life," he
said. "I am confident of success, though
; I am aware that perjured testimony will be
! offered."
The council will meet to-day at 2 and
7 :30 p. m. It is probable that morning ses
sions will also be held after to-day.

| THE PROCEEDINGS.
Opening: of the Council by Which
Dr. Brown Is Being: Tried.
The Pastor's Protest.
Promptly at 2 o'clock Rev. Dr. W. C.
, Pond called the council to order, every
member being present and seated on the
; platform of the lecture-room. Dr. Pond
: was then elected temporary chairman,
I and Rev. G. H. Hatch temporary secre
tary. Without loss of time Rev. Dr. J. K.
McLean was chosen moderator, and Rev.
â  G. H. Hatch scribe of the council, ana S.
< F. Bufford assistant scribe.
Rev. Dr. Pond then suggested that the
\ doors be opened to all who wished to at-
I tend, but this met with objection from Dr.
Brown, who expressed the belief that the
church members and the pewholders
I should first be accommodated. He de
manded this finally as a right.
Moderator McLean asked if the council
j wished to act on the suggestion of Dr.
Brown, and it was decided to open tbe
i doors for this occasion only to all comers.
A suggestion was made that an assistant
â  scribe he elected, and Hoyt, Mooar, Barker
j and E. C. Williams of Oakland were nomi
| nated. On the first ballot Hoyt received 4
votes, Mooar 4, Barker 8 and Williams .',.
No one having received a majority an
â . other ballot was taken, which resulted in
the election of Barker.
Dr. McLean read a passage from the
; Scriptures and led in prayer, invoking the
j aid of God in the deliberations and de
j cision of the council. He then remarked:
This body has now been rightly and for
. mally established and is therefore ready to

proceed to business. What is the first business
that comes before us? The moderator pre
sumes it will be the reading of the letter
missive. The sole charter under which this
council can act is the letter-missive. No other
matter can be taken up except what is men
tioned therein. That letter will now be read
by the scribe.
Scribe Hatch then read a copy of the
letter-missive, as follows:
The First Congregational Church of San Fran
cisco, Cal., to Church, , seudeth

to the preservation of -my rights. From ac
counts in the public prints I note that what
purports to have been a meeting of this council
was held yesterday afternoon. I would like to
know if such meeting took place.
Moderator McLeanâ There was no meeting of
the council. It did not come into existence un
til 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Dr. Brownâ l wish to state that this council
has no right to hold any meeting. I know my
rights and the meeting that was held yesterday
afternoon is a thing unprecedented in Congre
gationalism.
Dr. McLeanâ Does the moderator understand
that you challenge the right of the council to
go forward?
Dr. Brownâ No, sir. But I was told by one of
the members of the council that the council
was to meet in Deacon Barnard's oflice. I have
never before known of a meeting of a council
or any part of it before its regular session. I
think that all that was done there should be
stated here, that I may know tbat my rights
were not in any way interfered with or in
jured.
Dr. Pondâ l move that the secretary of the
informal meeting held yesterday be directed
to read the minutes of that meeting.
Secretary Hatchâ was no organization
yesterday. The meeting was called to order
by Dr. McLean, and after a while a secretary
was chosen, who was instructed to note down
for the use of the council what passed infor
mally at this meeting, and these were the min
utes that were noted down. [Reads] :
"It was decided, lirst, that when the council
was called to order it should be called Infor
mally to order by the oldest settled pastor, in
this case Dr. Pond. A scribe pro tern, shall
then be elected and complete organization
effected. It was voted that the opinion of the
council is that of a majority of the churches
represented in the council-* that a vote tobe
passed must be favored by a majority of Indi
viduals, and that a quorum is to be taken ac
cording to the custom of the church. Voted
that the expense of the council should be
divided among the churches participating
and that Mr. Woodhams be asked to secure a
stenographer, i-:- â -;
The next vote was that it was the sense of
the meeting that the council should have full
control of the room where it meets, to admit
whom it pleases during the sessions of th"
council; that the sessions might be held in the
lecture room of the First Congregational
Church.
Voted that the committee of the church
should be requested no: to raise any Objections
to the proceedings of the council, and that a
committee of two be appointed to formulate
charges against the accused pastor.
Voted that the scope of the investigation is
to be determined by the letters and missives as
interpreted by Mr. Woodhams, who represent-!
the church. y:yyy---.
Voted that no attorneys as attorneys should
be admitted into the conduct of the" case- no
information of this meeting be given out 'ex
cept that methods of procedure have been
discussed; that the sessions of the council
shall be held each day at 2 :30 p. m. and 7:30
Dr. Brownâ is one statement in that
report to which I should enter a very serious
objectionâ that a committee of two should be
appointed to formulate charges. The record*
of mv church will show that the members of
my cnurch have never made or presented any
charges against me. The First Congregational
Church on five votes was overwhelmingly with
me, and there have . been no charges made
The word "charges" was occasionally put in
the letters-missive, and if that is to be adopted
as the basis of your proceedings, I protest
against them.
Scribe Hatchâ By the same accident that In
serted the word "charges" in the letters
missive the word got into these minutes. it
was used informally. It was thought that some
one would make charges or offer information,
and that these matter would be proper to refer
to a committee.
Dr. McLeanâ We are discussing a matter of
an unofficial body. The proper time to raise
the point is when an attempt is made to ap
point the committee.
Dr. Pondâ idea was to have the com
mittee place before the council
Dr. Brownâ lf that clause is withdrawn I
shall withdraw my objection. But I have one
more inquiry to make and that is to inquire of !
the Rev. Dr. Pond, who becomes now one of
my jurors, whether he has been approached by
a certain person with evidence and a statement !
as to the Innocence or guilt of the person ac
cused.
Dr. McLeanâ Does this cover the period since
his appointment as a juror in this matter?
Dr. Brownâ covered the period while the
joint committee appointed to investigate this
matter was in session. I think I have the right
to raise the question whether his mind has
been biased.
Dr. Pondâ My mind has not been biased by
anybody. A number of persons have expressed
their opinions to me that Dr. Brown was inno
cent and others that lie was guilty. But noth
ing was ever said to me that I would allow to
weigh on my mind a moment.
Dr. Brownâ Mrs. Cooper call on you with
evidence?
Dr. Pondâ She called and conversed with me
about the matter.
Dr. Brownâ Did she express any opinion as
to my guilt or innocence? >:
Dr. Bondâ that you were guilty. I did
not weigh the evidence.
Dr. Brownâ l want to say to Dr. Pond that I
am perfectly satisfied. I was accused by one of
the representatives of the press of being in
strumental in securing the meeting of yester
day far my own purposes.
Dr. McLeanâ l think that it Is due to Dr.
Brown and to the council to say, if the ques
tion should be raised as to what agency he had
in the selection of the council and what In
fluence he had in tho construction of the let
ters-missive, that he had no voice in the one
or the Other. The statement has been made
that he selected the council and framed the
letters-missive. The council judges it would
be proper to have other questions asked and
have the matter settled.
Attorney Woodhamsâ l think lam author
ized to speak on that question as the represen
tative of tho church. I have conversed with
tin deacons In regard to this matter, and de
sire to say that I have prepared a statement in
advance. In a portion of my statement are
these rumors that Dr. Brown had influenced
the appointment of the council and the fash
ioning of the letters-missive.
Dr. McLeanâ The consultation held yester
day was not it: any way to prejudge anything
that Should come before it, when it should
have legal existence, but to formulate a course
of procedure as a large majority of the mem
bers had never before been called upon for this
kind of work.
At this point Attorney Woodhams was
asked to present the records of the church
providing for and authorizing the council,
which ho did. He also filed a copy of the
resolution empowering him to represent
the church before the council.
On the moderator asking for the next
matter to be acted upon Dr. Pond made a
motion that the scope of the letter-missive
be interpreted by Mr. Woodhams as he
understood it.
Dr. Mooarâ l presume I would be willing to
vote for the substance of the resolution but I
object to the form in which it is stated. It is
stated as though tlie letter-missive would be
interpreted by Mr. Woodhams. We would like
to hear what he has to say on the matter, but
it the province of the council to Interpret
the letter-missive as it thinks proper, and I
should not like to be restricted by his inter
pretation.
Mr. Woodhamsâ l do not wish to place any
restriction on the action of the council, i
should prefer to give my interpretation first
and then let the council bind itself.
After soma further discussion the mat
ter was laid on the table, and then Rev.
Mr. lenny made the following motion: '
I move that we hear Mr. Woodhams on the
letter-missive, leaving to our own determina
hall what the scope Â° the investigation '
The motion received a unanimous vote.
Mr. Woodhamsâ l would like to present at
this time the complete statement that I have
prepared. I think it is necessary to present
tne entire statement to cover the matter under
discussion.
Amotion to this effect was made and
carried and Mr. Woodhams then read the
following statement:
Gentlemen of the Council: As the duly
elected representative of the officers and mem
bers of the First Congregational Church of
San J Francisco I desire to make the following
general statement concerning the matters that
it is thought ought to come before you for con
sideration and determination.
- our investigations and conclusions wiP
bear upon certain alleged charges, accusations
or rumors affecting the good name, iutegrity
moral conduct and ministerial standing of tile
pastor of this church, the Rev. Charles 0
Brown, D.D., and the case assumes an import
ance far beyond the usual incidents requir
ing the convening of a council, not merely on
account of the prominence and long record of
usefulness of the pastor attacked as a minister
of the gospel and the celebrity of the church
affected, but especially on account of the varied
nature and character of and multitudinous
incidents connected with and surrounding the
alleged charges, accusations or rumors," and
the unusual fact that one of -the principals, a
professedly pious woman, now awaits trial be
fore our Superior Court upon the serious
charge of extortion and the levying of black
mail upon the pastor of this church.
8 The direct charges, so far as any charges can '
be said to exist, have reference to two cases or
incidents and are not made to this church or :
any of its officers, but to the general public i
and principally through the medium of the
public prints. They first emanated from one I
Mrs. M. A. Davidson, now in custody, as above !
stated, on the charge of extortion and black
mail, and who is said to have been. in custody
for a considerable length of time in the East
for a criminal offense.
To be able to put. before you the nature of
these so-called charges it is necessary, as you
will see, to quote largely from Mrs. Davidson's
purported words on these matters. -
â¢ii vi st case or incident to arise was the so
called Overman case, with reference to which
Mrs. Davidson is reported iv one of our daily
papers of December 31, 1895, to have written
as follows:
Mrs. Davidson's statement was not read,
however, the council being thoroughly
familiar with the subject-matter. The
speaker then continued :
. very important branch of the so-called
Oveiman incident deals with the alleged Over
man letters, which were published in our
morning papers early in January of this year.
These letters as. they appear thereâ bald of any
explanation, and ln connection with the story
told by Mrs. Davidsonâ must be conceded as
likely to startle the feelings and stimulate the
imagin ms of many people, although they
are endowed with every conscientious motive,
and it is not to be wondered that some have
been unable to reconcile the astonishing
though ambiguous statements contained in
these letters with the innocence of the Rev.
Dr. Brown. But a complete refutation of any
charge or Intimation whatsoever contained in
these letters Is promised, and it Is expected on
the part of Dr. Brown to convince the world
that, notwithstanding anything contained iv
them, he is an innocent man.
The second or so-called Stockton incident ap
pears in one of the dally papers of January
1, 1896, where Mrs. Davidson Is reported to
have the following statement with reference to
the same: .'.''
I had known Mattie Overman some time, when
one day in a burst of Indignation she told me of
another event in Dr. Brown's life which convinced
me more than ever that he was a base hypocrite.
It was nothing less than an attempted assault on a
Mrs. Stockton. He was caught iv the very act,
however, and forced, under fear of exposure, to
give up the sum of $600.
These matters immediately became public
property through the medium of the daily
papers, and in the course of their dissemina
tion throughout the community have gath
ered the usual burden of sensational Incidents,
and have been the occasion of countless other
and additional rumors of different and various
kinds, some of which will no doubt dissolve
into the thin air whence they came on the con
clusion and determination of the alleged main
charge and accusation concerning Dr. Brown.
And this main and determining issue Is whether
the pastor of this church, the Rev. Charles O.
Brown, D.D. , has knowingly departed from or
violated any divine law, or rule of duty ; in other
words has he been guilty of the sin imputed to
him by these various matters and alleged
charges and rumors?
On December 'M, 1895, Dr. Brown procured
the arrest of Mrs. Davidson on the charge for
which she is now in custody, and this in the
lace of the positive knowledge clearly and for
cibly brought to his attention that such a
course would bring down upon his head an over
whelming avalanche of counter charges And
accusations of the character that have actualiv
come into being and enjoyed a lively and
harassing existence since that fatelul day.
Immediately following the arrest Dr. Brown
made and secured the publication in the San
Francisco papers of December 29, 1895, of a
statement. < 'ty ':
Dr. Brown also denied that ho had ever paid
Mrs. Stockton the sum of $000 or any sum I
whatsoever for the purpose of hushing up the !
alleged scandal or any purported scandal ;
whatsoever concerning Mrs. Stockton, and i
supports his statement by a long affidavit of ]
George D. Gear to the effect that said Mrs. |
Stockton had sought to blackmail Dr. Brown,
but that such effort had been unsuccessful.
With reference to the payment of the $500 |
to Mrs. Davidson Dr. Brown claims that he j
paid the money for the double purpose of se
curing positive and conclusive evidence of
Mrs. Davidson's guilt, and at the same time to
secure the name of the woman for whom Mrs.
Davidson was purporting to act as agent, as is
indicated by the receipt.
There have been many rumors current in
this community and elsewhere of so-called
divisions and dissensions within the church,
said to be the result of this unfortunate affair.
Therefore 1 think it only just to say that.the
members of this church have in general
merely held to their constitutional rights.
Congregationalists we well know do not.
think it wrong for one to hold arid express his
honest opinions and convictions. With re
spect to these alleged divisions and dissen
sions the fact is that opinion and conviction
differed as to the course that ought rightly be
pursued in the matter and if in the anxiety of
the hour expressions passed Indicative of a
dissenting mood or bitter spirit we should not
fail to consider the ordinary character of hu
man nature and make the proper allowance
for the conduct of our brethren.
It was natural, and perhaps on that account
not to be mentioned, or deplored, that In the
.course of events the small spark flrst kindled
should have been strongly fanned by the
furious treatment which the case has received
from extraneous sources, until it reached a
blaze ol considerable proportions, and became
a serious menace to the welfare of the church
and its people not, likely to be despised if con
tinued for any considerable length of time in
the future, for the consciences and feelings of
Christian people are especially tender and
easily susceptible to such attacks as have been
made upon their faith, so that they are unable
to endure delay and necessarily demand a
speedy clearing away of every imputation of
wrongdoing on the part of one of their num
ber. -i j..-- *â  -
Tho larger proportion of the church were
seemingly willing to permit the case to take
what seemed to be a natural course, although
they were laboring under great distress ou ac
count of the virulence of the charges against
the pastor of the church. They recognized
that the matter was not. an ordinary one, since
the prime' offender was resting in jail on a
grave charge of criminal import: and they
were impressed with the argument that the
rights of the people of the entire State de
manded that no stone be left unturned where
by a conviction of this person might rightfully
be had, if it should be fully disclosed that she
was guJHyof the extortion charged against
ner. They were willing also that the pastor of
this church should have ample time and op
portunity in which to clear himself ot a grave
charge or matter of rumor, which affected not
alone his immediate reputation and relations
to the people of this church but attacked the
very foundation of his life of usefulness and
service as a minister of the gospel.
There are many others who held conscien
tious opinions, and were opposed to any delay,
and those opinions have the respect o'i every
fair-minded person. They felt that the church
and the cause of- Christianity was being vitally
Injured by the delay, and tfiat only an imme
diate determination ol the matters or rumors
in circulation in the | community would con
duce to the welfare of the ~< church directly
affected, and of every person concerned or in
terested in the cause of Christianity. -
However, there was one point which all
seemed to have had in mind, and that point
was reached when this council was called by
vote of the church, and you gentlemen com
pose that council called by pastor I and people
to investigate and decide upon matters current
in this community/of a very grave and serious
nature. ;'-
The letters missive declare that these matters
affect the moral character and ministerial
standing of Dr. Brown. That is to tay the
question Is raised :
Firstâ Has he been guilty of immoral con
duct, such as necessarily affects his standing
botn as a minister of the gospel and an honor
able man and member of this community?
Secondâ Has his ministerial standing, with
reference not only to the other churches of
this country, but with reference also to his
standing as a minister in this community and
to this church and people, been in any wise af
fected by these so-called charges and rumors?
In other words I deem It to be the duty of the
council under the letters missive to consider
and pass and advise upon every matter, thing
or point which if left unsettled can or would in
any degree reflect upon Dr. Brown and materi
ally bear upon his usefulness in this com
munity or elsewhere as a preacher of the woid
of God.
Dr. Brown is entitled to and should be pre
sumed innocent until proven guilty before
this council, and no point should be omitted
which is vital to his usefulness here, in the
event of this presumption being found to be
one of fact, lou must look to every possible
result in favor of or against Dr. Brown, and he
prepared to make every matter, and thing per
taining to these alleged charges, accusations
or rumors plain and as clear and translucent
as the light of a summer day.
There have been rumors prevalent to the
effect that Dr. Brown influenced the selection
of the churches and members composing; this
council. The facts are that Dr. Brown did not
influence In any way the action of the board
of deacons or any member thereof, and was not
even present at the session of the board at
which action was taken in this regard. The
Portland and Los Angeles churches were sug
gested by Dr. Blown, but events show that that
suggestion was not acted upon.
It is believed that the only other suggestion
made was with reference to the Sacramento
church, in which case the members of the com
mittee had already and in advance of Dr.
Brown's suggestion decided to invite that
church, and upon the recommendation of
other ministers of this City, together with
their own impressions ot the fitness of that
selection. These rumors are utterly without
foundation, and I believe that this church is
entirely satisfied with the selection made, and
that no more representative selection of
churches nnd delegates could have been made
for the purpose of forming this council.
In conclusion, 1 wish to make it clear that I
am not here to make any formal charges, nor
to particularly represent any so-called faction
or shade of opinion in this church. The church
elected me to represent it as a whole, and it is
my hope to be able to stand . fairly and im
partially for every kind and character ot opin
ion and belief existing in this church that
needs representation or spokesmen before this
council. My duty is to see, so far as it lies in
my power, that justice is done to pastor find
people in this trying hour. The church has
placed me in this position, gentlemen, to assist
you in your deliberations and in the examina
tion of "the various matters that maybe pre
sented for your consideration while in session.
And may all that we do or say have the ap
proval not alone of our own consciences, but
may the smile of divine favor rest upon and
illumine that course which we shall pursue.
On motion of Dr. Williams the state
ment was received and ordered filed with
the scribe of the council.
Rev. Mr. Hatch introduced the fol
lowing: '. â¢ '
Resolved, That, as respecting certain am
biguities in the letter-missive, the council
adopts the interpretation of those who issued
the letters-missive in considering the scope of
Its Investigating power. ' It seems there are
two lines presented here from the suggestions
of Mr. Woodhams. First, the question as to
the alleged immoral conduct and ministerial
standing, and, second, as to the pastoral rela
tions and such things as would tend to vitiate
those relations.
A discussion ensued, and the resolution
was amended as follows:
Resolved, That as respects the letter-missive
the council adopts the Interpretation of those
who issued the letters-missive, as shown by
the statement of Mr. Woodhams, and considers
that it shall investigate the moral character,
ministerial standing and pastoral conduct and
pastoral relation of Pastor Brown.
Before the amended resolution was
voted upon Dr. Brown arose and spoke as
follows:
May I ask what my rights are here? Havel
not the right to be heard at any time without
the consent of the council?
Dr. McLean The council will have to de
cide that. Presumably you have the right to
be heard. The council should define and not
the chair.
Dr. Brownâ l want the council to consider
that I stand before you, not only as the ac
cused person, but as my own counsel. That is
the claim I would set up. Touching the sec
ond resolution I am of the positive opinion
that the church has not delegated to you any
right to investigate what is covered by the
latter part of the resolution. :i.vy
The second, part of. that resolution would
I place in your hands a dragnet that would
I enable your body to go into the Herron and
â¢ Strauss affairs. 1 ask you to consider my posi
i tion. Ido not believe the church has placed
any such power in your hands.
Dr. McLeanâ The council would like to know
from whomever it can what it is expected to
do. We have asked such a definition from Mr.
Woodhams, and Mr. Hatch's resolution simply
provided that we accept that interpretation.
1 understand that Dr. Brown challenges the
j Interpretation of Mr. Woodhams.
Dr. Brownâ Mr. Hatch rightly interprets Mr.
Woodhams, and I distinctly challenge that in
terpretation.
Mr. Woodhamsâ l do not see how my inter
-1 pretation can be considered as a dragnet to
; draw into this investigation the Herron and
Strauss incidents. I nave stated what the
charges are that are expected to be beam.
There are other rumors that have grown out
of these two incidents and which were evi
dently in the minds of those who drafted the
letters-missive. If there are matters brought
in that do not pertain to these main charges
they should not be considered, but if they
do concern these main, charges or have any
connection with them they ought to be inves
tigated.
Mr. Hatchâ l would amend by making it read
to hear also any charges growing out of the
main charges which would tend to affect the
existing pastoral relation. That would prevent
the council going in to any thing old or that did
not pertain to these matters.
Dr. Mooarâ are three distinct points to
be considered. First, the moral character of
Dr. Brown as a man, then his ministerial stand
ing in general, and, third, his pastoral rela
tions to this particular body of Christians who
compose this church. There is a doubt about
the third point, to which I understand Dr.
Brown objects. >y '; y
Dr. Brownâ l am very sure that in the re
marks made by Mr. oodhams he does not
represent the First Congregational Church. I
have been present and participated in every
NEW TO-DAY.

motion brought up in reference to the calling
of this council, and no such thing asset
forth in these last remarks bat ever been
hinted at in any of our motions. Th-) moral
character and mi isterial standing of the
pastor were the only things mentioned. 1
think the church members can act en my re
lations with them. lam sure that the church
would rise in indignation if you were to inves
tigate my pastoral relations. .; â¢ . .
Dr. McLeanâ Is the crucial point on
which everything turns and needs to be de
cided now. " It may be well for the council to
deliberate with Dr. Brown, Mr. Woodhams and
the committee of live to ascertain just what
the church desires us to do. The church has
the right to interpret the matter. .
A motion to lay the whole matter on the
table was carried, and another motion to
consider only the question* of moral char
acter and ministerial standing shared the
same fate. .'-*''
Rev. Dr. Hoyt moved that the council
adjourn to the library to deliberate with
the committee of the churcb, Dr. Brown
and Mr. Woodhams to ascertain what was
in the minds of the committee and the
church when the letters-missive were
drafted. This was carried, and after an
executive session of one and a quarter
hours those engaged in the conference re
turned and the council adjourned until
7:. p. m.
When the evening session opened Rev.
Dr. Hoyt lead in prayer, asking the
guidance of Jesus Christ in the approach
ing work of the council. The minutes of
the afternoon session were read, corrected
and adopted, and then Moderator McLean
spoke as follows:
It is not the province of this council to con
sider what is the best kind of investigation to
hold. The charter of our existence is in the
letters-missive. We have simply been trying
to define the language of the letters-missive
and get at what was expressed by those who
drew them up. I hope this will be entirely
understood. Tho letter may be defective. I
do not say that it is. But that we have noth
ing to do" with. We can only do the thing
that our churches sent us here to do.
Rev. Mr. Tenny then read the report of
what was decided upon at the conference
before the afternoon adjournment. It was
as follows:
Whereas, At a conference with the council
with the committee of the church wnuh
drew the letters-missive, with Mr. Woodhams,
the authorized representative of the church,
and Dr. Brown, the pastor, it appears,
Firstâ That the question of asking the coun
cil to Investigate the pastoral relation of Dr.
Brown to the church was not discussed at the
meetings of the church which authorized the
calling of the council.
Secondâ That Dr. Brown himself signed the
letters-missive with tne understanding that
such investigation was not in the scope of the
council.
Thirdâ That the natural and ordinary inter
pretation of the language of the letters-mis
sive would include this as a part of its work,
therefore.
Resolved, That the council interpret the let
ters-missive as cfilline only for the investiga
tion of the charges current in this community
affecting his moral character and general
ministerial standing.
This report was adopted and Dr. Pond
moved the appointment of a committee to
receive and formulate any charges against
the moral character of Dr. Brown. In ex
planation of the motion he said:
"I mean to receive from any source
whatever such charges or information as
bears on this matter."
The motion was adopted and it was
decided to have the committee consist of
three members. Before the committee
could be appointed Dr. Brown made the
following remarks:
I should like to ask this question. Whether
the motion now passed is in its nature manda
toryâwhether this committee must receive
charges of any kind fromhny person, no matter
what his character?
Dr. McLean limitations will be made
later.
The moderator then asked for nomina
tions for the committee. Dr. Pond and
Dr. Moore were named, but both declined
to serve. Dr. Hoyt, Dr. Rader and E. C.
Williams of Oakland were finally selected.
Dr. McLean then asked:
Is It the will of the council to limit or define
the duties of the committee with respect to the
charges and the character of the testimony it
is proposed to consider and substantiate?
Dr. Freelandâ That is the duty of the com
mittee. .â â ' y-
Dr. Tennyâ l object to that Interpretation.
Dr. Pondâ They are to receive the charges

Mr. Parkinsonâ The committee should reject

made use of by Dr. Pond. If a report is brought

being capable of substantiation.

the charges it is all right. But If we are sup
posed to hold out certain evidence and be
responsible lor doing so I certainly would not
be a party to such a proceeding. I would like
that our* committee be instructed to present
only such charges as they think have some
good testimony to support them.
Dr. Kadei Some of the committee object to
the clause which makes it necessary to do sift
ing. it would place us in a better position
with the public tot us to hand in all the evi
dence and let the council judge of it.
Dr. Brownâ ln Its present form the resolu
tion would permit any person to hide his or
her personality. I think it would be unfair to
allow any person to smite me without my
knowing "who is performing the act. I ask that
the persons making charges should come be
fore the council to substantiate them.
After it was shown by argument that
the resolution implied such conditions as
mentioned by Dr. Brown it was adopted.
Mr. Williamsâ l would move that all charges
be preferred In writing: and signed by the per
son making them.
This motion was carried, and then it
was decided that the council hold daily
sessions from 2 v. m. to 5:30 r. m. and from
7:30 to 0:30 v. M.
Chairman Hoyt of the committee on
charges announced that the committee
would meet tins morning in the office of
Dr. Brown in the church between 9 a.m.
ana 11 a. m. to receive any charges that
may be ready for presentation.
At this point Dr. Brown called the atten
tion of the council to the fact that it had
not yet defined his status before that bod v.
. On the motion of Mr. Parkinson it was
decided that Dr. Brown have the same
right? before the council as those accorded
to any defendant who appears before a
civil court as his own counsel, in so far as
the council can take cognizance of his
standing. - .
Dr. Mooarâ They who make the charges
should have the same rights, so that there
will be no inference that we are unfair.
Dr. Pondâ l don't think we ought to restrict
ourse^es in any way. We ought to have
sanctified sense enough to know how to act in
any emergency that comes up.
Dr. Seudderâ Does this give Dr. Brown the
right to cross-examine witnesses and witnesses
the right to cross-examine Dr. Brown ?
Dr. McLeanâ lf Dr. Brown makes a statement
it would be subject to cross-examination the
same as that of a witness. Dr. Brown will cer
tainly be willing to be cross-examined and the
witnesses should also be willing to be cross
exam i
Dr. Brownâ The council ha* spent the day
thus far in laying down rules along which the
sanctified common sense of the council shall
run. You have thus tar been occupied in
placing restrictions on the council. i fail to
see the wisdom in stopping thus at a time
when it may result in my favor. 1 should be
t he first to claim that those who appear against
me should have the same right as l have.
I never heard of any trial where the defend
ant had not the right to cross-examine the
witnesses. No one but 1 can properly cross
examine the witnesses, as no one knows them
as l do and the nature and peculiarities of the
charges that are likely to be made.
The motion under discussion was carried.
Dr. Moo.trâ l move now that equivalent rights
be given to every person who through this
committee brings charges against Dr. Brown.
This motion was also carried.
Dr. McLeanâ suppose before any charges
are brought before the -council they "should be
placed before Dr. Brown, that he "may under
stand before hearing them before the council
what the charges are. That is common before
all courts, civil and ecclesiastical.
Mr. Parkinsonâ Any person who brings writ
ten charges against Dr. Brown should be re
quired to present two copiesâ for the com
mittee and one for the defendant.
This motion was carried without dissent.
Dr. Brownâ l may be able to give you a little
help. I am tally prepared to meet all the
charges which have thus far been published In
the newspapers. I would like to fay a. word
with regard to a statement thai has been made,
probably without authority, in one of the
newspapers, for these statements made with
out authority are sometimes correct. It has
been said that the course of procedure in the
civil courts will be reversed, and that the de
fense vil] practically be put on the stand first
and the prosecution be allowed to close with a
grand finale. I think that the plan of intro
ducing evidence should be laid down here this
evening.
It was finally decided that the course of
procedure should be the same as that in
vogue in councils of this kind, and that
Messrs. Woodhams and Parkinson be
asked to meet with the committee this
morning to mark out and define the order
In which the case shall be conducted, and
that the decision of this committee shall
be reported to the council at the opening
of the session to-day.
A reading of the minutes was called for
previous to adjournment and exception
was taken to them. Dr. Mooar wanted a
correction of the rule adopted by which
the inquiry was to be limited to immoral
conduct. He thought it should cover
"conduct inconsistent with good ministe
rial standing." A motion to so extend the
scope was adopted unanimously.
Dr. Scudder moved that the. couiicil-at
large should decide what evidence was and
was not admissible. In other words, that
the committee of three should report to
tbe council all the charges or evidence
brought before it. This also was adopted.
Dr. Brown called attention to the pro
vision under which charges were to be
made and entertained by the council. He
said that Dr. Mooar's motion specified that
t he charges must be made by "responsible"
parties. That word was not in the motion
as reported in the minutes, and he thought
it very important that it be insertedâ the
word "responsible."
The moderator called upon Dr. Mooar
and he said:
Yes, I did use the word responsible. I mean
that they should appearâ that their charges
and testimony should be signed so as to make
them responsible.
This correction was made, and then Dr.
Brown asked the privilege of the floorâ
for "just a moment," he said, "before ad
journment" â and it was granted. He
eaid :
I believe I stand now in a position that hag
no precedent in the history of the trials of
discipline of the Congregational church. In
all ordinary trials in this church the defend
ant is charged with something definite, ami la
accorded the right to hear the charge and
meet It. I come before you hereâ coun
cil of mv brothers in the church, having
no feeling against meâ and I find that
the doors are thrown open to receive and hear
every slanderer and every individual who may
have a mind to wreak some personal spite.
Now do not understand mo as making any
objection to the course you have chosen. I
welcome it. But it seems to me that it would
have been a fairer way to have formulated
specific charges. Dr. Mooar's definition of
"responsible,!' as applied to the people I am to
be called upon to answer, is certainly a very
liberal one to say the least. Thus a mere.sign
ingol a statement makes the party "responsi
ble." I un, as I lay, not objecting to it, but I
would like to have it noted here that the doors
ere wide open and that I am to be called upon
to meet the widest possible Investigation.
There Is a woman, instance, who is now
in jail awaiting trial upon a criminal charge,
who is unable to account for long periods of
her life, Whose record where It is known in
other parts of the country is distinctly under
suspicion, who refuses to say whether or not
she has given birth to certain childrenâ such
a woman may come, under this ruling, sign
her charges and be accredited.
I wish to repeat tbat i am not objecting to it.
1 welcome th* fullest and freest hearing that
can be had. lam prepared to face any and all
mv accusers.
When Dr. Brown sat down there, was
pronounced demonstration of applause,
Said the moderator when complete quiet
had been restored: .V9E99
What Dr. Brown has said is true, but on the
other hand perhaps this case is unique. No
other â ,-.â¢ has ever come into the Congrega
tional church that is like it. It Is so in many
particulars. A city that is newspapered as
this Is, where every detail of the affair that has
led up to this has been taken up ana carried to
the four wind* of heaven, has widened the
Bt ope of the work of this council beyond what,
perhaps, it otherwise would. It has introduced
elements that it is nauseous to treat. This
council has come together at the instance of
the church affected.
The petition was signed by the pastor him
self. \\ c have come together as he has said, with
kindly feeling to do that which we. believe to
i- right. It is best for the church and for all
concerned that the questions already raised
should be met.
The attention of . the moderator was
called to the demonstration that had fol- j
lowed Dr. Brown's little speech, "The
decorum of this council has already been
broken." one member said. "If it is an :
indication of what is to follow we had j
much better decide at once to have our |
sessions in private." I
"That is true," said the moderator. "\\ c
have undertaken the performance of a â¢
duty, and the people who come here day ,
by day to listen to the proceedings must
understand that they must take no part in
them nor give expression to their sym
pathies one way or another. We must and
you must maintain the old English spirit |
of fair play. We must observe that j
decorum becoming to the proceedings of j
this solemn council and as believers in the i
triune God." ,", Â
Rev. Mr. Williams said it was "hardly
fair to our brother. Dr. Brown, to hear i
charges that might be made of more recent ,
date than last Sundayâ that is, that had j
not been referred to in the newspapers of
date prior to tiiat." He fixed the date
simply as a matter of form.
This was objected to. It was thought
that the simpler and more direct way I
would be to require any persons making
charges to furnish two copies, one for the
council and one for Dr. Brown, and then
give him twenty-four hours, or any other
proper time, to answer them. The Wil
liams motion was lost.
The council then adjourned, a notice be
ing first made that the committee of three
to hear charges would meet at once in Dr. j
Brown's study, where they would receive !
any who mix wish to meet with them. ;
This committee retired and remained in \
waiting for some minutes. No one ap- j
peared, and they also adjourned.
In the lecture-room a large part of the
audience or congregation remained for
some time discussing the events of the
evening. Dr. Brown's hand was shaken
many times by men and women.
Miss Overman was also greeted more or
less cordially by many as they passed.
She looked up courageously at councilmen
and members of the congregation alike.
Mrs. Cooper, who sat in the front row
during the evening session, remained
until nearly the last, together with a
coterie of her friends.
In the midst of a scene, not exactly of
congratulation, but of encouragement, Dr.
Brown was told that "Mrs* French, over
there by the window," wanted to see' him."
Mrs. French was a part of Mrs. Cooper's
coterie. Dr. Brown went over, and Mrs.
French demanded to know of nim why he
had foisted Mrs. Stockton upon that pro
gramme with Mrs. French. Dr. Brown at
tempted to reply, and Mrs. French
answered him, and the debate was attract
ing a crowd, when Dr. Brown stopped and
said he would not discuss the matter.
"Come over here and I will talk to you,"
he said.
They went away from the crowd and
discussed the matter for some time. Dr.
Brown's argument in his own behalf was
that he "thought Mrs. Stockton had re
formed at the time he attempted to put
Mrs. Stockton on the same bill with Mrs.
French."
Mrs. Cooper was asked last evening if
she intended to prefer charges against
Brown. "I have a statement to make
which is already prepared," she said. "I
have indicated that to the council, and it
will be heard. I have no formal charges
to make."
SAM RAINEY IS REACHING.
Putting Politicians in the Mint
and Working to Control
the Junta.
Ed Lanigan Stays by Himself and Is
Suspected of Friendship With
Rainey.
The Junta's battle with the Rainey-
Daggett part of itself is causing late
nightly conferences in the back room at
the headquarters in the Flood building.
Chairman Sullivan, Max Popper, Samuel â 
Braunhart and Gavin McNab are a quartet ]
into whose presence the political lieu
tenants go.
The leaders mentioned think that they I
have the organization safe from Rainey's i
control. Rainey, however, is reaching out
deftly for more power. Within two or
three weeks he has secured places in the j
Mint for three Democrats of political '
value to himself, and in several districts i
the Rainey-Daggett element is preparing |
to make an effort to increase its strength
in the new general committee to be chosen j
at the primary next week. So the anti-
Rainey powers now in control of the ma- |
chine must prevent Rainey from electing j
too many delegates from the various dis
tricts, and arbitrary dictation as to how
many delegates this element may have is
resorted to on the ground of expediency !
and self-preservation.
The war in the Forty-fourth is still hilt â¢
to hilt and savage. Chairman Sullivan i
slicks to his decision that George Max
well, who is running things here fori
Rainey, may elect but twelve of the twenty
five delegates. Maxwell declares that he i
will run a ticket of twenty-five names, and |
if they are elected, as they would be with- '
out fail, he will demand the seating of i
them all according to Democratic princi- j
pies. This promises to be the outcome in j
the Forty-fourth.
If it turns out that way there will be
contesting delegations from the Forty
fourth before the general committee at its
first meeting soon after the primary, and
that issue will serve as an exact measure
of the Rainey-Daegett strength in the or
ganization. It would be an occasion like
that in the old committee last October j
when Buckley was the issue and A. A. !
Watkins was elected chairman, giving the j
organization temporarily to the anti- j
Buckleyites.
Ed Lanigan figures in this situation, but i
nobody knows just how. Nobody seems j
sure of where this ambitious bosslet is or |
where he will be pretty soon. Lanigan is \
a sort of an independent factor yet. He j
controls twenty-three of the delegates from j
his own district and .has a considerable
scattering strength, giving him between !
forty ana fifty votes in the present general j
committee. . Now, if Lanigan should com- j
bine with Rainey and Daggett that trio
would come pretty near controlling the or- .
ganization. Rainey and Daggett have I
about 125 votes at present and Lanigan's !
strength would make a hard combination |
to beat. The anti-I'aineyite* figure Lani- ;
Ran with Rainey in speculations on the j
situation to bo on the safe side. Lanigan
rarely ccmes to Junta headquarters. He |
attends to his own politics elsewhere and j
waits to see what to do when the time
The Rainey people have a majority in
Popper's districtâ the .Thirty-eighthâ
they are fiercely charging on Braunhart
in the Twenty-ninth. Braunhart once
controlled that district when the party
was united. Then Charles McCourtney
and two or three others became strong
rival district leaders. When the recent
split over Buckley occurred Braunhart
was supposed to control the anti-Buckley
faction without question. He named
twenty-five nominees for the general
committee the other night, but the Rainey
and Daggett elements, led by Nat Seelig
of the Mint, are out for a battle with
Braunhart, and a bitter district war has
developed.. Seelig has nominated six ad
ditional names, and there is much talk
that the Raineyites are getting a lot of
Braunhart's nominees away from him and
expect to beat him out in the end and run
tho Junta faction in that district them
selves.
The light against Rainey is becoming as
interesting as the fight against Buckley
was before the divorce.

Willett McDonald, 25 years ot age, and Cor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1896.
COL. TRUMBO ON UTAH.
He Believes the New State Is
Destined to Be a Great
One.
HAS MILLIONS IN HER MINES.'
The Smoke of the Campaign Has
Cleared Away and the People â¢
Are Ready to Labor.
Colonel Isaac Trumbo of Salt Lake City
is again in San Francisco and it cannot be
said that he gives any evidence of disap
pointment because the people of Utah re
fused to reward him for the years of labor
he has spent in their interest by sending
him to the United States Senate. A Call
reporter ran across the Colonel >at the
Palace and learned that matters had al
ready pretty well settled down in the new
'State. , ': * \. , . râ¢ - â  ' -
"We are going to make the greatest
showing heard of in the West," said he in
response to an inquiry as to what the out
look in Utah was.
'.'lt has been known all along that in
mineral resources Utah was endowed as

no other State of the same area. Her pop
ulation, however, has never been a specu
lative one. On the contrary the teaching
and practice have ever been toward hus
bandry ana the possession of the soil as
the guarantee of permanent prosperity
and ot good citizenship. But the founders
knew that minerals abounded in Utah.
Yet it may be well doubted if even the
best posted dreamed of the wealth of re
source und the boundlessness of variety
that were to be found within the confines
of what is now the State of Utah.
"I remember hearing an earnest young
Mormon, while discussing the possibilities
of industrial development that awaited
the then Territory, make a statement that
I have never forgotten, because it showed
such unlimited confidence. At the time
in question the sentiment of the East was
that the coinage of silver was the cause of
our financial troubles, though the repeal
of Sherman's purchasing clause of the
silver bill was not then generally thought
of. Said he: Tt makes no difference what
the world wants, Utah will be found ready
to supply it. If it be lead, copper, silver.
sulohur, salt, or any other mineral, we
have it here, and have it in boundless
quantities, and easy of access. In time
the world may demand that gold alone
shall be the money. When that day
comes, though but little is now known to
exist here, that metal will be found in
places so near and quantities so great that
all the world will marvel, while Utah will
be the richest and the fairest State in all
the Union, despised as she is to-day.'
"Since the discovery of gold in tne new
fields at Mercur, I have often thought of
what has since seemed like the prophecy
of that young man.
"The possibilities of development in the
Mercur gold belt seems absolutely bound
less. The camp is not over twenty miles,
if that far, from Salt Lake as the crow Hies.
Already it has six or seven properties pro
ducing from $10,000 to $10,000 in gold per
month, and by another twelve months
there is no reason why 'there should not
be thirty mines producing all the wav
from $25,000 to $100,000 per month in gold
each.
"The formation is a disputed one, but it
seems to be limitless in extent. So far the
ore has been discovered wherever
depth has bcjn attained, while the vein or
deposit is simply marvelous in extent
and thickness. lam told that in the Sun
shine mine they have ten acres of solid
ore. Their drifts, tunnels, shafts and all
their workings are in ore. Tho vein has
been traced to cover an area said to be
forty miles in extent and five to ten miles
in width, and some declare that it is as
wide as it is long. The same formation
covers a vast area, and the values charac
teristic of the particular spot where the ore
is being taken from at present in 'paying
quantities are found at widely apart, points
and in various places in this area. Another
significant fact, and one that adds to the
present value of the camp, is that the ore
runs higher in gold as greater depth is at
tained. .-..,.
"The Golden Gate, a group of claims
owned by the mining king, Captain Dela
mar, is about to erect a mill that will han
dle 500 tons of ore a day, and it has been
asserted that some of this ore runs about
$500 in gold to the ton. All the other
properties in the camp are adding to their
mill capacity, while many new mills are
contracted for on properties that have as
yet not been producing, but which are
now ready to yield up the precious metal.
"The effect ;of these recent discoveries
has been to greatly increase the j spirit of
confidence begotten of. the initiation of
Utah into statehood. It has also excited
greater interest on the part of capital in
the East, which has, been chary about
taking even â¢ tempting investments in
Utah, owing to the distrust attaching to a
Territory and especially to Utah, caused
by the peculiar conditions so long existing
there. , Then the fact that the -sentiment
of the people of Utah has been shown to
be in harmony with the Republican doc
trine of assisting, through State help, in
the upbuilding of necessary industries,
has also given capital greater assurance
than hitherto had in -that locality. Of
course, to those familiar with the history
of the Territory and tne teachings of its
great men thatlocal industries should be
fostered, it was only a question of time as
to when Utah would be a rock-ribbed Re
publican State. That it has come so soon
is a mark of intelligence on the part of her
people ana a gratification to those who
have stood sponsor for her assured Repub
licanism in a future, which happily is now.
the present.
"All these facts convince conservative
minds that the immediate industrial fu
ture of Utah is brighter than that of any
Other Western State. Her resources, great
and varied as they are, are destined to an
early and vigorous development, and these
will be followed by the introduction of
many manufactories of which she is quali
fied by the existence of resources ard by
the presence of a population that will war
rant the undertakings.
"I am satisfied also that the new State
will note a rapid and a great growth in
population, which will extend to the agri
cultural classes as well as to mining and
to skilled labor in the many manufactur
ing industries that are destined to be in
augurated in the near future. It must not
be thought that Utah is exhausted agri
culturally. She has several great canals
that are in course for construction and
which will increase the agricultural area
materially, while the field for the intro
duction of capital into -other, irrigation
systems than those already begun or in
contemplation has hardly been ap
proached, much less exhausted. '
"Utah is filled with valleys and the cities
nestle along the base of the mountain
ranges that hem in these beautiful valleys.
Out of the gorges and canyon defiles that
lead into the valley from the mountain
fastnesses are innumerable streams. All
these are being harnessed and utilized for
the generation of electrical currents that
will furnish power and so minimize the
cost of manufacture and the supplying of
motive power. Besides, Utah has limitless
coal fields, so that the power must be
cheap when electricity can supplant coal
in a region that has coal at its very door.
"On the widely extending knowledge of
these facts, and numberless others that are
in line with them, the people of our new
State are looking forward to a. steady
though rapid growth, which will result in
an era of development and prosperity the
like of which we believe has never been
known. in the West.
"Railroads?" queried the colonel, in
answer to the question as to Utah's alti
tude on the absorbing California question
of the Pacific railroads. "You can put
Utah down as being with California in the
fight you are making. Utah is with you
in this and all similar fights first, last and
always."
CUSTOM-HOUSE SCANDAL
Moore Still Hunting Up Evidence
Against Interpreter
Williams.
W. W. Foote and Assistant District
Attorney Schlessinger Have a
War of Words.
There were few developments in the
! Custom-house scandal yesterday. Special
l Agent Moore and staff are still hard at
work hunting up evidence against the ac
cused interpreter, Richard Williams.
Moore and Collector Wise had a long
conference yesterday afternoon. It was
all over the Williams affair. Several wit
-1 nesses gave testimony relative to Wil-
I liams' connection with the landing' of
Chinese girls at this port. There was
nothing more damaging against the in
terpreter than the stories that have already
been made public. Anyway, there is a
general belief in Federal circles that Wil
liams' official career, so far as the Custom
house is concerned, is at an end. Now that
he has been temporarily retired, pending
the consideration of the evidence in the
case by secretary Carlisle, there is little
hope that he will ever be restored to the
full confidence of the Government authori
ties. The case is now virtually in the
hands of Special Agent Moore.
The case of Martin Moore came up be
fore United States Commissioner, Hea
cock as was expected yesterday morning,
and went over for one week. The contin
uance was at the request of the special
I agent, who is anxious to have the case
I brought before the Grand Jury for investi
j gation. He may also make the same effort
] in connection with the Williams matter.
W. W. Foote and Assistant District At
torney Schlessinger had a spirited discus
sion in the office of the latter over the
f Cleary case yesterday morning. The emi
| nent attorney accused the Government
prosecutor - with attempting to smother
I the case so that the defense would be un
able to present its witnesses.
This insinuation the voting attorney in
dignantly repudiated, and for a little time
there was a hot exchange of words. Mr.
; Schlessinger's friends about the Federal
j building entertain only the highest opin
ion of him as a fair and impartial admin
| istrator of justice, and consequently the
j reflection cast upon him was widely dis
cussed among them.
Attorney Foote is hot after Moore's
j scalp and is working jointly with the cus-
I toms authorities to have it removed.

Mrs. Jackson, wife of J. Ross Jackson, the
journalist, and Mrs. Rafael,, her daughter,

ALONG THE WATER FRONT.
Troublous Voyage of the British
Steamer Monowai From
Sydney.
FOUR MEN PLACED IN IRONS.
Two ;. Barkentines Which Are Sup
posed to Have Gone Down in
Recent Gales.
There was trouble on the British steamer
Monowai during her trip from Sydney
(N. S. W.) to San Francisco, via AucKland
(N. Z.), Apia (Samoa) and Honolulu (H.
I.) While the vessel was in Australia the
men on the steamers of the Union Steam
ship Company were on a strike, and as the
Monowai is owned by that line, but char
tered to the Oceanic Steamship Company,
her crew also went out. The vessel was
moved out into the stream and her cargo
put aboard there, while a crew was picked
up along the quays.
The men thus shipped were not so good
as they were represented to be. During
the voyage the firemen could not hold the
steam on the boilers, and in consequence
the Monowai only averaged from 200 to
270 knots a day, when she should have
made 320 knots. Her being so much be
hind time is thus explained. Two of the
forecastle hands refused to handle coal
when ordered to dc so by Captain Carey,
but after bring twenty-four hours in irons
and fed on bread and water they gave in
and went to work. A stowaway also re
fused to work and he also was put in irons.
One of the firemen got insolent and
struck the fourth assistant engineer when
that gentleman reprimanded him, and he
also was subjected to a diet of bread and
water. Six Americans, who had failed at
the- goldfields of Coolgardie, worked their
way back on the steamer and they proved
themselves to be the best men in the crew.
The steamer Zealandia, under charter to
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
sailed for Panama and way ports yester
day. She had in tow a very heavily loaded
lighter, which seemed to carry ail the bay
before it. The steamer went out under a
slow bell, and water-front men said there
would be trouble if ever heavy weather
was encountered. The Zealandia took out
a full cargo, but very few passengers.
The City of Peking got in from Hong
kong via Yokohama early yesterday morn
ing with the following cabin passengers:
Admiral Makaroff, P. B. McLeod, H. F. La
verge, K. Tshi, Captain Axededo, Contrubo K.
Sharp, Z. Ono, Lieutenant Mouaes Alelda, J. F.
Bullman and T. Aokl.
There were also fifty Chinese in the
steerage and fifteen Japanese. Among
the Chinese there is only one woman and
she is supposed to be consigned to Lee
Gee, the head of the new Chinatown ring.
The City of Peking was 24 days and 5
hours from Hongkong. On the first day
out from Yokohama she.ran into a storm.
Her decks were swept and four of the
deadlights were smashed in. Admiral
Makaroff, the junior admiral of the Rus
sian Asiatic fleet, rendered valuable assist
ance during the gale. He is on his way to
Petersburg on waiting orders.
Captain Wallace of the steamer Walla
Walla is back from his trip East. He was
welcomed home by all his water-front
friends yesterday. He was the delegate
from San Francisco harbor to tbe annual
convention of the American Association
of Masters and Pilots. Captain Wallace
will resume command of the Walla Walla
on her next trip. y".y'yy "-â¢ SvS.V

to Alaska. The Pacific . Coast Steamship
Company is preparing to carry the war into
Africa, and in a few days a new rate
schedule will go into effect as follows:
From San Francisco . to Sitka, first class,
$23, second class, $13 50; to Juneau, $20
and $11; to Wrangel, $18 and $10. As the
Lakme is cutting freight rates to Puget
Sound points, the same company has re
duced its prices from $3 a ton to $1, and in
future that will be the ruling rate. There
is now more freight offering for the Uma
tilla than she can carry.
For the Alaska trade the Al-Ki has been
thoroughly overhauled. The steerage has
been entirely remodeled, and there is now
splendid sleeping quarters, a dining-room
and a separate sitting-room. The cabin
has been built up, and there is now room
for seventy additional first-class passen
gers. A smoking-room has also been built,
and also a social hall. : The engines have
been repaired, and when the new Al-ki
meets the Willapa, which is running in
opposition, there will be a tug-of-war.
The battleship Oregon will not be ready
to dock for three months. Her turrets are
not in place, and until they arrive and are
arranged she will not be got ready for her
trial trip."
Captain Buchanan of the schooner Alex
ander, which arrived here on January 20
last, is of the opinion that the barkentine
Xantippe is lost. The latter was on her
way to Victoria, B. C, and Captain Bu
chanan says that when the Alexander
passed her the Xantippe had main, mizzen
and jigger topmasts and her foreroyal
yard down. Captain Buchanan's opinion
is that the Xantippe, having had a passage
from England to San Jose of ISOaays. and a
long delay there discharging, her bottom is
foul. This, combined with an insufficiency
of ballast, may account for her long pass
age. Ballast in San Jose costs $9 per ton
in currency at thai port, put alongside of
the ship.
The barkentine Discovery, now out
twenty-eight days from Port Gamble, is
also on the doubtful list. She may have
been caught in the recent storms and
driven out of her course, but her owners
think she will turn up all right. She was
lumber laden, and therefore not likely to
go down.
A BIG LABOR MOVEMENT.
Some of the Objects and Purposes
of the Late Union Con
. vention.
The Socialists Will Gladly Join the
New Workingmen's
Party.
The preliminary work of the recent la
bor union convention is still a theme of
conversation among the laboring classes.
The proposition for the laboring men to
enter politics as an organized body is such
a radical: departure from all previous
movements that it has caused much serious
thought and discussion. Those who have
always affiliated with the old parties look
with some question upon the policy of
making such a move, and this conserva
tism may be manifest at the next meeting
of the convention.
There are a few of the conservative ele
ment who, it is expected, will attempt to
call a halt in the course being pursued.
One of these last evening stated that while
he was in favor of everything in the order
of reform and progress, he feared, that
there would be those who would oppose
any further attempt to take labor unions
into politics. He said that it would be
difficult to take many men of many politi
cal parties and join them in one party, and
added: .
In the labor unions are Republicans, Demo-
crats, Populists and other parties, and each
man will endeavor to have his party selected
to represent the laboring classes. Now, there
was a disposition manifested at those two
meetings by the radicals to discard all of these
old parties and throw the force of the laboring
people into the Socialist Labor party. The
laboring men are not ready for so radical a
change, and I don't think they will stand it.
If the leaders go into politics for men and
measures without regard for party they will
stand a better show for success, but we are not
ready for the Socialist Labor party yet. To
be successful they should keep the unions and
politics apart. Let an auxiliary political party
beiiormed such as there Is in the East and have
every union send delegates to it. In that way
the labor unions can do politics and not in
terfere with their union work.
C. F. Schadt, R. T. Mclvor and others
prominent in the convention in discussing
the foregoing remarks said that the argu
ments were like setting up straw men tor
the pleasure of knocking them down. Mr.
Schadt said:
I am sorry that any one should have failed
to comprehend the situation as presented the
other day. In the first place, there Is no at
tempt to force the labor unions into the Social
ist Labor party ranks. It is against the prin
ciples of socialism, which is a growthâ an ad
vancementâand not an agitation.
Now, what is proposed is this, and Ido not
hesitate to make the purpose known: In this
movement are laborers who are determined to
take action in politics in order to regain their
rights, which they cannot secure by setting
around idly or being led by the nose by politi
cal bosses.
Now to the point. Let these laboring men
come out boldly and say who they will and
who they will not vote forâ in other* words
form a partyâ and the Socialist Labor party
will stand by the laboring man's party. if they
will put trustworthy men to the head of the
proposed party the socialists of this City, and
there are between 9000 and 10,000 here, will
stand by the new party individually and as an
organization. By so doing the socialists will
be living up to their principles and consider
that they are advancing the cause.
In substantiation Mr. Schadt cited an
instance that happened before an election
several years ago. A trades-union con
vention was called, but when it wa3 dem
onstrated that it was in the hands of a
few too conservative labor leaders, the
progressive element, composed largely of
men of socialistic principles, left in a body
and that same night joined the People's
party. It is proposed to so carefully con
duct the present movement that there will
be no bolting.
Among the progressive element that
promises to rally around the banner of a
new labor party is the Lathers' Protective
Union that was organized . last evening.
For many months past the old Lather's
Union has not been prospering, and the
membership gradually dwindled down to
about fifteen who were in good standing.
The progressive spirit manifested by the
recently organized Building Trades' Coun
cil aroused the fire of the lathers, and a
call was issued for a reorganization.
Last night fifty out of the seventy lath
ers in this City responded to the call, ana
the new union was formed. Every one
joined the union, and it is believed all but
half a dozen will soon be enrolled. A rad
ical departure in the formation of the new
union v/as that the bosses are eligible to
membership, and of the fifty there were
fifteen bosses.
P. H. Kerrigan was selected as president
and N. B. Russell as secretary, 'the other
officers will be selected later. The follow
ing committee was selected to form a
constitution and by-laws: T. Devillers,
John Zeigler, Peter Rivers, Henry Potter,
William Dowling, M. Nichols, William
Patee, John Dorrigan, Edward Moulton,
William Starr.
COURSING AT NEWARK.
The Drawing for the Meeting Will Take
Place To-Xight.
Next Sunday's coursing at Newark
promises to afford rare sport. As The
Call has always paid special attention to
coursing tne committee in charge of the
new park has asked for a mention of the
novel features to be introduced. The com
mitteemen in their communication say:
For many reasons coursing has never been as
popular in this State as it should be, but we
hope to change this state of affairs. No ex
pense has been spared to make our inaugural
meeting a grand success in every way and we
hope you will attend.
A new grand stand has been built especially
for the ladies, who are to be our guests, as we
realize that without their assistance it would
be difficult to score a success. Therefore, you
.need not hesitate to bring your lady friends, as
the utmost respect will De shown them iv
every way, and you may be sure they will en
joy the trip. The boat leaves foot of Market
street at 8:15 a. m., and returning arrives at
ti p. M. Fare, round trip, $1. Lunch served at
the grounds.
Many exciting trials will take place, as there
is a keen spirit of rivalry among the owners of
the noted dogs. Several famous greyhounds,
notably "Diana," have been sent from St.
Louis and other Eastern cities, in charge of
trainers, to compete at this meeting.
The club offers, in addition to substantial
money prizes, a beautiful silver loving-cup, to
be known as the "John Grace Challenge Cours
ing Cup," iv honor of our upright judge who
is as well and favorably known to Eastern
coursing men as he is to his fellow-members.
The drawing for this meeting will
take place Ibis evening at Shiels building.

AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS
Paderewski's Secretary Sued on
an Ancient Bill for
Dry Goods.
DENIES ALL RESPONSIBILITY.
Dresses for His Wife Were Ordered
by Her Manager, Who Agreed
to Pay.
Some wonderful feats of memory were
accomplished in Justice of the Peace Ker
rigan's court yesterday during the trial of
the suit of J. S. Reid, assignee of Verdier
& Co., the dry-goods merchants, against
Hugo Goerlitz, the secretary of Paderewski,
the great pianist.
Witnesses recalled word for word inter
views of a business nature that tooK place
seventeen years ago, and even remem
bered the hour when the conversations
took place to within fifteen minutes.
Samuel M. Shortridge appeared for the
defendant, and under his examination and
cross-examination the following story was
brought out.
. In 1879 Mr. Goerlitz and his wife were
traveling through San Francisco to Europe
from Australia, when Mrs. Goerlitz, who
was a singer of rare merit, was asked by
Frederick Lister, a theatrical manager, to
sing the leading role in "Pinafore." He
agreed to furnish all the necessary cos
tumes and accessories in consideration
that for a stated period he was to receive
all the receipts of the venture.
At the conclusion of the period men
tioned Mrs. Goerlitz was to be paid a per
centage of the profits.
Mr. Goerlitz had no interest whatever in
the production, merely acting on the part
of his wife and Mr. Lister in arranging for
the opera.
"Pinafore" under the Lister management
was not a great success and Mrs. Goerlitz's
prospective share of the proceeds did not
materialize. Then, in spite of the fact
that the head dressmaker of the dry-goods
house had an understanding with Mrs.
Goerlitz that Mr. Lister was to be respon
sible for the payment for the costumes
that were ordered, collectors were sent to
hunt up the prima donna's husband to
demand payment of the account.
In order to satisfy them and prevent
their hounding him Mr. Goerlitz, though
asserting that he did not owe the bill,
wrote to the firm promising to do all he
could to have the bill paid. Mr. Lister
failed, and it seems never paid the account.
The testimony of the witnesses for the
plaintiff, a collector to whom the account
was assigned, bore out the contention of
Mr. Goerlitz in many respects, but they
denied that an understanding had ever
existed that Mr. Lister had agreed to be
responsible for the bill.
Mr. Goerlitz frankly admitted that his
recollection of events that happened sev
enteen years ago was not of the best, and
he failed to recognize a once prominent
singer who was brought in by the plaintiff
to testify to certain matters tending to
show that the defendant had been identi
fied with the management of the theatrical
enterprise.
The* other witnesses for the plaintiff,
however, showed an extraordinary fresh
ness of memory regarding the hours when
they conversed with Mr. Goerlitz, and also
in relation to the language used at the in
terviews, in spite of the fact that seventeen
y tars have intervened since the transac
tions took place.
As an important witness, the head dress
maker, who, Mr. Goerlitz says, conducted
the negotiations regarding the costumes,
was not on hand, a postponement was
requested by the counsel for defendant
until she can be brought into court. The
case will go on to-morrow at 2 p. m.
â¢T never bought the goods in question,"
said Mr. Goerlitz; "they were ordered by
Mr. Lister, who had contracted with my
wife, not with me, to furnish her necessary
costumes for the performance. Upon my
recent arrival in San Francisco I learned
of this old account. I was advised that
neither in law or conscience was I liable
for this bill. I was willing to pay it, how
ever, to save my wife's name and to pre
vent Mr. Paderewski from annoyance, for
an attempt was made to 'bring him into
court. But somebody was hunting noto
riety, and hence this suit." , r . ./,
The farmers near Hamilton, Ohio, say
that large numbers of small grasshoppers
have appeared, and that they are as lively
as though it were the regular season for
grasshoppers.

A TURKISH WAR HERO
Arrival of the Russian Admiral
G. Makaroff, Fighter and
Inventor.
HAS BATTLED ON MANY SEAS.
The Best Way to Keep Great Ships
From Sinking in Times of
Peace or War.
Rear-Admiral S. Makaroff, the hero of
the Russo-Turkish war, formerly com
mander of the Russian fleet in the Med
iterranean, and lately commander of the
same fleet in the Pacific, is at the Cali
fornia.
lie is on his way to take command of
the Russian squadron in the Baltic.
Rear Admiral Makaroff is one of the
most famous men in the Russian navy.
He has been in many great battles at sea,
and has won promotion in many instances
because of his signal bravery. j
Besides a great fighter he is an author
Rear-Admiral S. Makaroff, the Noted Inventor and Hero of the Kusso-Turkish
War.
-and inventor, known the world over. His
inventions comprise bulkheads of his own
contrivance for preventing ships from
sinking, cushions for rams on warships, so
that at times of peace they may not acci
dentally injure other vessels, and many
other contrivances.
His whole life, when not fighting, has
been given in a large measure to a study
of how to prevent ships from sinking.
The famous rear-admiral was here
thirty-four years ago, when a midshipman
in the navy. It was in 1664, at the time of
the civil war. It will be remembered that
Russia, with a feeling of friendship toward
the United States, sent two vessels to this
country, one to New York and the other
to San Francisco. The rear-admiral,
then a youth of 14, was aboard the latter
vessel.
He has had many thrilling and danger
ous experiences in the different waters of
the world since then. He was given the
rank of lieutenant for the invention of the
collision mat and received two promotions
during the war -> i*h Turkey. He was first
made captain. of a corvette and then cap
tain of a frigate. The reason of the first
captaincy was because he was the first man
to hoist boats with torpedos. The promo
tion to the second position was because he
attacked and subdued a Turkish fleet in
its own harbor. . y
After that he made a specialty of attack
ing the fleets of the Turks in their harbors,
and, as all readers of naval history know,
sank many vessels.
His last voyage around.the world was as
commander of the Victory. The voyage
was begun in ISSG and ended in 1889, and .
was for the study of the temperature and
specific gravity of water. For his work
then he was made chief of artillery in the
Russian navy. He took four years and
wrote a book called "The Victory and the
Pacific." It is in Russian and French and
contains all bis conclusions in regard to
temperatures and specific gravities.
It is customary for the Russian Academy
of Sciences to each year award prizes to
the authors of the most valuable scientific
books issued during the year. In 1894, the
year the book came out} the admiral re
ceived the first prize. . ;,yV .
Before the rear-admiral sailed from
Hongkong on the City of Peking, on which
he reached here yesterday, he delivered an
address before the Hongkong Chamber of
Commerce on devices for minimizing the
effects of collisions at sea. There were
present many notable men from the navies
of England, Germany and other countries.
The address attracted great attention. â¢
Â» The rear-admiral says that after avoid
ing collisions altogether, if possible, the
second and most important thing is to
minimize the damages that may occur and
the third is to have water-tight bulkheads.
The admiral is a very entertaining con
versationalist. In an interview last night
he said:
If we cannot accept guns, capstans, winches,
etc., without trial, why then do we accept
bulkheads without trial? I propose that when
a ship has been fitted with engines, boilers,
water-tight doors and everything else which
cannot be damaged by water, a trial of the
bulkheads should take place by filling the
compartments with fresh water to the upper'
part of the bulkheads.
This trial ought to be made in the presence
of competent officials, who should certify that
the bulkheads are strong enough to withstand
the full pressure of water, and that they are
water-tight. This trial over, the boilers, cylin
ders, pipes, etc., can then be covered with the
usual non-conducting composition and the
cabin fittings put in their proper place. . Prob
ably all this work will occupy a week or so, but
the loss of time will be amply compensated for
by the ship being guaranteed absolutely trust
worthy in this respect. If the collision takes
place upon one of the main bulkheads two
compartments are filled with water.
In order to avoid this I propose that each
main bulkhead should be supplied with e^tra
small water-tight compartments at the side of
the ship, from ten to twelve feet wide. Then
the collision would only affect one bulkhead
of these small compartments, and the result
would be that instead of two big compartments
being filled with water only one big "compart
ment and the little one would be flooded. The
fourth remedy for preserving the safety of the
j ship consists of a means whereby leaking may
; be stopped.
Twenty-five years ago I proposed the use of
: collision mats; one of them was exhibited at
the Vienna Exhibition, and every man-of-war
; of every nation has them now. Lately I have
; improved the apparatus, but although they are
j invaluable on men-of-war I do not think they
i will be ever accepted for merchant ships, be
cause in order to use them to advantage the
crew must be regularly drilled. I do not say
the mats are useless for commercial ships, but
there are now more important improvements
which have prior claims to our attention.
Now I return to 'the second remedy. The gen
eral opinion is. that the colliding blow is so
very powerfuljthat nothing can mimimize the
effect of it; but I can give proofs that even
when the force of the blow is comparatively
slight the skin of the ship is penetrated. It is
a matter of fact that the vertical stem acts as
a knife and that very little energy is required
to penetrate the skin of the ship which is run
into.
We know, for instance that the Crathie, the
steamer which sank the big ocean liner Elbe,
' was of very small dimensions, and struck
when she was going at a very moderate rate of
speed. Everybody knows that the Elbe went
to the bottom in a very snort space of time and
only a few of the passengers and crew were
I saved. I was witness to a similar case in the
! Bosphorus. A Russian steamer, Azove, touched
j a big French mail steamer, the Provence. The
': speed of the Azove at the moment of collision
i was noj more than two or three knots, but her
i stem made a hole in the skin of the Provence,
j and the latter immediately went to the bot
i torn.
A big ironclad of 10,000 tons ramming at
five knots speed gives a striking blow of 15,000
foot tons, while the muzzle energy of one 12
inch projectile is 20,000 foot tons. You know
very well when you propel the projectile with
this energy one way the gun and the carriage
are thrown with the very same energy into the
opposite direction. Should nothing be ar
ranged to withstand this blow a lot of damage
would necessarily follow. But hydraulic buf
fers easily absorb this energy In a space of two
feet, and really the shock is scarcely felt on
board the ship.
The rear-admiral has yet other ideas in
regard to how to prevent the loss of great
ships. He has devoted a great deal of time
and attention to the subject, and is one of
the foremost men of his time in investiga
tions of this kind.
He is now 43 years old, and is a fine type
of the Russian commander, being a giant
in size and in every way of striking ap
pearance.
He will be in the City several days, and
will visit the 'Tni->n Iron Works, if he can
do so, and see tne process of ship-building
there. He will also visit the Lick Ob
servatory on Mount Hamilton.
FAIR CHILDREN'S CLAIMS
They Will Be Sold Under an
Order Made by Judge
Slack.
Collateral Inheritances Which Will
Be Bought at Their Face
Value.
The interests of the minor collateral
heirs to the Fair estate are to be sold.
Judge Slack issued the order yesterday in
pursuance of testimony previously given
and of an affidavit sent from Ida County,
111., by Thomas E. Fair, father of the
children whose interests are to be sold.
This bears out the statement made by
The Cam. two months ago, and vocifer
ously denied in certain quarters.
In his affidavit Fair says that owing to
the failure of crops and the low prices of
farm products for several years past, his
income from the farm has been very small,
and he has become involved in a consider
able amount of debt and has been forced
to mortgage his farm in order to meet the
actual expenses of his family. He says
further that all the children are living
with him and are dependent upon him for
their support and education.
There are no schools near his house,
affiant says, and owing to his financial con
dition it frequently happens that those of
the children who are old enough to work
upon the farm are detained from school in
order to assist with the farm work. He
says his wife and himself are both very
anxious that, their children be afforded
better opportunities for education and ad
vancement in life than it is possible for
them, with their limited means, and if the
minors can come into their estates, affiant
will be enabled, from the income there
from, to provide more suitably for his
children. SaUWfflM
But if, as is quite possible, the estate of
James G. Fair be involved in litigation,
and remain undistributed for years, the
opportunity to attend schools and to take
full advantage of the legacies will have
been passed and the principal value of the
legacies will be lost. The affiant therefore
prays that the court allow the interests to
be sold, provided, however, that not less
than $1111 11 be accepted for each.
No action was taken in the cases of the
Lundy children, as no affidavit has yet
been received from their parent, and Judge
Slack is unwilling to order their interests
sold until such affidavit as to their finan
cial condition' be forthcoming.
Teamsters Arrested.
The police last Wednesday warned all
drivers of heavy vehicles found on Golden
Gate avenue and notified by circular all truck
men and draymen that the avenue had been
declared a boulevard by resolution oi he Board
of Supervisors. A few days*, grace was to be
allowed before making any arrests and yester
day it was decided to take action. As a result
George McGrath, teamster; M. Compagno,
teamster; Julius Garnaud. laundryman, and
G. h. Hetty, teamster, were arrested. They
were released on giving $5 bail.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1896.
THE GALLAGHER BEQUEST.
How Miss Margaret Nugent
Copied the Draft of the
Will.
MEMORIAL BRICK IN WALLS.
Chief Justice Windeyer of Australia
Bobbed Heads With Superior
Judge Hunt.
The Australian and American judiciary
sat together in judgment when Justice
Windeyer and Judge Hunt occupied the
bench in the latter's courtroom yesterday
morning. His Honor from the antipodes
made the rounds of the City Hall early
in the morning and sat through a session
in Department 5 of the Superior Court,
where the Ellen Gallagher will case was
being tried. The visitor noted carefully
the proceedings and expressed himself as
highly pleased with the system and digni
fied movements of an American trial court.
The "Hanging Judge" of New South
Wales, as he is called, with his strong,
intellectual face, looks every whit the
firm, unbending judiciary in the seat of
justice.
In the opening of the case of P. J. White,
administrator of the estate of Ellen Galla
gher against Denis Nugent et al., Mr.
Hayes stated that the amount of the trust
funds or donations in the hands of Denis
Nugent at the commencement of the suit
was $24,000. Since then, under permission
of the court for the protection and closing
of the building, $9000 of that sum had been
spent.
Miss Margaret Nugent, sister of the de
fendant, was called to the stand by plain
tiff for rebuttal. Witness testified that she
copied from a rough, ill-spelled draft, Mrs.
Ellen Gallagher's will, at the request of
the testatrix. This was in Mrs. Galla
gher's room and nobody was present ex
cept those two.
"After you had copied that memoran
dum," asked Mr. Henley, "what did you
do with the original paper?"
"I do not know. Ido not remember."
"Did you give it to Mrs. Gallagher?"
"I do not remember what I did with it."
"Is your mind a perfect blank as to what
you did with it?"
"I do not remember."
"You remember that there was no one
present but yourself and Mrs. Gallagher?"
"Yes. sir."
"Did Mrs. Gallagher ever speak to you
about that memorandum?"
"I do not remember."
"Did you evei say anything to your
brother Denis about this?"
"No, sir; I never said anything to him
about it. The evening it was signed I told
him Mrs. Gallagher had made a will."
"Did he know of it already?"
Objection was made and overruled and
the witness answered:
"No, sir."
The witness could not swear positively
as to what days her brother was at Mrs.
Gallagher's, house, but was sure he was not
there the day she signed her will.
'Had you ever had any conversation
with Denis Nugent about the execution of
the will?" asked Henley.
"No, sir; I did not."
"Did you ever hear him say anything
about the execution of any will by Mrs.
Gallagher?"
"No, sir."
"Did you ever hear her have any conver
sation with him about the disposition by
Elien Gallagher of her property?"
This question was objected to as imma
terial and not rebuttal.
The courtâ l will allow it as a matter of
discretion.
"No, sir," answered the witness.
Mr. Henleyâ Did you ever have any con
versation with Denis Nugent in regard to
the disposition by Ellen Gallagher of her
estate, or her property or money.
Question objected to upon the same
ground; objection overruled; exception
taken.
"No, sir."
"Did you not know, for some time prior
to the death of Mrs. Gallagher, that she
was disposing, by purported gifts, to your
brother of large sums of money and prop
erty?"
"Yes, sir."
"Ana that never was mentioned between
you and your brother?"
Question objected to as leading; objec
tion overruled ; exception taken.
"I knew she was giving money to build
the church."
"I- will ask you if this had not been
made a matter of talk between you and
your brother, Denis Nugent?"
Mr. Campbellâ l object to the question.
There is a distinction between conversa
tion about disposition of the property and
whether or not they talked about her giv
ing the money.
Mr. Henleyâ Was this matter ever talked
about? Did you and your brother Denis
ever hold any conversation in respect to
the disposition of the money and property
of Ellen Gallagher? ; *
Mr. Campbellâ l object.
Objection overruled ; exception taken.
"Yes, sir, I knew she was building the
church."
Mr. Henleyâ Am I to understand by
that that you did talk about the disposition
by Ellen Gallagher of her estate with your
brother?
"Yes, sir; I knew she was giving him
the money for the church."
"Did you talk with your brother about
it?"
"Yes, sir, in general."
"Frequently?"
"Yes, sir." y
The witnese stated that on the Monday
after Mrs. Gallagher's death she got- the
will out of ; a drawer in the deceased
woman's room and gave it to Denis Nu
gent. She did not remember the general
contents of the will, excent that it left
$2500 apiece to several nephews and nieces
and $5000 in trust to the brother in Ireland.
In the cross-examination by Mr. Camp-
Bell she said that Mrs. Gallagher, before
she died, went down to the unfinished St.

Attorney Kearney forjtbe plaintiff in the
opening argument assailed the motives of
the defense with such vigor, and went into
the religious merits of the case so deeply
that the main fact of the question was lost
sight of. At the close of bis remarks Mr.
Campbell moved' that the defense follow
the lead of the plaintiff and submit the
case without argument.
Mr. Henley, however, took up the argu
ment and held that the burden of proof
lay upon the defense. They must show
that no undue influence was brought to
bear upon Mrs. Gallagher when she made
her will.
Mr. Campbell will address the jury this
morning, followed by Mr. Henley for the
closing. ;â  ' â  â  .
IS NOT APPEALABLE.
Some- New Points in Probate Law
Outlined.
The Supreme Court, in dismissing the
appeal from the order of the lower court,
setting aside the appointment of a guar
dian ad litem and a petition for the revo
cation of the probate of the will of Anna
M. Hathaway, has outlined an interesting
point in the law of guardians. The order
setting aside the appointment of a guar
dian is not appealable, the Supreme Court
says. A guardian is appointed by the
court, and that and his removal are under
the control of the court in which the case
is pending.
The order dismissing the petition for
revocation of probate is also not appeal
able, for the Supreme Court says: Aopel
late jurisdiction in such probate matters
may only be provided by law. and
while Section 963, Code of Civil Proced
ure, authorizes an appeal from an order
revoking the probate of a will, it does not
authorize an appeal from an order deny
ing the revocation of probate or dismissing
â¢ petition therefor. y
INSPECTED A SITE.
The Mayor Has Selected Â» Pesthouse
Location South of South San
. Francisco.
The Health and Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors paid a visit yesterday
to the site selected by Mayor Sutro for the
Pesthouse. The block is situated on the
bay shore south of South San Francisco,
and while considered a choice spot so far
as danger to the City is concerned, it is so
hard of access, on account of the road lead
ing to it, the members of the committee
gave It as their opinion that unless the
road is vastly improved the site will not do.
The Hospital Committee of the Board
of Health made an attempt to reach the
proposed site, but failed because the
vehicle conveying the party broke down.
Secretary Godchaux was gazing despair
ingly at the wrecked carriage when Her
man Schussler, the engineer of the Spring
Valley Company, happened along and in
quired: what the trouble was.
He acted the good Samaritan/for in his
buggy was a plentiful supply of ropes and
other appliances intended for just such
emergencies, and he soon had the health
officials' carriage in a fair condition to
return to the City.
The committee of the Supervisors will

RATES BY THE ISTHMUS.
The Panama Railroad Com
pany Issues a New
Schedule.
Westbound Tariff on Freight Is Not
Changed, Though Trouble Is
Brewing.
The Panama Railroad Company, through
its general agent, E. H. Hinton, in this
City, is issuing circulars giving rates of
freight from New York, Boston, Philadel
phia and Baltimore and points common
with each to San Francisco. This new
schedule does not show any reduction on
the old rates. It shows, however, that the
truce very recently established by the
Panama and Pacific Mail corporations is
not working as pleasantly as was antici
pated at first. The Panama Company was
not able to satisfy the Pacific Mail and C.
P. Huntington,- its guiding beacon, and
now it has come to pass that the former is
endeavoring to get a share of the business
in freight from Eastern " cities to San
Francisco. The schedule is as follows:
Effective February 15; 1895, and good until
Ap*il 1, 1896, unless sooner revolted, the fol
lowing will be the
Class rates to San Francisco from New
â¢ York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore
and points common with each, and slso
from points common with New York:
1 2 3 4\ 5 , ABODE
113 105 98 90 88 88 80 80 80 80
Subject to the Western classification.
Commodity rates from the foregoing points
to San Francisco will be the same as -. Sunset
Tariff No. C. 12 of March 5, 1895, with all sup
plements thereto, less the following discounts:
One-quarter off less than carload rates and
one-filth off carload rates. Observing mini
mum of 40 cents per hundred pounds, $3 will
be the minimum charge for any bill of lading.
Subject Â»o the following exceptions on cargo
from New York only:
' , . , Per 100 lbs.
OU, in barrels, or cases (not petroleum). In car
loads â¢ ; ...60c

Tobacco, plug, in packages weighing 60 lbs. or
more, each 80c
Dry goods and clothing, rated in Sunset tariff
above referred to, will take rates therein
contained ...Less Vs
It may be noted that commodity rates
are put upon tho same basis as the Sunset
routeâ C. P. Huntington's Southern Pa
cific Railway. This is regarded by local
railway menâ exclusive, of. course," of the
Southern Pacilic peoDle â as significant in
view.of latest news from New York, which
has appeared in The Call, as follows:
"Trouble has broken ont again between
the Panama Railroad and the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company. The Panama road
charges that traffic which should have
been turned over to it by the Pacific Mail
Company at Panama was diverted to the
Southern Pacific Railroad. The Allianca
had to make its last trip from Colon to
New York entirely without cargo.
"The Panama road, under its contract
with the Pacific Mail Company, operates
vessels on the Atlantic, while the Pacific
Mail conducts the vessel service on tho Pa
cific. The Pacific Mail asserts that it had
so much business } for Mexico Central
America and the west coast of South Amer
ica that it could not take business for New
York via the Isthmus of Panama."

ON THE ROLLING DEEP.
Ethel Corona Seidel Born on the
Steamer Corona Last
Tuesday.
MOTHER AND CHILD ARE WELL
The Family Was on the Way to San
Francisco From Humboldt
Bay.
A welcome little stranger came into the
world at 1:40 a. m. last Tuesday morning,
who, if she grows to womanhood, will
have hard work explaining just where she
was born. It was on the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's steamer Corona,
but in what latitude and longitude is not
exactly known, as Captain Doran had no
means of ascertaining, but it was not very
far from Point Arena, and with that the
little woman will have to be satisfied.
The child was not expected until the
latter part of next month, and the mother
was afraid it might die. As there was a
clergyman on board the christening took
place, and the baby was named Ethel
Corona Seidel, the latter being the family
When the Corona left Eureka among the
cabin passengers were A. C. Seidel and
wife. The latter was seasick almost from
the time the steamer left Humboldt Bay
and she crew gradually worse until 11
p. m. on Monday. Captain Doran was no
tified and was at first inclined to be angry
with the husband. When he saw the
anxiety on his face, however, he relented
and at once had the bridal chamber, the
most commodious quarters on the ship,
placed at Mrs. Seidel's disposal. There
little Ethel Corona was born and there she
spent the first twenty-four hours of nerlifrjâ
When Mrs. Seidel was first taken sick hrff
husband seemed very anxious to keep hv
name from the captain. When asked
what it was he answered, "W. May."
When seen on the wharf after the steamer
had docked he said it was "A. C. White."
However, it only took a few moments to
find out the true name of the couple, as
the number of their stateroom had to cor
respond wtth the purser's passenger list.
Afterward he explained that his anxiety
was due solely to the fact that he did not
want it known that his wife had given
birth to her first child at sea.
Mrs. Seidel is a very pretty little woman,
probably not more than 18 or 19 years old.
Just as soon as all the passengers had left
the ship her husband brought down an
ambulance and a doctor. The woman was
removed into the former, but what was
their destination no one could find out.

THE CHESHIRE CHEESE.
Pewter Mug for Bohemia From the Fa-
mous Tavern of London Town.
Alex G. Hawes and Joseph D. Redding,
who are well known in San Francisco,
have been visiting some of the places in
London town which possess significant in
terest to readers of English literature.
The following letter from Colonel Hawes
came to Charles Josselyn yesterday :
The other day Joe and I were dining at the
old Cheshire Cheese, the haunt and habitat ol
Dr. Samuel Johnson and of. Goldsmith and
many others of note in English literature. It
was from here while the bailiffs were outside
waiting to nab Oliver Goldsmith that Dr. John
son carried the manuscript of the "Vicar of
Wakefield" and sold it to a publisher for Â£60
and thus kept the poor chap out of quod.
We sat In the corner where the ponderous
Samuel and Boswell and a select circle used to
sit. The pewter mug even looked as if it might
have furnished the better beer for the doctor
and his confreres. So we had it inscribed and
send it to the Bohemian (Hub as a souvenir of
the Cheshire Cheese and of Dr. Samuel and of
our visit to London.
The oid tavern is by far the best preserved
and most interesting of all similar places in
London. They serve a bird pie here and also
"stewed cheese" which will knock any liver
silly. We both join in the request that you
present the mug to the club in memory of that
old bohemian whose honor we drunk, draining
it from his own chair in his favorite corner.
It goes forward by express, addressed to you
at the Bohemian Club. Sincerely yours.
Alex G. Hawes.
The pewter is inscribed on the side,
"The old Cheshire Cheese." On the bot
tom is this inscription: "Alexander G.
Hawes and Joseph D. Redding, dining at
the old tavern in London town, January
17, 1896, confiscated this mug to the use of
their thirsty brethren of the Olympic
Club." - -y"
In due time Mr. Josselyn will announce
when the formal presentation to the club
will take place.

The Quarterdeck Abolished.
The difference between the modern steam
vessel and the old-time sailing-ship is
marked in many ways, one of which is the
post of command.' On sailing-shins and
the earlier steamers the captain's and the
officer's post was on the quarterdeck,
which was as far aft as it was possible to
go. On the steamer of to-day the quarter
deck is abolished, except as a promenade
for passengers, and orders are given from
the bridge, well forward of amidships, and
sufficiently elevated to give a view of the
vessel from stem to stern. This is fre
quently as high as the maintop of a sail
ing-ship, and except for the stormcloths
that surround it in winter, is fully ex
posed. Ocean steamships have no covered
pilot-houses, as the sound and river steam
ers do, but on the bridge, where every roll
of the ship is exaggerated, the captain and
his aids maintain their constant lookout,
while even at that height they are occa
sionally drenched with spray.â New York

Sigell (III.;, September 23. 1895.
Gentlemen: I write you a note in praise of
o-To-Bac which I took* nearly three years ago.
I had been using tobacco nearly 50 years. The
liabit had grown on me to such an extent that
it required a pound every ten days. It so af-
fected my nervons system that I could. not
sleep, had no appetite and was used up gener-
ally. On the ldth day of January, '93, 1 com-
menced the use of No-To-Bac and gained 15
pounds the first month. No-To-Bac entirely
destroyed my desire for tobacco, and I have
not tasted the vile weed since. I am now 30
pounds heavier than when I used tobacco, and
I would like to say to every one who uses
tobacco, "Take No-To-Bac and be yourself
again. Very respectfully yours,
L. D. ROBEY, M.D.

their preliminary gallops like two-year
olds and the betting was heavy. Tile fa
vorites scored but twice. The" last three
races on the card were taUen by horses
carrying the green wiUi white sash colors
of Edward Corrigan, one of them, Tena
city, being a '20 to 1 shot in th- betting.
Despite Garner's shady handling of Liz
zie II in last Thursday's race, when she
finished third, the mare was made an 11 to
5 favorite in the betting on the second
event at six furlongs, showing conclusively
that the ring did not think she was meant
on that occasion. Garner got her away in
front, but took her back and at the end
was beaten out a "whisker by Sam Leake,
a 4 to 1 chance, ridden by Harry Griffin. .
The Spreekels entry. 'Foremost, was a
pronounced 6 to 5 favorite for the mile and
a furlong selling affair. Dungarven and
Red Root were the pick for second place
honor.-, each being held at fours. The out
i sider, E. 11. Sherley, took the lead after
! passing the stand and showed in fuont to
the stretch. Tenacity, who had moved up
to second place, here assumed the lead,
and although pressed hard by the favorite
nearing the wire won by a length in the
creditable time of 1:56. Dungarven was a
close third.
Babe Murphy was scratched from the
fourth event, and Kowaisky opened up a
6to 5 choice. At post time he had been
played down to 4 to 5, with Gallant, Main
stay and Minnie Ccc fancied in the order
named. . Â»
Jones took the favorite out in the lead
soon after the flag fell, and led into the
: stretch by a couple of lengths, with Gal
i lant following. A furlong from the wire
! the favorite looked beaten, but he re
; sponded to the whip, and in a hard drive
won by a neck. Braw Scot loomed up a
' dangerous factor the last part of the jour- ;
j ney, ami could Slaughter have brought
I him up sooner would have won. As it was
| he finished but a neck back of Gallant.
All were scratched out of the last race
over seven furlongs with the exception of
Olive, Ferris Hartman, Schnitz and Rode
gap.
Corrigan's fast mare was quickly backed
from 1 to 2 to 1 to 4, and won easily at the
end from Ferris Hartman.

This is "ladies' day" at. Ingleside and
also the concluding day of the meeting,
the racing for the coming two weeks being
transferred to the Bay District track. The
great three-cornered contest between Cad

miles, will be the special feature
of the day's card. All interest is
centered in the event, which promises to

be a most exciting exhibition of equine
endurance and speed.- Aii three horses are
in fine fettle, and each vt*i!l carry a heavy
commission on his chance. Extra, cars will
be run to the track for the accommodation
of the big crowd.
Secretary Sam Leake of the new Jockey
Club wore a .smile on his face when his
namesake nosed out Lizzie H in the
second race that was expressive of joy.
The popular secretary thinks the Darebin
horse a "real clinker" when fit, and
always places a dollar or two on him for
old companionship's sake.
Sir Vassar, second choice in the betting
on the second race, was left at the post.
Starter Caldwell laid the blame at Willie
Martin s door, and the jockey claimed the
starter to be at fault.
The track odds against Tim Murphy,
who won the last race on Monday, were
lo .', to . 1 - Yesterday the poolrooms
paid the "fortunate" holders of win
ning tickets 3 to 1. During the past
day s racing at Ingleside, sixty-three
races were run, with 339 horses as start
ers. I< ilty - seven horses have been
scratched before 10:30 a. m. and nineteen
after that time. Of the number of actual
horses starting the poolrooms have had
177 wrong jockeys posted on their bocks,
forty-six ? jockeys . on scratched horses,
twenty-nine horses with no jockeys given
and jockeys and odds on sixty-two horses
that were scratched at 10:30 o'clock in the

Owing to the recent radical changes
made in the racing rules by the League of
American Wheelmen it has been found
necessary to completely revise the pro
gramme of events to be contested at the
indoor tournament next month. New
entry blanks will be sent out to-day, and
will provide for all amateur races, except a
couple of Chinese events. There are to be
no professional races, as there are not
enough men in that class on the coast at
present. The events are as follows:
Thursday, March sâ One-mile scratch, invi
tation; one-mile scratch, open; grand Oriental
handicap, one mile (Chinese); ten-mile club,
scratch (trial eats).
Friday, March iiâ One-mile handicap; two
mile scratch; ten-mile club, scratch (trial
heats).
Saturday,March7, matineeâ One-mile novice;
two-mile Chinese race; one-mile handicap.
Saturday, March 7, eveningâ One-mile post
race (prizes diamonds); one-mile invitation;
one-mile Chinese, handicap; ten-mile â¢ club,
scratch (trial heats). ;
Sdnday, March 8, matineeâ One-mile special
club handicap, for the Bay City Wheelmen,
Olympic Club Wheelmen, Imperial Cycling
Club, California Cycling Club, San Francisco
Road Club; each race open only to members
of the club for which It is provided.
Sunday, March 8, evening â Half-mile
scratch, one-mile handicap, five-mile stratch

Tuesday, March 10â Half-mile handicap, one
mile scratch, invitation ; ten-mile club, scratch
(trial heats).
Wednesday, March Quarter-mile scratch,
one-mile handicap, ten-mile club, scratch
(final).
The prize list as published will have to
be revised, as the prizes for amateur events
cannot be as valuable as some of those
offered the class bracers.
News was received here yesterday that
the ten racing men now at Santa Monica
trying for records will at once join the pro
fessional ranks. They were all class B
men until the recent change in racing rules
abolished that class. The names of the
riders are: W. M. Randall, J. Bobbins, J.
F. Stayer, Eli Winsett, Roma' E. Dow, W.
W. Hatton, J. M. Campbell,' Wilbur J. Ed
wards, Earl H. Kiser and F. E. Schefski.
Dow and. Ed wards are from San Jose, and
ride under the colors of the Garden City
Cyclers. Robbins, Stayer, Winsett and
Campbell come from the north, Randall
from Rochester, N. Kiser from Ohio
and Schefski from Salt Lake. It Is prob
able that the team at Coronado will follow
suit, with the exception of C. S. Wells and
W. A. Terrill of the Bay City. Wheelmen
of this City, who will remain amateurs
until they see what the Eastern crack rid
ers are going to d 0... .
Champion Zimmerman .. received dis
patches from the East yesterday which
made him conclude be would return there
at once, so he left last evening on the Sun
set limited train. The local wheelmen did
not see as much of him" as they would have
liked, though a great many called upon
him at his hotel and enjoyed a few mo
ments', chat. He could not say what his
future movements would be, but thought
he might go to France about the end of
April.
F. H. Dunne, C. W. Hawks and H. W.
Welch, of the Bay City Wheelmen, started
on a trip through San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties yesterday.

Sarsaparilla, has been introduced in Port
land lately arid many of our best families
are how using it. T used Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla myself. I found it pleasing
to the taste = and effectiveâ yes, very effec
tive. .1 was not in a dying condition,
of course not, . but I felt mean, all
run down, or, to use the proper
word, I .fell jaded. After using one
bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla I
felt so much better that I ordered another
bottle, and the result is ; entirely satisfac
tory. Ladies and gentlemen are now

THE PRINCE AT SCHOOL.
A Keception Tendered: to the Koyal
Visitor at the Italian
School.
Yesterday was Italy's day at the Le
Conte School on Powell street, it being the
occasion of the visit of Prince Luigi, Cap
tain Bertoiini and Lieutenant Cagni of the
cruiser Cristoforo Colombo.
President P. Barbierl of the school pre
pared the pupils and their teachers for
their visitors and an entertaining literary
and musical programme was carried out.
All of the children were assembled
in a large room when the Prince
and his companions arrived, and the royal
visitor was greeted with cheers and the
waving of small American and Italian
flags. The Prince was highly pleased with
the patriotic feeling shown by the chil
dren for the two countries, one the land of
their blood and the other the land of their
birth.
An address of welcome was made by
M iss Mary Ferogiaro, a little schoolgirl,
and the singing of several songs in the
two languages closed the exercisss.
The Irish mailboats receive $455,000 a
y car subsidy. This is only $20,000 less
than is paid for all the North American
mails from Queenstown to New York.
using Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and a 1
that I know praise it. It is a great rem
edy. It works like a charm and does not
gripe. It cleanses the blood an i yet brings
out no pimples. Certainly Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla is a very valuable family
remedy." . .:
After leaving Mr. Deveny ' I talked with
several well-known ladies, and they alii
agreed Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla was a
line remedy. As I have before remarked
one does not â¢ meet the substitute here.
There are ho mean people here who wish
to offer something just as good for the
home remedyâ Vegetable Sarsapa

during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means nigh barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast
When the pressure is high in the Interior and low
along the const, and the Isobars extend north and
south along the coast, rain is probable; hut when
tbe "low" is inclosed with isobars of marked curva
ture rain south of Oregon Is improbable. With a
"filch" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falllnc to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these conditions will produce
an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. 18.â The movements
on the Stock Exchange to-day were not especially
important. The transactions aggregated only
153,175 shares but speculation was characterized
by a very firm tone, the strength being attributed
to purchases for London account, the success of
the Government loan ana the prevailing belief that
if any further legislation In favor of free silver is
attempted it is sure to meet with defeat. In the
early trading prices advanced Vi to li 4 per cent in
the usually active list. Louisville and Nashville,
the grangers. Sugar. Manhattan and Tennessee
Coal and Iron led the upward movement.
In the afternoon the traders became bearish, and
under their sales a reaction ensued. Manhattan
fell to 104%. Leather preferred to 65%, Missouri
Pacific to 22*4' Chicago Gas to 68, Jersey Central
10 1071.2. Tobacco to 79^Â£, General Electric to
30%' and the- remainder of the list from 3,4 to %
per cent. Speculation left off barely steady in
lone at a recovery of 1Â» to i/ 2 per cent. Sugar was
strong, owing to the reports that the directors will
dei hire the usual dividend early in March and an
extra dividend Of 10 per cent after the adjourn
ment of Congress.
lie heavy cain In the earnings of the St. Paul
road for the second week of February made a
favorable impression upon the market. The net
changes show losses of Vi to is per cent, Man
hattan leading. Bonds were easier. The transac
tions aggregated $1,196,000. Iron Mountain firsts

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lIX., Feb. 18.â It was difficult to dis
cover any feature or noteworthy incident attend
ing the trade in wheat this morning. Prices were
a trifle irregular in their action and denoted noth
ing in particular, the chances accompanying the
variations in the temper of the local speculative
crowd. At the opening some little interest was
taken in the world's shipments for last week which
aggregated 5,734,000 bushels. The estimate made
yesterday placed them at 7,000,000 bushels, the
difference being the motive for early buying and
causing some firmness.
The offerings, however, soon became large
enough to âcause prices to sink below yesterday's
close. , Liverpool cables were quiet and steady.
Northwestern receipts were a little smaller, 452
cars arriving, against 671 last Tuesday and 650 a
year ago. Chicago received 157 cars and in
spected out 117.584 bushels. Export clearances
were light at 292,878 bushels. Bradstreet's report
of an Increase in the world's available supply of
900,000 bushels brought In a number of selling
orders, causing further weakness. Closing Ant
werp cables were unchanged and Berlin lower.
Paris had a holiday. May wheat opened from
655 B (gS6si. 2 c, sold between 65%@66c and 64% c,
closing at 64'i B @6sc, ift@Vsc under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 115 cars.
CORNâ The opinion in many instances is that
corn will move more freely with any improvement
in country roads. The receipts to-<lay were quite
large at 535 ears. The market opened easy on
these considerations and was further weakened by
sympathy with wheat. Withdrawals from store
were 60.746 bushels. Liverpool cables were quiet
and steady. Export clearances were large at
470,926 bushels. Bradstreet's reported a decrease
In available stocks of 479,000 bushels. May corn
opened at SOc, sold between 30Â®30Vsc and 29 %@
29 % c, closing at 29@29%C, 14c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 365 cars.
OATSâ The sentiment in corn extended to oats
and caused rather an easy feeling in that grain.
The trade continued comparatively light, with oc
casional spasms of activity. Receipts were 323
cars. There were no withdrawals from store.
Bradstreet's gave an Increase In available stocks
of 352,000 bushels. May oats closed Vie under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 211
cars. BES3M
FLAXâ Was easy: cash, 90@90Vj>c; May, 91Â»
@92Vic. Receipts, 25 cars.
PROVISIONSâ A few minutes of firmness was
observed at the opening of the product market,
but the strength tailed to hold, and when wheat
lost its support, product seemed to have suffered
in a similar manner. There was a subsequent
rally and a steady close, with May pork and ribs
unchanged, and May lard 21 2 c under yesterday.

ECHOES OF THE VIGILANTES.
Most of His Early Associates Have
Joined the Army of Those
Gone on Before.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
90S Broadway, February IS. f
At the home of Colonel W. J. Shanklin
on Madison street is a man who knows
more perhaps of the inside facts of Califor
nian history than any one now living.
The man referred to is Colonel Shanklin's
brother-in-law, J. J. Avers, one of the
founders of the San Francisco Morning
Call.
He came to this State in 1843, crossing
Central America and coming north on a
coasting vessel.
Mr. Ayers in appearance has not passed
much beyond the prime of life, although
his hair is almost snow white. He stands
erect and carries himself much like a mili
tary man. He is from a New York family,
James J. Ayers, Printer, Jonrnalist and Author, and One of the Founders of the
San Francisco t' Call."
and received his early newspaper training
in the composing-room of the St. Louis
Republican.
It was while there that he accepted Hor
ace Greeley's advice snd came West to
crow ip with the country.
He was found this afternoon Bitting on
the veranda at his brother-in-law's home
reading a paper. He said, in conversa
tion :
I believe I can safely say 1 started the oldest
newspaper fn this State. It was in 1 851 that
Harry Decot "Henry Hamilton and myself
bought a printing outnt in San Francisco and
took ourselves to Mokelumne Hill, where we
soon had the Calaveras Chronicle appearing
weekly. The camp was a large one and very
lively at that time. I was op there about a
week ago. it is only a ghost of the camp It
was in those days. I believe that paper is the j
only one which has been published continu
ously ever since under the same name. In i
'53 I went East on a visit, and when I returned,
in company with others, we leased the theater
there and I became a theatrical manager.-
I returned to San Francisco in 555,s 55, and
began work on the Herald, which whs a large
commercial paper up to theday the "Vigilance
Committee" was formed. That committee was
formed of all the d'.-ceiit element of the City,
and Its object was to clear the City of some of
its hard character.". The next day the Herald
came out In favor of law and order, and
strongly oppo.-ed the action of the committee.
By night its adverti.-ers had all withdrawn
their support and the subscribers had all
ordered the paper stopped. A small sheet,
known as the Town Talk, came out in favor of
the ''Vigilante," and It went ahead like a.
rocket. Advertisers rushed to it and the sub
scriptions rolled in.
This left vacant the field for a small and
cheap paper. 1 saw the opportunity and was
not slow in grasping it. There were five of us,
practical -.mere and newspaper fellows, so ,
we pooled our issues and formed a co-operative .
company to get out a daily at 12% cents per
week. We named it the Morning CALL, which
name it retained until its present proprietor, I
believe, changed the name to the San Fran
cisco Cau.. I was chosen editor and was to
assist a setting type when not otherwise em
ployed.
David Vf. Higgles, now a wealthy but retired [
publisher at Victoria, B. C, was my assistant
In both capacities. That was our editorial and
reportorial force. George Edwards Barnes was
our business manager. He was assisted by
Peter B. Forster, now passed away. Charles V.
Johnson was 'lie chief compositor. He, too,
has gone the way we will all have to go.
In those days a paper never had but two
men oa the editorial and reportorial staff
combined, and they ranked as editor and as
sistant. We had success from the start and in
a few weeks had to enlarge our paper. When
we started it was a little smaller than the front
page of The Call to-day. The original plan
on which the paper was laid out was to con
dense and to tell everything in the most con
cise manner possible. There were no railroads
or graphs In those days, but we did not lack
for sensations by any means. There was al
ways some excitement to keep up the interests
of readers, as there is to-day. We often had
' duels to report, politics were lively and then
raining news was always a source of great in
terest.
Every two weeks the steamers arrived, and
we would receive a lot of old Eastern papers
with the doings of the people in the States.
We would go through them and get the most
interesting news out for the next day. Then
later, as we had more time, we could go over j
them again and get out more that was of in
terest, Our policy was to issue a clean family
newspaper. It was well conducted aud a thor
oughly representative, square and honest pa
per. S'aturally advertising came in to us and
we built up, enlarging as became necessary,
until at the end of ten years it was the beat
paving paper on the coast. At that time we
had a subscription of 17,000 in a population of
70,000.
The manner of how the paper was named has
been told, but it may be new to many of its
renders to-day. We had talked the matter over
together and decided that we didn't want any
of the old names; we wanted to have some
thing entirely new. one Sunday morning we
v c.-c ail standing on Kearny street, when a
I iil-poster came along and put up the an
nouncement that Julia Dean Hayne would ap
t 1-u.t as Partheula in "Ingomar," and the per
formance would close with the roaring farce,
'The Morning Call." "There we are, boys." 1

A MONTH OF MARRIAGE
It Proved to Mrs. Brock That
Hyman Was a De
ceiver.
Oakland Streets Already Gay for the
Washington Birthday Cele
bration.
Oakland Office San- Francisco Call,)
<â¢ 908 Broadway, Feb. 18. f
Mrs. Brock is a young woman who is
convinced that so far as she is concerned
marriage is a dire failure. She made
this discovery less than a month after she
became Mrs. Brock.
The young wife appeared before Judge
Frick to-day and told of her marital ex
periences. A few weeks after marriage
her husband took her for a target and
fired many articles at her, amor.tr them an
old shoe and a pistol bullet. - On one occa
sion, according to her complaint, Brock
went home intoxicated and threw himself
upon a bed in which their little baby was
sleeping. The mother rescued the babe,
the father objected and Mrs. Brock was
the sufferer. .
He varied his acts of violence with oc
casionaLthreats to kill his wife and once
he tried to carry out the threat, but the
bullet lodged" in the wainscoting instead
of in Mrs. , Brock's head. A Boot was
hurled at her with such violence that she
was sick for several days. A year ago, to
the young wife's great relief, Brock left
her in peace, y
, Brock is a bookkeeper and has been em
ployed by some of the Alaska canneries,
He went off a year ago and now his wife
need no longer call herself by the name of
the man she married, for Judge Frick
considered her allegations Droved and sent
her on her way rejoicing.

Williams, matron. From the records we find
that 9.1 ladles have been registered during the
past year. Of these 15 are students attending
the university, kindergarten and other schools,
0 are seamstresses, 17 nurses, 11 teachers, 7
salesladies, 3 companions, 5 dressmakers, the
balance being transients. On an average dur
ing the past seven months every available
room has been occupied.
We have again and again reiterated that our
boarding home is not a charity, but fills a
needed want, a refined Christian home at the
lowest price, also that young women out of
work and money shall be retained. The man
agement exercises a kindly discretion, not
keeping the paying of board ever before them,
but still giving them to understand they can
pay all Indebtedness as such course Is right in
the sight of God and man. Some good lriends
realizing how hard it is to run a house and
set such a good table with so little money nave
occasionally remembered the home with sub
stantial donations.
Mrs. Anson Barstow, as treasurer, reports the
receipts at $4137 95 during the year, and $2 14
from last year. Disbursements, $4074 84; bal
ance on hand, $65 25.
The matron, Miss Williams, reported the
receipts from boarders as $3015 88, and the
expenditure of $2095 61; balance paid to
treasurer, $920 27. This makes an average of
5-135 95 per month for the total expense of the

THE EXCHANGE IS SAFE.
No Loss of Trade on Account of the
Dressmaker's Ruse,
V- OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 18.â Mrs. W. E.
Sharon, president of the Women's Ex
change, says that the failure to remove
their sign from the original exchange, on
Fourteenth street, has not caused them
any loss of business, although it has
caused much inconvenience.
Mrs. Caldwell, the dressmaker, who is
trading on the sign, is not, it is said, de
riving any benefit from her ruse, but is
losing on account of it. Last Saturday Mrs.
Caldwell hung out an extra sign contain
ing the words, "Women's Exchange," but
although tbat is a clear infringement of
the rights of the legitimate, organized ex
change, the ladies have decided to take no
action, as they feel the publication of the
facts has sufficiently enlightened the
public.
The exchange is now doing a business
averaging from $500 to $900 a month and
is steadily increasing. Its value is mani
fested in many ways. One woman is
keeping herself and five children through
its assistance. Aid is extended to women
who are competent and desirous of help
ing themselves, and the lady patronesses
of the institution give much* time toward
fostering it,

Disastrous Eire on Thirteenth.
â¢ OAKLAND.CaI., Feb. 18.â Fire broke out
in the rear of the building on Thirteenth
street, between Washington and Clay,
known as the Ladies' Co-operative Home.
As soon as the alarm was turned in the
whole of the back of the building was- in
flames. It is an old structure and when
once the fire got headway its progress was
very rapid. A second alarm was turned in
and the i re was worked from both Thir
teenth i nd Twelfth streets. Before the
Fire Department got control of the fire it
had reached to the attic from the kitchen
where it originated.
During the excitement the ladies of the
home reported that there was a sick man
in one of the room*'. He was taken there
from the Receiving Hospital a few days
ago, and after being carried out he was
taken to the hospital in the patrol wagon.
Before the lire was put out the building
was' badly-gutted.
The damage will probably reach $2000,
part of which is covered by insurance!
The Ladies' Co-operative Society, to whom
the building was leased by F. K. Shattuck,
conducted the home as a cheap lodging
house. * Â°

Haimnerberg's Death an Accident.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 18â An inquest :
was held to-night into the death of John !
A. Hammerberg, foreman of the section
crew on the Fruitvale and Laundry Farm
Railroad, who died shortly before raid
night last night as a result of injuries re
ceived in an accident on the road, which
occurred about 6:15 a. m. yesterday. The
crew had just started to go to work on the
handcar when it jumped the track, going
over an embankment near a trestle. The
men on the handcar with Hammerberg
were Louis Alberg, J. C. Warren, C. Bone
zeno and F. Fitzpatrick.
In propelling the handcar the men on
one side pushed too hard on the lever,
causing the front trucks of the car to leave
the track. Where, the accident occured
there is a slight curve in the track, which
made it much easier for the car wheels to
''ride" the rails. The car ran on a short
distance upon the ties and then pitched I
over a ten-foot embankment, carrying all
the men with it.
All the section hands were more or less
injured by the fall, but it was not thought !
at the time that any serious results would j
follow. Hammerberg was taken to his i
home and Drs. Beckwith and Fortin were j
called in. The only external injuries that
they could find was a slight abrasion in
the vicinity of the hip. The man seemed,
however, to have been qajte severely in
jured internally and died about midnight.
He was a married man, a native of Swe
den and about 36 years of age. He had
been employed by the company about five
years.
After hearing the evidence the jury re
turned a verdict of accidental death.

TO PROTECT SICK HORSES
The Humane Society Wants
Funds for a Well-Equipped
, Ambulance.
DR. CARPENTER'S INVENTION.
. .. â  â  â 
Many Valuable Animals Have Been
Slaughtered for Lack of Means
of Removal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
903 Broadway. Feb. 18. i
The recent horrible death of two horses
in a ditch at Fruitvale has . caused the
Humane Society of this city to feel the
urgent necessity of an ambulance for the
removal of horses when such accidents
happen.
A similar need was felt for many years
by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals in San Francisco, and
three years ago Dr. Thomas Carpenter,
who is now a prominent officer of the
Humane Society of this county and
veterinary inspector for Alameda, seeing
the urgent need, invented an ambulance,
which has proved a blessing to suffering
horses and cattle. It has also, been the
means of saving animals that would other
wise have been sacrificed.
This ambulance was never patented nor
will it ever be, as Dr. Carpenter desires
every society to have the privilege of using
the vehicle whenever needed.
The body of the ambulance is patterned
after the old Bergh system of New York,
which has a platform on rollers. To this
Dr. Carpenter has added a rubber bed and
pillows and a mask padded two inches
thick with felt, with an apron over the
eyes, to blind the animal during removal.
The mask is to prevent injury to the head,
as all horses have a tendency to throw the
head around when hurt, and frequently
injure themselves seriously.
If obstreperous, this is prevented by the
padded mask. A rubber bucket of water
is carried to wash the wounds or quench
the thirst of the horse.
The apparatus consists of a strong frame
work of iron, suspended on a trolley track,
assisted in its work by a compound hoist
in block, by which one man can lift a ton
weight.
The track is divided in the center and
doubles back on itself when not in use.
The end of the track i 3 supported by a
twelve- foot tubular tripod, which can be
adjnsteu over an excavation, cellar hatch
way or a hole in a wharf, or. as in some
cases, where horses or cows fall between,
the wharf and a steamer.
The horse is removed by a stem of
slings, a most perfect- arrangement, in
vented ten years ago by Dr. Carpenter's
now deceased father, W. H. Carpenter.
The hoisting apparatus is attached to
the driver's seat by a double block con
nected with the trolley over the driver's
seat. The horse is lifted right up into the
ambulance by this arrangement without
the least suffering.
Dr. Carpenter says the need of such an
ambulance is seen almost daily in the ani
mal work of the humane society of this
city, and the only reason that they do not
have it is for lack of money to pay for one.
The cost would be $1000.
ANOTHER BOND ELECTION.
It Will Be Held in Berkeley
Under the School
Law.
A Branch Republican Leagueâ Student
Laborers to Celebrateâ New

BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 18.â Steps have
been taken by the Board of Education for
the calling of another special election to
again submit to voters a proposition for
providing new schools for Berkeley.
I'he election will be under the school
law and will be a school-district election,
called by the Board of County Supervisors
at the instance of the Berkeley Board of
Education. y yy; y
At a meeting of the School Directors
last night a committee consisting of Presi
dent Boom and Directors Robertson and
Neihaus was appointed to consult with
the Town Attorney as to the nature of
the bonds and the rate of interest. The
committee will report at the board's next

will probably be called.
No decision has yet been reached as to
the amount of bonds to be asked for, but
the amount will probably be about $60,000.
It is proposed to secure grammar schools,
as was projected in the election held last
Saturday, and also a; school at Lorin and
one at East Berkeley, to relieve the Kel
logg school, so that the latter can be used
as a high school.

Fraternity Houses Damaged,
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. Some un
known person or persons, presumably,
town boys, started on a tour of devastation
among the fraternity houses at about 3
o'clock this morning. They seemed to
single out the "frat" houses for their work
of demolition, as no other buildings are
reported to have been molested.
Breaking windows, stealing door-plates
and metallic house numbers were the main
features of their work/ Besides breaking
a 4 by 5 heavy plate glass window in the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon House on Charming
way, they forced the front door open and
were about to commit further depredations

A GIRL TAKES HER LIFE
Alameda to Have a Permanent
Home for Its Library or
None.
Death of Captain A. H. Morse, a
Seafaring Manâ Divorce
Granted.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 18.â City
Trustees have set at rest all discussion as
to whether or not the library trustees
shall erect a temporary structure for the
use of the library by passing a resolution
forbidding action to that end. City At
torney Taylor submitted bis opinion to
the board, touching on the right of the
library trustees to erect a building or pur
chase real property without the consent of
the Municipal Trustees, and it read as
follows:
To the Honorable the Board of Trustees of the
City of Gentlemen: Replying to your
inquiry, I will state that under the act estab
lishing free libraries the board of trustees of
the free library and reading-room have au
thority to purchase real estate and erect build
ings only with the consent and approval of
your honorable board.
This opinion settles the proposition to
build a $2500 temporary structure. There
are now but two things which the Library
Trustees can do. One is to remove into
the room in the new City Hall designed
for the library, and the other is to erect a
permanent: building. A scheme for the
latter at present seems to be well ad
vanced, and the probabilities are that it
will go through. There seems to be no
legal obstacle in its way. and it appears to
some the most satisfactory solution of the
matter.
A Girl's Unexplained Suicide.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. IS.â With an
eight-ounce bottle of strychnine lying at
her side Lena Neilson, a comely girl about
21 years of age, was found this afternoon
prone upon the bathroom floor in the resi
dence of her employers, Mr. and Mrs. R.
S. Clark of 2111 Alameda avenue. It was
evident that the girl had taken the poison
with suicidal intent. She had made every
preparation for the commission of the
rash act. and her desire to die was grati
fied. What her motive was does not
appear, for it was not known that,
she kept company with any male
companions or had had any mis
fortune lately befall her. When Mrs.
Clark left her home this morning at 8
o'clock to go on a trip to San Francisco
she did not notice that the girl appeared
to be troubled, but on the contrary she
noticed the girl's light-heartedness.
Mrs. Clark arrived home again at almost
5:30 o'clock, and upon opening the front
door saw a note lying on the carpet. She
perused its contents which read as follows:
. Mrs. Clark You will find the key to the
backdoor on the window sill by the porch
behind the blind. Lena.
Mrs. Clark did not understand the con
tents of the note until, upon searching
through the different rooms and coming
to the bathroom, she stumbled across the
body of her late servant. Recovering from
her fright, she picked up the vial of strych
nine, which was entirely empty, and an
other note which she found by the girl's
side. The second note gave the address
of her relatives. It was written on a torn
and soiled piece of note paper and was as
follows: "My aunt's address is 935 Santa
Clara avenue, Alameda; my sister, Eighth
and Washington streets, Oakland; Dr.
Demi, Fourth street and Telegraph avenue,
I Oakland, Palmer House; Key to my
room." y{; "â¢â¢;â ;
Deputy Coroner Smiley took charge of
the remains of the suicide and will hold
an inquest to-morrow. It was his opinion
that tne girl had been dead for at least six
hours, which leads to the belief that she
took the poison shortly after Mrs. Clark's
departure for the City.
A' Divorce Granted.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 18.â Judge Frick
has granted Isabella Brock a divorce from
John C. Brock. They were married in
Alameda May 10, 1.893, and have one child.
The ground set forth by plaintiff was ex
treme cruelty, ..which culminated in No
vember, 1895, as is alleged, when the de
fendant red a pistol at plaintiff with
intent to kill her. An answer was made
to the suit, but there was no contest at the
trial. The plaintiff was awarded the cus
tody of the child and $10 alimony.
Death of Captain Morse.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 18.â Captain A.
H. Morse, a retired mariner, died this
afternoon at his residence, "; B93 Union
street. He bad been ill for a long time of
a complication of diseasesâ dropsy, kidney
troubles and general debilityâ and the end
was not unexpected. Captain Morse had
been a follower of the sea since boyhood,
and when he came to this city to live some
years ago had accumulated quite a snug
fortune, which he spent liberally in
building and beautifying a home. He was
never married, but a widowed sister, Mrs.
Foy, kept house for him. He was 64 years
of age and a natiye of Main?.

SECRET FROM THE GRAVE
Annie Parker Sacrificed Her
Life to Make a Friend
Happy.
A Sentence in a Letter From the East
Brought Her Face to Face With
the Inevitable.
Oakland Office San Francisdo Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 18. J
Now that Annie Parker is in her gravo
the secret that caused her to end her life
in the bay has come to light. The story
of tbe young woman's trouble bears out
all that her friends and relatives have said
of her worthiness and nobility of charac
ter.
The secret is contained in one sentence
of a letter received from Mrs. Wood by
Miss Parser a few days before the young
dressmaker left her home for the last time.
The sentence referred to asked Miss Parker
to do all in her power to help make cir
cumstances such that it would be possible
for the absent wife to return ?.nd reside in
happiness with her husband.. What the
circumstances were is but too well known.
They are told in a letter received by Mr.
Wood two weeks ago and shown to a re
porter.
The absent wife told her husband that
as she stood before the altar in the little
church at Maryland before which they had
been married, she had prayed earnestly
that he might be able to free himself from
the demon that was destroying him. The
same wish was expressed to Miss Parker.
To one of her intimate friends Miss Par
ker had told more of her inmost thoughts
than sue appears to have told her brother
and sister.
For thirteen years Miss Parker had been
in the employ of the Woods. During
this time she learned to lean great! v on
the Woods as a child might toward its
parents. Mr. Wood said he was accus
tomed to call her Annie and he looked
upon her as one of the family. It is Known
that the friendship between Woods and
Miss Parker was of an intense nature, and
during the past few months it increased
rather than decreased. Miss Parker was
conscious of it, but did not possess the
strength of will necessary to subdue it.
After Mrs. Wood went East the friend
ship between Wood and Miss Parker was
very noticeable. This was known to the
family and was the thought that induced
Albert Parker to go to Wood's house the
same night that Annie was missing. The
young woman made every effort to stifle
any demonstration that might not be
strictly honorable toward her absent
friend, but, according to Wood and the
stories of her intimate friends, she did
cherish an affection for him.
Then came the letter from the East. It
asked in clear language that the one who
knew better than any one else the circum
stance that had separated husband and
wife should use her influence to bring
about a restoration. It was more than
that lonely heart could bear. The mission
was too exacting.
Miss Parker knew that she could never
carry it out. Her honest nature realized
the danger of the situation. With true
conscientiousness she faced the tragic in
evitable and decided that the path of re
conciliation for Mrs. Wood would be much
more smooth if those whom God had
united were left to themselves.
When the final debate took place no one
will know, but evidently prior to the
evening before it was carried out. The
unhappy girl sacrificed her life rather than
have it appear that she had done aught on
which the world might frown.
DYING IN THE HOSPITAL.
Poor Mamie Pease Is Another Victim
to Malpractice.
Mamie Pease, a very pretty and young
blonde girl, is dying at the City and
County Hospital. As a matter of fact, she
may be dead by the time The Call reaches
its readers.
Dr. Maximilian A. Cachot of 207 Taylor
street brought the case to light yesterday,
when he caused C. W. Harrington to have
the sick girl taken from her abode at 42
Turk street to the City and County Hospi
tal. Harrington has for a long time been
the protector of the sick girl, whose finan
cial friend is an employe of the Southern
Pacific Company at the Oakland mole.
Last Frit' ay Dr. Cachot was called in,
and has attended the girl from day to day
ever since. To him she has denied that
any criminal operation has been per
formed upon her, notwithstanding the in
dications to that effect.
She referred to the railroad man in all
her statements to the physician, and
claimed he should settle all the bills, as he
was the cause of them.
Among the well-known products of rice
may be mentioned arrack, or rack, often
called "rice spirit," which is distilled in
Rangoon, Bataviaand Ceylou. It is chiefly
transhipped to North Germany and Russia.
In the latter country it is flavored with
pine and other seeds, according to the
taste, and is then consumed by the natives
at a strength of many degrees over proof.
At birth no infant can see. It requires
two or three weeks for the sight to come
into full operation.

DANGEROUS SCALE PEST.
Good "Work Done by a Horticultural
Quarantine Officer.
Owing to the vigilance of Quarantine
Officer Craw of the State Horticultural
Commission, Golden Gate Park has been
si.nred one of the worst insect pests that
could have entered the State. Superin
tendent McLaren of the park wanted some
of the double flowering prune trees to acid
to the attract. of the park, and he
sent to Japan for a number of trees. When
the Gaelic arrived recently ten of these
trees were on board.
Mr. Craw made an examination of the
importations and found all the trees in
fecied with one of the worst kind of scale
pests known to horticulturists. It is a
small red insect, with a botanical name of
twelve syllables. It fastens upon the hark
and the outer coverintr is the color of the
bark itself. In Cuba, Central America and
Japan various methods have been tried to
destroy the insect, and all acknowledge
that it is a matter of great difficulty to do
so. Some time atro the pest got a bold on
the trees in Washington, and the only
way it was destroyed was by cutting and
burning the trees.
If by any chance this terrible pest had
secured a foothold in Golden Gate Park
there is no telling the amount of damage
it would have done. Mr. Craw destroyed
by fire all of the trees that arrived in the
Gaelic.

There is in existence a curious class of
knives of the sixteenth century, the
blades of which have on one side the
musical notes to the benediction of the
table, or grace before meat, and on the
other side the grace alter meat. The set
of these knives usually consisted of four.
They were kept in an upright case of
stamped leather and were placed before

REV. ANNA SHAW
CALLED GREEDY.
The Suffrage Association
Compared to a Tag
less Donkey.
WOMEN ARE AT OUTS.
Mrs. Harland's Charge of Would
Be Boss Rule Against Mrs.
and Miss Cooper.
A FEMININE TAMMANY KING.
The Ex-State Organizer Sure That
Her Deposition Was Due to Mrs.
Cooper's Antagonism.
The cry of "boss rule" has been raised
in woman suffrage councils in this City.
There are those who have the temerity
to insinuate that a feminine Tammany
ring as rapacious as the Gotham society
of unenviable fame exists in and rules the
joint committee representing the Woman's
Suffrage Association and the constitu
tional amendment campaign committee of
California.
They go farther and impeach Rev. Anna
H. Shaw as the moving spirit in a game of
grab, in which Susan B. Anthony follows
a close second, and Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper
playing into their hands.
It was at a semi-business, semi-social
gathering in a pretty uptown clubroom
that the matter was freely discussed yes
terday. It was an assemblage of types and
interminglings of types. The society
woman was there iniiltra-fashionabie at
tire. Beside her stood a woman who goes
in for dress reforms and believes in the
doctrine of one Dr. Malthus. Their neigh
bor is a socialist in practice as well as in
theory. Somewhat in the background was
a whitehaired lady who is conservatism
personified, except that somewhere and
somehow she was bent suffrageward.
There were others who seemed an amalga
mation of two or more of these types.
It was a representative assemblage and
there was a practically unanimous .senti
ment in regard to the situation, a belief that
greed for power is the Scylla and greed for
money the Charybdis that threaten suf
fragists.
Mrs. Hester A. Harland, the deposed
State organizer, was a conspicuous figure
of the group. She told the story of her
deposition to an attentive audience.
"We will lose," she said by way of pre
face. "There are seven or eight counties
in which an interest is shown in princi
ples of political equality. In the remain
der scarcely a thought is given to it. We
have no chance except to make this an
educational campaign. If we do not em
brace it we will be as far from the realiza
tion of our hopes as we were twenty years
ago.''
Mrs. Harland is a handsome woman of
winning personality. She is affable and
tactful. Her appearance won attention
and her story held it.
"Yes, we will fail, ladies," she contin
ued, "because ours is a personal, not a
political, campaign. When I was making
my tour of the counties organizing suffrage
societies and arranging for Miss Shaw's
lectures I received notice from headquar
ters that I should not stick to principles so
closely, but talk more about Mrs. Cooper.
I regarded it as a suffrage, not Cooper,
campaign, and continued to stick to prin
ciples. Notwithstanding Mrs. Sargent's
and Madame Sorbier's Genial, the fact re
mains that my refusal to conduct a Cooper
campaign was the cause of my requested
resignation.
"That is the general statement. Now,
to be more specific. As I visited the coun
ties I realized that addresses, np matter
how brilliant, were ephemeral in their ef
fects, and that matter in printed form, to
be studied and referred to, was the great
est need. I wrote the officers, urging that'
a systematic course of information on suf
frage matters should be provided and that
therefore the aid of the press, especially of
the interior, should be secured. I recom
mended the employment of some type
writers for the purpose of furnishing such
matter. I had found that the editors, al
most to a man, were willing to publish
such matter once a week.
"Instead of heeding my request the pow
ers ignored it, except to intimate through
the secretary that they did not want any
more suggestions. I continued to urge
that one, however, telling them that al
most daily I was the recipient of such ad
vice from business men and men of affairs
who were interested in the cause. The re
ply was that my resignation would be ac
cepted. I tendered it. That is the story
in rough outline, but there are countless
minor details. For instance I was taken
to task by Miss Cooper for accepting the
co-operation of a prominent lady in one
of the southern counties. 'Why did you
do it?' she asked. 'My mother doesn't like
her.'
"'I did not know that,' I replied
'but still do not regard that reason as a
final one. I will refer matters to your
mother as a member of the executive com
mittee when that committee meets. In
the meantime I must ask you to mind your
own business.'
"In short, the Coopers' motto is, 'Rule
or Ruin.' They have never belonged to
an organization in which they did not
make trouble because of their "adherence
to that motto."
The conversation turned upon Miss
Shaw. "It was not economy," said Mrs.
Harland, "to permit Miss Shaw to take
$1500 from the State with her, leaving us
without money to carry forward the cam
paign. My suggestion to the committee,
at the outset, was to stipulate the sum.
Miss Shaw asks for her lectures, $125 a
week. Mrs. Cooper protested that the
lady should receive $50 a lecture. I said it
would be impossible to raise this in some
of the country towns. She insisted that
Miss Shaw is the support of a large family.
This large family is a fiction. Miss Shaw's
father received a pension. Her nephews
and nieces, who, it was claimed, were de
pendent upon her, are all grown and self
supporting. She got her $50 a night,
however. Â° '
Here Mrs. Anna Smith interpolated a
vehement remark.
"I have spent a good deal of time hating
myself for ever believing that Miss
Anthony and Miss Shaw were working for
the cause of suffrage. It wasn't a pleasant
lesson, but I learned it well, that they are
working for the money there is in it I
am disillusioned. The bloom is gone from
the rose, the down from the peach. Miss
Shaw is one of the best orators of the age
She stands second to Ingersoll. But she

ABSOLUTELY, PURE
is the most grasping person I ever knew."
"The most ; brilliant, > and the most
greedy," agreed Mrs. Harland. "I trav
eled with her for six weeks, and I. never
saw her ' rapacity equaled. One town
failed to make up" the full amount required
for her lecture and, notwithstanding she
was receiving more than she had . been ac
customed - to, I she -'. accepted, and Mrs.
Cooper, insisted, enough from the associa
tion treasury to make up the deficit. She
would not donate so small a sum to the
fund.
"You all know, of course, that on the
night of the mass-meeting, when Judge
Maguire and Taylor Rogers spoke, she re
ceived $50 for a half-hour's talk? It is
true, and Mrs. Cooper insisted upon that.
"She and Miss Anthony carried away
$400 apiece, as well as having had all their
expenses paid, railroad fare and all, dur
ing the Woman's Congress," suggested
some one.
"To sum it all up,'-' said Mr 3. Harland,
"the campaign is entirely under tha con
trol of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, Miss Hattie
Cooper, Miss Elizabeth Sargent, who In
turn are directed by Miss Anthony and
Miss Shaw from their Eastern point of dis
advantage. Miss Anthony promptly sup
plied my place by sending on her niece,
also an Eastern woman."
Mrs. Smith remarked that the State or
ganizer's work could not be done effect
ively by any stranger. It should be the
province of a woman thoroughly in touch
with California sentiments and systems.
It was pointed out as a significant fact
that the attendance at the monthly open
meetings of the suffragists is very small.
"The spirit moved me to stay away and
I find I was wisely directed," remarked
one lady, dryly.
"The State Suffrage ' Association is like
the donkey that was shipped somewhere,
but his tag was lost and the poor donkey
didn't know where he was," said some one.
"And the constitutional campaign com
mittee has chewed off its tag," remarked a
hitherto silent listener.
Amid laughter and invitations to "call
soon" the ladies' conclave dissolved.
As two of the party wended their way to
ward Market street one remarked: "Mrs.
Harland is right. So long as the campaign
remains an interchange of ideas between
suffragists, as long as suffragists continue
to talk to suffragists, it will be as
effective as Don Quixote's onslaught upon
the windmill."
MORE FERRY FACILITIES
A New Gangway for the Broad
and Narrow Guage
Steamers.
Harbor Commissioners Will Build a
Shed Over the New Pacific-
Street Wharf.
The new upper-deck gangway for the
Oakland steamers was formally opened by
Harbor Commissioners Colnon, Cole and
Chad bourne yesterday afternoon. After
the regular meeting adjourned the mem
bers walked to the ferries and at 3:15 Chief
Engineer Holmes explained that every
thing was in readiness.
A few minutes later the steamer Pied
mont entered the slip, and when all the
passengers had left the boat President
Colnon gave the word and the gangway
was lowered. It acted perfectly, and when
the gates were thrown open the people
thronged in, many of them wondering
when they found themselves on the upper
deck of the steamer without any trouble.
Others were not at all sure but" that they
were on the wrong boat and the deckhands
were kept busy answering questions.
Everything passed off successfully and the
Commissioners pronounced the innovation
a complete success.
The old waiting-room used by the pas
sengers of both narrow and broad-guage
lines is entirely too limited in space, and
there was always great crowding and
squeezing on the trips from 4 to 6:30 p. m.
The upper-deck gangway gives two en
trances to the boat, and iv this way the
congestion is relieved. Chief Engineer
Holmes has made a great success of the
venture and many of the contrivances in
use are of his own invention.
Before adjourning to open the new
upper-deck gangway, the Commissioners
held their regular semi-weekly meeting.
The Labor Commissioner sent in a com
munication setting forth that his office
would be $2000 short this year, owing to
his having done an enormous amount of
gratuitous work. During the period men
tioned a free labor bureau had been main
tained which had secured employment
for 6000 men and women. Not a cent had
been charged for this work, and if the
charitable do not assist it cannot be car
ried on. Commissioner Chad bourne re
marked that State funds could not be do
nated and Commissioner Cole coincided
with him. - The matter was finally laid
over, but Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
is determined to try the Commissioners
individually.
The question of supplying the commis
sion with piles for repairing the various
wharves came up. Several bids were sent
in. but the work was let to Darby Leydon
& Co., as that firm offered better "facilities
for the handling of the lumber. Leydon
& Co.'s bid was, for 12-inch piles, 11 cents:
14-inch. 12Â»_ cents, and 15-inch, 13>_ cents'
per foot.
Dr. Peckham, the United States Quaran
tine Officer, stationed at Angel Island, ap
peared before the board and asked for a
stay of proceedings in regard to the charg
ing of wharfage for the docking of the
Sternberg. He explained that the steamer
might be put in commission for continuous
service shortly, and then the United States
Government would pay wharfage. As mat
ters are at present, however, the tug only
comes here once or twice a week, and there
is no appropriation for the wharfage
charges. The board decided to allow the
matter to lie in abeyance until Congress
shall make an appropriation to put the
Sternberg in commission.
Chief Wharfinger Root asked that a shed
be placed over the Pacific-street wharf,
which is now being completed. He pointed
out that there were not enough covered
wharves on the front and that during the
winter rains vessels were often detained
two weeks in discharging for. want of
sheds. Commissioner Chadbourhe was of
the opinion that the Oceanic Steamship
Company might want the wharf when it
was finished and if so a covering would be
absolutely necessary. Commissioner Cole
thought the wharf should be kept free in
order to accommodate the fruit vessels
when the season comes in. Just the same
a covering would be necessary. The chief
engineer was instructed to prepare plans
for a shed and at the meeting to-morrow
the matter will be settled.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1896.
"HATS OFF" TO
THE CATHODE SAY.
Professor George Davidson
Says That Is the
Thing to Do.
SOMETHING QUITE NEW.
If It Had Been Known at the
Time Garfield's Life Might
. Have Been Saved.
ITS WONDERFUL POSSIBILITIES
It May Let Us Look Into the Earth's
Surface and Discover It 3
Secrets.
"Before the cathode ray we must raise
our hats," said Professor George David
son, discussing the latest information
about the scientific marvel as presented in
The Call yesterday;
"It is something absolutely new to the
scientific world. It has sprung upon us
almost with that unexpectedness with
which sometimes the solid earth quakes
under our feet. To be sure there are
number of men whom we know to have
been close upon this discover}*, working
all about it, but not knowing what it, was
they saw. A number of men had theories
and some few were said to have really
been to the Western continent before
Columbus made his voyage. But Colum
bus got hereâ made it a reality. That is
what Roentgen has done with this new
vibrationâ whatever it may be.
"It is not well to talk about it yet. The
news has just been broken. If I "had been
working along physical lines I would take
it up and follow it. We cannot tell where
it may lead. From what we learn of it it
widens the scope of possible knowledge
immeasurablyâ of possible knowledge, you
understand. As I have said the news "has
just been broken, a very few experiments
have been made and they are all abso
lutely new to the world. ;
"What limitations the new thing may
i have we do not know. But it sets one
thinking that we may, by its aid, be en
abled after a while to look into the earth
and discover what is hidden there. Why
not? By taking the sun's light and break
ing it up with a spectroscope we know the
composition of the distant sun itself; here
is so much iron, here is so much salt, etc.
It is not safe to laugh, at things in these
days. There is so much that we do not
know. The longer I live and the more I
lind out the more I am inclined to stoop
with the weight of the knowledge that I
have not.
"Some one talks loud in the room ad-

joining here. I hear the words quite dis
tinctly. Sound is vibrations of the air. or
ether. Do the vibrations come through
that thick wall in their perfect continuity?
Do the walls vibrate? I lay my watch
on the end of a thick bar of "iron and put
my ear to the other end of it, twenty feet
away, and I distinctly hear its ticking; as
distinctly as though I held it to my ear?
Does the iron vibrate? What causes it?
"I have worked for sixteen and seven
teen hours a day almost all my life. I
spent eight hours at my office and nine
hours at my home making observations,
trusting to luck to get some sleep. As I
have sat at my telescope and noted what I
could of the millions and millions of stars,
the worlds that swing around us, of which
our earth is a little handful of dirt, and
wondered where was the beginning and
what the boundaries of it all, and realized
that no one could answer the question, I
learned to quit laughing at the strange
things I may hear in my day's walk.
"Ah! that's what's the matter. There
are more things in heaven and earth than
are dreamed of in our philosophy. To be
sure, that is as old as some of the stars.
We know some things. I can look at a
certain star to-night that, as I am looking
at it, will pass out of the line of my instru
ment. By a little figuring and some care
ful adjustment I can fix the glass to cover
that spot in the sky into which that star
will pass at a certain moment on a certain
night 100 years from now. The glass may
remain, and if some one go to it at the
moment I have nominatedâ l being long
dead and. perhaps, otherwise forgottenâ he
will seethe star cross the hairline on the
instant. There is no possibility of doubt,
no deviation. The great world will swing
into place exactly on time. But what
causes it? Ah! there's the rub. I cannot
tell. No man can tell what governs it all,
these millions and millions of worlds, with
such absolute nicety, y :
"But l<:ave your telescope and turn the
other wiyâ turn to earth. The revelations
of the microscope are as wonderful as
those of (he telescopeâ just as wonderful.
"They say there is nothing new under
th? sun. But that is such a lie that it
makes me laugh. Everything is newâ and
the Roentgen . or cathode ray is the very
latest. The whole world of science, work
ing along physical lines, is busy with it,
and we cannot tell what to-morrow may
bring forth. Glass is opaque jto the" new
ray. But it is altogether possible that a'
new substance will be discovered that will
focalize the light. 'Lenses would be made
of it and greater strength secured in the
shadowgraphs. Had this thing been
known when Garfield was shot his life !
would have been saved.'
"As I say, we have been on the verge of
this discovery j for several years. About
three years ago \ a half-dozen of us were
called upon by a newspaper to tell what
we had been doing during "i the preceding
yearâ what was new and interesting.
Among the replies a young Stanford pro
fessor said, 'I . have done this: I have
taken impressions of a coin on a sensitive
plate in a dark room by means of a wire
attached to it and to an electric battery.'
What was that? It was new, and it was
so close to this thing that there is scarcely
a dividing line. It seems he did not follow
it, and to Roentgen, as I have said, be
longs the credit of the discovery. I have
seen a man holding the cylinders of a bat
tery in his hands, the current . being so
gentle that he did not feci - it. A glass
tube from which the air was exhausted
was held two feet from his body and the
tube was brightly illuminated from this
current in the man's body, which he did
not feel. What caused the light?"
VISITED BY THE PRINCE.
Luigl of Savoy Called on Mayor Sutro
and Inspects tho City
Hall.
Prince Luigi of Savoy returned the visit
made by Mayor Sutro to the Italian
cruiser Cristoforo Colombo a few days ago,
by calling on the chief executive at his
offices in the City Hall yesterday.
The Mayor was taken by surprise when
the noble Italian entered his sanctum
escorted by Captain Bertolini, his superior
officer on board the warship, but soon re
covered his equanimity sufficiently to
show the Prince the pictures of his prede
cessors, which hang about the walls of the
office.. y^'-y
When the Prince had tired of this diver
sion his host donned his white hat and
taking his gold-headed cane escorted his
royal visitor about the hall, showing him
the different departments and explaining
as well as he could, through an interpreter,
the antics of the various officials.
The hall was explored from dome to
cellar and the Prince, who was dressed in
a dark suit and Derby hat, expressed him
self as much pleased with what he had
seen. y; -;/>,
A BIG ELK IN BRONZE.
An Oakland Monument Modeled
After the Animal in the
Park.
Made by Whyte & De Rome and to
Be Mounted in Mountain View
Cemetery.
The only bronze elk modeled from life
in California has just been finished by
Messrs. Whyte & De Rome at their brass
foundry on Main street.
It was made at the order of Oakland
Lodge No. 171 of Elks, and is to be used as
a monument in their burial plat in Moun
tain View Cemetery. The statuary is one
of the handsomest of its kind ever cast,
and differs widely in appearance and fin
ish from, the- combination white metal
monstrosities sent out here from the East.
Frank Happersberger, the sculptor, took
for his model the father elk at Golden
Gate Park. This famous antlered animal
is called the father elk, because of his hav
ing been the first elk transferred from his
native wilds to that edenic garden called
Golden Gate Park. The model was made
four years ago, and "father elk" is a little
larger now and more dignified, as becomes
his age, but the likeness between the liv-
ing animal and his bronze replica is strik
ing. "â .r : - ;
It was first intended to mount the elk on
a pedestal of the Lick memorial statuary,
but it was decided to substitute something
emblematic of the State's developing com
mercial and agricultural industries. The
sculptor's model was therefore laid aside
until a few months ago when E. H.
Benjamin of the Oakland Lodge of Elks
called on the sculptor and ordered the cast
made.' â¢ â â¢'.-â  y.yy
Mr. Benjamin had charge of the mining
exhibit at the Midwinter Fair. When the
fair closed he was given the marble and
onyx pedestal on which the principal por
tion of the exhibit rested. The base is of
Inyo marble with an onyx coping. He in
turn presented it to the Oakland Lodge of
Elks on condition that it be placed in the
burial plat called "Elks' Rest" in the
Mountain View Cemetery.
The cast is life-size, and the pose is true
to life of that of the model when standing
by the paling surrounding his keep and
gazing with inquiring eyes at the visitors
in the park.
. The makers of the statuary declined to
tell the cost of the work, but informed the
reporter that under ordinary circumstances
it would require $2000 or $2500 to produce a
similar casting, in bronze. It "probably
costless, because the model was already
made. 1

addressed the meeting.
A Frivolous Appeal.
Dwight Younglove secured judgment against
James F. Cunningham upon a promissory note
and Cunningham appealed; on the ground that
a demurrer to the original complaint should
have been sustained. The demurrer was made
upon the single point I that there was no aver
ment in the complaint of a' consideration for
tne^. note. The Supreme Court says there is
aa a IK whatever in the point, and $100 is
added to the costs allowed respondent as a
penalty for a frivolous appeal.
TO BE A CAMPAIGN ISSUE
How the Union for Practical
Progress Will Work for
City Water.
WILL PLEDGE CANDIDATES.
Immediate Action by the Board of
Supervisors on the Water Petition
Looked For.
"Xo movement like ours was ever lost,"
said J. M. Reynolds of the Union for
Practical Progress yesterday. "When a
city or town starts out to get a municipal
water supply she gets itâ that is history.
We expect the Supervisors to take some
action on the petition asking that the
people of this City be permitted to vote
on this question of issuing bonds for a
water system. We are not, of course, over
sanguine that the Supervisors will grant
the request, though I rather think they
will. It is certainly a very reasonable re
quest, and it ! seems to me that those who
are inclined not even to let the people ex
press their opinions on the question must
have. Spring Valley reasons for their atti
tuue.
"Of course, if the question is left to the
people it will be overwhelmingly carried â
it always is.
"But suppose the Supervisors do not
permit the question to be placed on the
official ballot and the people are thus pre
vented from voting on the proposition.
What then Why, we will make it a clear
cut issue of the campaign. How can that
be done? In many ways. We will pledge
the candidates for Supervisors to support
such a measure after election, or will vote
them down.
"Not enough of us to do that? You
don't know the feeling there is on the sub
ject in this City. By scarcely turning a
hand, and without the expenditure of a
single dollar, we secured 3000 signatures
of voters and home-owners and house
holders to our petition to the Board of Su
pervisors, and every signer was a voter.
"Only a moderate effort is needed to
focus and concentrate the feeling on the
water question in this City. That effort
will be made in the coming campaign by
the Union for Practical Progress if the
present Supervisors deny our most reason
able request.
"The Spring Valley tax is enormous, and
the people know it. Their profits are also
enormous, and the people know that as
well. A municipal water system means
greatly reduced taxes, and reduced tax
rates would bring manufactures and many
enterprises to this City. Our individual
water rate is much too high, and what the
City has to pay each year to the Spring
Valley Company is enormously above the
value returned. Both are manyfold greater
than they would be if San Francisco owned
her own water system. The savings would
amount to more than a million dollars a
year. ty'y"',-"
"Now, the best of all this is that the
people Know it all. They are quite wide
awake to the importance of tne question,
and any one who thinks the people of this
City are at all apathetic on the question
will be surprised at the result of a little
investigation.
"You can be very sure that the water
question will be a big issue in the next
municipal campaign if the present Board
of Supervisors refuse our petition to place
the matter before the people in the way
provided by law, and that it will not be a
dead issue by any means.
"No; I do not think the Union for Prac
tical Progress will favor an independent
municipal ticket for this purpose alone. I
think it will be better to work upon the
material afforded us by the existing par
ties. We will go to their supervisoral can
didates and request them to sign our
water-works pledge.
"The names of those who sign will be
indorsed by the Union and their election
advocated. We won't rest there. We will
go on ana defeat those who refuse to sign
the pledge. We will carry on an active
campaign for that one purpose, and we
will prepare such a straightforward and
simple pledge that those who sign it will
not dare to break it when the time comes
for action. Ob, we are not fearing for the
success of the municipal : water system
plan. That is coming very surely and not
so slowly as some people would like to
have it and those who do not know what
keen interest is taken in it think it will."
WILL USE NATIVE STONE
Sculptor Marlon Wells Must Finish the
City Hall Statue Within
Two Weeks.
Unless F. Marion Wells, the sculptor
who was given the contract to furnish the
statue to surmount the dome of the City
Hall, finish his work within two weeks he
will be taxed $50 by the City Hall Com
missioners for every day that he delays be
yond that time.
When the sculptor asked for an exten
sion yesterday, both Auditor Broderick
and City and County Attorney Creswell
rose in their wrath and declared that they
were tired of delay, and would insist on
the work being finished at once. Finally
however, they were prevailed upon to
grant two weeks on the conditions named.
The floor of the dome then came in for
discussion, and City and' County Attorney
Creswell proposed that the accepted de
sign of a.star be changed to a bear, out his
ideas did not suit the Auditor, and the
original plan was adhered to.
The wainscoting of the dome was dis
cussed at length, and it was decided to use
only California material in spite of , the
fact that Eastern stone could be procured
at a cheaper rate. The matter of selecting
the stone was left in the hands of Archi
tect Shea. .- ,
CALIFORNIA-MADE ROPE.
A Demand That the Harbor Commis
sioners Use It on All State Boats.
The officers of i the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association recently discov
ered that the rope and cordage used on the
State tugs and dredgers are of Eastern
make. In order to have the money spent
for these necessaries expended in this
State the following letter was written yes
terday:
To the Honorable the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners Gentlemen:. Information has
reached this otlice that the rope used on the
State dredgers, tugs, etc., which is purchased
by your honorable board is of Eastern manu
facture, and we would therefore call your at
tention to the fact that there is manufactured
in California rope of as good quality, guaran
teed, as is manufactured- anywhere in the
United States, and at equally low, if not lower,
prices. An investigation of the relative merits
of rope manufactured in * California and rope
manufactured In the Eastern Stages we are
certain will prove to your entire satisfaction
that the California article is at least equal in
both quality and price, and jwe believe that
when you are satisfied that such is the case
there will be no : more purchases of Eastern
made rope by, your honorable board. We
would, therefore, most respectfully ' request
that you do investigate the matter, and if you
find that California rope is manufactured ea'ual
in quality and price with the Eastern-made
article we beg that you will give the prefer
ence to the California manufacture, thus help
ing to foster and build up one of the industries
of California and keeping in circulation at
home moneys ; that would otherwise go East.

STREETCAR TRANSFERS
The Merchants' Association Re
plies to Manager Vining's
Refusal.
An Unkept Pledge Relative to Carry
ing Passengers on Kearny
Street.
The Merchants' Association is anything
but pleased with the action of the Market
street Cable Company in refusing to com
ply with the request to issue transfers at
certain points along its lines. The mer
chants are particularly desirous of having
transfers issued to and from the Kearny
street electric line to cars running to the
Mission.
Several months ago the Merchants' As
sociation sent a special committee consist
ing of A. S. Baldwin, C. A. Benedict, S.
W. Dixon, F. W. Dohrmann, John Farn
ham, A. S. Hallidie, H. Hart, H. D. Keil,
M. S. Kohlberg. Frank Maskey, Frank A.
Swain, H. Taylor, George "D. Toy, W.
G. Doane and J. Richard Freud (secretary)
to interview General Manager E. P. Vin
ing. At that interview the committee
made Known the requests of the associa
tion, which voiced the wishes of every
merchant on Kearny street and every resi
dent at North Beach. Mr. Vining raised
the objection that the issuance of transfers
is already sadly abused by the public
through the traffic in passes at the present
terminal points. He suggested that the
association cause the Supervisors to pass a
law making the traffic in transfers illegal.
In oraer to gain time Mr. Vining asked
that the committee present its request in
: writing, which was none a week later. On
the 12th inst. > the general manager
answered the letter at length, giving rea
sons and excuses why the request could
not be complied with. As stated, the re
fusal did not please the members of the
association, and as an invitation was ex
tended by Vining to further continue the
discussion of the matter the special com
mittee did not let the subject drop.
Yesterday morning the committee met
and all were present except Mr. Doane.
Mr. Vining's letter of refusal was carefully
considered and the following answer
made, which was forwarded at once:
San Francisco. Feb. 18, 1896.
E. P. Vining, Esq., General Manager Market-
Street Hail-way Companyâ Dear Sir: Your reply
of the 12th inst. to our communication of the
20th ult. addressed to the board of directors
of the Market-street Railway 'Company rela
tive to streetcar transfers has been received,
and its contents carefully noted.
We fully agree with you, as to the superior
advantages afforded by the excellent street
car transfer system of San Francisco: and we
believe that: its benefits are appreciated by
this community. Furthermore, it is indis
putable that the traffic in transfers is not only
wrong in principle, but also demoralizing iv
its effects. Tnis illegitimate traffic should cer
tainly be stopped. â¢
The main point, however, in our communi
cation was that in granting transfer privileges
no special discrimination should exist against
Kearny street. We respectfully contend that
similar transfer privileges should be given to
the patrons of the Kearny-street electric lines
as are now enjoyed on parallel lines. It does
not seem equitable, even under existing con
ditions, that Kearny street, which heretofore
has been the leading retail business street
of this City, should now be entirely deprived
of transfer privileges. Nor do we think that
it such transfer privileges were granted to
Kearny street- it would materially aggravate
the consequences of the traffic in transfers of
which you rightfully complain. '
At any rate we feel that the Market-street
Railway Company should at least restore the
transfer privilege from the Mission to North
Beach and vice versa, that existed before the
electric line was introduced. It is stated by
one of our members, Mr. Frank Maskey, that
definite promises were made to him by parties
claiming to represent your company that the
transfer privilege would be continued on
Kearny street, provided; the electric system
was allowed on that street. Thereupon lie
and others assisted in- securing the consent of
the . property-owners .. and ; merchants along
Kearny street to the proposed change in the
car system upon that thoroughfare, and the
restraining injunction was xhsu withdrawn.
If such premises were made by parties un
authorized by your company the fact still re
mains that such assurances were naturally
implied that the previous transfer system
would be continued on Kearny street when
the change to the electric line was completed.
When lines operating from Kearny up to
Pacific and Broadway to Mason, along Mason
to Xorth Beach, were stopped and a material
saving was effected thereby, the transfer priv
ileges, which were previously enjoyed by the
locality in question and which had become, as
it were, part of the value of the property and
of the business houses on this street, were
taken away without explanation or compensa
tion therefor. Under these circumstance* we
are firmly convinced that your company
should at once restore to Kearny street the
transfer privileges both ways from the Mission
to Xorth Beach, as previously enjoyed by that
â¢thoroughfare.
With reference to the other transfers men
tioned in our communication we will be glad
to confer with you further, and in that con
nection assist in having the traffic in transfers
legally abolished.
The following statement appears in your
communication : "Viewed from our standpoint,
this proposition Involves the unfortunate
feature of placing this company under a per
petual obligation to grant year after year cer
tain concessions of a nature which have not
been imposed upon any street-railway com
pany anywhere, by the laws of this community
or any other, and this notwithstanding the
fact that experience may prove these conces
sions to be exceedingly disastrous to our inter
ests." We cannot understand how you arrive
at the conclusions stated in the foregoing
paragraph. It is not clear to us how it follows
from the simple proposition submitted in our
communication that your company will be
placed "under a perpetual obligation to grant
certain concessions year after year." . .
We should like very much to have this ex
plained to us, as well as your assertion that
the request in our communication for transfer
privileges heretofore existing along Kearny
street will bind your company perpetually
and irretrievably to a policy the results of
which are so uncertain.
WELL-KNOWN TEACHER DEAD.
Passing of One of the Most Valued
Instructors in the Department.
Miss Theresa Almira Flint, who for
thirty years past has been one of the most
valued employes of the School Depart
ment, died on Monday after an illness of
some duration. During almost her entire
connection with the department Miss
Flint was in charge of classes in the Den
man School, where she displayed rare
talents.
Few teachers in the schools enjoyed the
confidence of the Board of Education to a
greater extent than did Miss Flint, and
her death is mourned by a large circle of
friends and acquaintances.
