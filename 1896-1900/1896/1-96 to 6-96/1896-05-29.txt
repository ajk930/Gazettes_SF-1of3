PROPERTY FROM THIEVES.
Latest Reports Indicate That the Death-Roll Is
Appalling, While Thousands Are Homeless
and in Dire Need of Aid.
CHICAGO, 111., May 29.â Reports received up till 2 A. M. by the'
United Press indicate a loss of 500 lives at East St. Louis, with the
death roll greater in the Missouri city by 50 to 75. The number of in
jured in the two cities will be found to be near 1500, judging by the!
names already reported. Nearly 100 injured persons were reported]
by their physicians as fatally or internally injured in St. Louis. These !
victims went or were taken to their homes and were not in the police
records. The number of identified dead in St. Louis within the police
observation is 123, in East St. Louis 168, and 20 persons reported j
missing in the city on this side are put in the death column. Many of
the injured in both cities will die. Hundreds have already been re< j
corded. From 500 to 800 East St. Louis people are homeless and in
dire need.
The loss of property in St. Louis is reliably estimated at $4,000,
-000, and in the Illinois city at $'2,000,000, with much higher estimates
from other sources. The work of distributing relief money has already
begun.
In other Illinois and Missouri cities the extent of the storm's work
is still in doubt because of the broken telegraphic communications. It I
is known that the storm touched Breckenridge, Pickneyville, Irving
ton, Richview, Drake, New Baden, New Minden, 111., and Rush Hill,
Mo. Many lives are reported to have been lost in those places, but
confirmatory news is lacking as to the fatalities. -
Additional dispatches from Indiana show the fury of the ele
ments was not dissipated until Albany, Benton and Pi inceton
had been attacked, doing great damage to property by wind and
water. Crops were destroyed in the surrounding country.
The Governor of Illinois is on the woeful scene at East St. Louis,
and two con? canies of the National Guard are on duty to prevent
pillage and keep order among the lawlessly inclined. A call for
help has gone forth from the stricken Illinois city. Both cities are
practically in darkness to-night, except in the business center, while
the work of recovering the dead from the wreck of buildings is prose
cuted under difficulties.

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, MAY 29, 1896.
MAP OF THE SECTION OF COUNTRY WHICH HAS BEEN VISITED BY CYCLONES
. DURING THE PAST TWO WEEKS.
The first disaster was reported at eherman, Texas, on May 15, and the storm was central in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma.
Two days later there was a tornado in Northeastern Kansas. On the 24th of May the region near Dcs Moines, lowa, was devastated,
and the storm was reported central in the Dakotas. The following day a tornado burst more than 600 miles to the westward at Orten
ville, Mich., and the Weather Bureau reported the storm center near the shores of Lake Superior. Two days afterward the great, green
cloud which brought death and destruction to St. Louis and vicinity rushed down from the northward. The storm moved in a trough
like depression, extending from Minnesota to Kansas. The map was prepared and the location oi the tornadoes noted for "The Call" by
Mr. W. H. Hararaon, local forecast official in charge of 'he Weather Bureau in San Francisco.
gong is heard in the distance, and vehicles
and streetcars come to a stop while an
ambulance dashes by to add one more
victim to the record of the dead. The
streets in the center of the city, usually
alive with pedestrians until midnight, are
deserted, save for those whoae avocations
keep them from their families or friends,
while the summer gardens and other
points of entertainment are bare of pa
trons. Grief, mourning and stupefaction
have taken possession of the city.
Careful tabulations of the information
gathered by the United Press from all
official sources show that at 8 o'clock to
nignt there were 114 victims that had been
identified, while fifteen still await identifi
cation. Most of the bodies claimed have
been removed to their late homes. The
number of missing, the majority sup
posedly being in the ruins of industrial
establishments and residences that were
totally demolished, is variously estimated
at from fifty to 600. Only a complete
search of the acres of ruins can tell the
true story, for the people in the stricken
region seem utterly unable to talk co
herently.
Men and women reported as among the
missing are continually putting in an ap
pearance, while on the other band many
believed to be safe turn out to be among
the missing. In the matter of age the
dead range irom a male baby of S months
to a great-greav-grandinotherof 92 years.
The number of injured reported to
police headquarters to the same hour foots
up 189. Of these five are unconscious and
unknown, having nothing upon them by
which they can be identified. The in
juries range from slight cuts and con
tusions to one unfortunate who is reported
as having sustained the loss of both eyes
and the fracture of skull, both arms and
legs and ribs. Of the list of injured, which
is about one-fourth of the probable total,
the overwhelming majority of those
caught in the tornado having found their
way to their homes and thus escaped the
| official reports, nearly 100 are reported by
the physicians in attendance as "fatally
injured" or "injured Internally,' 1 which
is practically the same thing. These
figures relate to the city proper.
On the other side of the river, in East
St. Louis, 111., where the elements gath
ered themselves together for a supreme ef
fort toward destruction of life and proper
ty, the latest report* to the United Press
place the total of deaths and missing at
205 and the injured at seventy-one.
Another tabulation, made this evening
by the St. Louis Chronicle, gives these fig
ures: Identified dead in St. Louis, 121;
unidentified, 60; injured, 447.
East St. Louis: Identified dead, 129;
unidentified dead, 125; injured, 158.
The total number of families who were
without homes and whose every article of
household effects was swept away by the
storm, is variously estimated at from 500
to 800. It will be several days before a
complete and reliable roster can be made.
Estimates on local losses are so wild that
it is impossible to give any authentic fig
ures. One good authority places them, at
$15,000,000; another equally good at $4,000,
-000. The latter is probably more correct.
At East St. Louis $2,000,000 is regarded by
Mayor Bader as a conservative estimate.
STATE TROOPS CALLED OUT.
Thieves Take Advantage of East St.
Louis' Disaster.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 28.â Almost a reign
of terror prevails in East St. Louis to
nieht. Save for a tug and a few rowboats
placed at the service of officials, physi
cians, newspapermen and others whose
duties called them to the scene, the place
has been cut off from communication with
this city since last night, a section of the
upper, or railroad portion, of the Eads
bridge having been carried away, while
guards were stationed at either end to pre
vent pedestrians from using the footbridge.
The thieves and toughs of the city, how
ever, re-enforced by scores from the sur
rounding country, started in this after
noon to pillage the overturned trucks in
the streets and the freight cars on the
sidings, which were filled with valuable
merchandise, groceries and provisions.
The small police force had been de
detailed to aid the injured and assist in
the task of searching the ruins, and r&aliz
ing that they were powerless to preserve
â¢order or prevent the pillaging, Mayor
Bader called upon Governor Altgeld for
aid. He quickly responded by ordering
two companies of malitia to the scene.
The first company arrived from Belleville
at 9 o'clock, and the second is en route
from Greenville on a special train and will
be on the ground at 1 a. m.
The Governor himself arrived late to
night and directed the detailing of the
troops about the various properties to be
protected.
Prior to bis arrival a meeting of leadlne
citizens was held in the First National
Bank building in response to a call hur
riedly issued by ex-Congressman W. 8.
Forman and others, and after a full dis
cussion of the situation it was decided to
issue the following appeal, and the -United
Press was requested to give it circulation :
To the People of the United States: The city of
East St. Louis has been visited by one of the
most terrible and destructive tornadoes in the
history of tbe country. As a result of Its fear
ful work at least 200 lives have been lost,
while the number of maimed and wounded
we are unable as yet to estimate, but it will
probably run into the thousands.
The amount of damage to property is very
great and it it impossible at this time to ascer
tain, but it is safe to say that at least 600 fami
lies are rendered homeless. A great number
of these must depend upon charity for shelter.
While tbe loss appears to fall upon the poorer
classes of people, almost every citizen has di
rectly or indirectly suflered damage.
While we regret exceedingly to call upon
the country at large in this extremity, we feel
utterly unable to supply tbe absolute necessi
ties of these afflicted people, although our own
citizens are putting forth every effort and are
contributing as liberally and indeed more lib
erally than their means allow.
We therefore appeal to the generosity of our
sister cities and other communities for help in
this our hour of trouble. We will be pleased
to receive subscriptions and assistance in any
form which may be deemed advisable.

In addition to the injured in the two
schoolhouses there are ninety-four maimed
women, children and men in St. Mary's
Hospital. Women and girls from the
farms of tbe surrounding country poured
into the city in droves this evening and
afternoon, with bundles of old linen, cloth
ing and other necessaries, and proffered
their services as nurses. The good samari
tans were badly needed by the hospital
people and city authorities, and nearly
every victim in the public or extemporized
hospitals has an individual attendant to

NOT THE CRIME OF A LTJNATia
Deliberate Plans Made by the Brutal
Husband to Annihilate the
Family.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 28.â James Dun
ham, the author of Tuesday's remarkable
crime at Campbells, whose six victims
will be buried to-morrow, has been seen
on the road to Mount Hamilton and a
Sheriff's posse is close on his trail at mid
night to-night.
He was seen shortly after 6 o'clock by
two men climbing the mountain trail
about half a mile above Smiths Greet
Hotel.
He was at the time some distance of! the
main road from San Jose to Mount Ham
ilton by Oscar S. Parker and Everett Snell,
two men who were descending the moun
tain. Dunham was going up. Snell knows
the murderer very well, as he (Dunham)
worked for him at one time. Tney stopped
and chatted for some minutes. Snell ad
dressed Dunham as he came up, say
ing, "Hello, what are you doing up
here?" to which Dunham made answer:
"Oh, I'm just traveling." The mur
derer bore the appearance of having seen
a hard experience. His horse had no sad
dle and looked very tired. Dunham's face
was badly scratched and his feet were
bound up in gunnysacks, for all of which
he gave no explanation.
He became quite chatty. Throwing his
leg over the side of Mb tired animal, he said
that he had been without food for two days,
as he had been off the roads and could eet
nothing, that he had the night before
broken into a cabin some distance back
and taken a piece of bacon. He had also
searched the cabin for ammunition, he
said. Parker said the cabin referred to
waa his own. and asked Dunaam to return
and stay over night*.
Dunham declined, saying he wanted to
get through on the trail that night. He
said he was going over the summit of
Mount Hamilton. He carried a sack
which it was supposed contained some
provisions and a hatchet which he uses to
cut through barbed-wire fences or other
obstructions.
Snell and Parker knew the story of tha
crime that has made Dunham a fleeing
outcast. Had he accepted their invitation
it was their intention to attempt his cap
ture. As it was they were unarmed and
did not attempt to delay him. They went
at once to the Smith Creek hotel and tele*
phoned to Sheriff Lyndon in this city.
Two other men, Louis Bosques and
Frank Vincant, saw Dunham half a mile
further along the trail than Snell and Par
ker had been. They merely spoke and
passed on. They immediately set about
arousing the neighborhood and starting in
pursuit.
They followed the trail, but did not
again encounter the murderer so far as
heard from. They are not seeking a per
sonal meetine over diligently, however,
as they are not armed. They simply want
to keep track of him.
The telephone message from Smith's
was received at the Sheriff's offic about 7
o'clock this evening, and it created a lively
time for the next hour or so. Sheriff Lyn
don, with Sheriff Ballou of San Luis
Obispo, had already stared with Ballou's
blood hounds for the McGlincy ranch,
there to start the hounds on the trail.
Word was sent to them and they imme
diately returned and reorganized their ex
pedition to take to the mountains. They
left here about 8 o'clock in a wagon with a
small train of private rigs with as many
parties of adventurers. A great crowd
gathered about the Courthouse while the
preparations were going on, and as the
train of vehicles drove out at a smart trot
it was followed by the cheers of the
people.
Tbe Sheriff's party consisted, besides
Lyndon and Ballou, of Deputies Kennedy,
Reynolds and Hayden, Constables Haley
and Harny. and McClintock, Matt Cos
china, Al hanks. Charles Simmons and
a party of newspaper correspondents.
Deputy Sheriff Hayden and Constable
Haley are soing up the trajl to Kincaids,
beyond Smiths Creek.
It is not now thought that they can ef
fect a capture to-night, but they are cer
tain now that he cannot eiude them,
especially with the hounds after him.
Parker, who has charge of Bob Morrow's
place in the mountains, says he believes
that Dunham will not make much resist
ance when overtaken, as he seemed tired2
and disheartened. He says he carried no
guns in sijiht. News from the vicinity of
bmith's is being anxiously awaited at
every minute.
WAS CALMLY PLANNED.
Madness Did Not Cause Dunham's
Fearful Crime.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 28.â The theory
of madness or sudden impulse must be
dismissed from consideration of the bloody
business at Campbells on Tuesday night.
The developments of to-day, linked with
the facts previously known, leave no doubt
that this unique horror had been worked
out in its terrible detail through days of
dark thinking.
Dunham had determined upon his deed
on Monday morning and his plans for the
awful execution were no niora carefully
laid than were those for his escape. The
lack of motive disappears under the steady
course of investigation, and it becomes
clear that this terrible deed was that of a
moody, bitter, mean, self-centered nature
that could find in some slight from his
wife or members of her family reason suf
ficient to him for blotting them all out of
existence.
With proof of this premeditation cer
tain features of the crime that were lightly
passed over in the first inventory as being
impossible of meaning what they seemed
rise to # first importance and lift this crime
far out of the ordinary in mere blood car
nivals. That note that was found on the
table in Mrs. Dunham's room is the chief
of these. At first it looked like a mere
cheap trick of the murdererâ a forgery to
give the appearance of suicide to her death,
when, perhaps, it was in his mind only to
kill his wife.
With two loaded revolvers, a rifle
and an ax, made ready to the
murderer's hand, that it was his
purpose to do what he did, at least so far
as the members of the McGlincy family
are concerned, cannot be in doubt.
And when it is learned, as it v,as to-day
at the inquest, that the most bitter hatred
existed between Dunham and the whole
McGlincy family, taken in connection
with the silent and morose character of
the man, the motive is furnished. The
story, then, that is told by that little note
that was found on the stand near the mur
dered wife's bed is nothing less than tre
mendous.
It is written on the reverse side of a
large yellow business card of a wine com
pany. It is in the wife's handwriting, as
testified to by those who knew it. It is
written in lead pencil, and then is blurred
as though a hand had been drawn across
it in an attempt to erase it.
When James Dunham, the silent, dark,
stern man, entered his wife's room with
liis big ax he told his wife that he had
come to kill her.
He had often said he would do so and
she knew from the terrible purpose that
bounded in his low voice and looked out of
hia calm eyes that he meant what he said.
He may have placed the gag in her moutn
that was found there after death. 60 he
may have restrained her from crying out
even at that moment by the mere exercise
of that power which he is known to have
had over her will.
He told her that if she had any prepara
tions to make for death to make them and
be quick. She rose up in her bed ana
wrote that line upon the card. He thought
ehe might have offered a prayer instead of
writing a note that could never be deliv
ered and that may explain why a hand
was drawn across, blurring it. Then he
tightened his fingers about her throat and
shook the feeble body so savagely that the
neck was broken.
The body fell back quite still, but he
must make certain. He thrust some cloths
down the throat so that it would be impos
sible that the breath of life should re
enter it.
The trapedy of Othello had been re
enacted. The frightful night's work that
he bad laid to his hand had been entered
upon. The light had been put out. But
in the modern edition this was a mere be
ginning. Five others were to follow this
spirit into the unknown country in quick
succession. There would be a whole fam
ily of them together. â¢
The lights that have been turned upon
the character of James Dunham since that
Tuesday nieht gave the background to
this Dicture that is necessary to it to make
it understood. As at first presented it
seemed the ghastly work of a maniac Its
ruthless and unnecessary slaughter could
not be fitted to any othT reasoning. Now,
however, we have a man with a past â a
man who had been married twice, who bad
deserted two wives scarcely before the hon
eymoon in each case was over, a man who
had turned his band at many unprofitless
trades, who has been a cowboy in Texas
and is as expert with the revolver as he is
an experienced and hardy horseman. He
had traveled the roads from Oregon to
Ban Diego and knows them perfectly. He
had been seen in these immediate parts
where lived his brother and bister but lit
tle. His mother and father having died
be returns and secures his share of a mod
erate fortune.
His brother Charles, several -. years
younger than himself, is engaged to marry
the daughter of Colonel R. P. McGlincy, a
prominent citizen, rancher, orchardist
and politician. Dunham seeks and se
cures employment from McGlincy and,
employing his opportunity, lays siege to
the heart of his brother's fiancee and wins
her. Then for the first time he takes on
the role of a gentleman.
At 30 years of age he enters Santa Clara
College to take the full four years' clas
sical course with the purpose of afterward
studying law. He is reported as a model
student, polite, punctnal and hard work
ing in a class where the pupils were half
his age. Rev. Father McKenna says of
him :
"He was in a degree irreproachable. He
was always very polite, and would bow to
those with whom he was acquainted, but
he very seldom showed a disposition to
talt to any one, Â«nd he seemed to be a
very hard person to become very well ac
quainted with. He was, I might say, a
silent man. He rarely, if ever, smiled, and
bad what might be called a far-away ex
pression."
Just so he was to all others with whom
he had and proposed to have no close
relationship. At home the hard, ugly side
of his character had long been revealed to
his young wife. He was more than mean
to her. Her jewelry was stolen while they
lived in Sacramento and she suspected
him as being the thief. He taunted her
in those ways that are most aggravating â
charged her parents with th-> com mission
of disgraceful crimes and brought about
an open warfare with all others of her
family.
When she was sick he entirely neglected
her. Did she want any comfort such as
he mieht secure her he told her not to
bother him, but to get what she wanted
from her parents: and they had been
married but little more than a year. The
love letters written to her by his brother
were still among her treasures. Four days
after l.is baby was born he lifted the little
body up in his hands and leaning over his
wife's sick bed he said:
"Do you know what I intend to do Tvith
this? lam going to Texas pretty soon to
open a saloon and gambling-house; lam
going to take this boy with me, and I am
going to teach him to be a Catholic, too."
GEORGE SUAIBLE.
Sheriff J. H. Lyndon of Santa Clara County, Who Leads the Pursuit of Dunham
the Sextuple Murderer.
She and all the family were strong ad
herents of the A. P. A., and Dunham him
self was not a Catholic, but be knew bow
to torture. This was the model Ftudent
and polite gentleman of the Santa Clara
College. He was even then and bad long
been contemplating the wiping from the
earth all of the McGlincy family.
On Monday Dunham drew out what
coin he had in the San Jose bank, some
thing over $1000. On Tuesday evening he
hid his bycycle in the bushes near the Dry
Creek bed, some few hundred yards from
the house. He loaded two revolvers, a 33
and a 45- caliber â he always carried one.
He loaded a rifle and these with the ax he
took to the house and that night wallowed
in the blood of six people.
One that he had counted upon got away
and that fact left him unsatisfied. The
orchard and grounds about the house are
marked with the trail of his horse as he
rode back and forth along the fences and
around the house and over in the direction
of the neighbors' houses in his searoh for
George Schaible, the frightened hired man,
who was hiding under tho hay in the loft
ot the barn.
With the place etrewn with dead he
could scarcely bring himself to leave the
scene, because there was one survivor that
he felt sure was concealed there. He
wanted them all. At last he turned his
horse into the Los Gatos read, looked back

once more upon the scene of the slaugh
ter, and George Schaible saw him ride
away over the moonlit road toward San
Jose and felt that he was safe.
Charley Sterrett met him where the
road rises out of Dry Creek, and the on
sated monster stopped him, saying:
"Have you seen George?' 1
The baby boy, the only survivor of this
sweep of death, is being cared for by Mrs.
Black, a neighbor of the desolated place.
The place is visited by great numbers of
people, who come and go in constant pro
cession over the county roads from all di
rections. *
Jri the meantime the guessing goes on as
to the prospects of the murderer getting
safely away.
The bodies of the victims, all save Min
nie Schessler, still lie in the house, hav
ing been embalmed. The funeral will take
piace to-morrow afternoon, and it will, no
doubt, call out a great portion of the popu
lation of the Campbell district.
The inquest was resumed in the house
of the dead this morning. The most im
portant witness was Mrs. H. M. Parker,
who was the nurse at the house at the
time the Dunham baby was born.
She was there for thirteen days and saw
enough of Dunham's ill-treatment of his
\ wife to shock her. She said that Mrs.
j Dunham told her of her loss of her jewelry
and how she had every reason to believe
that her husband stole it. One day Dun
ham waÂ» taunting his wife about her
father, old man Welis, telling her he knew
him to be a sheepthief.
This so angered the wife that she then
and there charged him with having stolen
her watch. He only laughed at her. The
j Bick wife was in great need of a piece of
mosquito netting, and she (the nurse)
begged him to get it for her. He made no
reply, but the next day came home with
out it. She again reminded him, and he
again paid no attention whatever. When
the wife herself asked Dunham to do
anything for her he replied by telling her
to have her father wait upon her, as he
would not.
Dunham, said the witness, seemed to
take some interest in the baby â even
showed some affection for it â and would
lie on the bed and watch it for long
periods. Several times when the nurse
offered it to him Dunham would take it
in his hands and hold it. It was upon
one of these occasions that Dunham
leaned over his wife and shocked her into
hysterics by saying:
"Do you know what I intend to do with
this youngster? I intend to take him with
me to Texas pretty soon, where 1 shall
open a whisky-shop and gambling den. I
mean to teach him, too, in the Catholic
religion."
With agony in her face and in her voice
she turned to the nurse, saying:
"What do you think of a man who will
say such a thing to his wife at such a
time?" and Dunham smiled as though
much pleased at his success.
George Schaible, the man who escaped,
was recalled, and testified that Dunham
had two bicycles and one was broken, and
he had spent some time Monday morning
repairing it.
He did not see Dunham on the farm on
Monday nor on Tuesday, before 8 o'clock
in the evening. He came home at that
time. He did not notice anything in his
appearance or conduct that was notable at
that time.
F. E. Lovelady testified to having seen
and heard two men going by his house
toward McGlincy's Tuesday evening. One
of them he knew was Dunham'. He knew
Dunham very well ana always estimated
him as a very cool and calm man.
Robert Hamilton was walking in com
pany with a young lady along the road
in the Dry Creek bed when Dunham

[From a photograph by Professor Haussler of San Jose.]
passed him. Dunham did not speak, but
walked with ais bead down as though
thinking deeply. He was weil acquainted
with Dunham and thought it strange
that he should pass within ten feet of him
without speaking, and remarked about it
to his companion.
The testimony of the doctors as to the
number and direction of the bullets and
the blows upon the bodies of the dead
completed the inquest.
The verdict was rendered at once, nam
ing Dunham as the murderer of the six
people.
A Call reporter put the question direct
to Charles Dunham, the brother of the
murderer, as to whether or not it was true
that he had been engaged to marry Hattie
Wells before she married his brother. For
an answer the young man said:
"I do not care to deny or affirm any
thing in connection with this terrible af
fair. There have been a great many
things said. I do not wish to reply to
them. This tragedy has been done. It
conips directly home to me. lam anxious
that my brother shall be apprehended, as
I am certain he is insane."
Charles Dunham is employed in the
store of Miller & Co. as bookkeeper and is
highly thought of. He is evidently very
much wrought up over this affair. It is
stated thit Mrs. McGlincy has left a will.
Sue has two sisters living in this city. It
appears that the property, which is valued
at about $75,000, belonged to her and was
left to her by her former husband.
The question arises whether after all
the son of Dunham, for whose benefit the
great crime was committed, would come
in for all of t ho property, and even so, if
after the debts are paid he would get
much if he did.
Under instructions from the District
Attorney's office, Constable Ed Haley this
morning swore to a complaint in Justice
Gass' court charging James C. Dunham
with murder.
GAVE UP THE SEARCH.
Heavy Fog Makes It impossible to
Follow a Trail.
SAN JOSE, Cal , May 29 (2 a. m.)â A
telephonic communication from Smith's
Hotel reports that the posse has returned
and given over the search for to-night.
Sheriff Lyndon is very confident that he
will effect a capture by 9 o'clock this
morning, as every trail wiil be guarded
and patrolled and the people at Mount
Hamilton are already on the alert.
The foir is very heavy on the mountain
and it was impossible to do anything
further to-night. At daylight, however,
the posse will be divided up to cover the
South Springs road and San Isabel pass
and two other roads leading up the
mountain.
An examination of the wire fences shows
that the murderer has not broken through
there, and is, therefore, â¢till in the road or
dependent upon it between Smith's and
the observatory.
The Sheriff says that if he abandons his
horse and takes to the woods he will have
still less chance of escape, as the hounds
will be placed upon his track with the
start early to-morrow morning. Capture,
he says, is certain in any case.
The trails available for horses will bs
so guarded that he will be caught if he
keeps to them, if he abandons the horse
and tries his luck afoot his progresswill be
so slow that he must be quickly overtaken.
Several persons reported as traveling the
trail and supposed to be the murderer
were run down to-night, only to discover
that they were not the fugitive.
Every member of the party is eager for
daylight to resume pursuit, which has be
come exceedingly exciting as the nearness
to their game is made evident. Dunham,
if he does not take hia own life, may rea-
sonably be expected to be housed in San
Jose Jail before nightfall.
ONE VICTIM BURIED.
Impressive Funeral Services Over
Miss Schessler's Remains.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 28.â The funeral
of Miss Minnie Schessler, onÂ« of the vic
tims of Dunham, took place this after
noon. Service was field in the First
Christian Church, and Rev. B. B. Burton,
pastor, made a most affecting address.
"Rock of Ages" was then sung, and after a
few texts of Scripture had been read the
coffin was taken back to the hearse. The
coffin was covered with wreaths of lilies
and other white flowers. At the Oak Hill
Cemetery the Daughters of Ilebekah held
the final services over the grave.
The chief mourners were the parents,
Dr. and Mrs. Schessler, Walter Schessler
and Mrs. Ada Reen. a sister of the de
ceased, besides many other relatives and
friends were present at the funeral, which
was largely attended.
The houorary pall-bearers were Misses
Mabel Campbell, Maud Berwick, Carrie
Phau, Maud jJunker, May Holland and
Messrs. Harland, Berwick, Eley, Wallace,
Craycroff, Smith.
DUNHAM'S BAD RECORD.
Brutality and Theft Were Among
his Crimes.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 28.â James
B. Dunham, the San Jose murderer, was
at one time a resident of this city, and is
well known to the police force, as at one
time they were called upon to solve a
mysterious robbery case in whicn his wife
was the sufferer, she losing all her jewelry,
and when the police finished their investi
gation it is said tnat there was proof con
clusive that James B. Dunham was the
robber, and it is stated that eventually he
confessed the robbery to his wife and was
forgiven.
The couple came to this city last August
on bicycles, and stated that they had rode
up from Stockton. They obtained apart
ments at the residence of Mrs. E. \V.
Rivera, 1127 E street, and eventually Dun
bam obtained the restaurant privilege at
Agricultural Park, which he conducted
during the period of the State Fair, and it
is said displayed a marked business ca
pacity and was extremely prompt in the
payments of all debts contracted,
The married life of the couple was by no
means a lengthened honeymoon, and it is
claimed that Dunham displayed great bru
tality toward his wife, who seemingly
worshipped the ground he trod on, and
was always watching for a kindly look or
word from the man she so evidently loved,
yet feared. It was the old, old story of a
man's. brutality to a woman and woman's
humility to a brutal man. Their wedded
life abounded in quarrels, which on one
occasion at least culminated in a battle,
when it is claimed that Dunham uttered
the most brutal threats against his wife.
She is a very quiet woman, who never ut
tered a complaint to others of the treat
ment accorded her by her husband, and
this to a certain extent may be accounted
for by the evident fact that she was en
tirely controlled by her brutal husband.
One morning before arising Mrs. Dunham
took her watch from under her pillow, and
after looking at it replaced it and went to
sleep. Some two hours afterward she rose
and dressed, but on looking for her watch
found it had disappeared, as had all the
balance of her jewelry. She complained
to her landlady, and the latter positively
assured her that no one had entered the.
bouse, and suggested that Mrs. Dunham
astc her husband about the disappearance
of the valuables.
The advice was followed, but Mr. Dun
ham emphatically denied any knowledge
of the roDbery. so Mrs. Dunham reported
her loss to Chtef of Police Drew, who in
stituted a search, which it is claimed re
sulted in the discovery that Dunham stole
his wife's property and pawned it.

DELVING FOR THE DEAD.
Men Work Heroically in the Ruins
of Buiidtngs.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 23.â A district in
this city bounded north by Choteau
avenue, west by Grand avenue, south to
the city limits and east to the river is vir
tually a mass of ruins. Not an electric
light has burned nor a car run in that sec
tion, comprising 720 blocks, since 5:20 p. m.
yesterday. Within this territory scare -Iy
a building has escaped injury and thou
sands of them are in ruins. On surveying
tbe desolate scene one marvels that the
deaths are 'not trebly greater. Beginning
at the western boundary of the scene is
the handsome and exclusive residence sec
tion known as Compton Hill, the home of
the fourth generation of the early French
settlers of St. Louis. This aristocratic
home-place is strewn with debris. Just east
lies Lafayette Park. There the trees, shrub
bery, fountains and statuary that have
been the pride of the city were caught by
the wind and the place is shaven bare as
with a giant scythe.
Farther east and south to the city limits
were the homes of the thrifty German-
Americans, who have given a distinct
character to the district. To-night thou
sands of men are homeless, many of them
tram pin? ifke nomads among the ruins or
sharing the roofs of their hospitable and
m-jre fortunate neighbors. Interspersed
in this latter section and on east to the
river are mills, breweries and numberless
manufacturing concerns. Those were fair
targets for the storm, and they suffered.
It was this class of losses that added
most to the wiping out of what is con
servatively stated to be $4,000,000 in
vested capital. There are sixteen brewer
ies within these bounds worth four mil-
Hone, and while none are destroyed, all are
damaged. The losses fall heaviest on those
least able to bear them â business men of
smalicapital and owners of humble homes.
After tne storm had laid its heavy hand
upon the southern half of the city, tire
came to complete the work of destruction.
Five columns of flume shot uo, but, thauks
to the deluge of rain, the blaze was con
line Ito the starting points. In three in
stances the engines were unable to pet
nearer than a block of the fires.
Unsolicited and without prompting, the
work of relief began here at once by the
whole people. A meeting of citizens was
held at noon at the Merchants' Excnance.
Altar brief addresses by Rev. Di. SV. W.
Bo3 T d and Mayor Walbridge, contributions
were asked for. Within forty minutes, or
as fast a 9 the sums given could be ac-
KTiowledged, $14,000 was in the secretary's
hands. Contributions continued after ad-,
journment.
It is not proposed to go outside the city
for aid, though no offering will be refused.
President C. H. Spencer of the Merchants'
Exchange was made chairman of the com
mittee of distribution, and set to work at
once to place the relief moneys
The storm was most destructive in force
when it crossed Beventh street going east,
Tlie eddying currents of wind returned
again and again to make that street a
wilderness. At least forty people were
killed along this thoroughfare and the
streets immediately adjacent. House after
house was totally demolished, and the
wonder crows with extended investigation
that tne number of deaths is not far in ex
cess of what it now appears to be.
Daly's saloon at 604 South Seventh
street was a total wreck. When it fell it
was full of men wno had taken refuge
there, and from fifteen to twenty were
killed. Many of them are of a character
who have few friends and would not be
missed. One poor fellow hag been taken
out dead, and ten others seriously in- j
jured.
It is thought that others are still in the
brick-choked basement, and a gang of men
are busy digging into the debris.
The force of the winl was so frightful
along here that the iron trolley-supporting
poles of the Southwestern electric line are
bent over the ground. They did not
broak, but bent like c6pper wire.
Of course all the telegraph poles are
down, and many of them snapped in twain
with the topheavy heads hanging over I
the street, held aloft by the wires which
still cling to them.
â¢ At the Vermont Marble Work 3, at 112.3
South Seventh street, the wreck was com
plete. It was here that Hurry Hess, a
driver for the concern, was killed. He
was buried beneath tons of the great blocks
of stone which were Lurled about by the
wind.
The saddest place of this frightfully des
olated street was on the southeast corner
of Rutger street. Here had. stood the
three-story brick saloon and boarding
house of FrÂ«d Mockenheimer. It was oc
cupied by twenty families, the full num
ber of souls reaching at least calculation
eighty.
When the storm struck it it went up like
a dry puff-ball, burying dozens. No one
knows how many dead it 3 ruined brick
( and mortar conceal. Eleven persons have
been taken out dead and more than a
dozen injured.
The body of a gray -haired woman was
discovered and removed, but her name
cannot be learned.
A company of firemen was assigned to
tbe work of rescue and they kept at it
manfully. They were assisted by rela
tives of those who are supposed to be be
neath the debris.
Henry Plauchek was there hunting for
his father. He was pale and sick, but he
kept at it. Hi 3 father, William, had been
in the saloon, he said, when the building
fell. The crowd about the corner was
enormous and hard to handle. The curi
ous throng pushed in over the broken
bricks and shattered timbers, hemming in
the rescue corps and taking desperate
chances of breaking their own legs. Even
the policemen's clubs could not keep them
back.
Across the street the wreck was as bad,
but the number of people in the building
was not so large. Several dead bodies and
a half-dozen sorely wounded have been re
covered and others are still thought to be
there.
One block below this the house of the
Sattigs was crushed in and August Sattig
and his wiie badly hurt.
Up Barry street, a half block, at 715,
Mrs. Rux, her dangber Tina and her
brother, John Loering, were crushed to
death in their home.
Mrs. Clara Fiesecke and her two daugh
ters, Stella and Edna, at 1335 South
Seventh street, were mashed out of shape
by the fall of their home.
Fred Stalman, Mrs. Schmidt, Millie and
Harry Killian and their mother were
dangerously hurt, and James Killian, the
father, was killed at 1303 South Eleventh
street.
The Soulard Market was blown to pieces,
killing George Hubert with the falling
bricks and another man whose name has
not been learned. So it ran along this ill
starred street.
The excursion steamer Grand Republic,
with its load of several hundred children,
reached its dock safely this afternoon. It
had not been within the storm limit.
IN EAST ST. LOUIS.
Havoc of the Tornado In Its Mad
Career.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., May 28.â 1n East St.
Louis the track of the storm is as clearly
denned, after touching the Illinois shore,
as if platted by a surveyor. Tearing di
agonally through the city, from southwest
to northeast, it cut a clean swath of de
struction.
Bloody Island, the river front of the
city, is a low, narrow strip of land, now
joined to the mainland that was the ter
mini of all the railroads centering there.
Large freightsheds were strung along the
river front. Nine of the largest of these
are in ruins. The greatest damage was
done to the Vandalia, the Mobile and
Ohio, the Big Four, the Chicago and Alton,
the Wabash and the Louisville and Nash
ville sheds.
At the Vandalia the loss of life was
greatest. There the structure seimed lift
ed up and dropped again ovar the founda
tions. Fourteen of the dead tenumerated
were taken from these sheds. Across Cai
hokia Creek, in the city proper, the de
struction was complete.
The relay depot, an abomination which
even the corroding hand of time could not
destroy, went to pieces before the storm.
The switch tower, upon the perfect work
ing of which depends the movement of
nundreds oF trains, was made useless.
Three small hotels in the vicinity were de
stroyed.
North and east of the relay depot a
wide residence section, mostly small
houses occupied by mechanics, was
cleaned up. It is through this part that
the majority of the fatalities occurred.
The high dykes to the west that shut off
the waters of the Mississippi were no pro
tecticn, and the frame houses went down
like houses of cards. The viaduct across
the mass of tracks, east of Cailhokia Creek,
was made useless. The new Martell
House, t se McCausland Opera-house, the
City Hall, Flannigan's Hall, three
churches, the High School and residences
that covered fourteen blocks of ground
east of the viaduct were demolished.
Farther on to the north and east to
the stockyards vicinity everything was
swept away. The definite limits of the
storm indicated above may be clearly
noted here. The National Hotel was un
injured, while two blocks southeast a
bouse owned by H. D. Sexton was torn to
kindling wood. Passing on outside the
city every suburban garden, orchard and
field is razed of its growth. In all this
desolation death ran riot. Hich above
the storm were beard the cries of puffer
ing and the shrieks of people struggling
helplessly against the storm's fury. The
points of greatest disaster, the water front
and the vicinity of the relay depot, have
not yet given up all their dead.
Scarcely a single person in the storm's
highway escaped some injury. Sifting
the truth from the exaggerated storie3 of
excited individuals, it seems probable that
the death list will be between 150 and 200.
Of the injured any figures under 500 and
over 600 may be named.
Coroner Campbell to-day held inquests
on eighty-four bodies and barely kept up
his work as the dead arrived.
One morning paper will to-morrow give
the losses in East St. Louis and on tbe
river as follows: River losses. $750,000; by
storm, $3,000,000; by fire, $250,000; total,
$4,000,000.
DISASTERS TO VESSELS.
Boats Blown From Their Moorings
and Sunk.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 28.â The track
of the storm across the river was prac
tically the same as that of the great
storm of August 4, 1878. The trend of the
main volume of the wind was from south
west to northeast, leaving the Missouri
shore at the center of the southern half oi
this city and striking the Illinois shore in
a path whose northern edge was the Eads
bridge and extending south three-quar
ter.s of a mile.
Within this path were moored twenty
five steamers, large and 3tnall. The storm
fell so suddenly tbat none of the vessels
were prepared. In all ten large passenger
steamers, five ferry-boats, two transfer
boats, two tugboats and half a dozen
small pleasure barges were driven to the
opposite shore or sunk outright.
The steamer J. J. Odill was loosened
from its moorings and blown against tbe
second pier of the Eads bridge, where it
sank. Just before the boat struck her
boi'ers blew up. Nine of her crew of
twelve, besides three women passengers
and her captain, George Townsend, are re
ported as missing. Those of ihe crew who
reached land in safety are John Morrissey,
Patrick Milan and a man named Moore.
About the same time t hft Oaill struck the
pier the towboat Dolphiu No. 2 was blown
from her wharfboat at the foot of Morgan
street, dashinc her up against the first
pier. She struck the pier with a force
that crushed in her starboard side. She
drifted down the river for about three
blocks and then sank, only leaving her
prow above the water.
There were eleven persons, three of them

women, all of whom had jumped from
either the steamer Pittsburg or the Libbie
Conger, who managed to catch driftwood,
wiiich carried them down the river to the j
Pittsburg ayKe, where they were caught
in an eddy and sunk to Ihe bottom.
The Bald Eagle was blown down the
river for a considerable distance, when the
boat wob capsized and went to the bottom.
About twenty persous were on board,
but nothing has been seen or heard of
them. A great many lives were lost by
the sinking of barges and smaller craft.
In most every case there were at least ten
men on board of each of them, and in
many cases several of them are still miss
ing.
The Baton Rouge Belle, a tugboat, was
forced from its hawser out into the middle
of the river. When it reached there it
began to roll over and over down the river
till it reachod the foot of Choteau avenue,
where it was forced against the wharf of
the Wiggins Ferry Company by the wind
and sunk in fifteen feet of water.
The City of Monroe was dashed against
the shore, but did not go down. Captain
Zeigler exhorted his passengers and crew
not to jump overboard. His last words
were: "There is no danger." He was
blown into the river and drowned.
The following boats are reported as dam
aged or missing: Pittsburg, City of Vicks- '

men and women wanted information,
about the safety of those they were inter
ested in, or eagerly scanned the bulletin
boards of the railroad companies to learn
about the expected arrival of the first
trains from the storm-swept center. Be
tween 600 and 7CO Chicago people were
registered at the hotels of St. Louis and
East St. Louis, Tuesday night- Three
times as many families seemed to be rep- 1
resented in the crowds at the terminals of
the Chicago and Alton at the Union depot,
of the Wabash road, at the Polk-street sta
tion, and at the Illinois Central statfon,
on the lake front. The railroad telegraph !
operators and the officials oi" the passen
ger departments could give littie informa
tion to the Dubiic. Prostrated wires
formed a gap which could not be bridged'
in a few hours.
An emergency train, which was made'j
up at Carlinviile on the Alton road just
outside the tornado center at 9 o'clock I
last night, was the only train from the St.
Louis region to arrive in Chicago this
morning. Shortly after the arrival of this
special the Kansas City limited, which
crossed the outskirts of the waste left by
the storm at 11 o'clock last night arrived
at the Union depot.
Terminal Superintendent Reeves of the
Alton road received word from Bloom
ington this morning relating the hair
breadth escape of the accommodation train
from being blown off the Eads bridge
into the river. He said:
"The train was almost on the bridge,
drawing slowly, when the bridge was
wrecked and two coaches derailed. No
one was injured on the train, but the crew
say the engine was almost hovering over
the broken spau."
Reports received over the Illinois Cen
tral Railroad wires brought news of great
destruction of life and property in the
neighborhood of Centralia, east and south
east of St. Louis. A telegram received at
Centralia said: "Several reported killed
at Irvington, Richview and Ashley. 1 '
Later information is that th cyclone
34
which passed through Southern Illinois
spread destruction over a large extent o
territory. New Baden, a village an the
Air Line, west of Oentralia, is reported to
have been destroyed, except for six
houses, and thirty-six lives were lost.
Seven persona are reported killed and
thirty injured at New Madrid, southeast
of Centralia.
Five or six miles of telegraph poles are
down between Irvington and Bois, three
miles of them being blown clear off the
right of way. It will take two days to
repair the line. The villages of Bois and
Dix were partially destroyed and several
persons killed. It is estimated that fifty
lives have been lost in Clinton, Washing
ton and Jefferson and a vast amount of
farm property destroyed. Centralia was
not touched.
The tornado struck Breckenridge,
twelve miles from Springfield, destroyed
tne mill and elevator and lightning killed
M. Jenkins and H. Barnes, who were cut
ting grass in the cemetery. The village of
New Mindon, sixteen miles from Cen
tralia, was destroyed by the wind. There
were 350 inhabitants, and no fatalities
were given.
Nasuville wired Governor Altgeld that
tents were badly needed at once for the
homeless.
John Lambert, general manager of the
Consolidated Steel and Wire company, Ft.
Louis, received a telegram from tbat city
to-day stating that the St. Louis factory
was completely wrecked and several of the
workmen injured.
Chicago's public men and business rep
resentatives were quick to-day to take
sympathetic action and offer financial as
sistance to the cities on both sides of the
Mississippi.
Mayor Swift sent a telegram to M<*yor
Walbridge offering aid and then called a
special meeting of the City Council, which
passed similar resolutions and requested
the Mayor to call a mass-meeting to raise
money if needed. Tne Board of Traae,
Builders' and Traders' Exchange and
Union League Club held special meetings
and took similar action toward the two
cities. At Mayor Swift's request Chief of
Police Badenoch left for St. Louis to-night
to represent the city in offering assistance
and ascertain the extent of the damage.
OVER THE SUSQUEHANNA.
Tornado Sweeps a Large Portion of
Pennsylvania.
LANCASTER, Pa., May 28.â A tornado
that came from the York County shore
swept across the Susquehanna'shortly after
1 o'clock this afternoon and did a vast
amount of damage in Columbia, about ten
miles from here, together with several fa
talities.
It first struck the planine-mill of John
Forrey, unroofing the structure and doing
a great deal of damage to houses in the
vicinity of Front street. The black cloud
then struck the Columbia Rolling Mill,
lifted the roof bodily off and buried fifteen
men in the ruins.
Following are the casualties: Percy
Zerger, buried under the roof, head cut,
struck by portions of the flying roof,
fatally injured; Isaac Haverstiek,
puddler, leg and head crushed
and body scalded, died to-night;
Walter Brunner, cuts on head,
arm broken and bruised about the body ;
William Sciileeger. hand broken and in
jured about the body; Harry Duck, ped
dler, struck by timbers and badly cut on
the body ; Joseph Dangert, drivine a cart,
was buried by roof, seriously hurt intei
uftlly.
The rolling mill is completely demol
ished and the machinery ruined.
The storm next struck the electr'c-light
station and badly injured the building.
John Hughes, the* engineer, was instantly
killed in trying to close the windows. He
was blown into the fly-wheel of the engine
and torn to Iragments.
TENTS FOR HOMELESS.
The War Department Authorized to
Supply Them.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.-A con
current resolution providing for the loan
of tents by the War Department, and such
other relief as the Secretary may deem
necessary to the sufferers of the St. Louis
storm, was introduced upon the meeting
of the House to-day by Bartholdt and
agreed to without discussion or objection.
Later the Senate amendment making it a
joint resolution was agreed to, and at 4:30
o'clock Speaker Reed announced that he
had signed it. .
Leave was granted Bartholdt and Hub
bard of the Missouri delegation to visit St.
Louis and they left this afternoon.

WASHINGTON'S BIG STORM.
Violent Winds Tear Up Trees and
Unroof Houses.
WASHINGTON, D. C. ; May 28âAt 3:30
o'clock to-day a violent thunderstorm, ac
conipanied b\ wind averaging sixty miles
per hour, passed over this city. The storm
came from the sruthwest and passed
nearly due east. The rain came down in
torrents for a short time. Many of tne
beautiful old trees in the White House
grounds suffered severely. One tree was
taken up by the roots, bearing with it a
segment of green lawn and part of a brick
gutter. The finest tree in the park â a
majestic and aged maple â was practically
ruined, its limbs being twisted off and
strewn in every direction.
Another tree broke off near the ground
and a score more were denuded of limbs.
The path of the wind can be traced through
the grounds by the fallen trunks and
branches. A space less than 100 yards
wide marked the progress of its tury. The
wind took the roof off the Memorial
Church at Vermont and Fourteenth
streets. The trees were blown down in
every part of the city and many small
houses unroofed.
SPLENDID NEWS SERVICE.
As Usual, The United Press Scooped
Its Rivals.
NORWALK, Ohio, May 28.â The Chron
icle, Norwalk's vigorous young morning
paper, issued an afternoon edition to-day
containing tbe magnificent report of the
St. Louis disaster furnished by the United
Press up to 4 p. m.
Speaking of Wednesday night's report
the Chronicle says: The Chronicle's re
port of the St. Louis cyclone was by two
columns more complete than that of any
Cleveland paper which came to Norwalk.
The United Press beat tbe Associated
Press two to one on its report.
LINCOLN, Nebb., May 28.â The follow
ing editorial, which is self-explanatory,
will appear in to-morrow's State Journal:
"The report of the fit. Louis storm
printed by the Journal yesterday morning
w,as prepared and sent out by the United
Press. It was, considering the monstrous
difficulties encountered, the most notable
piece of newspaper work done in this
country in recent years. The task of col
lecting and transmitting the particulars of
the great disaster could not be commenced
until after 6 o'clock and then practically
all of the telegraph wires in the path of
the storm were prostrated. How the
United Press managed to send out nearly
a full page of vivid and fairly accurate re
ports in the next six hours is a puzzle to
telegraph operators and newspaper men.
A press association that can perform such
a feat must be highly organized and well
equipped with brains."
OMAHA, Nebr., May 28.â The World-
Herald will say editorially to-morrow
morning:
"The superior service of the United Press
covering the St. Louis catastrophe enabled
this paper to give to its patrons a com
prehensive story of the terrible details
twelve hours beiore its Associated Press
competitors were roused from their slum
bers to the fact that anything very start
ling had occurred. An attempt to relieve
their defeat by 'extras,' with garbled re
ports taken from other papers, failed
utterly. "
BOSTON. Mass., May 28. âThe Record,
the afte noon newspaper associated with
the Morning Advertiser, to-day says:
"Since the Journal dropped out of the
United Press news service, which supplies
the Advertiser, it has made some talk
about what news it was getting that the
other papers did not. As there were in
the claims very few items of any impor
tance, no attention was paid to this by
any of the United Press papers. But last
night came a real test of the comparative
merits of the United and Associated Prsss
service, the former supplying the Re
cord and the other leading pap rs of the
city. While the other papers piled up
fact upon fact with a wealth of detail in
the way of names of people killed and
property destroyed at St. Louis, toe West
ern Associated service gave only frae
mentary and incomplete accounts. It
gave the names of only a few of the many
buildings destroyed or damaged, and re
ported the steamer Grand Republic, for
instance, destroyed, while the fact i 3 that,
though stranded, she is safe and dound.
"Tbe Advertiser's report this morning,
being the full United Press report, was a
splendid piece of newspaper work, and
showed what could be done in the face of
such disaster by a news service that is
thoroughly equipped and master of its
own resources at such a trying time. It
not only told well the story of the storm,
but gave what is of the choicest value
at such a time, a thorough summary of
the buildings ruined, and considering the
circumstances, a remarkable list of the
dead."
METHODIST CONFERENCE ENDED.
But the Question of Woman* Eligibility
Is Still Unsettled. %
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 28.â The
Twenty-seventh General Conference of the
Methodist Episcopal church, which for
four weeks has absorbed the attention of
tbe religious world, is a thing of the past.
With a fall of the gavel in the hand of
Bishop Merrill at 10:20 p. m. the confer
ence and its acts passed into history.
On the great questions wbich have ab
sorbed the attention of the church it has
done practically nothing. The question
of a woman's eligibility to sit in the
General Conference is exactly where it was
before.
The constitution revision has not pro
ceeded a step beyond where it was eight
years ago. The conference straddled most
effectively the matter of lay representa
tion. It adopted a disciplinary clause
providing for equal lay and clerical repre
sentation in the general conference, know
ing that it would not, in all probability,
receive the necessary three-fourths vote in
the annual conferences. It refused to al
low the laymen the privilege of sitting in
the annual conferences, but gave them the
right to sit separately in tbe general con
ference. Bishop Joyce presided over the
nrst part of tbe final session. The de
votional exercises were conducted by Rev.
Dr. J. B. Hinsley of Minnesota.
Dr. Mitchell, secretary of the committee
on boundaries, presented a report hxine
the boundaries of 123 conferences and
twenty missionary conferences at home
and abroad and including twenty-one
enabling acts. It was adopted without
debate.
A second report fixing the number of
members essential to tbe organization of a
new conference at thirty instead of twenty
was laid on the table.
ignite a row was raised by several mem
bers who were opposed to granting an an
nual subsidy of $3000 to the Pacific Chris
tian Advocate of Portland, Or. The item
was adopted.
Dr. Ji art jell, missionary bishop to Afri
ca, made a brief speech asking for the
good wishes and prayers of the delegates
for him in his new work.
At 12:30 o'clock the final panorama was
placed on the stage by Dr. Buckley, who
rose to move that according to custom, all
futber reports of committees be laid on
the table and that tbe roll be called for tne
presentation of the usual vote of thanks.
The closing hymn, "Laborers In the
Vineyard." was then sung. Bishop Bow
man offered the closing urayer. Bishop
Foster pronounced the benediction and
the delegates filed out.

Party.
ladies was appointed to consider these
requests and report on them.
Dr. J. K. Wunk of New York, chairman
of the committee on platform tben re
ported tbe platform as agreed upon by
the majority of the committee upon the
lines heretofore indicated in The United
Press dispatches.
The first six planks, denunciatory of the
liquor traffic and proposing straight-out
prohibition, hÂ« said, had been unani
mously adopted. The seven th plank,
which declared that no citizen should be
denied tbe right to vote on account of sex,
he said, had been adopted by only a small
majority. The other planka upon which
there was some division in the committee
were:
Clause Bâ That all citizens should be pro
tected in their right to one day's rest a week.
Clause 9â Non-sectarian schools to be taught
In the English language.
Clause 10â Election of President, Vice-Presi
dent and Senators directly by the people.
Clause 11â Liberal pensions.
Clause 12â Exclusion of paupei and crim
inal immigration.
Clause 13â The naturalized citizen not to
vote until a year after naturalization.
Clause 14 â Favoring arbitration.
Clause 15â Inviting co-operation of all per
sons favoring these views.
When Governor St. John arose to pre
sent the minority report he was received
with loud applause from tbe broad-gauge
faction, which increased as he read tbe
minority plank, as follows:
Resolved, That all money be issued by the
Governmeut only, and without the Interven
tion of any private citizen, corporation or
banking institution. It should be based upon
the wealth, stability and integrity of the Na
tion, and be a full legal tender for all debts,
public and private, and should be of sufficient
volume to meet the demands of legitimate
business interests of the country and for the
purpose of honestly liquidating all our out
standing obligations payable in coin. We de
mand the free and unlimited coinage of silver
and gold at a ratio of 16 to 1, without consult
ing any other nation.
The other points on which the minority
asked action were as follows:
Seventeenthâ Preserving public lands from
monopoly and speculation.
Eighteenthâ Government control of all the
railroads and telegraphs.
Nineteenthâ Favoring an income -tax and
imposing only such import duties as are neces
sary to secure equitable commercial relations
with other nations.
Twentiethâ Favoring the adoption of the in
itiative and referendum as a means of obtain
ing tree expression of the popular will.
On their motion to make their commen
dations part of the majority report the
fight began. The Indiana delegates de
manded tbat the vote be taken by a call of
States, and New York and Pennsylvania
delegates to a sufficient number seconded
the motion.
Tbe vote was then taken on a motion to
table Governor St. John's proposition and
resulted as follows: Ayes 310, noes 492.
At the afternoon session the convention
proceeded to the immediate consideration
of the free- silver plank proposed by the
broad-gauge faction, which was discussed
with treat warmth on each side. After
three hours' hot debate the free-silver
plank was defeated by a vote of 387 ayes to
427 noes. Two of the lowa delegation an
nounced that they voted for the plank
under instructions and against their con
victions. Five of the Michigan delegates,
under the lead^ship of Professor Dickie,
ex-chairman of the National Committee,
disobeyed tbe instructions of the commit
tee and voted "No."
The chair declared the free silver reso
lution lost, and, after the cheering and
excitement which this announcement
had caused had quieted down, the con-
Tention proceeded to the consideration of
other parts of the platform, against which
tbere Was no strong opposition.
But before much progress had been
I mnde Patton of Illinois upset the whole
course of progress and precipitated a
lively debate by opposing the non-sec
' tarian school resolution as being the
| work of the American Protective Union,
and then appealed to the convention not
to adopt anything which would prevent
their eulisting all good citizens to aid
them in fighting the rum power. He pro
posed a sub-platform which omitted men
tion of every subject (woman suffrage
included) except prohibition.
Governor St. John, his voice showing
great emotion, rose and said as the single
plank men had been successful, and had
induced the convention to dodge the
greatest question of the day â the silver
questionâ he was in favor of turning over
the whole organization to them, and if
they must have a single-plank platform
he was inclined to think this was as good
a one as could be had.
Meantime Mrs. Helen Gougar and other
prominent woman suffragists, manifest
ing great excitement, demanded recogni
tion to denounce "'those cowardly men."
Chairman Stewart, addressing Mrs.
Gougar, warmly reminded her that th re
were 800 other delegates in the convention
besides herself.
In a scene of intense confusion the pre
vious question was ordered by a rising
vote, and Mr. Patton's substitute was de
clared adopted, and thus became the sole
platform of the party. Its full text was as
follows:
The Prohibition party, In National conven
tion assembled, declares its firm conviction
that the manufacture, exportation, importa
tion and sale of alcoholic beverages has pro
duced such social, commercial, industrial and
political wrongs, and is now threatening the
perpetuity of all our social and political insti
tutions; that the suppression of the same by a
National party, organized therefor, is the
greatest object to be accomplished by the
voters of ovir country, and i? of such importance
that it of right ou^bt to control the political
action of all our patriotic citizens until suoh
suppression is accomplished. The urgency of
this cause demands the union without further
delay of all citizens who desire the prohibition
of the liquor traffic. Therefore, be it
Ketnlved, That we favor the legal prohibition
by State and National legislation of the manu
facture, importation, exportation, interstate
transportation and sale of alcoholic beverages.
Rnolvtd That we declare our purpose lo or
ganize ond unite all the friends of prohibition
into our party, and in order to accomplish this
â¢â¢nd we deem it but ri^ht to leave every Pro
hibitionist the freedom of his own convictions
upon all other questions and trust our repre
sentatives to take such action upon other po
litical questions as the changes occasioned by
prohibition and the welfare ol the whole people
shail demand.
The result seemed to take the broad-
Rangers completely fay surprise, although
it was intimated that an undemanding
had been had between some of the leader?
of tha two factions that whichever side
was successful on the silver question should
have its way as to the rest of the platform.
The Western men who favored the in
sertion of the Populist features recom
mended by the minority of the platform
committee fairly yelled themselves hoarfe
in declarations that the Prohibitionists
were no longer a political party, but had
become a mere temperance association.
The chairman pounding his gavel in
vain efforts to quiet the din shouted that
Mr. Dickie of Michigan was recognized
for the purpose of making a statement.
That statement was not made, for Henry
French of California, who was, one of in
numerable delegates standing on chairs
and clamoring' to be heard, shouted: "It
is eminently proper that Mr. Dickie should
be recognized, for the Prohibition party
has been assassinated, and he is the as
sassin."
In the midst of the hubbub tbat fol
lowed this remark Mr. St. John came for
ward and, changing his recently expressed
opinion that Mr. Patton's single-plank
platform was the best that could be had
nnder the circumstances, moved to recon
sider the vote by which it had been
adopted.
The narrow-gauge men at once moved
to lay this motion on the table, and, by a
rising vote, in which everybody seemed to
be standing up for both sides of the ques
tion at the same time, the motion to table
the resolution was declared adopted.
A recess was taken at 6:45 p. M. until 8
p. M., and the broad-gauge men immedi
ately went into caucus to consider their
further plans.
About 300 delegates attended the broad
gauge caucus, including sixty women. Va
rious bolting propositions were bowled
down and the decision was reached to post
pone all action until after the final adjourn
ment of the regular convention.
As soon as the night session of the con
vention was called to order the roll was
called for nominations for President and
Vice-President of the United Statei. Jar.
Tucker of Maryland nominated Joshua
Levering of that State.
Elisha Kent Kane of Pennsylvania
nominated ex-Governor L. C. Hughes of
Arizona, a former citizen of Philadelphia.
He claimed that President Cleveland, in
the course of the grinding tyranny he wai
subjecting us to, had tyranically sought
to put down Governor Hughes because he
had espoused the Prohibition interest and
had put it in the front in Arizona. He
read a telegram from Governor Hughes,
intimating that he would accept the
nomination and would stand with the
party during the campaign and that he
was a political Prohibitionist without
q ualitication.
No other nominations for President were
made. Mr. Levering's nomination was
seconded by Mr. Hipp of Illinois, Y. B.
Cushing of Maryland, Mr. English of New
York and McClennan Brown of Ohio, the
latter in a most amusingly egotistical
speech, which restored the conTention to
uprorious good humor; also by A. A.
Stevens of Philadelphia, Mr. Williams of
Rhode Island and delegates from Dela
ware, Georgia, Tennessee and other States.
No one hayine seconded ex-Governor
Hughes' nomination his name was with
drawn and Joshua Levering of Baltimore
was nominated by acclamation as the Pro
hibition standard-bearer.
With waving of flags and tumultuous
demonstrations of applause the candidate
was escorted to the platform ana made a
graceful address of acceptance.
Soon after 11 p. m., when the Na
tional Commiiteo had possession of
the floor and contributions to the
campaign fund, headed by a number
of ?500 checks from New York delegates,
were pouring in, a tramping down the
aisle to the left of the chair announced the
departure of the free-silver, woman-suf
frage and Populist "bolters," about 200 in
number, who had secured a hall and were
preparing to hold a meeting elsewhere.
They very materially disturbed the pro
ceedings of the convention. At this rao
men Mrs. Boots of New York, on behalf
of the V'oman's Christian Temperance
Union, obtained permission to offer a res
lution, and moved the reinsertion in the
olatform of the woman's suffrage plank
which had been stricken out by the sub
stitute.
Confusion once more took possession of
the meeting. A delegate from Colorado,
standing on nis chair and wildly gesticu
lating, declared that the substitute plat
form adopted insulted tbe decent men and
respectable women of tne convention and
nad driven the venerable chieftain, St.
John, out o* the ranks.
Mrs. Boole subsequently changed the
form of her resolution, making it simply
a declaratory declaration and not a part of
the platform, and in this respect it was ac
cepted by the chairman of the committee
on resolution* and adopted with only a
few dissenting votes.
Nominations for Vice-President were
then proceeded with. Captain J. D\ Cleg
horn of Wisconsin was named, bui an
nounced him.-elf as disqualified, as he had
been born in Canada.
New York, Massachusetts and New
Jersey named John Hipp of Colorado.
Mr. Hipp declined the nomination.
Other candidates named were: Ed Ken
dell of Cambridge, Mass. ; Hale Johnson
of Illinois, Homer L. Castle of Pittsbur^,
who.declinel; Robert H. Patter of Illinois,
who withdrew, and ex-Governor Hughes
of Arizona.
Nominations were closed and a vote
taken, which resulted: Hughes 123, John
son 309. The nomination of Mr. Johnson
was then madÂ«- unanimous, and. upon be
ing escorted to the platform, be accepted
the honor with thanks. With a vote of
thanks to the local papers and the United
Press for accurate reports, the convention
at 12:30 a. m. adjourned sine die.
Mr. Dickie was re-elected National chair
man.
The bolting delegates who witndrew
from the prohibition convention held a
meeting and organized "the National
party," with "home rule" their motto. A
platform was adopted embodying the
minority report, wnich was submitted by
the Prohibition broad-gauge faction, but
rejected by the convention. C. E. Bentley
of NebrasKa was nominated for President;
J. H. Southgate of South Carolina, Vice-
I'n sident. A National committee with
L. B. Logan of Ohio, chairman, was or
ganized.
TO PROHIBIT BOND ISSUES.
Except With Both the Sanction of Both
Houses of Congressâ Argued in
the Senate.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.â The
only actual piece of legislation by the Sen
ate to-day was the ;.assage of the House
joint resolution for the loan of tents to tbe
sufferers by the appalling storm of yester
day in and near St. Loui.-, and that resolu
tion was passed rather because it would
appear unnecorous not to pass it than be
cause it was regarded fitting or necessary.
That at least was the view of it expressed
oy Senators Vest of Missouri and Cullom
of Illinois. The joint resolution had re
ceived the signatures of the Speaker and
Vice- President and had been sent to the
President before adjournment.
The conference report, on the Indian ap
propriation bill met determined resistance
on account of an amendment contained in
it (and which had no basis in the bill as
passed), providing for extending the rights
and duties of citizens to the Indians of the
tive civilized tribes. Tbe matter went over
without action at 2 o'clock, when the con
sideration of the bill to prohibit the issu
ance of bonds without consent of Congress
was taken up.
Daniel of Virginia continued the speech
which he had begun yesterday in support
of the bill and in advocacy of free
coinage and in advocation of the silver
policy, winding up with the emphatic
declaration that he took bis place in the
ranks of the plain masses of the American
people who appreciated their institutions
and intended to defend them at whatever
cost.
A speech in favor of the bill was also
made by Peffer of Kansas, in which he de
clared that if tbe gold policy were per
sisted in and if the usurpation of the Pres
ident in issuing bonds were not stopped
(which was the object of the bill) the peo
ple would be driven to repudiation.
Tne bill went over without action and
the Senate at 6:20 adjourned until to
morrow.
IN THE HO USE.
Appropriations Made to Repair Several
Public Buildings.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.â 1n the
house to-day the partial conference report
upon the sundry civil appropriation bill,
which was under consideration when the
House adjourned yesterday, was disposed
of. The House agreed to the following
Senate amendments: Appropriating $5000
to build approaches to the Martinsburg
(W. Va.) public building: appropriating
$43,000 to repair and improve the Court
house at Little Rock, Ark., and appropri
ating $60,000 to repair and improve the
New York posloffice.
Tbe bill granting Fort Omaha reserva
tion to the State of Nebraska was agreed
to, with an amendment recommended in
conference tbat it be leased to the State at
a nominal figure.
The House rejected the conference re
port on the bill to pension the widow of
the late General Poe of the engineer corps,
fixing tbe amount at $75 a month, and in
sisted upon its amendment making the
pension $50 a month.
The remainder of the day was spent in
discussing the contested election case of
Johnson vs. Stokes, from the Seventh
South Carolina District. Johnson's right
to the seat was maintained by Overstreet
(R.) of Indiana in a two hoars' speech, to
which DeArmond (D.) of Missouri re
sponded for an hour and a half. Without
completing the case the House at 5:15 ad
journed.
FREE RIGHT OF WAY.
Or Operations Will Cease When the Val-
ley Road Reaches Fresno.
FRESNO, Cal., May 28.â C. S. Young of
San Francisco, who is in this county look
ing after rights of way for the Valley road,
to-day received a telegram from Chief En
gineer W. B. Storey staling that the direc
tors of the road feel tbat free right of way
between Fresno and Bakersfield should be
given, and unless satisfactory arrangement
in this respect is made operations will
cease when the road reaches Fresno.
CAUSED BY AN
OVERLOADED CAR.
The Victoria Horror Could
Easily Have Been
Avoided.
BRIDGE WAS UNSAFE.
Built Only to Be Used by Foot
Passengers and
Wagons.
WHEKE TO LAT THE BLAME.
The First Work of the Coroner W,l
Be to Identify All
Bodies.
VICTORIA, B. a, May 28.â This city is
still in a dazed condition as the result of
the dreadful bridge disaster. All yester
day divers were at work. The cai that fell
with the bridge was pulled out on the
bank, bat it is believed that there are still
a number of bodies entangled in the
wreckage of the bridge itself.
Fifty-three bodies have been taken from
the wreck, and it is known that at least
three more are yet to be recovered. But
there are probably more than three still
to be added to the death list.
What makes the whole affair more sad
is that the accident was entirely avoidable.
The bridge bad on three separate occa
sions been pronounced unsafe and had
been condemned. It was built for wagon
traffic and its limit of strength was only
one-fourth what it would have been had
it been intended for railroad use.
The car that caused the accident was
the heaviest on tne line. Once before,
several months ago, it had crossed the
bridge when crowded, and had caused
such a sagging that it was feared that the
bridge would fall. After that experience
the car was not iun until this week, when
it was put on to accommodate the extra
traffic. It is reported that the city will be
sued for $1,000,000 damages by relatives of
the victims.
The Coroner has opened an inquest into
tbe causes of death of victims of tbe dis
aster, and announced that the inquiry
would be of the most thorough nature.
He announced t at all that was required
for the present was the identification of
the bodies by the authorities, after which
an investigation as to the facts would go
on. Several people who had been im
paneled were removed as ineligible. The
number of wounded, so far as ascertained,
is between twenty-five and thirty.
No deaths have occurred from injuries
or exposure. Some of the cases are of a
particularly painful character. One entire
tamily was wiped out, and in one case a
number of little children were deprived of
both father and mother.
MIRACULOUS ESCAPES.
BeMidentt of Vancouver, B. C, Tell of
Some Awful Experience*.
VANCOUVER. B. C, May 28.â Many
Vancouverites were eye-witnesses of the
Point Ellice Bridge disaster, while others
from Vancouver actually escaped from the
ill-fated tramcar. Among the killed from
this town were: J. G. Gordon, Bradstreet's
agent, and Mrs. Physick, wife of the as
sistant foreman of the C. P. R. R. shops.
Mr. Physick announces that he will sue
the city of Victoria for heavy damages.
Mr. Gordon, before leaving, was can
vassed for an accident policy. He an
swered, "All right; write me up for
$5000." These few words meant a great
deal to his wife and children, who other
wise would have been left in compara
tively destitute con lition.

dian Pacific railroad, was one of three or
four who escaped from the front car that
took the fearful plunge. A lady, to whom
Armstrong had eiven his seat, in thanking
him, remarked that the car was stifling,
and asked him if be would raise the win
dow behind her. Tbe next moment Arm
strong was struggling for his life in the
whirling waters, and the unknown woman
who had addressed him was a bruised and
bleeding corps* imprisoned in the car at
the bottom of the river. Armstrong's eal
lantry saved his life. He had opened the
window, and still bad his hands on the
frame when the accident occurrei. When
the overcrowded car unresisted sought the
center of eravity fifty feet below, Arm
strong was bodily jerked out of the win
dow, and before he realized what ha<i hap
pened, he found himself, head above
water, making his way for shore among
the struggling masses of humanity.
Mr. Twineford, a barber on the Can
adian Oriental steamer Empress o India,
showed marvelous presence of mind. He
was on a car directly behind Armstrong
when he saw Armstrong shoot like a bolt
from a cannon out of the car and dove
after him. He also rose to the surface
and swam ashore, and with Armstrong
afterward assisted in -aving the drowning.
Among the most miraculous escapes was
that of ex-Judge Jordan and wife of Van
couver and Lawyer A. S. Potts and wife.
The party were in a carriage opposite the
car when the bridge gave way. All four
were thrown into the -raters among
crashing timbers. While the carriage
sank with the horses Mr. Potts swam with
his wife to a portion of the bridge resting
on the submerged car and shouted to ex-
Judge Jordan to do the same. Mr. Jordan
was not such a good swimmer a- his com
panion, but succeeded in keeping himself
and -wooning wife afloat until a rescue
boat arrived. The entire party were
saved.
There have not been any additions to
the death list to day. At the inquest the
tramway company, the Provincial Gov
ernment and the city will be represented
by counsel. No damage suits have been
instituted as yet, and it is not likely that
such proceedings will be begun until the
responsibility has been fixed. The tram
way company disclaims all responsibility,
and if an inquiry should reach the same
conclusion the city will have to face the
claims for damages, which will not likely
be less than $500,0 00.

California convened last night at the
Bank building to talk over the matter of

it was through his untiring efforts ana

"It is true tbat I have resigned as gene
ral manager. There has been trouble
brewing for some time in regard to the
finances, and I have ended it by this step.
When I undertook the affair it was with
the understanding tbat 1 was to control all
moneys. Some members of thecommittee
objected, so I have resigned. Otherwise
ttie success of the celebration is assured,
and it will be a bigger celebration than
people look for."

MRS. HUSBAND'S STORY.
A Bright Young Widow Who
Claims She Was Engaged
to the Testator.
THEIR EVENING BUGGY RIDES.
Did Not See Him for Six Months,
but the Engagement Was
Never Broken.
SAN JOSE, Cat-., May 28.â The contest !
of the will of the late George H. Parker in i
Judge Reynolds' court attracts a great
many spectators. The first witness this
morning was Mrs. Husbands. She stated
that she was a widow and lived in Ala
meda. Mrs. Husbands is a bright young
woman and not over 25 years of age, and
claims that she was engaged to Parker at
the time of his death. She testified that
she first met Parker in San Franciaco, in
1892, at the studio of Miss Sinnott, where
the witness was studying painting. Parker
called on her frequently during the first
month of their acquaintance. Then for a
month she did not see him, but the fol
lowing month she met him in San Jose.
For the next month or six weeks they met
several times daily in this city, and during
that time they went out riding together
quite often in the evenings.
On her return to her home in Alameda
Parker called on her there quite often, aud
they indulged much in the pleasure of
buggy riding. For six months after that
she did not see him, she having gone on a
visit to Humboldt, but again met Parker
in January, 1893. Buggy-riding was one
of the pleasures they enjoyed most every
day, and the witness saw Parker up to
within two or three days before he last de
parted for the East.
"Were you engaged to marry him?"
asked Attorney Cooean.
"Yes," was the reply of the witness.
"Did it last up to the time of the death
of Mr. Parker?"
"It was never broken."
From this topic Attorney Coogan quickly
turned his attention to another topic and
asked wnat Parker had ever said to her
about his son Edward. The witness saia
that Parker had often said that Edward
was a drunkard, extravagant, a spend
thrift and smoked the best cigars. This
information Parker claimed to have re
ceived from Jane Pomeroy. In further
conversation with the witness Parker had
told her that his son had been offered his
fortune to ieave his wife, but baa refused
to do so, and that after all there must be
some good in both of them. In concur
ring in this opinion the witness said to
Parker that she would reserve her opinion
as to the son and his wife until she became
his wife.
The deposition of D. W. C. Thompson
was offered this morning by Attorney Pat
terson for the contestant. Thompson Had
known Parker thirty years prior to his
death, And in the first fifteen yer.rs met
him pearly every day in business inter
course, but in later years not so often.
The tet-timony regarding the condition of
mind cf Parker in recent years was not
admitted, as the witness had not qualified
himself as of sufficient intimate acquaint
ance in latter years. As to the condition
of mind of the testator in the first fifteen
years of his acquaintance, this testimony
was also ruled out on the ground of being
too remote.
During the morning session Attorney
Patterson offered the inventory and ap
praisement of the estate, which showed
the entire value of the estate in Santa
Clara, San Francisco and Alameda coun
ties to 1.-c worth $244,239.
Mrs. Mary 8. Welch waÃ also briefly
cross-e <~amined this moraine by Mr.
Delma but nothing of importance was
developed.
In t'Â«e afternoon Mrs. Husband was
cross-e 'amined by Mr. Delmas. Several
letters were showu from her to Parker, and
from P;rker to her, in which there was an
entire absence of love, and no evidence of
an engagement.

SEEN ON WYLACKIE RIDGE
The Alleged Lynchers of "Jack"
Littlefield Passed Before
Sundown.
Witness O'Neil Refutes the Claim
That a Mob Attacked Under
Cover of Darkness.
WEAVERVILLE. Cal., May 28.âWil
liam Shore, who testified Tuesday at the
preliminary examination of the alleged
Littlefield lynching, was subjected to a
long cross-examination yesterday, under
which he could not remember the exact
words that Vinton, his brother-in-law, had
used in speaking with him at Haydon's
house, and that probably he might have
said that "there might be trouble when
Littlefield was arrested," instead of "there
might be mischief before tne men got
back." He also testified that Haydon got
home about sundown and that Mrs. Hay
don had prepared an early supper for
them.
This is considered by the defense as very
good testimony in favor of one of the de
fendants, Thomas Haydon, as the lynch
ing of Littlefield is supposed to have oc
curred at or near sundown, under the
prosecution's theory, at a distance several
miles from the Haydon house. The re
direct and recross examination failed to
change Shore's testimony materially.
I'eter O'Neil, an attache of the insane
asylum at Talmadge, testified that he left
Covelo on the morning of September 26,
1895, with defendants Gregory and Rad
cliffe on a hunting trip to Long Ridge. He
reached Vinton's camp, about two miles
distant from Haydon s house, that even
ing and spent the night there. The next
morning Buck Lacock came to the place
and told Gregory that Vinton had been
shot and wanted to see him. Gregory,
Radcliffe and Lacock then went to the
Haydon house, Gregory and Lacock carry
ing rifles and Radcliffe beinsr unarmed.
He said that he would go with them if he
had anything to ride, but they told him
that there were no horses there fit to be
ridden.
He next saw Gregory and Radcliffe on
the evening of the 27th. about 8 o'clock, at
the Vinton cabin. They returned after
dark and he and the party with him had
supper. A light was burning in the cabin.
Radcliffe had a rifle with him, which he
said Vinton had sent over to Mrs. Rad
cliffe for hunting purposes.
O'Neil said that he saw Constables Van
Horn and Crow with "Jack" Littlefield in
charge crossing Eel River on the after
noon of September 27, and later when they
were about a mile and a half up the Wv
lackie Ridge. The sun was still shining.
Stenographer Ed St. Maurice of Colusa,
who reported the trial of The People vs.
Van Horn and Crow, was asked to read
from his notes the testimony of John M.
Vinton given at that trial. This was ob
jected to by the defense on the ground
that any statement made by Vinton at
that trial could be evidence only against
himself and not against the other defend
ants. This position was sustained and
the testimony was put in evidence only
against Vinton. Following Vinton's tes
timony the reporter read that of Thomas
Haydon under the same ruling of the
court.
A. FOLSOM SENSATION.
JBer. Mr. Meekt la Soundly Ttir ashed by
an Irate Buaband.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 28.â The old
historical mining town of Folsom has
never been particularly renowned for the
piety of its inhabitants. On the contrary,
religion has always had a constant strug
gle to obtain even a foothold and has
seemingly been continually overshadowed
by the shades of profanity and revelry of
the early argonaut. During the glad
Christmas time a Methodist divine named
Meeks made his advent in tue little burg
and for a time labored hard to fan into a
flame the few divine sparks that smol
dered amongst the descendants of the
miner, and for a time met with moderate
success.
Last week, however, trouble arose, and
it is claimed the divine indulged in ardent
spirits. Atall events he had a serious fall
ins; out with the few members of his church,
which culmiuated in the divine emptying
tbe vials of his wrath on the head of one
of the most exemplary Christian ladies of
the community, who. it is claimed, he
termed a painted woman. She returned
home and informed her husband, Mr.
Hinckee, who is superintendent of a large
irrigation ditch system, and the preacher,
as soon as his wrath cooled, evidently con
cluded that discretion was the better part
of valor and left the town, taking refuge
on a ranch several miles distant.
The following day the enraged husband,
accompanied by a friend, traced the minis
ter to his hiding place, and after request
ing his presence in the barn for a friendly
chat, demanded the preacher's reason for
the attack on his wife. He was informed
that if he felt aggrieved he could get satis
faction through tue law. Then the en
raged husband fell upon the preacher and
thrashed him soundly. During the melee
the constable made his appearance and
demanded a cessation of hostilities; but
when he found out the cause, he folded
his arms and told the husband to proceed
and lie did so. The matter was then
brought to the notice of the presiding
elder, who instituted an inquiry and re
moved the minister from his charge. In
the meantime there are others who are
anxious to ascertain the whereabouts of
the Rev. Mr. Meeks.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 29, 1896.
WORKING AND
SOME PLAYING,
How the College Y. M. C. A.
Are Putting in Time
at Cazadero.
GO HUNTING THE SNIPE.
The Day Enlivened by a Game
of Baseball With a Stan
ford Team.
ADDRESS BT SHERWOOD EDDY.
Students Were Deeply Impressed by
His Ideas on the "Victorious
Life."
CAZADERO, Cal., May 28.â The love of
fun which exists in every healthy, right
minded boy breaks out up here during the
intermissions. Mr. Day of Occidental
was taken on a ampe hunt last evening.
For the benefit of those who don't belong
to the R. 0. S. H. we might explain that
the victim is left out in the woods with a
bag in one hand and a candle in the other
waiting for the snipes to be chased into
the bag.
In the afternoon the challenge which
Stanford issued to any team to a game of
baseball was taken up by a picked nine,
the faculty being barred to the outfield.
The picked nine comprised the following:
Michener, first base; Eddy, right field;
Hahn, captain and catcher; Rowton, cen
ter field; C. H. Bott, left field; Cox,
pitcher; Seamens, third base; Price, short
stop; Atwood, second base. The Stanford
men are as follows:
Smith, center field; Giff P. V. Gifford,
catcher; Clark, second base; Dole, uhort
stop; Adams, third base; W. P. Gifford,
first base; Strong, left field; Arnold,
pitcher.
The game was enlivened by the actions
of the Stanford mascot, an 'animal be
longing to that species which ia character
ized by obstinacy.
The Stanford nine "were frequently called
from the game by the braying of their
donkey, who objected most strenuously to
having tin cans annexed to his tail, and
who also kicked at being denuded of the
Stanford crimson.
The game was finally won by Stanford.
Score 21 to 5. During the game C. C.
Michener, who was playing on first, re
ceived a severe rap over the ri^ht eye,
caused by getting in the way of the ball.
The morning session began by Sher
wood Eddy Instructing the delegates as to
missionary meetings. Their purpose
should be to deepen the spiritual life. For
their success prayer should be made defi
nitely. Plan for the meeting and begin
early.
Mr. Beaver's class then took up the per
sonal case considered, being that of a
young man who did not care to give up
certain plans he had formed as to his life
work. The Bible lesson was on the quali
fications for personal work.
An extra presidents' conference was held
at 10 a. M., in which meeting Mr. Michener
continued the plan which he had partly
given the day before. He laid especial
stres- upon getting the committees to do
their ;ork as it ought to be done, and ad
visedv that the presidents should insist
upon.having written reports from all com
mittt&s.
Thfrn followed the platform address by
SherWood Eddy. Yale '91, on the "Victo
rioug^Life." He likened the three condi
tions, of a man to the Israelites, his
slavery to satan as the bondage of Egypt,
his conversion to the crossing of the
Red Sea, his entrance into tbe larger
life of a Christian as the entrance into
Caanan. What are the conditions
necessary to this victorious life? Faith,
Hudson Taylor says, faith is reclining on
the faithfulness of God. What are the
conditions of abiding in this life? Faith,
obedience, study of the word of God and
prayer. The speaker concluded by sayine:
"Do you want this victorious life? We
are standing to-day at the portal. Do we
want to enter? The promises are sure,
shall we go and possess the land?"
At tne life work meeting under the oak
tree, Mr. Eddy introduced G. M. Fisher
Berkeley. '96, and E. O. Campbell, Cooper
Medical Institute, '96, who gave very
interesting speeches. These remarks we^e
suplemented by Mr. Eddy, who gave an
account of the lives of Alexander Mackay
and A. Judson.
He recounted the lives of these men
with sucii feeling that his hearers forgot
that the sun had gone down over the
mountain, and many afterward crowded
around him desiring to talk with him con
cerning the work.
As the conference progresses the inten
sity and fevor of the meetings increase.
The speakers who come from San Francis
co and Oakland do not speak to very large
audiences up here, but as one of the
speakers said: "I realize that I am not
speaking to a few, but to the biggest audi
ence I have ever spoken to; I am speaking
to many thousands. 1 '
Dr. Coyle gave the principal address to
day, his theme being "The Growth of the
Soul Life." The following is a summary
of it: "Among the New Testament writers
none have so much to say about strength
as Paul. His illusions to atheletics are
many and he above all others realized that
the Christian's fundamental need is
strength. Put on the whole armor of God
is what he expects us to do. On the grave
of a soldier is the following inscription:
Here lies a soldier whom all should applaud
He fought many battles at home and abroad
Bui the greatest of battles without and within
Was the couqest of self and tbe battle of siu.
"This is the kind of fight which is to tax
us to our utmost capacity. We are all
much indebted to external conditions for
our own conditions. It is not the strength
of the prop, but the strength of the sap
which we need. The s erious and never
ceasing aim of our lives should be the ac
quisition of soul. What God gives us we
must develop and work out. He gave the
laud to the Israelites long before they
crossed the boundaries, but they had to
take Jericho and to light tbe Ana'kins be
fore the land was really theirs. When
anything of great importance is given to
us we must acquire it. God has given to uÂ»
souls, but they are not by any means
ready-made products; they must be de
veloped; we must indeed cultivate them.
"What procramme shall we follow out
in order to feed the soul as it grows?
Many have grown coarse and carnal
through improper thinking. Nor can we
grow by choking down our be&t impulses.
A man s first impulse, if he be a man is
usually a good one; the second impulses
are those which do tbe most harm. How
is tbe acquisition to be made? By giving
the heart to GoÂ«i. Then let us live with all
the soul we have. There are people in the
church to-day who Lave no more soul to
day than they had when they entered the
church years ago. The cradle that rocked
them in the babyhood of their spiritual
lives is big enough to rock them to-day. We
can acquire a soul by the cultivation of
generosity. Nothing will so uplift a man
as this will do. The soul grows by what it
feeds upon.
"A poor old negro stepped up to Sher
man just before his march to the sea, and
clapping him on the back said, 'Aha
Massa Sherman, I'se swine whar you go.
Now, if the personality of Sherman could
have such an effect upon a poor old negro,
what must be the effect upon us if we asso
ciate with the Son of God?"
The Bible class to-day was on the "Hin
drances to Personal Work," and each dele
gation was asKed to give that which they
thought hindered them the most. The
thought for to-morrow will be on how to
follow up a successful case of personal
work. Mr. Say ford also spoke on" this
line and gave the following qualifications
as necessary to this work: IâAn1 â An emphatic
belief in God as Father and in God's word,
and in Christ as God's son. 2â Purity of
life, that the workers may have fellowship
with God. 3â To believe that men are lost
now and that Christ carve to save them.
4â Knowledge of the Scriptures to declare
the word. sâ tfaith in the faithfulness of
God to save men.
Dole and Leavitt of Stanford caused
some excitement this afternoon by climb
ing to the top of one of the tallest red*
woods in the glen, a tree about 200 feet
high, and nailing tbe Stanford colors on
the highest limb. Some of the difficulty
attendant upon this feat can be under
stood when we know that it took two
hours to leach the top.
Pomona won the championship in quoits
this afternoon.
At the finish of the ball game this after
noon, Stanford vs. the World, the game
was called off in the second inning with
the World ahead.
Rev. dimming Smith presented tbe
claims of the ministry to-night, showing
its advantages. Dr. Coyle followed with a
few more remarks on the same line, and
the meeting closed for the night.
Mr. McCoy of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association, secretary for San Fran
cisco, will present the claims of the secre
tary to-morrow.
A MINSTREL IS TROUBLE,
Ge+rge B. Primrose Sued in Portland
for $20,000 Damages.
PORTLAND, Ob., May 28.â G. H. Prim
rose of Primrose & West's minstrels, now
here, has a $20, u00 damage suit on his hands
in this city. The complainant in the suit
is Isaac W. Baird, a real-estate dealer of
this city, who was formerly on the road as
a snowman. Baird and Primrose are old
friends. When Primrose was in Portland
a few years ago Baird, who was selling
real estate at the time, induced Primrose
to invest his money in forty acres of land,
which he thought was a good thing to
hnve. Primrose and wife bought the land
and then hired Uaird to clear, cultivate
and crop the land. He did this for two
seasons. The third season a misunder
standing arose between Baird and Prim
rose. The latter ordered the tenant off the
farm and, as the plaintiff says, refused to
settle with him for his year's work in cul
tivating the place. As customary, Baird
began harvesting the crops which were on
the farm. While he was dome this Prim
rose's attorney had Baird arrested for
maliciously tresspassing on the proDerty.
Baird was acquitted and discharged in a
justice's court. Baird calls it ''malicious
and willful injury," with "intent to ma
lign" him in this community.

SANTA CRUZ WILL
TRY TO SURPASS.
Some of the Brilliant Fea
tures of the Water
Carnival.
THE QUEEN AND MAIDS.
A Gorgeous Palace in Course of
Erection on the Island of
Loma Prieta.
COUNTLESS ILLUMINATIONS.
A Mimic Battle of Bunker Hill Will
Be Fought on the San
Lorenzo River.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., May 28.â Santa
Cruz will undertake to surpass all the car
nivals that have this season been held in
the State. This city does not claim supe
riority over San Jose or Santa Barbara or
Los Angeles or any other carnival town in
their special style of carnivils, but for
natural and even artificial advantages in
the production of a water tat nival this
city does claim to be the raosi. happily sit
uated. Beautiful Belvedere might even
be surpassed in that respect, for in the
turning of the shallow waters of the San
Lorenzo River back from escape into the
ocean by an artificial dam there has been
produced a fine lake of water with a nat
ural island, the position of which is such
as to be seen from the amphitheater on
the mainland. Beyond to the right is the
open bay, to the left a portion of the city,
while in the perspective and far beyond
rises the beautiful mountain with its
pretty name â Loma Prieta â and the con
necting hills that form the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
On this island will stand the palace to
be occupied by the Queen of the Venetian
water carnival and her maids of honor.
This structure will have an imposing
frontage of 80 feet and rise to a height of
54 feet. An American eagle will perch
upon the topmost point, and beneath his
spread wings and on either side, within
and without the palace, the brilliancy of
300 incandescent electric lamps will shine
in van-colors, enabling the audience to
discern the fullness of the grandeur that
shall be presented. The finishing of the
building will be done in blue and cream
and pold, while the Queen's throne will be
equally attractive in construction and
finish. On the up-river side of the palace
will stand three large vases containing
tropical plants, alternated with electrical
fountains, whose colorings will lend an
effective contrast to the general view of
the palace. On the down-river side there
will stand a facsimile in illustrative lights
and colors of Roncovieri's "Carnival
March," to be played by that leaner and
his 100 musicians.
The Queen's barge is to be Â» piece of
art indeed. William Lemos, the de
signer of all these interesting and beauti
ful structures, has surpassed his own an
ticipations in this attempt to do an
artistic thing. The pink and white culor
inps of the vessel are enhanced in their
splendid effects by trimmings of gold and
silver. The illumination from the thou
sands of electric lights along the river
and surrounding the palace will produce a
wonderful *>ff ct as the Queen shall be
carried along the smooth waters to and
from her palace by the galley slaves, who
shall sit at their oars belnw deck.
The battle of Bunker Hill will be the
introductory feature of the grand events
of the carnival, as the season opens on the
day of the anniversary of that bit of Revo
lutionary history that recalls the great
struggle of the first fathers of the Union.
Tbe mimic battle that is to be presented on
the San Lorenzo River on the night of
June 17 will bo a very realistic reproduc
tion of the event, for the Continentals and
the Britishers will be represented by men
used to arms. The Grand Army of the
Republic will impersonate the land fight
ers, who will stand by their fortifications
bravely enough, but in vain. The British
ers, a portion of whom will skirmish in
the neighborhood of the American strong
hold, and the main body of the navy that
awaits at a point \ip the river a favorable
opportunity of attack, will be imperson
ated by the fourth gun division, Naval
Battalion, N. G. C, of this city. There
will be no red lights and skyrockets in
this battle. It will be a real gun-and
powder fight by men well drilled and
armed.
This is only the beginning of the grand
Venetian Water Carnival. The succeed
ing events and the features of them will
be as attractive and interesting as the first..
EDITORS STILL FIGHTING.
Phil Franci* Catlfol Ed Brnun'a Arrest
for Criminal Libel.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., May 28.â Ed Braun,
editor of the Record, was to-day arrested
on a charge of criminal libel preferred by
Phil Francis, editor of the Perm y Press.
On last Sanday Francis printed an edi
torial, in which he presented an interview
with C. W. Waldron, business raansger of
the Sentinel, in which Francis claimed
that Waldron had exposed to him the
scheme by which tbe county was charged
an exorbitant, price for printing by a com
bination of the Sentinel, Surf and Record,
and offered to take Francis into the ring.
In Monday afternoon's Record Braun
charged Francis with being a thief, and by
the malicious billingsgate of his writing
caused public sentiment to turn more
strongly against him. The result is to
day's suit for libel. Braun is under $1000
bonds to appear before Justice Gardner for
preliminary examination.
CONTESTED ELECTION.
Decision in the Case of Santa Crum's City
Clerk.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal.. May 28.â 1n the
contested election case of J. L. Wright,
City Clerk, Jud^e Logan of the Superior
Court to-day held that O. J. Lincoln,
whose claim to re-election was contested
by W. H. Miller, was not properly a candi
date under the law, as his nomination had
not been properly certified and he had not
appointed the requisite five persons "to
secure and expend the moneys for his elec
tion. But the matter of recounting the
ballots the court took under advisement,
holding, h on ever, that If it should be
necessary to recount and Wright were
shown to have the minority of votes thero
would have been no election, and another
would have <i> be hpld.

months, and who was sentenced to a term
of five years at Walla Walla, will regain

nished by a number of his friends to-day
who have heretofore kept in the back
ground. Boggs was arrested for embez

CORBETT AT SALT LAKE,
The Ex-Champion Is Not Certain
That He Will Visit San
Francisco.
On His Way to Portland and Will
Eventually Follow Fitzsimmons
to Europe.
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah. May 28.-
Jam s J. Corbett has been in the city for a
day and the male portion of the town
made him the lion of the hour. Corbett
is looking first rate and Is apparently
in fine condition, though not quite so
heavy as heretofore. His shoulders are
just as broad, however, and be has the
same genial manner as when he used to do
California street as a bank clerk in the old
days. The Call correspondent was one
of the first people to meet the "big fellow"
and a pleasant interview of an hour or so
was enjoyed. He was asked particularly
if he would be willing to box a twenty
round contest with Joe Choynski at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco, but he
laughingly replied:
"I don't know about that; maybe I
won't go to San Francisco at all, but may
return from Portland, my movements' are
so uncertain. Still I am trying to get
home. A fellow wants to see his folks
once in a while, and you know San Fran
cisco is my home and I like the place as
much as ever, and that's a good deal.
"Oh, yes, if the Olympic Club boys
should have a single friendly bout I might
not be averse to joining in the event, out
it is impossible to say at this time."
Cor bett says he is going to follow Fitz
siiumons to Europe. Brady is there now,
he says, and will try to arrange a match.
He is accompanied by his wife and Miss
Esther Corbett and leaves to-night for the
West by way of Portland.

FRIDAY.. MAY S9, 1898
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The whole world seems to be a death
center.
So long as justice is mocked at there will
be crime.
The roarine cyclone is a calamity howler
of the worst kind.
Murder is becoming a little too common
even for sensational purposes.
The disasters of the season are appall
ing, but the crimes are more terrible.
With all our public teaching wÂ« should
teach the criminal to respect the majesty
of law.
Crimes, cyclones and disasters are mak
ing mystery stories seem very tame
reading.
It may be true we are approaching the
millennium, but we seem to be goin^ the
other, way.
We are sorry for the people of the windy
States, but all the same they ought to
come 'West.
A climate that breeds a cyclone every
week would seem to be a very good climate
to get away from.
St. Louis boasted that everything is
coming her way this year, but she did not
count on the cyclones.
After the news of the last three days
Â«?ven a Cleveland message would be a relief
is a change of subject.
"Why call it the "carnival" of the Golden
Gate when festival is just as fine a word
and fits the occasion better?
It is about time to revive the expression
"carmagnole of crime" and relieve the
strain on the over-used carnival.
It is about time to remember that courts
were established for the protection of the
innocent and not the acquittal of the
guilty.
The next time Chicago brags of her big
fire St. Louis wili tell her of a wina that
could have blown it out like a tallow
candle.
There will be no need of a schoolteacher
after this to teach Victoria there is such a
thing as too much economy in bridge
building.
Between the administration and the
people there is great difference of opinion
as to what is meant by "offensive parti
sanship."
No enterprising journalist ever thinks it
worth while to ask a Democratic Presi
dential candidate what his position Is on
any subject.
It is hard to believe just at this season
that this is the best of all possible worlds,
but all the same no one now living has
ever seen a better one.
It goes without saying if the stricken
districts need help to care for their suffer
ing people, San Francisco can be counted
on to respond promptly.
Half the Democratic organs which are
making so much clamor over McKinley's
views on the financial question could not
explain their own if they tried.
Democratic sentiment at Washington is
said to favor Russell of Massachusetts,
and it may be inferred from this that the
administration hoodoo is about to fall on
him.
The East can never check the disasters
of windstorms, but onr recent calamities
have been murders, and there ought to be
a way of getting a string on the cause of
them that would shut it off.
There is nothing of Democracy visible
in this City just now but tbe Federal bri
gade and the Buckley gang, and if there
is anything of it invisible it must be up
the sleeve of one side or the ether.
Maryland Democrats have about aban
doned all thought of defeating the Repub
licans of the State in this campaign, but
the more independent among them have
great hopes of being able to turn Gorman
down again.
The best way to assure party harmony
during tbe campaign is to organize at once.
When men are working together for a
common purpose they soon learn to agree
upon a plan to carry it out, but when they
are not working they are very apt to de
velop differences of opinion and begin dis
puting.
Senator Brice is quoted as sayirjg that
while there may be a majority of silver
men in the Chicago convention there will
be no silver plank in the platform. The
Senator evidently believes that in the
haid of the statesman who is truly great
the gold dollar is mightier than the dele
gate.
Having put all his henchmen into office
and being now about to go out of oiiice
himself, Cleveland's recent civil service
order was about the biggest bunko game
ever played upen the American people.
The issue of such an order was in fact
"offensive partisanship" of the worst kind.
It was an effort to thwart the popular de
mand "turn the fools out."
SOCIETY AND CRIME.
A study of the criminal statistics of Eu
rope led Buckle to assert that the law of
crime was as regular in its operations as
any other in tLe domain of sociology. A
given environment produces in a given
race of people a number of crimes every
year that fluctuates hardly more than the
death rate. It seems evident from this
that crime is not the freak of irresponsible
individuals so much as the outcome of
social conditions. Where it occurs fre
quently there is something wrong in the
community as a whole as well as in the
criminal class.
It is time for the people of California to
give serious consideration to this philo
sophic view of crime. There has been
enough of horror of recent occurrence in
this State and particularly in this City to
force the subject upon the attention of
even the most indifferent. Murder after
murder has occurred with an appalling
frequency. It has fallen upon the inno
cent under the most diverse circumstances
and in the extremes of social conditions.
Oue day the victim is tbe degraded in
mate of a brothel and another day she is a
woman of gentle breeding and high char
acter. One day murder slinks through
the slums of the City and on another it
ragea through tbe orchards of smiling
valleys.
What is the cause of this fearful record
of frequent crime? Are we to attribute it
to the madness of men racing with a
homicidal maniaâ a thing that can be
checked only by the interposition of
heaven â or are we to regard it as the dire
outcome of certain defects in our social
organism which we can cure ourselves if
we are resolute to do it?
There can be no question in the minds
of serious men that much of the crime
that occurs in this State is the direct re
sult of evils which as a community we
deliberately tolerate. The processes of
our criminal law are slow, and are by no
means certain in their results. Juries
with us are too often swayed by sentiment
rather than by justice. A thousand tech
nicalities of precedent and practice check
the execution of law, and justice, with the
best intentions in the world to draw her
sword for the protection of the innocent,
finds her hands bound by such endless
bands of red tape that she is as powerless
as if under a hypnotic ppell.
With such calendars of crime as are now
before them the law officers of the State
should need no urging to enter upon the
work of vindicating justice with an ex
alted ardor. District Attorneys and
Judges should set aside civil business and
press criminal cases to an immediate hear
ing. The law must be swift if it would be
terrible. It should not be vindictive, but
it should be free from false sentiment. It
should "allow no guilty man to escape."
It should hold every murderer responsible
for his crime and summon him to imme
diate trial. There may be some insanity
in every wanton criminal, but tueVe is
more in a community that allows crime to
go unwhipt of justice.
OUR STORM-SWEPT NEIGHBORS.
This is no time to attempt to trace from
effect to cause in search of purpose nor to
speculate on sucn operation of natural law
as changes with blunt abruptness air cur
rents tnat bear to man peace and health
and joy into merciless life-destroying
agencies. It is enough to know that
storm-swept communities of onr kinsmen
in St. Louis and elsewhere in the East are
crying out in their distress for sympathy,
and in streams as broad and as deep us
human affection sympathy goes out to
them from the heart of every Californian â
to these victims of angry winds and waves
and flames.
May has been a month of dire disaster,
and many are the neighborhood!, urban
ana subnrban, that have been forced to
submit to the fury ot unbridled storm,
and death and wreck and ruin have
reigned supreme â not because a power
higher than they decreed that it so be, nor
that the vengeance of nature was invited.
The mysteries of nature are in the realm
of the unknown and no man by searching
shall find them ont. The purposes of the
Eternal Mind are all for good and what
ever is is.
The rushing of the mighty winds that
sweep away the handiwork of man and the
gentle atmosphere that fans the infant's
cheek are one, as the fury of the rushing
torrent and the mildness of the moss-en
circled spring are, and so also are the
breeze that bears away the sweet perfume
of the orange blossom and the mad-riding
tornado one. They are all manifestations
of one supreme force and they all work to
gether for good.
It has been said that but for those things
which crush and destroy and kill there
would be no human sympathy; that trib
ulation is the cord which binds man to
man in good will, and that a sense
of the need of th c help of our
fellows is the seed of the tree of
righteousness which in turn bears the
fruit that is called the Golden Rule. But
we do know that in the economy of na
ture's ultimate purpose our neighbors be
yond the mountains lie bound in the
gloom of bereavement. Let us without
the asking extend to them our deepest
sympathy and our best wishesâ and our
strong arm, too, with ready help if they
need it.
SOME IMPORTANT FACTS.
Undoubtedly it is of great importance to
the Western wool-producing States that
silver be remonetized, but they should not
lose sight of the importance of restoring
their sheep industry to the position it oc
cupied prior to the substitution of the Wil
boii act for the tariff law of 1890. There
are so many large and commanding indus
tries in the United States that it is hard
for the public to keep sufficiently in touch
with them all to note the injuries that are
inflicted upon those that are removed be
yond the more prominent highways of ob
servation, so to speak ; but it is true, never
theless, that the havoc Cleveland's free
trade policy "has wrought among those
outlying sources of National wealth has
not only been great, but it has, silently it
may be, woven threads of inherent weak
ness all through the entire industrial fab
ric of the country.
When President Harrison vacated the
White House to make room for Grover
Cleveland, the sheep industry of Montana,
Idaho, Washington, Utah and Oregon was
valued at $13,000,<X>0, and before the ex
piration of the following twelve months it
had decreased to less than $7,000,000. To
this loss of nearly a half in sheep value
must be added $3,000,000 as represent
ing the depreciation in the value of
wool, making the grand total of the
losses forced upon the wool industry
of tbe five States mentioned mount
up to the enormous Bum of $10,000,000 in a
single year. It will be seen, hence, that
those five wool-producing States have
quite as much interest in the tariff ques
tion as they have in the question of the
remonetization of silver, and what is true
of them is equally true of the entire coun
try between the Mississippi River and the
Pacific Ocean. The sheep industry is nec
essarily an isolated one, but it is none the
less important, and every person who uses
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 29, 1896.
woolen goods is at least indirectly inter
ested in it.
But if we turn to the statistics we shall
find that when Grover Cleveland was in
augurated, on March 4, 1893, there were
nearly 48,000,000 sheep scattered over the
United States, representing $126,000,000,
and that on December 31, 1895, there were
about 42,000,000, valued at only $66,000,000.
In two years, therefore, the sheep industry
waa compelled to sustain a loss of over
5,000,000 head of sheep and a loss in sheep
value of over ?G0,000,000, besides the losb
which the depreciation in wool value
cbliged. In this connection it is timely
to mention the surprising as weli as
alarming fact that the depreciation in
livestock value in the whole country in the
years 1893, 1394 and 1895 amounted to the
almost fabulous sum of $064,000,000. How
much other industries have lost since
March, 1893, no one can tell, but to say
that Cleveland has been and is still a most
destructive cyclone in the channels, high
ways and by-paths of the commerce and
industries of this country would not be
putting it a whit too strong.
CONTRASTED REPORTS.
The reports of the great disaster at St
Louis afforded another illustration of the
superiority of the United Press as a news
gatherer over the rival Associated Press.,
The dispatches of the United Press were
displayed on the bulletin boards of The
Call fully an hour earlier than our con
temporaries showed those of the Asso
ciated Press, and moreover those of The
Call were much more full and complete.
Promptness of service and fullness of
report were not, however, the only points
of superiority in the United Press service.
Its reports were accurate, while those of
the Associated Press were full of sensa
tional misstatements and errors of fact.
They announced among other fakes that
several towns had been wiped out of ex
istence, that the steamer Qreat Republic
with about 1000 passengers had been sunk
and that a cigarette factory had been
destroyed, overwhelming 200 girls in the
ruins. The damage done was bad
enough without all of these rumored
horrors piled on top of it, as waa seen in
accurate reports sent by the United Press
to The Call, and the incident is an evi
dence of the value to the community of
having at least one mornins paper whose
news can be relied on.
HYPOCRITICAL REFORM.
The full test of Cleveland's recent civil
service order shows it to be much stronger
and more sweeping than was supposed
from the digest sent by telegraph. It will
affect nearly the whole Federal brigade in
this City and go far to confirm in otiicethe
i whole horde of Democrats whom Cleve-
I land has been gathering into his camp
j during the past three years.
Never has a greater bunko game been
played under the garb of hypocrisy in the
whole course of politics than this. For
three years Cleveland has been President
of the United States, and he is now ap
j proaching the close of his term of office,
I with no chance of ever having another.
! lie made no move to extend the civil-serv
ice rules when such extension would have
put any restrictions on his use of patron
age to advance his interests or those of his
friends. On the contrary he used the in
fluence of patronage to an extent unheard
of before. It has been one of the great
scandals of his administration that he so
used it to carry through Congress the re
peal of the silver purchase act. This
patronage broker now becomes all at once
a civil service reformer. His henchmen
are safely in office, and witn a smirk of
hypocrisy he assume* now to play the
role of one who wishes to free our politics
of the "spoils" system.
Such an order coming at such a time
from such a man has of course moved the
people to derision and dingrn. There is
not an intelligent man in the country who
has been deceived by it. The motive of
Cleveland has, in fact, been too plain for
any one to make a mistake, lie has
turned the whole civil service of the coun
try into a bureau for the propagation
of Clevelandism ana the gold standard.
He has his bosses and his gangs
at this time trying to captnre the Demo
cratic State conventions for the gold ring,
and yet he has the impudence to pose as a
reformer. Such civil service regulation as
this proposes can hardly be esteemed any
thing else than "offensive partisanship"
itself, and should be treated as such. The
duty of the people is to turp the fools out.
CHANG AND CLEVELAND.
In one respect there is a great similarity
between Li Hung Chang and Grover Cleve
land. When en route to Moscow Chang
left his coffin in London. When Chang
goes off on a long journey he takes his
colHn with him, because, no doubt, it
would be "handy to have in the house," as
Mrs. Toodles would say. There is a good
deal of politics mixed up in Chang's jour
neyings, and political as physical death is
likely to occur at almost any time.
Cleveland's political coflin is under con
struction and will be escorted to Chicago by
Boies and Bland in July. Unlike Chang,
however, who has had no intimation that
he will need his coffin in the near future,
Cleveland Knows exactly the day on which
he will need his box.
But in any event Cleveland will have the
advantage of Chang. He will have the
satisfaction of seeirg his party similarly
cared for. He knows, too, that the estate

that human slavery in the United States

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Among those who registered at the Grand
Hotel yesterday was ex-Supcrlor Judge R. J.
Hudson of Lakeport. Mr. Hudson was on the
Superior bench in Lake County for eleven
years. He is here on legal business.
When a Call representative saw him yester
day the ex-Judge was lyiug propped up in bad.
He had ridden all night over a wagon road, he
said, in order to catch tbe train and felt con
siderably shaken np on account of it.
He says tbe latest enterprise in that part of
the State and one which has In tbe last few
days aroused a great deal of interest is the or
ganization of a company on the basis of $1,
-000,000 to build a railroad from Napa via
Pope and Coyote valleys to Lakeport, using the
watersof Clear Lake to develop the electric
power necessary to run it.
"Though the capitalization is $1,000,000,"
Ex-Superior Judge Hudson of Lakeport on the New Railroad, Kush of Tourists
end Latest Suit Against the Southern Pacific.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
said he, "it Is thought it will take about $1,
-500.000 to build it. Richard Wiley of Napa,
Â£. Clendenin, Tax Collector of Lake County,
and Captain J. K. Fraser of Big Valley, Lake
County, are among the incorporators.
"I understand they had offers of all the East
ern money they want to complete the road. A
meeting of the officials was held the other day.
"There is a great surplus of water in Clear
Lake. It rises every winter eight or ten feet
and the proposition is to use it to develop elec
trical power as it falls.
"There Is so much of this power that it is
proposed to sell it to San Francisco, Oakland
and other cities. There is an enormous
amount of power there going to waste all the
time, fhe road proposed will be of great value
to the people.
"The frost has affected the fruit some in
Lake County, but rot to the extent that it has
in some of the adjoiuiug counties. It is ex
pected that there will be a fair crop. The
grain looks exceedingly well, especially wheat
and barley, which will be a big crop.
"Lake County resorts are now filling up with
people from Pan Francisco and elsewhere.
There are hundreds of them up there already.
"I came down on some important legal busi
ness; namely, in the case of Chris S. Studer of
Cordelia, Solano County, against the Southern
Pacific Company, for killing his child in July
last, at Cordelia, on the line of the California
Pacitic Railroad, between Vacaville and
Suisnn.
"The little fellow, who was but 12 years old,
climbed up between two flatcars of a freight
train standing on the track. He, it seems,
stood on the coupling, and when the cars
backed one of his feet was crushed and the
child died. The bell was not rung, nor was
there a warning of any kind, so that the little
fe\low might know what was going to be done.
"We are suing for $25,000 damages. It is to
be tried before Superior Judge A. J. Buckles of
Solano County on Jane 3."
Ex-Judge Hudson will be in this City seven
or eight days.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
COST OF THE GOLD RESERVE.
One Good Reason for the Existence of
the People's Party.
Editor San Frandtco Callâ Sir: The extent to
which the oeople of this country are beginning
to understand the false pretenses and down
right iniquities of our present financial sys
tem may be inferred from the reading of the
following editorial article clipped from a San
Francisco daily newspaper which has never
been accused of having any sympathy or even
patience with the Populist or People's party
view of the nature and function of money:
Some one ought to teach Mr. Carlisle how to do
a simple sum in Interest, and then supply him
with brains or honesty enough to appreciate Its
significance. If the proposed Issue of $100,000,000
or 4 per cents Is made, the sum total of Interest
bearing securities issued for the ostensible purpose
of maintaining the gold reserve will be *363,
-000,000. Roughly speaking, these bonds will cost
the people In the form of interest about $350,-
That is to say, for the purpose of maintaining a
reserve to keep $346,000,000 of greenbacks from
going to a discount the Government Is going to ex
pend $4,000,000 more than it would take to redeem
them outright, and then, after having done no, re
turn to tint holders of the bonds a sum nearly
double the amount of outstanding greenbacks.
As the ostensible purpose of obtaining the gold
was to keep the greenbacks from going to a dis
count, and, as since the issuance of the bonds the
Secretary of the Treasury ban been steadily with
drawing greenbacks from circulation, wonld it not
have served tbe sumo purpose and have been In
finitely cheaper to have retired the greenbacks
permanently by increasing the re Venue sufficiently
to compel their automatic return to the treasury. .
But that would not have | suited the all-street
contingent, and so we are treated Ito the farce of
buying gold with Interest-paying bonds for the
purpose of maintaining the credit of a currency
which is tightly locked up in the treasury and not
permitted to circulate. r ,
Before proceeding to make any comments on
the above exposure of the cost of the gold re
serve and the folly of maintaining it, I may as
well confess that for many years I was a pro
found admirer of John Sherman, the author of
the gold-reserve method of ' maintaining the
honor and impeccability of the greenback, re
garding him as the greatest financier of
modern times, and once wanted to vote for
him for President of the United States; and I
was proud as a peacock to think that our
Nation was so great and so opulent tnat we
could keep a hundred millions In gold lying in
the vaults of the Government treasury to re
deem at a moment's notice its paper green
backs and thus keep them - always at j a parity
with the ; yellow â¢ gold. n At that . time 1 was a
full believer.with a large majority of my coun
trymen. In . what we : fondly called "the best
financial system in the world," . and we de
lighted to honor John Sherman as the father
of that wonderful system. â¢. --:-â *-â 
One day my faith in that system and in John
Sherman was rudely shaken. A man for whom
I bad great respect, before he became a
"crank" on the tiuancial question by joining
the Farmers' Alliance, challenged me* to read
alittiebook written by Mrs. Emory, bearing
the title of "Seven Financial Conspiracies."
That little book utterly destroyed my faith in
John Sherman by a merciless exposure of the
delusive fallacies of his financial system. The
hypnotic spell un-ler which I was led to ad
mire him and applaud his financial system
soon passed away, aud In due time, after
fanner investigation of the money question,
not from the banker's point of view, but as
one of the people dependent upon dealers la
money who control the money market, I too,
became, though quite reluctantly, a Populist
and a financial "crank" and caught the
"craze," some five years ago, when it was not
quite as pleasant to be known as a Populist as
it is now.
While hypnotized, as many thousands still
are, by idolizing gold as a "redeemer" of paper
money it never occurred to me that the beauti
ful and fascinating hundred millions in good
yellow gold held as a reserve for the "redemp
tion" of greenbacks which nobody wanted re
deemed for twenty years, had been bought
with greenbacks or promises to pay in coin,
the only difference in fact being that green-
I backs called "bonds" bore interest and the
i other greenbacks bore no interest. Yes, there
I was another difference â the greenback
"bonds." wtre nearly all of high denomina
tion!'â $500. $1000, *10,000â aud did not cir
culate as money. In other respects both
bonds a'ul greenbacks are just the same.
They rest on the same basis or securityâ that
is, the promise and faith of the Nation, backed
by the taxing power of Congress, which ex
tends to every dollar's worth of property and
even to the toil of seventy millions of people
in these United States. He"nee the greenbacks
were just as good as the bonus, and even bet
ter, for they were a prior lien or first mortgage
on all of Uncle Sam's property and were,
moreover, due and payable before a single
bond was issued.
Not to make this letter too long, let us call it
a first installment on the bond question, while
the reader ruminates a little on the figures
given in the clipping above quoted from an or
thodox newspaper which seems to be getting
"onto" Sherman's little joker of the gold re
serve. JoPKTH ABBTTST Johnson.

LADY'S WAIST WITH FITTED
SLEEVE AND YOKE FRONT.
An exquisitely dainty gown is illustrated be
low. It is of white and black striped silk. The
battlemented yoke is edged with narrow black
velvet. The frill is white mousseline de soie
with black dots. A ruffle of this is also set in
the top of the collar, which, like the belt, is of
shaded green ribbon. This belt is one of the
latest fancies, being much wider than those
lately worn, wrinkled about the form and
ending In bows in the back.
A striped lawn made after this model was
very pretty and exceedingly stylish, for the
new sleeves and beit with the novel yoke front
make it exceedingly striking.
A gown of brown canvas cloth over a shot
blue and green silk lining had the yoke of
white satin covered with lace. The belt aud
collar were of the green and blue silk, with a
frill of the same lace at the top of collar.
The waist fastens in the center front, the
yoke aud collar hooking on the leftside. There
is a fitted lining which may be omitted for
wash dresses, cutting the gathered one, sewing
it to yoke and fastening at under arm seam. A
Fhn How facing cut after lining makes the stay
to which sleeve is sewn.
The skirt has eleven gores, which is specially
adapted for silk or goods only twenty-two
inches wide.

Some remains of the wrecked steamer
City of New York are at last to be put
to use. When the vessel went on the
rocks at Point Bonita years ago no one
ever thought she would be a total wreck.
As it was she broke in twain and was
given over to the wreckers. In the at
tempt to save the machinery Whitelaw
lost the Samson and later on the wreck
ing steamer Whitelaw went ashore and
became a total loss. Since then he has
built another wrecker and another wreck
ing steameT. Both these are now in use
raising the Blairmore.
Before the old Whitelaw was lost she
had recovered from the rocks oft Point
Bonita the machinery and boilers of tbe
->ew York. These were brought ashore
and lay for months on section 3 of the.
seawall, l^atterly the boilers found a
purchaser, and now they are O be used as
oil tanKs to carry crude petroleum between
Baja and Alta Cautornia.
The longest tank is forty-two feet long
and nine feet in diameter, it holds 2500
gallons of oil. The smaller tank holds
about 1600 gallons, ana is forty feet long
and seven feet in diameter. They are now
lying on Howard-street wharf, and to
morrow they will be placed on the lighter
and taken to Lower California.
Besides the tanks there will be two long
square boilers that were purchased at the
last Mare Island sale. These will hold
1400 gallons, and are made out of old
plates that were bought from Uncle Sam.
Half a dozen boilers supplied the plates,
as seme of ihe tanks purchased were use

were used and the worn out ones discarded

The work of raising the Blairmore is

ZIEGLER LAID
HAWKINS LOW,
A Spirited Eight-Round Go
at the People's
Palace.
HAWKINS' GAME FIGHT
His Style Better, but He Was
Not So Strong a
Fighter.
THE REFEREE HIT BY K^LLY.
Danny Mahoney and Joe Sullivan Put
Up Six Rounds to a
Draw.
The Shannon benefit at the People's Pal
ace last evening opened with a six-round
contest between Danny Mahoney and Joe
Sullivan. According to the fi3tic bill of
fare the referee waa to give a decision "on
points," but when the bout came to an
end Henry Peppers, who was selected to
referee the match, stated that the contest
ants had agreed before entering the rinc
that, if both men were fighting at the ter
mination of the sixth round, the contest
should be declared a draw. Mahoney had
unquestionably the best of the argument
in every round, but Peppers, acting under
instructions, called the match a draw.
The event of the evening followed this.
It was an eight-round contest between
Oweu Ziegler of Philadelphia and Dal
Hawkins of San Francisco.
After Sergeant Burdsell examined and
weighed the mittens the fight went on.
Hawkins was esquired by Tim McGrath
and "Spider" Kelly. His opponent, Zieg
ler. was looked after by George Allen of
Chicago, H. Kennedy of Philadelphia and
Frank Hanoi New York.
The referee selected was Ed Homan, but
as that distinguished sporting man and
retired champion boxer had some impor
tant business downtown and did not ar
rive in due time, Jimmy Carrol!, the pop
ular light-weight boxer, was chosen-
It was 11 o'ciock when the event of the
evening was cal.ed. Ziegler appeared in
splendid trim. He weighed 138 pounds
j and his opponent, Hawkins, tipped the
I scales at 131 pounds. Ziegler looked much
lareer than the San Francisco lad and I
was certainly more powerful.
When the boxers toed the scratch it
could be seen at a glance that the Phila
delpliian meant business. He did not de
lay in fiddling ai,d prospecting for the un
guarded spots of his antagonist, but sailed
right in for buni^ess. The first rush he
made at Hawkins gave the latter a sur
prise. In the language of the sports Haw
kins found that he waa up against bard
| game
Ziegler made a desperate attempt to
break Hawkins' neck by swinging his big
j right fi>t at Hawkins' left ear. Th<.- laffo'r
I cleverly ducked "the duke," but was sent
j to his knees the next instant by a snmvh
on tbe shoulder. Ziegler sent out a very
fast and wicked pace, but several of his
blows missed Hawkins and spent them
selves on the smoky atmosphere.
Dal very fortunately for himself got
away from right and left swings any of
which would have sent him to dreamland
had they landed on the "killing" spot.
Ziegler's wild rushes were checked tow
ard the end of the round, when Hawkins
took immediate advantage of a good open
ing and sent the rushing Eastener into
tbe ropes with a right o. the jaw which
was a little bit too high to bring flattering
results to the puncher.
Zeigler was up in a jiffy, and although
he landed several stiff punches on Haw
kins' face and body the latter stood the
gruflling and retired to his corner when
time was called wondering what would
come next. The round was short about
thirty seconds of the actual timeâ three
minutes.
In the second round Ziegler dashed at
his game like a wild bull, and in hffl
awkward way actually Hung right and left
banders at liltle Dal. Everybody ex
pected to see Hawkins' head rull off the
but in this they were disappointed.
Ziegler's blows frequently fell short, but
the ones that landed made Hawkins look
decidedly scasc
The clever San Franciscan puzzled Zieg
ler by his quickness in getting away from
blows which would certainly have ended
the mill had any of them struck the right
spot. Hawkins frequently stopped Ziegler
with good straight lefts and an occa
eional ri^ht on the neck, which the
"hurricane" of Philadelphia did not iancv.
In the third round Hawkins staggered '
Zie^lcr with a back-hander on the chin, I
but Ziegler returned tbe compliment soon
afterwards with a left-hand swini; which
caught Hawkins in the pit of the stomacli.
Huwkin:- planted two hard straight left
handers on Zeigler's nose just before tbe
call of time.
In the fourth round Ziegler rushed
Hawkins to his corner and landed
three blows on Dai's face, This was fol
lowed by a rally, in which Hawkins
missed a wicked right at Ziegler's nei-k
and received a jolt on the jaw, which
staggered him. Ziegler rnsherl wildly at
Hawkins and made desperate attempts to
knock tbe San Franciscan out, but failed.
Hawkins certainly had the short end of
this round.
Hawkins, to the surprise of the specta
tors, had the best of the fifth round. Zieg
ler was pretty well exhausted from the
wild attempts he made in the previous
round to knock his opponeut out, and
Hawkins, after landing three telling left
handers on Ziegler's face, got home one of
his favorite righthanders on Ziegler's jaw
which sent the receiver staggering against
the ropes.
Ziegler made several vain attempts to
catch Hawkin's necK with wild swings,
but fell short in each attempt. The round
ended with wild cheers for Dal.
Just before the call of time for the sixth
round Jimmy Carroll, the referee, "smelt
a mice," and quickly stepped over to
Ziegler's corner for the purpose of examin
ing bisgioves.
He found that the padding of the gloves
was removed, and after arranging the mit
tens he cautioned Ziegler not to try the
old game a second time. The referee did
the same to HawkinÂ«, and Sergeant Bird
sell told Carroll if any such funny business
was tried a second time he would stop the
contest.
In the sixth round Hawkins was knocked
down by a glancing blow. Ziogler. who
was fighting with his usual wickedness,
had the best of the round, as Hawkins at
this point was growing rapidly weak.
In the seventh and eighth rounds Zieg
ler landed most blows. Hawkins fought a
very game battle, but he was naudicapped
in weight and strength. His style of
fighting was much prettier than
Ziegler's, but then the Phila<lelphian
was the aggressor all through the
game, and as he landed the most
blows throughout, the referee awarded him
the match, which decision, notwithstand
ing the protests of the friends of the game
and clever Hawkins, was perfectly right
and proper.
When tbe referee was leaving the ring
"Spider" Keilv rushed at him and
smashed Carroll a right on the neck. It
was a dastardly trick, and Kelly should
have received the pur.ishme..t he deserves
by being placed in jail. Such conduct
spoils the sport of fisticuffs.
ALLOWED THREE PERMITS
Supervisors Take Full Charge
ot the Boxing Enter^
tainments.
Two Future Events Scheduled by the
National Cub Canceled by
the Board.
Tde Board of Supervisors held a special
session yesterday afternoon to consider
the permits for- boxing entertainments
recently issued by acting Mayor Taylor.
| At the last meeting of the Doard a reso
lution was adopted taking tbe power of
erantinp permits out of the hands of the
i Mayor and placing ii in the hands of the
i Doard and revoking those alreaay granted.
I Then there was wild scurrying among the
! managers of the Hawkins-Zeigler contest
: that took place last evening to get the
board to hold a special session so that the
contest could be brought off, lor much
money had already been expended in the
way of expenses and any delay might
mean a big loss. They managed to secure
| nsmf? enough for the calling of a special
session and thus saved the day. Super
! visors Dimond, Benjamin, Scully, King,
I Morjranstcrn, NVagr.er ;;:id Dunker were
present, with acting Mayor Tavlor in tbe
chair.
Supervisor Dimond was in favor of al
lowing the permits already issued to stand,
as those to whom they had been issued
bad expended considerable money in good
faith. Mr. Taylor wanted to know
whether the passage of the resolution was
intended as a reflection on the Mayor and
was assured by a number of those present
that no such" thought had entered their
heads while voting on the order.
Alter some discussion it was decided to
allow the permit for last night's entertain
ment, that ot the Manhattan Club for to
night and that of the National Club on
June 3 to stand on account of the exp nses
incurred by the managers of the institutu
tions.
The prrmits for two National Cub
nights billed for Jrly and August were
canceled, though they may be reissued if
toe board sees fit.
Supervisor Dimond and acting Mayor
Taylor voted against the cancellation of
any permits already issued.

SOME VAGARIES
OF THE TRANSFERS.
Passengers Carried Far Be
yond the Nearest Trans
ferring Point.
RIDE ON OR PAY AGAIN.
Everything Possible Is Done to
Avoid Accommodating the
Passengers.
A PRIVILEGE TO BE CURTAILED
Peculiarities on the Fourth, Devisa
dero and Filimore Street
Lines.
The street railway system of San Fran
cisco was at one time, and that was only a
few years ago, one that attracted the'at
tention of all strangers who visited the
City and caused them to remark, "San
Francisco has tbe most complete and least
intricate streetcar system in the Unit: d
States." But since E. P. Vining, manager
of the Market-street system, has been at
the head of affairs, he has tinkered with
that system until now Ec has succeeded in
making it the most complex of any. The
residents are scarcely able to understand
it and strangers are unable to make it out.
True, on the inside and outside of the
windows of t^e cars and on the doors at
each cud there are posters relating to
transfers that are so long that it takes a
person some time to comprehend when,
where and under what circumstances tbe
privilege of hopping out of one car and
nopping on to another may be exercised.
To the passenger who is unused to the
peculiar methods of the particular line
upon which he is riding these are practi
cally useless for the reason that before he
can have an opportunity to even read
these rules so wonderfully made up the
conductor approaches with "Fare, please;
want a transfer?" snd often contents him
self with "Fare, please."
The poster in small letters tells the pas
senger that he must "ask for a transfer
upou settling for his fare.' hut if he fails
to do so, either from ignorance or forget
fulnesÂ«, he finds that when he does want a
transfer he is barred from that right, and
if he wants to go on his journey he must
p.ij' another nickel, for by the order of Mr.
Vining no transfer must be issued unless
asked for at the time the fare is paid.
The system that now prevails has been,
aiid still is, the source ot a great
deal of annoyance to the lady pas
sengers, who do net sit up nights to famil
iarize themselves with the manifestoes of
..Manager Vining, and on the part of the
male passengers it has caused many a one
to break the commandment regarding pro
fanity.
"How is this?" asked a lady passenger
on an Ellis-street car yesterday, "that you
will not me a transfer to Filimore
street north? I was given one yesterday."
"Guess not," was the curt reply of the
conductor.
"But I was," insisted the lady.
'"You must have been riding on the
Eddy-street line."
And so it was, and because this lady did
not walk one block farther south to get an
Edily-street car she was forced to pay an
additional fare in order to ride on Fill
more street
This incident illustrates the lack of ac
commodation the Market-street system
extends to its hundreds of thousands of
patrons. Many are at a loss to under
stand why the company should issue
transfers either way on Filimore street
at Eddy and refuse them at O'Farrell
street, which is the continuation of the
Ellis-street line.
Another inconvenience to which passen
gers are put is on the Filimore and the
Devisadero street lines going north. Peo
ple who live in the immediate vicinity of
these lines have in some way learned that
if they patronize either of them they
may by the grace of E. P. Vinmg be trans
ferred to an eastward- bound car to reach
the ferry.
There is one branch of the system
known as the Sacramento street line that
runs east along Sacramento street, cross
ing both Devisadero ana Filimore streets.
That, of course, wouid be the most direct
line on which to transfer passengers who
ride on the lines of the two streets named
from the southern extremity. Does the
manager of the system allow them to
transfer at that point and save time in
reaching the ferry? No, that would be
too much convenience and too much
courtesy to the passengers. The pas
sengers on Devisadero street are carried
across Sacramento, Clay and Washington
to Jackson where they are transferred to
the cars of that line, which run down
that street to Steiner, to Washing.on, to
Stockton and then turn into Sacramento
and continue on until they reach the
ferry. This long round-about way in
volves a loss of nearly ten minutes' time
and is a rather ridiculous way of making
transfers.
After June 1 passengers who travel south
on the Montgomery-afreet bob-tail cars
arc to be deprived of another accommoda
tion." Transfers from the cars to the Mai
ket-street lino on cars going to the ferry
and from the Market-Street cars to the
Montgomery-street cars will be discon
tinued. A driver on one of these cars
when asked what that meant answered,
"Don't know, and I don't know what's
coming next^]

SOLDIER ENDEAVORERS.
The Presidio Represented at a Concert
' Given at the First Baptist
Church.
The soldiers of the Presidio Christian
Endeavor Society were well represented at
the concert held at the First Baptist
Church last evening.
It was the desire of the Endeavorers to
give the right hand of welcome to the sol
dier Christians and cheer them on in their I
work among their comrades. Every mem- j
ber of the Presidio society received a ticket
for the concert and was met by a reception
committee as he entered the church.
An interesting programme was rendered
in the auditorium of the church, each
number of which was well received and
encored. Especially notable were the
selections given by the Knickerbocker
quartet, consistine of D. M. Lawrence, R. '
P. Evan?, D. B. Crane and L. A. Larsen.
D. M. Lawrence, who is gifted with an \
unusually fine tenor voice, sang, greatly j
to the delight of the audience, "The j
Clouds Are Gathering Darkly O'er Me."
After the programme was rendered a
general hand-shake and reception was
given to the Presidio Christian Endeav
orers.

FROM A BURNING BED.
An Old Colored Couple Narrowly Eg- j
cape a Frightful Death.
Otis H. Berge, special officer on Broad- i
way, has occasion to be elated that he is '
gifted with a keen sense of smell, as that j
endowment enabled him to save the lives I
of an old colored couple, who were lying j
asleep in a burning bed early Wednesday ]
morning.
Harvey Brown and his wife are the aged i
couple who so narrowly escaped crema- !
tion. They took up their abode in the j
Broadway House, corner of Broadway and j
Kearnv streets, several months ago. They '
were always considered an unusually cau- |
tious couple, and how the bedclothes be- i
came ignited is a mystery.
Bertie, when passing the house in which |
they reside, detected the scent of burning I
cloth. He entered the building and lo- I
cated a room on the first floor from which
the smoke was passing through crevices
around the door. He tried the door, but â 
found it securely locked, so nothing re- i
mained for him to do but to burst it in.
When this was done the smoke poured
out in volumes, which almost overcame
him. The straw bedding was blazing up
and belching forth volumes of stifling
smoke at intervals, and asleep in the
midst of all this, unconscious of the sur
rounding dancer, lay the old colored man |
and his faithful wife.
They were dragged out of bed without
ceremony, and recovered from the effects
of the poisonous smoke and their rude
awakening. . :

HANGED HIMSELF IN A BARN.
Decomposed Body of an Unknown Man
Digcovernd Last Kvening.
The decomposed body of a man was
found hanging from the rafters in Robin- i
son & Knox's hay barn, corner of Brady !
and Stevenson Streets, last evening at 6
o'clock by John Henessy, who was search
ing for a missing set of harness. The
coronor was notified and the body was re
moved to the Morgue.
Judging from the condition of the body
death had taken place fully three weeks
ago. The face was past recognition.
A number of people called at the
Morgue during the evening in hopes of
being able to identify the decomposed
body, bi.t after one glance at the blackened
features hastened away, not carin- to
remain long enough to note the wearing
apparel wiiich clothed the body. The
case was plainly one of suicide.
Tbe body was that of a man probably
about 45 years of age, of sandy com
plexion. It was dreised in a dark brown
coat and vest, dark gray trousers, black
negligee shirt, black polka dot tie and
lace shoes.

ROBBED OF HIS
NEW TROUSERS.
J. B. Lankershim of Los
Angeles in a Trying
Situation.
TAKEN WHILE HE SLEPT
A North-Bound Pullman Sleeping-
Car the Scene of the
Outrage.
JOURNEYED WITHOUT HIS WIFE
Furnished Raiment to Get to His Hotel
in by One of the Train
Crew.
But for the opportune kindness of a
dining-car steward Banker J. B. Lanker
shim of Los Angeles would have come to
town in a barrel. As it was, he appeared
clad in an unimpeachable Prince Albert
coat and a pair of trousers, the shininess
of which was only relieved by an occa
sional grease spot, but poorly concealed by
the long skirts of the more respectable
garment.
On Tuesday last Mr. Lankershim packed
his grip and departed for tbe north on the
Southern Pacific train which leaves the
city of Los Angeles at 2p. m. It was the
first time in his twenty years of married
life that the banker ever traveled from his
southern home without being accom
panied by his wife. To th is circumstance
unfeeling friends ascribe the fact that be
fore he reached his journey's end he had
lost his self-esteem, what money he car
ried, and, sad to relate, his trousers. It is
a saying, commonly heard from the
mouths of the "gentlemen of the turf,"
alter a particularly unfortunate day of
speculation, that they have been bereft of
that useful article of wearing apparel, but
it remained for the Los Angeles banker to
really find himself in that unenviable pre
dicamtnt.
There was a most merry and distin
guished party aboard the sleeper in which
JSlr. Lankershim had engaged a berth.
Judge Ross of Los Angeles, ex-Judge Finn,
I'rivate Secretary McCabe of Governor
Budd's personal staff, with their respec
tive wives, and other ladies and gentlemen
were there. The banker was personally
known to nearly all of them.
The party lingered until late. The time
passed quickly with happy jest and story,
and it was close to cockcrow when "good
night" was said.
Mr. Lankershim had an upper berth at
the forward end of the car, and, after dis
robing, he hung his nether garment, in
tbe pockets of which was over $200 in coin,
on a hooK at the outer edge of his bed. In
the morning when he awoke he startled
the other inmates of the car by announc
ing that he had been robbed, not only of
his money, but of his trousers.
A thorough search of the car failed to
find the missing article 6t clothing, and
only resulted .in the discovery that another
passenger had lost his shoes. Then a
lady who had a lower berth opposite the
banker, and had been kept awake by sick
ness, explained the whole matter by re

marking that two tramps had been
through the car shortly after the train left
Fresno. It seems that one of the brake
men of the train discovered a couple of
tramps on the roof of the car and forced
them to come down. He preceded them
on the trip through the cars to the front of
the train. The sick passenger had tbe
curtains of her berth drawn slightly aside
for tbe purpose of ventilation, and was
startled by the sudden appearance of the
rough-looKing party. Sue noticed that
the two tramps lingered a moment oppo
site her section, and hastily drew the
draperies together, not, however, before
she had noticed that one of the men was a
tall fellow wearing a small soft hat, and
that he walked with a l?rup.
The other was shorter, but being beyond
his companion was not so plainly seen.
Tbe men lingered only a moment, and as
they departed the taller one winked face
tiously at the porter, who at that instant
came up. Besides the trousers and money
Mr. Lankershim lost a silver cardcase
rom the pocket of bis coat.
The denuded passenger lingered long in
his berth that morning, his head stuck ont
between the drawn curtains, reviewing the
porters and brakemen ULtil he could find
one of the Lankershim proportions. The
only man who represented the banker had
on a greasy old suit, and he consented to
lend the lower half of it to the man of
money. Clothed in his spotless Willie
boy, his greasy, bag-kneed trousers and
toothpick shoes, the gentleman from Los
Angeles emerged from the train when it
arrived here and at once sought a tailor.
He promises to make things unpleasant
either for the Southern Pacific or the Pull
man Company, or both, if his losses are
not made gooa.
MILLIONAIRE OF SLOCAN
John M. Harris and His Queer
Silver Mine in the
Wilds.
The Mountains "Go Straight Up and
Down"â Bg Contract of the
Slocan Star.
John M. Harris, one of the rising young
millionaires of Salmon, In the Siocan min
ing country, fifty miles north of the Amer
ican boundary, is at the Palace. Mr.
Harris is the owner of the Reco mine.
The Reco is one of the great mines of the
new.district.
Last winter Mr. Harris shipped 350 cars
of ore from the Reco, which brought at
the Omaha and Grant smeltar $97,000. The
ore, he says, averages from 211 ounces to
some 800 ounces per ton in silver and from
25 to 70 per cent in lead.
"The mine is a true fissure." said Mr.
Harris last night "The vein cuts the
formation at a right angle and the forma
tion itself is porphyry and slate.
"Salmon is the terminus of a branch of
the Canadian Pacific and a branch of the
Great Northern, so that there are abundant
shipping facilities. The Camp Salmon is
new. I was one of th* very first to get
there. I arrived in 1892 and made a lot of
locations besides that of ihe Reco group,
which consists of four claims. I located
the Omega, the Madison and the Dead
Man group. The latter I have recently
sold.
"To my mind this part of the Slocan
country is the richest in America in silver
and lead. Were it not that the property
there was so rich we would be in the same
condition as the miners of Idaho, Mon
tana and elsewhere; we couldn't work the
mines at all. But as it is, the ore running
so heavy, we get along first rate and work
to a profit.
"Ihe camp lies at an altitude of about
â¢4000 feet, while most of the mines lie at a
height of 8000 feet. It is pretty near a
straight up-and-down proposition to get

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 29, 1896.
John M. Harris of the Reco Silver and Lead Mine, in the New Slocan Country, B. C,
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artitt.]
an angle of about forty-live decrees. I
have only attained a depth of about 300
feet on the Reco and am now employing
forty men. I have not put on a costly
plant and machinery yet, but will do so
this spring. I will also very largely in
crease the force of men.
"I suppose you have heard of (he Slocan
Star, which has been much talked about as
a big mine. It is a big mine, too, tboogb
I will not admit that it is the equaLof the
Reco, but its owners have done something
lately that will attract the attention of
miners over the world when they know of
it They have just made a contract with
the Omaha and Grant Smelting Company
to furnish the enormous quantity of 1500
tons a day for the long periodof eight
months. When you think of that and of
the immense amount of ore it will take to
fill this contract you will see in a way what
a prodigious property they have. The ore
in this mine is rich also, and its character
is similar to that of the Reco.
"What makes this ore so very rich in
silver are the sulphides that lie next to
the cubes. These sulphides are almost
pure silver, and when you get a carload of
the ore there are a good many hundred
pounds in it that are simply pure silver.
"I was a pioneer in Cocurd'AJene, and
had siven a pood deal of attention to
mining in a theoretical *ay prior to going
to Slocan, but I knew almost notning
about it practically, and since goins; there
I have had to learn it. Had some rough
times of course, but after all when I think
of the results which are eminently satis
factory to me, I look upon it nil as simply
nothing."
James F. Wardner, who was the owner
of the bip Bunker Hill and Suliivan silver
mine at Wardner. Idaho, was present, and
said there was a race between himself and
Mr. Harris to get the Reco. "That mine
was offered to me for fifteen hundred
dollars," said Mr. Wardner, "and I was
eoing to take it, but Harris got in ahead
of me, and he has to-day undoubtedly one
of the creaiest mines of the country."
The town of Salmon is about 2.50* miles
from Spokane. Mr. Harris will probably
oe here several days.
FaTora Home Industry.
A week or so ago the secretary of tbe Manu
facturers*' and Producers' Association of Cali
fornia wrote to Governor Budd requesting that
he use his influence to see that all public insti
tutions in preparing their bchedules for sup
plies insert a clause giving the preference to
articles of California manufacture.
Yesterday a reply was received from Sacra

TIRED OF LIVING,
John Cohan's Matter-of-Faot Way of
Shuffling Off This Mortal
Coil.
John Cohan, an invalid tailor, blew his
brains out yesterday morning in his room
at 1026 Jackson street.
Cohan has been verj ill for a long while,
and the inmates of the house in which he
lived were not astonished when they
heard the reports of two shots coming
from his room.
The first shot was a test one, as it were,
it being fired at the wall. The second
entered the victim's Drain.
Cohan was a single man, 27 years of age,
and a native of Austria. Several days ago
he destroyed all his letters and private
papers.
Written on the sheet on bis bed was the
following:
Oh, lam tired of living! If anything hap
pens to me, 1 leave all my property to John
Ketussing.

MURDER IN HIS MIND.
:\n insniK- Colored Man Waiting to Kill
the "Examiner'a" Manager.
John Williams, a colored laborer, stood
in front of the Examiner office on Market
street and Grant avenue last night with an
open knife in his hand. He told every
body that the manager had a gun to kill
him, and he meant to have the manager's
blood.
Policemen F. Cassin and P. Butler cam*
along, and as Williams was evidently
crazy they took him to the Receiving Hos
pital. Dr. Fitzgibbon, acting under in
structions, refused to give him accommo
dation in the hospital, as all the padded
cells were occupied.
Williams was taken to the City Prison,
where he had to be locked up in a cell with
other prisoners till room could be found
for him in the hospital.
MANY CLOSE HUSHES.
A Rare Day of SportâReopen
ing Day at Ingleside
Track.
THBEE FAVORITES GET PURSES
Dura, tie Daughter of Racine, Creates
a New Track Record â Ruinart
Beat Bueno a Nose.
Ingleside track threw open its gates yes
terday for the final meeting of the racing
season. The popularity of "ladies' day"
was attested by the well-filled grand
stand ; not as large a throng, perhaps, as
on some former occasions, but this fact
can be attributed to the weather, which
was just a trifle too cooling for an ideal
racing day. The music, usually served
out at the old track in very limited quan
tities, and only on state occasions, added
to the pleasure of the time.
The sport was excellent. Close finishes
characterized the racing, and Judges Wil
son and Leake were kept busy separating
horses that passed the wire in nose fin
ishes.
Six events were decided, of which num
ber first choice in the betting ring captured
three. Snider carried off the riding hon
ors, landing two of the winning horses.
One of the prettiest and most exciting
finishes was that at the termination of the
four and a half furlongs dash for members
of the two-year-old division. Coming
from behind, Dura, the game daughter of
the popular old sprinter, Racine, nosed out
the 15 to 1 chance Howard 8, covering the
distance in 55 seconds, which now stande
as the track record for Ingleside. The
winning filly was a 6 to 5 favorite in the
betting.
Another very close thing was the battle
royal Detween Kuinart and the black horse
Bueno at the end of the fifth event on the
card over six furlongs. Backed from twos
to even money favoritism Ruinart :iad
raced Toano off his legs by the time the
bend for home had been reached. McClain
on the leader now flattered himself that he
had the race well in hand, but was nearly
nipped out by Bueno, who came like a
ghost the last furlong, and was beaten but
a nose.
Dolce, the sister of Crescendo, performed
most disappointingly in the opening four
furlong dash for two-ye*ar-olds. tent to
the post a 6 to 5 choice, she showed little
speed and finished back amonc the also
ran. Jerilderio, a smart filly by Rathbone,
with post odds of 8 to 1 about her, headed
Santa Paula in the stretch, winning easily
by three lengths in :49J^. The latter
youngster took the place from Laura Burt
in a hard drive.
Five started in the mile and a sixteenth
run, decided under selling conditions with
the Elm wood stock farm entry Instigator
a prime even money choice. Belle Boyd
commanded substantial backing at 616 1 to 2,
as did Red Gien. the third choice. Paros,
the iron gray conundrum, remained at 7 to
1 throughout the betting and proved the
surprise party. Belle Boyd mad 9 the run
ning to the bend for home trailed by
Instigator, when she had enough. Red
Glenn soon passed Instigator and put his
friends in jubilant spirits, when Snider
brought Paros along fast on the outside,
and in a drive between the pair the gray
gained the verdict by a bead in 1:49.
W. D. Randall's string of Montana
horses appear to have struck a great win
ning gait of late, and scarcely a day passes
that the capable and etlicient handler of
Marcus Daly'- string does not receive the
congratulations of his friends. Skalkaho
with Fell upstarted a 2 to 1 favorite over
the other fourteen starters in the six
furlong spin for maiden three-year-olds,
and after getting away well and falling
Dack in the bunch again wended nis way
to the front and caught the eye of the
judges a head before La Flecha, 10 to 1
shot.
After losing several races through being
piloted by incapable jockeys, the good
mare, All Smoke, at last gained winning
brackets in the final race of the day, over
a mile, with fourteen selling platers toeing
the mark.
Flashlight backed down from 8 to 5 to
evens wa? in great demand, but had evi
dently slipped his muzzle, for he never
appeared overburdened with speed, failing
to earn a mark. Two Cheers, an outsider,
backed down from 25 to 0 to 1, showed the
way into the stretch and looked a probable
winner until well on toward the wire, but
was ontfooted at the end by All Smoke,
who won quite easily by three lengths.
He had second call at 2 to 1 in the opening
betting, but receded until 3 was laid as the
bugle announced poto t time.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Remus, theElmwood stock farm's entry
in the last race, broke down, tne black
horse limping In on three legs.
Widvw Jones, the entry of D. J. Tobin
in the opening scramble for two-year-old
maidens, does not appear to be running in
as good form as some days ago. Mr. Tobin
was much elated ovpr the victory of his
mare America on Wednesday, and as he
is a newcomer on t!ie turf it is to be hoped
his colors will often be seen in the front.
Grandezia led her field into the stretch
in the opening event, full of run, and
should be close up at the finish about the
next time she starts.
Dolce made a very poor showing yester
day. She looked slick and glossy as a
piece of satin going to the post". Her
yearling brother is said to greatly re
semble his illustrious full-brother, Cres
cendo, in size and conformation.
One of the prettiest pieces of horseflesh
for many miles around, it is said, is the
suckling filly from the tine race mare
Princess*, claiming as her paternal parent
the unfortunate Yo El Key, who was
badly cut down after winning his maiden
race, some months ago. The young miss,
with her dam, who are the property of
Millionaire Charles L. Fair, have been
quartered at the Bay District track.
Broad Billow was cut ioose in the third
event for a mild killing. Without inter
ference the seliiing would have been much
closer up at the linish.
Judging fioni his performance, the va
cation Rey del Tierra has been enjoying
has not materially improved his speed
qualities. If it hud been a sack race he
might have stood a chance.
Greyhurst, in his race, was unfortunate
in getting away from his post poorly,
which militated acainst his chances.
The Mars Murder Case.
The defense in the Mars murder case was
short. Dunne, one of the defendants, was
called to the stand, and he was asked if he had
struck Mars. Dunne said "no," and after a
few more questions of a similar nature be was
taken from the stand, and ihe defense was
closed. He vras the only witness.
All the afternoon the case was argued, and
this morning the jury will be charged and the
case will be submitted.

THE DIRECTORS ELECTED
James D. Phelan Declares Him
self Against the City
Government.
"IT COULD NOT BE ANY WORSE"
Better Paved and Sprinkled Streets
Demanded and Bonds Wanted for
Sewers and Lights.
President P. W. Dohrmann opened the
second annual meeting of the Merchants'
Association last evening in Kohler <fe
Chase Hall.
Among other thinps pessimistic which
he had to say about the city government
he regretted that so simple a matter as
cetting a directory in the City Hall should
oblige fifteen directors to make several
trips to the Supervisors' chambers, and
then only with the result that misunder
standings prevailed and that tbe object of
these visits was not attained. They had
succeeded in some small things, however,
and that was some little consolation.
He spoke of the levy, that had been made
for the purpose of sprinkling the streets,
and he was sorry to say that the work
had not been done, but that the fund had
been diverted to other uses.
President Dohrmann announced among
the agreeable things that during the past
two months 110 firms had joined the asso
ciation as regular members. Among the
good points possessed by the proposed new
charter was the fact tuat it would reduce
the tax levy and limit the rate of taxation
to fl 17 on the $100 valuation. The bond
ing of the City for sewers, pavements, etc.,
is made clear by the new charter, and pos
terity, which will enjoy most of the bene
fit, will be required to bear its pro rata of
the expenses.
The report of the board of directors con
tains the following:
A year ago the membership of the flssocia
tion was 214. To-night the rolls of the Mer
chants' Association comprise 443 regular
members, showing a gratifying increase dur
ing the past year of 229 members. As each
business firm represents but one member, and
most of the firms contain several partners anil
many employes, tne actual number who belong
to and co-operate wiih the association exceeds
4000.
Uniform and systematic sprinkling of the
streets of this City was taken up by the Mer
chants' Association in conjunction with street- j
sweeping. Our nigh Eummer winds and the :
*andy nature of the soil of this peninsula !
laukii it clearly apparent that street-sprink- j
ling in Sun FrancifcCo is as much a public |
necessity us ilreet-sweeping. It is, therefore, i
property a municipal function, and should be j
performed by the City for the preservation oÂ» j
the health and comfort of the inhabitants. '
According":; .-.ions for sprinkling have I
been embodied with those for cleaning the !
public streets. It now remains to be seen
whether the Supervisors will awaken to the
. proper needs of our municipality, and provide
the uniform and systematic sprinkling of our
streets as prevails In every progressive city in
the L'nion.
The disgraceful condition of many of the
leading thoroughfares of San Francisco is
a merited reproach to our community. Noth
ing is more detrimental to the progress and
prosperity of this metropolis. The earnest ef
forts of your board of directors have been I
given to this important subject. The Street ;
I tment assigns its inability to repave our j
principal streets to the depleted condition of
the public fund*.
Renewed efforts will be made during the
coming fiscal year to have the abominable
cobbles in our downtown streets replaced with
improved noiseless pavements. The present
â¢ire system of this City's government pre
vent: any elaborate plan for repaying the
principal streets of this City. It would cer
ttiln 1v b? unwise to repave our main thorough
fares until a i.r.>]K.T system of sewers contain
ing neeeexsHry oondalta had been provided
for. This can only be effected by bonding the
1 :"y for a sufficient sum, so '.hat the burden
Â»ill not fall altogether on the taxpayers of the
City, but will justly be distributed tor forty
years to cone. The taxpayers of San Frnn
eisco will never consent to the bonding of the
City under the present defective system of
municipal government.
The brjard earnestly recommends the better
illumination of the streets and parts. It has
become apparent that a change of system in
our City government is most imperatively de
manded. Careful study of the proposed new
charter conclusively proves that it is infinitely
superior to the present obsolete and complex
government of San Francisco.
The secretary was instructed to cast the
ballot of the association for the following
named fifteen directors, and they were de
clared elected for the ensuing year:
A. S. Baldwin, Charles Bundschu, James 8.
' onweli, \Y. Q. Doane, F. \V. Dohrraann, Wil
liam Doxey, A. G. J. Futenot, Henry D. Keil,
Manfred S. Kohl berg, Henry Michaels, R. F.
O.sborn, M. A. Rothschild, Joseph Simonson,
Vanderlynn Stow, Frank A. Swain.
The following committee was appointed
to wait npon the Election Commissioners
and the Registrar and urge upon them the
importance of placing the words, "For the
New Charter" and "Against the New
Charter," at the head of the municipal
portion of the ticket.
Josepli Britton, president of the Board of
Freeholders; .lames D. Phelan, president of the
Sau Francisco Association of Improvement
Clubs; Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber
of Commerce; I. J.Truman, president of the
Civic Federation; Hujro L>. Keil, director of the
Merchants' Association.
Secretary Freud read a plan of action
with reference to the adoption of the new
charter. He suggested that it was certain
that all the precinct officers to be named
by the officials would be opposed to the
adoption of the charter. He added:
It is absolutely necessary for the friends of
the charter to insist upon having some of the
election officers in each precinct favorably
disposed to the adoption of the charter. If
that is not permitted, then faithful aud vigil
hnt watchers for the new charter should be
stationed in each election booth to see that
(.â¢very vote polled for the charter is honestly
countea and tallied.
Permit mo to suggest plan of accomplish,
ing this result by the volunteer services of the
friends of the new charter. Nearly all the
members of the Merchants' Association have
many employes. There are 293 election pre
cincts in Han Francisco. Let each member of
the Merchants' Association permit one or
more of his faithful clerks or employes to act
as election officers or watchers, by , this sim
ple plan of having the watchers relieved at
regular intervals the friends of the charter
could feel assured that every vote polled in its
favor has been accurately and honestly
counted. It would be a patriotic service ren
dered this City that would merit the gratitude
of generations to come.
It was also suggested that the friends of
the new charter should see to it that a
majority of all the Senators and Assembly
men in the next Legislature will not defeat
the charter after its ratification by the
people of this City. Secretary Freud ad
vised also the holding of mass-meetings in
favor of the charter.
C. B. Perkins of the Civic Federation
moved that each friendly organization be
requested to appoint two delegates to form
an executive committee for the purpose of
attending to the interests of the proposed
charter during the coming campaign.
Jamos D. Phelan spoke in favor of tne
motion of Mr. Perkins. He evoked a round
of applause by remarking that San Fran
cisco had no government worthy of the
name.
Mr. Perkins' resolution was adopted
unanimously.
S. H. Kaufman, a florist, read a paper in
which he urged the removal from the
street corners of the venders of flowers
who ply their vocation to the great injury
of florists who pay rent, taxes, etc He
recommended that the association call
upon the Chief of Police to rid the streets
once and forever of these "foreign pests."
Mr. Kaufman waxed quite poetical and
wound up with a grand flourish. Where
upon tome one made a motion to lay Mr.
Kaufman's paper on the table, and it was
so ordered unanimously amid laughter.
A resolution indorsing the action of the
Board of Health in their efforts to prevent
the adulteration of food was presented by
Isadore Jacobs.
The resolution was referred to the board
of directors of the Merchants' Association
and the meeting thereupon adiourned.

THEIR SILVER WEDDING.
San Francisco Schuetzen Verein
Gives Honor to Its
Leader.
California Hall Made the Scene of
Joy by the Sons of Her
mann.
California Hall, on Bash street, pre
! sented an animated spectacle last night,
i It was elaborately decorated with a series
of streamers, running from the center to
: all sides of the building and draped along
i the walls. An abundance of potted plants
f and cut flowers were on the stage, where
i the Verein band had been stationed.
The occasion which brought all this
! about was the silver wedding of Mr. and
\ Mrs. Henry Prien, in whose honor the San
i Francisco Scliuetzen Verein had assem
i bled. Mr. Prien being the leader of the
] Verein band, had made himself a host of
I warm friends among his countrymen.
I Hence it was that the ball was crowded
with the Schuetzens and their families.
After the grand march the assembled
guests circled around the center table,
where D. B. Faktor, president of the
i Verein, made the presentation address,
, accompanying which was a case of solid
â  silver dinner service. To this mark ot es
j teem and respect from his friends Mr.
Prien feelingly responded. On behalf of
; the ladies Mrs. John Thode presented
Mrs. Prien with an elegant bronzeclock
| and statue. To this an appropriate re
sponse was made by the recipient, who,
! surrounded by her six children, tne Rev.
â  Mr. Buehler, who united her to her hus-
I band twenty-five years ago, and a host of
warm, personal friends, looked the pic
ture of happiness and contentment.
The arrangements of the entertainment
in its details were perfect, for which Cap
tain John Bolts, H. F. Maas and Lieuten
ant John Thode received the congratula
tions of those present.
After the presentations had been made
John Lankenue took charge of the floor
and directed the dancing until the sup
per hour was announced. Then all toek
their places around the festive board and
enjoyed themselves, as the Germans know
how, to their heart's content.

Last evening Lee Sing and Miss Oy Yoke
Leong were married at the Methodist Mis

sexes.
The bridal couple are members of the
Mission, well educated in the English
language and prominently known among
the Chinese Christian people of this City.
After the ceremony the guest*; were
served with refreshments, after which Mr.
and Mrs. Lee Sing went through the
ordeal of receiving in two languages with
becoming fortitude.
The groom was attired in the ordinary
silk costume of his countrymen, from
skull-cap to brocaded shoes. His bride
was dressed in an outer coat of apple-green
brocaded Mlk, with Â»;old trimmings; skirt
of -ilk lavender, brocaded, and trousers of
Dlue satin, edged with gold brocade. Mr.

Two Chinese Women Kaeape From a
Bartlett-Street Den.
While fisnn Go and Lucy King, yonng
and comely Chinese women, inmates of a
Bartlett-street den, were taxing a stroll
last Wednesday evening they concluded
to flee from their disreputable surround
ings and take up their abode in the Pres
byterian Chinese Mission.
They were guarded by an old and trusty
servant of Wing 80, proprietor of the
house, but nevertheless they managed to
carry out their intentions and made good
their escape.
They called at the mission and were
welcomed to their new home.
When Wong Bo learned that he had lost
two of his prettiest girls he swore out war
rants for the arrest of the young women,
charging them with jrranu larceny. They
were arrested, and in spite of their
scream?, tears and expostulations were
taken to the California-street station and
detained to await examination before the
Police Court.
Mis 3 Cuibertson of the Chinese Mission
will be on hand at the trial, and in case of
an acquittal, which is inevitable, as there
is no evidence against the girls, will t;ike
the women back to the mission, where
they will remain and become Christians.

WOMAN SUFFRAGE
MEETS DEFEAT,
Junior Mechanics Listen to
a Debate on the
Subject.
SPIRITED FORENSIC DUEL
Colonel Fox Gallantly Comes to
the Rescue of the
Oppressed.
ERUDITION AND ELOQUENCE.
Dr. Fitch Paints a Fearful Picture
of the Disasters That
Would Follow.
A debate upon the question of woman
suffrage was held last night at 32 O'Farrell
street under the auspices of Alexander
Hamilton Council No. 35, Junior Order of
United American Mechanics.
Colonel George W. Fox opened the de
bate in favor of woman suffrage, and in
the course of his remarks said: "The
fundamental idea of a republic is that
every individual member is a unit in the
government. The question is, Shall the
rights of any citizen be abridged?
By the constitution women are citizens.
Numerous decisions declare that a woman
is a citizen, with the rights of a citizen,
except that the privilege of voting may be
given or denied at pleasure by the State.
By the Declaration of Independence the
Government derives its pewera from the
consent of the governed. Who are the
governed? Women as well as men. There
fore no distinction can be justly made be
tween the individual members of the
governed body. If woman suffrage is rieht
it will triumph, and I venture to declare
that within the memory of nearly all
present woman suffrage will have
triumphed.
"You may say your mother did not vote.
Young man, your fatber did, and that is
wby you are where you are to-day. The
day has passed when woman suffrage was
discussed by iong-haired men and short
haired women. It will be argued that
women will have the power to change the
political complexion of this country. I
am thankful that they will."
Dr. Fitch in reply said: "I fail to see
why doubling the number of votes would
improve matters. If three men cause cor
ruption, I fail to see why the addition to
them of three women would decrease cor
ruption. 1 claim that woman suffrage is
only one of the symptoms of woman's
rights, and woman's rights, by drawing
women from the family to the professions
and business of man, tends to destroy the
family, and consequently is inimical to our
civilization. The trouble is that our women
are doing men's duties, not women's. The
introduction of woman into the various
avocations of life has reduced men's wages
so much that they cannot afford to marry,
and the family organization necessarily
declines very rapidly. And it is a matter
of fact that where, as in New Zealand,
woman suffrage has been introduced, a de
crease in the birth rate, and hence in the
building up of the family organization,
has followed."
After a brief closing speech by Coionel
Fox a vote was taken among the audience
as to the merits of the debate, and it was
decided by a considerable majority that
the opponent of woman suffrage had made
the best presentation.
A Mississippi girl had two lovers. It
was hard to decide between them, so she
mggwted a foot raceâ the winner to take
the prize. The first race was a "tie," but
there was a marriage after the second one.

THE GATHERING
OF THE CLANS,
Thirtieth Annual Games
of the Caledonian
Club.
TO BE HELD TO-MORROW
Brief and Interesting Sketch of
the History of the Or
ganization.
OFFICERS PAST AND PRESENT
It Is Now Financialy Strong and
Has an Active Membership of
About Fifteen Hundred.
The thirtieth annual gathering and
games of the Caledonian Club will be held
at Shell Mound Park to-morrow (Satur
day), and everything has been done by the
officers of the club to make the occasion
the most successful in the history of the
organization.
There are forty-six events on the pro
gramme, all with the exception of six be
ing open to all comers. An innovation
this year is an inter-school relay race for \
members of the high schools, five competi
tors from each, the winning team to be
presented with a handsome banner. The
prizes are on the usual liberal scale of the
club, which has drawn competitors from
all over the United States.
Besides the games there will be dancing
in the two pavilions, each in charge of an
efficient floor committee.
The committee on the games consists cf
D. R. McNeil!, chief ; John Reid, first chief
tain ; George Davidson, second chieftain;
James H. Duncan, third chieftain: Wil
liam Mitchell, fourth, chieftain; Angus
McLeod, John McLaren. Jerome McCor
mac, P. Mclntyre, James W. Harris, James
Gorie, W. R. Eaton, Charles A. McPhee,
George McDonald and Thomas D. Carroll.
There is always a warm Scottish weft
come for the guests of the club, and this
year the following well-known members
will be the reception committee: First
Chieftain John Reid, chairman; D. A.
Macdonald, Colin M. Boyd, J. F. Kennedy,
W. C. Burnett, C. Cbisholm, Robert Suth
erland, John M. Duncan, James McNab,
Colonel Thomas McGregor, Captain J. H.
Bruce, Colonel C. L. Taylor, Captain D.
McKechnie, James Millar. William Urqu
hart, William Nicol, Thomas W. Bethel,
General J. G. Wall, John Malion, Charles
Nash, James Aitken, Neil Carmichael, Dr.
J. A. J. Macdonald, John Smith and I).
R. Campbell.
The success that has attended the efforts
of the club is almost unprecedented.
Little did the seventeen men who met in
Clem Dixon's saloon on Summer street, in
the early part of IB6o', and made arrange- j
ments to hold the lirst annual fathering ]
and games in Haves Park, dream of the I
powerful organizationthat would develop |
within the next thirty years. Of the
seventeen the following are still alive:
James Aitken, John Bain, George, David
son, Clem jJixon. Walter P. Davidson,
James Scobie, Joseph Austin, Andrew
Foreman, John Murray and Peter W. An
derson. Those who have been gathered in
by the Grim Reaper are: Samuel Aitken,
William Henry, John .McAffey, Thomas
Boss, Donald McLea, Hugh Davidson and
James Laidley.
The club was organized on November 24.
18tW, and incorporated on August 26, 167 L
The following preamble to the by-laws of
the club explains its objects:
Being well assured that man is so consti
tuted as to require occasional seasons of ie
laxation and amusement; believing also that
athletic exercises, duly regmated, ate condu
cive to the healthful- iuvisoration of both
mind and body; and being, moreover, desirous
or assisting toward the establishment â  and
maintenance of friendly relations among those
who are of Scottish, birth or extraction, and
keeping alive in Hum an interest in Scottish
manners and wages, we do iorra ourselves
into a club, bearing the designation of "The
Caledonian Club of San â¢ Fraud wo," whose
chief objects shall be the encouragement and
practice of the games and preservation of the
customs and manners of Scotland, the promo
tion of a taste for b-Â±r language and literature
and the binding more closely in social links
the sons and daughters and descendants of our
mother country.
The club numbers about 1500 members.
It is financially strong. Eleven years ago
it and the St. Andrew's Society, whose
combined capital was at that time $15,000.
bought the property on Larkin street, near
Grove, where the Scottish Hall now is, for
$16,500. Five directors from each organi
zation negotiated the purchase, and they
had to dig down into their pockets to
make up the $1500. The construction of
the building cost $22,000, and in five years
the debt was cleared off and a dividend
has been declared ever since.
The first officers of the club, elected on
October 29. 1867, were: Donald McLennan,
first chieftain and president; R. B. Tor
rance, second chieftain and vice-president;
John Bain, treasurer, and Hu^h Davidson,
secretary. Donald McLennan (now dead)
held the office of chief for 1868-69-70; David
Mitchell (now dead), 1871-72; Stewart
Venues, 1573; D. A. Macdonald, 1874-75
-76-77-78; Colin M. Boyd, 1879-80-81; John
P. Kennedy, 1882-83-84"; D. A. M.-cdonald.
1885-86; Angus McLeod, 1887-88-89; W. C.
Burnett, 189<i-91-92; C. Chisholm, 1893-94;
D. R. McNeil 1. 18!>3.
The present officers of the club are: D.
R. McNeill, chief; John Reid, first chief
tain; GeorgeDavidfon (who was one of the
originators of the club), treasurer and sec
ond chieftain; James H. Duncan, secretary
and third chieftain ; William Mitchell,
financial secretary and fourth chieftain,
and Dr. George Adam, physician.

STOCKTON'S WATER CARNIVAL.

Project.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 28.â The Native
Sons held an important meeting to-night
and practically decided to hold another
water carnival on the night of September
19. There will also be a regatta here in the
| forenoon of that day. here will be no
queen or Goddess of Liberty this time, but
all the other features of the carnival will
be seen. There will be a procession of
boats which will go to the mouth of Stock
ton channel. The banKs of the channel
will be lined with rows of multi-colored
-Japanese lanterns and dotted here and
| there with electric lights. If the calcula
tions of the committeemen are correct
there will be more boats here than were
â  ever before in Stockton channel and Mc-
Leods Lake.

MONTEREY, Cal., May 28.â Miss Daisy
D. Wright of Pacific Grove has been
appointed Queen of the Monterey carnival
and celebration. The appointment was
made by the Mexican Veterans' Associa
tion yesterday. Miss Wright is the most
appropriate Queen that could be selected
not only that she is a most estimab.e and
pretty younp lady, but she was born in
the Monterey Custom-house and is the
eldest daughter of Jonathan Wright, .one
of General Fremont's rm n, one who fought
under bin at the battle of Gnbilan in 1846.
It is the idea oi the committee that a
Queen is to be chosen from every county
in the State. The maids of honor will be
chosen soon, but will be Monterey eirls.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, M AY 29, 1896.
THE WAR TALK OF
BIG DEMOCRATS,
Irish Says Foote May Make
a Little Hell by
Himself.
HE SAYS GOLD WILL WIN
Colnon Says the Convention Wil
Be Silver, and Cries "No
Quarter."
DAGGETT TALKS DISCREETLY.
Believes the Party Is for Gold, but
Hazards No Prophecies About
the Convention.
It is highly interesting to hear big Dem -
ocrats talk about the coming State Con
vention just now as the temperature
of the party steadily rises.
Their worJs are ominous of uncom
promising war, as a rule. The leaders of
the gold and silver forces declare that
there can be no compromise. Along the
stretch that divides the radical leaders of
the two elements are all degrees of inter
est, indifference, uncertainty and ignor
ance regarding the financial question, but
all will line up for the battle at the con
vention.
Calculations on the division of forces in
the National Convention at present make
it so even that the eighteen votes for Cali
fornia become of great importance to the
administration side, and the struggle to
capture as many of them as possible will
not be abandoned while a fighting chance
remains.
So adding to this grent issue the local
fight, the indorsement of Btidd, the control
of the State machine, the ambitions ot the
resurrected leader. John Daggett, who has
come forth from the political tomb he en
terea after the StocKton convention; the
personal ambitions of would-be delegntes
and the fierce personal quarrels that growhn
intensity, the prospects portend the storm
iest convention the California Democracy
has known.
It appears certain that the strength the
Federal brigade and the gold faction gen
erally will muster will be so great that the
silver men will be forced in self-defense to
oppose seating the local McNab-Dacgett
delegation, at least as a whole, and the
Buckleyites are aaily growing more jubi
lant and more certain of getting at least
half a vote.'
both sides claim victory in advance.
Listen to them talk. Hoar John P.lrish
for instance. If there is a Democrat in
California loyal to "pound money" and to
Grover Cleveland and his policy it is that
same vigorous and eloquent John P. Irish
the Naval Officer. The Sacramento conven
tion will declare for gold, he says, and lie
says that the party is not for silver, giving
a wipe at Foote and Clunie. This is what
he said about the coming convention yes
terday:
"The Sacramento convention will un
doubtedly deciaie for the existing money
standard. It will not demand free coin
age at a ratio of 16 to 1 or any other ratio
a;id it oucht to demand that the Federal
treasury be limited to its constitutional
functions of collecting the taxes provided
for by Congress and disbursing the same
upon appropriations made by Congress.
At present the treasury by law receives
silver and paper for taxes and is by law
compelled io redeem greenbacks in god
which it has to buy with bonds. The
greenbacks so redeemed are by luw im
mediately reissued and when ag.vn
presented have to be again redeemed
puttiiv the endless task on the treasury
continually imperils the public credit
The Democratic Convention should de
mand the cancellation of the greenbacks
and put a stop to a dangerous system for
?i hlc Â° rte P"blican legislation is responsi
ble. The party should at every point sus
tain the administration. "Any other
course is suicidal. No army ever won a
battle by shooting its own generals. Any
Democrat wiio wants to exchange Cleve
land's leadership for Tillmau's is unfit for
membership in tie party.
"I am not in favor of any straddle or
compromise. The silver men, as a rule
have been misled into the belief that free
coinage of silver at 16 to 1 is an ancient
Democratic doctrine. When they by study
discover that this is false, that every leader
of the party from Jefferson to Cleveland
has opposed the principles of such legisla
don, they will stay with their party and
principles and there will be no bolt.
"General Clunie, Foote and others may
take a bunch of matches and start a little
hell of their own, but they will have no
following. It is not true that the masses
of the party are for silver."
Superintendent of the Mint Daggett,
who will be the dominating administra
tion power in the State Convention, and
whose ambitious programme to secure the
Chicago delegation as a laurel, the State
Central Committee as a power and the
local machine as a clnb, will be
beaten by â¢ a close margin by bitter
enemies, if beaten at all, does not tell all
he knows about the situation. When in
terviewed yesterday he pleasantly cave a
selection of his convention views, while
circumspection sat upon his unblnrting
lips and discretion reined His tongue.
This is what he said in response to several
queries:
"I think that the Democratic party is a
sound-money party in California, i do
not undertake to say that the 'Federal
brigade' directs the Democatic party, un
less it wants to be directed that way.
The people of the party will know
what they want. It cannot be de
termined how the convention will
be divided until the delegates are seen to
gether. It is too early for prophesies as to
the relative strength of the two elements,
I should naturally think that the deleÃa
tion-at-large will be all on one side or the
other, but there will probably be a scram
ble for the places. It cannot be told what
will result. Itismv opinion that the con
vention should indorse President Cleve
land in all his acts and policies.
"As to the possibility of any bolting at
the convention I can only speak for my
self. If I go into a convention I go in
with a determination to support the nomi
nees. I will not bolt whatever the out
come."
On the local contest Mr. Daggett had
this to say:
"I understand that the 'Junta' people,
as they are called, are the only ones who,
undÂ»r~ the convention call, have any right
to hold a primary or to expect recognition.
They have been determined to be the le
gitimate organization as far as the State
Ceutral Committee could determine the
matter. It is not for me to say what the
convention will do with the contest. An
far as I am concerned I am opposed to any
compromise on half a vote for each dele
gation. One or the other delegation is en
titled to be seated. lam no half-way man.
"I am in favor of F.rank H. Gould for
chairman and I believe that he is a
favorite. I have not authoritatively heard
of anybody else being in the fight.
"As to the National Convention, that is
a worse problem than the State conven
tion, as it depends on so many contin
gencies. I have no opinion as to which
element will control the Convention,
ami it is guess work on any
body's part. I believe that if
McKinley comes out for silver or strad
dles the" money question the Democrats
will have a good show to win with a
sound-money man. That is all I care to
say. Aside from that question, his posi
tion on the tariff or his aeitation oi the
tariff question which he represents would
be resented by the business interests of
the country at the present time, and the
two things combined would beat him."
Harbor Commissioner Colnon is a rad
ical silver man and his views are eenera.'ly
taken as in harmony with Governor
Budd's. What he said yesterday about
the State Convention was si.id with less
ginger than his paper, the Stockton Mail,
'.as spoken, but hie position is typical of
tnat the leading and strong free-silver
Democrats jjenerally.
"The State Convention." he said, ''will
declare fnr silver, and it oujrht to do so for
that is the sentiment of the Democracy of
California. When I say 'silver' I mean
the free and unlimited coinage of silver at
16 to 1 with no straddle. What the
strength of the gold forces will be I know
nothing of except what I read in the
papers. I conclude though that if con
certed efforts are made by the Federal
office-holders, supported by others who
are for the gold standard, their power will
be very strong in the convention. Still, I
think the interior will outvote them. The
gold strength, which will be mustered
from throughout the State, will be due to
the efforts of office-holders. San Diego is
in Welburn's revenue district, and there
is the custom-bouse and postoffice there.
In Los Angeles the custom-house, poslofflce
and the revenue service figure. In this part
of the State there is hardly a town that
has not some representative of the admin
istration, and they are penerallv active,
intelligent and influential men. The gold
m;n are largely politicians and the silver
men are not, generally, politicians and not
organized. The action of the Republican
and Prohibition conventions on silver and
the strength of the Popalins are signifi
cant of the sentiments of the mass of the
people of California. If our State Conven
tion does not declare for free silver it will
be a clear case of administration influ
ence.
"I don't think that a straddle is possi
ble. It must re one thing or the other as
to the financial question, and the delega
tion at large will oe either lor silver or the
administration.
"If the gold men should control the
convention I don't think then will be
any bolt of silver men. They will await
the Chicago convention, which I am sure
will declare for silver. If gold wins at
Chicago the party will be split, two can
didates will follow and the silver
element in this State will go its way.
The sincere silver men will vote
for the cause independent of party lines.
An alliance with the Populis+s would be
the natural result of a split. The silver
question, like the slavery question, will
not down until ?"ttled. We might as well
have a square tight on it now as four years
from now. The Democratic party has a
hard outlook, and this is the only chance
of its winning. I think that it will De just
as well if the gold men do bolt at Chicago.
When they co out the Populists will cave
in and the silver cause will draw large
support regardless of party."
Mr. Colnon would not say much about
the local contest, which he recognized as
possibly controlling the convention, but
intimated that the great cause of silver
was more important than a local family
quarrel.
"I keep aloof from local polities and
know nothing about them," he said. "I am
for silver, and if I were a delegate to the
State Convention, as I will not be, I would
consider the preat cause, and what T could
do to help it along. lam making the local
contest no affair of mine. The family af
fairs of the party must be settled here."
The editor of the Stockton Mail declined
to discuss his townsman Gould as a candi
date for the convention chairmanship, but
ripped him up the back in the following
words and clauses:
"1 think that the chairman of the con
vention ought to be, first, a silver man. It
is important, too, to select a chairman
who is aloof from all factions, so that no
charge of unfairness would be upt to fol
low. He should be a man well known in
the State and party, but who he should be
I do not know.
"I don't, know what the convention will
do about the woman question. It ought
to come out against the A. P. A. It would
be cowardly to remain Mlent."
BUCKLEY PRIMARIES.
Matters Won According to the Card
Except In Two Districtsâ A
Big Vote Polled.
There were contests in only two of the
districts in which prirnari-s were held last
night by the Buckleyites for delegates to
the Democratic State Convention. These
were in the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-eighth
districts.
Although the printed call for the prima
ries provided for the polls being kept open
from 6:;$0 r. m. to 10 r. m., there was ap
parently a general misunderstanding in
this matter on the part of the election
officers, and polls were closed at all hours
between 9:20 p. M . and ll:.S0 p. m.
In the Thirty-sixth eleven delegates
were to be elected and there were twelve
candidates on the ticket. The contest was
known to be between Behrend Joost and
.Harry B. Morey, and every one expected
to see Morey win out hands down, as be
was not only secretary of the district club,
but was extremely popular personally. It
therefore created the greatest surprise in
the district, and at the Buckley head
quarters, when the returns showed that
the lines had been closely drawn between
these two aspirants and that Joost had
carried the night by a vote of 85 to 55 for
Morey.
The total vote cast in the district was
only 142, though this is the banner district
of the party in the City. Just what caused
the slaughter of Morey rather than some
one of the other candidates is what is
mystifying the push, as BucKley is said to
be equally friendly to both of them. The
fact that only 142" votes were cast shows
that a bitter fight was on from the very
start and that every voter had to submit
to a challenge.
When the poll was closed at 9:35 p.m.
there were yet many in line waiting to
cast their ballot, and the fact that the poll
was closed before the legally provided
time may lead to demands by Morey for
a new election in that district."
In the Thirty-eighth John H. McGinney
suffered, it is saicf, owing to his being a
persona non grata to the push of the
district, and was turned down and out.
Up to lA. m. reports had been received
from all but the Thirty- third district, and
the total vote cast aggregated about 6000.

Frult-Growers Favored.
The Southern Pacific contemplates shortly
to reduce its rates on fresh fruit and vegeta

Heretofore the rntes have been: Leys than
carloads, second class; carloads, class B.
This will enable fruit-growers remote from
market who heretofore have not been able to
reach the market at as favorable prices as
growers near by to now do so.
A special berry train has been inaugurated,
leaving Santa Cruz about 4:50 p. M., pickiriÃ
up berries and vegetables between that point

DEATH OF OLD
PIERRE LEROUX,
A Frenchman Who Was
Beloved Wherever
Known.
IT WAS HEART DISEASE
He Saved His Daughter's Life
and the Excitement
Killed Him.
A TOUCHING FUNERAL SCENE.
An Old Employe of La Societe Fran
caise de Bienfaisance Mutue.le
Passes Away,
Pierre Amedee Leroux was buried yes
terday afternoon from the chnrch of Notre
Dame dcs Victoires. in the private ceme
tery of La Societe Francaise de Bienfai
sance Mutuelle, overlooking Bakers
Beach.
In the passing away of Monsieur Leroux
the French colony has received a sad blow.
As an individual he was, perhaps, better
known among his compatriots than any
other man, and as the chemist of the
French Hospital he bad an opportunity,
of which he availed himself, to make
friends of its 4000 members. He was the
oldest employe of the society, having
assumed his duties over twenty-six years
ago.
The funeral took place at 2 o'clock in
the afternoou to permit of the old men,
patients and convalescents at the hospital
being in attendance.
They were there in force, the lame and
the halt, pressing around their old friend's
bier. He bad died so suddenly the de
crepid mourners hardly realized that he
was no more, and they chatted away, as
only men in their dotage do, in the outer !
room of the undertaker's establishment '
until they were admitted into the mort- |
vary chamber.
Then it was different.
Viewing the remains of the man who
had not only cared for them physically
but had consoled and comforted them
mentally for years, the poor old patients
wept and sobbed aloud.
Twenty-six years ago, when the French
Hospital was in its infancy, Monsieur ;
Leroux was in charge of the pharmacy, j
and he has been there ever since. No more '
faithful employe has ever been anywhere, j
and the sorrow of those who attended !
his funeral and the tokens n the way of
floral pieces that failed the church at
tested the high regard in which the de
ceased was held.
The best element in the French colony |
was present at the ceremonies and accom
panied the body to the cemetery. The
pallbearers were Sylvain Weill, 6. Bozio,

STORY OF HIS LIFE.
If You Are Weak in Vitality or Have Varicocele This
Letter From Mr. L. L. Jaccard, a Prominent
Jeweler of San Leandro, Cal., Will Interest You.
_ _ . _ â  ââ SAN LEANDRO, Cal.; December 14, 1895.
DR. A. T. BANDENâ Dear Sir: As many of my friends and other people have
asked me as to the truth of my statement given to you some time ago about my cure
of varicocele and weakness by your Belt, I have taken great pleasure in assuring them
that it is so. every word of it. lam cured of my varicocele, and also of the weakness
which it caused, and I am sure my cure is permanent, for I am 49 years of age and
when a man can feel as strongâ as wellâ as Ido now, after suffering for twenty-six
years from such a trouble as I had, the cure must be permanent. Nothing but pure
gratitude to you and my desire to help my fellow-man prompt 3 the lisa of my name in
this manner. I will never tire of recommending your Belt. Yours gratefully
L. L. JACCARD.
When you are seeking a cure for some ailment that is sap-
ping your very life away you naturally look for a remedy which
is highly recommended by persons who have tried it. If you
see the testimony of some indefinite, unknown person you are
skeptical as to its honesty because you don't know the person
and you can't take chances on somebody you never heard of.
But when a man whose friends are the leading men of the State
a merchant who is known and respected by all men in business'
who is known by everybody within a radius of twenty miles of
where he lives ; when you see the testimony of such a man you
cannot dispute nor deny its truth. Such a man is Mr. L. L.
Jaccard. For all manner of weakness Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt is the most certain cure. For Varicocele â that insidi-
ous disease which saps the vital power from men it is an abso-
lute and the only cure. The book "Three Classes of Men"
should be read by every man who is weak. It is free. Call and
test this wonderful Belt. A regular practicing physician of
thirty years' experience can be consulted here free of charge.
When medicines can be used they will be given free with the
Belt.

Mutuelle, but representatives of the finan
cial, legal, literary and mercantile
branches of the commonwealth.
The circumstances attending the death
of Monsieur Leroux are particularly sad.
On Monday he was hastily called from
his daily labors at the hospital to attend
his daughter. Miss Camilie Leroux, who
was at the home of Mrs. Bellerive in this
City. The young lady was suffering from
an attack akin to apoplexy. Her father
pulled her through all right and went to
his home in Alameda. His *vife then
crossed the bay to attend to her daughter
and the old gentleman remained at home
with his young son, Gaston.
The excitement of what had occurred
proved too much for the old man, and
Tuesday morning he was found dead in
his bed from heart disease.
The Colony Growl.
The Italian-Swiss Agricultural Colony is ex
tending the sphere of its operations. A few
months ago it purchased the Reddington
ranch of 1500 acres of land at Astl, Sonoma
County, and now it has just made another
large acquisition of lands and vines.
This consists of 640 acres two miles
east of Madera. In this tract of land there
are already 150 acres in vines and fifty
acres in olives and fruit. Next year the re
mainder will be planted in vines and it ia
intended to spend nearly $25,000 in improve
ments.

IS OBLITERATED,
Its Stables and Fences Are
Now Mere Wood
piles.
THE WORK OF A NIGHT.
Gang Plows Have Hopelessly De
stroyed the Once Famous
Course.
OBJECTED TO MORE RACING.
Bay District People Have Forever
Precluded Another Meeting on
the Gronnds.
The directors of the Bay District track
hayed caused to be wiped away everything
that would give use or identity to their
old pleasure ground and made another race
there an almost literal impossibility.
"Wednesday the multitude that loved it
beheld its final burst of gaiety and the last
habitue that boarded a Geary-street car
never to ride that way again to see a race
heard the sound of the axes and the grind
ing of the plows that were fast blotting the
place of so many memories from the eyes
of all men.
The last winner had scarcely touched
the line "Wednesday before a host of men
were battering away at the fences and a
dozen or more gang-plows, each pulled by
tenor twelve horses, were pushing their
noses into the smooth track upon which
money and care had been expended for
years.
And so the last event on old Bay District
was really not the farewell handicap of the
fleet steeds after all. It was the race of
the plebian horde, always to be found,
striving neck and neck for firewood. As
soon as the boards were knocked from the
fence they were loaded into the wagons of
people who were not ashamed to accept
firewood free when it was offered tnera.
The work of demolition was continued
all night long, and all night long Rich
mond was filled with the noise of lumber
ing wagons. The workmen did their worK
well. The sun went down on a finely
equipped racing ground; it saw in the
morning a grandstand and a clubhouse
standing forlornly in a new unenclosed
park of San Francisco.
Where the racetrack was I6ng and deep
furrows are now, and one may stand on â 
the clubhouse steps and gaze unobstruct- j
edly down the " streets that formerly j
abutted at the grounds.
It seems that charity in the matter of >
fuel was not the only "incentive the Bay
District people had in removing evidences
of a former racecourse. Two years ago
Warren <k. Mulley, contractors, signed to
do the grading on the site where the course
stood. A year aso they were prepared to
do the work, but by a stipulated sum paid
montbjy the California Jockey Club pre
vailed upon the contractors to extend the
time until June 1,
Mr. Williams endeavored to get a re
newal of the lease for another year, but
was unsuccessful. He learned that a j>lan
was in progress in which Warren <fc Malley
were interested after the Jockey Club
had abandoned the track. He therefore,
in order to thwart the accomplishing of
this rumored scheme, gave orders to Su
perintendent Fieldwick to give everybody
as much lumber as they would tear down.
Intelligence of this was noised about in
the neighborhood and as Wednesday after- j
noon wore away a crowd of fuel-boomers
were in line, ready to make the first haul. \
"There have been rumors floating j
around," said Louis Lissak, "about bicycle
races or some other kind of races which
were going to take place there after the
Bay District people had left. But we
didn't take any chances at all. Whether
there would have been races or not I can't
Bay. It was not the intention of the di
rectors that there should be, however.
The result is that not six inches of the
fence is left standing, and the track â well
I gaess it will take some little time and
money to put the whole thing in order
again. The people around there have got
enough firewood for hauling it away to
last them all next winter. No, you see it
would hurt the standing of good racing to
have cheap races there like they do in St.
Louis. We didn't propose anything of
the kind should happen, and I don't think
it will." _____________

It must not be understood that there
will be any races by women at this meet.
By courtesy of the management of the
grounds the day is set apart as a benefit
for the Alpha Club, which is composed of
a lar<;e numoer of young ladies, mostly
resident in the Mission, who have formed
themselves into a cycling club. The meet
is sanctioned by the League of American
"Wheelmen, and its officials will conduct
the running of the events. Ladies will be
admitted free to this meet and popular
prices for men will prevail.
Another crack amateur has joined the
professional ranks, A. M. Boyden of the
Reliance Club of Oakland. He will make
his first appearauce in this class at these
races.
Wilbur F. Knapp, the announcer of all
California race me* ts, F. C. Chandler and
B. V. Chapman left for Australia yester
day by the steamer Monowai. They went
in the interests of various bicycle firms
with which tney are connected to make a
bid for the trade of the Antipodes.
Business has not been to brisk as it
might be on the coast this spring and sev
eral of the dealers look to Australia, Cen
tral America and the islands to dispose of
their consequent overstock. According to
Champion Zimmerman when he arrived
nere from Australia several months ago
that is a good place to sell American
made bicycles, as there is a great demand
for the higher grades of wheels and tne
sport is indulged in by over half the popu
lation.
The members of the Liberty Cycling
Club wish it stated that at no time have
they entertained the idea of consolidating
with the California Cycling Club. The
club is prospering by itself and prefers to
retain its individuality. Next Sunday
Captain Beattie will lead the members on
a blind run.
SPRING VALLEY FISHES,
The Reason Why Lake Pilar
citos Has Been Closed
to Anglers.
A Milkman Who Was Prevented From
Making Money by the Water
Company.
Anglers of this City who in past years
enjoyed many pleasant days' outing on
Pilarcitos Lake were much surprised a few
days ago when The Call announced that
the Spring Valley Water Company had
j decided not to open the lake to anglers
i this summer.
The directors of the company would not
1 state why the old favorite fishing waters
! in San Mateo County must not be whipped
this season by the devotees of the "gentle
art" of fly-castine.
It was surmised by some of the stock
! h olders that the directors had ordered the
j lake closed because some one had
! reported at the office that a few of the
' young mus_alonge which were planted in
j the lake several years ago had been seen
and to prevent their capture angling was
| stopped for this year at least.
It now transpires, however, that the
muskalonge had nothing to do with tne
closing of the place in question. In fact,
the "destroyers of fishes," which were
j planted in Lakes Pilarcitos and Merced,
have not been seen since the time of their
I liberation, and the presumption is that
j the experiment has proven a failure.
A gentleman who is in a position to
speak correctly said yesterday:
"In the first place, the keeper of Pilar
citos Lake made it a part of his business to
entertain numbers of pleasure-seekers at
his house, which is situated on the margin
of the lake, during the months when
angling was permitted.
"Several anglers who journeyed from
this City foi the purpose of enjoying a
day's trouting found, on their arrival at
the lake, that the tourists and health hun
ters had taken up all of the Bleeping ac
commodations, and as a consequence the
fishermen had to enjoy the nocturnal com
forts found in lounges and chairs that had
seen better days.
"The company grew tired of bearing
complaints from anglers who had met
with disappointment at the lake, and, as a
means of stopping all further annoyance
on this score, it issued orders to the keep
ers of each lake that they must not enter
tain guests in future at any season of the
year. This order went into effect at the
opening of last year's nshing season, and
is e till enforced.
"When Fiiield, who is the owner of sev
j eral acres of land surrounded by the prop
i erty of the water company, learned that
I Keeper Ebright had been cut off from
1 making his annual summer's harvest of
dollars, he immediately decided upbn
erecting a nice resort for anglers on that
â  part of his land which is within easy
i reach of Lake Pilarcitos.
"Of course the information regarding
I Fiheld *3 intention was immediately tele
i phoned to the water company, and the
directors quickly decided to block the
milkman's fishy game by a threat to stop
j his teams from traveling over a road built
j by the water company for its own con
! venience.
'Fifield sought legal advice, and when
he learned that the corporation could not
lawfully prevent his teams from going
over the road which leads to b.13 residence,
he started in to erect a palace for anglers
and sportsmen, but the proposed 'little
houae under the hill' did not make its ap
peannnce, and in all probability it never
will be seen by either milkmen or fly
casters.
â¢'The water company was bound to hold
the winning hand, and, as a final means
of blocking Fifield's scheme for making
easy money, it issued orders about a
month a>ro to its keeper, Ebrigl.t, not to
allow any fishing on Lake Pilarcitos this
season, and now you have the story of
the lake. I understand that fishing on
Ban Andreas Luke will commence on
July 1."
A stupidly obstinate piece of litigation
has just been settled by the House of Com
mons. Two Aberdeenbhire land-owners
quarreled over the right to fish in the river
Dee, which borders their estate for 150
yards. Both admitted that the fishing
was of no value, but they spent $15,000 to
have their rights decided.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 29, 1896.
FINE NEW CHURCH
FOR DR, MINTON,
Westminster Presbyterian
Congregation Will
Build.
PLANS ARE ACCEPTED.
A. Geddes, the Architect, Built
the Present Church Forty
Years Ago.
THE TESIGN A KENAISSANCE.
It Is Expected That the Bui
Will Be Completed By Sep.
tember.
Westminster Presbyterian congregation
has decided to erect a handsome church at
the corner of Webster and Page streets.
Plans have already been accepted and
FACADE OF TIIE PROPOSED WESTMINSTER PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
[Drawn from the architect's plans.]
work on the building will be commenced
immediately. It is expected that by the
beginning of September the new church
will be ready for occupancy.
The site is only a few blocks from the
present church, Which ifl on Fell street,
between Oetavia and Laguna. The new
building will be larger and handsomer
than the present one, however. Tlj
of the main building will be 56 feet in
width by 62:4 in depth, but the depth will
be added to considerably by a rear Sun
day-school building 62x44. The seating
capacity of the audience-room will be 400,
with a gallery capable or holding 225 more.
The seating capacity of the Sunday-school
rooms is to be 575.
The design of the building is in the
renaissance style. The foundation will be
of brick, with freestone for the first front
and stone steps. Tne entire buildinc will
be covered with Queen Anne and fancy
shingles, and all tne windows will be of
catheural giass. The leading or main en
trance roof is to be of pressed steel, some
thing entirely new on this coast. The
designs into which the steel is to Depressed
are exceedingly handsome and ornamen
tal, and the steel tablets, when placed in
position will be tinted and frescoed. AH
the interior walls and ceilings will be
tinted and frescoed. The pews will be of
oak, and the entire.building will be lighted
with electricity and heated on the latest
improved methods.
On the second floor there will be a pas
tor's study, with a bay-window. There
are to be three large Sunday-shool rooms
on the rirst floor, one of which will be
large enough to be used for entertain
ments. On the second floor will be six
Sunday-school rooms. The orj;an Jolt will
be 19x20 feet, and the platform for the
pulpit 7x20.
The architect of the new building is Mr.
Geddes, who has designed more thah forty
of the churches in this State. More than
forty years ago Archibald Geddes was one
of the Presbyterians most active in organiz
ing Westminster church; he leased the
land on which the present church stands,
and was the architect of the church. For
forty years he has been a member of the
congregation, during twenty-seven of
which he was superintendent of the Sun
day-school.
The exact sum of money to be spent on
the new building in not quite definitely
settled, as some of the minor details
may be made more costly. Most of the re
quired amount is already collected, or cov
ered by pledged subscriptions, and there is
nothing to hinder the work being com
menced immediately.
Westminster Presbyterian Church lias a
membership of about 250 and a new
church has been talked of for some years,
though it was not till Thursday night that
the trustees decided to build. The pastor,
Rev. Dr. Minton, left this week for Glas
gow, Scotland, where he is to read a
paper before the pan- Presbyterian Coan
cil. He is expected back before the shin
gles of the new church are up.
Catching Lady-Birds.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 26.â Professor
John B. Smith of the New Jersey experi
ment station, whose lady-bird collecting
tour through California was announced in
a recent issue of The Call, reached Berke
ley to-day, after a sojourn of several weeks
in Southern California. He will remain in
Berkeley for only a short time, after which
he will proceed to catch the remainder of
the JIOOO worth of the scale pest-destroying
insects for which he was sent to California
by the State of New Jersey. "It has been
found," said be, "that where lady-birds do
their best work in destroying fruit pests is
in the collaboration of tnree certain spe
cies. In their combined efforts seem to
lie their success."
The professor baa found two of theÂ«e
ppecies in New Jersey, but the third seems
to be wanting there. It is for this third
family that he is searching.

WHARF DREDGING.
J. P. Taylor Shows the Public Mayor
Davie'.n Statements Are
False.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 27.-J. P. Taylor
to-day received from Henry Nelson, master
of the American ship Columbia, that
was stuck in the mud off th* city on
Saturday, notification that he would have
to pay the expense of getting the ship off,
and of the fact that hereafter all vessel
owners would be cautious about cnartering
for this city until the wharf was suitably
dredged.
In commenting on this Mr. Taylor said:
"Mayor Davie vetoed an ordinance pro
viding for this very dredging, on the
ground that there was no need of it. Any
one who has to do with ships knows his
statement was contrary to the facts, but
as the general public does not yet know
how utterly unreliable most of his state
ments are", this may serve to enlighten
them."
Lotteries Raided.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 28.â Chief Lloyd
made another grand swoop on the Chinese
lottery joints in this city last night, and
as a result eleven of the fellows who con
duct thorn were lodged in jail with a num
ber of cnarges placed against them. Big
Jim's establishment on Eighth street, near
Washington, which was recently fitted up
with a blind partition to prevent police iu
teiference, was among those raided.
IMPROVING THE MISSION
Many Substantial Buildings in
Course of Construc
tion
Remarkable Activity cii Foteom Street
After Many Years' Ces
sation.
Activity in buildine circles has recom
menced in the Mission, especially that
portion of the district between Folsom
street and Potrero avenue, from Sixteenth
to Twenty-sixth streets. This neighbor
hood, which has for years remained almost
unimproved, while in the territory farther
out many new buildings have been erected,
has at length taken a start, and is being
rapidly filled up with structures.
The paving of Folsom street, which is
now going on between Fourteenth and
Nineteenth, may have partially caused
the extensive improvements in the neigh
borhood.
On the northwest corner of Sixteenth
and Folsom streets a substantial three
story building, 75 by 75 feet, is being
erected by John Center, the Mission capi
talist. When completed the lower floor
will be occupied by a restaurant and a
barber-shop and the two upper atones
divided into rooms. The value of the
improvements is about $10,000.
Half a block away a brewery on the
east side of Folsom, between Sixteenth
and Seventeenth, is building a brick addi
tion. The cost of the alterations and addi
tions will probably reach $9000 or $10,000.
In the neighborhood of Twenty-first and
Bryant streets a great many new build
ings are springing up.
On the east side of Bryant street, south
of Twenty-first, two buildings, one a seven
room residence, the other a store and flat
above, are being built.
On the southeast corner of Twenty-first
and York a store with a five-room flat up
stairs is in course of construction.
On the north side of Twenty- first street,
between Hampshire and Potrero avenue,
an eight-room residence for F. W. Banks,
to cost $2000, and at the farther end of the
same block a $1600 building, is going up.
On the opposite side of the street H. C.
Anderson is building a neat cottage.
Two cottages are being finished on Hamp
shire street, between Twenty-first and
Twenty-second. . Two other cottages are
being built on the same block.
Besides these several large buildings are
being erected a few blocks farther out. On
the south side of . Twenty-fourth street,
west of Folsom, a $7000 building, store with
flats above, is rising rapidly. A block
farther out, on the northwest corner of
Twenty-fifth and Folsom jjtreetÃ, a large
building, consisting of three stores and live
flats, is being built at a cost of $11,000. ;
Such activity in building circles is '. ex
tremely encouraging to Mission residents.
When the Noe litigation shall have been
settled and the present cloud removed from
property west of Valencia street; a corre
sponding series of improvements will prob
ably take place in that neighborhood, and
the Mission should enter upon an era of
unexampled progress. .

SCHOOL MEDALS
MUST SOON GO,
No More Souvenirs for
Bright Girls and
Boys.
A SOURCE OF JEALOUSY.
The Bridge and Denman Prizes
Will Not Be Used Next
Term.
PRINCIPALS' PERTINENT VIEWS
A Luxury for Few â An Injury to
Manyâ The Pupil at the Foot
of the Class.
It has been virtually determined by
the educational Solons that the medals,
which for so many years past have been
awarded to the public school children up
on their graduation from the grammar
grades in recognition of excellence in
scholarship and deportment, are more
harmful than beneficial. At the end of
the term these glittering souvenirs that,
with their blue ribbon attachments, have
been worn so proudly by so many bright
and well behaved boys and girls will be in
use no longer. They are doomed and will
soon be only a recollection of past days.
Pride is not the sole feeling associated with
these medals, for their distribution as ex
perience shows has been provocative also
of many heartaches and jealousies.
Conformably to instructions from the
Board of Education, Superintendent Bab
cock recently sent a circular letter to
primary, grammar and high school prin
cipals, inquiring: "In your judgment is
the presentation of medals advantageous?"
The answers received thus far from a score
of principals, including several of the rep
resentative schools, are emphatically in
the negative.
'I am firmly of the opinion," says Wil
liam H. Edwards of the Crocker Grammar
that the distribution of medals for scholar
ship and deportment is an unalloyed evil,
and for one I wish the Board of Education
'would find some means of abolishing the
nuisance.
"Those who win th? medals are those
from whom no effort is necessary. Often
the most deserving do not get them. Often
they are the cause of jealousy and bard
feeling. Often the recipients obtain them
by cheating and sharo practice. Olten
those who do get them place no value
upon them."
"I do not," writes James T. Hamilton
of the Lincoln Grammar, "regard medals
as a proper incentive to study. Few pupils
work for them alter the first two or three
months. The rest of the class drops out
of the race. Those that do work for
medals are the bright pupils, who need no
such stimulus. No matter how fairly
awarded, there are always some pupils,
and often a few parents, dissatisfied."
Miss Clara M. Johnston of the Fair
mount Primary thus tersely and strongly
expresses her views:
"If medals are to be distributed, the
number should be increased, giving the
pupils who have made great improvement
an equal chance with those who are
naturally bright or whose home surround
ings are such that they have every ad
vadta^e. In my own neighborhood some
of the brightest children come from homes
where parents are unable to read or write,
where no daily paper is taken and where
there are few if any books in the house.
Such pupils deserve medals before those
ranking hither."
Elisha Brooks of the Girls' High, A.
Hcrbst of the South Cosmopolitan Gram
mar, Albert Lyser of the John Swett
Grammar, T. B. White of the Washington
Grammar, Miss E. E. Slincen of the Whit
tier Primary, Miss H. M. Fairchild of the
Potrero Primary, Miss Mary A. Scherer of
the (iarlield Primary, Miss Caroline B.
Barlow of the Irving Primary and Mrs.
Lizzie K. Burke of the Columbia Grammar
all disbelieve in the advisability of medals.
The system of medal distribution finds
an out-and-out advocate in W. W. Stone
of the South San Francisco Primary, who
says:
"I believe in the medal system. Like
all other stimulants, medals should be
given on the prescription oi competent
mental doctors. â¢ â¢ â¦
"If there are men or women or children
whose powers of mind or body do not
glow best under the motive energy of
healthful emulation I have never "met
them. Medals properly mixed and purely
administered stir the sluggish blood and
impart activity to the halting brain."
Miss Agnes M. Manning of ihe Webster
Primary and Mrs. tiarah J. Mann of the
Hawthorne Primary also think that the
medals should be retained and distributed
impartially.
Superintendent Babcock says that
medals uratify the pride of a few at the
expense of the many, and should accord
ingly be discontinued. The pupil at the
foot of his class is, he holds, entitled to
the utmoet respect if he be in earnest in
his desire to learn and will, in the long
run, be likely to come out a winner.
The Bridge medals are for all deserving
boys graduating from the grammar grades,
and the Decraan medals are lor the girl
graduates of the Denman School only.
Individual medal funds have also been
created by several of the leading grammar
schools.
PAMPAS PLUMES.
California Ornaturnts That Are Likely
to He Used in the Coming
Campaign.
A new industry is springing up in this
State that few people have recognized â
the raising of pampas plumes. The
plumes are of great value in Europe for
ornamental purposes, and at one time
large quantities were shipped there, prin
cipally from the southern part of the
State. The trade was killed by a lot of
scheming middle-men and speculators,
who were not satisfied with fair profits.
Secretary J. A. Filcher of the State
Board of Trade has become interested in
these ornamental plumes, and with a view
of making them generally popular and
thereby fostering a California industry
has written the following letter:
Major Frank McLaughlin, Orovilte, Cal.â Mr
Dear Sir: As you are aware, the raising of
pampas plumes is an industry that is confined
in this country almost exclusively to Califor
nia. In 1891 we exported nearly three million
plumes. The martet has been mainly in
Europe, owing to a lack of appreciation of this
decorative product in this country. Some Re
publican organizations have adopted them as
an emblem of their order since the days of
Blame. More particularly the National Re
publican League, the California Republican
league, the Union League Club of Sun Fran
cisco and the Union League Club oi New York.
It is within the power of the delegation from
this State to the National Republican Conven
tion to give a great impetus to the demand for
thin California product oy a discreet use of
them at tne National Repnbliean Convention,
and to this cud I ask your co-operatiou. They
are raised larcely for export iv Southern Cali
fornia, and all Californiaus should co-operate
heartily in advancing a California industry or
creating interest in a California product.
Mrs. \V. H. R. Strong, an extensive grower"
of plumes at Whtttier, Los Angeles, County,
will donate sufficient plumes for the use of the
California and other Pacific Coast delegations,
provided it is agreeable for them to accept
them. She will at the same time go on to St.
Louis with a large supply or send them with
some trusted agent for the use oi the dele
gates and others at that convention. Her idea
is that they shculd not be displayed as a Mc-
Kinley plume, but held back by the delegates
until the nomination is made and then
brought out promptly by the Californians as c
candidate's plume of victory. In this way,
when ail are waving and hurrahing for the
man who has been successful, all will want
plumes to indicate their enthusiasm, and the
demand, as you can imagine, will be immense.
Subsequently, at the instance of our people,
they can be used in parades and other demon
strations, and in this way, br setting an ex
ample and using a little discretion in their
introduction, our delegates, besides partici
pating in ihe nomination of a Presidential
candidate, .may work a great good for Cali
fornia in another line.
If you think well of this idea please let me
know what you can do, as the head of the
Republican party in this State, toward carry
ing it out. My interest, of course, is that of
the State Board of Trade, which aims at all
times and by all legitimate methods to be
alive to the advancement of California and
California's interests. Tours very truly, etc.,

SPEAKER REED WAS OBS TINA TE.
The Speaker Said He Refused Because
Kern of Nebraska Would
Object.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 28.â 0n
Wednesday Johnson had an interview
with Speaker Reed, asking that he permit
the mineral lands bill to be called up and
voted on by the House. After consider
able discussion, in which Johnson urged
this with great earnestness and as being
demanded by California, the Speaker re
fused to agree to the request.
Johnson then asked Senators White and
Perkins of California and Mitchell of
Oregon and the California and Oregon
Congressmen to meet him this morning at
11:30 o'clock and together see Reed and
try to change his decision. Accordingly
this forenoon Senators White, Perkins and
Mitchell and Representatives Johnson,
Barham, Hilborn and McLachlan of Cali
fornia and Ellis of Oregon called upon the
Speaker and had quite an animated and
exceedingly interesting interview with
him. They presented anew the request to
allow the mineral lands bill to be called
up in the House. He was not asked to
favor the bill or to assist in its passage,
but simply to allow Ellis to bring it up in
the House, as he had been directed to do
by the Public Land Commissioner.
Senators Mitchell, White and Perkins
and Representatives Johnson and Ellis
did most of the talking to the Speaker.
Reed peremptorily^ refused to agree to
recognize Ellis or any one else to report
the bill, and refused to agree to allow any
motion to be made in regard to it. He
stated that Representative Kern of Ne
braska, who has been blocking legislation
by objecting to the presentation of meas
ures, would object to the bill being con
sidered even if ne allowed Ellis to call it
up. Johnson asked Reed whether he would
call the bill up if Kern could be induced to
withdraw his objection. The Speaker re
fused so to agree.
Reed, during the course of the dis
cussion, said he understood the bill was in
favor of the railroads in California, to
which Senator White responded: "Good
God, do you suppose I would be here in
favor of the bill if such was the case?"
Senator Mitchell made a very strong
appeal to Reed for recognition, saying that
the Dill was favored by the united Congres
sional delegation of Oregon and California,
and that he had secured the amendment
in the Senate including Oregon because
tbe bill was a good one and his people
wanted it, and with no idea that it would
militate against the success of the bill, and
he most urgently requested Reed to allow
Ellis to call the bill up.
When Reed refused, saying he did not
see how he could do it, Senator Mitchell
grew unparliamentary and Drofane. He
retorted angrily, "Well, if 1 was Speaker
of the House of Representatives, I'll be
if I couldn't find someway to secure con
sideration for the bills."
Mitchell declared that the Speaker could
not because he didn't want to; that he
could easily find a way if he wished to do
so. Reed and Mitchell exchanged some
warm words.
Johnson said to-night, "It is too
bad that one mau is thus able to block leg
islation, but I do not give up all hope, and
will continue my efforts to induce the
Speaker to recognize the bill."

M V YORK, N. V., May 28.â There was an
Increase in business at the Stock Exchange to
day, but the activity was at the expense of values.
â¢ There were several unfavorable factors at work,
the more important being the disaster at St. Louis,
with its great loss of life and the enormous de
struction of property, reports of heavy gold ship
ments by Saturday's steamer, the uncertainty
surrounding the political tuation and rather poor
statement of the Burliogtou and Quincy for April,
which was due to the light movement of corn.
The professional operators laid stress on the great
storm at the West, but they made little impression
on what are known as St. Louis properties, except
Mobile and Ohio and Laclede Gas, the former de

Foreign houses were also sellers of St. Paul and
other issues lis ed abroad. Favorable news, such
as the decision by the United .-states Circuit Court
in favor of the Joint Traffic Association and the
piospects of an early release of the Northern Pa

through foreclosure sales failed to exert the
slightest influence. Total sales were 150,750

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., May 28.â Business in wheat
was slack this morning, while the feeling was
scarcely more than steady during the greater por
tion of the time. A cautious manner was exhib
ited by the bears, who do not deny that the pros
pects for a recovery are good and who look for
something in the way of damage reports at har
vest to help values. The Cincinnati Price Cur
rent in its summary reported no decided deteriora
tion in the crops, but at the same time gave no
improvement. It made the claim that the high
expectations which have been prevailing are not
justified. Liverpool quoted Id decline. Receipts
at Chicago were 14 curs, and 40,751 bushels were
taken from store. The Northwest had 430 cars
against 274 last Thursday. The corresponding
day last year was a holiday.
Good export clearances, 513,108 bushÂ»ls, caused
a slight rally later in the morning, bnt afterward
on heavy liquidating."), prices broke almost a cent
from the high point attained. Gold exports from
New York were quoted as explanatory in part of
the weakness Closing Paris cables were 15 cen
times lower for spot wheat, but otherwise un
changed. Berlin was unchanged to 1 mark lower.
Antwerp was unchanged. On covering by shorts
almost a full recovery took place before the close.
July wheat opened from 58y 2 c to 68 %c, sold be
tween 5734 c and 583 /4 o(o 58" closing at bHS/g, a
shade under yesterday. .Estimated receipts for to
morrow, 13 cars.
CORNâ corn market hinged on the wheat
market. The receipts were again heavy at 590
cars, but as the trade has been expecting an en
larged movement, the effect at this time Is not
very pronounced as a factor, although they serve
to deter investment buying. Withdrawals from
store were 264,907 bushels. Liverpool cables
quoted Vid decline. Export clearances were 176,
-t>27 bushels. July corn opened at 288/gC. sold be
tween -814 and 28Vac, closing at 28Vi(3>283/ a c, i/ 8 c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row. 605 cars.
DATsâ Were traded In with a moderate degree
of activity. The transactions aid not reach any
great magnitude, however. The buying was prlri
c.pally by shorts, while the selling in many in
stances represented liquidation by disheartened
holders. Receipts were 258 cars. There were no
withdrawals from store. Kxport clearances were
2250 bushels. The feeling averaged steady. At
the close July oats were unchanged from yester
day. Kslima ed receipts for to-morrow 426 cars.
FLAXâ easy. ' Cash, 83Vac; July, 82c;
September. 84c Receipts, 17 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The action and tone of the pro
vision market were slow and steady. The busi
ness was of no interest outside tue small gathering
of professionals and commission house repre
sentatives In the pit. The low prices which pre
vailed offered but little opportunity for profit to
the short seller, and on the other hand the bulls
can present no argument tor improvement. On
buying by shorts prices advanced late in the ses
sion and the close was quite firm. July pork
closed 20c higher than yesterday, July lard 12 Vac
higher and July ribs 7Â«Â»@10c higher.

keep them out of the market. Prices have ad
vanced a quarter since our last reports. There
seems to be some Improvement In Peaches; choice

more than enough fruit on hand to carry over until

Desirous of Coming
Together.
HARMONY BY DEGREES.
Neither Side Disposed to Relin

Rights.
A FEW POINTS CONCEDED.
The New Comm ttee Will Next Sub
mit Its View of the
Situation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 28. \
The Third Congressional District Com
mittes are not yet harmonized, and the
prospe t is not very bright for an immedi
ate healing of tne existing troubles.
A long md exciting meeting of the new
committee was held last night and when
it adjourned but little had been accom
plished.
W. R. Davis, who was the first to declare
himself in lavor of harmony, presented a
proposition which it was hoped would pro
duce the end desired. He i xplained the
matter at length and then asked that it be
openly discussed. Each section of thc
proposition was taken up separately and
there were eight votes in the meeting.
The first section provided for a change o;
the date of primaries from July 11 to Au
gust 8. After everybody had spoken a
vote was taken and the point was con
ceded by 5 to 3.
The measure brou -ht forward by W. R.
Davis was in the nature of a peace treaty
from the old committee. It contained a
request for a change of the meeting place
of the Congressional Convention from
Vallejo to Oakland. After a long discus
sion tnis was rejected.
Then came a proposition to select one
man from each committee, these to select
â  third with power to name equally ali
L'lection officers for the primaries. It was
stipulated that the third man was merely
to cast a deciding vote in case the other two
disagreed. There was some friends to this
proposition, but it was voted down.
The matter of the selection of delegates
to toe convention was the next proposi
tion.' Ii provided for the election of rep
resentatives directly from the people in
each district. It was finally agreed to
have forty-seven polling-places in this
county and at each one representatives
shall be elected directly. The great regis
ter is to be used and no one whose name is
not on it hve days prior to the primaries
will not be allowed to vote.
The main struggle came on the proposi
tion to give each committee one-half of ali
election boards in the county. Tbis was
to be arranged so that each committee
would have a strength of one-half of the
entire election boards. That is, each
would appoint one judge and one clerk
and would then alternate in the selection
of inspectors. When a vote was taken it
showed 4to 4. Chairman French refused
to exercise nis right to give a casting vote
and the proposition was therefore rejected
The proposition was also advanced thai
the two committees unite and that the
united body of twenty-fcur members at
tend to all business jointly, but this was
also rejected.
It was suggested that the power of is
â¢ uing the call be vested in the proposed
committee of three, which was to perepare
the document, hand it to the County Cen
tral Commtttee and have the word "re
solved" written at the head. A desperate
effort was made about midnight to put the
whole proposition through, But it did not
carry.
The general feeling of the new commit
tee is evidently to accord to their political
opponents a fair representation, but there
does not seem to be an inclination to
yield any of the power as a Congressional
committee that was won at Sacramento.
It was 1 o'clock. this morning when the
commlttpe adjourned. It will meet next
Wednesday, when the new committeemen
will have prepared a proposition of their
own to submit to the old, embodying the
concessions already made and giving an
ultimatum Dn other important matters.

BERKELEY, Cal., May 28. -Town Mar
shal Lloyd and his deputies are preparing
for a wholesale raid on wagons next Mon
day,as a result of the newly passed wagon
tax ordinance. The Marshal states that
there are about 400 taxable vehicles in
Berkeley and of the entire amount not
more than half have been licensed. Be
cause of the delinquency in paying the
tax all the unlicensed wagons will be
gathered up and held until their owners
have redeemed them. It is estimated that
about 150 vehicles will be seized. The
Marshal is confronted with the problem as
to where he will store them all, but he
says he will try to rise to the occasion by
placing them in the back yard of the Town
Hall.
It is reported that the reason why the
ordinance has not been observed more
carefully is because many people believe it
cannot be enforced and are determined to
let the authorities take the initiative by
seizing the vehicles.

FAIR ALAMEDA'S
FLORAL FETE,
A Two Days' May Festival
Held in the Thompson
Grounds.
BY CHARITABLE WOMEN
Pretty Sylvan Scenes Among
the Flower-Dacorated
Booths.
GKAND BIKE LANTERN PARADE
"As You Like It" W- I be Given
ToNight by Electric Light in a
Real Forest.
Yesterday morning the Alameda floral
fete, given under the auspices of the relief
committee of the Alameda Woman's Ex
change, was opened at the Thompson
grounds on High street. The naturally
beautiful park of R. R. Thompson was
further ornamented with seven or eight
handsomely decorated booths, making
the prettiest flower village imaginable.
Each floral bower was in charge of a
committee from one of the local churches,
and decorated with a peculiar flower by
which it was known. They were as fol
lows:
Methodist, eschscholtzia â Mrs. W. H.
Pollard, Mrs. G. R. Johns. Mrs. W. Johns,
Mrs. Waterson, Miss Pollard. This was
one of the most attractive features of the
grounds, the booth being decorated -sit.il
yellow poppies, and the young ladies in
attendance being gowned in the same
color.
Unitarian, sweet peasâ Mrs. Frank
Clark, Mrs. Plummer, Mrs. Lynch, Mrs.
Baurbyte, Miss Elliott, Miss Sadler. The
flower was woven neatly among the greens
of the tower, making a very pretty effect.
Congregational, marguerites â Mrs. M.
Ward, Mrs. J. S. Haniey and a company
of younj; ladies in attendance.
Presbyterian, pink and geranium â Mrs.
Barton. Mrs. Barrett. Mrs. Smith.
Baptist, pink and silver poplar leaves-
Mrs. Wood, Mrs. Weeks, Mrs. Hubby,
Mrs. Robinson, MiÂ«s Spencer.
Catholic, rosesâ Mrs. Rossiter, Mrs. Co
lumbus Bartlett, MrÃ. Shea, Mrs. Car
pentier.
Episcopal, ivyâ Mrs. McGurr, Mr 3. Win
ter.
Gypsy tent, oriental interiorâ Miss Hop
kins as a fortune-teller in costume.
There were a number of olher booths
and stands all attractively decorated.
Tnere was no programme for the day's
enjoyment. The visitors simply strolled
around the park or sat in the pretty re
treats fitted up for their accommodation
and listened to the Presidio band. The
musicians were stationed on a grass plat
under a large oak and their melodies
sounded exquisitely through the grounds.
The bicycle lantern parade in connection
with the fete started at 8:30 o'clock under
Marshals V. A. Dodd, M. E. Games and E.
M. Whalley of the Alameda Cyclers' Club,
under whose direction the whole was
planned. Besides the home club the
Acme and Reliance clubs of Oakland, Dia
mond Cyclers, the Olympics, Bay City and
Imperial clubs of San Francisco sent rep
resentations. Then in addition there was
a host of wheelers unattached to any club
under the command of Albert Dexter and
F. E. Graham.
As the parade swung into Park street
from Central avenue, with the lanterns ull
lighted and the glare of the calcium tight
thrown on the riders at every turn, the
effect was striking and picturesque. It re
called the days of Aladdin and the Ara
bian nights.
Crowds lined the streets in every direc
tion, the major portion of which followed
the parade, wending its way to the
grounds, which were resplendent with the
light of hundreds of Chinese lanterns sus
pended on wijes from the trees. The
booths all did a izonu business.
The concert was under the direction of
Henry Fairweather, and just bit the tastes
of the auditors. "The Suwunee River" was
followed by "The Marseillaise," then came
"Die Wacht am Rhein," the "Hymn to
Culifornia," composed for the occasion by
Henry Fairweatber. "God Save the Queen"
and "My Country, 'tis of Thee."
To-day a festival midday May picnic
lunch will be served and a grand Maypole
dance be given by the following little girls:
Lulu Borein, Jesse Russell, Ida Matoon,
Laura Carl, Merle Francis, Irene Hanavan,
Maggie Bassett, Inez Merchant, Edna
fowl, Georgia Derby, Emily Lundber-,
Annie Devers, Florence Lake, Edith Cor
win, Emily Ross, Alma Ferris.
In the afternoon a floral bicycle parade
will take place, and in the evening "fill be

CITY OFFICIALS
IN A HOT STEW,
"Pudd'nhead Wilson" and
"Svengali" Peirsol on
Their Mettle.
TUG-OF- WAR WITH DAVIE
All the Row Is Over Printing
Contracts and a New Daily-
Paper.
OLD POLITICIANS TRICKED.
The "Observer" Appears Suddenly,
Bids for City Work and Upsets
Arrangem nts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
90S Broadway, May 28. )
The sudden advent of a daily morning
pap<*r in this city two days ago has upset
a lot of calculations and created an un
usual amount of gossip.
The birth of the Observer as a daily on
the morning of the day on which bids
were to be received for city printing
denotes a condition of things that was not
anticipated until the paper was seen on
the street.
Rarely, perhaps never, has a newspaper
been issued under greater difficulties.
Late at night the printing outfit was un
loaded on the sidewalk. It was nearly
midnight and unless the first issue as a
daily came out in the morning the neatly
laid plan, of which the publication was a
part, would fail. Within an hour of the
arrival of the type a squad of printers
were dug out of their beds and induced
to distribute the brand new type and to set
up the paper by candlelight.
Daylight began to appear long before
the last Kalley was proved, and wnile the
proprietor was around town looking for a
printing press, the make-up was com
pleted.
An obliging publisher was found in the
person of Albert Keyser of the Demokrat,
' and it was nearly breakfast time when the
preÂ«s commenced to work. An hour later
Oakland's new daily was on the street,
and everybody was wondering where it
had come from.
Little was thought of it till the Board of
Public Works met in the afternoon to
award the city printing contract, and to
the surprise of everybody, and especially
of those who long have controlled the city
printing, the new paper had in a bid aa
low as the lowest. There are only three
votes in the board, and of course two will
pass anything.
City Engineer Wilson favored awarding
the contract to the new paper. Mayor
Davie was decidedly opposed to giving it
to any paper of a day, while City Attorney
Peirsol was on the fence.
A consultation followed and no agree
ment was reached, so the case was taken
under advisement. The contract must,
according to law, be awarded to one of the
lowest bidders, and the situation is full of
interest.
The outlook at present is that the ad
vent of the new paper may break the cast
iron bond of amity that has so long con
trolled Wilson and Peirsol.
The Mayor has always been deserted
when a vote is taken, and unless Peirsol
now joins with Wilson there may be many
changes at the City Hall in the next few
weeks. AH the he'ai.:. of the departments
hold office at the pleasure of the odd mem
ber of the board, and if he flops over to
Davie the total complexion of affairs will
be changed,
Frank Robinson is the young man who
has so suddenly appeared in the local
political world, and so stealthily were his
plans laid that the old-timers were not
aware of his presence in the field until he
was within an ace of capturing the prize.
The paper whose bid is the same as that
of Robinson's has the support of Davie,
but as it has persistently referred to
"bvengali" Peirsol and "Pudd'nhead"
Wilson there is a lack of harmony between
it and the two officials.
The imbroglio is being very carefully
watched from all sides, as its decision may

National shields set off by smaller flags,
while the entire balcony rail was festooned
with red and blue bunting held in place by
United States shields.

fornierly interesting.

"It is getting late. I have no idea of
mingling my voice with the fresh youner
voices we have heard here to-night. These
young men of the graduating class have
given evidence of the training they have
received a tiring the past few years. Ido
hope that the principles of religious teach
ing that have beer, instilled at the school
durng the past year may bear fruit.
"But the best school for a boy is often
in his own home, and the best teachers are
his own parents. There is too much
relianco placed in the kodak principle â
'You press the button and we do Uie rest.'

You must not think that when you put a
boy into a Catholic school it will 'do the
rest.' The root of religion and of char
acter is in the home. Wnile the school is
doing its work it must be supplemented
by the influence of home life. Parents
must remember to do their part day by
day so that their boys may grow in
sanctity.
"I trust that the lessons of morality
learned in Sacred Heart College may bear
fruit in later life, and that these boys may
never forget that they are graduates of a
Catholic school.
"We owe a great debt of gratitude to the
brotherÃ who have performed the arduous
duties of teachers. Little do we consider
the demand that is made upon their
patience, or of their exercise of Christian
character. To the teachers every year
brings its new class of pupils to whom
they must silently, unremittently give
their attention. I believe that the vocation
most laborious and tedious is the task" of
these teacnerj. They should be helped on
by the co-operation of parents.
"With best wishes to those now leaving
school and kindest greetings to those that
will return next term, I bid all an affec
tionate good- by."

RAILROAD MEN DID NOT OPEN THEIR BOOKS
Four Officials of the Mar
ket-Street Company Up
for Contempt.
COUNSEL ADVISED THEM
TO KEEP MUM.
Accountant Folsom to Appear for
Sentence Before Judge Wal
lace To-Day.
MILLIONS SAID TO BE SPENT IN
CHANGES.
Mr. Freidenrich Intimated That Mr.
Clunie Committed Perjury When
He Swore to the Complaint.
The proceedings in the Siebe examina
tion in Judge Wallace's court yesterday
were enlivened by the flat refusal of the
railroad officials to produce their books
showing the operating and legal expenses
of the Market-street Railway Company.
Judge Wallace thereupon adjudged Vice-
President Alvinza Hayward, Auditor
Thomas, Secretary Willcutt and Account
ant Folsum guilty of contempt. At a later
stace of the proceedings Judge Wallace
ordered Accountant Foisom to appear for
sentence at 2 o'clock this afternoon, his
contempt having been committed in tbe
presence of the court by his failure to pro
duce certain inventories which were
produced ia court on the day before
and which he was allowed to tske away on
the theory that he would return them yes
terday morning.
Affidavits in the case of the others were
made out in the afternoon and will be
acted upon to-day.
Something of a breeze was created by
the announcement that Mr. Clunie pro
posed to prove by the books of the com
pany that Assessor Siebe had been paid
$10,000 by the Market-street Railway Com
pany. This statement was denounced by
Mr. Freidenrich as an absolute falsehood,
whereupon Mr. Clunie remarked that be
remained in this City during the exposure
of official corruption. He did not leave
town as Mr. Friedenrich had done. This
example of superior bravery had a pleas
ing effect upon the lobby.
Auditor Thomas was the first witness
yesterday morning. He was asked
whether he had brought with him the
books, as requested by the court on the
day before, and he replied that he had not
because he had bf en instructed by Secre
tary Willcutt not to do so.
"So-," asked Judge Wallace in surprise,
"you decided to disobey an order of this
court because Mr. Willcutt requested you
to do so?"
Mr. Thomas admitted the impeachment,
was adjudged guilty of contempt of court
and was ordered to appear for sentence
hereafter.
Secretary Willcutt was called to the
stand and stated that acting upon the ad
vice of Alvinza Hayward, vice-president
of the company, he had instructed Mr.
Thomas not to produce the books.
The court adjudged the witness guilty
of contempt.
Then Mr. Hayward was called He ad
mitted having instructed Mr. Willcutt not
to produce the books, but denied that Sec
retary Wilicutt had informed him that
Judge Wallace had ordered the books to be
brought into court.
Judge Wallace thereupon informed Mr.
Hayward that he was adjudged guilty of
contempt.
Chief Accountant Folsom, he who on the
day before had lightened up the gloom of
his black skull-cap with venerable gray
whiskers and a glad smite, came on the
stand as a sheep to the^shambles. The
smile had gone the way of the last rose of
summer, and he cast an appealing eye
upon his Honor.
"Mr. Folsom, you had certain invento
ries here yesterday, which were records of
this court, and you were ordered to bring
them back. Why are they not here?"
Mr. Folsom explained that he was un
der the orders of Secretary Willcutt, and
that the secretary instructed him not to
take the inventories into court.
"You took them away yesterday," said
Judge Wallace, "by permission of the
court, with instructions that they should
be brought here this morning. I cannot
permit such disobedience. The order of
the directors must not be allowed to super
sede the order of the court."
Mr. Folsom hastened to explain that
he was simply Mr. Willcutt 1 s assistant,
and he could not tell whether he had
brought the inventories or not before com
ing into court. He had been obliged to
obey the orders of his superiors.
Here Secretary Willcutt arose and in

formed the court that he had sent for the
missing books, and Lawyer Freidenricb
followed with a statement to the effect
that no contempt had been intended.
Mr. Willcutt was recalled to the stand
and testified that a meeting of directors
had been held in the morning before tbe
opening of court. There were present Al
vinza Hayward, Secretary Willcutt and
Charles T. Lathrop, two less than a
quorum of the nine directors, but they
held a conference on the matter of Judge
Wallace's order for the production of the
books.
"Was any one else present but you
three?"
"No, sir."
"Were any of the attorneys of the road
present?"
"No, sir."
"You took this action on your own re
sponsibility, without consulting your at-
torneys?"
"Yes, sir."
"Messrs. Hayward and Lathrop advised
that, did they?"
"Yes, sir."
"Do I understand," asked Judge Wal
lace in glacial tones, "that the wishes of
three of the directors are to supersede the
orders of this court?"
Mr. Wilcutt denied this proposition.
His evidence as to the fact that no one but
the three was present was flatly contra
dicted later on by the evidence of Director
Lathrop, who swore that Russell Wilson
was present and advised the directors not
to allow the books to be brought into court.
Mr. Hayward was recalled and the oath
was administered by Judge Wallace. In
response to questions put by Mr. Clunie
he said that he was not familiar with the
value of the property bf the road, but he
knew something about it. He did not
know much about the cost or the value of
the road. In his deliberations as one of
the directors he had been guided with
reference to those matters by the reports
of the construction committee and other
committees.
"It is a pretty large concern," he added,
with an apologetic wave of his hand, "and
1 have not the time to examine personally
into all its affairs."
On. being further interrogated the wit
ness admitted that he did not know how
many committees there were or their per
sonnel. He bad served as a member of
the finance committee, but could not re
member who the other members of the
committee were.
"Did you, as a director, vote for the is
suance of $17,500,000 of bonds?" asked.Mx.
Clunie.
"I did."
Mr. Freidenrich rose with a hasty ob-

Peep at the Stern Face of Jud^e Wallace. Treasurer Smith Tells What He Does Not Know

jection and moved to strike out the
answer, but Judge Wallace denied the re
quest.
The bonds were issued. Mr. Hayward
explained, for the purpose of taking up
outstanding bonds and for improvements.
He, however, did not remember what was
the amount of tbe bonds outstanding, but
he thought a little more than $7,000,000.
He had carried 15,000 Omnibus bonds and
surrendered them for cash at par when
the consolidation with the Market-street
Railway Company was effected.
Charles T. Lathrop was called to the
stand and was asked as to his knowledge
that the court on the day before had
ordered the books of tbe company to be
produced. He replied that he did not
know. He admitted that he was present
at the meeting of tbe directors yesterday
morning, and that he had been then and
there advised by bis counsel, Russell J.
Wilson, that it would not be necessary to
produce the books.
Mr. Wilson was present when he and
riay ward and Willcutt were in conference.
He had not known what the object of the
conference was. On being pressed for the
reason why he had taken Mr. Wilson there
if he did not know the subject of the con
ference, he said that he brought Mr. Wil
son there to find out what was the matter.
After consulting they decided to keep toe
books in the office, the books being under
control of the board of directors. He ad
mitted that Mr. Willcutt was instructed
not to produce them in court.
Mr. Clunie asked that Mr. Lathrop
should be adjudged guilty of contempt,
and the court granted the request.
When Mr. Lathrop, in answer to other
questions, said that when he voted for the
issuance of $17,500,000 of bonds, if he did
so voteâ but that fact be did not remem
berâhe must have had a general hearsay
idea of the value of the property, but he
had made no examination as to the value
of the stock. After the bond issue had
been voted he bought thirty-six shares of
the stock. He did not remember what he
had paid for them. He knew, he said,
that the bonds had been authorized at that
time.
Mr. Freidenrich came to the rescue at
this juncture and asked the witness
whether if the entire number of shares of
stock, amounting to 186,000, had been
thrown upon the market at once the
market value would not have been
depreciated. Thus, if thirty-six shares
were quoted at $40 the 186,000 shares would
not fetch near that price. The witness re
plied that the value would be depreciated.
He thought that lie paia $40 a share or
thereabouts for the thirty-six shares.
Mr. Clunie then inquired whether if the
entire slock, 186.000 shares, were thrown
upon the market the witness would give
ii a share. The witness said that if he

high as $10 a share, probably $15.
Then be was asked why be had paid $40
a share for thirty-six shares when some
body else owned the remainder, but Mr.
Lathrop's memory went to sleep again.
He finally exDlained that he did not pre
tend to be an expert as to the value of the
property. He simply represented the
Stanford estate, and that is bow he came
to be a director. When he cast his vote in
the board he voted with the majority of
the nine who were supposed to know all
about the affairs of the company.
On objection being made by Mr. Freid
enrich to this line of examination, Mr.
Clunie announced that he proposed to
show that Mr. LathroD represented 15,000
or 20,000 shares of stock in the road ; that
he had familiarized himself with the value
of the stock, and that the fact that he did
put his thirty-six shares on the market at
$47 or $48 per share,' was an indication that
he had considered the stock to be worth
that t>rice.
Judge Wallace remarked that Mr.
Lathrop had sworn that he was not an ex
pert as to the value of the stock, or of the
property of the road, and Mr. Lathrop
was excused from testifying further.
Secretary Willcutt, with a very solemn
countenance, took the witness' chair and
was asked whether he would produce the
books as ordered by the court. He replied
that he would do so if Mr. Hayward would
give permission.
"Do you mean to say, sir, that you will
not obey the orders of the court?" de
manded Judge Wallace sternly. "You
are ordered to produce those booKs at 2
o'clock, and see to it, sir, that this order
shall be obeyed. You are here, sir, not as
a director, but as a citizen, and you must
obey the orders of the court."
Mr. Willcutt meekly promised that he
would.
But he didn't.
N. T. Smith, treasurer and one of the
directors of the Market-street Railway Com
pany, testified that he wa-< not familiar with
the value of that property, and did not
think it possible that any one else was.
If he wanted to obtain information as to
the property owned by the company be
would apply to Secretary Willcutt. As to
the value of the property he would say
that outsiders, such as real estate experts,
mechanical engineers and railroad experts,
would be most like^v to know.
Of the $17,500,000 of the new bond issue
I. W. Hellman made a contract with ti.e
company for $3,700,000 wortu, most of
which were delivered to Mr. Hellman for
a syndicate represented by him. Of this
amount $1,800,000 worth had been sold at
par with commission included, and the
remainder had been sold at $105 with com
mission. They were sold to Hellraan on
behalf of a syndicate represented by him,
of which he said Daniel Meyer and the
Bank of California were members. The
other members be did not remember.
By the terms of the resolution under
which the $17,500,000 bonds were voted
no bonds could be issued until work
I on the road had been actually done, said
Mr. Smith.
Here Judge Wallace requested Mr. Fol
som to appear for sentence at 2 o'clock
p. m. to-day for contempt.
After the noon recess Secretary Willcutt
was called up. He looked troubled, and
the reason became apparent when he an
nounced that W. F. Herrin of the Southern
Pacific law department had advised him
to disobey Judge Wallace's order.
Mr. Clunie announced that be expected
to show by the books that money had been
paid to Mr. Siebe by the Market-street
Railway Company.
This remark brought Mr. Freidenrich to
bis feet in a white heat. He denounced
the [statement as an absolute falsehood,
and added that Clunie's affidavit, on which
the warrant had been issued for Mr. Siebe'a
arrest, was also false. The proceeding, he
charged, had been instigated by pique.
"This man," he continued, "has the
effrontery to state that this accused has
been bribed and that the books show it.
It is an absolute falsehood, as false as the
oath which this man took when he filed
the complaint before your Honor."
Mr. Clunie remarked that he did not
understand that Mr. Freidenrich's state
ment would have any weight with the
court. If he had taken a false oath tbe
courts were open and the machinery for
his punishment was ready.
Then he went on with a fierce glare at
Mr. Freidenrich's whiskers : "If this state
ment came from uÂ» nnÂ« of standing iv
this community I would deem it worthy
of my resentment. I will state here that
when the corruption of courts and officials
was being; investigated here I remained in
this City, while the counsel on the other
side left the City. â¢ â¢ â¢ I propose to
show by these books that $10,000 was paid
to Mr. Siebe, not on this occasion alone,
but on others."
Judge Wallace asked Secretary Willcutt
whether he was willing to produce the
books which were in court yesterday, and
Willcutt, after consultation with Mr. Mc-
Enerney, announced that he would do so
N. T. Smith was recalled and explained
that at the time the resolution authorizing
the issue of $17,500,000 was adopted, neither
he nor any one else knew anything about
the value of the property. It. was not a
question of the value of the old property.
It was proposed, with the revenue to be de
rived from the sale of bonds, to build new
roads and extensions, to the valDe of five
or six millions or more. He did not re
member what roads were in contempla
tion. It was understood, however, at the
time, that the population of the City would
increase, and that more carrying facilities
would be necessary to accommodate the
increased demand. There was no definite
basis upon which the ten millions of bonds
| had been added to the old seven millions of
bonds. The old bonds were bearing in
terest at 6 per cent, and were selling in the
market above par. It was necessary to re
serve enoueh of the new bonds to take up
the old bonds when they should become
due. The interest on tbe old bonds was
paid by the Marketrstreet Railway Com
j pany out of its earnings. The new bonds
i bear interest at 5 per cent.
I The witness admitted that $7,000,000
worth of the new bonds were reserved for
the redemption of the old bonds at ma
turity; then between $3,000,000 and $4,000,
-000 worth had been sold to Mr. Hellrnan's
syndicate. The remainder was to be re
served for the construction of new roads
and improvements. The stock of the road
was quoted in the market at $43 and $44
per share. He had 1000 shares or so, but
he had not offered them for sale.
The witness explained the manner in
which money was drawn through him
from the treasury of the Market-street
Railway Company. All vouchers for legal
expenses were signed by William F.
Herrin and Secretary Willcutt. The wit
ness was asked particularly as to the
manner in which the saiary of E. Black
Ryan was paid, but he could not remem
ber how or by what company Mr. Ryan
was paid. He Knew nothing whatever
about the books or accounts of the com
pany.
Mr. Clunie failed to extract sny informa
tion of value from Mr. Smith and be
turned the witness over to Mr. Freiden
rich, who tried to lead him gently along
the pleasant paths of inquiry into moneys
expended for construction, or as to the
dates on which horse-car systems were
changed into cable or electric systems, but
Mr. Smith declined to be led out of the
treasurer's office, and to almost every ques
tion responded, "I do not know," or, "I
am not aware of it.'*
He deviated from this method of an
swering when he replied that it cost the
Market-street Railway $3,000,000 to change
from a horse-car to a cable system, for
whicb sura it incurred a bonded indebted
ness.
He did not believe that tbe Market-street
system could find a purchaser at all if it
were thrown upon the market at the pres
ent time.
"It requires a whole lot of money to pro
tect it from injurious legislation," contin
ued Treasurer Smith ; "a railroad property
is very sensitive. You can't find ail capi
talists willing to invest their money in
property that they cannot control. If it is
.decided that tho Railroad Commissioners
have control of thin property it will affeclJ
the value very materially. If. for instance,
the company were obliged to carry passen
gers for 3 or 4 cents a head instead of 8
cents the value of the property would be
destroyed."
Mr. Freidenrich argued that a cable road
costing millions became valueless as a
cable road when converted into an electric
road, and that therefore the $3,500,000 ex
pended in making the change from anorse
to a cable system did not add that much
to the value of the road.
Mr. Clunie said that the change in
creased the value by diminishing the op
erating expenses, because it was not to be
assumed, as Mr. Freidenrich seemed to
want it to apear. that the company made
the change solely for the purpose of losing
three million and a half dollars.
Mr. Smith explained that the change
did not increase the receipts, it simply re
duced tne expenses of operating the sys
tem. He added that the value of a road
would be seriously affected by the pros
pect of a competing road paralleling it.
"We had to fight very hard to keep a
trolley line from running down Market
street," added the witness.
"How hard did you fight to keep out
that opposition?" was asked. "How did
you win that fight?"
"Well," replied Mr. Smith, gazing con
templatively at the ceiling, "that is so
long ago that I don't remember."
The answer provoked a smile.
Edward Barry, a broker and secretary of
the California Stock and Bond Association,
was called and by request of counsel band
ed to the court a list of the thirty members
of that organization. He produced the
records of the board to show the market
value of the stocks and bonds of the
Market-street Railway Company. He was
not a member or an employe of the rail
way company and his memory was excel
lent. He answered all questions unhesi
tatingly and showed that he understood
the operations of the Stock and Bond
Association.
The hour of 4 p. m. having arrived an
adjournment was had until 10 o'clock this
morning.
UDGE WALLACE'S REALTY.
His Honor Closely Questioned In
the Siebe Perjury
Case.
Assessor John D. Siebe appeared for pre
liminary examination on the charge of
perjury before Police Judge Campbell at
7:30 o'clock last night.
C. L. Ackerman, attorney for the de
fendant, moved to dismiss the complaint.
He thought the court should take into
consideration the apparent malice in the
allegations of the complaining witness,
Darragh, and also note the evident incon
gruity existing between his testimony in
the Superior Court and the facts sworn to
in the present complaint.
He was answered by Messrs. Batrgelt
and Bernard for the prosecution and the
motion to dismiss was denied.
Judge W. T. Wallace was called to the
stand and Attorney Baggett kept his
Honor answering questions concerning his
financial standing and taxable worth for
over an hour. His Honor was an interest
ing witness.
"How much is your furniture worth,
Judge? Do you mean to say that it is not
more valuable than these figures ($1500)
would indicate?" was asked.
"Well, I don't think it would sell for
more than that. It was bought many
years ago and we keep it for old associa
tion's sake."
To other pertinent questions as to the
Judge's worldly possessions the latter
made frequent reference to his business
agent, William Geizelman, saying that he
intrusted all of his affairs to him. He al
lowed him to make out his assessment
schedules, collect rents, superintend im
provements, etc.
A query as to what his Honor was
worth on the Ist of March, 1895, brought
forth tbe announcement that he owed
$20,000, and was not aware that any man
on earth was in his debt to the extent of
$100.
As to his income â well, Mr. Geizelman
did all his business for him, and he could
not be exact in his statements.
"What did you pay for your family resi
dence on Van Ness avenue, Judge?"
"Fifty. two thousand dollars.
"Has it not improved in value since you
purchased it?"
"I really cannot say. The house is old
and has deteriorated much in value."
"But the property on the avenue has
greatly advanced in value, Judge, has it
not ?' '
"Well. I suppose so, but â "
"Would you sell it for the assessed val
uation placed on it?"
"I really could not say," and so on to the
end of tne chapter.
Judge Wallace was explicit and to the
point in his answers, and they all pointed
to his business agent as being the only one
who was in possession of the exact figures
and facts regarding his real and personal
property.
The examination was continued nntil
this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
HE MAY CONFESS.
Charles Favor Expected to Tarn State's
Evidence and Implicate
Others.
Some months of solitary confinement in
the County Jail have had effect ou Charles
Favor, who was recently held to answer
by United States Court Commissioner
Ueacock on charges of bribery and extor
tion.
It is generally understood now about the
Appraisers' building that Favor is ready
and willing to turn State's evidence and
fasten guilt on at least one man who is be
lieved to be implicated with him.
Favor and Martin Cleary, both Custom
house Inspectors, were suspected of doing
crooked work in Chinatown, and espe
cially in connection with tne Wong Sing
case.
Cleary was arrested first at the insiiea
tion ot Special Agent Major Moore, but he
was exonerated upon a preliminary ex
amination on account of lack of evidence.
Now, it is expected that sufficient evi
dence from Favor and Wong Sing may be
had to prove deary's euilt.
An incident tending i.o lend color to the
statement that Favor intends to make a
confession is the fact that United States
Jud^e Morrow has reduced his bail from
$1000 to $500 at tbe request of United
States District Attorney Foote.
The latter, at the lime of Favor's incar
ceration, was strong in his demand that
the prisoner be shown no favors. His bail
must be heavy, and no one must be al
lowed to see him excepting in the presence
of a United States Deputy Marshal. His
change of tactics at this time is regarded
as being the result of the expected confes
sion.
THE INCOME REDUCED.
Mrs. Stanford Has Her Allowance Cat
Down.
Upon her own petition the monthly al
lowance to Mrs. Jane L. Stanford from the
millions left by her husband has been re
duced from $10,000 to $2600. She says in
her petition for a reduction that $2500 a
month is a fair and reasonable amount,
and is sulficient to meet all of her ex-
f lenses. The payment of the bequest of
2,500,000 to the Stanford University re-
I'uces the income from the estate by
$120,000 a year, and this makes it neces
sary to reduce the allowance.
To Re Tried Here.
I. F. Ramacotti, arrested Wednesday for
forgery in Los Angeles, will be tried here first,
and yesterday he was detained on two charges
of forgery, the complaining witnesses being
Bernard Donnelly, grocer, Bush and Fillmore
streets, and H. N. Meyer, grocer, Ninth and
Mission streets. If he should nut be convicted
here he will be sent to Los Angeles. Rama
cotti was traveler for Eberhart's brewery in
New York. He was at one time a deputy Sher
iff here.
Carrie Sankoy'i Note.
Carrie Sankey will have to pay the $1000
note she made in favor of Ernest L. Kriske.
She bought a lot of trinkets at Kriske's store,
and to secuie payment she signed a note for
$ 1000. In court"yeÂ»terday she said she signed
the note under duress and when she was not
responsible, but all the same she will have to
pay it. Her evidence was not strong enough,
and judgment went for the plaintiff.
Accused of Aanault.
Felix Heimmi, a butcher, 21 yean of age,
was arrested last night on a warrant charging
him with assault. The complaining witness
is Annie Kelly, a pretty girl, 13 years of age,
living at 1708 Fillmore street. Hciman denied
the charge, and said he could prove an alibi.

MINERS' HOPES
TO BE REALIZED.
Tirey L. Ford Returns From
Washington Encour
aged.
LOBBIED FOUR MONTHS.
Mineral Lands Bill Now in a
Way for Final Favorable
Action.
EIVER BILL TO BE VETOED.
But Both Houses Sure to Surprise
Grover by Carrying It Over
His Wish.
Ex-Btate SenatorTirey L. Ford returned
Sunday from Washington, where he has
been for four months working in the inter
ests of legislation beneficial to the mother
industry of California.
Speaking yesterday of his mission and of
what the miners may hope for, he said:
I was never so glad to get back to a place in
my life. For me there is but one place to live;
there is but one California. When I left Wash
ington tbe weather was oppressive and the
heat was sweltering and as I came through
Missouri 1 was dodging cyclones.
As to my mission to Washington we had two
principal measures before Congress. One was
a bill to create a commission to examine anA
classify the mineral lands in the railroad
land urr.nU in California. That bill passed
the House without much effort. We had some
opposition in ihe House committee, but on
that committee were Bowers of California,
Wilson of Idaho and Hartmann of Montana,
three men who effectively stopped any opposi
tion. McKeu oi Arkansas also helped us.
After the bill passed the ' House and went
to the Senate and was referred to the Senate
Committee on Public Lands then our first
great battle began. The opposition made a
determined stand iv that committee and had
the assistance of the National administration
operating through the Interior Department.
This was one ot the hardest fights we had.
Senators Perkins and White deserve special
praise, for they exerted themselves tirelessly
in the cause. Senator Dubois of Idaho, chair
man of the Committee on Public Lands, was
our friend and his position gave him an oppor
tunity to do effective work for us. Our other
special friends on tbe committee were Senator
Berry of Arkansas and Senator Pasco of Flor
ida. We got a unanimous favorable report
from that committee.
In the Senate there was also much opposi
tion, and it was led by Senator Stewart of Ne
vada. The bill was lelayed considerably in
the Senate while we were waiting for data from
California for which I had telegraphed. As
soon as the data was received the bill was vig
orously pushed in the Senate, and through
some very skillful parliamentary work by
Senators Perkins and White the bill passed the
Senate some two weeks ago.
The Senate had added some amendments la
matters of detail, and it became necessary for
the bill to go back to the House for concur
rence on these amendments. Upon its return
to the House it was referred to the House Com
mittee on Public Lands, which committee
promptly reported it back to the House with
recommendations that the Senate amend
ments be concurred in.
The bill is now on the House calendar await
ing an opportunity to be called up for final
action. There is certainly no reason why this
bill should not pass and become a iaw. There
are seven membcta of the House looking after
it. and there ouzht to be no difficulty now. It
would be a great misfortune if by any chance
the bill should now fail of final passage.
The other matter in which our people are
especially interested was to procure an appro
bation of $250,000 for restraining barriers to
protect the navigable rivers of the State and
to permit the resumption of hydraulic mining
if the same can be done without material in
jury to other interests.
Our great fight in this matter was before tb.9
House Committee on Rivers and Harbors. Wo
soon discovered that the appropriation could
not be obtained as an independent proposition
and that the only possible way to secure it was
to have it incorporated in the river and harbor
bill, and thus be carried through by that meas
ure- Our efforts, therefore, were all concen
trated in securing its insertion in the river and
harbor bill by the House Committee on Rivers
and Harbors.
In this fight we had the opposition of the
Anti-Debris Association of the Sacramento Val
ley, ana had, furthermore, to overcome the
idea that seemed generally to prevail in the
committee that the approrriationwas intended
to aid a private industry. It took a vast
amount of hard work finally to aecure the in
sertion of this item in the river and harbor
bill. In fact, when the vote was first taken the
committee was adverse to the insertion.
Things looked pretty blue and it seemed that
all our efforts were lost Then it was that the
hard work began that finally resulted in suc
cess. Two members .of the committee, Bar
rett of Massachusetts ana Hooper of Wiscon.
sin, continued their opposition until the last.
Hooker of New York, chairman of the com
mittee, Herman of Oregon, senior Republican
memoer, and Catchmgs of Mississippi, senior
Democratic member, were our steadfast
friends.
At the last moment Speaker Reed was per
suaded to come to our assistance and to his)
influence was largely due the final result.
When the bill reachea the Senate Senator
White, who was a member of the Senate Com
mittee on Commerce, secured some needed
changes in the language of the item, which
were afterward agreed to by the House.
The item as it now stands is precisely as the
miners have always asked for it, and in the
only shape in which it could possibly have
been obtained.
The river and harbor bill containing this
Item has gone to the President, where it will
doubtless be vetoed, but the executive veto
will be overruled by both houses with a celer
ity that will startle the occupant of the White
House.
In short, the two principal measures desired
by the miners of California nave made much
better progress than we had hoped, and we
may now indulge the highest expectations of a
speedy and complete success.
