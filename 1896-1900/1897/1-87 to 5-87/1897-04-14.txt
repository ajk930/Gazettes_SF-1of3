CONSTANTINOPLE, Turret, April 13.
The popular clamor for war has in
creased until the people are unanimous in
favor of beginning hostilities immediately.
The position of the Sultan is analogous to
that of the King of Greece. With the
Greek aggressiveness on one hand and the
subjects on the other wild with desire to
march on Athens, the consensus of opin
ion is that the Sultan must soon yield to
the pressure and war is inevitable.
ATHENS, Greece, Aprii 13. â According
to advices received to-day the insurgent
Greeks in Macedonia have occupied Bo
siova. a town east of Baltino.
Assim Bey, the Turkish Minister here,
to-day viaited the Foreign Otiice and asked
M. BfcOQZM, Foreign Minister, why the
Greek troops did not prevent the violation
of the frontier by the insurgents. Skcuzes
retorted: "Wny did not the Turks pre
vent the invasion?"
Later in the. day A-Â«im Bey again vis
ited Skouzes and reasserted that Greek
regulars had taken part in the invasion.
lie declared that the Ottoman soldiers
had identified one of the leaders of the in
vad.ern.asa Greek colonel. sirea
uousiy denied the accusation. These
charges and rebuttals are somewhat of im
portance in view of Hie eagerness of both
sides for war, and are probably attempts
by each side to make a beginning without
appearing the aggressor.
The Greek National League is planning
a formidable secret movement into Turk
ish territory. Ii is sa;d to have already
sent a force of ; XK) so-called irregulars to
seize strategic frontier points, intercept
Turkish supplies and gain the rear of the
Turkish army. Toe plan contemplates
the Â«ending of 10.000 troops into Aloama,
Epirus and Macedonia. Although the
Government has ordered the interception
of this expedition, it is covertly sanction
ing the movement through subordinates,
who purposely disobey the order, ex
plaining they cannot spare men enough
to subdue ilie irregulars. The volunteers
from Athens hay." reached Arta, and more
are on tne way. It is the intention of the
Greek? when all is ready to attack and
capture Janina, which, according to the
treaty of Berlin, rightluily belongs to
Greece.
Another force of irregulars is preparing
to cut off Turkish communications with
Salonica, whence the Turks at Elassona
derive supplies. If the attempt is suc
cessful, the three Turkish array divisionsâ
the eastern near Salonica, central at
Klassona, and western at Janina â in ad
dition to the army corps at Gr.vena, can
be cut off from communication.
Greece's naval man'-uv^rs are al-o s?ig
n:ficant. One of it 3 fleets is near Aria,
another commands the approaches to the
island of Salouica, prepared to capture it,

THE CITY OF SALONIKA, Showing the Position of the Harbor.
Salonika is the base of supplies of the Turkish armies in Macedonia. It is a city of about 80,000 inhabitants, situated at
th<Â» head of the gulf of the same name. From here a railway extends to the tiorfhwest, connecting with a line which reaches
Bucharest. Austria has always had a hankering for Salonika, and Great Bntain.it is believed, would be gla*l to annex it.
Externally the city has an imposing appearance, and bears a strong resemblance to a portion of San Francisco when viewed
from the bay. It is inclosed by walls five miles in circuit, its numerous minarets and domes interspersed with gardens of
cypress. The city was the residence of Cicero during a part of his exile, and was raised to (he rank of a Roman colony by the
Emperor Valerian. The harbor is now crowded with transports and ships of war, ana presents a most animated appearance.
and the third fleet is off the island of
Skyro, prepared to attack the Turkish
islands in the ..Egean.

SEATTLE, Vakh., April 13. â The
Greeks, probably 6IA) all told, residing in
the towns and cities on Puget Sound, are
organizing, preparatory to answering the
first call to arms of their King. A pre
liminary meeting was held last night in
this city, at which thirteen descendants of
the HÂ«ilenes signed the volunteer roll.
Now formal steps toward organization are
being taken". From the interest thus far
manifested it is safe to say that from 200
<.o 300 able-bodied men would quickly re
spond to any call that King George might
make.
The meeting last night was held in the
store of Nicboia? George. A general meet
i ing of all the Greeks in Seattle is to be
called some time this week. Nicholas

Though a Mohammedan by education
and religion, the leader of the Sultan's
forces in Macedonia is said to be a Greek,
a native of the Isle of Scio, where he tva^

massacre, which so nearly depopulated
the island. When yet quite a boy he be

brated Turkish statesman Khosru Pasha.
He soon attracted the attention and the
favor of his master by the manner in
which he performed the servile duties al
lotted to him, and was sent in 1832 with
three other you'hs to be educated at
Paris. There he uecanie a student at the
Ecole dcs Minis and quickly distinguished
himself by bis patient application and
aptitude for study. He remained in this
school until 1835, making in the mean
time several tours through France, Ger

him and he rose rapidly, becoming in 1849
aide-de-camp to Abdul Btftdjid, the reign

imperial guard. He likewise fulfilled the
duties of chamberlain of tho imperial
palace and was a member of the council
of state. Upon the dismissal of Ali Pasha,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was ap

NEW YORK. S. V., April 13. -The Her

"The passage of the tariff bill through the
Senate is assured regardless of what
amendments may be made. I have made
a careful canvass of the situation and find
forty-tive Senators who can be depeniieu

These represent the least possible strength
of the bill on its final passage, and con
stitute a majority of one, as the Senate
will probably stand when a vote is taken
with two vacancies, ana the majority may
be increased to two if the Kentucky Legis
lature can succeed in electing a Republi
can.
"The actual majority by which the bill
will oe passed is sure, however, to be con
siderably larger than this on account of
the attitude of the silver Republican Sen

obstacles in the way of the Republicans.
On ttie other hand they wiil insist that

CHICAGO, 111., April 13.â Treasurer
C. W. Spalding failed to keep his promise
to meet the trustees of the Illinois btate
University to-day. He had been sojourn
ing in retirement ever since it became
known that a great many bonds belong
ing to the university, supposedly in his
custody, had been offered for sale. The
trustees elected Eldrulge G. Keith, presi
dent of the Metropolitan National Bans,
as treasurer to succeed Spalding and de
cided upon steps to prosecute the default
ing treasurer.
One of the trustees said Spalding had
sent a list of securities with which he
offered to meet his liability to the uni
versity. The face value of these was
about $400,000. The board will try to find
ont what the securities are actually
worth, but they admit they lave little
taitn they will net much. Spalding's
proffor of ihe list is to convince them he
has not the university's own bonds and
cannot pet possession of them. The trus

pretty certain they have bÂ«en robbed.

Secretary Shrrmnn .sr-Â»i'/Â« a T>iÂ»patch to

LONDON, E.\G., April 13.â The Daily
News will say to-morrow: Henry White,
American charge d'affaires, presented to
the Foreign Office on Saturday an impor
tant dispatch from his Government with
reference to the Bering Sea seal fisheries.
The dispatch declared that the Alaskan
fisheries are being destroyed by pelagic
hunters and urged the necessity of put
ting a stop to the reckless butchery of
seals. The dispatch also expressed a de
sire for the holding of an iniernational
conference to consider the matter.
The tone of the note is friendly, but
firm. It shows that the United States is
prepared to demand that the killing of
the seals be stopped whenever such kill
inc is detrimental to the ordinary breed
ing of the herds. The United States, it
is added, beiieves that the British expert
who took the party of inquiry into the
fisheries in 1896 concurred in the views of
tne American college.
The answer that will be made to the
note by the Foreign Office may possibly
be delayed. The matter will not be fully
dis-cupsed until the arrival of Hay, the
new American Embassador.
REACH AN UNDERSTANDING.
Republicans Accept the Tarms of the
Opposition With Regard to the
Senate Committees.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.â When
the "steering committee" pi the Senate,
representing the Republican and opposi
tion forces, assemble to-niorrow the prop
osiflon submitted by the Democrats ana
their allies will be accepted ana a basis
for the reorganization of the committees
reached. This ba4s is simply a continua
tion of the arrangement made for tne l3st
Congress. The Republicans will be ac
corded the chairmanships and control of
important committees, except than on
finance, which will continr.o to be a tie
between the Republicans and Democrats,
with Jonea of Nevada (Sit.) holding the
balance of t>ower. The Republicans, in
Morrill, will possess the chairmanship.
Two vacancies will be tilled, one by a Re
publican and one by a Democrat. The
vacancies in the committees will be appor
tioned according to the strength of the
two sides, the Republicans tilling 43.8$ and
the opposition the remainder.
In this division Kyle, originally elected
as a Populist, is counted among the Re
publicans. He seems to have gone witn
them for ail practical purposes. There
are now .'55 Republican and tjtf Democratic
vacancies. By this arrangement, as un
derstood by the Republicans, they will
secure the chairmanship of the following
committees now held by tha Silver Re

Indian Affairs, Pettigrew; National
Banks, Mantle; Claims, Toller. Whether
the majority position will permit both
Teller and Pettigrew, both silver Repub

A GREAT SURPRISE TO
MERCHANTS.
The D3atb of the Senior Partner
Precipitates the Dis
aster.
SETTLEMENT IS PRACTICALLY
DEMANDED.
Mr. P ke Declares That Outstanding
B 11s Far Overbalance the
Liabilities.
There is a sensation in local mercantile
circles. The well-known wholesale liquor
firm of Coblentz. Pike & Co., doing busi
ness at the corner of Halleck and Battery
streets, has been practically forced to the
wall, and it is given out quietly that its
financial embarrassment will reach in pro
portions something like $100,000.
Tne information that this big house,
which had long been considered as stable
as a rock, was in financial difficulties came
in tne nature of a shock to the commer
cial community. It was wholly unex
pected, and few who wera inierested in
u.e house's welfare had an opportunity
to prepare themselves for it.
Scarcely over a week ago Joseph Cob
lentz, the senior member of the firm, died.
He was loosed upon in his lifetime as a
very wealthy man and one of tue most
careful business men on the Pacific Coast.
That the house was in a flourishine condi
tion no one ever doubted, particularly
after the successful manner in which it
was steered tUrough dangers that beset all
mercantile concerns during the past three
years of hard times and life-sapping de
pression.
But the passing of Mr. Coblentz, it ap
pears, exposed an unlooked-for state of
affairs. It was found upon making au
accounting that instead of being rolling
in wealth, so to speak, the firm was en
tangled in debt and obligations to such an
extent that, in view of the inevitable pro
bate proceedings over the deceased part
ner's estate, there could be no escape from
a raid on the part of the creditors.
Boaz Pike, the surviving partner, was
keen enough to see wiiat the future had in
store for the establishment, but was
plucky, and, rather than throw up the
sponge at the start, he deliberately noti
fied the creditors of the true state of af
lairs and asked for a private conference
with them. After they had recovered
from their surprise they granted his re
quest. Nothing definite came of the con
lerenl-e, except that Mr. Pike was asked
what he proposed to do, and he asked lor
a day or two to think the matter over.
Every effort has been mado by thos*
who are concerned in the disaster to keep
the affair quiet, but tbe anxiety of some
of the creditors, and their consequent in
ability to prevent themselves from talk
ing, let the secret out, and yesterday it
was the chief topic of conversation along
the wholesale streets.
"Well, 1 guess there is no need of mak
ing any fuss about the matter, as lone as
the story is out," said Mr. Pike, when
seen yesterday by a Call representative.
"We are up a tree, ami that is all them is
to it. Just where we are going to land I
am unable to predict, but I'm afraid it
will be wrong side up.
"To what do I attribute our embarrass
ment? Well, Mr. Coblentz died and
leaves a number Of minor heirs. His es
tate will naturally have to so through the
usual administrative process, and I as the
surviving heir and trustee am left in such
a predicament that I can see nothing bat
storm cionds above me. The executor
cannot permit me to go ahead as I would
like to, for he has his trust to look after
and to protect. The probate proceedings
will not come up in court until the 19th
inst. and in the meantime I am left float
ing between heaven and earth.

"When my son was 7 years old he began
to complain of soreness on both sides of
his neck, and soon lumps began to gather
on one side and grew to bait the size of an
egg. We then became more uneasy and
began to doctor him for scrofula. He
gradually grew worse,' however, until at
the age of 12 years we naa lost all hope of
his recovery. He became so weak he
could sit up but a few minutes it a time.

mended -as a great blood purifier and we
sent and got a bottle. We began giving
oar boy the medicine according to direc-
tions and it was not long before we saw he

until he was in very good health. He is
now 13 years ola and is well." We recom-
mend Hood's Sarsapanlla for all troubles
caused by impure blood." S. M. Silver,

the estate whereby tbe house would keep
afloat..
'Our creditors are business men who
want their money. We have money
enough due us on our books to offset.our
liabilities, and have lots to spare; but, of
course, that is not the pointâ that d^es
not satisfy the creditors. Just what the
latter are going to do with me Ido not
know. It is my misfortune, end I guess
I will have to stand it."
It is understood that the majority of the
creditors favor an immediate adjustment
and a settlement at so much on tbe dol
lar. The Board of Trade has no particular
interest in tbe disaster, because the greater
portion of the creditors are not members
of that body. If a settlement, such as has
been suggested, be agreed upon, it is be
lieved that 25 cents on the dollar, or pos
sibly a little better, wili be the ba-is.
Arrest deal of sympathy is expressed
for Mr. Pike among the business men. He
is very popular with them, and has always
been noted lor his fair business methods
and his ability generally. The opinion
prevails that he has met with a misfor
tune which he could not avoid.
LEVEES GIVING WA
Further Calamities From the Continued
Rise of the Big Riversâ Uter
Despair of the Sufferers.
VICKSBURG, Miss., April U -A tele
cram was received this morning from
Ashwood, La., asking that boats and
barges be sent at once to Davis Island,
twenty -five miles below Vicksburg, and
stating that the residents had given up all
hopes of saving the levee around the
island, which protects it from the back
water of Lake Palmyra. The principal
plantations on the island cover 80C0 acres
of the richest land in the Mississippi Val
ley.
A telegraph message from Bruna<vic!z,
raceived at noon, asked tbat boats be sent
to Australia Island to remove stock.
This valuable tract of land is owned by
Ashley & Co. There are over 10,000 a- res
on the p.antation in a high state of culti
vation. Tne island was protected by a
complete protection-ievee, wt.icu gave way
this morning. The water is fast covering
the property. The levee had withstood
all previous floods, having a record of be
inc the only one above the high water of
18S2 on the river from Memphis south
ward.
The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Rail
road can no longer run trains north. The
entire line is covered with cars to keep the
track from floating away.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 13.â The
rapid rise of the river from Vicksburg to
the gulf during the last three days has
been far er^-a:er than expected and leaves
little hope of saving the .evee. The rise at
Vicksburg has been one foot and one
tenth. There is no indication of any re
lief. Senator Cordill, one of the best
levee experts in the State, telegraphs from
St. Jo-eph that the people have given up
in despair.
A great crevasse is inevitablo on the
Louisiana line. The Mississippi has
broken if record at nearly all points be
yond the Ymzoo in the ia^t two dais. The
river at, Vicksburg is above the famous
high-water mark of 1883, which destroyed
nearly the entire levee system and
wrought damage which it took a quarter
of a century to recover from.
At New Orleans the river is now 18.2
feet, and rising at the rate of two-tenths of
a foot a day. Thibodeaux, in Lafourche
parish, the outlet of the Mississippi, is one
and one-half feet above the highest ever
known there, and it is considered certain
there will be some breaks. These heights
represent the average condition of tue
river from Vicksburg to the gulf.
The next twenty-four hours will prob
ably settle the question whether the Lou
isiana ievees can withstand the flood any
longer.
OMAHA, Nebr., April 13.â More than
100 families here have been forced from
their homes in the lowlands by the floods
of the Missouri. They had to go quickly
and everything was abandoned to the
water. The flood is pouring upon the low
lands of the East Omaha bottoms in a
stream estimated to be 2000 ieet wide.
One branch cuts directly eastward,
pouring into Florence Late. The mass of
water ia the hike has broken up the
levees built to separate it from the cut-off
lake and is now rushing into the latter.
This is the old channel of the river, and
many fear r.hat the turbulent Missouri
will come back to its former bed.
A second breach of the flood is sweeo

TWO ADMIRALS
TO BE RETIRED
Beardslee and Brown Will
Soon Give Way to
Younger Men.
Commodore Miller Wi!', on Pro
mo ion, Take Command of
the Pacific Station.
Other Changes Include the Placing cf
S card in Charge of tbe North
Atlantic F.eet.
WASHINGTON. D. C. April 13.â A
number of important changes affecting
officers of bieh rank in the naval service
have been decided on by Secretary bong.
One of the orders directs Commodore
Joseph N. Miller, who will soon be made
admiral, to assume command of the Pa
cific naval Btation, succeeding It -ar-
Admiral Lester A. Beardslee. This is an
important assignment iv view of the
state of affairs in Hawaii, through the
Hawaiian Government prohibiting Japan
ese imm'gration. Hv.vaii is included
within tha geographicai limits of the Pa
cific station. The flagship Philadelphia
is on the way to Honolulu, and litiitt will
relieve Beardslee there. This change in
command will probably mark the retire
ment from active service of Beardslee.
He announced some time ago his inten
tion to retire voluntarily in February,
under the long service clause, but the
admiral held on, and it was supposed he
would serve the rest o; the time allowed
him before compulsory retirement on ac
count of age.
Miller is the present corumtndero* the
Boston Navy-yard. When he goes to
Honolulu he will be relieved at Boston by
Commodore Henry L. Howison. Captain
Norman Farquahar, who commanded one
of the three American vessels destroyed
at Apia in the Samoan hurricane, will suc
ceed Rear -Admiral George Brown as
ranking officer of the navy in command
of the Norfolk Navy-yard. Brown will De
relieved from duty June 1, preparatory to
retirement on the 19th. Actine Rear-
Admiral Bunce, commander-in-chief of
the North Atlantic station, will change
places with Commodore Montgomery Si
card, commandant of the Brooklyn Navy
yard. The promotion of Sicard to the
rank of rear-admiral will follow the re
tirement cf Beardslee.
Secretary Long tias decided upon a grad
ual reduction in the strength of the
North Atlantic flVet. During the next
tew months he will retire from active
service several ships now in commission,
both on the home station and abroad.
The Secre tary's programme is 10 go into
effect immediately following a review of
tne fleet in the North River, after the
Grant monument ceremonies. Secretary
Long said to-night he had decided on this
policy as a matter of economy, not to
show the administration he regarded
trouble with Spain or any other Govern
ment now as more remote than a year
ego, when the Government began to plan
the placing of the navy on the strongest
war footing. All vessels retired, the Sec
retary says, will be in condition for im
mediate service if called upon.
The disintegration of the big fleet be
gins May 1 by the retirement of the triple
flyer Columbia, attached to the home sta
tion, which broke the record three years
aeo for vessels of her class. Soon after
the Minneapolis is to be withdrawn from
the European station. Both ships are
sister vessels with three screws and almost
too expensive for the navy to maintain in
service. The withdrawal of the Min
neapolis will leave the Mediterranean
fleet but three vessels, as it is the purpose
of the department to retire the Cincinnati
on the arrival out of the Raleigh.
About June 1 or 2 the monitors now
with the home fleet will be laid up and
possibly some cruisers. By that time the
battle-ship lowa, the Helena, Wilmington
and Nashville will be ready for duty. The
biÂ»{ cruixer New York may also be laid up
later. With the lowa in the service there
will be three first-class and two second
class battle-ships attached to the fleet.
Two of these battle-ship? and either the
Arcphitrite or Terror will also follow the
reserve list, so by the middle of summer
the greater part of the present strength
of the home station will be composed of
new vessels to be commissioned this
spring.
The gradual reduction in the fighting
efficiency of the station wili continue un
til the autumn, when the fleet will be
again formed more powerful than ever for
maneuvers in Southern waters.
Under the appropriation of the last
Congress several thousand dollars is to be
expended this summer in deepening the
LÂ«ague Island water front so a large fleet
can be accommodated the year round,
ready for service on two weeks' notice
and maintained in perfect condition. In
laying up these vessels Secretary Long
says he will now be enabled to save the
Government many thousands of dollars
yearly without reducing the fighting effi
ciency.

WHITE HOUSE ACTIVITY.
Many Office- Seekers Ac Eirly on the
Sceneâ Niw Rules Restricting Call
ers Go Into EffjC.
WASHINGTON, 1). C. April 13â The
White House was again a scene of polit
ical activity to-day, being the first time
sin cc Wednesday Jast that the public has
had a chance to see the President. When
the dours opened there was a b:g crowd on
hand looking for office. After 1 o'clock,
however, bat few people applied for ad
mission, as the rules restrictinc callers to
morning hours went into effect for the
first time. Only persons with whom the
Presi ient makes appointments will be re
ceived afternoons.
Several appointments were made to
day but not sent to the Senate. A large
batch of nominations will probably be
sent to-morrow, when it is believed the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs will be
named. This place seems to have been
allotted to ex- Representative P.ckler of
Scuth Dakota. He was at the Interior
Department this afternoon and had a long
conference with Secretary Bliss.
benator Platt called early, bringing up
the question of the successor of New
York's Postmaster, Dayton, and of As
sistant Treasurer Jordan.
Hanna and his colleague, Foraker, were
among other callers. The latter was be
sieged by omce-seekers laboring under the
delusion that he has some magic influence
with the President.
It was reported this afternoon that the
successor of Wade Hampton a* Railroad
Commissioner would soon be named.
General Hampton has been lying nt
death's door for the past fortnight, bul is
now better.
OF INTEREST TO THE COAST.
Representative Loud Does Not Intend to
Resign From Congress and Seek
the Postmastership.
WASHINGTON. D. U, April 13.â 1t is
reported in the California colony here
that Representative Loud will oppose the
appointment of Joe Spear as Surveyor of
the Port. The Call correspondent en
deavored to see Mr. Loud to-night, but
was not successful. Therefore, until the
Congressman is heard from, the report
may be regnrded merely as an idle rumor.
The nomination of James Martin of
Vermont to be Assistant S cretary of War
settles the fate of Colonel 11. G. Otis. It
was given out some time ago that no uâ â 
sistant eecrearies would be appointed
from any State that had a representative
in the Cabinet, but Colonel Otis' friends
still clung to the belief tl.at President Me-
Kiuiey would finally reward him by ten
dering him this appointment. Colonel
Oiis was not a candidate for any office,
and is not now. Nevertheless, if the Pres
ident had complimented him with this
appointment ne would have accepted. It
is tue understanding among t lie Califor
niana here, however, that President Mc-
K.nley feeis very gratelul toward Colonel
Otis for the valuable services performed
by him before and during ttia campaign,
and will soon offer him some post of
honor.
Senator Perkins to-night received a tele
gram from Louis Parrott, vice-president
of the Chamber of Commerce, respect
fully urging him to give especial attention
to ii:e protest against the abrogation of
the Hawaiian treaty. The protest ia now
on its way.
Senator Perkins was asked by The Call
correspondent to-night for his opinion as
to the probable passage of Senator Nel
son's biU, introduced to-day, providing
for the treaty's abrogation. He said he
had no means of knowing the disposition
of the Senator* upon this subject, but
would give the matier his immediate at
tention.
There seems to be no truth in a report
printed in S.ui Francisco to the effect that
Representative Loud will resign his seat
in the House if lie can be appointed Post
master to succeed McCoppin when the
latter's term expires. It was stated in the
newspaper article that Mr. Loud realized
that he would have a hard right for re
nomination to Congress and would ask
for the Postmastcrship. Mr. Loud is not
thinking of such a step. He will con
tinue in Congress as long as his con
stituents desire to keep him there. He
has now reached a point where he is
a commanding and conspicuous figure in
the House of Representatives. He enjoys
not only the confidence and intimate
friendship of SpeaKer Heed, but of all the
leaders on the Republican side. He is
chairman of one of the most important
committees of the House and is recog
nized as one of the strong characters in
that body, and has no desire to leave Con
gress so long as his constituents wish to
honor him.
M. F. O'Donoghue of San Francisco,
one of the cuieis of the General Land Oi
rice, draws a salary of $2000 a year. His
wife is h clerk in the Navy Department.
Still O'Donoghue is not satisfied. He is
endeavoring to have Mrs. O'Donogbue
promoted to a position in the State De
partment. He ts also trying to secure for
himsei: a position as one of the assist
ants of Attorney-General McKenna in thÂ»
Department of Justice.

JAP AX AX It HAWAII.
Seniational A tor If Concerning the Two
Hoi emment* Jt.jr plained.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13â The
Japanese legation has received advices
from Tokio and Hawaii which discredit
tha somewhat sensational stories growing
out of the refusal of the Hawaiian Govern
ment recently to permit the landing of a
party of Japanese at Honolulu. One
hundred and foriy-six members of this
party were contract laborers, and against
the return >of these the Japanese Consul-
Genera! made no protest. But the others
were voluntary passenger*, and were ex
cluded because it was alleged they did not
possess $50 each in golu. Against this
action (he Consul entered a strong protest,
as upon investigation it was found that
they bad the requisite amount, and that
they were denied the right of employing
counsel and of appeal to the Hawaiian
courts, which is guaranted by treaty.
The officials of tbe legation detiy that
tbe situation in one threatening serious
international complications, as the only
question which can arise is one of indem
nity. The Japanese Minister says the
position of his Government should not
Rive rise to any apprehension, as the
Japanese have none but the kindest sen
timent toward that republic, and have no
designs upon its independence. But one
Japanese man-of-war has been sent to
Honolulu, and that not for the purpose of
menacing the Government, but to assist
in preserving order amonu Japanese resi
dents who might become excitea.

MORGAN ARGUES
FOR BELLIGERENCY
Cubans Have a True Friend
in the Senator From
Alabama.
Eut Action on the Joint Resolu
tion ot Recognition Is
Postponed.
Lindsay Makes an Address in Support
of the Bankrnptcy Bill Pre
pared in Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I&â The
fourlh'day's speech of Morgan in support
of his joint resolution recognizing both
sides to tlie war in Cuba as belligerents
had very few auditors on the floor of ihe
Senate to-day. At one time tue number
of Senators was reduced to five Republi
cans and nine Democrats, and even on
these few the speech iell on unheeding
ears. This was because tue speech was
read from manuscript, and because much
consisted of tesiimony, correspondence
and documents. Morgan's explanation
of the?e citations was that the Senate
could not Bfford to pass such a joint reso
!u ion without having a proper founda
tion under its feet. He had, therefore,
devoted a great deal of time in placing on
record the lacts which Dad not yet fully
ana authentically appeared, some of
which were entirely new. He claimed
he had shown in parts of his speech
already made that citizens of the United
States have been subjected to unlawful
and barbarous treatment by the Spanish;
that the rights of the United State* as a
nanon, under the treaties, have been
openly, irequently and recklessly vio
lated.
The Spanish Government, be declared,
oucht to be compelled to recognize tbe
fact that war exists in Cuba. The war
has been earned on by Spain with sword j
and torch. He expressed a fear lest |
American people would cross the Gulf of !
M -xico as the Greeks were crossing tbe
Mediterranean to avenge cruei tortures j
which only tbe Turks and Spaniards
Dould inflict upon innocent people.
"We had," he said, "France 10 help us
in our travail, but Cuba has found no
France. That Cuba will be free is written
in the stars that glow in the unfailing
light of the Southern Cross, to winch her
children turn their eyes with hope that
grows brighter an the night of their sor
rowsgrows darker."
Morgan stated that other Senators had
decided to speak to-morrow on the joint
resolution and hoped to get a vote in a
few days.
The question of retroactive duties as
provided in the Dingley bill wa& touched
upon by a report from the Treasury De
partment, stating that orders bad been â 
given Collectors of Customs on tbe sub
ject, and by a joint resolution, introduced
by Vest, declaring such orders to be with
out authority and iv.violation of the stat
utes, the matter comes up to-morrow.
Chandler introduced two bills to enable
the Government to use the armor plants
of the Bethlehem and Carnegie companies
for the manufacture of armor plate for
battleships. The bills were referred to the
Committee on Naval Affairs.
Notice was given by Davis of Minnesota,
acting chairman of the Committee on I
Foreign Relations, that he would ask the I
Senate Thursday to proceed to the consid
eration of the arbitration treaty.
The bankruptcy Will navies: been taken
up, Lindsay addressed the Senate in its
defense, criticizing the substitute offered
by Nelson of Minnesota. There was noth
ing in iho committee bill, he said, which
compared in harshness with the insol
vency law of Minnesota, under which, as
Nelson had admitted, the people of that
State had lived without making com
plaints. There were twelve or thirteen
States, he added, which had involuntary
bankruptcy acts far more drastic than the
committee bill; yet Nelson's substitute
would subject debtors to those State acts.
Lindsay declared the pending bill one not
demanded by the creditor class, as bad
been suggested, but by the debtors who,
on account of general financial troubles,
were laboring undei loads of indebtedness
they coula not meet. It would be a relief
to them to ha7e a court to which they
could apply to take their property and pay
their debts, unshackling their hands bo
they might go to work again and become
useful citizens.
After a short executive session the Sen
ate adjourned until to-morrow.
The Senate confirmeJ the following
nominations: Alfred E. Buck, Georgia,
Minister to Japan; James Boyle, Ohio,
Consul to Liverpool ; Wat T. Beall, Reg
istrar of the Land Office, Leadville, Colo.;
Nathan P. Johnson, Indian Agent, Sis
seton reservation, South Dakota.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.â An
experimental tank in which miniature
warships will be tested will soon be con
structed at . th% Washington Navy-yard.
The tank is the , first of the kind in this
country and the largest under cover. Its
dimensions closely approach those of the
big dry docks and its depth will be suffi
cient to float any of the; smaller cruisers.
On all sides it will be covered. It will be
just 500 feet long, 50 feet across and 14 feet
deep. Running across and close to the
water will be a earrings, upon which will
be attached a dynamo-meter to register
the resistance due to towing: a model
through i lie basin. Models, varying from
ten to twenty feet, of every new ship will
be attached to this â  machinery, drawn
through water, the wave motion noted and
the resistance) carefully calculated. The
models will ba plain affairs and constructed
only with a view to presenting closely the
actual ; lines of the : *=hips. : â¢ Through these
experiments it is estimated that the plans
of alltb* proposed vessels can be improved
and valuable information gathered. : Tha
cost of the tank : will be $100,000. The use
of such tanks abroad is common. The
tank will be ready in about ten months.

Representative Loud Puts a

Political Co fin.
Gives the President Good Reasons
Why the N wspaper Publisher
Should Not Be Sent Abroad.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.-
Michael H. de Young thinks tie is
mr.king a still bunt for a foreign
mission, but it is not as still as
he thinks, for Representative Loua
is after him with a snarp stick. Mr. de
Young thought at first that he would like
to go to Rome, but was disappointed in
this. He now has his eye on Russia or
Belgium or "something equally as eood."
He would prefer Brussels as his seat of
residence for the next four years, as the
climate at St. Petersburg is a little too
colJ. Brussels is said to be the gayest
city in the world, excepting Paris. Mr.
Loud â alway solicitous about the welfare
of his friend De Youngâ thinks that Brus
sels would be a little too gay for Micnael,
while St. Petersburg would be a little too
cold. He has therefore said to the Presi
dent that in his opinion Mr. de Yaung
had better be kept at home. He gave the
President some good reasons why the San
Francisco newspaoer man should not rep
resent the United States abroad. George
Knight and George Heazleton are on the
ground doing wbat they can to promote
Mr. de Youiv's interest.
It is said that President McKinley has
been willing to recognize De Young in
some way, and it remains to be seen wbai
effect Congressman Loud's protest will
have. It has been filed at the White
House.

BADLY DAMAGED
With a Falling Tide, the
Vessel Settles Upon a
Sunken Rock.
One of the Piates on the Port
Side Indented and Many
Rivets Loosened.
The Hidden Reef Located at the En
trance of the Port Orctard
Drydock.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 13.â More or
less serious damages were sustained on
Sunday by the Government battle-ship Or
egon. With a receding tide it settled
upon a hidden rock at the entrance to the
Placet Sound naval station drydock, and,
notwithstanding every effort to get it off,
the vessel hung hard and fast upon the
sunken reef for two hours. At least one
of the plates somewhere on the port side
was bent and indented and many rivets
were loosened, but the Oregon was rescued
from its perilous position before springing
aleak.
The Oregon steamed up to the mouth of
the drydoct at high noon. Naval Con
structor Cappa intended to doct it at that
hour, but finally decided, in order to in
sure perfect safety, to wait for a higher
tide. Meanwhile tsie lines were thrown
out and t;ie battle-ship was moored near
the entrance. Thousands of visitor^,
lured thither by the report that the mon
ster war piece was goinc to be placed upon
the blocks, walked up and down the shores
admiring this one of tbe nation's finest
floating forts. The crowds dispersed and
soon the tides began to flow outward.
Just at 4 o'clock it was discovered that
tbe vessel was settling upon something,
and that it was upon a substance firmer
than sand. The report spread throughout
the ship with lightning rapidity. There
was great excitement for a few minutes.
Orders were given to try to pull the battle
ship off, the officers in charge believing
tbe obstruction might be a snag.
The effort was made, but in vain. Sev
eral other attempts demonstrated to the
entire satisfaction of the commander that
the Oregon could not be released save only
by an effort which would tear off one or
more plates, causing a leak which would
in all probability sink the ship. He de
sisted, but tbe battle-ship clung tenacious
ly the rock until 6 o'clock, when the tide
rose sufficiently to float it in safety.
Seven hour 3 later, at 1 o'clock Monday
morning, trie Oregon was successfully
docked. Neither the exact location nor
t he iull extent of the damage can be ascer
tained until to-morrow, as the vessel's
sides are being cleaned as it is pumped
out.
The discovery of this reef in such a lo
cality was a great surprise to the naval
station officials, as many soundings were
taken during the construction of tnedock,
*i>e BbsJtcvre'i depth found at extreme low
tide being twenty-six feet, whereas 3 the
Oregon draws only twenty-four.
REPAIRS WILT, BIZ COSILJ.
The Oregon Slay Be Kent to the Britith
Work* at Etijmtnali.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.â Word
reached the Navy Department to-day th&t
the battle-ship Oregon grounded on Puget
Round shoal last night. How badly the
vessel was injured is not known. Secretary
Long will not make public the text of the
dispatch from Captain Whiting, which,
however, does not indicate the extent of
the damage. He is waiting for a rrp irt of
the result of the examination at the Puget
Sound station, and is hoping that this wili
show the injuries to be slight. If the
damage is of such a character that the
battle-ship cannot proceed to srvme dry
dock other than at Bremerton the situa
tion is pretty serious, for the facilities for
repairing there are meager and a great
outlay of money may be necessary to pur
chase and establish machinery to put the
vessel in good condition.
One bit of consolation contained in
Whiting's message is that the ship is not
leaking. Whiting said the Oregon had
suffered a bending of frames and keei
j'laies and sustained other injuries of a
character believed to be serious. He
hoped to get the vessel in the drydock to
day, ao a complete examination could be
made. The Oregon was on its way to the
drydock when it went aground. It was to
have been its first experience out of water
since it left the stocks, and great interest
hmd been shown by naval officers in the
operation of docl:in~ the huge and valua
ble mass of iron and steel.
The aDsence of repair shops at. Bremer
ton is the most serious feature of t.ie Ore
con's misfortune. Unsuccessful efforts
have been made to secure an appropria
tion for repairing the plant, both for hulls
and machinery. It has been nrguod by
tiioae who favored the establishment of a
plant that there was no economy in hav
ing a naval station vf itnout the facilities
for making the necessary repairs.

in sea shape again. If the injuries are
serious it is not improbable the Navy De
partment will apply to Great Britain for
permission to have them corrected at E*
quimalt, provided tho Oregon is in condi
tion to make the trip to that point. The
Oregon s commander, Capt. \. S. Barker.
is, under the regulation?, responsible for
the safety of the vessel. He will un
doubtedly follow the usual course and ask
for a court of inquiry.
BARHAM AT SANTA ROSA.
The Congressman Scys California Will
Not Lose Through the New Tar ft
Schedule.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 13 âCon
gressman John A. Barham and family re
turned from Washington last night, pro
fessional business having called him
horn". He is paired on political Questions
and is not certain when he will return to
the capital. He is in splendid health,
having gained twen'v pounds during his
live months' absence.
Mr. Barham sueaks very hopefully in
regard to tariff legislation and does not
believe that any changes in the schedule
detrimental to California will be made by
the Senate.
"And California is on the schedule,
too, from raint to prunes.' said Mr. Bar
ham to a Call representative, "as we huve
a perfect right to be, having in our great
State almost every industry. Right here
in Sonoma County," he continued, "we
have the finest paint mine in the country,
but we must have protection to develop
it."
Speaking of the administration, the
Congressman grew enthusiastic and said
that it was democratic in the true *euse
of the word; that the President was a
nioj-l affable and approachable man. who
needed no bodyguardâ a man of the
people, devoted to tue welfare ot ttie
country and its people. The administra
tion would uphold the civil service laws
unless violated under the previous ad
ministration, and in that event those who
profited by the violation would not be
permitted to retain their offices. Those
who came into ollice re^uiariy would not
be disturbed without cause, so the Con
gressman declared, but the others would
be decapitated as rapidly as possible.
Mr. Barham seeru* to believe the Nica
ragua canaiis one of the possibilities of
the near future.

STOCKTON. Cal., April 13.â C. O. Gor
don, a neatly dressed young man about 26
years of age, waked into Sneriff Cunning
barn's office this afteruoon and said he
wanted to give himself up. Gordon said
that he bad been the agent of the Ameri
can Express Company at Bethel, Mis
souri, and that on January 19 last he had
fled from that place because he was short
fomething like $1000 in his accounts. He
came westward uml has been in California
for â¢several moiuhs. Finally his money
pave out and he could find no work. He
lived a pace that soon dissipated what he
took from the express company, and he
founa himself in Stockton without a
cent. For two days he waiked Ã¼bout
without be:ng at) c to got anyining to eat,
and finally concluded that it was heiter
to give himself up and face the conse
quences of his wrongloing rather than to
starve in a strangi- land.
Sheriff Cunningh <m lia* telegraphed to
the head of t c Aniercan Express Com
pany at St. Ljuis, and if Goidon is wante t
for the crime he claims he has com

TACOMA, Wash., April 13.â Samuel
Andrews, a Pacific-avenue merchant, has
played craps more or less regularly at th 9
Kentucky saloon, usually winning. One
night last week he lost, paying $80 cash
and several hundred dollars in checks.
Andrews alleged unfair play and "crooked
bones," causing a melee in which 4 lie se
cured one check and tote it up. His
friends claim tie then ascertained thai t.ie
i dice in use were not perfect cubes, giving
[ the houÂ«e an advantage of 100 per cent in
stead of the regulation 417 per cent.
Last evening Andrews began civi 1 action
against the proprietors to recover $80. and
a criminal action against ;he dealer. An
interesting trial* was expected until the
case was settled to-day by the "bouse"
paying the $30 and coats, and the suits
were dismissed. The police and Mayor
Orr are investigating.

RANDSBURG, Cal., April 13,â During
the brief history of this flourishing min
ing camp all sorts of important events
have taken place, including births, deaths
ana wedding?, but the historian oi the
camp was compelled to wait patiently
until the evening of the 12th day of April,
189", for an opportunity to record an
event of the latter nature.
Some time ago E lgar Scott fell a
victim to Cupid's dart and a few days ago
it was announced in camp that he would
lead Miss Louie Van Norman, one of
Randsburg's fair ones, to the altar and
make of her a blushing bride. This being
the first wedding in the camp prepara
tions on a scale in proportion to the impor
tance of the event were at once begun. The
skating rink, the largest hall in the camp,
was engaged, and, though it is in the
heart of the Mojave Desert, it was con
verted into a veritable bower ot loveliness.
Wild flowers in profusion decked the
walls on all sides. A railed platform at
one end of the hall was converted into an
altar and flowers were pi!ed in profusion
around and upon it, while suspended over
head hung a large floral bell.
To spread far and wide the news that
Raudsburg was to nave a wedding the fol
lowing posters were printed and scattered
about:

Promptly at 6 o'clock last evening the
wedding parade started for the hall
and marched through the principal
streets. The bride and groom were in a
coach and four, preceded by a band
and followed by the entire populace. On

Oroundlesa Report of the Killinff of
IhrÂ»* Men A'ear ftallarat.
RANDSBURG, Cai,., April 13.â Several
prospectors who arrived from Ballarat
last night deny the story that three men
were found dead in Dsath Valley. The
story of the triple murder by Panamint
Tom is without foundation.
On Saturday Ed Reid returned from
Ballarat and made the Btatoment that a
prospector had come into the new camp
with t lie news that three dead men were
found in Death Valley, about forty miles
from Ballarat, and the supposition wes
that they were shot by Fanamint Tom.
Reid thought the murdered men were
Ilh ay, Han born and Davis, the three
Colorado prospectors who were sent Â»nt
by local capitalists. The men had a four
horse load of provisions lhat would last at
least six months.
Early on Sunday morning the residents
of Rand<-Durg were startied at hearing that
William J. Langdon, Louis Goldsmith
and a man named Parker were killed near
Pansmint.
Every endeavor was made to show that
Langdon's party could not have been near
there, as it had left Randsburg only last
Thursday, and could not have reached
Ballarat. eighty miles distant, before Fri
day evening. Several of the late arrivals
saw and spoke to the members of the
Ltingdon party late Friday evening, and
Langdon was then going to his camp,
about six miles above Ballarat. Pana
mint Tom was in Baltarat on Saturday,
and took dinner with Charles H. Treat!
one of the men who arrive here last night!
William J. Langdon was one of the
original discoverers of Randsburg and has
a large circle of friends. Many telegrams
have been received here since the report
went out that he had been killed. These
friends may now rest reassured that he is
still among the living.
Haerantfilo linclnt) Filly Killed.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 13.â The
racing stable of George K. Rider met with
a severe loss to-day in ihe dea;h of a
three-year-oid St. Andrews filly, which
was killed in a try-out at Agricultural Park
prior to shipment to ban Francisco, where
she was to run her maiden race at Ingle
side. While running on the working
track the filly crowdei into the fence, ue
suite every effort of her jockey to keep her
off, and ran against a projecting scantling
which penetrated her body. The jockey
received a bid fall, resulting in a com
pound fracture of one of his legs. The
animal was valued at $1500.
OVATION TO FIIZSIMMONS.
New Yorkers Go Wila Over the Champion
of Champions, Woo Tells How He
Won ihe Fght.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 13,-Fitz
simmons was received here to-day with
great pomp. The champion came from
Washington. With Fitz immons were his
wife and baby, Ernest Roeber and John
HicKey. Long before the hour scheduled
for his arrival a surging crowd had gath
ered at the foot of Liberty-street ferry.
Fitzsimmons' appearance was the signal
for one loud cheer, which lasted several
minutes. He was compelled to doff his
hat time and again. The Sixty-ninth
Regiment band, on a tailyho decoiated
with Hags, led tha procession; Fiizsim
mons, in a barouche gayly decorated, car
riages bearing friends and standard-bear
ers carrying a huge Ha-: inscribed "Cham
pion, of (Juampiong, Welcome Home,"
following.
At the notel Fitzsimmoni' was escorted
to the balcony and the whole party was
introduced singly to the cheering crowd.
Mrs. Fitzsimmons was all smiles. The
crowd recognised her at a glance, and
after cheering lustily they called upon
her for a speech. Hhe simply waved her
band and said, "Thank you." Bob d.d
not cay anything, although urged by
Julian. In a room, however, he had this
to say :
"1 have not retired from the ring by
any means, lam still young and strong
enougn 10 defend the championship and
will keep in the ring until I see that I am
going back. The lalt about Corbett
meeting me again is all bluff. He doesn't
mean to tight me any more than my baby
does. He's a stiff; that's what he is.
The only thing he has in his favor is
cleverness. He can't punch a little bit,
and 1 wouldn't be afraid to tie mv hands
behind my back aud allow Corbett to
punch away until he got good and tired.
"It makes me smile to see now groggy
I was during the fight and how near I
came to getting licked in the sixth round.
The truth is I beat Corbett with one hand.
About four days before the fight I was at
tacked witti rheumatism of the rigut
arm. My Jeft hand wits in good shape,
and while sparring with my trainers I
had to use this hand exclusively. In the
first round of the fight I broke trie thumb
of the right hand oi Corbett's head.
After this the hand <ras useless and I had
to defend myself and punch entirely with
the left. Corbett simply nit and jumped
away. He was afraid to fight, for had he
done so be would have been settled
earlier.
"Tho blow which knocked him was
a left-handed swing for his btomach.
1 put Sharkey out the same way. As to
whether 1 will meet Corbett again I will
say this much: He must go ahead and
whip every man he told me to lick before
1 not a crack at him."
Manager Julian said that Fitzsimmons
would rest about six months and possibly
go to loroign lands this summer.

MYSTERY OF SAN
RAFAEL'S PRISON
Treasurer Fallon Tells of
the Tragic Suicide
of Argo.
With a Rope Made From His
Bedding the Prisoner Was
Strangled.
Murderer Kelly Witnessed the Samo
Startling Apparition S:en by
Annie X hce
SAN RAFAEL, Cat,.. April 13.â The
mystery of Marin's County Jail has not
been explained. That the ghost of Will
iam F. Argo haunts the corridors in the
basement of the courthouse any number
of prisoners are willing to vouch for, and
the thrilling experience of Annie Kehoe,
who saw the crouching figure of tbo sui
cide,Jsubstantiates the stories related by
The Wraith of Suicide Orth, as It Appeared Before Annie Kehoe in the Haunted Cell in Marin County's Prison.
Murderer Keily and others who have wit
nessed the horrible spectacle. That the
apparition, as described by those who
have seen it, answers the description of
William P. Argo, who hanced himself in
tjie cell which he has fcinco bsen accused
of haunting, is beyond the question of a
doubt.
County Treasurer J. T. Fallon to-day j
told the story of tiie trasic death of Argo,
which occurred during the time when
Fallon was under-Sheriff. Argo was ar
rested for bur.ilary committed at Ignacio,
in Marin County. He was brought to the
county jail in San Rafael on the 11th of j
November, 1839, and remained in jail for I
loce time. He keenly felt the disgrace I
and on the morning of December 9 of the '
same year he was found hanging in bis j
cell, dead. He had ripped up his bed and !
with the strips of cloth thus obtained j
made a stout rope which he passed j
through the opening in the top of the!
tank cell which served as a ventilator, i
Putting the loop arouiiji his neck, he
raised his feet from the floor and was j
slowly strangled. There he was found by I
the Sheriff's deputies in the morning.
Since that time the ceil has been
haunted. Annie Kehoe'a terrible experi
ence when she s^v the supernatural vis- ;
Itor staring at her in tiie darkness terrified i
her in the same manner as it has affected i
others. The mystery is uncxpl.iinable, j
and even thoso in churgo of the jail say !
that the placo is really hauntea. The j
prisoners in each instance have driven the
same description of the midnight visitor. '
Xo-day a thorough inspection of the ccli i
was made, but nothing that could throw |
any light upon the mystery could be |
found, in order to pass into the tank one
la comDelled to go through live iron doors, !
ana there is no possibility ol the 6trar.ge }
appearance being the work of any person j
bent upon mischiui. Tiie mystery is yet '
to be solved.

LEMON STATION TRAGEDY.
Pretty Concepcion Alvarez, a Descendant
of the Alvarados, Attempts
Suicide.
POMONA, Cal. April 13â Concepcion
Alvarez, aged Hi, attempted suicide at her
father's home last night and was saved
from deatb by a. physician after hours of
hard work. She i> a pretty Mexican sir!,
and lives with her father and uncle at a
miserable old adobe ranchbouse near
Lemon station. Her mother was one of
the historic A'varado family in California
and was repudiated by her family because
of her marriage to a rich young Mexican
twenty-live years ago. The mother com
mitted suicide by banging at San Fer
nando twelve years ago.
Little Concepcion has been disconsolate
because of her father's continued drunk
enness. When be came home with bis
team from Azusa early last evening he
was so intoxicated that his brother and
his little daughter had to carry him from
the wagon totne adobe house. When the
uncle had unharnessed and led the
horses be went to the house. The
drunken man lay in a stupor on bis pal
let and food had been put on the table for
the uncle's meai.
He looked about for Concepclon, and
found in her bsdrooru, pinned to her pil
low, a note scrawled hurriedly in Spanish
to the effect that Concepeion had pone
away to die. She wrote that she could no
longer stand the shame of her father's
drunkenness and his abuse of her. So she
wished forgiveness and had gone to die,
as she had long contemplated.
The uncle searched ior Concepcion, and
found her across the road lying in an
al.'alfa lor, unconscious from the effects
of some drug. Ho went pellmell on
horseback for a doctor some miles distant,
and when the doctor arrived ho and the
uncle worked all nicht on the girl, and
she was restored to consciousness by day
light. She Lad taken an overdose of mor
phine or she would have died from the
poison.

DEPLETING POMONA. >UHSEBIEb.
Unusual Demand for young Olive Tree*
During the Freient Seat on.
' POMONA, Cal., April 13. -This is the
most extraordinary season for the plant
ing of olive groves yet known in Southern
California. Since January 1 400,000 olive
trees for orchard planting have been
shipped from Pomona to all parts of Cali
fornia, Arizona and New Mexico and it is
estimated that the total shipments from
other olive-nursery towns to Southern
California must have been upward of
200,000 trees.
Several very large groves have been set
out in San Joaquin Valley with trees from
Pomona. One of them is in Fresno
County, and is the largest in the world.
It consists of 12,000 trees. It belongs to a
syndicate of Chicago men, of whom
Marshall Field ana ex-Senator Charles B.
Far weil are members. If the trees thrive
in the next twelve months this olive
grove wilt be increased by 10,000 more
trees. A remarkable fact in connection
with the boom in olive planting this
season has been ' the starting of olive
groves in the Green River country of
Utah. Pomona has supplied over
1.700,030 olive trees for orchards in the
past years. â¢ . : - ~\'-f'^

GEMS OF ART FOR
STANFORD'S HALLS
Priceless Group of Rare
Paintings From Far
Australia.
Contributed by Thomas Stanford,
a Brother of the Late
Senator.
Kept a Famcus Artist Employed for
Years in Depicting Antipo
dean Landscape
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cai., April
13. â Stanford University ha 9 been mag
nificently remembered by Thomas Stan
ford, a Melbourne citizen and brother ol
the la :e Senator Stan lord. Ho takes his
share of pride in tbe university. The
library is named after him, and some day
his fortune will go to swell the endow
ment of that part of tbe establishment
and make the library one of the richest
collections of choice and rare books in the
world. He is childless, having lost his
only child, a beautiful girl whose idolized
portrait hangs in his apartment at his
house in East Melbourne. His dearest
object in life is the bettermeut of tbe
university, with which he wishes to
worthily connect his name.
Thomas Stanford's remembrance con- j
gists o: a beautiful collection of paintings
wbicb will take their place in the art de- '
partment of the museum. He is a de- ;
vout lover of fine arts and bis private col- j
lection of pictures is one of the best in
Australia. About five years aeo he con
ceived the idea of sending to Stanford
University a collection of pictures of
Australian scenery by an Australian
artist, en tuat American art students could
form as perfect an idea as possible of the
bush, the lakes, the forests, the mountains,
the plains and the rivers of that region.
With this end in view he looked about
to find an artist, who, by his truth and
fidelity to nature primarily, 'his technical
skill and his poetic touch, could carry out
this idea. His choice fell upon J. W.
Curtis. He bad admired the workol that
artist for just those merits which he
wanted in a collection of pictures for
those who were not familiar with Austra
lian scenery.
The commission which Mr. Stanford
gave to Mr. Curtis was:
"Paint what you please; take your own
time; name your own price; don't hurry;
give me the best you can do, and make
the pictures really representative of Aus
tralian scenery."
For four years the well-g;nown artist has
| been working in a studio fitted up in the
j rear of Mr. Stanford's house, so that that
I gentleman could take an active interest
jin the progress of the work. He pro
| uuct'd liny paintings in all.
The pictures take their choice of scenery
from ail parts of Victoria. Thero are
Murray pictures. Alp pictures, pictures of
j Macedon in snow time, Gippsland Lake
| pictures and coast pictures. Many of the
scenes deDicted on the canvas were sug
gested by Mr. Stanford himself.
Mr. Curtla has the art to be derived only
from a painstaking study of nature,
bringing out the minute details of the
scene. Every tree he paints has a charac
ter of its own. His trees all live. They
! seem to grow from the canvas and to have
j their roots deep down in the painted soil.
1 The eucalyptus tree is the one unifying
feature of all the pictures. "Snow at
â  Wood's Point" is characterized as an Aus
tralian scene by the fantastic, disheveled,
uncoulhaess of the trees, which are un
doubtedly eucalyptus.
c One strong point Is the nainting of
water reflections. The water is in all the
i pictures most delicately and softly done,
j It is exquisitely gentle, cool and refresh
j Ing to the eye, executed with the truest
j perception of tne beauty of nature's im
j ages thrown back from a lake or rip
pling creek.
Among a number which especially de
serve mention are "Coo-ey, Good-night,"
"Biood-red Sunset." "Between Daylight
and Dark" and several in Echuca Part.
His undergrowth ia feathery, fine, tan
gledânot a muddled mass. Rocks are
done with due observance of their car
petiu g of grass.
The paintings, with the dozen or so al
ready in the museum, will make a superb
collection of Australian scenery.
WILLIAMS' LITTLE HEROINE.
Thirteen- Year- Old Girl Sacrifices Her Life
io Rescue a Companion Frtm
Drowning.
WILLIAMS, Ariz, April 13â One oF the
most largely attended funerals ever held
in this part of the Territory was that of
Mttlt Mazy Gray, the 13- year-old daughter
of E. N. Gray of this city. The circum
stances of her death were heroic in the i
extreme. With uncommon feminine dar- i
ing and heroism she dashed into a swiftly !
running stream to save the life of her
playmate, Maggie Brady. Maggie's life
wai saved, but the brave little pirl who j
went so boldly to the rescue was swept i
away by the current and drowned before
assistance could reach her.
The two girls and a third, Nellie.
O'Brien, all of about the same age, were
playing on the banks of Ctaract Creek,
wbicu is now running deep and rapidly.
Maggie lost her footing and fell headlong
into the icy waters, and brave little Mazy,
who was first to see the accident, imme
diately placed her own life in ieopardy
and jumpe.i in to save her comrade.
Macgie was fortunate enough to reach the
bank in safety, but the current caught the
rescuer and swept her away to martyr
dom.
It is doubtful if the records contain a
liner example of youthful heroism. Mazy
Gray was a most lovable child and a favor
ite among her companions. Almost the
entire population of the city turned out
to attend her funeral.
MOURNING IN GILROY.
Death of Mrs. Mary A. Van Schaick, a
Pioneer School Teacher of
California.
GILROY, C.v,., April 13.â The com
munity is shockei by the sudden death
of Mrs. Mary A. Van Sciinick, vice-prin
cipal of the Giiroy schools, which oc
curred at her home in this city last even
ing at 0:4 r ) o'clock.
Mrs. Van Schaick had taueht her classes
up to dismissal hour on Friday last, and
had appeared in her usual uood health.
On Saturday she felt ill, and rapidly grew
worse. Her relaives were summoned,
but she failed to recognize her son (ivy, a
student nt the University of California.
Mrs. Mary Alabama Van Schaick was
born in Alabama in 184 r >. She came to
California In 1852 with her parents, Cap
tain and Mrs. E. p. Dwight, now resi
dents of Ean Benito County. She was
a prominent factor in educational work,
having been enpaeed in teaching must of
the time for thirty years in Santa- Clara
County. At one time she served as prin
cipal of the Uilroy High School, having
beenpromoted Irom the grnmmer grade,
a position she held for many years. For
several years she conducted a private
school her' 1 , where students were
"coached" to prepare for teacher's ex
aminations. Xo teacher in this section
of the Slate ha 3 been more successful in
this line of work. Teachers from her
academy are scattered far and wide, and
number into the hundreds.
Her self-sacrificing nature and devotion
to her lie wort probably cost her her life.
At the time of her death she was inter
ested in preparing a class of forty-live
pupils to pass the grammar school ex
aminations in June.
Mr*.. Van Schaick was married In 1872
to 11. D. Van Bchaick, and had one son.
The whole community deplores and
mourns the loss of this noble, broad
j minded woman. The class at the school
. has been grunted a holiday until after the
i funeral, which will take place to-morrow
afternoon from the family residence. The
school flag has beon lowered to half-mast.
The funeral services at the grave will be
conducted by Unity Rebekah Degree
Lodge No. 24.
TROUBLE ON THE COLUMBIA.
S reined Relations of Fisherman and Can
nerymen Presage an Early
Conflict
PORTLAND, Or., April 13.â An Astoria
business man here to-day denounces the
Chinese demand that all white labor be
excluded from the canneries along the
Columbia River as an outrageous piece of
impertinence. He says That while some
of the cannerymen would be prepared to j
accede to this demand they are compelled
to ignore it, because of the indignant up
rising certain to follow.
He added that a feeling of uncertainty
pervaded thÂ» fishing situation. It was
simply out of the question for the can
nerymen to pay the price asked by the
flthermen (A 1 /, cents), and it promises to
De a tight squeeze between keeping even
and losing ou the season to pay 4 cents a
pound.
The fishermen threaten to start a co
operative cannery unless they obtain tueir
price, but in that event their concern
would be so glutted with listt, within a day
or two that they would be unable to handle
10 per cent of the catch. Just now there
is a representative of a New York house
along the lower Columbia offering the
iisherinen 4% cents for their choice catch.
That is about 25 per cent of the product
The rest he will lake at ruling rates only.
That, of course, will not work, and the
situation is assuming an alarming aspect.
The fishermen are growing desperate'and
as they are not a mild-mannered class of
people something serious is likely to
happen soon.
ARIZONA'S BANDIT KING.
Black Jack and His Band Start on

PHCEXtX, Ariz., April 13.â Word

ternational boundary line, from Bonora,
in Mexico, and are on their way to their

From Bisbee the news comes that Black
Jack and his gang attempted a raid on

Siding. Early in the evening as a cow
boy named Hand and the operator were

Winchester, wounding the robber. The

STOPS A STAGE ON
AN UPLAND TRAIL
The Yreka and Etna Coach
Robbed by a Single
Outlaw.
Wells-Fargo's Treasure-Box and
the Mail Surrendered by
the Driver.
Fasseigers Permitted to Proceed Un
molestedâBut Little Loot
Obtained.
YREKA, Cal., April 13.â The Yreka
stage, which runs between this place ami
Etna, was robbed of Wells-Fargo's ex
press-box and the Uni;Â«d States mail on
the north side of Forest House Mountain,
about ten miles south of Yreka, at 4 o'clock
this afternoon.
Fran* Hovey, who has been driving on
this line for a number of years, was band
ling the ribbons and waa accompanied by
five passengers, one of them a woman.
About halfway up the grade there is a
sharp turn with a large rock on one side.
The ariver and passengers saw no one as
they approached, but just as Hovey pulled
the leaders up to make the turn a man
stepped from behind tne rock, leveled a
rifle at the driver and ordered him to
throw oat the express-box and mail, a
command which was immediately com
plied with. The highwayman then told
Hovey to drive ahead, knowing he would
have ample time to sort out the more val
uable portions of his loot, as the nearest
habitation is fully eight miles further on.
The robber was a man of medium height,
dressed in dark clothes and wearing a
slouch hat and white mask. He appeared
perfectly cool and did not offer to molest

Mark Elliott Pc urns After Five
V ars Spent in Rhodes'

Telia of the Fich-mg With Natives
Following the Famous Jime
son Raid.
SANTA ROSA. Cal., v April 13.â Mark
Elliott of South Africa, the friend of John
Hays Hammond and adviser of Cecil
.Rhode", returned to his home in this City
yesterday after an absence of five years.
Mr. Elliott is a mining engineer of con
siderable prominence in South Africa, and
!>7<ent the first two yearn oi his absence in
Johannesburg, from there going to Ma
enonaland.
In the native uprising that followed the
Jameson raid Mr. Elliott had some most
exciting experiences, which he tells of in a
MARK ELLIOTT of Santa Rosa, the Associate of John Hays
Hammond in South Africa.
modest, matter-of-fact way that adds to
the charm of the narrative and holds the
fortunate iistener spellbound.
To a Call representative to-day Mr. Elli
ott toid a graphic 9tory of the rev>lt. He
said that it was instigated by the Mata
beles, who believed that while most of the
English wer^ away they could kill the re
maining white settlers and loot the coun
try undisturbed.
Although warned of the coming trouble
Mr. Elliott, with ten white men and
twenty-five friendly natives, continued to
worK the mine in wh c i he was employed
until compelled to flee lor their lives.
They fought their way to Fort fca isbury,
losing two men and killing several of tbe
enemy. As a relic of the fight he exhibits
a wicked-looking assegai, taken from a
native, wuorn he was lorced to quiet with
a bullet. At the fort 850 men were be
sieged by the warlike Mashonas for over
a month, but were finally released by an
armed English force.
The mines now being worked are, ac
cording to Mr. Elliott, the richest on
earth and are in ail probability the iden
tical spots from which the Ancients ob
tained their golden ornamonts, as well as
the gold which decorated Kuig Solomon's
temple. The African prospector does not
look for float rock or cropping, as is the
custom in this country, but sinks his shaft
in the abandoned claims that abound,
knowing that there he will find the yellow
metal. The claims are all petting richer
as the miners go deeper, and there are few
shafts more than 160 feet in depth.
Naive* are pai.l $2 r>o a month and
white miners not less than $5 a aay, but
Mr. Elliott does not advise W';ite miners
to go to South Africa to compete witn the
native labor unless under contract with
some well-known firm. The natives are
ruled with a firm hand by the authorities
in Ma-honalaiU, and up,n the least inso
lence to a white man are tied up to a post
and Bound ly whipped.
Prices of all kinds of produce, he say?,
are very high, and we teiiÂ« of paying $125
for n ick of potatoes, $10 for a chicicen
and $10 ii dozen lor eggs.
The mining engineer is greatly run
down in health and weighed only 139
pounds when he left Africa. Me will re
in uin here until rr>s;ored to health at
least. As. an Incidental discomiort o
South Africa, he tell* of how au attack of
rinderpes: kited twenty-eight cattie
bflfintinz to trie mine where he was em
ploye i, and of now seventy-rive of his own
tine transport oxen were shot by order ol

ban.c cause.
Mr. Eiliott believes Cecil Rhode* to be
the ereatem man of modern times ai:d
South Africa the coming country.
INDIGNATION AT STANFORD.
Athletes Oppose the Attempt to After Rules
Govern, ng it.c Intercollegiate
Match.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
13.â The published slate n ent regarding
proposed c Man ires in the reeulationa for
the coming intercollegiate field day has
stirred up a good deal of indignation
among the students. David Brown 97
said when seen regarding the disputed
points:
"The track teams, according to an in
lercoliegiate agreement, are governed by
tne rules of ihe A. A. U. This org.-.niza
tion, up to two years ago, specitied how
many points each place in a race should
count â the winner live, second three and
third one. Tins rule was then dropped
bj the A. A. U. In the year in which
Berkeley sent her track learn Bast, North,
k vrho was its manager, was anxious to
\ nave the same standard as that of the
Eastern colletree. That w;is two years
aeo. We offered no objection and ti.e
count was changed 10 tive, two, one. T m\
is the wry ii ha.i stood ever s-i.-jce. I do
not believe it is the fair ; hinr tochinne
the count jus' before the field day. If the
committees of the two universities having j
such matters in charge desire to make a
change the proper timÂ« to rtiscu-s the
matter is directly after ihe iie!d day. No
injustice will then be done either side.
'â¢The bicycle race has always hÂ«Â»en held
with the oiher track events. This year
B:'rkÂ«Â»ley wished the rac > to ha held on
the Yeloilronx* tracÂ«. I off>n'd to hoid it
there provided the race take place be
tween J and 2 o'clock on the day of the
intercollegiate meet. They did not ac
cept this proposition, although it was left
open for three weeks. Finding that they
were unwilling to accept ihe offer as a
whole I withdrew it. The statement tha'
there was an agreement to hold the race
on the Velodrome tracJr. the only point at
Issue bring the time of the race, is abso
lutely untrue."

PROSPECTUS OF
ASSOCIATED CLUBS
What the New Governing
Body Will Do for
Cyclists.
Much of the Work Formerly
Done by the League Will
Be Handled.
fhe Protest Over the Awarding of
the Relay Cap to Be Settled
To-Morrow Night.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
has issued the following statement to the
wheelmen ot California in further ex
planation of the abandonment of ttic
Nortn California Division, League of
American Wheelmen, and setting forth
iully what it is the intention of the asso
ciation to do for its individual members:
California cycling Is Just passing through
an â¢ poch-markii.K period in its history. The
siiUH.ioii lifts become such as to provoke
niueti comment and questioning- Tiie criti
cism and nisoussio i among ttie wheeling pub
lic of the rocent action of the board ot r ffieers
of this division of th* league are occupying a
prominent place in cycling nffurs, audio the
end that Uie wheeljaea of California may
come to a correct understanding of the facts
they are here briefly paced before them.
The members of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs and prominent stuJents of the'
sport had corr.e to believe that it was not lor
tne best interests of the wheelmen of the State
of California that the North California divi
sion of the Lesgue of American Wheelmen
should be longer maintained.
The benefits received from the North Cali
fornia division were entirely disproportionate
to the amount of money exppixled in main
laininglt. Last year we sent En- 1 more than
$13t;<). If the 1600 members ot the divisionâ
the number It contained April Iâ all renew,
$1040 would be retained by the Eastern
offices of the league and but $500 remain to l>e
used for the benefit of the California mem
bers. Tne only tangible return received by
the wheelmen of the State from the National
body is the League .Bulletin. Ail the other
benefits accruing from league memN-rship in
this State are the result of local effort in no
way aided by the National organization.
The roadbook, the handbook, the tourlntr
board, ihe legal protection afforded members,
the system of local consuls and lenguf hotels â
all ihe^e thing* are done with our own effort
and with what remains of our own money.
Desired legislation looking to the protection
of tne riehts and privileges of wheelmen aud
to the imi rovement of streets and roa>is is
entirely the result of individual and local
effort.
Again, California is a State far removed
from ihe seat oi government of the League of
American Wheelmen; the conditions are
vastly different from those in the New Eng
land States, and from our very remoteness it
has been recently demonstrated that ii Is im
possible to have the National Assembly of the
League ol Amoican Wheelmen appreciate
that a different condition exists here and to
provide legislation accordingly.
Tne California Associated Cycling Clubs has
heretoore been a federation of clubs, having
or its objects the establishment of amiCKble
relations among the eiubs of the State and to
promote road-racing. In all that it has under
taken the orgtinlznt on has mci with marked
success from its inception, for a period of five
years.
At ft meeting of the board of governors of
the California Associated Cycling Clubs, held
on April 3, such action whs taken as author
ized the extension of the scope of usefulness
of the organization and its aims and objects,
to incl'ide al! the functions of the North Cali
fornia division.
The California Associated Cycling: Clubs,
therefore, will hereafter furnish to its mem
bers, free of charge, a weekly official orpan;
letal protection ; reduced raies at hoteln; a
handbook containing the constitution and by
laws of the organiz uion, suecestions for tour-
Ing, h list of official hotels with reduced rates,
a list of district consuls, a list of repairers,
etc., etc.; a roadbook containing maps of the
ridable roads of the Slate, showing their qua l
ity and condition, together with tables of dis
tances between ei'.ch tow;i. and such informa
tion as will facilitate touring.
The work for gqod roads will be taken up
where the league division left off, and will be
continued as one of the main object* of the
orgxnizatiou till definite results are obtained.
Needed legislation by State, city nnd county
oftie<>rh will be agimted and obtained, aid nis
criminating and unjust enactments resisted.
TheÂ» association has al-o take:i control of
track-racing and adopted a set of rules for
keeping the sport clean, and for the protection
of naers and mee-D remoter*. It will grant
sanctions, and riders riding at meets not shiic
tioned by the association render themselves
liable to suspension lrom both track and road
events.
Two dollars is the paytoent for the initiation
fee iind the first year's dues; therefore, $1 a
year pays for membership. Any white person
over the ace of 18 years is eligible to iodivid
un! nv-mtjershlp in the association.
We believe that this step ot the C. A. C. C.
will increase iis success in the same measure
that it has increased us usefulness. The possi
bilities for a splendid cycling organization in
California are great. This is a wheeling State,
lull of lovers o: the sport in all its branches.
We have already accomplished much, and
with the co-operetion of the wheelmen ol the
Slate much more is possible. It is, therefore,
the duty of every lovai Californ a cyclist to
identity himseif without delay with the or
ganization that stands for Htate pride, State
energy and the advancing of wheeling In
terests within our borders.
For any information relating to the C. A. CL
C. apply to Stanley G. Scovern, secretary, 1590
Fulton street, San Francbco.
A special meeting of the board of gover
nors of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs will be held to-morrow evening at
the roomsof the San Francisco Road Clnb,
503 Golden Gate avenue, to consider a pro
iesi filÂ«'i against awarding the relay cup
to the Bay City Wheelmen.
CHINESE GAMBLING CASES
Important Point Raised by At
torney John E. Rich
ards
To Secure a Ccnviciion It Must B
First Shown That the Plac? h
a Gambling Place.
A very ingenious point was raised by
Attorney John K. Richards yesterday
afternoon on a motion before Judge Joa
chimsen for a dismissal in the case of
Woo Bing, charge! with visiting a gam
bling place at 815 Washington street.
Attorney Richards urged that according
to the strict interpretation of the statute
in order to secure a conviction it was
necessary to first show that the place was
tiued up and conducted as a gambling
place.
The statute says "any person that
keeps or. maintains a gambling; place," or
"any person who visits a gambling place."
It did not make any difference what the
purpose of the individual was, whether he
was there to gamble or not; unless it was
clearly shown that the place was â¢ gam
bling place there could be no conviction.
Tlie Judge decided to reserve judgment
till he had full opportunity of digesting
the point. â¢
If the contention be upheld it will have
the effect of making it almost impossible
for the police to secure a conviction in
Chinese gambling cases, as the Chinese
can keep moving from one place to an
other so that it would" tie difficult to show
conclusively that any particular place was
a gambling place. '

If the Boulevard Balboa Is to be com
pleted the citizens must keep up their
subscriptions a JittJe longer, the amount
of cash now being received falling far
short of that being paid out for labor.
It is useless to longer deny the fact that i
the fund is melting like the snow in June,
and unless it shall bo replenished the
work mint be stopped, with the result
that the $14,18335 already expended for
labor, and wisely and economically ex
pended, will be. so much money thrown
into the gulley. For a boulevard com
pleted in the middle and ending in a

A eood deal of curiosity has boen felt as
to w ether the French opera season

the prices ranged from one to three dollars,
there were many rows of empty benches,

It now transpires that the season, lisa

to tue extent of $1000 each in order that,

Ihe present prospect of expensive wars

The city elections in California on Mon

that we are less fickle than Eastern peo

pat while they fell down.
The desire of Wu Ting Fang to establish

than the telegraph could hare done it.
After such a scoop the Emperor ought to

Flowery Kingdom.
In his address at the recent unveiling of
the monument to "William I the Kaiser
in referring to the services of his grand
father in establishing the German empire
made no mention of his father, Frederick,
who took part in the war, nor of Bis
marck. The omission of these names has
raided no little comment, and the Kaiser
rould not more effectually have recalled
mom to the minds of the people by any
praise he might have bestowed on them
than he did by ignoring them altogether.
The British War Office has discovered
that the volunteer force of the country is
not such an effective defense against in
vasion as the people hava believed. In a
battalion 800 strong, which was given
twelve hours' notice to parade, some
of the men appeared in slippers, the
swords, rifles and accouterments were in
bad condition, the troop* could not drill
and one officer was found to be ignorant
even of the word 9of command. A force
of thiit kind would mace a poor showing
if any of the well-drilled armies of the
Continent should land on the coast of
England, and Ibe Government does well
in Â«t.renethening the navy.
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION.
President McKinley has taken the first step toward the establishment of Inter -
national bimetallism by appointing a commission composed of Senator Wolcott, ex-
Vice- President Stevenson and Charles Paine of Massachusetts to act for this country
in promoting it. This step having been taken, it is fair to assume that the commis
sion will act with promptness and that arrangements will soon be under way for the
assembling of the proposed conference.
The commission is one in which the people can have confidence. Senator Wolcott
|Is one of the strongest advocates of bimetallism in the Senate. He has been an
j earnest supporter of the remonetizatiun of silver for many years. In fact, so urgent
| haÃ he been in supporting every measure which tended to an enlarged use of silver as
a primary money metal, that he was long regarded as an extreme free silver man. He
did not, however, break away from the Republican party, as did Senator Teller and
j others at St. Louis, but continued to support the party because of its pledge to pro
j mote the free coinage of silver by international agreement. He can, therefore, be
counted on to exert every energy to accomplish the success of the undertaking and to
bring the proposed conference to an agreement which will permit the remonetizntion
of silver at an equitable ratio with gold in the near future.
The other members of the commission, while not so eminent in financial matters
as Senator Wolcott, are men whose appointment will be well received by the people.
Adlai Stevenson is a representative of the Democracy which supported Mr. Bryan in
1896, after havine supported Cleveland in 1892. He is a stanch partisan, of conserva
tive tendencies, and will undoubtedly do all that he can to assist Senator Wolcott in
promoting the conference.
Mr. Paine is one of the leading Republicans of Massachusetts, and while classed
with the gold-standard men is known to be favorably inclined to bimetallism by in
ternational agreement. As a representative of the business interests of the country
and the people of the extrome East bis appointment makes the commission a thor
oughly National one in every respect, and will add to the confidence which the people
of all classes and of all sections of the Union will have in Its work.
It is scarcely necessary to say that the appointment of the commission will be re
ceived with great satisfaction by the people. It will be especially gratifying to Repub
licans. The administration was elected to oiYice on the distinct pledge that it would
promote international bimetallism, and there has been some impatience because the
President did not refer to this subject in his message to Congress as well as to the
tariff. His action now is sufficiently prompt to give evidence that he means to keep
all the pledges of the Republican party and to fulfill them as promptly ai possible.
The work of arranging the conference now rests in the bands of the commission.
The administration has done its share. The people will watch with interest for the
next step In the Important work and will be well pleased if arrangements can be
made for assembling a conference o! the nations before the close of this year. The
work is an important one. It has been well begun and is intrusted to safe bands.
Let it go forward.
THE LINCOLN MONUMENT.
The movement begun by members of
the Grand Army to provide for the erec
tion of a monument in Golden Gate Park
to Lincoln has been no cordially taken up
not only in this City and in this State, but
by men of light and leading in all parts of
the Union, that its successful accomplish
ment is already neither improbable nor
remote. It needs only that the public
shall give to the promoters of the under
taking a fair degree of support to render
the Deginning of the work a matter of
speedy attainment.
The reasons why a monument to Lin
coln should be erected in Golden Gate
Park hardly need statement. They mv.it
be lemiliar not only to all men ana
women, but even to the schoolchildren of
the land. We cannot too often recall
the name and the fame, the deeds and the
services of Lincoln, nor can we in too
many ways manifest our appreciation of
his character and our patriotic love lor his
memory.
As will bo seen by letters in The Call of
yesterday and 10-day, the movement
begun on this coast has found cordial ap
proval in the East. President McKiniey
and others hardly less illustrious and emi
nent tend words of coraiai greeting to
those who are directing the movement
here and give to the undertaking all the
weight and influence of their sympathy
and their wordsof commendation. Thisap
proval of course comes in the very nature
of things. Throughout the length and
breadth of the Union the name of Lincoln
is revered, and whenever a new testimo
nial of the veneration of the people for
him is to be reared thousands of patriotic
men are glad to aid it by every means in
their power.
If wo are to have a monument to Lin
coln we should to it that it is in every
way worthy of the site on which it is to
be located, of the people who are to erect
it and of the man whose services it is to
commemorate. It should be no ignoble
monument that we raise to the great
President wno sustained the courage of
the people, directed the councils of the
Nation and urged on the armies in the
war that freed the slave and kept the
Union whole. The monument should be
one of the noblest and most artistic orna
ments of our great pleasure ground. Its
erection is an undertaking which appeals
to the best thoughts and emotions of the
people, and every one, in proportion to
his means, should contribute to it liber
ally, loyally and promptly.
THE IEEE MARKET.
If it be true, as reported, that action on
the part of the Board of Harbor Com
missioners to carry out the Jaw providing
for establishing a free public market on
tne water front would be met by an at
tempt on the part of commission mer
chants in this City to have the proceed
ings stopped by injunction, the sooner
the Commissioners begin the work the
better. If the validity of the law is at all
doubtful it should be brought to a test at
once, in order that the producers of the
State ana the consumers of the City may
know whether or not they are to have the
much-desired market.
The law does not seem to make it
optional with the Commissioners whether
or not they shall provide a market. It is
mandatory in ils terms and directs that
such a market must be opened. That
being the case the commission can have
no sufficient excuse lor delaying the work
of preparing for it. If a market sufficiently
large cannot be provided at once it is at
least possible to make a beginning, bo
that the experiment may be tried during
the coming fruit season.
It is only by experience and by a test of
such a market in actual operation that we
can determine its value to the community
and to the producers and ihe effects it wiil
have upon commission merchants. Even
if a beginning has to be made in a very
small way it would be well to make it at
once in order that these tests may be tried
this year and a better understanding had
of the provisions to be made for the mar
ket in ensuing years.
The subject has been lone under con
sideration and has been thorouehly dis
cussed in the press, among farmers and
in trade circles. The law, therefore, is
not in any sense a matter of hasty legis
lation. It was provided by the Legislature
in response to a strong and widespread
demand. It is as lair in its terms as any
that could be devised, end it is only by
putting it in op-ration that we can deter
mine clearly whether It will work injury
to any one. It is the duty of the com
mission to provide the market, and that
duty should be fulfilled as speedily as
possible. _____________^

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14. 1897.
KICKING AT THE AIB.
In the exhilarating exercise of kicking
at the various i;is which we assume to be
â¢ ssailing us we doubtless are enjoying
ourselves, but after all it is hardly fair
that in this selfish indulgence we should
overlook the remedies which our solicit
ous lawmaker! are devising for the re
moval of the ills which we assign as the
causes of our kickings, as in the case, for
example, of the law just passed to alle
viate the tramp difficulty in this State,
against which many of us are still letting
fly our protesting toes as though nothing
had happened to make their flight super
fluous.
In view of the real raagnituae of the re
form which has been made the continued
skyrocketing of our boots into midair
after an evil star which no longer glim
mers there crows visibly less dignified
with every distortion that we undergo in
the effort. A wire run through the sides
of us for us to revolve on, and nothing but
air within the immediate circumjacence
to impede our flying feet, wouid furnish
an imitation of the revolving jumping
jack beside which our present antics
would make a favorable comparison. We
really should pay enough heed to our
changing laws to know when to stop kick
ing and to guard our attention against
the escape of so important a reform as the
Dague tramp law, which recently issued
from the Legislature.
This measure is calculated to entirely
remove the necessity of either begging or
starving on the highways of California.
It is no theory, praise God I It is a prac
tical ordinance. It provides for the sub
division of the State Into road districts,
corresponding with thecountv supervisor
districts, and to the overseer of each road
district thus created any man may go and
obtain employment at a fixed salary of 35
cents aday and board and lodeing. Trampi
who exhibit a languid unpersuaslon of
the worth of this arrancenient will be
confronted by the argument of compulsory
board and lodging worth a good deal iess,
with a ninety day?' sentence to wort upon
the highways at only 10 cents a day. Â£tl
-dence of their subsequent conversion to a
normal appreciation of the arrangement
will be followed by their promotion to the
ranks of the "honorably employed," by
which title the sincere roadworkers are to
De known.
From this unostentatious bit of legisla
tion the people of California have gained
a most thorough solution of "the problem
of the idle tramp." It is imnossible to
define the limits of the innovation. It
simply leaves nothing to be desired. Let
it be carried out according to the letter
and it will be a complete realization of tne
hopes which have striven in our breasts
for many past days, and a splendid in
junction against the aspiring soles of our
footgear.
THE LOS ANGELE3 fIESTA.
The abandonment of the plan to bo.d a
carnival in San Francisco t.ia year has
deprived us of the pleasure of receiving
from Tk)s Angeles a manifestation of her
full and abundant sympathy with San
Francisco enterprise. It was the inten
tion of the Los* Angeles people and those
of Southern California generally to make
the Golden Gate Carnival an occasion for
a display of State patriotism and an evi
dence of their appreciation of the value of
California unity in all enterprises what
ever of a public nature.
It will be remembered that in 1895 Mr.
Meyberg, as director-general of the Los
Angeles fiesta, came to San Francisco on
behalf of the celebration to interest the
people of this City in it, and succeeded so
well that San Francisco sent large excur
sions to take part in the Los Angeles fes
tivities. Mr. Merberg intended to make a
re: urn of this favor by arranging for
Southern California excursions to San
Francisco when our carnival was held, and
bad proceeded far enough in his work to
make it certain that Southern California
would not only send a large number of
people to take part in our carnival, but
would contribute several floats to add to
the btiiliancy of the display.
A 1 these arrangements have now to be
put aside, for we are not to hold a carni
val. The memory of them will neverthe
less remain with us, and what was done
will be accounted as a sufficient proof that
Southern California has tha true Califor
nian spirit and is prompt and willing to
assist other sections of the State in all that
tends to advance the welfare or the fame
of the commonwealth.
Since Los Angeles and Southern Califor
nia are not to have the pleasure of State
patriotism at a carnival in San Francisco,
tbe only way to atone for the loss is for
the people of San Francisco and Northern
California to give all the aid they can to
the Los Angeles carnival. That which
they designed to do for us we should do
for them. The Los Angeles fiesta is to
take place without fail. Let us see to it
that we show during the festival how fully
we appreciate the kind intentions which
the people of the south had toward ub
while our carnival was under considera
tion.
Under an act of Legislature which the
Governor has approved State prison War
dens must hereafter furnish each Sheriff
in the State a photograph of every pris
oner when he is discharged. The expense
to which the State would have been put
in the event of providing every prisoner
also with a ball and chain, a striped earb
and a keeper to guard him through the
rest of his days was the consideration
which probably prevented the eood legis
lators from adding to his identity those
further advertisements of his disgrace.

BURIED IN VERSES.
Fate of the High-Hat Bill in the Wiscon-
SIN f-ENATE.
Assemblyman Risum's bill to prohibit the
wearing of hat* by women In theaters, which
passed the Assembly a week ago, was killed in
the Senate to-day, says a Madison (Wis.) dis
patch to the Chicago Tribune.
Senator Putnam, the chairman of the Com
mittee on State Affairs, which had the bill un
der consideration, reported for its indefinite
postponement. The report was made in verse,
and is as follows :
We think it a pity,
'lhat we. your committee,
And one or importance at that,
Are asked ul.liou. reas jn
By this Mr. Hlsum, '
To consider his "Tale of a Hat."
We're expected to wrangle
And g-t in a tangle.
When woman we vow is so nice,
That we will s;a d b â¢ h'.r.
Though Â»he builds her ha. higher; â 
Alt we ask to t>t> low is the price.
High bats we're not defending,
But the show* we've been Attending
Were those with oa let feats.
T c hats were th*n behind us.
For the o.ily place you'd find as
Was down la the front row of seats.
Our women are so winsome-
Very few are not handsome â
And in oft remarked that
In fair or fuul weather
When at theaters they gather,
It's only the homely wear a hat
60 this is our verdict:
We oe ieve woman perfect,
And she Is In our hearts enthroned;
She needs no legislation,
A 11.1 ii's our recommendation
That the Hat bill be forever postponed.

MINISTERS
AT FEASTS
Rev. E. G. Mathena Says
Banquets Are Too
Expensive.
PLAIN REMARKS AT THE
PRESBYTERY.
The Speaker Says There Should
Be No Waste While the
Poor Suffer.
CHURCH BUSINESS TRANSACTED
YISTERDAY.
The Board of Missions Grants Aid
to S-veral Struggling
ChurchÂ°s
Considerable interest attached to the
session of the Presbytery of San Francisco
at the First Presbyterian Church yester
day morning and afternoon. Thoueh no
great matters were finally disposed of,
E. R JENKS, the Presbyterian Moderator.
several important topics were discussed
and acted upon. The session finally ad
journed until Monday, the 2Gth, at the
Mission Home on Sacramento street.
E. H. Jenks was cliosen moderator yes
terday, though F. A. Doane a^ted for most
of the afternoon, the moderator serving
with the Home Mission Committee.
Mucb of tbe business of the day was te
diously routine in character, being a hum
drum recital of petty grievances, reports
ol committees and work of like character;
but Rev. G. E. Mathena, known ns "the
friend of tLe poor of the Potrero," broke
away from conventionalism when the
Question of Â» prand banquet at the Occi
ental Hotel was sprung.
The matter under discussion was ways
and means of making a successful ban
quet on April 29 in honor of the uradu
ation of students at the Presbyterian
Th-ological fc-eminary at $1 50 per piate.
Invitations had been sent to all minis
tors, and ail were asked to stale whether
they would attend. Rev. Mr. Reynolds
had urged those present to do all in their
Dower to make the banquet a success, and
the moderator was awaiting response?.
It wa-s at this juncture that Rev. E. G.
Mathena arose and made v speech that
sounded like the simple doctrines of
Ciirist as taught by Toltioi in his novels.
Rev. H. N. Bevier criticized him severely
for "breaking the sweet Harmony of the
meeting by speaking of unpleasant
things," bui Mr. Mathena did not modify
bis position.
"We are asked to go to this banquet at
the Occidental Hotel," he said, modestly,
'but it costs |3 if we take our wives. I
confess that such a use of money *ecms to
me wrong, vitally wrong, in these times
of want and suffering among our fellow
creatures. It is embarrassing for me to
thus decline the invitation or to appear to
be out of joint with the times; but my
work lies among the very poor, among
those to whom a o'ollnr is of great import
ance. It is a matter of conscience with
me and I cannot consent to spend $3 in
thi3 way when the poor are coming to my
door for food; when little children are
hungry and ill clad, and when honest men
are out of employment, their families in
want.
"With the small sum of $3 I conld do
great good in the way of charity or I
misht get ten children into my Sunday
school. Ido not think it is proper for
ministers of the gospel to set such an ex
ample as this would be. Mv conscience,
therefore, compels me to decline tbe invi
tation, although friends have offered 10
pay for tbe plates for my wife and my
self."
Her. H. N. Bevier arose at once and
criticized the speaker for introducing a
discordant note.
"I think such talk man the sweet
unanimity of this beautiful meeting." He
â¢aid, "and I believe the banquet will be a
beneht to the seminary; therefore it ought
to be encouraged."
Rev. Mr. Woodworth, in reply, said:
1 This gaudy dinner will in no way aii
the seminary. The banquet is for the
select and fortunate and not for the riff
raff like Brother Mathena and others who
cannot afford to attend. Of course, the
newspapers will boom it and put forth the
brilliant things said, but the report will
not be made in a quiet way."
| iThe matter was not discussed further,
and the presbytery devoted its attention
to other themes.
The application of Thomas K. Dryden
to be allowed to preach was refused alter
an examination by the presbytery.
It was decided "to adjouru the presby
tery until 2:30 p. m. April 26 at the Mis
sion Home on Sacramento street Sev
eral important questions went over with
the adjournment, among them thÂ« ques
tion whether delinquent churches be re
fused aid by the board of home missions.
Rev. H. C. Minton was elected a dele
gate to the General Assembly at Winona,
Ind., which convenes on May 20 Rev.
I. M. Condit and Dr. E. B. Stewart were
elected alternates, also Rev. F. R. Far
rand, J. p. Printzman, M. T. Romaine,
Captain George Jotmsou and G. D. Fahne
stociE.
It \ras decided that a Sunday-school
committee and a committee of the pres
bytery confer as to a proper concert of
action between them on various matters
at issue, there being, it was said, a lack of
unanimity.
After the committee on home missions
had conferred for several hours their re
pprt was discussed by the presbytery, and
the sum of $400 was voted to the Frank
lin-street Church and a like sum to the
Holly .Far* Church.
It was decided to asress every church in
the presbytery to make up the deficiency
existing in the French and Italian mis
sions.
Rev. Mr. Bevierand Eider A. B. Cheney
were appointed a committee to investigate
the question of disposing of $5000 left to
the Howard Sunday-school in the settle
ment of the Howard-street Church affair?.
The mission proper went to the Calvary
Church, which does not ask for the $.5000,
and the question is what to do with the
money.

You think it is because
your child is " growing too
fast " that he fails to put on
flesh. More often it is
due to a gradual and general
weakening of all the forces
of the body. The child
may have no pain, may have
a fair appetite and yet lose
flesh. Perhaps the happiest
effects of Scott's Emulsion
are in such cases as these.
It gives the body a fat which
is easily taken up; alters
unhealthy action and sup-
plies the best blood-making
food known to medical
science.

Resolutions Adopted Expressing the

Hospital, on two counts, and the District
Attorney was requested to prepare the
documents. The indictment will prob
ably be presented to the court next Fri
day unle:-s the greatest pressure is brought
to bear to obtain a reconsideration of the
vote and a reopening of the case.
One of the witnesses heard yesterday

The committee on corporations (H. \V.
Hannemann, chairman), presented tlie
lollowing report, which was adopted:
Ban Francisco, April 9, 1897.
To the Honorable Grand Jury of the City and
County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen: Your
committee, 10 whom was referred the matter of
water rates, beg leave to report:
The president of the Spring Valley Water
Company, upon wnom we called for informa
tion which would enable us to make an in
telligent report based upon facts, received us
courteously, and, upon stating the object of
our visit, he declined to furnish such detailed
statements of the business of the water com
pany in the matter of expenditures and re
ceipts as we needed in order to form an opin
ion as to whether the existing water rates can
be reduced and be just to the company.
The president claimed it as the right of the
company, as a corporarion responbible to its
owners and stockholders, to refuse to mako
public its bufiness interests.
The manor of rates is now being investigated
by the Board of Supervisors, who are searching
for sucn facts as will enable them to fix a just
rate for the company and the ratepayer-, in
which there is always more or less conflict of
opinion.
The Spring Valley Water Company demand
an income from the City sufficient to cover
operating expenses, which they report as
amounting to $394,012 08 for the year 1896;
interest upon bonded indebtedness of $9,075,
--000, ana a dividend rate of (i per cent on Its
entire capital stock.
We have no report from the company of the
amount of revenue received from the City for
water during lbOii, but the fact that such in
lormation is it:ihei<i is significant.
The water-meter charges in San Francisco,
with a population of 350.090, ranges from 22
cents to 40 cents per thousand gallons; the
present daily consumption is reported by the
company as 21,000,000 gallons. The annual
operating expenses are about Â¥394,000.
In New York, population 1,800,000, the rate
is 12J-Â£ cents, annual operating expenses
$300,000; Buffalo, population 335,000. rate
6 cents, annual operating expenses $220,000:
Baltimore, population 434,000, rate 53i cents,
anuual operating expenses $150,000; Pitis
bure, population 205,000, rate 5 cents, annual
expenses $100,000; Cleveland, population
3t>2,000, rate 5 cents, aniiunl expenses $171,
--000; Chicago, population 1,700 rate 10
cents, annual expenses $285,000.
Of the above-named six large cities New
York pays the largest rate, which is only
abjut one-half the minimum rate in Ban
Francisco. In the other. five cities the rale is
less than one-half of that oi New York. In all
the cities named the water works are ownci
ami operated by the city.
Mayor Strong of New York City, In his late
message, referring to the Department of Pub
lic Works, makes the following report from
the Bureau of the Water Register :
â¢'For the first time in the history of the- city
the revenue collected last year from water
rents was more than enough to reimburse the
city for the entire outlay of the Department of
Public Works, which is taken from taxation.
To express it in another way, our water rents
paid lor road pavements, street lighting, care
of and repairs to the entire water system, care
of and repairs to public buildings, salaries,
wages and all other administrative expenses."
The editor of Outlook, New York, comment-
Ing on the above report, says: "These aston
ishing financial results were achieved in spite
of water rents lower than those of neighboring
towns supplied by private companies. Indeed,
it had seemed to us probable that part of the
expenses of the \Vnter Department whs borne
by general taxation. Instead, however, of the
taxpayers being burdened to make water
cheap in the homes and business establish
ments, the latter are paying not only for the
water they use, but also for that used by the
public in the streets, the parks rind the public
buildings, and finally, for all the expenses of
street lighting Â«md paving and the care of and
repairs to all public buildings. The profit to
the taxpayers from the public ownership of
the water works is almost without parallel.
The Mayor may well speak of the manage
ment of the Department of Public Works as
'clean, honest and Intelligent.' "
The report of the Water Department of Chi
cago for 1896 shows that the taxpayers of that
city are profiting almost as largely. as those of
New York from their ownership of the water
works. la brief the report reads as follows :
Receipts..... '. ...$3,228,000
Operating expenses -K;> v
Net earnings $2,94 1,000
The Investment in Chicago water works, ac
cording to the New York San, is $28,000,000.
When interest on bonds to this amount is de
ducted irom the net earnings the remaining
profits are over $1,500,000, or If 5 a year for ev
ery family in the city. Tee public also receives
free the vast quantities of water used in it*
parks, streets and public buildings, to say
nothingol fie incidental advantage of cheaper
fire Insurance than would be possible were
tho water supply in any way inadequdte. The
investment, large as it is, has certainly been a
most profitable one. - \
The above statement of comparative water
rates, obtained from the most reliable sources,
present Â«very strong argument in favor of
ownership by the City of its water wor*s, and
warrants your committee in the belief that
the existing rates arc excessive and should be
reduced, and we most respectfully submit the
same for consideration by your honorable
body, with the recommendation that such re
duction in rates may be made for the relief of
the City and its ratepayers as may seem just
and wise. .Respectfully submitted,
H. W. Hanxexann,
A. S. IICKKARD,
A. E. Buckingham.
Resolutions expressing the Grand Jury's
appreciation of the services rendered by
Patrick Crowley, Chief of Police, retired,

DELMAS WINS A
VITAL POINT
At Last the Craven Suits
Will Come to
Trial.
No Special Panel for the Battle
Over the Fair Estate
Millions.
All of the Rial Estate, Except That
Claimed by Mrs. Craven, Ordered
Distributed.
Monday morning will see the opening
of the trial of the suit of the Fair c-3tate
agaitist Mrs. Craven. After weeks of en
deavor D. M. Delmas has at last won his
point and secured the trial of the case be
fore a jury.
A. month ago Mr. Delmas offered to
make almost any concession to the other
side provided no opposition to an inime
diate trial was interposed, but delay was
what the other side wanted, and another
month was added to the dreary wait.
Now the trial is imminent, and, instead
of securing the concessions Mr. Delmas
offered for a speedy trial, the attorneys for
the estate will have to come into court
anyway with no other satisfaction tnan
that of having compelled every one to be
idle for at least four weeks longer than
was necessary.
On Monday Judge Slack declared that
he desired the assistance of a jury in pass
ing on the issues of fact.
When that was made known Attorney
Pierson suggested that he thought what is
known as a "s;ruck" jury would be the
proper tribunal to consider this weighty
matter. He explained that in another
lorum the Judge chose forty-eight names
of prominent business men, who were
known to have good judgment, and names
were stricken from the list, first by one
side and then by the other, until only
three names remained. He thought a
similar course would yield satisfactory re
sults in this caae.
To this D. M. Delmas, representing
Mrs. Craven, made objection, saying that
he did not wish any jury of millionaires.
He read an article from the American
Law Journal, which expressed condemna
tion of a certain law in Missouri which
allows a rich man to put up $75 a week in
advance and secure the irapanelraent of
wnat is called a "business man's jury," to
be composed of "downtown merchants
and their clerks and bookkeepers. "
Jud^e Slack acceiteil the views of Mr.
Delmas in this respect, and yesterday
inornine, in making the order for a jury,
said: "The panel now in attendance in
this court will be excused from further at
tendance, and the cferk is directed to isauo
certificates of service to theni. A new
panel of 150 names will be drawn at. once,
and I direct the drawing to be made at
noon to - morrow. The names must be
drawn from the box ol jurors designated
by a\'. the Judges of the Superior Court, as
required by law. It' a proper jury should not
be secured in this way the blnme falls on
the law, not on this court. I know of no
reason why an appropriate jury may not
be obtained in this way.
It was ordered that tho panel should be
made returnable on Friday morning and
that the trial of the case shorn l begin at
11 o'clock next Monday morning, the 19ih
inst.
The motion to dismiss the jurors already
on the panel was made on the ground
that Mr. Delcuas' remarks a month uo
were of such a character as to warp the
minds of the men impaneled. On that
occasion Mr. Delrnas made a strong plea
for a trial, and then it was he ottered to
concede his rights as to argument, to
procedure, to almost anything, if the
other side would only quit skirmishing and
comedown to btninebs. His desire for a
trial was as evident as the reluctance of
his opponents, and as the panel of jury
men flat and listened to it all the attorneys
for the estate feared the situation might
work to their disadvantage, and so they
a-kei that the jurors be dismissed. It
was notcomplitnentary to the intelligence
of the jurors concerned, but they could
say nothing, and can only console them
selves by realizing what they have escaped.
Attorney firiltain, representing the of
fice of Delmas & Shortridge, stated to the
court that the application to take the
deposition of Attorney Charles S. Wheeler
would ba temporarily withdrawn, with
out prejudice to the right to renew the
application t take Mr. Wheeler's depo
sition before the court or a notary public.
This was allowed.
The distribution of real estate to the
heirs of James G. Fair was then proceeded
with. All the real estate, with the excep
tion of the two parcels uf land claimed
by Mrs. Craven, was ordered distributed
direcily to Mr*. Oelricns, Charles L. Fair
and Virginia Fair. This is follow. ng oat
the principle laid down in Judge Slack's
opinion heretofore rendered, in which the
f>retended trust attempted to be estab
ished in the will of James O. Fair was
declared invalid.

A Company of Miners and Traders
Is About to Purchase the
Schooner Winchester.
Negctiations for the purchase of the
smart schooner Winchester by the body of
men who are to make a prospecting ana
trading cruise to Alaska have almost been
completed. It is the intention to make
the party not less than thirty nor more
than fifty, and of this number twenty-live
have already signed the articles oi agree
ment. Each member is to put up $200,
and the cruise is to last six months. Pro
visions to last nine months will be tafcen,
and a large quantity of trade will also be
stowed in the hold. The latter will con
sist mainly of trinkets, bright dress goods,
Hour, sugar and arms and ammunition.
To show wi>at confidence is felt in the
venturety business men, J. F. Cunning
ham, managing owner of the Winchester,
has taken several shares and will send out
at least two men to go prospectine on his
account. Messrs. McNevin and Newman,
who are handling the venture, and a dele
gation cf prospectors went over to Oak
land Creek to look at the Winchester yes
terday, and they were so pleased with the
handsome craft that the chances are the
purchase will be completed to-day.
In some quarters there are grave fears
for the American suiD Samaria, now out
twenty-livÂ«t days from Seattle, while in
others every confidence is expressed that
sne will finally rrach por;. Oiie man hold
ing to the latter belief is Captain McLeod
of the Rufus E. Wood, which made the
trip from Nanaimo, 15. C, in eleven days.
Yesterday Captain McLeod was discuss
ing the matter with Donald Ross and
others and gave his reason for his belief
as tallows:
"Exactly twelve days ago this morn
ing," said he, "I was 180 miles off the
mouth of the Columbia River." [The
Knfus E. Wood reached this port on the
10th in-t.j "Hull down, behind us 1 could
see a tship without a stitch of canvas on
her main, and only the light sails on her
fore and mizzen. She was heading for the
river, and I came to the conclusion that
the mainmast was sprune and that the
captain was afraid of carrying sail even in
the light breeze for fear of doing more
damage. Late in '.he afternoon the shirt
put about.and took up the same course I
was steering. The Wood had every stitch
of canvas set, and it was not long before
the other vessel wai out of sight. From
that time to port we had iigbi winds and
calms, and the same kind of weather nas
prevailed ever since. While lam not sure
that it was the Samaria I sighted, still I
have no hesitation in saying that 1 think
she will reach port in a disabled condi
tion."
John A. Dunleuvy, son of Police Cap

WAS STRUCK BY
A STREETCAR
It Seemed to Go Like a
Bullet Out of a
Gun.
Edward L. Levey, an Old Ex
pressman, Knocked From
His Wagon.
No Bell Was Rung, He Declare?, and
No Warning of the Impending
Danger Was G.ven
The damage case of Edward L. Levey
against the MarKet-street Railway Com
pany was on trial in Judge Banrs' court
yesterday.
Mr. Levey is an expressman by occupa
tion. He complains that on the 24th of
last December a car belonging to the de
fendant company crashed into his wagon
while he was trying to cross Mission street,
near Erie, not far from the old Woodward
Gardens property. Because of the col
lision he received severe injuries, and con
sequently demands $50,000 damages.
Samuel M. Shortridge, attorney for the
p". in [l tiff, made a brief statement to the
jury in regard to the facts involved in the
case. He said that Mr. Levey was in the
ordinary discharge of his duties and that
he expected to prove the collision com
plained of resulted from the carelessness
of the employes of the railway company;
that while Mr. Levey was driving in a
proper way the car dashed on him, threw
him from his wagon and permanently in*
jured him ; that the car was coiac at a
higher rate of speed tuan i* allowed by
law; that no bell was rung and no warn
ing was given in order that the plaintiff
might have protected himself.
The injuries are so serious that he will
not be aole lo properly attend to his busi
ness again.
Mr. Levey gave a graphic account of the
accident, lie said he was driving along,
and, before turning his team, looked both
ways to sec if any car was coming. He
saw no car and straightened bis horses out
to get across the track, when he heard
some shouts by people on the street, and
the next instant he was flying through
the air. He was knocked so far that he
was unconscious when he fell. There was
a curve in the tracff, and the car turning
round it came toward him like a bullet
out of a gun. That was the only way in
which he could explain the fact that he
couM not see the car just before it struck
him.
Some question was made by Attorney
Charles L. Ackerman on behalf of the
railway company in regard to the ability
of the plaintiff to see what was gome on
around him, considering tne fact tnat Mr.
Levev's wagon had a cover on it. In re
ply Mr. Levey explained that the oilcloth
flaps of the cover were rolled up and tied
on both aides to the stanchions; that they
did not interfere with his view in driving.
Mr. Ackerman insisted that with th.
side covers In that condition the plaintiff
could not see the tiack twenty feet back
ot him.
The reply of Mr. Levev caused a smile
to flit across the countenances of the jurors,
for he simply said, "I was not looking for
the track, I was looking for the car."
Still Mr. Ackerman was not satisfied.
He thought tnat the plaintiff could see the
sew to-dat;
If you |
were a city grocer, fond of
yourself and family, and not
particularly fond of your

witness replied that as a practical man he
thoueht he could sec a car more than twice
as far as he could distinguish the position
of the track.
Dr. Frederick W. Harris testified to the
painful character of the injuries. The in
dications were that the brain and the spinal
cord had been injured. He could not de
tect any permanent injury at tne present
time, but the patient is constantly com
piaining of his sufferings.
J. Booker, a glasaworker, testified that
he saw the accident. He was on the car
that struck the old man's wagon. He
thought the collision occurred some dis
tance from the spot described by the
plaintiff, and it became necessaryto go
with the jurors, lawyer?, witness and all
to the scene of the catastrophe, court still
being in session.
In his testimony Mr. Booker said the
car which struck Mr. Levey's wa>;on was
going at a high rate of speed and he heard
no bells ringing, nor did he note any
other warning?.
While Dr. Harris was examining Mr.
Levey in court the fact was developed
that ho had lost the grip of bis right hand
and could not lift any woiehr. with it.

employe of the Stanford estate, says:
"I applied a' the State Klectro-Medical Institute
Jatiumy "23. 1897, beln: for six years a sufferer

Alouzo .Morrow, 905 Fnlmore street, city, says:
'â¢I h.Â»v<Â« just been cured of eczema by the Klectro-
Medical Cure, which recently created such a
furor of excitement In the scientific world. For

many remedies and doctors, 1 was astonished at
the rapid relief 1 received nt the State Klectro-

and electricity have not only effected a complete
cure of my ailment, but have made a number of
cures in other diseases that 1 know of >rhlcU are
truly wonderful. '
William Fitzgerald, 961 Mission street, city,
says:
"The doctors of the State Electro- Medical Insti-

years of almost constant pain makes me appreci-
I ate the marvelous cure effected. I really thinic that

the world that will cure a bail case ot rbeumatitm.
1 had tried electricity alone and medicines alone,
but '.he combined and well-defined treatment of
medic. ne and electricity of this Institute has
proved my greatest blessing. 1 never before took
any medicines just like them. They have changed
my condition from one of misery to happiness.
There is nothing like their electrical appliance
elsewhere on the Pacific Coast. You may depend
on what the doctors say. They will not tell you
they can cure you unless they can."
Charles schill. 202 Kighth street, city, says:
"For years 1 have been afflicted with nervous de-
bility, heart, stomach and nervous trcucles,'
which preatly hindered .me iv my work, I suf-

the fetate KU-ctro-Medical Institute. I lm-
nits] lately began to Improve and can now say 1
am a well man again. My whole life is changed
from one of gloom to gladness."
Nothinj: Else Like It.
Under no circumstances should the Electro-
Medical Cure bo confounded with the ordinary-
electric treatment as applied by common bat-
teries or with such crude magnetic appliances
as electric belts and the like. The Electro-
Medical Cure is different in fundamental
principle, different in application ami differ-
entin effect. It is a. well-defined new system
of combining medicine with electricity, which
is adapted to the old and the young, the nerv-
ous, bilious, lymphntic; in fact, to each and
every condition of the human system.
Home Treatment.
If you live out of town and cannot visit the
Institute this need not deprive you of the
benefits o; this wonderful treatment. It is
only necessary to write a plain statement of
your condition, explaining your foeliners and
symptoms as clearly as possible. and from it
the Institute Doctors will be able to accurately
diagnose your case. It only costs you the
trouble of writing and two cents in postage to

The disease known as Taricocele has baffled the medical profession at every tnm.
The various attempts to remove it have ail proven ineffective, and some of them even
more injurious than the disease itself. The knife, vacuum, compression and manage
have all been tried and all failed, and yet Varicocele and its large following of wasting
weaknesses can be cured. Varicocele is a congestion of the stagnant blood in the
Terns, with considerable distention of the glands. Electricity will decompose this
congested state and drive the stagnant blood into the circulation, relieving the vein*
â¢i the weakening strain, at the same time contracting the glands which have grown
weak from the disease, thus curing the whole trouble. ~
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT,
Recognized by the medical profession as the most scientific method for the application
Of the electric current to the body, and backed by many thousanJs of cures of various
nervous and chronic cases, is now acknowledged the best means of reaching the dread
â Mtina- disease . * ""
VARICOCELE.
Its power over this disease is remarKable. Cures have been completed in one
â month, and the worst cases can be reached in three months by this belt. As an evi-
dence of recent results the following will be interesting:
"I would like to add my testimony to numerous others in possession of Dr.
Banden's Electric Belt Co. I purchased a belt from Dr. Sanden about tHe first of
April, which I used according to directions, and after three months* trial I am happy
*o state that my varicocele. which was of twelve years' standing, is almost entirely
disappeared, my testicles being almost normal. I take great pleasure in recommend-
ing this Belt to any one suffering from like trouble. Respectfully yours,
"W. E. JOHNS, 1139 Market street, San Francisco, Cal.
"On receipt of your Belt I was requested to report in thirty days and I therefore
let you know how lam getting along. I must say that the results are away beyond
any expectations, and I now. believe in theVonderful power of the Belt. I notice an
Improvement all over my body and especially the varicocele, which before I wore the
Belt were large swollen veins, have almost entirely and completely disappeared, and
the seminal weakness which I have suffered from for a long time has entirely disap-
peared. lam now as strong in this particular as I wish to be. I wish you to publish
this letter that other sufferers my profit by my experience."

Think of the happiness, the deep, heart-whole con-
tent that settles upon your mind when you say to your-
â¢elf, "I am strong and manly ; I have preserved the gift
of manhood that nature gave me." Yes,, you who can
say that, and say it honestly, think of how much you owe
to nature, the giver of manhood. Yet not many can say
it. There are too many pitfalls, too many temptations in
the path of young men, and too many of them fa 11 ..;
It is to correct the error of youthful folly, and to
point out the happy recovery of manly vigor by his won-
derful Electric Belt, that Dr. Sanden has given; to the
world his famous book, "Three Classes of Men." He
will send a pocket edition, free, sealed, to any sufferer, or
to any man who does not feel himself a man. Get it. Dr.

men i addressed to him and written by tlie
prisoner in the Alameda County Jail.
The statement elves a sketch of the life
of Karns ;is a Union soldier. He enlisted
in July, 1861, in Company A. Thirty-eighth
Ohio Volunteer Infantry, ior theierm of
three yea;>, or during the war. In the
latter part of 1861 hi* comp::nv was with
the command of General George H.
lliomas at Lebanon, Ky.. where he acted
as Provost Marshal, On that orca^ion he
was ordered to report to General Thoma\
who instructed him to deliver a dispatch
to Brigadier-General Seff, then at Sum
merat, eighty miles away. He -ucceeded
in delivering Die dispatcb, although fired
upon several times by ttie enemy.
At the battle of Mills Springs he had
the honor oi recevini: and transmitting
the iirst order o; General Tbomai on tiie
battle-field. He was not more than thirty
feet, from the Confederate general Zolli
coffer when the latter fell from his horse
latally wounded.
Karns was afterward selected as one of
the scouts for General Rosetrans. He
remained with his regiment until after
the fall of Corinth. He nelpcd to storrr
Missionary Ridge. He was la seventy
two engagements duii:;jr the war and was
wounded in the leg with a bullet at the
battle of Cbickamauga.
It would not have been proper to have
allowed the statement to be read in court
after the prisoner had been convicted,
and it bad no bearing on his case. This
was rrobabiy why Judge Morrow would
not allow it to be read.
K:Â»rns will be taken to San Qnentin on
Saturday. His attorney will appeal the
case.

Petitionâ No Secretary Has Yit
Been Selected
The regents of the Slate University met
yesterday at the Hopkins Institute of Art.
Governor Budd occupied tlie chair.
Previous to the call to order a commit
tee from the Merchants' Association, con
sisting of Irving M. Hcott, A. S. Baldwin,
F. W. Dohrmann, E. B. Pond and Secre
tary Freud, met in conference with a com
mittee from tiie reeents and d:Â«ousÂ«Â»ed the
proposition of a site for tne Wilmerdin^
School. Information was giypn the board
that a site would be presented free of
charge, though iis precise location was
not designated.
In the judgment of the Morchants' As
sociation any of these sites mentioned as
available would answer every require
ment Mr. Scott presented Mrs. Stan
ford's recent communication to the trus
tees of. Stanford University, in which she
spoke in favor of locating the school in
this City, and himself voiced the opin
ion that San Francisco is the place for the
school.
No action in the matter was taken at
the time, but later on it was brought up
again by Regent Puelp*. aad after some
discussion, in which Recent John E.
Budd evidenced antipathy to its being
taken as a ioregone conclusion that the
plum will fall into the local basket, the
matter wai referred to a committee, com
} O!<ed of Re tre nts Arrbur Roiigers, C A.
S>lÂ«ck and F. G. Ptielns, to meet with a
comin ttee irorn ihe Merchants' Associa
tion and look over the round!) that bo'iy
had ii view. Before this committee can
take any action it must report bacK to the
board.
The resignation of Professor Neif of the
veterinary department was received and
aeoe.pteU.
A letter from Professor Hilgard was
read, in which he caiied attention to the
pressing necessity of tÂ» feint: some action
in the matier of university printing. The
institution 1 greatly perturbed over the
matter, owinu to tlie Governor's veto of
the Stale printing appropriation.
Regent Rodders thought the matter
shou.d be refers d to a special committee
with instructions to make a thorough ex
amination and report thereon. Governor
Budd here embrac-d the chance to give
the board â  verbal castigation. He said
that the printim: investigation showed
beyond all doubt that ihe university
printing in the pan has been marked by
unexampled extravagance.
Governor Budd himself and Regents
Crocker and Rodgers were appointed a
committee to inquire into the matter, but
it was decided, nevertheless, to have 6000
cojiies of the university register printed
at Sac r amento.
Professor Langley sent in his applica
tion for a four days' leave of absence with
'tut lost of pay, and the same drew down
the vigorous censure of Regent Foote.
In fact, before he finished ilie gentleman
almost belligerent.
"Thi3 board has absolutely no right
under ;he rules to grant such a request,
i am opposed to it tirst, last and all the
t me. It is contrary to the low on the
subject."
The maiter was referred to the law com
mittee without further discussion, but
was important on account of t. c fact that
a similar instance rose later on, in which
Regent Koote was antagonized to the ex
tent of a triumph on the part of his op
ponents.
The proposition to alliliate the Hahne
raann College with the university Drought
;orth another strong protest from Regent
Waimce. Leading medical men, he be
j icved, were opposed to the nlea. Any
way, they had asserted, so he said, that a
college of this description had never yet
! t>een affiliated with a leading university,
| except at AniuArbor, Mich., and that was
done by trickery.
Regent Chester Rowell, who is an allo
path,c pbysiciAA, si>oke against tne pro
posed affiliation as oeing unwise and not
po!i;ic. He contended that homeopalns
had nothing new to offsr in the way of af
filiation, and that the fairest thing was to
grant them a chair of theory and practice
in the niea.cai department of the uni
versity.
Regent C. F. Crocker, who with Regents
A. y. Haliidie and William T. Watts,
brought in the report, rose in its defense.
Mr. \Yntts, he stated had voted adversely,
but Mr. Haliidle himself bad voted in
htvor oi it because no one had appeared
be ore them ami presented any reason why
they shouid not aili.iate. T..e matter waa
compromised uv nt*kinj it a subject for
especial consideration at the August
meeting.
Then the proponents and opponents of
the question could appear and settle the
thing. Regent John E. BuoVl naively
inquired whether the Augu-u meetiue
should be "ieid here or. in Carson City ,
thereby serio lslv interfering with the
soiemn conclave of the board for some
time.
it was decided that in future the deposit
of $10 inquired of students to pay the
expenses of their diplomas should be
reduced to $5. Regent J. B. Reinstein
stated that only about $2 50 was required
for that purpose, whereupon Regent Foote
wanted the balance refunded to the
students. His desire Jailed to prevail, but
an appropriation of $250 was made to
relieve the expenses ot the graduating
class, instead.
Ttie co-mmitten on the estate of Harold
Whiting, in Massachusetts, which wa<
left as a legacy to ti;e university, reported
that it could be secured by the payment of
a collateral inheritance tax of $1000 The
estate n mounts to $20,000.
Tne regents further signified their de
sire to have a chair of the Scandinavian
languages endowed ut Hie earliest possible
moment.
By a vote of 16 to 3 it was decided to
sen i Professor Lawsoo as a repre.-enttitive
ol the university to the International theo
logical Convention to be held at Si. Pe
tersburg. The technicality of allowing
Mm no salary but expenses amounting
lo hi-, salary in his absence was resorted
to in order 10 avoid the legal provision on
til 4 subject.
Recent Foote asain matie vigorous ob
jections to sucli a proceedini!, uut to his
evident chagrin was overruled.
Processor True of the department of
phy-ica endeavored to obtain a year's
leave of ausence to pursue a course at Chi
cago, Out it was deemed inadvisable to
him leuve of absence at this time.
After earnest discussion it was voted
that an appropriation not to exceed
?0'2,000 he made to Cover the expense of
â¢â oiibiructing a two-story frume ouildme
between the library and chemistry build
ing at ihe university. This bunding hat
become an absolute necessity as a tem
porary expedient to relieve ihe over
crowded condition now prevailing. Regent
Denickeaiso spoke heartily in favor of an
improvement to the gymnasium building.
- Professor Soule was appointed to make
an examination oi tue cement being used
in tvÂ« cuflfciructiua oi the Aililuued Col
lege building?. Regent Denicke had
brought specimens for examination by
the board, and it was cliumtd that the
<e l" enl llsed is of * yer - inferior quality.
v\ lien the question of tne selection of a
su.ces^or to Mr. Bonte in the office of
general secretary of the university was
broucht forward the board went into ex
ecutive session.
It was stated by one of the regents
aiter-ward tu a t there are no le?s than
forty-eight applicants for the posi;ion. It
was found impossible to agree on any one
man, and the selection of a secretary was
postponed for a mouth.
It was decided to send a recommenda
tion to the Secretary o; War to appoint as
instructor in military science at the uni
versity either Lieutenant Sidney A. Clo
mun or Lieutenant \V. H. Bertsch, with
the former as first choice.
An adjournment was finally taken till a
week from next Tuesday, at whicn time
all unfinished business will be settled.
The following petition has been sent to
the Bca-U ot Regents by the president of
Cooper Medical College:
To the Honorable Poarrt of Regent* of the Uni
versity 0/ Californiaâ Gentlemen: Tne under
signed having learned thai it has been decided
to grant the degree of bachelor of science to
students who hiUt three years' study in the
university then pursue the study of medicine
la the medical department of that insiitutlou
respectfully requests that tne same degree be
granted to students of the university who n.ey
pursue the study of medicine in the Cooper
Medical College.
This is asked for on the following grounds:
Cooper Meaical College, as the successor ol the
medical department nf the University of the
Pacific, founded in 1853, 1s the pioneer medi
cal i.istuuiion of the Pacific Coast; it has a
large cUss ol stuitentsi, averaging nnnually
nearly 200. These students, through th-ir
parents and friends, represent a large uumoer
of the taxpayers of the State of California, and
thus, they beiim contributors to the mainten
ance of the university, your petitioner re
quests that they be conceded a iair share in
its honors and privileges.
Cooper Medical Coilejre has ri<sen to its
prasent prosperity whohy through individual
enterpri.-e; its laculty works without salary.
It hÂ«Â« never appealed to the Legislature for
aid, but on the contrary it pays heavy taxes.
hvidence tnat Coop-r Medical College is
maintaining a high standard ot medicul edu
cation is the iact that tne institution is recog
nized by the loading medical authorities of
Europe. In addition to its course of four
years' study, the president of the school has
recently found**! a course of lectures to be
given annually by some one who has attained
a world-wide eminence in medicine. This
course, ia 189U, was delivered by Professor
William Macewen; and this year the lectures
will be given br Christorner Heath, iate
president of the Royal Collt-ge ot Surgeons,
England. These lectures give tne students of
Cooper Medical College an it-structiou winch
otherwise toejr couM only obtnin abroad.
Basing his request on tne above grounds, the
undersigned respectfully solicits your favor
able action. L, v. Lane,
President of Cooper Medical College.

LULU JOBBERU'S DEATH.
Police Investigation Will Be
Made to Discover thÂ§
Cause.
She Arrived Frtm Sydney List Octo
ber With an Infant Chid, Who
Survives Hr.
Dr. Gallagher held an autopsy yester
day on the body of the young English
woman who died at 1914 Lyon street on
the night before and whose case was re
ported to the Coroner by Dr. Shumate as
suspicious. Tne autopsy developed the
fact that death had been caused by blood
poisoning brought about by the act of the
young woman herself or of some person
unknown.
The deceased was known as Mrs. "R.
James Walker." and bad visiting cards
with that name. She was also known as
Mr.-. Yvonne Walker, but from letters lr.
her possession there is no doubt that her
real name was Miss Lulu Jobberns. One
of the cards found among the effects of the
deceased read: "Mrs. R. Walker, Tne
Glen, Willis street, Wellington."
A memorandum- boon in her handwrit
ing contains the toll, wing: "Left Flood
street end in April for RiUice street. Loris
born 231 August, 1896. Left Sydney 28th
September. Arrived in Frisco 22d Octo
ber, is<r>."
The woman arrivpd here on the steamer
Monowai with the child Loris, who is now
being cared for by Mrs. Mornson, at whose
bouse the mother died.
Under date of Sydney, March 14. 1897,
and od the letter- head of Stacker &
Fischer, importer? and warehousemen,
her fa'her wrote i<> her very kindly and
affectiona'.bly. He asks lor the name of
the person who tjave her the money for
her passage on the Moi owai, and for i he
name of the father of Loris, wiih the inti
iuation that it was tite duty of the child's
father to provide for it.
There are also letters from her mother
and her sister Lily. The mother ex
presses the hope that the deseased might
*Â«t married here to some well-to-do man.
The sister, Lily, is evidently a nurse in
some medical institution at Ky -almere.
A letter from the addres>. '300 Daning
street, La! main, March 4, 1897." sipm-d
'â¢Robo," jn from some man connected
with the Municipal Hospital of that place.
The writer seems to iiave been on terms ot
undue intimacy with the deceased, and
portions of his letter are unprintable be
cause of their obscenity. He may be the
"R. Jnmci Walker" whose name was
taken by the deceased*
The matter has bÂ«en placed in the
hands of Chief of Police Lees, and the in
quest will be deferred until the detectives
shall have had an opportunity of further
inquiring into the circumstances sur
rounding the death of the girl.

MEZZARA'S WIDOW
AT DEATH'S DOOR
Was Suddenly Aiflicted
With Paralysis of
the Brain.
The Old Lady Is Now Uncon
scious and Has Lut to
Await the E id.
Ever Since Her Husbands Death She
H s Tiiug-it French for a
LiveiihooJ.
Mme. Amelia Mezzara, the widow of the
artist and sculptor, i'ietro Mezzara, one
of the founders of ttie Art A-sociation of
the School of Design of this City, is now
lying at the point of death in her
home at 1404 California street. About
two weeks ago she was afflicted with pa
ralysis of the brain, and, unconscious of
her condition or surroundings, she is ex
pected to die any hour.
Mme. Mezzara has for many years been
a resident of this City, and -inee tne death
of her nusband has taught French fora
livelihood. She was born in France in
1831, and was there thoroughly educated
in music and languages. She was mar-

of the Brain Two Weeks Ago.
ried to Pietro Mozzara when but 16 year*
of age. A few years later her husband
came to California in search of wealth and
fame.
Mrae. Mezzara was about to leave New
xork for California to join her husband
when the Civil War broke out. Tuere was
a call for three months' troops to put
down tne rebellion, and knowing that she
would be detained that length of time be
fore she could leave for the Pacific Coast,
she enlisted after a short training in a
school for hospital nurses. She was de
tailed for duty in Miss Dixs corps of
nurse*.
boon after, nt her own reaue-t, she was
sent to the front, and was with the
field hospitals in "Fighting Joe" Hoot
er's division. The weary years of conflict
went on, and still Mine. Mozzara re
mained at her post until Richmond came
down. Her next experience was during
the Franco-PruHxnin war.
She left New York carrying with her an
autographic letter and order from General
Hooker received irom him during the
Civil War. This letter testified to her de
votion to the wounded as well as recom
mending her ability as a nurse to Count
de Flariguy, president of the Geneva
Hed Cross Society, tiuo also carried a let
ter from W. T. Sherman to the United
States Afini!-ter at Par:*.
At the cose of her work in France she
was presented w>th a superb gold medal^
by the French republic in recognition of
her noble work in the field. On her return
to California she wus presented with an
other gold medal by the Frencn ladies of
thiÂ« <" ty. On August 1, 1896, a pension
of $12 was allowed her for her acts of
bravery and devotion during the Civil War.
She was a member of the Florence
Nightingale Ambulance and Hospital So
ciety of bcuian and was also at Sebastopol
during the war of 1855. and was subse
quently derorated with the Geneva cro-s.
Pietro Mtzzura died iv Paris on the sth
of September,. ISitn. For many years he
uad a studio in Pioneer Hall on Mont
gomery street. He was recognized as an
artist of more than average merit. ,
Although his worth was admitted he
did not receive material encouragement
enough to make him wish to end his days
here. He waa an intimate friend of F. L.
A. Pioche, the banker, and when the lat
ter committed suicide Mezzara's desire to
return to Europe became too strong to be
re*i ited.
Pioche had not forgotten him in his
wiH, but without awaiting the results of
the litigation over the estate he sold his
claim and went to France.
Among the works which he left behind
may be mentioned the statue of Chanty
on the Masonic building; the groups of
Romulus and Remus, which ornament
the facade of tne Mechanics' Pavilion;
the status of Lincoln at the Lincoln
Grammar School and the statuary at the
State Capitol at Sacramento. Mezzarais
supposed to have been about 60 years of
age at the tiiu* of his death.
Mezzara's death caused much regret
among bis friends in ihia City, as will the
death of his wife, which the physicians
say is inevitable.

"Jockey Bill" Martin is the one bright
radiating star in the racing horizon at
Emeryville just now. Willie, as he is af
fectionately termed by hi? Eastern friends,
has spent several summers and two or
three pleasant winters in the saddle.
When it comes to a question of jockey
shipâthat is, a twist or an inshoot, which
Willie dots not know â the author must
have kept his name in the background or
else Willie would have been a willing
subscriber to the work.
Six events were decided at the track
across the bay yesterday, and "Jocfcey
rsili" found it to be his supreme pleasure
to annex three of these, all bein;Â» pro
nounced choices in the betting at that.
And these three favorites landed by
Martin were all that did win, the others
going down to defeat.
Another rider that was very much in
evidence was Bozeman. The "bush"
jockey was first past the wire ou I'ersonne.
a 20 to 1 shot, a good second on the two
year-old Fodic, against which 100 to 1 was
laid, and a close second with old Morte
Fonse at ripe, rcellowy odds.
The sport, as a whole, was not above
mediocrity, and betting was inclined to
be sluggish. .Billy McHrane'fl mare
Amelia J-'onse was the most pronounced
sort of a favorite for the first event de
cided, a cheap six-furlone selling affair,
with a ueid of thirteen going to the post.
Away well next the rail, Thompson took
the 40 to 1 outsider Ezekiel out in front,
and the despised one led until within a
few yards of the wire, where Personne, a
20 to 1 shot, got up and won by a head.
Tbe 7 to 10 choice was a good third.
Finally drawing a koo< j . position at the
post and ruling a 11 to JO choice in tae
betting, the fast Torsida led her held past
the wire in the two-year-old event. In a
drive Fodic, a 100 to 1 shot, beat Miss
BemsSn half a length for tue place.
The third race of tbe day was a seven
furlong run ani proved a eift for the 9 to
20 favorite, Russella, ridden by Willie
Martin. Keeping nis mount back in tne
rear until nearing the stretch Martin
slipped through on tha rail with the favor
ite and won galloping from Alma. The
Baldwin entry, Altivo, was third.
The mile and a quarter run resulted in
a hot drive between the 4 to 5 lavorite,
Oakland, and the third choice, Little Bob.
The field comprised fifteen horses, nearly
all a cheap lot. Hennessy hit the stretch
first with Little Bob and was soon joined
ny tbe favorite. In a punishing drive
Martin got Oakland past the wire winner
by a short bead in 2:101^. Leonville fin
ished a poor third.
'The m!le an-I a sixteentn Belline affair
was another well-contested race. Alva

company to the stretch, where Key del

betting with Sink's horse, assumed the
lead, and, under Clawson's persuasive

GRAND COUNCIL
CHOSEN FRIENDS
It Will Hereafter Econo
mize and Hold Bien
nial Sessions.
A Review of the Past Year's
Work by the Grand Coun
cilor, M. Boebm.
Candidates Who Hive Been P acsd in
Nomicaticn for tLe Offices to Bj
Filled To-Day.
The Grand Council of the Order of
Chosen Friends met yesterday morning in
Prominent Members of the Order of Chosen Friends.
annual session in Memorial Hall, Odd
Fellows' building. There was present a
large number of representatives from the
various councils of the jurisdiction. ?
During the forenoon session the committee
on credentials reported and then the
Grand Council degree was conferred upon
seventy-three representatives entitled to
receive it. . *â¢
The report of Grand Councilor M.
Boehm was read. ' In the beginning this
shows that during the year there were no
appeals from decisions, which speaks well
for the harmony and good feeling existing
among the members of the order.
Of the grand recorder, S. C. Wlalis, the
grÂ«nd councilor says: .v ;
The labor in this' office is continually in
creasing, and only those who are familiar with
the work of iho office oan appreciate the
amount of work pertormed by our worthy
grand recorder, Friend S. C. Wallis. His clear
understanding of all the affairs of the various
council* is supplemented r>y most excellent
judgment, and many an annoyance he averts
with his clear tact and discretion and prompt
and ready decisions, which are called lor con
tinually in the affairs of the councils. - A great
deal of credit Is due his devotion and zeal for
the prosperity of the order in this grand
jurisdiction.
He called attention to the fact tha . an
nual sessions cost $3000 and set forth that
all necessary legislation can be accom
plished at biennial sessions, and in â > the
view of economy recommended that the
next session be held on tne 22d day of
April, 1869. He recommended the presen
tation of a past councilor's badge to each
past grand councilor. He aÂ«kÂ« the mem
bers to advance the order and adds:
Our order may be safely recommended as
superior to all, but our members must be
taught that the welfare ot the order is the
concern of each member; that fraternity is
not an idle term, and that their duty does not
end with the payment of assessments. They
should be required to attend council meetings
regularly, so that they may learn and practice
iv principles, and prosperity will follow there
from.
In conclusion, after paying a compli
ment to the deputies and others for their
aasistance during the year, he says:
The' generous assistance and the uniform
kindness of the members of the order have
been to me a great encouragement In the
prosecution of my work. The burdens of mv
office have been "made lighter thereby, and I
have found friendships that I hope will bÂ« as
lasting as life itself. I nave nothing bat kind
ness lor all the members of our order, and. feel
under tho greatest obligations to them for the
many favors conferred. My -treatment has
been such that I retire from my official posi
tion feeling that I have been fortunate in
deed in being called upon to preside over such
a worthy end magnificent membership as we
have in this State. Our order is composed of
gentlemen and ladies of character, kindly and
sympathetic, ready at all times to lend a.
helping hand wherever needed. You have my
eternal gratitude, and in retiring from my
trust 1 can only hope that my successor In
office shall be as fortunate as myself, and I
know and bespeak for him that he will. I
close with kindest regards and best wishes for
each member. ana tho prosperity and per
petuity of our order. v
The report of the grand recorder, S. C.
Wallis, enters into the statistics of the
order and its progress during tne year.
This shows 137 councils at the end of the
terra with a membership of 6277.
The financial report shows a balance on
hand of $2137 49.
At tne afternoon session a resolution to
instruct the Bupreine Council that will
meet in Louisville, Ky., to favor a propo
sition to enable members over 70 year* of
age wtio have paid in assessments $500 on
each thousand to be exempt from future
assessments was laid on the table.
The committee on the state of the order
presented its report, which, among other
things, indorses the grand councilor's
recommendations for biennial meetings,
and the report was adooteu", so the next
session will not be held until April, 1899.
A resolution to increase the salary of
the grand recorder was laid over until to-
Unv.
It was decided to allow the expenditure

of a sum not to exceed $1030 for premiums
for extension of the order.
The following nominat ons were then

oftio-rs.
The Grand Council will meet again this
morning. ______^________
MARRIOTT WON HIS POINT
Judge Daingerfbld Granted Him
Delay Till Mon
day.
Payment of F:es to Jurors Insisted
Oa by the Court in Order to
Secure a Continuance.
When the casa of Frederick Marriott,
charged with Jibe., was called by Judge
Dain^erflÂ»ld yesterday Attorney Ben C
Darwin arose and asked for a continuance
until next Monday morning. Mr. Darwin
stated ttiat ie had been associated with
S. M. bhortridee in the defense and that
be had not been given a proper oppor
tunity to prepare; that his client had
been abrent from the City for a long time
ana had not communicated with bis at
torneys while away from home; that Mr.
Shortridge, the leading counsel in the
case, was actually engaged in a triai in
another court.
Judge Daingertield showed no sign of
acquiescing with the request, and the de
fendant was called to the witness-stand.
Mr. Marriott was sworn and testified
that he had been absent from the City for
six week?, and wnilo he was away from
home he heard nothing of his case. Be
fore he left, he said, District Attorney
Barnes assured him that the case would
not be pressed until he returned; that
after be got back the case would be called
and set for trial.
District Attorney Barnes was sent for
and was a -kcd about the agreement with
Mr, Marriott. He said he would not dis
pute tliC statement made by Mr. Marriott,
but he did not remember the conversation
referred to. He had several talks with
Mr. Marriott aud knew that he intended
to go Â£aÂ«U So far as he was concerned
there was no objection to continuing the
case for a week.
After more argument and agreement
Judge Daingerlieid said there was an ele
ment in this case that both sides over
looked. He insisted that somebody ought
to pay the jurors' :ees; that the City
oueht not to be put to liiis expense for
nothing.
Attorney Beaty of Mr. Shortridge's
office argued that this was ono of the mis
fortunes of the law ; tbedefendant in a case
of this character could not be as&ed to pay
jurors' fees.
Judge Daingerfielri insisted that the City
treasury must be reimbursed for the ioss
of fees. He said tbat $130 bad gone up in
smoke and nothing had been accom
plished. Besides tne time of the court in
thia department bad been wasted aud
waiting litigants had been discommoded.
Attorney Whalley announced that the
case of Wendt against Winterbaum on
appeal from the Justices' Court was ready
for trial, so the Marriott case was allowed
to go over until next Monday, and Wendt
vs. Winterbaum was taken up. Attorney
Ackerman, representing tne defendant,
said he would rather pay the judgment of
tbe court below than proceed with a jury
trial under the circumstances, and it was
so ordered.
SWIMMING IN OEDBK.
San Francisco Seoka thÂ« Cooling Ware
These Latter Day*.
Now that spring has fully come, all the
glorious possibilities San Francisco offers
to pleasure-seekers in the way of outings
are being eagerly made use of.
The park is fulfilling its purpose in a
way that must delight the management.
Picnics are vow added to the pleasures of
promenading, driving and bicycling, and
the Golden Gate Park divides honors with
the Ocean beach and Sutro Heights as a
favorite resort for those who love to be

All the bathhouses were crowded on
Sunday, as the warm weather made a
plunge In the refreshing water specially

The Butro Baths afforded a sDlen

and graceful swimmers and divers. Over
2000 bathers had been in ihe Sutro Baths

AN INCIDENT AT THE CITY HOSPITAL.
A Woman's Life Barely Saved by a Critical Operation Her Health
Destroyed.
There was a hurry call for the ambulance of the City 'Hospital. In the
course of an hour a very \^\-. sick young woman was brought in on a
stretcher. She was palefejjK as death and evidently suffering keen agony.
There was a hasty exam .C^js^ ination and a consultation. In. less than a

there is no medicine to be compared with the Com-
pound for female diseases. Every woman who suffers from any form of female
weakness should try it at once." Miss Agses Tracy, Box 432, Valley City, N. D.
500 rooms were occupied and some of them
bad four tenants each. Tne â¢ music was
rendered with unusual enthusiasm and
many of the batoers would stop their
spori to listen.
Among the spectators of the sport was
the Australian champion swimmer,
Charles Cavill, who reached this City by
the Mariposa on the Bth.
Cavitl says the amateur divers of this
City excel in grace and daring the youth
of any country he has been in, and he ia
familiar with the sport in Australia,
France and England. Cavill's manager
says some of the boys here of 10 or 12
years old are as fine divers as the experts
of mature age in most places.
Next Sunday Cavill will perform the
dangerous feat of swimming around the
Seal Rocks, and afterward in the Sutro
Baths he will perform the Slonte Cristo
act. Several contests will be arranged for
Cavill and the experts of the coast" while
he is here, and among them will be tbe
crossing of the Golden Gate. This is said
by swimmers to be a iar more difficult
feat than the stemming of the current in
crossing the Hellespont, which was made
famous by Lord Byron's and Leander's
trips.
To Entertain the Boys.
James W. Erwin, United States Postoflice. In
spector, will give a special entertainment for
boys and their friends at the Young Men's
Christian Association Auditorium, Mason and
Kills streets, next Friday evening, when ha
will throw UDon me screen over a hundred
humorous and semi-humorous views. The
boys have styled tho entertainment "An
Eveninc of Laughter." and it will probably be
a very enjoyable affair.

Oakland Officf Fax Francisco Call,)
9 - Broadway, April 13. j
A young bride and groom arrived in
Oakland to-night after a bridal tour that
was modeled aiter the pattern set by
Lochinvar.
Miss Maud Lockwood, now Mrs. Pres
ton, has long been known as the most
MRS. PRESTON (Formerly MAUD LOCKWOOD), the Oakland
Equestrienne, Who Has Just Returned With Her Husband
From a Honeymoon on Fiery Steeds.
fearless equestrienne on the coast. A j
"well-trained hor-e v;as a nuuance to her, \
a frisky animal was fun, but a kicking |
bronco afforded her absolute pleasure.
For more than three years the fame of
Miss Maud Lockwooi has been Known !
all over the State, and especially in this
city, where her parents reside. On the
occasion of the great MnKinley parade
last November Miss Maud, riding a
milk-white horse, Jed one of the divisions,
and was admired by everybody for her
graceful riding and the perfect control she
exercised over the lively animal.
About ten duys ago her friends were
greatly surprised to lrarn tnat she bad
been quietly and quickly married to a Mr.
Preston, who resides at Twenty-third
avenue. No notices of the wedding were
6ent out, and it could hardly be called an !
elopemen t, because toward the last her)
io'.R'-. were taken into her conlidence. But j
the information of the approaching wei- j
dins was not made public.
After her weddine a honeymoon was '
decided upon In keeping with the young j
iaiy's taste?. She anft her husbana pro
cared two liery steeds and star:ed on a j
tour of the -onthern part of the State. '
Their proirres has been carefully watched j
by their friends, and in every town where
they have been they have created consid
erable intere.-t. an i the interior newspa
pers have published every move they have
matlp. Their tour took in San Jose, Santa
Crcz, Watsonville, Salinas and Woodiand
and many other citiesen route, an I finally
tn*y landed at her home t i. is afternoon.
In speaking ot her tuur Miss Lockwood
eaid: "We have bad Â« glorious time. It
may not have been a conventional way of
enjoying a honeymoon, but it suited me
. vo perfection, and I am sure my husband
' enjoyed it sh much as i dd. "it was an
i<ieal way of spending a few days and to
my mind was infinitely superior to being
cooped up in railroad cars or steamboat
cabin*.
"I can always enjoy myself as lone as I
have a good horse, ana the wilder the
better."
When asked about the riding habit that
phe found moat desirable Mrs. Preston
Jaugfced heariily. "A riding habit is a
nuisance." she said. "There is nothing
bo plea-ant for hor^e ridine, in my estima
tion, as a dividei skirt bo that a lady can
t-it astride on the saddle. This is the way
I always ride except wnen 1 am merely
amusing myself."
BARRED FROM COURT.
Bulda Johnaon's Presence Not Wanted
at the Trial of Jack
Howard.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 13.â The entire
day was occupied in Judge Ogden's court
in securing a jury for the trial of Jack
Howard, charged with felony in being an
accomplice to the murder of Anna John
son. The courtroom was well tilled,
many ladies being present.
As soon as the case was called the attor
neys held a consultation, which resulted
in Hulda Johnson being ordered to retire
from the room in the custody of a Deputy
Sheriff. This was due to a threat that
Hulda made to shoot Lizzie Reefs i! she
appeared to testify against Howard. The
girl carried a grip swunj over h? r shoul
der by a strap and the counsel feared that
the might make good her threat. Nothing
in the nature 01 a weapon was found on
her when searched.
Lizzie Keefe was locked up on a charge
of drunkenness in the City Jail the night
Howard and Hulda were arrested and
i f^rved her time. It was at this time that
\ tue claims to have heard Hulda say she
would "jjive the whole thing away."
Howard is said to have pleaded with her
not to jeopardize his neck, and she finally
consented to say nothing. Lizzie Keefe
was sut.penaed as a witness and then
Hulda made her threat.

MALOON AT WORK.
11. Notifies Bottling Companies That
!. They Mint Fay License* for
Kctttiling.
OAKLAND, Cal,, April 13â License In
spector Henry Maloon has issued the fol
lowing notice to the beer-bottling men of
this city:
You arc hereby notified to file with the City
Clerk yon r bond and application as per ordi
nance (1093), wfiich requires every person,
firm or corporation engaged In the sale of mal;
or iernit- nt'.-d liquors wlibin the limits of ihe
city of Oakland to procure a license. Over
two years ngo I caused the arrest ot persons
engaged In the bottling unit brewing busn.es>
in this city; an ngreement was entered into
between the attorney for the defense and my
self, whereby a test case waÂ« to be made, and if
the case was decided In favor of the License
Department they would comply with the ordi
nance and immediately procure a license.
A conviction was secured in the Police
Court, an ajpeal was made to the Supreme
Court and the decision of the lower court sus
tained. An appeal was made to the supreme
Court and refused a Hearing. Since that time
no license has been paid by you or any other
firm engaged In your line of business. As
license inspector of this city I must enforce
the license ordinance, but should also protect
the person who complies with the law. My
duty as a pubiic officer is to enforce the irw
not only in the interests of the public, DUt
also as an act of justice to those persons who
are also engaged in the sale of malt and fer
mented liquors p.nd who furnish a bond and
pay $100 for the privilege.
He claims that had the promise made
him just before his removal, two years
ago, t een kept the city would have leal
ized $7200 for tuose yeare. When he was
removed nothing along that line was
done and the matter is vow taken up just
where he left the work when Inspector
Mitchell was apbointeJ.
Woddyard Closed.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â The Asso
ciated Charities' woodyard has been
closed, owing to the lack of public patron
ape. The board of. directors are enthusi
astic over the Pingree plan of farming un

of five citizens from each ward selected to

OAKLAND. Ca;.., April 13.â The motor

WILL PROTECT DURRANT
Prison Director Fitzgerald Is
Angry at ttje Sereaade
of Last Sunday.
Beset With App xitions Froa People
Who Are Anx ous to See the Mur-
(hrer on the Scaffdd.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,}
908 hroadway, April 13. )
State Prison Director Fitzgerald l*
very angry at the statement that the band
at San Quentin played the dead march
outside Durrant's ceil last Sunday. He
will at once institute an inquiry to find
out if the story is true, and if (Â«uch proves
to be the case somebody is going to be se
vereiy reprimanded.
"I propose to bring the matter before
the State Prison Board at our meeting
next Tuesday," said Director Fitzgerald.
"I intend to get at the /acts in tne case
and will act accordingly. If the incident
be as stated, it certainly is most reprehen
sible and I propose to declare myself very
forcibly.
"1 scarcely think, though, that It was
willfully and maliciously done. In the
rirst place it is possible that the band is
practicing that piece, and would have
done so anyhow whether Durrant was
there or not. Then, again, supposing that
tbe band played it purposely, t is likely
that the officials did not recogniza it. Or
if they did, that they did not think of it in
connection with Durrant. lam inclined
to think and hope that this is the status of
the case, so I will say no mof about it
until I have had an opportunity to In
vestigate.
"I will state, though, that 1 <!o not pro
pose to allow any h> unding of Durrant
now that he is in the Btate Prison. All
that sort of thing stops at the jjate and
he will be treated as fairly and squarely
as any other convict. I am opposed to
permitting distinctions of any sort being
made regarding him. The exceeding in
terest in his case is shown by the number
of applications 1 am receiving for permits
to attend his execution. I am referring
them all to Warde n Hale, who is the
properly qualified officer to act in the
matter. I shall not witness tbe execu
tion, as I hare no desire whatever to at
tend that unhappy event."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 1897.
ASKED TO STOP
CROAKING FROGS
Peculiar Complaint Made
by the Residents of
East Oakland.
A Lake in a Vacant Lot is the
Habitat of Thousands
of Pests.
Criminal Proceedings Against the
Owners for Maintaining a Nui
sance May B> Tak n
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 13. !
A novel request hai been n_ade to the
Street Department by residents of East
Oakland, and, although it appears some
what humorous, it is a very serious mat
ter to about a dozen families who are sub
jected to the annoyance.
(Superintendent Miller has been asked to
do something to stOD the niehtly croak
ings of tens of thousands of frogs that
make their abode in a largo pond on one
side of a vacant lot, and he Is now study
ing how to oblige the complainants.
The lot in question is between East
Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth streets
and Eleventh and Thirteenth avenues.
It has been a standing annoyance for
years, but recently the number of frogt
has increased out of all rational rato, and
the inhabitants declare they must have
immediate relief or run .he risk of having
to go to a lunatic asylum.
In former years thu Fire Department
has been able to abate the nuisance during
n:e dry season by sending an engine :o
the pond and spending several days in
pumping it out. This metnod, however,
is only temporary, for the land ii such that
the drainaee for four blocks centers in the
pond. After dusk the croaking of the frogs
can be heard for three blocks and it is al
most impossible to secure any sleep, es
pecially on these warm nights when it is
necessary to keep all the windows open.
The Board of Public Works is somewhat
at a loss to deal with the matter. It has
been suggested that they poison the frogs,
but it is not likely that they could poison
them sufficiently to prevent a repetition
of the nuisance the first time a good shower
should again swell the pond.
Another proposition that has been ad
vanced is to have the pond declared a
nuisance and to take criminal proceed
ings against the owner under tbe same act
as the Tompkins Schooi marsh owner is
now being prosecuted. These two cases,
however, are very different, for the jenool
marsh nuisance consists of dead animals
a-nd all kinds of refuse and stagnant
water, which can be remedied when the
owner desires.
In tbe case of the East Oakland nui
sance the conditions are different, for the
nuisance consists ol the noise made by
thousands of animals which the owner
cannot control. Immediate relief will
probably be afforded by sending out an
engine to empty the lake, and the report
of tbe Stroet Department regarding per
manent relief will be watched with great
interest.
ECHOES OF THE ELECTION
Defeated Candidates in Berkeley
Tell How They Were
Beaten
The Time- Worn Custom of Wh elbar
row Rides Has an Inningâ Money
Handled Fr?e y.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 13.â The suc
cessful candidates in the election received
the congratulations of their friends to
day, while the defeated men made ex
planations of how the disaster to the new
born Republican movement was brought
about.
George Schmidt's supporters ascribe
his defeat to the character of the fieht
made for him by many of his supporters,
and to the suit that was brought in Oak
land to exclude his opponents' tickets
from the ballot. It is thought that the
personalities indulged in against Lloyd
and the suit mentioned cost the Repub
lican candidate many votes.
The leaders of the two non-partisan or
ganizations which fused against party
politics are jubilant at the result, and de
clare that it means a final deatli to all
efforts to establish a National party in
local affairs. By calculations upon the
vote ihey reach the conclusion that the
â¢trength ot the Republican movement is
aoout 300 votes. As there are nearly 2000
voters o: that party in a National election
in Berkeley the non-partisans claim that
the vote of yesterday is conclusive that
they will not have Notional political lines
drawn in municipal affairs.
The verdict of the voters is a decisive
one in support of thp present town admin
istration. The officers now incumbent
were roundly attacked by the Repub
licans and their actions were indorsed by
the non-panisnn parties, of which most of
them are members.
Quite a number of election bets were
paid to-day, many having been made, es
pecially on George Schmidt, who was re
garded as a sure winner. There was a
wheelbarrow bet at West Berkeley, and a
large number of bets were made at henvy
odds that the Republican wouM be the
next Marsha!. Bets of $20 to $5 were
made that he would carry Ward 3,
even when the count was welfttar'.ea and
Lioyd was found to be ahead.

BERKELEY. Cal., April 13.â The or
dinance providing for the tuberculin
test was finally passed last ni<ht by
the Board of Trustees, and is now in ef
fect. It requires all who sell milk in
Berkeley to have a certificate showing
that the cows furnishing the milk have
been tested with Dr. Koch's discovery and
found to be free from disease. Dr. Hubert
M. Powell, the Health Officer, will. pro
ceed at once to put the ordinance into ef
fect. According to the law as adopted,
t c town will pÂ«y the expenses of putting
the test inio operation, which will amount
to $1 for each animal. Diseased cows will
be condemned and killed and the owner
must stand tne lots. The National Gov
ernment will furnish the chemicals for the
test without charge. A conservative esti
mate places th* number of cow-* to be
tested at 800. From indications , it is ex
pected hat at least 10 per cent of them
will be found to be affected with con
sumption. '

A RECEIVING HOSPITAL
Alsmeda In Going to Find Oat Why
She Cannot Get
One
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 13.â Some time
ago the project of having a receiving hos
pital in this city, maintained at tho 01
--pense of the county, was mooted, and it was
decided to apply to the Supervisors for such
an institution. The Supervisors referred
the matter to District Attorney Snook for
an opinion an to the law bearing on the
subject, and he has reported that ha can
find no warrant in law for the county
maintaining a receiving hospital in a city.
Hence if Alameda wants a receiving hos
pital she will have to establish it at her
own expense.
But the parties who took up the matter
are not satisfied with tnis decision, and
they ask the pertinent question, If it
is legal for the county to maintain such
an establishment in Alameda. is it not
just as illegal for it to maintain an exactly
similar one in Oakland ? They propose to
prosecute the inquiry, too, and the tax
payers of Alameda are supporting them
in tne movement. They strongly object
to contributing for the support of an insti
tution which does them no good, while
denied an exactly similar one where it
would be of some use to them. The hos
pital matter will not be dropped with this
decision of the District Attorney.
City Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 13.â At the
meeting of the City Trustees last evening
the position of sergeant of police was
created with a salary of $90 per month
and Officer Conrad was promoted to the
position.
Bids were ordered advertised for sprink
ling the streets during the coming summer.
The proposed new laundry license ordi
nance went over for another week. As
the laundry men have all obtained
licenses that will not expire for a year
there is no loncer any great inierest in
the proposition to raise the license to a
high figure.
Trustee Lydecker introduced an ordi
nance makine the pay of laborers in the
street department $50 a month instead of
$40 as now. The proposition to close the
garbage dumps nt the east end of town
went over for another week.

ALAMEDA, Cal.. April 13.â a meeting
of the executive committee of the Alameda
Driving Association was held last evening
and the first meet of the season, on Memo

is anxious thatall members who can do so
enter their horses, for upon t:e number
and character of the; entries will depend
the programme of events. Entries will
close five days before the date of the meet
which is on a Monday, the races to bepin

TRIED TO EAT
A STEEL PIN
Tragic Attempt of a Maniac
to End His Life in
Court.
Destroyed His Mind by Smoking
a Score of Cigars a Day
for Years.
His Handsome Wife Fainted and WLi't
Struggling a D pu'y Sheriff
Sprains an Ankle
Oakland Office Sax Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 13. )
â¢William Grebe, a cigarmaker, whose
home is at San Leanciro, is a maniac of
the most violent kind. He imagines he is
about to be murdered and he is therefore
anxious that he should take his own life
before any one else han a chance to do so.
In court this morning he was the cen
tral figure of a most sensational scene.
While apparently quiet he seized his wife
by the head, tried to bite her face but was
prevented, pulled her hat from her head,
tore it to pieces with his teeth and finding
a long steel hairpin, he broke it in several
pieces in his mouth and attompted to
swallow them, for the purpose of commit
ting suicide. It is bolieved that h- did
swallow sonic of the pin, in which case the
effects may be fatal.
Grebe's mania is said to be the result of
smoking from fifteen to twenty cigars a
day. for a long while this habit has be
come stronger, until it has destroyed his
mind.
Yesteraay morning he was in Oakland
attending to business, and some of his
friends noticed his peculiar manner. Last
evening on his return home he went rav
ing mad and was brought to the County
Jail. On being taken into court this morn
ing it was necessary for two Sheriffs tore
strain him, and he strucs.'ed so that one
of the deputies had his ankle sprained. A
short examination showed that the man
was a violent lunatic, and while the com
mitment papers were being signed he
asked his wife for a glass of water. On
coming near enough to him he knocked
the plass from her hand, seized her by me
head and trii;d to bite her. Failing in
this be snatched her hat tina pin.
The deputies tried to make him disgorge
the broKen pin, but believe that he swal
lowed a piece of it.
His wife, who is not more than 25 years
of age, and a very handsome blonde
women, added to the sensational scene by
fainting dÂ»Â»ad away nnd having to be car
ried out of court. He also chewed up a
cigar and ate it, and swallowed the brass
head of the bat pin.
During this afternoon Grebe was found
to be in a precariouH condition and doctors
were sent for. He lapsed into uncon
sciousness and for a long time was in a
serious condition.
To-night Grebe was improving, and he
will bs taken to Stockton to-morrow.

HIS LEG WAS " MANGLED
Switchman Len Badly InjareA in a
Peculiar Itallroad Accident.
Tbrough the breaking of a train of forty
three freightcars on the steep grade of
the Southern Pacific road near Thirtieth
and Randall streets, about 10 o'clock last
night, Robert C. Leu, a switchman, suf
fered the loss of his right leg by amputa
tion.
The train was the regular freight, which
leaves Fourth and Townsend streets each
ni^ht at 9:30. It was more than usually
heavy, being loaded largely with live
stoct, and the two engines attached to
the front of it were unabie to haul it up
the eraae. Switch engine No. 1015, in
charge of Engineer McCarthy, was or
dered to couple on to the rear and aid the
train to the top of the grade.
Near th 9 top of the hill Leu jumpei
upon the footboard of the rear enzine pre
paratory to drawing the coupling pin
when the end of tlie rise was reached. He
was just reaching for the pin when the
train broke. This suddenly put on the
air brakes of the rear end of the train and
stopped it, and the engine that was push
ing the cars crashed into the caboose,
injuring that and damaging two other
cars.
Li3U was caught between the footboard
and the caboose and had his right leg so
batllv mangled that it had to be ampu
tated at St. Luke's Hospital, where he
was taken without loss of time. He was
put under chloroform so that his injuries
mignt be the better ascertained, and Dr.
Gardner, chief surgeon of the institution,
decided amputation was at once necessary
and the operation was promptly per
formed.
The switch-engine and the damaged
rars were landed back to the yards at
Fourth and Townsend streets.
Leu has been in the employ of the
Southern Pacific only one month. He
came recently from Pennsylvania, where
he had followed railroading for some
years. He is SO years of age and is mar
ried. There is no doubt of his recovery.

Henry Ward Itaecher's Couiln Now in

Unbeknown to any but intimate friends
a lady famed not only on account of her
family connections but for her brilliant
and original gifts ha? been in this City
since the 10th last. She is Miss A. M.

Stowe.
Jliss Beecber is now 75 years of ace, and
in the soft gloaming: of life has slipped
away from the rigorous climate of the
East and came unheralded to California
just as the flowers are blossoming and
nature has donned her spring robe of
green. This is the very time, she says,
that she has always wanted to view the
region of romanceâ California, the land
of the golden fleece.
While in Chicago Miss Beecher was
called upon to deliver thirty-six lecture?
in a few days. There is a possibility that
she may consent while here to lecture for
the benefit of California audiences.

THE METHOD OF I GREAT TREATMENT
FOR WEAKMSS OF Ml
WHICH rtTRKD HI AFTER EVERY-
THING KLSU FAILED.
Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man Is slowly waiting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
la no let up to the mental Buffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
whi\t they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sen of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
game to his aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
1 am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at onca could
they but get such a remedy as the one thai
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mall the Information, but send for it ana
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to set, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time of happiness to most of us. Write to
Thomas Slater, box 2283, Kalamaioo, Mich
and the information will be mailed in a plain

PRESIDENT McKINLEY FAVORS THE LINCOLN MONUMENT
UNITED STATES SENATOR PERKINS AND HON. JAMES Q. MAGUIRE HEARTILY COMMEND THE
PROJECT OF A MEMORIAL IN GOLDEN GATE PARK.
The proposition to er.-ct in Golden Qatfl
Park a monument to Abraham Lincoln,
the greatest American Who ever lived, i
commanding the attention of 1 lie most i
eminent men of the Uni;ed State?.
Letters commending the patriotic move- |
mentcome in every day's mail to W. \V.
Btone, president of the Lincom Monti- !
raeut League. The re-pon<iv<> menage*
suggest that it is eminently proper that a i
monument to ilie memory of the martyr '
should be reared in Golden Gate Park as a \
lesson to incoming visitor* liom oilier
countries.
Among the letters recently received, and
published flerewitli, is one lroru President ,
McKinley, another from United Starts i
Senator George C. Perkins, and one from ]
Kepresentative James G. Macuire.
Men authorized to speak for influential
organizations of colored poople promise
to do all. that they can do in aid of the
patriotic enterprise.
What is most gratifying of all to the j
promoters of the Monument Leacue iÂ«the i
favor bestowed by the class which Mr. :
Lincoln was pleased to designate the
"common people, whom the Lord must
love for he created so many of them."

"High Jinks."
Demosthenes Outdone â A Programme
That Would Have Delighted the
Festive Greeks.
A pedestrian passing the Alcazar build-
Ing, on O'Farrell street, near Powell, last
evening might have heard wafted on the
evening air ceriain strain! of music and
also of TOices conducive to the belief that
he had wandered into Bohemia. But no,
it was only the far-famed annual high
jinks of the Commercial Travelers' Asso
ciation.
From the drop of the tomahawk, fresh
stained with gore from the paint-can, to
the grand final bow, to which each mem
ber was forced to subscribe under pain of
instant decapitation, the Bacchean deity,
ably assisted and abetted by President
James Mersbon, reigned in triumph.
It was a "jinks" that henceforth will ro
Into history as the criterion of the organ
ization, to which all succeeding ones must
conform to be regarded as in the swim.
Preeidt nt Mershon, he of retail grocers'
picnic fame, led off with the opening ad
dress. As a member afterward put it,
"never in their palmiest days did old
Eimoon Cicero or Devastating Demos
thenes bettp*- succeed in scaring foreign
mndhens off the domestic marsh, where
their presence interfered with the solemn

Tue support which this class of people is
extending to the monument plan is so
widespread and sincere that tiie success
of the scheme is already assured.
Whatever may be said or written of
other Presidents and however much the
achievements of great military leaders
may be extolled, the plain simple fact .is
obvious that Lincoln is the ideal Ameri
can. Lincoln literatur â¢i* souu-bt, Lincoln
humor is solicited, and Lii.oln anecdotes
are enjoyed.
Lincoln to-day is aÂ« near the hearts of
I he common people as he waÂ«< on the day
that he broke the sh.ckies of the slave.
Little incidents connected with contribu
tors to the monument fund r.ptly tell the
story. The other day at school W. W.
Stone, the principal, asked the children
to bring copies of The Call that might be
bad at their respective homes, as he de
sired to mark an article or. Lincoln and
Bend it away. Among those bringine
papers was a little French girl, the small
est child in the school. She held the
paner in one hand, pointing to '-he Lincoln
article and holding a naif dollar in the
other hand said: "Mother wants to give
this to the Lincoln monument fund."
I president in doing hini3eli proud on this
j occasion."
The programme of ihe evenine was of a
j heterogenons description. It was as fol
i lows:

No decision was rendered in the second
contest, for, as the president graveiy an
nounced, one of the seconds made a claim
of foul, and the principal would have to
be examined by a competent physician to
â¢cc if he were afflicted with hernia.
Several members wore ereat silver-gilt
badges, with the inscription, "Police.
S. F. C. 1. A." Pipes and tobacco were
on hand in abundance.
The committee on the "high jinks" was
composed of F. Griffing, chairman; E.
Dunn, A. E. Green, E. Sherrin and
George Haskins. Much of the good time
enjoyed was due to the efforts of Secre
tary Green and Chairman Gritting. The
former thought that for a "high" old
time the new Call building is not in it.
THE OLYMPIC WHEELMEN.
They Met Lait >'l ht, but Nothing
Was Done Kelative to a
Return Race.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen met last
evening at the club and it was expected
that they would take some aciion regard
ing a return race with the Bay City cy
clists, but nothing was accomplished at
the meeting.
The officers went into executive session
after the meeting adjourned, and the
question of another race was discussed,
but no action was taken. Some were in
lavor of a race, while others opposed it.
Those who are in a position to speak on
the matter said tliat they did not expect
to see a return contest.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APTUL 14, 1897.
WHERE IS MRS.
DIMOND'S "ANGEL"?
The Lady of Theatrical
Aspirations I? in L3gal
Difficulties.
Sued on a Note Executed in
Honolulu Shortly Before
She Left.
She Promised to Pay $250 Within
Sixty Days at Any Bank in
Sin Francisco.
Mrs. Carey Higley Dimond, the Hono
lulu divorcee who cau-ed such a flurry in
Hawaiian society by leaving her borne to
become a theatrical star, and afterward
returning to tight the suit for a separation
brought by her husband when he found
that she had taken a manager with her,
has experienced her tirst taste of the
troubles that usually beset those who fol
low a theatrical life.
She has been sued.
Shortly before she left Honolulu â to be
precise, on February 10 lastâ Mrs. Dimond
found herseii in need of ready cash.
She had many friends in the islands,
and to one of these, AvÂ«rd J. Moore, she
applied for financial assistance, expecting,
of course, that engagements on the local
stages of San Francisco would be plenti
ful and that she would experience no
difficulty in paying any debt that she
might contract. Even hiph interest did
not deter her from going into debt. To
cover the amount of her obligation to Mr.
Avard sue executed the following promis
sory note and turned it over to her friend:
$250. Honolulu, H. 1., Feb. 10, 1897.
Two months after date I promise to i>Â«y to
the order of Avard J. IJoore the sum of $250
at any bank in Sun FrTncisco, Cai., U. S. A.,
in go;d coin, tor value received, with interest
at 12 per cent per ati num.
cabkt Higley Dimond.
Sixty days passed and the note was not
taten up. Mr. Avard sremedto be anxious
about the mat'.er, for his agents had or
ders to collect promptly, and tboueh the
i phrase, "any bank in San Fraiicuco, Cal.,
i U. S. A.," was rather vague they worked
diligently to secure their commission.
Three days passed without the money
Deing forthcoming, and then they decided
on drastic measures. J. J. Raver was
| called upon to get the money through the
I courts, and a complaint setting forth the
facts, with the note as an exhibit, was
filed in the Justice court.
Mrs. Dimond'* effects will ba attached
to secure the plaintiff, and Mr. Avard's
claim will be aired in the courts, with per
haps some interesting side lights on the
divorce case, unless Mrs. Dimond settles
the maiter by taking Dp the note.
Impatient Landlord Irvine.
James Irvine has sued William Wolff for I
$900 alleged to be due on account of rent for
the premises known as 1346 and 1348 Markot
streei, in this City, from the Ist day of March
to the Ist day of May, 1897. The time has not

M. CHARLEY IN A
LEGAL TANGLE
Difficulties of the French
Opera Company Im
presario.
Narrowly Escapes an Order of
Arrest and Several
Attachments.
Wanted to Take His Singers to Mexico
and They R?lusedâ Gave a B<nl
to C ver L ssi s.
M. Charley, manager and impresario of
the French Opera Compnny that just fin
ished a season in this City, departed yes
terday in a merry whirl of French pro
fanity and legal entanglements that will
not be settled until lie returns.
Orders of arrest, attachments, garnish
ments and c.-i-h bonds were as plentiful
as cherries in the season, and M. Charley
had the worst of the argument.
It all arose, according to the members
of the company who made life a legal
burden to the leader of the troupe, through
Charley's way of doing business. They
say that they were employed lor a season
that was to end in San Francisco, and
that their contracts read to that effect.
When the engagement was about to and
the impresario announced that be had
dated the company for a trip to Mexico,
and asked the singers to co with him to
the City of Mexico for a live days' season.
Some of the members of the troupe were
willing to go, but others held back and
staied that they wanted to go uoine.
They called M. Charley's attention to the
fact that their contracts culled for ex
penses and railroad fare to their starting
points and demanded the fulfillment ot
the contracts.
Then the impresario resorted to strata
gem. He held back a week's salary on all
of those who were not of his way of think
ing and refused to come up with the
tickets and expenses for their home jour
ney. He ailateo. on the pleasures and
profits of a journey to the Mexican capi
tal and jollied the objecting singers along
until the day before thfl troupe was to
depart.
Then the singers became desperate and
decided on extreme measures. They took
out an order for the arrest of M. Charley,
charging that he was about to leave the
State to defraud his creditors, sued out
attachments against the paraphernalia of
the company and prepared to battle for
their right* in the courts.
Prevost, the leading tenor, put a claim
of $580 in the hands of J. J. Raver, und
Depuiy Sheriff Byington was speedily on
the trail of the manager. Four members
of the troupe, Gaston Morales. A. Debtor,
C. Roche and Mile. Jennesse pooled issues
and sued for $263, and a writ 01 attachment
followed hot on the trail of the Prevost
claim.
M. Charley, probably by accident,
dodced tne order of arrest by taking a
different route tnan the one first intended,
and went across the bay while the Deputy
Sheriff was awaiting him at Third and
Townsend streets.
Before the train left, however, he was
overhauled, and believing that his bag
eage would be stopped before he could eel.
out of ihe State consented to give a cash
bond covering the claims, pending a set
tlement.
When tne train pulled out the company
was short a tenor and four minor singers,
and M. Charley was storming up and
down the car, swearin? fluently and ex
pressins his disgust in strong terms.
Later in the day Attorney Ruef and the
French Bank were served with garnish
ments to cover any money be,onginiÂ» to
M. Charley that mignt be in their posses
sion.
Tenor Prevost will sing at the Tivoli, it
is said, pending the return of his ex-man
ager and the unraveling of the financial
tangle. _^_______^^_

rived opposite Goat Island last niÃht a man of
: about 45 years of age, poorly dressed and with
I a small mustache, jumped overboard from the
j upDer deck.
He was observed by John McDonouch. a
1 deckhand, to be acting queerly, and so the
j deckhand a=kcd him if he were ttoine to jimp
over. He said "No, it would be cowardly,"
and then, as McDonough turned aside, he dis
appeared over the rail.
A boat was lowered, and for ten minutes a
search for the body was kept up, but failing to
find anything, the* boat returned and the ferry
steamer proceeded on its wav across the bay.
