LONDON, Esq., March 28.â The Graphic
to-morrow will give prominence to a state
ment which it claims to have received
from an unquestionable source to the
effect that the Greek situation is extremely
grave. It says that with the departure of
Crown Prince Constantino from Athens to
take command of the troops in Thessaly
the die seems to have been cast.
War would be inevitable if Greece re
called her army. It would march to
Athens and dethrone the King. The
most serious element of the situation -is
the undoubted fact, despite denials, that
the concert of the powers is no longer
solid. There has not been -actual rupture,
but the members have come to the con
clusion that concerted action is a failure.
If the so-called concert continues for a
week it cannot continue longer.
The statement ascribes the position to
the impatience of the powers witb Greece's
reckless conduct and Great Britain's re
luctance to coerce her. The powers will
not, accept Lord Salisbury's proposal . for
the establish ment' of a neutral zone a mile
wide on either sida of the Turko-Grecian
boundary, because Turkey holds all the
best strategic positions on -the frontier,
and fears that if sne withdraws her troops*
the Greeks will find a pretext later to re
turn and occupy the positions, which
would enable her to invade Turkey. This
would prevent the powers from localizing
the war, would set all the Balkans aflame,
induce general brigandage in Turkey, in
duce Austria and Russia to interfere and
blow up the European mine.
The Telegraph will to-morrow publish a
dispatch from Suda, Crete, stating that
the insurgents to-day fired upon a Russian
torpedo-boat, which replied to the fire.
The dispatch adds it is feared tbat a war
without quarter will shortly begin with
the Cretan Christians pitted against the
Turks and European?. "'The dispatch con
firms the reports concerning the desperate
feeling that exists in the island. 77
The Times has a dispatch from its cor
respondent at Canea, who describes the
Greek troops arid insurgents as becoming
absolutely desperate.' Tbe insureents
were utterly astounded at the fleet's bom
bardment of Malaxa on Thursday.
The shelling began- at the moment when
the Turkish garrison having yielded, the
blockhouse was full of rebels and forty
three prisoners. The first shell destroyed
one wall of the blockhouse and killed
three men. The victors speedily vacated
the piace, taking with them their prisoners,
who* are now at Alikianu. The insur
gents again attacked the Aptora block
house, near Izzedin to-day, but they were
driven back by the. ltalians, Russians and
English.
The British warship Dryad found yester
day four caiques that were landing con
traband. She sank two of the boats and
captured ' tue other two, Most of the
cargo from the boats- had already been
landed. The insurgents were furious
against the British and fired, on a boat in
which were Amiral Harris and Lieutenant
Buller, both of whom were in uniform. 7
The Times to-morrow will publish a dis
patch from Athens saving that those ex
ercising the greatest influence upon pub
lic opinion seem bent upon war. The
dispatch adds that communication has
been established between the Greek offi
cials and Colonel Vassos in Crete by means
of flash signals by way of the island of
Anticythera, south of Cerigo.
ATHENS, Greece. March 28.â A band
of Armenians, Cretans and Turks have
boarded an Egyptian steamer at the Pi
rcEus and forcibly released an . Armenian
prisoner who was being conveyed from
Syria to Constantinople. The incident is
likely to cause complications.
Reports from various places in Crete
show that there is not the slightest im
provement in the ( condition of affairs in
that island. The fighting between the
"Moslems and the Christians continues and
the burning of villages is a matter of daily
occurrence.
There is no prospect of a betterment in
the situation. It is apparent that the
bombardment of the Christians by the
foreign warships is merely a waste of shot
and shell. When the insurgents are
scattered by the fire from the warships
they disperse, only to reappear shortly
in some other place in the vicinity.
It_b***s been learned that several mem
bers of the Turkish garrison at \E_>.laxa,
who were supposed to have been killed
when the Turks were "compelled to evacu
ate tbe block-bouse at that place, were
captured by the insurgents. The prison
ers were conveyed to the camp of Colonel
Vassos, the commander of tbe Greek
army of occupation.

which was lying at the Piraeus, and over-,
awed the crew by a display of revolvers. '
They then proceeded to jettison the entire
cargo of the steamer, which consisted of
flour for the Turkish troops at Canea,*
25,000 eggs for the Russian fleet ann quan
tities of provisions for the English fleet in
Cretan waters. Â..'.'* â â 
There was a remarkable display of en
thusiasm when Crown Prince Constantine
went on board the royal yacht en route for
Volo, in Thessaly, where be will disem

houses of the town were brilliantly illumi
nated and there were frequent feuxde joie.
Prior to the sailing of the yacht Prime
Minister Deiyannis had a conference with
the Crown Prince that lasted for an hour.
CANEA, Crete. March Three hun
dred international troops have been dis
patched to the village of Outsonnarria,

capture by the insurgents, who, were they
to obtain possession of the water supply,
would practically have Canea at tbeir
mercy. 7 7.7- jfi.
Since the capture !of Malaxa'by the in
surgents they have massed themselves on
the heights aDove the town of Suda and
commenced an attack upon the Izzedin
fort. To-day the Italian warships in Suda
Bay, supporting the Turkish ' garrison,
fired upon the Christians.
The conditions which prevail through
out the island are beyond description!
Warfare, rapine and pillage are going on
in every direction, and thus far the forces
of the powers have been absolutely power
less to preserve order, even in the coast
towns. The Cretan Christians and the
Greeks are firmly resolved to bring about
the annexation of the island :to Greece,
while the Moslems appear to be equally
determined to prevent such a consumma
tion The Turks declare that if the island
is handed over to Greece tbey will mas
sacre not only every f oroierier,'* but even
their own women and children, and then
right the Christians to the bitter end. 7
\ Nobod y doubts their willingness to mas
sacre the Christians, but, under the, cir
cumstances they would* find the Chris
tians in the interior fully capable of pro
tecting their own lives. In the principal
towns on the coast the presence of inter
national troops will, it is believed, prove
an effectual check to the bloody instincts
of the Moslems. Though the powers have
heretofore 'displayed much favoritism
toward the Turks it is not for a moment
believed they would countenance a mas
sacre of the Christians. ;.*â¢ â¢* v ; 7"

\ BERLIN. Germany, March 28.â Despite
the perplexities of tne. ministerial situa
tion and the calls upon' his time arising
from the memorial fetes of the past week,
the Kaiser has been able to give a large
shaie of his attention to the Eastern;
crisis.* Nearly every day he has held pro
tracted conference with the Chancellor or
Baron Marscball yon Bieberstein, Minister
of Foreign Affairs, at which, though in
ternal affairs were undoubtedly discussed,
the foreign situation bad a prominent
part. It is known that the Kaiser has
been again in direct communication with
the Sultan, and following his occasional
use of the right to be his own Foreign Min
ister, - has sent personal instructions | to
Baron Sakerma yon Jeltscb, German Em
bassador at Constantinople, and to Baron
yon Pieisten, German Minister at Athens.
((The ministerial . press . here '*_ argue with
some apparent degree of justice that the
Kaiser is again resuming an active role in
the probable negotiations concerning
Greece and nas entirely disinterested aims.
If he seemingly follows in the wake of the
Czar it is because of the fact that up to the:
present time the policy of Russia has been
directed, to the maintenance of the status
quo in the Balkan peninsula, which con
curs not only with the general interests of
peace, but especially agrees with the in
terests of Austria, Germany's ally.
But there are prospects of the divergence
of Germany from Russia's lead. Previous
dispatches have already denounced the
current fictions that the Kaiser's policy
was _in -any. 7 wise influenced by his per
sonal enmity to the Greek royal family or
that be had ceased all relations with his
sister, the Duchess of Sparta. There is
good ground for stating that while oppos
ing Greece's , seizure of Crete the Kaiser
has had view the satisfaction of Greek
claims in another quarter and that he has
now suggested to the Sultan the rectifica
tion of the frontiers of Greece according
to the terms pf the fourteenth protocol of
the Berlin treaty. It is felt and admitted
in the highest quarters- here . that Greece
cannot withdraw from Crete, abandon all
her claims and submit to the behests of
the powers without some compensation.
A revolution at Athens after so many sac
rifices on the; part of"" the nation would be ;
inevitable. 7 Crete is \ for the time, at all
events, lost to Greece, but" King George
has caused tbe powers to be informed that;
the basis of a pacific settlement can be

territory that is accorded to ber under the

GREENOCK; Scotlanp, March 28.â The
report that: the steamer Yanariva, a
British tramp vessel from Newport News
for Glasgow, bad picked up some of tbe
survivors of the foundered French steamer
St. Nazaire, 7 turns out to have been cor
rect. The Yanariva' arrived here to-day
and reports that she had rescued sixteen
of those who were on the ill-fated steamer
and who bad tÂ«*keri7;to j a small boat ; just
before the Si. Nazaire went down off Cape
Hatteras during a heavy gale. â '.'{' 7 *77
7 The lookout *on the Yanariva sighted a
small boat some distance from her dis
playing -a signal of distress.- She bore
down to the bbat , and soon had , the ; sur
vivors on board, where '*. everything '. pos- .
sible Was done for their comfort. As soon
as the rescued people were able to give the
details of i the : disaster that had befallen
-the j St. f Nazaire, they 1 told *a : story that
agreed in all its material details with the
report of the foundering of 'the steamer
cabled here from the United States. ,
The boat which the Yanariva picked up
bad contained eighteen persons, but when
the steamer sighted it there were only six
teen persons alive in it, the others having
died 7 â  from . the effects ./Jot': exposure
and hunger. The survivors ; were ex
hausted when they were ; rescued and if
the Yanariva had not seen their. boat they
would have all drowned in a short time.
The Yanariva saw nothing of the other
boats which left the St. Nazaire.
Captain Weston, -the : '-J* master of _ the ;
Yanariva, tells a f graphic story 7of -\ the
rescue. 7 Be nays tbat oa March * 18, eight
days after he left Newport News, it was
reported to him that a dark object, appar
ently flying a signal of distress, could be
seen some distance off. He at once scru
tinized the object- through a marine glass
and.* thought be saw living persons in a
boat. ;He at once gave orders to the man
at the wheel to change the course of the
steamer so that she would run down to
the windward of the boat.
; . When the Yanariva approached the
boat, it was seen .that there were sixteen
persons lin her. IThere1 There tbey â  were plain
enough, and the boat was soon under the
lee of the steamer. Finally despite the
rough sea the boat was brought alongside
and lines were thrown to those in her and
they. were hauled on board.
The survivors presented a most pitiable

appearance. Their faces were wan and
haggard, their eyes were bulging from
their sockets and their scant clothing
hung about them in loose folds. All were
in a condition of the greatest exhaustion
and were unable to stand when they,
reached the "â  decks. 7 Two of the ; number
had lost their, reason from the terrible
sufferings they had endured, and they had
to be restrained by the men of the steamer.*
The boat had left the St. Nazaire in
such baste that she had not been properly
provisioned. There was only a small tin
of biscuits aboard of her, and - this, it is
believed, was part of the stores supposed
to be kept in the lifeboats for use in just
such a contingency as had occurred.
7 After three days of the best care possi
ble to give the rescued people with the
meager facilities of the steamer all of
tbem were able to partake of solid food.
Thereafter they progressed favorably, but
had not yet fully recovered from the ef
fects of their terrible experience.
The survivors are: Pierre Nicolais, sec
ond captain ; Germain Giraud, second en
gineer; P. Lauretzetti, third engineer (all
belonging in Marseilles); Nicolas Sauva
nei, Cuba, a passenger; twelve sailors be
longing to Martinique. â¢ '/".." 7*7 .r.'l
In an interview with one of the officers
he described the capsizing or smashing of
the boats when they were attempting to
leave the St. Nazaire. When the boat in
which the survivors were found was
launched Second Captain Nicolas took
command of her. The weather was ex
tremely rough and continued so for sev
eral days. A sail was rigged and Captain
Nicolas managed to keep her running
head to . the ' wind. This, though a dan
gerous maneuver, was, the only thing pos
sible to do under the circumstances, as to
have kept the boat on any other point of
sailing would have resulted in her being
swamped. As it was the combing seas
followed close upon the stern of the boat
and every moment threatened to break
aboard and fill her. The water constantly
poured over the gunwales and every soul
in the boat was drenched to the skin. The
water was bailed out, .and this work : un
doubtedly saved the lives of some of the
men, for otherwise they might .have been
frozen to death. The salt encrusted on
their laces and bands and caused much
pain. 7,77 ."â¢' * '***'. '.-*â¢â ' *\' - '.V .
The suddenness with which it was nec
essary to abandon the St. Nazaire pre
vented any attempt being made to put a
supply of water in the' boat. Some lo', the
men withstood the ; tortures of thirst as
long as it was possible for human nature
to do ao. 7 Then, maddened by the torture
to which they were subjecied, tbey drank
sea water. Their agony was then worse
than ever, and in a short time they went

ting the sea water into their mouths and
prevented by force some of the others
from doing so. Those who were mad
dened by drinking were held in the boat
until the strength of their would-be sa
viors failed, when with cursing cries they
threw themselves overboard to escape the
torture that was racking their frames.
Words cannot express the agony that
was experienced by all. Day after day
they vainly scanned the heaving breast'
of the ocean for sight of a sail. Gulls fly
ing close to the sea or the breaking top of
a wave were frequently mistaken for a
gleam of a vessel, and finally all bands
almost abandoned hope of ever being
picked up. ""77 7 77
On the morning of March 18 the smoke
of a steamer was seen streaming in a lon
line upon . the distant horizon. For a
long time it could not be determined what
course she was steering, and the men were
fairly frantic with fear lest she would not
see them, The steamer was then too far
away to allow of a signal from. the boat
being seen. Ultimately the topmasts,
lower masts, and then the bull of the
steamer came up in full view, and then a
signal was set. 7' 7. -. ' _ Â '. ..' '//

: The identification of the dead Forbes as
the murderer Blanther was far more com
plete than the dispatches from Meridian
warranted the authorities here to believe.
George A. Dodge, the one-time friend and
companion of Mrs. Langfeld's slayer, who
went to Texas witb Gibson to say whether
or not the prisoner were Blanther, also
returned yesterday and declared that
tbere was absolutely no doubt us to the

to Gibson ' (care of Chief of Police of

went -to the Sheriff's oftk i and made a
sworn statement that I knew the body to
be that of Josef E. . Blantber. That day
(tbe 23d of March) I spent* around the
town and listened to various statements
made by people who had known the dead
man under the name of Forbes.
"I afterward went to the cell where
Blanther ; had been confined, and Jailer
Womack, at .. my suggestion, searched the
place for evidence of anything containing
poison. He found â¢ nothing. I found
some sheets of paper containing parts of
letters which tbe prisoner bad started to
write; also a piece of poetry. T- recog
nized the writing as that .of Blantber, as
I bad known ;it in San Francisco. 1 saw
a pair of cuffs, a soiled collar and. a neck
tie, which, I was<old, had been worn by
the prisoner, known 'as Forbes or Blan

white enamel and silver stars, which I
had seen him wear in San Francisco.

this writing also as being that of Blanther.
"I noticed on the dead body a pair of

seen Blanther wearing in San Francisco.
The trousers were brought by us to San

"From various sources I learned that
the man known there and at Kopperl as
Arthur Forbes had commenced teaching
school at the latter place on October 1,

j February 1, 1897, at a salary of $60 per
month; tbat the woman known as bis
wife kept house for him ; tbat at first be
had no money, and that he had to borrow
on bis warrants in advance in order to get
furniture and the mcest-aries of life. He
bad joined tbe Methodist Congregational
Church at Kopperl. His wife bad seemed
very devout, but the women ol Kopperl
objected to her as being "too fast" for the
-community. After a few months the peo
ple whose children were attending school
tbere wanted to ret rid of Forbes, but as
they could not oust him they stopped the.r
children from attending. â¢'â -/.,:
"Forbes' wife left him, I was told, on
December 9, 1896, to go to Texarkana, in
tending, she stated, to live with her
mother â or, as she told others, her grand
mother. * It has been learned that she did
not go to Texarkana. I found since that
she was living at Dallas, Texas.7"' â¢* '*â  "-:: â â â 
"Jailor Womack showed me an open
*â  faced and probably' -.old watch, Which, he
said, Blanther wore when captured. It
had a silk braided fob. I never saw the
watch previous to this."
Detective Gibson's official statement to
Captain Lees is practically a repetition of
that eiven by Dodge, but is less in detail.
He adds, however, that after viewing the
remains and satisfying himself that tbey
were those of tbe much-wanted murderer,
he had them removed to the jail-yard and
photographed. Then, the chin-beard was
shaved off, Blanther's glasses adjusted,
and another negative taken. The detec
tive says that nobody seeing tbe body in
its last-named condition could doubt its
identity. : Continuing, Gibson says:
"We then opened the two trunks that
Blanther bad in his possession at the time
of his arrest. One contained tbe effects of
a woman and the other the eff- cts of a
gentleman. I had tbe gentleman's trunk
shipped to tbis City, leaving the other one
there after searching tbo same. I learned
tnat Mr-. Forbes left him on December 9
on account of biro being too attentive to
certain ladies of the town.' Her mother
is living with Mrs. E. E. Stewart, Mrs.
Forbes' grandmother.
.."In his trunk was fonnd an empty vial
marked one-fourth grain morphine pills.
The doctor says he died of morphine
poisoning. J : y'jJ' '/-J
"Blanther, while semi-cdnscious, asked
Mr. Golden if be bad seen any papers
from California, and on being told 'yes, 'â
Blanther wanted to know if there was
anything in them Dr. Scott. To
Thomas Adams, a schoolmaster of Merid
ian and a personal friend of his,' Blanther
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH', 29, 1897.
said: 'Why don't they let me die here?
If I am taken back to California it will be
the death penalty, and I want to die
here.'" 7 : 7-77
The "Dr. Scott" whom Blanther referred
to in his mutterings is believed by the
police to be a myth., At least no trace of
any such individual could ever be found
here, even though a most diligent search
was made. It will be remembered that
not many weeks after Blanther's flight
from this City one of the local newspa
pers received a letter from him, bearing
the Postmark of Atlanta, Ga., in; which
he declared that be was . innocent of the
murierof Mrs. Langfeld, and accused a
"Dr. Scott" of having committed the
crime. The police investigated,' but as
before stated reached the conclusion that
such a person did not exist. ' 'â¢
The strange watch that was found
among Blanther's effects is accounted for
in a - letter addressed* to "him .-,;" by Mrs.
Nelson, "Forbes' "alleged mother-in-law.
When jailed i-e wrote to her for sympathy
and assistance. In her reply She says
that her husband had been making in
quiries about the watch his "son-in-law"
bad borrowed, but now.that the latter was
in trouble he could keep it if it would aid
bm in his trouble. So far as "Mrs.
Forbes," Blanther's alleged .wife, is con
cerned. Captain Lees says be is satisfied
that they were never married. -
That Blanther was never deficient in
the art of prevarication is evidenced by
the letter he wrote to County Judge
Thompson of Meridian in reference to his
application for a position as, school
teacher. 7 -7 '
Being without a certificate or creden
tials, he gave the Judge by way of creden
tials a list of places and schools where, he
alleged, ho had taught in Texasâ not a
word of which was true and artfully ex
plained his temporary inability to produce
bis "university certificate."
Blanther wrote to a Mrs. P. T. Johnson,
who was his landlady, in Texarkana, and
endeavored to persuade her to prove an
alibi for him. Her reply is in the pos
session of Captain j Lees, and was as fol
lows:
* - Texarkana, March 18, 1897.
Hr. Arthur Forbes, Meridian, Tex.â De,xr tip.:
Yours of the. 17th received and 1 hasten to re
ply, as you request, feeling sure it is tbe Lest
way to express 'my sympathy* and to assure
you of my sincere regret that you should be In
such -trouble. You came to me . from the
Bechem House June 3, remaining six weeks,
or about that long. These dates are copied

trust you will come out of your trouble all
right. 1 will see your grandma before I send
this letter and get the date of your arrival in
town. Yours very truly,
â â --. %// ' ' Mrs. P. T. Johnson.
Inasmuch, as Mrs. Lang-eld was mur
dered on the night of May 15, 1890, it. will
be seen that Mrs. Johnson's dates were of
no service to Blanther.
The story of the arrest of Blanther, as
learned by Detective Gibson and Mi.
Dodge, is interesting. Randal -upon see
ing the picture of Blanther in The Detect
ive had noticed its resemblance to the man
they knew as Forbes, so he and Womack
decided to go at once to Kopperl and ar
rest him. . When they reached tnat place
on March 15 they saw Forbes at the sta
tion and heard his friends bidding him
cood- by, as lie was about to :ak_ttbat same
train to Cleburne, to which place he had
bought a ticket. Stepping up to him Wo
mack touched him on tbe arm and said,
"Hold on." 7 7 -.., . ...
Forbes turned around and reached out
his hand, as if thinking it was some one
who was going to bid him good- by. .Wo
mack kept hold of Forbes' hand and said:
"Isn't your name Blanther?" 7
: Tne schoolteacher said his name was
Fortes, the professor of that school dis
trict 7 â¢ â '
Womack told him he had information
that he was Blanther and that" be would
bave to taee him to Meridian, where, ..if
he were not Blanther be would- have
plenty of chance to prove it. /. .
Blanther made a struggle, but Randal
and Womack had- hold ot him and he
could not get away. Tbey searched Blan
ther and took possession of such money
and other articles as they found upon him.
He accompanied them quietly io Meri
dian.'-.
-Just how Blanther succeeded in carrying
with him into tbe prison the poison- which
ended his life proved a. mystery to the
Meridian authorities. They searched him
thoroughly after the capture and deprived
him of every article he carried. The only
solution they can give is that he had long
feared Capture and had for many months
carried the death-dealing powder sewed
up in the lining of his clothing so that he
might be sure of having it : when -it was
needed.

His last claim for -salary in February
was not honored. After that Forbes began
to formulate a plan to start a | business
school. He corresponded with a gentle
man of good standing at Cleburne and the
matter 'was soon arranged. The i rofes
sor's plausible style won the confidence of
the man who was to be his associate in
the venture. . 7 J
On the 15:h of March tbe friends of Pro
fessor Forbes were at the station at Kop

bad been purchased and his trunks were
checked to Cleburne. -

realized in a flash that that handclasp
meant deathâ that; it was the grasp of
outraged law, and would never relax until
he had paid the penalty of a cold-blooded
murder. ' -- 7 7
. There was but little resistance. Homer
Randal, a tall, fine-looking specimen of
young Texas manhood, went to the other
side of Blanther and, as the train pulled
out, the ; prisoner was formally placed
under arrest as the wanted Califor

Those Texan officers were | tender

always felt as though tbey ought to apol
ogize for the inconvenience they were
causing their prisoner. 7 They would get
such delicacies at the hotel as they could
obtain for their involuntary ; * guest.' Ap
parently Blanther was. unconcerned. He
incessantly rolled and smoked cigarettes,
and occasionally. wrote. -
I found a piece of poet in his cell; it

One day they told B. anther that officers

On Saturday, the 21st, be was told that
the officers were expected from California
the next. day. Tnat night at about 12
o'clock be was seen by a fellow-prisoner
to' put something from a piece of paper
into his mouth and then take a drink of

At about 3 o'clock in the morning bis

PERHAPS A CLASH
IN THE SENATE
Republicans and Allied
Opponents Disagree as.
to Committees.
Democrats of the Minority Hope
to Force an Acquiescence
to Their Plans.

Mrjority Leaders Will Hold a Caucus
to Hear the port of the Steer
ing Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 28.â
There is a strong probability of a clash
between the Republicans and their allied
opponents in the Senate this week on the
question of the committee vacancies. The
Democrats have attacked the validity of
the action of the committee on postoffices
and postroads in taking under considera
tion nominations . when the committee
was not more than half filled, despite the
'act that a resolution was passed at the
close of the last session of the Fifty-fourth
Congress continuing tbe Senate commit
tees and authorizing them to transact busi
ness until the vacancies'; were filled. '* By
attacking the legality of the committees
as at present constituted the Democrats
hope to force the Republicans to agree to
their programme of permitting the total
membership of the committees to remain
as at present constituted ; the Democrats
hereafter to name a Democrat for every
Senator of that party whose term expired,
on the fourth of March last
: The R publicans will hold a caucus
Tuesday afternoon for the "..'. purpose of
hearing the report of their steering com
mittee and solving the difficult problem
that now confronts tbem. The demand
of the Democrats is understood to be tbat
they shall have precisely. the same minor
ity representation which they granted the
Republican minority when the Repub
lican were a solid body and did not have
the present conditions of â  free silver disin
tegration to contend with. The Republi
cans, on the other hand, contend that the
Senators who bolted the St. Louis conven
tion are no longer members of the Repub
. lican party. 7 Tbey acknowledge that by
tbe former action of the Republican party
some of these Senators have received very
valuable committee assignments, but they
insist that these positions cannot now be
charged up against the straight Republi
cans. The Democrats .refuse to recognize
any division in the Republican party. Ac
cording to this contention the Republi
cans, if their demands were granted, al
though holding the chairmanships, would
be in the minority on all the important
committees. â¢" .'...* '
'7 This is particularly true of the Com
mittees on Appropriations and Finance.
The Democrats insist upon -the appoint
ment of a Democrat to succeed â¢ Voorhees
on tbe Finance Committee and also in
sist upon counting Jones . of, Nevada * (Sil
ver Republican) as _ Republican, to help
make up lhe Republican membership of
the same committee. The Republicans
have offered to. accept Jones as one of
their assignments if the Democrats will
agree to assign a Gold Democrat to the
committee, but this has b en declined.
The situation has been quietly can
vassed and the Republicans, failing to
bring the Democrats to terms on grounds
wi ich tney consider reasonable, will prob
ably try new tactics; this week. They
contemplate offering a resolution declar
ing tbe membership of the various com
mittees shall consist of a certain number
of Senators belonging to each party, the
number to be designated in tbe case of
each committee. 7*7 7
Tbis resolution, introduced by the Re
publicans, will bo carried either by the af
firmative votes of the Populists or their
refusal to vote as they did when â¢ the Re
publicans reorganized the Senate and
took control. It is expected that the uol I
Democrats will decline to vote, and this
will give the Republicans a clear majority
of tbe quorum of the Senate and carry the
resolution that will be offered. Â
If this programme cau be successfully
carried out the Republicans will then feel
free to caucus and designate their assign
ments to the various committees and then
to ask the Democratic committee to fill in
turn their various assignments. This will
bring the matter to a square issue. Re
publicans who have**- the matter in charge
profess their belief in the success of the
plan.'- ' "' -' - : : - - * " 'â¢ *
.So far as the business /of the Senate
proper is concerned it looks as if the gen
eral treaty of . arbitration with .Great
Britain would take up the major part of
the week. An ' agreement has been
reached to take a vote Wednesday after

FOUGHT OVER THE CORPSE.
Nsgroes Drew Razors and Faced Police

ST. JOSEPH, Mo., March 23.â Coroner
Spier Richmond attempted to hold an in
quest over the' dead body of Mrs. James
Payne, who died suddenly about 1 o'clock
last night after having retired in the best
of health a few hours before. Rumors of
foul play started in the neighborhood led
to the investigation." When the Coroner
started to move the body to the Morgue
the husband and family of the 'dead
woman refused to allow him to do so.
*â¢'; A posse of policemen and deputy sher
iffs was summoned, -The house was en
tered and -the. remains placed in a coffin.
When the bearers started for the door the
crowd of negroes began to force their way
in and a band to hand conflict ensued, in
which razors and clubs were drawn by the
colored. contingent and guns by the offi
cers. Payne was knocked down in the act
of clubbing an officer.
The big guns carried by the officers
finally intimidated the negroes and they
sullenly fell back and allowed the coffin
and its contents to be taken away. Such
was the feeling among the friends of Mrs.
Payne that it was feared that there might
be an attack on the Morgue and a squad
of policemen under Captain Bloomer was
kept on guard all the afternoon.
In view of the rumors of foul play and
the opposition encountered by the Cor
oner in hi* investigation it is possible that
a search warrant will be demanded in or
der to view the premises. 1 _\ The colored
people say no man sball enter the house
again and if any attempt is made to search
the place tbe officers anticipate trouble
and possibly bloodshed. 777 * *' *M â '". â¢

anxiety. One moment boat would be
on top of a wave and the steamer would be
seen and, then', sbe | would, sink into the
trough and. the steamer would be lost to
view/ Finally their anxiety turned to
hope and then to certainty for it was seen
that the steamer was steering for them.
There was only inches of freeboard of
the boat showing and it was learned after
wards that it was this that first attracted
the attention of those on the Yanariva be
fore the signal that had been set was seen.
So low was the boat in the water that it
was expected momentarily that she would
sink," the men '" being ' too exhausted to
make any attempt to free ber.
After an hour of horrible suspense dur
ing which time the Yanariva was man
euvering to get tiie boat under her lee the
survivors were hauled aboard the steamer.
Their joy was intense when they felt a
solid deck again beneath their feet.
' Tnose who were saved had no knowl
edge of. the fate of those who had left the
St. Nazaire in the other boats, but before
they parted company with the captain's
boat they frequently saw those in her
dropping corpses \ overboard. 7 Many .of
those in that boat seemed to be raving
mad. â -
The names of the crew who were saved
by the Yanariva are: Paupaire,- Durac,
Chaudierre, two men named Ludon. all
sailors; 7- Martea - ,; Madeline, i Salvore,
Cacheux, Cleadofe, Saguet, all firemen..
Captain Weston of the Yanariva say-"f|
that the boat wa*> sighted at 11 o'clock o 1
the morning of March 12 and not March
18 as has been stated. She was then- 253
miles from New York. It was a difficult
task to make the rescue. The sea was run
ning high, and at times the boat was car
ried to -a, level with the steamer's deck.
It was feared that the steamer would be
driven too close to her and swamp her.
The occupants were too weak to render
the slightest assistance to the steamer in
getting them aboard. For four days they
bad been without food or water, and some
of them had left tbe St. Nazaire so hur
riedly : that they did not have a. proper
supply, of clothin Â Those ill-clad men
had suffered extremely from the cold. J
- When the men were taken aboard the
steamer they fell into alternate paroxysms
of laughing and crying. After the rescue
had been * fleeted Captain Weston put a
man at the masthead of the Yanariva to
keep a lookout for tbe otber boats, but no
trace of them was seen. 7

THE MISSISSIPPI
Lowlands Inundated by the
Swirling, Rushing
Waters.

Glcomy.
Mills Are Sw3mp?d an- Farmers Along
the Flats Are Now Fleeing

QUINCY, 111., March 28.â -The Missis
sippi River continues to keep up its aver
age of the past week and marked another
rise of .fix inches to-day, bringing the
stage up to fifteen feet above low-water
mark. Reports from northern points are
very discouraging, and the indications are
that to-morrow will see another six-inch
rise. The situation is growing worse
hourly. Hundreds of families have been
driven out of the lowlands which are un
protected by levees.
The water bas inundated the Miisouri
bottoms for a distance of seven miles
bacK from the river bank. Up in the
levee districts things look gloomy. Al
though the water has not yet reached tbe
top of the levee a break is expected at any
time, and a big force of men is working
day and night to strengthen the weak
places. Another force is engaged in pa
trolling the levee. The damage already
done by tbe flood is great, but is nothing
compared to what it will do to the thou
sands of acres of cultivated land between
here and Warsaw, should the levee break.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 28.â The fore
cast of the Government signal service that
the Missouri and the upper Mississippi
rivers would rise to the danger point has
been well verified and new high-water
marks are being made. That stretch of
lowland country on both sides of the Mis
sissippi River, from the moutt of the Dcs
Moines to the hills below Hannibal, Mo.,
and Quincy, 111., is under water. At Quincy
the record to-night is 15.3 feet, with a
rising river. This is two feet above the
danger line. There is great suffering
among the farmers. This sea of overflow
has ruined every farm from Palmyra
north for forty miles to La Grange,
should the rise reach another foot every
railroad in the valley tfill have to be aban
doned. Porton's and Ward's islands, be
low Quincy, are inundated and the settlers
barely escaped with their lives. Tbe In
dian grave levee north of Quincy, that
protected 20.000 acres of farm land, was
still intact to-night but a little more water
would sweep it away.
* At Louisiana, Mo., the water is spread
ing over the lowlands.
At Burlington," lowa, the river is five
miles wide and has destroyed several mills
on the flats.
At Alton, 111., the rise yesterday was
very rapid. Rescue boats are busy bring
ing familiesand slock to Quincy from, the
lowlands.
ST. PAUL, Minn., March 28â Bo
hemian Flats ou the east side of the Mis
sissippi River ara half under water to
night and the residents nearest the river
have been forced to take to the hills. The
remainder of the residents will remain up
all night to watch the rise of the river.
The gauge showed that the river had
passed the ten-foot mark shortly before 10
o'clock tnis morning and since that hour
there has been a steady rise. ' The ice has
been going out all day and gorged at the
high bridge and South St. Paul.
As it is thawing very .rapidly the gorged
ice is becoming rotten and will break
away probably during the night. Lake
Peppin, the arm of the Mississippi at
Lake City, is reported still solid, but it is
expected to break up during the next
three days. AH the rivers to the north
are rising and there will be considerable
further rise. However, if there is no rain
it is not believed the water will go up
more than four feet more. ,-
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 28.â The
following special river bulletin has been
issued by tbe Weather Bureau:
The crest of tnc flood wave is still at Cairo,
which shows a stationary gauge reading five
and one-sixth feet for the past lour days.
There is great danger yet to come from the
flood in the region from Helena southward to
New Orleans.
The river will continue to rise for at least
ten days in the region from Helena southward
to Vicksburg and to rise during a longer
period from Vicksburg southward.
If no break occurs before, levees will be sub
jected to the greatest strain about April 10
In Southwestern Kansas, Western Mississippi
and in Louisiana. Should the levees break
the result will be one of the most disastrous
floods ever known.
Weather conditions now indicate additional
heavy rainfall in the Middle and Lower Mis
sissippi Valleys, which will materially inten
sify the flood conditions. ',
Those living in districts overflowed In
former years should be on the safe side and
transfer stock and movable property to
places of safety while there is yet time.
Willis L. Moore, Chief of Bureau.
MEMPHIS, Tens., March 28.â The local
Weather Bureau to-night reports that
cyclonic disturbances, central near Aus
tin. Tex., ibis afternoon are sweeping in
the direction of the Mississippi Valley
and will probably strike to-morrow after
noon, bidding fair to create havoc with
the levees.
"DALLAS, Tex., March 28â The big rains
that subsided two days ago broke loose
again last nignt and precipitated a worse
flood than before. All railroad traffic
centering at Dallas is tied up and much
damage is being done. Two bridges on
the Santa Fe south of Dallas have been
swept away and one on the Missouri, Kan
sas and Texas Bad washouts are reported
on other lines. There are rumors of a
cyclone having passed over the' country
to the southwest of Dallas this evening,
but confirmation is lacking. , 77,- t 7*s

FIERCE WINDS IN TEXAS.
Austin and V.cinity Swept by a Cyclone,
Causing Destruction of Property
and Loss ofLfe. 7
AUSTIN, Tex. March 28.â A terrific
cyclone visited this city and surrounding
country this afternoon, doing damage to
life and property. The wind came from
the southwest and blew at the rate ?of
sixty, miles an hour : for nearly twenTy
minutes, tearing down trees or /splitting j
them asunder. 7 : Several electric-light j
towers were blown down, entailing a loss
of $4000 or $5000. The Iron frames were
twisted ns though of the smallest wire
and will be entirely useless. The new
and unoccupied residence of. Bert McDon
ald was blown down, striking against
the residence of William Vinig and nar
rowly escaped killing two little children
that were in the room playing. fj'^j
The storm did much damage to the
State University and blew off the entire
roof of the adjoining dormitory, permit
ting the rain to drive full into the four
story building. Two hundred students
were in the building, many of whom fled
for their lives when the roof was carried
away. Tbe roof was carried 100 yards,
lighting on and crushing the roof of a
cottage in which four people were seated,
but none of them were even injured,
though all were entombed by falling
debris.
A church just to the north of the uni
versity bad the entire east side blown in
and was unroofed, the wind carrying the
roof a block away. The residence of Dr.
Graves, immediately north of the church,
was lifted from its foundation, twisted
completely around and set down in the
same place, so badly damaged, however,
tbat none of the doors could be opened
to permit of the escape of the lrightened
inmates.
The small town of Clarksville near this
city was swept by the wind and many
horses were killed by flying debr.s. â  The
storm was general in this district.
At Buda two persons were killed. The
storm was over in an hour and the sun
came out brightly afterward.
CORSICANA, Tex.. March 28.â News
was received hero to-night from Calvert,

then run from Mavroneri on the Gulf of
Salonica to and including Matsovo and
the Lake of Janina, the line terminating
on the south bank of the River Kalama.
Within this strip of territory the people
are nearly all Greets. It has no strategetic
importance for Turkey, and its cession
could not, or ought not, to awake into
action the Servo-Bulgarian alliance. That
Russia will assent to this adjustment,
however, is more than doubtful. When
Greece demanded in 1881 the frontier
assigned to her under the treaty, the Porte
refused and Russia backed up the refusal.
Now the chances of tbe Porte accepting
the settlement are small.
The Servo-Bulgarian pact will be finally
concluded at Belgrade early in April.
Prince Ferdinand, accompanied ny his
Prime Minister, M. Sterloff, then goes to
the Servian capital. M. Sterloff and King
Alexander's Prime Minister, M. Simitich,
have consulted the Russian Government
on the terms of the alliance which has
received approval from St. Petersburg.
Whi c tbe Austrian oflicial press make
only casual reference to an arrangement
that confirms Russian domination in the
Balkan states, the Budapest!), papers are
more outspoken.
The sum of the matter is' that for the
present Austria, though seriously appre
hensive, can .do nothing except to
strengthen her forces in Bosnia and Her
zegovinia, and this is silently being done.
During tbe past four,, week** there has
been a constant stream of men and mu
nitions into Bosnia, chiefly toward Sere
gio. Military opinion here concurs in
viewing the preparations for war now pro
ceeding against all tbo Balkan States as
not making immediate operations immi
nent on any side, even on the Greco-
Turkish frontier. Minor encounters there
may occur, but the passes in Thessaly are
still under snow, and movement of troops
in mass will be lor some weeks yet almost
impossible.
The sailing of Crown Prince Constan
tine from Athens for Volo. Thessaly,- last
evening, accompanied by the Crown
Princess, the Kaiser's sister, who will go
as far as Lirissia, is not held here a3 im
plying the hastening of an outbreak be
tween Greece and Turkey, but, on the
contrary, it is understood here that the
aim of tbe Crown Prince is to counteract
the influence of the national committees
which are working as hard as thoy can to
incite the Greeks to acts of insubordina
tion on the pars of the Greek soldiers in
making attacks upon the Turks across '.he
border, with the object of precipitating an
embroilment, whicn the powers would be
powerless to overcome^ Crown Princess
Sophie will remain a week at Larrissia, in
order to supervise the organization of the
Red Cross Society, which contemplates an
extensive programme in the event of se
r.ous hostilities.
The Frankfort Gazette says that Yon
der Goltz Pasha, the German General who
organized the present Turkish army and
some time ago severed bis relations with
the Turkish military department because
of his disgust with the way things were
going, is a candidate for the office of Gov
ernor of Crete, with good chances of suc
pess.
Regarding Crete, the military view is
that it will require 25,000 troops to effect
the so-called pacification of the islanders
if they choose to resist. . There are 30,000
well-armed Cretans in the island whose
leaders still distrust the autonomy offered
them. Further than this the Italian Gov
ernment has categorically refused to fur
nish a man beyond its -quota of 600 men
for purposes of occupation of the island :
the English and French Governments dare
not, in the lace of popular sentiment, in
crease their quotas; Germany will neither
increase the number of vessels in Cretan
waters nor send troops to Crete, and the
powers cannot agree among themselves
that Russia shall undertake the work of
occupation of the island alone. The Eu
ropean mandate to France and Italy,
which is under public, discussion, is dis
liked in both countries, and the settle
ment of Crete is still a diplomatic puzzle.

ANTICS AT BELMONT HALL
Queer Sect Whose Membsrs Wrestle With
Imaginary Spirits Which D s
iurb Them.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. March 28.â The
trial of the libel suit of Miss Josephine
Holmes, head and founder of tha queer
sect known as the Belmont Hall Society,
against a local newspaper has been the
means of letting in a flood of light upon
the unique professions of these people and
many of their queer antics at the hall. It
was disclosed in the testimony taken yes
terday that at least one deluded woman
had passed from the hall to the insane
asylum at Highlands. The witness who
supplied the merriment of the day, as well
as the sensation.*! was Mrs. Van Auken, a
former member of the society. Mrs. Van
Auken, referring to Mist Holmes, said:
I was very susceptible. She began her
teachings and I went her.way. She led; I fol
lowed. 1 firmly believed her when she told
me that she was the greatest medium of mod
ern times; that she was on earth complete
the work that Christ- lelt unfinished. Sho
commanded me to discard my ideas of spirit
ualism. I aid. She ordered me to obey her
implicitly. 1 did. so. She was at my house
from May until August and was nearly always
under control of some unseen spiritualistic
power. "J J'.\::-
Sometimes she would hammer the devils out
of her power with her fists. 1 vividly recall
my own experience in this particular. She
pounced upon me and pounded me hard, not
being particular where the blows landed.
Oh, 1 believed in ail that nonsense then, but
I don't now. Why I once saw Miss Holmes
make a fistic attack upon John Griddell, a
roomer at the house, and thump him until she
thought all the devils oi which he was iu
feste 1 had taken flight.
The witness vividly described how the
medium bad once found herself under the
control of a snake.' She threw herself
upon tbe floor, but upon her back, con
trary to the habit of snakes. She
squirmed and crawled about the room for
awhile and then darted under a couch
upon which was stretched a fellow
medium. Miss Lundgren. Tbe latter was
possessed of , a wild beast, and between
snake and beast the witness was fright
ened within an inch of her life.
Finally the pair escaped from the con
trol of the snake and beast spirits and ex
plained themselves. Their real spirits,"
they told Mrs. Van Auken, had been off
on an excursion to Africa and way points,
leaving their uninhabited bodies behind.
On. their return tbey found their recently
vacated physical systems in possession of
tbe claim-jumpers sent by the devil for
tbeir vexation, and bad a hard tussle to
oust them.

REVOLT OF CHINESE SOLDIERS.
Mutiny Results From the Famine in Kw.n-j
Tungâ Man- Eating Tigers Rampant
Near Foo Chow.
TACOMA, Wash., March 28â The North
ern Pacific steamer Braema brings news
of an insurrection at Kacchou, Kwang
Tung province, China. During the famine
there many sufferers were compelled to
sell their children _in order to save their
lives. Amonc the purchasers was the sec
retaty of the District Magistrate at Mou
niinghsien. Ho bought two girls, aged 10
and 12 years. 7, As ho was taking them' to
the passenger-boat for transport to Can
ton, he was set upon by soldiers and ar
rested for kidnaping. He appealed to
the magistrate, with the result that his
captors were in turn made captive, bam
hooed and finally driven out of the Yamen.
Tlie soldiers complained :to their com
manding officer, who also took umbrage
nnd allowed his men to return * to the
Yamen and inflict revenge on the unlucky
magistrate; Alter beating him the sol
diers dragged him to the temple of Mars,
and while seme made him kneel down,
others plucked out his hair and mustache
by the roots. The regiment then went into
revolt and the troopers bave since been
mutineers. â¢ //â '
Great alarm prevails throughout the
reg on of Sam-Sah Bay, near Foo Chow,
where the rural population is large, on
account of the ferocious tigers whicn tbe
hard winter has driven down from the
mountains. First docs and pigs began
disappearing with marvelous rapidity,
causing the natives to lock all their stock
in buildings. Left without means of sub
sistence the hungry beasts gradually be
came bolder, and have since been attack
ing laborers in the forest and even people
in their dooryards. A half-dozen natives
aro known to have been devoured.
A Foo Chow paper states that two tigers
made a noise about a house which sounded

SAUSALITO FIRE PROTECTION.
Committee to Be Appointed to Purchase
an Engine and Establish an

SAUSALITO, Cal., March 28.â The
mass-meeting of citizens, called for tbe
purpose of devising ways and means for
properly equipping a tire _ department in
Sausaiito, has been postponed until
Wednesday evening on account of .the
storm. The meeting was to bave been
held last night at the town hall.
J. T. Harmesis tbe leader in the move
ment .and he has carefully-Considered
various means of affording Sausaiito pro
tection from fire and has approved of one
method which be will present at Wednes
day's meeting. He has learned that he
can purchase an old-fashioned, â¢ hand
power fire engine, such as the old volun
teers used, for 300. This, with 1000 feet
of suction hose and as mucb more fire
hose, will be able to throw a large and
steady stream. * : ~~y
In order to obtain a water supply a
basin must be built in the bay so that it
will be filled by the tides, tints establish
ing a perpetual reservoir. The suction
hose will be run from, the engine to the
basin, and any number of men, from six
to twenty," can work the engine. Afire
alarm system is to be established on the
waterfront. i This, Mr. Harmes figures,
wiil cost $250. He has gone over the fig
ures and finds that a large amount bas
been injudiciously, 'spent in Sausaiito for
fire apparatus and only 250 feet of * hose
and a hosocart is left. Much of the money
has been spent in surveys.

GREATEST OF ALL

Rapid-Firing Gun Invented

Attached to. the Weapon Are Two
Magpzines Carrying a Hundred
Cartridges.
VANCOUVER BARRACKS, Wash.,
March 28.â William Harle, a private of
Company 11, Fourteenth Infantry, is the
inventor of a magazine gun which is be
lieved by army officers and others familiar
with the mechanism of firearms to be the
best arm yet invented.
Private Harle' s new gun is so arranged
that two ' magazines may be attached in
stead of one and may be made to contain
from one to 100 cartridges, the capacity of
the magazine being limited only by the
size the gun and the caliber of the pro
jectile used. The magazine ie placed
alongside of the chamber and may be
extended back to the butt of the gun
stock or made to run parallel with the
barrel iuto the stock. The cartridges are
placed in a single perpendicular layer in
the magazine, the bullet pointing down
ward, and are pressed into firing position
by a press-lock, which also ejects' tbe
spent shells by a simple movement. 77
--; It is beieved Hade's gun will be found
superior to any now in use for simplicity
of construction and lor rapid firing. The
weapon is a smooth-bore and will carry a
grooved or self-revolving bullet, of which,
also, be is the inventor. He claims his
self-revolving bullet is so constructed that
when fired from his smooth-bore gun it
will be given a rotary motion by contact
; with the air of much greater velocity than
that given to a bullet fired from a rifled
barrel. He also says that his smooth-bore
gun will offer less resistance to the bullet
than the rifled barrel, and therefore that
his gun will have an advantage in carry
ing-power over the latest improved rifle.
Another j important advantage which
Private Harle claims for his magazine is
that it is absolutely impossible for cart
ridges to be exploded while in the maga
zine, no matter how great a shock may he
given to the gun containing them. _ He
lias invented two breech-blocks differing
in principle and action, either of which
may be used in connection with his new
gun, one being arranged to work by use of
a lever sin_ilaj* to that of the Winchester
rifle and the other by a sort of handle
placed underneath the muzzle. The in
ventor claims both to be differeut in
mechanism from any now in use, and that
they will be much quicker and safer in
action. " . 7 7.77
VISITS THE ST. ELMO MINE.

accompanied by Jobn C. Daven
port, a mining man of wide experience
from Spokane, Wash., and W. H. Daven
port, his nephew, who represents the
Union Pacific road in Los Angeles, has
just returned from Randsburg. The three
were driven over from Kramer by W. N.
Crandall in a special coach, and stopped
at the St. E mo mine to examine that
property. Mr. Smith's object in visiting
the place is, as he expressed it in speaKing
to D. M. Pyle of the St. Elmo mine:
"If they have a good mining camp, and
that's what I went to see, I am going to
help get a railroad in there." jjfi
Mr. Davenport is a thorough miner, and
upon his judgment Mr. Smith will act.
The St. E-mo mine was thoroughly ex
amined, Mr. Davenport going through it
careiully. - At the time of their arrival
there the St. E.mo people were hoisting
out ore in which free gold was visible in
nearly every .piece, and some of tbe
chunks weighed thirty or forty pounds.
M. J. Blaisdell of this city and Captain
Thoroes of the Sc. Elmo Hotel, two of the
directors of the St. Elmo- Mining Com
pany, had driven out from Randsburg! in
the morning and met Mr. Smith and party
at the mine and showed them through

on bis recommendation a small smelter
has been ordered and a thorough test wilt
be made as soon as the machinery arrives.
Several leading <itizens are interested
in the venture. They have secured an
option on a tract :of 3700 acres, beneath
which the vein is located. There is plenty
of wood and water close by, ana the
amount of ore appears to be unlimited,
containing 22 per cent copper. The dis

AUBURN, Cal., March 28.â clad
news reached here about 9 o'clock of tbe
rescue of the two miners, Scott Wilson
and George Simpson, who were entombed
in the Dardanelles drift mine tunnel, near
Forest Hill. The # men were completely
exhausted, and tell a story of an experi
ence horrible in ihe extreme. Tbey had
been underground for nearly seventy
hours and with nothing to eat.
Wilson is a married man and resides a
short distance from the mine. When he
failed to return to his evening meal on
Friday hi? aged father went to learn the
cause. Upon reaching the mine he found
the men's luncheon untouched on the
outside. Further examination revealed a
cave-in in the chute which opens into the
.nain tunnel.
Assistance was summoned from Forest
Hill. A large number of miners re
sponded and short drifts were begun. The
greatest anxiety prevailed, as the unfor
tunates might have been caught and
crushed to death by, the caving earth or
smothered, or they might even have been
drowned, as the outlet for the escaping
water had been closed. .
Atone time yesterday the debris was
nearly cleared away when a second cave
rn followed. . Not until this afternoon did
those outside have any hopes of ever find
ing those In the tunnel alive. Water began
to flow from the air shaft, and then it was
known that the imprisoned men bad
broken the pipe, in order; to keep from
drowning. Later the sound of picks could
be beard issuing from the inside. En
couraged by these signs of life, the rescuers
redoubled . their effort*-, and after dark
this evening succeeded in digging throueh
to the half- famished ana almost crazed
miners. ' - '
Now there is great rejoicing at the Hill

PROSPERITY OF
SALINAS CITY
One of the. Choicest Garden
Spots in the
State.
Progress Made by Leading Mer
chants and Others During
Recent Years.
Many New Business Blocks and
Palatial Dwellings Atom
the City.
BALINAS, Cal., March 28.â Salinas, the
county seat of Monterey County, has
brighter prospects to-day than any town
of similar size in California. â 
Inland towns must depend for their
future aud prosperity on the volume of
trade which they naturally command,
and this trade is circumscribed in all in
stances by natural boundaries, as, for
example, the proximity of large towns,
HON. JESSE D. CARR.
want of sufficient transportation, want of
competition in railroads or navigation,
the quantity of fertile lands, health, alti
tude and so forth. In all of the foregoing
Salinas will bear the closest and most
minute investigation by prospective set
tlers.
The industries of Salinas and environs
are almost as varied as the resources of
our State. Wool, wine, livestock, fruit of
all kinds, lumber, stone, marble, granite,
salt, sulphur, quicksilver, coal, natural
gas, iron and coal oil are among the in
dustries now receiving attention, as well
as one of the greatest of all industries in
the country, the raising of sugar beets.
Lying west and east of Salinas are some
exceedingly fertile valleys and foothills,
and which surpass in productiveness and
quality many famous valleys of the State.
Salinas is the halfway house of the
Salinas valley. In the awakening 01
the latent industries of the great South
she is the first to move forward. Hereto
fore content with a modicum of pros
perity, while leading all her rivals, she
now rises to the grandeur and importance
of the occasion. From an uninhabited
grain field thirty years ago the close of
1890 found her with a population of about
20CO. Costly brick blocks, stone sidewalks,
macadamized streets, magnificent school
buildings and courthouse, imposing
churches and palatial dwellings, all attest
to tbe thrift and prosperity of the valley.
The city is lighted by electricity and gas.
The growth of the city is steady and of
a permanent and architectural character,
excelled nowhere in the interior.
The Salinas Valley bursts upon the vis
ion ol the weary traveler, after crossing
the arid plains of Southern California, as a
land of wonder and beauty, and the
problem presents itself, why is nature so
partial in the distribution of her gifts?
Not many towns in this or any other State
can truthfully claim the natural advanta
ges that Salinas and its environs can.
More so perhaps than may other places
in the valley, Salinas enjoys a climate as
serene as a dream of luxury; serene in
that it is robbed of all severity â balmy,
bright and tranquil as a summer's sea.
The domain of winter "is* met on the
mountain slopes, where its advance is
stayed by the greetings of- perpetual sum
mer. Above the hoary garments of the
frost king shroud the monarchs and. car
pet with its icy breath peak and plateau,
cove and canyon. But beneath lies the
pretty town of Salinas in the smiling val
ley of the Sacramento, carpeted with em
erald and bespangled with flowers. Here
wherever the eye is directed a new charm
appears, a new delight is present, and the
soft air, laden with fragrant odors, with a
mere suggestion of the sea, is as a balm to
the lungs.** - - ... ...
There is no more beautiful landscape in
all the country than this garden spot,
where the eye reaches out over thousands
of broad acres of luxuriant orchards and
vineyards, and the olive with its silvery
sheen, the magnolia with its waxen leaves,
the cypress with, its burden of verdure,
the stately palm, the occasional sturdy
oak, the intervals of waving grain, each a
delight in itself, and all adding their
shades of color under a cloudless sky,
save perchance a few white fleeces steal
ing way tot hide in some quiet nook in
the mountain's that rise majestically in
their garb of many shades of green, con
tributing greater charms and magnificent
relief to tne landscape.
It is a generally admitted fact that hor
ticulture is the coming industry of Cali
fornia. The State has successively passed
through the states of gold mining, stock
raising and agriculture, and is now in the
dawn of a stilt brighter era, that of horti
culture. Monterey County, being behind
many other localities of the State in de
velopment, is not so far . advanced in the
fruit industry. * The reader, will , have in
ferred ere this that grain growing has not
reached the zenith of its glory, and it is
unreasonable to . expect that â _.. Monterey
County will be covered with orchards and
vineyards for several years" to come. --'But
enough has been done to demonstrate the
practicability of the fruit ' business, and
the adaptability of nearly all kinds of de-
cidnous fruits to the soil and climate of
this county. .' ' ; -77*"7
Much ot the valley land is unexcelled
for pears and apples, while the mesa land,
on the west side of the Salinas Valley es
pecially, is particularly well adapted to
vines and many varieties of pitted fruits.
Citrus fruits on- this Bide ot the valley
have been successfully crown. Olive tree;*
nourish with all the vigor they possess on
the Mediterranean coast, and an orchard
of almonds has been very profitable to its
owner. All kinds of small fruits do well.
There is in the Salinas Valley some of
the finest vegetable land in the world,
but owing to its distance from the com
mercial center of the State not much has
been done in this line, except in beans and
potatoes. Vegetables of all kinds lor home
consumption are raised.
But the coming agricultural industry is
raising sugar beets. . y j
Among the private residences there are
no grand piles of masonry and brown
stone fronts, but there are some of the
prettiest cottages, surrounded by green
lawns, embowered by Mowers and shaded
with evergreens and "rara tropical plants
that ever wakened the dreaai of a poet.
But then California is a land of sunshine,
of flowers whose commingled fragrance
fills the air with sweetest perfume; of rare
plants which tbrive nowhere else except
in tbe tropics and here, and beautiful
homes ars the rule and by no means the
exception. The city of Salinas is provided
with public schools unexcelled by any la
the State. There are eii*nt church organ
izations, viz.: United Presbyterian. Pres
byterian. M. E. Church, Baptist, M. E.
Church bouth, Lutheran, Episcopal and
Catholic. The societies of a lraternal and
social character are too numerous to men
tion. Among the most prominent orden
the F. and A. M., I. 0. 0. F., A. O. U. W.
and tbe Native Sons of the Golden West
have flourishing organizations. The peo
ple are broad, liberal, generous, honor
able and cultivated.
F. H. Lang of Salinas City, one of the
oldest citizens in the county of Monterey
and probably one of the best judges of
the peculiarity of tho land in Monterey
County, by reason of his extensive land
interests, had the following to say in a
recent interview:
"The many attractive features of Cali
fornia have been so well and widely ad
vertised that it is superfluous to preface a
description of Monterey County with any
general remarks about t. c State. It is the
.special province of this work to tell of the
varied resources, advantages and possibil
ities of one of earth's most favored spots
and not to babble about 'glorious climate,'
'Italian skies,' and 'the sweet perfume in
a wealth of b.'oom.' These attributes be
long to most of California. But compara
tively cheap land, rich, and adapted to
almost everything that grows, particularly
promising for horticulture, which consti
tutes the great future industry of Califor
nia; immense areas of land, capable of
supporting 100 families where now but
one resides, soon to be divided into small
tracts and sold these are features not so
general as 'glorious climate, etc' But
they are the distinctive characteristics of
Monterey County."
AN EXPERIENCED AND LEARNED ATTORNEY.
One of the most prominent and widely
I known of the legal fraternity in California
! is the Hon. S. F. Geil of Salinas City. For
i twenty years has this gentleman prac
j ticed law in Monterey County, during
I which time he has figured on either side
of most all the law cases of any import
[ ance that have been tried in the courts of
Monterey County or the surrounding ter
ritory.
He enjoys at the present time one of the
largest practices in the State. While Mr.
Gens civil practice is most lucrative, he
bears the distinction of being one of the
must able criminal lawyers of modern
times.
During his professional career Mr. Geil
has defended ho less than thirty-six crim
inal^ charged with murder, only two of
whom have been convicted, and he
has during the same time defended and
secured the acquittal of over 100 persons
charged with felonies of less gravity.
Mr. Geil at one time served as District
Attorney of Monterey County, but of re
cent years has strenuously declined tbe
nomination of bis party to any public of
fice, and devotes his time and attention
solely to the interests of his many clients.
"I think," said Mr. Geil, "that this un
dertaking of Claus Spreckels to place in
(hi*- city a sugar refinery of such mam
moth proportions is one of the grandest
enterprises that the county could wish
for, and on its completion we can safely
expect great business prospects for this
section of the State." /-j/j
â¢ A BEAUTIFUL VETERINARY HOSPITAL.
i Salinas, though small at present in com
parison with - many jotLer towns in this
State, can boast of one of the finest veter
inary hospitals in California. Dr. G. F.
Faulkner, a skilled surgeon and dentist,
who bears renowned distinction in his
profession throughout the country, has
settled in Monterey' County, with head
quarters in Salinas City, and is there offer
ing his skilled services in all the branches
of veterinary surgery that the researches
of science have revealed, to modern times.
The magnificent and extensive hospital
for animals is fitted up most completely
with all the latest appliances, and is,
indeed, as fine a place in many ways, and
far surpassing in others, establishments
of a similar character any* here in the
United States. Although there are two
other practicing veterinary surgeons in the
town, Dr. Faulkner is receiving the mo

THE POPULAR ASSISTANT ; COUNTY . SURVEYOR.
Among the more prominent citizens of
Monterey County who has served the pub
lic of tue territory in - many important
positions of responsibility and trust is M.
R. Merritt of Salinas. , ~
Mr. Merritt, who is at present associated
with the well-known attorney, W. S.
White, under the firm name of Merritt &
White, is conducting probably the largest
abstract and searchers of records bureau
in California. He is also cuief deputy
Assessor of the county.
This gentleman was born and raised in
Monterey County. His father was Josiah
Merrttt, who had the honor of filling with
eminent ability the first judgeship of
Monterey. By reason of Mr* Merritt's long
residence in this section of the State, and
bis thorough acquaintance with landed
interest, it has made him particularly com
petent to pass upon the titles of land
throughout the territory in question.
During the past fourteen years there is
not a single tract that have been subdi
vided and sold in the enure county of
Monterey that Mr. Merritt has not made
the search of and completed the abstract
for such property.
At the last Presidential election he was
honored with the position of Presidential
elector from Monterey County, bince the
death of ttie well-known land attorney,
W. M. 11. Parker, lt is generally conceded
that Mr. Merritt is the most competent
searcher in the county to fill the same im
portant position.
SPORTING GOODS AND HARDWARE.
Salinas City is the proud possessor of
the largest general merchandise and
sporting goods houses of any county in
the State. ; 7.^7*77 :
The establishment in question is that of
the Wahrlich-Cornett Company, which
concern occupies one of the most exten
sive premises in the town, and whose
stock is made up of a most complete va
riety of general merchandise and agricul
tural implements, including the special
agency of several makes of buggies and
wagons, harvesters, reapers, mowers, bi
cycles and sporting goods. Their im
mense stock would do credit to a metro
politan establishment.
. AN ENTERPRISING YOUNG MAN.
W. M. \anderhurst, a young man ot
much prominence in Salinas, conducts
one of the largest furniture and carpet
establishments in Salinas, as well as one
of the most complete and modern under
taking embalming parlors in all the
country.
Most of the furniture and carpet stock
of this firm is purchased direct from the
large factories of the East. In the l<ne of
household furnishing articles everything
that might be wished for can be found at
this establishment, as good in quality and
cheaper in many instances tnan in the
stores of more pretentious cities.
In all the details of the undertaking
business Mr. Vanderburst and his corps of
assistants are most proficient. . -Kj
AN INFLUENTIAL CITIZEN.
The foremost of Monterey County's
citizens, whose success in life has been
marked with adventure, coupled with
vicissitudes which would have hopelessly
wrecked the average mortal, and one who
has been finally crowned with success
which has become famous throughout the
country, which is the just reward of hon
"-*â *-*â -, industry and perseverance, is the
Hon. Jesse D. Carr.
Mr. Carr was born in Sumner County,
Tennessee, in 1814, and although now S3
years of age he is nevertheless more active
and energetic than the majority of young
men of the present date ot loss than half
his years.
Tue gentleman has always been one of
the most progressive citizens of Monterey
County, always readily lending his aid
and his vast riches to any of the enter
prises that might further the interests of
that section. He is one of the largest
land-owners in California. To him is due
the organizing of the Salinas Bank, and
for more than fifteen years he acted as its
president. ) ... â 
Many of the more influential and promi
nent citizens of Monterey County, who are
depositors of the Salinas Bank, huva
expressed themselves since an election of
bank officers two years ago, as being
greatly averse to the working of the officers
of the bank in question, who, unappreciat
ing the valuable services of Mr. Carr as
president of the institution, failed to re
elect him, in the capacity which he so ably
managed for nearly two decades. Mr. Carr
is not only a conspicuous man in this State,
but is well known all over the Pacific
Coast, and has been intimately acquainted
with every administration at Washington
since the incumbency of President Taylor.
He is a man with considerable influence
at the National Capital.' 7,7
DRIFTED SNOW FLOUR.
One of the most important and exten
sive industries in this State is the manu
The Central Milling Company at Salinas, Where the Famous
Drifted Snow Flour Is Manufactured*
factureof flour. Sltuateu at Salinas City
is the S perry Flour Company, one of the
largest mills of its sort in this country.
At this establishment there is manufac
tured an article which every housewife on
this continent is well and favorably ac
quainted with by reason of its superiority
over all other brands and that is the
Drifted Snow Flour.
The capacity of this enterprise is the
manufacturing of 600 barrels a day, equal
in other words to the grinding of 25.0C0
tons of wheat a year. 77;..7;7 7777*
* The many features of superiority in the
Driited Snow Flour over any other kind
are too well known- to require extended
commendation. It has become a recog
nized fact that the material is far in ad
vance of any other make of flour and that
it will not be many years before the
"Drifted Snow" will so far have gained
precedence over all others by reason of its
superiority that it will be the one brand
in use to the exclusion of almost all others.
Mr. W. D. Black, a director of the
company in question, is the manager of
the association's business throughout the
southern portion of 'the State, with his
headquarters in Salinas City.
"Our obj^ci," said Mr. Black, in a recent
interview, "in establishing the principal
branch of our agency at Salinas is because
it is throughout the Salinas Valley that
the finest quality of whea_t in the country
is raised. Â'. ."77'.7
"ln the manufacturing, therefore, of
what bas been generally recognized to be
the nnest flour that is produced in the
country : it . was necessary for us to locate
our works where the finest cereals could
be produced, and this we claim is in the
Salinas Valley." J J * ' 7 7 7 â 'â¢â¢"â¢â¢.
A PROSPEROUS RANCHER., :.
In the Salinas Valley, which has become
famous throughout the country lor its
great fertility of soil and the regularity of
its seasons, one of . the largest and most
prosperous farmers and who stands one of
the foremost to-day. among | the successful
tillers of the soil of California is Duncan
McKinnon of Salinas city; Eleven hun
dred acres of land, some, of the most pro
lific in the valley, situated on one of the
finest roads leading out of Salinas, is the
ranch of Mr. McKinnon, and on which he
has made a fortune in a few years. It is
rumored that he will shortly offer his
place for sale and retire from business.
WHERE CIGARS ARE MANUFACTURED.
J Not many towns in this or in any other
State of the size of Salinas can boast of an
establishment for the manufacture of
cigars. Since the Cuban troubles have be
gun, however, and good tobacco has be
come scarce this; place has gained more
prominence than heretofore, not alone in
Monterey County, 1 but all over the State,
by reason of the excellence of workman
ship and the superior quality of the Ha
vana tobacco used in' tnese cigars, which
are all white labor and hand made goods.
S. Hauser, the popular young proprietor
of ibis up-to-date manufactory, is one of
the low who has an immense quantity of
Havana tobacco in stock.
One of the most prominent citizens of
the Salinas Valley and one to whom the
county of Monterey is greatly indebted
for hie indefatigable enterprise and zeal
in the Interests of that section 13 J. B.
lverson. Until recently Mr. Iverson was
engaged actively in business in Salinas
under the firm , of Iverson Bros. He re
tired, however, from the act. Ye manage
ment of this establishment a tew years
ago and has since tuen been attending to
his individual interests throughout Mon
terey Couniy, where he is interested ex
tensively in real property.
Mr. lverson owns some of the finest
and most productive land in the State,
among it being several large holdings
in and around Salinas City, much of
which property he has recently put oa the
market for sale. In speaking of the
prospects of Salinas on the comple
tion of the sugar factory of that city Mr.
Iverson had much of encouragement to
say. He thinks that in the course of the
next decade Salinas City should grow to
be one of the largest and most nourish
ing towns in Caliiornia.
"The completion of this grand enter
prise in our midst," said he, "will prove
to be a great thing for this section, but it
should he borne in mind by the masses
that while Salinas now offers some rare
inducements to capital for investment it
has not yet begun its . extensive manu
facturing and producing enterprises, and
therefore is not yet offering inducements
to the great army of mechanics arid labor
ers at the present time in prospects of
what is to come. ;.. J
â¢*I think that the proposed electric road
from Salinas to the new beet-sugar, fac
tory will be built by Salinas property
owners, and, in short, I am saiistied |in
saying that Salinas Valley is at present
on the eve of an era of great nrospenty."
A BIG BEET-RAISER.
James Bard in of Salinas City, who has
up to the present time been tne largest
sugar-beet raiser in Monterey County,
has met with a phenomenal success in his
beet-raising, amassing thereby an im
mense fortune in but a few years. Mr.
Bardin owns 500 acres of land about three
miles from Salinas, near Blanco, and rents
from S'JO to 600 acres more, the greater
part of which is planted out to beets this
year. He is an experienced and compe
tent farmer, whose judgment regarding
beet-raising as well as ail other branches
of agriculture and horticulture is always j
being sought for. At a recent pubic j
meeting of farmers in Salinas City Mr.
Bardin delivered quite a lengthy and able
speech on his experience in beet-raising,
copies of which have been circulated
broadcast throughout the country as an j
illustration of the profits there is in this
particular line in Monterey County.
A PROMINENT CITIZEN.
The County Surveyor of Monterey
County, Lou G. Hare, a gentleman of
great learning and ability in his pro es
sion, is among the enterprising and ener
getic citizen* of the Salinas Valley who
have lent much by their untiring efforts
* and eminent ability to place the county of
Monterey in the position that it occupies
to-day as one of the foremost sections of
our State, ln connection with Mr. Hare's
official duties to his county as Surveyor he
has inaugurated an extensive department
in his office for the compiling of surveys,
the drafting of mans and the subdivision
and laying out of tracts.
BERGES AND GARRISSERE.
One of the finest business blocks in Mon
terey County and without doubt the larg
est wholesale liquor establishment south
of (San Francisco is that of Berires & Gar
rissere of Salinas City. The arrangement
and expense of the big wine cellar which
is stocked with only the finest brands of
wines and liquors, as well as the other
arrangements of the interior of the large
building of this firm make it an equal of
any establishment of the kind iv Cali
fornia.
LEADING HOTELS OF SALINAS.
The Jeffrie House of Salinas City is
known all over the coast as one of the
leading and best kept bouses in tin-west. F.
W. Schroder is a pioneer of Monterey
County and is a thorough hotel man.-
Burke & Hawkins, the well-known
sporting goods and , hardware dealers, al
though comparatively a new firm in Mon
terey County is nevertheless doing one of
the largest sporting goods and hardware
business in Salinas City, where they are
located..'. , >{i J: ; ; jj-Jj-J/J-.y.-
This house has the reputation of being
thoroughly reliable and honest, and it is
to this tact as well as to the superiority of
the line of goods they deal in that they
may attribute their success. At their
bookstore on Main street is also the agency
of The Ca.il.
THE VANDEBHCBST-SANBORN COMPANY. J
Probably , the most flourishing estab- !
lishment in Monterey County is that of
the* Vanderhurst-Sanborn Company of j
Salinas and King ; cities. > The reputation
of this establishment, is well and favor
ably known throughout the entire State
and is one of 'those lauding enterprises of
our community that Salinas and Monterey
county can w-li feel proud to possess.
J, In : the extent of the workings of this
great concern it might be stated that few
other firms in this State carry such a long
and .varied line of goods. Dry goods,
fancy goods, â  groceries . and provisions, as
well as stoves, hardware, crockery, lum
ber, boots and shoes, doors, windows,
oils and paints represent only in part the
extent of tne concern. 7 //â :â â  , .
j % To William Vanderhurst, L. Sanborn
and Dr. Charles Ford is due the organiza
tion of the establishment a little less than
thirty years I. ago, and which ; haa !. been
growing continuously since the- inauj-ura
tion of the firm until it has now reached
. its mammoth proportions and is an evi
dence of tbe fact that the beautiful valley
of Salinas is one of the most prolific sec
tions of the State, since it has called to that
section for tbe ', support , of its many and
prosperous citizens one of the ; largest es
tablishments of its sort in the country.

SALINAS, . Cal., March 28.â an in
formal meeting of prominent business
men last evening the proposition to con
struct an electric road between Salinas"
and Claus Spreckels' new beet-sugar fac
tory was earnestly discussed, and all were
unanimous in the opinion that the road
should be built, and that if Salinas City
was to share in the great benefits derived

â¢ â  7-38808SOWING THE GOOD SEED
The Rev. Dr. W. D. Williams, until re- j
cently pastor of Plymouth church, j
preached yesterday morning in St. John's [
Presbyterian Church a "Sermon for the
Season." He said:
"All Christian effort is a kind of sowing.
Everywhere be goes he scatters the seeds i
of happiness and bliss. Life is springtime ;
and the gathering years are . lengthening )
days calling to constant endeavors. The !
husbandman goeth forth weeping; he re- j
turneth rejoicing. His joy is real and !
deep. And yet his harvest in its fullness I
is in the future. Baffled to-day he sue- i
ceeds to-morrow. It was a maxim of old !
Rome never to despair of the republic. It
should be ours never to despair of man
kind. For as the oak is contained in the
acorn and the fruit is wrapped up in the
blossom so the seed-truth, which sball in
spire and redeem this world, is a handful j
of corn upon the top of the mountains;
the fruit thereof shall spake as Lebanon.
"Some tbink they may escape the laws 'â 
of sowing and reaping. â¢ -icon thought
he could outwit eternal justice and it
swept him away witn a furious blast, as if
he were only a s.raw upon its path. Fill
life with goodness. Let there be the daily
ministry of love. Then will joy come. If
we sow foolishly and sinfully we make
shipwrecks of our noblest natures and lose
the wealth of life. Why use the power of
a king to feed the passions of a slave?" ,
The Shortest Verse
In the Bible.
Loo Hoo Nam Art spoke at 911 Stockton
street yesterday morning from the text,
St. John xi:33, "Jesus wept." He said:
"This is the shortest verse in the Bible
and a most beautiful one. Many people
deprived of earthly friends despair be
cause they know not the heavenly sym
pathizer. 'It would be a great comfort to
such people to know that they have a
sympathetic Savior, who wept with those
that wept. ,' 7;7-
"I would draw your attention to four
points in this text. First, Christ suffer
ing, his scourging, his crown of thorns
and his crucifixion. Then it was that
while atoning for the sins of the world he
sweat great drops of Mood, and wlien our
hearts are tiled with the bitterness of
sorrow and disappointment we can the
better appreciate the meaning of the text.
"Seconal*/, Christ's sympathy, his love
for Lazarus and nis sisters and his sym
pathy for all of us are equally profound.
"Thirdly, Christ's weeping for us is a
pledge of the same sympathy.
"Fourthly, Christ is our example of sym
pathy for otbers. If we are true followers
of Christ we are his imitators, and if we
show ourselves indifferent to the sorrow
and suffering around us we are unworthy
to be called his disciples. We as Chris
tians of tbis community have much to
mourn for. There atemany of our unfor
tunate countrymen who are sold into
a slavery worse than death. Gamblers,
'tongs/ or so-called societies, exercise a
rule of terror in our beloved Chinatown.
Though we are almost powerless to
remedy these eviis, yet we should try our
utmost todo what we can to save our
countrymen.
"We cannot be happy when we see the
sin, misery and danger which so thictly
surround us. To sit at our table and feast
ourselves with our friend is a very pleas
ant thing, but when we see a large and
sharp knife hang over our friend's head
by a small thread we cannot ieei consort
able, above all when our friend is all un
conscious of the danger which hangs over
bim." _
"Is Five Any
Greater Than Ten?"
Rev. Frank D. Ford of the Christian
Church preached yesterday morning on
the subject, "Is Five More Than Ten?"
Hi-- text was from Matthew xxiii:2324;
"Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites, for ye tithe the mint and
anise and cummin, and have left undone
the weightier matters of the law, judg
ment and mercy and faith; but these ye
ought to have done, and not to have left
the other undqne. Ye blind guides which
strain out the gnat and swallow the
camel."
He said in part: "In somethings, espe
cially rehgioa, most people have the wo
fully nnmathematical habit of esteeming
the part as greater than the whole. They
are so absorbed in detail that they lose
the entire thought of completion, as a
builder, having a palace to build, spends
his life in erecting and embellishing one
column.
"The fault is greater in their eyes than
a character whose entire design is a thing
of beauty. They forget that 'the liie is
more than food and the body is more than
raiment,' and they place the mote that is
in their neighbor's character so near and
the beam of their own so far tbat the for
mer entirely obscures the latter.
"We have a tendency to weigh essen
tials as far greater than an entire life of
consecration; one fault of doctrine, one
omission in faith, repentance, confession,
baptism, continuing faithful as greater
than a life of self-sacrificing Christianity.
"We are not 'a sum,' we 'are,' and while
every five should have its full value, no
five is greater than all which* is to be
found in Christ."
The Allegory of
Hagar and Sarah.
J. M. Buehler, parlor of St. Paul's
Lutheran Church, spoke yesterday on a
text from Galatians, iv:2l-3L
In his introductory remarks the pastor
referred to the amazing subject, for the
special consideration of which this pres
ent season of the church yearâ Lent
set apart, the sufferings and death of the
Redeemer. This subject was declared to
be the very essence of the gospel, as the
glad tidings of redemption.
The personal interest in this gospel of
redemption was urged as of paramount
interest to every individual. â 
The pastor's subject was: The allegory
of Hagar and Sarah as a most instructive
illustration of man's relation to God un
der the law and under the gospel. Atten
tion was called first to the universal ap
plication of the subject to all men. they
all being of necessity either under the law
or under the gospel second to the spirit of
antagonism of the children of the law
against the children of the gospel;, third,
to the consequences resulting respectively
from the two opposing positions, God's
judeement being the rejection of those
that are unrier tbe law, as having failed to
comply with its requirements and accept
ance of those that are under the gospel,
as such that have by. faith appropriated
the promise, realized in our redemption
through Christ. '-
',':â¢ In conclusion the pastor urged his hear
ers to consider their own standing in this
matter, to . beware of remaining i children
of bondage under the law, as it will* be
impossible for any sinful being to be justi
fied and saved by that law which must
condemn the sinner.; and to accept
heartily and joyfully the abundant grace
freely offered in tue gospel as their only
hope and help. - l -7 77
The Two Great
Commandments.
Rev. J. S. David of the Swedenborg
Mission Society began his discourse at
Washington Hall yesterday by reading
article 3 of the constitution of the society,
which reads: "This society ho.ds that the
two great commandments of the law. en-
â¢ join love for the Lord and love of the
neighbor, are the essentials of all genuine
religion. 'On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.'
(Matt., xxii. 40.) Hence also it holds that
differences ot opinion in ma, ters of doc
trine snonld not be made a cause of schism
or separation so long as the two .great es
sentials are acknowledged and made the
â basis of action."
After describing Zechariab's . vision of
the two olive trees as the symbols of the
two loves love for God and love for man
he continued:
"The love of. God is more than the love
of any mental image of him; it is the
love of goodness and truth, of purity, jus
tice, harmony and use; for of these God
is the essence and origin. And yet the
love of God is more man this, for God is
more than a principle. An abstract prin
ciple cannot love and think; God is love
and wisdom; he is infinite consciousness,
infinite 'Man. We may love honesty, but
honesty, as an abstraction, cannot love us.
God loves us and that love gives us power
to love him, and thus our union with him
is reciprocal. The love of the neighbor is
one with this. It is the love of the good
and the true in him, and the desire to aid
in their development. It is the love of
serving the individual and the community
from the unselfish love of use. He who
willingly lives an idle life; he who lives
LOO HOO NAM ART.
I by speculating without producing;, he
' who lives on the labors of others and
I not on the labor of his own brain or
i muscle, cannot develop the love of bis
| neighbor, and therefore cannot love God.
i He is a spiritual dwarf, unfit for the society
of angels or men."
The Literature of
the New Testament.
The ihird in the series of the Rev. Wil- |
I liam Rader's sermons on "The Literature
j of the New Testament" was delivered yes
' terday. He said in part:
"The four gospels were written by a
business man. a missionary, a doctor and
a poet-preacher. They are the four biog
raphies or memoirs of Christ, written from
different points of view and each inde
pendent of the other. Matthew's gospel
was composed of an original manuscript
called 'The Oracles, written in Hebrew;
Murk's from the sayings of Peter, of whom
he was the interpreter; Luke's from the
words of Paul, and John's from his own
knowledge of Jesus. John's gospel is
original with him and a continuous nar
rative. The other gospels are called sy
noptic.
"These biographies do not agree in every
particular, In the main particulars tney
are in substantial agreement, but the
claim for verbal inspiration must be sur
rendered when we face the discrepancies
of these accounts. The genealogies of our
Lord, one in Matthew and one in Luke, ,
are different.. They agree from Abraham
to David, but from David to Christ, Mat- j
j thew makes twenty-eight generations and i
; Luke thirty-eight. ' One gives Jacob as |
! the father of Joseph, and the other gives |
! Heli as the father of Joseph. Other slight
| discrepancies might be mentioned. They j
| prove the genuineness of the gospels j
: rather than the untruthfulness of the
records.
"Matthew wrote in Palestine for the Jews
and showed that Jesus was the fulfill
ment of prophecy. Mark â¢ wrote in Rome
j and asserted the authority and power of
j Jesus as the son of God. His theme is the
I divinity of Christ. Luke wrote for the
'â  Greeks. His is the gospel of breadth, of
j the universality of the love of God." It is
j weighted with mercy. He is the most ad
vanced of all tbe writers. s
"John wrote for no particular race or
j Feet, but for all mankind. He defines
Christianity as life, Christ as Christianity.
He lived nearest Christ and wrote a con
tinuous and unbroken narrative out of a
deep and rich experience. In the Apoca
lypse Matthew is likened to the figure of a
man, Mark to a lion, Luketto a sacrificial
ox and John to a soaring eagle.
"Tie memoirs of Jesus make the most
important literature of the world. They
contain the greatest thoughts, the most
remarkable deeds, and independent
paint the picture of the greatest life that
has ever been lived. TRou-seau said, 'The.
gospel history can be _no fiction, else the
inventor would be greater than the hero,'
a remark from which Theodore Parker
probably coined his " famous sentence, 'It
takes a Jesus to forge a Jesus." "
Freedom Wherewith
Christ Has Freed Us.
â  Rev. Francis B. Doherty. of St. Mary's
Church preached last evening from the
Epistle to the Galatians, on the "Freedom
wherewith Christ has made us free.'! 7
\ "The same possession, the same respon
sibility, the same warning, are ours to
day,", be said. "When living in an at
mosphere of, freedom, which is our pride
and boast, we find not that rude shock of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 29, 1897.
persecution so harmful as the specious
plea for freedom in thought ; and in con
duct. We cannot free : ourselves from
truth and from our relations to God.
The will is free, but the intellect must ac
cept the truth when reasonably presented.
The will may harden the heart and close
the eyes, but the truth remains â to our
responsibility and peril. In the flights of
so-called reason some may strive to rise
above the encompassing truth which sur
rounds us, but they rise to an atmosphere
so rarified that the soul perishes and the
body is dashed down again to its destruc
ion. â â .â .â -',.â 
"It is in Christ and his truth wherewith
we are made free. In his truth and in his
church we find freedom from error,
douht and anxiety. When the word
of truth comes freighted with his
promise and the grace of the Holy
Ghost, we acknowledge our belief and are
freed from the . strivings of those whose
j religious thoughts, professedly free, are
j shaped and shaded by their own personal
, vagaries. We are lifted above our petty
selves into a true conception of God's pur
; pose in our creation and liberation. If
! faithful, we are. freed, alone from
error, but from evil as well, by the posses
! sion of him wherewith we were made
' freeâ the prisoner of the eucharist in the
â  tender bondage of that love which brought
him down from heaven, which led him to
take upon himself the bonds of poor
humanity â poverty, humiliation and per
secution, and made us free." r 7
Christ's Kingdom
Is Universal
The Rev. Dr. John Coyle, presiding elder
of the San Francisco district, preached a
sermon at the Simpson Memorial Church
last night which was highly complimented
for its force and beauty. His text was
from Isaiah: "Look unto me and De ye
saved ail ye ends of the earth." He said:
"The author of this invitation must be
some uncommon person. No ordinary
human being could presume to claim for'
himself the vast power essential to the ac
complishment of the purpose here made
known. None other than the Son of God,
who was pre-eminently the subject of tee
prophet's utterance would have used such
words.
"The kingdom of Jesus Christ is to be
universal in its . extent. It is not to be a
dominion over nations and governments,
but over individual consciences and lives.
The gospel of Christ is equal to this
world-wide requirement. Â«â  Other religions
are local, but this is universal in Its char
acter."
Communism of the
Disciples of Christ.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 28.â Rev. Ed
wards Davis preached at the Central
Church last night on "The Communism
of the Disciples of Christ." He took as his
text Acts ii:44-45: "And all that believed
were together, and all had things common ;
and they sold tbeir possessions and goods
and parted them to all according as any
man had need." He said:
"The text is a woof on which may be
woven a creed of communism. But the
fabric is such that it cannot endure the
strain of political wrangling. Tbe cloth
of communism must not be rent; it is the
collective property of the community, and
when it is torn by thieves, as in the case
of the holy coat rent in twain, it shall lose
its vinuous power.
. "Men have attempted to establish the
commonwealth of commutfism througb
transcendentalism, legislation and war,
and they have failed. Tbe solution of the
social problem depends on ' individual de
port mont â on deeds, not dreams. Not on
the battle field, not in tbe legislative halls,
not on the rostrum, stage or puipit, not in
the home, but in tha gutter of the alley,
in the pesthouse, tne asylum, the prison,
shall the incarnate Christ be. When
i honor shall be given to the past purity of a
| fallen, woman and tothe marred image of
I God in a ruined man; when the peanut
i vender, the bookblack, the streetsweeper,
| the flowergirlâ when the poor and _ the
j oppressed shall take place with the hum
j ble; who have reason to be proud, then
I shall the human brotherhood find its
j fatherhood, God.
"The Christian communist most be a
disciple of Christ, not only in doctrine but
in deed. The rich must be willing to be
come poor. It is no more that man
should sell all that he bath than that tbe
Christ should have left his throne in
.leaven to come unto the lowly state of
man; and if you doubt that Jesus left such
a throne you cannot dispute that he re
fused a throne at Serusalem. The blessing
and ihe curse of the nation is not capital,
but the capitalist. I know several bankers
in this City that are Christian gentlemen,
but I know one who is a pawn-broker, a
miser and an extortioner. 'Goto, now, ye
I rich, weep and howl, for the miseries that
are coming upon yon.' * â  ''â¢â¢â â

MAJOR WINCHELL
LOOKING FOR LAND
G.H. Maxwell Leads Him
to the San Joaquin
' % With a Scheme.
A Proposition by Which Men
May Pay for a Small Farm
by Their Labor.
Scrip Could Be Used in Place of
.Money,. That Would S.rv.
Â£761*7 Purpose
Major W. W. Winchell and George H.
Maxwell took a run into the country yes
terday to look at a piece of land which tha
latter offers as a basis for the colonization
scheme which is being proposed by the
Salvation Army as a solution of the prob
lem of the surplus labor. ; 77*77
"I took the major down to the ranch by
WRy of finding opportunity to pump him
full of my theories as much as anything,"
said Mr. Maxwell last evening. "I be
live tbat the Government or the organized
business men of the State and
Nation have got to face and
find a solution for this problem
of the unemployed. _ And to my mind
there is only one way in which it may be
solved, and that is by getting the people
out to the land. Why this spectacle that
we see here of men dragging 'a' wagon
around Â« the street asking to be given
things to eat is nothing compared to the
conditions of the same kind that exist in
the big cities further Eastâ Chicago for
instance. There are thousands of men
there in want of the necessaries of life. A
few minutes' ride out of Chicago will dis
cover wide tracts of land serving no good
whatever. All these people could be
taken out to this land, given a spade and
a hoe, and the problem of their suste
nance would be solved â they would sim
ply dig their living out of the ground.
"The tame conditions are here. It is
the widespread theory of the single
taxer â who admits thii to be the solution
of all the trouble that the land is
monopolized, that it is impossible for the
people to get to the land because it is
owned by speculators.: Nothing is further
from the fact Let ,it be known at any
time of day that a man is standing at the
corner of Pine and Montgomery, who
knows how to cultivate a piece of land
and could and would improve it, "and I
will wager something that ne will be
besieged by men offering him land as a
gift â with the only stipulation that he
cultivate and improve it. No, the fact is,
the land is clamoring for the people rather
than the people for the land. Any quantity
of excellent land may be bad in the fertile
valleys of this State for as little as $30 an
acre. --,*' "v.V 1 ." **-.*-"
"Now, the *olan I have suggested to
Major Winchell runs something like this:
Say the owner of a big tract of iand would
split it in two. reserving half for himself
and dividing the. other into tracts of ten
acres each. Onto these small tracts could
be placed the home-seekers, with the prom
ise that after three years' occupancy and
work they could own the land and the im
provements they bad created. One year
the man of the -familyâ if it be a family
should work for the rancher who sells
him the ; land. . One year's .worK
would pay for it. By ; this means
the rancher has his land improved,
wells dug upon it, wiudmilis constructed,
roads built, etc. in a word, put in condi
tion that will enhance its' value to an ex
tent fully equal to the amount he lias, in'
land, paid out. On the other baud he has
created a settlement, has ready labor at
band when he needs it, and the laborer
has acquired a home and a little estate
that will forever remove him from the
fear of want. . v-7777
"And this thing is necessary on an
other view. San Francisco has lost the
trade of the Northwest and of the south
to a great extent. She must people her
valleys, the valleys naturally tributary to
her. If she does this tbe San Joaquin
alone will fill up the gap in her trade left
by the loss of Portland and the Sound.'
7 "I believe the business men and land
owners will stand together in furthering a
movement of this kind. The Salvation
Army has the machinery and the con
fidence of all necessary to put it into
speedy execution. Now is the time to do
it when the price of land is so low. Four
years ano it would have been impossible.
Very little capital would be, necessary.
The ranch owner could iasue certificates for
the day's labor as performed and these cer
tificates would be good at the commissary
for necessaries, Adobe houses, the very
beat for the warm climate, could be built
with little more than labor. I live in one
.that was built fifty years ago, and it is as
good as new."
Major Winchell will confer with busi
ness men further to-day about the scheme.

BY-LAWS NOT ACCEPTED.
The " Home and Help Supply Associa
tion" in Doubt About Their
Govern
The organization of the ' unemployedâ
"The Home and Help Supply Associa
tion 1 ' â held a meeting yesterday morning
to consider the adoption of by-laws.
The meeting was adjourned until 7:30 in
the evening, at which time action upon
the by-iaws was again postponed.
The resignation of Vice-President Mer
rill was tabled. Considerable -discussion
arose over the question of the propriety of
allowing discrimination in the matter
of sleeping facilities. The body voted al
most unanimously in favor of all being
put on an equality in this regard.
The monotony, of the day's .prolonged
idleness was diversified by a tug-of-war,
made up of teams from the culinary de
partment and the men from the body.
After pulling for twenty-seven minutes,
the men from the body gained the goal
and were rewarded with cheers.
TO SAN JOSE IS THE CRY.
Prospect That the Boulevard Will
Be Extended to That
. "... .. ..-;, : ' -City^7^7'
It is expected that the grand boulevard
now being built will not end at Ingleside,
but will be continued â  on -' to San Jose,
forming one of the most picturesque drive
ways in the United States.
There were 566 men at work on the boul
evard Saturday, an increase of sixty-live
over tbe number on the day before. Ad
ditional ticKets were issued Saturday and
it is expected that more than 600 will be
put at work this morning. Thirty tickets
which bad remained in the ofiice uncalled
for for a week were destroyed Saturday
and there are nearly 100 left that should
be called for pretty soon or they will be
destroyed. 7 ...
One hundred were put to work in Tro
cadero canyon Saturday morning, where
a fill of forty-five leet and a heavy cut have
to be made.
Several lumber companies have made
contributions of lumber for culverts, etc.
The grand total of subscriptions is now
between $13,000 and $14,000, of which
amount only $2794 60 has been paid out. r
In all Europe there are 6274 professors
in tbe colleges and universities. J ;

THE CALL Â£PEAKS FOR ALL.
All the country asks of Congress is to
rush the bill to start the mills.
While the diplomatists are talking the
Greeks are acting, and as usual action will
win.
Cleveland seems to have dropped out of
sight without even a. thud to attract at
tention.
"Choose your partners," says King
George to the powers, "the dance is about
to begin." â 
- Salisbury is a wise man in one respect.
He has made no attempt to answer Glad
stone's letter.
The pure food law was intended for the
prosecution of rogues and not for the
persecution of innocent dealers.
The attitude of Kaiser William on the
Cretan question is a good deal like that of
an irritated child who won't play.
The surest way to get the best bargains
of the spring trade is to read The Call
advertisements and find out where they
are.
Chicago leads the East in spring move
ments his year. The papers of that city
are already complaining that mad dogs
are rushing the season.
This week will see the Dingley bill sent
to the Senate, and it will not be long be.
fore we know whether we may expect Its
enactment by May 1 or not until some
time next fall.
It is already noted in Washington that
whereai Cleveland was a maker of strife,
McKinley is a peacemaker. The one in
terfered with legislation, out the other
will promote it.
It will be noticed there is peace in Crete
everywhere except at the ports where the
powers are disturbing the situation by
trying to impose a sort of peace to which
the people object. -
The longest word in the English lan
guage is disproportionableness and yet it
hardly: serves to express the relation of
Democratic talk against the tariff bill and
the amount of sense they utter.
The country could well afford to have
the new tariff rushed through by May 1.
It would be better to lose a great deal of
Congressional oratory than to lose the
revenues for two or three months.
The proceedings of the Democrats in
Congress are more like talking against
time than fighting tbe tariff bill. Asa
matter of fact they have killed a good
deal of time, but tbey have not hurt the
bill. . .-â â >' .77;0
The rush to get imported goods into the
country will swell the revenues tbis
month and for the month to come and
then, we shall hear the free-traders de
clare the Wilson tariff has been vindi
cated.
It ij now said that within two years
through trains will be running on the
Siberian railway, and after tbat the man
who takes eighty days to go round the
world will be regarded as a passenger in a
slow coach.
In all the States where the Legislatures
are still in session attempts are being
made to prevent klnetoscope exhibitions
of the Carson prizefight, and the Nevada
industry may yet lose a good deal of the
advertising it expected.
â  . . .
The crisis in the Levant has hastened
the coming of the inevitable conflict be
tween liberalism and conservatism in Eu
rope, and every nation will find it an
internal as well as an international dis
turbance before it is over.
The Mississippi seems determined to
sweep the whole country this year from
St. Paul to New Orleans, and if the Mis
souri should take a notion to rise -at the
same time the chances for. a universal
regatta would be exceptionally good.'
The statement of Congressman Blayder<
of Texas, "The tariff is a business matter,
and I can see no reason why the people o'
ray district should not share in its ad
vantages," is so sensible that there is
good reason for' wondering how be can be
a Democrat. ' J/'./;. J: 77
The Commercial Advertiser of New York
has obtained the opinions of the presi
dents of the principal universities and
colleges in. -.the East on "yellow journal
ism," and the vigor of their denunciation**
encourages the hope that the evil will
soon be suppressed by the force of public
opinion. 7. .
Up to date not a single one of the great
powers that . has . a -warship at Crete has
expressed satisfaction with what has been
done there. Each; nation is trying to
throw the blame on the others, and if the
situation continues much longer the con
cert will end 'in something like a Demo
cratic ward meeting.
As Mr. Huntington, expects. the gap id !
tbe coast road {to *be * closed !. this ; year.it ,
will not be long before 'j the ,â  great tide of
travel to San v Francisco ,: from the ; south
will enter the City at 'the depot at Fourth
street. â ". It is time, therefore, to begin the
work of improving that street to Market,"
so that the entrance to the City will, not
make Â» bad impression upon visitors.
LESS TALK AND MOEE ACTION.
* If there be any more Representatives in
the House who come as near .. to Knowing
what they are there for as Mr. Dalzell of
Pennsylvania does, they have rat "least
afforded that gentleman plenty of time in
which to beat tbem in affirming it. 7 Only
last week' Mr." Dalzell was inspired to get
upon bis feet and declare bis conversion
to the belief that,"The country does not
want declamation; it wants action. Words
are poor substitutes for men who want
work. Oratory will not open a single mill
or kindle a single furnace fire."
That glistening truth sbould fall upon
Mr. Dalzeli's associates like a white light.
<.We certainly have had enough tariff
discussion to last us to the end of our
days. The whole ground has been worked
over and over and over again. The Nation
itself has waded through so contusing a
mass of it that it has twice reversed its
verdict upon it at the polls.
It is only a question of time, if the end
less controvery goes on, when not a man
jack of us will know even what "tariff"
means.
..The decision at the last election was
unmistakably for a protective tariff.
That ought to be clear enough for even
the most conventional Congressman to
discern, even through the obscuration of
an enveloping fog-like self-esteem accen
tuated by the bells and whistles of bis
own oratory sounding through the mist.
Happily, however, a prescriptive limit of
time looms before us as a relief from him,
whether he sees rightly or not. The 31st
instant will end the' period originally set
apart for "discussion," and while even the
utmost minute will doubtless be utilized
in chinning away as far from a conclusion
as ever by some irrelevant idiot, there is
cheer in the knowledge that it will end
there. The Senate will then take up the
bill and let us devoutly hope pass it forth
with. It has been carefully and ably pre
pared in tbe original and in tbat form
embraces exactly the views upon which
the Nation voted last November.
THE PLIGHT OP. THE POWEES.
Popular sentiment in Germany as well
as in France and in England is beginning
to laugh at the national authorities for
their comically austere treatment of little
Greece in the face of the fact that little
Greece is not at all profoundly impressed
by the austerity, but is rather inclined to
treat it with contempt. \
The thing which most amuses the gen
eral public is the painful difficulty experi
enced by the great "powers" to realize
just bow mucb little Greece has humili
ated them. They cannot help feeling that
they have fallen down ignominiously to
some extent, but they are somewhat cun
fused as to the precise magnitude of their
disgrace. Unquestionably they feel guilty.
They would back out now if they only
knew exactly where they are at and how
to retire with some pretension to dignity.
The National Zeitung, published in Ber
lin, openly sneers at the Kaiser's mad
break in causing bis warship to bombard
the Cretan insurgents while the latter
were fighting the Turks last Thursday.
All this heavy superconsciousness of their
lofty positions which the "powers" have
displayed in their stuffed attitude toward
little Greece has been pronounced im
pertinent and ridiculous. Visions of one
lone settler on the frontier being ap
proached by six or seven strutting troopers
with bright tin swords and toy carbines
arise before the ordinary observer and
nearly convulse him with mixea amuse
ment and disgust.:
It is high time that the newspapers over
.the way bammer a realization oi thin state
of affairs into the heads of the authorities
and convince them that there are mo
ments when other people's business might
reasonably want to be alone. .
POINTS FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
The 110-75 anniversary of-tbe Western
University of Pennsylvania was celebrated
last week. A feature of the occasion was
a street parade through Pittsburg. This
was composed mainly of students of the
university, and those precious limbs of
learning varied the tedium of mere
marching with some of the most remark
able exhibitions that were, ever invented
by the ingenuity of reckless and* irrespon
sible youth. Add to the natural failings
of youth in these respects some sort of a
collegiate connection and you have a com
bination that cannot be equaled for devil

they ingenuously explained.
We are glad that this did not occur in

so we Should probably have afforded the
respectable and eminently proper gentle

PROGRESS OF BIMETALLISM.
j That the cause of bimetallism Is making
i rapid progress in Europe seems clear from
some arguments published in the National
Review last month from the pens of three
well-posted men representing the bimetal
lic leagues ' of .'â¢-. France, -7 Germany 7 and
England. These we're Edmond d'Artois,
assistant ceneral secretary of the French
league, Otto Arendt, who is a member of
the Prussian Diet and honorary secretary
of the; German league, and Aluenham of
the British league. The papers were
presented to tbe United States Senate by
Senator Chandler upon the occasion of bis
recent elaborate speech on bimetallism. -
'. D'Artois states that the great ' deprecia
tion of silver in terms of gold which took
place in June, 1893, after the closing of the
Indian mints to the free coinage of silver,
drew at last the attention of several French
economists to the consequences of the new
state of things, and that the principle of
international bimetallism made hence-'
forth giant strides in France. In 1895,
Ribot, who was then Piime Minister and
Minister of Finance, gave it as his opinion
that- the abandonment of bimetallism
coinciding with other, causes . precipitated
the crisis of agricultural depression which
was then weighing heavily on France. V
â  r D'Artois "-; further informs us Â£ that I. "at
least two-thirds of the French Senate are
of opinion 1 that 7 the * establishment of in
ternational bimetallism would bo to, the
welfare of their country, and about' two
thirds of the Chamber "of :- Deputies in the ;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 29, 1897.
spring of 1896 passed a resolution express
ing ' the > same sentiment. . No ; doubt, -.' he
adds, can : therefore be entertained "that
the Government and the great \ majority
of the French Parliament are in favor of
bimetallism.
Otto Arendt says that by the resolu
tions of the German Parliament, and the
Prussian State Council, and the Prussian
Diet, _ the German Government is bound to
use all its means to contribute to an inter
national settlement of the currency ques
tion, and will not, as was the case in 1892,
be represented by fanatic gold men. Ger
man sentiment is in favor of bimetallism,
and only awaits the action of England in
that way. Should a conference take place
the' German Parliament can ba relied
upon as a strong supporter. : / â 
Aldenbam, the President of the British
Bimetallic League, states that a resolu
tion passed last year ,by the House of
Commons without amendment or division
convinces him tbat tbe alleged decline of
interest in bimetallism is a vain imagina
tion, and that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the
full assent of the House of Commons, will
do all ' that can be done io promote a
monetary agreement between the great
commercial nations. -
_ It is evident from these statements that
the cause of bimetallism has strong sup
port in Europe as well as in this country.
Tbe defeat of Bryanism has strengthened
the movement for international agree
ment, and Senator Chandler was right
in urging upon the Senate the importance
of immediate action on our ' part to lead
the way. * -* - â â  â â â â 'â 
IS THERE HOPE FOR THE CANAL.
' There was a good deal of sanguineness
in the country twelve years ago. -.' The
bright, healthy people of the West were
ready to pin their exuberant faith to any
prospect that struck them as desirable.
What they wanted they believed, with in
genuous optimism, they would eventually
attain, especially if it were proposed in
due authoritative form by tbeir official
representatives. It is not too much to
sayâ for we are confident that the older
residents of San Francisco will bear us out
in itâ that not longer ago than twelve or
fifteen years it was complacently assumed
by half the people of the State that some
bright day tbe gods would look down and
behold a completed "new" City Hall in
San Francisco or some other wonder of
equal magnitude, and tbe same hopeful
spirits, with a lot of others, were quite as
firmly persuaded that within a few years
tbey would witness the opening of.the
Nicaragua canal. /â 'â ',:
In 1885 a majority of American Senators,
moved partly by impatience and partly
by unbroken faith in the future, at
tempted to force things in tho direction
of a canal by voting in favor of a treaty
with Nicaragua, whereby our Govern
ment was to enjoy an exclusive right-of
way across that country, on a strip two
and a half mile.- wide, and in return
thereior was to loan Nicaragua $4,000,000,
to be expended in public improvements,
and give her a specified share of the net
earnings from tbe canal, together with a
guarantee to protect her territory thereto
adjacent.
President Arthur, after securing the
ratification of this treaty , by Nicaragua,
presented the document to the American
Senate for indorsement. The vote stood
32 to 23, but more than a third voted
against it, thus defeating it for a time.
Then a move for reconsideration was
made. While this was pending in stepped
Mr. Grover Cleveland as president, and
into the capacious pocket of. that great
man's waistcoat went the ill-fated treaty.
He blandly intimated that bis careful
examination of the paper might visibly
improve the whole situation; but it may
as well â¢be remarked here that in this he
erred, since he has been "examining" it
for twelve years, more or less, and the
situation has improved neither itself
nor him.
Now, however, the treaty of â¢ twelve
years ago has been recurred to by Senator
Sherman, upon tbe suggestion of Minister
Rodriguez of Nicaragua, and the Senate
has been considering it anew. It is not
at all likely that it will pass now, nor
would it be advisable to have it passed at
this late date, when conditions are all
changed . from what tbey -. were twelve
years ago. Tbere -have been wars in
and about Nicaragua, and the lat
ter has become a 'part of the
Central American Republic, thereby
in all probability precluding any arrange
ments for United State? protection to her
territory as "fas formerly proposed. Be
sides, the* construction of a canal has act
ually been commenced by private ar
rangements with Nicaragua, ' and the
projectors thereof would . require reim
bursing by whoever took the job off their
hands.
. But something on the primary lines of
the original treaty might be passed, Such
a treaty would undoubtedly conflict with
the Clayton- Bulwer treaty now existing
between us and Oreat Britain, but Sen
ator Morgan boldly proposes that this lat
ter be abrogated. Considerable discussion
must necessarily follow -so important . a
proposition, and the Senate ij likely to de
vote **. large amount of its spare time
upon it while the House is loitering over

Americans in Nicaragua
Who Have Planted

Alexis Sullivan and His Experiences
Near Matagalpaâ No Work What
ever on tbe Cana'.
Alexis Sullivan, manager of an impor
tant coffee company owning tineas twenty
miles, northeast of Mataealpa, in Nicar
agua, is among the arrivals at the Grand.
The owners in the company are nearly all
San Francisco men. Mr. Sullivan himself
used to live here. He went down there
about four years ago and began in the eof-
fee business in a rather modest .way and
to-day the company owns about 900 man
zanas or 1800 acres of good coffee land. Of
this 2501 acres are planted with 100,000
trees. It is the idea of the company to
keep on planting till there are 500,000 or
more trees. ,
..-, Coffee-growiti a , is profitable and Mr.
Sullivan and bis associates seem to have
been fortunate in beginning at just, the
right time. They got their land at an av
erage price of about $1 an acre. Now all
the good coffee land,; is practically occu
pied and bas risen in price. The best cof
fee land is in the mountains, or at least
in.the foothills, so .Mr. Sullivan says.
The flat land, odd as it may; at first seem,
is not good for coffee, for in Nicaragua it
holds water and that is bad for the tree.
Sloping land is needed, so that in the
rains tbat fall for a good portion of the
year the water may drain away.
Mr. Sullivan brought up some of the
coffee produced from the company's lands.
The grain is superior and it is said *to be
in all respects an excellent grade of cof
fee.' It is worth in this market from 18%
to 22 cents a pound.
]J"l am entirely satisfied with the results
of our coffee enterprise in Nicaragua,"
said ; Mr. Sullivan, ; 'and so * are ; ail the
members of the company. Some of them
are desirous of seeu. ing additional stock.
The country about Matagalpa, where we
are, is excellent for the business. M&ta
galpa is a pretty little town of aoout 6000
people, 110 miles from Momotom bo, which
is the end of the 1 70-mile ' Government
railroad running out from Corinlo. 1.7
JJ. Quite a number of American, .Go ''man
and English people reside in Mata, Â»lpa.
Many Americans, including some .."rom
the State of .Washington, are engaj -*;d in
the ' coffee business * near Matagal(# and
their families reside in that place, 7**7
"Among the American compani*' en
gaged in coffee-growing there are fori that
are , managed by the Manning Biss. of
Tacoma.? These four companies (bave
about 800,000 trees. The Matagalpa Soffee
Company of Chicago has 100,000, theiMin
neapolis Company 125,000, a company of
, St. Paul, Minn., 70,000 and a confpany
composed of Los Angeles men 75,000* All
these . companies are r doing :â  well. 4 'fTheir
trees ; are : flourishing and a good 7d'*)al of
money will, from present indications, be
made by the men who are growing ihem.
"Labor costs from 50 to 60 cents fe day

10 cents a day less. It is Indian' laW en
tirely. Â£ The Indians : cultivate ; the feoffee
with a machete, the same/weapon that the
Cubans fight with. With this they do al
most all the digging. I took down spades
there and other implements, but the In
dians didn't take to them much, and I
finally let them go ahead in their own
way. I thought ; it was about the' best
thing for them."' â¢Â»" * l : * "-,
Mr. Sullivan will be here a week or more,
and will then go overland 'to New York

Professor Hussey, the retiring presi

and Astronomers in Their Relations to
the Public," in the course of which he
said: ,_ â¢ â¢ '' â 
.The work of the astronomer, -like .that of
other scientists, is only a little understood by
tbe general public. Nevertheless, - the rela
tions between the two are always most cor
dial; while the astronomer may often be ques
tioned as to tne utility of his labors, he can
never complain of lack of appreciation. Ou
tbe contrary, the interest that attaches to **.
working observatory, especially one that is
readily acceÂ«s:ble, Is always so great that reg
ulations governing tbe admittance of visitors
are indispensable, in order that any time may
be reserved for scientific work. â¢ -*:â ...
As a result of tills interest great advantages
accrue to the science, it has given the world
mauy of its observatories, those of the Univer
sity of Chicago and the University of Caliior
nia standing pre-eminent in the power of
their telescopes. So great, indeed, has become
the generosity of those wlio fere not astrono
mers that it would . almost seem that astrono
mers have only to ask for instruments and ob
servatories to find appreciative persons ready
to supply their needs. This responsiveness is
all the more remarkable when we consider
that the results of the astronomer's labor are,
in general, far removed lroiu commodities

planets, new satellites, new stars; worlds and

Fine Results Frcm the Pipe Sys
tem of R fling.
-vii day yesterday it blew a gale over the
Shell Mound rifle range. The wind was
from the west and north and lashed
around in spiteful gusts, carrying rain
and hail, making life miserable for the
riflemen, fingers were stiff, noses blue
and eyes watery, but still the marksmen
kept up a lively banging in the hope of
getting in 1 a good score or two, for in the
several clubs there were quite a number of
cash prizes, trophies and medals at stake.
Good scores were out of the question, be
cause of tiie necessity of frequently alter
ing the windgauges of the rifles. For all
these annoyances, the men seemed to have
a good time and many really enjoyed the
fun of shooting under most adverse con
ditions.
The principal event was the twelfth an
nual prize shoot of the Germania Schuet
zen Club, for which nearly all of the
prominent sharpshooters had been pre
paring for the past two weeks. For the
nest centers fifteen cash prises, varying
from $150 to $25, were offered. Fifteen
similar cash prizes were also offered for
the most points. In addition $-3 was
offered in premiums, tickets $5 for thirty
shots, unlimited, divided into eight pre
miums, varying from $12 50 to $2 50.
About fifty of these tickets were sold.'
Cash and merchandise prizes amount
ing to about $509 were shot for on the
honorary target, scores three shots, un
limited. Special* cash prizes were also
given for the first and last Dullseyes. The
first in the forenoon was won by G.
Alpers and the last before noon by A.
Jun-rblut. In the afternoon F. P. Schus
ter got the first bullseye prize and D. B.
Faktor the last before the targets closed
at 6 o'clock.
On the point tareet there was a lively
rivalry ail day long and hundreds of
tickets were shot for the red, white and
blue flags. The winners of these prizes
will not be made known until the prizes
are distributed on Wednesday evening
at California Hall, at 620 Bush street, as
it will take some time to figure up the
results.
On the honorary twenty-five German
ring target, three shot-*. D. B. Faktor won
first prize with 24, 25, 23â72 out of a pos
sible 75. For several hours he was unable
to get above 70 and it was thought
that N. Ahrens' 22, 25, 24â71 would be
high. F. H. Bushnell. A. H. Pape, H.
Hilberg and 1). W. McLaughlin followed
closely with 70. Some of the others who
are sure of the larger prizes are L. Haake
69, Dr. L. O. Rodeers 69: H. Stelling 69,
W. Giindemann 67, A. H. Strecker 68, F.
P. Schuster^ G. Goetze 64.
-The regular semi-monthly 'shoot of the
Columbia Pistol ana Rifle Club brought
out a fair representation, weather consid
ered. The Pope gun shooters were there
in full force. The latest to provide him
self with this style of barrel is F. H. Ma
son, and tie was not sorry to test his new
tire aim in a high wind.
The results were equal to his expecta
tions for the high rotary velocity of the
bullets seemed to cut the path straight to
the mark even In the teeth of the gale. D.
W. McLaughlin and F. H. Bushnell were
also there with their Pope barrels while F.
0. Young, who was the pioneer in introdu
cing tbese â¢â¢freaks," as they are called, to
this coast was also present. The Pope
rifling is finding great iavor among the
best marksmen of the East. The scores
made yesterday were not. up to the average
for the reason given. Pope continues to
lower his total on the Bushnell medal.
On the fifty -yard pistol range J. E. Gor
man made a fine string of ninety shots,
averaging to place his shots in a three and
tenths circle. The best scores on rifle
and pistol ranges Columbia target, all re

VESSELS DRIFTED
THROUGH THE GALE
One of Them Landed on
the Berkeley Mud
Flats.
Another's Anchors Held When
She Was Nearly Ashore ,
on Alcatraz.
Wbitehalls, Launches and Fishing-
Boats Were Piled Up Behind :
Meiggs Wharf.
The norther caused trouble on the bay
Saturday night. Yachts and launches
went adrift, white alls, and sailing-boats
were piled up on the beach, and British
ships and coasting schooners went drift?
ing up the bay with the flood tide. One
bark came within an ace of going ashore
on Alcatraz and the schooner Eva carried
ber anchor with her until it held on tbe
Berkeley mud flats.
When the gale came up tbe British bark
Dunreggan was at anchor off Black Point.
She arrived here front Panama on De
cember 14 last in ballast, and for eighteen
months bas not earned a 'cent for her
owners. Consequently Captain Honey
man was not in the humor to expend any
more money for expenses.; When his
vessel , began , to drift in dangerous
proximity, to the island fort the fo<- signal
sent forth an alarm, and in a few minutes
three tugs came to the scene. : -**,
In the mean time the bark's anchors
had held and all offers > of assistance were
refused. Tbe tugs stood off and on until
nearly noon and then returned to their
docks. Meanwhile the gale bad freshened
and the Dunreggan was swin ing round
and round in the eddy caused by the wind
and tide and the current from the Sacra
mento River. Soon the anchor-chains
fouled and she began to drift again, and
again the tugs were called upon. Again
Captain Honeyman refused assistance,
and at last accounts his vessel was riding
out the storm with every appearance of
escaping without injury. He will have to
take a tow to-day in spite of himself, how
ever, as his vessel is in the fairway and
must be moved: ' .
The schooner Eva arrived from Kahului
last ; Saturday and anchored off Meiggs
wharf. She also caught the full . force of
the storm and went adrift Yesterday
afternoon she was picked up by one of the
Spreckels tugs on the Berkeley mud fiats
and towed to the sugar refinery. She was
not damaged in any way and as the
hatches were. battened down the cargo was
not injured. .; â 
In Cane's Cove, behind Meiggs wharf,
the storm played havoc, 'ihe launch Pi
rate was thrown high and dry on ' the
beach and a bole stove in her bottom. The
Alta and the Annie were stove in, and the
schooner yacht Josie will have to go on
the ways for repairs. Half a dozen white
halls and fishing "smacks strewed the 1
beach with their -remains, and as "Mike"
Fitzgerald, the head reporter 7 for the
Merchants' Exchange, remarked, "itwa3
the heaviest blow that has visited North
Beach in many a day."
The Seven Sisters and the Five Broth
ers were also in trouble. The former
started to sea but was caught in the gale
and had to put hack. She met her sister
in the offing. Both schooners belong to
Captain Johnson, and be is the proud and
happy father of twelve children. Seven
of them are girls and five of them are
hoys. Nearly all of bis vessels are named:
after his children, and when he fell short
of a name he . christened one the '.'Five
Brothers" and the other the "Seven Sis
ters." Unfortunately the Brothers and
Sisters went adrift last night, but did no
damage. The Â" Brothers f took . one _ course
and : the _. Sisters, ; favored by - ; a,. sudden
squall, went sailing up tbe bay and came
to a safe anchorage off Main-street wharf.
The Brothers went "scooting" up the bay
and finally came to a safe anchorage un
der the Twin Brothers.
The heavy break that came in from the
bar did v considerable damage along the
seawall. About fifteen feet of the break
water at Meiggs wharf was "carried away,
and the Merchants' Exchange' signal sta
tion undermined. At Powell-street wharf
a number of piles were carried away, and
the -' people ' fled, expecting A that _ every
minute the structure would go. A sudden
gust of wind carried half a pile of lumber
away, and several people were hurt. One
lad was seriously injured," and was taken;
home in a wagon. The same squall car
ried I away two of the electric poles near
Lombard-street wharf, and in consequence
there was no telephone communication
for many hours. *' ' " -,-/â¢
'The races did not take place, but Hay
den and Johnson and Crowley and Fitz
gerald.went out and nearly lost their lives
in consequence. When they got into the
tide 'rip they could do nothing with the
sails and everybody ? bad .â¢ to .go :to work

bailing. Sea after sea broke. over the
whitehails,*; bat tke. men kept, to ' their
work and finally managed to reach Meiggs
wharfs again.;- It was "a most foolhardy
venture and the crew of the quarantine
steamer Sternberg had; the lines in baud
and were ready at a moment's notice to go
to the rescue should one of the boats cap
size. On one occasion Hayden's boat was
in the act of turning over and then John
son ' showed his - presence >of - mind. He
simply took x hold of the gunwale and
dropped into the bay. His weight brought
the Whitehall up and when the squall bad
passed he clambered aboard again!,/: 7
Captain Freeman of ; the pilot- boat Bo
nita had a lively time of, it last Saturday
night. He had to board th** Pacific Mail
Company's Colon outside the heads, and
the passengers were all. unanimous in say
ing t* at they would not take the "gray
headed old man's" job for $50,000 a year.
Freeman got aboard, however, in spite of
the gale, and at once put the Colon's head
out to sea. He was not taking any chances
with a breaking bar. The steamer reached
port on the morning's tide and cocked
early in the day. .
The steamers Pomona and Humboldt
were both* late in getting in, and their
captains report extremely ron^h weather.
The Homer crossed the Coos Bay bar in
the teeth of the pale, and has not since
been heard from. The Czarina remained
at her anchorage and may get in to-mor
row. The Homer would proDably stand
out to sea, and it will be Wednesday at
least before she is heard from. v 7
' The Pacific Coast Company's "Queen is
also overdue. She was late leaving Puget
Sound, but should have been here yester
day morn The gale has been right in
her course, however, and must have de
tained her. ' ' :
Off Lombard-street wharf the gale also
raged. The British ship Hiddekel drifted
down the bay and was only pulled up by
the cables between . here and Oakland.
Two of the " gates were 5 blown away from
Lombard-street wharf and a couple of men
narrowly escaped with their lives in con
sequence. All in all tbe gale made a very
lively day of it on the, water front. '.....,
Varley on ''Perfect Man;'*'
Henry Varley, a London evangelist, lately
come here partly for the purpose of giving a
course .of * lectures at Metropol i tan Temple,
spoke yesterdayÂ»afternoon before an audience
that filled the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium. His
theme was "The Perfect Man." He empna
sized particularly the spiritual qualifications
of perfect manhood. Many of his points were
illustrated by physical comparisons. *He
likened salvation and a feeling of spiritual
elevation to the sudden uplifting of a man
four floors in an elevator. . In every perfection
of mechanical mechanism he saw only an ex
pression of the spiritual -possibilities offered
by an omnipotent, all-wise God.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Sales Not Especially Num
erous at the Present
Time.
The Inquiry for Both City and
Country Property Continues
to Increase.
Prospects of the Realty Business Here
as Compared With Other Met
ropolitan Centers
The rertl estate market shows an improving
tone, though there is room for further enlarge
ment of trade. March is generally a good
opening month, especially for the inaugura
tion of spring auction offering's, and business
in that particular way has perhaps been all
that could be expected, considering that we
are just about emerging from a long season of
depression. â¢ 777 J J/J*/, _.'â¢ . â¢
Private sales haye not been especially nu
merous, but there is promise of a better record
in thai direction In the near future, as the in
quiry for houses and lots daily becomes more
positive and general. Land has a quality of
permanence, and this fact alone recommends
it as a medium for large or small capitalists
who desire safety and exemption from contin
gencies which sometimes seriously affect
many other kinds of securities. Of course
periods of dullness and depression come along
now and again, but in the end everything
works out all right, and the land-owner finds
that his properly is worth as much and possi
bly a great deal more than it ever was.
Cities will grow as long as the world lasts
and will increase in proportion as population
may multiply. San Francisco is a growing
city, and Investment In land within its boun
daries cau hardly fail to be otherwise than
profitable. â¢ â

Explanation.
The arrow filoo with ' the wind.' The top flgu-***
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days- those underneath It, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or soliq
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal . temperature, lhe
word "hl**h" means high barometric pressure and
is usuullv accompanied by fair weather: "'Â° w
refers to" pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied bvicloudv weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high iv the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain ls probable:
but when the "low' ls inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure foiling to the California coast, warmer
westher mar be expected In summer and coiner ;
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result. * *

FROM A RECOUNT
Davie's Friends Are Mak
ing the Contest to
Settle Bets.
Need of a N:w Method of Elect
ing a Judge for the Police
Court.
Counci men-at-Large Are a Menac.
Rather Than an Icdacent to
Go d Government.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 28. J
The recount of the voles cast for the
two leading candidates for Mayor had for
its origin circumstances that are very un
usual. Mayor Davie does not desire a re
count and has frequently stated that he is
not putting up one penny of the money
necessary to conduct the contest, and that
he does not know who are the prime mov
ers in the matter.777
Strange as it may seem this is probably
true, for the contest lias been undertaken
by men who have pooled their issues for
the purpose of having satisfaction regard
ing some election bets. ' They are of the
M inion that Davie was counted out and
Wtat a recount will show that Captain
Jl homas was not elected. Some of these
men do not hesitate to admit that they
made bets, although knowing full well
that such an action is a criminal offense.
The supporters of Captain Thomas are
in an unenviable position. They are not
anxious to see him forced to pay one-half
the expenses of a recount which the law
now requires of a contestant, and they do
not want it to appear that they are afraid
of the consequences of a recount, because
they most assuredly are not. It would be,
perhaps, more satisfactory if all efforts to
oppose the recount were at once slopped
and loyal Republicans do for their candi
date what Davie's friends are doing for
himâ shoulder tbe responsibility and cost
of a recount. There is nothing to fear
from another count as was proved yester
day.
The First Ward was recounted in a con
test of Councilman, and a snap tally
showed that Thomas gained a few votes.
If, as was alleged, the railroad politicians
were working lor Davie, their work would
certainly be approved in the First Ward,
but there was no evidence of either iraud
or carelessness?. There is nothing to lead
to a belief that a recount will alter the
result. --.J _
In Saturday's recount the charges of
irregularity were more sweeping than
those made in the contest over the mayor
alty, and it is but reasonable to suppose
that nothing more will come of the latter
than of the former.
There will soon be another complica
tion over the appointing power of the
Police Judge. It is authoritatively an
nounced Mayor Thomas will, as soon as
he takes office, reinstate Justice Wood, who
was unseated by Mayor Davie a week ago
in favor of Justice Alien. Doth men were
elected as Justices of the Peace, aud the
charter says that the Mayor snail have
the authority to denote which of tbe two j
shall occu-jy the Police Court. The Jus- j
tices take office the first of the year, but
as Judge Wood was on the Police bench ;
and was re-elected he was not disturbed j
until after Davie was defeated in the mu
nicipal election. Ji&yjf-.
â¢ Now the point arises, is a failure to
make a change virtually an appointment
of the incumbent? If so, then Wood
should still be at the City Hall. This
right, however, even if it existed, he has
lost by giving way to Judge Aden with
out protest. Now, if Mayor Davie can re
move a Judge when he has served three
montbs of his term, cannot Captain
Thomas make another change after Judge
Allen has served another portion of the
term? And if so, there is nothing to pre
vent the Mayor from making a change
every week.
This possibility, carried to a finality,
means that if a venal Mayor be elected he
could be so influenced that he could ap
point for tbe time being whichever of the
two Judges could be of most "use," on
the police bench. Such a state of affairs
was, of course, never contemplated by the
framers of the charter, and needs correc
tion, lt is pretty certain that there will
â¢be some amendments to the charter be
fore the next city election, and one of
them should provide for the election of a
"Police Judge" and "Jus. ice ol the
Peace" "for the city of Oakland," and
then such unpleasantness as will bs wit
nessed next month will be avoided. ,-
The recent election has caused tbe ques
tion to be asked, of what use are the four
offices of Councilmen-at-large. There are
seven wards in . the city and eacb returns
one Councilman. In addition there are
four elected "at large." The argument
has been made and it must be admitted
with a good deal of foundation that the
four votes in the Council "at large" con
trol the other seven. This is true in the
case of a* vetoed measure, as eight rotes
are necessary to pass an ordinance over
a veto, but it is no more true of the four
votes "at large" than of any other four ot
the total of eleven votes.
. But the salient feature of the argument
i against the four votes at large is this. Can
didates for the office are voted upon by
every voter in the city, independent of
wards. It is acknowledged that any po
litical element can, by concentrating its
strength in the whole city, carry every
thing desired, provided that enough can
didates can be put up to sufficiently split
the total vote. It has always been the
practice to do this and then to center on
the four votes wanted. This gives the
solid four power to prevent anything be
. ing passed over a veto, except some con
cession be made. In this way it can
reaai.y be seen that the Mayor and the
four Councilmen "at large" can entirely
nullify the work of all the Councilmen
from the wards.
Five Supervisors are elected in the
county one from each districtâ and no
citizen would dream of wanting a couple
of Supervisors "at large" in the Hall of
Records. There is no more reason why
there should be Councilmen "at lar_*e" in
the City Hall. Stuart W. Booth.

more money, and this time he assailed the
proprietor and insisted that the missing
coin be TeturneJ. The next day he got
an attorney to call on Scharff, the pro
prietor, to endeavor to persuade him to
return the money.
After trying several times to get back
the mi wins coin Cettovich left his job
and patronized absinthe. This morning
he felt equal to taking any revenge that
bis excited mind could suggest. He
picked up some r cks, went to the restau
rant and a few seconds later three big
plate-glass windows, valued at $400, were
partly on the sidewalk and partly in their
frames. While running off he was slopped
by a police officer and taken to jail.
Whenarr -sted Cettovich had $5150 in
his possession. The proprietor will lose
heavily, for a clause in his lease makes
him responsible for the windows. To add
to his discomfiture he tried to get posses
sion of the money found on the revenge
ful dishwasher, but he discovered that the
court had no power to give it to him, and
that a civil suit is necessary to recover it.
KAILROAD MEN ORGANIZING.
Another Conference Held In Oakland,
and Some Progress Made.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 28.â mem
bers of the five organizations of railroad
men who are perfecting the details look
ing toward the federation of their respect
ive labor unions held another conference
this alternoon. The negotiations are re
ported to be progressing satisfactorily, but
there are many points upon which an
agreement has not yet been reached.
The firemen, conductors and A. R. U.
aie quite ready to join the proposed
alliance, but the Order of Railroad Teleg
raphers and the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers are apparently iv no hurry
to take decisive action.
At to-day's conference several communi
cations were read from points in the dis
trict that will be affected by the federation
and it was reported that the unions will
eventually agree on terms acceptable to
all and that the organization will then
elect an advisory board. During the last
strike the A. R. U. declared frequently
; that ii only the engineers would walk out
i the railroad would be forced to come to
I terms. The engineer?, however, did not
I render the desired assistance and much
bitterment sprang up.
Now this is being overcome, and
the desire el those who are trying to per
fect the present plans is to so arrange
I matters that there will be no strike unless
all the unions are agreeable and are will
ing to walk out. It is said that it will
lessen the probability of a strike, but will
practically ensure the men gaining their
point should they they ever walk out.
FLOCKS OP WILD PIGEONS.
Crowds of Hunters Having Good Sport
at Pleasanton.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 28.âEvery
body at Pieaianlon is eating pigeon pie.
The Times of yesterday prints the follow
ing:
Great flocks of wild pigeons have made their
headquarters in the foothills around P.easan
ton. About two years ago these birds at
tracted attention la the vicinity of tan Lo
renzo and down near Redwood City and af
forded the finest kind of sport for the mmrods.
Both the places mentioned were literally alive
with hunters. The bird*! were not at all shy
and but few of the hunters left the ground
without begging all they could carry.
The flocks disappeared after a while and
I there are no reports that any of the birds
I were seen in large numbers in this part of
the State again until they showed up in the
I foothills about ten days ago.
They were never known to be so numerous
I before. The flocts are so thick tnat when
I they fly through the air they obscure the sun
i light- and have the appearance of a huge
clt.ud. J. L. Weilbye is our authority for this
I statement.
A number of nimrods from town made a
! raid on the pigeons last Sunday and came
i home with birds enough to supply Pleasanton
I with pot-pie lor a weet. They kept up a regu
! lar bombardment all day and although they
; killed hundreds of the birds thsv made no
: perceptl ale impression on the flecks nor did
i the onslaught serve to frighten the pigeons
away.
They are fine, fat birds, much larger than
the domestic variety and make most excellent
eating.

DEATH OP ISABELLA MURPHY.
She Was the Dauehter of thÂ« Well-
Known Daniel Murphy.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 28.â The
death of Miss Isabella, one of the litigants
in the celebrated Murphy trial in Alameda
County three years ago, will not affect any
of the litigations in which the estate was
or is now partly involved.
Victor H. Metcalf was the legal repre
sentative of the dead girl and he said to
day that there are no legal proceedings
which can be at all affected. He says that
there has been no litigation of any impor
tance since the settlement that was ar
rived at more than a year ago- The only
case now in court is that of Grant vs. Mur
phy for the partition of some property on
Sansome street, San Francisco, and Miss
Isabella's death cannot affect it
Isabella Murphy was the youngest of
the seven children of the late Daniel
T. Murphy, the head of the great dry
goods house of Murphy, Grant & Co., who
came to California in the early days and
had amassed a great fortune when he died
in 1885. The family was of Irish extrac
tion, but of American birth, Murphy hav
ing been born in Albany, N. V., while
Mrs. Murphy was a native of Kentucky.
The deceased was a sister of Lady
Wolseley. , ; -"*.

S. S. Marshall's Absance
Is No Longer a
Secret.
Splendid Showing of Craft Made
by the Caliiornia Yacht
Club. â â -..
At the Annua- M eting the List oi
Members Was Increased to
Seventy-Five.

908 Broadway, March 28. 1
The list of craft that now represent the
California Yacht Club was completed to
day, and Admiral E. A. yon Schmidt,
Captain George B. Edgar and C. P. ifoore
were chosen to represent the club in the
Pacific Interelub Yachting Association.
W. H. Gould was elected a director, to
succeed S. S. Marshall, whose friends have
wondered at his absence. Mr. Marshall
was until a short time ago one of the most
enthusiastic yachtsmen in the California
Club. When his successor was nominated
it became necessary to give the reason.
Marshall was, it appears, particularly
impressed with the stories told of the
beautiiul Amazons awaiting husbands in
the South Seas, so he sold his yacht and
embarked on the Percy Edwards. His
cut-mates expect him back on the first
steamer.
The Californlans will open the season
with a fleet of thirty-four boats, some of
them being the best of their class on the
bay. This list includes the steam launch
Mascol, owned by Dr. Charles Rudolph;
also the Flasn, owned by Robert J. Chap
man, -.".i â -."- jJ: : XJ.
One of the recent additions to the club's
fleet is the yacht Embla, owned jointly by
the Laughlin brothers and Eiwin Wal
ters. She is thirty-seven feet in length,
and ia her full rig is a very trim-looking
craft. She is elegantly fitted up. her
cabin, which is 6 feet 3 inches in the clear,
being finished in quartered oak and white
cedar.
Another noteworthy boat in the Cali
fornia fleet is the yacht Sea Gull, owned
by K. R. I'Hommedieu.

other. They will he launched in time to
tako part in this year's regattas. The
standing of the club is shown by the fact
that tne boats of its fleet represent an in

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
J. C. Nealon null It. Linehan Defeat
T. F. Bonnet and P. X. .
Donnelly.
The San Fran<*i-co handball court -was
crowded yesterday afternoon, and several
exciting games were witnessed. The
principal event was a game" in which J.
C. Nealon and R. Linehan played against
T. F. Bonnet and P. T. Donnelly, the
amateur champion, It was an off day for
Bonnet and Donnelly, as they were de
feated in tbree straight games.
Much interest was shown in a
game, the result of a challenge, in which
Phil Ryan and Dan Ro-'gers played
against. P. Steiner and M. McNeil. Steiner
considers himself the champion of the
Potrero, and he and McNeil thought they
would have a "soft thing." They were
mistaken, as Rvan and Rodgers played all
round them, and won easily.
About ten days ago 80r...et defeated
Coast Champion Riordan in three straight
games. Riordan claimed that he was out
01 condition at the time, and has since ex
pressed his anxiety to play Bonnet again
to decide who is really *. he better man.
Bonnet was informed of RiurJan's desire
yesterday, and at once consented to oblige
him. Tue match will come off Sunday
afternoon, April 11.

TWO SUCCESSFUL OPERAS
The Great French Company
Gives "Mignon" and
"Faust."
A Pretty Performance of Thomas'
Opsra Comique, With Savine
in the Title Role.
At the California Theater yesterday the
French operatic organization gave two
of the most successful of modern French
operas, both of which celebrated their
thousandth performances only a few
years ago, one at the Opera Comique and
the other at the Grand Opera.
Ambroise Thomas' charming opera
comique, ''Mignon," was the afternoon's
bill, and although the grand tenors and
barytones were none of them represented
in the cast, the work was very pleasingly
sung and acted. - Â. , ;.â 
Mme. Andrea Savine. who played the
title role in* "Mignon," is the -'hardest
worked member of the company, for she
is the dive tie of most of the operettas, the
diva of the operas comiques, and the
mezzo soprano of the grand operas. In
grand opera she is not "dans son assiette,"
to cull an expression from her own lan
guage, but in the operas comiques she is
very acceptable, in spite of thu fact that
her voice is too light to give full effect to
the music of such a heavy role as Mignon.
Mignon is generally classed as a mezzo
soprano role, but although round low
notes are essential to a really dramatic ren
dering of the music a good deal of Mignon 's
score almost demands a soprano voice.
It was in this higher-pitched music that
Savine excelled yesterday. Her duet with
Ljthario in the first act was excellently
sung, so was her scene in the last act with
Wilhelm Meister, and her singing of
"Â£st-ce Mignon?" in the second act is
worthy of mention. *
Although the popular "Connais tv le
pays? ' has no exceptionally low notes, its
general average is low, and Mme. Savine
did little more than speak the first half of
the aria. As far as appearance went she
Was an ideal Mignon, and sbe acted the
part prettily along traditional lines.
In the light soprano part of Philine,
Mme.Berthetdid some brilliant florid sing
ing and acted the coquette charmingly.
Tbe "Polacca" was sung with bird-like
ease and fluency, the difficult octaves and
turns in the final cadenza being a tri
umph of vocal embroidery.
A departure that cannot be particularly
commend' d was the substitution of tbe
comedian Lespinasie for a contralto as
Frederic. Histrionically tbe change added
to the merriment of the work, as Lespi
nasse acted the part of the lovesick boy on
Tony Lumpkin lines, and raised, many a
hearty laugh by his gauchertes. Leapt
; nasse, however, did not presume to dally
with the contralto's gavotte, so the audi
ence was deprived of one of the most
charming arias in the whole score.
Edward Deo. the third tenor of the troupe,
played Wilhelm Meister ana not only
acted sympathetically, but sang well. His
"Adieu, Mignon" Drought down the house
and some portions of the last act were
especially well rendered. The drawback
to Deo's singing is that he is not quite
sure of his high notes ; sometimes be takes
tbem semi-false' to, sometims robusto in
the style of Prevost and sometimes he
seems- undecided which way to attack
them, hesitates and is lost. This hesita
tion was only once aggressively in evi
dence yesterday, but it made his hearers
lose confidence as to his absolute security.
Deo again showed that b - can act- better
that! either of the grand tenors.
javid was a fairly good Lothario and
Manrick aid wil as Laerte. 7
Gounod's 'â¢Faust" was given in the
evening and received a better performance
than at the .matinee two weeks ago. In
place of Mme. Berthet, whose voice was
too light for the part, .Mme. Foedor sang
the role of Marguerite and won unstinted
applauso for her excellent work. She was
a naiv* and supple Marguerite, and her
singing was, as usual, very fine. *
Massart warmed up to the role of
Faust much better than on his first ap
pearance here in the character, sang
more freely, particularly in the garden
scene. As before, Albers made an ideal
Valentine. Javid repeated his tendency
to burlesque t. j c part of Mephistopbeles.
Andree Bavine Was a passable Siebei, and
Mme. Fennau had : another success as
Martha. The ballets in the Valpurgis
night were exceedingly pretty.
"The Wings of the Soul. *!'.
. Amos J. Johnson addressed the members of
the Theosonhlcal Socle at the ; Academy of
Sciences Hall last evening, his subject being
"The Wings of ; the Soul." There . was a force
developed in some men, he aaid, latent in all,
which enab. ed tnem to grasp truth 'instanta
neously. The nearer â  the soul was to nature
the more readily did lt select the true from the
false, without stopping to reason it out in all
its details. This power was called Intuition.
It was in everything unlike the â¢ finite . reason
and in the tentative progress of the latter the
godlike nature of man was often utterly en
gulfed whenever he shut out from himself the
divine light of intuition.

Many Curious Incidents Revealed

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
SOS Broadway, March 28. J
The Justices of the Peace of Alameda
County, especially those in the interior
districts, where the wheels of justice fre
quently get clogged and move siowly, are
considerably perturbed over a recent or
der of the Board of Supervisors. -
During the past few months many com
plaints have been made of tbe tardiness of
litigation in some parts of the county.
The District Attorney's office, it was ad
mitted, did everything in its power to help
out the Justices, but the Justices in some
instances neglected to make an attempt
to clear their calendars, and of course the
District Attorney's office knew nothing of
their business. 77; 7
About two weeks ago the Board of Su
pervisors ordered an examination of the
dockets of all the country Justices of the
Peace. Some of the officials rather
doubted the power of the board to order
any such examination, and seemed to con
sider that tbe Supervisors were exceeding
their jurisdiction. District Attorney
Snook ruled that the board in passing
such a resolution was acting entirely
within its power, and the result is now
manifest. 77.. /J} .J- :j'
All the dockets have been taken from
the shelves, wnere some of them shared
possession with the dust for months, and
carefully inspected, and now it is believed
every case at bar, so far as the Justices of
the Peace are concerned, is on the calen
dar and will be taken up as toon as possi
ble and finally disposed of.
Some of the instances of delayed litiga
tion are very peculiar and were it not for
the fact that the Grand Jury has just ad
journed there gut be material for some
rigid investigation. In the remote parts
of the county cases were discovered which
the Justices had no doubt unintentionally
forgotten, and there ace several other in
stances in which it is bard to think that
the slowness or indifference of the Jus
tices was altogether unintentional.
As most of these offices are paid by fees
it might be supposed ' that the Justices
would settle as speedily as possible all the
cases that come before them. This is not
so, however, and a county official recently
remarked that if all the Justices were not
known to be above suspicion the character
of some of the dockets might lead any
body to suppose that it was more advis
able* to retard justice than to expedite it.
Under the circumstances it would not
perhaps be just to mention specific in
stances of cases that have been banging
fire, but the result of the Supervisors' or
der ban been very noticeable in the inte
rior Justice**' courts and a source of satis
faction to the District Attorney's office.':
7 One of the cases that attracted particular
attention is tbat of Ward at Haywards.
Ward went out one night and without any
provocation fired nearly a score of bullets
! from a rifle into a laundry where were
j four helpless Chinese. Some of them
were badly hurt and Ward was arrested
for assault witn a deadly weapon, and was
finally admitted to ball pending examina
tion. He has cleared out and left his
bondsmen in the lurch. His case has
been set for April 17, and if he is not pres
ent sait will be begun against his sureties.

Te following instructions for the prepar
ation of payrolls, having been approved
by the Secretary of War, are published for
the information and guidance of all con
cerned: 77777
The column, "Year of continuous service,"
in the payrolls (new form), is intended to show
the actual year in which the soldier is serving,
not the number of years' service which have
been completed by the soldier, as appeared
on many of tho rolls sent to paymasters: For
instance, a toldier entitled to fa permonth for
five year*' continuous service was borne as
'*5"; $3 per mouth lor ten years was borne as
"10"; $4 per month for fifteen years' serv.ee
was borne as "15," when lt shou.d have been
apparent that said sums could be due only in
the sixth to tenth incusive, eleventh to fif
teenth inclusive and sixteenth to twentieth
years Inclusive, respectively. Therefore, â¢
1. The actual year of service (first, second,
third and so on, as the case maybe) must in
all cases be stated in the column referred to.
2. A soldier entitled to $2 per month for cer
tifies of merit, or one entitled to "re-enlisted
pay," should be so borne in the column of
"Remarks,", and when the "re-enllsted" soldier
becomes entitled to $2 per month lor five
years' continuous service the date on which
the same becomes due should be stated in the
column of "Remarks," ana continued therein
until the soldier shall have been once paid by
a paymaster, and on rolls thereafter he should
appear in tbe column "Year of continuous
service" as "6." S__WB_r./' '-i

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
The members of the National Guard are
waiting for the publication of the law
affecting the guard that was passed by the
Leeislature, so that they may know, as
one of them said, "where we are at.
As yet no copy of the law has been se
cured by the officers of the guard, so they
are unable to give any information as to
what bas been eliminated from or amend
ments made to the military bill as orig
inally introduced.
The colors of the legislated out of exist
ence Third Regiment, Second Brigade,
have been presented to Colonel O'Connor,
retired. The colors were placed in his
keeping because he was the last colonel of
the regiment. Some time ago the colors
of the First were presented to Colonel
Bush and those of the Second Artillery
were presented to Colonel Mac Donald.
Second Brigade.
Last Monday night the companies in
the Ellis-street armory had a battalion
drill and they made a good showing.
On Wednesday night the first battalion
of the companies in the Page-street ar
mory turned out on Van Ness avenue for
street drill. The battalion, under com
mand of Major Charles Boxton, was
drilled in close column and also in the
riot drill.
Captain Edwards, commanding the
Lowell High School Cadets, on behalf of
Dis command sent a letter to Lieuten
ant-Colonel Duboce thanking him for all
he did in behalf of the cadets during the
time tbey were in camp at Niles Canyon
recently, and the lieutenant-colonel has
sent a reply, in which he declares that he
will always be pleased to encourage the
organization in its military undertakings
and that he appreciates the earnestness
with which the captain and his command
enter into the spirit of military duty.
The cadets wili next month give an ex
hibition drill in the Second Regiment
Armory, ana some time after that will
give a social.
There is soon to be an election for Cap
tain in Company D, First Infantry, to
succeed Captain Marshall. If the captain
does not desire a re-election it is probable
that tbe claims of Second Lieutenant
Thomas J. McCreagh will be pressed for
the place.
It is likely that the newly elected colonel
of the First will not assume command
until all the accounts and the routine
work for the quarter have been arranged.
This will be in about ten days. Then the
command will be turned over to him. -..
The Third Brigade.
FRESNO, Cal., March 25.â The local
guardsmen are waiting anxiously to see
what proposals will be made by San Fran
cisco for holding an encampment there in
May. All the two companies ask for is
their transportation, and they will pay I
the other expenses. No definite word has
been received from the bay City as yet.
Every member of the two companies is
eager to go, and the only thing that
stands in the way is the financial ques
tion. _BS_3_-
In the event the guardsmen go to San
Francisco in May they will hold the funds
appropriated by the bill now in the hands
of Governor Budd for his signature for an
encampment next year. Bur. if the boys
do not go to San Francisco they will go to
Santa Cruz later in the summer on the
money appropriated by the Legislature,
snd to which act it is confidently ex
pected that the Governor will append his
signature.
On March 18th Colonel S. S. Wright of
this City assumed command of the Sixth
regiment. He succeeded Colonel J. J.
Nunan of Stockton. The new colonel has
not yet announced the appointments on
bis staff, but it is understood that he con
templates making a number of changes.
He is taking a deer* interest in the man
agement of his office, and is giving every
appointment careful consideration.
Lieutenant-Colonel Colin Chisholm of
this City and Major B. K. Whitmore of
Modesto, who were promoted in succession
to these positions in tbe advancement of
Colonel Wright to the command of the
regiment, have also received their com
missions.
Captain George 0. Duncan, command
ing Company C of this city, is* at present
recuperating in Stockton. * He has been
laid up since Washington's birthday, and
has had to turn bis command over to
First Lieutenant S. K. , Lemmon. The
captain is reported to be recovering under
the care oi relatives in the Slough City
and will soon be back in Fresno. While
he was out with his company engaged in
skirmish drill on Washington's birthday,
he came across a cow staked in a field.
The animal became frightened at the
â shooting, and breaking her stake-line bore
down' upon the captain. JHe was on the
alert and dodged her charge, but in doing
so Captain Duncan stepped into a squirrel
hol**, fell over and wrenched his back
badly. With this he contracted a severe
cold, and the result was that for several
weeks the popular captain was a very sick
man. . J /
Next Thursday night Company F will
hold the regular election of a captain.
Captain George W. Jones will be re
elected. There will be no opposition to
Dim. He has commanded the company
for the past two years, and has done much
toward bringing its standard of efficiency
to that which has been attained.
The range committee is looking for a
site to construct a 500-yard range. .The
distance of the present one is only 200
yards, and ) the guardsmen consider that
now, after two years of diligent and ef
fective practice, they .are qualified to
shoot oyer a longer, range. The commit
tee wants to got the range near the City,
and is finding some difficulty in doing
this. ' MadÃ^-

THE DEATH KNELL
IS SOUNDING
End of the North California
League of American
Wheelmen.
Chief Consul Kerrigan's Resig
nation to Be Followed
By Others.
The California Associated Cycling
Clubs Will Be the Chief Organi
zation in the State.
The resignation of Frank H. Kerrigan
as chief consul of the North California
Division League of American Wheelmen
was not exactly like a thunder-bolt from a
clear sky, for it was expected. When that
official returned from the wheelmen's con
vention in the East some months ago he
was not backward in expressing his views
that the conditions calculated to make a
heterogeneous association of the Eastern
and Western cycling clubs could not exist
under the ideas and rules prevailing, and
that secession on the part ot the Western
cyclists must eventually take place.
"I have received letters every day," said
Mr. Kerrigan last night "from people
throughout the State, who coincide with
the stand I have taken and who would ad
vocate an immediate secession. 1 have
not felt in a position to answer these let
ters Until now that I have resigned as
chief consul. I will permit my member
ship in the L. A. W. to lapse naturally,
and 1 hope the other individual members
of the league on this coast will do likewise.
"We hope to have another organization
here that can better care for our cyclers in
this part of the country than can the
league in the far East
"The joint committee of prominent
members of the North California
Division. L. A. W. and the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs was in
session ail day and to-night, considering
theadvisability of turning ov&r all the
prerogatives of the North California L. A.
W. to the Associated Clubs. The latter
organization is to retain all its power as
before, and simply widen its scope of use
fulness.
"Those present nt the conference were:
Charles Adams, Vincent Dodd, Percy V.
Long. H. F. Wynne and P.. M. Welch.
They decided to recommend the new or
ganization's formation at tho meeting of
the Associated Cubs next Saturday. As
a matter of fact, the movement is so strong
that already the by-laws to be adopted are
nearly all drafted."
Nearly all the holders of chairmanships
under the L. A. W. will immediately fol
low the example of - x-Chiet Consul Ker
rigan and resign from their official posi
tion, and allowtheir individual member
ship to lapse. Among them are K. M.
Welch, chairman of the racing commit
tee; Vie Hancock, chairman of the tour
ing committee; Josepn Desimone, chair
man of the rules and regulations commit
tee, and H. W. Spalding, chairman of the
membership committee.
It is expected that within ninety days
from next Saturday, when it will be posi
tively decided upon the formation of a
new organization, 1000 members will be
on the rolL
The knell of the L. A. W. on this coast
is therefore sotmciing.

FRUSTRATED BY A WOMAN
Burglars Enter a Cellar and Are
; Nearly Caught by a
Young Lady.
She Holds the Door, but Is Forced to
Give Way After Breaking
a Finger.
Miss Halloran, a young lady residing at
315 Tenth street, tried hard to capture two
burglars last Monday morning, and it was
no fault of hers that she did not succeed,
for she bears upon her person tangible
evidence of the attempt in the shape of a
broken finger and a badly. lacerated hand.
The -burglars entered the cellar by an
alleyway and were observed, by Miss Hal
loran, who promptly approached â  the cel
lar-door from tbe rear of the house and,
like a second Flora McDonald, used her
hand for a staple to ho.'d . the door while
she gave the alarm in accents sharp and
shrill â otherwise a scream. 7 The frus
trated burglars threw themselves against
the door, which opens outward,' and after
a brief but desperate struggle, overcame
Miss Halloran's resistance, though not
before one of her fingers had been dislo
cated.
Miss Halloran then' rushed- to the door
giving access to tbe alley and tried to de
fend * this, but tbe burglars climbed tbe
wall ana made their escape. A policeman
arrived upon the ; scene when it was too
Tate. .'// /-''",â '
! This , is the second time * that burglars
have entered, the cellar, several bottles of
root beer having been stolen on a previous
occasion. Had assistance arrived a little
earlier there is no doubt that Miss Hal
loran's courageous action would have been
successful, and as it is the knowledge of
her - prowess will â ;â  probably deter / other
knights of the jimmy from making fur
ther inroads on the cellar.
MARTIN KELLOGG, PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
KELLOGG'S FRIENDS
RESENT "RIENZI"
Many Alumni Say the
University Is Stronger
Than Ever.
His Skill Said to Have Resulted
io Financial Aid and Much
Prosperity.
Regents and Otbers Do Not Care to
Discuss the Questions Now
at Issue.
Considerable interest has been mani
fested among graduates of the university
and prominent citizens over the right of a
correspondent of the Occident against the
present system and the. present president
of the State University. The writer of the
article took the position that the uni
versity is practically in its swaddling
clothes; that it is not one centralized and
harmonious institution, but an aggrega
tion of separate departments rent by
petty jealousies. It was stated that there
is not a proper directing power behind
the departments and that the conditions
art all against the rational development
of a strong institution along modern lines.
Inauiry among a number of graduates
shows that the general opinion is against
the position of the writer of the criticisms,
who bas been accused of being a student
and by other-- of being a politician.
Morris S. Woodharus, a graduate, and
now a practicing attorney, said : "I think
the attacks are out of place and the facts
are feeble. It is bad policy to attack the
university, which is stronger now than it
has ever been."
Assemblyman Hart North said:, "My
experience as a graduate and legislator is
that President Kellogg is all right. There
has been less friction under him than be
fore, and things have been very pros
perous during his reign. He gets big ap
propriations and has been a success in
every way. I think the students make a
great mistake to complain, if it is stu
dents who are making the complaints." j
â  L. D. McKisickâ Kellogg has been grow
ing ever since be has had full charge.
The university has a good ' name, does
good work and is in every way worthy of
the State. The young men . and : women
now attending ought to feel proud that
the university is in the condition* it* is to
day. ; ',... ':,,
The regents are inclined to .approach
the matter with considerable caution.
Those who . were approached yesterday
generally refused to express any opinion,
retreating behind the statement that they
had not read the original article and did
not care to pass judgment on the excerpts
which have appeared in the daily papers.
"Do you think I ' ought to pass i judg
ment on the matter now?" asked Regent
Arthur Rodgers. "I have not seen any
thing but the headlines of the' daily
papers in regard to the matter. . Besides
the question is likely to come before us,
and it will be time enough then to judge."
Regent J. B. Reinsteiu declared .that he
was not in a position to express an opin
ion. He wanted to have an opportunity
to examine tbe article before he judged of
tne merits of its contentions.:
Warren Olney ; Jr., a member .-.cf,.. the
alumni and at present a professor in
Hastings College of the Law, expressed
the opinion that the entire agitation was
due to . youthful foolishness. "There are
always a lot of ; irresponsible ' young . men
at the university," said, "who periodi
cally take j some premature action which
hurts the institution. I consider the article
very ill advised- and wholly uncalled for."
In regard to the suggestion that - the
publication was inspired .by members of
the alumni Mr. ney said : "At the time
Dr. Kellogg was appointed there was mani
fest among the alumni a strong desire to
secure for the V presidency some - broad,
progressive man. There was some oppo
sition to Dr. Kellogg at that time, but I
have heard no expressions of disapproval
of bis course of late and I do not feel tbat
this criticism emanates from tbe alumni.
7 Finlay Cook of the class of 788 and for
three - subsequent - years recorder of 7 the
faculties earnestly decried the publication
as unjust and calculated to redound to the
hurt of the institution. " / > '7
* "I consider the publication," he said,
"most ill advised, founded upon a miscon
ception of the real nature and the actual
conditions of .the.* relations of the depart
ments to the university as a whole.
. "I think the alumni feel generally that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 29, 1897.
the present administration has been a
wise and conservative one and the present
system of . departments is in line with a
proper logical development of university
life." ' >'*'._
Mr. Cook characterized the intimation
that the faculty of the university was not
competent as an unjust aspersion. He
declared that the work accomplished by
the faculty had received recognition not
only throughout the United States, but in
Europe. All the departments, he averred,
were doing good work, and statements
calculated to produce a contrary belief
could only work harm to the university.
President Kellogg is not inclined to talk
of tho criticism which the college paper
has made of his course. Whether his reti
cence is due to "silent contempt" or a
desire to fully consider the situation be
fore committing himself is difficult to
ascertain, as he refuses absolutely to ex
press any opinion. "I have nothing to
say on that matter," was the extent of his
reference to it. /J ;â *â _â¢* \ : /-~y/
That Editor Hopper will be summoned
before the faculty, or at least before the
> committee on students' affairs, to give an
account of himself for havinsr allowed to
be published in the, Occident the
article attacking President Kellogg and
the faculty, there seems to be no question.
Colonel George C. Ed wards of the students'
affairs committee, . when asked to-day
whether Hopper would be summoned to
appear, said, "Well, there is no hurry
about this matter," implying that the
faculty had Hopper up a tree and could
call him down at their own pleasure and
convenience. The committee of the
faculty before whom Hopper is expected
to.appear consists of Professors Edwards,
Soule and Bacon. "~-
The young man has received no direct
word from the faculty so far as is known,
but rumors have come to his ears of the
impending dangerous storm threatening
his tranquillity. .
He remains passive throughout it all
and seems to know perfectly well what he
is about. His untimorous attitude seems
to substantiate tbe spreading opinion tbat
he has a power behind him, and that the
assaults made upon the president come
from people who are in a position to de
fend the young editor should their assist
ance be deemed necessary.
There is a strong tendency to condemn
the editor because he permitted the arti
cle to appear over a norn de plume, and at
the same time disclaims responsibility for
the sentiments expressed in it. As he
would have the matter understood, fie is
simply the medium through _ whom the
article reached publicity, and conse
quently is an irresponsible .party; * but
those at whom his criticism has been
hurled think differently, and thnt his re
nunciation of responsibility is only a
quibble. . â â¢ "."â â  'â¢â¢>'_

The war between the Olympic Gun Club,
lately turned down - by the ; American
Kennel ' Club, and : the San Francisco
Kennel Club is likely to come to an end
before long by mutual concessions and
compromises. ' . .
The St. Bernard Club held a meeting
yesterday at the office of Dr. Cluness, at
406 Sutter street, at which two representa
tives of the kennel club were present, lt
was agreed in a ceneral way that if the
Pacific advisory board will rescind its
resolutions against the Olympic Gun Club
and make one other concession, which
the committee will not make public, the
St. Bernard Club will rescind . its reso
lutions refusing to show at the San Fran
cisco Club's exhibit. 'JJ 7
The representatives of the San Fran
cisco Club agreed to do all in their power
to induce the advisory board to rescind
the resolutions tnat- have proved so ob
jectionable to the St. Bernard people.
The Kennel Club people feel confident
that they will win all their battles. They
say they are not unfriendly to the St.
Bernard people or the Olympic Club, but
that they won their fight legitimately and
intend to do all that is honorable to win
back the St. Bernard people,* who, how
ever, they say, cannot expect to continue
in dehance of the American Kennel Club's
laws, which forbid the boycotting of any

Fitzsimmons has gone.
Wife, child,' nurse, dog, manager, spar
ring partner, wrestling mate and a large
quantity of baggage have gone with him
on what is to be an Eastern tour for exhi
bition purposes.
Bob did not intend to leave here until
Wednesday or Thursday, but yesterday
noon. Paving satisfactorily disposed of
some troublous financial incidents, be,
or, rather, his astute little brother-in-law,
decided to start as soon as possible, in or
der, it is said, to be in advance of Corbett,
who also is supposed to be casting wistful
glances to the eastward, and having
visions of crowded exhibition halls along
the way.
The entire fistic camp and its followers
accordingly prepared forafoiced march
eastward. ; it 6 o'clock the striking
looking aggregation boarded the ferry nt
the foot of Market street, shaking off apd
leaving behind one fringe of gaping and
morbidly curious humanity, only to be
surrounded by another on tbo boat and
tagged to the doors of the overland train
waiting on the Oakland mole. "v
Saturday night, it will be remembered,
a claimant had served upon Fitzsimmcns
a warrant to prevent him from leaving the
State and avoiding a financial settlement.
At midnight Justice . Kerrigan to accom
modate the pugilist called at the Baldwin
Hotel at his request and squared the mat
ter according to legal formalities. Then
late, yesterday , forenoon the whole diffi
culty was settled by compromise. Fitz
simmons' lawyer sent for Arthur J. Mead
ows,,the manager of the. complaining col
lection agency. 7 777.7
After a good deal of bickering and some
bad verbal bouts between Meadows and
the irate and dumpy little Martin Julian
the manager of the collection agency won
from the manager of Fitzsimmons'
finances and the claim was settled. ' i '/JJJ.
..'But it was a dirty cinch," said Julian,
as with napkin tucked inside his neck
band he plucked hurriedly at his luncn
eon. "You can say that the fellows that
put in the bill are a pack of thieves, and I
stand ready to prove it. Our lawyer sug
gested that we sue tbem for* malicious
prosecution and all that, but we knew we
couldn't get any satisfaction ; tbey haven't
a cent and we would only be wasting time
fighting them." ._â '"-.'
As to his immediate plans Fitzsimmons
himself deigned to speak while chewing
his habitual quid of gum. <
"I'm going right now," he said, "to
Oeaen. Show there Tuesday night. Tele
graphed lor house this noon. Nope, not
much chance forbiiling the town.' but got
a great reception there coming out. 'Guess
people '11 turn out at the station and
that'll sort of advertise it.
"Wrestle and spar .'with Roeber. 'Bout
forty-five minute performance. Do bag
punching and show different kind of
knockout blows and bow I knocked out
Maher, Sharkey and Corbett. .-â  -/J/JJ.yiJ.
"Yep; probably stop Salt Lake. Don't
know yet 'bout other places.
"San Francisco came up to 'spectatiocs
financially... Made pretty good money out
Chutes. Sacramento wasn't what expect
ed. 'Noueh. people at depot and round
hotel, but didn't turn out big for show.
But it paid all right. 7l.77
''Show in East, guess, same as last two
years,' Philadelphia and New York.
Giod-by." -Â
And "the retired champion middle
weight and heavy-weight champion of the
world" ad justed . his high hat. gave a pe
culiar twist; to his projecting square
shoulders and: glided ungracefully away.
At the foot of Market street the Fitzsim
mons presence and prospective departure
were not known until afew minutes before
the hour for leaving, and nothing sugges
tive of demonstration or enthusiasm was
manifest among the chance witnesses. .
. Mrs. Fitzsimmons, large, - matronly, but
singularly; comely, attracted perhaps as
much notice as her husband.
Once when the lanky one hurried out of
tbe waiting-room to see about the bag
gage little Bob, in his nurse's arms, set up
a spiteful screeching and eagerly attempt
ed :to follow his father and ; the great
black Dane Yarrum that had disapeared
through the doorway. Put down on the
floor for a moment the boy, attired in im
maculate white skirts and capes, ceased
his cries instantly and darted for the door.
The nurse pursued, snatched him up and
bore him back. But as she" held the
struggling child in her arms and clutched
his right hand he was industriously
punching' the nurse rapidly in the right
jaw with his diminutive left, ''-'"â¢ "':
For such is the fore- ot heredity.

James J. Corbett was given a flattering
reception at the Chutes yesterday.
Accompanied by W. A. .Brady, John
McVey 'and Eugene Van ? Court, Corbett
reached the Chutes early, in the afternoon.
Already 3000 people were there. !

showed excellent judgment in remaining
sequestered. The friendly crowd outside
had grown to proportions that the police
could not handle, and it was already set
tled that if the fighter came out again he
was to be carried ]to the stage at the end
of the lake and forced into making a
speech.

The Buddhist Priest Lectures
Here for the Last
â  Time.
He Reviews the History of Mission-
ary Effort in Asia and G.ves .'â /
Us Some Advice. \
The Buddhist priest, H. Dharmapala,
addressed a San Francisco audience for
the last time, prior to his departure for the
Eastern States, at Native' Sons' Hall last
night, his subject being "Christianity in
India." The proceeds will be devoted to
tbe relief of the famine-stricken districts.
Dharmapala in the course of a little less
than an hour managed to convey a good
deal of interesting information regarding
Oriental conceptions of Christianity, and
to administer some words of unaccus-
tomed reproof to the materialism of the
West, which, in view of their source, 'were
doubly instructive. '.-,.
He traced the history of missionary en-
deavor, . pointing out that throughout
Asia. Tnibet is the only country into the
heart of which Christianity has yet failed
to penetrate. He narrated his own per-
sonal experiences of Christian profession
ana practice, and stated that the callous
indifference to animal suffering so char-
acteristic of tbe Westerner finally deter-
mined his- departure- from the fold, of
Christian tuition. He reviewed the lead-
ing features of the teachings of .Buddha,
its ethical code so sublime and compre-
hensive, and its exalted â¢ philosophy; the
doctrines of â¢ Confucius and of Brahman-
ism which were old before Christianity
was heard of.
"In view of these facts," he continued,
"Christian missionaries ' should under-
stand that they are not dealing with Hot-
tentots or American " Indians,- but with
people who were highly civilized before
the world of Christ.* They should have
some intelligent conception of the religions
they seek to destroy. _ Christianity m
Western countries is so mixed up with su-
persition and. speculation that the pure
teachings of Cnrist -/have been relegated
into v oblivion. /J If Christians 'â -, will - only
study these ethical teachings they will try
to combat the many evil influences which
Europeans, and particularly the English
have iutroduced into Asia."' *â..'
At the close of the lecture Rev. H.
Dharmapala gave the .following 'verbal
messaee to the ) people of ; San ? Francisco
through the medium of The Call: "I am
truly delighted with the warmth and cor-
diality of my reception here. 1 have re-
ceived sympathy, wherever I: have been,
and I hope to return again in the month
of July on my way to Thibet. shall nl-
ways remember the affectionate j hospital-
ity of the people of ; San Francisco and I
am ever ready to be of service to them. I
also ; hope that 'they will try to make
Christianity a living religion and to spreau
its civilizing influence in Asiatic countries
by practising those ethical teachings com-
mon to both Buddism and Christianity."
