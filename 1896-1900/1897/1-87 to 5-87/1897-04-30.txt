ATHENS, Greece, April 29.â A1l doubt
of the overthrow of the Delyannis Minis
try was dispelled to-night when the King
instructed tne leaders of the opposition to
form a new Cabinet. The opposition lead
ers met and selected the following:
Trim-* Minister, Ralli; Minister of Ma
rin. , Â£utaxias; Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, slu.uloudis; Minister nf War,
Colonel Idcmavo*; Minister of Finance,
Siniopoulo; Milliliter of the Interior,
T-lientoki; Minister of Justice and In
struction, A plivlakos.
This list was submitted to the King,
who will undoubtedly approve it.
Tie new Cabinet will appear in the
Chamber to-morrow and demand a vote
of confidence. If the Chamber expresses
confidence Kalli and Colonel Taamavos
will start for Pharsala, where the army is
now situated. The Cabinet is composed
of the lowers of Ralli and the late Pre
mier Tricoupis.
The Greek coalition Ministries have
always been strong during the continua
tion ot crises, bringing about the union
of parties. Ralli is chief of the Neo-Hel
lenic party.
Delyannis had held power just two
years. He refused to resign and the King
acted without him. To-nieht Delyannis
said he refused to resign because if be bad
done so his action would have been mis
understood. He added that be advised
the Kine to dismiss the Government,
which be bad done. Delyannis said if be
bad remained in office he would have res
cued the country from embarrassment
without prejudice and could have ob
tained a rectification of the Grecian fron
tier by abandoning Crete. .
The new Cabinet's avowed policy is to
obtain honorable peace through war.
A dispatch from Pharsala says another
fight occurred to-day at Valestino, which
* was again attacked by the Turks. The
Moslems suffered a second repulse, being
driven back by the troops under Colonel
Smolenitz.

says Smolenitz's brigade was fiercely at
tacked by the Turks this afternoon ten
miles from Volo. The fight began ati
o'clock, lasting some hours, and was re
sumed at 6 to-night. It is stated a whole
corps of Turkish troops was led against
the Greeks, who, though greatly outnum
bered, appear to occupy a favorable posi
ion for the defense. Since the attack of
the battalion of Evzones heavy field guns
have been dispatched to re-enforce them.
At Volo Wednesday the Turks tried to
cut the railway leading to Velestino. The
Greeks sought to defeat the attempt, and
in the fierce conflict ensuing lost a number
of officers killed and wounded. They
were finally compelled to retreat. The
Greeks have captured the magazine at
Philippiada, many thousand shells and a
quantity of stores.
VOLO, Greece, April 29.â women
and children have been put aboard vessels
lying in the harbor. The Greeks have
almost entirely evacuated the town. A
British warship and an Italian ironclad
are anchored in the harbor.
LONDON, Era., April 29.â Athens
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph
quotes Ralli, the new Prime Minister, as
saying -.hat the policy would consist of
reorganizing the army and raising it to a
maximum strength, equipping and for
warding numerous recruits and volunteers
from Athens to the front, re-establishing
order in the interior and obtaining a satis
factory solution of foreign questions
affecting Greece.
I.cdli added he would not accept any
definite mandate from either the King or

"THE AMERICAN CRETE."
English Opinion Is That the United Stales
Should Intervene and Save
the Island.
LONDON, Eng., April 29.â 1n an edi
torial under the caption of "The Ameri
can Crete," the National Review will to
morrow say: No comparison can be made
between Cuba and Crete. There is more
suffering, it adds, in Cuba than Crete.
Spain has demonstrated its incapacity to
subdue the insurrection and thereby for
feited all moral rights to hold the island.
The United States has a perfectly free
band to suppress the scandal at its very
doors, in which the Review declares no
other nation has any right to interfere,
but the American Government does not
attempt to intervene. The Review says
the Americans are the best judges of their
own interests, but under the circumstances
some charity should temper their com
ments on the infamy of the European
policy in the East.
NEW YORK, N. Â°V, April 29.--Ad
vices received here say President Cisneros
of the Cuban Republic has issued a de
cree convoking a general election of Rep
resentatives to the National Assembly in

Cuban Stales will elect four Representa

the State of Caniaguey, on September 2.
Tie Assembly will elect a successor to
Cisneros, whose term expires on Septem
ber 16. Among the candidates for the
Presidency are Cisneros, Bartolome Masso
and Dr. Domingo Capote. The decree
provides, also, for the adoption of a. new
constitution.

SUNDERLAND, Enq., April 29.â At

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 30, 1897.
THE ISLE AND CONVENT OF JANINA.
In the right foreground, standing far out in the lake, is the extreme northern portion of the famous citadel of Janina, in which Ali Pa*-ha so long bade defiance to
the forces met by the Sultan to crush him, and only fell at the last by treachery within its walls. In the center is tbe splendid Convent of Janina, covering a large part
of the island of the same name, just north of the city. Beyond, some eight miles distant, rise the peaks of the Mitchekeii Mountains to a height of over 4000 feet" from
whose cavernous sides spring a thousand streams to feed the lake, which, though with no visible outlet, keeps its waters always fresh and clear.
In Ali Pasha's time, when Janina was the seat of an empire, as it were, many Europeans of wealth and education were drawn to bis court, and the convent shown
in the picture enjoyed much celebrity. The picture here reproduced by a Call artist is after a drawing by Sargent, engraved by Bastin, in Paris.
what is regarded as bis defense to the
charges.
The churches, he said, were beginning
to complain that the number of candi
dates for the ministry were decreasing,
owing to the secular atmosphere in which
the students are living. It was certain
that some young men leaving the uni
versity felt a doubt which was never
framed in words, but which . erraeated
their intellects. Feeling thus they rightly
did not enter the ministry. The church,
be. added, was not merely a religious
society. He would not have the concern
of to much in tninnta. of doctrine as two
or three great varieties which constituted
faith and separated faith from unbelief.
Cheers gieeted Watson's remarks.
LONDON, Exe, April 29.â The plenary
Presbyterian Synod at Sunderland to-day
rejected the petition containing the
charges of heresy against Dr. Watson,
only seven men supporting it.

TO TEST CIVIL SERVICE.
MeKenna Is Asked for an Opinion on the
Law as It Affec s Govern-
ment Printers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29.âAc
cording to tbe statement of a Republican
member of Congress, Attorney-General
MeKenna has been called upon by Public
Printer Palmer to render an opinion re
garding the validity of the civil service
law as applied to the Government Print
ing Office. A vast number of employes
are in this great establishment and it has
often been charged that nearly all of
them were Democrats when Cleveland
brought the office within the jurisdiction
of the civil service. The law passed in
1885 says:
"It shall be the duty of the Public
Printer to employ workmen who are
thoroughly skilled in their respective
branches as shown by trial under his
directions."
It is claimed that this law clearly
demonstrates tbat employes of the Public
Printer should be outside the pale of the
civil service.

LANCASTER, Ky.. April 29.â One hun
dred men rode into the city last night
and burned the tollgate-keeper's home on
Buckeye street. Th6y called for the
keeper, saying they would murder him,
but be hud taken his family to a neigh

keeper he would be murdered if toll still is
collected and tho gate put up again.
Indiana tollgate raiders have begun
depredations in the neighborhood of Fort
Wayne. Last week three gates near that
city were torn down, the keepers driven
from home and two houses burned. The
torch also was applied to another toll
house in Bath County, Ky., last night.
The keeper moved his family to Ohio to
day to escape the vengeance of the raiders.
TELEPHONE FOR THE EAR.
67. Louis Man Patents a Sensitive Elec
tric , 1 tardrum.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 29.â Civil Engi
neer William L. Skinner has patented an
electrical eardrum, which he claims will
make the deaf hear. The drum consists
of an electrode contact-plate and an elas
tic receiver, designed on the principle of
the telephone, but much more delicate in
operation. When once placed in the ear
no further adjustment is necessary. â¢
To a portion of the device inserted in the
ear is attached a wire so small as to be
scarcely visible. This leads to a dry bat
tery which may be carried in the pocket.
The inventor claims that the wearer wili
be able to hear as well as those unaffiicted,
without the annoyance of wearing a speak
ing-tube. *.*...-â â â¢

Hundreds of Homes Washed
Away During the Floods *
in Guthrie.
Stories of Great. Heroism on the
Part of Those Who Made
Daring Rescues.
GUTHRIE, O. T., April 29.â The great
flood is a thing of the past. The waters
have receded and where yesterday flowed
ten feet of water as far as the eye could
reach the ground is now almost dry.
There arc great piles of wreckage and
shattered buildings and the scene of gen
eral devastation to-night seems more like
the wort of a mighty tornado than a flood.
All night the water receded fast and by
daylight the river was within its banks.
By noon hundreds of workmen were re
storing houses. The trip through every
section of the flooded district shows hun
dreds of homes entirely gone. Thrice as
many were damaged and dozens ot busi
ness bouses wrecked. The loss is fully
$100,000.
Five hundred people are homeless, while
1000 have lost all their personal effects.
Many people reported last night as posi
tively drowned were found to-day in trees,
and it was soon apparent the number
drowned did not exceed twenty-five.
Escapes of survivors were remarkable.
Some swam incredible distances, and res
cuers braved dangers which proved every
man a hero.
Mrs. Rachael McKinney, aged 65,
climbed upon an arbor. After clinging on
three hours she was knocked off by drift
wood, went under water twice, floated an
eighth of a mile, struck a house, grasped
the window sill and, breaking the glass
with her hand, climbed in and lay on the
floor until rescued.
Daniel Smallwood swam half a mile,
holding a crippled wife. Mrs. Fanny
Puffin was struck by a log and drowned.
John Miles perished while trying to save
his children. Mrs. Eva Dumas, Mrs.
Jane Watt, H. M. Sawyer, Mrs. Dennis
and an unknown couple were among
those reported rescued to-night, bul there
are many others who nev r will be found.
Thieves are. looting the wreckage along
the river and entering many. of the dis
mantled houses to-night. Guards are
being nut, everywhere, and if the looters
are caught there will likely be a lynching.
The receding water in Cimarron bas
left an immense pile of wreckage at the
railway bridge two miles north. Watchers
there are positive many bodies are buried
there, declaring that several have been
sighted. The bodies of a colored baby
and a smooth-faced white man were re
covered to-nigbt.
NEW ORLEANS. La.. April 29.â Severe
rain and wind storms yesterday and to
day through the lower Mississippi Valley
did great damage, causing ugly sloughs
in many levees. Appeals have poured in
to the relief committee from all quarters
to-day for tents. Nearly balf the people
in the overflowed section of Louisiana are
altogether shelterless.
The captains of the steamers Creole and
Wilmot have been fined for violating the
Stale law against running vessels too near
the levees during high water, but without
effect of stopping the violations. The
Levee Board will insist upon imprison
ment of tbe captains of the Napoleon and
New Orleans and of all the other steam r
captains who go too near the levee. Affi
davits were made to-day against the
steamers Mamie Coyle and Elmoso of the
Southern Pacific.
â¢ State Engineer Perilliat, who returned
to-day from the Atchafalaya District,
issued a, statement" warning the people
from the Red River 'down not to lull
themselves, into a feeling of security.
There is still very great danger, he says.
The levees must be four feet above the
present flood lever to provide for a rise of
two or three feet. It is now very probable
the river will cut through the Cowpen
Point levee, leaving Natchez, Miss., an
inland town, as Vicksburg was in 1870.
Thousands of dollars have beea spent to
prevent this.
WINTER HAS RESIGNED.
Declines to Serve as the Northern Fac He's
President, and There Is Talk
of La mont Again.
NEW "YORK. N. V., April 29. â The
re-ignation of President Winter of the
Northern Pacific Railroad was presented
at tbe meeting of the directors here to
day, but was not acted upon. All the di
rectors were present except Winter and
Charlemagne Tower Jr. Winter's resig
nation was not unexpected, and his rea
sons therefor were explained in a state
ment which he authorized. The state
ment was thai bis .resignation was ten
dered in view of the recent acquisition of
ia' considerable minority interest in the
property by parties of whose co-operation
be was not assured, and without such as
surance be was unwilling to continue in
tbe administration.
Winter refers in this explanation to a
sale in February to a European syndi
cate, which the Deutsche Bank of Berlin
was the bead, of 130,000 shares of pre
ferred and 172,260 shares ol common stock
in the new company. Winter resigned
also as director. After the meeting ad
journed the following statement was made
at the office of J. P. Morgan & Co. :
"At an interview this week we assured
Winter if he remained with the property
be should continue to have our entire con
fidence and fullest support, but for reasons
given by him and for no others, he has
tendered hi. resignation. You may state
this without any reservation whatsoever."
The stock of the Northern Pacific Rail
way is held by five voting trustees J.
Pierpont Morgan, George Siemens, Au
gust Belmont, Johnston Livingston and
Charles Lanier. Morgan nnd Lanier are
now in Europe, and the selection of Wint
er's successor will have to be deferred
until their views are ascertained, or until
the trustees have bad an opportunity to
confer.
It has been the current gossip for a
month that ex-Secretary of War Lamont
will be elected to succeed Winter. There
is good reason to believe that the election
of Lamont will be acceptable to soma
large holders of Northern Pacific securi
ties, and that they urge it.
ROM HIM HAS A GUARD.
Xeeetsilated by the Strained Relation*
at the Court- Martial.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 29.â 50 strained
have tbe relations between Captain Ro
meyn, now on trial by court-martial, and
Lieutenant O'Brien, bis accuser, become
that the commandant has furnished a
guard to escort Romeyn to court.
In bis testimony yesterday Romeyn
used a personal epithet concerning
O'Brien, which in tbis region has always
been considered justification for shooting.
Recognizing the gravity of the situa
tion, Major Charles Porter, commanding
the fort, ordered Romeyn. to he escorted
from bis quarters to court by officers of
the guard and two men, and it is under
stood that the. guard has instructions to
protect Romeyn at any hazard. A junior
lieutenant at the post said to-day: â¢-*-Â£'-'*
| "If it had not been for the interposition
of friends I am sure that O'Brien would
have done something rash and the court
martial have come to a sudden end. I
know O'Brien was furious when he beard
Romeyn's words.
Mrs. Romeyn said: "We have been
warned of danger of violence from O'Brien
or Bamford, but my husband is not the
least afraid. Ha will be able to take care
of himself." .""*'.'
The court to-day heard rebuttal testi
mony from Colonel Russell and Captains
Burden and Wales, which was all favor
able to the conduct of Mrs. O'Brien and
Bamford.

LINCOLN, Nebr, April 29.â For soma
time there has been considerable friction
between the various professors of the
State University, and Chancellor Maclean
has at times been unable to agree with
some of the department professor. The
trouble culminated yesterday afternoon
in a meeting of the board of regents, at
which it was decided to ask for the resig
nations of James W. Adams, professor of
English, and H. K. Wolfe, professor of
philosophy. The students got t wind of
the action and held a meeting last night.
This morning at chapel they showed their
disapproval of the action of the board by
hissing the chancellor and shouting
"What's the matter with Wolfe; he's all
right." After this outbreak the students
held an indignation meeting, at which
inflammatory speeches were made. The

NEW YORK, N. V., April 29.â Edwin
Hawley, president of the Minneapolis and
St. Louis and assistant traffic manager of

twenty-two days' trip to California, to
attend the first annual reunion of officials
and aeents of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. Hawley visited all the principal
California coast 'points, and! stopped in
Salt Lake, Denver and St. Louis. .
"Business all through the West, and
particularly on the Pacific Coast, is virtu

far as I am able to judge people are living
on hope everywhere, business is very
poor and complaints are general about
hard time 3. Even in San Francisco the
business depression is most noticeable.
"In Salt Lake, Denver and St. Louis
merchants are generally hopeful that a
revival is near at band. The Pacific roads
are not doing a very heavy business. The
Central Pacific is not moving any ton
nage to speak of, for the reason the min
ing interests, which used to form a great
source of revenue, are not working. On
the Southern Pacific copper, however, is
king and the road is doing a big business
in that metal. The far West shows evi
dence of bard times everywhere. Tne
Dingley bill is annoying the commercial
branches, nnd merchants are anxious. As
to the Minneapolis and St. Paul, we are
doing a very good business, although the
road has just passed through the worst
storm of the period in fourteen years.
Our tonnage is good and we are doing
well for hard times.

dence. T ? - ,.,*â '
The attorneys of the road stated to Gen
eral Taylor that they were about ready to
make a settlement, and would offer a
compromise. ' General Taylor stated tbat
no compromise would be accepted; that
the road owed the State the amount ol
$136, .00 alleged in the petition, and that
unless they went to the State Commis
sioners and offered to settle in full he
must respectfully decline to settle the suit
out of court, and it would be tried to an

by the railroad, and they will make a hard
struggle in resisting tbe taxes.

POINTS IN THE BUDGET THAT
IXCITE r iHE COMMONS. .
The Chancellor of the Exchequer
Shows That the National Pros
perity Is Increasing.
LONDON, Esq., April 29.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach. Chancellor of the Excnequer, sub
mitted the annual budget amid prolonged
cheering. He said the national prosperity
even exceeded the previous year. There
had been an increase of 5 per cent in for
eign trade, and home trade was equally
satisfactory.
During the year, he said, the people had
smoked, drank, earned more and paid a
greater aggregate sum in income tax and
death duties lhan in any previous year.
In 1896 he had forecasted the revenue
would amount to Â£100,180,000, whereas it
bad actually been Â£103,950,000. including
supplementary estimates amounting to
Â£2,279.000. The total expenditure had
been Â£102,235,000.
The budget proposals include Â£500.000
for increased naval estimates, Â£200,000 for
increasing the British garrison in South
Africa and the establishment of a series of
postal reforms. The naval expenses, the
Chancellor said, have been increased 40
per cent since 1892, and the educational
expenses for the same period had been in
creased 43 per cent. After deducting the
exchequer issues from the revenue the
surplus for the year was Â£2,473,000, and
that had bÂ«-en devoted to the naval and
military works. .-;- â â * / -â ' â¢ > Â»""Â»Â£ * "
During the year the national debt had
been reduced Â£7,534,000. The Chancellor
said the Government had carefully consid
ered the responsibilities of its position
as a paramount power in South Africa
and was convinced that it was necessary
to materially increase the strength of the
British garrison there. [Loud cheers from
the Government benches.] ["This step
has not been taken aggressively," be
said, "but we intend to fulfill to the ut
most all our obligations and we expect
others to do the same." [Tremendous
cheering by Ministerial supporters.]
Sir Michael estimated the expenditure!
for the coming year at Â£101,790,000 and
the revenue at Â£103,359,000.
Harcourt, leader of the opposition, com
plained that the Government's policy was
to forego a reduction of taxation in order
to carry out a war policy in South Africa.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies, he
declared, had endeavored to cause a racial
war and failed, and tbe war policy had
been condemned by the Cape Parliament.
Chamberlain defended the South Afri
can policy as conciliatory. The Trans
vaal Government, he declared, had spent
millions in strengthening the armaments
of the Boer republic, which were now
greatly disproportionate to those of Cane
Colony. Every loyal British subject, be
maintained, would be grateful if the Gov
ernment recognized the position of Great
Britain as the paramount power in South
Africa and was determined to maintain
her rights. _,;.*â  'â â '.
The debate continued for some time.
Leonard Courtney, Liberal member for
Cornwall, refused to believe the Transvaal
aggressive. This provoked Balfour into
characterizing the speeches ot Harcourt
and Courtney as tending to aggravate the
situation. The Government, he said, only
desired the -actual existing rights and
would regard it a disaster if it were found
necessary to go to war with the Transvaal.
Harcourt thanked Balfour for his heal
ing words. .'â¢

HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 23â It is
sixteen days since the last mail left for
San Francisco, and in that time much of
interest bas taken place, the most impor
tant happening being a threatened epi
demic of smallpox.
On April 9 the Japanese tramp steamer
Kinai Mara, Captain Sakato, arrived iff
port, twen.y days from Kobe, having on
board two cabin passengers and 6.0
Japanese free laborers, or "students," us
they are generally called here.
There were no contract laborers in the
lot, though it turned out afterward that
many of them had fictitious contracts.
There had been no sickness oh the voyage,
and the vessel bad a clean bill of health,
but the immigrants were about the dirtiest
lot of people ever landed here.
On Monday morning * two cases of
smallpox were discovered among the im
migrants. The examination resulted in
139 being allowed to land ana the others
being ordered to be returned. Many of
the immigrants had been deceived with
bosus contracts by immigration agents.
After concluding the investigation Min
ister Cooper. Collector-General Castle and
the other officials went into quarantine at
the Waikiki premises of Mr. Castle, where
the- still are.
The first two cases of smallpox occurred
on April 12; there were two more on tbe
14th, one on the 15th and still another on
the 16th, making six in all. On the very
first day tne Board of Health made every
provision against an epidemic. The 543
rejected immigrants were returned on
board, a considerable show of force having
to be made to get them to embark peace
ably.
Besides the rejected immigrants the
Kinai Maru took away 2.9 Japanese from
Honolulu, making a total of 772 steerage
passengers, or 92 more than sue brought.
It is hoped that the disease will not ap
pear on the voyage to Kobe, but there are
many in this city who think she will be a
floating pestnouse long before the Japan
ese coast is sighted.
In vi- oi the failure of previous pre
cautions to keep smallpox out, the Board
of Hearth has passed a stringent order re
quiring all steerage passengers of any na
tionality coming from Japanese ports to
serve full eighteen days' quarantine after
irrivai at this port. This is also to apply
to any Japanese war vessels which may
arrive.
The 130 Japanese who were rejected
from the lot brought here by the Sakura
Maru, nnd for whose return William G.
Irwin & Co. gave $6000 bonds, were sent
back on the Coptic. S. Asano, the mil
lionaire steamship man, who passed
through Honolulu on the Coptic and saw
the rejected immigrants from the Sakura
Maru put aboard, grew very much ex
cited over what he was leased to term
the "unlawful treatment" of his fellow
countrymen. He claimed that the Ha
waiian Government could not compel
them to return home on the Coptic, but
must permit them to choose their own
mode of conveyance. He said he intended
to inquire into the matter when be reached
home and ascertain if the Japanese Gov
ernment would permit its people to be
handled in a foreign and friendly country
like a lot of siieep.
Consul-General Shimamura, who repre
sents the Japanese Government here and
who was only recently promoted to a
commissionershin, has received a cable
dispatch liom Japan by way of San Fran
cisco notifying him of his promotion to
the post of Minister Resident. The Japa
nese are greatly embused over the affair
and tendered the new Minister a big ban
quet at the Hawaiian Hotel.
The steamer Kaena, with the expedition
under command of Marshal Brown, which
went to look for an opium schooner, sup
posed to b. due here, returned after an ab
sence of tea days without having seen
anything in the shape of a sail. A watch
is still being kept up on those islands for
the expected schooner.
A horrible murder Is reported from
Kamalo, a small settlement on tbe island
of Molotni, not far from the leper settle
ment. The one store in the village was
kept by an old Chinaman and his wife.
He was mashed to death with a rock. She
was left for dead, but recovered.. Sara
Kuu, Paahao and Noa, three natives, were
arrested by Sheriff Trimble and they con
fessed the crime. Noa, the leader of the
gang, offered to take Sheriff Trimble up
to the mountains and show him where tho
stolen money was buried. The Sheriff
foolishly took him up, and when a likely
spot was reached the murderer jumped
from his horse and quickly disappeared in
the thick undergrowth.
Minister of Finance Samuel M. Damon
is booked to leave for San Francisco on
May 4by the steamer China. He will go
to New York and probably to England.
He will most likely represent the Ha
waiian Government at Queen Victoria's
jubilee celebration and at the same time

tical banking in a Scotch bank. His visit
is also made in connection with the sale of
the refunding bonds -uuhonzed by the
last Legislature which P. C. Jones tried to
place in Boston and New York previous to
the Presidential election.
The German ship H. F. Glade, now on
her way to this port from Bremen, will
bring about 120 German laborers, with their
families, to work on the plantations. The
emigrant are to find employment on one
of th- plantations represented by Hack
felJ _t Co., it has not yet been determined
which one. The experiment will attract
widespread attention, and Its success or
failure watched with great interest from
both sides of the Pacific. The assertion
bas often been made that white men can
not -do the work on the plantations now
performed by the Asiatics.
The Hawaiian Star publishes an
interview with Colonel Z. S. Spalding,
who is here for the purpose of getting an
extension of time on his cable franchise.
The press generally denounces his great
assurance, and there is little likelihood of
nis getting what he wants. The fran
chise expires May 1.
The United States steamer Petrel
reached here on the 13th inst., haying
made a stay a: Hilo long enough for her
officers to visit the volcano. The United

except on business. Butler was rather
sullen and morose and refused to talk. He
accepted cigars and a drink of whisky, all
of which were examined by Inspector
Roche, but declined all overtures to get
him into conversation. He did say, how
ever, tb-^t the English officers were hard
on him and that they would never get him
ashore alive.
Inspector Roche said Butler had made
all kinds of trouble on the voyage in try
ing to tear open the wound in his head
made by his finger-nails in San Francisco,
and that he was never out of their sight
for a moment. The more Butler seems
determined not to be landed alive the
more the officers seem determined he
shall be. "It would be a pretty how d'ye
do," said the inspector, "if we let him
cheat the gallows after getting him this
far."
Marshal Brown furnished a detail of
four stalwart, policemen while the vessel
was in port as an additional precaution.
Two of them were stationed on deck and
two in the corridor outside Butler's cell,
but two of the three Australian officers
never left Butler's side while the Mari
posa was in Honolulu.
Labor Cammis.ioner Fitzgerald has
gone to Hawaii to look into labor matters
on the coffee plantations. His report is
already awaited with much interest.
The Doric arrived this morning from
Yokohama, bringing the news that the
Japanese Government had peremptorily
stopped all immigration to Hawaii until
it has investigated the causes which have
led to the rejection of the last three lots
of immigrants. A meeting of the Board
of Health was convened on the arrival
of the steamer, at which it was decided
not. to allow the through passengers to
land here. The live passengers for this
port, after fumigation, were allowed to
land on condition that they report daily
to the port physician for examination for
ten days. Dr. Eldredee, the Hawaiian
health officer at Yokohama, reports a de
cided decrease of smallpox in that city,
there being only twenty-seven cases in
the two weeks previous to the sailing of
tbe Doric.
There, was a big meeting of British
residents last night to ta__Â«- measures
toward the celebration of Queen Vic
toria's jubilee. It was decided that a fund
should be raised of at least $2D,000 for the
erection of a Queen Victoria hospital.
Alexander Youne, a wealthy sugar
planter, started the subscription list with
$2500, and William G. Irwin and others
have promised to send their checks for
similar amounts. In addition there will
be religious services, public games, a ball
and a general holiday. The British Com
missioner will ask this Government to set
apart the day as a National holiday. He
will have a separate celebration on his
own account on Queen Victoria', birth
day, which will be an e'aborat . affair.
BLACK JACK BITES THE DUST.
The Notorious Bandit Leader Killed in a
Running Fight Wilh a Fosse in
New Mexico.
SANTA FE, N. Mex.. April 29.â Black
Jack, tie famous leader of a desperate
ban of border outlaws, was killed yester
day in the gang's running fight with Dep
uty Marshal Fred Higgins and his posse.
The large rewards for the arrest of Back
Jack will be paid to the posse.
The battle was fought in tbe mountains
of Western Grant County, fifteen miles
east of Clifton, Ariz. Under secret in
structions from the Postoffice Depart
ment Marshal Hall has kept Higgins'
posse in the field along the New Mexican
and Arizona border for two months on the
lookout for Black Jack and his band.
On Tuesday night a dispatch was re
ceived from the Postmaster at Ciii'ton,
saying that the desperadoes had been seen
on Tuesday afternoon fifteen miles east.
Higgins was ordered to the scene, and
striking the trail at dawn yesterday fol
lowed it until 8 o'clock, when be overtook
the party, which numbered six of the
most notable cutthroats that were ever
banded together in the West. A hot fight
ensued, but when Black Jack fell from his
horse, shot through the heart by Higgins,
the other desperadoes escaped into the
mountains.
Black Jack's bod 7 was taken to CPfton
last night and identified to-day. He is
believed to be one of the two men wbo
two weeks ago slopped at the ranch of
George Smith in the western part of
Socorro County and after dinintr with
him murdered him and seriously wounded
his cook.
The Masonic fraternity offered $1500 for
Smith's murderer and the United States
$500 for each member of Black Jack's
band, dead or alive.
Black J .ck is the fourth member of the
gang killed by the officers* within six
months. These desperadoes have operated
for a year along the border, killing seven
men and roobing scores of stores, post
offices and mail coaches. ' ;â¢â¢.'â¦â¢-

BIG FIRE IN MILWAUKEE.
Schmidt Hotel Totally Destroyed, With an
Unknown but Considerable
Loss of Life.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 29.â An
alarm of fire early this morning brought
the fire department to tho Schmidt
Hotel, which was discovered to be in
flames.
The firemen set to wort promptly and
for a while it looked as though they would
be able to get the flames under control.
Very soon, however, it was seen that the
building was doomed.
Another alarm was turned in and the
whole department devoted itself to sav
ing the adjoining buildings.
The guests of the hotel were warned as
quickly as possible of the tire, but it is
feared that a few of them, who were asleep
at ihe time, did not escape.
Just how many guests there were in the
building is not known. Proprietor Schmidt
is the only one who knows to a certainty,
and just at present he is unconscious be
cause of being suffocated by the smoke.
Some of the employes of the hotel, how
ever, say that there were quite a number
of people stopping in tbe building.
Among those who are missing is Miss
Schmidt, the daughter of tne proprietor.
Daring deeds of heroism were performed
by the firemen. They rushed into the
.moke and flames again and again to save
people, and they did not give it up until
the chief absolutely furbade any, one
again entering the building.
The building is a total Toss. It is esti
mated that the loss will amount to fully
$225,000. How much insurance there may
be is not known. It is said, however, ihat
the amount of insuranca is small. Very
little property was saved from the ruins.
The guests of the hotel were not able to
save anything.

DINGLE 'S BILL
IN GREAT DANGER
Countless Amendments
to Be Made When It
, Gets to the Senate.
.
#
It Is the General Opinion That
the Measure Will Be Fi
nally Defeated.
However. It Will Be Midsummer
Before a Decisive Vote Is Taken
In the Upper. House.
i
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29.â At
to-day's session the Senate Finance Com
mittee failed to reach an agreement with
regard to reporting the revised Dingley
bill. Another meeting will ba held in a
few days, when it is hoped an arrange
ment satisfactory to all political factions
will be reached, allowing the bill to be __â -
ported to the full committee Monday and
shortly afterward to the House.
The work of the lour Republican Sena
tors who have revised the bill â Allison,
Aldrich, Piatt cf Connecticut and Wol
cottâis practically completed. The Re
publicans are disinclined to submit tbe
bill to the full committee without the
assurance they will be allowed to report it
to the Senate before it is submitted to
Democratic criticism and amendment.
This assurance has not yet been received.
Under the Senate rules unlimited debate
is! allowed. The Republicans will not
have arbitrary power over the bill after it
is reported, though they will be able to
defeat objectionable amendments and un
doubtedly bave enough votes to pass it.
Their present embarrassment arises alto
gether from the fact that the Republi
cans on the Finance Committee are in
the minority, and the attitude of Jones
of Nevada, Populist member, may bave a
direct influence on the present fate of the
bill. Jones is now absent from Washing
ion, but it is understood he has joined tba
Democratic members of tbe committee in
demanding that the bill be submitted to
tbe full committee for a few weeks before
being reported to the Senate. As Jones I .
a protectionist, it is thought he will vote
for the pas age of the bill, but there are
certain matters, including a revocation
of the Hawaiian treaty, which he thinks
will be better treated in committee than
after the bill gets to the Senate.
! Jones of Arkansas, chairman of the
! National Democratic Committee, pur
posely absented himself from the commit
tee meeting to-day. Originally he was
willing that the Republicans should have
full control of their bill until it was re
ported to ibe Senate, but since then he
haÂ« joined his party colleagues in de
manding time for consideration. After
the committee .meeting he beid a long
conference with Aldrich, the Republican
political manager.
The Democratic steering committee
meeting was held later to decide exactly
what the Democratic position will be on
, he bill. .'*.' "
It is the general opinion of Senators that
the attitude of Democratic Senators indi
cates the bill will be finally defeated and
freely amended, and It will be midsummer
before a final vote is taken.
In audition to several hundred amend
ments of the Finance Committee, count
less amendments will be proposed by in
dividual Senators, all of which have to be
considered. Many amendment.*, have al
ready been offered in the Senate. Quay
to-day resented a bitch proposing
changes ii. many schedules. The formal
consideration of the bill ln the Senate, it
is believed, will begin in about a fortnight
and may last two or three months.
DE YOUNG FOR PARIS.
The Latest Is That He Wants io Be Di
rector-General to the Great
Exposition.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 29. -"For
Director-General of the United States Ex
hibit at the Paris Exposition. Michel H.
de Youn* of California."' This is the
latest. Mr. de Young, being disappointed
in his ambition to be Embassador to Italy
and then Minister to Belgium, turned bis
eyes fondly toward St. Petersburg witb its
salary of ?17,000 a year, but the President
felt quite sure that Mr. de Young would
be persona non grata to the Czar, whose
nation is oppo*>ed to the Hebrew race.
' The first intimation of Mr. de Young's
candidacy- for the director-generalship of
the American exhibit at the Paris Ex
position was given to-night to The Call
correspondent by Judge James A. Way
mire of Alameda and ex-Attorney-Gen
eral W. H. H. Hart. Mr. Way mire came
down fiom New York to-night and Mr.
Hart arrived from the metropolis this
afternoon, having accompanied John D.
Spreckels across the continent. Mr. Way.
mire evidently had a talk with Mr. de
Young about the director-generalship
when he was in New York, though he did
not say so, but both Waymire and Hart
declared emphatically that Mr. de Young
is anxious for the appointment, and both
felt assured tb it tbe President would ap
point him. .7__c^____i_BÃH___*gp*___j
"But as yet there is no such office,*'
suggested The Call correspondent "Ob,
yes, there" ie," said Mr. Hart; -'at least I
think that Congress has provided for a
representation of ibid country at the ex
position, although the salary of a director
.-eneral may not have been fixed. But
that makes no difference. It will be pro
vided for by Congress."
Judge Waymire added that Mr. de
Young's executive ability would make
him a success as director-general of the
United Stai*s exhibit at Paris, as he had
already bad experience with the* Califor
nia Midwinter Fair. Juace Waymire said
that it would be a great thing for Califor
nia people, many of whom would un
doubtedly visit the exposition. "Be
sides," said he, "it will be a great oppor
tunity for us to advertise our California
wines.fruits and other products."
Senator Perkins said he was not aware
that Congress had as yet made any pro
visions for a "director-general of tbe
United States at the .exposition." ria
said, however, tnat he bad no doubt that
Congress would make a suitable provision

JOHXSOA'S REPORT MADE.
The __>>...-.'< Commissioner on His Ber
ing Sen Investigations.
WASHINGTON. D. C. April 29 âThe
report of President Jordan, head of the
American Scientific Commission to the
seal islands last year, was submitted to
the Government a few months ago. The
report of Professor Thompson of the Brit
ish Commission, addressed to Lord Salis
bury, bas just appeared. Thompson don't
discuss pelagic sealing, but confines his
report to observations of seal life on Priby
lov Islands. He don't seem to have dis
covered any material decrease in the herd
last year, but adm'ts a marked decrease as
compared with 1892 Me finds the breed
ing grounds in line condition so far as an
abundance of male life is concerned, and
notes a large number of idle bull-. He
concedes that half of the dead pups on the
islands was dne to tbe killing of their
mothers in Bering Sea. This percentage
Is less than was assigned by Dr. Jordan.
He speaks in high terms'of the methods
of driving and killing the male seals by
the lessees, and states he bas no recom
mendations to suggest for improvement.
Although he don't consider the subject,
and denies there has been any alarming
decrease of the herd, the conclusion
reached from his observations point un
mistakably to a necessity for some modi
fication of existing relations. His con
clusion is:
"It is my duty to state lo your Lord
ship that there is still abundant need for
care and for prudent measures of conser
vation in the interests of all. The birth
rate, which we estimate at 143,000 per
annum, is not great in comparison with
the drain upon the stock from one cause
or another. A loss of over 20.000 is ex
perienced among the pups before they
emigrate to the sea, and. though dangers
they there encounter are unknown, we
may conclude that tbe risks ihey run are
great and the loss considerable. We can
not count on increase, and it is my earnest
hope tbat regard for common advantage*
may suggest measures of prudence which
shall keep the pursuit and slaughter of
the animal within definite bounds."

CLAIM MOORES
IS INELIGIBLE
Omaha's Mayor-Elect
Charged With
Default.
Broatch Has Declined to
Give Way to His
Successor.
Much Political Trouble Will Be
Terminated Only In the
Courts.
OMAHA, Nebb'., April 29.â This city has
just passed through the throes of an ani
mated municipal > contost, and now an
excited Mayoralty* contest is threatened,
for William J. Broatch, the Mayor of
Omaha, will decline to surrender his
office to Colonel Frank E. Moores. whom
the Republicans elected last week over the
fusion of Democrats, Populists and Silver
Republicans. That fact has leased out,
and Moores* friends are indignant.
Mayor Broatch claims that Mr. Moores
is ineligible to the office of Mayor because,
as he asserts, Moores is in default ot public
money. He bases his claim upon section
2of article 16 of the Nebraska State Con
stitution, as follows: "Any person who is
in default as collector and custodian of
public money or property shall not be
eligible to any office of trustor profit under
the constitution or laws of tnis State; nor
shall any person convicted of felony be
eligible to office unless he shall have been
restored to civil rights." ; .'' _*~
The specific default to be alleged is Mr.
Mcores' failure to pay over money to the
school fund collected by him while he
was District Court clerk. He occupied
that position eight years. These charges
were made before the election, but vig
orously denied. Colonel Moorea demand
ed an investigation.
Mayor Broatch is now out of the city,
but will return before the expiration of
his term of office and will invoke the
aid of the courts if necessary to sustain
his claim Â»i to Mr. Moores' ineligibility.
Mayor Broatch has retained Frank T.
Hanson, C. C. Wright and J. B. Sheehan
as his attorneys. In the event that Mayor
Broatch should he sustained in his posi
tion lawyers differ as to the result. Some
claim that Mayor Broatch would hold un
til the next city election, in 1930, while
others that it will be necessary for the
City Council to call a special election.
The preponderance of authority, how
ever, seems to be that Broatch would hold
over until 1900. Mr. .--heehan was askeJ
concerning the above, and he frankly ad
mitted that it was substantially correct.
'Mr. Moores' right to hold the office,"
-aid Mr. Sheehan, "will be thoroughly
tested in tbe courts."
Colonel M.ores ie not much alarmed
over the situation. Ho says he will qual
ify and serve as Mayor, and Broatch is at
liberty to do what he legally can to pre

HAVE THEIR USE THE SAME AS BIG SHIPS OR BIG SCHOOLHOUSES.
You would not look for a real big store on B.rnal Heights or elsewhere in the
suburbs â but at the entrance to the city, where 95 per cent of the travel and
traffic enters and leaves, it is very appropriate to have a store carrying a big stock and
big variety of goods. We chose this location because it was convenient for us and our
patrons, in and out of town. The jobbing trade finds it convenient to buy of us for
assorted orders, as well as general dealers and consumers, large and smallâ and in
return we are glad to place business with ell classes of manufacturers and traders.
Our seven floors are none too many for the stock we carry. On some of them we are
crowded for room and are forcing overstock at Cut Prices to make room tor goods
already bought.

FRIES D FOR t'OSTMASTER.
Agreed on by Hilbom and Perkins for
the Oakland Office. j 1 "
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29.â H.
Friend will be the next Postmaster of
Oakland. He has been the chairman of
the Alameda County Republican Com
mittee, and Representative Hil born has
decided to appoint bim.
A week ago The Call printed an inter
view with Pos'. master-General Gary, in
which he said that the Representative in
Congress would always be given the privi
lege of naming the postmasters in bis dis
trict, and that where the Senator and
Representative lived in the same city or
town they were exp. cted to reach a mu
tual agreement.
This is exactly the case with Senator
Perkins and Representative Hilborn.
Both live in Oakland. Many of tbe
Senators claim the right to name all of
the Presidential Postmasters. Especially
do they insist upon their right to appoint
the Postmaster for their own city, but
Mr. Perkins is disposed to be as liberal as
possible, and he -will acquiesce in Hil
born' selection of Frienu, who will be
nominated when the incumbent's term
expires.

RIOT AT SHANGHAI
They Strike Against an
Increased Tax on

The Police Are Routed by an
Immense Mob Armed
With Clubs.
Marines From English and Ameri
can Warships Landed to Aid
the Authorities.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 29.â
steamer Empress of China brings news of
a serious riot which occurred at Shanghai
on April 5. Over 1000 wheelbarrow coolies
had gone on strike following the an
nouncement tbat the local authorities had
increased the rate ot taxes paid yearly by
laborers. On that day 800 excited coolies,
followed by a crowd of angry sympa
thizers, marched from the French conces
sion into the Anclo-American settlement
and started disturbances. The police were
unable to cope with them, seeing which
the city authorities had the volunteer
militia called out. Several alarm _.i_.nals
were given, heeding which marines were
landed from the British warships Plover
and Linnet and the United States gunboat
Monocacy.
The marines were stationed at the Cen
tral police station, the British Consulate
and other important posts. The Shang
hai Clubhouse was made the headquarters
of the defensive force and the volunteer
artillery company prepared for action on
the Cathedral grounds. The city bridges
and important streets were guarded by a
company of volunteer infantry and the
light-horse cavalry. The coolies, armed
with bamboo c.ubi and a small number of
guns, formed in line as if for an attack,
hut the militia drove them back. Heavy
guards were maintained ail night.
At 10 p. M. a crowd of rioters began
stoning a company guarding the Yang-
King- Pang River brid. c. Re-enforcements
<â¢ ime up and the rioters were driven into
Frenchlown, where they sought refuge in
several isolated hous.s. The ringleaders
were there? arrested.
The following day the Municipal Coun
cil met and decided to postpone for three
months the increasing ol the tax rate,
foreign residents think this action a mis
take and that further troubles will result
from it. The victorious coolies have re-'
turned to work.
THEATRICALS AT STANFORD.
"The Conversion of Unc.e" Brings Out
Much College Talent and Highly
Pleases the Audience.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
19 âThe junior farce entitled "The Con
version of Uncle" was given before a large
and appreciative audience in the gymna
sium this evening. Tne play deals with a
curious phase of the football problem ;
which, though important, has not b.en
touched upon in any "ot the preceding
farces. Harry . Hunter, lett tackle and
captain of the Varsity eleven, is forbidden
to play football by bis parents, who have
a horror ol the game. He continues to
play, however, and in a fitof independence
cv s loose from his family an.l starts out
to work his own way throueb the univer
sity. His uncle Jason, a wealthy old
Ar.zona rancher, is sent to bring the
apirited young man home. As the uncle
has not seen bis nephew. Hunter, for sev
eral years, and having fallen into the
hands of some college wits, he meets with
great difficulty in locating the football
player.
Matters are further complicated by an
interesting love affair, in which the inter
est. of the old and young men collide.
l'.efore the play ends Uncle Jason wit
nesses a hot football game. The element
of danger which enters the game appeals
strongly to him and he is convened mio
a pronounced footfall enthusiast. This
conversion brings about a happy settle
ment, with the nephew ahead in the love
affair.
W. "il. Irwin '98 wrote the farce. The
characters of Uncle Jason, James Keats
Poole and Mrs. Gwendolyn Fernald were
excellently drawn. The football proposal
in the last act was ._ c.ever idea and was
skillfully enacted by Miss V. H.arne and
George Francis.
Walter Mcintosh took the part of Uncle
Jason most acceptably. He has had con
siderable experience in amateur perform
ances, and was thus enabled to correctly
curry out the idea of the author.
Miss Hallie Hyde as Mrs. Gwendolyn
Fernald and Mcintosh appeared on the
Stage frequently together and were al
ways equal to the dramatic situations.
Miss Hyde made up well and her voice is
under excellent control.
Georg* H. Francis took the part of
Harry Hunter, the Varsity hero. He
made the most of his character, and was
especially good in the football proposal.
Miss Florence Jones as Bessie Brooks, an
impulsive -'prep.," made a good im
pression, as did also Miss M. "Main as
Sft A Nenton of San Francisco.
Th. minor characters were all well en
acted. Much of the success of the per
formance is due Mrs. Lannstroff of the
Columbia School, who recently coached
the actors. Tbe cast of characters is as
follows:

SAN JOSE, Cal., April 29.â Kenneth
Frary, a young man residing in East San
Jose, was arrested to-day on a charge of
obtaining a gold watch worth $20 from
Frank G.fford upon false pretenses. Gil
ford claims that he traded bis watch to
Frary for a lump of metal represented to
be gold, melted in order to destroy the
identity of tbe original jewelry. Frary is
said to have claimed that a jeweler passed
upon the metal as genuine gold, and al
though it was worth more he was willing
to let it go for the watch because Gifford
was his friend.
After the trade Gifford weighed the glit
tering mass, and according to the stand
ard value of gold it was worth $..52. He
then had it tested and it proved to be cop
per and brassâ of no value at all.
Frary was released on $100 bail pending
his trial, and later the case was dismissed
on the defendant paying the. costs.

Resolutions of Thanks to Redwood

Adjournment.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 29.â
After yesterday's outing and last night's
pleasures of the dance at tbe Pavilion the
delegates to the twentieth Grand Parlor,
Native Sons, were ready this morning to
engage earnestly in the work of the session.
The grand president presented the fol
lowing letter to the session:
San- Francisco. April 28, 1897.
Henry C. Gesford, Grand President X. S. G. W.
My Dear Sir: It has just occurred, to me
that it would be a nice thing lor the Grand
I Parlor to follow the example of the G. A. R. at â¢
| Salinas and Indorse the p. an of the Lincoln
i Monument League to raise tun is by popular
I subscription all over the Pacific Coast, said
monument to De erected In Golden Gate Park.
We also purpose Inaugurating a school Lin
coln day all over the country. On the 28th of
May we propose decorating our schooinouses,
and singing songs and reciting appropriate
selections, thus making Lincoln nay a his- i
toric object-lesson day for our chlllreti.
As you know the G. A. R. is wholly non
partisan, hence the public can be assured that
the Lincoln League has not the remotest con
nection with any party organization. Indeed,
by looking at the composition of our advisory
board on this letterhead, you need no further
guarantee.
Our State encampment indorsed the league
and recommended It to the attention oi the
various posts. Can you not do the same, so
that we can officially communicate to your
various parlors, through your grand presi
dent to be elected? Fraternally,
W. .v. Stone,
President Lincoln Monument League, 322
Haight street, Pan Francisco.
In connection with the foregoing the
following resolution was introduced and
referred to the committee on state of the
order:
Whereas, The Grand Army of the Republic
of tul* State has formed an association lor the
purpose of raising funds by popular subscrip
tion wherewith to erect a monument to the
memory of Abraham Lincoln in Golden Gate
Park; therefore be it
Retolved, By this Grand Parlor, that -we
heartily indorse the objects of this patriotic
movement, and, having confidence in the
loyalty, fraternity and integrity of the
G. A. R. as sponsors of this movement, we
hereby authorize our grand president to for
ward, through his office, such information
and official business as he may deem neces
sary for the best interests of ourorder and the
furthering of the patriotic intention of the
Lincoln Monument League.
There was discussion to-day on the
proposition to extend the order to other
States than California. Of course, only
those who were born in this Stato will be
eligible to membership, but the fact was
recognized that many prominent young
people of Californian birth have emigrated
to ad joining and distant States, and it is
proposed to bring them Into tbe fold and
recognize their existence as native Cali
fornians.'
The following resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That it shall be and is hereby made
the duty of the deputy grnnd president, who
shall be Appointed by the incoming grand
president, to collect and destroy every copy of
the secret work iv his district on or before
July, 1897, the secret work to be herealter
known as the unwritten work of the order.
Resolved, That there shall be added to the
obligation a prohibition against printing,
writing or inditing any portion of the secret
work. â¢
The following resolution was offered by
H. C. Lichtonberger of Ramona Parlor
No. 109, and adopted by the* parlor:
Whereas, Under the existing laws of our
State the National Guard of the State < f Cali
fornia is compelled to turn out in parade but
one day in the year, to wit, on the 4th day of
July ; and wtiereas.we believe the State Govern
ment of California should take a more promi
nent recognition of Admission day than by
the simple declaration of a legal holiday,
be It . "
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Grand
Parlor that a measure be introduced in the
next Legislature providing lor the turning out
ln parade of our State militia on the 9th of
September of each year.
The committee consisting of C. M. E.
MiLauehlin. J. W. F. Diss and Finlay
Cook, appointed for the purpose of ex
plaining to the members of Mission Par
lor No. 38 the reasons for the action of the
Grand Parlor in refusing to purchase
stock in the Mission Parlor building, sub
mitted a report setting forth tbat the legal
right to make such purchase did not exist.
- Guy P. Huil -was elected by a unani
mous vote as one of the. seven grand
trustees. Mr. Hull is a resideni of Red
wood City and his election was in accord
ance with the custom of electing one
member of the board from Hie town
where the Grand Parlor meets. Balloting
for the remaining five trustees followed.
The contest was vigorous. Spirited nom
inating hpeechea were made.
Louis Byington and Joseph Hawkins,
of San Francisco, FranK Saoicbi of Los
Angeles, and F. A. Cutler of Eureka each
received a majority of all the votes cast,
and four more trustees â making six of the
seven â were declared elected.
There were some exciting incidents jnst
before the vote was taken for the seventh
member of the board. Many of the dele
gates had gone to dinner, supposing that
all tbe trustees were cnoscn. . Runners
were sent to the hotels, restaurants and
barber-shops to summon the absentees.
Delegate** resisting the summons were
(alien by main force to the Alharabra.
There were three candidates running al
most even. "When the ballots were counted
it was found that no choice bad resulted,
ana recess.was taken until 8 o'clock. â¢_'*"-
During the session to-day the Dinkel
speii resolution for a special per capita tax
for the grand organizer was defeated.
The committee to whom was referred
the reports of Grand Secretary Lunstedt
and Grand Treasurer Martin reported that
the examination had been made as di
rected and tbat the reports were found
correct.
The election of R. C. Rust of Amador as
grand orator is regarded in onejaense as
quite an achievement for John F. Davis,
who managed Rust's campaign with skill
and earnestness, and made an effective
nominating speech..
Ed J. Harris, M. B. Merritt and P. E.
Zabala have be_.un the campaign in behalf
of Salinas for the Grand Parlor of 1899.
Tbe praises of Salinas have been sounded
in the ears of many delegates, and numer
ous promises of support at Nevada City in
1898 have been secured.
. Balloting for the seventh grand trustee
was resumed immediately after the parlor
convened for the evening session. H. R.
McNoble of Stockton received 95 votes
and was delared elected. The parlor pro
ceeded to the installation of the newly
elected grand officers. Clark, the grand
president, being absent, was installed by
proxy.
Resolutions were adopted thanking the
generous people of Rid wood City for the
kindness and public spirit manifested in
the reception and entertainment of the
Native Sons and the "Grand Parlor then
adjourned. When the delegates lilea out
of the Alhambra to form for the march to
Germania Hall, wbere the banquet was
served, tue crowds on Main ana Bridge
streets were dense. The turnout of visi
tors and residents was the largest of the
week and the enthusiasm of the multitude
attained the highest degree.
An exception was made to the usual rule
of presenting the retiring grand president
with a jewel, and Mr. Gesford to-night
was presented with a gold watch and
chain. Tbe presentation speech was made
to the retiring grand president by Joseph
Sprout. Joseph F. Coffey was toastma*
ter and responses were made to these
toasts: *.'*;.'" â¢"â

"County Parlors," Henry Hall; "Native
Daughters," Frank Kerrigan; "Santa
Rosa," C. O. Dunbar; "State of Califor

The banquet bad go and snap about it
from the start, and the enthusiasm could
hardly be restrained until the regular
order was reached. The affair took the
turn of a patriotic demonstration with
many grand tributes to the State of Cali
fornia in particular. The speeches of Ges
ford and Coombs touched the top mark of
eloquence and evoKed cheers from the
throng of banqueters.
In addition to the regular toasts

RECOVERING FROM
WOUNDS AND SHOCK
Victims of the Sanger
Maniac Are Out of* :
Danger.
Only the Charred Trunk of
Brooks' Body Is
Found. '
An Acquaintance Tells of the
Peculiarities of the Love-
Crazed Man.
FRESNO, Cal., April 29.â The condi
tion of Mrs. David Quails, who, with her
daughter, had such a terrible experience
on Tuesday night north of Sanger with
James Brooks, was much improved to
day. She has recovered from the shock,
and the gunshot wound in her arm is de
veloping favorable symptoms. Dr. Jacobi
of Centerville, who is attending her, con
siders her to be out of danger. Miss
Quails' injury was of no serious conse
quence.
Upon a moment's reflection the deeds of
the insane lover on that terrible night re
solve themselves into one of the most
tragic episodes in criminal history.
The mad 'love for the girl which had
been entirely unreciprocated, prompting
the ii-.'iidi-h resolution of Brooks; his
attempt first to set fire to the house in
which the family were asleep to consign
them to a horrible death ; then his stealthy
entrance into the borne at the dead hour
of night to wreak destruction of life, and
lastly the manner in which he brought
about his own end, all combine to show
that none other but a maniac could enter
tain such awful thoughts.
The experience which Mrs. Quails and
her daughter passed through was one. of
greatest terror. Concerning the man
Brooks, something was learned of bis
character by Tue Call correspondent to
day.
Al "Woodward, now of this city, but
formerly deputy constable at Sanger, near
which place the tragedy was enacted,
knew the man probably better than any
one else did in the county.
"Brooks was a peculiar fellow," said
Woodward, "and one would never have
thought that be nad the nerve to do what
he did on Tuesday night. He was of a re
tiring disposition and given very much to
sulking. He spoke very little and was
very suspicious of everybody. His com
plexion was dark, unusually so, and bis
character was well represented by bis
color. He was a hard-working man and
never drank to amount to anything, but
would occasionally gamble.
"I always considered the fellow a thor
ough coward â one who would be afraid of
the dark. Brooks was a distant relative
of the Quails, and it was for this reason
that they put up with bis unreasonable
attentions to Miss Neoma more than they
should have done."
All that was left of the remains in the
ruins of the barn where the body of
Brooks was cremated was the trunk. The
head and limbs bad been burned com
pletely to ashes. Bits of the charted
flesh were picked up. and placed in the
coffin with the trunk of the body. The
remains were interred in Mountain View
cemetery.
Coroner Long, who is also a doctor,
picked up the pieces of the remains and
had some difficulty in segregating them
from the bones of an animal which had
been lying on tho ground directly where
Brooks had shot himself on the hay mow.
Miss Neoma Quails, for the desperate
love of whom Brooks was spurred to
murder, is reported to be engaged to be
married to Frank Hutchings, who works
on a neighboring farm. After the maniac's
nerve gave way and he expressed bis sor
row for having hurt her, he said he "could
not bear to see her go with Frank Hutch
ings."
The Call's account of the tragedy this
morning was the only accurate one in the
San Francisco papers.
TRESS OFFICIALS COX FUR.
Crusade Against Chines* Lotteries to
Ite Inaugurated.
FRESNO, CaI., April 29.â City Trus
tees bad a conference with the Police
Department to-day in regard to enforce
ment of ordinances in this city. The
meeting was held behind closed doors,
but it is understood that an expressed de
sire of the Councilmen that the officers
inaugurate a crusade against the Chinese
lotteries was favorably received. These
lotteries have been running for several
years in Fresno and off and on half
hearted steps have been taken to close
them. Nothing more than a temporary
observance of the law was ever effected.
It is said that the police officers assured
the trustees that th y would use every
effort to stop the iliicit games.
Of course the authorities have odds to
work against. The places where the
drawings are held are so well barricaded
that interference on the part of the offi
cers has always been a difficult matter.
The Chinese are very cunning and sly,
and it is not easy to catch them selling
tickets. Five or s'x games have been
running in Chinatown and have been a
great evil, many white people, and even
women and children, patronizing them.

A FIERCE FIGHT
Murderer Lugo Is Taken
by a Brave Pomona
Officer.
Night Battle in Which the
Desperado Tries to Use
a Dirk.
A Large Reward Offered for the
Criminal, Who Is Taken to
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cm.., April 29.â A*
criminal by the name of Lugo,, alias
Frank Leveda, who has been sought lor
by officers in many parts of California, is
now in the county jail here. Lugo was
arrested last night near Pomona by
Deputy Sheriff Slanker, and the tempor
ary charge against the prisoner is petty
larceny. Lugo made a desperate resist
ance against bis arrest and had bis head
well pummeled for bis rashness.
The prisoner is wanted by the Sheriff
and Supervisors of Mono County and tbe
Governor of the State for no less a crime
than that of murder, committed in 1b"92,
wben he shot in cold blood a man named
T. H. Leahy, employed on the ranch of J.
N. Evans.
Lugo was captured by the Mono County
officers, but escaped from them, stole a
horse and disappeared. The Supervisors
of Mono County offered $300 reward.
Evans, the employer of the murdered
man, offered $600 and Governor Markbam
set aside $200 for Lugo's capture.
It was learned that Lugo was in this
part of the State, and the officers began
to look out for hÂ»m. He was finally cap
tured at San Bernardino, but again he
escaped. Later he stole a racehorse at
Fullerton, in Orange County, valued at
$300, and has since been living in the foot
hills.
Last night he was located definitely at a
place where he was visiting. Lugo had
his horse in the barn and was in the
house when the officer arrived. Blanker
entered the barn, removed the horse to
another place and took his stand just out
side the door to await the coming of his
man. Lugo entered the door carrying in
his band a fourteen-inch dirk-knife. As
he entered Blanker struck him to the
ground. The officer then proceeded to
handcuff Lugo, when he attempted to rise.
Seeing that the man was about to get the
better of him, the officer, having dropped
his own gun, drew Lugo's from his scab
bard and hit him twice more, thus over
powering him.
Sheriff Hays of Mono County has been
notified of the capture and will send offi
cers to take the prisoner north. Deputy
Sheriff .flanker's capture is the talk of the
officers and the town, and he will get the
$1100 offered for Lugo's capture.

Claims to Be the Victim of His Former
Wife's Hatred.
LOB ANGELES, Cat,, April 29.â Robert
McGregor, a newspaper man, claims to be
the victim of the hatred of his former
wife. The custody of the child was award
ed to the mother. McGregor was of
â¢'loitering" habits. b?ing at one time con
fined at Highlands Asylum for imbriety.
After remaining there for several months
he was released. He now claims that he
is never allowed to visit the child, and to
day he petitioned the court to set aside
certain times when he may be allowed
such privileges. Mrs. McGregors attor
ney contended that he is not a fit person
into whose care the child can with safety
be intrusted for even a few hours.
Judge . Smith deprecated the circum
stances which caused such a condition of
affairs and advised the father and mother
to come to some amicable settlement of
the matter, without the intervention of
the law. The matter is not yet settled.

SICE FOIST OF LAW.
Lot Angeles Incendiary Withes to Re
tract His Confession. - â 
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 29.â A nice
point of law was raised in department 1 of
the Superior Court to-day. The story of
the burning of John Baxters house at
Duarte and the subsequent confession of
Ezra Cokanour is still fresh in the public
mind. It now seems thai Ezra wishes he
had not confessed. By his attorney he
has moved to set aside the information
upon which he ie to be tried.
He claims he never had any examina*
tion before the magistrate who held him
to answer to the Superior Court, and that
the law requires that such an examina
tion shall be held. On tbe other band,
the District Attorney claims that the
â¢â  written confession which Cokanour made,
â  coupled with tbe fact that he waived his
j rights, fulfilled the requirements of the
! law respecting such examination. The
I matter was taken under advisement.

Ingels, an orchardist, wbo was injured in
a railway collision near Santa Clara, about

they favored awarding Ingels a lew thou
sand dollars less. The trial lasted seven
days and was remarkable in that, al
though judgment was sought for $75,000,
noi a legal objection, was made to any of
the evidence offered by either side.

and one child. Since the accident be has

wealthy orchardist, to recover $1281 25 on
the assignment of Dr. William T. Mizner

bringing in a verdict for $750.
The claim was stubbornly contested, as
the defense contended tbat Dr. Mizner
tendered his services and then failed to
benefit Sylvester Newhali, wboat the time
had a stroke of apoplexy. Dr. Mizner
claimed that be saved Newhall's life and
that he performed the services at the re

FAMILY JAR AT STOCKTON.
A Neglected Wfe Knocks a Cigarette
. Out of Her Husband's Mouth
With a Bullet.
1 STOCKTON, Cal., April 29.â Shortly
before 8 o'clcck this evening the police
patrol wagon was called to the residence
of Frederick C. Rothenbush, near the
c corner of Oak and Stanislaus streets, on
account of a shooting that nearly cost the
t life of young Rothenbush.
For some time past, on account of his
neglect of his young wife, who is quite
| wealthy, and the daughter of D. L.
Lawrence, a former deputy sheriff, there
has been a coolness between the couple.
Some time ago a man named Maracci
accused Rothenbush of alienating the
i affections of his wife, a buxom brunette,
; but the affair was quieted and nothing
'< more was heard of the matter. Rothen-
J bush has of late been more circumspect
in his behavior, but last night stayed out
all night.
To-night he attempted to enter his
home and bis father-in-law was there.
Rothenbush tried to force the frontdoor
open, but Lawrence was in the way, and
j the son-in-law was nndutiful enough to
: strike his wife's father in the eye. The
' former said he only wanted to get' some
underclothing, and accomplished this
; much of his object, but as he was leaving
the Louse his wife picked un his 32 caliber
I pistol and took a shot at him. Luckily
the bullet only knocked the cigarette out
of his mouth and the powder burned his
'. cheek. The police were summoned and
brought both Lawrence and Rothenbush
; to the station, where the first named
wanted his son-in-law put under bonds to
keep the peace.

VANCOUVER, B. C, April 29.-The
British Columbia Legislature, amid ap

both the Government and opposition
joined, have decided . to send . a memorial
to the Governor of Canada praying that if
Canada should decide to join the British

Following this up, an act bas been
passed forbidding the' employment of
Chinese or Japanese underground under
penaltyâ just in time, too, as many min

Orientals to cross their boundaries and
many have been sent back with threats.
The British Columbia Legislature to-day

ing up mining claims in British Colum
bia. The act reads tbat no one shall be
entitled to a free miner's license enabling
him to locate precious metal claims unless
he is 18 years of age or over and is born a
British subject, or unless he files a de
claration of intention to become a British
subject.
This will embody a policy of retaliation
to the alien labor policy of the United
States. The vote of 19 to 10 was not a
party one. It was bitterly opposed by the
opponents of. the bill, who claimed that
its passage would tend to restrict Ameri
can labor and enternrise, which had done
so much to develop the British Columbia
mining country.
British Columbians as a whole are
against the measure as a change of policy
in the Government, and believe the act
will be repealed before a year.

WITH DRUIDICAL HONORS
The Services That Were Held ;
Over the Remains iof the -\
Late Philip Rohrb-c er.
A Multitude Ass.mb.s to Pay the
Last Tributes to the Memory of
the Supreme Arch.
The funeral of the late Philip Rohr
bacher, who at the time of his death was
the supreme arch of Supreme Grove of
the United Ancient Order of Druids of the
United States, took place yesterday after
noon from the family res deuce, 310 Fulton
street. . :/:
The house of mourning was crowded
with relatives, friends aud officers of the
Grand Grove, and when all had assembled
within the darkened chamber the Rev.
Julius Fuendehng, pastor of St. Marks'
German Evangelical Lutheran Church,
offered up a prayer in the German
language, and in the same language con
ducted the burial service of that church.
This over, the casket was carried to the
hearse by the following-named, who were
the active pall- bearers: Supreme Repre
sentatives George W. Lovie and E. L.
Wagner, representing tLe Supreme Grove
<i Druid-; Past Noble Grand Arches
Judge George H. Bahrs and Henry A.
Chase, representing the Grand Grove of
California; Past Supreme Arch Louis G.
Schord and Past Arch John Hutton, rep
resenting Hartnagle Chapter; 0. H. Hess
and J. Simons, representing San Joaquin
Grove; C. W. Bicklord, past grand, and
J. H. Farwell, representing Charity Lodge
No. 6, I. O. 0. F., and Gus Pohlman and
D. W. Farren, representing the Veteran
Firemen. â ", .
Louis F. Dur.end. past noble grand arch,
at the request of the Supreme Grove,
delivered a eulogy over the body, in the
course of which he said: "Philip. Rohr
bacher was an honest man, who was ever
ready to assist those in need. , On occa
sions of this solemn character it some
times happens that :ne curtain is drawn
to hide that which should not be . exposed
to the public gaze. On this occasion there
ib no need to draw the curtain, for there is
nothing to conceal. The life of Philip
Rohrbachcr was pure, it was stainless."
His remarks addressed to the widow
and son and daughters of the deceased,
were most eloquent, and affected nearly
every one of the vast assemblage to tear*.
The remains were taken to the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery, where the remainder
of the order's burial service was conducted
by Noble Grand Arch Devoto, and all that
was mortal of Philip Rohrbacher was in
cinerated.
SAM JOAQUIN VALLEY CROPS.
Grain Is Suffering in Some Plac s for
Want of Ram, but a Good Yield
..__,. Is Expected.
MODESTO. Cal., April 29.-The crops
of this county as a whole are not suffer
ing from lack of rain and can," stand the
present weather for some time before be
ing damaged, but if dry hot winds come
the damage will, bee irreparable. Crops
generally are better than usual.
On. the west sloe of the San Joaquin
River they are the best for many yeais.
Rain is needed more there than elsewhere
in the county. Fruit crops are considered
excellent. Rain would >be acceptable and
do immense good, but we can get along
without it for a couoie of 'weeks yet. . '.- *_â¢..
MERCED, Cal., Aprii : 29.â _T_m recent
warm weather has done considerable '
damage to ctod prospects. During the I
past few days the weather has been ;
slightly cooler and the growinâ¢ grain
has picked up somewhat, yet the
farmers are not as encouraged as
they were earlier in the reason, and at
present tte prospects only give assurance
of about half a crop iv this locality. A
little more rain at this time would make a
material difference in crop possibilities.
MADEIIA, Cat... April 29.â The warm
weather, accompanied by not winds,
which prevailed here a week aero did but
little damage, if any, to the grrin crop.
In that oection of the country along the
foothill region the pram is exceptionally
fine and well advanced.
The crop on summer-follow land ii prac
tically assured. The only grain suffering
is the late sowing, whicu with even a. ligci
rain will come out all right.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Arr.l 20â The
CONSTABLE McCOY PYLE AND WIFE OF VENTURA.
Mr. McPyle was slain as he slept by his false friend, Ed McCamlsh. Back of
the murder, which was as cold-blooded a one as has ever been recorded in the
annals of California crime, is the reported infatuation of the accused murderer for
the wile of the Constable. .
dry hot weather is greatly interfering with
the filling of wheat ie this county. In
dications are that the yield will be cut
more than one-third* from what it
promised to be three weeks ago. It still
shows plenty of greenness and the heads
look large and prosperous, but in the
language of the farmer it is "ruining."

Just As Soon Be Dead
Are the words of a man who is -
â¢ desperateâ man who has tried
many so-called cures, doctors,
and with no good result.
Now, if you are in just this
state, suppose you make a last
effort, if only for the sake of try- _
ing. Don't put too much confi-
; v:': dence in this, yet give it a fair
trial.
A fair trial is all that is asked
for the great Hudyan.- 10,000
men have given Hudyan a fair
trial, and these 10,000 men are
now cured men. Ask them if
they would just as soon be dead.
They would laugh at you. They
. are enjoying themselves, living
happy, joyous lives of hope and
constant and ever- increasing
strength, having the_ bounce
and brace, the vim and ambition
of; vigorous manhood. This is
what you may expect when you
use the discovery of the big doc-
tors of Hudson Medical fame.
HuJyan can be had only from
the doctors of Hudson. No one
else can give you Hudyan. You
should consult these doctors or
write for Hudyan Circulars and
Testimonials.
Maps! Perils! Perlais!
You are suffering from a con- J
tracted Blood Disease. If it is in
the first, secondary or tertiary
- state you ought to let the Hudson
doctors use their 30- Day Cure. ;
It does the work lastingly, and
well too. No scars, no marks,
no mercury bones. Write for
Circulars or consult Hudson doc-
tors. V

Mrs. H.len Gardener Reads Her Cele
brated Pjp.r Entitled
'"Heredity.''*
Yesterday's was quite the most unevent
ful of the sessions of the Woman's Con
gress held thus far this season. There
were no brilliant papers. Each address,
however, stowed tbat the writer was
thoroughly familiar with the subject dealt
.with in his or her -paper, and. moreover,
possessed the happy faculty of expressing
themselves clearly and concisely. Many
- theories were advanced, but, unfortu
nately, no conclusions reached. There
were no aphorism, no brilliant epigram
to punctuate the long papers that had
. naught that was new to propose.
There were no discussions. Each speak
er's theory was quietly accepted, wltn now
and then a voice of praise raised in its
favor.
The Brahmacharin was present and was
one of those who rose to add his mite of
wisdom to the session. There seems to be
an insatiable desire on the part of the
audiences at these congresses to hear the
impassioned voice of the Hindoo sage.
His presence on the . stage is always
greeted with applause and his remarks
listened to with rapt attention. This high
caste Brahmin is sure to become the idol
not only of that frivolous young person
known as the matinee girl, but the morn
sedate congress women.
He certainly is an inspired speaker.
When moved by his subject to an eloquent
outburst his voice trembles, his long lithe
figure quivers and bis right band points

Brahmacbarin loses all idea of the rapid
flight of time, and yesterday, lost in the
flowery depths of his oratory had the bell
rung on nim to remind nim that his
allotted minutes had elapsed.
Each succeeding session rinds the hall
more and more crowded. It seems a case
of those who have been before bringing
their fiiends and those friends in turn
bringing their relatives. Yesterday, to
accommodate the crowd, chairs were
ranged to the very front of the stage, and
yet the walls were lined with a fringe of
women â young aud pretty, old and hand
some and otherwise. It was a most con
siderate audience. When Mrs. Swift, the
president of the Women's Association,
came to tbe front and asked the ladies to
remove their bats there was not a feather
tipped head in all the vast assemblage
two minutes after her request had been
made.
However, it was a singularly impassive
â¢ audience. But in spite of the reserve
there was a tinge of expectancy in the air.
, Every one was repressing ail emotions,
saving all their enthusiasm for the even
i ing, when Helen Gardener should read
I her widely celebrated paper, "Heredity."
The only emotion allowed to ruffle that
even calm was when Miss Margaret
i Sweeney appeared. Miss Sweeney is a
: remarkably handsome girl, and if there is
j one thing this congress of women ad
. mires it is a pretty creature â sex femi
j nine. There will probably have to be an
aftermath to this congress, in which the
; women will have to be taught not to lose
j their handkerchiefs, their feather boas
| and their purses. There are several of
j these articles awaiting owners at th.9 sec
i retary's table.
THURSDAY'S SESSION.
â  Interesting Papers on Mental Train
ing Read at the Woman's
Congress.
Mental training was the subject of all
the papers read yesterday at the Woman's
Congress. All the papers were remark
ably well written, and were followed with
close attention by the large audience as
sembled.
Professor C. B. Bradley was the first
speaker of the afternoon. Bis paper was
a practical view of "the study of history
a_i a development of the heart and im- ,
agination." Professor Bradley's paper
j was in part as follows:
Two distinct things may be proposed as ends
ln the study of history. One is ethical â a dis
; cipline of the heart and imaginationâ the
j other is intellectual and scientific, lhe end
I of one discipline is wisdom and character ; the
end of the other is knowledge and skill. It
! may be too much to say that these two ends
cannot be pursued together.
The tcientlfic end is possible only for
students oi a certain maturity of mind. Its
higher sweep ii attained only cow and then.
by some great master. But the other needs no
; special eve, no special training. It Is within
I tne reach of all who bring to the study com
i mon intelligence enougn to understand the
j record and the common interest ue all feel in
; human struggle and achievement.'-
As for maturity, it would seem that there is
i sometning in the very constitution of child
j hood and youth which specially fits theÂ«e ages
to receive these lessens of life ; specially pre
disposes them to catch tne contagion of bo Ola
cnaracter and heroic act. on. Heroes theie
doubtless are all about us, and uo generous
soul ever lived or needed to live wimout lis
hero-worsntps. But the lmpresslveness ofthe
'â  vision is everything in tnis case. History has
; here its special opportunity and advantage.
; Nowhere uo heroes stand on such pedestals,
nowhere do they loom up with such imposing
> power as wnen seen through the mist* of ages
et the end of a long vista of history. All must
i agree with me in recognizing the power which
| history has to uplift the heart and the mind
: of men.
There is no worthy living outside of the
great precept, "Whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things arc of good report, if there
be any virtue, and if there be any praise,
think on these things."
Mrs. Emma Payne Erskine followed
Professor Bradley with a paper on "The
Deadline of Civilization." Among other
things Mrs. Erskine said:
The old world moves on no longer with the
stately majestic sweep of the ages. It moves
with a rush and a whirl, onward, onward and
ever faster and faster, never resting, never
waiting, never pausing to think.
Poor humanity! : Hurrying ourselves on
through our short span 01 earthly existence,
eager. looking forward to something nnat
tained, and, wheu we nave it, casting it be
hind us to grasp at something still beyond,
until we are launched into eternity with
never a moment for reckoning the whence,
the whither or for what.
We stand on the verge of a new entry and
the demon stands beside us. We look back

ward .own the years and see the barriers he
has set upâ the walls he has builtâ and he Is
here now to draw the "deadline of civilisa
tion" at our very feet.
What cares he for human law? He strides
over It and it becomea null and void. â¢-
What shall we ao with this great question of
the age? What shall we do with Turkey, with
Cuba. Africa, Russia, Asia? Wnat with all the
cruelties ot the day? What shall we do with
the demon who allows all these things to con
tinue â who has drawn before every civiliza
tion of the past the deadline?
There is but one force that can overcome
himâ the law that shall be dispelled in the
w.cnaerful dawning of the light of the perfect
day.
Miss Adeline Knapp's paper. "Just
Mere Literature," wa_ one of the best ef
forts of the afternoon. The lady's paper
in part was as follows:
Education's value of the individual lies not
not so much in what it fits him to enjoy as in
; what it enables him to be to his fellows. Its
j end Is not to qualify a man to make a living,
c but to help him to live. We are apt to think
! of culture as something that distinguishes a
man and sets him apart from his brothers;
I but if culture mÂ»keatuller life it must cer
j tainly manifest in fuller fellowship, ln greater
â¢ capacity for love and usefulness. Liberal
sympatny, broad interest, clear msignt, as
â¢ well as wide outlook, are as real parts of cue
ture as mere scholastic attainments can pos
; sibly be.
It is possible -that some of our economic
j problems hare arisen because in our anxiety
; for material prosperity we have lost sight of
: humanity's hones and fears, joys and sor
rows, beliefs and disbeliefs wrought into our
j universal literature.
The child whose taste receives an early bent
toward the true in literary art will not be
likely to care much for the waste of printed
co mm on p. ace that we call juvenile literature.
There axe a -few modern writers who have
â¢ given us good books lor young people*, but if
j nearly the whole of the so-called children's
books o! to-day could be swept from existence
childhood would be immeasureably better off.
Miss Margaret Sweeney brought the
afternoon session to a close with her paper
|on "English in Secondary Schools."
j Miss Sweeney made an ardent plea for the
| study of grammar and English in the
i public schools. She urged the teachers in
\ the schools to give more attention to com
{ positions, and noted that the day when a
| composition meant an extract irom an en
i cyclopedia had passed. Sue called atten
; tion to the fact tbat correct speech could
\ not be learned in one day, any mora than
j composition, and hoped those studies
I would receive the attention that they de
; served at the bands of our educators.

SPOKE ON HEREDITY.
Evening- Session of the Congress
Crowded to Hear Helen Gar
dener Speak.
Last night was banner night at the
Woman's Congress. Long before tbe
hour of op-ning the street was crowded
with an impatient throng anxious to se
cure the best possible seats. At 8 o'clock
it was impossible to get near the doors.
Helen Gardener's famous paper on
"Heredity" was to be read by the author
ess, hence the crowds.
The first paper was Professor J. M.
Stillman's "The Essential Character and
Purpose of Higher Education." He said:
"Were it possible for us to trace the
ideals tbat have been dominant in the
educational systems of the long line of
civilizations which have risen and passed
away during the life of our globe we should
certainly be in possession of most valu
able clews to the causes that conspire to
produce their greatness and to those
which contributed to their decay. For in
the educational system of any civilization
are emphasized and* developed the ideas
and ideals which the leading minds of the
time and of the races consider the most
essential to the development of the indi
vidual and most important to the service
of the needs of tbe State and of its future
strenctn and permanence.
"Tbe higher education is the effort to fit
roost perfectly for the highest responsi
bilities of life. It must attempt, there
fore, to develop to its highest capacity
the latent powers of thought and action
in the individual, and to teach him to
utilize these powers to the utmost in the
direction of good influence and useful ser
vice.
"Mere knowledge is not power; the abil
ity to use knowledge rationally is power, '
but even then but latent power. T c wish
and the will to use it are necessary to \
make that latent power actual. Given j
knowledge, the ability and the will to use ;
it and the desire to use it in the best in
terests of mankind, and we have the ideal
result of the higher education.
"It is not alone in the universities that
the higher education may be attained.
Many a man or woman has attained by
tno home fireside and in the world's
school a higher education than many col
lege graduates have acquire! under the
more favorable conditions of the best uni
versities. &_____Â£
"Though our systems of higher educa
tion but imperfectly attain the ends they
aim for. though opinions differ as to the
best subject matter and methods, we must
ever be mindful that our higher institu
tions of learning have ever in view the
welfare of humanity through the influ
ence on the individual, and that such as
they are they represent the conservators
of the highest ideals of our age and na
tion, and in their permanence and pro
gressive developm-nt l ethe highest hope*
for the future prosperity of humanity.
Mrs. Helen Gardener was then "intro
duced, and was enthusiastically received.
MES. GARDENER'S PAPER.
It has always been thought a charming trait
ln woman that she so easiiv "conforms," that
â he thlnxs and believes anything that her
father, brother, lover or husband thinks and
believes, or wants her to suppose that be does.
And it is not until woman comes out from
under cover of conventional usage and says
"I don't want to do this" and "I don't believe
in that" of her own volition and thought, not
until then wili she be fit or strong enough to
create and mold characters that aha. l grow
Into free menâ who -hall be the victims
of neither their enemies nor of themselves
because of their feeble or their vicious inheri-
lance. â¢â¢,>.
I am far more accustomed to talk upon the
topic that has been allotted to me before
scientific bodies or to practical students of
heredity, anthropology, biology- and, kindred
subjects and therefore I may possibly say
things that will sound dogmatic from the
point of view of those who have not made a
special study of the subject. 1 shall not mean
anything I may say to seem either dogmatic or
harsh, only earnest, and perhaps a short cut
to facts we are to face.
1 fear I shall strike a less pleasant note than
has been struck by those who have preceded
me. who have so generally dealt with ideals or
who have sung the praise side of the song.
My theme is scientific. It deals with demon
strable facts, and it goes back of even the kin-
'. oergarten. __!_J3ffi"
If, therefore, I should say some things that
, seem harsh or cruel, remember that the sur
geon's knife cuts because it hopes to strike
] the root of the disorder. Remember that sci
entific facts are not always pleasant, but for
all that I hold that it is wise for us to face and
understand them.
There have been a good many kinds of con
gresses of women in tne past tew years, since it
has been granted tbat women have a right to
meet and discuss any topics whatever, and
since it has* been recognized that woman has
the capacity to think for herself and the dignity
and the poise to express ncr thought in pub
i lie, without finding it necessary either to
i take ref uge behind her male relatives or to
' become masculine herself in the process.
But ln all of these congresses, previous to
! the one held recently in Washington, a con-
I gress of and for mothers had never been
| thought necessary. And that was the first
j racial congress ever held, and it was the
munificence of a California woman that made
that-congress possible. It has been freely ad
mitted by mcc and women a. ike that there is
', still much for women to learn from each other
| through mutual effort and consultation upon
any and all subj.cts. So far as I have been
I able to discover, it hss been taken for granted
that since the beginning of the world all
women have known enough to bs mothers,
i and that it was, therefore, wholly superfluous
c for the mothers of the race to convene, as
| iuch, and confer with eacu other about those
I topics which are of the first and most vital im
i portance to humanityâ that is to say, about
i her functions, duties and moral responsibil
ities as both the creator and the cradle of
mankind. Neither dense ignorance, deform
ity of body or mind, ill health nor criminality
could disqualify her for the one "sphere"
which all men joined in asserting was hers by
d vine right and in calling holy and lofty.
Think 01 the absurdity of the proposition.
Think of the sacrilegel Tnink of the uncon
scious indignity!
* Poets, statesmen, novelists and artists have
for ages untold striven to eclip.e eacn other
' ln the eulogies of motherhood. On the stage
' nothing is so sure of rapturous applause as is
' some touching oil of sacrifice which baa
â  reached lis climax in a mother's love
' wherein she has yielded all to shield, to pro
: teet er to belter tbe condition of husband or
child. From the crude, sentimental songs
I which adv.s? the son to "stick to your
I mother when her hair turns gray," through
the various phases of maternal love and devo-
I tion or sacrifice in the "-.amllle" type of
j thought, on and np to the loftiest touches ln
f art and literature, there is alike the effort to
< celebrate the power, the potentiality and the
i beauty of motherhood, and to stimulate the
i sentiments of gratitude and love and admira
| tion for and emulation of the Ideal depicted.
: But through it all. in the building and matur
| ing of this Ideal, there runs ever and always
the one thread ot thought, that self-sacrifi-e,
self-abnegation and self-effacement are the
grandest attributes of maternity; that in
order to be a perfect, an ideal wife and
mother the woman must be sunk, the idi
viduai immolated, the ego subjected.
To a degree and ln a sense that Is, of course,
true, for the willingness to go down to tne
c gales of death, to face its possibilities for long,
. weary months, to know that suffering and to
; fear that death stands as a sure and Inevitable
: host at the end of a long journeyâ to know
this and to be willing to face it for the sake of
others is a heroism, a bravery, a self-abnega
j tion so infinitely above and beyona the small
I heroism of camp or battle-field that compari-
I son is almos t a sacrilege.
The condemned man upon whom the death
i watch has been set, who cannot hope for ex-
I ecutive clemency, who Is helpless ln the
| hands of absolute power, still knows .that
although death mar be sure physical suffering
I is unlikely, or, at the worst, will be but briei;
but he alone stands in tbe position to know,
even to a degree, the nervous strain, the
mental anguish, the unthinking but uncon
trollable panics of flesh and blood and nerve
j which woman faces at the behests of love and
': maternity andâ alas that it can be true!â at
! the behests of sex power and financial de
pendence.
But when we study anthropology and her
edity we come to realise the indisputable facts
that her love, her physical heroism, and her
bravery, linked with her political and
financially subject status, have cast a
! physical blight, a moral snadow and
i a mental threat upon the world.
| Then we cease to clap quite so vigorously at
the theater, and our tears or smiles are
mingled with mental reservations, and a sigh
lor a loitier Ideal for the meaning nnd the pur-
J pose of maternity than the merely physical
I one that has been depicted as material sacri
; fice to the child and self-abnegation and self-
I subjection. We begin to wonder if much of
j the vice, the crime, the wrong, the insanity,
! the disease, the incompetence and the woe of
the world is not the direct lineal descendant
lof tnis V very self-debasement of the
I individual character of women in ma
ternity. We begin to wonder li an
unwilling, a forced, or a supinely yield
ing (and thereiore uot self-controlled) a sub
ject motherhood, in short, is not respon
sible to the race ior the weak, the de
formed, the depraved, the double-deal
ing. pretense-Boated natures which curse
the world with failures, with disease,
with war, with insanity and, with crime. We
begin to wonder if, the awful power with
which nature clothes maternity in heredity
does not strike blindly back at the race for the
artificial requirements at the hands of the
producers of that race. We begin to wonder
if mothers do not owe a. higher duty to their
offspring than that oi mere nurse. Webe.in
to wonder if the mother has the moral right to
give her children the inheritance tbat accident
ad subserviency stamp upon body and
mind. We begin to wonder how she dares
face her child and know that she did not fit
herseli by self-development and by- direct,
sincere, firm ana thorough qualifications for
maternity before she dared to assume its
responsibilities. We begin to wonder that
man haa been so slow in learning to read the
message that nature has telegraphed to him in
letters of tire and photographed with terrible
persistency upon the distorted, diseased bod
ies and minds of his children, and upon the
moral imbeciles she has set before him as an
answer to his message of sex dom. nation. Do
you know that there is an* army of 700,000
dependent detectives in this country alone?
Don't you know that this means something to
every mother in this world? Seven hundred
.thousand ioic.d into lite without their birth
right I Seven hundred thousand imbecile,
insane, deaf, dumb, blind and criminal vic
tims of maternal and paternal ignorance.
Stop and tbink of it. Our standing army is
only about 25,000 men these for oar protec
tion; onr detective armyâ these lor
our destruction I Think of it in another way.
There are bnt three citiesâ possibly four nowâ
in America which have a population ot
700,000. If every man, woman and child ln
your city were helpless or criminal still less
than half of our defective population wouid
be represented thereby.
Self- abnegation, subserviency to man.
whether he be father, lover or husband, is the
most dangerous theory that can be taught to
or forced upon her whose character shall moid
the next generation. She has no right to
transmit a nature and a character that is sub
servient, subject, inefficient, undevelopedâ ln
short, a slavish character, which is either
blindly obedient or blindly rebellious, and is,
therefore, in either case, set as in a time.
to prey or to be preyed upon by society in the
future.
If woman is not brave enough personally to
demand and to obtain absolute personal lib
erty ol action, equality of status and entire
control of her great and race-endowing func
tion of maternity she has no right to dare to
â tamp upon a child, and to curse a race, with
the descendants of such m servile, . dwarfed,
a time-and-master serving natnre.
We have been taught that it is an awful
thing to commit murder, to take a human life,
and so of course it is. There is no difference
of opinion on that subject. But do you know
that there are students of anthropology and
heredity whoâ think that it may be even a
more awful thing to thrust, unasked, upon a
human being a life ihat Is handicapped before
he gets It? That it may be a more solemn rev
tponslbility to give than to take a human life?
In ihe one case the murderer Invades personal
liberty and puts a stop to an existence more
or less vai. able and nappy, but at least all
pain is over for that invaded personality. In
the other case, ln giving life, yon invade the
liberty of infinite oblivion and thrust into an
inhospitable world another hum entity to
struggle, to sink, to swim, to suffer, or to en
joy.
Whether the one or the other no mortal
knows, but he surely knows it must contend
sot only with its environment, but with its
heredityâ with itseli. For we ail follow the
line of leaat resistance. Did you ever think
seriously of that? No man is bad simply from
Choice. If you are good and true and lofty it
i* because, all things considered, that is. to you,
the live of least resistance. The parents oi .he
race must make it easy to be good, easy to be
true, hard to be ignoble or criminal, not by
rewards or punishments â those methods have
been weighed and found wantingâ but by the
very blood pulsations that are transmitted
from both parents to tbe children to whom
they take the tremendous responsibility of
giving life.
It is the fashion to repeat, "The hand that
rocks the cradle rules the world." Every one
knows that this is not true in the sense in
which it has always been use.l. It is true, a. as I
in a sense never dreamed of by politician or
publican.
. It is true that tbe subject status of maternity
has ruled and does rule the world, in that it
has beenâ and is to-dayâ the most potent
power to keep the race from lofty achieve
ment. Subject mothers never did and subject
mothers never wilt produce a race of free,
well-poised, liberty-loving, justice-practicing
children.
. Maternity is an awful power. It blindly
strikes back at injustice with a force that is a
fearful menace to mankind. And the race
which is born of mothers wbo are harassed,
bullied, subordinated, or made the victims of
blind passion or power, or of mothers who are
simply too pretty and self-debased to feel
their subject status, cannot fail to continue to
give the. horrible spectacles we have always
had of war, of crime, of vice, of trickery, of
double-dealing, of pretense, of lying, of arro
gance, of subservience, of brutality, of incom
petence, andâ alas ot insanity, ldiocv and
disease added to a fearful and an unnecessary
mortality.
Not long ago a great man, who Is successful
beyond most human units, who is wealthy,
socially to be envied, who enjoys almost ideal
family relations, wbo is in all regards a man
of broad Intellect, of large heart, who is be
loved, successful, powerful, a famous lawyer,
a man ot International renown, long ago this
man said to me, while talking ot life and its
chances, its joys and its burdens and wrongs:
"Well, the more I think of it all, the more I
know, the. more I delve into philosophy and
science, the more I understand life as It is and
es it must be for long years to come, if not for
ever, the more 1 wonder at the sturdy bravery
of those who are less fortunate than I. D_*es
it pay me to live* Would I choose to be born
agai a? Were I to-day unborn, could I be asked
for my vote, knowing all I do of life, would I
vote to come into this worid?
"Taking life at its best estate, are we not as
suming a tremendous risk to thrust it unasked
upon those woo are at least sate trom Its pit
falls? I asked myself these questions very
often," he said. And men he added, hesitat
ingly. "I sometimes think it pays after all. Of
course, since I am here I am bound to make
tbe best of it, but tor all that I am not dead
sure bow I would vote on my birth if I had
the chance to try itâ not quite sure."
"If you are so impressed with life yourself
âyou who are a fortunate, healthy, wealthy,
hat pi. married, successful, famous aud hon
ored man," said 1, "don't yon think it IS a
pretty serious thing to assume the right to
cast that vote recklessly for another human
pawn, who could hardly conceivably stand
your chances in the world?"
â¢'Serious," ho exclaimed, "serious With
the wor.d'i conditions what they are to-day,
with the physical, moral and mental chances to
run, with womanâ the character-forming pro
ducer ofthe raceâ a half-educated subordinate
to masculine domination, it is little short of
madness; it is not far from crime. It is a crime
unless the mother is a physically healthy, a
mentally developed and comprehending, mor
ally clear, strong, vigorous entity who Knows
her personal responsibility in maternity, and,
knowing, dares maintain it." That was his
verdict. Yet it has been the fashion to hold
that the mothers of mankind should not be
tne thinkers of the race. Inceed, in comment
ing upon the congress of representative
women in Chicago at the World's Fair, the
most widely read newspaper on this conti
nent said, editorially: -
-'There is to be a great series of women's
congresses held -at Chicago daring the fair.
The purpose is to illustrate and celebrate the
progress of women. Accordingly there will be
sessions to discuss the achievements of women
in art, authorship, business, science, histrionic
endeavor, law, medicine, ana a variety ot
other activities.
"But, so far as the published programmes
enable us to judge, not one icing is to be done
to show the progress of women as women.
There will be no showing made of an increased
capacity on their part to make homes happier,
to make their husband*. stronger for their
work in the world, to encourage high endeav
ors, to maintain the best standards of honor
and duty, to stimulate, encourage, uplift,
which from the beginning ot civilization bas
been the supreme lemlnlne function. Nothing,
it appears, is to b3 done at tbe congresses to
show that a higher education and a larger
intellectual advancement have enabledwomen
to bear healthier children or to bring tnem up
in a manner more surely tending to make this
a better world to live inâ the noblest of all
work that can De dons by woman.
. "We need no congress to show vi that
women are more thoroughly educated than
once they were, or that they can success uliy
do things once forbidden them. But have
wider culture and wider opportunities made
them better wives and mothers? A congress
which should show that won. d make all men
advocates of still larger endeavors for woman's
advancement. A congress, on the other hand,
wnich assumes tnat the only thing to be cele
brated is an increased capacity to win fame or
money, will teach a disastrously false and
dangerous lesson to our growing girls.", *"
This fatal blunder as to the value of woman's
development, as womanâ quite aside from her
home relationsâ has retaraed the real civiliza
tion and caused to be transmitted (anneces
sarily transmitted) the characteristics which
have gone far to m.ke insanity, disease and
deformity of mind ana bod. the heritage of
well-nigh every family in the land.
A great medical expert said to me not long
ago:
"There Is not more than one family ln ten
who can show a clean bill of health, mental
and physicalâ and moralâ irom heredi
tary taints that are serious in threat and al
most certain of development in one form or
another.
. Maternity, its duties, needs and responsibili
ties, has Deen exploited in all ages and climes,
iv ail phases and spheres, Irom one point of
view onlyâ the point of view of the male
owner. If >ou think that this statement is ex
treme I beg of you to read "The livo ution of
Marring.," by Letourneoti. Read it all. Read
it with care. It is the production of a man of
.profound learning and researchâ a man who
sees the light of the future dawning, although
even he sometimes lapses, from a universal
language of humanity into hereditary forms
of speech, hedged in by sex bias.
It has been the fashion in the recent past to
select the ablest girls in the family to send to
college or to develop for a career or a profes
sion. Of the others it was said, "Well. Ju.ia
and Maud do not seem to caie to learn much.
They will, no doubt, marry and make good
mothers, out the other girls will have a ca
reer." Think of the insult to motherhood this
accepted theory is, and it is well nigh uni
versal. Think of how slight a grasp upon the
realities of Hie such theories show.
A woman cannot mate a g cd doctor, a
good lawyer, a good journalist, a good
preacher, a good novelist, a good artist, or a
great musician unless she knows and can
weigh in a rational manner the meanings oi
life ; unless behind her science, her art, her
labor or her philosophy there is a comprehen
sion born of a solid grasp upon the real mean
ings of life, its relations, its proportions.
Knowledge is Indeed power, and ignorance
Is ever and always the twin brother of vice.
Therefore, no matter what profession ial Is to
the lot of or is chosen by a woman, the first,
the most important, the absolutely vital need
for her is a broad, solid, true and comprehen
sive grasp on the facts of life, as life is to-day
and as it has been in the past. This alone will
enable her to lay a firm foundation lor the
future.
I think this statement will be accepted as
almost a truism wben it Is applied to what are
generally called the professions. But, strange
to say, mere is one profession for which it is
always claimed that a true and firm and com
prehensive sense of the proportions in life is
not at all necessary to fit the applicant tor a
diplomaâ the proiesslon of motherhood. . ; '.
And yet It is trueâ and it is easy of proof if
one has even a slight knowledge of biology or
heredity -that there is no occupation, no art,
no proiesslon on the earth in which ignorance
of the true relations of things can and does
work such lasting and such terrible disaster
to the race as has been done and is constantly
doing right there. \ -.-;â :*.â 
Ignorant and undeveloped motherhood bas
been and is a terrible curse to mankind. An
incompetent artist is merely a path. tic fail
ure. A superficial woman lawyer simply goes
clientless. A trivial woman doctor may get a
chance to kill one or two patients, but her
career of harm wi.l be brief. A shallow or
lazy woman journalist will be crowded out
and back by the bright and industrious fel
lows who are her competitors. But a superfi
cial, shallow, incompetent or trivial mother
has left a heritcge to the world which can and
does poison the stream of ! Lite as it flows on
and on in an eternally widening circle of in
competence, or pain, or disease, or insanity,
or crime. . :s'..**.â¢" i~.
In every other profession which woman hes
entered she has been better fitted for her
work before she took her degree than for the
one which is held to be her especial province.
Why ? Simply because up to the present time
it has been maintained that a pretty and
childish ignorance of the real and true values
and relations of life, combined with a fine
pair of eyes and a compliant manner entitled
any woman to a diploma in her "sphere" of
maternity, while* if Vshe undertook to fit her
self for any other career she has to measure
her life.not with a painted-toy mentality, but
with tiie logically trained intellect which
must compete with her brothers, the estab
lished workers of the world, or else she must
go to the wall where her incompetency thrusts
her.
It would be well for the sake of the race If
she could be subject to sue. competition in
maternity. And did it ever occur to you that
her children are subject to it? and that the
vast spread of incompetence in the world,
the universality of incompetence to cope with
conditions, has a perfectly legitimate basts?
No woman is fit to bring up the administra
tors of a republic who is not herself familiar
with the fundamental principles upon which
that republic is based. For it is a well-known
exceptions and geniuses being allowed
forâ that tne trend, the bias, the color of the
mentality of a man is fixed upon him in his
earliest years, in the years when his mother
is his nearest and most Influential teacher.
His some of fairness and ot justice is warped
or developed then. His possibilities are born
<>f her capacity, and his development depends
lareely upon her training.
What profession in the world, then, needs so
wide an outlook, so perfect a poise, so fine an
individual development, I such â¢ breadth and
scope, such depth of comprehension, such full
new of philosophy, as does the lightly consid
ered profession ot motherhood ? Lightly con
sidered I mean in tbe sense that it has been
and is held by so many that it does no espe
cial harm to have tbe mothers of the race dis
tinctly lower lv development, in mentality, in
individuality, in poise, in grasp, in educstion.
than any other class of men or women.
And so, as I have said before, when I was
told not long ego at a public meeting that I
was expected to speak on "Woman in the Pro
fessions" I thought I would make a departure
and lack most fully, in the few minutes I was
to have, of the need of her higher education
for and because of the one profession which
was not thought of at all In its vast necessi
ties, not on.y in the development of a higher
womanhood but for the race which is to have
the solving of the tremendous problems of the
future. -
. I thought I would suggest the needs of those
voiceless ones rather than -peak much of or
for those, exceptional women who have ap
peared and are in everiucreasing numbers,
gaining firm and established footholds in
the other professions, because of which they
are being trained or are training themselves
for what they all recognize to be a sharp and
severe competition where capacity and will
ingness to do well what is undertaken is the
inevitable price of the position itself, and I
shall take tbe liberty to repeat here . what I
said then. It was this: . ...*Â»â  V
"It Is getting to be pretty generally looked
upon as the special province of the less highly
endowed or the leÂ«s thoroughly trained re
sidium to become the progenitors of the com
ing generations. If you havo a daughter who
is too silly or weak-minded or unambitious to
become a unit in the march of progress and
civilization; if she Is incompetent to be sent
through a solid training of scho.l or college
and to fit herself for some possible or probable
career as minister, doctor, designer, lawyer,
journalist or what not, marry her to some
body and let him carry the load of her unas
piring presence while he lives, and let the
race boar the burden of her infirmities and
ignorance unto the third and fourth genera
tions of them that loved her. That is, boldly
ttatea, the theory." ...
"hut the fact Is, as over against that theory,
that if you have a daughter who is finer and
truer, more capable and noble, more intellect
ual and able than the rest, she is the one
whose education and development as an indi
vidual should be carried to lis highest reach,
not simply lecause she is to be a writer or
speaker or teacher, for which she may be
primarily fitting herself as her trend may be,
out because in the ultimate analysis It may
also be her pleasure and province to be the
wife aud mother in the t ue and inspiring
home-life, where her ever new and stimulating
comradeship for husband and children makes
of her mind a beacon-light, and of her poised
and self-disciplined disposition i a guide and
an Inspiration; where she will be io< ed and
revered, not only because she is loving and
good, but because she is also wise and able and
broad enough to wisely lead, instead ot being
blind to the very pitfalls in the pathway of
her sons and daughters. ".jjv.'
"When our Republic bas snen mothers as
that the question of woman in the other pro
fessions will have adjusted itself. Wnen
woman Is developed and free to choose, capac
ity will find its level and its outlet. Ignor
ance will cease to be looked upon as beautiful
in either sex, and men and women will for
the first time clasp hands and try conclusions
with a frankness and a generosity and com
radeship which will be a real inspiration and
joy to both.
if you have a brilliant girl, one who has fine
poise, splendid endowments, great promise,
it is sne who should be developed to the mil
with knowledge that while she has done her
best in all things, she is still only able to be a
tolerably good mother; she lacks still much of
wisdom, much of all the judgment, tenderness
and scope that shall enab.e her to be an Ideal
mother of ideal children, who shall be hea "thy
in body and in mind, honest, earnest, truth
loving and justice-practicing human beings, a
credit to her aud to the race as it shall one day
De. But so long as motherhood is kept ignor
ant, dependent and subject in status, just that
long wi.l heredity avenge the outrage upon
her womanhood, upon her personality/upon
her right to a dignifiod personal equal human
status by striking telling blows __c_ upon the
race.
It seems to me that in discussing no other
question in life is there so little logical rea
soning and so mucn arbitrary dogmatism as
in the questions which are usually embraced
under "woman's sphere." ln the first place,
It is assumed that because women are mothers
they are nothing else ; that because this is her
sphere, she can nave, should have, no other. .
Now, men are fathers. That is their sphere;
therefore they should not be menially devel
oped, legally and politically emancipated,soci
ally civilized or economically Independent.
This would appear to most men as a some
what absurd proposition. It appears so to me,
but it is not one whit less absurd when ap
plied to women. Yet this is constantly done.
Because women are mothers is the very reason
why they should be developed mentally and
physically to their highest possible capacity.
The old theory that a teacher was good
enough lor a primary class if she knew the
"A B C's" and a litile else has long since been
exploded. A high degree of intellectual ca
pacity and a broad mental grasp are more im
portant in those who have the training and
molding of small children than if the chil
dren were older. The younger the mind the
less capable is it to guide I itself Intelligently,
and therefore the more important it is that
the guide be both wise and well-informed.
With little children the one who has them
ln charge most closely must be all this and
more. She must understand the proportion
and relations of things and wherein they
touch the bearing and trend of mental and
physical phenomena. She must furnish so.f
poise to the nervous child and stimulus to the
phlegmatic ones. She must be able to read
signs and to interpret indications in the men
tal and moral, as well as in the physical being
of those within her care. AIL this she must be
__>l 2to do readily and with apparent uncon
sciousness if she is best fitted to deal witn and
develop small children. More than this, -she
must not only be ab.e to detect wants, nut
have the wisdom to guide, to stimulate, to re
strain, to develop the plastic creature ln her
keeping. If she had the wisdom of the fabled
gods and the seli-poise of the Milo she would
not be too well equipped for bearing and edu
cating the race within her keeping.
But more than this the ideal mother should
know and be. She must have love, too loyal,
and sense of obligation too profound, to reck
lessly bring Into the world children she can
not pioperiy endow or care for. Every men
tally, morally or physically defective child has
a right to demand of its mother bow she dared
equip him so badly for the life Into which she
ha*, takeu the liberty to bring him, to demand
of her how she dared to equip herself so ill for
her self-imposed task of creator of a human
souL _ffl_-_i ._,".__....... -_â -,-*â .â ;-â >.'
Up â to the present time woman's moral re
sponsibility in heredity has been below the
point cf zero, for the simple reason that she
has had no voice in her" own control nor in
â  that of her children.
But with the present knowledge of heredity,
with woman's enlarged opportunity and
broadened education, she who permits herself
* to become a mother without having demanded
and obtained first her own freedom from sex
domination, and second, fair and free condi
tions of development for herself and child,
will commit a crime against herself, against
her child and against mankind.
Mothers, you bave it In your power to make
it true in a lofly sense" that "the hand that
rocks the cradle shall rule the worid. " It Is
for you to say whether it shall be ruled for
good or for ill in the days that are to come.
A spirited discussion followed, Mrs.

'retorted that . Dr. Beeeher was a living

SOUTHEEN CALIFOENIA.
If the people of Southern California feel
the need of any tonic stimulus after read
ing the depressing account of lite in their
section as described in Miss Harraden's
story of California life, they can find it in
an article by William E. Smythe in the
current number of th- Atlantic, on "Real
Utopias in. the Arid West." The portion
of the article devoted to Southern Cali
fornia is not lon , but it is sufficient to
dispel any gloomy ideas which may bo
held, either at home or abroad, con
cerning that beautiful section of our
country.
Mr. Smythe says the evolution of South
ern California may be studied In the ex
perience of two representative colonies,
Anaheim and Riverside, and of the or
ganization, development and success of
these he gives an account whose truth
needs no addition of glowing adjectives or
laudatory phrases to make it attractive to
home-seekeis. After pointing out that
the districts in which these now-flourish
ing settlements have grown up were once
regards.! as barren wastes, he describes
the condition of prosperity which obtains
there and pictures the life of the people
as far superior to that of rural residents in
any portion of the East.
Miss Harrad. n's heroine found her chief
objection to the country in its lack of so
ciety, but Mr. Smythe asserts that it is
the social side of these Southern Cali
fornia colonies which makes the strongest
appeal to popular interest. The homes
and avenues of Riverside, he says, "which
have been evolved from an inferior sheep
pasture in less than a generation, are
among the most beautiful in the world."
He emphasizes the fact that homes of
similar beauty and comfort in the sub
urban districts of great Eastern cities
belong to people wiio enjoy a degree of
prosperity much above the average, while
in the Southern Cahornia colonies these
l omes and surroundings belong to average
people who earn their living by tilling the
soil.
The writer also notes that the beautiful
homes and high-average prosperity at
tained on the small farms and orchards in
th" irrigate districts of Southern Cali
fornia have not spoiled the democratic
simplicity or lessened the hospitality of
these communities. As an illustration of
this he rites an incident that occurred
shortly after the adjournment of the In
ternational Irrigation Congress at Los
Angeles in 1893, the delegates to which at
tended a banquet given by the people ol
Santa A.na.
At the cose of this feast Senor de
Ybarrola, representative of Mexico, in an
after-dinner speech paid a handsome com
pliment to the ladies who had waited tin
the table. One of the representatives
from France afterward expressed surprise
that a public compliment should be given
to servants, and was amazed when in
formed that those wo had waited on the
table were the leading ladies of Santa Ana.
"Do you mean to tell me." asked the
French delegate, "that the lending ladies
put on aprons to serve stranger.?" "Cer
tainly," was the reply, "for in this coun
try service is a title to respect."
The incident, as Mr. Smythe says,
"illustrates at once the hospitality and
the equality which are characteristic of
the social life of Southern California";
and we can add that if Miss Harraden's
heroine, or any other person, is unfitted
to enjoy life in such society and amid
such surroundings she has only herself to
blame. In all such dissatisfied persons
there has been a defect in the bringing up,
and, like Mrs, Peyser's chickens, they
ought -to be "hatched over again and
hatched different."
THE LINCOLN MONUMENT.
The movement for the erection in San
Francisco of a monument to Abraham
Lincoln has already won popular favor,
and those who are directing it are receiv
ing every day promises of support which
are in the highest degree encouraging to
their hopes of early success. Reports sub
milted at the last meeting show that the
dtmand for certificates of membership in
the Lincoln Monument League Associa
tion is very great. A first edition of 20,000
has been printed end is being distributed
as rapidly as possible.
The Grand Army of the Republic is not
to be left to perform alone the work of
raising money for the monument. Several
other organizations and associations of in
fluence have promised their help in the
enterprise, and a large body of earnest
and vigilant workers is therefore assured.
It is only necessary that the movement so
well started should be vigorously pushed
in order for it to reach a speedy realiza
tion of the object toward which it is di
rected.
It is .gratifying to all patriotic citizens
to note the willingness of the people to
co-operate in a movement of this kind. A
monument to Abraham Lincoln should
have an honorable and an honored place
in every American city. Such tributes to
the worth of the martyred President re
flect credit upon the communities that
raise them, and San Francisco cannot af
fo-d to be the only city of metropolitan
eminence In America that lacKs such an
evidence of her artistic skill and such a
proof of her loyalty to the memory of the
best-beloved ruler that ever presided over
the destinies of a nation in all tides of
time.
THE KENTUCKY SENATOESHIP.
The breaking of the legislative dead

among Republicans caused by the strife

Democratic party by sending the aggres
sive Joe Blackburn to join Carlisle in that
outer cold where they can keep them
selves warm only by nursing a wrath
which will fire the blood to the fighting

The newly elected Senator is not known
to National politics, but he introduces
himself well with the statement, "I be
long to the school of Republicans of
Blame, MoKinley and Sherman. I am a
protectionist. I favor the passage of the
tariff bill and am for sound money. lam
in thorough accord with the Republican
administration at Washington." With
that introduction Dr.' Deboe hardly needs
further recommendation to the public,
and there will be general gratification
when he takes his seat in the Senate and
adds there a vote much needed by the Re
publicans in their efforts to build., up the
industries of the country and provide for
the welfare of the people.

ture, and a Republican United States
Senator. ? â  â¢ _C :
The Democrats who controlled the poli
tics of tho Sine and won office and fame
for themselves in the Nation have gone
from power. Utterly discredited and
divided one airainst the other in bitter
feuds, they have so demoralized their
party that there is little hope for them of
regaining their former prestige, and we
have probably sen the last of Carlisle,
Blackburn and Breckinridge as conspicu
ous figures in National politics.
The new Senator will undoubtedly have
to exert himself vigorously to fill the
place of the Senator whom he succeeds, for
with all his laults, Joe Blackburn, as the
people of Kentucky delight to call him, is
a man of more than ordinary force of
character. His personality is one of the
most interesting in political life, and
while it is best for the welfare of the busi
ness interests of the country that he as
well as other free-traders and erratic
statesmen shonld be dismissed from office,
the Senate will nevertheless miss him,
and its debates will be duller for the lack
of the vim and vigor of his oratory and
his actons. *
DISGUSTED __PANIAEDS.
The announcement from Havana that
Spanish officers are leaving Cuba in larce
numbers, and that those who are forced
to remain do so unwillingly, is more sig
nificant of the success of the patriots
than even the reports which come to us
of the victories oi Garcia. If the Spanish
troops were winning any glory, or if there
were any chance of Spanish success, the
higher officers would not be hastening and
eager to leave the field of battle. On the
contrary, tbey would be desirous o** re
maining to share in the victory after hav
ing for so long a time taken part in the
struggle. Their departure, therefore, is
clear ominous of cer an defeat.
According to some reporis the depart
ing officers are dissatisfied not merely
with the ill success of the war, but with
the character and policy of General .Sev
ier. No open criticisms on his course
have been expressed for obvious reasons,
but it is clear that the dissatisfaction is
widespread, since the suspicion exists in
Havana that many of the rearing officers
are leaving the island more because of
their object- ons to the commanding
general than of anything else.
Il is staled that since March 1, 1895.
Spain has sent to Cuba ten generals, 775
regimental officers and ever 180,000 sol
diers. With ali this force Weyler has suc
ceeded in attaining no sort of military
success, and his only accomplishments
have been the laying waste of wide dis
tricts of the country and filling the minds
of peaceful cultivators with terror. Des
titution and fear have been the means by
which he has sought to establish peace,
and it is not to be wondered that the offi
cers who are charged with carrying out
his cruel orders feel in many cases senti
ments of revolt which they cannot con
ceal even though they dare not express
them openly.
The light which dawns for Cuba ad
vances by slow degrees, but is sure and
steady in its movements. Little seems to
be gained from one week to another, or
even from month to month, but when we
contrast the conditions of the patriots
with those under which they were strug
gling a year ago, we can see that much
has been accomplished for liberty and
that the cause of independence bas made
notable progress. To the eyes of those on
the island, the evidence of this advance
on the part ol '.he -patriots is clearer and
more convincing than to outsiders. All
reports from the Spanish side show that
the spirit of the army has been demor
alized and that the higher officers are dis
gusted, while those from the side of the
patriots reveal an unbroken resolution
and a brightening hope.

Chief Justice W. L. Chambers of Samoa, who
is on his way to Apia, and who arrived here
from Washington a day or two ago, hts definite
views as to the full province of the office,
which is tilled by joint appointment of the
three great powers, Germany, the United States
and Great Britain. lie said yesterday at the
Palace, in connection with other details as to
the duties of the office:
"The Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction
of all questions arising under the provisions
of this general act : and the decision or order
of the court thereon shall be conclusive upon
all residents of Samoa. The court shall also
have appellate jurisdiction over all municipal
magistrates and officers.
"The chief justice is authorized at his own
discretion, and quired upon written request
of either party lltieant, to appoint assessors,
one of the nationality of each litigant, to assist
the court, but without voice in the decision.
"In case any question shall hereafter arise
ln Samoa respecting the rightful election or
appointment of king or any other chief claim
ing authority over the islands, or respecting
the validity of the rowers which the king or
any chief may claim in the exercise of his
office, such question shall not lead to war, but
shall be presented for decision to the chief
justice of Samoa, who shall decide it in
writing, conformably to the provisions of this
act and to the laws and customs of Samoa, not
in conflict therewith; and the signatory
Governments will accept and abide by such
decisions.
"In case any difference shall arise between
either of the treaty powers and Samoa, which
they shall fall to adjust by mutual accord,
such difference shall not be held cause for war,
but shall bo toferred for adjustment on the
principles of justice, and equity to the Chief
Justice of Samoa, who shall make his decision
thereon in writing."
The treaty of Berlin between the United
States, Great Britain and Germany provided
that in case the signatory powers could not
agree upon a Chief Justice, the King of Sweden
should appoint him. This was done in tho
case of the first Chief Justice, and Baron Ce
darcrantz was named. Judge Chambers has
been identified with Samoan affairs for some
years, and when it became necessary to ap
point another Chief Justice England and Ger
many requested that he be selected. This met
with the approval of the United States, and
PresidcntCieveland appointed him. The Jus
tice will reach Aoia by the steamer Monowai.

Independent Order of Foresters.
G. A. McE fresh, high chief ranger, will dur
ing the month of May De among the courts in
the northern and central part of the State and
during the last week of the month will be
with tbe courts of San Francisco.
The courts in all parts of the State are very
active and the reports show that the order is
Increasing in this State. Ou an average the
number of accepted applications for some
months past has been in excess of 250.
On the Ist Inst the total membership of the
order was 110,000 and the reserve fund
amounted to $2, 134.000.
It is expected that a new court will be in
stituted in Sbcramenlo next month, which
will increase the number iv that city to four,
and it is probable that another court will be
instituted next month in Stockton.
The high chief ranger, after an absence of
twenty-five days, returned to his home in Los
i Angeles in time to take part in the fiesta. He
visited Butte, Glenn and Colusa counties and
addressed enthusiastic meetings in Chico, Or
land, Maxwell, Williams, Colusa and Wood
land. He succeeded in securing 135 applica
tions, which represent protection to the
amount of $181,000.
During the fiesta parade an attractive fea
ture was the section oi the uniform rank of
the Independent Order of Foresters repre
sented by eighty knights ln rich and co.tlv
new nnuorms. It was the only fraternal body
that appeared in the parade.
Knights of Pythias.
The report of the board of control of the En
dowment Rank of the Knights of Pythias for
the quarter ending on the J.Oth of last March
contains the following interesting statement:
The quarter just closed terminates another fiscal
year of the Endowment Hank, completing the
twentieth year of lis existence
1 he results which the board have from time to
time placed before the membership during the
past year evidence that the Interest manifested
in Pythian life insurance is constantly on tne in-
The work accomplished during the last three
months Is especially gratifying. Since January 1,
18;*7, 118 new sections bHve been establishedâ a
gain of thirteen over the preceding quarter, The
new applicants admitted number 2749, and the
Insurance added amounts to $4,159.00 , while in
death claims there has teen paid during this
period $'-76,000.
Tbe figu.es representing the work accomplished
for the fiscal year are equally convincing that the
rank has reached the foremost place among ira
terr.al insnrauce.
For the twelve months ending March 31, 1897,
608 sections Â»ere organized, nearly 11.000 were
admitted to membership and over $16,000,000
new insurance written. The disbursement for
death losses during this period was 51, 012,000
and to the investment fund has been added
$64,833.

SUBMITTED ITS CONTRACT.
The "Valley Road Boldly Faces an Im
portant Issue.
Argument was resumed before the Rail
road Commission yesterday in reference
to the validity ot . the traffic contract be
tween the Valley road and the California
Navigation and Improvement Company.
Ii was finally agreed by Â£. F. Preston,
attorney for the Valley road, to submit a
copy of the contract to the members cf
the commission for their personal inspec
tion, and the matter went over until next
Tuesday.
In the course of 'lie afternoon a copy of
the contract was delivered to Commis
sioner La Rue.
After the commission adjourned for the
day Chairman La Rue plated the repre
sentatives of the Union Transportation
Company, which is making a desperate
fight to break into the business of its
rival, in an embarrassing position.
"Isn't it rather strange," remarked Mr.
La line, with a smile, to counsel for the
complainant, "that your company, whicli
has refused to recognize the authority of
the commission when it was asked to file
its report with this body, should come to
it for relief against a rival? '
Counsel apologized for the bad behavior
of his client in the past and promised
better things in the future.

SO JUDGE HEBBARD
DID REALLY KNOW
Mr. Pike Informed the
Court of Mr. Sheehan's
Strange Acts.
Frantic Efforts by Attorneys to
Keep Out Certain Impor
tant Testimony.
But Considerable Truth Was Deliv
ered to the Jurors in the
Marriott L b.l Case.
_BTh9re was a scene of persistent fencing
on the part of lawyers for ihe prosecution
in the Marriott libel case yesterday to pre
vent connecting Judge Hebbard with the
mismanagement of the People's Home
Savines Bank, which hitherto they in
sisted ought to be proved before certain
testimony could be admitted.
At the opening of the case for the de
fense Samuel M. Shortridge, counsel for
Editor Marriott of the News Letter, made
an opening statement in which he said
that he expected to justify the language
of the article on which the charge of libel
was based. He said lie expected to prove
that certain men, notably John F.
Sheehan and James. Alva "Watt and tlieir
close associates, had made use oi Judge
Hebbard to further tbeir _eifish ends. He
then began to offer bis proof in chronolo
gical order, but was harassed by objec
tions offered by Attorney Julius Kami
and Deputy District Attorney Hinkle, who
insisted thai be ought first to show that
Judge Hebbard had knowledge of Mr.
Sheehan's acts and of certain boasts made
; by Mr. Watt.
Finally Mr. Sbortridge yielded to the
clamor of counsel for the prosecution and
began to introduce testimony having in
view the proof of the matters demanded
by Mr. Kahn and Mr. Hinkle. Yester
day's proceedings consisted of offers of
this character of testimony and voci.erous
objections against it by the attorneys for
ihe State. Notwithstanding their exer
tions to keep out what they had before
said should be first presented, a pretty
clear view of the truth was given to the
jury and to the interested audience of
citizens who were pre. to hear the pro
ceedings.
William E. Palmer testified that he
knew John F. Sheehan. James Alva Watt,
ex- Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart,
Judge Hebbard and other persons* con
nected with the dispute over the settle
ment of the People's Home Savings Bank
affairs. Mr. Palmer was an employe of
the bank before the failure of that institu
tion as manager of the banking depart
ment and was continued in a similar posi
tion by Receiver Sheehan.
Ex-Aitnrney-General W. H. H. Hart
may have been paid some money by the
bank, Mr. Palmer said. He could not say
ye* or no to that question. He thought
the books would show â at least, they
ought to show.
It was developed that after Mr. Sheehan
was appointed receiver the head man in
the bank's work was Mr. Palmer. He re
membered talking with Mr. McCarthy,
but did noi remember tbat they discussed
the bank's affairs. He did, however, talk
"over the corporation's troubles with Mr.
Pike and witu Mr. Williams.
At the time the bank closed its doors
there were about 11,000 depositors in the
bank who had live uccounts. In the
course of events 19.000 depositors had
dropped out. Mr. Palmer could not re
member the names of the stockholders at
the time of the lailure. He thought there
were about 200 stockholders on the books
when the bank closed its doors.
Mr. Shortridge tried to find out how
much money the bank had on hand when
John F. Sheehan was appointed receiver.
He wanted to know about the caslibook,
and learned that in banking tue cashboo-C
is used as a general ledger, and that nil
the transactions of the bank passed
through it. For instance, if the bank
bought a piece of property ior $10,000 and
sold it for $9000 there would be a loss of
$1000, which would appear in the cash
doo_ in the profit and loss account. It
would he necessary to make that entry in
order to balance the cash account.
Mr. Palmer thought it would be difficult
to fix the date on which Mr. Sheeban
ceased to be receiver. As he understood
It Mr. Sheehan was acting in a dual ca
pacity for some time, being both receiver
and secretary.
â¢â Then as receiver he would converse
with nimself as secretary, would he?"
asked Mr. Shortridge.
To this Mr. Kahn and Mr. Hinkle ob
jected, and being sustained by the court
-Mr. Shortridge changed the lorm, thus:
"As receiver, Mr. Sheehan did certain
things, you say, and then would he pass
on such acts us secretary of the bank?"
Vociferous objections were again inter
posed by the attorneys for the prosecu
tion, but the court thought that the de
fendant had a right to go into the acts of
the receiver, agreeing with the attorney
for the defense that it was a material mat
ter if it could be shown that the receiver,
while an officer of the court, had abused
the court's confidence, but Mr.. Palmer
said be was not able to detino the acts of
Mr. Sheehan in this regard. He knew
that the_re was some understanding that
Mr. Sheehan was acting in a dual capacity
ior awhile. He could not say definitely
when the receivership actually ended. He
promised to produce books to show the
amount of money that came into the
bands of the receiver and also to show to
whom and for what it bad been paid out,
Mr. Shortridge asked the bailiff to call
Thomas S. Williams Jr. as a witness.
Mr. Hinkle objected, saying that there
were already three witnesses in the air
who bad been partially examined, and
he though: it was unfair to have so many
irons in the lire.
Mr. Shortridge expressed a hope that
the witnesses would come down out of the
air, and Judge Daingertield said he would
decline to interfere with the course of ex
amination of witnesses so long ns counsel
appeared to be acting in good lailb. He
accordingly overruled the objection.
"But Mr. Shortridge has succeeded in
excluding General S eehan frora the
courtroom as one of the witnesses in the
case," insisted Mr. Hinkle, "and bis ex
amination ought to be closed in order
that he could remain in curt; bis coun
sel is of importance to counsel for the
prosecution. He is neld here in attend
ance, but not allowed in the courtroom."
"Let him go home to his work. VVe
will call for him when we need him," said
Mr. Shortridge.
Bo Mr. Williams took the witness-stand
and told of a meeting that he bad with
Judge Hebbard in the office of the Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company.,
He said that Judge Hebbard told the
gentlemen present that he was there in
his capacity for the purpose of se
curing harmony, and saying that he,
wanted to do what he could to save the
bank's assets for the depositors.
Mr. Shortridee attempted, to draw out
facts to show that Judge Hebbard was
trying to obtain a board of directors that
would keep Mr. Sheehan in as manager
of the bank, but the questions were ruled
out. It was finally developed that Mr.
Williams was appointed on the board of
directors and served for a year. He was
appointed as a committee to go to the
southern part of the Siate for the pur
pose of investigating the securities of
tbe bank, and he found thai Manager

Sheehan was incompetent, and so re
ported. .
Then followed a storm of objections on
the ground tbat it had no relation to
Judge Hebbard, nor that Judge Hebbard
had any knowledge of the matter, nor
tnat he had acquiesced therein.
In this Judge Daingerfield held that the
counsel for the pro-ecution ought to be
sustained, and the question was ruled out.
Mr. Shortridce asked the court it be
might recall Witnesses Watt and Wil
liams to question t em about certain con
versations with Judge Hebbard. To this
t c court replied that ne might ao so if
Judge Hebbard was first questioned
touching those matters and either affirmed
or denied the alleged conversations with
Witnesses Watt and Williams.
On cross-examination by Mr. Kahn the
witness said he could not remember
whether or not Judge Hebbard said be
thought the depositors ought to have a
majontv on the board. He recalled that
Judge Hebbard said he wanted to help
the depositors.
A letter from Mr. Williams to Judge
Hebbard was offered in evidence, in
which the writer said he was willing to act
as a member of the board ol director,, and
in accordance therewith tie was chosen to
that position.
Questions were then propounded to test
the knowledge of the witness as to who
paid for printing and circulating the docu
ment known as "An Appeal to Voters,"
in which Jtid-_e Hebbard was referred to
as an unfit person to bÂ« re-elected, and as
an enemy ot the widows and orphans who
had 10-t their deposits through the iaiture
of the People's Home Savings Bank.
Mr. Shortridge said he consideted the
witness to be under the protection of the
court, and that he ought to be instructed
that he had a right to decline to answer.
Mr. Kahn insisted on knowing why he
declined to answer, and tho witness was
allowed until Monday mornine to con
suit counsel before deciding whether to
answer or decline to answer tbe questions.
After Mr. Williams' right in that regard
have been presented to the court an order
will be made by the court deciding the
disputed matter.
T. H. McCarthy was recalled and testi
fied that he was one of tho committee'thnt
attempted to protect the property of the
depositors. He lound that S. K. Thorn
ton. George Stone and J. F. Sheehan were
active in thwarting the efforts of the de
positors to save their money, lie also
knew that Judge Hebbard was informed
of the acts of Mr. Sheehan and Attorney
Watt. The statements were made in
open court.
"Did you observe the manner of Judge
Hebbard at the time thee statements
were made?'' asked Mr. Shortrid__e. -
This was objected to and Mr. Shortridge
withdrew th question.
This witness was also asked if he know
who paid for the printing, publishing and
circulating of the document purporting to
be signed by the depositors' committee,
and known as "An Appeal to Voters."
As in the case of the former witness, Mr.
McCarthy was allowed until Monday to
consult an attorney touching his rights in
this regard.
Isaac E. Pike, a member of the deposi
tors' committee, testifi. d that he called to
see John F. Sheehan at the People's Home
Savings bank. Mr. Sheehan was very
courteous until be found out be would be
likely to Jose his position as receiver or
manager of the bank if the depositors got
in their men us members of the board of
directors. He said the depositors only
wanted .honest men who would prevent
the bank's funds from being wasted. He
and the other memlers of the committee
made an investigation and found out that
tbe assets of the bank would pay 80 cents
on the dollar if properly bandied.
Mr. Sheehan soon cooled in his cor
diality and actually barred the depositors
and their committeemen from the -bank
premises, refused to consider their claims
and would have nothing to do with them.
All this was brought out against the
most urgent objections of the attorneys
for tbe prosecution. But a thunder
tbat tbey were unprepared for struck
their fraii craft at this point. As usual
they were repeating- that Judge Hebbard
knew nothing of what Mr. Sheeban was
doing, and so Mr. Shortridge asked:
"Did Judge Hebbard know of the illegal
acts of Mr. Sheehan, tbe man be bad ap
pointed aa his representative in and about
the bank?'
"He must have Known, for I sent him a
written statement of Mr. Sheehan's acts
through the mail," said Mr. Pike. "1/ he
didn't read it that was not my fault. Bo
sides we discussed t ose matters fully at
our open meetings and our exposes of Mr.
Sheehan's acts were reported in detail in
the daily papers. There was no secret
ab( at the matter. It was a matter of
common knowledge and Judge Hebbard
must have known bow Mr. Sheehan was
acting."
Thus the testimony was carried along,
each witness confirming the fact that
Judge Hebbard had free knowledge of the
doings of Mr.JSheehan and that no order
of court was made stopping Mr. Sheehan
in the course that led to -*ucb heavy losses
for the depositors, who might have got 80
cents on the dollar it they bad been til
lowed to protect their property in their
own way. -v-^*o^9B > SEb>-i| '_ :

PURSUED BY A
FRENZIED MOB
Joe Howard, an Express
man, Saved From
Lynching.
He Attempted to Take Liberties
With a Young Nurse-
Girl.
Rock* Were Thrown at Hm anl He
Was Rescued by a Po. iceman
and Locked Up.
Joe Howard, an expressman, living at
630 Sacramento street, narrowly escaped
being stoned to death last evening by a
number of angry Italian fishermen. Â§Â§jyf
About 6 o'clock he met Amelia Miller, a
young nursegirl about 12 years of age, at
the foot of Mason street. She had a child
with her, and walked along till she got to
the beach.
Howard followed her, and when she
reached the beach he spoke to her. The
girl quickened her pace, when Howard
overtook her and threw his arms around
her neck. Her loud screams for help
were heard by fifteen or twenty Italian
fishermen, who ran to her assistance.
When Howard saw them coming be ran
away hotly pursued by the fishermen.
Howard was a better sprinter than the
fishermen, and realizing that they could
not overtake him, they picked up rocks
from tbe roadway and threw them at
him, still keeping up the pursuit. .
Some of tbe rocks were aimed with pre
cision and struck Howard on the head,
body and legs. One that struck him un
the head made him stagger, and the
fishermen as they rushed on thought they
had bim, but he quickly recovered him
self and continued his flight. *
A mob of small boys and men joined in
tbe pursuit as Howard dashed along
Union street, but tbo probability is he
would have escaped if a policeman bad
not appeared from a cross street and inter
cepted him in bis filch;.
Howard was bleeding and terror
stricken. He piteously b.gged the officer
to save him from the angry mob, who
were shouting, "Lynch bim 1 lynch him!"
The mob gathered around the officer
and Howard and appeared so threatening
in their attitude tbat the officer drew his
revolver and threatened to shoot any one
that attempted to touch Howard, which
put a check upon their bloodthirstiness.
After learning the reason for the pur
suit of Howard the officer took him to the
nearest Datrol box and rang for the
wagon, the crowd hovering around till it
arrived.
Howard ..was : driven to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Hartley found a long
wound . in his scalp requiring several
stitches, and his body and legs were
bruised and discolored where the rocks
had landed. . . : ' _â¢".
After his wounds were dressed Howard
was taken to the*. City Prison, and was
placed in "the tanks" pending an inves
tigation.
When the officer went to the beach with
the fishermen the nursegirl and ibe child
had disappeared. Some one told them
her name was Amelia Miller, but it was
not known where she lived. Every effort
will be made by the police to find her, so
that a felony charge can be preferred
against Howard.
WAS HE KIDNAPED?
A Boy From Placer . 'onntjr Found on
. the Water Front.
Henry Nolau, a boy 10 years of age, was
found wandering about tha . water front
Wednesday afternoon by Policeman Cam
pion. i At the Harbor station Captain
Dnnlevy questioned him, and be .said he
had been kidnaped by a miner from his
home in Rocklin, Placer County, where
his father is also a miner.
The boy could not explain how they
reached this city, and very little credence
was placed in his story.
The boy was sent to Chief Lees, and on
being questioned be said he and his kid
naper came here by rail.
Ho will be detained in the City Prison
till his parents are communicated witb. _

â 
Smallpox and a Quarantine on
the Empress of
China.
Serious Accident to a Sailor on Board
tbe Crown of DenÂ«
mark.
The principal arrival yesterday was the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany's Doric two days ahead of time.
She made the run from Hongkong in 28
days, from Yokohama in 15 days 12 hours,
and from Honolulu in 6 days 5 hours.
She anchored off Meigits wharf late
Wednesday night, but none of the passen
gers were allowed to land until yesterday
morning. Tbe passengers on the Doric
played in great good luck, as all the peo
ple who left on the Empress of China, on
the same day for British Columbia, are
now in quarantine at Vancouver, B. C.
Two cases of smallpox broke out during
the trip, and the Sound steamer Islander
had to be hired in order to accommodate
the lady passengers. Those who came in
the Doric's cabin are now safely housed in
San Francisco hostelries.
Among those who came back from the
Orient were the following missionaries:
Mrs. T. T. Alexander and the lour Misses
Alexander, Miss Blunt. Rev. A. Bunker,
Miss Brittan, Rev. and Mrs. L. P. Peet,
Miss N. Stewart, Rev. and Mrs. S. W.
Taft, Mr. and Mrs. I. D. Vroom, H.
Whitney and Miss M. Whitney.
Among the distinguished passengers
was the Hon.' James F. Connelly, United
States Consul ct Kobe, Japan.
E. Stanley Gibbons, another passenger,
is the well-known English philatelist.
His house in London is the recognized
center of stamp-collectors the world over,
and his advent will be hailed with joy by
some of San Francisco's millionaire
cranks. Incidentally E. Stanley Gibbons
expects to pick up a few rare specimens in
this "out-of-the-way corner of the globe."
C. H. Krach is connected with the Great
Northern Telegraph Company, whose
headquarters are at Nagasaki. He will
hold a conference 1 here with the Western
Union people, and the result may be a
direct service between here and Nagasaki.
H. Henneesey, the genial and popular
purser of the Gaelic, came back as purser
of the Doric. Mr. Brown, who was sent
out from England, took his place at
Hongkong and Mr. Hennessey went to the
new ship.
The steamer Del Norte will sail for
Alaska in a 'few days for a five months'

The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has at last discovered that the
approaches to the Oregon dock require
repairine Men were at wor_t yesterday
pianking the dozens of holes that were a
menace to teamsters' navigation, and in
future wagons will not have to go three
blocks out of their way to steer clear of
pitfalls.
The gasoline schooner Je-sie Matson
played in bard luck last night. She was
bringing in the divers nnd workmen (rom
A. E. Pry or's silver mine when her pro
peiior dropped out and the anchor had to
be let go. Yesterday morning she sailed
in and the crew pot ashore.
J. J. Livernash was appointed a col
lector on the water front by the Harbor
Commissioners yesterday. The contract
for the erection of the new receiving hos
pital was let to Thomas H. Day for ?1190,
while a permit for the erection of bunkers
on Green street wharf was granted to R. D.
Chandler. The cost will be about $3.),000,
and Chief Engineer Holmes was in
structed to prepare plans for the.con
struction of the same.
William Ramsey, a sailor on the Crown
of Denmark, now lying in Oakland Creek,
fell down the hold and was seriously in
jured last Wednesday. He was brought
across the bay in a towboat yesterday and
sent to the Marine Hospital.
The Hakasun-Maru, a Japanese steamer,
is on her way here with an overflow cargo
of general merchandise. Rumor has it
that she is the first of a new line of
steamers which will beconsigr.et to Chap
man <fc Co., but Captain J. F. Chapman
knows nothing about the new line. Just
the same the advance steamer of the so
called new line is overflowing with cargo.

This is by far the best programme that
lias ever been arranged for a Velodrome
meet, tne entry-list showing some of the
crack riders of tbe State. Among the
professionals will be noted Clint Coulter,
the unpaced king; Otto Ziegler Jr., who
makes bis first appearance in competi
tion in his own State for several years;
Bleuler, the French champion, and Coty,
Burke, Hill and Hewitt, four new arrivals
from the south, who are reputed to be
fast men. .
The following is the list of officials who
will conduct the meet:
Referee, R. M. Welch. Judgesâ A. P. Swain,
F. H. Kerrigan, J. F. McGlynn. Timers-
George P. Wetmore, George B. Stratton,
Charles Albert Adams, James 11. Hamilton.
Scorersâ W. E. Pixley, P. G. Alexander. George
Brouillet. Umpiresâ Jose Lewis, R. S. Dun

sistants, L. Schoenfeld, A. W. Wehe, Ed Weath
erhead. Starter, Douglas White; announcer,
George E. Dixon; haudicapper, Robert A.
Smyth.
This meet marks the commencement of
local control of cycle racing. The sanc
tion of the League of American Wheel
men has been ignored, and the men will
race under the rules of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs. Ail have en
tered with a hearty spirit into the new
arrangement and it is bound to bb a suc
cess. Of course, the L. A. W. Racing
Board will suspend all these men; but
what a farce that will be, -.hen it is con
sidered that a meet under its sanction in
this Stato would not attract a dozen
riders now. The wheelmen of California
have cut loose from the East for good,
and Sunday's meet marks the commence
ment of their independence.

CARDWELL WON
AT CRISP ODDS
Downed a Field of Cheap
Ones at Odds of
20 to I.
Of the Other Events Decided
Favorites Captured
Three. ...
Cabrillo B-aten Out \>i R-y Del
Tierraâ Salvab'e Easily Took the
Handicap From Refugee.
j
Three favorites were snugly tacked
away in their trundle-beds- and gently
rocked to sleep at Inglesiae yesterday,
while three others were more kindly dis
posed and won out. Cardwell, a rank out
sider, caused his backers severe parox
ysms of delight by finishing first in the
second event decided, at the gushing odds
of 20 to 1. Those "in on the know" re
moved several bucketsful of coin from the
ring over the colt's victory.
The decision of the judges in disquali- ]
fying Satricoy, who finished first in the I
op_ning two-year-old scramble, caused a I
howl of dissent. The colt was backed for I
a good thing at odds of 8 and 10 to 1, and
coming from behind at the finish appar- j
ently downed the 8 to 5 favorite, Dalion, '
very cleverly. However, be was disquali- J
fied for bumping the first choice and, j
though leading that colt out a length, was
setback. This gave the Corrigan entry,
Truth, the place and Benicia the show.
Jockey Eddie Ames, who landed Don
Gara winner a few days ago at odds of 200
to 1, was again prominent on a rank out
sider in the six-furlong event tbat was
second on the card. He had the mount
on Cardwell, which opened at 20 to 1, and,
pulling out of the bunch opposite the
paddock, won- easily by three lengths in
l:15->_. Mike Rice, which led into the
stretch, beat O'Fleeta over a length for the
place. Clawson, who rode Decision,
claimed a foul against the winner, but it
was not allowed.
Charles Le Bel. with odds of 6 to 1,
proved the best of the eleven entries in
the second two-year-old event. Siva, a
Hindoo colt owned by Barney Schreiber,
was made an 11 to 5 favorite, but at the
first turn was cut off and never figured in
the running after. Into the stretch St.
Cntaline was first, where he "blew up."
From that point home Charles Le Bel and
Los Prietos fought it out, the former gain
ing the decision by a nose in :56% for the
four and a half furlongs.
Dunne's Cabrillo was backed down to 7
to 5 favoritism to win the mile and a six
teenth, but stumbled at the start, losing
considerable ground. Alvarado and Hora
tio made the running to the stretch, where
Rey del Tierra, which had been lying in
third position, went to the front and led
the hard-ridden favorite over the line a
length in 1:48 Morte Fonse, at 15 to 1,
was a good third.
The Spreckels entry Olive both surprised
and upset the calculations ofthe talent
in the fifth race, a six-furlong selling
sprint, for which Mainstay was a pro
nounced 9 to 10 choice. Emma D and
William Pinkerton raced off in front,
showing the way into the straight for
home. Slaughter then urged Olive and
the mare responded with alacrity, taking
command of things and winning very
cleverly by over two lengths in 1:15^.
Palmerston came from the rear, taking
place honors from Pinkerton. The win
ner was at one time 10 to 1 in the betting.
Opening at 3 to 5 Salvable receded in
the betting in the mile handicap until
evens were obtainable. Martin, who had
the mount, trailed Refugee into the
stretch, where he moved up, defeating
Sink's sprinter with ease in 1:42. Satsnma

voted to vocalization, gave proof of the
existence in the companies of some very
fine voices, and the merits of these were
approved in a manner that must have
been exceedingly flattering to the singers.
In the first part the following numbers
were rendered:
"Hot Time in the Old Town To-Night," Joe
Ross; "Whisper Your Mother's Name." F.
Gianninl; '"All Over Town," Jim Gillis;

THE TOMAHAWK
FLASHES AGAIN
Populist Sachems Try to
Redeem Their Fallen
Fortunes.
A Lively Skirmish Expected at
the N xt County Com
mittee Meeting.
Disgruntled Former Lenders Refuse to
Be Wooed Backâ "Bo His-
kail Now an Ex.
All is bustle and activity in the local
Populistic wigwam, for an event of im
portance is about to occur. Their sachems
and their medicine men have held eeveral
pow-wows in view of the step about to be
taken and have concluded that the phase
of the moon augurs well for their scheme.
The Populi-ts have at last concluded
that they made a mistake in taking on
â¢'Boss" Haskell of Kawacb Colony fame
as clii f, for the loss of all leaders of in
fluence followed. . _*' -V"-. '..*.
In the first place, they admit that
fusion with an effete Democratic organi
zation was an error. Then came that
spasmodic revulsion against all of sup
posedly Buckley affiliation which re
sulted in the enthronement ol Haske
and the withdrawal of such men as Taylor
Rogers, Dr. Day wait and E. 8. Barney
from their council fires.
During the last few weeks those who
dropped out have received communica
tions asking in very submissive tones if
they were willing to serve on the County
Central Committee. Some have refused;
what the other- will do remains in doubt.
But to-morrow evening the County
Central Committee will hold its regular
monthly meeting at 915>__ Market street.
Some things will take place there that
mean in all probability an internecine
war.
First of all an attempt will be made to
add 100 new members from the City at
large to the committee.
This will permit the organization to be
strengthened by a larger representation
and afford room for the old leaders, upon
whom more attempts to induce them to
come back will doubtless be made. Such
a move will hardly be opposed, but what
may follow is darkly hinted by Has
kel litesâ will.
So the meeting is looked forward to
with the delightiul anticipation of a mid
night marauder after a fat chicKen, know
ing that several concealed steel traps lie
in tbe path.
PUSHING ON TO HANFORD
The Valley Road May Reach
That Point in About
Three Weeks.
Additions Being ' M de to Its Rolling
Stock to Hand, the Grow
ing Traffic '
Hanford will in all probability be
reached by the Valley road by the 22d of
May. Work on the bridge across Kings
River is progressing favorably, and every
thing is in good shape to rush the track
laving between the river and Han.ord as
soon as the bridge is completed.
It is possible that the opening of the
line to Hanfori may be made the occa
sion of a grand excursion by the Knights
of Pythias. The grand lodge of the order
is announced to meet at Hanford on the
17th of May. It is understood that efforts
are being made to have the date changed, I
so as to permit the knights to make their
pilgrimage to Hanford over the Valley
road, which many of them are anxious
to do.
In view of the rapid increase of the
business of the Valley road, n-cessitating
tbe services of an additional steamer be
tween here and. Stockton, as already an
nounced in The Call, and the extension
and operation of its line to Hanford, ad
ditional rolling stock has been ordered.
By the time wheat shipment), begin the
company will have about 500 cars, each
with a capacity of thirty tons, ready for
service. It will thus have an equipment
sufficient to enable it to handle every
pound of freight with the utmost prompt
ness. Its equipment last season was k 350
cars. - -:â¢_. \

FLED FROM A
GIRL'S VENGEANCE
Rollie Crampton, a Stockton
Boy, Afraid of His
Life.
Lillie Webster, a Young Girl,
Blames Him for Ruin
ing Her.
iAs She Carried a Revolver and
Threatened Him He Came
to This City.
Rollie Crampton, a boy 17 years of age,
fled from " Stockton. Wednesday night to
escape the vengeance of Lillie Webster, a
girl his own age, who blames him for be
traying her.
Rollie, who is' a handsome - looking
boy. Jived with his mother, Mrs. Belle
Campbell, proprietor of the Selby House,
110 South Hunter street, Stockton. He
quietly packed his valise Wednesday
night, and un Known to his mother took
the boat for this City, arriving yesterday
morning. He went to some friends on
Juniper and Harrison streets, and was
shortly afterward arrested by Policeman
T. J. Connell, the police having been noti
fied from Stockton that he was wanted
there, but nothing was stated for what
purpose.
Rollie was taken before Chief Lees, and
on being interrogated, ho said he ran
away from home because of trouble with
a girl. Stockton was notified of his arrest,
and he is being detained in the City
Prison, pending the arrival of his mother
or an oflicer to take him back.
When seen later in the prison Rollie
was , more communicative and talked
freely of the cause of his sudden flight.
"I bave known Lillie Webster," he
said, "lor about four months, and since
then have been often in her company.
She is about my own age, and lives with
her adopted parents.
"She blamed me for getting her into
trouble, and as I have not been calling
upon her for two or three weeks my
friends told me that she was threatening
to do for me.
â¢'Last Tuesday she sent word to me
that she wanted particul-rly to see me,
and asked me to meet her at the Grove
that night. I started for there, but on the
way I met a friend, who warnea me not
to meet Lillie, as she bad packed a gun
for me and had three male friends with
her.
"I did not go to the grove, and as I
learned that she was carrying a gun to
use it upon me the first time she met me I
made up my mind to go to San Fran
cisco, where I have some friends, and be
out of her way, so I packed up a few
things and left on the boat last night.
â¢â¢She has been keeping company with a
lot ot fellows, and I don't see why she
should pick upon me for causing her
trouble. _U9. *
"I did not get along well with my step
father either, and tnat was another rea
son why I wanted to come to this City."
Young as he is Rollie has had a check
ered experience. He has worked in the
mountains, in a pawnship and as a waiter
on board the Stockton boat, Mary Gar
rett. He hat no particular aim in life,
except to do something so as to make
money. â¢'
ILLEGAL" LANDING.
Commissioner Stradley Notified Not to
Prosecute the 91 muwal'i Officials.
A short time ago Major Moore, Special
Agent of the Treasury Department, in
vestigated the facts connected with the
purported illegal landing of forty-two
white immigrants from the steamer'
Monowai. The immigrants bad been in
spected according to law by "Walter P.
Stradley, Commissioner of Immigration,
but before Quarantine Officer Jordan, who
was a long time late, put in an appearance
they were permitted to land by Captain
Howard, superintendent of the dock, with
the consent of Deputy Surveyor of the
Fort Ruddell.
Major Moore made a lengthy report to
the department at Washington, and in re
ply to the report a letter was received by
Commissioner Strao.ey instructing him
not to prosecute the steamship officials,
inasmuch as Deputy Surveyor Ruddell
"had been remiss in the performance of
bis duties in allowing the passengers to
go ashore."
Commissioner Stradley. while admitting
that he bad received a letter, declined to
make known its purport or to discuss the
matter in any way.
Owing to Dr. Jordan's tardiness in ar
riving, the Immigration Commissioner
and other Federal and State officials hav
ing completed their inspection of the pas
sengers, there was much impatience and
distress on board. The customs officials
were waiting on the dock to examine the
baggage, night was coming on and women
and children were crying.
Hence, the strict latter of the law was
infringed, in order to relieve distress
caused by the non-appearance of a paid
official who was absent on business of less
importance.

Devote Themselves to Pri

SENATOR FAIR'S VALET MAKES
ADMISSIONS.
Tells How the City's Detectives
Busied Themselves in Hunting Up
Evidence for the Ex -cutors.
A grave scandal, premonitory rum
blings of which have been more or less
audible since the opening of the trial
which is to determine the validity of Mrs.
Nettie Craven's deeds to certain property
claimed by the estate of James G. Fair,
was brought to a head jnst before Judge
lack adjourned yesterday's session of
that now celebrated trial.
While the explosion was not altogether
unexpected, still the opinion was rife that
the attorneys for Mrs. Craven intended to
reserve it for an occasion later in the pro
ceedingsâprobably for their opening
statement â and then the summoning of
important witnesses to substantiate the
grave charges preferred.
It was a sensational incident. Herbert
Clarke, the nervous, uncertain, hesitating
and effeminate valet of the dead million
aire, was on tbe witness-stand and was
undergoing a vitriolic cross-examination
at the hands of tbat master of the art,
that Nemesis of all witnesses who are
shaky of their facts and not emphatic in
establishing the truthfulness of their
statements.
Clarke had been called by the executors'
counsel to testify that he and Senator
Fair hp_nt the 24th of September, 1894, in
San Rafael, and therefore the millionaire
could not have been on this side of the
.ay on that day to deliver the deeds to
Mrs.* Craven, as she stoutly asserts. Tho
ex-valet had told all this and was being
drawn upon for more details by Mr.
Foote. ClarKe was evasive, but the attor
ney was tenacious and clung to the wit
neÂ«a relentlessly. lie finally wrung from
him virtually the admission that ever
since Mrs. Craven made the fact public
that Senator Fair had given her the dis
puted deeds the San Francisco Police De
partment had been given over to the serv
ice of a private cause in one side ol a civil
suit, instead of devoting its energies in be
half of the commonwealth which created
it and supported it.
Clarke confessed that he had been
"ordered" by Captain I. W. Lees, who at
that time was at the bead of the City's
detective department, to meet him at the
office of Pierson <_ Mitchell, of counsel for
the Fair estate, and thence accompahy
him and Detective John Seymour to San
Rafael for the purpose of hunting up evi
dence for the plaintiff-.' side of the civil
suit now in progress, and against the de
fense.
Clarke did not know at that particular
time that the City does not nay its de
tectives and police to neglect the munici
pality and dabble or take sides in civil
suitsâ and still draw their salariesâ but
he has evidently learned it since then, for
he essayed yesterday to avoid giving in
formation oil the subject, and would have
done so had nut Mr. Foote pursued him
so determinedly.
The attorneys for the plaintiffs, who
had been so ably assisted at the City's ex
pense, grew anxious when they became
aware that the truth was gradually, word
by word, being draeged from Clarke, and
finally, becoming desperate, got up and
interposed most strenuous objections to
any further pursuance of this subject by
Mr. Foote.
This gave Mrs. Craven's attorney the op
portunity he wanted. Before a ruling was
given on these objections he tooK the floor
ana, with a voice that rang through the
courtroom like a bell, announced that the
defense demanded the privilege cf show
ing the jury that tbe San Francisco Police
Department, instead of extending its pro
tecting hands to the people who gave it
life, had been converted into, a private,
agency for the purpose of serving private
ends; that instead of attending to i's du
ties here its minions bad been prowling
around outside counties in search of evi
dence and witnesses for one side of a civil
proceeding.
Quite an uproar followed this declara
tion, and in the midst of it Judge Slack
ordered court adjourned until next Mon
day. There wiil be more oi the scandal on
that day. .
Intimations have been permitted to go
out several times during the progress of
this trial that the defense intended to call
attention to this unheard of and scandal
ous abuse of public confidence by the
Police Department.
D. M. Deimas, in cross-examining the
plaintiffs' witnesses, and especially these
hailing frora San Rafael, has taken pains
to bring out the fact repeatedly that they
were subpenaed by Detective Seymour;
that he had paid them their fees and
mileage, and in short, that he was acting
as outside man and evidence-hunter or
the Fair estate. Captain Lees' name was
frequently brought out, too, showing that
he had taken an unusual interest in this
private litigation.
When court convened yesterday morn
ing W. B. Schneider, the San Rafael liv
eryman, took the stand aeain for further
cross-examination by the defense. Mr.
Deimas questioned Schneider at length
regarding his method of keeping his ac
counts. cash book, by which the wit
ness aided himself in remembering that
Matt Gill'gan arrived in San Rafael on the
22d of September. I?-*-, received part.cular
j attention and was exhibited to the jury.
Mr. Deimas found that Schneider had not
been in the habit of inserting his entries
in chronological order. A payment made
on February 21, 1594. for instance, would
be found to immediately succeed one of
October 31 of the same year, and Septem
ber would precede January. The book
was found to be full of this kind of en
tries. Scnneider could not explain satis
factorily.
Tim Connolly, the San Rafael bus
A Quiet Little Chat During the Afternoon Recess in the Fair Trial.
driver, was called to the witness-stand after i
Schneider left. In answer to Mr. Mc-
Enerney's questions Tim said he was em
-1 ijyed by W. IL Jewell, who owns the
bus privileges in San Rafael. Witness
-taÂ« driving a bus in September, 1894. He
said he remembered having seen Senator
Fair in San Rafael at that time. The lat
ter arrived there en a Wednesday and
got into the witness' bus. He was driven
to the Parisian House and "stood off " tne
witness for the 10 cents due for the ride.
He saw him again on the 251h, when the
Senator returned to San Francisco.
Mr. Deimas interrupted at this juncture
i to inquire the reason, the opposing side
had tor wasting time in proving that
I Fair was in San Rafael when it had not
i been disputed.
"We are showing now that he was there
| on the 25th, though, ' said Mr. McEner
i ney.
"Well, what of that?"
"Will you admit that he was there ou
I that date? '
"Certainly; we never disputed that."
This was a surprise for tne plaintiff's
side, but the quiet smile Mr. Deimas wore
robbed the attorneys of the comfort they
would otherwise have drawn from his an
nouncement.
The examination of Tim Connolly was
j resumed at the afternoon session.
Attorney McEnerney wanted to know if
I the witness had a conversation with his
j employer, Jewell, on the 24th of Septem
ber, 1894, at the broad-gauge depot, and,
more than that, he wanted to know what
thai conversation was. But Mr. Deimas
objected and there was a little tiff over the
I point. The court finally ruled that the
I evidence was admissible, and thereupon
j Tim went on to relate that Jewell
i "jumped" him because he had not
brought Senator Fair down to the depot
â¢ in (he bus.
Connolly was now turned over to the
j tender mercies of Mr. Deimas for cross
! examination, In answer to the latter'a
I questions Tim said he did not Know tbe
name of the waiter whom he thought had
j told him about Senator Fair's illness. He
: didn't tuliiK he bad ever seen him again
I after that day. He knew Cassou, how
ever, quite well. Connolly said lie s.iw
j Fair on the 19ih of September â day
I he arrived in San Rataelâ and was quite
j sure that the millionaire returned to San
I Francisco on the 25th.
"Who first spoke to you about being a
witness in this case?'' asked Mr. Deimas.
Connolly thought it was Mr. Jewell, but
I he could not remember when 11 was.
i Probably last summer some time- In
fact, Tim's memory was not very good on
any point except as regards Fair's visit to
San Rafael.
â¢ "Don't you think you could recollect
what day of the. week it was when he
i talKed to you about this matter? ' was

_â¢ "I think it was a Sunday. I remember
I that I was sittii:_. on a fence at the time."
"Is sitting on a fence a regular Sunday

"I sit there every day," replied Con
nolly, who did not relish tne laugh that
went up from the crowd.
It was Jewell who first recalled to Tim's
mind the fact that Senator Fair had been

"W at kind of a looking man was Seua

Tim couldn't remember. He did not
know whether the j millionaire wore a
beard or was smooth shaven.
Herbert ' Clarkeâ be insists that it must
be spelled with an "c" â was now called.
He was Senator Fair's valet from 1883 un
til the time ofthe miner's death. He was
engaged by him in London.
Clarke said that he remembered a visit
that he ana the Senator made to San
Rafael in September, 1894. They left this
side of the bay on tbe l'.Hh and remained
there until the 25th. They did not stay
there continuously, as on the 20ih they
went to San Francisco and buck, and
again on the 21st. He was sure that the
Senator did not leave San Rafael from
the _2d to the 25th. Pflt3a
"What was the condition of Senator
Fair's health during his stay in San
Rafael? ' asked Mr. McEnerney. V
"He was quite sick," replied Clarke.
"All of the time?"
"Most of the time."
Mr. McE .erney wanted to know if the
Senator had had any parliculariy bad
spells, but this met with an objection.
The question was remodeled and then al
lowed, and Clarke said that his employer
experienced some very . severe breathing
spells and suffered irom nausea.
This ended tbe direct examination and
Clarke went into the hands of Attorney
Foote. Only a few questions had been
asked and answered when it became ap
parent that Clarke was in for a great
raking over the coals. Tie attorneys for
the plaintiff* were continually jumping
up with objections in order to save the
discomfited valet. Mr. Foote started off
to drag from the witness the history of his
life, but this brought forth a storm of ob
jections, and the court ruled against him.
Mr. Foote said he wished to prove that
Clarke was a man not to be believed.
"li permitte_,"hesaid, "he would show
that this man was like a lot of others who
came to this country; that be is a schemer
who has posed as a scion of nobility; that
be has gone around bilking hotel?; that
he has been borrowing money on false
representations and that he is an all-round
fraud."
Bat Judge Slack ruled that Clarke's
record could not be put in evidence, and
the valet heaved a sich of relief.
It was then .hat the police scandal,
detailed above, came out. Mr. Foote, by
dint of persistent questioning, succeeded
in getting admissions from Clarke regard
ing the interest the police Pad taken in
the executors' side of the case, and when
an objection was raised to tho line of
questioning, he made the charge that bids
fair to uncover a reeking scandal in the
Police Department. Adjournment fol
lowed. Judge slack announcing that lie
would not hold court again until next
Monday.
WILL INVESTIGATE.
Commissioners Tobin and Alvord
Astounded Over the Revelations
,In the Fair Case.
As the result of the developments in
the Fair case yesterday there will in all
likelihood be an investigation of the
methods and work of the Police Depart
ment by t c Board of Police Commis
sioners on Wednesday next.
When the facts tbat closed the hearing
of the case so dramatically yesterday were
brought to the attention of Commission
ers Tobin and Alvord they were so as
tounded that they could scarcely bring
themselves into a frame of mind to con
ceive so gross a breach of decency, of duty
and of law.
Even when informed that the peculiar
proceedings of the detective department
were matters of court record â statements
sworn to by witnesses and charges made
in open court by an attorney â they refused
to discuss the matter as a reality. Both
members of the board, however, declared
that if there were any reason to believe
that any member of the Police Depart
ment had been acting as a procurer of
wltne. s=.s or of testimony in a civil case
the matter would certainly be investigated.
"So far as the civil case is concerned,"
said Commissioner Tobin when the sub
ject was first broached, "you may be sure
that they have done nothing about it.
They have no right to take any part in
such a proceeding unless it were a case of
public justice. I feel sure it will be found
on investigation that those men were pur
suing some criminal or other."
"It -.ii brought out in evidence that
Detective Seymour had served witnesses
for the plaintiffs with subpenas, had paid
them their witness fees and their mile
age," vouchsafed the reporter. "Are
members of the Police Department per
mitted to act in sucb a capacity?" .
"Never," quickly replied Mr. Tobin.
"If that has been done it was wrong. No
member of the department has any busi
ness at all in a civil case. You may be
sure that neither Crowlev nor Lees would
permit such a thing. "Whatever they did
was in pursuance of some criminal mat
ter."
"But the fact Is on record that Seymour
did act in th>. civil case," persisted the in
terviewer.
"Of course, if that be the case," contin
ued Commissioner Tobin, "the board
would take action -on it. We feel very
proud of that department, Mr. Alvord
and I." i^m^lM^mSS l^ma^il\^Sam^*W*WmM
Commissioner Alvord was equally loth
to believe that there bad been so flagrant
a violation of right. But when the details
we i e related to him he stated that the
matter would be taken up at the next
meeting of the commission, on Wednes
day next.

The San Aaselmo Seminary
Banquet Springs a Little
Sensation.
A PLEA FOE A COVENANTER
SPIRIT.
The Variou. Toasts Rendered on the
Occasion â Vccal So os by Mrs.
Ceil Mark
Last evening'? anniversary banquet in
honor of the quarter-centennial of the
San Francisco Theological Seminary, held
l under the anspices of the Presbyterian
Ministerial Association at the Occidental
Hotel, will be an occasion long remem
bered in local religious circles.
It should always be as .i green spot in
the memory of Professor Howison of the
State University, and Rev. Dr. Ruder, pas
tor of the Third Congregational Church
of this City, also, for they came in tor
especial mention in a way that could
hardly be construed as complimentary.
At 7:30 p. m. the spacious dining-iiall of
the hotel presented a scene of beauty and
gaycty. The guests were all assembled at
that hour, representing both ministers
and laymen prominent in the churches
around th. bay, with their wivos and
daughters, and many from interior cities
and towns. . f. .-â .â "â¢"- ..'
After the banquet was over Rev. Dr. H.
A. Ketchum, acting as toastroaster, intro
duced Dr. H. C. Minion, moderator of the
San Au.eltuo Seminary, who was listed to
speaK on "Denominational Loyalty."
His speech was the sensation of the even
ing. The applause which greeted his
references to Professor Howison and
Rev. Dr. Raier showed that ne had struck
the Keynote of his audience's sympathy.
Dr. Minton began by calling this a Pres
byterian family reunion. Unlike the Rev.
Mr. Mathena and others, he believed that
such banquets are entirely too infrequent
and arc good things to cultivate bocia
bility. He continued:
Presbyterian. am is not a new thing under
the sua. Tho first minister whoever set foot
ou California soil was a Presbyterian.
A backward glance reveals weaknesses and
mint* ken, and yet the first half century of our
history in this State ii near enough to its c oÂ»e
toenaole us to anticipate the verdict,'Pres
byterlauism once again welched in the bal
ance and not found wanting."
Intellectuality is an epithet often applied to
us. They say we are cold, heartless, all brains.
Well, we ara not behind in other things. Still,
we have always put tremendous emphasis
upon creed, conviction, education.
It (alls to our church to stand with others as
a breakwater against the tides of onti-Chrifr
tlau philosophy that arc M bold on this coast.
Pre.byterlanlsm can bank a little on its his
tory when It is he'd up by a proud and super
cilious phllokophy. >st Augustine was com
petent to teach lessons to all the Dnrwtns,
Wallaces, Haeckels, Spencers and Howisons
that ever existed. Not even the Rev. Dr.
Ruder, who so eloquently falls in line with
the latter great philosopher, can ever hope to
emulate him. John Calvin had a meta
physical instinct that would have justified an
ambition to oreanlzo a philosophical union
on the hanks of Lake Geneva.
The true idea of Christian philosophy does
not originate . in the cla__r oom of any univer
sity, but ln the church. There is danger of
our being intimidated by the toplofty ore-ten
sions of those who, in the name of the Eternal
Reason and by the methods of the Eternal
Nonsense, would, as Gail Hamilton wou.d say,
"fain pass the impossible and scout the In
scrutable." . '.-:â â â :
Woen a philosopher gives to the world his
pronuueiameuto one day and must come out
the next day telling what he did mean and
what he did not mean, he li like the man who
wrote a story without head or tall.
Truth is bound to uo zone or sphere. We
must have a philosophy large enough to make
room for God, a living God, a personal God, a
free God, a God not tied to metaphysical neces
sity nor bound by impersonal law. .
. If God is without free will God is less than
man, and the whirling universe is untenanted
of its Creator. We* believe In eternal reason,'
or, rather, we believe in the Eternal Reasoner;
and we are cowards if we suffer the truth to
be traduced without protest and valiant fight.
There was great applause when Dr.
Minton concluded.
Various other subjects were discussed by
different speakers as follows: "The Soli
darity of the Coast," Dr. Arthur Crosby;
"Coast Preparation for a Coast Min
istry," Rev. Dr. Martin of San Ra
fael; "The Need of the Presby
terian Type of Christian Work on the
Pacific Coast," D. Edward Collins; "The
Presbyterians and Civil Liberty," Rev.
Dr. John R. Worrall of Danville, N. V. :
"The Helpmeet in Presbvtertanlsm,"
Frank S. Bush; "Presby terianism and
Young People," Rev. Alfrrd Croco of So
nora. Interludes of vocal music were
rendered by Mrs. Cecil Mark, known as
"The Sweet Singer of California." owing
to her work among the Endeavorers be
fore her marriape.
Rev. Dr. Coyle of Oakland delivered the
final toast on the '-Spirit of the Cove
nant." He believed that more of the
Covenanter spirit is needed on this coast,
"where men are too likely to vibrate back
and fortb in the shadowy arc of theory
and speculation."
Dr. Mackenzie â  delivered the benedic
tion. All crowded around Dr. Minton in
the reception-room and gave him a hearty
handshake for his defense of the churcb.
The entertainment committee, which
brought tbe affair to such a successful fru
ition, was composed of: Rev. S. S,
Palmer, Rev. F. R. Farrand, Rev. Dr. H.
C. Minton, D. Edward Collins and J. G.

TOOK OUT THE WINDOWS.
Michael Mooney Sues John Elgin, Hia
' Landlord, for Damages lv the
. Justice Court.
According to the allegations of a com
plaint filed in the Justice Court yesterday,
John Elgin, the landlord of a house at 43
West Mission street, has taken an original
and drastic method of ousting his tenants.
Michael Mooney, who with his family oc
cupies an upper flat In the structure, has
sued Elgin for $209 damages as the result
of his action.
Mooney says that a short time ago he
fell into arrears in his rent for a small
amount and asked the landlord to be pa
tient, as he would be able to pay soon.
Elgin demurred, but finally consented
to wait a few days. At the end ot the
time specified, as the coin was not forth
coming he turned oft the water and re
moved the windows from the fiat, leaving
the occupants at the mercy of the night
winds.
The plaintiff alleges that by reason of
the cold Â«nd exposure tbey were made ill
and much humiliated, and that only an
a .varti in the coin of the realm will soothe
their wounded feeiincs.
A PIONEER GRAIN
FIRM ATTACHED
Georga Morrow & Co. in
Serious Financial
Difficulties.
The London, Paris and American
Bank Was Aggres
sive.
The pioneer bay and grain firm of
George' Morrow <t Co. is involved in seri
ous financial difficulties.
Two attachments were levied upon the'
old bou.eat _*_Â» Clay street yesterday, and
they are of such a nature that even hope
ful friends of this popular, firm are ex
pressing tbe fear tbat it tuny be forced -to
the wall. One of these attachments em
anated from the London. Paris and
American Bank and was to cover on obli
gation of $21,500 due on a promissory note.
The ether was tor $1057 and was issued by
I the firm of H. Dntaid -fc Co. This, too, is
I on a note.
George P. Morrow, when seen last even
ing, declined to discuss his misfortune
further than lo say that he was greatly
surprised at what bad occurred, though
he didn't blame the bank. He hoped and
expected to soon be on bis feet and doing
business again at the old stand. He felt
sure that the house's affairs would be sat
isfactorily adjusted.
From what can be gathered from other
sources it appears that the bank people
got frightened because of a recent transfer
of some property by Alexander 0. Mulli
gan. Mr. "Morrow's partner. Suspicious,
as banks always are, this was construed
into a possible indication that prepara
tions were on foot for an assin mentor
something of the sort. Dutard & Co. took
the hint, too, and assumed the aggressive
along with the bank.
. Mr. Morrow is a resident of Oakland,
an.l owns considerable property over
there. The London, Paris and American
Bank took the precaution of attaching
this property too, yesterday, in order to
be even more certain of recovering the
amount of its loan.
Sympathy is everywhere expressed in
business circles for the embarrassed firm.
The gentlemen composing it are univets
aliy liked and admired both for their busi
ness-methods and their personal attrib
utes. The hope is expressed that they
will find their troubles short-lived, and
soon be back on tht. highroad to pros
perity. _ â  '-.'.â Vr-.
MARKED PROGRESS.
Gratifying. Report Submitted ./it the
Quarterly Meeting of the German
Benevolent Society.
The German General Benevolent Society
held its first quarterly meeting tbis year
at Druids' Hall last night. â._!;":"
President B. Broemmel stated tbat the
report for the quarter was most gratify
ing. There was an Increase in the re
serve funds of $3933 05, derived exclu
sively from the regular resources, snch
as membership dues and initiation foes
and hospital surplus, the latter resulting
from a largely augmented patronage and
able management.
New members and subscribers for the
past quarter amounted to 115, bringing
the total up to 3266.
The charity branch of the society had
not been neglected, the amount expended
reaching $2395.
The work of the City Physician had
increased to such an extent as to render
tbe employment of another physician ab
solutely necessary, and 0. L. L.ich'.er, W.
Copmann, Dr. G. Gutsch, C. Uhlig and C.
Hess, were appointed a committee to
report on the proposition at the next
general meeting. ..-?:;:

League of the Cross Cadets
Judged by United States
0 ficers.
Ei_.__t Hundred Youths Passed in
Review fore Generals James
and Warfield.
It was not a National convention that
assembled in tbe Mechanics' Pavilion last
evening, although the multitude which
crowded the tiers and galleries well might
be mistaken for the audience on one of
those historical occasions, but it was an
outpouring of men, women and children
to witness one of the finest displays in
marching evolutions ever uiven by young
men and boys from 16 years upward.
These were the L3ague of the Cross
Cadets, 800 as bright and trim young men
as ever appeared before a San Francisco
public. The occasion was the. tbird an
nual competitive drill for tile Bishop
Montgomery trophy, Company C having
won it the first year, and Company G the
second.
The regiment was under command of a
veteran militiaman, Colonel William P.
Sullivan, late commanding officer of the
First Regiment, National Guard of Cali
fornia.
One of the features of the occasion was
the concert by the league band of forty
pieces, under the leadership of Julius L
Weyand.
In the reviewing-stand sat Archbishop
Riordan, Bishop Montgomery. Vicar-Gen
eral Very Rev. Father Prendergast, Chan
cellor Yorke. Rev. Father Friedem, Supe
rior of the Jesuits; Rev. Father O'Ryan,
spiritual director of the League of the
Cross, and a large number of other clergy
men, representing the different Catholic
orders.
The military was represented by Major-
General J__n.es and staff, _.. G. C. ; Briga
dier-General Warfield and staff, N. G. C. ;
Colonel James F. Smith of the First
Regiment, N. G. C, and others. ' "â '
Trie judges of the contest were officers
of the United Stales army â Captain C. G.
Starr of tbe First Infantry, Lieutenant J.
E. Nolan of the Fourth Cavairy and Lieu
tenant J. D. Miley of the Fifth Artillery.
The civic branch of the Government'
was represented by Mayor Phelan.
The trophy is a large rold medal, stua
ded with diamonds, pendent from a bar of
gold, which bears upon it the name of the
trophy. The center of the medal proper
i- embellished with a portrait of Bishop
Montgomery in ivory.
Any company winning the trophy for
three consecutive years becomes its owner
absolutely, and it will not in such event
be any longer a subject of competition.
At the first competitive drill for the
trophy, held in May, 1885. it was won by
Company C of St. Patrick's .parish. Cap
tain Edward Fitzgerald. At thu second
drill, in April, 1596, Company G, com
manded by Captain E. J. Power, was vic
torious. -Â'>_,..-,.->:
A short time ago a preliminary "try
out" competition was held, -so as to nar
row the contest down to four ot the thir
teen companies, the four successful ones
being Company A, Cathedral parish. F. S.
Brady, captain.; Company D of sacred
Heart parish, J. J. McÃride, captain;
Company G of St. Brigid's, E. J. Power,
Captain,* and Company H of St. Bren
dan's, J. H. Powers, captain.
Thirty-nine picked men, including the
officers, represented each company in the
drill. Â£ach captain as he appeared on the
floor with his company was banded the
owing routine card:,
Open ranks; close ranks; form column of
fours to the right and halt; form line to the
left and move forward; turn to the left and
halt; movo forward in line; march in column
of fours to the front; march the column of
fours to the rear; form line to the front
and halt; . mnrch in line to the
rear; puss obstacle on the right;
reiorm company; lorm column of fours to the
right and change direction to the right; form
line on the right; form column of platoons to
the right and hall ; put column in march and
change direction twice; form line to the right
and continue the march; form column of
platoons to tbe fiont; reform company to the
front and halt; advance in line of platoons in
columns of fours; firm column of platoons;
form line on the riirht and halt facing the re
viewing stand; present the company.
The time occupied by each company
was as follows: Company D, 10 minutes;
Company H, 9 minute:.; Company G, 8
minutes, and Company A, 7 minutes.
The contest was very close between the
companies, but the work of Company A
was marred by a miscalculation of the
captain, which resulted in crowding a
part of his company to the wall.
A wild yell of applause went up when
the announcement was made that the
troph* had been won the second time by
Comrauy G. Captain Power was a proud
youn-, man when Bishop Montgomery
pinned the medal on his breast.
A pleasing feature of the occasion was
the drill of the hospital corps, in i-oing
after and bringing wounded soldiers to
the front. â  "*__SM_S-__^S__S__s__S_e_Â£__SH

ket opened firm and tract onally higher. Dealings
centered in a few slocks and were entirely devoid
of feature except that Jersey Central showed a loss
of % . London quotations for American*, showed
an easier tendency. Specialties receded generally
during the early hour the heaviness being at
tribute! to special causes. Western Union was
sensitive, owing to the revival of unfavorable gos
sip as to the forthcoming dividend action.

rumors of intervention in the Grteco-Turkish
troubles, but was not reflected here and failed to
prevent a fresh attack upon Jersey Central or de

DECIDIOtS AND UITKUS FKUITS.
Receipts of Strawberries were 159 chests.
Turing th. past 24 hours a great change has
come over tbe Calilornia F'rult outlook for this
year. Reports from Chicago say that the Peach
crop is a practical lallure throughout the YVestern
States and that the Apple crop bids fair to be
light. A dispatch from New York says: "From a
thorough investigation by a fruit expert It seems
probable that at least nine-tenths of the anticipat
ed large crop of Plums. Peaches and Cherries along
the Hudson River were des.royeu by the recent
frost, lhe same result Is feared in New Jersey
and Delaware."
Private vices from New York confirm this
dispatch and at t his writing lt appears that tbe
Fruit crop throughout the Eastern country has
suffered severe damage. The result of tins news
Is already seen in the advanced estimates which
dea are making tor pr.ces of Fruit this year.

VEEY COMMON THINGS.
Pincers are made by a machine which
in one operation cuts out the handle and
jaw. The two parts are afterward joined
by hand.
Bayonets are now altogether machine
mane, a very simple, as well as clever,
contrivance, stamping the steel into proper
shape.
Dice are made from ivory or bone, a
cutting machine reducing the cubes to
near the size required, after which they
are polibhed, generally by hand.
Nails are now made by machinery, rib
bons, or long slips of iron or stee! Deing
fed to machines, which cut out the nails
complete at one stroke.
Brooms are made by both hand and ma
chine labor. The broom-making machine
is pronounced by expert* to be one of the
marvels of the mechanic's art-
Umbrellas are now almost exclusively
machine made, the various parts â ribs,
stock*, handles and tips â being separately
manufactured and put together hv hand.

___ Broadway, April 29. f
Miss Elsie Kathbone considers she has
a very be grievance airainst Secretary
"Welch of the children's society. Without
cause, she says, Welch ordered her to be
taken to a girls' home in San Francisco
ana kepi there for several days in distinct
opposition to the will and wish of the
girl's legal guardian.
A few days aco the father of Elsie came
MISS ELSIE RATHBONE, Who Declares That Secretary We'ch
Kept Her a Prisoner Unjustly.
to Oakland. For various good reasons j
the young lady has been placed under the
guardianship of Mrs. Prescott and is now j
attending a well-known scholastic insti- [
tution iv this city. Her father wished to |
take her across the bay with him to visit j
some relatives. The giri had been partic- j
ularly instructed by her cuardian that I
under no circumstances should she cross i
the bay without express permission.
When herfather arrived Elsie says Mrs. i
Prescott was in San Francisco at Secretary
"Welch's office, and in order to obey her l
instructions the eirl and her father went
to Sim Francisco and called on Welch j
for the pose of meeting if possible
Elsie's euardian.
Mrs. Prescott was not there, and Welch
made some inquiry of the father, found
out the circumstances attending their
visit, at once forbade her to remain with
her parent, and in charge of an officer
sent her to a girls' home.
Elsie has always been well cared for and
carefully protected from pernicious in
fluences. At the home she met all classes
of girls, whose conduct and language
were a great surprise to her and caused
her to recoil from contact with them.
Her guardian telephoned to Secretary
Welch, but could do nothing, and was too
busy for several days to cross the bay.
When, however, she did go to the home,
she was refused permission to see the
cuild of which she is the legal custodian, i
and was told that without a written order j
from Weich she could not get Elsie. Be
ing of a determined disposition she called
on President Sonntag of the society, and
when she returned to Oakland Elsie was
with her and without a written order.
In telling her story Elsie was com
pletely broken-hearted over the fact that
she bad been imprisoned for five days
against her will, with no reason or jus
tice, and she concluded by stating that
she was very pleased that there was to be
a change of secretaries on the Ist of May. i
so that no other little girls are likely to
be treated in the same manner.
When asked about the case. Mrs. Pres
cott stated that it would be very mad
v sable for one branch of an organization
to criticize the head office. Although not
denying the facts thai were presented to
her, she declined to discues the matter
further.
DEPUTIES IN DANGER.
Changes Being Made in the
Eerke.ey Marshal's
Office.
Marshal Lloyd Be Left Without
Any D puties to Help
Him.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 29.â pro
posal of A. R. Fiann. the new Trustee of
Ward 4, to abolish one of the deputy mar
shalships has aroused a controversy over
the business of the Marshal's office, and it
is now proposed to do away with both
deputies.
Trustee Frann declares that the three
men in th Marshal's office ar. virtually
doing nothing most of the time, and that
their employment is a waste of public
money.
"I am informed that a goodly part of
the Marshal's time is taken up in collect
ing license money," said Trustee Frann.
"What reason is there for paying a man
$150 per month to do what the clerk or
Assessor could do as well as not? If a
license be not paid a notice by mail ought
to be n sufficient demand, to be followed
by a hne lor non-payment within proper
time.
"This would enable the Marshal to at
tend to the duties of his office instead of
going about collecting licenses."
It is now proposed that both Deputy
Marshals be discharged and a number of
â¢pecial watchmen be employed on lees.

An Old Suit Dismissed.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 29.â Judge Ells
worth dismissed a suit to-day that has
been pending in the courts for tifteen
years. The suit was brought in 1832 by
H. P. Irvine and has been carried on by the
executors since the death of the plaintiff*.
It involved the ownership of several
blocks of land in tho center of Oakland,
and was dismissed to-day on a technical
ity. It was shown that when the sum
monses were served tiiteen years ago no
returns were made, so the case fell
through.
Blair Estate Division.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 29â The ref
eree* in the suit of Florence Blair against
the Oakland Bank of Savings et al. made
a renort yesterday. They appraise all the
property, together with imi rovement-, at
$184,028. They give to Mabel Squires
tbree-lourths of the Blair ranch, valued
V $50,128. while Florence Blair has one
fourt . of the same, but the letter is also
awarded property in Pleasant Valley
valued at $12,532. To satisfy the interest
of Mabel Squires the latter is granted
twenty-five acres beyond Mountain View
Cemetery valued at $37,596. It is more
than probable that the report of the ref
erees will be accepted by the litigants
and the case decided out of court.
No Desire for Municipal Ownership.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 29.â The City
Council does not look favorably on any
action tending toward an official discus
sion of the municipal ownership of water
plants. They voted down the resolution

mittee of fifty to inquire into the matter,
and now they have declined to allow the
use of the council chamber for public
meetings to consider the proposition.

ment the Weider divorce case.
FULFILLING HER DEAD MOTHER'S AMBITION.
OAKLAND, cal., April 29 âMiss Grace Dottea Fisher has fulfilled her mother's dying am
bition. Mrs. Kate Fisher, for many years a teacher in the Oakland public schools, brought up
her daughter with the purpose of having her make her mark if possible on the histrionic stage
Two years ago when Mrs. Fisher died >he received on her deathbed a dispatch for which she
had long looked, stating thai her daughter had made a start and had received an offer of an
engagement with Mod jeska. After her mother's death Miss Grace Fisher determined more
than ever to make a success in her chosen profession, and according to Eastern critics she has
now ln one of the Frohraan companies achieved marked succuss in several difficult roles.
Miss Fisher is an Oakland girl who completed her studies in the public schools and went
East to master dramatic art. When the local amateur Charity Company was at its zenith in
this city Miss Fisher occupied leading parts ana even then showed evidences of her ability.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 1897.
CAMERON'S OFFER
QUICKLY GRASPED
A Nameless Proposal to
Save Money O.ficially
Recognized.
City Clerk Tompkins' Forma
Note Asking for Bondsmen
With "Public Spirit"
A Street- Opening Episode That Is
Ending Very Differently Frcm
the Way It Began.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, April 29. [
A few days ago there was some dissatis
faction over the widening of East Twenty
first street. In an unlucky moment an
anonymous correspondent sent a letter to
a local newspaper stating that it would be
a waste of public money to procure bonds
at the expense of the city for the com
missioners, as there were plenty of public
spirited citizens of East Oakland who
would be quite willing to giye necessary
bonds free of char-re.
Councilman Howe, who represents the
Seventh Ward, cncouraeed this letter from
the anonymous correspondent by intro
ducing into the Council a resolution ap
propriating $150 to enable the Commis
sioners to procure bonds. As soon as he
had read the correspondent's letter he im
mediately picked up the gauntlet and
published a statement that he would re
sind the resolution and take the anony
mous writer at his word.
This action of Councilman Ro e brought
out the fact that the unknown was H. M.
Cameron, a resilient of East Oakland, and
now he cannot with dignity recede from
his hasty offer, as it has been officially
recognized.
To-day City Clerk Tompkins addressed
the following communication to Mr.
Cameron:
Hugh M. Cameron Esq., 1,79 Mnth street, Oak
land, Cal.â My Dear fciÃ: At a meeting of the
Street Committee of the City Council, held
last eveaing, Mr. Rowe brought up the matter
of the resolution introduced by himself, ap
propriating $150 for the purpose of enabling
the three Commissioners ' appointed in the
opening and widening of East Twenty-first
sireet to secure the {,5000 bonds exacted by
the provisions of the street law. Inasmuch as
the gentlemen composing tr.e commission ex
pressed their willingness to serve in that ca
pacity wituout compensation, it could
not be expected they would go down
into their pockets and give their money
as well as their time, and it Deing
anticipated they would procure their bonus
irom a surely company it was thought
to be only just and fair that the city should
pay the cost of same. It has been reported
tha' you nave stated that this outlay was un
necessary, as the Commissioners would have
no difficulty in procuring bondsmen from
, among tae public-spirited citizens of East
'. Oakland, and tnat if called upon you would
j see that the required bondsmen were forth
| coming. I am directed by the Street Com
| mittee to say to you that If you will secure the
! necessary bondsmen Mr. Howe will have re
scinded the resolution making the appropria
i tion for that purpose. I will draw up the
. bunds and if the bondsmen will be good
j enough to call at this .ffice I will subscribe
: and swear them, thus saving the Commission
ers the expense incident to this feature of
; their duties.
The precedent for appropriations of this
i sort was created when the Commissioners
i were appointed for the opening of a street
j through Cemetery Creek Canyon. They were
allowed $75 each for the purpose of teimburs
j ing them for any expens. they might be put
j to in giving the necessary bonds, and no hue
I and cry was raised, as the property-owners mi
i terested concluded they were getting a com
j mission cheap enough at that figure.
The Street Committee fee. a that the criti
i cisms resulting from Mr. Rowe's attempt to
prevent the gent tmen who so kindly volun
teered to give their services as Commissioners
in the opening of East Twenty-first street a
personal expense are unjust and uncalled for.
Tne Commissioners in giving their time are
j saving the property-owners interested in
! this Improvement considerable money, and
Mr. Rowe in procuring such generous-minded
; citizens to act in that capacity without com-
I pensation is deserving of anything but cen
sure.
Trusting you may be able to arrange this
matter so that the much-debated resolution
may be rescinded at next Monday evening's
Council meeting I remain sincerely yours,
J. W. Thompson, City Clerk.
Oakland, Cal., April 2*, 1897.
ATTEMPTED BUEGLARY.
A Would-Be Thlet Frightened Away by
a Vc, . 1,, .in
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 29.â A burglar
attempted to enter the residence of John
Soltau at 2917 Lincoln avenue the other
evening, but was frightened away by Mrs.
Seltau. She was awakened by the noiseof
some one trying to open a window on the
lower floor and looking out she saw a man
at work there. She immediately called to
the man and demanded his name, saying
that if he did not give it sue would sum
mon the police by means of a whistle.
The burglar did not wait to hand up his
card, but dtsappeated in, the darkness
without having replied to Mrs. Seltau's
inquiry.
A GAMBLING CASE.
Probability i li:_! the Conviction of Joe
limerick Will .Not Be
Sustained.
ALAMEDA Cal., April Some time
ago Joseph Emerick was convicted in
Recorder St. Sure's court of keeping a
Rambling place and was fined $100, with
the alternative of fifty days' imprison
ment. He toot an appeal and the case
came before Judge Ogden of the Superior
Court. It is now intimated that the con
viction will be overruled on a technical
ity. According to an amendment to the
Civil Code passed at the instance of
Judge Ellsworth and others, in cities of
the fifth class, to which Alameda belongs,
when prosecutions for misdemeanor are
instituted it is not made necessary to in
troduce the charter and the ordinance
which has been violated as evidenc .
Judge Ogden intimates that this is special
legislation, and if so the case will fall to
the ground. A change in such prosecu
tions will have to be made in the future.
Kite Life-Saving Apparatus.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 29.â Dr. Riehl,
a well-known resident of this city, is the
inventor of a novelty in the shape of a
kite-flyine lile-saving apparatus, which is
certainly very ingenious, to say the least,
and which he claims works all right. He
has been endeavoring to persuade the Na
tional Life-Saving Service to take up the
matter and give his scheme a trial, but
MRS. C T. MILLS, Who Has Been President of Mills College
Till Grandchildren Have Eeen Born to Her First Graduates.
j has not succeeded in impressing the au
thorities with its feasibility. He made
due application, but has just received a
letter from Washington that the plans
ana sketches have been examined, but
never having seen a practical' test they do
not feel authorized to move in the matter.
Charged With Insanity. SSSBf
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 29. â J. L.
Schroeder of Oak street and Buena Vista
avenue was anested to-day on complaint
of his son on a charge of insanity. He
has violent spells, when he tears his
clothes and imagines that he is the owner
of any house that strikes his fancy, claim
ing to have the right to enter and take
possession at any time.

FOUNDER'S DAY AT
MILLS COLLEGE
Alnmni and Students to
Honor Its Thirty- First
Birthday.
For a Quarter of a Century It
Has Been Located Near
, Oakland.
Mrs. Mills Still President, Although
Meeting Grandchildren of H r
First Graduates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April __B_ *
For a quarter of a century Mills College
has been sending its graduates out into
the world from Represent location. For
six years previous to the establishment of
the now famous seminary in Alameda
County, the institution was located at
Benicia, and on Saturday next, May day,
its thirty-first birthday wili be celebrated
with fitting ceremony.
Founder's day at Mills always attract
a large gathering. The alumni and
students of the college are now occupying
prominent and noble spheres In woman
life in all parts of the world, and those
who are able always make an effort to at
tend personally on founder's day. while
those who are unable on account of dis
tance, send interesting letters to their old
school companions.
Mills has become so well known that it
is regarded fir more in the licntof a State
institution than a private school.
Mrs. C. T. Mills. 'the principal, speaks of
her family as familiarly as though they
were all her own children. She can re
call nearly every name of the hundreds of
youn__ folks who have been trained for
life's duties within the homelike institu
tion.
At the present time there are living in
this city crandchildren of the first grad
uate from Mills Seminary, and yet the
same beneficent lady presides over the
college. *
On. Saturday next many special num
bers will appear on th- programme. An
invitation has been extended not only to
the alumni, as is usually done on found
er a day, but to all the students that have
ever been within its walls, and, from the
number of acceptances already received,
the seminary wul be a scene of life and
paveiy on May day afternoon.
Miss Jane Seymour Klink, president of
the Mills Alumna. Association, has called
the annual meeting for Saturday morn
ing, and much important business will be
transacted. One of the features of the
afternoon will be the dedication of a Mary
Lyon memorial window. Mary Lyon is
known as the founder of colleges exclu
sively, for women in this country. She
was Mr?. Mills' teacher balf -a century
ago, and her memory is held in great
esteem in every woman's college in the
land. This window has been obtained by
the senior class of under-sjradua.es and is
a very handsome work of art.
After the luncheon on Saturday there
will be the usual reading of letters from
absent graduates. This is always an in
teresting topic, and shows, as nothing else
could, ti.e practical use to which the
writers are puttin.- the knowledge gained
in the pretty Alameda institution.

SEVERE FROSTS IN MANY EAST
ERN STATES.
In Ccns'qu-nce the Price of Canned
Peaches Has Already Risen
in New York.
Porter Bros. & Co. received a letter yes
terday which will be of much interest to
California lrn it-grow It is to the
effect that the Eastern fruit crop will be
short this year. The following is a copy
of the letter:
Chicago, April 22, 1897.
It may interest you 10 know that, in an in
terview with a prominnut green iruit man a
day or two since he informed us that, owing
to the uniavorable season so far, the
peach crop in Georgia will not exceed one
tenth that ot last year. He also confirmed
what we have seen in the papers, that we have
had recently severe frosts on the western
shore Micnigan, though it Is probably yet
too early lor nnv serious damage to result.
This morning we notice telegrams in our
papers from the South of bad Hosts ihat have
injured quite extensively tne blosoming
fruit trees and vines. We, of course, give you
this information tor what it is worth, but we
know we have had a. very late spring, and
quite severe frosts in our own vicinity this
week. A gentleman from Indianapolis was in
our office yesterday and reported a severe
frost for a section of fifty miles about there,
and he is very con rid. Nt (Km age has been done
to the fruits. This information may not be
very valuable as yet, but it may be "straw"
to indicate that a crop so large as last year's
cannot be equaled this.
Mr. Porter said to a Call reporter yes
terday : "Letters received to-day from
New York advise us tbat Baltimore can
ners have advanced their prices on canned
peaches very materially, owing to the
damage to the peninsular peach crop,
many of them asking $1 a dozen more on
gallon fruit than before the report d
damag.e"
OSBORNE MUST RESIGN.
The Directors of the animals' Society
-Yant a New Poundmas
ter.
Frederick A. Osborne, for the past four
years tbe Pound master, stands a pood
chance of losing his job. At a recent
meeting of the Society lor the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals it was found that
the expenses of the society are too bur
densome to be pleasant, in fact it was run
nine behindhand at the rate of $900 a
year. While the Poundmaster is ap
pointed by the Supervisors still it is under
the care and direction of the society.
At the meeting referred to a committee
of five was appointed to ask of Mr. Os
borne if he would serve for nothing or re
sign. Yesterday the society met, and the
Poundmaster gave his reply by letter, in
which he demanded a salary of $75 per
month from January 1, 1597. He declined
to resign. In order to get the sense of the
members a vote to pay Mr. Osborne. the
salary demanded was lost by 7 to 4. A
ballot to see if that salary should be paid
from May 1 was lost by the same vole.
The proposition was then made to ask
Mr. Osborne to resign, and the vote was
7 ior and 3 against, oue director declining
to vote. A committee was thereupon ap
pointed, composed of Messrs. Stevens,
Lissak, Holmes, Gruenhagen and Colonel
Jackson, to see Mr. Osborne and ask him
to step down and out. In the event of his
refusing to resign the committee will pe
tition the Boara of Supervisors to declare
Mr. Osborne's position vacant and to ap
point as his successor Charles B. Hol
brook, the secretary of the society. This
action was taken in view of the fact that
hereafter the headquarters of the society
will be at the Animals' Home, on Six
teenth and Alabama streets, and Mr. Hol
brook can attend to both positions. The

Favorite Prescription. Taken during
pregnancy, the ''Prescription"
HAKES CHILDBIRTH EASY
by preparing the system for parturition,
thus assisting Nature and shortening
"labor." The painful ordeal of child-
birth is robbed of its terrors, and the
dangers thereof greatly lessened, to both
mother and child. The period of confine-
ment is also greatly shortened, the
mother strengthened and built up, and an
abundant secretion of nourishment for
the child promoted. If
THE MARRIED WOMAN
be delicate, run-down, or overworked, it
worries her husband as well as herself.
This is the proper time to build up her
strength ana cure those weaknesses, or
ailments, which are the cause of her
trouble. Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion dispels aches and pains, melancholy
and nervousness, brings refreshing sleep
and makes a new woman of her.

AN IMPORTANT DECISION.
Certain Powers of Boards of Supervis
or* Defined by the Supreme
Court.
A very important matter was decided
yesterday by the Supreme Court in the
ca^3 of C. C. Merriam, an attorney of
Fresno, against H. E. Barnum, the Au
ditor of Fresno County. The importance
lies in the fact that the upper court shows
clearly the lack of power of county Boards
of Supervisors to employ special counsel.
On July Â£9. 1895, the Fresno Courthouse
was partly destroyed by fire and at the
next session of the board Mr. Mertiam
was, by resolution, appointed as special
counsel of the board to attend to all mat
ters pertaining to the reconstruction of
the courthouse, insurance matters, etc.
fie was to receive $125 per month for his
services.
The Supreme Court in its decision states
that the city or District Attorney is the
legal adviser of Boards of Supervisors and
to attend to all legal business for the
same. Only in cases where the county is
a party can special council be employed
io assist the District Attorney. Speaking
of the Supervisors' contract with Merriam
the Supreme Court says:
If this could be done in the face of the law
which limns the power of Boards of Super
visors to the employment of counsel to prose
cute or defend suits, then lt might be done for
any purpose that would meet the views of a
complaisant board. * * * We would have
special counsel for such boards, under sal
aries for $125 a month, advising upon road
matters, others advising upon the collection
of insurance Â» â¢ Â» still others upon the
numberless legal propositions which at one
time or another are presented for the consider
ation of such executive bodies. However val
uable the services of the appellant may have
been to the county in this instance, to permit
compensation for them would be to override
the law and to destroy one of the strongest
safeguards cast about tbe expenditure of
county funds.
XV. T. Andrews' Concert.
There was a very large gathering in the
auditorium of the Young Men's Cnristian As
sociation building, the occasion being a fare
well concert given by William T. Andrews,
the leading tenor of St. Luke's Churcb, prior
to his departure tor Europe, where he is to
study music. Mr. Andrews entered the church
choir when a very young boy and he has re
mained there ever since. He -has many
friends. The programme lust evening was
very interesting and consisted ol ten numbers
by such well-known vocalists as the Calilornia
quartet, Arthur Ficklnscher, Miss Relf.-Byler,
Louis Heine and Mr. Andrews.

work is light and amusing and scintillate,
with Sousa in riches. In order 10 saturate
the performance with an atmosphere of
the waltz king a complete military brass
band is employed in the presentation.
De Wolf Hopper plays the part of a bragga
docious soldier, and has elected to appear
in a make-up resembling the pictures of
Cervantes' hero, Don Quixote.
Tho few carping critics who prophesied
that Irish opera could never be a success
in this City are having their predictions
set at naught, for "Shamus O'Brien" is
filling the Tivoli at every performance
and the advance sale of seats is very
large. Next Monday evening the Bohe
mian Club, of which Denis O'Sullivan is
a member, will give a large theater party
at the Tivoli in honor of his appearance
there.
The rim and spirit in "A Run on the
Bank" have caught the fancy of Colum
bia patrons, and tbe consequence is that
the house is crowded nightly. Ward and
Yokes have surrounded themselves with
a company of clever fun-makers, and.
some of their specialties are new and
fetching. Next w-ek there will be an en
tire change of *-ongs, dances, en. The
spectacular attraction, "Excelsior Jr.,"
will follow "A Run on the Bank."
Tbe Columbia management has been
advised by T. Daniel Frawiey, who Is now
in New York, that he has nearly com
pleted his new company, and it will make
its initial bow to a San Francisco audience
on Monday evening, May 31. and will be
composed of the following ladies and gen
tlemen: Frank Worthing, J. M. Colville,
Theodore Hamilton, T. Daniel Frawiey,
Harry Corson Clarke, Wilson Enos, H. a!
D.iffieid, Gos Bosworth, Thomas Ross,
William Lemon, Blanche Bales, Grace
Henderson, Phoso McAllister, Gladys
Wallis, Madge Carr Cook and Georgia
Bus bey.
Among the plays to be presented during
the season are: "The Fatal Card," "Two
Little Vagrants," .'Sue," "The Henrietta,"
"Aristocracy," "Social Highwayman."
"Tne Case of Rebellious Susan." "Shenan
doah," and a number of others, among
which are several new plays that Manager
Frawiey secured while In Europe.
Steele Mackaye's "A Noble Roj-ue" is
far more consistent and human in its in
terest than the average melodrama, and
it is receiving a good presentation at the
hands of the Alcazar Company. It is a
new departure for this pretty little theater
to indulge in sensational scenic effects,
but although the stage is not very spacious
lor a spectacular display, the bridge scene
is very cleverly and arti-ticaliy arranged,
and never fails to elicit applause.
Mrs. F. M. Bates does some of tbe best
work in the performance as a colored
nurse. Her prayer is a striking bit of
natural acting.
"The Smugglers" gives the Grand an
opportunity of some fine nautical scenic
effects. The scene where a ship is burn
ing at sea is one of the best stave pictures
that Morosco has ever mounted. "The
Smugglers" is well acted and has some
clever specialties.
Alexander Tacianis, the male soprano,
is the most popular attraction at the Or
pbenm this week. His soprano warblings
win him plenty of admirers, and he wins
the friendship of the gallery by the humor
ous way in which he adorns his vocaliza
tion with unexpected notes in a deep bary
tone voice.
Mrs. Carey Higby Dimond has dram
atized one of the "Arabian Night" stories,
"Ali Baba; or. The Forty Thieves," and
she proposes to produce it at the Audi
torium to-morrow night. Mrs. Dimond
has reserved for herself the role of Margi-
I ana, and discarding the baggy trousers
usually associated with the lancinating
slave will wear tights. It would no doubt
have astonished the worthy Ali Baba ex
cessively to see the lady who did so much
for him and for his family thus arrayed,
but "other times, other manners," as the
French say, and Ali Baba did not live in
an age of burlesque.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 1897.
POSTMASTER
THE OFFICE
HE WANTS
Benjamin F. McKinley
Makes Vigorous Entry
Into the Field.
SIX THOUSAND NAMES ON
HIS PETITION.
He Is Now the Worthy Super
intendent of Station F, on
Sacramento Street.
THIS RICHMOND'S ENTRY IS
SUDDEN.
A Respected Civil Service Govern*
ment Clerk Whose Ambition May
Worry Some Good Peop c.
President McKinley's uncle, Benjamin
F. McKinley, who is a well-known and
respected citizen of San Francisco and
now superintendent of station F post-
BENJAMIN F. McKINLEY, Uncle of the President, Who Has
Begun a Vigorous Campaign for the Local Postmastership*
office, is after the postmastership here
with very flattering prospects of stepping
into Mr. McCoppin's shoes. .'.''.-.
The people here and at Washington who
have been worrying about this large and
ripening California plum have not been
taking the President's uncle into the
reckoning, but they will do so now.
Within a week his friends have secured
6000 signatures to the petitions they are
quietly circulating. Mr. McKinley has
kept his ambition quiet until a few days
ago, when the circulation of the petition
was b gun, and tbat operation has been
kept as quiet as it was convenient to do.
Mr. McKinley's Iriends say he is seek
ing the ottice not because be is a relative
of the President but because he has been
long in the postal service and has hart
this ambition for three or four years,
having made up his mind to seek the ap
pointment long before his nephew's name
bad been heard of in connection with the
Presidency.
Under the circumstances a popular pe
tition is naturally regarded as a wise ac
companiment to his application, and it
will doubtless be a formidable one. This
petition will be something for others who
reckon on political pulls alone to take
heed of.
Uncle Benj - mm F. McKinley is G4 years
of age, ana oas been a California)! since
1859. He was born in Ohio, and in ear!.
lile went farther fortb into the world than
did the sire of the president. He came to
San Francisco in the year mentioned, by
way of Panama, sailing in the old North
Star, which was eked on that trip. In
1882 be was honored by ins neighbors In
bedig' elected to the Assembly irom the
old Tenth district, now the Fortieth.
He entered the postal service as a clerk
the next year, and he has been a postal
clerk at $1000 a year since that iime. â¢ Dur
ing the past two years he has been the
superintendent of station F postoffice,
which is now located at Fillmore and Sac
ramento streets. Being regulated by civil
service rules he was prevented from tak
ing any active part in the last campaign,
when the family lame was so greatly at
stake.
After the inauguration of William Mc-
Kinley, Mr. McKinley, who bad not' been
East to the old home for thirty-eight
years, revisited the old place, and then in
Washington he saw the inaugural pomp
and circumstance and the greatness ot his
nephew made sure.
He is a medium-sized man with the ap
pearance of good citizenship and good
sense, a manner that is irank and pleas
ant and a face that indicates intelligence
and force of character.
"It is true tbat I am an aspirant for the
posimastersbitc, and it's nothing that I
am ashamed of," he say... "I want it to be
known, however, that I would have tried
to get tne appointment just tht* same if
mv nenhew had not become the Presi
dent. I bnd made up my mind' to it a
long time ago, and so said to come of my
friends more than two years ago. I ex
pect opposition on the score of my rela
tionship to the President, but I am mak
ing my debt purely on a busi
ness basis and not on a political or per
sonal one. I have 'been many years in
the postal service, understand its needs
and believe that 1 have the confidence of
the business community."

GERMAN SALOON MEN.

the German Saloon-keepers' Association:

years ol its existenceâ lÃ9s and 1896â aad am
to-day secretary of the California Protective

of wholesale liquor-dealers, it would seem that
my German friends must think that I am in

I am assured by Mr. John O. Hagler, president
of the German Saloon-keepers' Association,
that thai organization neither ''denounced"
me nor the Saloon Man's Journal, in which I
own an interest. I append Mr. Hauler's com

The German Saloon-keeper*' Association has
always been on friendly terms with Mr. Scott,

SOME CHINESE EVIDENCE
Wong Vow's Attempt to Enter
as a Native-Born Citi
zen.
Testimony of a White Man Flatly
Contradicting Affidavits of
Mongol i-n_.
Chinese testimony received a setback
yesterday in United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock's court in the habeas
corpus case of Wong Vow.
When Wong Vow, a young cooly, ar
rived from China a lew weeks ago he pre
sented affidavits of several Chinamen to
the effect that he was born in Redding, in
this State, and was therefore eligible to
become President of the United States
and to appoint a Collector of the Port..
Collector Wise didn't believe the affida
vits, particularly because they were con
tradictory, and ordered the free-born
American citizen to be deported to China.
A writ of habeas corpus- was secured and
the affidavit witnesses, or Chinamen an
swering to the same names, appeared be
fore Commissioner Heacock a week or so
ago and swore tbat tbey were in tbe laun
dry at Redoing on the night on which Vow
was brought into the world, and tbat it
was their delight for two years thereafter
to watch his toddling footsteps and to
bear his baby lips lisp pretty monosylla
bles expressive of his delight on being
born an American citizen.
Then, possibly in order that there might
not be a link missing in the evidence
when this wonderful man child should re
turn from. China to shoulder a white
workiugman out of a job, he was accom
panied to China by one of the witnesses,
who took up his residence about a block
away from tbe Vow family and lived there
six or more years. '"""'.'..
The trouble with the witnesses was that
they .testified not wisely but too well, and
they got themselves disbelieved. Yester
day afternoon another nail .was driven
into the coffin of their veracity, by a white
witness named W. W. Williams of Red
ding. Mr. Williams was in. business in
that town twenty years ago as a grocer
and the Wong Vow family never lived
there. In fact, there were only two laun
dries and a total population ot only thirty
Chinese there .at tbat .time, with no
women, children nor families..
Commissioner Heacock said that he had
been favorably impressed with the appear
ance and manner of the witness, a rep
utable citizen and pioneer, and that the
attorneys lor Vow would have to break it
down if they expected to keep their client
in California. .-,"*..
The hearing was continued until Satur
day, when Judge Bell and Judge Bush of
Shasta will be called as witnesses on be
half of Vow. -' .-/^T-r. *..' â¢"".â ** â *.'--./ ,'
MAY TRY
TO OUST
WEBSTER
The Board of Education
Takes an Entirely
New Tack.
SUPERINTENDENT IS IN
DANGER.
School Census Tangle Leads to
Fresh and Novel Com
plications.
AUDITOR BRODERICK TAKES A
HAND.
Will Not Sign Warrants for Census
Marshals Unless Approved
by Webster.
The bombshell that Superintendent of
Public Schools Webster exploded in the
camp of the Census Committee of the
Board of Education daring the meeting of
the committee of the whole on Wednes
day evening has borne fruit, and there
has been a wild scurry ever since to find
some way out of the difficulties pointed
out by the Superintendent.
Yesterday ere was a close conference
wiih the attorney of the board, and, as a
result, there is 8 new phase to the matter
that is fully as startling as the original
one.
On the advice of the attorney the Cen
sus Committee will contend that the law
on which Mr. Webster bases his allega
tions tbat the census, as now conducted,
is illegal, relates to county boards, and
not to those of cities; that the board is
authorized to act independently of the
Superintendent, and that Mr. Webster has
no power to interfere.
Having gone thus far, a new idea
struck the committeemen.
If Mr. Webster is not a City Superinten
dent, as has been decided by the Supreme
Court, has not the board the power to ap
point a City Superintendent to succeed
him?
The idea was a magnificent one in the
mind of the director wbo evolved it, and
the attorney was instructed to delve deep
into the statutes and ascertain whether
or not a case to oust the superintendent.
end install his successor, would have a
standing in court.
Ii now appears that the communication
of Mr. Webster to the committee of the
whole was far more pointed and bristling
with bints at illegal acts than appeared
from the inkling of the matter that
leaked through closed doors. Mr. Web
ster showed the board that those in
charge of the census work and the mar
shals themselves had ignored tbe law as
he interpreted it in many ways. His for
mal communication was as follows:
San Francisco. April 26, 1897.
To the Hon. Charles L. Barrington, President,
and Members of the Board of Education in and
for the City and County if San Franciscoâ Gent
[__â¡_____._ 1* rchpeetfully direct your attention to
the-e -facts: That appointments of census
marshals must be made by the Board of Edu
cation on or before the Ist day of April. There
is no legal provision for the board to delegate
this p.ropative and duly. Hence, if census
marsnals become incapacitated and unab.e to
serve, the Board of Kmu ation must name suc
cessors. Several persons are engaged and have
been engaged in taking the school census of
this City and Counly who have not been ap
pointed by the Board of Education.
That all appointments of census marshals
shall be subject to the approval of the Super
intendent oi Schools. That the names of only
three legally appointed census marshals have
been submitted for my approval.
' 'ihat before entering on the discharge of
their du'ies the census marshals must file
their oaths of office in the office of the Super
intendent of Schools.
No oaths of office have been filed In my
office.
That the services of Mr. Wardell and Mr.
McPherson performed prior to the 15th of
April, 1897, should be designated as clerical
service-.
I offer these statements to your considera
tion in a friendly spirit, that you may rectify
mistakes or supply those omitted formalities
of law that shall render the officers now serv
ing you as census marshals legal and thus
legalize their work.
Much credit is due Directors Gallagher and
Waller for the time and attention they have
given to the business of directing and taking
of the school census In and for this City and
County. Respectlully submitted,
R. H. WEBSTER,
Superintendent of Public bcnools.
Mr. Webster's reference to the duty of
the board to appoint all census marshals
cites the fact that a large number of men
were put to work by the Census Commit
tee alter the board had made the regular
appointments. Census Marshal Warctell
says that he put tbem on at tne orders of
the committee, and he ought to know.
These are the men appointed originally
at the open meetings of the board:
J. M. Prescott, Herman Armer, M. JCoppel,

Auditor Broderick,- after reading Super
intendent Webster's letter to the board,
said that if it was as stated by tne Super
intendent there was' a grave doubt as to
the legality of the census, ana the matter
should be thoroughly investigated.
"Mr. Webster," he said, "has here the
opportunity to make the stand that the
dignity of .his office demands. If illegal
act. such as he mentions have been com
mitted it is his duty to refuse to recog
nize the census or the warrants of those
who have taken it. If he does not sitrn
them I certainly shall not. fie has the
power to compel the Board of Education
to do this work legally, and the members
cannot force him to accept the census un
less he choose;. ......
** .VI shail look thoroughly Into the law
governing the : school census and the ap
pointment governing deputy marshals,
and if more men are at work tban the law
allows the warrants will not be audited." \

"LUCKY" BALDWIN
HAS ESCAPED
He Flees From Lillian Ash
ley to the Mines at
Randsburg.
Safety Is Assured in the Gold
Diggings of the Mojave
Desert.
A Fortune Is Awaiting the Hard-
Pressed Mil ionaire in Some of
His Southern Cairns.
Lillian Ashley, her sister Emma and
her baby will have to hunt farther for
"Lucky" E. J. Baldwin, the millionaire
hotel, horse and ranch owner. He has
gone away.
His immediate coterie of friends, at
torneys, hotel employes, stable-boys and
the creatures who are usually attaches of
men of wealth, have been saying all along
that he proposed going on a protracted
tour, and it was thereby and therefrom
intimated that his departure would be at
an early date.
Mr. Baldwin hastened matters more
rapidly even than was the recovery of the
fair Lillian, who has been in charge of the
tit. Luke's Hospital physicians since the
time she was forced to leave the Baldwin
Hotel. -â¢â¢v; ; -*:
The young woman was expected to
emerge from ber sick chamber in a day or
two, but the millionaire decided he would
not wail -until that time, believing strongly
in the old adage that "discretion is the
better part of valor."
Baldwin, however, has not cone East.
He applied quite recently to the Board of
Police Commissioners for a permit to
carry a pistol, and his request was
granted. Then, feeling individually se
cure regardless of his bodyguard, he
dodged in and out the business sections
of the City arranging hi-* affairs, and be
jumped the southbound train yesterday
afternoon for Mojuve.
The man with whom Miss Lillian Ash
lev i* so anxious, to have a quiet little
talk about the maintenance of her baby is
on his way now to Randiburg, the great
mini district in the Mojave desert.
He has some eight claims there that are
very promising. There are the "Lucky
B," the "Anita" and the "Desert Rat"
among them, most promising. As a mat
ter of fact, according to Baldwin's own
statement, they are out eight miles from
Randsburg, in the Summit district, snow
ing eight leet of $25 free milling ore.
At this time, while there is nothing
much to be -gained here, ''Lucky" Bald
win believes he can find safe and profit
able employment in the gold district of
the desert, where it would be difficult for
femininity to assert itself.
EAUEE AGAINST SHAEKEY.
Bill Collector Pitted Against V Prize-
Pl|_hter In the Superior Court, i
The suit of J. J. Raver against Prize
fighter Thomas Saarkey for $900 was on
bearing before Judge Seawell yesterday.
The action was to collect a balance al
leged to be due for W. G. Smith's services
as trainer for Sharkev before his fight
with Fiizsimnioiis, in which the decision
was accorded to Sharkey on au. alleged
foul. Smith assigned his account to Rauef
for collection.". ,'
Smith testified that he made no special
contract with Sharkey, but depended- on
the usual compensation, which was under
stood to be 10 per cent of the purse won.
In this case Sharkey was awarded $10,000.
and Smith demanded $1000. He was paid
$100.
Judge Seawell heard argument on the
law points involved in the suit, and took
the case under advisement.
