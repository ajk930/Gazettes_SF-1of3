Turkey *s Declaration of War
Promptly Accepted
by Greece*
SO THE CONFLICT GOES ON.
With Great Fury the Rival Armies Are
Hurled Forward, Resulting in a Fearful
Slaughter, but Victories for
the Greeks.
CONSTANTINOPLE, TUBKET, April
18. â Edhem Pasha, Turkish commander
in-chief in Macedonia, telegraphed the
Government to-day thatin consequence of
the Greek invasion of Turkish territory
the Turks had seized me heights of Per
ner and Velinsko. Turkish divisions
rnder command of Haid.i Pasha and Nam
Pasha have crossed into Greek territory.
Fighting continues on all sides. Turk- j
ish divisions at Dodmik, Elassona,
?Â»orapa and Karya are engaged in de
fensive operations. The Greek force
which invaded Godoman is being driven
back.
The Porte to-day communicated an of
ficial note to the newspapers announcing
that war has been declared against
Greece and giving as reasons thoie cabled
last night. The note adds that Prince
Mavrocordota, the Greek Minister to
Turkey, was handed his passports yester
day, and Assim Bey, Turkish Minister to

Ad joining the city of Prcvsa at the lower end of the peninsula on the north side are the two Turkish posts, St. Geor"ios
and another, while less than a mile away across the straits on Kephala Panagia Point stands the Greek lort Fanta and
another smaller one.
Gieece, and Turkish Consuls in that
country have been recalled. All Greek
Consuls have been invited to leave
Turkey. All Greeks have been warned to
leave the country in fifteen days.
ATHENS. Greece, April 18.â The Cham-
J>ar of Deputies was crowded by members
fnd spectators to-night. Amid the deep
est silence Prime Minister Delyannis as
cended the tribune and announced that
Turkey had notified the Greek Govern
ment of the rupture of relations between
the countries, using as a pretext the
alleged aggressive attitude of Greece.
JDclyannis enumerated the events of the
Jast few days to show the contrary was the
Case and that Turkey was the aggressor.
The Turks, he declared, bad attacked the
Greeks, attempted to occupy neutral posi
tions and sunk a Grecian steamer at the
entrance to the Gulf of Arta.
"Turkey declares war on us," said Dely-
Bnnis, "and we accept it."
This statement *as received with pro
longed cheerine by the members, the oc
cupants of the galleries enthusiastically
joining in the demonstration.
Delyannis proceeaed to read the official
dispatches confirming the hostilities on
tbe frontier. The showed that the Turks,
efter repeated attempts to force the pas
sage at Keveni in an attempt to move to
Larissa, had been repulsed.
The receipt of tne news of the Greek
victories has causod unbounded excite-
ment. The principal streets are densely
thronged with people of all classes,
eagerly discussing the slightest scrap of
information. AH sorts of rumors are in
circulation, but the majority of them re
port Greek successes.
The last two classes of reserves of 1886
have been summoned to join the colors.
Troops hitherto remaining in Athens
have been hurriedly sent to the Thessa
li&n frontier.
The news of the virtual declaration of
XT** by Turkey was received hers with
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
mingled feelings of thankfulness and mis
trust â thankfulness that the uncertain
course of events had at last assumed a
detinue now, and mistrust as to the out
come of actual conflict. Great faith ia
pinned to the wildly enthusiastic patriot
ism of the GreeK troopi, all of whom for
weeks have been clamoring for war, but
greater faith, *ith better cause, is pinned
to the navy, which has immeasurably su
perior vessels, guns, men and morals to
the TurKish fleet. The Greeks are conn
dent that with ttmr naval forces they can
capture all the Turkish outposts.
Many dispatches were received from the
frontier to-day. Some were wildly contra
dictory, but those from the most reliable
sources make it apparent that the ad
vance of the main body of the Turkish
army has been checked. Ten thousand
men under Ed hem Pasha, the Turkish
Commander-in-chief, crossed the frontier
in the direction of Larissa shortly after
the orders came from the Government to
assume the offensive. They met no oppo
sition until the command reached Reveni,
where a strong Greek force was concen
trated. The Turks attempted to continue
the advance, but were fiercely attacked.
After severe fighting the Turks were re
pulsed with a loss of six gun*. The Greeks
lost two. The number of killed on both
sides was very large. Several Greek of
ficers were killed.
Edhem Pasha was compelled to retire
into Turkish territory, where he is reor
ganizing the forces for another assault
upon Larissa.
Wnile a small Greek vessel was proceed
ing up the Gulf of Arta she was fired upon
and sunk by a Turkish battery at Preveza.
The Greek fleet, which was lying close to
the place, immediately began a bombard
ment of the town. At tbe same time the
Greek land batteries at Kefaie Panaghia
opened fire upon Preveza. Two thousand
Greek* were hurriedly aispatched across
the gulf to attack Preveza on the land
side. One of the Turkish batteries has
already been dismantled by the fire of the
Greek warships.
The bombardment was stopped at night,
but will be resumed at daylight to-mor
row. Preveza is the place where the
Turks recently started the construction of
fortification* in defiance of the provisions
of the treaty of Ber'in. The Greek naval
commander in the Gulf of Arta threatened
to fire upon the work, unless the construc
tion was stopped. This had the effect of
checking the work, but it is thoupht here
it v. as afterward continued surreptitiously,
as the fire from the Turkish batteries was
quite heavy.
LONDON, Esc, April 18.-A drspatch

ish troops at the blockhouse, which ap
parently was the objective of the Greeks.
Before dawn Edhem Pasha rode out to
take personal direction of the operation?.
A general engagement ensued, in which
20,000 troops were engaged. Tne combat
turned upon the possession of the Greek
blockhouse, which was obstinately de-
fended. Several attacks were vainly
made upon the position. At 9 o'clock the
Turks made a splendid bayonet charge,
carrying the position. The Greeks are
still defending their position at the sum
mit of the hill.
The Turks are fighting like lions. Their
artillery is doing tremendous execution.
Hafiz Pasha, one of the Turkish com
manders, was killed at Milouna Pass.
A midnight dispatch to the Daily News
from Larissa, headquarters ol the Greeks
in Thessaly, states there was fighting all
day to-dar along the whole line from
Reveni to Nezeros. The Greeks appear to
have b*en victorious at all points except
Mentxea, where the position of the Turks
is saiit to be impregnable. It is reported
in Larissa that the Turks are massing at
Milouna, where heavy fighting is expected
to-morrow.
SILENCED THE FORT.
How the Grenk Fleet Bombarded
Preveza After tho Steamer
Macedonia Was Fired Upon.
ATHENS, Greece, April 18.â The com
mander of the Greet warship Aktion tele
graphs the following details of the firing
upon the Greek vessel in tho Gulf of Arta
by the Turks at Preveza:
The steamer Macedonia was leaving the
gulf early this morning, when the bat
teries at Preveza opened fire on her. A
hole was made in the hull, but the captain
was able to run her ashore. Tne vessel
did not link as was stated in the first
reports. The captain of the Macedonia
was wounded, but the crew escaped. The
lorts opened a hot firo on the Aktion at 5 :30
o'clock this morning. They also destroyed
the Greek station garrisoned by 500, killing
several.
The Greek commander telegraphed to
Athens for instructions and received
orders to bombard Preveza. The Greek
fleet onnned fire at 11:30 a. m. The Aktion
xoon silenced the fort. The ironclad
Basileu.s Georgios and the crusier Navar
cbos Miauiis began the bombardment at
/ong range of tae Turkish position this
afternoon. The Hamidieh and Pautoka
toros batteries replied, but their eun
practice was poor. The Navarrhos Miaulis
dropped a shell into the Humidieh battery.
The ironclad Spetzai is expected to arrive
at the mill 01 Arta this evening.
The Asty reports the Greeks have occu
pied the citadel at P.-evÂ«.-zi. A great blazd
is visible from Arta in ti:e Jirec'iuu of
Voraitza. It is believed the Turks are
bombarding the latter place.
Intelligence reaches here tbat the Greek
steamer Athena, with a number of in
surgents belonging to a secret society on
board, has been sunk by a Turkish torpedo
boat in the gulf of Salonika.
Astim Bey, ?;ie Turkish Mi iister, has

but the Turks advanced until they held
the Grecian advance line, with the excep
tion of one isolated spot.
Ultimately the Greeks occupying the
outworks sent a request that the Turks
cease the shell fire, as they surrendered.
The losses on both sides were severe.
Â£ CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 18.
The German general whom the Emperor
sent to inspect the armies on the frontier
reports everything iii the Turkish army
satisfactory, except the transportation
branch. He estimates the Turkish troops
at 140.000. Many out of the 80,000 Greek
troops he considers incapable of with
standing the fatigue and exposure inci
dent; to a campaign, while their i arma
ments are inferior to those of the Ottoman
army.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.âSec
retary Sherman received a second dispatch
from Minister Terrill to-day. It is not
yet deciphered, but it is believed to con
tain a notification that Greece has asked
the Minister to use bis good offices in the
protection of Greet t-Ã¼bjocts in the Otto

night that he wanted to avoid any part in
the trouble between the two countries.
He would therefore give careful consider
ation to the request, which, however, was
common in timo of war.
The Turkish Minister received early to
day the first official news of the war. It
said the Greek troops had crossed into
Turkish territory in violation of interna
tional law and begun hostilities without
previous warning or provocation.

HAVANA, Cttba, April 18.â A letter
from Sancti Spintus says last week Gomez
passed three miles from the city on his
way from La Reforma estate, on the east
ern border of this province. His army
was composed of 3000 cavalry, 1500 in
fantry and four pieces of artillery.
Gomez said he was fully confident now
that the final triumph ot the revolution

that Gomez has scattered his forces in

estates of La Reforma and Juan Criollo.
At Santiago de Cuba the Archbishop,

relief of thousands of countrymen who
are dying from hunger on account of con

of charity, the soupliouses promoted the
cause of the Cub in army. The Arcb

was not to make war on a country by

WANTS A NAVAL
RESERVE FLEET
Secretary Long Deems
It an Economical
Necessity
Many Vessels Now In Com
mission Will Soon Be
Tied Up.
The Monterey Among Themâ Men
Are Needed for tho New
Battleships.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April IS.âSecre
tary Lone has decided upon a general plan
to organ lze a naval reserve fleet. He deems
it necessary, for economical reasons, to
put a number of ships out of commission
and lay them up in reserve. He also
stated tnat it is proposed to select some
fresh-water basin in which to keep these
vessels. It is not his intention to materi
ally deplete the squadrons in commission,
but he proposes putting out of service
several ships which experience shows are
particularly expensive to maintain and
which are not absolutely required.
The Secretary says that the ordering of
the Katahdin out of commission was a
preliminary step in executing his plan.
The Katahdin has been tested and found
satisfactory for a vessel of her typa. She
is of no value as a cruiser, and to
maintain her in commission is not thought
advisaole by the Secretary. The Katah
dsn will, therefore, be the first ship of the
reserve fleet.
The next vessel to be ordered out of
commission will be the Columbia. Shortly
after the conclusion of the Grant monu
ment exercises at New "York on the 27th
the flag of :hÂ«9 crusier will be hauled down
and she will be prepared for service with
the reserve. Next will follow the Minne
apolis. She will be directed to return to
the United States shortly after the Colum
bia goes out of commission, and upon her
arrival here will be prepared for laying
up.
According to the programme of the Sec
retary of the Navy these ships and all
others which will be added to the reserve
fleet will have constantly on board a
small crew, sufficient to keep the vessel in
good condition with respect to engines,
boilers, battery, decks, etc The crew will
virtually be care-takers. It is prooable
that two line officers and one engineer
officer will be attached to the reserve ves
sels. The ships will be kept in condition
for a call. Secretary Long's idea is that
they shall be so taken care of as to be
available for prompt service in the event
of an exigency.
Although the Secretary has not defi
nitely decided upon this point it is likely
tnat the reserve vessels will periodically
be fully manned and sent on short
cruises for the purpose of testing their
engines and trying their batteries. In all
probability two monitors on the Atlantic
coast and one en the Pacific will shortly
be placed out of commission and be added
to the reserve fleet. On the Atlantic side
the Amphitrite will first be laid up. She
has been quite thoroughly tested and Sec
retary Long is of the opinion that further
cruising on her part is not essential.
The Terror he will keep m commission
for a longer period. In time, however, it
is practically settled that she will jam the
reserve fleet The Puritan is likely to be
kept in commission. She will be em
ployed in the way of a schoclship upon
which to instruct officers ana men in
duties on board a monitor. In all likeli
hood before the summer is over the Mon
terey, on the Pacific coast, will be ordered
to the Mare Island yard and put in re
serve. The Monadnock may joia her in
the winter.
Secretary Long is now considering
which is the best station to which to order
the reserve ships on the Atlantic coast.
He is considering the facilities of New
port News, New London, League Is. and
and a site on the Hudson River. At
present he tavors the League Island sta
tion. An appropriation will be available
in July with which to do considerable
uredging at that station, which will in
crease the depth of the entrance of the
channel. The question as to the selection
of a station wil! probably be considered
by a board ol officers to be appointed by
the Secretary. Ou the Pacific there is no
question that Mare Island will be chosen.
One important point to which Secretary
Long has given attention is the question
of men. He does not intend to ask Con
gress for an increase in the enlisted force.
Therefore be says that a number of cruis
ing vessels will have to be placed out of
service to make it possible to commission
the lowa and other vessels neariug com
pletion.
WORK BEFORE THE SENATE.
Much Important Business Is Overshad
owed by the Question of Organ
izing the Committees.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 18.âSena
tor Davis will make another attempt on
Monday in executive session to get a day
fixed for taking a vote on the arbitration
treaty. It U not believed that a great
deal of time will be given to the treaty
during the week.
The bankruptcy bill will continue to
bold its place on the calendar as unfin
ished business, but probably it will not be
pressed seriously. Morgan has an
nounced his intention to insist daily upon
the consideration of his Cuban resolution
during the morning hour, but will not
block other business with it.
Much of the Senate's time will be given
to the question of the organization of
committees. The Republican Senators
will have a caucus on Monday to consider
the subject.
Consideration of the appropriation bills
will be concluded this week. It is ex
pected that the Indian bill will pass early
to-morrow, and the sundry civil and agri
cultural bills will follow in their order.
There is no expectation that there will be
any prolonged debate upon any of the
bills. There will be an effort to amend
the sundry civil bill by the addition of a
provision for the regulation of forest res
ervations. This may lead to some discus
sion, but the friends of the amendment do
not anticipate much trouble.

MAPS SHOWING THE EASTERN FRONTIER LINE AND MOUNT OLYMPUS.
It was on the sides and about the base of Olympus that most of the fighting took place Saturday and yesterday.
The village of Nezeros is at the foot of Mount Analipsis, about twenty miles north by east of Larissa. Konrtsiovall is a
small place just within the Greek side of the frontier, about eight miles north of Turnavo. The points are eaÂ«t ana west of
the main road from Larissa to Elassona, which passes through Ligaria and Kokkino Petra Pass. The continual rise of the
hills north of the plains of Larissa enables the flashes of the guns at Nereros and Kourtsiovali to be easily seen from the city.
Should the Greeks push on from Nez a ros to Kanalia and beyond they will endanger Edhem I'asha's communications with
Salonika by way of Katerina, which is itself exposed to attack by sea. "^Vith the exception of those from Larissa to Tsagesi
ou the sea, and by way of Turnavo to the frontier at Vide Melonas on Kokkino Petra Pass, both of which are paved, all the
roads north of Larissa are very poor, especially on the Turkish side of the frontier, and few of them passable for artillery ex

diplomatic relations. The Minister took
the dispatch to Secretary Sherman. The
Secretary and Minister discussed the
critical aspect of affairs.
The only likelihood of bringing this
Government into the imbroglio is pre
sented by questions relating to the right
o! asylum of Turkish and Greek subjects
in American legations and consulates. If
any case arises wnere a Turk takes refuge
in the residence of a consular officer of
the United States in Turkey the State De
partment will be given an opportunity of
declaring itself for the first time during
the present administration. Under the
Cleveland administration the right of
asylum was a very uncertain thing. The
stand of this Government was never
clearly denned.
One case during the war between China
and Japan indicated that the United
States dil not care to go very far in set
tiing a question which has always been
the cause of diplomatic controversy. Two
Japanese who claimed to be students, but
were accused by the Chinese of being
spies, took refuge in the United States
Consulate-General at Shanghai. The Chi
nese Government demanded that they be
turned over to its authorities. Jernigan,
the Consul â¢ General, appealed to the
State Department for advice, and the up
shot of the matter was the Japanese were
turned out.
They were caught by the Chinese and
put to death. The Senate adopted.a reso
lution calling for the correspondence.
This was sent in, ana after some indigna
tion had been expressed over the action
of this Government the Senators and
everybody else forgot about the matter.
The war between Turkey and Greece has
recalled the fact that this grave question
was left hanging in the air. If any natur
alized Americans of Grecian birtn who re
turned to their native land to fight gets
captured by tiie Turkish troops the Gov
ernment may also be brought into connec
tion with the war. One important consid
eration in the event of such happening is
the United States claims the right to have
one of its citizens accused of crime in Tur
key tried by the international courts.
This country has representative* among
the judges of each of these tribunals. Only
last Priday Turkey made an important
concession concerning the rights of Amer
ican citizens brought to trial before these
extra-territorial courts. A man of Turkish
birth, who had returned to Turkey after
becoming naturalize i in the United States,
was arrested on a charge of homicide.
Minister Terrell wanted him turned
over to the international tribunal. Turkey
refused on the ground the man has been
naturalized since 1869, and the Porte de
clined _to recognize the right of mixed
courts to try former Turkish subjects, who
had become alienated subsequent to that
date. Terrell kent insisting, and on Fri
day cabled that the alleged marderer had
been delivered to the international tri
bunal. This important concession may
have considerable bearing if any Greek-
Americans are captured in Turkey.
Prominent men here schooled in in
ternational law agree that the United
States will observe the strictest neutrality.
Senator Davis of Minnesota, chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
thinks the hostilities will surely involve
the rest of Europe.
The United States is well represented in
European waters, promising adequate
protection to the righis of Americans. The
cruiaer Minneapolis will remain in Turk
ish waters for t: c present. She will have
with her the smaller cruisers San Fran
cisco and Admiral Seifndge's flagsh.ps

HOME OF THE GODS.
In the Shadow of Olympus Creek
and Turk Are Now Battling:
for the Mastery.
It is in the shadow of the fabled home
of the gods that the Turk and the Greek
| now confront each other in battle array
ana on down its slopes the thunders of
war have begun to roll. Not sines the
days when the mignty Jove hurled ai the
presuming Titans his terrible thunder
i bolts and shoot O^sa piled upon Pelion
! into separate mountain masses has Oiym
-1 pus witnessed such scenes and heard such
sounds aa have now already begun to dis
turb his long repose. Whether restrained
by the fear of the wrath of the gods or
that his forbidding sides frowned upon
the maneuvers of armies, contending
leaders have sought other fields for a trial
of might.
The barbarian Xerxes profaned the sa
cred precincts by leading his mighty host
across the southeastern slope to find at
Marathon and Saiamis the price of his
temerity. It was along this very road
across "Low Olympus," through Nezeros,
where the Greeks and Turns are battling,
that he found his way down to Larissa
and co on to Athens.
The ancient Greeks bestowed the name
of Olympns upon many other mountains
both in their own country and in Asia
Minor, but this triple-peaked mass, with
its precipitous sides and cloud-veiled sum
mits, forbidding the intrusion of mortals,
was chosen beforn all as the most suitable
seat for the rulers of the heavens and tha
earth.
Olympus is, as it were, the forepost of
the Balkan peninsula. The highest sum
mit attains an elevation of 0750 feet, or
nearly as high as pointed Ossa and long
stretched Pelion together, whose heights
are respectively 5250 and 5130 feet. The
lower slopes are covered with beautiful
forest-* of oafc, chestnut, beech and plane
trees, with pine farther up, while naked
rocks complete the way to the summits,
snow-capped nine months in the year.
From the sea on the east is seen a long
array of vast precipices, cleft here and
there by ravines, whose sides are covered
with forest trees, and in whose depths
numerous torrents dash down to the sea.
It really seems to form a world apart
from the one below. Forty-two peaks
form the battlements of the upper moun
tain citadel, deterring alike the bold ban
dit and the zealous monks from attempt
ing to find lodgment there, as they have
done lower down. Fifty-two spriugs feed
the various streams that flow from its
sides to tne river Peneus, or directly to the
sea. Wildcats abound on the lower slopes
and the chamois finds security on the
rugge d pinnacles above.
Olympus, aa well as all the valley of the
Xeragi River to the west, was included
within the ancient limits of Thessaly, but
the frontier boundary line, as fixed by the
pDwers at the Berlin conference in 1878,
runs from the sea westward across its
lower slopes nearly to Elassona, and then
turns to the south along the Melonas
Mountains, across the Xeragi and up the
Ardham Mountains, leaving the sacred
mountain and a large part of Thessaly,
with its Hellenic population, to the Turk.
HACKED DOWN A CRIPPLE.
Murder Committed by an Aged Man, Who
Afterward Cut* Hit Own
Throat.
EXETER. R. L, April 18.-Joseph
Phillips, 80 years of age, assaulted Albert
F. Wilcox, a cripple, at his home yester
day wiih an ax, and then cut his throat,
as a result of which Wilcox died this
morning and Phillips is not expected to
iive through the night. The cause of the
trouble is not known. Hannah Wilcox,
a niece oi the dead man, states that there
had been apparently no differences be
tween the two. When they met Wilcox
addressed Phillips, who seized an ax,
knocking him down and inflicting three
wounds, riisi Wilcox screamed, and
Warren F. Wilcox ran to the spot. When
he saw this man approaching Phillips
drew a jackknife from his pocket and
plunged it into bis own throat on the
right side, mating a deep wound, from
which he soon fell exhausted.
THOSE VERASCQPIC PICTURES.
Manager Brady Closely Scans the Nega-
tire of the Round in Which His
Idol Is Shattered.
BOSTON. Mass , April 18.â A New York
special says: The pictures of the Corbeti-
F.tzeimmons fi^ht are ready for printing.
Some are remarkably yood, but the best
are those of the least interesting rounds.
There is one excellent picture, however,
which will cause an almost endless
amount of discussion. It is a moment in
the fourteenth round following the knock
out blow, as described by one who has
seen the negatives. It shows Corbett col
lapsing, with one knee on the floor, his
hands down, Fitzslmmons bending over
Him and bis right glove in conjunction
with the point of Corbeit's chin. This
blow may or may not have been a foul
and will be the bone of much contention.
Tnis negative is said to be one of the
clearest in the series and has been exam
ined with {;reat interest by William A.
Brady, manager for the defeated com
batant. He is said to have spent two
hours carefully examining with a high
power glass the series following the knock
out blow.
The taking of pictures began with the
camera at the extreme right of the arena.
The space in front was kc.it clear of spec
tators, as but a few favored persons pot in
among them. Stuart and his hat for seven
minutes obstructed tue field of the camera,
so that the first thousand feet of film
bear only pictures of that hat with a
penumbra of ringside incidents. The
sixth round is obscured in important parts
by a fog of smoke from the clears of the
favored few. The following rounds are
fair down to the fourteenth and last,
while the spacing of the pictures is very
uneaven. The camera which took the
final kineto^raphs did not include the snace
near the ropes, into which Corbett crawled
before he was counted out. The pictures
show him painfully crawling out of the
camera's field, and at the end his head,
arms and shoulders are out of the picture.

SOUTHERN SUPERSTITION.
Alabama Cotton- Planters Blame the Tele
phone for the Slump in Prices and
Destroy the Wires.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala., April 18.-The
superstitious feeling in this section is as
suming threatening proportions. Until
within the last few months telephone
lines have been unknown. Recently many
towns have linked themselves together.
The more ignorant element could cot un
derstand how a man in Huntsville could
speak to another a hundred miles away.
About the time the long-distance tele
phone was run out of Huntsville tne price
of cotton depreciated. Farmers, unable
to account ior the slump, blamed the tele
phone. At first it was a mere suggestion,
but later it became an actual belief along
the entire line bailt by the Georgia and
Alabama Company. On many occasions
poles have been chopped down and wires
cut by farmers in their mad belief that
they were responsible for the low price of
cotton. One line, extending from Gads
den to Walnut Grove, has been a victim
of this superstition half a dozen limes.
One farmer pulled down seven miles of
wire. The court may grant an injunc
tion, but so thoroughly aroused are the
farmers that nothing short of armed
guards will prevent the tearing down of
the entire system.
JUDGE MAGUIRE
WRITES TO BLAND
Makes a Suggestion
Concerning His Rail
road Resolution.
Agrees With the Missourian
on Every Proposition
but One.
Would Have the Matter Referred tc
the House Judiciary
Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 18.-Al
thougb ihe resolution sought to be intro
duced in the House yesterday by Bland
of Missouri hns no direct bearing on th*
Central Pacific Railroad, Judge Maeuira
said to The Call correspondent to-night
that, us it provides tor its reference to the
Pacific Railroads Committee of the House,
it was a matter of some importance to tbe
California people. Judge Maguire to
night addressed the\ following letter to
Mr. Bland:
I entirely agree with you in all that you pro
posj, except the appointment oi the Commit
tee on Pacific Kailroads to consider the matter,
and, as I uniiemand yesterday, you agree
with me tnat that course shou.d not be urged
by us at present.
The iuiorination requested in your resolu
tion should be promptly called for by the
House, and when received from the Attorney-
General shou.il be reierred not to tiie Commit
tee on Pacific Railroads, but to the Committee
on Judiciary.
What we want is not a plan for the settle
ment of the Pacific railroad debts, such as the
Commiiton Pacific Railroads might formulate
or deal with, but a legal opinion as to the ef
ticiency of existing laws lor the enforcement
o! the rights of the Government against those
companies and the suggestion of remedies' for
the defect, if any, that may be discovered in
the procedure provided for. These matters
belong, under the rules, to the Judiciary Com
mittee, and the r.dvantage of having that
committee consider them exclusively is that it
would have no jurisdiction to report any
scheme for thu refunding or other settlement
by special arrangement of the Pacific railroad
debts, as the Committee on Pacific Railroads
would be sure to do.
When the information called for in your
resolution has been returned to the House by
the Attorney-General, and not until then, in
my opinion, the proper resolution should be
introduced calling for the appointment of the
Judiciary Committee to consider the matter.
It may be impossible, in the present parlia
mentary status of the House, to secure con
sideration for such a resolution, or even for
your original resolution, but I agree with you
that it Is our duty to make the effort to secure
such legislation as may be necessary, in view
of suggested constructions adversa to the
Government, to carry out the plan and Jnst
purposes of the Thurman act, leaving the re
sponsibility for failure where it properly be
longs, upon those who are responsiDle lor the
present status of parliamentary impotence in
the House.
DELTA /S ALMOST DÂ£SÂ£ftTEO.

VICKSBL'KO, Miss, April 18.â At 6
o'clock to-night the- river is 51 feet 8
tenths, a fall of 'â > tenths in 24 hours and a
total of 6 tenths since the break in the
Biggs levee.
The situation at Madison parish is grow
ing worse. The Bicgs breaK is fast cover

dal and a greater part of the lands in the
southern portion of the parish. The water
has reached Talluiah, eighteen miles west
of D Ita. which is on the river bank.
Delta is about depopulated, only enougn
persons remaining to look after the flooded
houses.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 18.â There is
much anxinty for the safety of the levee
line from Dolta to Henderson. It is now
estimated that not Jess than BCOO persons
will need relief in this county for the next
thirty days at least. Lieutenant Crow
ley of the United States army arrived to
day to purchase rations and distribute re
lief.
John Clinton, one of the leading plant
era of Issaquena County, Miss., said to
il iv: "There is little prospect of planting
a crop this year."
Government statistics show that Issa
quena produces more cotton per acre than
any other county in tha cotton belt, but
the percentage of its acreage not covered by
water is now too insignificant to be noted.
There is little prospect of any but the
front lands north of Tallulen showing up
sufficiently to be planted be'ore June 15,
which means no crop.
JOHN JOSEPH NOURI CROWNED.
ThÂ» Learned Oriental Known Hen and at
Washington Was Not an
Impostor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 18.-A
strange-looting man came here several
years ago, introducing himself as John
Joseph Nouri, Archdeacon of Babylon.
He wore the garb of a monk, and this,
with the Oriental feature?, made him a'
conspicuous object on the streets. Among
other things, he said he had discovered
the remains of Noah's ark on Mount
Ararat. This met with a denial from the
Turkish Minister, but Rev. Dr. Eiston, a

Presbytarian clergyman, who had met the
man in San Francisco, had faith in his
claims and invited him to become his
Ruest. The local presbytery undertook to
lind out whether the man was an impos
tor, but he showed he was well versed in
the doctrines of the Greok church. An
other test imposed was a translation of
hieroglyphic tablets in the Smic sonian
Institution. He performed tne task so
weil that he proved himself to be an abls
Oriental scholar.
Feople began to think him mildly in
sane and he was persuaded to start for
Bagdad. He stopped in London, and
figured prominently in the newspapers
through an attempt to secure the protec
tion of the British Government on the
ground that he was one of her Majesty's
subjects and heir to the patriarchal throne
at Trichur, India.
A letter just received by Dr. Easton
from Rev. John H. Birrows ol Chicago,
who is traveling in India, shows that the
claims of the loneiy Oriental were true
and have been recognized. Barrows says
that John Joseph Nouri, Archdeacon of
Baylon, was crowned Patriarch at the
Chaldean Pontical Cathedral at Trichur
Malabar, and is living in splendor in a
royal palace. The coronation occurred in
February. Arch leacon Nouri's elevation
to pontifical throne makes him ruler over
Syrian Chaldeans of Trichur.

NEW YORK, K. V., April 18 A mob
of 1030 inspected Grant's new tomb
today. A solitary policeman tÂ»as wholly
unable to command decorum. Once in
side the tomb the crowd simply took pos
session without reserve, and for three
hours had everything its owu way. Men
wandered about with hats on^ smoking or
chewing tobacco and spitting indiscrim
inately. This last license was made a
reason for closing the tomb again. It was
a surprise to those in charge to find the
crowd paid such scant respect. It will
probably permanently bar the public
now.

fe^PATENTS? 3GROWTH OF SAN DIEGO.
[Prepared under the auspices of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce!
1 SAN DIEGO, Cal., April 17.â The his
tory of San Diego city and county during
the first three months of the year 1897 is
one full of such satisfactory realization
and promise of a greatly increased pros
perity during the year ahead, as com
pared with the year IS9G, that it is a
pleasure to put the facib before tne pub
lic in an unbiased and unexaggerated
manner, although in many sections of
the West during the past three months
the hard times wnich were experienced
during IS9G in the East have, as it were,
just begun to be felt, as the hard times j
seemingly roiled Westward; but here in
San Diego it beeins as if there had been
less of the feeling of uncertainty caused
by the financial troubles of the Nation
than almost any other city or county in
the Union.
The building operations thus far in 1897,
as an indication of the go-aheadatiyeness
of San Diego, are very gratifying to tne
people here, and must be very convincing
to observers interested in the doings of
the people hereabouts. The permits
issued by the Board of Public Works in
thie city from January 1 to April 1. 1897.
aggregate in value almost fIOO.OCO. In
addition to the permits already issued
there is in contemplation by one of the
capitalists of this city the erection of a
large business block covering MWxSO feet,
VIEWS IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND VICINITY.
The pictures on the corners show the progress on the dams for the $3 000,000 water system being put in by the Southern California Mountain Water Company.
Morena dam is forty-three miles east of the city. It will impound at 150 ieet height 3219 inches, or 15,226.975,170 gallons of water. The city of Ban Diego will
receive its supply from tnis source. A big force is now at work there.
Lower Otay dam is almost completed and will impound 2918 inches, or 13,706,328,500 gallons of water.
Barrett dam is located thirty-five miles east of the city, eight miles below Morena. The dam site has been located and cleaned and the foundation of the dam
made. The reservoir will impound at 175-foot contour 3304 inches, or 15,630,000,000 gallons.
Upper Otay is a storage and not a catchment reservoir, not being fed by living streams. Considerable work has been done there in placing the foundation. At 120
--foot contour the reservoir will impound 1059 inches, or 4.998,691,250 gallons.
and to be several stories hiern, adjoining
the Fisher Opera-house, in the heart of
tha city, on C slreei, between Fourth and
Fif Lh. It is proposed to make this busi
ness biock one of the most beautiful
buildings in Southern California. Im
provements to the extent of $10,000 are
being mate in the well-known Keating
block, one of the show buildings of this
city.
The San Diepo Brewery, which has a ca
pacity for 150,000 barrels of beer, was
formally opened to-day. It has, however,
been completed and in operation for a
sufficient length oi time to manufacture
very excellent beer. On ihe plaza, in the
heart of the city, President Schaeffer of
the brewery company is now erecting a
nrge business biock.
Besides the many business buildings
here reported, either iv course of erec
t on or about to be erected, there has
been a number of handsome residences
built.
In add it on to these buildinp operations
the Ban Diego Electric Railway Company
has made a number of important exten
sions to its lines into the residence sec
tions on the eastern side, and also one ex
tension udod Florence Heights, The
Citizens' Traction Company, which oper
ates the electric line running on Sixih
and Fourth streets to University Heights
and the edge of Mission Valley, is seri
ously contemplating the construction of
an incline down the side of Mission Val
ley from the present terminus of the road
and along the valey to the site of the old
Ban Diego Mission, the first mission, in
fact, of the lamous twenty-one missions
established by the Franciscans in Califor
nia, this particular ini-sion haying been
built in 1775 by the pioneer Franciscan,
Father Junipero Serra.
The decision of the United States Su
preme Court, upholding tne Wright Ir
rigation act, is already Laving good
results among the irrigation d>s
tricts in this county. In the Es
condiao district, which district, by
the way, had an irrigation system already
established and in operation before the
Supreme Court decision was made,
marked improvements in the system have
been going forward since the courts passed
on the Wright act. Many miles of irriga
tion ditches in this eystem are being care
fully cemented, which will greatly in
crease the efficiency of this establishment.
At Oceanside the public-spirited people
of that city continne to work vigorously
upon plans for the securing oi an irriga
tion system for the country round about
Ocean-ide and for thoroughly supplying
the city with water.
On April 6th the director* of the Linda
Vista Irrigation District, which district
embraces nearly 43,000 acres of the finest
lemon land in California, opened bids for
the construction of a dam at the Pamo
re-ervoir, which reservoir will, when com
pleted, furnish the valuable acres of the
district with a bountiful supply of the
precious fluid. The delinquent taxes in
this great district since the Supreme
Court decision waÂ» rendered have been
paid up with a commendable degree of
profloptaess, and tiio directors of tiie dis- ,
trict are hopeful of the speedy securing of
the comprehensive irrigation ay^teni so
necessary lor the profitable development
of these splendid acres.
The Southern California Mountain Water
Company uas continued work on the Mo
reno reservoir, which is to form a part of
a comprehensive irrigation system which
will reach tons of thousanas'o! acres and
which has aiready been described in this
correspondence.
The San Diego Flume Company is con
tinuing addi.ional operations for the bet
terment of its system all along the line.
The copious rains of the season nave tilled
its reservoirs in a very satisfactory man
ner.
The efforts on the pnrt of ranchers in
this county durine 1896 for the develop
ment <if tobacco culture, which has proven
profitable in this county, are begniuin&c to
bear fruit, and the result of last year's
work as it is now juit before the people in
the form of manufactured tobacco is
highly satisfactory, although the growers
and the manufacturers of the tobacco ad
mit their experience will enable them, it is
believed, to produce a more valuable pro
duct within another year. As yet tl.ey
find that there is a irreat deal to be learned
concerning the handling and other con
ditions that go to make an excellent to
bacco, which conditions, owing to the
climate and other features found here in
San Diego County, necessitate a differ
ence in treatment over the treatment of
tobacco leaf in other sections of the coun
try- During 1896 one rancher grew three
crops of tobacco successfully on one patch
of land of about fifteen or twenty acres in
area.
This tobacco was grown from Havana
seed, and in color and texture closely re
sembles the genuine Havana leaf. It Has
been manufactured into cigars of surpris
ingly rood quality, consideriii-.' the new
npss of the land and the experimental
methods in growing and curing the leaf.
These cigars tell readily in the local mar
ket. Pipe tobacco made from th:s leaf is
i also h> artily relished by many smokers.
Your correspondent, in discussing the to
bacco outlook of this county with an ex
pert cigar manufacturer wuo has had an
unusually long cigar experience, was told
that for bis purposes the tobacco at
present raided by San Diego growers is
worth 85 cents per pound, and can be used
successfully in the manufacture ofs-cent
cigars. This expert is thoroughly con
vinced tha'. the growers, with a year or
two additional experience in growing and
curing the leaf, can produce an article that
wrll com i are very favorably with the ex
cellent graaes of Havana tobacco, snch as
are imported from Cuba. As it is a very
easy matter to grow three crops of tobacco
on the same land here annually, the pos
sibilities of the county are far greater
than in other sections where there is only
a short single season.
T ere are now in this county 122,000
olive trees, of which 24,000 are in bearing,
and the balance will be in bearing witiiin
a very short time. One of the leading
olive growers of the county tells your cor-
I respondent that he es imates the olive oir
put from this county during the year 1897
at between 3000 and 5000 barrels. Last
year was an "off" year for olives, and thnt
S*2?f J means that the year following an
off year will produce a very bountifdl
crop. There seems to be a growing dispo
sition on the part of ranchers in this
county to engage in olive culture on a
large scale.
They note the fact that for several years
past the California olive supply nas "been
but a mere drop in the bucket in the way
of supplying tue Eastern demand for this
palatable fruit. They real.ze that Eastern
epicures have begun to appreciate that the
very ncn Mission olives of California are
far superior to any olive grown in the

take the plnce of the vast quantities of
olives now imported from the che>Â»p labor
orchards of Europe, which olives are vÂ«ry
improperly cured, and inferior in many
respects, to the olives that are easily
produced in Southern California. Ranchers
in this county are rapidly gaining a
knowledge in the matter of correctly

almost instant approbaiion from the

for olives in this county is regarded as

The United States Government has just

Theie impiacements will be completed in

The work of the National Government
in extending the jetty at the mouth of the
harbor is being prosecuted vigorously by
the Government contractors and this jetty,
which is already the best part of a mile in
length, has had a very marked effect in
deepening the ships' channel over a depth
of several feet. An experienced engineer
tells your correspondent that he thor
oughly believes that much of tne action of
the water on the Dar, caused already by
the presence of the jetty, will result in
several years' time in the deepening of the
channel between one and two feet and
possibly more. By using seaplowson the
surface of the bar this channel-deepening
process will be greatly facilitated and it
will be an easy matter to make San
Diego's harbor, which already wiil accom
modate vessels of the largest draft, the
deepest harbor entrance on Uncle Sam's
coast lines. East or West.
During most of the first quarter of this
year a fleet of between five and ten war
ships has been constantly stationed here,
including the flagship Philadelphia with
Admiral Beardslee, U. S. N., commander
of the North Pacific squadron, aboard.
The growing popularity of San Diego
Harbor as a naval resort among the of
ficers of the entire navy is a matter of
great interest and the feeline ii stronger
than ever that some day the United
States Government, appreciating the ad
vantages of this Und-locked harbor and
the advantages of San Diego's climate
during the winter, will do something
toward establishing a permanent station
here for the increasing number of ships in
the squadron.
BULLETS FIRED
INTO HIS HOUSE
Fiendish Persecution of
a Tehama County
Rancher.
Unknown Foe Shoots Through
the Doors and Windows
of His Home.
Night Attack Following a Warning
That He Must Leave the
Country.
RED BLUFF, Cal., April 18.â Word
was brought to town last night of a
cowardly attempt to murder at the resi
dence of James A. Davis, about eighteen
miles east of Ked Bluff.
A few days ago Davis found posted on
his gate and door notices to the effect that
he must leave the country or get into
trouble. He paid no attention to the
warning.
Just after dark on Friday evening a
man came to the back of the Mouse and
shot Davis 1 watchdog. After killing the
animal the miscreant fired several shots
into the rear of the building. He then
went around to the front and posted him
self behind a rock, whence he fired several
more shots, making ten in aIL Three
bullets went through the front window
and one of them just missed a woman who
was temporarily stopping at tiie Davis
residence.
After the man had stationed himself
behind the rock Davis stepped out with
his nflt and when a shot was fired he saw
the flash and commenced shooting. The
fellow jumped and ran and as he crossed
an opening Davis fired three more shots
t him, but it was too dark to tell whether
any of them took effect. Probably tney
did not, as there were no traces of blood.
No clew has yet been found to lead to
arrests.

WITH COWARDICE
Stanford's Men Bitter
Over the Field Day
Dispute.
Declare That They Have Been
Robbed of a Certain
Victory.
The Intercollegiate Controversy as
Viewed From a Palo Alto
Standpoint.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
18. â The news that the intercollegiate
nekl-day between the University of Cali
lornia and Stanford had been declared
off, owing to tii a inability of the mana
gers and the faculty committees of the
two universities to reacu Â»n agreement,
was received with great regret in athletic
circles at Stanfordâ not that the senti
ment here is opposed to the stand taken
by Manager Brown, but because the re
fusal of the Berkeley management to agree
to his position is regarded as virtually
robbing Stanford of a brilliant athletic
victory.
The cardinal Athletes have worked
harder than ever before, and were last
apDroaching a form which would have
undoubtedly established Stanford's su
premacy on the track. Brunton, Morgan,
Dole, Burnette, Fickert and Hazzard are
in the pink of condition, ana could have
been expeofed to surpass previous inter
collegiate records in almost every event
entered. The refusal of the Berksley man
agement, coming at this time, is taken as
an acknowledgment of (Stanford's su
premacy.
The fact that the University of Califor
nia management did not make its de
mands until such a short time before the
field day, when the nature of both teams
was well known, is regarded as conclusive
evidence that Berkeley realized that Stan
ford had a greater number of men able to
win first places and that in order to win
Berkeley would have to rely upon second
places in a large degree. By counting
second places three points instead of two,
as formerly, they would raise their
chances of winning the field day propor
tionately.
Furthermore, the time when amend*
ments to the athletic agreement between
the two colleges is regularly made is in
February, when committees from the
athletes of each college meet to consider
amendments, which each college has a
right to propose. Unless amendments
are suggested to this committee the pre
vious agreement i 9 supposed to stand un
altered. The University of California
committee made no proposal last Febru
ary to change the method of counting five
for firsts, two for seconds and one for
thirds, which has prevailed for the last
two years ana was so fixed at Berkeley's
request. To change the scale of points
whenever Berkeley felt her chances would
be improved by a readjustment would be
unjust and unsportsmanlike. Berkeley
did not object to the scale of five, two and
one last year, and Stanford now asks,
"Why this year?"
Manager Brown has the entire support
of the student body back of him. The
view of the controversy from the Stanford
standpoint is well expressed by George
Bliss Culver in the Sequoia.
Last week Dave Brown received a letter
from Theodore Barnes, the U. C. track mana
ger. The letter informed Dave that the U. C.
executive committee of athletic affairs had
met and decided that the points for the inter
collegiate meet should be 5 for first, 3 for sec
ond and 1 for third places. Heretofore the
points have been 5, 2 and 1. We see no rea
son for changing; them, nor aid Dare fancy
the idea of being dictated to. It takes a good
deal to stir up Dave, but there are limits to
patience, and when he telegraphed back to
Barnes the message was something like this:
Wlli yon accept tbe management of the Stanford
track team? Keply at once. D. K. Bbown.
The proposition made by Berkeley at the
eleventh hour, to change the long existing
method or scoring, is absurd and nonsensical.
Our manager has the backing of every one in
the stand he has iaken, and we are in a posi
tion to stand by him.
For years we have conceded everything to
U. C. We have competed against ail sorts of
men, from ball players who had not any pre
tense of being college men, aown to Art School
athletes and men from the various affiliated
colleges. But events have so shaped them
selves that we are now ready to stand for what
we know to be rignt.
TACOMA GIRLS' ADVENTURE.
Reported Attack by an Octopus Upon Two
Young We mm on Puget
Sound.
TACOMA, Wash., April 18.â Katie Her
bruck and Lillian McKeehan while in a
boat collecting sea urchins and star fishes
in Puget Sound yesterday were attacked
by a monster devil fish measuring over
twelve ieet between the ends of opposite
arms.
Their first warning of the presence of
he octopns came when it thrust an arm
into the boat, catching Miss Herbruck by
the foot. She screamed and pulled, finally
escaping by dexterously slipping off her
shoe.
Then began a battle royal. The octopus
whipped the sound until foam covered its
surface, endeavoring all the while to
fasten i i b tentacles about the boat's occu
pants. The youns women responded by
vigorously poundins; the fish with the
ours and a fis-hhook.
Finally the octopus twisted an arm
about the cross piece in the Doat's bow
and headed for the sea. The girls suc
ceeded in catting off the tentacle after be
ing towed for some distance. Another
stroke killed the monster, which was then
dragged into the boat. It weighed 110
pounds and had eight arms.
MiSS BUCHANAN
WIELDS A WHIP
James P. Treadwell of
San Jose Attacked by
His Nemesis.
Cowhide Plied Vigorously on
One of the City's Main
Thoroughfares.
The Young Millionaire Wards Off
the Blows and Is but Slightly
Punished.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. April 18.â JamÂ«3 P.
Treauweil, one of the heirs of the TreaJ
well millions, was horsewhipped on First
street about 11 o'clock last night by Louise
Buchanan, a young woman with whom he
nus bad considerable trouble.
Miss Buchanan waÃ a member of the
Bloomer Minstrels, which played here
last week. 6he left the troupe at Salinas
a few days ago and returned to this city.
Last evening she and a Miss Sinclair, also
an ex-Bloomerite, started out with the in
tention of horsewhipping Treadwell. They
met their victim on First street, near Santa
Clara avenue, and Miss Buchanan struck
Treadwell five timos with a small cowhide
she carried.
Treadweli partially warded off the
biows with his cane and received but
slight punishment. He threatened to call
an officer and the women desisted. They
went across the street and stood around
for a half hour, apparently waiting for
another chance to assail young Tread
well.
Louise Buchanan first came to San Jose
from San Francisco several years ago and
made her home with the family of Abe
Golden, the proprietor of a candy-store.
She became acquainted with young Tread
well and the two went together a great
deal. Finally she accused him of causing
her downfall under promise of marriage.
The affair was hushed up and Miss
Buchanan went to San Francisco to live.
When Tread well's alleged marriage to a
young widow of San Francisco was re
ported a few months ago, Miss Buchanan
returned to San Jose with the avowed in
tention of "doing him up." One evening
she sent word to Tread well that she wanted
to see him in a room in the rear of the
Louvre saloon. "When be appeared the
Buchanan woman and a male escort at
tempted to administer a beating. He
fought them off and in the mele the girl
received a black eye. She had Treadweil
arrested for battery, but before the trial
came on she uaid thÂ« costs and had the
case dismissed.

GRASS VALLEY SHOOTING.
Citizen Wounded While Trying to Prevent
a Killing During a Street
Fight.
GRASS VALLEY, Cal., April 18.â John
Low was wound-.'d by a bullet in tne arm
last midnight while trying to save the life
of one of the principals in a street affray.
The shot was fired by Thomas Trenberth,
and the intended victim was James
Rodda, but instead of striking Rodda tha
bullet hit Low, who sought to prevent
Trenberth from using the pistol.
A prize-fight was to take place at the
Athletic Club last nijrht between John
Trenberth, a son of Thomas Trenberth,
and Charles Davey. The former had bested
the latter in a previous con eat, and, it
appears, was anxious tor another battle.
but for aome reason the fight was declared
off yesterday. Rodda had been training
Davey for iwo weeks past, and was eager
to have the contest take place. Rodda
met Trenberth Sr. last night and they
qu.irreled. Rodda remarked:
"Davey can wh p your boy, and I can
whip you."
Trenberth claims that Rodda attempted
to strike him, whereupon he shot at
Rodda, but wounded John Low. Tren
berth was arrested, and is now out on
bail.

It will not be safe to bet on the tight

If the financial editor of the New York

It certainly deserves a State wide support.
The ground on which was fought the

irome British papers are quite vociferous
in declaring a willingness to fight Presi

On July 4, ISII, the Pennsylvania Soci

If the Macedonians, Bulgarians and
Servians decide to take a part in the fight

war to the end of the century.
The fight between Greece and Turkey
will be interesting, but all the same pub
lic attention will be directed less to it than
to the big powers that are watching it. A

While some people in New York mourn

Benator Mason's joint resolution provid

If all reports are true of the amounts of
money Americans are paying for the lease
of windows overlooking the route ot the
Queen's jubilee procession, it would seem
that her Majesty's parade will just make an

There is a belief prevalent that the peo

By way of refuting the fljpincy with
which the papers of New Yoik and Chi

calls attention to the fact that Philadel

put together, and, moreover, is the only
city In the Union which maintains a

these attainments do not lift Philadelphia
above the rank of a village, what do New

CONSTANTINOPLE.
The war between Greece and Turkey,
and the extreme caution of the opposing
statesmen of the nations of Europe on the

broken and the policy of the integrity of

nations, jealous of each other, prefer that
a sick man should occupy tho dominant
situation, no matter what wickedness his
weakness does or allows, rather than risk
the passing of such an advantage to a
rival.
Some of the speakers and writers, even
of the Liberal party, in England have
freely confessed this In recent utterances.
There is a certain sense, in which even
the Liberals believe, in the preservation
of the Turk's empire. They seem actu
ated by mixed motives, and half condemn
and half commend the Premier; and by
their flat refusal to accept the challenge
thrown down to them to carry a vote of
censure against the policy of those en
trusted with the Government they prove
a vacillation betweeu desire and dread,
which would most likely make them hesi
tate if the great responsibilities were sud
denly thrust upon them.
The wish to prevent Russia from be
striding the narrow world like a colossus
evidently outweighs their repugnance to
the Moslem's tyrant rule over Christians
in Crete and Armenia. The great prob
lem of Constantinople's lntnre makes an
interesting subject of speculation, and it
has thus engaged the attention of the
worid for generations.
The time for speculating on the prob
lem i*, however, rapidly passing away,
even i! it be not already past. The pres
ent war brings all the factors of that prob
lem into the arena of the urgent issues of
the day. It seem.i aa if the solution can
not be much lonner postDoned, notwith
standing the fact that as Constantinople
and the dominion over a -'arge part of the
world are mighty stakes to play for.it is
not to be wondered that the powers hesi

spoils.
A TRENCH EXPERIMENT.
In an article reviewing the development
of the use of wator power in generating
electricity for transmission to distant
points the Boston Herald gives California
credit for having led the way in demon
strating the possibility of achieving prac
tical results in such enterprises. We have
not, however, kept pace witti other parts
ot the world in work of this kind and we
must now look elsewhere for the must im
portant and impressive results.
The great works established at Niagara
have eclipsed all that has been done in
California, and have been the real stimu
lus to similar enterprises elsewhere. Tnat
plant is built on sucti an immense scale
that it excites the imagination and
prompts men of capital and engineers of
skill to imitate the feat, and therefore has
Had a wide influence not only in America
but throughout the civilized world.
One of the most notable results of the
study of the Niagara experiment is re
ported from France, where the military
and civil authorities at Briancon have
combined to get light, heat and motive
power out of a small waterfall at some
distance from the town.
Briancon is the center of a mountain
ous country and is extremely difficult of
access. Fuel costs a great deal because of
the difficulty of transportation, and even
oil for lighting purposes costs so much
that it imposes a heavy tax upon the
authorities and the inhabitants. It wa<
therefore of prime importance to the com
munity to devise some means of obtain
ing cheaper power for lights, heating and
energy, and the Niagara experiment
turned their attention to the waterfalls in
the mountains as a possible soured of
supply for these requirements.
Under the direction of the War Depart
ment of France an electric plant was es
tablished at a point where it could be fed
by power derived from a waterfall, and
from this plant there has been derived an
energy not only sufficient to furnish the
city with lights, but also to run cars for
the transportation of freight. Aerial ca
bles have been erected between the cen
tral storehouses and deÂ»ched forts
perched at considerable altitudes among
the surrounding mountains, and these
posts are now supplied wltii munitions
and all other requirements at a cost com
paratively slight when contrasted with the
expenditures which were formeriy neces
sary.
The experiment, according to reports,
has been successful in every way. It has
furnished the community with lisht, fuel,
cheap transportation, euergy sufficient for
considerable manufactures and has sap
plied the War Department with a prompt
means of maintaining its garrisons in the
mountains. It therefore embodies a good
object lesson for us. Since California led
the way in matters of this kind it would
soem that we rr.iÂ«ht profitably follow the
procession which we started and once
more take a position in the front rank.
AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION.
It is altogether likely that the most
notable event of the sixtieth year that
Victoria has reigned over the British em
pire will be the accomplishment of the
federation of the Australian colonies.
The creation of a united Australia, which
has been under consideration for a long
time, is now in a fair way to be attained,
and there are prospects that it will be re
alized during the coming summer.
The convention to which was com
mitted the task of formulating a plan of
union and drawing up a constitution for
the new federation has completed its
work in a manner that seems to be fairly
satisfactory to the people of all tne coio
uies. The work performed by them has
been submitted to the Parliaments of the
various colonial, not for amendment or
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 19, 1897.
ratification, but simply for discussion and
criticism. When this is over the conven
tion will meet again and revise the work
in the light of the criticism pronounced
upon it in the various Parliaments and
the constitution will then be submitted to
tha people.
It vai the desire of the promoters of
Australian federation to include Tas
mania and New Zealand as well as the
colonies of Australia itself. It is doubt
ful, however, whether New Zealand will
consent to join ths union. She is 1200
miles distant from Australia and her
people naturally ieel that there would be
a disadvantage to them in having a seat
of government so fnr removed. With the
exception of New Zealand, however, all
the other colonies are inclined to the plan.
The constitution as proposed bears a
close resemblance to the form of govern
ment adopted for the federation of the
Canadian provinces, and is not widely
different from that of the United States.
Tie various colonies now existine are to
remain entirely autonomous in local af
fairs. Customs and excise and army and
navy are to be under Federal control.
Tnere is to be a Federal Parliament, con
sisting of a Senate aud a House of Repre
sentatives, together with a GoVernor-Gen
eral appointed by the crown and a Fed
eral Supreme Court.
The new constitution will go into effect
if adopted by three of the seven colonies.
It will be binding, however, only upon
those that adopt it, leaving the others free
to continue their separate government un
til such time as they see the advantage of
entering the union.
There can be no question that federa
tion will strengthen the prestige of the
Australian people by binding them to
gether at one nation, but what effect it
will have upon tnÂ« relation of Australia
to the British empire cannot be foreseen.
It may awaken a national spirit which
will prompt them to establish complete
independence, or it may serve to confirm
their loyalty to the crown and etrengthea
their pride in being a part of the world
wide empire over which ihe Queen rules.
In any casÂ«, the successful accomplish
ment of the union of the colonies will be
a political event of the first importance in
the world's history and the starting point
for a new era of development in that part
of the globe.

NEWS OF FORE.G,\ NAVIES
Great Britain has ninety-eight first-class
torpedo-boats iv commission.
Chatham dockyard expended $2,400,000 in
wages during the past fiscal year. For the en
suing year the wages account has been re
duced about $200,000.
The German naval budget for 1897-98 pro
vided for $45,720,750 and comprised an addl
tion of forty-six vessels to the navy, namely
five sea-going armor-clads, two monitors, two
harbor-defense batteries, ten cruisers, five dis
pstch boats and twenty-two torpedo boats.
The Reichstag, however, did not receive the
Emperor's plan favorably and the appropria

year's allowance very slightly.
The Blake, British cruiser of 9000 tons, had
a four hours' steam trial on March 25, auriag
which she averaged 14,50<J horsepower and
19.2 knots' speed by log. immediately there
after the ship entered on her twenty hours'
trial on three-fiftns of her natural draught
power and gave an average of 8445 horse
power and lO.iJft knots' speed. The Blake wns
built In 18S9, and on her trial trip in 1891
failed to make the intended speed of 22 kuois
on 20,000 horsepower. The power reached
only 14,450 under natural draught, the speed
19 112 knots, and has not been improved upon
until now after her recent refit.
The Japanese battle-ship Fuji, 12,230 tons,
bu lit at the Thames Iron Works, London, con
eluded her trials March 23. On tne first day
the ship made four runs over a 10-knot course
in the vicinity of the Downs, and on 150
pounds of steam developed 10,200 horse
power, witn 108.5 revolutions and a speed of
16.8 knots. On the following day the Fuji
made her lull-power forced-draught trials, and
on six runs over the 10-knot course averaged
18.5 knots' speed on 14,100 horsepower, 152
pounds of steam and 120 revolutions. The
lowa, battle-ship, United States navy, which
had her trial on April 7, is 11,410 torn, ran
twice over a course of 33 miles and averaged
17 knots, which is one knot faster than her
estimated epeed. The Fuji made exactly her
contract speed.
Detailed accounts of the gun accident on the
Cissoi Veliki, Russian batt!e-Â»h:p, while at
target practice near Cauea on March 14, show
the frightful results attending accidents to
modern guns. It was In the after turret that
the catastrophe occurred to one of the 12-inch
Canet guns served with acharge of 200 pounds
of powder. The breech screw had not been
screwed up, and as a result the breech block,
weighing about 3000 pounds, blew out and
was driven four inches into the turret, while
the covering of the turret was split in two, one
haf eoing up as high as the maintop, and in
its fall crushing the lorward bridge, killing
seventeen men. Of the ten people in the tur
ret when the accident occurred four were
killed outright and more have died since.
Altogether thirty-three officers and men were
killed and wounded.
The navy of Turkey, quite formidable on
paper, Is to all appearances even worse than
that of China, for in Us preparations for war
with Greece only a few of the most antiquated
snips have been placed in commission, and
the ships recently built in England are
with few exceptions evidently in no fighting
condition. Turkey's navy list embraces
eighteen ironclads ranging from, thirty-three
to twelve years old and therefore anti-juated,
elgnteen cruisen thirty-eight to five years
old, twenty-seven dispatch vessels and yachts,
eleven gauboata and thirty-eight torpedo
boats. Ihe fleet which left the Bosporus on
March 25 for the Aegean Sea consisted of four
battle-ships of ancient build, one armored gun
boat of 400 tons, built In 1875. two transports,
one torpedo gunboat built in 1890, two other
nondescript craft and four first-class torpedo
boats of 85 tons. The small fleet of Greece
consists of serviceable vessels and makes up
in quality lor wnai they mar lack in size and
number.

sent on account of illness, William I wrote to
him us follows:
Your absence on the oocaslon of the ceremonies

of Dresaen, uttered these bold and bitter
words:
"Bismarck Is still to-day the object of many

NOTES OF THE
NATIONAL GUARD
Major-General James Now
Favors Regimental
Camps.
The Numerical Strength of the
National Guard oi the State
of California.
Inspections Have Been Ord redâSome
thing Some of the Retired Officers
Do Net Know.
The probabilities are that there will not be
any opposition to regimental camps this year
and tiiat the request for such will be granted.
Major-General James, wno previous to tho ap
propriation for camps had beeu made by the
Legislature l.ad declared himself In favor of a
division camp, has recently changed hi* views
on the subject and is now favorable to regi
mental camps, yet sti.l holding that at some
future time a division camp would prove of
great benefit to the guard.
The announcement in this department that
Colonel H. P. Bush (retired) had been named
as Judge-advocate on the division staff, vice
James F. Smith, elected colouel ol tha First
Regiment, Second Brigade, created quite an
excitement among the members of the staff.
There is antagonism to the colonel by reason
of matters in the First Regiment Infantiy
under the old organization, and it has been
carried into the new io tne extent thai should
the nomination of Colonel Bush be confirmed
there will be a number of vacancies on the
division staff, not thai those who would re
sign have any objection to the nominee as a
man, but they are opposed to him for military
reasons.
There is, however, a probability that the
colonel will not accept the position for the
reaion that if he did it would, while he held
the position, reduce him from the rank of
colonel to lieutenant-coioneU A section of the
code regulating the National Guard gays: "A
retired officer when placed on duty will wear
the uniiorm of the organiz ition to which he is
assigned in accordance with the position ami
rank he may hold therein. When not placed
on duty he may on proper occasions wear the
uniiorm of the organization in which he was
retired." Another section says that when an
officer on the retired list is detailed for active
duty he shall be entitled to the rank vhicu
belongs to the ofiico the duties of which he is
detailed to periorm.
Tiiere are several of the prominent officers in
the guard appointed from the retired list who
evidently are not aware of the existence of
these sectioiiÂ» of the code from the fact, that
they wear the insignia they were entitled to at
the lime of reilre meat, but which they are not
entitled to wear under the appointments they
now hold. A glance at the shoulder-straps by
some ore high in authority might result In a
change in tnÂ« insignia now worn by these offi
cers.
Lieutenant-Colonel William Edwards (re
tired) has been earned ordnance officer on the
staff oi Major-Geutral James with the rank of
lieutenant-colonel. The nominee hus ac
cepted, and he will fill the vacancy caused by
tho death of Lieutenant-Colouei J. H. Mangels,
which occurred on tho 24tn ot last January.
Tho new appointee wa-> captain and aid-de
camp to the commander of the Second Brigade
in 1888; in April, 1889, ho was major and
quartermaster of the Second Brigade, and on
August 29, the same year, he wns commis
sioned iieutenaut-colonei and assistant adju
tant-general Second Brigade, and he was re
tirea May 24, 1895.
Lieuteuant-Coionel George R. Burdict, quar
termaster on the division staff, has on act. unt
ol press ot business which prevents him from
devoting the necessary time to the dunes of
the office, asked to be relieved from duty.
Lieutenant-Colonel Philip L. Bush, uid-de
camo on the Governor's stall", a son of Colonel
H. P. Bush (retired), has been granted a cer
tificate of exemption, having served seven
years continuously in the National Guaid.
He is the youngest officer who has received
such a certiflca c, being but 21 years of age.
In February, 1890, ue was a member of the
Cadet Company, First Infantry, Second Bri
gade. In 1892 he was transferred to Com
fiany H, was promoted corporal-sergeant, and
d July, 1895, was battalion sergeant. He
afterward became corporal, sergeant, second
lieutenant and captain of University of Cali
fornia Cadcta, aud on the 2-d of February of
last year he was commissioned aid-de-camp
on Governor Budd's staff with the rank of
lieutenant-colonel.

The officers of the First Regiment Infantry

The officers of the Fifth Regiment Infantry,
at the me<Mine lust Tuesday, decided lo hold a
regimpntnl camp, and a request lor such has
been forwarded to headquarters, caking that
the time be fixed from July 17 to No
place has yet been selected ior the camp, but
as soon as permission to hold the same is
granted, Colonel Fairbanks, commanding the
regimen', will issue orders to secure a suitable
site and make arrangements for transporta
tion, after which the commissary will provide
the needful.
The lightning rapidity with which business
is transacted in tbe office oi tho adjutant-gen
eral is apparent from the following taken from
General Order No. 3. is>ued 'nst Thursday :
"Signal Corpsâ Charles L. Hewes to bo first
lieutennnt. stenal Corps, with rank from Feb
ruary 15, 1897, vice Perkins, promoted."

tenant, who were under the Impression that
two months ago the National Guard had been
apprised of Hewes' promotion, but they were
mistaken, for a promotion is not known until
officially proclaimed, and from the paragraph
quoted it seems that it takes two months to
make such a fact known.
The Third Brigade. I
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April Company G /
has decided that it will not go to San Fran-'
cisco in May, as has been proposed. As a com
pany it is In favor of going into regimental
camp, instead of a brigade camp, as has been
rumored, will be the case this year. Their
reasons for wishing a regimental camp are
various, one of the most important being that
the movements are ponderous and require too
much unnecessary inarching when drilling.
The members of the company are great
stickers for actual military duty in camp and
are anxious to encourage a general discussion
of this matter with a view of arriving at the
sentiment of the guard at Inrge.
First Sergeant William Kello?g has decided
to give up the military and lias made applica
tion for his discharge and exemption, having
been a member tor ten years. Ihe company
will feel his loss greatly and pressure is being
brought to bear to persuade him to remitiu
another three years, as the company feels that
It can ill afford to lose him. *â >Â£?*<
A team shoot was held last Sunday between
two sections of the company composed ot
fifteen men each, under the leadership of
Sergeants de Finnes and Guth, the men of the
latter being the winners by a small majority.
A heavy wind was blowing and the scores
were not what they would have been under
different circumstances. The losing team wan
to have paid the expenses of a "smoker," but
ii has been decided to turn the cost of the
"smoker" over to the committee on entertain
ment and ii will go toward paying the ex
penses of a ladies' night, which will take place
some time in May. It will be a social affair
and strictly invitation, to consist of a literary
progrnmme, a series of whist games, dancing
and an exhibition drill. The team scores
were as follows:

Easter Impressively Observed With Sermons
and Music Mid a Wealth of
Flowers*
THE Easter services at the churchos
yesterday were unusually impres
sive, and it is doubtful if any pre
vious Easter has been the occasion
of so much magnificent music as was ren
dered by the various choirs. The decora
tions were everywhere superb, and with
such accessories the ministers could not
well have been other than at their best.
Archbishop Riordan Blesses
The Cathedral Congregation
THE great auditorium of St. Mary's
Cathedral was entirely inadequate
to accommodate the great throngs
that desired to attend the Easter
services. Solemn pontifical mass was
celebrated in the morning by Archbishop
Riordan, assisted by Very Rev. Father
Preodergast. 'The deacons of honor were
Rev. Fathers Bowen, Dompsey and Byrne.
Father Ramm was tub-deacon and Father
Mulligan acted as master of ceremonies.
At the conclusion of the mass Rev.
Jerome B. Hanniean delivered the Easter
sermon. Father Hanuigan spoke of ;he
resurrection as proving the truth of the
revelation in Cnrist. The divine preserv
ing power, he said, mast of necessity be
1 infallible, and a divine preserver must be
as truly infallible as an originally divine
teacher.
At the conclusion of the sermon the
Rixht Reverend Archbishop delivered the
i papal benediction.
A feature of the fine musical programme
rendered was a vocal offertory by Cor
; nelms O'Suihvaa.

True Meaning
of Immortality.
LIFE Everlasting as Christ Defined
It " was the subject of Rev. William
Kader's morning sermon yesterday
at the Third Congregational. H e
said: "The power of Christ's resurrection
is moro than future existence. Christ did
not bring continued life to light. Men be
lieved that before he came. Jesus denned
immortality as everlasting life plus the re
generation of the individual. He pui pur
pose into existence, and interpreted im
mortality as a present reality rather than
a fui ure hope.
"Easter is a prophecy of the final trans
formation of tne world. The flowers and
grass and beauty of nature symbolize the
time when there shall be no more death.
The power of this spiritual resurrection
transforms duty. Men are greater for be
lieving in the immortality of the soul.
This faith strengthens character, trans
figures duty, and we endure as seeing the
invisible. The theoloey of Easter makes
death not u:i end in itself, but a develop
ment and transition. Life and immor
tality are related as the flower is to the
bud, the man to the youth, the wide sea
to the river. Death is the opening of the
bud, the maturing of the youth, the mouth
of the river.
"To know the power of Christ's resur
rection is to realize the life ol God In the
soul. It is not a dogma, but an experi
ence, 'that like as Christ was raided no
from the dead by the elory of the Father,
even so we aiso should wake in newness of
life.' Easter means nothing if it does not
mean the gospel of the new life. Future
existence is a blank without the redeemed
character."
Baptism a Proof
of the Resurrection.
AT the West Side Christian Church
the sermon at 11 a. m. was on "The
Resurrection of Christ." At Bp. m.
tno pastor, Rev. W. A. Gardner,
spoke on "Baptism, a Proof the Resurrec
tion." He said:
"The resurrection of Christ is a fund
memai fact in Christianity, and the aeity
of Christ is its most important truth.
"If it be established as a fact that Jesus
arose from the grave after he had been
three days dead, ti.en the truth that he is
divine, as hi* Father, ii established be
yond controversy.

In regard to the war in the Philippines
the general impression among the passen
gers was that the Spaniards were getiiru
the worst of it, in spite of all telegrams to
the contrary. Said a Shanghai merchant
who came over on the steamer yesterday :
"Reliable information in regard to the
operation of tiie- Spanish troops iv the
I'iiilippines is hard to obtain. TuÂ»re is a
superabundance of highly colored reports
appearing iv the Spanish press, but the
information received from our agents is
very different. The Spanish troops are
meeting with a stubborn resistahce in
Cavite, and it will be months r>eforÂ« the
province is cleared of rebels. The latter
continue to attack all convoys with ammu
nition and atores for the front, and the
movement of the Royali&ts are in con
sequence ereativ hampered. The Captain-
Genersl, I learn, has applied to the
Spanish Government for 8000 additional
troops, as those operating in the province
oi Cavite are suffering severely irom
'Executions are of frequent occurrence
in Manila, and from our last advices there
were eighty untried prisoners in the jails
awaitinir punishment. L:Â«rge numbers of
the native troops are goin^ over to the
rebels, and judging from the last reports
received over the underground wire, the
rebels have received large supplies of' fire
arms."
From the above it looks as if Spain
! were meeting with no better success in
the Philippines than is attending her
j arms in Cuba.

"The Immortality of

REV. EDWIN H. JENKS preached

minster Presbyterian Church on Fell
street, between Octavia and Lnguna
streets. This church is without a pastor,
but is expecting a man from the East to
supply tho pulpit when they move into
their new church.
Mr. Jenka' theme was tbe "Immortality
of the Affections." "Christ, by his resur
rection," he said, "had brought life and
immortality to light and told as some
thing of what the state ol the believers
was to be hereafter. The affections we
know endure to the very end of this life,
Christ told us, and showed us that they
survive death. His heaven U our heaven.
His friends are to be with him there, and
so we know we shall be with each other.
He came buck from the tomb to those be
lovid and assured them of his continuous
presence with them forever."
The church wa9 tastefully decorated,
and a wvll-trained choir sang a special
Easter service.
Double Meaning
of Resurrection.
AT WASHINGTON HALL yesterday
the Rev. J. S. David preached on the
"Kesurrection of the Laid," taking
the position that it was a progres
sive wort. He said: '"The resurrection of
the Lord's body from the grave was but
the outermost manifestation of bis real
resurrection. LooKing at it inwardly his
resurrection was a life-long work, an evo
lutionary process. In the Lord's incarna
tion the divine Logos was densely en
shrouded with matter and gross environ
ments and h rciitary tendencies. By de
grees he overcame these and rose above
them, bringing his human nature more
and more into harmony with his divine
nature, every step of which was a resur
rection process.
"In his visible resurrection he emerged
out of the last remains of earthly condi
tions. Henceforth his humanity was psr
fecily one with his liivinity. and he was
God-Man. He is thus a connecting lins
Letween earth and heaven, between men
and God. A similar process occurs in
every regenerating soul. The Cnrist, the
word, is conceived and born within; in

Basin.

Class Showed Cbampioa
ship Form.
The Old-Timers nni Ex-Champions
Put Up a G eat Race in
F.st Time.
The opening meeting of the Ariel Row
ing Club was a great success. All the
events were well-contested and the club's
guests thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon's
sport. Long Bridge was crowded with
spectators and the Soutn F.nU and Dolphin
clubs were well represented.
All classes nf sailing craft in the bay
were there, and in some instances the
contestants were seriously interfered with.
In the race for junior skiffs, Carroll had a
commanding lead, but might have lost
the race had he been close-pressed, be
cause a rowboat got in his way. As it
was, he won by at least ten lengths in the
fair time of 11 minutes 5 seconds.
All the races were rowed over the usual
mile and a half course, from Long Bridge
to the Union Iron Works and back. The
turn was an awkward one and many of
the amateurs found great difficulty in
negotiating it. The officers in charge of
the ai'fair were: J. R. Bockman, presi
dent of the club; J. P. Enriglir, starter;
Walter Bleke, timekeeper, and J. R.
Nolan and Charles McAuliff -, judges.
Just before the first race was started the
Dolphins came up in force and made a
very pretty picture as their barges ranged
up alongside the starter's boat. The first
event was for junior amateurs in skiffs,
and the course, as before stated, was one
mile and a naif. Andrew Carroll made a
runaway race of it, and would have "won
by a block" had he not been interfered
with. As it was he got home first by ten
lengths in the fair time of 11 minutes and
5 seconds. C. McA.uliffe Jr. was sccjnd
and H. Pless third. It waa a very pretty
finish for second honors between the two
men, but Carroll outlasted his opponent.
The second race was tbÂ« senior skiffs.
The on v entries were W. McCausland
and R. Ellis. For the first mile it whs nip
and took. Then MeCausiana's form be^an
to show and the race was at hi? mercy.
He won as he pl-ased in the smart time of
f) minutes and 22 seconds, while Ellis was
8 seconds behind him. McCausland's time
was far and away the best made during
the day, the nearest approach to it beinij
the 10 minutes and 5 seconds of the senior
barce crew and 10 minutes 8 seconds of
tb- ex-champions.
The third race wa9 that of tha junior
barges, and the winner* covered the mile
and a half course in 10:33. The crew was
composed of Andrew Carroll, Albert Car
roll, George McGinnis, Frank Wilson and
William Manjjan coxswain. They had a
commanding lead 20J yards from home,
but the second crew came with a fresU
burst o< speed, and little Mangan had to
make his men work to Jaud a boat's
length victory.
The best race of the day was the senior
barge race. It was nip and tuck from
start to finish, and a great deal of the
credit for the victory is due to the skilliul
steering of Mangnn, the coxswain of boat
1. The winning crew was John Nolan,
Robert Ellis, George Phelan, W. McCaus
land and W. Mangan coxswain. The time
was 10:05.
The last racÂ« of the day was between the

Hopes and Fears
of Endless Life.
K>T after the 1 of a carnal com
mandment, but after the power of
an endless life," was the text
chosen by Rev. H. T. Shepard in
yesterday morning's sermon at Olivet
Congregational Church. He said:
'â The truth of the endless life, which is
faith in the resurreciion of Jesus, brings
relief to the business man wlio feels the
insufficiency of financial success to satisfy
the best desires of the human heart. It
comes with its warning to the man who
caters to immorality, and deals in the
souls of men and women through their
prostitution to worst passions. It brings
! hope to tn- victim of poverty and mis
i fortune and consequent dishonor, and
opens the door to reiorm and purity in the
years to come. Competition in the secular
world ia growing more intense, and in
creasing hostility between different social
elements is ominous of coming storms.
The gospel of endless life relieve* this
conflict of its most trying features by in
spiring hope for the future."
Life Is Not the End
of All Existence.
REV. FRANK S. FORD preached at
the First Christian Church yester
day morning on the subject, "Con
sider the Lilies." He said:
"This life is not the end of all existence,
and God's love ha 3so constituted us that
we should learn the lesson, yet we mias
it bocau-e ot the prominence eiven to
these surroundings. 'You cannot serve
God and Mammon' speaks not of the
worshipx>f gold, but ot the exaltation of
the moment into the place of the ulti
mate.
" 'Life is more than meat and the body
more than raiment,' and yet we exalt the
meat and raiment more than the life.
'Consider the lily.' The beauty of its
corolla is God-given, but is not for beauty
only, but for the fruit.
"Personal adorument, beauty, wealth,
pleasure are not sin ; the exaltation of
any or ail is sin, the end of when is
death."

PROFESSOR J. H. GOODELL sup

The edifice had been beautifully

Professor Goodell's adaress was from the
text, 'Now hath Christ been raised from
the >iead; the first fruits of them that are
asleep.'' The speaker, sfter giving Bibi
cal proof of the resurrection, said that this
was symbolical and a literal proof of the
rermanenry of the Christian religion.
"These facts," he saia, "make Christ real
and living â not a mere memory. They
open to us a larger life. They make his
promises credible and reliable."

Their many friends will be surprised and delighted to learn of the marriage yesierday morning of James S. Hawkins and
Miss Maude Kaufmanr.. In the bright gladness of early Easter day they stole a romantic march on their hosts of acquaint
ances, becoming the tirst wedded pair of the accepted hymeneal season.
The bride. Miss Kaufmann, is a daughter of Frederick Kaufmann, manager of the California Wine Company, ownine vine
yards iv Napa and Fresno, besides being a large holder of city property. The young lady is an exceptionally tine artist, a
graduate of the Occidental Art School, her oil painting "The Storm" being one of her best-known works. She is an accom
plished musician and a proficient in boating and swimming i-xercises. A demi-blonde, with blue eyes, her personal charms
are noted in her iargo circle of friends.
Mr. Hawkins, the groom, is a handsome and popular youne Native Son. He is cashier of N. Clark & Sons in the pottery
business and a director and stockholder in the H. T. Holmes Lime Company. A veteran member of the National Guard and
active member of the Nationals he has also been closely identified with many prominent social organizations. Mr. Hawkins,
as director-general, successfully managed the water carnival or "Night in Venice' : at Belvedere during the seasons of 1?94 and
1895. Indeed, it is notable that the idea of the water carnival â the first ever held in the State â originated on board Mr.
Hawkins' ark, the Polhwog, further famed for having housed Governor Budd on a certain celebrated trip of retirement.
And the Poliiwog is to be more romantically honored yet, for after a brief trip to Los Angeles and its fiesta the happy
couple will spend their summer honeymoon on board the ark in Belvedere Cove. They left for Los Angeles on the Corona yes
terday.

PUGILISTS SIGN ARTICLES.
Jeffries and Raker and Steve O'Donnell
and Greggalns to Fight at the
Olympic.
Tne boxine committee of the Olympic
Club met yesterday afternoon and held a
lengthy conversation with J. Jeffries and
H. Baker, the stockyard chain ;>ion.
The heavy-weights agreed finally to fight
twenty rounds under the auspices of the
club some evening in May to be selected
later on. It will be remembered that the
club matched Gans, the colored pugilist
of Baltimore, and Mike Leonard of New
York to fieht in May, but this match may
fall through as some members of the box
ing committee learned recently that Gans
can very easily dispose of Leonard, who is
not rat'd a top notcher by any means in
the East.|
It is thought that "Spider" Kelly would
give Gans a better argument than Leon
ard, and possib v the "Spider" will be
substituted for Leonard. The club has
written to Steve O'Donnell with tho ob
ject of matching him against Alec Greg
gains, and if tne Eastern pugilist will ac
cept of the terms that have been offered
him O'Donnell and Gregeains will meet
in a twenty-rourd content iii June. They
are both very clever boxers and a grand
exhibition of clean hitting and stopping
will be witnessed.
George Green and Danny Needham met
for the second time last evening ai Young
Mitchell's emporium of sports, and ar-
KueJ over weight for quite awhile. Need
ham finally agreed to light Green at 145
pounds, and the pueilists Dromised to
,-ign articles with the Occidental Club thi9
afternoon. Needham at first refused to
fight at any weight less than 150 pounds,
but Green stood out for a cut of rive
pound?, and Needham, rather than go
without a mill, consented to Green's
terms.
The California Club expects to sign
some of the fighters this evenlnc. The
committee expected to niatcn Jeffries and
Baker, but it will be surprised to learn
th.it the Olympic Club stole a march on
the bold California mutch-makers.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
J. C. Nealon and P. T. Donnelly Defeat
T. F. Bonnet and Al
Hampton.
The San Francisco handball court was
crowded yesterday, and several exciting
and closely contested games were wit
nessed.
The chief attraction was a game in
whicii J. C. Nealon and P. T. Donnelly,
the amateur champion, played against T.
Y. Bonnet and Al Hampton. The game
was keenly contested, and Nealon and
Donnelly won the final by two aces.
Another game that aroused the greatest
Interest was played between It. Lineban,
the overhand swiper, and George Hutch
inson and J. Feeney and E. Toy. It was
either team's giime from start to finish,
Linvhan and Hutchinson winning the
linal by one ace.
To settle a long-disputed controversy as
to who is the be ter player, C. J. Talo and
Harry Kacquillat played a game for a
French supoer. Talo carried off the hon
ors, winning two games to one.
Ihe game for the coast championship
between John R-ordan. the present cham
pion, and T. F. Bonnet will be played
next Sunday afternoon, aud it will De
wll worth seeing.

Charles Haas, George Steffens, Al Kuenzi,
D. Wagoner, Philip Knack, C. D. Freid

a long pole exercise, and the girls' class
with a May-poie dance. Then there were
several pretty tableaux representing the
May king and queen and their courts, and
alter that a selection by the Eintracht
singing section.
A series of tabeaux of ancient and mod
ern statuary were given with most artistic
effect. Represented on the stags were
''Theseus and Sinnis." "Ulysses Slaying
Cherjidamas Before Troja," "Seipio and
Hannibal Before the Battle of Zama,"

SHOOTING AT TWIN PEAKS.
In a Row in a Grocery- Store Thomas
Me tall Received a Bullet in the
Face.
A shooting scrape took place last night
between 8 and 9 o'clock in a grocery
store at Huttie and Merritt streets at the
base of Twin Peaks, in which Thomas Mc-
Fall received a bullet under the right
Himself, Joe and William Reedy, two
brothers, visited the saloon kept by a
man named Petesall and there a mi-iun
derstan-iing arose between the bartender,
whose first name is known to be Charley,
and McFall and his friends. "Charley"
tired two shots at McFall, one of which
took effect in McFall's face just under the
right eye and close to the nose.
The bail is supposed to be imbedded in
the muscles of the neck, and unless some
unforeseen serious results Jollow, the in
jured man will rerover.
Sergeant John Martin investigated the
case and bis report differs from the Â«tory
told by McFall.
The sergeant states that McFall, Charles
Taylor, Daniel Schliner and two DÂ»-a ly
boys, all well-kuown tou?;ti characters
went into Charles Miller's bar and asked
him for drinks. They said they hail no
money, and as they had been drinking
Miller refused to accommodate them
They said they wouid have tlie drinks
anyhow, and McFall went one way to get
behind the bar and Taylor went the
other way, while one of the Deady boys
ricked up a chair and advanced upon
** ] 1 1 io rÂ«
Being afraid oi his life, Miller picked op
a piece of lead pipe eight inches long and
struck McFall under the eye with it.
Then they all ran out.
McFall went to Richardson's drug store
and Dr. Bell examined the wound. Mc-
Fall said he had been shot by Miller, who
placed the revolver close to his face, but
there were no powder marks on his face.
No one in the neighborhood heard tbe
report of a revolver and no revolver was
found on Miller's premise?, although a
careful search was made. The piece of
lead pipe was taken vos-e=sion of by Ser
geant Martin. Under the circumstances
Miller was not arrested.

IN THE BALANCE
\
The New Council Indirectly
Will Decide the
Matter.
Apologetic Government Leads to
All Manner of Inconve
nience and Doubt
An Argument That Is Novel Against
the Bui ding at Present of
More C:nntv Roais.
Oakland OrricK San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 18. >
Ihe saloon-closing proposition which
a .itated this city to such n great degree
at the election a month ago can now be
said to repose with the new Council. This
is not to say that the. present Council will
directly take any cognizance of the mat
ter at all, nor can any direct action be ex
pected of them, as they will certainly lol
low the desire of the people as manifested
at the polls, which was not in favor of
closing at that time.
Indirectly, however, the City Council
will decide this matter during their two
years in office. Although the popular
will was not in favor of absolute closing,
a change of 500 votes would have altered
the result. More than this number, how
ever, are positively in favor of keeping
saloons out of certain resident sections of
Oakland, and it is the people who will de
cide the question the next time it is put to
the popular vote.
One of these districts is Twenty-third
avenue. For several years residents in
this section have successfully opposed all
pstitions for granting licenses. Within
the pabt week, an i almost immediately
niter the new Council took office, it is very
evident that the people who are anxious
to open saloons at Twenty-third avenue
ore determined to make another attempt.
Already half a dozsn applications lor
liquor lincenses in that district have been
rile i with the City ClerK, and as usual, an
organized effort will be mode to prevent
their issuance. Should the will of the
nipjority of residents in this district be op
posed there is no doubt that when the
question of saloon closing shall again be
voted on they will ally themselves solidly
with the temperance people and throw to
them the majority. 1; is in this manner
tiiat the present Council can be said to
have the closing proposition In their keep-
Jug.
One of tbe most conservatively pro
gressive men of Oakland takes a unique
and decidedly practical view of the new
boulevard proposition to connect two ex
istinj; roads near Ciaremont.
He says that, although no city can have
too many good roads, it is a very easy
matter for her to have too many bad ones.
At this time, instead of spending $5000 of
t tie county's money upon building a new
section oi road, for which there would be no
adequate funds to keep it in repair, it
would be far more economical to spend
that amount of money on the existing
driveway much in the time neighbor
hood, wbfch is at present absolutely im
passable for one-half of the year.
"At tbe present time," he said, "we
have more roads and streets than we can
ufford to keep in repair. While it is a
very commendable act on the part of the
Merchants' Exchange to foster any under
taking that would tend to attract people
to this city, it is also necessary to exercise
common prudence. If all the county
roads that are now open were in first-class
condition we should have all the scenic
drives that we should want. I have care
fully inspected this road, anÂ«l, tlihough it
runs close to my property, I will state
that f 30,000 would need to be expended
before it would be a thoroughly pood
driveway for its whole distance. Five
thousand dollars would be simply thrown
away.
"I think that on a little consideration
the majority of my fellow-merchants will
take my view of the matter."
At different times during the past four
years Oakland has seen a good deal of
what may be termed apologetic govern
ment. Ordinances which have been duly
passed and which should take effect "on
and after their passage" have been per
mitted to periodically slumber and to be
enforced spasmodically instead of persist
ently. This is particularly the case with
the ordinances prohibiting Jnickle in the
slot machines; requiring the hitching of
horses on certain streets; riding bicycles
on sidewalks, and permitting grass to
crow on the sidewalks in all parts of the
city. These ordinances, presumably, are
very ri^h t and proper or they would not
have been passed, and having been passed
it is presumably the duty of the Police
Department to enforce tnem in all places
nnd at all times.
Thin, however, has not been done and
the negligence cannot be laid entirely to
The Chief of Police. It has been custom
ary fordifferent Boards of Police Onmruis
sionerk to instruct the Chief of Police at
Tarious times to enforce certain ordi
nances. ThiÂ«, of course, would seem lo
indicate that unless special orders were
Kiyen these ordinances should be j er
mUted to remain inoperative. Conse
quently when a spasm of reform, so
cailed, seizes the Board of Work", citizens
who have long been permitted to disobey
ordinances with impunity consider them
selves aggr.ev.'d and oppressed when per
emptorily arrested lor refusing to comply
with these restrictions.
This is altogether wrong. A bicycle has
no more right to knock a passenger down
on the sikewalk at one per.ol of tbo year
than another. An unhitched horse is as
likely to run away and trample somebody
under foot in January as in June; pnc:.es
of weeds are no more attractive in iront of
residences in winter than in summer, and
a nlckel-in-t e-slot machine, if it be an
immoral agency, is no less so on Sunday
than on Saturday. During the last few
days special orders have gone forth to ar
rentall offender! agein-t the weed and
slot machine ordinances. This is all
riÃht, but for aeverai months pas: school
pirls. rmong others, have ba?n arrested
by officers In privste clothes for stealing a
ride on the sidewa.k with their wheels
and have been required to put up $2 to ob
tain their release. Taking ail these things
into consideration, it is but juit ihat
eittoer all f ese ordinances 'hould be en
forced all of the time or else repealed.
There certainly is nothing sugpesiivn of
good government in passing law? and al
lowing their enforcement to be left to the
discretion of the Boanl of Works and the
police, as has been tlie practice up to tUe
present time. Stuart W. .Booth.

PREACHED IN FULL DRESS
The "Booth of the Pulpit" Opens
a Mission at the Cejtrai
Chris! ian Church.
His Unusual Costume Attracted Far
Less Attention Tban H.s Idas on
;he Founiatio": of Scripture
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9uÃ Jiroadway, April 18. )
Rev. Thomas Lover of Chicago beean a
series of evangelistic sermons last night
in the Central Christian Church, of which
Rev. Edwards Davis is minister. The sub
ject of the ''Booth of the pulpit" was "Tho
Impregnable Rock of Scripture."
As announced, the preucher appeared
in lull evening dress, ana his manner was
such as to indicate a post-prandial speech,
with possibly a song, rat. er than a ser
mon.
Not long after he be. an to speak, how
ever, the immense audience forgot the un
usual apparel. He spoke, in part, as fol
lows:
The Bible is. It purports to be from God. It
assumes to be the truth, a redemptive bow
thai spans the universe of God and saves
everything from the disgrace of serving no
purpose. It is a microscopic, telescopic, kalei
doscopic fact, a connecting link between dust
ana Divinity. It abides and turvives and en
dures. A few papyrus root I*,1 *, the pyramids of
Egypt Â»ud the obelisks of the public parks of
Paris or New Yorit is all that remains <>f Cle
opatra's kingdom of the Kile. The classic
shrine* ot Greece, the rÂ«sc3 truck* and roofless
columus of Rome have fallen to aecay. The
Bible lives. It is scientifically impregnable.
The Bible account of the creation of tne
world, the nature and position of man, are bo
scientific and so determinate as lo make Scrip
tural calms to inspiration invulnerable. The
uuity of purpote that brings the writings of so
many centuries into such harmonious relation
as the different part* of the Scriptures indi
cates the divine presence.
The facts of prophecy and history as shown
in ri-e an<t fall of nations, citk-s and individu
als is indicative.
The general acceptance of the Bible wher
ever it nas been taught Indicates the weakness
of man or the divinity of God.
CRICKET OVER THE BAY.
The First Cap Match of the Season Is
Won by Alameda.
The first cricket match of the season in
the Hunter-Harrison cup contest was play
ed at Alameda yesterday, the competing
sides being the Alameda and Pacific club
elevens. While the scoring done by both
sides was anything but remarkable, owing
to lack of practice, the came was a most
interesting one. Captain Sewell of the
Pacifies won the toss and sent his oppo
nents in. Young Ward and Hellinan
played useful innings of sixteen apitce,
but the rest of the combination were dis
missed with comparative ease, for the
side's total only reached three score and
ten. This score, however, proved ade
quate for victory, for the Pacifies failed
to reach it by eight runs, in spite of Wise
man's clean bit winnings of nineteen and
Sewelll&^score, which, by the way, was
terminated by a piece of bad â¢ luck. The
I fielding on both sides was rather lax and
! the bowling of the defeated -team, es
pecially' pecially in the second inning, was .most
deplorable. The two Wards trundled ad
mirably for the victors. The score:

The threatening clouds hail tiieir effect

at hand which is usually noticeable on
Easter Sunday.
At all of the churches there was a

lilifs and California roppies banked by
dense foliage and relieved with delicate
wisteria were the materials almost ex
clusively used for decorative purposes.
As the past week has been a particularly

at the various places of worship by cart
loads and many busy hands placed them
with artistic effect
Dr. Wendte spoke on "Material and

Ketnalna Identified.
ALAMEDA, Cal,, April 18.â The badly
decomposed remains which were found at
Bay F rtn Island on Thursday have been
identified from a description of the cloth*
ing us those of Micbaeli Scaffani. The
body was disinterred this afternoon from
the potter's field and reconsigned to the
grave in San Francisco, beside his father.
Son and fattier of San Leandro went out
hunting in a skiff twenty-one days ago,
and not returning a search was made two
days after and the body of the father was
recovered near San Leandro. How they
met their death is unknown, of course,
but the natural assumption is that the
boat capsized with them. The son was
â¢iced 21 years and the identification was
by his sister-in-law. -

FIGHT IN A DANCEHALL
W. M. Sears, the Proprietor,
and John Mclatosh Badly
Wounded.
The Trouble Arose Ovar a Do'lar
That Hclntosh's Friend Took From
onÂ± of the Gir.s
John Mclntosh, a horse-trainer living
on O'Farr*ll street, near Leavenworth,
and a friend were in the saloon and dance
hall, 105 Grant avenue, early yesterday
morning, when a tight took place, during
which blood flowed freely.
The combatants were Mclntosh and his
friend and William M. Sears, the proprie
tor of tbe saloon. Mclntosh is in the Re
ceiving Hospital and says he has no recol
lection of the affray, and Sears is detained
in the Ciiy Prison.
Sears says that when he was closing up
the place between 6 and 6 o'clock Mcln
tosh and his friend were there, one of
them being asleep. They had both been
drinking hard.
"I paid one of tbe girl waiters, the last
to leare," said Sears, "|2 25, and the
young man picked a dollar up and put it
in hi* pocket. The girl tried to get him
to return it, but he put her off, and she
complained to me. 1 went up to him and
asKed him for the doilar, bat he was in
suiting, and made a pass at me with his
closed list. I struck him, dislocating my
little tin er.
"He awoke his friend and both of them
came at me. I was struck in tbe eye and
noie, which bled freely, and as I backed
behind the bar, I was struck on the fore
head with a heavy match-holder, which
knocked me down. As things were getting
uncomfortable, I seized a club and made
good nse of it upon the one nearest me.
l!ie oilier grappled with me and we :ell
to the floor. I grasped him by tbe throat
an i yelled 'police.'"
Policeman Gillen heard Sears' cries and
stopped further hostilities. Mclntoshand
Sears were taken to the Receiving Hoi
pital ana Dr. Hartley attended to their
wounds. Wclnto^h was in an unconscious
condition and remained so for several
hours. He had rive laceraied wounds on
his scalp, wlrrh was covered with lumps,
und he was suffering from concussion of
the brain.
Fears had a Ircerated wonnd on hi* sca!p
and forehead, the little finger of his rieht
hand was dislocated and his left eye was
di-eoiorcd and swollen and the size of his
nose was considerably increased. After
his wounds were dressed he was taken to
the prison.
Mclntosh's friend, who was apparently
the cause of all the trouble, made his es
cape.
Sears was last ni<jht booked by Police
men Gil'en and J. B. Baldwin on a charge
of assault with a deadly weapon.'
A SUCCESSFUL FAILURE.
Professor Karl Barnes of Stanford Unl-
verslty Addressed the Socialist*
l.imt Evening
Washington Hall on Eddy street was
filled last evening as the American Branch
of the Socialist Labor party had adver
tised a lecture by Professor Earl Barnes
who is at the head of the department for
the education of teacher* at the Leland
Stanford Jr. University. Professor Barnes
took for his discourse the paradoxical sub
ject, "A Successful Failure." In a clear,
unbiased manner he to;d the jstory of the
life of Robert Owen who lived, in theearly
part of his century, in England and wno
established a sort of co-ODerative colony at
New Harmony on the Wabash River, In
diana, 'lhe story briefly to.d was this:
Owen, while a very wealthy man, was a
great lover of tbe human race, and reco.
nizins the very slow progrsss of tbe work
ing cias-es in the line of mental, moral
and physical ndvancemont, spoke what he
believed to be the truth, and in so doing
laid lhe blame for that condition of eff.iirs
wiiere he believed it belonged â at tljedoor
of the Chrisiijn Church, ttien one of the
most powerful and influential institutions
of Enirland. As expected, he was frowned
upon by the English people, and he came
to the United States to work out his
Utopian ideas. Owen purchased the
property of a defunct German colony on
the Wabasn and established a new co
operative institution.
He labored in the cause of free speech,
the mental cultivation of ail â particularly
the laboring classes â the more intelligent
rearing of children and, above all, the
brotherhood of man. While his great
wealth lasted the colony prospered, bat it
was not self-sustaining, and when the
founder departed, broken-down and poor,
it failed. The people would not hold to
gether.
Such was the failure, but the speaker
pointed out the lines on which tbe banner
of success was planted. Out of the ruins
of Ntf* Harmony sprung another small
settlement, whose inhabitants are pros
perous, although their system of govern
ment waa drawn from the old-many of
the principles that Robert Owen estab
lished.
Many of the brightest teachers and
scholars of the Eastern and Middle States
have for their ancestors the original fol
lowers of Owen and they are enlightening
the world with their wisdom and thought.
Thus out of a failure success has resulted.
Preparations are still going on for the
celebration of International Labor day on
May 1 and a "piendid entertainment at
Metropolitan Temple is promised.
The socialists nave resumed their street
meetings and at every gathering able
speakers address the crowds. This even
ing an open-air meeting will be held on
P.uc and Kearny streets.
SECRECY BROKEN
BY STERN LAW
Filing a Marriage License
Reveals a Recent
Elopement.
Two Young People and a Friend
Go to a Pastor at
Martinez
Pledged to Secivcv, but Bound to
Record the Certific te Within
the L gal Period.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 18. j
News of an elopement that took placa
on the 14th of last month has just been
receiyed in mis city from Martinez, which
is now becoming the fashionable place for
young Oaklanders who desire to assume
niaritai responsibilities without publicity.
Harry C. Ellis, a clerk oi this city, and
Miss Susie Downer, who resides on San
P*i<lo avenue, have been engaged for
some time, and last month they made up
their minds that they would get married.
They did not care to have the young lady's
parents know of the matter until it be
came necessary, and so they went to Mar
tinez, where the ceremony was performed.
Key. E. W. Stoddard was found at his
study, after tbe young couple bad pro*
cured the license, and as everything was
straightforward the pastor married the
young elopers. They were accompanied
by Harry Gritting, who is an acquaintance
of both the young people, and he acted
the part of a witness. The trio im
pressed upon the minister the necessity of
absolute secrecy, and asked him how long
a time could elapse before it would be
necessary to make ttie affair known.
Rev. Â£. W. Stoddard looked at the cer
tificate and saw that it was dated March
14. He told the young folKs that the law
only permitted him to retain a certificate
thirty days after performing the marriage
ceremony before hÂ« was required to tile it
with the County Recorder.
Last Wedne.-day the thirty days ex
pired, and Mr. Stoddard, being unable to
keep the young folks' adventure a secret
any longer under penalty of going to jail
himself, filed the marriage certificate.
To-day knowledge that it had been tiled
reached Oakland and the relatives and
iriends of Mr. nnd Mrs. Ellis wore greatly
surprised to learn of the wedding. Tha
reason for secrecy given to the paslor wa->
rather practical. Tuey confided to him
that it would be necessary for the young
lady to remain with her parent- at lea^t a
month, at the end of which time they
would have completed their arrangements
for housekeeping. Now the secret is out
Mr. and Mrs. Ellis are receiving the con
gratulations of their friends.
SIR KNIGHTS WORSHIP.
Two Commanderies of Templars
Attend tbe Easter
Services.
Appropriate Exercise* at the First
Congregational and at Trinity
Episcopal Churche .
In pursuance of the custom of the order,
California Commandery and Golden Gate
Commandery each attended Easter serv
ices last evening. The former body was
the guest of the Trinity Episcopal Church,
where a special children's service was the
order of the evening. This service was
deemed by the rector, Rev. George Ed
ward Walk, peculiarly appropriate for, as
be pointed out in his address, the boasted
chivalry of the order could find no better
exercise than in tbe protection of the
weak and the innocent. And what more
innocent, he asked, than the little chil
dren who had gathered together to wor
ship in the house of God?
Altnoug'i no peculiar ritualistic services
had been arranged for, the Knights par
ticipated in the regular exercises, and tbe
scene was particularly impressive as the
Knights, with drawn swords, the hilts ex
tended toward the altar, repeated with the
children the Apostles' creed. No formal
address wes delivered by the rector, he
slating that the children whom he bad
brought together was the only sermon he
had to offer the commandery. He dwelt
upon the sacred character of their vows of
pioty and cnivalry, and spoke touchingly
of their duty toward the little ones. A
song service wus rendered by the chil
dren.
Tbe decorations of Trinity were elabor
ate and magnificent. The most striking
pieco was a great cross and crown of white
camellias and roses contributed by Mrs.
William Aivord in memory of departed
friends. A rustic cross was outlined with
incandescent lights. Palms wore effectively
distributed about the >anctuary.
Golden Qate Gommandery worshiped at
the First Congregational Church, where
Sir Robert Ash, prelate of the coruman
dery, and Rev. George C. Adamx, pastor,
officiated. The services at this place were
ritualistic, being composed largely of re
sponsive reading by the Sir Knights. The
cnoir rendered exquisite and appropriate
s lections.
Dr. Adams, in his address, recounted
the history of the temple at Palestine.
He explained the saying of Christ that be
could rebuild the temple in three days.
"The temple of the human heart It
Christ's natural abiding p. ace," he said.
"And when the disciples saw Christ arise
from the grave they ramembered what he
had said. For three days, according to
the Jewish reckoning, he had lain in the
grave. 'He spoke of tbe temple of his
body,' said John. He spake of that tem
ple which honors God most."
The speaker referred to tne resurrection
as G ni's interpreter, and showed bow
little by little events thus disclose the
truth to us which is bidden as is the
minerals in the mountains.
The Knights, who were under the com
mand of Sir Charles Murphy, made a
most impressive appearance.
TWO BOY BURGLARS.
Robert McKay and John Murphy
Caught Looting; a Till in a
JPruit Store.
Two mischievous school boys, Robert
McKay and John Murphy, tbe former 11
years of age, the latter two years his
senior, were arrested last evening by

gan on a charge of burglary. The young
sters were in the act of robbing a till in
Robert Burn's fruit store.Seventn and Mis
sion streets, when they were detected by
the officers and placed under arrest.
Found Dead in Bed.
Mrs. Sopn(e Miller, who told fortunes as a
means of obtaining a livelihood, was found
dead in bed in her room at 17 Sixth sti cot last
evening. It is presumed that death resulted

The army retiring board at San Francisco
having been disaolved, the following new
board has been appointed to meet at the call
of the preÂ«ident: Detail, Brigadier-General
James W. Forsyth, Colonel Charles R. Green
leaf, A. S. G.; Lieutenant-Colonel Evans Miles,
First Infantry; Lieutenant- Colonel, Third
Artillery, Captain Guy L. Edie, A. S., and First
Lieutenant Richard C. Croxton. First Infan
try, recoraer.
First Lieutenant Joseph H. Oyster, First Ar
f.ilery, has been ordered to report in person to
the president of the army retiring board at
San Francisco for examination by tue board.
First Lieutenant Edwin S. Babbitt of the
Orduauce Duper pent h*s been ordered to
iort and Lime Points on business p -naming
to the replacing of translating studs in the
breech blocks oi the twelve-inch rifles at those
points.
The following transfers in the First Infantry
have be-.'ii announced: First Lieutenant Rich
ard r. Croxtou lrom A to G, First Lieutenant
Francis E. Lacey Jr. from G to B, and First
Lieutenant il.ram MoL. Powell from B to A.
Lieutenant Powell was recently promoted
from second lieutenant in the Second Infantry
to first lieutenant of the First. He was de
tailed from Fort Keogh, Mont., to Company is
at Benicia Barracks anl transferred to Com
pany B at the Presidio reservation. Lieutenant
Lacey had been on temporary duty at Benicia
Barracks and he Is detailed there until further
orders, Lieutenant Croxton talcing his position
in Company G and assuming command In the
absence of Captain N. P. Phister, absent on
duly at the infantry and cavalry school at
Fort Leaven worth.
There Is considerable anxiety In artfiv cir
cles on this coast in regard to the delay in the
confirmation of Colonei William R. Shatter as
brigadier-general. When he is confirmed Lieu
tenant-Colonel Jacob Kline, who is now the
senior lieutenant-coionel, will be promoted
colonel, and luke charze of the Presidio post.
The position, had Colonel Snafter's confirma
tion occurred a week ago, would have fallen to
Lieuteuant-Colonei Henry C. Cook, but the
death o Colonel Kellogg of the Fifth Infantry,
which occurred on last Saturday, has created a
vacancy which must be filled by Lieuteuam-
Coionei Cook, who at that time was the teuior
lieutenant-uoiouel. The law is that the senior
lieutenant-colonel fills the first vacancy of v
colonelcy.
The death of Colonel Keltogg will cause a
number of promotions, in addition to that of
Lieutenant-Colonel Cook, namely: Major A.
H. Baiubridge ol the Tenth to be lieutenant
colonel of the Fourth; Captain R. 1. Eskridge
of the Twenty-third to be major of the Tcntfl ;
Captain James N. Morgan of the Twenty
fourth to be retired wah tho rank of major;
First Lieutenant L. C. Ducat of the Twenty
fourth to be captain of the Twenty-iounn,
vice Captain Morgan; Lieutenant Stephen
O'Connor of the Twenty-third to bo captain
of the Twenty-third, vice Eskridge; Second
Lieutenant H. G. Lyon oi the Seventeenth to
be first lieutenant of the Twenty-fourth; Sec
ond Lieutenant G. D. Moore of the Eighteenth
to be first lieutenant of the Twenty-third ; Ser
geant Ira L. Reeves of Company F, Seven
teenth Infantry, to be second lieu tens ut of
the Seventeenth Infantry, Corporal Edward S.
Walton of Company F, Fifteenth Infantry, to
be lieutenant of the Eighteenth Infantry.
The big 12-inch gun, which is to be
mounted at the Fort Point battery, has ar
rived, and will be transported to destination
this week. It is a breech-loader, weighs fifty
two tons and carries a one thousand pound
projectile.
At the Presidio and the other points thefe
has b.'en but little to occupy the attention or
the officers and men ouuide of the military
tournament that will commence to-day and
continue for several days. Admission to the
grounds will be free, but a small charge win
be made for seats on the grand stand and ou
the siae stands.
The programme for the great military tour
nament between men of t!ie Fourth Cavalry,
Third Artilierv and First Infantry, which is to
commence this afternoon at the Presidio, is h
book of fifty-four pages and is one of the neat
est of the kind ever gotten out. It Is embel
lished with a number of hait-tone pictures.
One of these shows a brigade review at the

A Dog â¢â¢ an An complice.
A short time back a well-dressed stran
ger called at a fashionable jeweler's shop
in Paris and selectnl a watch and
chain, value Â£15. Placing on the counter
his apparently well-lined purse, the cus
tomer "tried on" the watch and chain in
order to judge of the effect, when, sud
denly glancing out of the door, he shouted
"Punch! Punch! come hereâ come here,
you brute!" As the dog did not obey he
ran out after it. Punch was a clever ac
complice, and ran all the faster 'he louder
his mabter called. When tie jeweler at
last awoke to the faci that he had been

The A?bantees hold that drunkenness
forms no excuse for crime; but, by way
of preventing as far as possible any un
toward results happening through intox
ication, any one who feels that way dis
posed is under an obligation to streak his
forehead with dashes of red paint. This
danger signal warns quiet-goins people to
keep clear of the d^conte'! one.

THEY ARE NEARLY
READY TO BUILD
Generous Easter Offerings
at St. Luke's Episco
pal Church.
Ready Responses to the Pastor's
Call lor Financial As
sistance.
Easter Sunday had a special significance
at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, though
the sacred services of the day of course
occupied the major portion of the congre
gation's attention. One year ago yester
day at the Easter services it was an
nounced that the offerings would be de-
TOted to the building fund. The flourish
ing congregation at St. Luke's had out
grown the old edifice, and the need of
more extensive accommodations was felt
to be imperative. The response to the in
vitation for offerings was encouraging,
and a substantial nucleus for a building
fund wa* secured.
Dunn;; the last two months the rector,
]Vv. William Hall Moreland, and the
officers of 'lie cburcli, have been making
an energetic canvass for funds, and up to
yesterday but $10,000 of the $40,00J desired
remained to be raise !. Again, it was an
nounced that the Easter offerings would
po to the building fund, and again the re
sults were most satisfactory. Over $400
was secured in loose offerings at the morn
ing collections, and much more was se
cured iv piedges. All through the day
additional pledges kept coming in, and
the deacons now feel assured that the en
tire amount desired will be raised during
the summer.
TfaÂ« aeryices at SL Luke's yesterday
were moM impressive. About 500 com
ruuniciints were preseni at theearly morn
ing services, and at 11 o'clock the church
was crowded to its uttermost. The raorn
iriÂ£Â» sermon was by Rev. Archdeacon
Webber. The address wa? not argument
ative, the speaker choosing rather to treat
the occasion as one upon which the joy of
the world in the resurrection of the Savior
fcbould be emphasized.
In the afternoon a children's carol ser
vice wa? held. As this was expected to
be the last Easter obterved in the old
church, souvenir programmes bearing a
likeness of the old edifice were issued.
In the evening Bishop Nichols deliv
ered the sermon and administered the
rites of confirmation to 175 candidates.

END OF THE WAR
IN CHINATOWN
Minister Wu Ting-fang
Raises the Sam Yup
Boycott.
The See Yups Withdraw Their
Suit Against the Consul-
Geaera!.
The Chinese Diplomat Entertained in
B:h a mia by His Old Comrade
"Uncle G:orge Bromley."
Wu Ting-fang, the Chinese Minister,
and all but twelve of his suite leave here
tnisalternoon for Washington.
The clever diplomat ha.-* been in this
City but eight days, during which he has
learned and accomplished much.
Under tlie escort of Joseph Campbell,
attorney for the See Yap Company, who
has just returned from "Wa-hin^ton,
â¢where he has been trying to adjust his
client's differences with the Sam Yups,
his KxceKency drove through Golden
Gate Park to the Cliff House and Sutro
Heights yesterday afternoon. The party,
consisting of a dczea other Chinese digni
taries and hali that number of favored
whi f e ladies and gentlemen, occupied two
four-in-hand carry-alls.
At the Occidental Hotel, upon their re
turn, the Minister greeted a Call reporter
with the weii-meatu assertion.:
"This is a great City, the people are
lovely and kind, but I'll be so glad to get
away. I'm nearly dead and need rest."
As a m:itter <>f fact the hig ly colored
cheeKs the MiniMer brought in with him
from sea one week ago yesterday are now
drawn and sallow. He has lost ten pounds
In weient, and his general appearance in
dicated that the pace at which his friends

LEAGUE OF THE CROSS CADETS IN THEIR GRAND DRILL.
Yesterday was the tirst official drill of tne Cadets of the League cf the Cross, who are preparing for a competitive drill
for honor? in this city on Apni 29. About 600 members of thÂ« various companies from Oakland and San Francisco assembled
at the Mechanics' Pavilion at 2p. m. yesterday and drilled under Colonel Sullivan's command for more than two hours.
The band and drum corps were present and the drill was carried on with much spirit. Companies A, B, D, iÂ£, F, G, H, I, X,
L, M and KwÂ« re present. The first work was the entrance of the battalion, which was reviewed by Colonel Sullivan. On the
appearance of the band there was a regimental parade, which was imposing and ikilHully bandied. Rev. Father Yorke was
present throughout the drill accompanied by the following members of the clergy: Rev. Fathers O'Ryan, McDonald,
and Bowen of Chicago. All were much pleased with the character of the anil and expressed themselves highly concerning
the evolutions.

more will come and I will distribute them
between Peru, Cuba and Spain. lam not
considering Mexico at this time, as we
have not yet signed our treaty with that
country, nnd probably will not until some
time after my arrival at Washington."
Two of ilie Minister's most distin-
euished visitors yesterday mornine were
C. P. fiuntington ana his nephew, H. E.
Huntin^ton.
"It was only a visit de politesse," the
diplomat assured his hearer. "We met
at the club last night, talked a few mo
ments only and renewed the acquaint
ance here to-day, that is all."
After a moment of reflection, during
which he rubbed his tapering band over
his vast expanse of forehead, he shook his
head and smiled.
"That clubâ thoie jinks â fnnny things,
are they not?"
The great man did not tell of the subse
quent supper at De.monico'n with Attor
ney Campbell and n few selected among
the livelier net in Bohemia.
"There are some of my suite at tiie club
to-day for luncheon. They are young
and can keep il up, but I need more
rest."
His Excellency declares ha will never
forget the delightiui time he spent with
the BohemianÂ«.
"Mr. Campb*l!â Joe Campbpli"â he
saiti, yesterday, "induced me to accept a:i
invitation to attend the Bohemian Ciub's
twenty-hfth anniversary and the eight
ieth anr.iver-ary of the birth of Mr.
Bromley or Uncle George,' as they call
Hie saga of Bohemia.
"I knew Mr. Bromley when he was
Consul to China many years ago, and, aÂ«
I stated in my short speech last night, I
had accepted the invitation to not only
renew acquaintanceship, but to mix up a
little among people whom Mr. Campbell
told me were successful men in their re
spective callings and who would enst
aside cares and conventionalities to talk
and be themselves for a night."
Uncle George's to;tst, in which he re
lated an anecaot* of his meeting with Li
Hung Chang, still remained predominant
in the Minister's mind.
Bromley related vow he was five years
the senior of the Chinese Premier, and
this fact came ont in conversation at the
banquet board.
"Li Hung Chang," said Bromley,
"looked up and satisfaction illuminated
his broad, intelligent face as he stopped to
consider the grand possibilities that la 7

Wu Ting-fang's dods mot? during the
jinks and between glasses of wine, which
he seemed very much to appreciate, will
also be remembered by thÂ« Bohemians,
who regard him as a prince of good fel
lows.
Speaking of Uncle Georpe Bromley and
Li Hung Chang, in their full vigor lon g
past the allotted three score and tea he
said :

quite as strong as with us, yon have a j

method or system of electing oflicers of

smilingly murmured:

man, Mr. Pbelan."
"No, not tuat, your Jixceliency," re
joined Phelan. "I be? you regard it more i
as an iustance of the unpopularity of my

But, yesterday, when only the fatigue of
a night's pleasure, and a remembrance of
the fun remained, Wu Ting-fang couid
not help remarking:
'"Years ago, when Uncle George Brom
ley was Consul in China, liked and aci

QUEER THROES OF GERMS
Microscopic Bact?ria Reported
to Be Virulent May Prove
Harm'ess. \
Pseado Baciili Sometimes C:use
Groundless Fears of an Epidemic
of Diphtheria.
Dr. LÂ«witt, resident physician of the
Children's Hospital, is much exercised
over reports that there is diphtheria in
the institution, and strenuously denies
the allegation.
The physician thinks that the cases
that were supposed 10 be dirthtberia are
not eueh, and that the bacilli examined
l>y Dr. Spencer, bacteriologist of the
Board of Health, are what scientists call
false or pseudo diphtheritic bacteria.
Dr. John P. Morse of the Board of
Heelth, speaking of the matter last night,
j-aid: "Dr. Spencer being out of the City,
I should not care to speak of the subject
in an authoritative way. We of tbe'Board
! of Health reiy on his report, which is not
at tins moment before me. I will say,
however, tuat there is a pseudo diph
â  theritic bacillus, which is quite harruloss
j as compared with the virulent form."
Dr. Lewitt said yesterday: "There is not
! a ca^e in the hospital which presents any
j clinical evidence of having diphtheria. A
series of experiments are being made to
determine, if possible, the proportion of
cases in which a bacillus, resembling in
character the true diphtheria bacillus, is
to be found in the throats of children ap
parently healthy.
'"It is a well-known fact in medicine
that the true bacillus of diphtheria is oc
casionally found in the throats of persons
who are in good health and who have not
been expo-ed to the contagion of diph
theria; also that very frequently a bncmus
known as the pseudo or talse diphtheria
bacillus is very commonly found in the '
throats of healthy persons.
"In many case* this pser.do bacillus
cannot be distinguished from the trua
bacillus by the ordinary means of investi
gation; in fact the only way to be certain
is to inoculate an animal with the culture
and sÂ»ee whether the inoculation is fatal to
the animal. If the culture is ot the true
diphtheria bacillus the result is fatal,
while no rasulta follow if tua culture is
that ot the pseudo bacilli!".
' The hospital i 8 not uiuiar quarantine,
but is open to receive patienis. Should
any diphtheria arise, ilu- cases are at once
isolated, making the hospital perfectly
safe lor any children at any time."
THE KANGAROOS
CAN'T PLAY BALL
They Try Hard, but Are
Smothered by the
Olympics.
Team Work and the Fine Points
of the Game Unknown
to Them.
A Great Crowd, However, Witnessed
the D.'but at Central Park of the
Lads From the Colonies.
"Well, blind me if that wasn't the
queerest blooming trick I ever saw
played."
It was one of the Australian baseball
players. He occupied a seat on bis club's
bench on the Central Park diamond, and
Le sat there in open-mouthed and pop
eyed astonishment at what he had just
witnessed.
"Never in my life did I see anything
like that in the colonies, did you, old
chap?"
Old chap, who was also a wondering
occupant of the bench, vouchsafed that he
had not either.
It was simply a little incident oi the
seventh inning when the visitors from the
kangaroo country were at. the bat â an
amusing and pretty little play as the spec
tators saw it, but a veritable staggerer for
tn<Â» Australians.
It appears that Weldon, the Olympic
pitcher, thought he would be easy with
the man at the bat, Carter, and tossed
him what is known as a "coaxer." Car
ter's stick swished through the air and
connected with the sphere. â¢He glanced
heavenward to see how far he had
knocked tlie ball, but not catching a
glimpse of it dashed oft for first base any
how â only to find it there ahead of him.
Ttie ball had gone straight back from tie
bat into Weldon's right hand as neatly
and accurately as a ball ever moved on a
baseball field. Weldon for several sec
onds deliberately turned it over and over
in bis band as if it wore an apple and he
was picking out the choicest ; lacs for a
bite. Then he lazily turned on bis beel
and rolled the ball down to the first base
man amply in time to head off the im
ported runner.
There were many other things that the
Olympics did during the game that caused
the visiting players to sputter with ejac
ulation? of astonishment. In fact the
Olympics bad all the time an opportunity
thÂ»v needed in which to cut up ail sorts of
raoiikey shines, so "easy" were their op
ponents.
The Australians cannot play baseball.
They are a willing and jolly set of fellows
and no doubt did the best they could in
yesterday's contest, but they really don't
know much more than the rudiments of
America's National game. And as a mat
ter of Tact, with the exception of about
two of the players they have scarcely got
that far along.
The Olympics will never set the world
afire with their own playing, but they
were so far the superior of the men from
the Colonies that yesterday's game was
like watching the Baltimore;* play the Mil
pitas nine.
But with all that it was an interesting
and enjoyable game and it was witnessed
by an immense throng. The occupants of
the bieachors and grand stands were over
flowing with good nature and seemed to
enjoy the seriousness with which the kan
garoos essayed to play bull about as much
as they would a real three-ringed circus.
It was a paying game even if it was a dis
appointment from a baseball point o:
view.
The Australians go in to bat as if they
were playing cricket. The balls th*t Wel
don pitched yesterday floated up to the
plate as big as balloons and a schoolboy
could not help hitting them. Weldon
meant that they should be struck for he
had a good field ben hid him and knew
that it would be comparatively easy to
catch the Australians on the bases. But
the cricket idea will have to be abandoned
if the visitors really intend to tour the
continent as baseball players. They are
all fairly good throwers and are nimble
and quick, but are butur-nngered end
can't catch a little b t.
The fumbling and juggling they go
through when essaying to field a ball are
comical to behold. Then again they do
not seem to know whut team work ig.
Each p aver seems to think that he has
all he can attend to in looting alter his
own particular position on the field, and
he is about right. Kemp, the pitcher, and
Layer, the first baa* man, are tne b<Â«pt
players in the team. Kemp's distinguish
ing quality is his steaaine.-s. He throws
a fairlr fast left-handed ball, wi ti narrow
curves, and pul3 it over the plate rignt
along â t-iat is, as often as lie can, and lie
always trie?. The fact that his opponents
rind the ball without difficulty does not
bother him at all. That seems to be one
of the requisites of the game to his mind.
Layer, ihe guardian of the initial bag, is

he knows nothing of the fine points of the
game.
The Olympics gave the Kangaroos a
chance only once in the game and that
was in the ninth inning. The score was
20 to 3 against the visitors when they
went in to bat for the last time, so Weldon
