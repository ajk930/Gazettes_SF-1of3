SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 9.â The
lending and almogt the only topic -of
discussion among legislators here is
the opinion of Judge l>aly of the Code
Commission to the effect that the Re
publican members are not bound by
the action of the recent alleged caucus.
To-night the Judge, in a discussion in
the lobby of the Golden Eagle Hotel,
repeated liiÂ« opinion, and emphasized
it in a manner that could admit of
neither misunderstanding or dispute.
.It is conceded on all hands that if
' Senator Perkins Is not elected on the
first ballot next Tuesday he will be out
- of the fight for good. He is a most
out at the fight now, with one ley in
the political grave, for it is well un
derstood, and not denied, that seven
of the pledged fifty-eight who Toted at
the alleged caucus will vote for Samuel

of election on the first attempt.
MUST HAVE A MAJORITY.
Judare Daly Tells Why the Snap
"â¢Caucus" Doss Not Bind
the Republicans.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 9. â The
opinion of Judge Daly of the California
Code Commission, to the effect that the
-.< Vac us" of a majority of the
UepublicAn members was not a caucus at
all and that nobody is bound by it, has
caused more comment than anything that
has yet been said thus far in the life ol
the session. Several Senators and Assem
blymen called upon the Judge and asked
' him to repeat his opinion as given in The
Call the other day. The Judpe has par
ticipated in many caucuses, both in New
York and California, and is well qualified
by reason of his New York experience to
give an opinion on the subject, the politi
cal organizations of the Republican party
in New York being complete and thor
ough, while in this Stale parties are more
loosely organized.
This evening, in the lobby of the Golden
Eagle Hotel, several persons got into a
discussion with the Judge on the subject,
in the course of which he said :
"In a Darty caucus the majority casnot
bind the part}', because it is not a ques
tion of party frovernment. According to
the principles of the party every man is
free t > express his choice until there is a
sufficient number present to effect the
purpose of tbe caucus.
"There must be ability on the part of
the caucus. WhÂ°re men go into a caucus
under instructions irom their constituents
it cease* to be a caucus because the men
are not able to enter into any agreement
but one without violating their instruc
tions. For instance, here are seventy
four people who form a maj >rity of the j
120 members composing tbÂ« Legislature.
This seventy-four is a majority which
could accomplish any end they wished in
a joint ballot. Let us say there are thirty
one under instructions from their con
stituents to vote for a certain person for
United States Senator. These thirty-one
people aim to torm a caucus for the pur

' pose of selecting the person for whom
j they are instructed tv rote. But that
â would not t>e a caucus. They could only
i/o into caucus with the exact number re
quired to make themselves competent to
bring about that result, for the reason
that if this thir:yÂ»one went into caucus
with thirty-four more and the thirty-four
were for a different person the thirty-one
would not be able to keep their pledges to
their coratituents if they should consider
themselves bound by the rssult of the
caucus.
; 'Sixty persons could go into a caucus
and pass a resolution to vote for a certain
person until released. That would be an
obstructional caucus and would make a
deadlock. In that case the object to be
attained by the persons attending; the
caucus would be to obstruct or delay the
election, and beinsÂ» one-half of the total
number of legislators, they would be
sufficiently numerous to accomplish the
object for which they had met. You have
seen where a party in a majority has
divided for weeks during the session and
then united on some new man. Let us
suppose another case: bay that seventy
four men comprise a majority of the
party, and they go into caucus. There
are thirty-one of these under instructions
from their constituents. From seventy
four take thirty-one, and that leaves
forty-three votes. Forty- three votes
would be a majority of that caucus, yet
the forty-three could not accomplish their
object for the reason that the thirty-one
were obstructed, they not being free
agents and not being able to agree with
the majority.
"The principle summed up is that
where men go into a legislative body
under instructions to vote for a certain
man they cannot go into caucus without
violating their pledges. A caucus cannot

Scenes and Suggestions at Sacramento as Sketched by Culver*
bind tbe action of any man who does not
attend it, otherwise you would wire out
tbe independence and tbe individuality of
every man who goes to tbe Legislature.
It must be remembered that there is a
difference between a party principle and
the act of selecting a gentleman to repre
sent that principle. The party issue is
that he must be a Republican, and with
that exception every man can exercise his
independent action with respect to 'his
choice, and he is not bound to go into
caucus or by the action of those who do.
Thirty-one men who are instructed have
no right to co into caucus, ior the reason
that if th^y are less than a majority of the
whole they cannot curry out their part of
the agreement.
"If they go in with the agreement that
a sufficient number of those present will
agree with them and thus attempt to bind
the rest, that is a scheme, and would be
good if the number in caucus were [suffi
ient to eiect, and if there is no under
standing the pledged men have no right
to go there, because they would be in
danger of violating their pledges. There
is no National council in existence where
the majority can control the minority in
the selection of an individual candidate.
lam absolutely of the belief that every
man can exercise his right outside of any
caucus."
A very pertinent question asked by
Judge Daly during tbe discussion was tbe
following:
"You admit that the thirty-one under
instructions cannot go into caucus unless
they are sure that thirty-one will be a
majority of the caucus by reason of their
instructions, but that any number greater
than a majority of the whole can bind the
whole party. I will admit, of course, that
in practical politics any proceedure that
wins out is good, but how would it be ii
the forty-three should go into caucus and
determine upon the election of Mr. Way
mire? Would that, under your theory,
compel the thirty-one instructed members
of the Legislature to vote for Mr. Way
mire?"
There is not a very large percentage of
the members of the Legislature left in
town, and those are bard at work answer-
ing correspondence and preparing bills.
Letters and telegrams continue pouring
in from tbe south to their representatives,
setting forth that the constituencies are
not lor Mr. Perkins and that the delegates
to the conventions were not authorized to
adopt resolutions favoring the re-election
of Senator Perkins, but were sent to nom
inate candidates for offices. Hence the
instructions given by county and Assem
bly district conventions were not valid
and need not be followed. There is talk
here that Horace Davis of San Francisco
will be injected into ihe fight for a Cabi
net position. This, if true, is regarded by
the friends of Mr. Waymire as an attempt
inspired by the Perkins pull to defeat Mr.
Waymire for the Cabinet in revenge for
his bolting the alleged caucus the other
evening.
NO LONGER BOASTFUL.
Perkins' Forces Wavering and Billy
Hamilton Is Desperately Grasp
ing: for Help.
The outlook for nn opÂ«n ana vigorous
contest for the Senntorship is favorable.
Followers of the old Federal clique, who
were loudly boasting a few days since
that Perkins had a walkover and would
receive the prize on the first ballot aatnit
ted last evenine that the hgfct would be
prolonged. The forces of Perkins are
wavering. BiJly Hamilton is reaching
out in desperation for help from the Dem
ocratic camp.
The report reached him last even
i iug that more than one who was enticed
into tho Perkins ./,'â  *Â«*U vote in lino

minded am'j ind'fMcVKia.nt Repi Slican:*.
From authentic sourcss conies the intelli
gence that Hamilton and Jackson cannot
bold Southern California Assemblymen
with promises of : patronage. .
Last night Hamilton cast his eyes over
the San Francisco delegation and made a
determined effort to win .a. Republican
Assemblyman, but the San Francisco
delegation remains unbroken. .
One of tbe chief supporters of Perkins â
a man who has been using every
means to reconcile Perkins and Way
mire â said last night: "Until two hours
ago I was confident of Perkins' election.
Something has been brought to my Knowl
edge which causes me to fear that the
contest will be prolonged."
Grand Army men are indignant over
the letter which Perkins recently
wrote to Waymire, apologizing for his
conduct in throwing down the Alameda
Assemblyman for. the Cabinet. It is said
that Perkins' explanation adds insult to
injury.
Last night in the court of the Palace
Hotel a Republican who has occupied a
high judicial position in San Francnco
said: "I am taking a deep interest in the
contest for the United States Senatorship.
I have been in favor of Senator Perkins'
re-election until this time, but if what ex-
Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart told me
to-nignt is correct Perkins ought to be de
feated.
"I understand that Judge Waymire re
fuses to publish a letter which he
received from Perkins, on the ground that
it is private correspondence. Hart says
he read the letter, and its meaning is
plain that no man should aspire to a
Cabinet position unless he can entertain in
Washington in the style of a millionaire.
Waymire is reminded that his poverty
disfranchises him â that to.be poor is to be
excluded from public honor and influence;
that the high position of Cabinet Minister
Is reserved for men of vast wealth, and
not for lawyers of limited income."
"I do not know the exact language, but
Hart says the inference is so plain that
no other construction can be placed on it

than that Waymire's poverty is a bcr to
Ms promotion. It that leUer should be
published now I belitve Perkins would be
defeated. There are too many high
spirited and intelligent young men in the
Legislature to allow the insult to pass
without resenting it, and the only form
resentment could take would be to retire
Perkins from public life. We ought not
to be represented by a man who enter
tains ideas of this kind. I apprehend that
every strngeling young lawyer in the
Legislature must regard the Perkins doc
trine of public recognition of the rich and
political degredation of the poor as an in
sult to intelligent American manhood."
From other sources it is ascertained
that Perkins did write to Waymire point
ing out the expense of maintaining an es
tablishment in Washington. He assumes
that Waymiro could not afford the ex
pens*. Perkins knew perfectly well that
Waymire did not have the annual income
of a profitable steamship company and
therefore reasoned that he should not as
pire to a high position in the public serv
ice.
Judge Waymire was seen at a later hour,
and, speakiner of the letter in question,
said the correspondence was private, and
that therefore he could not pive it out for
publication. He reluctantly admitted
that reference was made to the cost of liv
ine in Washington. Waymire construes
the Senator's meaning to be that a poor
man should not entertain aspirations to
serve in the Cabinet.
Judge Waymire regards this letter as
another instance of Senator Perkins' in
gratitude and perfidy. " The fact is now
known, and I have been apprised of the
incidents," continued Judge Waymire,
"that my betrayal was agreed upon and
conceived by Perkins before he left this
city for Washington. When he was mak
ing personal professions of fidelity to my
cause, promising to recommend me to the
President, he was promising to perform
the same office for Horace Davis.
"He tola me thai he had written to the
President, mentioning Horace Davis, C.
N. Felton and myself, but that others than
myself were included as a matter of
courtesy."
1 (gin this connection the gossip goes that at
the increments' banquet Perkins sat near
Senator Morehonse and Horace Davis. To
Mr. 1 Movehouse Per Kin? said : s ! , "I specially
desire the honor.', of a re-election" at Â« the
hands of the Legislature without leaving
my place in Washington, and one cause I
have at heart, and that is to see my friend
Horace Davis in the Cabinet.": . '
At that very moment Perkins was
pledged by every obligation of honor be
tween man and man to advocate Judge
Waymire's cause. The history of politi
cal perfidy may be traced in vain to find a
parallel for this example of treachery.
High-minded and independent Republi
cans say that Perkins' conduct is indefen
sible.
The old moss-backed politicians of the
Federal brigade â the brigade that always
appears on the field when the battle is
won to pather the spoils of victory, but is
never found in front when the battle is
on â are now alarmed to activity at the
desenions from Perkins' camp. They
tried to rally Irving M. Scott to do some
bracing. Scott is quoted as saying: "Per
kins is dead and despised in Washington
by his fellow Republican Senators, who
say that he is nothing morn than the echo
of Steve White."
Thomas Shannon, ex-Congressman and
ex-Collector of the Port of San Francisco,
says he is not taking a deep interest in
the contest for the Senator3hip. He re
marked : "Perkins has promised every
thing fourteen feet deep and won't fill on
more than one promise in ten."
Among the members of the Legislature

Oscar F. Breiling, who represents the
Forty-ninth District in the Assembly, is
one of the independent and progressive
yourig men of the Republican party. He
is not afraid of the whip-cracking of the
Federal brigade of place-nunters. He is a
Native Son, a good business man, of sound
sense, and promises to wield an influence
for good in the Legislature.
PERFIDY AND DISHONOR.
Waymire Now Unalterably Opposed
to Perkinsâ Man, County, State
and Nation Betrayad.
From one of the Republican leaders in
Alameda County it was learned yesterday
that Judge Waymire has now definitely
concluded to array himself against Per
kins in the Senatorial tight, and to stand
out against him tirst, last and all the time.
Since the memorable "snap" caucus at
Sacramento, during the progress of which
the Perkins managers headed insult on
Judge Waymire in addition to the treach
cry with which they had encompassed and
betrayed him, the latter has had time to
thoroughly and critically survey the situ
ation and review the shameful incident
which resulted in his losing the high
honor which had been almost within his
grasp. What significance he failed to see
in the history of the past few days, his
friends pointed out The result is his de
termination to resent wanton insult and
treachery by asserting a manly and self
res>pec ing independence. His vote will
never be cast for Perkins.
One of his confidential friends thns
graphically and comprehensively ex
pressed his views in reference to the mat
tor, and this expression, it is understood,

PROPOSED INCREASE OF THE

House of Congress lo Vote

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.â The
text of the bill to refund the indebtedness
of the Union and Central i'acitic railroads
to the United States was perfected to-day,
so far as the committee of the whole were
concerned, and the measure, with certain
pending amendments reported to the
House at 5 o'clock, after a three days'
parliamentary battle, \ and a vote on its
passage will* be taken Monday.
In the course -of the debate, which to
day was conducted under the live-minute
rule, Bell (D.) of Texas proposed a substi
tute for the committee's bill, fixing the
rate of interest on the extended debt at 3
per cent per annum, instead of 2 per cent,
as the company proposed. Harrison (D.)
of Alabama also submitted a substitute,
constituting the Secretaries of the Treas
ury and the Interior and the Attorney-
General a committee to settle the debt,
with the approval of the President. To
this Northway of Ohio proposed an
amendment, making the committee to
consist of thi^e persons, one to be ap
pointed by each of the officials named.
The committee of the whole adopted the
two amendments offered by barker (R.)
of New Jersey to have clearly and compre
hensively specified the property and assets
of the Union Pacific to be covered by the
proposed new mortgage to the United
States, F.i.d the other to forbid the com
pany to dispose of any of its assets with
out the consent of the Secretary of the
Treasury.
Many members spoke to-day, and the
discussion was quite interesting at times.
The bill was advocated by Daniels (K.) of
New York, Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio, Arnold
(R.) of Pennsylvania, Kyle (D.) of Mis
sissippi, Henderson (R.)of Ohio, Watson
(R.) of Ohio, Cannon (R.) of Illinois,
Knox (R.) of Massachusetts, Mitchell (R.)
of New York and Faris (R.) of Indiana,
and was opposed by Bowers (K.) of Cali

debtors of the Government in the settle
ment of the debt he would advocate fore
closure and the purchase of the road by
the United Stat-s. This outburst, his col
league, Grosvenor, said came from those
who believed in the doctrines of the Ocala
platform. He prote^ed against Repub

the question for settlement to the incom
ing administration.
Early in the day's session the action of
the House last night in postponing until
Tuesday next the return of the Sergeant
at-Arms upon the execution of the war
rants for the arrest of members absent
from that session was reconsidered on
motion by General Henderson (R.) of
lowa after a vigorous effort to prevent it
by Thomas (R.) of Michigan, who had
declared bis intention to protest against
any member named in the warrant from
voting on any proposition until excused
by the House. Proceedings under the
call were formally dispensed with, and
thus the danger to many members that
they would iiot be permitted to vote on
the Pacific railroad bill was averted.
PROCt:EJ)I>GS I* DETAIL.
Interesting but lirirf Speeches on the
hrfundino Mill.
WASHINGTON*, D. C, Jan. 9â A
bill was passed confirming the erection of
a bridge of th Red River, at Fulton, Ark.,
by the Texarkana and Northern Railroad
Company, and now operated by the Tex
arkana and Fon Smith Company.
Hendersoa (R.) of lowa moved to recon
sider the vo'e of last nigbt by which the
return of the.Sergeant-at-Arms upon the
execution ot the warrants issued for the
arrest of the absent members from the
session was postponed until Tuesday.
After some debate it was agreed toâ lÃJ to
19 â and only 18 members seconded
Thomas (R.) of Michigan's demand for a
yes and no vote.
Tbe resolution carrying over the order
of arrest until Tuesday was disagreed to â
166 to 165.
Farther proceedings under the call of
the house last night were then formally
dispensed with in order that there might
be no doubt of the status of any of the
members. The House then, in committee
of the whole, Payne (R.) of New York in
the chair, resumed consideration of the
Pacific railroads funding bill, the day to
be spent under the five-minute rule.
Johnson (Â£.) of North Dakota said:
"Let no man deceive himself with the de
lusion that these roads were built by the
private fortunes of any persons. The roads
have been built out of the proceeds of sub
sidy and mortgage bonds and sales of the
land grant, netting a profit ( of over $100,
--000,000." To say nothing of what had
been done for these corporations Johnson
asked what excuse members could make
to their constituents by now adding to
that magnificent gift the sum of $128,000,
--000 more, which was what the bill prac
tically proposed to ao.
Daniels (R.) of New York urged the pas
sage of the bill as a reasonable and fair
measure. When the roads were being con
structed the country thought it had ia
them a fair equivalent for the expenditure.
Daniels did not conclude within five min
utes, and cons nt was asked that ha might
extend his remarks three minutes.
Maguire (D) of California â I have no
objection to the gentleman continuing bis
remarks; but want to say that every mem
ber from the Pacific Coast opposed to the
bill was shut out of the general debate
ye.-terday, and I shall consent only on
condition that at least some of us on this
side have our time extended.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa â There will be no
consent given 10 that. If you staved out
of thÂ« debate yesterday it was hecause of
your own election, and tirue to-day is not
to be consumed in that way.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio, without at
tempting, he Baid, to add anything to tne
argument on the affirmative side of the
question, briefly gave the reasons why he
should support the bill. The question
should be settled in the interests of the
Government and of tne road;, and the
present propoaition he believed to be ihe
best thai could be obtained, although it
might not be all that equity demanded.
Dockery (D. ) of Missouri said he should
vote against the bill for the reason that
adequate Information respecting the con
dition of the corporations had not oeen
furnished. Congress was entitled, he said,
to a full financial statement, and that had
not been given.
Arnold (R.) of Pennsylvania, discussing
some figures circulated by HuubarJ (R. )
of Missouri relating to the several propo
sitions purporting to have been made in
the past by the railroad companies, warned
the committee that the deteat of the bill
meant the issue by the next administra
tion of $6U,000,000 of bonds to pay first
liens upon the property or the abandon
ment of the claim of the Government.
Hilborn (R.) of California, opposing the
"wicked bill, called attention to the fact
that the Central Pacific Company would
not be required by the bill to give the
Government a mortgage upon the present
overland road from Sacramento to Oak
land, but the Government would get a
mortgage upon the old Western Pacific
line, abandoned lone ago except for
purely local purposes. The ferry privileges
and property, of which the majority re
port made so much, bad, since the rsiiroad
officials appeared be. ore the committee,
been transferred to another corporation,
and of course the railroad company couid
not now mortgage them. In support of
this he read a telegram from the -City
Assessor of San Francisco.
Powers (R.) oi Vermont, chairman of
the Pacific Railroads Committee, denied
the truthfulness of the statement just
made, and snid it was a sample of the
manner in which the opposition to the
bill had been carried. He undertook to
say that the railroad company had not
for two years at lpast disposed of any of
its property, but that it uad all been con
solidated into the possession of the com
pany, and the Government would get a
mortgage on it in its entirety.
Hilfcorn flaunted the Assessor's telegram,
but Powers, waving it aside, said: "I
don't care for your telegram. It comes
from an interested partyâ as interested as
the gentleman himself. "
Hilborn â It comes from a city official
and an honorable man.
Powers (scorniully)â A city official? So
is Mayor Adolph Sutro a city official, and
they are all engaged in a conspiracy to
force the Government to take the road
and operate it in the interest of the
State of California and at the expense of
alt the other States. The man who sent
the telegram, I undertake to say, does not
tell the truth.
Maguire (D.) of California paid the pend
ing bill was the worst ever offered to Con
gress for the settlement of the Pacitic rail
road debts. Two years ago the House
voted down an infinitely better proposi
tion, the Reilly bill, for the reason that it
did not sufficiently protect the interests of
the Government.
Judge M-iguire said:
"Mi. Chairman: The bill under consider
ation is decidedly the worst bill for the
8' ttlement of the Pacific railroad debt ever
offered to Congress â the worst proposition
that has ever come from these companies.
Two years ago, in the Fifty-third Con
gress, the Reilly bill, an infinitely better
bill than this, was voted down because of
its viciousness, yet it was far more favor
able to the Government than this bill.
Here are the differences between the two:
The Reilly bill extended the period for
the payment of these debts for fifty years
at 3 per cent interest per annum, while
tiiis bill extends the debts for eighty-six
year 3at 3 per cent interest per annum.
The Reilly Dill provided for a first mort
gage on each of the roads to secure the
Government lien; this bill provides fora
second mortgage to secure the (govern
ment. The Reilly bill put no mortgage
ahead of the hen of the Government ex
cept those now superior to it; this bill
puis other mortgages, amounting, in the
case oi the Central Pacific Railroad, to at
least $14,000,000 above the value of the so
called additional security now offered,
upon which they rest, ahead of the
Government claim.
"The majority of the committee has not
stated what the properties constituting
those additional securities are â has not
stated what title the companies have to
any of them â has not stated what are the
incumbrances now upon them, and has
not stated whether auv of these incum
brances overlap the aided portions of the
road and are now subordinate to the
Government lien. The only excuse for
this is that the committee has no knowl
edge of the subject sufficient to give the
inlormation. The tact is, that there is
now a $16,000,000 blanket mortgage resting
on tho Central Pacific system, which is a
first mortgage on tno Oakland moleâ the
western terminus, so far as the proposition
before the House is concerned, of the
Central Pacific Railroad. It is a third
mortgage on the remainder of tbe system
and is now subordinate to tbe present
Government lien. Under the Powers bill
it will all be included in the first mortgage
and become prior to the Government lien.
Now. the Oakland mole is not worth more
than $2,000,000 or $3,000,000, and at least
$13,000,000 of the mortgage now subor
dinate to the Government lien is to be
made prior to it. In that item alone the
(iovernment is made $13,000,000 worse off,
with respect to its security than it is to
day.
"Every other piece of so-called additional
security is mortgaged beyond its valuei
The California and Oregon Railroad has a
first mortgage resting upon it, which
amounts to $4,000,000 more than the road
is worth. The other feeders ot the Cen
tral Pacific are mortgaged, every one of
them, to the amount of not less than
$40,000 a mileâ how much more none of
us know. This committee does not know
enough about those properties} or the
titles or the incumbrances or the relatio n
of the lines to each other to advise this
House what it should do with re.-pect to
them. Not a word of testimony was
taken before the committee, not a wit
ness beiore it made his statement under
oath. The commit cc invited gentlemen
to come before it and niaKe voluntary un
sworn statements, tbe statements of in
terested panics and their agents, who for
thirty years have been lying to Congress
and to all others who have had to deal
with the interests of the Government in
these matters.
"The surviving partner of Leland Stan
ford made an unsworn statement, which
is accepted as srospel truth by the commit
tee, about matters concerning which Mr.
Stanford refused to testify beiore tbe Pa
cific Railway Commission and was re
leased from the obligation to testify by
the United States Circuit Court on the
prounJ that the act providing for the ap
pointment ot the commission did not jus
tify its attempt to force him to testify.
This failure of evidence to establish any
of tne facts essential in this settlement
should itself cause the House to reject ibis
I till. I have repeatedly called the atten
tion of the House and the chairman of the
committee to this glaring and fatal defect
to their showing. They do not deny it.
They cannot deny it. Yet, with amazing
pertinacity, they still ask tbe House to be
saiisried and pass the bilL I say to you
that this House will never be iv a position
to legislate for a settlement of these
claims until a court of competent juris
diction shall have tried and determined
all questions relating to the validity of all
alleged liens and tie relation of ail valid
liens to each other. Such a decree is ab
solutely necessary as a basis for legis
lative action, if any legislative action
shall then seem wisÂ« or necessary; but to
legislate now in the dark, in utter ignor
ance, on a question of such importance
would be monstrous.
"The interests of the Government are
not in any danger. The Government will
not have paymenis to make on the first
mortgages until foreclosure nor after fore
closure unless it becomes the purchaser at
the sale. The Government must pay its
subsidy bonds, no matter whether the
debts are funded or not, and nothing more
except the expenses of the litigation need
bepaid at any t.me unless the Government
buys the roads. The Attorney-General
has suggested certain amendments to the
Thurman act in mere matters of pro
cedure which should be made and let fore
closure proceed. Why, sir, lor twenty-five
years the validity of a large proportion of
the so-called first mortgage bonds of the
Central Pacific Railroad has been in issue.
To the extent of several millions of dollars
they were issued contrary to law and not
for the i>urpo-ie of constructing the road.
Tue Thurman net expressly reserved the
question of their validity. Tuu question
was submitted to the Committee on Pacific
Railroads on an able brief prepared by
Mr. John T. Doyle of San Francisco.
"The committee has madn no report on
that question, bui by its bill it waives the
rights of the Uuiie States in this behali,
reserved bÂ» - the Thurman act. I raised
thit question on the discussion of the
Reuly Dill two years ago, and then insisted
that the reservation In the Thurman act
must have bsen made advisedly and for
substantial reasons. Members of the com
mittee then assured the House that me
reservation was due merely to Senator
Thurman's cautious methods of draiting
bills, and had no definite purpose. I have
since examined the record of that debate
and find that in answer to a ques
tion asked of him by Senator Sargent
while the bill was under consideration,
Senator Thurman stated that the reserva
tion was made and must be retained be
cause of the certain invalidity of the first
mortgage bonds and the alleged invalidity
of a great number of them. This reserva
tion means several million dollars to the
Government and should not be waived.
"Four million dollars and upward have
been unlawfully paid by t ese two com
panies to the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany as a subsidy to keep up freight rates,
and were fraudulently charged to operat
ing expenses of the roads. These expendi
tures can be lecovered for the Govern
ment in the courts, bat this bill will waive
its right."
Judge Majjuire showed that the result of
fandin? will be to lose 82}Â£ per cent of the
Government's present claim. The Bouih
ern Pacific Company, although a powerful
corporation, is worthless as a surety for
these debts. The Central Pacific Railroad
Company expires June 1, 1911, and cannot
contract" beyond that data He also re
ferred to tli Contract and Finance Com
pany and Credit Mobilier frauds.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa made good bis
notice given earlier in the session by ob
jecting to permitting Maguire to continue
in genera) discussion of the subject after
bis live minutes had been exhausted.
Henderson (R.) cf lowa advocated the
passage of the bill because if nothing were
done foreclosure must follow, with a total
loss of the Government's claim. This was
at least an effort to save it, and that much
it was the duty of Congress to do.
McLachlan (R.) of California opposed
thp bill, referring in the course of his re
marks to the assertion that the managers
of the Central Pacific had burdened the
people of California with unjust raies for
transportation.
To this Watson (R.) of Ohio replied,
comparing charges on the Pacific roads
with local rates in the East and finding
them reasonable and proper.
Bartlett (D.) of New York opposed the
bill, declaring it the most infamous meas
ure ever proposed in this connection.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois and Kyle (D.) of
Mississippi advocated the passage of the
bill, the latter controverting especially
the statement of Maguire that the bill ex
tended the payment of the debt for eighty
three years. He had figured it out and
under the terms of the bill the debt and
interest would be extinguished in forty
seven years.
Maguire â Does the bill provide that the
debt shall have been paid at the expira
tion of forty-seven years?
Kyle â Ii does not. But if the compa
nies fail to carry out the provisions of the
bill ttie Government is more amply se
cured than at present.
Harrison (D.) o. Alabama and Bell (D.)
of T zas stated tbat HUborn was mistaken
in the statements he dad made, being mis
led by a telegram from somebody, who it
was the committee did not know.
A strong speech against the bill was
made by Grout (R.) of Vermont, who
charged that the constructors of the roads
not only cheated other people, but had
cheated Congress in the dealings over the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
roads, and it was the business of Congress
to look into tne conduct of these men in
the vast in determining bow to deal with
them now and in the future.
Knoi (R.) of Massachusetts said the
frauds perpetrated upon the people of
New England and the East in the matter
of constructing the Pacific railroads was
not the first nor the last in tbe list of
wrongdoing of that kind in connection
with Western railroads.
"If half tbe officers and directors,' 1 said
Knox, "who offended in that way had
received their aeserts our penitentiaries
would have to be enlarged." But the
time bad passed when these men could be
punished, and the only question before
the House now was whother or not some
action should be taken which wouid pre
serve some portion of the vast fortunes in
vested in the stocks and bonds of the
companies. He hoped the bill would
pass.
Perkins (R.) of lowa with much feeling
related how tbe great Northwest had been
defrauded by the diversion of the line of
th- Sioux City and Pacific branch of the
Union Pacific from the direction in which
it was originally intended to run by the
false pretense that the line could not be
constructed soutnwest from Sioux City
because of the Black Hills on the Missouri
River, the B ack Hills really bfliag 500
miles from tbe proposed route.
Broderick (R.) of Kansas proposed an
amendment requiring the Union Pacific
Company in maliing the new mortgage to
the United States to file a relinquishment
of all right or title to more than a right
of way of 100 feet in width through the
old Delaware and Pottowottomie reserva
tion in Kansas. Agreed to.
Faris(R.)of Indiana, a member of the
Comminee on Pacific Railroads, opposed
tbe amendment and favored tne passage
of the bill as reported.
Barham (K.) of California opposed the
bill, repudiating a suggestion by Faris
that the California delegation favored
governmental ownership of the roads. He
presented a telegram from Governor Budd
of California stating that the California
Legislature had agreed to a resolution
reciting tbat "any scheme for refunding
the Pacific railroads indebtedness to the
Government, or any extension of time
for the Davment of the same, must result
in maintaining an excessive capitalization
of these roads, thus requiring high rates
of fares ana freights to meet the interest
payments thereon, to the great burden
and disadvantage of the people of fhe
State of California" ; declaring opposition
to the passage of the pending bill or any
like measure, and urging the immediate
collection of the companies' debts or the
enforcement of the existing laws.
Parker (R.) of New Jersey moved an
amendment making more specific tbe
schedule of property and assets of the
Union Pacific whicn shall be subjected to
the proposed new mortgages so as to in
clude all the stocks and bonds beld by tbe
company, or which may be acquired by
its successors or assignees. The amend
ment was agreed toâ 92 :o 1. Also another
amendment forbidding the company to
dispose of any of its assets without ihe
consent of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Further opposition was made to the
passage of tne bill by Swauson (D.) of
Virginia, Ccke (R.) of Illinois and North
way (R.) of Ohioâ the latter t;vo upon tbe
grouml that the House was not so well in
formed as it should be in order to enable
the members to vote intelligently.
Nonhway said he preferred, in bis pres
ent condition, to let the Government
stand just where it did under the present
law. "I see," he said, "no necessity tor
running a foot race to get in here. Nobody
can force the Government to foreclose.
We are the only power that can compel
tbat to be done and before I won.d permit
a debtor to dictate terms of settlement I
wouid have the Government foreclose tbe
mortgage, take tbe road and operate it."
[Applause.]
The sub-iitutes for the pending bill, of
which notice had been previously given
by Beli (D. ) of Texas, to make the rate of
interest on the extended debt 3 percent
instead of 2, and by harrisqn (D.) of Ala
bama, authiT.zing a commission, consist
ing of the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of the Interior an.i the Attorney-
General, to arrange a settlement of the
debt, to be approved by the President,
were formally offered and considered to
be pending.
Northway moved an amendment to the
Harr.son substitute providing for a com
mission of three persons, one to be ap
pointed by each of tbe officials named to
make tbe arrangement.
Hubbard (R.) of Missouri, concluding
the consideration of the bill, advised non
action and the reference of the matter to
the new administration for i-ettienient,
when there shall have been further op
portunity to acquire adequate iuforma
tion, which it had not now.
The closing speech wa3 in avor of the
bill by Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio. He said
the House had bee i, through its best tal
ent, fouryears investigating this subject,
and he was not willing that the gentle
men, who would not be in their present
DOSitions, should refer the matter in all
its deformity of a defeated bill, together
with the Cuban and other unsettled con
troversies, to tbe next administration on
the theory that their successors wouid be
any better informed than themselves.
He could not agree tbat this question
should be maintained in its present con
dition in the interest of California. Their
path of duty was clearly marked out by
the majority of the Committee on Pacific
Roads.
The committee at 5 o'c'ock arose. The
bill and pending amendments were re
ported and the House at 5:30 o'clock p. M.
adjourned until Monday noon.

From Consult in Europe.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.âAssist
ant Secretary of State Rockhill recently
called upon the United States Consuls at
Amsterdam, Bremen, Glasgow, Liverpool
and Southampton for information on the
manufacture of dynamite in their dis
tricts and export therefrom. As a result
it is learned that none is made in Hol

suls report that the most extraordinary
secrecy was preserved and every precau

The single company in the Glasgow dis
trict exported principally to Australia and
Cape Colony, and from the Hamburg dis
trict alone was any satisfactory statement
obtained. Consul Robertson, after per
sistent efforts, was able io learn that the
dynamite trust of England and Germany
was about to build a large factory in
Johannesburg, South Africa; that Ger
many exports dynamite to every impor

United States, and imports none, and
found an excuse for the secrecy in the re
mark that American competition was so
damaging in Central and South America
that it was not proposed to give Ameri

to the closing of mines and completing of
railroads to which American manufac
turers bad been selling there their prod

SHORTRIDGE
GAINS VOTES
Continued from First Page.
has the approval of Judge Waymire:
"The betrayal of J. A. Waymire by
George C. Perkins is perhaps one of the
blackest cases of political ingratitude and
breach of political promises that has ever
disgraced the history of California or any
other State. Whatever Colonel John P.
Jackson, who is a candidate for Collector
of the Port, may say to the contrary,
there is absolute written proof that not
only he, but George C. Perkins, promised
and agreed to give Judge Waymire every
assistance, aid and support to bring about
his appointment as a member of President
elect McKinley's Cabinet.
"It will be remembered that Judge
Waymire was in the last Legislature and
voted for Senator Perkins. At the solici
tation of that gentleman he again became
a candidate for the Legislature from Ala
meda County, and was elected at the last
election a member of the Assembly, in or
der, as Senator Perkins hoped, that he
might again vote for him for United
States Senator.
"Before and since the election in No
vember, Senator Perkins repeatedly
sought the supp->r; of Judge Waymire,
and as repeatedly promised him that he
would use all his influence as a Senator to
secure his elevation to the Cabinet.
"Shortly before Senator Perlrins' de
parture for Washington he stated to Judge
Waymire that the object that lay ne arest
to his heart was his friend's success.
"How he violated his promises, with
what heartlessness and perfidy he be-
trayed bis fr end, the history of the last
few weeks gives abundant proof. Instead
of favoring the appointment of Judge
Waymire he secretly got together a
caucus of the California delegation and,
with utter disregard of his repeated
promises, favored and voted for Hornce
Davis.
"Nor was this enough. Having vio
lated his promises he had the effrontery
to write to Ju ige Waymire what cannot
be called other than an insincere and
hypocritical letter, in which he stated
that he did not think that Jud c Way
mire really dedired an appointment as a
member of President McKinley's Cabinet;
that the salary of such an office was small,
and tbat the expenses incident to main
taining the dignity of the place were very
great, and he therefore â insulting Judge
Waymire by a suggestion of his poverty â
thought that he could not afford to leave
his law practice to serve the people of
Calilornia and the Nation in this high
station.
"Later followed another equally fla
grant and deliberate piece of treach
ery. Having alraady once violated
his prq/nise, his friends here in Cali
fornia, seeking to retain Judge Way
mire's support, promised tbat they would
cause the Repuolicans of the Legislature
o formally indorse him for a place in the
Cabinet, and in direct and premeditated
violation of this last promise they sent
secret telegrams to members of tho Legis
lature telling them not to indorse Judge
Waymire under any circumstances.
"Never before in California, and it is to
be hoped never t&fore In any civilized
State, has there been such a shame ul case
of political perfidy. So, wben Judpe Way
mire's name was submitted for indorse
ment, not one of these astute manager^ of
Perkins' figbt and candidate for Federal
natronaee was there to speak in Judge
Way mire's behalf.
"The honest and manly men of the Re
publican party are not surprised tbat
Judge Waymire should feel that respect
for himself and bis friends demands that
he repudiate Perkins for this betrayal. It
is not so much tbe personality of Judge
Waymire that is involved. His turning
down will probably lose the State of CaliÂ«
fornia a place in the Cabinet
"There never was any need for inter
ference by the California delegation in the
selection of President McKinley's official
lamily. It was on the part of Perkins
gra'uitous in the first instance, and false
and treacherous from any point of view.
Republicans of California know that the
"election of a man from this State to a
seat in the Cabinet would mean more to
California than the selection of a dozer.
Senators. It would give the State power,
influence and reputation among the other
States of the Union; it would enable Cali
fornia's interests to h:.ve a hearing and to
have her demands granted.
"Alameda County, by whose magni
ficent Republican vote California was
saved to ihe Republican party, was deeply
interested in securing a Cabinet position
for one of her citizens; and, therefore,
since her choice, in the person of Judge
Waymire, has been betrayed and undone,
her people are visiting their censure and
their hearty disapproval on the man who
wrought Judge Way mire's defeat.
"In the face of this baseness, it is impos
sible for me to conceive how any man
with a sense of justice and a love for fair
play, can give'his support to the betrayer
of Alameda's favored son. That any of
the Alameda legislative delegation will,
under the circumstance, vote for Perkins,
I cannot for a moment believe."
A POLITICAL JUDAS.
The Object Perkins Hopes to
Achieve by His Betrayal of
Judge Waymire.
It has been a matter of mystery and
considerable speculation to many not in
formed of the ways and methods of un
principled politicians, why Senator Per
kins, in the face of sacred promises and
against the evident welfare of the State of
California, should have deliberately turned
down Judge Waymlre, resorting to the
most inexcusable treachery to accomplish
his object
The inspiration of the betrayer of Judge
Waymireis clearly shown in the follow
ing interview with a well-known Republi
can and wealthy mine-owner of Placer
County now in this City. The sole motive
of Senator Perkins- was a purely selfish
one, devoid alike of patriotism and utates
manship. Said this gentleman:
"For many years, in Intarvle/ws in the
papers here and throughout the East, in
his many addresses upon political and
other occasions, Sarr.uel M. Short ridge
has, with argument and reason which
should appeal to the Eastern Republi
cans, demanded that the great Pacific
coast should have a place in the Cabinet.
No one has ever heard him mention him
self or any particular man for that place,
but be has always iusisted that the great
Western Slope is entitled to representa
tion.
"Her mining industries, the great ques
tion of irrigating her arid lands, the Nica
ragua Canal, her commerce with the
islands of the Pacific and China, Japan,
India, Australia and New Zealand, the
important problem of Chinese and Japa
nese immigration in its strife to engulf
and swallow up American laborersâ these
are the questions which be has discussed,
and because of which he has insisted that
this coast should have a voice in the inner
councils of the Nation.
"It was hoped, it was believed that this
appeal, made not only by Mr. Shortridge,
but by many others, would be hearkened
to, and that President McKinley would be
in position and dispos9d to tionor some
citizen of the Pacihc Coast, and probably
a citizan of California would be called to
his council board.
"In the same line Mr. Shortridge has
advocated the creation of a department to
be known as the Department of Mines
and Mining, and a Secretary of Mines and
Mining as a member of the President's
Cabinet.
"Apart from its intimate relation to the
money question, the great industry of
mining has been and is the basis of Cali
fornia's greatness. Mr. Shortridge has a
practical knowledge of this industry, for
as a youth he worked in the mines of this
State, and he has, therefore, a personal
sympathy for those who toil underground.
It is largely dun to this fact that he has
advocated and championed this idea.
"Butfeelinir that the appointment of
a Cabinet officer from California would di
vide his power of patronage and weaken
hia influence with the President, Senator
Pe'kins was undoubtedly induced to take
the course he did in defeating Judge Way
mire's aspirations, by embarrassing the
President and making it impossible for
him to choose a Californian for the Cab
inet.
"Throughout this whole disgraceful be
trayal of Judge Waymire is the greater
disgrace of betraying the great Common
wealih of California, and throughout this
chapter of political treason is seen the
hand of Senator Perkins."
FEDERAL PATRONAGE.
Every Place Open to Appointment
for the Next Four Years
Promised Ten Times Over.
Chief among those who are charged with
conspiring to defeat the selection of Judge
Waymire for a place in the Cabinet is
Colonel John P. Jackson, candidate for
Collector of the Port, and who, if rumor
is correct, has been promised that posi
tion in the event of the success of Senator
Perkins.
Indeed, it is currently reported here and
in Sacramento that every Federal position
in California, which may become available
for presentation for the next four years,
has been parceled out to a small coterie of
old-time office-holders, who are always in
evidence when the victory is won. The
young men of California and others who
fieht and struegle for the Republican party
but who have not formed themselves Into
a league to hold and control the offices of
the State, are to beca^t aside.
These old-time office-holders seem to
think that the Republican party was
born, and has been sustained through
good and evil report, for no other or
higher purpose than to give them an easy
berth at the public crib. They are never
heard on the stump; tuey are never
known to have contributed legitimate
funds to carry on campaigns. They gen
erally serve as vice-presidents at the Re
publican meetings, and then, wnen the
election is ovsr and victory is won, claim
a lien and proceed to foreclosa a mortgage
on all the offices in sight.
''It is largely from this class of people,"
said a visiting member of tue Legislature
yesterday, in discussing the Senatorial
contest, "that Senator Perkins derives his
strength. He has brought these peren
nial office-seekers under his standard by
his generousâ almost unlimited â promises
of Federal patronage. These hopes of
public fodder were instilled broadcast
throughout every county in California.
"Such unbridled liberality could not
long hide i'seif under a bushel, and it was
not long before the many expectant ser
vints of Uncle Sam began to compare
notes. It is now known that every posi
tion in the appointing power of the
President-elect within the State of Cali
fornia has been promised at least a dozen
times over.
"The men who hava been promised
positions and are not members of the old
brigade may rest assured that only those
who train with the Federal brigade have
any chance of seeing their fond hopes ful
filled.
"The managers of Senator Perkins, who
are in this wise seeking to gain a support
which does not spring from admiration .or
esteem, are breathing out slanders against
the men who are willing to stand or fall
according to their merits or demerits, as
judged by the people and their qualified
representatives."
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
Senator Holloway to Present Say-
eral Popu'ar and Common-
S<>nse Bills.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 9.â Senator
J. C. Holloway comes irom the romantic
town of Cloverdale and represents a
county which das not yet been affected by
the southern craze for appropriations, in
sane asylums, reform schools. State
prisons and other institutions which in
crease the population of a county for boom
purposes, but which do not add to the de
sirableness of its quality. Hence he will
have no special bi.ls to introduce and ad
vocate, the legislation asked for by his
constituency being of a general character.
One of the bills in preparation by the
Senator piovides that banks and joint
stock -corporations must be placed in the
hands of a receiver when they are so
handled by the management that they
cease to pay the regular dividends to the
minority of the stockholders.
"In such corporations the majority con
trol," said the Senator, "aud if they con
duct the business in such a way that the
minority get nothing, they should be
closed and a receiver appointed to carry
on the business in a fair and legitimate
way. This law will be a Doon to poor
stockholders."
Another law of general application and
one very much to be desired, is a bill to
be introduced by Senator Holloway
authorizing certain town councils to levy
an additional tax for the purpose of gen
eral street work and sewerage where the
present tax is insufficient.

OF JOHN BULL
Renewed Activity Among
the Politicians Before
Parliament Opens.
Series of Amendments to Chal
lenge the Government on
Irish Reforms.
England Awakening to the Great
Suffering in Indi.i, anl Will De
vise Relief Measures.
LONDON, Enq., Jan. 9.â The retnrn of
a number of prominent joliticians to Lon
don from the various places where they
â  pent the Qhristmas holidays and the
renewed activity at the several political
clubs indicate the opening of the Parlia
mentary season Before the session opens
three Cabinet councils will be held. The
first meeting of the Ministers will be de
voted to nettling the details of the work of
the sessi6n.
At the second meeting, which it is ex
pected will be summonei for January 14,
the Queen's speech opening the session
â¢viil be prepared, and at the third meeting
the general line to be taken by the Minis
ter- on the debate in reply to the Queen's
speech will be decided upon.
The most important of a series of
amendments to tne address will directly
challenge the Government on the Irish
financial reform question. As has before
been stated in this cab'e correspondence,
John Dillon and John Redmond will each
offer an amendment, but under the de
velopment, of what is called the "New
Unionism" the Government will have to
face much more formidable opponents
than the leaders of the two sections of the
Irish Parliamentary party. The Irish
Unionists, led by Colonel Saunderson,
member for North Armagh, who is cele
brated for his bitter opposition to home
rule, propose to attack the Government
on the taxation question, and if the pend
ing arrangements are carried out Colonel
Saunderson will move an amendment,
which will be seconded either by Dillon or
Timothy Healy, showing the strange
political bedfellows that have been made
by the taxation agitation.
The debate on the address is expected
to last over two weeks, and tnere is in
creasing uneasiness among the ministe
rialists as to its issues. No defeat ot the
Government is expected, but it is ieared
that there will be such a depletion of the
Unioni-t majority as will force the Cabi
net to deal with Irish matters within con
venient promptitude.
The Nationalist- Unionist coalition
grows in strength rapidly. Ireland will
not await a deliverance from the new com
mittee, through which the Government
designs to delay dealing with the Irish
demands for financial redress. If the Irish
members of all political iaitns fail to ob
tain some better satisfaction of their de
mands than the appointment of a new
commission they can make the whole ses
sion a campaign of obstruction, which
would blast the Government programme.
It apt ears that England has at last
awakened irom har apathy regarding the
Indian famine sufferers, %nd that meas
ures will be taken to alleviate the distress,
notwithstanding the purblind attitude of
the Indian Government, which does not,
or will not. see that tne situation is one
of the worst it has ever had to confront.
The bold official reports from the famine
districts fail to reveal, may even" be said
to conceal, the terrible perspective of suf
fering wnich lies behind the natives. The
Government of India and the India Office
are doing what they can to prevent in
formation from independent sources from
reaching the public, and in response to
inquiries as to the truth of statements ap
pearing in native newspapers of India
simply declare them to be exaggerations
or perversions of fact.
The official aim in attempting to mini
mize the calamity can only be supposed to
be due to anxiety to escape censure for a
lamentable want of foresight; but the
truth is now gradually leaking out, and
all the advices received here fully confirm
the summary of the situation cabied ex
clusively to the United Associated Presses
last week. Private and independent ad
vices concur in stating that thousands of
persons are dying irom starvation, or from
weakness that prevents them from as
similating the food tdey can obtain. It is
known that in the district of Jabalpur
alone, a district which has a population of
2,000,000, 90.000 persons have died. Thou
sands of others will have to perish, despite
any efforts that may be made to succor
them. There are people living in remote
districts, far from the railroads and other
lines of commnnication, to whom it would
be impossible to carry food until the death
lists are enormoaslv swollen.
Large as the existing Indian relief sys
tem is it is entirely unabie to meet a
'arnine period which, it is estimated, will
exteud over the whole of 1897 Cable
grams from the Viceroy of India i^ave
been received here telling cheerfully of
rains that have fallen in several parts of
the country, bnt of what possible use are
rains to a people with starvation staring
â¢hem in the tace? They cannot sit down
and wait for crops to grow, ripen and be
Harvested, but It appears that the Indian
Government, with incomprehensible fat
uity, has acted on ihe belief thai rain and
not food was warning. Of course, rain
will j-revent a recurrence of the famine,
but what is wanted now is food, and that
right S| eedily, to save thousands upon
thousands of men, women and children
from a torturine death.
The Indian Office authorities here, act
ing on unfounded presumption that no
aid was required aside from that which
would be g yen by the Indian Govern
ment, checked the Lord Mayor of Lon.ion
from starting a famine fund, but as tne
advices now at hand show that the ar
rangements for fighting the famine are
entirely inadequate, vieu ie Lord Mayor, at
the request ol Lord George Hamilton,
Secretary of State for India, has opened a
fund that promises to reach a large figure.
The question of a national relief grant
will be raised in Parliament.
Intense anxiety is manifest in Irish
circles concerning the probable fate of
Edward J. Ivory, the dynamite suspect
who wili be brought to trial next week!
As the indictment has already been found
there will be no preliminary delay. Al
though an array of eminent counsel has
been engaged in his behalf, the net has
been so closely woven around the unfor
tunate man by the New York traitors and
spies, of wnom he is the victim, that there
is not a shadow of doubt of his convic
tion.
Ivory is now said to be convinced that
he has been made the tool of a number ol
so-called representative Irishmen in Amer
ica who think nothing of wrecking a life
so that they may nave fresh material for
demagogic proclamations concerning the
hatred of the Britisn people for the Irish,
and for new appeals to the ignorant and
credulous for tunds. There is absolutely
no question but that Ivory was betrayed
to t lie British detectives by the very men
in New York and Brooklyn who induced
him to undertake the so-called mission,
and it is also a fact ihat these same men
have advised him to make a spread-eagle

The commission appointed to examine
into the depression i.i the West Indian
sugar industry has already taken the evi
dence of Neville Lubbock. Mr. Alstone
and other representatives of the West
Indian traders. The leading recommen
dation made by all the witnesses thus
far examined has been in favor of coun
tervailing duties, to offset the bounties
paid to the continental makers of beet
root sugar in the event of it being
impossible to arrive at an a. reement with
the bounty- pay ing nations to abolish the
bounties. Statistics placed before the
commission show that while the popula
tion of the British West Indies increases
at the rate of 14,000 annually, the sugar
exports have fallen 25 per cent in fourteen
years.
The French sugar planters in Martinique
and Guadalonpe are in as bad a plight as
those in the British colonies. They have
memorialized the French Government to
the effect that the French colonial sugar
industry is on the.verge of utter ruin, and
demand that against the home bounty
sy-tem they shall be allowed a grant of
5 francs on every 100 Kilograms they ex
port, whether to France or :orelgn coun
tries. The English Commissioners will

Lively times are expected in the Reich
stag immediately after the reassembling
of that body next Tuesday, the matters to
be considered by that Chamber being
numerous and important. Among the
measures which will be submitted are the
Government's demands for army credits,
which, besides providing for the addition
of a lan;e number of quick-tiring guns,
contemplate the purchase ol a railway
plant for the purpose of accelerating the
mobilization of troops, the extension of
the fort works at the Kiel and Holtenau
ends of the North Sea and .Baltic canal,
tnÂ« construction of docks and other addi
tions and improvements of military value.
The sugar bounties and currency ques
tions will also be brought up, the former
through the joint action of France and
Austria in arranging for a European con
ference on a basis which German pro
ducers contend that it would be impossi
ble for Germany to accept, France desiring
to maintain a system of indirect bounty,
tboiu-h assenting to the abolition of the
direct export premium.
In regard to the currency, it is given out
by the bimetallists that they intend to ex
ert pressure upon the Chancellor, Prince
Hohenlohe, to the end of influencing him
to seize the opportunity presented by the
mission of United States Senator Wolcott,
who has arrived in England and will visit
the Continent for the purpose of sounding
the sentiment of Europe upon the silver
question, to arrange for a bimetallic con
ference either with or without the par
ticipation of England.
The election of the executive committee
of the Stock Bourse, which, in view of the
operation of the new bourse law, was
looked forward to with great interest, took
plac* on Wednesday as appointed, but the
result is not very promising for the peace
of the Government. Of the fifteen mem
bers of the committee elected all are
strongly opposed to the new law, and not
r> single one of them is a representative of
a great financial house. The members of
the Produce Exchange simply ignored the
election for members of the executiva
committee of the Produce Bourse. Not a
voter made his appearance and there was
consequently no voting.
The appointment o: Geheimrath VVen
delstadt, tne public prosecntorof Cologne,
as the chief of the Bourse Department in
the Prussian Ministry of Commerce is
taken as a warning to the produce bour
siers that the Government intemil to take
vigorous action in the enforcement of tne
law. The agrarian newspapers are de
manding the dissolution of the free asso
ciations which have been formed in the
various German commercial centers to
take the places of the Bourses, and fur
ther demanding the prosecuting of the

Titles and Decorations Bestowed by

Correspondent's Reward.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. B.â Official ad
vices reoeived here report a number of
skirmishes by details from the commands
of Generals Begura, Gasco and Mel^uizo
in which the troops suffered small losses.
Official reports also give particulars of
the operations of Colonels Asino and Mar
tin in the Pinar del Eio province, the
troops having destroyed a large number
of bats, camps and plantations, together
with all of the rebels' resources of provi
sions, monitions, etc., found therein.
Some of the camps were stoutly defended
by the rebels, many of whom were killed.
The report that Domingo de la Garza, a
Mexican citizen, had been murdered
by Spanish troops in Guanabacoa
on the occasion of the demonstration of
Colonel Fondella is untrue. The Mexican
Consul here says that De la Garza was
Killed in a drunken brawl and that no po
litical significance can be attached to his
death.
It can be stated positively that, although
the authorities here officially deny the
statement that the Mexican, Garza, re
ferred to above, was killed by soldiers in
Guanabacoa, and that they have obtained
the acquiescence of the Mexican Consul to
the denial, the man was brutally mur
dered by soldiers for no other reason than
that they thought he was a Cuban.
General Arolas has arrived in Havana
from Pinar del Rio. . It is said that he has
been ordered to proceed to the central
troche, which extends from Jucura to Mo
ron, in the province of Puerto Principe.
The Queen Regent has conferred upon
Senor Don Prudencio Rabell, a prominent
member of the reform party and man
aging director of Diario de la Marina, the
title of Marquis Rabell.
She has also conferred the great cross
for naval merit upon the Mayor of Ha
vana, Senor Don Antonio Quesada; the
great cross for military merit upon Senor
Don Jose Maria Galvez, chairman of the
autonomist party, and the cross for mili
tary merit upon the correspondent of a
certain New York newspaper whose dis
patches always favor the Spanish cause
and have created a decided impression in
his favor among the military commanders
here, who urged General Weyler to rec
ommend to the Queen Regent that he be
honored for his services in the interests of
Spain.
The Marquis de Apistgula, head of the
constitutional party here, who has sought
to have General Weyler recalled to Spain,
will sail to-morrow for Spain.
The correspondents of the Madrid Im
parcial and Heraldo, who were recently
ordered by those journals to proceed to
Porto Rico and await further instructions
there, will leave to-morrow. Their leav
ing Cuba is due to the fact that the papers
they represent were recently seized by the
Madrid Government for exposing the mal
administration in the island and urging
Weyler's recall.
TRIAL Or SOMEILLAy.
Prosecuting Attorney JUaket a Strong
Flea for Hit Conviction.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 9.â The trial of
Luis Someillan, a naturalized American
citizen, who is charged with conspiring
against the Spanish Government, was con
tinued at 1 o'clock this afternoon. Official
duties prevented Consul-General Lee from
being present, but he sent a representative
to watch the proceedings in the interest of
the accused. After the witnesses had con
cluded their testimony, which contained
nothing material to support the charge
against the prisoner, the Prosecnting At
torney made a long speech that was full
of patriotic Spanish sentiment.
He said he despised those citizens of
the United States who had enrolled them
selves under the flag of a great and noble
nation for the sole purpose of protecting
themselves in their conspiracy against a
power with which the United States
was friendly. He declared that if the
material charges against Someillan had
not been clearly proved there was a moral
conviction that he was guilty and was
therefore deserving of being imprisoned
for life. With much vehemence he urged
the Judges to remember Spain's honor
above all other considerations ana to de
cide the case according to their convictions.
The court adjourned until Monday.
TALI AX I TUX A a ItAXGJEBS.
Defeat a Large Spanish fore* and Cap
ture the Commander.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.-A special
from Key West, Fla., says: The Texas
Rangers in the Cuban Army have distin
guished themselves again by defeating a
large force, capturing a provision irain
and making a prisoner of the commander
of the Spanish escort.
The fight took place last Friday, judg
ing by the date of the letter reporting it,
near Osalario in Pinar del Rio province.
The detail of 300 Spanish cavalry escort
ing the train was halted by a sudden fierce
fire from a hilliide. It was too steep to
charge and the Spanish replied as best
they could, taking shelter on the opposite
side of the road.
Hardly had they done this when they
were fired on from the rear, the Texans,
who numbered only 160, ambushing both
sides of the road. The Spaniards then re
treated down the road. The Texans
thereupon came out from one side, and
with shouts for "Cuba Libre/' dashed in
pursuit.
When they were well out of their shelter
the Spaniards turned, poured in a hot fire
and tben charged. The "Lone Star", boys
met them and the shock was terrific.
Men were unhorsed, norses ihrown down
and men and beasts mixed.
The second detachment of Texans came
up at this moment and the Spaniards
again retreated, capturing a lieutenant
named Stone and placing Dim in the rear
to prevent his comrades tiring on them.
The Texans, enraged at this, charged
with such fierceness that they could not
be withstood. The Spanish troops then
ell back in disorder and Stone was recov
ered.
l Captain Pavinia, the Spanish com
mander, fell from his horse wounded. He
was instantly surrounded by the Ameri
cans, put on a horse and taken off the
field before his troops could rally and suc
cor him. The Texans then went back to
the trail and carried it to Colonel Roger
ro's camp in the hills.
SENSATIONAL CASE DISPOSED OF.
Rev. Mr. Kirkpainck of Rochester Ac
quitted of ihe Charge of Imper
sonating an Officer.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Jan. B.â At 5:30
o'clock this evening the jury impaneled to
try the case of Rev. M. D. Kirkpatrick,
who was under arrest charged with im
personating an officer, brought in a ver
dict of not guilty. The arrest and trial of
Pastor KirKpatrick had been one of the
most sensational affairs that has ever at
tracted the attention of the police of the
city.
The man implicated is pastor of the Sec
ond Universalist Church, and a man of
more than local reputation. On the 19th
cf last December Mrs. Annie Adwen, who
lives in a oiocK on Exchange street, com
plained to Officer Shane, who patrols that
street, that she had been accosted by a
man who represented himself to be a de
tective, and asked her to allow him to go
with her to her room.
When she refused he threatened to ar.
rest her. She said the same man had on
two previous occasions done the same
thing. While the woman was talking
with the officer the very man of whom
they were speaking walked almost in
front of them. Mrs. Adwen recognized
him and pointed him out as the man who
had caused her so much trouble.
Officer Shane followed the man and
stopped him and asked him what he
meant by stopping women on the street
and asking to be allowed to go to their
rooms. He declined to state his motive
in doing this, but at last said he was en
gaged in getting up a series of sermons on
the immorality of the city and that he
was looking up the disreputable joints in
the city for the purpose of getting mate
rial for his lectures. He then gave his
card to the officer. Three days afterward
he was arrested on the charge of imper
sonating an officer. *
The woman was not in court when the
case was called and the prosecution swore
they had reason to believe that the de
fense had spirited her away. There was
plenty of excitement, but it was found
that through the blunder of the officers
the woman had been allowed to remain
upstairs in charge of the matron. There
was a loud laugh at the expense of the of
ficers.
The case was called Friday morning
and occupied the attention of Judge
Ernest all day. This morning it was
taken up again and finished late this af
ternoon, when the jury brought in a ver
dict on the first ballot of not guilty. The
defense practically amounted to a charge
of conspiracy against the minister. There
is talk of bringing charges against Lieu
tenant Zimmerman and Officer Shane tak
ing them before the Board of Police Com
missioners.
GENERAL BOOTS'S REPORT.
Hevietet the Work and Froipeett of the
Salration Army,
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.â ln
General .Booth's annual report on the
work and prospects of the Safvation Army
he says ' that while we have not accom
plished all expected from as in this dark
England of ours, we have gone beyond
all expectation in other dark corners of
the earth." Perhaps the United States
is one of the "other dark corners" to
which lie refers, for the next sentence
reads thus: "It is true that we have been
so far thwarted with respect to the over
sea colony part of our scheme â the one
link wanting to complete it, by the selfish
ness ana greed of men."
This is followed by the suggestion that
a final effort will be made from which
much is expected: "I have still, however,
one generous offer awaiting further in
quiry, which is not likely to be affeoted
by selfish and ignorant prejudice. Should
that prove another disappointment, I
must reconsider some of the generous
offers that have been made elsewhere."
The reference here is understood to
be an offer of land in Rhodesia which the
General received some time ago from
Cecil Rhodes, who haÃ been a hearty
supporter of the Salvation Army in South
Africa. The trouble in the state of affairs
in Rhodesia has so far stood in the way of
action in this direction.
ASAB SOB A. RECEIVER.
The Shore* Lumber Company of Ash'
land. Wit., Assigns.
ASHLAND, Wis., Jan. 9.â Because of
an application made yesterday in the
Circuit Court yesterday for a receiver for
the Shores Lumber Company E. A. Shores
and his son, E. A. Shores Jr., made an
assignment this morning to ex-Governor
Uphani, who filed a bond in the sum ol
$200,000. The Shores Lumber Company is
the largest in this city, owning a fleet of
boats. Both father and son are inter
ested in several mining and lumber enter
prises here, but it is said the assignment
will not affect the solvency of these com'
panics. The receivership application was
made by a stocknolder, the Chequamagon
Lumber Company. Governor Upham
says the assignment was forced by the
pressing of several small local claims, due
to ill feeling. Mr. Shores Sr. places the
assets at $155,000 and the. liabilities at
$10,000.
Charged With Robbing His Clients.
FORT SCOTT, Kan., Jan. 9.â Judge

erty and Hill, with embezzling $7000 or
$8000 belonging to the firm and poor cli

secured from the Pittsburg Coal Mining
Company in a number of damage suits
brought by the survivors of miners who
lost their lives in the terrible mine explo
sion at Frontenac, Kan., in 1888.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAINTTARY 10, 1897.
SENATOR PROCTOR
VISITS McKINLEY
Three New Cabinet Possi
bilities Swing Into
View.
Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island
Declines the Treasury
Portfolio.
Sherman Can Be Premier If He So
Desires, and Will Probably
Take tbe Helm.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 9.-Ma jor Mc-
Kiniey had many callers from many parts
of the country to-day and conferred with
a number of prominent Republicans. His
most conspicuous visitor was Senator Red
field Proctor of Vermont, who arrived
this afternoon from Washington and left
for the East on a late train tonight. Sen
ator Proctor lunched with Major McKin
ley and Mr. Hanna, Colonel M. T. Her
rick and C. G. Dawes at the Union Club
in this city, ana then had a conference of
several hours' duration with the President
elect and Chairman Hanna. Spbcial at
tention was given to tbe New England
situation.
As an outcome of the interview with
Senator Proctor three new Cabinet possi
bilities have swung into public view. They
are ex-Governor John D. Long of Massa
chusetts, ex-Governor Dillingbam of Ver
mont and General William F. Draper, one
of the most active of the Massachusetts
Congressmen.
Ex-Governor Long and Mr. Draper are
well known and ex-Governor Dillingbam
has a wide acquaintance in New England.
Ex-Governor Long served in Congress
with Major McKinley and General Draper
is one of New England's successful men of
affairs. The chances are that one of these
men will be selected for the Cabinet.
Senator Aidricn of Rhode Island, who
is talked of in connection with the Treas
ury portfolio, is hardly among the Cabinet
possibilities at present, for the reason that
it is thought he could not be spared from
the Senate, as it is expected he will be
charged with the management of the new
tariff bill in that body.
Major McKinley was informed to-night
that the Ohio electoral college would call
on him Tuesday next.
General George B. Williams of Wash
ington was among Major McKinley's
callers to-day.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.â The
gossip connecting the name of Senator
AJdrich of Rhode Island with the Secre
taryship of the Treasury is but a passing
compliment to a man who is in erery way
fitted for the place, and who could fill it
with great ability. Mr. Aldrich would not
accept the secretaryship ware it offered
to him. This statement can be mÂ»de on
absolute authority.
The latest name to be considered In
connection with the treasury ship is that
of Senator Cullom of Illinois, and there
appears to be some ground for this talk.
His position , while in the Senate was
quietly discussed by his colleagues this
morning, a number of whom advised that
it would be well to keep Mr. Uullom in
mind.
It appears to be practically settled that
Senator Sherman is to be Secretary of
State. He will leave for Canton Tuesday
evening in response to a request from the
President-elect, conveyed, it is under
stood, Thursday by Mr. Osborne, who was
in the city for a few hours on that day.
Senator Sherman does not care to leave
the Senate, bat has intimated to
some of bis close friends that if Mr. Mc-
Kinley insisted on drafting him into the
service be would not feel that he could
decline.
Major McKinley will return from Cleve
land, where he is now, to his Canton home
Tuesday night, and will have a conference
with Mr. Sherman the next day. Every
man of prominence who has recently re
turned from Canton brings with him the
impression that Mr. McKinley has settled
upon Mr. Sherman for his Premier, and
that that Senator will accept when the
time comes to give a final decision to Mr.
McKinley's request.
NATIONAL VKMOCHATH COJfJTBIt.
Leaders -Resolve to Keep the Tarty in the
' Political Field.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 9.â General Simon
B. Buckner of Kentucky presided over a
conference of the leaders of the National
Democratic party this afternoon in the
Auditorium . Hotel. A call of States
brought responses from seventy-five rep
resentatives from Missouri, Nebraska,
Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and In
diana. On taking the chair Mr. Buckner
declared that the National Democratic
party inaugurated at Indianapolis should
follow its programme and begin a cam
paign of education at once which would
prepare the people for its services and win
from them a strong indorsement.
He could see no means of reconciling
the Democracy and believed there could
be no consolidation so long as the old
party stood on tho Chicago platform and
advanced its doctrines.
Thomas B. Buckner, who spoke for Mis
souri, moved that Washington's and Jef
ferson's birthdays should be celebrated by
the party assembling on those days in
each State and perfecting the organiza
tion. This proposition met with unani
mous indorsement. The National . Com
mittee was also asked to print last night's
speeches and the Indianapolis platform
for general distribution. A motion to
continue the party in the political field was
carried enthusiastically. . < ~: v

BISMARCK, N. D., Jan. 9.â Senator
Hansbrough will again represent North
Dakota in the United States Senate. At the
Republican caucus to-night sixty-six Re
pnblicans were present and it was known
long before a ballot was taken that Hans
brough would win, Robinson and all of
the other candidates except Francis hav
ing withdrawn. The fatter, in fact, merely
remained in the field so that his friends
from Cass County and Far o cuuid give
him a complimentary vote. When the
ballots were counted it was found that
Hansbrough had received 48 votes, Francis
15, scattering 3. Hansbrough will be
formally chosen United States Senator on

Idaho I>emocrntÂ» and I'opuliat* Still
Unable to Pull Together.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 9.â ln the
Idaho Legislature the Democrats and
Populists have determined to caucus sepa
| rately , and there is little prospect at pres
ent of the breach between them beins
patched up. The Dubois men are sanguine
and all indications Doint strongly to their
success.
The Democrats have absolutely refused
to support Claggett (P.), and some of his
own party have gone back on him, so that
to-night he is considered practically out
of the race:
Johnson is urged by the Democrats, but
only a few of the Populists are satisfied
with him, and it looks very unlikely that
the Democrats and Populists can agree
upon any candidate. Neither AngHl nor
Cooper, Populists, can command even the
support of their own party, all of which
goes to improve the chances of Dubois.
Judge Nathan Goff for Attorney- General.
WHEELING, W. Va., Jan. 9.â ln an in
terview this evening Hon. N. A. Scott,
National committeeman from Virginia,
confirmed the report that Judge Nathan
Goff of this State would be the Attorney-
General in Major McKinley's Cabinet.
When questioned as to the correctness of
the rumor placing Judge Goff In Attorney-
General Harmon's place, Mr. Scoti said:
"The report is absolutely correct. Judge
Guff has been asked to take the Attorney-
Generalship and has accepted."
CHICAGO'S BOLD BANDITS.
Three Armed Men Beat a Saloonkeeper
to Unconsciousness, Rob His Till and
Make Their Escape.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 9.â Three men
armed with revolvers held up a saloon in
State street, Chicago's busiest thorough
fare, at half-past 8 to-night, knocked the
proprietor unconscious, robbed the till of
the day's receipts, walked out the front
door and escaped.
The saloon was well filled with cus
tumers when the thiee robbers entered
the place. The hiehwaymen walked up
to the bar and ordered the bartender,
Alexander Lewis, who is also proprietor
of the place, to hand over the contents of
the money-drawer. Lewis refused and
was reaching under the bar for his pistol
when he was struck on the back of the
head with a revolver and fell to the floor.
One of the men ran behind the bar and
emptied the cash-drawer of $50 into a
little sack, while the other two kept the
terrorized crowd from giving the alarm.
When all was ready the men backed out
slowly, and mingling with the throng in
the busiest part of Chicago's Bowery
made their escape. The whole transac
tion occupied less than five minutes.
SEHIOVB TROVBLH IB.REATBS ED.
Striking Miners at Rutland Wrought Up
to a Desperate J'itch.
OTTAWA, 111., Jan. 9.â The situation
at the Rutland village coal mine is prac
tically unchanged. A crowd of miners
gathered on the principal street this fore
noon, and, after being addressed by an
agitator, who advised bloodshed, ad
vanced upon the mine. The troops, un
der Lieutenant Hardin, waited until the
miners had advanced within 100 feet of
the buildings, when he commanded them
to halt, and was instantly obeyed.
After hooting at the guards, the mob
returned to the village, a quarter of a
mile distant. The miners are parading
the streets almost constantly, and nearly
every oae of them has a weapon concealed
upon his person. The miners were part
ly quieted at noon by a promise from
Manager Hakes of the coal company that
he would probably settle the Question of
their wages and grievances on Monday.
Bauads of sympathizers and miners are
expected in Rutland from surroundine
towns to-morrow, and serious trouble
may occur.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.â At to-day's
proceedings in the hearing of the charges
against Police Captain Chapman for raid
ing the Seeley dinner Belle Moore, who
danced at the Grotto in Chicago during
the World's Fair and who is the principal
witness for Captain Chapman, testified
that she bad been asked by Theatrical
Agent Phipps to dance without tights at
the dinner, but refused. She admitted
that she had afterward written to Mr.
Pnipps offering to do her regular dance in
costume.
Lottie Morton, a singer and dancing
soubrette, said she performed at the din
ner and that after doing her turn some of
the guests pulled her about the room, but
took no liberties with her.
Minnie Renwood, who appeared at the
dinner, made a travesty on Trilby, de
scribed her costume and the part she took.
An adjournment was taken until Tues

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.â Many of
the friends of the late Professor Herr

expressing their sympathy in her be
reavement, and offering her a testimonial
benefit performance. Yesterday Mrs.
Herrmann replied, thanking the signers
of the letter but declining the proffered
benefit.
" I appreciate their kindness," she said,
"but as long as I can make my own way
I prefer to do it Leon Herrmann, my
husband's nephew, has arrived now, and
we shall resume our tour soon. The
managers of theaters in which my hus

TOLEDO, Ohio, Jan. 9.â A. M. Woolson
of the Woolson Spice Company said to
day that from what he had just learned
there will be no trace between tbe suear
trust and the Arbucfcles, and that the two
companies will continue to operate inde
pendently of each other. It was stated
yesterday by Mr. Woolson that be would
not be surprised to see a cession of hos
tilities. This was met by denial from New
York to-day that any compromise was
contemplated.
Poo/roumi frill Again Flourish,
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 9.â Poolrooms
will again flourish in this city. In the
court of criminal correction to-day, where
"Texas" Tom Walsh was on trial, Judge
Murphy ruled that there was no law in
Missouri to prohibit or punish for pool
selling. This victory of the bookmakers
is thought to be only temporary, as the
sitting State Legislature has under consid
eration a law prohibiting pool Silling.

STILL DEVISING
WAYS AND MEANS
A Session Devoted to Iron
and Lead Ores and
the Metals.
San Bernardino Mines That Have
Been Ciosed for Want of
Protection.
Redaction of Wages A! one Has Per.
mitted tbe Tinp ate Industry
to Live.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9. ~ The
hearing before the Ways and Meant Com
mittee to-day was devoted to iron and
lead ores, metals and manufactures
thereof. The report of Mr. Draper on be
half of the manufacturers of machinery
in New England was presented without
comment on their request for a restora
tion of the McKinley rates of duty on
their product.
W. H. Alexander of Omaha, Nebr., sug
gested the following modification ot the
present paragraph in the law relating to
lead ores: "All ores of which lead is a
component part shall be dutiable at the
rate of three-quarters of 1 cent per pound
on the lead contained therein."
He thought this prorision would ac
complish the full purpose of the revenue
and be equitable to all concerned. He
did not quarrel with the rate of duty in
the present law, the chief features of
modification being the elimination of the
misleading terms, "lead ores" and "silver
ores."
John D. Davis of California said there
were immense bodies of galena ore in San
Bernardino County, California, awaiting
development. The industry bad been
started under the McXinley bill, but had
been forced to suspend under the present
law. Thousands of tons of this ore had
been taken from the mines and placed on
tne dumps ready for delivery, and if pro
tection was given these mines would again
be worked. He advocated a doty of 1
cent per pound on lead ore.
Representative Herman of Oregon ap
pealed for a duty of 10 cents per pound
upon nickel in order to allow the develop
ment of our nickel mines.
R. M. Thompson, a nickel refiner of
New York, said that Mr. Herman was in
error regarding the prospects of the mines
of the United States. He had had experts
examine the mines referred to by Mr.
Herman and found that they could not be
made to pay even with adequate protec
tion.
Stevenson Burke, president of tne Can
ada Copper Company, said that the mines
he represented were developed by Ameri
can capital, and owned by a corporation
incorporated under the laws of Ohio. In
order to have the Government and the
people of tne United States get the benefit
of nickel armor the company had sold to
the Secretary of the Navy nickel at 11
cents per pound. Just previous to this a
French company paid 22 cents tor the
same product The company had sug
gested nickel armor, and desired to have
its armor demonstrated. If the mines re-
{erred to in this country existed they did
not need protection. He suggested that
their owners be allowed to develop them
and erect refineries.
H. J. Cantwell of Missouri, speaking. for
an association of Missouri lead miners,
said the law could not be properly en
forced, and complained of the smelting
of the ores in bond.
Senator Carter of Montana requested
and was i.*iven permission to prepare and
present later a paper on. silver and lead
ores.
William A. Ingham of Philadelphia,- on
behalf of the Eastern pigiron association,
asked for the restoration of the McKinley
rates of duty on pieiron.
J. N. M. Shimer of Philadelphia asked
for the restoration of the McKinley rates
on pigiron and indorsed the scaemes of
Mr. Ingham.
J. C. Thropp of Everett, Pa., thought
the present duty on pigiron was adequate
now, but if a fair market and fair prices
should prevail it would attract the foreign
product then the duty would not be suf
ficient. Competition would keep the prices
here at a normal figure and protect the
consumer.
W. C. Cronemeyer of Pittsbnrg, a repre
sentative of the plate industry, asked for
an increase of from one-eighth to one
half cent on various grades and a new
clause to cover plates below No. 32 wire
gauge, which were manufactured here and
needed protection.
After the passage of tbe Wilson bill it
became necessary to reduce the wages of
workmen from 10 to 25 per cent. Tin
plate-makers desired the repeal of the
drawback clause of tbe present law.
Eighty per cent of all drawbacks paid by
the treasury was on tinplate, great quanti
ties of which were imported because of the
drawback.
John Jarret of Pittsburg, also a tin plate
maker, said that one of the most import
ant questions to the industry was the
drawback feature. Replying to questions
he said that the reduction of wages, to
gether with the decreased cost of steel
billets, had alone permitted the industry
to live under tbe Wilson law. The work
men had paid for the reduction of the
duty.
R. T. Smith of Baltimore, representing
the Canned Goods Exchange of that city,
argued against any increase of duty on
tinplates.
Thomas Hunter of New York State,
representing the sporting-gun manufac
turers of the State, said the domestic
makers were fully able to supply the de
mands of the home market, provided they
had protection.
R. E. Hastings of Philadelphia, speak
ing for the workers of silver and gold leaf,
aluminum and Dutch metal, all used for
decorating purposes, desired a duty to
cover the difference in the cost of labor
here and abroad.
Tne committee adjourned until Mon
day, which will be the last day of the
hearings, when various schedules, includ
ing sundries and the free list, will be
taken up.
JENDJS ATOMS' RAILROAD FARES
Bate from Ketv fork to San Frttneii co
mil Probably Be $75.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 9.-It is now
practically settled that the railway fare
from New York to ban Francisco daring
the national convention of the United
Societies of Christian Endeavor, which
meets in the latter city In July of this
year, is to be $75. The passenger asrenta
have been consulting for the past week,
but could come to no definite conclusion,
owing to the non-action of the Western
passenger agents. It may be that a rate
of $70 will be agreed on at anoiher meet
ing during the coming week. Whatever
tlie rates agreed on, tickets will give an
option on all lines, including different
ones going and returning.
Secretary Baer has sent letters to all
trustees of the united societies asking for
suggestions as topics and names of
speakers, and hopes to make this the best
programme evpr arranged. The reason
for goinc to the Pacific Coast this year
is to heJo Endeavor work there. At first
it was tbougtit t at the San Francisco
meeting, owing to the distance, might
prove less well attended than usual, but
It is found that many of the brightest
men who stayed away from recent con
ventions because of the crowds attending
them are planning to po to San Francisco.
DYNAMITING AT TAMPA.
Citizens Attempt to Abate a Nuisance by
Blowing Up a Dem, and a Battle
Results.
TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 9.â The city has
been full of sensations the past two days.
Friday morning people whose property
was injured'by backwater thrown out by
the consumers' company power station
on Hillsborough River attempted to blow
out the dam at the old station. After
ward a regular fusillade occurred between
the euards and the dynamiters. It was
thought they would not try it again, but
last night, as one of the guards was sitting
at the east end, he i aw the forms of
several men peering out into the darkness
against the river bank on tne other sLIe.
Soon the dynamiters opened fire on the
guards, which was returned, but in the
darkness tbe snots went wide of the mark.
The officials of the city 'were notified by
wire, and Captain Jones and Officer Carter
of the police force went post baste to the
scene. When they arrived all waa quiet,
and this morning they returned home.
TANNER'S INAUGURATION.
Extraordinary Arrangements for the Event
at the Illinois Capitalâ A Dearth
of Sleeping Quarters.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 9.â The State
capital is filling op with visitors thus far
in advance of the inauguration of Gov
ernor-elect Tanner on Monday. All the
Indications point to an immense throng,
and where one-half of it will sleep, unless
the railroads can move it out of town be
fore nightfall of Monday, is a question.
Every room in the hotels of every grade
has been engaged since November, with
five or six guests to a room. The lodging
houses are insured a like harvest, while
residents for miles out in tbe country have
prepared ior turning an honest dollar in
the way of entertaining a few transient
guests.
The examples of Governor Black of
New York, Pingree of Michigan and
other lately instulled State executives in
putting a veto on all display and ostenta
tion attending their inauguration have
been lost on the "machine," which has
charge of Monday's function. The "ma
chine" has money to burn, for, besides its
power to levy assessments as often as it
may take a notion, every one of its mem
bers is an office-holder, and their annual
grabs from the public will for the next six
years aggregate in the neighborhood of
a million dollars yearly. Hence they
have decided to make the inauguration of
Monday such a "blowout" as the State
has never seen. It is said that the agent
for a single champagne-importing house
has shipped to this city upon orders 2000
cases of quarts, in which the new admin
istration is to be toas cd.

Burial of a Xottd V*teran Who Ma* Be

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 9.â John A. How"
ard, who was second in command of that
detachment of the Chicago Board of Trade
Battery which captured Jefferson Davis in
iSrwin County, Ga., was buried yesterday.
He died suddenly on the porch of his
home from a stroke of apoplexy, Thurs
day evening. Only a week ago the sur
vivors of the historic battery assem
bled at their annual banquet witn
Sergeant Howard. While Jefferson Davis
was a prisoner of war Howard became
well acquainted with him, receiving from
the Confederate leader a meerschaum pipe
and a collection of gold coins. On account
of his war record he was made an honor
ary member of the Board of Trade.
Though injured in the service he would
not accept a pension.
Coatt I>efenae Convention.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 9.â The
coast defense convention which will meet
at Tampa January 20 now promises to be
important and influential. An unex
pected interest has developed in all parts
of the country, and most of the States will

ALL GONE, GLOOMY, MELANCHOLY, HE
** sits as you now sit. He sits in despair.
He broods and ponders over his misspent
early boyish life. Then he was the social
fellow of his class, now he is the thing who
lives in himselfâ brooding, always brooding.
This is a true picture. Many men lead reck-
less lives, subject themselves to baneful prac-
tices and gradually decline or waste away
until they become as the picture showsâ half
man. Tne time to stop is at the start. When
you notice prematurity; when your nights
are sleepless and you doze in the morning,
wake, find yourself worse off than before;
when your back pains, your shoulders pain,'
your head swims, your knees knock, you are
suffering from failing manhood. You should
try to stop this. If you use the great Hudyan
treatment you will live a happy. Joyful life.
Yes; you will be a sturdy, vigorous, manly
man. The Hudyan Remedy treatment Is a
certain cure. The doctois absolutely guar-
antee thii. No one else has Hudyan. Hud-
yan cures prematurity in twenty days

"Oh, goon; you are joking."

Blanche Woods, a 16-year-old school girl

Reuben Kine. one of the employes at Rural
Cemetery. Miss Woods resided with her !

remained until two months ago, when she
expressed a wish to visit her father, who

ROE'S CRIME AT WINTERS.
The Mapa Murderer Confesses That He
Was One of Lzzia Waughtel's Assail-
ants Nne Years Ago.
WINTERS, Cal.. Jan. 9.â George'S. Mo-
Kerzie, Sarr fl of Napa County, arriTed
to-day to investigate another crime which
Wi.Jiam E. Roe, the Greenwood murderer
sentenced to be hatieed next Friday, con
fesses ne it guuty of.
Nme years ago two men attacked Lizzie
Waughtel, the daughter of a wealthy
farmer who lived near town. The entire
male population searched long and dili
gentiy for tt>e perpetrators of the crime.
$3500 reward was offered and detectives
were put upon the case, but not a clew to
tae guilty ones was eTer found. The vic
tim maintained that she could positively
identity them if she saw them. A num
ber oi men were ?aken before her, bat she
always said the right men had not been
caught.
Roe has confessed to Sheriff McKer.zle
that be was one of them, and told a story
so complete in every detail that after
hearing it related by Mr. Waughtet the
Sheriff has no hesitation in declaring that
one or the gniuy m*n is now in custody
in the ueraon of Roe. The latter woifced
here after the crime was committed, and
nis picture was recognized to-day by sev
erai as a man known by the name of
Green. Who bis companion was has not

His depreda-ioEs were noticed by a young j

DEMAND FANCY
PRICES FOR LAND
Valley Railway Progress
Blocked by a Few
Owners.
Directors Unable to Acquire
Rights of Way South of
Fresno.
Unaccountabl? Oppositioa to the Ex
tension cf the Crmp>tins
Road.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 9.â The results of
the efforts of the Valley road officials to
day to settle the differences on right-cf
way matters soutn of this city, on the
route leading to Hanford, in order that
track- building might be resumed at once,
did not prove very successful; in fact,
nothing was accomplished except that the
officials were able to learn the true situa
tion of affairs. This they will report to
the directors of the company in San fran
cisco in a few days. The visiting officials
will return in the morning, but will in all
probability be back again in a few days.
For the first rniio out of Fresno the com
pany is meeting with what seems to be
unjustifiable opposition. It does not fro
pose to submit, and what action will be
takeu will not be learned until the direc
tors hold their meeting. It is plainly evi
dent that the railroad people intend, if
possible, to begin the construction of the
road southward in tbe near future.
The vii-iting officials are somewhat
guarded in their remarks, and in conver
sation with a Call representative to
night Vice-President Watt mildly put it
that the company "hoped" to continue
construction within the next few weeks.
But it was learned from other sources that
Mr. Watt and hi 3 colleagues were more
resolute than hopeful.
It is also a significant fact that the clii
cials will return to Fresno in a few days
to continue the work of settling the right
of-way matters. They appear to consider
that they have done everything in their
power to settle the differences on an ami
cable basis, and that the only course left
is m the court-- to institute condemnation
proceeding. This may as well be done at
the present time as later. The capital of
the road is idle, and the promoters of the
entemrise are in no way satisfied wi:h
keeping matters at a stand still.
Messrs. Watt, Pa v son. Storey and Pres
ton, accompanied by Kieht-of-Way Agent
C. S.. Young and A. I. Darling, were out
bright and early this morning looking
over the territory adjoining the city, over
which for the distance or about a mile
their chief trouble between tresno and
Hauford lies.
Tbe local committee of ten had promised
to obtain a free right of way for three
miles south of the city to a point where
the survey of the new road crosses the
Southern Pacific track, about two miles
north of Malaga. Through the Hughes
tract, which immediately adjoins the city,
no trouble was experienced, and from its
southern boundary the plan was for the
railroad to run aloni* East avenue for
about a mile to the place where the survey
turns and runs parallel with the Southern
Pacific line. By taking advantage of the
public highway the committee considered
tbat it had fulfilled its obligation.
But a new phase to the proposition has
appeared. The abutting property-owners
aiong East avenue have threatened to sue
the company fur heavy damages because
of the passing of the railroad in front of
their places â a repetition of the Q-street
difficulty in this'city. Desiring to avoid
litigation and trouble, the company was
willing to abandon the public roadway
and purchase a strip of land sixty feet
wide, running uarallel with it, for a right
of way. The company was and i 3 willing
to pay a reasonable value, and its repre
sentatives are showing a disposition to be
quite liberal.
iiutthis alternative plan has also proved
unsuccessful in effecting a satisfactory
settlement of the right of way for tins
mile. The officials visited all the prop
erty-owners, but did not succeed very well
in changing their attitude. .
An Armenian named Azhderian was
probably tbe pronerty-owner with whom
the greatest difficulty was experienced.
The directors wanted a strip 9ixty feet
wide off the end of his 20-acre tract. Nut
WILL MANAGE STANFORD'S BASEBALL TEAM.
s-tantoed univeksitt, Cal., January Â».
Edwin James, who will manage Stanford's baseball team during the coming season,
is one of the popular members of the junior class. His native town is Paso Robles. He
is an excellent student and gives promise of being a success in his chosen profession
civil engineering. .
In selecting James as baseball manager the committee considered the experience
be has had on various baseball teams, he being not only an enthusiast, but also a clever
first baseman ' and fielder. This experience will aid him in determining the needs of
the team in bis charge. '--~<fAk< â ' 'â ' '' ' 'â 
James entered with the class of '97 and captained the class team during his fresh
man year. The team won the college champions hi d, putting up a strong game through
out the season. He played first base and center field. James was unable to continue
his university work during (he second year of his class at Stanford, but returned \ the
year after. Having the weight necessary for tackle or guard, he tried for a position pn
the football team. Although he failed to win a place on the team his playing improved
steadily. During the baseball season he practiced faithfully and played on the Varsity
team, although not in an intercollegiate contest. " * .
James' football career was marked with more success tnis year. He was made
substitute guard and tackle. No Stanford supporter would have been alarmed had . he
been given the opportunity to play in the last game with the University of California.
He will probably try for the position of center field on this year's baseball team,
although the duties of a manager will interfere with any regular practice.
until yesterday afternoon would he place
any price on the two acres of land in
volved, and then he blandly announced
that he wanted $4000 or $2000 an acre.
Considenne that Azhderian's house and
outbuildings are located at the other end
of the lot and the real market value of the
land, which at the highest is $300 an acre,
the officials were considerably more than
surprised at Azhderiati's proposition.
Frank H. Ball refused to set any price
for a strip off t lie end of his land. In this
case it is admitted that the damage will
amount to s-omething, as the railroad will
pass immediately in front of his house.
Finding stormy opposition also to the
plan of buying a strin aloni: East avenue,
the officials looked over the surrounding
field with a view to picking out another
route over which to build- the road and
overcome the troublesome mile. Any
way would do, but their efforts were with
out avail. No practicable line could be
found but that serious obstacles would be
encountered.
The party returned to the Hughes Hotel
at noon. Tuey remained 'luring the entire
afternoon and held conferences with the
obstructing property-owners, who had
been requested to come in. This did not
prove any more successful than those of
the forenoon. The officials also met the
committees on the Reedley route, and
conferred with committeemen from Han
lord.
The Keedley people expressed them
selves as anxious to get the competing
road through for next season. They were
not idle in right-of-way matters, they ex
plained, and hoped to be able to clear up
the difficulty between Fresno aud Reedley
in the near luture.
Their hope, it seems, is not based on
the most encouraging grounds, however.
Their principal trouble lies in the Mendo
cino district, where the property-owners
are demanding heavy prices for their
lands. i
A meeting of the people la San Fran
cisco who own most of the land south of
the river will be held on Thursday neqt.
All depends on the success of this meeting
in raising lunds to purcb&sa rights of way
in Fresno County. As to the Hanford
route, uo serious trouble is anticipated be
yond the mile just south of tne'city, but
the mile of tancy values has nettled the
officials, and they wil not return to San
Francisco in the most hapny frame of
mind to report to the directors.
DECLARED AN IMPOSTOR.
Putative Representative of a San Fran
cisco Organization Given a
Setback.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 9.â M. M. Barnet,
representing himself as the manager of
the San Francisco Journal of Commerce,
arrived in the city a few days ago. He an
nounced that his purpose was to arouse
the interest of Fresno business men in the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, claiming to be the founder of the
organization but not an officer at the pres
ent time.
He went around among the local mer
chants and met with satisfactory encour
agement. He explained that as soon as
he had gained the interest of the business
men he would have an officer of the asso
ciation come down from ban Francisco
and organize a branch here. Incidentally
Mr. Barnet gathered data for a write-up of
the county's resources in his paper.
To-day a telegram was received from
Julian Sonntae, president cf the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, stat
ing tiiat Mr. Barnet was in no way a rep
resentative of the organization.
James O'Lsary, the president of the
j Journal of Commerce Publ shing Cdeq
panv, who was i^een last night, said: .
"Baruet is uot and has not been man
aging editor of the Journal, though there
was a paragraph in a Fresno paper refer
' ring to him as sucn, and also as a repre
j sentative of the Manufac.urers' and Pro
ducers' Association, which he ia not. As
soon as Julian Sonatas heard that Bar
nei was understood at Fresno to be con
nected with" the said association hfc wired
I that Barnet had noihiti:* to do with it.
"Barnet went to Fresno simply as an art
j vertising solicitor ami 10 get what busi
, ness he could for a special San Joaquin
(Valley edition oftUe Journal. He got
considerable business, and then he appar
ently thought it would be better for liim
to held it out of this paper. Just what
I his entire scheme was I 10 not know."

NAMING SENATORS
NOW HIS PASTIME
Huntington Takes a Hand
in Washington and
Oregon.
Working for tbe Ekction of Men
Who Favor His Various
Plans.
Needs More Supporters in the Upper
House of the National Legis
lature.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 9.â A gentle
man who is connected with the Jaw de
partment of the Southern Pacific recently
made the statement in Portland to a resi
dent of this State that the railroad man
agement is ju-t now being much engrossed
with tbe business of looking after the
Senatorial elections in Oregon and Wash
ington. Grover Cleveland might occa
sionally have Congress on hia hands, but
according to this authority C. P. Hunting
ton had quite as much or more to loot
after in seeing a United States Senator of
tie right complexion elected than did the
President in holding the reins over the
two Congressional teams.
For more than a week past there have
been reports to the effect that Hunting
ton's agents were stationed at Olympia,
with instructions to see that no man hos
tile to the Pacific railroads funding bill
was elected. The Legislature meets on
Monday. There are six or eight candi
dates, but only three â Judge George
Turner of Spokane, Senator Squire and
Richard Winsor, both of Seattle â have
developed any strength. Huntington's
candidate, so the Senator- makers say, is
a dark horse, and probably a Populist,
though it is possible that be has made or
may make a deal with one of the avowed
candidates.
A member of Congress recently stated
in this city that for Huntnu-ton to be
able to secure tbe passage of the funding
bill in the new Senate it would be neces
sary for him to bring about the election
of Spooner of Wisconsin, a railroad man
who already has the caucus nomination;
W. D. Chipley, a Florida railroad man,
as tbe successor of Senator Call, and cer
tainly another from either this State or
Oregon.
The Legislature stands on joint ballot
fifteen silver Republicans, fifteen Demo
crats, fifty-six Populists and twenty-five
Republicans, wnh one contest between a
Populist and a straight Republican. The
Legislature which elected John J_Â». Wilson
Senator two years apo stood on joint ballot
seventy-eight Republicans, twenty - four
Populists and ten Democrats.
Gathering at Salem.
SALEM, Ob.. Jan. 9.â The Legislature
will convene on Monday. Members from
all over the State aie arriving. A tierce
contest will ensue on the e.ectiou of a
United States Senator. It is doubtful
whether Mitchell can bold his toga. He
has many warm friends, but the gold Re r
publicans will oppose him unless he de
tines his position more clearly than he
ha 3 yet done. He will receive no Popu
list or Democratic votes.
Josepn Simon of Portland will be elected
President of the Senate without opposi
tion, but there is likely to be a keen fight
for the speakership. Jonathan Bourne,
who was elected from Portland by the Sil
ver Republicans and Populists, is making
a determined tight for it, but may not suc
ceed. Riddle of Southern O egon is a
strong man and may win. He is a gold
Republican.
It is Relieved that Mitchell will have as
hard n fight for re-election to the Senate
as did Dolph two years ago.
MOB LAW AT ORANGEVALE.
Japanese Coolies Hanged by the Neck
Until Almost Dead and Then Driven
From the Colony.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 9.â lt is re
ported that fifteen citizens of Orangevale,
situated twenty miles north of this city,
after disguising their identity by pulling
gunny sacKs over iheir heads, night be
fore Jast visited the premises of one of the
tract owners, C. Gr. Roof, who had in his
employ six Japanese, and there captured
the outfit of the little brown men. It is
claimed that ropes were put around the
necks of the Japanese, and that they were
suspended to an oak tree until nearly
dead.
After- being resuscitated they were
driven from the colony, with a warning
that if tiiey or any of their brethren ever
returned they would be hanged and left
for the Coroner.
It is also claimed that when Roof came
to the rescue of his employes and btÂ»gan
to remonstrate a rope was thrown around
his neck and he was threatened with the
same penalty that was inflicted on bis
employes, but tuat Mrs. Roof became so
hysterical and his lirtie unes so frightened
that the mob relented and allowed him
his liberty.
Over a year ago a number of Chinese re
ceived similar treatment in this locality
and they have never attempted to obtain
work in the colony since.
Xo% GalOÃ Floral Society.
LOS GATOS, Cal., Jan. 9.â The Los
Gaios Floral Society has elected the fol
lowing officers for the ensuing year:
President, Mrs. George Butler; vice-presi
dent. Mrs. S. P. Bullard; secretary, Mrs.
ElizÃbeth C. Cutler; treasurer, Mrs. Mary
Gould; accountant, Mrs. Jessie Deily;
trusteesâ H. B. Edwards and T. E. Johns.
The annual reports of the officers showed
the society to be in a good conditiop, both
as regards finances and membership.
JVap<* Atylum Change-
NAPA, Cal., J*n. 9.â The board of asy
lum trustees to-day lopped off the official
head of E. H. King, private secretary of
the institution. Mr. King has made an
efficient secretary, but by the recent ap
pointment of General Barrett as director
the boa d became Democratic. Mr. King
was unfortunate enough to be a Republi
can. J. T. Johnson was appointed to fin
the position.
Taeotnn Criminal Caies mÂ»mia*ed.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 9. â Criminal
cases against W. B. "Allen,' ex-president of
the Bank of Tacoma, for receiving de
posits after the institution was insolvent,
and against John B. Hedges, 7 County
Treasurer, for : appropriating r to his own
use interest on county deposits, were dis
missed by. Judge Parker to-day on motion
of tbe Prosecuting ; Attorney, the evidence
not being sufficient to convict.
PRIZES WON AT
THE DOG SHOW
Blue â¢ Blooded Canines on
Exhibition at the
Capital.
Famous B.w-Wows Pose Eefore
Hundreds of Interested
Spectators.
Otis Feilcws Acts as Ju : ge and
Awards Trophies to the Deserv
ing Candidates.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 9.â The
bench show of the California Kennel
Association ia one of the mo->t meritorious
ever exhibited on the coast â so say the
experts and dog lovers who are thronging
the great pavilion. There have been more
canines exhibited at former affairs of the
kind, but never such a choice and valuable
collection. This, to a great extent, is
attributed to the fact that J. OiU Fellows,
who is acting as judge in awarding the
prizes, is recognized as the highest
authority on the breeding, conformation
and individuality of dogs in the United
States, and breeders and dog fanciers
realize that their animals must possess
true merit to stand any possible chance
with the expert. In consequence, they
have presented the pick of their kennels.
There are nearly twenty St. Bernards
on exhibition, among them being J. E.
Tade's The Cid, J. Blain's Grand Duke, T.
H. Brown's Grand Master, which Has won
first prizes all over the United Btates, and
Miles Taylor's Roxey Savage Taylor, one
of the very best dogs in the State. Among
the smooth-coated St. Bernards the bitch
Vienna, owned by Mazzini Brothers of
this city, is the principal attraction. She
was greatly admired by visitors through
out the day.
The great Danes attracted a great deal
of attention, and they certainly make a
fine showing. The Cunningham kennels
head their snow with Juanita and Ivan,
both prize-winners, and the Mount Shasta
Kennels put Orchard Trilby forward as
the best one in their lot. W. E. Lovdal
makes a good showing in this department,
as does E. Euoack of this city.
The only bloodhound shown is the fa
mous Buckshot 11, and he doubtless
scared all other bompetitors out of his
class.
In hunting dogs there are numerous en
tries, with many notables, such as the
pointers Juno H and Baldy, both bench
winners; the English* sette* Countess
Noble, and Silver Plate, one of her oro-
Charm, winner of the first and
geny.
special prizes at San .Francisco, is also
present. .
The epanielsare beaded by Royal Dandy,
who is a live-tinio winner at bench shows
during the past year. O. F. Albee of
iianta Clara shows six collies â fine speci
mens of their species. The best individ
ual among them is Major Welion, a son of
Wellsborn Charlie, the greatest collie of
his time. When a little over a year old
Major Welton won a cup in Detroit from
a class of twenty-eight dogs.
During the afternoon the following
awards were made :
Class Iâ Mastiffs (open), dogsâ First, A. P.
Scheld's Duke; second, J. J. Ankecer's Alto;

Cases in the Chinese Quarter of
the City.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 9.â A large
number of cases of leprosy are reported to
nave been discovered in Chinatown. The
Chinese, usually indifferent, have become
alarmed and one merchant said they in
tended asking tie authorities to help
them to get rid of tae pest. The mer
chants did not know exactly where to ap
ply for relief, but if they decide on any
aciion the Health Department will take
charge of the matter at once and remove

Government to establish a lazaretto on
one of the islands along he Pacitic Coast.
CAPTAIN J* tCJjSOJTj MIBBIXO.
Dit appearance of the Putative Cuban
Jtecruitlno Officer.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 19.â Captain
Francia Nelson, an allrged agent of the
Cuban Junta, disappeared suddenly from
this city under suspicious circumstances
to-day. He arrived some weeks ago and
inserted advertisements for a number of
men to work in Florida mines. He gave
it out that his real mission was to gain re
cruits for the Cuban army and that he was
commissioned by the patriots to do this
work. Inquiry concerning him broi^bt a
dispatch to the effect that he was mi im
postor. Nelson had announced tlftit he
would lecture to-nieht on the Cubin war
for the benefit of the insurgents, and a
large crowd was present. When the hour
arrived it was announced that Nelson
could not deliver the lecture, as he had
been called suddenly to San Diego.
SASTJL BAMBARA SOCIALISTS.
Prominent Jlf#n Debate Before I' r ogres -
Â«im Laboring Hen.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 9.â The
ninth of a series of weekly debates, under
the auspices of the Social Labor Party of
Santa Barbara, was held here to-night.
The Rev. S. F. Foroes spoke on "The Re
lation of the Church to the Social Move
ment." He stated that the Church of
Christ shed the only light by which
socialism could ever reach the goal of
equality. If every man ana woman would
join the church social evils would disap
pear before tne word of God.
He was followed by H. J. Weeks, who
agreed with him about the Church of
Christ, but stated that his church died
with him. He said the church of to-day
was only a burle-que on its founder; that
there was not a preacher who would not
leave his flock were he offered a better
salary elsewhere.
W. E. Shepherd, the laMy defeated
candidate for Senator in this district,
spoke on "Socialism â True and False."
He read a lengthy and carefully written
paper on the social evils of jhe day,
pointing out the remedies by legislative
enactments and the introduction of social
reform text books in public schools.
Mrs. A. Blair Thaw of Montecito will
speak next Satnrday on "Plato's Be
publics."

TARIFF NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA,
The final session of the tariff conference I
was held at Chamber of Commerce Hall
yesterday at 10 a. m. The report of the
committee was submitted by General N.
P. Chipman, with the explanation that
the arrangement of schedules was the
same as given in the McKinley bill and
that the provisions of that bill in a large
measure governed the report.
The rates recommended, in the report
are generally the same as those of the
McKinley bill, in a few instances less, but
in very few greater. It was duly taken
into consideration that California is not
only exposed to competition coming from
British Columbia, Mexico, China and
Japan, but that cooly labor large ly pre
vails in the former province.
The document spoke of the reciprocal
relations existing among the States and
set fortn that a surrender of individual
interests should be made for the good of
the whole. The paper will go to the
Ways and Means Committee at Washing
ton with the title of "Proposed Tariff
legislation as It May Affect the State of
California."

Trust and Disband.
The Question Whether or Not the
Home Is a State Institution
to Ec Set at Rest.
Annual Encampment of the D part*
mem of California G. A. R. to
Be Called to Ratify It.
Tre Veterans' Home Association held a
meeting yesterday afternoon at its head
quarter*. 320 Sansome s'reet, and decided
by unanimous vote to formally turn the
institution over to the care of the State
By resolution the association asked the
department commander, G. A. R , to con
vene the annual encampment of the de
partment of California. G. A. R., at an
earlier date than that previously set, that
the department may ratify their action,
so that it may come with unquestioned
authority beiore the present session of
the Legislature and be by it confirmed
and the institution accepted and provided
for by law.
The deparment commander and several
of the other high offic.als, as weil as a
i number of the council of administration,
G. A. R., were present and took part in
j the deiib rations of the association and
concurred in the action.
This step has been in contemplation for
some time-has, indeed, always been the
ultimate intention of the association. It
haÂ» been precipitated at this time by
tue action of Secretary of State Lew
Brown taking issue with Controller Col
gan as to ihe status of the institution with
regard to the State.
The Controller holds that the home is
now a State institution and entitled to
State aid. Secretary Brown holds that it
is not a Slate institution, and therefore
not so entitled.
As for the members of the association
itself they are p.epared to say that it is
and that it isn't. In 1889 an act was
passed recognizing the home as a State
institution and allowing it a certain ap
propriation for the maintenance of the
old soldiers. Inasmuch as the institution
is now wholly under the control oi the
association, the Governor or the State
having nothing to do with the appoint
ment of governing: officials, the associa
tion recognizes that, technically, the heme
is not a State institution.
The same embarrassing question has
been raised by the Federal Government.
The United States allow? $100 a year per
individual lor the maintenance of oid
soldiers in homes provided by any State
Government. This money has been com
ing along regularly, but recently the ex
perts delegated to go over the reports in
such ca?es have found difficulty in audit
ing them to (heir aaiisiactiou. Some o!
the money received for "maintenance"
has gone into necessary buildings. Imme
diately the experts eJevaiel their eye
brows. "How can we audit sums for
maintenance charged against buildings?"
tliey said. "But the buildings are neces
sary," was thn reply.
"What nas that to do with it? How
can the Government of the United S;ates
be expected to erect buildings on private
land anyhow?"
There was the question again â "private"
land. The insiituiion must either be a
State or a Federal institution, tney said,
in order to be properly entitied to any
S: ate or Fed- raJ aid.
The Soldiers' Home is :n a perfectly
satisfactory and flourishing condition.
Over 600 veterans of the wars â t c Mexi
can war and tlie reoellion â finri a com
fortable and a cheerful abidins-place
there. They will need considerable aid
ironi the State, ai tlie hands of the pres
ent Legislature, and in view of the dis
pute between the Secretary of State and
tne Controller some difficulty mignt be
anticipated in securing what is needed.
In view of these circumstances, the asso
ciation arrived at t lie conclusion that the
time had come to make the State a tender
of the property, and this will be done.
The resolution adopted yesterday by
unanimous vote made this provision, and
authorized the proper officers oi the asso
ciation to take' act. on at once toward se
curing the permission from the proper
court to make the legal transfer. That
was to avoid the necessity of another
meeting, and so save time.
The other resolution, requesting the de
partment commander to convene the an
nual encampment as soon as possiole to
ratify the action, was then adopted.
Tlie proposition of the association does
not contemplate forfeiting all interest in
the institution or its management. The
tender will be made with the proviso tnat
the directory shall atnl number eleven, as
now, and that the G. A. R. shall be repre
sented on the' board by seven, the Mexican
Veierans by two. and the Governor and
Attorney- General or some other State
officers by the other two.
This board, which will be appointed by
the Governor, will have entire charge of
the institution, including the appoint
ment of the commandant and ali other
officers at the home. Tiiis proviso will be
ins. sled upon to guard against the home
becoming at. any time in the future a mere
political plum for the reward of ward

heelers. "If, say, in ten years we should
elect a Governor who would appoint a lot
of incompetent politicians to run this
home it would be a great outrage upon
those old soldiers, who, at that time,
wou:d*be very old," said a member ot the
board yesterday. "It ia our purpose to
guard against any such possibility if we
can. In most of the States this is the
plan adopted â we would be only following
the example of the others in adopting this
plan. Politics has always been ignored in
the conduct of this institution. The pres
ent commandant, for instance, G. W.
Walts, is a Republican; the surgeon is a
Democrat. Both receive the same salary,
$150 a month. We wish to keep it so.
"It is also to be provided that ail mem
bers of the National Guard disabled dur
ing the performance of their duty as such
shall be entitled to become inmates of the
home. There is no doubt tnat this will
be incorporated in the law. Colorado and
Idaho have already made such provision."

The Veterans' Home 4-ssociation was
organized sixteen years ago by veterans of
the Mexican war and of the Rebellion. In
ISB9 the State voted it $45,000 per annum
lor the support of 300 men, at a rate of $150
per man. The number of inmates has
been steadily increasing, however, until
now there are over 600 men in the home.
The Federal Government, as stated, lias
allowed them $100 per man. The home is
located at YÂ»>un:ville, in N;ipa County,
and is composed of extensive buildings,
surrounded by 910 acres of land. The
property was purchased in 1881 for $17,500
at what wes considered a bargain. The
land is estimated to be now worm at ieayt
$50,000. The buildings, which now num
ber quite a ooiony, have cost several
hundred thousand dollars. This money
has been raised in various ways, the orig
inal fund be. ntr secured through the Grand
Army of the .Republic and Mexican Vet
erans by donations.
The present officers of the association
are: Sidney J. Loop, president; J. D.

urer: George "W. Walts, commandant,

and G. W. Strohi.
Tne association claims the foil right to
make the transfer of toia property, but
prefers to have it ratified by the Grand
Encampment. The Grand Encampment
was to be he!d at Salinas in April next,
and however mucn before that time it
may be called it will no doubt still be tield
there. The council of administration
meets uext Saturday and the call will
probably be issued at that time. Although
tiiis action will, of course, shorten tne

expected that ti.ere will be any serious ob
jection offered on that account.

When the report of the committee was
read objection was made to the recom
mendation on burlap. Half the conven
tion became active participants in the de
bate. Ex-Mayor Pond thought it a rank
injustice to impose a duty on grain baps,
thus increasing the expense of the farmer.
Many other articles were dragged into
the discussion and mention was made of
the fact that anthracite coal is admitted
free of duty and landed here from Austra
lia at the rate of $4 50 a ton.
Finally the suggestion of Mr. Pond that
the bags be not placed on the free list but
that a drawback be imposed on exporters
by the Government covering the duty
originally paid on the bags used for hold
ing grain when they were first imported
into the country was adopted and ended
the dispute.
Mr. Oriswold moved that the tax on
soda, ash and saNoria be increased from
$5 to $10 a ton. He said that nearly $300,
--000 was invested in ihis industry by one
firm, and though in existence for ten
years it had never yet been able to pay a
dividend. The motion prevailed.
The report of the committee as amended
was then adopted by the convention and a
published report will be sent to Congress.

THREE SUITS FOR
DIVORCE ON HAND
Eva L PAillips Kept Busy
With Marital Liti
gation.
She Demands a Share of Her
Husband's $3,000,003 Worth
of Property.
Will Gc to Minnesota lor the Pur
pose of Defending Her Rights
in the Courts.
Mrs. Eva L. Phillips has filed another
interesting affidavit in her legal contest
for a part of ihe immense fortune of her
husband, H. G. Phillips, who suddenly
sprung into prominence as a millionaire
from South Africa.
Several years ago Mrs. Phillips came to
San Francisco, and in ue time acquired a
residence here and sued for a divorce.
The court heard her story and an order
was made from the bench allowing a di
vorce. The lady's attorney neglected to
have the decree signed and no judgment
roll was ever made up, owing to the care
leanness of her lawyer.
This neelect now appears to bÂ« benefi
cial to Mrs. Phillies, according to her
opinion, for she holds that the decree of
divor c was not final, and when she heard
of tier husband's Midden accession to
affluence she hired a new lawyer in the
person of P. J. Mogan, who movrd to
have the action dismissed because her
husband hud failed to enter an appear
ance and answer. â¢
Judge Seawell held that she hart a rght
to demand a dismissal of the casts and
ordered the dismissal accordingly.
Mn. Phillips' affidavit takes up the
story at this point and carries it to its
somewhat sensational continuation, the
conclusion of which will be reached, in all
probability, after all the legal processes of
the Supreme courts of California ai.d
Minnesota ftav<s been exhausted, for the
lady announces that ths scene of the con
test is snon to be trauslerred from this
State to Minnesota.
The point for which Mrs. Phillips is
pressing at the present moment is that
the ortier dismissing her action shall be
entered in the judgment book, in order
that she may be sure ihut she is still
Phillips' wife..
Touching this important matter Mrs.
Phillips says that though she left a writ
ten order directing the clerK of the court
to enter her dismissal he has failed to do
so because the Judge has forbidden him
to do so until further order of court. In
explanation of her intentions Mrs. Phil
lips says that she does not wish the case
reopened, us the defendant has not placed
himself or hia property within the juris
diction of this court, and has made no ap
-5 earance in this case except to move for
entry of the judgment roll.
A more serious phase of the controversy
has devoluped from the fact that her hus
band, Puillips, brought suit against her
for deÂ«ertion on the 4th day of last Novem
ber in Blue Eanh County, Minnesota,
which action is still pending. Sne avers
that she has determined to go to Minne
sota and tight the matter out there, pro
vided she can secure final action of the
Superior Court of this County, which will
prevent the entry of judgment declaring
her divorced. She considers herself the
aggrieved party and thinks that he should
not be nermiited to pro tit by any action
she may have heretofore taken, inasmuch
as it was not pursued to a finality.
The sole object of her husband in de
manding entry of judgment, Mrs. Phillips
says, is to deprive her of ail her rights to
the- community property, which she has
rt-ason to believe amounts to several mil
lion dollars; that she has with her in this
City a minor child, whom defendant also
wish s to deprive of support because of
her natural affection for her mother; that,
although reveling in wealth for over five
years last past, defendant has failed to
contribute anything for the support of
herself or their minor daughter.
Attorney W. H. H. Hart, representing
Phillips, says that his c:ient expects to
show that Mrs. Phillips considered her
self divorced strong enough from the fact
thftt soon after the order of divorce was
made in court, she was married to William
A. Bradford, who lived at 111 Van Ness
n venue. Bradford is now suing Mr?-.
Phillips, or Bradford, for a divorce, so
taken altogether, the lady is having her
full share of litigation, as she ha^ pending
three divorce suits, two in this City and
one in Minnesota.
The struggle for a share of what Mrs.
Phillips describes as community property
will attract wide attention. Mrs. Phillips
contends that Pniliips concealed the com
munity property from her and took it to
South Africa, where, by investing it in
gold mines and diamond tield*, he in
creased it to about $3,000,000. Phillips
does not deny that he is wealthy, but says
be was a pauper when he went to South
Africa, and that he gained his riches by
fortunate discoveries of the yellow metal
and precious stones.

in? communication to the committe ,
which was read to the convention before
adjournment was taken :
Gentlemen: Equable climate and superior
soil render Calliornia one of the most promi
nent seeU-gro'.vinsj States in the Union, but,
cutting down the cost of production to the
utmost minimum, it is found by the seed
growers of this Stnte and other States im
pract,cable to meet competition with Euro
pean-grown Bee'ds, beciuse of the fact that
foreign-grown fluid, vegetable and flower
seeds are cither admitted free or else are
charged a mereiv nominal duty.
The result is that all kinds of seeds are
hoavily imported by the seedhouses of the
United States from the small farms ot France
and Germany, operated by either pauper or
iamily labor â by the latter expression we
mean that on farm after farm, in the countries
named, the sole cultivators are the man,
woman nnd children living thereon, all of
whom turn out to work in the field, the chil
dren being given a hoe to use at the tender age
when American children are given books aud
sent to school to broaden their minds and

INTERNAL REVENUE GAIN.
Receipts of Last Tear In Advance
of the Year I're
ceding.
The annual report of the Internal Rev
enue Office in this City, which will be
completed and forwarded to Washington
in a few days, shows an increase in the re
ceipts over those of the preceding year.
For the fiscal year of. 1895 the total col
lections amounted to $2,067,872 60, and
for the year ended December, 18y6, to
12,410,019 46. This records a gain of
$342,146 86. The collections for the month
of December just clo-ed are $249,239 07,
while those of the same month in 1895
were $203,079 35, showing a monthly gain
oi $46,158 72.
Although all branches of the business
are included in tue report the gain has
been upon brandies and whiskies princi
puliy. The penalties collected for the
violation of_ tiie revenue laws have added
materially to the advance in the gross re
ceipts. Another cause of the increase is
that the district has been thoroughly har
vested. All persons subject to taxation
have ben called upon, and concerns that
have eretcfore escaped attention have
been compelled to i>av taxes.
With a gain of over $342,000 for 1896, un
der thp stress of hard times, it is thought
that 1897, under more favorable commer
cial conditions, will continue the advance
in annual receipts.

CLAIMS OF COUNSEL
FOR THE STATE
Twenty - Five Thousand
Dollars in the Rail
road Suit.
Attorneys Fay That the Charges
Made Are Very Rea
sonable.
S.veral Depositions Were Taken
Yesterday by tbe State Boird
of Examiners.
The attorneys who were specially en
gaged by the Board ol Railroad Commis
sioners to assist Attorney-General Fitz
gerald in the recent proceedings in the
United States Circnit Court have put in
their claims for services up to date. The
total amount is $2i,000. Of this amount
the Attorney-General has no share, receiv
ing only the salary of his office. The
total of $25,000, if approved by the State
Board of Examiners, will be divided be
tween Judge Robert Y. Hayne, W. \Â¥.
Foote ana J. C. Daly. The proportion
which will be received by each will be
determined by the Board of Examiners.
Mr. Daly has not been connected re
cently with the group of attorneys asso
ciated with the Attorney-General in the
contention waged with the Southern
Pacific Company concerning the matter of
rates and the powers of the Board of Rail
road Commissioners in this connection.
He was excused by the Board of Railroad
Commissioners some months ago, but be
has some share in the $25,000.
Yesterd^v afternoon Governor Budd,
Attorney-General Fitzgerald and Secre
tary of State Brown, as members of the
State Board of Examiners, met at the
Attorney-General's cffice in this City to
taKe depositions concerning the reasona
bleness of the claims ma<!e by the attor
neys. The deponents were ex-Justice
Rhoads, Jolm Garber, Captain William
Craig and Garret MeEnerney. These
gentlemen, on.> and all, expressed the
opinion that $25 000 wa< not too much for
the services performed for the State. Mr.
Garber was one of the attorneys for the
Southern Pacific Company. One of those
present joked him concerning the com
pensation he had from the big corpora
tion.
"I worked for a ooor client," was his
response to the "josh."
Robert Y. Hayne was present at this
meoting and made a statement concern
ing the amount of labor performed. W.
W. Foote did the same.
The State Board of Examiners will meet
at Sacramento Monday, and the approval
of the claims for leeal services will come
up for consideration in open session.

FEDERAL OFFICERS
JOIN THE WATCH
Flare of Light Will An
nounce Butler's Arrival
at Night.
The Corwio Mustered Into the
Plans to Catch the
Swanhilcfa.
A Honolulu Interview Which States
That the Fugitive Was and
May B3 Still There.
Additional plans for the capture of
Frank Butler, alias Harwood, the accused
Australian murderer, were made yester
day. As the time approaches for the bark
Swannilda to arrive, tbe vigilance of the
watchers will be increased- For several
days previous to the time that the bark is
expected, %vhich is about the 25th inst.,
the sea outside the heads will be studded
with lookouts, and telescopes will be
trtuned against the horizon to catch a
glimpse of the expected sail. Only thick
fog and the most unexpected luck will
giva the accused murderer any chance
whatever to escape. What the officials
fear most is a heaAy fog. A man charged
with ro many fiendish crimes will not
Btep recklessly into a new port, however
far away it may be from the scene of his
crimes.
' The police feel that he will be cautions
in landing here. Should he become
alarmed or suspicious, a heavy fog would
effectually shield him irom view should
he conclude to drop overboard and swim
to one of the many fishing-boats that are
always outside the heads. But the police
are doing all that can be accomplished to
prevent Butler's escape under any circum
stances, and "his arrest is jusi about as cer
tain as the arrival of the Swanhilda.
Captain Fraser is master of the bark, and
is noted for stretching every inch of can
vas he das aboard and getting into port
with as little delay as po^s^ble. Tne
Swanhilda has made the trip from New
castle, N. S. \V., at which port Butler
boarded her under the name of Captain
â \Yeiler, one of his victims, to San Fran
cisco in 5y days.
With a stiff breeze and favorable weather
the Swanhilda is liKely to lower this time,
and next week the police and Federal offi
cers on watch wili becin to gaze oftener
end longer out on tne sea.
Officers will be stationed at Meiegs
wharf and probably on the pilot- boats.
Two warrants nave beea issued for But
ler's arrest â one by Judge Morrow of the
United States District Court, a* stated in
The Call several days ago, and another
was sued out before Justice Cook by De
tective McHattie, one of the Newcastle
officers who has chased the accused mur
derei nearly half way around the earth.
A conference was held yesterday be
tween Detectives McHattie and Conroy,
Chic; of Police Crowley and United States
Mnrshal Baldwin. The object of this was
to avoid any conflict of authority or the
6li<:b test friction as to authority of mak
ing the arrest which might, be taken ad
vantage ot by But'er. The accused is an
English subject and there was no douDt,
about, the claim that the arrestcame prop
erly under the jurisdiction of the Federal
authorities. Tne warrant of the Federal
court had been issued on complaint of
British Consui-General Warburton. An
amicable conclusion was reached and an
arrangement made that is satisfactory to
both Marsha' Baldwin and Chief Crowley.
The United States Marshal deputized Po
lice St rgeant Bunuer to represent him and
the arrest is thus in the hands of t c Sen
Francisco authorities, united with the
power of Uncle Sam.
'Ihe revenue cutter Corwin will assist in
making the arrest. She will have steam
up and be in shape to make a quick run
outside the gate at a moment's notice.
The quarantine officers will also be on the
alert. Circumstances will alone deter
mine whether the Corwin or the quaran
tine launch will be used by the officers in
making the arrest.
Captain T. 11. Barber, agent for the San
Francisco pilots, has issued a notice to all
pilots, which amounts to an additional
precaution, ana may add a Blight pyro
tecunic effect to the arrival of the accused
iirch-liend of the Ant podes. If the Swan
hilda comes in at nignt the order directs
the pilot which picks her up to burn a
larce continuous flare of light on the star
board quarter of the bark.
This is designed to attract the attention
of the officers on Me:ggs wharf. The pilots
are also directed 10 anchor the Swanhilda
between Aicatraz Island and Meiggs
wharf, on a line with Black Point.
Detectives McHattie and Conroy are
positive that Butter is aboard the Swan
hilda. It is thought in Honolulu that
Butler was seen there, the arrival of the
Newcastle detectives there, where the
steamship Mrowera touched on her
way to Victoria, having served to rÂ«vive
interest in the many murders of which
J-Jut lnr is accused, and to produce, after
the Miowera tailed away with McHattie
and Conroy, witnesses who testify to hav
ing seen Butler there. The following
article from the Hawaiian Star of Hono
lulu of December 29 last is of interest in
this connection, and it may be barely pos
sible that the relentless accused murderer,
who has been chased half way around the
g obe, may not be aboard the trim bark
which is bending her sails this way:
That the murderer lor whose head the Aus
tralian Government offers many hundred
pounds is not aboard the Swanhilda is the
firm belief of a number of Honolulu people,
who insist that they saw the Identical man in
ih!g city less than a fortnight' ago.
On the same day or the day after the arrival
of tbe steamship Mariposa in Honolulu a man
laliying exactly with the description of the
fiendish Australian murderer called at Mrs.
Nina Gardii.er's cottage, 508 Alakea street,
just opposite the Christian church. The call
was answered by Mrs. McLean, a sister of Mrs.
Gardiner. The man inquired if he could secure
a room and he was informed that ail the rooms
were occupied. Mrs. McLean directed him to
Mrs. Levey's rooming-house, but two doors
inHuka on Alakea.
Mrs. Gardiner states that she saw the man
on ihe day that he came to her house and that
she saw him several times afterward. "I was
impressed with the man's makeup," stated
M ri. Gardiner to a Star representative. "He
had such a peculiar fp.ee and his nose was
very funny. It looked as though it was flat
on ihe bridge and had the appearance oi be
ing broken. My daughter Nina, who la 10
years old, met the mau on the walk on Alakea
street in front of Mrs. Levey's house two or
three days after his call at our house, and he
opened up a conversation with her. After In
quiring her name, the stranger asked had she
been to Australia. Receiving an affirmative
reply, the man in answer to my daughter's
queries said his name wag Butler and that he
hailed from Australia.
"The man and his strange appearance did
not enter my thoughts again until yesterday,
when Nina came running to me with her
finger on a picture of the Australian murderer
in a copy of tne Sydney Mall, fcne did not
kuow who it was, but remarked instantly that
it was a picture of the stranger whom she had
talked with but a few days previous. I noticed
the resemblance at once, so did my sister,
Mrs. McLean. We take the Sydney Mail and
my daughter opened the papers herself. Ido
believe ihnt Harwood or Butler Is or has been
in Honolulu."
Mrs. Levey was seen regarding the matter,
but she was unable to throw any light on the
subject. "I have refused a number of appli
cants for rooms during tbe past three or four
weeks, as my rooms have been all occupied.
The man may have come to me on or about the
time of ttie arrival of the Mariposa, and I
would not have noticed him particularly."
George Tietjen is the driver oi Love's bread
wagon. He states that he has seen the man
walking on the streets several times since the
arrival of the Mariposa. He readily recog
nlzes the likeness in the pictures contained in
the Sydney papers.
From Irwln & Co.. the agents of the steam
ship Mftriposa. it is learned that the Mariposa
sailed from Sydney ou November 24, reaching
Honolulu on December 9.
It is the most natural thing in the world'
that the criminal who made A. T. O. Preston,
a student in mineralogy Iv the Sydney Uni
versity, dig his own grave and struck down
Sea Captain Lee Weller with n pick while on a
prospecting tour in the Blue Mountains of
Australia would throw the Australian au
thorities oft his trail. He could come to
Hawaii and cut off all communication be
tween himself and the outside world. He
might have backtracked to China or Japan, or
have boarded a sailing vessel in Honolulu, or
more plausible yet, he may still be in Hawuii.
His description, according to a Sydney paper,
is as follows: About 40 years of age, rive feet
nine or ten inches high, stout build, muscular
appearance, dark hair slightly tinged with
gray, dark brown mustache and small side
whiskers, peculiar noseâ flat on Dridge, laree
on point and turned to left side as if it has
been broken, ratner high shoulders; dresses
well; is an Englishman.
DELAYS OF THE LAW.
Judge Kahn Says They Shall Not Occur
in ll is Court Without Cause.
Judge Bahrs had a few remarks to offer
yesterday when an attorney presented an
application to have one of nis cases re
stored to the calendar, it having been
stricken off for want of proper diligence
on the part of the litigants and their law
yers. He thought there ought not to be
unreasonable delays in litigation.
"I had a general calendar of this court
called last Wednesday," said tne Judge,
"and directed the clerk to drop all cases
that were not answered ready, or in which
no proceedings had been had within a
reasonable length of time. The calendar
contained 150 cases, of which only about
25 elicited any 'response, thouch due notice
bad been given to all interested parties.
"It is neither proper nor fair to the
court to have the calendar cumbered with
dead timber, and the order will be to
strike off cases where there ia no disposi
tion manifested for active litigation.
When the parties are prepared to go ahead
the cases may be restored upon proper
notice and motion."
Other Judges have taken a course simi
lar to that indicated by Judge Bahrs, and
it is expected that the heavy calendars of
the different departments of the Superior
Court will speedily be relieved on account
of the increased activity on the .part cf the
lawyers.
In this line are the recent amendments
to the rules of the Superior Court. One
startling innovation provides that "when
it appears that a demurrer is frivolous
and was interposed for delay" the court
may compel the payment of $20 as costs to
the adverse party as a consideration of
leave to answer.
Lawyers who ought to know what they
are talking about intimate that this rule
will never be enforced, as it has come to
be regarded as a fatal error for a San Fran
cisco lawyer to file an answer before ne
has put in a demurrer. The trouble about
this rule is that it only says the court
''may" impose the payment of $20 costs.
It may not also, anl probably will not.
Another rule, howevor, which is in
tended to accelerate the movements of the
judicial macnine is more happily worded,
as it explicitly takes from Judges of the
Superior Court tne power rb grant to at
torneys extensions of time beyond thirty
oays without the consent of tbe opposing
party.

The New Board of .Education Muit
Be Careful of It* Ex
penses.
Auditor Broderick will notify the Baard
of Education to-morrow that unlesÂ» it is
careful with the fluids during the next six
months a deficit will occur before the end
of the fiscal year.
Since the old board went oat of exist
ence it has been figured that the outstand
ing bills against the funds, contracted
previous to the present board coming into
power, aggregate $18, COO âin other words
that the old board contracted $18.000 more
in bills during December than it had a
rieht to do under the one twelfth act.
The amount available for January is
about $83,000, ana the salaiies of teachers
will take $72,000 of this, so that if they are
paid there will be but $11,000 to meet the
overdraft and the expenses of the main
tenance of the department until Janu
ary 31.
Auditor Broderick does not intend to
allow tue teachers to wait for their pay,
and there will be waiiing and gnashing of
teeth among the contractors. To be *vie
that there will be money for the teachers
on pay day Mr. Br..denck is holding tem
porarily a lot of bills aggregating sevorcl
thousand dollars that have recently been
placed in his hands.
Auditor Broderick said yesterday:
"Some one is going to lose money on these
contracts if care is not taken to nurse the
funds. Should the new board choo*e to
repudiate the contracts the contractors
will be able to fall back on the members
of the old board and lheir bondsmen, for
the contracts were made under their ad
ministration and they are responsible."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
HAVE ORDERED
MORE RAW JUTE
Prison Directors Want to
Keep the Bag Mill
Running.
Expert Wadhams' Report of the
San Quentin Books and
Accounts.
To Close the Ccunty Road From Run
ning Through the State's Property.
Convicts' Credits.
At tbe meeting of the Board of State
Prison Directors, at San Quentin yester
day, R. M. Fitzgerald was re-elected
president, of the board for the ensuing
year. The most important business trans
acted related to the purchase of jute Jor
the two last months in the year and the
supply of grain bags on hand.
Warden W. E. Hale, in his statement of
the condition of jute, mill, bags, etc., re
ported ai follows: Grain bags on hand,
3,035,500; sold, awaiting shipment, 16,000;
on hand available for sale, 3,069,500; num
ber of sugar bags sold, 1,216.900; sugar
bags shipped, 672,900; sugar bags awaiting
shipment, 544,000; on hand, 210, 000^ to be
manufactured to rill orders, 334,000. Raw
jute on hand in warehouse, I^ ( J4 balfs;
contracted for to arrive, 4500 bales; (of
this 1000 bales have recently arrived).
This quantity will run the mills until
about August 15, and it will require about
3000 bales more 10 keep the mill going
until December 15.
As this condition of affairs wa? known
before the board had advertised for bids
for raw jute from August 15 last to to the
end of tne year four firms bid for the con
tract, and their figures ran from 2.95 cents
per pound to 3.43 cents. The last figure
was probably a mistake in the cablegram
received by the bidder. Th 9 directors ac
cepted the bid of R. J. Woods & Co., who
offered 1000 balea at 2.95 cents, 1000 bales
at 2.99)4 cents and 1000 bales at 295 cents.
The lauer offer was conditional, awaiting
confirmation from Calcutta. Although
the offer was an oild one, the agent said
that he had presented it as it was received.
The directors accepted his bid for the two
lots of 1000 bales at 2 95. Most of this jnte
will have to come by steamer, as tailing
vessels would not reach this port in time
to land their cargoes beiore the mill would
rtn out of material. At. present tne mill
is consuming jute at the rate of 100 bales
a day.
L. WadhamÃ, the expert accountant, who
has been examining the prison books,
which is the custom at the end of every
year, presented the following satisfactory
report:
To the President and Board of Directors of the

San Quentiu, January 8, 1897.
Warden Hale called attention to the
fact that the commissary department is
having great trouble with the meat con
tractors, Schweitzer & Go. of San Fran
,Cisco, who are sending the prison all kinds
ot stuff instead of what the contract calls |
for. Certain cuts and pieces of stated
quality are specified in the agreement,
ln-tead of this the contractors send to the
prison chunks of old cows, bunks of work
oxen and anything that wears hide and
hoofs, so the garden stated. This he
said causes great annoyance, particularly
to the families of the officers of the prison,
who secure their supplies from the com
missary department. The Warden was
instructed, when the contractor sends over
any more such provision, to return the
same to San Francisco and purchase the
necessary meat supply from the San Ra
fael markets and charge it to the con
tractors.
Several convicts appeared before the
board and asked that their credits that
had been forfeited by bad behavior be re
stored. "Patsy" Williams lost his credits
for taking opium into the prison. He was
half-witted at the time and soon after be
came crazy. Williams' credits were re
stored. He has since recovered his mind.
The offense of "Duichy" Baker was of a
similar nature, but as he was an old-timer
the board refused to grant the request.
Thomas Murray while at Folsom many
yea.rs ago made an attemt to escape and
he lost all his credits. The prison officers
stated that for the past five years the con
vict had been most uselul, obedient and
industrious. As a reward six months'
credits out of two years lost were restored.
The recent experience of the prison
officials with tho-e who made a business
of smuggling opium inside of the prison
walls made the board decide to take
further action to shut off the annoyance.
For the past few years two convicts named
Wagner and Nottingham had been serv
ing as trusties to look after the gardens
surrounding the Warden's and officers'
I houses on the hill. A short time ago it
was found out that they had betrayed
their trust and were smuggling opium
in to the prisoners. In fact the drng had
been cached by them in several places in
the gardens and the officers' houses. Of
course the convicts were punished by be
ing deprived of all time credits for good
behavior allowed by law, and were sent to
the jute mill to perform hard labor.
The Warden stated that the opium had
been brought into the prison grounds by
persons coming in on the county road,
which practically runs through the prison
grounds over the hill past the officers' resi
dences.
In order to exercise more control over
that part of the State's property the War
den suggested that the roadway con
nected with the county road be closed to
the public and the Supervisors of Marin
County be notified to use the old road
nurtii of the State's property in traveling

BEVENTH AVENUE ROAD.
Captain Tattle Hu Finished the First
Section of His Contract.
The extension of Seventh avenue south
of Golden Gate Park leading to the AlmÃ
house and lngleside has been completed
as far as L street
The filling in of this the first section had
been let to Captain John Tuttle some
months ago, and the work has been prose
cuted with unabated vigor until the road
wayâor rather the intended boulevard
has been lengthened by the grading of the
two blocks from J to L streets.
This section involved the removal of a
small sized mountain of sand which wa9
dumped into the ravine on the line of the
boulevard.
The second section, which will involve
the filling in of the Bpring Valley Water
Company's pond, will be commenced in
the near future. This will bring the road
way as far as Lake Honda.
When this is done there will be a
straight driveway from the park along
Seventh avenue direct to lngleside and
the ocean beach road, making it one of
the prettiest and most pleasant drives in
or about San Francisco.

DETECTIVES ASK
TO BE LICENSED
Many Agencies Declare the
City Full of Black
mailers.
Their Principal Demand Is for
a Law Requiring a Good
Eond.
There is a great deal of interest among
private detectives of the State over a bill
now pencing in the Legislature, the pur
poses of which are to regulate the detec
tives of this State.
The bill provides that private detectives
must hereafter pay a license of $300 a year,
without which it shall be unlawful for
them to do detective work.
Opinions differ in local detective circles
as to the justice and feasibility of the
measure.
Speaking of the matter last night a
well-known local Sleuth, who objected to
being quoted, said: "It is simply a
scheme of the Pinkertons and big guns to
swallow the little fishes, so they will have
such a monopoly that they can charge
their own rates. It is a wrong to every
smali operator, and the tax is so high
t at it will practically bar some men out
of the business entirely. Why, in these
times $25 a month, the proposed license,
would seep a family alive in case of neces
sity."
Detective McFarlane echoed practically
the same sentiments. He believed a bond
would be better, however, than a high
license.
Harry Morse believes in the bill, but he
thinks there ought also to be a stringent
provision about Donds and tcood character.
"The City is overrun with desperate
wretches wtio call themselves detectives,"
he said. "They prey on the people and
thrive by blackmailing. It is these
creatures that we desire to drive from the
face of the earth ; but a $300 license would
not do it. They can pay s>uch licenses all
right, but they could not give bonds and
fnrnish certificates of character.
"I have drafted an amendment which
lays stress on the bond feature, as I under
stand there is no bond requirement in the
new law."' â¢
Captain Curtin of the Curtin Agency
thinks tne $300 license is exorbitant and
probably unconstitutional. He believe*
in the old Dargie bill, which provided for
$100 and bonds.
"We want to eet rid of ex-convicts and
like scoundrels who have the gall to call
themselves detectives," he said "and 1
have more faith in the bond feature than
in the license, because rascals can pay
licenses. It ought to be that they are
made responsible in damages for crooked
work."
Detective Stilwell agreed substantially
with the foregoing, Eaying : "The law is a
good one and ought to paÂ»s. Everything
possible ought to be done to rid the busi
ness of its curbstone crooks and maintain
men of character in the btwiness."
Detective Lucas agreed with Detective
Btilwell. He thought it a good idea to
have none but responsible men of char
acter and standing in the business.
it la probable that the Dargie bill of
1891 may De substituted for the one now
up. That measure gives license collectors
great powers.
Every detective is also required to eive
bonds in the sum of $2000 for the faithful
and legal performance of duty.
If hall the blackmailing is going on that
is reported by respectable agencies in this
Uty somebody Is paying a large sum of
money each year to men without con
sciences who prey upon their fellow-men
under the guise of detectives.

OWII 111I II 0 STORE.THE FIRST LOSES
ITS COMMANDER
Colonel William Macdonald
Tenders His Resignation
to Gen. Warfieid.
Hs Says That Business Will Not
Permit Him to Attend to
the Command.
Speculation as to Who Will Succeed
the Rstiring O.ficer- One Who Is
in the Line of Promotion.
Colonel William Macdonald, command
ing the First Infantry, Second Brigade,
N. G. C, baa tired of military life and
yesterday morning sent his resignation to
Brigadier-General R. H. Warfieid, who in
turn will transmit it to Commander-in-
Chief James H. Budd, when it will be
acted upon, and no doubt it will be ac
cepted, as the colonel has for some time
contemplated the action taken, assigning
that his business engagements would not
permit him to give to the command the
time required.
For some time past it had been known
by the officers of the guard that the
colonel intended to retire, but the matter
was kept a "dead secret" until yesterday
morning, when the fact became known,
and no sooner was It m9de known than
the talk turned upon who will be his pos
sible successor.
The brigadier - general, when asked
about the matter, adopted the Yankee
method of meeting a question by asking
Colonel William Macdonald*
another, saying, "Has he resigned?"
Being assured that such was a fact, he
then asked, "What in Halifax did he
want to resign for?" but not receiving an
answer, he remarked that as the resigna
tion had been sent in, Lieutenant-Colonel
Victor D. Daboce i?, by reason of his rank,
in line of promotion, and then added that
there is no telling who will be the man to
command toe First Infantry.
Colonel Macdonald, who is manager of
a prominent insurance company of this
City, has been connected with the Na
tional Guard of this State since 1878. The
record of his service is as follows: Pri
vate Company F, Second Infantry (artil-
Jery), April 3, 1878; corporal Company tP,
Second Artillery, November 3, 1880; cap
tain and ad-de-camp Second Brigade,
November 23, 1880, to January 31, 1882;
private of Light Battery A, Second Artil
lery, February 1, 1882; corporal Battery
A, Second Artillery, May 1, 1882; second
lieutenant Battery A. Junt 26, 1882; first
lieutenant Battery A, 8eco?:d Artillery,
February 20, 1883; lieutenant-colonel Sec
ond Artillery, October 20. 1887; colonel of
the Second Artillery, May 23, 1889. This
last-named position he held until the re
cent reorganization of the guard, and on
the 4th of last January he was chosen
colonel of the First Infantry, Second
Brieade.
In the several positions in the guard
filled by Colonel Macdonald he always
proved a conscientious man, whether in
the ranks or in command, and as an offi
cer he won tne eaieem of nearly every
man of his command and of his superiors.
Should Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce suc
ceed io the command of the reeiment it is
likely that Major Charts Buxton, whose
connection witu the truard dates lrom
April 4, 1834, when he joined as a private
of Battery C, Second Artillery, will be
promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy,
but that is only the talk of the street, as
there are others who would like to wear
the silver leaves on their shoulder-straps.
Colonel Macdonald in a communication
to the lieutenant-colonel, in which he an
nounced his determination to part with
his command, pays him a high compli
ment for the manner he controlled the
affairs of the First when he was in tem
porary command. For several days prior
to yesterday Colonel Macdonald spent
many hours in the office of the adjutant
general at Sacramento. Yesterday he left
for the East to be absent for some time, as
it was announced in The Call last Mon
day that he would.

known newspaper writer, who died in this

The Disabled American Bark Fresno Being Towed Into Port by
the Spreckels Tog Fearless, The Fresno Was Caught in a
Typhoon, and While Her Rudder Was Disabled She Went
on Her Beam Ends. Captain Underwood Never Expected
to See Land Again, and When the Water Began to Get
- Through the Hatch Into the Hold He Told His Crew the
Vessel Could Not Last Fifteen Minutes. A Change in
Course Righted the Bark and She Was Got Before the Wind*
NEARLY WRECKED
IN MIDOCEAN
The American Bark Fresno
Caught in a Heavy-
Typhoon.
On Her Beam Ends for Hours.
The Captain and Crew Got
Ready to Die.
Her Rudder Broken, and Water Getting
Into the Hold Ail Hope
Seemed Gone.
The American bark Fresno from Kobe,
Japan, for Puget Sound in ballast, bad a
terrible time of it during the thirty-five
days' run and was compelled to put in
here yesterday in distress for repairs.
She was caught in a typhoon and carried
j away the foreyard, topsailyard, and port
rail. Almost all the saih were blown
from the bolt ropes and the rudder
gudgeon carried away, leaving the vessel
unmanageable. She was thrown on her
beam ends and the water covered the lee
side of the hatches. Everybody on boarct
thought the vessel was goinz down and
many of the crew said their last prayer
on earth.
The water began to leak through the
strained deck into the hold and the
Fresno D6gan to settle. The master warned
tlie crew that they had not fifteen minutes
to live and all gave up hope. There was
a momentary change in the weather and
the gale struck the bark from a fresh quar
ter aud put her on an even keel. After
some clever maneuvering she was got be
fore the wind, unmanageable, but still a
safer refuge than she had been ten minutes
before.
When the lull came the men went to
work to rig a jury rudder. While 'he
spanker boom was oeing prepared a flash
of lightning shivered the mainyard and
several of the men had a narrow escape.
After many difficulties the jury rudder
was finally fixed, and the Fresno worked
her way through a succession of gales to
San Francisco. After striking the typhoon
on December 12 she leaked continuously
an inch an hour, and every day the men
had to take a trick at the pumps in order
to k*ep her clear.
"I have been thirty years at sea." said
Captain Underwood yesterday, "and I
never ran into anything in the shape of a
gale that could equal that typhoon in
Jury. The thermometer fell to 28.65, and
as I have never used the telltale since it
is there to tell its own story.
"We left Kobe on December 5 in ballast.
From the iirst day out we had nothing
but heavy weather, ana on December 12,
in latitude 37 north, longitude IC2 east,
we ran into it. Sail after sail was blown
away, the deck-* were full of water and
everything movable was dashing from
side to side, mak>ng it <iangerou4 for the
men to move around. The cabin and fore
castle were flooded, and when the vessel
went on her beam ends I thought our last
hour had come. 1 never expected that
tbe vessel would last fifteen minutes, but
just in t he nick of time there was a change
and I was able to gei her before the wind.
''With a disabled rudder and the bark
leaking, we were in a predicament. I
ordered tbe men to unship the spanker
boom, and while they were doing that I
bad the carpenter fix up some heavy tim
ters in the shape of a fan. It was the
upper eudgeon (the metal eye or socket
attached to the st<Â»mpost to receive the
pintle of the rudder), so to the upper part
of the rudder I fixed the fan and then
connected it with the spanker boom by
means of ropes and pulleys. The boom
had in the meantime been securely fas
tened to the deck and the fan fastened as
tightly to the hull as the circumstances
would allow. It was while this work was
being done that the lightning shivered our
mainyard into splinters.
"With this contrivance I found we
could steer fairly well in comparatively
rough weather, but when the blow was a
bard one we Had to run before it, as the
rudder threatened at times to tear the
stern out of tbe ship. The only time we
had anything like fair weather was dur
ing the last three days when we were off
San Francisco. A little south ot Point
Keyas I sighted the tug Fearless and at
ouce signaled that I wanted a tow. Cap
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
tain Randall brought us into port and our
troubles are over. The men are worn out
with hard work and exposure and I cuar
antee that not one of them will ever for
get the hour when we were all momen
tarily expecting to go to the bottom."
The Fresno will be thoroughly over
hauled here and will then proceed on her
way to Puget Sound to load lumber for
Pope & Talbot, her owners.
THEEATENED SUICIDE.
Mrs. Bueter Made a Scene in Secretary
Welch's Office.
An undersized, rather uninteresting
looking German woman went into the
office of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children late Friday afternoon
and sat some time waiting her turn to be
heard. She had with her two little chil
dren, whose cheeKs were as red as roses
and who seemad to be the embodiment of
lusty good health and prime animal spir
its. They were full of fun and played
about the rooms with the usual vitality of
healthy children.
When the mother of the children had
her tura to talk with Secretar} Welch she
made known her name and business. She
wanted aid, and said that her children
were respectively aged 2 and 3 years.
Secretary Welch telephoned to Mrs. Flint,
at the office oi the Associated Charities, to
inquire concerning the woman, who said
tliut hpr name was Mrs. Bueter; that she
lived at 272 Stevenson street, and that her
husband was in Germany, having left her.
Mrs. Fiint telephoned thest Mrs. Bueter
had been in the habit of securing help
from charitable orcanizatious, and that
she had declined to honor en order for aid
brought in by Mrs. Bueter on this giound.
Mr 1 -. liueter overheard some ot the talk
and also heard a suggestion made by some
one that her children should be taken
from her. At this she became wildly ex
cited. She shrieked and prayed, and the
police ambulance was sent for. Mrs. Bueier
ran to a window in the effico, which is on
the fifth floor, and threatened to throw
herseif out. She also iried to escape from
the office by the door. She threatened to
Kill her children and herself rather tban
that they should be separated.
She was taken away by the police and a
charge was made against her of cruelty to
children. At the Central station she said
that her namo was Mrs. Gratz Bue'er.
Her two little children were placed in the
care of the Boys' and Girls' Aid Soc cty.
Secretary Welch said yesterday that the
acts of Mrs. Bueter in drageing her chil
dren around to charitable societies were
cruel, and the charge was based upon that.
HELD UP AND ROBBED,
William T. Garms, the Brewer,
Loses His Gold Watch
and Chain.
He Was on His Way Home in a Hack
From the Schu tzen Verein
Ball.
William T. Garms, vice-president of
the Milwaukee Brewery, was the central
figure in an adventure early Friday morn
ing, and he has enjoined all his friends to
say nothing about it on pain of forfeiting
his friendship forever.
He is a prominent momber of the San
Francisco Schuetzen Verein and attended
the annual ball of the society at Califor
nia Hall, Bush street, Thursday night.
He is a favorite with tho other members,
and as usual he spent his money liberally
and his name was on everybody's lips.
Â±Ie lives at 403 Eleventh street, and in
the early hours of the mornirg he started
for home in a hack. When the driver
reached Market and Eleventh streets a
man hailed the driver and asked him to
stop.
"What do you want?" asked the driver,
as he pulled up.
"I want to speak to Garms," said the
man, as he advanced to the hack. The
miin opened the door, and before Garms
had time to ask what he wanted the man
grabbed hold of his chain and jerked his
gold watch out of his pocket, disappearing
with the watch and chain.
Before Garms had recovered from his
astonishment and notified the driver the
thief was nowhere to be seen, ann Garms
gave the order to drive home. Yesterday
he bsught a new gold watch and chain lor
$150, and it was in trying to explain to his
lriends why he bad occasion to make tbe
new purchase that the story leaked out.
Garms is under the impression that
some one at the ball, not a member of the
society, had seen him spending his money
lreely and knowing where he lived had
watched for him with the intention of
robbing him.

THE Internal diseases are more com-
INTPPNAI mon than generally supposed. . They
irNIcKiNAL* are often chronic in character, and
ORGANS. sometimes many months, or even
' . years, in developing. Although ex-
tremely serious, they are not always accompanied with acute
pains. They are usually of an insidious nature. Hence they
silently steal upon you, and have you bound captive before you
are really aware of your condition. .
,- The Heart is the grand vital organ of the human sys-
tem. When disordered or diseased it is usually subject to
irregular, weak or violent palpitation, valvular lesions, short-
ness of breath, aches or rheumatic pains. Any of these or
similar symptoms imperil life, and when once manifested the
warning alarm has been sounded. .. .77? ;
The liiiiiifs are all-important, and when unsound the
sufferer may ue bothered with chest pains, coughs, colds,
asthma or hemorrhages, which are forerunners of. pulmonar y
consumption. r .
The JLiver and Stomach are health barometers.
By them, more than by any other organs, the state of the
general health may be determined. If you have constipation,
headaches, dizziness, biliousness, coated tongue, yellow skin,
yellow in whites of eyes, bad taste in mouth of mornings, loss
of appetite, dyspepsia, heartburn, dropsy or fullness after eat-
ing you may be sure that your liver and stomach are in a
diseased condition.
The Kidneys are often afflicted . with inflammation,
congestion, diabetes or Bright's disease, which are among the
most dangerous maladies that human flesh is heir to.
The . Bladder and Urinary organs are closely
allied, and when one is ailing the others are very apt to
'be. Cystitis, caiarrhal inflammation, gall stones, stricture, J
muscular paralysis, inability to retain urine, frequent, painful
urination, or the passing of milky or bloody urine are the usual I
symDtoruH.
In the treatment of all these internal diseases of the Heart,
LungÃ, Liver, Stomach, Kidneys, Bladder and Urinary organs,
DOCTOR COOK has proven himself to be beyond the shadow
of a question the leading and most successful specialist in the
United States to-day.

CHRONIC Few diseases are to be more dreaded
A a DPH than Catarrh. . That continual hawk-
CAIAKKtI ing, spitting, ana sneezing are un-
CURED. comfortable to you and disgusting to
those around you. Catarrh impairs
the hearing and robs the voice of its every charm. It brings on
frequent headaches. It produces soreness of the throat, irrita-
tion of the bronchial tubes, dyspepsia and loss of appetite. It
poisons the blood, befouls the breath, stomach and lungs, and
paves the way for consumption. Do not seek a fe*r moments'
relief by taking some cheap patent nostrum, but secure a lasting
euro by taking DOCTOR COOK'S celebrated treatment.

RHEUMATISM Whether acute, chronic, inflam-

AINU 11 0 Jar) Rheumatism is one of the most
REMEDY. . painful diseases that afflict the hu.
man body. More than that, it often
goes to the heart and proves fatal. So long as the germs re-
main in the system the disease is bound to return at intervals.
Just when you desire most to be free from all physical annoy-
ances, in order to discharge important business obligations or
to enjoy a season of rest and , recreation, you are suddenly
stricken down and driven almost to distraction by excruciating
pains. DOCTOR COOK treats every form of Rheumatism with
unsurpassed skill and success.

a Mr* its â  DOCTOR COOK uses no knife or
AINU 113 . ligature. He has a new, safe and

to no other physician , in . the West,
and which invariably produces the most gratifying results. It
causes the Rupture to heal as a broken bone unites.

PILES Although seldom fatal, Piles are
AIVJf I very /painful. They may be internal
AINU or external, blind, bleeding, itching
FISTULA. or protruding. ; They usually result
from constipation or violent efforts at
stool. If not properly attended to, they often produce fistula
and carbuncles about the rectum. , Hundreds of remedies will
give you temporary relief, but DOCTOR COOK will give you a
permanent cure. ,

BLOOD No one can hope for good health so
Â_. long as his or her blood is in a disor-
AINU dered condition. Bad blood produces
tSKIN. ',:'. , a ; multitude ?" of diseases. Among
them are abscesses, cancers, - carbun-
cles, eczema, erysipelas, piles, pimples, rheumatism, scrofula,
tumors and ulcers. A special course of DOCTOR COOK'S
scientific treatment will completely: expel all impurities of the
system, and fill the veins with rich, red blood, which ; insures
freedom from skin diseases and soundness of general health.

into the blood and bones, and* finally" becomes almost as terrible
in its secondary and tertiary stages as leprosy itself.' Many
physicians suppress Syphilis for the time being wita mercurial
poisonsâ with that damnable curse from which; your children
as \ well ias ; yourself \ will suffer; but without injurious drugs
DOCTOR COOK completely and forever eradicates every symp-
tom, taint and trace of the disease, and leaves the system in a
pure a n.l healthful state.

self-abuse, but it not infrequently results from blows, falls,
strains, excessive horseback or bicycle riding. Thesa are also
causes of Hydrocele (a watery formation in the scrotum). For
both Varicocele ana Hydrocele DOCTOR COOK has a new
method of treatment, an unfailing cure, without resorting , ex-

LOST Many men become sexually weak
MAIMHnnn early in life, or at least prior to old
irIArNnUUU age. Some because of dissipation or
RESTORED. high living. Some because of worri-
ment over bad crops, business re-
verses or financial failures. Some because of marital excesses.
But by far tha larger portion of those who are prematurely
weak, debilitated or impotent in their sexu&l organs, have be-
come so through early habits of indiscretion.
These causes are responsible, especially the latter one, for
what is commonly called l\o*t Manhood, which may be
conveniently divided into three stages, as follows:
First Stage: The main trouble is involuntary night emis-
sions, which are usually accompanied by lewd dreams. They
are a terrible drain upon the system. They rob the blood of
its richness and often produce pimples, eruptions, dark rings
under the eyes ana like symptoms.
Second Stage: The victim now has emissions, often with-
out dreams. . He shuns â¢' his friends and avoids society.
He is often subject to nervousness, headaches, weak back, dys-
pepsia, low spirits, loss of memory, confusion of ideas and lack
.of energy, ambition and self-confidence.
Third Stage: 'â¢ The emissions are less frequent, because less
semen is secreted. Although the general health may be good,
the sexual strength is failing. In time all power is lost The
pleasures of conjugal union, or the transmission of life to pos-
terity, is only an empty dream. The poor victim has lost his
grip on life. Every cherished ambition is dead. The world
grows dark to him, and finally a suicide's grave or the walls of
a madhouse open to receive him. Such has been the sad end-
ing of many a once ambitious life. _ i 1;
To every Young, Middle-aged and Old man, whose sexual
system has become thus impaired, DOCTOR COOK offers a
skillful, helping hand. He has had more experience in the
treatment 1 of such diseases, and has cured more of them, than
any other specialist on the American Continent. Apply to him
for help and he will restore to you what you have lostâ YOUR
PRECIOUS MANHOOD. He will make out of you a tower of
physical, mental and sexual strength. He will fit you for
pleasure, study, business and marriage, and send you nut into
the world with life anew.

POPULISTS NEARLY
COME TO BLOWS
J. H. Tingman Morally
Exonerated From J. C.
Gore's Charges.
"3oss" Haskell Narrowly Avoids
Getting Into Fistic
Fracases.
Much Trouble Over the Campaign
Tentâ Stormy Sailing for
the Party Craft
The Populist bark has struck on the
reef of discord, and struck hard. It re
mains now to be seen if '"Boss" Haskell's
Napoleonic ability can extricate her from
a very unpleasant predicament.
Last night's session of the County Com
mittee nearly resulted in a fracas between
Haskell and John C. Gore and between
Haskell and J. D. Spencar, in the lie
being freely given by numerous members
and threats of a civil suit.
J. M. Reynolds, who tied Dr. W. N.
Griswold for membership on the execu
tive committee at the last meeting, with
drew in the latter's favor. Dr. Griswold
was then elected by acclamation.
The report of the execntive committee
was then read. It showed that at the in
ception of the last campaign the party
was $700 in debt for the cempaign of 1894,
but that it was now free from debt and
had a small sum in the treasury. The re
port was adopted.
The report of the auditing committee
showed that Various sums, ranging from
$120 to 60 cents, making a total of $2019 60,
luni been paid in to the campaign lund.by
candidates, and that $Jo.*9 65 had been
paid out. Other receipts were such that a
balance remained of $64 45. It was
adopted.
Then John C. Gore sprung what he sup
posed would be a surprise into the assem
blage by asking an explanation of an item
of $130 disbursed to J. H. Tingman for
pun payment ol expenses incurred during
the campaign. It was expected, however,
and nobody was injured.
Dr. GeorgÂ« W. I)aywalt, the chairman
of the purity committee, who was present
only to hand in a report, stated mat Mr.
Tingman volunteered to get the tent for
meetings during the campaign, that it
Â» ost $259 55, and that it sold for only $65,
having been badly injured. Accordingly
Tingman was out of pocicet about $195,
and it was tnought best to reimburse nini
in {art. The action had not been taken
without the sanction of the campaign
committee.
Dr. Adam moved that the County Com
mit lee disapprove the action of the cam
paign committee. Gore seconded tnis,
and then a fast and furious debate fol
lowed.
During; the heated discussion Dr. Day
wait accused Dr. Adam of having been
made a eatspaw by Gore; Haskell declared
ihat ne thought the tent tÂ»s to have been
"donated, free, gratis, for nothing." but
believed Tingman deserved the money;
Gore accuse 1 Tingman of having
asked him in advance about Keeping
the money out for tne tent and was given
the lie; Porter accused Gore of having
been present before the act was done and
of having made no objection ; Gore stum
bled and roplied that he had made a
motion to investigate something which
there was no time ior investigating; and
beiliam generally prevailed.
Chairman Lewis quieteJ things long
enough to Â«tate that ii the campaign com
mittee had sanctioned the payment it
could not have been illegal, when Gore
Hew off on a tangent and yelled that
Haskell, with eulogistic wording, had
nominated him for treasurer and then
caucused against him. Haskell chuckled
and admitted having taken him off the
"slate."
Gore then requested to be permitted to
read that part ot his report bearing on the
question at issue. He was permitted to
do so, but made charges that brought
many frantic interruptions from Haskell
and severe condemnation from others.
He made a certain reference to Haskell
that at the close of tue report brought
him to his feet with the words that Gore
was a "damnable liar," and could not
prove them.
Gore refused to give the name of his in
formant, on the plea of poor memory, and
the chairman's decisive hammering pre
vented what might have been a fistic en
counter.
John D. Spencer got into a dispute with
Haskell over one part of the report, which
accused Haskell of taking cr?dit ol a small
sum paid by the Thirty-first District for
himself, and walked across the floor to
betid over and shout nis words in Has
kell's face. Spencer afterward came to
bee things as HaÂ«kell did, that it was a
different transaction from the one named
in the report.
J. A. Johnson thought it ridiculous to
pay Tingman as regards the tent proposi
tion, but thought he deserved the money
and would vote to uphold the committee's
action.
Carlton H. Johnson accused Gore of
being the cause of the whole strife and
wanted Tingman justified by the vote to
be taken. His words with "reference to
Gore brought the latter to his feet ana a
hot rally followed, but the chairman
forced Gore to sit down and let Johnson
proceed.
Mr. Street managed finally to move that
Dr. Adams' motion be amended to "ap
prove" instead of "disapprove" the action
of the committee in allowing Tingman
$130. It was put to a vote and carried,
every man voting in the affirmative ex
cept Gore. The report was adopted as
amended. Chairman Lewis explained
th:it the action of the committee thus re
ceived was not legal but moral support.
(iore then read his report as financial
secretary. It was not received, but re.
ferred to a committee composed of J. A.
Anthony, Dr. W. N. (iri^wold and J. A.
JohnEOn for investigation.
By resolution Gore was requested to
turn over all books in his possession to
the new financial secretary immediately.
He objected, saying that certain commit
tees should first be consulted. The mo
tion was put, however, snd carried unani
mously, all voting except Gore himself.
The committee adjourned till the first
Saturday evening in February.
DIME SAVINGS BANK TO CLOSE.
Oldest Institution of Us Kind in Chicago
Will Probably Go Out of Exist
ence Shortly.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 9.â According to a
morning paper the Dime Savings Bank,
with its 14,000 depositors, the oldest ex
clusive savings bunk in Chicago, doubt
less will go out of existence before the
expiration of the ninety-day notice which
has been required on deposits since the
suspension of tiie Atlas National Bank.
Edwin Waiker, the attorney represent
ing the stockholders and directors, said
yesterday that only two things were ab
solutely certain about the Dime Savings
Bant. The first was that depositors
would not Jose a dollar in the institution.
The second was that it would not be con
tinued as it had been.
"There are two sets of negotiations now
under way for tne sale of the bank," lie
said, "and by the time I return from
Washington next week one of them may
be in shape for definite action. Of course,
the prospective purchasers vrant the best
bargain pos-iblfi. Ii the offers are not
raised it is likely that some of the direc
tors will underwrite the deal'on their own
account in order to escape the heavy sac
rilice they will be called upon to make if
that offer should be accepted. It is just
possible that the institution will be wholly
reorgauizfd and continued."
At the bank, 104 Washington street, lit
tle money is bema: paid out on account, of
the ninety-day notice required before de
posits can be withdrawn." The rule is re
laxed only to people who are in sore need
ol their money. Deposits have dropped
to almost nothing. It is suid that the
bank has a reserve fund of 25 per cent of
its deposits, but while the other savings
banks have removed the ninety-day
notice, it has not been thought advisable
to do so at tbe Dime Savings Bank on ac
count of the impending change in its
affairs.
The institution which seemi destined
soon to pass out of existence was organ
ized in 1869 as the Bank of Cairo. Three
years later it was removed to Chicago and
renamed the Dime Saving* Bank. It has
remained continuously in business here
ever since.

HAY MEN MAKE MERRY
Third Annual Banquet of Their
Flourishing Associa
tion.
A Joyous Evening of Feasting and
Toast-Making at Delmonico's
Restaurant.
The third annual banquet of the San
Francisco Hay Association, which was
held at Delmonico's last evening, was a
decided success. Such V7as the verdict of
the ninety or more guests who sat down
to the table, and an elaborate menu and
well selected programme of toasts and
musical numbers gave ample grounds for
their findings.
Previous to the banquet .a business meet
ing of the association was held at which
the following officers were elected for the
ensuing year: President, John McCord ;
vice-president, John Barg; secretary, Jo
seph Magner; directorsâ Simon An
spacher, G. P. Morrow and S. Lander.
The banquet tables were tasiefully and
appropriately decorated with grasses and
cereals. During the discussion of the
menu a number of toasts were merrily re
sponded to. Harvey C. Summer', who
has officiated as president of me associa
tion during the past year, which has been
one of marked success to the organiza
tion, acted as toastmaster.
A. Gerberding, president of the San
Francisco Produce Exctiunge, spoke of the
inendly relations wnich have always ex
lsied between the organisation which he
represented and tlie bay dealers and ciosed
with the hope that the fraternal feeling
which has hitherto existed might grow
stronger as time passed.
H. C. Ellis, late president of the Hay
Association, responded.
He congratulated the association on the
fine body of men wnich they had been
ab e to get together, and advised them
that during the ensuing year some method
be devised by which both producers and
commissioners could realize greater profits.
Messrs. Barg and Kleen, members of the
association, rendered a vocal duet, which
commanded an encore.
Frank Dalton of Dalton Bros, delivered
a humorous address upon the "Farm
Products of California," afer which J. L.
Vermeil favored the banqueters with a
vocal selection.
Simon Anspacher delivered an original
poem repJete with clever hits upon the
members present. The points were all
recognized immediately aud were greeted
with roars of laughter.
Pt. P. Lathrop of Hollister told why the
interests of the farmer ami the hay mer
chant are identical. Mr. Lathrop" is the
largest hay warehouse man in the State,
handling this year some 30,000 tons of
hay.
He has studied the business closely, and
is recognized as one of the ablest ware
house men in the State. Mr. Lathrop
stated that if farmers would take more
care to raise hay which they would not b^
ashamed to acknowledge as their own, it
would accrue to ttie benefit of both
farmers and commission merchants.
Richard Collins surprised and pleased
all present with the magnificent manner
in which he rendered several bass solos.
Philip Anspacher spoke of the "Liver
more Hay District," and C. S. Laumeister
responded 10 the toast "The Milling In
terests." A. H. Price spoke of "The Com
mission Hay Business," and A. W. Scott
n:ade pleasing remarks in resurd to "Law
in Connection With Hay." Messrs. Mon
iram and Gnelimetti gave a vocal num
ber.
The remainoer of the programme was as
follows: "The Youne Element in Traje,"
F. C. Somers; "Retailing Hay," H. Lan

A BUEGLAR CAUGHT.
William McMaun Found on thn Prem-
ices of tbe California Caaket
Company.
William McMann, 18 years of age, who
iiives his occupation as a cook, was booked
at the City Prison early yesterday morn
ing by Policemen M. T. Cooney and P. B.
Chambers on a charge of burglary.
The officers were passing the attire of
the California Casket Company at Sixth
and Mission streets, when they noticed
that tne glass of the door leading into the
basement was broken and the lock was
wrenched off. Cooney entered the place
and found a pair of shoes and an overcoat,
in which were wrapped two braces and
two saws. Continuing his search, Cooney
discovered McMann hiding in the elevator
well. Hj had an iron bar, with which he
admitted he had forced an entrance.
McMann said he had been in tbe City
only a few days and was living at the Oak
land House on Third street, but the pro
prietor did not know him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897
WISH TO REDUCE
THE LAW'S DELAY
Attorneys to Ask for the
Creation of New
Courts.
Strictures Upon the Admission
of Candidates to
Pact ice.
Bar Associations Have an Elaborate
Pi. n for Reforming the State's
Judiciary.
The lawyers of San Francisco and Los
Anereles hope for great, things from the
Legislature now in session. The bar
associations of the two cities have been
laboring in conjunction for some mon ths
in preparing an amendment calculated to
reform the judiciary of the State. They
have not entirely completed their labors,
as a conference of the representatives of
the two bodies is to be held soon. The
provisions of tbe amendment, however,
were practically decided upon at a recent
meeting in Los Angeles, at which John A.
Wright represented the local association.
Mr. Wright has a few alterations which
he will suggest at the conference, and
other attorneys will probably have sug
gestions to offer, but these are expected
to be mere matters of detail.
The innovations proposed are radical,
those for expediting appeals by the cre
ation of intermediate appellate courts,
tbe elevation of tbe moral and intellectual
standard of the bar by the institution of
courts of discipline, and the extension of
tbe reauired course of stud}* for admission
to the bar to four years, with annnal ex
aminations, being particularly interest
ing.
The main features of the amendment
are as follows:
The judicial power of the State shall be
vested in the Senate sitting as a court of
impeachment, in a Supreme Court, in dis- ,
trict courts of appeal, in Superior courts,
in courts of discipline for the judicial de
partment, in justices of the pence, and in
such inferior courts as the Legislature
may establish in any city and county or
incorporated town.
The Supreme Court is to be reduced from
â¢even departments, as at present, to tive.
This will not be accomplished till the expi
ration of the terms of the two Justices at
present having the shortest terms to serve,
at which time no successors to them will
be appointed.
This reduced court, it is calculated, will
be amply sufficient to handle wiih care
and expedition all the matters which will
come before it, as a very considerable por
tion of the woric which the supreme tri
bunal of the State is now compelled to
cope with will be finally decided in the
intermediate courts of appeal, known as
the D strict Courts of Appeal.
The^e intermediate appellate courts
will be three in number, located at Los
Angelas, San Francisco and Sacramento,
each of these cities being the seat of a dis
trict which will be created by the assign
ment of the counties by the Supreme
Court. These courts are to have jurisdic
tion in the following matters:
1. In all criminal cases prosecuted by Indict
ment or inlormatlon in a court of record on
questions of law alone.
2. In all such probate matter! as have or
may be provided by law.
3. In ail actions to prevent or abate a nui
sance, t
4. In a'l actions for divorce and the annul
ment of marriages.
5. In all proceedings in insolvency.
6. In actions of forcible or unlawful entry or
detainer.
7. In nil actions for the foreclosure of Hens,
including mongagos.
8. In all actions of tort for the recovery of
damages.
9. In all actions at law for the recovery of
money upon contracts, express or implied.
In a few special cases, as where the
validity of a treaty or statute is called in
question, the foregoing matters may he
tit subjects for the Supreme Cour:, but
ordinarily their decision by the District
courts will be final.
By the assignment of these cases to the
intermediate courts, the bar associations
hope for radical improvements in the
administration of justice. Under the
present system, where the Supreme Court
has to consider all such matters, litigation
is necessarily delayed, and even then tue
Justices are not always able to give the
matters the attention which the attorneys
feel is their due. Under the new order of
things it is provided that every cause,
eith.r in the Supreme or District courts,
is entitled to oral argument unless ex
pressly waived. The matter must then be
decided within thirty days, and no re
hearing can be granted unless the petition
therefor is filed within thirty oays of the
decision.
This provision would make it ordinarily
impossible for a case to occupy more than
three months on appeal, whereas at pres
ent litigants count themselves In luck
who can get a case through' the Supreme
Court in a year. Advantage has hereto
fore been taken of tins fact by appellants
whose only object was to discommode
their antagonists by delay. ,
A change of some importance is In re
gard to the presumption of error. It is
provided in the proposed law that no
judgment shall be disturbed upon error in
any other court unless it appears that if
the error had not been committed the
judgment or order would have been other
wise.
A radical innovation bo far as the judi
ciary of this State is concerned is the pro
posed courts of discipline. These are of
two classes. First, a special court of dis
cipline to be created by a warrant of the
Governor, the Chfef Justice or two Asso
ciate Justices as a District Court of Appeal.
This court will have power to inquire into
the conduct of Judges and magiitrates of
ail degrees.
These officers are priyileged to create
such si court whenever they spe fit, but
they must do so upon the application of
any Justice, Judge or judicial officer, or
upon the petition of live attorneys or ten
other freeholders. This court will have
power to mete out sucn punishment as it
sees fit, from a mere reprimand to per
manent expulsion from the bar.
There are to be also permanent courts
of discipline known of trustees of the bar.
There will be one of these courts in each
appellate d. strict. Each court will con
si-t of nine attorneys, elected from the
body of lawyers of the district and hold
ing office for twelve years. Their duties
are practically the same with respect to
the non-judicial members of the bar as
are the outies of the special court of dis
.cipline in regard to the judiciary, and
they nave the power of exuulsion. Both
of these courts are invested with all the
necessary powers to issue writs, citations
and otherwise manipulate the necessary
executive machinery of courts.
An important change which will inter
est hundreds of youthful aspirants for le
gal honors is that contemplated in the
matter of admission to practice. By the
new law the issuing of licenses is left
wholly to the trustees of the bar. An ap
plicant for admission must register with
the trustees in his district and furnish sat
isfactory evidence of a strict moral char
acter and necessary educational qualifica
tions. Just, what they may consider nec
essary educational qualifications is to be
determined from time to time by the Chief
Justice of the 6 uprenie Court, the only
limitation being that they shall require no
branch not taught in the public schools or
universities of the State.
Having satisfied the trustees in prelimi
nary matters the applicant must devote
four years to the study of the iaw. Each
year during ibis course of study he must
present himself for a careful oral and
written examination by the trustees, and
not until the fourth year's examination is
passed satisfactorily is he granted a
license.
It is specially provided that this shall
not apply to graduates of Hastings College
of the Law, who are to be admitted to
practice upon the completion of ihe course
as heretofore.
The Supreme Court, it is provided, shall
have an appellate jurisdiction over the
courts of discipline in cases where the
special court has permanpntly remanded
a judicial officer from office or the trus
tees had permanently disqualified an at
torney or refused to admit an applicant.
The Supreme Court may, on its own mo
tion or oa application, call for the records
in the case, and review and pass upon the
proceedings. This right of review, how
ever, must be exercised within thirty days
of the original judgment.
The lon* cherished ambition of many
members of the bar for a non-partisan
judiciary is voiced in this proposed amend
ment. It is provided that the nomination
of candidates for judicial positions must
be by petition ana no party designation
shall appear upon the official ballot for
such positions. This provision does not
apply to the election of justices of the
Peace in townships having less than three
thousand inhabitants.
The Justices of the Supreme Court and
of tbe district courts of appeal are to re
ceive the same salary, $6000 a year. The
courts of discipline are to receive a per
diem, the same as paid to members of tbe
Legislature, for the time actually and
necessarily employed. Other salaries re
main as at present.
A very forcible inducement is held out
to Judges to be prompt in rendering their
decisions by a provision that no Justice of
the Supreme Court shall be allowed to
draw his monthly salary until be has
made an affidavit that no cause in his
court remains undecided which has been
submitted for more than sixty days, and
Justices of the District Court must not
have hud any case pending for more than
thirty days. Inability to make such affi
davits will work a forfeiture of salary.
There are numerous other points of
more or less interest to the bar involved
in the amendment, which is rather vol
uminous.
GIRLS WHO ARE CULTURED
The Alter Egos Resent Any
Insinuation That They
Are Otherwise.
Young Ladies Employed in Olfices and
Stores Are Int lligent and Bent
on Self-Development.
The following communication is self*
explanatory:
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Last Sunday morn
ing there appeared in the columns of one of
the dailies of this Cityâ a paper noted more
particularly for setisntionalism than accu
racyâan article headed "Shopgirls Form a
Cub."
Now, the term "shopgirl" is comparatively
unknown in America, anil when occasionally
heard savors, strongly of snobbishness. That
Hit re should be anything in the way of an in
novation iv a number oi intelligent girls
forming a literary organization, merely be
cause of their being of those "other girls" so
delicately referred to by Mrs. Whitney, re
mains for the noveity-seeking to discover, atid
such au artic c would have been in much bei
ter taste coming from the pen ot one of our
cousins across the Â«Â»a, where culture ia
limited to certain classes, than one within
the borders of democratic America's most cos
mopolitan city.
\\ hen it is known that the Alter Egos num
ber uinong thtlr members musicians who en
render and appreciate Beethoven, artists who
have carried away honors from San Fran
cisco's most critical ait school, teachers of
popular private institutions in this City and
the University of California, and Journalists
who if unable to champion democratic priu
ciples would forever hold their peace, the
appropriateness of the title used will be appre
ciated.
The organization is unpretentious, having
no desire lor '-.otoriety, preferring rather to do
than say, und without doubt some of its
doings would be simply incomprehensible to
niÃuv of the so-cailed ladles oi leisure who
speud their time and strength In the pur-uit
of some Duke or Count lor purchase or the in
veiglement of pa ancient mouey-bags into
matrimony.
Some young ladies and matrons of leisure
wno recognize Intellect, innate refinement
and all thut goes to make up the real worth of
character, regardless of the accident of posi
tion, have identified themselves, as active and
associate members for mutual help and im
provement, with the ciub.
The prime requisite of membership 1* not
only wage-earning. The applicant must be
one who realizes that "L'fe is real, life is ear
nest," for the girls believe with Socrates tnat
the best man is he wno most tries to perfect ,
himself and the happiest man he who most
feeiÃ that he is perfecting himself, and re
membering Uypatia, they recognize no sex in
mentality.
The contents of the books handled by one of
the Egos all day are not so unknown to her as
might be supposed, she being found in con
versation quoting readily from ancient and
modern philosophers, poets and scientists.
When asked about the manner In which
they were put before the public, the girls
smiled indifferently with an air that said,
"We shall ko on studying Plato, Lord Lyttou
and Dtummond, profiting by Epictetus in
choosing rather to have things happen as
they do than striving to have them happen as
we choose."
A person having the privilege of entree to
the pleasant clubrooms on one of the evenings
at home would be impressed by the "shop"
element only by its conspicuous itbseuce,
ana meeting there the air of warm sociabil
ity, noting the animated faces that give no
trace of the duties of the day having been
otherwise than pleasant, bat rather a strength
tnnt would enable the possessor to rise above
circumstances, yet withal retaining that
sweet feniiiiency, the most desirable quality
of woman, would feel it a fortunate accident
which ha<i piacea these other girls in a posi
tion favorable to the development of such
characters; and that they are not only wise,
but happy in following the advice of the old
Chinese teacher, who admonished his pupils
to be not concerned about xecurlug a position
in life, but rather in becoming fitted to fill
one.
That the office and many other wage-earn
ing girls of this City are intelligent and cul
tured is well known, and that they may not
&c understood as occupying a lower plane
than they do, having a hard struggle aeainst
public sentiment in gaining what they "want
to know" in the way of literature, U the ob
ject of this communication.

A WOMAN HELD UP
BY A FOOTPAD
Mrs. John Pettee Robb3d
and Beaten in the
Street.
The Outrage Committed Within
a Few Rods cf Har Own
Home.
She Was Supposed to Have Been Col*
lecting for the Proposed Emer
g nc~ Home.
Mrs. John Pettee was assaulted and
robbed by a footpad last evening within a
hundred yards of her own home at Fran
cisco and Leaven worth streets.
The assault was one of the boldest and
most dastardly that baa figured in the
lists oi such outrages for some time.
Mrs. Pettee is one of the most promi
nent and active workers in the Society for
tie Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
She has been for some time actively,en
gaged in an effort to found and establish
an emergency home for women and
children.
In this effort she has been for some days
soliciting cash subscriptions among the
charitably disposed of the City, and has
often gone home with a well-filled purse.
It is supposed that this fact became
Known and served as the temptation for
the assault. Fortunately Mrs. Pettee was
yesterday otherwise engaged, and the
pur-e that was taken from her contained
only a few dollars.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Pettee visited
the City Jail, where a woman is confined
for no other cause than that she is penni
less. She nad become interested in the
case and spent the late hours of the day
in .trying to secure her lodgment else
where, where her two children, taken
from her by the authorities, might be re
turned to her.
Mrs. Pettee left the Hyde-street cars at
the corner of Chestnut street. She walKed
down the sttep incline to Francisco street
and was about to turn into that thorough
fare when she noticed a rtan hurrying to
ward her from the darkness of a vacant lot
at the corner.
The butler of the Pettee family usually
meets Mrs. Pettee at ;he corner when she
remains out after dark, and thinking it
wa-, he she called to the man by name.
In an instant she saw her mistake. The
footpad sprang down into the road in
front of her. "I have been watching for
you for two days," he said with an oath.
"I know you; I know where you live.
Don't utter a word or I'll choke you to a
finish. I want your monpv."
Paralyzed with fear Mrs. Pettee still
found voice to say: " Yuu cunt have it,"
at the same lime thrusting her hand hold
ing a purse bacic of her under her heavy
fur cont.
"We'll see if I can't," said the ruffian
"I haven't been waiting here for fun.''
At the same time he struck the fright
ened woman three quick blows on the
back of tne neck thtt nearly robbed her of
consciousness.
Her wide-brimmed bat and the thick
standing collar of her coat, she thinks,
saved iier irom severe injury, for slie is
sure the fellow used a slungstiot or weapon
of some kind. She wonders how it was
she did not fall.
The fellow grabbed her wrist and twist
ed it until the other hand with the purse
came from its hiding. He snatched the
book, rattled the coin in her face and said:
"Have you any more?"
She said she had not. "Then go; and
if I bear a word from you I'll choke you,"
he said.
Mrs. Pettee staggered down the road,
the footpad following her until within a
few yards of her home on the corner of
Leavenworth street. When almost st the
gate the voice of another man, who seemed
to be hiding near there, frightened her
almost into insensibility. She succeeded,
however, in reaching herdoor, and it being
opened to her she fell on the floor in a
spasm of hysterics. A physician was sum
moned and the members of the household
gav<- the alarm.
No arrests have been made. The shock
to Mrs. Peitee will probably confine her to
her home for some days.
The locality of the Pettee residence is at

INGLIS BACK AGAIN.
The Hallway Man Quietly Returns
From Hlg Strange Trip.
Railway men in this City received a gen
nine surprise yesterday when told that
their old colleague. John S. Inglis, con
tracting freight agent of the Union Pa
cific, had returned to town and taken
up his business so unceremoniously
diopped some weeks ago. Among the
local railway agents Inglis is quite popu
lar, and his return was made the occa
sion of many welcomes.
Recently he left town on a Sunday with

Grip and Golds
LA GRIPPE and COLDS are so similar
that the skilled physician is ofttimes baf-
flod. Your safety lies in "Seventy-seven";
It cures both Grip and Colds; relieving
the mind of uncertainty, which in itsolf
goes a long way toward a care.
"BONE-RACKING GRIP."
O. F. Spring, publisher of the Preston
Times, lowa, writes: '"Your remedy, '77,'
for Grip, relieved myself and mother from
the worst 'bone-racking' cases of Grip that
we ever nad, and in mother's case it saved
a doctor's bill of about $10. The invest-
ment has brought returns that I little ex-
pected."
"COLD ON THE LUNGS."
Harry McDonald, Rahway, N. J.,
writes: "I had a severe cold on my lungs
that lasted over six weeks, and could get
no relief. One bottle of your '77' stopped
the terrible cough and the second bottle
completely cured me. It is with all con-
fidence that I recommend '77' to my
friends."

here declared they did not know whither
he went, but some of them said he had
left California for an indefinite period.
The purpose of his trip, it was said, was
to evade payment of alimony to his wife,
who was seeking a divorce, and to keep
possession of the boy, claimed by Mrs.
Inglis. In iiis absence matters were set
tled to the satisfaction of all concerned,
and Inglis has returned to San Francisco
to stay. He is reticent about his own
affairs, but explains that h/is trip had no
special significance. _
BUSH-STREET 00BBLE3.
An Effort to Be MÂ«de by the Property-
Owner* for Improvement*.
The property-owners on the line of
Bush street between Kearny and Van
Ness avenue will make another effort to
have that street bituminized.
It is claimed that during The past thirty
five years nothing has been done to im
prove the condition of this thoroughfare
at its eastern end, and that the round
headed cobblestones that were put down
In the sand have been permitted tore
main there except in *uch places as the
Sutter-street Railway Company displaced
them to put down its "ingle ghost track,
the rails of which are permitted to still
stand there, a terror to teamsters. This
is noticeably so on the block between
Stockton and Powell, where the entire
block is almost impassable by reason of
rntholes and the objectionable rails.
To remedy this the property-owners will
petition the Board of Supervisors 10 re
pave the entire street between the points
mentioned.
A similar effort was made about six
years ago by some of the largest land
owners on me street, but it fell through
at that time because of the litigation then
going on between the City authorities and
the railroad company. But now it is said
that cloud has been removed in favor of
the people and against the company.
Hence another effort will be made and as
they trust will bear bette.* fruit.
Bush street, the residents and property
owners claim, has the easiest grade of any
of the hill streets in the City. There is,

WILL NOT RESIGN.
The Chinese -'Vice-Consul States That
He Will Not Leave the Diplo
matic service.
An article appeared in an evening pai>er
yesterday that caused King Owyan;?, Chi
nese Vice-Consul, some amusement and
not a little annoyance. The article in
question stated that Mr. King had re
signed from the Chinese diplomatic ser
vice because of insufficient salary, and
that he would tro in business somewhere
in this country.
The Vice-Consu 1 , when interv ewed re
garding the matter la*t night, stated that
he had not resigned, he was not dissatis
fied with his saiary and had no intention
of eoing into any other business.
"Some time la-t year I tendered my
resignation to the Minister," said he, "but
it wan not accepted, and that settled the
question. The facts alleged in the pub
lished article are incorrect."
This will be satisfactory news to the
citizens of this City as well as to the better
class of Chinese here, as King Owvang is a
man that could not well be leplaced in the
Chinese consulate here. He is not only a
graduate or Yale, but is one of the most
intelligent men in the Imperial diplo
matic service.
His wife is a native of Grass Valley, and
was given all the advantages of American
education and association oy her Chinese
parents till sne is as much a California
girl a= any native daughter in the State.
Mrs. King stated last evening over the
telepnone that the "resignation" story
wan wholly untrue.
"It is untrue, because I never heard of
ir," said she, "and a* I am Mrs. Kinj.% Mr.
King would have told me first Â«<f all."
And the Chinese lady snake just as
pi. inly and just as emphatically as
any one of her American sisters would
have done under like circumstances.ARMY AND NAVY
WON THE MATCH
Young Officers Outplay
University Men at
Football.
Society Belies Were Oat in Force
to See the Athletic
Beaux.
Lieutenant King's Kicking acd Back
ing a Brilliant Feature cf
the Gams.
The combined forces of the army.and
navy have met and defeated the repre
sentatives of many universities. The pen,
for the time being at least, Gas proved Jess
mhrnty than the sword.
The athletic yoang officers who learned
football a: West Point and Annapolis
along with the arts of war have beaten the
Varsity men a: their own game. The
score was 16 to 0.
The match was played for charity, and
incidentally for the cation of many
fair maidens, who were wont with pleasure
f\. zsze upon the struggling athletes, the
i twst representatives of society young men
because vigorous, manly and courageous.
The crowd that assembled at Central
Park hardly anted into the thousands,
but i: was select. There were more pretty
and well-eowned young women in the
grand stand than probably ever before
assembled in the same space to witness an
outdoor event in this City. The afternoon
was well suited to suca a gathering. ..
Clear and yet sufficiently bracing to
make lixht wraps more than merely orna
mental the weather was of the kind that
permitted of a dispiay of pretty furs to the
best effect. Society belies and the season's
buds were out in force and looked prettier
than ever because of ruddy cheeks made
so by the crisp air and the excitement and
heightened ty becoming winter gowns
cud millinery.
As usual with anything that is properly
a society event, the beginning was late.
When ordinarily the grounds would have
begun to assume a populous appearance
became ( I the nearness of the scheduled
hour for the conte-t, the prospect for any
sort of a crowa looked dismal.
But when society began to come, as it
did after the hour when the. game was
supposed already to be on, it came in a
continuous stream through the Marfeet
stree; entrance to the Central Park
grounds. As at the horse show, there
were many more pretty girls than there
were appropriate escorts for them. Bat
"then there were to be over thirty young
men on the fie.d in football attire, and
many of them had admirers among those
that strolled round one corner of the grid
iron and Trent up into the main grand
stand, opposite toe middle of the field.
At first there were only a few strazeling
soldiers in uniform loitering about the low
fence at the edge of the gridiron and wait
ing for something to happen. They gazed
over at the aim vacant seats and th en
back: at their musical instruments dis
tributed on the bieachers at one corner of

Presently Police Sergeaut Michael Jo

uniform, entered, followed by iour
teen patrolmen.
The Cnited States soldiers utttUMtfrtfy
stood erect and threw out thei- cnests.
Tr.e guardian of the gridiron marsnaiea
his men upon the field. The peace would

fact, the tardy crowd began to come stead
ily through the main entrance.
Judge Carroll Cook strolied in a.one,
under a glossy new teaver, and drifted
along over to where the band bad
AS THE BALL WAS MOVED AND BY WHOM.
The first play Is that indicated at the top of the d agra v which represents the Central Park
gridiron as viewed from the jcrasd stand on the <rest side of the field, the Markeustreet end of the
ground being on th* left hand. Bar Sherman kicks off from the center line down to within ten
yards of tn* Army aad >'avy goal- Hu kick Is shown by a wavy line marked Sh for Sherman.
Lieotenant oian catching the tali, ran* It back and regains ten yards beore be a downed
near ihe 20-yard Hoe. That cross shows that the ban Is down for a acrfmmaf* and tn v the
Army and Navy Is In possession. The next pUr is a kick by Kin? back almost to the center of
the fiÂ»ld where Harrelson of the University Club team, as shown by the initial H, rets the
ba-1 aad v dowsed on the .pot. The next play result. la do sain for the University Club, which

established itself on the bleachers and was
beginning to tune up.
Presently, as Sergeant Conboy was enter
taining a group n ar tne reserved ticket
=eiler s stand with characteristic comments
on what a picked police team could do to
the victors of the coming contest, one of
the teams came in from Market street.
The men were strikingly arrayed- Their
stockings were so" new and yellow that
you saw spots in the air after loosing at
tbena, and their sweaters were so white
and of such flimsy fabric that they seemed
but light undergarments.
â¢ But toe effect was there â the white and
the yellow â and -when the effect bad be
come less painful Deople began to recog
nize familiar faces above the conbination
Jhat stood for the colors of the swell uni
versity club.
- Then the army and navy team came in
with their calves covered by red and white
stockings, that produced a dizzy sensation
; and looked like sections of a barber's pole.
TneyVent on the field â those that were
to play. Those that were to fill vacancies
occasioned by sudden death staked along
the sidelines, and together with other
privileged characters and police officers
loomed conspicuously before the eager
spectators in the rear, occasionally obscur
ing the play.
The first half showed that the army and
i navy officers nad an advantage over their
opponents from the club. But the advan
tage was not great enough for them to ob
tain a touchdown, though most of the
i time tie ball ,wi kept almost- continu- â 
ously in university territory and was actu- ;
a ly carried across the goal line once, but
on what proved to be a play resulting j
from an unfair move. And the ball was
given to the university men very near
their own era!
I In the second half the officers forced the
pi iv in:.\ ana scored three touchdowns,
generally after ion. > advances made little
by hue of steady becks on each side of
the tackle.
The p rt;Â«3ns of the winning team be
j came wiiulv enthusiastic, and even pretty

And rt-d, white and blue ribbons fluttered
and srna'.i National tiags waved, and far
across the field a large group of private
soldiers bearing overhead the Nai:>nai
colors forgot that they were subordinates
and veiled wildly, "Go it, Xoian," "Good
boy, Kmg," aud King responded and so
did Solan.
And Lieutenant Hinckley, whose enthu
siasm overstepped his privileges as a sub

army and navy players in stentorian
tones until Referee Ransome smiling. y cr

SEEN BY A VETERAN.
Frankenhelmer Passes Some Re
marks on the Game and the
Players.
Tbe rough-and-ready men of tbe Army
and Navy plainly showed that their daily
outdoor exercise bad toughened them and
made them more fit for a vigorous athletic
contest than what might be termed the
hothouse life of the University clubmen.
However, if the University team had been
pat through a course of good solid } train
ins; it would have made a much better
showing comparatively * than it did, lor
there are on that team some men who
have been brilliant players.
The fact t::at the Army and Navy team
did not score in the tirst iialf showed con
clusively what the element of training and
superior physical condition bad to do with
the result, when the contest was pro
longed.
As for the generalship on both sides, it
demonstrated tne superiority of â¢ the foot-,
ball schooling . of tne East over that ; fur
nished on this coast. The kicking of Lieu
tenant â¢ Km? 'â â  was \by far the best I : have
I seen on the Central Bark erounds. And
[Captain Mch"e*x el too UuiTeriity club
showed his training in ordering frequent
kicks. He saw that King could oatpunt
bis own fullback for d. stance, bus he real
ized that the Army and Navy backs were
weatc en catcning, and he wished to take
advantace of their fumbles.
In eenerai the fumbiing was too promi
nent a feature of the game. It cost the
University Club aearly.
The long runs of the day were accom
plished by individual effort, rather than
by skillfully executed team piay.
For tte University club /red McNear
rut up a brilliant came at halfbacE; so
d:d Harrelson at quarter and S. McNear
at fullback. Billy Harrelson several times '
save an exhibit! n of the particular style â 
of play in tvnich he usÂ«d to excelâ catching
pant- and running iow and dodging
rapidly in a scattered hold. He played a
headyeame, tat there was lacking that
smoothnea- of action between the center
an 1 , himself thai comes from practice
together in raising the ball. Bill Pringie
at guard and Hamey at center played a
very plu- ky game. Bat ;ne eleven lacked
team Â»orK, and frequently the fumbiing '
was very Dad.
A pretty riece of blocking was done by
S. McNeTr in the latter part of tne first
half when he collided hard with McCor- i
mack :o pro est a return kick. Benind
the interference o! Harrelson and others
Majtee, who replaced Seamht in the ,
second half, made a brilliant run for a
gain of twenty-eve yards. That was prob
ably the best conce/ted piay for a long
gain during- the game. J
For me Army and Navy. >~oian, who
cap ained the team, King, Carson, Ames
and Boby were particularly noticeable.
Nolan's fine work at end had been seen
here before, Bu: Lieutenant King's play- ,
ing waÂ» a new exaibuson. He playÂ»d in
eooo form a. I through the game. He
showed bimse.f a quick, ready p.ayer, and
he tcok advautagfe of every opportunity
be had.
He bucked the line well and seTeral
times appeared with a clear cold on the
other side. Two of his return kickÂ» of
over fifty yards were remarkable. Nolan
and JJcCormack at end- were weil in evi
dence lor their tackling and tueir running
vith tbe bai .
Tie came inaugurated a pleasant cus
tom that it continued will be a means of
further raising t c standard of football on
this coast ana of insuring its maintenance
as the most generally popular of all
athletic exhibitions because it is free from
professionalism and because of the class
of people that will take an interest in it.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figum
i at station indicme maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of !
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredths, I
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connec*. p<in s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. 'Ihe
: word "hieh" means hlirh barometric pressure and I
; is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
i and accompanied by cloudy wentlier anrt ram*.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washineton
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coasi.and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "lnw is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain fOtith of i>rccon is tmprob
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
v.eather may be expected ;u summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
will produce an opposite result.

Conductor Sherwood'i Record Stretches
128 Times Around the Wor d.
There is a dining-car conductor on tne
Northern Pacific road, running out of
Minneapolis every week or two lor the
coast, who Keeps a chalk-mark record of
liis trips from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
just as the Arizona Kid used to Keep tally
of the men he had killed by cutting a
notch on hia eun butt. There are 525
chalk mark 9 down now and 128 little
circles, representing the equivalent of
journeys arouixi the globe.
The conductor is W. S. Sherwood and he
has had twenty-three years' continuous
service. For ten years h^ wus running for
the Pullmans from New York to Chicago,
and lrom Chicago to St. Paul. He made
these trips 840 times. Then, as boon as
the Northern Pacific was completed from
the Mississippi to the Western ocean, in
1883, ne started in its dining service, and
he has gone from here to Tscoma more
than 500 times. In nil, in his twenty
three years of service, hÂ« has run 3.212,000
miles, or 128 times around the world, ana
he thinks he carries the record as a trav
eler, lie has never been hurt in a wreck;
in fact, he has never been in but one, and
that was a mere Dluff at a wreck. He is
the only man yet on the road who has
been with it since it was first put throuzh
to the coast. â New York Sun.

MOBALASKA WAS
A GOOD BUNTER
Caused Potentate to Fall
and Three Others to
Pull Up.
Pat Murphy Beaten Out a Neck
by Yemen in the Match
Race.
Doggett Piloted Frank X to V.ctory.
B namela Overthrew Kamsiu, a
Pronounced F.Vtrite.
The two weeks of equine sport drew to a
close at Ingleside track yesterday to the
general sorrow of the betting public, for
the majority of them fared more than
ordinarily well in the argument with the
layers of odds. The attendance was
larger, and beyond the defeat of three
first cuoices there was nothing startling to
relate in connection with the day's pro
ceedings.
The track was in superb condition, and
as the weather was warm and summery, it
was to be regretted that some of the top
notchers were not out, for some record
smashing; might have been indulged in.
However, as it was, the racing was good
and thoroughly enjoyed by all.
Perhaps the peculiar way in which the
warm favorite Potentate was defeated was
the sensation of the afternoon. The
Burns & Waterhouse entry was an even
money chance over Mobalaska, Shieid
bearer, Hymn and others to win the third
event on the card, a six-furlong run.
Mobalaska was on her bad behavior at the
post, and when she finally did line un at
the barrier and break swerved toward the
outside, causing Potentate to stumble and
throw Thorpe and cause Hymn, Cadenza
and Harry O to pull up. It was now
easy sailing for the Corrigan mare and
she galloped in before fchieldbearer, with
Favory a close third. The favorite ran
away over two miles before he could ,be
stopped.
Tbe match race between Yemen and Pat
Murphy at five furlongs for $1000 a side
anu $600 added, although one-sided in the
betting, Droved quite an even thing. The
ring laid* twos and 9 to 5 against Pat with
a very little Ito 2 against tue old horse.
Pat outbroke Yemen at the start and
maintained an advantage of about one
length until well into the stretch, where
he began to tire and bad to acknowledge
defeat hy a neck in 1 :01 flat.
Old Frank X, with his boxing-gloves,
sadly outclassed his field in tbe opening
mile and a furlong selling event and
heading Veragua in the stretch downed
the second choice, So;mitar, cleverly by
less than a length, in 1:56%.
The shadow of his former self as far as
Â«Â«addlework goes by his ride on the 8 to 5
choice, O'Fleeta, in the eix-luriong dash
following Marty Bergen demonstrated the
fact that his star is on the wane, and
't'were batter that he should give way to
one of the younger generation. Doubt
ml, ttie second choice, outsprinted Contri
tion, an early morning tip, through the
stretcn, beating that sprinter out handily
by three parts of a length. O'Fieeta was
handled about as well as a sailor would a
four-in-hand.
Loiuj Ezell's game gelding, Knrnsin,
heavily played at even money to win the
mile and a sixteenth, fell easy prey to
Benamela, against which a<< good as 4^ to
1 was obtainable.
Jones on the first choice raced away in
front at a great clip, setting altogether too
fast a pace. When Sloan on Pat Dunne's
brown colt cut loose in the stretch he
easily overtook the leader and won easily
by nearly three lengths in the fast time of
1:48%. Morte Fonse was a lair third.
Ttie mile and a quarter hurdle handicap
was taken by Ed. Corrigan's Adolph
Spreckels. Together with his stable coin
panion, Bedford, the pair were backed
from threes down to 9 to 5.
George Cochran on bureckels did not
wait lone, but shot his mount out in the
lead and, occupyine the largest portion of
the track tl.e last furlong, finished a head
in front of Biakeley's Mr. Reel at the win.
The second choice, Hello, was lapped on
the place horse. Â . a ââ_
J.H. Shields' good colt Howard S was
a P rohib.tive3 to 10 favorite for the final
seven- furlong spin for three-year-olds
and although Greyburst made a good Dm
for the coin the favorite bÂ«Â«J him handily
at the finish in 1:29^. Don Ciarencio
finished in the show.

Jockey Lauis Lloyd was disgusted with

presented his sprinter Hymn to Leo Wil

Mr. Corrigan attributed the improve
nient in Adolph Spreckels' jumping to the
lighter material of which me jumps are
constructed at Ingleside. Across the bay
they are more stockily built with two or
three feet of brush on top which Mr. Cor
rigan thinks has a tendency to scare a
horse.
The stewards after investigating the
running of The Sinner rendered the fol
lowing decision yesterday :
January 9, 1897.
W. S. Leake, Secretary, Cityâ Deab. Sib: On
Dec-ember 31, in the ihird rr.ce oi that day, the
horse The Sinner, owned and trained by H. H.
Hunn, with Jockey Piyce up, carrying 106
pounds, distance five-eighths of a mile, on a
.slow track rau .aid was beaten off about eight
or ten lengths. Time, 1:05.
In this race the horse si. owed speed, and was
in good position in the stretch, when abreast
of the paddock, however, Pryce apparently
took the horse from the middle to the inside
of the track, right in behind the horse Mer
cutlo, and in that position, with no possible
chance of getting through, made the custo
mary exhibition of trying to put up a vigorous
whipping finish, but in reality with a view of
misleading the "stand."
In exDlanation of this ride, Pryce said the
horse swerved with him. Mr. Hunn also
stated the horse would swerve to the rail, and
he thought advisable to use a "Durr" in the
future to prevent same. Pryce was warned
af.er tne race, and we concluded to hold the
race in abeyance pending the future running
of the horse.
On January 6, with 103% pounds up, good
track, The Sinner ran, and won galloping in
I :o3J.^â the most flagrant reversal of form that
has been seen at the meeting. In this race the
horse showed phenomenal speed; showed no
disposi'ion to swerve at any time and seem
ingly had no use for a burr, as they did not
use one in the race.
Mr. Hunn says he bet $160 for himself and
$50 lor pa i ties out of town on tne race. The
horse was very heavily backed in the betting,
and by parties who seemingly knew what they
were doing. The previous performance of the
iiorse certainly did not warrant same.
Subsequent investigation of the race on the
31Â« st ult. gives it a very suspicious look, and
our ideas are fully corroborated by the evi
dence of at least halt a. Uozvn reputaole horse
men, who were up at tiie paddock and saw
the ride and actions of Jockey Pryce, and we
are convinced he threw the place away.
Jockey Pryce has ridden the horse in ah of
iiis races, coniequently we can get no evi
dence from any other rider, etc.
After tne race of the 6th Mr. Hunn said to
one of the pnrties who placed some money for
him, in ens. 1 ne m asked if he had done so,
to den y same; in explanation of this said he
did not warn anybody to know he bet on the
races.
We do not think the running of the horse,
the ride of the jockey, or the acions of the
owner and trainer are ift accordance wilh the
rules of racing, but are disposed to give them
every consideration. Jociey Pryce is fined
$100 and notified that any future exhibition of
the kind will get him in trouble, Â«na H. H.
Ilunn, owner and trainer, ii cautioned us to
tae future running and management of his
horses for the reasons herein expressed.

OONYEETS TO SOOIALISM.
Rev. W. IJ. P. Bliss Is S tisfled With
iiis Work Here.
Rev. W. D. P. Bliss to-day concludes a
week of very important work in and about
San Francisco and pursues his labors
eastward again.
It has been the clerical author's chief
purpose to stimulate thought along the
lines of Christian socialism.
"1 have met about the same conditions
here as elsewhere," be says, "and I find
in this community, as elsewhere, earnest
souls striving to better mankind and nar
row men clinging to old forms."
The main purpose of Rev. Mr. Bliss in
com in c to San Francisco has been to
awaken thought on social themes. The
following is his resume of what Christ. an
socialism is:
"Socialism is," he says, "not a scheme,
a system, a sta us; but a theory, a philo
sophy, a lite. It is the principle of social
action. Socialism is as flexible in its sys
tem as it is detinue in its aim. Any sys
tem that would carry out its principle is
socialism. In different countries and un
der different conditions it takes very va
rious lorms. In Germany it aims at a
socialistic national development. In
France it makes little of the nation, and
centers around the commune, or town
ship. In Belgium it comes very near to
non-political co-operation. In England it
is parliamentary and municipal. In
Switzerland it centers around the canton.
"In the United Btates it- will probably
follow our National instinct and be a fed
eration of industrial and political federa
tions. Sociali-m, therefore, cannot be
identified with any one form of socialism.
The moment wiil never come when we
can say, "Socialism is established,' for so
cialism iv.not a status, but a life. Society
cannot be run into a mold. This evolu
tionary character of socia. ism is its modern
aspect. Fifty years ago socialism wa's
statical. Owen, St. S^on, Fourier, Cabet,
ail bad their ideal Utopia*, into which
they would run society. Many of tbese
Utopias were tried in var.ous local com
munities in America. Some of these still
exist, and so far us they have been reli
gious have economically succeeded, as at
Amana and Economy ; yet they anÂ» prac
tically dying out, because they are secta
rian andutopian, not world-wide, as Chris
tian socialism."
A Lying Deserter.
Mrs. Webster of 3017 Laguna street, an aunt
of ex-United States Senator Sabine of Minne
sota, denies that Hurry Sabine, the deserter
from the army who was arrested here lust
Wednesday, is a sod of the ex-S^uator, as
claimed by the deserter. She says that the
ex-Senator has no childrjen.

FIRST MESSAGE
FROM FARALLON
Weather Report From
Daisy Doud Brought
by Pigeons.
Feasibility of a Much-Mooted
Service Practically Demon
strated.
The Wind-Swept Islands Are Placed
in Direct Communication for
the First Time.
The homing-pieeon service between the
north Farallon Island and San Francisco
has earJy demonstrated its entire feasi
bility. It was put upon its feet, so to
speak, by A. Carlisle during the past
week. When Miss Daisy Doud went out
to take her position as schoolteacher on
the wind-swept and surf-stained roots
Mr. Carlisle went along and carried out
fifty homing pigeons. Some of these he let
fly on the way to train them. Many were
taken to the North Farallon and were
there placed in a favorable position.
Yesterday the first message by carrier
pi. eon ever sent out from the Farallon
Islands was received in this city by A.
Carlisle from Miss Daisy Doud. This was
inclosed in an aluminum cylinder weigh
ing only eight grains and was written on
a prepared slip of thin paper of a pre
scribed form. On one side of the slip waa
the first weather report ever received in
San Francisco directly from the Farallon.
Considering that the Weather Bureau
and the Chamber of Commerce and A.
Carlisle have been co-operating to get a
weather service established, it seemed
fitting that Miss Doud should, accepting
the position of amateur weather observer
in connection with her duties as a teacher,
send first an account of the weather. This
she did.
This, which was no less than a notifica
tion also to the mercantile and shipping
community of San Francisco that here
after they will be able to gather such ma
rine news as may come in view of the
Farallon, left the North Farallon at 9:40
a. m. At that time the weather was hazy
and the wind fiorruthe northeast blowing
freshly. The lime of transmission is not
exactly known. This being the first flying
of a bird in actual service, and the route
being new and the weather thick the
speed was not what it will be.
The reverse side of the message concern
ing the weather brought Miss Doud's first
statement of life on the island as a
teacher, and for its intrinsic interest as
the rirst to be flown over sen and Jand
froir that locality is given in full. It is a3
follows:
Alive and well to tell the story. Think
I shall like the place and people very
much. Please let Mr. Wood know.
Shall begin school on Monday. Sirs.
Beeman Â»ayÂ» to come back and finish
your coffee.
DAISY ANNETTE OOUD.
The message was addressed to A* Car
lisle. The reference to the coffee was a
playful allusion to Mr. Carlisle's condi
tion, in all probability, after a sea voyage,
and a somewhat abrupt landing in f!.i;
bot.om boat, which seemed to roll twice
to every wave that came along, and also
seemed to have more water inside of it
than there was in the rolling ccean out
side. Mr. Wood, who is mentioned, is the
architect, who is Mis* Doud's uncK
The service will continue without inter
ruption until all th-- birds ha7e been tiown
from the island. There will be no inier
rnption if otner birds can be put on the
island in time. There have been no facili
ties for regularly hinding there hereto
fore. The demonstration of feasibility of
the messenger service may liel;- to provide
facilities to rectify this. At the worst
there will be birds on the wing bound
from the Farallon to Berkeley, bringing
news for the Weather Bureau and other
news possibly for San Francisco, for somo
days to come. While tuere is no cable*
to the Farallon the homing pigeon fur
nishes the only means oi communication.
The birds are fu-nished tratu.tously for
the service by Mr. Carlisle, who is an en
thusiastic pigeon fancier.

MAY NOT ACT
An Upheaval in the Plan
for the Appointment of
Delegates.
Municipal Rep ican Politics
Furnish an i zpected Sen
sation
All Kinds cf Explanations Being
Made to Account for the
Collapse.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,^
903 Broadway, Jan. 9. s
The collapse of tne committee of twen
ty-one, as predicted in this morning's
Call, took place to-day, and th.-re is now
Bo hope of the members appointing dele
gates to a Republican municipal conven
tion.
Ever since tho committee of twenty-one
â was named by the City Kepublican Cen
tral Committee mere has been some sus
picion that there was something hidden
beneath that would not look well in the
light of day. The personnel of the ap
pointed committee was such as to cause
people to wonder how it was possible that
they should accept the responsibility cast
upon them by the City Central Committee,
whom they have fought, tooth and nail,
for four years.
There are many peculiarities about
purely municipal politics existing at this
time. A few months ago the main poiut
at issue between the two faction* was
whether delegates to conventions should
be elected at primaries c r appointed by
comiuitteemen. tieorne Pardee and W.
H. Friend worked hard and succ eded in
estabiishing a principle, which was rati
fied at the State convention, that nil dele
gates should be elected at. primaries.
When, therefore, these same men accepted
the responsibility of naming a whole Re
publican convention great surprise was
manifested.
So much opposition ha? been raised
against the manner of arranging for the
convention proposed by the committee
that at each successive meeting excuses
have been made for not making their
choice public, a:id after the publication in
to-day's Call of the fact that prominent
citizens were refusing to sign the pledges
sent to them to act as delegates the mat
ter speedily came to a crisis, and at the
next meeting it is officially stated that the
appointrnen. plan will be abandoned. The
exact reasons leading up to to-day's climax
are not very clear, and all sorts of excuses
are being made by the friends of the com
mittee of twenty-one for their backdown.
Although politics proverbially makes
strange bedfellows some of the compan
ionships which the plan broug.t about
cou.d not be tolerated without comment,
even in this city.
An attempt is being made to throw the
onus of the whoie affair on the shoulders
of Democrats who, it is claimed, manipu
lated the unpopular scheme. This, how
ever, will need considerable corroboration
Delore being accepted. Tne most reason
able conc.usion to be arrived at is that
the comniiuee of. twenty-one started out
in good faith, and that, having discovered
the unpopularity of tne scheme and its
origin, they have dec ded to get out of the
fix with as much dignity a? possible.
It is now practically certain that the
Municipal League will be actively revived
and that the campaign of next March will
be very similar to that of two years a.o.
There is no doubt but that John L. Davie
will attempt to :-uceed nimselt as Mayor,
though the nature of the campaign he
may make has not yet been outlined.
During the past few days a citizens'
movement has i.een actively worked up
which will indorse Davie' and which it is
claimed has a large following. Under
present circumstances it does not seem
possib c for any party to put a straight
ticket in the held with any confidence tnat
it will be elected. Had a clean campaign
been made by the Republicans, such as
was made by the County Committee last
fall, a full Republican administration
would have gone into the City Hall next
April. As it is there will be so many fac
tions fighting for supremacy that ihe en<i
cannot be foretold. Certain it is that so
far as the citj of Oakland is concerned, all
â¢ the good work done during the McKinley
campaign in harmonizing the Republican
party has been undoue.
As an object lesson of what can be ac
complished by a ciean Republican cam
paign on this side of the bay, it may be
mentioned that Alameda's majority of
5000 saved this Slate to McKinley, and
with one exception every legislative and
county nominee oi the party last Novem
ber was elected by laree pluralities.

DIED FOR LOVE OF HER.
W. S. Willis, Driven by Jeal

Life.
Found Asphyxiated in the Park
Hotel â Letters That Told
SuiciJa Int ntion.
ALA3JEDA, Cal., Jan. 9.â Driven by
the pangs of jealousy, \V. S. Willis, who
has been away from his wife for about two
years, took his lite in he Park Hotel this
evening. He was found in a dying condi
tion alter 4 o'clock, but was able to tell
his wou.d-be rescuers that he had taken
laudanum with intent to commit suicide.
He also had the gas turned on to make a
sure job of it. Death ensued at 9 o'clock,
after every effort had been made to save
the man's lift.
Mr. Willis came to the hotel last night
and secured a room. At noon to-day t c
Chinese servant found the door locked
wiieii he attempted to enter to make the
bed. He left and did not return until
after 4 o'clock, and still the door was
locked. He then notified the proprietor,
who at once bei;an to investigate and
brote open the door. A towel had been
placed over the transom, a blanket over
the door and strips of paper wedged into
the window to prevent the escape of gas,
which was found turned on full force.
On the table stood a glass bottle, from
which he had drunk the laudanum. An
oren note asked tnat his wife be notified
at once. Tiiere were also two sealed notes,
one to bis wi,e and the other to one Paul,
supposed to be his brother. The first one
reads:
Park Hotel, alameda, Cal., Jan. 9, 1897.
//tu.c' Eva: After seeing you to-day I
changed my mind and siopDed here, as I
wanted to die &s near you as possible. Dearest
Eva, my bean Is breaking as I write this.
PieHse, dearest Eva, see tr.at. I am decently
buried aud forgive poor Will for his faults. Bo
I will say goou-by. Remember I <11e for love
of you. My God. it is terrible to die so, wiih
out one kina hand to be near me. Well, dear
Eva, I hone we will meet in the next world.
So good-by. Your own Will.
P. a. â 1 am crying so hard as I write this.
The other note was dated San Francisco,
January ti, 1897, and ran thus:
Dear Paul: By the time this reaches yon I
will be dead. The strain is too much for me to
bear. Come and see my dead body. Tell Eva
good-by. Will.
Dr. Pond tried to resuscitate the dying
man and worked over him until 9:40,
when life was extinct. The Coroner was
then notified ana the remains were taken
to the morgue, where they remained for
the night.
At the time the deceased left home two
years ago he accused his wife of loving
another, which was the cause of break
ing up the housel.o:a. Mrs. Willis went
to L<os Angeles soon after the separation
and went into a restaurant. She returned
some time ago.

THIRTY-SIX YEARS
A MILITIAMAN
Armorer Ellis Is the Oldest
Guardsman in the
State.
No Ccmrades Left Who Enlisted
in the Oakland Guard
in 1861
Has a Complete Record of His Com
jfffl pany and Many' Mementos
cf Members.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 9. f
Charles H. Ellis, who was a prominent
figure at last night's reunion of the Oak
land Guard, is the oldest militiaman in
the State. He joined the old (Juard in
June, 1861, and has be n a leading mem
ber of it ever since that time, although tho
CAPTAIN CHARLES H. ELLIS of Company! A, Fifth Regiment
Guard has passed through many changes,
and is now known as Company A, Fifth
Regiment.
Ke is now the armorer of the company,
and has been in the service of the State
for thirty-six consecutive years and wears
more long-service medals Uan any other
man in California.
Wften fully decorated, the texture of the
cloth of his coat is severely tried with the
weight of his ornaments. From 1887 to
1895. as told by one medal with many bars,
he took honors at the annual State militia
shoot. Another medal was given by
the State for twenty years' consecutive
service, and another bears the inscription,
"Awarded to Charles Ellis by the btate of
California, for long and faithful service in
the Naiional Guard." He also wears the
badge of a vetaran of tne N. G. C, and in
addition seveial gold decorations that have
been presented to him by the Guard at
various s;ages of his long career.
Ellis was persuaded to enter the Guard
by the late General Kirkham in IS6I,
when the young men used to practice in
ttie woods where the Courthouse now
stands. At that time San Leandro was
the couiity seat and the Guard frequently
marched the nine miles between Oakland
and San Leandro and back for a drill.
"I have caiefully ket)t the records of our
com:>any," said Captain Ellis to-aay,
"and in them is included much of the his
tory of Oakland. During the whole thirty
six years not a banquet, a shoot, a recep
tion or rollcall has taken place that 1
have not the record of. I have simply
lived a life of a National Guardsman and
should feel very uncomfortable out of
nnifurm. I expect to wear it until I
finally round n.y arms."
At his room in the armory Captain Ellis
has quite a museum of trophies which
figure prominently in the history of the
company. Faded pnotograpus of com
rades long tince dead hung around the
walls ana in a small chest he has posters,
menu cards, ball programmes, old white
gloves that have been used at comrades'
funerals, obituary cards and several other
trifles, each of wnich is the leading: figure
in some scene that transpired in connec
tion with the company during the last
thirty-six years.
One of the most prized pictures in Ellis'
room is that of a departed comrade, Cor
poral Bil.y Monroe. Billy â no one ever

COEEAL HOLLOW DEAL.
Repori That All the Property May Be
Acquired by a British Syndicate.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 9.â lt was re
ported to-day on what seems to be good
authority that a deal is being made be
tween the owners of the Corral Hollow
coal mine and railroad property and the
London Exploration Company.
Among the representatives in this coun
try of the London company are Henry
Butters and Captain Thomas Mem, two
men who recently returnrd from South
Africa after creating considerable noto
riety by their arrest and release at the
time of the Jameson raid.
These two capitalists made a thorough
investigation of the Corral Hollow prop
erty and reported very favorably of it, and
ai t. is time a contract is being considered
to transfer that vast property, with certain
rights of way for a railroad to Oakland,
property for terminals already acquired
in Oakl md and other valuable enterprises
assi c ated with Corral Hollow. It is un
derstood that the contract to sell has been
drawn up by the local agents and sent to
London for ratification.
The parties most interested in this deal
decline to make any statement further
than that varibus substantial people have
investigated it.

on Her Alleged Betrayer.
OAKLAND, Cai-., Jan. 9.â There was an
excitinu time in Justice Clift's court this
afternoon. Manuel Fonte and Attorney
Joseph rushed to a place of safety and the
Judge ordeied that the complaining wit
ness be searched. This was done and a
large dirk was found concealed in her
clothing.
The ca?e was one of betrayal and a girl
named Mary Anges was the plaintiff.
She bad preferred a criminal charge
against Fonte.
The trial was progressing when Attor
ney Joseph declined to continue till Miss
Anges was searched. At the same time
the defendant, Fonte, left his chair in
fear. The Judge wanted to know the
ground for defendant's fear, but Attorney
Josephs, nimseif considerably perturbed,
repeated his decision not to proceed till
the plaintiff was searched.
Tne Judge granted the request, and a
large dirk was taken from the irl's cloth
ing. To everybody's surprise the girl
stated in Portuguese, that she had brought
the dirk with Der to execute justice upon
Fonte if the court did not mete out the
kind of justice she desired.
The dirk was kept by the constable and
the trial proceeded. Miss Anges was not
cited for contempt.

REGARDS IT AS INSULT.
Assemblyman Leavitt Receive
a Resolution Passed by j
the City Council.
He Had Previous. y G.v n a Pledge
Regarding -the Same Matter to
All the Merchants.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) -
908 Broadway, Jan. 9.)
Assemblyman F. W. Leavitt has written
a letter . from Sacramento to City Clerk
ToniDkins, wbicn was received i to-day,
concern. ng bis attitude on the, bill which
; be proposed to introduce in the Legisla
ture if the people of Oakland desired that
he {should do so. In bis letter, he refers to
a resolution passed at the last meeting of
the Oakland City Council relating to the
bill of which he is the author. Mr. Leavitt
says:
"It was thoroughly understood before I
left Oakland that there would be no action
on my part concerning such a bill. It was
published far and wide through the news
papers, and I want to say now to the City
Council of Oakland or any other organiza
tion that a resolution of this kind was en
tirely out of place and could possibly have
no effect except simply to show the nar
row-mindness of the fellow who intro
duced the resolution, whose name, i am
sorry to say, is not attached thereto, or
I would write him a personal letter giving
him my views.
"This matter was settled the day before
I left Oakland, is settled now, and will be
settled so far as lam concerned. I want
that thoroughly and distinctly under
stood, and I am not desirous of receiving
any further, communication on that mat
ter from the Oakland Council, William R.
Davis or anybody else." Â â â¢ â¢ -
The day be. ore Mr. Leavitt left Oakland
he cave a full explanation to the Board of
Trade and Merchants' Exchange of his
position in the matter, which it was
thought, ended the incident. Some sur
prise was expressed that the matter was
taken up by the City Council tit its last
meeting, for there was certainly no need
to doubt that Mr. Leavitt would keep bis
pledge. The larger portion of the water
front is in his Assembly district, and be
told the directors of the two leading com
mercial bodies that he would be quid d by
their decision in the matter, as he wished
to be the representative of the district
rather than of any purely personal idea.
That Mr. Leavitt was not alone in the
plan outlined in his bill was proven by
the clear statement made at the confer
ence by John W. Britton, general man
ager of the gas company, who is also in
terested in a large section > oi the water
from owntd by. his corporation, which a
few weeks ago deeded a right of way to
the City through its property. There
were undoubtedly many good points in
Mr. Leavitt's bill, which were admitted
by nearly everjÂ»body, but the discussion
showed that at this particular time it
would -be inadvisable to touch upon any
phase of the situation that woud in any
way complicate the standing of the suits
now in the Supreme Court.
Upon this 'showing Assemblyman
Leavitt frankly told that representative
gathering thai the bill would never be in
troduced, and that the matter was at an
end. ' There was certainly 'no necessity
tor the Council to pass a resolution which
implied that Mr. Leavitt â¢ might forget
what transpired the previous day, and
his friends in his Assembly district look
on the matter in the nature of an insult.
Mr. Leavict convinced all present at the
conference that bis desire was simply to
use ail possible measures to hasten per
manent improvement on the water front,
and in view of the developmental Adams'
wharves, and the great increase oi com
merce, Mr. Leavitt was certainly justified
in his desire, and the frank manner in
which he followed the suggestions of lead
ing commercial men would have been
better treated by the Council in a resolu
tion of thanks than by one imp.ying a dis
trust for which there has not been in Mr.
Leavitt's career a particle of foundation.
OAKLAND ASKS FOR AID,
A.ameda Board o! Health Will
Reuse to Oppose a
Dairy Bill.
Miss Ruth H. bard-Is Thrown Frcm
H r Horse and Badly Braised.
The Library Opened.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 9.â The Board
of Health has received a let ier from the
Oakland board, asking it to assist in the de
feat of a certain San Francisco dairyman's
bill in the Legislature. The bill empowers
and requir-s the general agent of the
State Dairy Bureau to inspect all dairies
and creameries in the State together with
all dairy cows at least once a year, and
makes provi ion for the destruction or
segregation of deceased animals.as may be
deemed neces>ary.
City Veterinarian Carpenter, in speak
ing of the request to-day, said to a Call
representative: "We have no fight witn
the San Franci-co dairymen. We are em
powered and do kill cattle whenever we
find them witn tuberculosis. It is not al
ways safe to await the tuberculine test,
but under the i resent law we can and do
kill affl cted cattle.
"I do not know what action the board
will take upon tne request from Oakland,
but I have my doubts of its necessity. An
ordinance p:-.ssed recently by the Super
visors is all sufficieot. Under its provi
sions we are a> well protected from d iseased
meat and milk as we would be under any
State law."

Tho Marshal Says He Takes a Drink
When He Feels Like I: and

BERKELEY, Cal.. Jan. 9.â Town Mar
si. al Lloyd has made a vigorous and bitter
statement of his position in the Unda
case in the testimony of which it was
stated that he was drunk at the time he
arrested TJnda.
'"Which Is the most likely to be the
truth, the testimony of Unda and Nelson
and Matnews that I was very drunk, or
the ifs'.imony of myself, Schramm, Raw
son, Devine and Teague, one of their own
wttne ses, I leave for decision to tne peo
ple I have endeavored to serve," said the
Marshal.
"I think that they will appreciate that I
have nothing in the way of friendship to
expect from one or two West Berkeley
whisky-sellers and not much more than
hatred from those who try to sell whisky
in West Berkeley."
Lloyd charged that George Schmidt,
who is a candidate for Marshal in the
coming election, has been in>trumental
in circulating the reports regarding tho
alleged drunkenness, and said: "I hare
done more during my administration to
eradicate the aale of whisky in East Berke
ley and straightening out cercain whisky
sellers in Weat Berkeley than was done
daring the previous nineteen years incor
poration of the town, and I take a drink
when I feel like it, too, and I have no
apology to offer to my constituents for
any of my acts."
Unda was arrested by Lloyd for keeping
hi= saloon open alter midnight. He was
acquitted of tne cuarge and the Board of

him a license or not.

General Hart Describes the

The Wondrous Aerial War Craft Are

From recent press reports received
from Cuba and from private sources of in

Hart is now confident that two of the
flock of three airships said by him to have
been constructed by his mysterious and
still unknown client are in Cuba, and be
ins prepared for their work of destruc
tion.
In conversation he said he expected to
bear every day of an aerial attack on the
Spanish forces in Havana.
"I have not seen the inventor of the air
ship," said General Hart resterday, "for
some time. lam informed that he started
for Cuba some weeks ago. While lam
not in direct communication with him, I
am kept posted on his movements and in
regard to his wishes by his representative,
who is now superintending the completion
of the third airship at a secluded place
over in Marin County.
"From him I learn that just previous to
his leaving the United States, the in
ventor made a final test of his large aerial
cruis9r. He took Hight at a point in the
San Joaquin Valley, and without stop
ping, alighted in me mountains near

"Here the machine was carefully taken

near Yuma, whence it was sent by rail to
New Orleans. Tue smaller rlvin? craft

transported to Key West, Fla.
"Three days atter their arrival at the

when she had the encounter with tne

"I am certain thai the recent press dis
patch from Cuba, stating that the rebels
were preparing to-droo dynamite into Ha

information given out by the inventor.
Tbi3 was merely a ruse to cover up the
real means by which the dynamite was to

Then in a musine tone he continued : "I
feel so well satisfied that the machine is a
success that I am sorry I did not take an
interest in the invention."

Its sustaining power, he said, was an
egg-shaped balloon filled with gas, the
largtsr end of the balloon boing the iront.
To the sides of this gas body was attached
elbow-shaped sails, which were princi
pally used to control the forward direc
tion of the airship. These are so arranged
that the cruiser can sail at an angle of
forty-five degrees from the direction of
the wind. Thes* sails also serve to drive
her forward in a favorable wind. When
traveling against the wind the sails are
laid close to the sides of the balloon, so
that no portion is exposed to offer resist
ance.
From the balloon depends the airship
proper, in which are carried the machin
ery, the crew and all other apparatus
necessary to it 3 navigation and control.
This is shaped like the body of a sparrow
hawk and is equipped with wings, pat
terned also after that bird. The wings are
movable and are work a d for propulsive
power, or may be spread and made rigid
to form an aeroplane. At the front and
stern are propellers, which are u-ed only
in traveling against the wind or when de
sirous of traveling with it, but at an in
creased speed. Wh n it is desired to re
main stationary in midair the propellers
are revolved in opposite directions and
each at the necessary speed, as they work
independently. The motive power for the
wines and propellers is electricity.
In order to descend is allowed to es
cape from the balloon, and when another
ascension is made the gas in the balloon
is replenished from a supply of condensed
gas carried in a cylinder.
OIIUM EESORT RAIDED.
An Effort to Rescue a Young Girl
Unsuccessful.
An opium resort on Bush street, be
tween Kearny and Montgomery, was
raided last night by Officer Holbrook of
the Society for the Suppression of Vice
and Policeman Ingham, and William
Pickett, alias Clifford, Kittie Jones and
Emma Milton were arrested. They were
taken to the City Prison and placed in the
"tanks" pending further investigation.
The officers learned that a young girl 13
years of age had been taken to the resort
by the three prisoners, and the object of
raiding the place was to rescue the girl.
They searched the place thoioughlv, but
could not find her, and an effort will be
made to get one of the three prisoners to
tell who she is and where she is to be
found.
Picfcett is a brother of Annie Pickett,
the notorious pickpocket, now in the City
Prison on a charge of grand larceny.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
The Widow Morton's Home That Is to Be Removed at the Order
of the Board of Supervisors.
WIDOW MORTON
MUST VACATE
Supervisors Have Ordered
Her Little Home
Removed.
It Obstructs a Rich Man's Realty
Holdings on Fremont
Street.
A Deputy Superintendent of Streets
Who Did Not Relish
His Job.
________
Unless she finds other habitation in the
meantime Mrs. Ellen Morton, a widow,
will soou be deprived of the roof over her
head at the order of the Board of Super
visors.
One of the last acts of the board that
recently went out of office was to pass a
resolution introduced by J. K. C. Hobba
instructing the Superintendent of Streets
to remove a frame building that en
croaches on the roadway of Fremont
street between Bryant and Harrison. The
measure was commonplace on its face,
but behind it was a tale of hardship to a
widowed mother and her children that
would have caused the members of the
board to hesitate had they known the
facts.
The little two-story frame building is
owned and occupied by Mrs. Morton and
her children and should she be compelled
to move she knows not where she will be
able to find an abode.
Deputy Cully of the Street Department
went to the house yesterday to carry out
the orders of the board, but before he was
through be was heartily tired of bis job,
and when be returned declared that he
never wanted such a matter to handle
again.
Tne mother and children burst into
tears and made an affecting scene when
he told bis errand and begged him not to
force them to leave, but bis instructions
had been to give ten days' notice tnat tne
building must be removed and be did his
duty.
Mrs. Morton declared that she would
stay until the house was torn down over
her head because she had no place else
to co.
Ex-Supervisor Denman owns the prop
env on the north side of Fremont street
adjoining the site of the Morton home
ana has leased it to ex-Supe: viÂ«or Hobbs,
who desires to build a box-factory there,
but cannot until the building is removed.

A DUEL FOUGHT
ON AN OILSHIP
The Vessel Was Taken
Out to Sea for the
Encounter.
While off Panama the Chief
Engineer and Second Of
ficer Fought.
On the First Shot the Second O.ficer
Was Mortally Woundedâ Water
Front N.tes.
The Pacific Mail Company's fast steamer
Newport got in from Panama and way
ports promptly on time yesterday morn
ing. She brought a number of passengers
and a full cargo. White the Newport was
at Panama the French oil steamer Made
line put in. She was in a partially dis
abled condition, an explosion having
occurred during the run up the coast that
injured the machinery and killed five of
the crew. After remaining a very short
time in port the Madeline put to sea again
and again returned to Panama about an
hour and a half before tiie Newport sailed.
It was learned that a duel had been
fought between the chief engineer and the
second officer and that the latter bad been
mortally wounded. Several of the pas
sengers on the Newport were questioned,
but owing to the short time between the
return of the Madeline and the sailing of
the Newport they had no opportunity to
get name-.
The managing owner of the oil steamer
was on board the Newport en route for
this port, but as noon as he heard of the
tragedy he packed up his trunks and went
asho re. The Madeune was on her way to
isan Francisco for an overhauling in order
to go into the oil trade between here and
Payta, Peru- She can only make six
knots an hour, so it will be some weeks
before she reaches this point.
British Columbia is going into the Ha
waiian supar trade. Parties in Victoria
have purchased tue ship Fort Georga, and
on her arrival here she will be put in the
trade between Victoria, San Francisco and
the Hawaiian Islands. The Fort George
is an old trader to this port and will be a
splendid vessel for the sugar trade.
"Bill the boatman," or Bill Harris, one of
Carter's. men, and Harry B-own, a whaler
on the bark John and Witithrop, had
a narrow escape last Friday night. The
boatman was taking the whaler to his ves
sel, which was at anchor off the oil works,
when they got into collision with the
schooner Frankie K. Bill was pulling and
Brown was steering. The iormer saw the
danger and told the whaler to starboard.
The latter had snveral glasses of water
front whisKy aboard, and in consequence
put the heim to port. A collision fol
lowed, and thn two men were thrown into
the bay. Bill's face was terribly cut by
the barnacles on the schooner's bottom,
and the whaler managed to reach the
fluke of the Frankie K'a anchor. Both
were rescued and landed at Clay-street
wharf. Another boat was procured, and
Brown was put on board the John and
Winthrop in time to leave on a cruise to
the southern seas yesterday morning.
There was a small seizure of cigars on
the German ship Othmarschen at Long
Bridge. Two boxes ot cigars containing
1000 each were found in the bread case.
They were addressed to Captain Selizer
and as they were neither on the man ifest
or s;ore list Customs Inspectors Halpin
and McÃride seized them.
Her Britannic Majesty's ship Pheasant

Anita, Arch, Shag and Mission Bay
Rocks to Be Destroyed in
Turn.
It is the intention of the War Depart
ment engineers to get after five rocks in
Sai: Francisco Bay that are under certain
conditions a menace to navigation.
They are Aniia, Arch, Shag, Blossom
and Mission Bay rocks. The first three
lie westerly from Alcatraz, and being
visible high above water are not neces
sarily a danger to passing craft except in
foggy weather. Consequently theyjjre at
least a nuisance, and the Government will
do well when it blows them out ol the
bay.
Blossom Rock lies easterly from Alca
traz, and is marked with a red can buoy.
About twenty years ago it was mined and
destroyed to a depth of about twenty-four
feet at mean low water. Two decades ago
that was considered deep enough, but the
ships are eetiing deeper, and at least ten
feet more 01 water must roll over the reef
at mean low tide.
The Mission Bay Rock is a short dis
tance f ff the end of Fourth-street wharf,
and is marked with a spar buoy. It is the
most daneerous shoal in the bay, being in
the constant track of shipping. As it is
within twelve feet of the surface at mean
low and about 19 feet at highest high
water a heavily laden ship would strike at
any time. The ship Packard went on to
the rock a lew months ago and was some
what damaged.
Under the direction of Colonel Charles
R. Suter, U. S. A., supervising engineer of
the coast, a party of surveyors have been
taking soundings around these obstruc
tions with a view of making estimates for
their removal. For two months Engineer
Yon Geldern has been ascertaining the
volume of the roots and other facts per
tainme to the labor and the cost of de
stroying them. The work hns been nec
essarily slow, as nothing can be done ex
cept at slack water and. when the bay is
perfectly quiet.
When the surveys ore completed the
engineers will make "their estimates, which
will be forwarded to Washington and the
work ordered at Mission Bay and Blossom
rocks will probably be done first, as their
position makes them of the greatest
danger.
The other three will disappear in turn
pretty soon after good charges of dyna
mite are placed at their roots.
When these points are removed San
Francisco Bay will be a perfect harbor,
without a rival.

T'k HAVE not a cent to my name; will
(i HAVE not a cent to my to-night will
s you allow me to sleep to-night on
J$ that lounge
"You need not do that," was the an
swer; "here is a dollar for your lodgings."
VI am greatly obliged, but I will save
4 ihe dollar by sleeping on tne lounge and
T use the dollar for my dinner and break
fast."
So this man who was shabby and penni
less slept on a rickety old lounge in a back
office in San Francisco and (for he had no
place in which to lay his head) the next
morning said he had slept well. He
added, with a pleased look, that he had
saved his dollar. Ten years later this
shabby and penniless man, having
changed his fortunes by his own exertions
and consummate genius, received the sur
render of General Robert E. Lee, for the
shabby man was no other than Ulysses S.
Grant.
The story was told a few evenings ago
by General W. H. L. Barnes to an assem
blage of army and navy officers, active
and retired, representing the regular and
the volunteer service, mostly men whose
beards and hair have become silvered
since they threw their caps in the air,
nearly thirty-two years ago, when Lee
capitulated at Appomattox. The meeting
was one of the California Commandery of
the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of
the United States, and the occasion was
designated a? a "Grant night." Speech
making was the order of the evening, and
it all referred, to Ulysses S. Grant, wiose
portrait, enwreathed with American flags
and crowned with laurels, was suspended
over the table on which the repast was
laid.
The two principal orators were General
W. H. L. Barnes and Bishop Newman,
the one robust and atnletic, standing
erectly, his eyes sparKling with good
health and a keen enjoyment of the occa
sion; the other, equally well known as an
orator throughout the United Status, tall
o." figure, but bowed somewhat by years.
Both had new stories of General Grant,
which iÂ»Â«ve nerer previously been in
at. Those told by General Barnes
ere local and brought into the consider
ation of the characteristics and exploits of
the great military leader a racy touch of
early California. The meetine of the
commandery was held in the Occidental
Hotel, not very far from that office where
the penniless Grant, dreaming not of
fame, slept to save a dollar that he might
have enough to purchase two meals and
avoid going hungry. The occasion and
the locality gave realism to a story which,
were it not sober history, would be justly
considered as allied to Arabian romances
of the days of Al Kaschid.
"At the age of 32 years," said General
Barnes, "when he (Grant) had attained
the rank of captain and while serving
with a battalion of his regiment in Oregon,
he resigned his commission. After his
STANFORD CLASHES WITH BERKELEY ON THE SOLUTION OF LIFE'S PROBLEM
o'iF philosophy and philosophizing
Â£ there will probably be no end as
$ long %6 human civilization en
dures. Ihe what, the how and the why
will continue to stimulate inquiry into the
rationale of mental and material phe
nomena as long as human intelligence has
the liberty and the opportunity to reach
the highest wave of its inclination. The
agitation of the philosophical pool at
Berkeley by its philosophical "angel,"
Professor Howison, may not have caused
many to iave in its subtle waters for their
intellectual or spiritual cleansing, but
crowds have stood beside its borders with
interested and curious intent watching
the outcome of the mental disquietude.

From an interview recently had with the
head of the institution at Palo Alto and
one of his ablest colleagues by a Call rep
resentative a glimpse may be had at the
point of view from that thrifty seat of
learning. When asked for their opinions
on the general questions opened ud by
the discussions between Dr. Harris and
Professor Howison. both President Jordan
and Professor Hudson gave a brief but
complaisant review of some of the mooted
attitudes of the genial philosopher of the
State University. Said President David
Starr Jordan :
"I have read over as well as 1 can the re
ports of the discussion of Professor Howi
son and Dr. Harris. 1 alwa\s enjoy Pro
fess< â - Howison, for lam sure that there
are f.vu at least who know what he is
talking aboutâ himself and his Maker.
But with Dr. Harris it is not quite the
same. He often transcends all intelli
gence.
"In many regards I must agree with the
contentions of the genial philosopher of
Berkeley. Certainly, so far as we know,
the natural order of things is the only
order there is, and it is natural because it
is divine. It is the expression of the
Ahigbest, t c best, the on. y way in which
â the affairs of the universe couid be car
i.'cJ on. It seems to me, moreover, that
unique and transcendent as was the life
and death of Christ, neither were in viola
tion of the natural order, which is the
divine order as well.
"In discussions of this kind we find two
serious difficulties, the one arising from
metaphysics, the other from symbolism.

Then General Barnes, who has been

I words, running as follows:
"As I was about closing the office a
: suabbily dressed person came in and in
quired for Major Allen, quartermaster,
who had just left. I did not at first
| recognize him, but on asking if I could
' attend to his business with the major he
produced a certificate for per diem ser
vice on a court-martial, which, of course,
identified him. The certificate entitLed
| him to about $40, but it was incorractly
i drawn and virtually void, of which fac: I

! destitute of funds wherewith to pay in
' any cisc, whereupon his countenance fell
I and a look of utter despair came over it.
"He turned to leave the office, then
\ hesitated a moment and, turning back,
aslced me if 1 would allow him to sleep on
the old lounge in Major Allen's room,
I 'for,' said he, 'I have not a cent to my
' name.'. I said, 'You need not do that.
! Here is $1 for your lodgings.' Ho replied,
'I am greatly obliged, but, with your
i permission, I will use the dollar for my
j dinner and breakfast and tne lounge will

j rickety old lounge and I found him there
i when I went to the office early in the

I saved my dollar.' "

"The subtlety of metaphysical distinc-
I tions taxes to the utmost the practical

quires a speech of its own. Besides, as no

"Equally confusing to the lay mind is the
language of symbolism. All theology re
solves itseif into figures of speech. Our
ideas as to the ultimate nature and pur
poses of the Divine Being must be child
ishly inadequate. Language is crystal
lized from past experiences, and the
unknown transcends experience. Hence
we make use of symbolic expressions,
without precise meaning, but which carry
a feeling of sacredness we would not de
fine if we could. These symbols change
in meaning a3 the minds ot men broaden,
but they are never willingly discarded.
We cling to their torms with greater per
sistence than to the ideas which from
time to time they represent. In the prac
tical experience of a preacher one who

as orthodox, whatever the meaning he
may attach to them. One who tries to
carry over their significance into familiar
words is like to find himself accounted

sprung all genuine revivals of religion.
Mysticism is fatal to religion as it is to
other forms of sanity.

it accords to all others. It will not regard
miracles as an evidence of Christianity,
though it may find in Christianity an evi
dence of miracles. But whatever it may
take away from the Gospels it will not fail
to leave there the plain record of the Man
who of all men says most clearly that love
and not hate is the essence of the natural
order in human life.
"I think that Dr. Howison is right in
combining his faith with his philosophy.
Whatever a man believes he must believe
with all his might, and each thing which
is true is the truest thing in the universe.
Everything which one believes is inex
tricably connected with everything else,
and every belief will influence conduct.
It must sooner or later ail work itseif out
into action. I cannot sympathize with
those who put their religious belief into
one casKet, their scientific knowledge into
another and their philosophy into a third,
and keep each hermetically sealed from
the others. When these caskets are
opened each one will bo found empty, the
parable of the sitigie talent giving the
clew to the cause of this. What one has
ceased to believe is a minor matter. The
question is. What is his positive faith?
Kow does he stand related to the natural
order of the universe? For as his faith is
so will his life be.
"But I cannot quite follow Dr. Howison
in the method by which he seems to
reach a solution of the problem of life.
The only solution I know of is that of
doing each day and each hour the best
thing that one knows, and thus on to the
end, whatever be the number of the
worlds traversed. This is an empirical
answer and the art of life lies in finding
out day by day what is best. Logic alone
can solve no problems of life. It can givt
back as answer only what you put in it as
assumptions. Logic is the name for ac
curate workings of the mind in qualita
tive ways, as mathematics represents its
quantitative efforts. Together logic and
mathematics constitute reason, and rea
son is powerless without experience. With
nothing it can do nothing. It is not an
independent source of truth. Reason
takes what is given it and brings out the
included results. The subject-matter,
the case to Mr. Babcock. We were pay
ing the company thousands of dollars for
transportation, and I frequently obtained
concessions for officers in the way o^ free
passes for tbeir families; hence did not
hesitate to act.
"Mr. Babcock, in his prompt, off-hand
way, said. 'What do you want'? I said,
'As near a free pass as you can give in the
cabin.' He called to the ticket clerk, Mr.
Havens, and pave orders to issue a cabin
ticket on payment of the regular cabin
confused and incongruous, may become
co-ordinated and harmonious, but the
material must all be there. So far as the
reason is concerned, a universe of four di
mensions is just as real as the present one
of three. But snch a universe has not
presented itseif as a fact of experience.
"To add to knowledge is the function of
sensation. The mind is the braia in ac
tion. The brain sits in darkness without
an idea of its own, or at the most domi
nated by influences which, like itself, are
inherited products of variations adapted
to past conditions. Sight, sound, heat,
effort are all carefully kept away from the
direct knowledge of the brain. The nerves
of sense bring from eye, ear, skin, muscle,
tongue all sorts of sensations. These are
considered by the brain and translated
into impulses to action. All thought
tends to work itself into acts, and there
suit of the action is the only ultimate test
of the soundness of the logic or the truth
fulness of the sensation. Unsound logic
or lying sense 3 lead to death. The sever
ity of life is the guarantee that mental pro
cesses shall be kept true. These are the
mherited powers of ancestors who found
them effective and accurate enough for
the affairs of life. It is the fnnction of the
sifted experience of the world, which wo
call science, to make human conduct safe
and effective. And the recognition tiiat
right conduct on ot'r part is action in nar
mony with the natural order already ex
isting, 'the law before all time.' furnishes
a broad basis for the development of re
ligions ideal?. Such ideals are impulses
to action which find in the welfare of oth
ers a higher motive than in the mere cood
of self.
"The aim of philosophy is to look at the
universe without conditions. It ia to be
hold it not through the human senses,
with their narrow recognition of varia
tions in light and heat and sound. It is
'to sec things as they really are,' not as
man sees them, for so they really are not,
but as God sees them. Tnis man cannot
actually do, wherefore is philosophy im
possible.
"But the effort to do the impossible en
larges the mind and broadens tne horizon.
It enables the philosopher to iook with
fare across the isthmus, which the com
pany had to pay for each passenger,
which, in his case, was tantamount to a
free pass to New York.
"I came out of the office and announced
my success to Captain Grant, who as a
matter of course was delighted, ?s the ar
rangement left him with some little
money (sls) in his pockef; when he landed
in New York to get uome with. Having
occasion to co to the steamer again to see
some friends off, I met the captain
calmness and toleration on those who
'storming at the gates of sense' are much
troubled over the little happenings of this
too little world. The 'world with its joys,
its sorrows, its sufferings and its sins is
only a succession of experiences. The
dawn of creation never was the everlast
ing darkness, never wiil be. For him is
all eternity.' Hence it is natural that our
own philosopher should 'bear the kindest,
ter.derest eyes I ever saw with something
in them widely helpful, encouraging and
uplifting.'
"For in these eyes is the impress of the
search for truth. To search for truth is
the best we can do. The highest philoso
phy is sadly and ab-urdly human and 'the
perfect trutli is but for Thee alone.' "
Professor Henry Hudson, occupying the
chair of English literature, did not feel
inclined to go into a lengthy discussion of
the recent controversy between Professor
Howison and Dr. Harris, or their ortho
dox clerical critics, but he speke candidly
and to the purpose a few words on some
of the essential points as follows:
"I am, of course, in full agreement with
Professor Howison in his ethical criticism
of the great evangelical domna of the
atonement â a dogma which I conceive to
be doubly disastrous in its Dearines upon
character as tending first, to sap the sense
of individual responsibility, and second,
to foster the belief in the forgiveness of
sin. So far, too, as lam able to follow the
printed reports of his arguments I find
myself at one with him on the question of
the so-called supernatural elements in the
Chiistian creed. lam not, let me say dis
tinctly, at all concerned to delend the
popular thesis that a miracle â using the
woni as meaning an occurrence not to be
accounted lor by our limited knowl
edge of the processes of nature â never
could happen, and therefore never
did happen. The problem, I take it,
is not thus to be settled on purely a
prioii grounds. But I Insist, first, on
theantecedent improbabi'ity of any de
parture from the normal course of things;
second, on the consequent need for the
clearest proof of any such alleged depart
ure; third, on the notoriously uncertain
character of even the best-intentioaed and
THAT IS NOW TOR

GIVEM TO THE WORLD
(Grant) again and he showed me the nice
stateroom that had fallen to his lot, and
said:
" 'This is a ereat luxury and what I did
not expect, and I am indebted to you for
it. The prosp?ct of ever being able to re
ciprocate is certainly remote, but strance
things happen in this world and there is
no knowing.' "
With these prophetic words on his lips
Ulysses S. Grant sailed. Four year 3he
vegetated on his Missouri farm. He was
always a dreamer and always a mystery.
He failed to make a success of farming
and went to Galena, Illinois, where he at
tempted to carry on the leather business
with his father. He was clerk and shop
keeper, and delivered with his own hands
the goods that he sold. When he had
leisure he chopped wood for his own
kitchen-stove.
The Government of the United States,
when the Civil War broke out, did hot ac
cept his offer to take a commission In the
army. McClellan declined to give him a
place on his staff. He recruited an Illi
nois regiment and the Governor of that
State made him a colonel in command of
the regiment wnich he had brought into
existence. Then he became a brigadier
general of volunteers, and soon after, as
General Barnes phrases it, "this leather
dealer who did his own wash and split his
own wood, this listless, sluegish, ineffec
tive citizen upon his own motion, was per
mitted to capture Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson with 15,000 prisoners."
Amid the singular annals and reverses
of those who have figured in the world's
: history as conquerors, there is no circum
stance more striking than that of the
' man who, ten years later, was the greatest
of modern generals, coming into San
Francisco penniless and nungry and hop
â  ing, at the best, to be able to get in some
way to New York in the steerage of a Pa
cific Mail steamer, the full account of
whicn is authenticalty given in the fore
going. It ranks with the fact indicated
by Ulyses S. Grant when he is reported
to have said, recalling his early military
! training, "I had no fondness for military
| duty and went into the army because I
I thought I would prefer that to the tan
j ning business."
How the Poor
Get Their Salads
How many poor people manage to exist
in a great city like San Francisco is a
puzzling query which remains unan
swered for many people, but how a great
many of them do manage to subsist is
very easily ascertained if a person chooses
to spend a little time upon the water
most carefully recorded testimony; fourth,
on the acknowledged difficulty of sifting
the evidence forthcoming from the
early days of Christianity; fifth, on the
well-known mythojrocic tendency of the
human mind in certain stages of culture,
*nd sixth, on the gradual disappearance
of the miraculous with the progress of
knowledge and the development of scien
tific habit of thought. And I say that in
the light of these considerations the bal
ance of probability must in every case be
as infinity to one against an alleged mira
cle. The onus of proof thus resting with
the defenders of the miraculous is a heavy
one indeed, and in view of the real issues
involved in the problem one can only
smile at the ingenious inaptitude of the
argument about the rain and the grapes,
which I find set forth by an interviewer
as the utterance of one of Professor Howi
son's clerical antagonists. Moreover, it
does not stem to occur to the orthodox
apologist that for evidential purposes a
miracie, even if proved, would be value
less. Theological discussion of the rela
tion of doctrine to the supernatural at
testation of doctrine in Christian revela
tion is habitually characterized by the
fault known as reasoning in a circle.
"So far as Professor Howison's suggested
definition of Christianity is concerned, I
can only say that â waiving for the mo
ment any question of agreement or dis
agreement with the terms of his amended
declaration of faith â J view witn distrust
any attempt to force new meanings into
old phraseology. Of course it may be
urged that we have each one of us a per
fect right to define Christianity or anv
tliine else in accordance with our theories ;
but what ultimately do we gain by this
time of intellectual exertion? I dare say
that I could so interpret the thirty-nine
articles of the English church in such a
way that I might logically justify myself
in appending my signature to them. Bat
the question, surely, is not what I can
make them mean to myself, but what they
were intended and are properly to be
taken to mean. By the time we have, all
of us, undertaken to give our own defini
tions of Christianity, the word Christian
ity will have ceasedâ even if it has not
front and along the streets where the
numerous commission-houses handle the
country products. In this locality there
is to be found an actual demonstration of
the way some hundreds of families live
without the expenditure of a single cent
for their food. Most of the production of
the market, gardens, vineyards and or
chards destined for this marKet is brought
by the low-drausht, stern-wheeied steam
ers that ply the bayous and upper waters
of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers,
and these unload their cargoes mostly at
Wasbincton ana Jackson street piers. At
times these in:niense structures are piled
deep with packages from the farm, and in
handling them, which is dona in the
greatest haste possible, some portion of
their contents is sure to be emptied upon
the ground, the flotsam and jetsam of
the produce trade.
But it is rarely that any portion of
this scattering vegetable merchandise is
wasted. There is always some women or
men with baskets who are permitted,
upon the supposition of their extreme
poverty, to gather up theestray vegetable,
and very rare it is that they leave the
wharf until their baskets are rilled to the
top.
Most of these gatherers are of foreign
birth, and a very large majority of them
are Italians. This thrifty race, by en
forced experience in their own land, have
reduced the economy of living to its finest
point. They emigrate to this country
ignorant of its language or its laws, but
with habits of industry and thrift which
strike the average American with amaze
ment. Their chief ambition is to own
their own homes. The rule of large fami
lies prevails, and each one is employed in
some industry that will either produce
money or else in an avocation that will
save expenditure. The rapid accumula
lations of the Italian is thus accounted
for.
But the wharves are not the only places
where the stray fruit and vegetable is
gathered in. A hundred boys perambu
late the streets where the commission
men abound, with a sack over their
shoulders, who, with trained eye, par
ceive in the roadway the object of their
search. No matter what it may be, to
mato or sqnafh, ia it goes into tne mouth
of the receptacle, to be sorted later when
the days work is done. The amount thus
lost to the producer is great, many thou
sands of dollars a month, but it is not
wasted and reappears at some humble
table as a delightful salad covered with
plenty of olive oil and washed down by
fresh- pressed claret.
These boy scavengers are a notable class.
They are wonderfully sharp, and have
been known to till their sacKs at the ex
pense of the unwatctiful merchant, but
they are tolerated as a necessary evil and
as an interesting feature of life in a great
city.
already ceased â to have any specific sig
nification. lam not a Unitarian myself,
but I may be permitted to say that from
ray point of view there is logical and nis
toric warrant for the statement of one of
Professor Howison's interlocutors â that
Unitarianism is not Christianity.
"Upon one other matter I have a word to
offer. Professor Howison makes much of
the doctrine of the 'Divine Personality.'
This is an anthropomorphic phrase which
for my own part I am not able to under
stand. Personality furnishes us with our
highest conception of life, and therefore
we attribute the qualities of personality to
the power manifested in and through tho
universe. But such a proceduie is, philo
sophically considered, impossible. The
course of thought has been slowly elimi
nating all lower human elements from the
conception of Deity; it wiil end by elimi
nating all human elements whatsoever.
Anthropomorphic theism, even in i*.a
highest and present form, is thus only a
stageâ a stage which will presently be
outgrown. "

English Portrait-Painters and Their Work as Exhibited at the Grafton Art Galleries
Tj^ONDON, EkÂ»., Dec. 28, 1896.â 1n the
livfc Pretty Jittle blue and gold catalogue
JLm'/ of the renowned society of English
ponrait-painters there is a list of mem
bers headed by the name of A. Stuart
Wonley and concluding with that of
James McNeill Whistler. Nothing could
be more typical of the representative esti
mates of art in England. James McNeill
Whistler needs no introduction to the
small art-loving public in America. A.
Stuart Wortley, it is possible, has not been
so remarkably advcr:ised and certainly
has no equal claim either to fame or no
toriety.
Mr. Stuart Wortley. married a daughter
of Sir John Millais. Mrs. Stuart Wortley
has establisiied herself, in ihe stress of
this modern life, as a dressmaker. Not a
plain, e very-day dresMiiaker, but a very
swell person indeed, not to be addressed as
Mrs. Stuart Wortley, but as Mine. Vanite!
Mr. Stuart Wortley has iurtlier claims to
public attention. He has a remarkably
bad portrait of the Hon. Mrs. fuller Mait
land, who must be a woman entirely de
void of feminine vanity.
He has anorher portrait of a Mrs. Kep
r>el, who is tottering under a very iartre
bowl of violets, which she holds spasmodi
cally with two very fat bunds, and the
fear of dropping it has apparently siven
her the expression of feorlul anguish so
truly rendered by ;he art.-t.
However, Mr. Stuart may rest on his
laurels for a short time, for his principal
portrait is that of H. 11. H. the Prince of
Wales, riis Royal Highness is apparently
on the point of leaving lor somo state
function ; there is no other way of explain
ing his costume. He wears an Inverness
overcoat thrown back so as to show his
biue ribbons and stars and orders ; also his
knee-breeches and silk hose and patent
leather shoes. Under one arm he has a
crush-hat tucked away and in his hand he
curries a stout cane. The background sug
gests the tapestried gortreousness, with
out which it would be impossible to repre
sent a prince. Mr. Stuart Wonley* has
made of rather incongruous elements a
sufficiently dignified and manly portrait.
We do not expect very good painting and
we do not find it.
On tJie same wall is the work of such
men as Sir John Millais, Llewellyn and
Loonier. The contrast does not make one
lenient.
Mr. Whistler hassenf; only a little water

The Princess ot Wales occupies some six
feet by four, and the little rose and silver

the difference between a diamond and a
crystal as big as your list. The Vornan is
in silvery gray, with a black boa, and the

the Winged Wheel
CSPS^HE Paris Exposition is to witness |

Jlf * cycle. It will be in the form of a I
bicycle palace, one which every wheelman
who sees it will regard a? marking the |
most important recognition that the cycle j
ever received.
The plans for this remarkable structure,
which have jut been favorably consid
ered by the committee on buildings of the
Exposition Universal, are tne result of
the genius of M. Paul Lemny, a wheel
man of considerable note abroad, who has
worked upon this idea of a bicycle palace

plans and so daring his conception that
both won the admiration of the building
committee, which at first was rather
doubtful as to the practicability of the
idea. Ail sorts of schemes are submitted
t6 these people, some of them as impossi
ble as they are darinp, and at first M. Lc
may's plan was classed among these.
Investigation had shown that there is
nothing in the least chimerical about the
idea. It will, in fact, when completed, it
is believed, rank as one of the most inter
esting features. This is the first time the
idea of M. Lemay has been made public
in the United Slates.
The palace iitelf will be a remarkable
structure. The interior will not be broken
up into small apartments *o any extent,
but instead the vast space, wuich is shown
in the accompanying illustration, will be
used lor the display of the wheel in all its
as that of the Japanese artists to whom
Mr. Whistler owes ho much of his insoira
tion; but it gives the famished colorist a
new lease of life and strength to bear "the
slings and arrows" of outrageous pictures.
The chief interest in ihe exhibition cen
ters around the old family portraits of Sir

and stars and orders, but how admirably
are these "glittering baubles" subordin
ated to the grave and powerful head,
modeled simply Out with full relief; and
how s-earching is the glance of the eyes,
that seem to be pondering all the trouble
and weariness ot life and weighing it in
the balance.
The family portraits, those of his three
daughters, are not only charming but de
forms, from the first crude two-wheeled
walking machine to the delicate mechan
ism which will mark the improved wheel
at the close of the present century. Of
course, no one knows just what
that will be, but the past twelve
months show conclusively that three
years are likely to develop some won
derful improvements in the wheeling
worlu. Experts believe that the motor
cycle will eventually replace the self-pro
pelled wheel. The experiments up to
now tried with pasoline and electric cy
cles have not been sufficiently successful
to insure universal adoption, but there is
evidently reason to believe that the elec
tric "bike" is the wheel of the future and
that before long all the aifricu.ties met so
far in regard to it will be swept away.
All of the latest improvements will, of
course, be !-een in the bicycle palace, and
this fact makes the venture especially in
teresting to American*. All the bicycle
experts are delighted over the idea, and
one especially is Count Ancelo dc Julio,
who takes the createst of interest in it.
Count de Julio, who boasts a noble
ancestry in Rome, has the proud distinc
tion o: being ti.e possessor of the most
expensive bicycle in the United Stales.
Over the u-ual steel frame is a thin layer
of ebony, which is moat exquisitely inlaid

lightful examples of the finest type of
English beauty; large, clear eyes, a nose
that is delicately aquiline, the mouth
slightly too small, abundant soft hair and
a complexion of mils' and roses. The
pictures are a relief after innumerable
>hadow effects and half-light Â« ffects and
no-light-at-all effects that give the un
happy model the color of one "seven days
dead" â they are painted in fu!l, clear
light, without subtle attempts that only
one man in a thousand can render so as
to make them a joy. Sir John was evi
dently quite content with the difficulties
of painting these young, fresh faces with
truth and delicacy, without seeking for
added difficulties in the way of fantastic
arrangements of light and pose.
Monat Londan is a name comparatively
unknown in America, but he is an excel
lent painter. In England his work is
most probably caviar to the public He
cently captain of the New York Tourist
Wheelmen and is also a member of t!io
Excelsior Cycle Club. Incidentally It may
be mentioned that he acted as marshal of
the two great cycle parades which recently
were conducted in New York by two of
the daily newspapers.
There is no doubt that the Count will
attend the Paris wonder, and it is quite
possible that he may do so in an official
capacity.
The Count consented to be interviewed
in connection wiiu tho Paris bicycle pal
ace ana expressed himsell as being assured
of its success.
"There is absolutely nothing impossible
in the scheme," he said, "and it wiiJ be of
the greatest possible benefit to the wheel
ing; world. Its effect will be far-reaching.
A great many American riders will not
only visit the exposition, but they will
enter in the races and exhibitions for
prizes and compete In every way with
foreign riders and manufacturers. Amer
ican women riders will surely be there in
large numbers and will compete with
their foreign sisters."
When asked if he would go to Paris in
an official capacity, the Count said he had
not yet decided, but clearly indicated that
he hal received an offer. At all events he
will take bis famous bike there.
But no matter who the officers may bo
or who the riders to appear there, the
building itself will surely b.Â« the eighth
wonder of the worl J. Its exact dimen
sions have not yet been decided upon, but
the plans outline a structure that will ac
commodate 7000 persona on the ground
floor. There is an aim at the Gothic in
cxierior appearance of the building â that
has two d lightful portraits, one of his
wife, one of Mrs. Bowles, both painted in
flat tones and both of them representing
strong and individual types of women.
The portrait of Mrs. Bowles is hurt by
the suggestion of blossoms in the back
ground. In the insufficient lisht of these
dull London clays it looks as though the
canvas had been out in the rain and had
been splashed with mud and water.

Jules Stewart, the American Parisian,
is, as far a3 the Gothic can be produced
with the several parts of a bicycle.
The ground surrounding the structure
will be circular, with paths like spokes
leading to the common center. All the
windows are to be circular, with "spoke"
frames, and with a small colored circular
pane in the center, indicative of the hub.
The main entrance will be entirely of
marble, cut In the form of immense bi
cycle forks, while overhead will rest a
huge handle-bar of burnished steel. A
number of smaller rooms will lead off
from the main floor, separated oniy by
festooned curtains, which will be made
entirely of network as the material mcd
in the wind guard on the woman's bike.
At either end of tbe main floor will be a
monster wheel, with a tire made of the
celebrated Cook's tubing, by which arti
ficial daylight is produced. These mon
ster wheels will revoivefrom the time the
exposition opens until tbe close. Apart
from the li^ht produced in this manner,
the only illumination will be large bicycle
lamps. There will be every conceivable
construction, from the old-fashioned
"King of the road" to the latest in electric
illuminations.
Every seat in the building will be made
of parts of a bicycle, though many of
them will be so arranged as to be far more
comiorlable than the very latest in sad
dles. Curved and straight hnndle bars
will be used for bacus and cushioned
wheels in sorce cases for seats, wliile the
chairs will be beid up by different parts of
tbe frame.
The rare exhibits will be guarded from
the visitors' curious touch by a series of
sprocket chains, and the lecturers, of
and Herbart Olivier contribute studies
that are very French, very well painted,
very cold and uninteresting. There are
any number of studies, very honest and
not unsuccessful, of people trying to peer
out of the darkness.
There is a study by Mr. Will Rothen

idiotic expression, at a little statuette.

artist. Tne canvas is full of refined values
and really beautiful color.
Maurice Greiffenh age n is another brother
to the "Yellow Book." He has an im
mense portrait of a Woman in White. The
head is of the shape of a peanut, and one
arm has evidently suffered from arrested
development, or it has withered in child
hood, and "curioser and curiouser,' said
whom there will be a plentiful supply,
will travel about the building on the latest
in giraffe wheels.
Refreshments will be served by a busy
corps of attendants mounted on bicycles,
and the manner in which it is promised
these gentlemen will conduct their evolu
tions will be truly remarkable.
Each pillar of the builiiin? will be
decorated with sprockets and surrounded
at short distances by tires. Even the floor
will represent the wheel. Circular tiles
are to be laid with inlaid spokes, and the
triangles formed by the meeting of every
three circles will be filled Dy tiles repre
senting a small "bike" frame. There will,
of course, be a lively tingling of bicycle
bells, this being tht only form of signaling
that will be allowed in the building.
Every kind of bell, the silver-toned
tingle v> the ambulance-like gong, will De
used.
All the doors are to be locked at night
with bicycle locks and a number of spe
cial gensdarmes will patrol the grounds
on wheels.
Every seat in the building will be pneu
matic and be supplied with a bell. The
mam floor is, of course, to be kept clear
for the public performances and contests.
There will be only one exhibit in the cen
ter of the room. This will consist of a
number of the very latest inventions of
the bicycle world. The whole will be sur
mounted by a monster electric unicycle,
tbe invention of a Parisian electrician.
This feature is subject to chanpe in case a
more advanced invention is received.
The roof of the building will be fes
tooned, the girders being made of steel
with every conceivable part of a bicycle
woven into the designs.
The lecturers will be chosen from the
greatest bicycle experts in the world and
their discourses will enlighten the uniniti
ated and many riders of long experience
on the mystery of the bike.
Orders have already been placed in Eng
land for the manufacture of all the pot
tery to be used in the building. Every
piece will be made bicycle fashion, cups,
saucers, plates, in fact even the forks will
represent the wheel, being only two
prouged and made in the manner of a
bicycle fork.
One of the features of the entertainment
will be a bicycle carnival in which 100 ex
pert riders will take part. Rough and
tumble riding will be seen, an I an exhibi
tion given of how easy it is to be in a com
plex bicycle wreck and not get hurt.
To the rit; tit of tbe main building will
be a large room with a monster bath in
the center. In this every man who has
ever invented a water bicycle can make a
practical test of his invention, and by an
ingenious arrangement the bottom of the
bath can be made to heave, creating quite
a heavy swell, which will doubtless prove
quite a te3t for the new invention.
There is already a great demand for
space in the bicycle palace, almost every
leading manufacturer in the world being
anxious to secure a good 'Showing."
American manufacturers will be largely
represented, and it is understood that
many of the novelties will le supplied
from this side of the water. Perhaps the
principal feature will be the newest form
of water cycle, though it is by no means
sure as yet just bow far advanced these
"machines" are up to now. The formal
invitation for American representation
will be made to the Department of Stale,
for it is intended to make the bicycle
palace of such importance as to be an
event in the world's history, an I whether
or not the United States will send official
representatives is a matter that cannot
be yet decided.

The Strangest of All
Stamp Collections
CTSLHERE has jast come to light in
"Rl^v Bingharuton, N. V., the most unique
jlf^ collection of stamps which anyone
ever heard of. Not so much does the odd
ness I lie in the stamps themselves, as in
the method of arrangement. There are
862,000 of them, and they completely
cover every portion of a bedroom set, con
sisting of bedstead, dresser, commode and
chairs. The stamps are secured to the set
with the aid of glue, and then covered
with heavy spar varnish. The stamps
can be washed, in their present condition,
without injury.
This curio of collections is owned by
A Woman Philatelist's Freak.
Mrs. George Wilson of 191 Vestal avenue,
Binghamlon, N. Y. The beginning of
this strange collection dates back many
years. The first chair of the set that was
decorated was owned by a colored family
in Virginia in the middle of the last cen
tury. Gradually the chair passed from
hand to baud and from cabin to cabin
until at last it came into the possession of
Mrs. George Yancey, a colored woman,
who now lives at Ovid, N. V., enjoying
that which so seldom comes to man or
woman, the beginning of her second cen
tury of life.
This obatr is noticeable in the accom
panying illustration, which was drawn
from a photograph, by its general quaint
appearance and its particularly straight
back. It came from the banks of the
James River when Mrs. Yancey had been
given her freedom and journeyed North
to New fork State. She made a present
ol the chair to Mrs. Wiijon, and it was
with the idea of beautifying and preserv
ing the furniture that Mrs. Wilson began
decorating with postage stamps.
Since this ancient rolic of colonial days
has been adorned in the unique manner
shown in the picture, seven other articles
of furniture have received similar treat
ment, untu now the whole forms one of
the most peculiar results of the curio-col
lector's art that is extant.
The collecting of postage-stamps is some
thing in which many peraous are engaged.
Strange and unique are the forms the col
lections lake in order that they may be
properly preserved. But Mrs. Wilson's is
the queerest of them all.
Included in the tiny specimens of stamps
which conceal every vestige of woodwork
about the furniture which they adorn are
stamps from everywhere that the interna
tional postal system reigns and several
places where no exchange of mail matter
has yet been agreed upon. All these are
arranged in a manner as quaint as the idea
itself. It must not be supposed that Mrs.
Wilson's patriotism is of so 1 ght an older
that she would permit any other than the
stamps of the United States to be in the
majority. There are the faces of every
cordiaJty that is so entirely characteristi-1
caliy boyish. J
Another immortal small boy is in the
remarkably' v gorous group that has been
sent bj the painter Blanche from the
salon ol the Chumps de Mara. It repre
sents the Norwegian artist Tliaulov and
hisfarn.'ly and is painted with so much
evident enjoyment, with such a full sweep
of the brush, that each vivid head, mod
eled as Rubens loved to ao, in fall light,
has an almost human brilliancy and
power. The bead of the little boy is
painted with more reserve and infinitely
more tenderness; the large head with the
narrow little face, soft as a flower, has
more than a suggestion of delicacy. Ah a
whole the exhibition is an interesting one.
J. W. Waterhou.se has a portrait of a very
young girl that is the very personification
or youth; hardiy more than a child, the
timidity in the attitude is entirely free
from affectation, and the long, w ite
of adre-is, with the gleam of a satin rib
bon, could not have been more appropri
ately selected or more freshly painted.
Herkimer has his large, coarse, pho
tographic portraits, Wbicb grow less and
less tolerable as the years pass over the
head of that indefatigable, high-priced
and popular painter. Alma Tadema has a.
little portait with marble ornaments with
a flat face and a ereat many clothes, like
the pen-wipers that were once ideal Christ
mas gifts. E lis Koberts has his smooth
and polished dukes ana duchesses. The
Hon. Jobn Collier paints other honorable
ladies and gentlemen. There is a portrait
of Mme. Sarah Grand tliat might be bet
ter painted, and so on ad infinitum.
The new English Art Club is sternly
modern, nothing that could possibly bft
construed into a conventional canvas is ac- 7
cepted. Landscapes never beheld "on land
or sea," all black, with one ray of vivid
light illuminating nothing, or all white
against a sky all whites; people with
limbs amputated by the frames; limbs
without people, nothing could so till the
Philistines with awe and reverence. Now
and then, through an error, a perfectly
comprehensible bit of painting slips in,
but it shrinks into proper insignificance
before the deep mysticism of the other
pictures.
The general aspect of the room is that
of a laundry, in the original color
of the linen hung up is faded out of all re
cognition or is violently colored with
"bluing." Color is a thing to be used in
crude force, or to be attenuated to pale
ghosts of mist â Oriental sunlight or a
London fog â no middle path lor the new
English Art Ciub. Their theory is the
old one:

Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance.

There are stamps that journeyed about
in the crazy postal conveyances which
carried the mail that was not Uncle Sam's
during the days when civil war waged .
relentlessly. Then there are stamps of j
the days when the missives from South
ern battlefields to Northern homes
brought both joy and t-orrow, the latter
quite as often as the former. There are
one or two stamps that were used when
California was the golden pate to so
many fortune-seekers. The Nation's nis-
Tory is plastered all over this furniture,
and the story that might be told about it
if the truth were known would no doubt
make h vie in interest in the eyes of the
American people with the treasures of
Mount Vernon. the sacred relics at Sj rine
field, or those remembrances to which all
the world bows at Galena.
There is no particular method of ar- >
ranpement of this nearly a million 01
stamps. Noble and peasant are side by
side, and the commonest bit of postage
evidence is just as likely to have a posi
tion of honor as the Dig piece of pumraed
paper with two figures on it. Evidently
Mrs. Wilson believes with the poetâ that
rank is but theguinen j:amp.
Of the foreign specimens of postal
necessities, there are very many, and as
odd as they are numerous. The queer
looking dark-colored affair that comes
from the land of the Cossack and of
Tolstoi seems strangely out of plare,
Jodj;ed for life on a bit of wood in a town
where the very essence of fri'odom is in
the air itself. Properly e'nODgb, there
nestles close to the rem.nder of rhe Little
Father's country the stately and benig
nant face of her Gracious Majesty on
whose empire thesun never ses. Along
side of those two, is ihe Jolly postal
emblem of Roumania, while the Kaiser's
youthful face looks out at you from his
neighbor that once brought a letter from
the land that now is wr ncbed with the
tales of Siambouloff's assasiination.
While the fame of Mrs. Wilson's queer
collection has been limited to a certain
prescribed circle in general, it has pone
abroad a little, sufficiently so that Cornell
Uuiversity offered the lady $200 therefor,
and has several times made efforts to
induce her to accept the teruler made.
When the Btarups were received, and
they cone along in job lot', Mrs. Wilsor/
carefully washed and dried them, ar.ti
then glued them on after tne style of a
crazy patchwork quilt. She proposes t3
retain the result ol her labor, and will sell
it to no one.
Unquestionably she has the most novel
collection oi foreign and domestic stamp*
that is in existence.

Away on yonder peaceful sea,

And mountains echo them along
Till every flowered nook replies
A chorus to the murmurini; strain.

He Was Bound to
Save His Salad
i
An Alameda County man is inordi
nately fond of shrimp salad. He has the
idea â probably mistaken â that he can tell
where shrimps grow by the taste. At any
rate he buys shrimps always at a certain
place in t^an Francisco. At any hour of
thediyor night his raging appetite for
shrimps may assert itself. In a way he is
as much a slave as a victim of the mor
phine habit. Hence he carries shrimps
quite regularly across the bay, and his
wife has become equally addicted to the
crustaceous food.
Not many nights ago Caltins, the
shrimp lover, was with iwo men friends
out in the Western Addition making a
call. Knowing that it would be quite late
when he started for the boat he carried
his shrimps to the front door of the hou^e
in a bag and concealed them in a dark
corner. The call being over he looted at
his watch and saw that he must
speed or be left all night on this side of
the bay. He seizsd his bag of shrimps
and the three men raced lor California
street to get a car. Calkins is the speedier
anii sprinted ahead, but when he was a
half block in the lead he was seen to sud
denly stop and his voice caiue out of the
darkness sounding seriously vexed.
The next minuie Calkins was on his
knee?, using a piece of a box skit ma&ing
a scraping noi9e on the sidewalk. His
companions bounded past him and board
ed a car that came along just then. Tuen
they looked for Calkins, who came up on
the car platform with the bound oJ
a greyhound. In his gloved bands
he held tightly a dilapidated pa
per bag, from which torn and mangled
shrimps protruded. A stray shrimp hung
by its mandibles from the corner
of an overcoat pocket. The car wa-.
quite full and several ladies were
there who knew Calkins. A smile
Thus comes he to this lotus land,
Nor Idle is the while we slepp;
A shepherd's wand within his hand,

Across the field of stars, and when
The sheep are gone lie comes to strew
The flowers In the paths of men,
And till their cups wiih noney dew.
He flits along the vine-clad hills,
And breathes his life 10 all that grows;
The grapes with nectar wine he fills,
And points the blushes on the rose.
The drowsy poppy hears him pass,
And trembies in her golden dream;
A ripple stirs the lake of glass,
And mirrored stars a-quiver gleam.
The goMen-frulted orchards sway
In rhythm to the tuneful breeze,
The lenflets dance the night away,
And birds are cradled In the trees*

lady to another, but Calkins was frustrated
only for a minute. He borrowed a news
paper and carried the fishy wreck in
triumph home, and he had shrimp salad
before he slept as a recompense for his
trials.
Economy in the
Mining of Gold
One of the most remarkable instances of
the application of science to the industrial
art;;, and the advantages resulting there
from, is afforded by a comparison of the
methods of re.lucing gold from quartz
now and say a quarter of a century ago.
When quartz mining was inaugurated in
California, ore that ran below a common
standard of }50 a ton was committed to
the dumps as being too low-grade to
worlc. Millions and millions of dollars
of ore running from $10 to $50 a ton were
thus cast aside, and enough yet remains
to enrich the State on the deserted piles of
discarded ore from tho old mines which
were operaled many years ago.
The contrast also in the extravagant cost
of plants for hoisting ajid handling ores is
even more marked. When the Allison
Ranch mines were first opened the cost of
the plant for operating forty stamps was
fully $250,000. The mill then cave em
ployment to forty men, who were paid
wages of from $5 to $20 a day.
A new j.lant of even larger capacity was
recently placed in another mine, which
cost le3s than $30,000, with better ma
chinery and more perfect appliances for
extracting ore than the old ones, and such
is the perfection to which automatic de
vices have been applied to this class of
machinery that two men and a boy
operated all the machinery and quite as
effectively as forty men used to operate
the old style. The ore which the first
miners neglected as being too poor to be
worked is now regarded as rich enough
for the present generation. Even ore thar
runs $4 per ton can be worked by present
processes and at a profit. Years ago if 75
per cent of gold was saved, it was consid
ered a fairly good result; now a manager
cannot save from 90 to 95 per cent of
gold is regarded as not being up to pres
ent standards, and has to back out.
The perfection to whinh gold extraction
â  has been brought and the economy with
i which mining operations are now con
ducted are most encouraging. The in
! creasing gold production of the State is
j thus accounted for.
How He Kept Her
Memory Green
A most conspicuous and tender instance
; of paternai affection was I y chance brought
i to the attention of the writer a few days
'â  ago as he sat in a barber-chair patiently
' awaiting the removal of the superfluous
i growth iroru a neglected chin. While thus
! employed a man, apparently a German,
i filtered the shop and handed a razor to
| the barber, with a request that he would
put it in order as soon as possible. "And,"
. added he, "be sure and not Jose that razor.
j I would not lose that razor for $10."
Naturally the burber was curious to
| know why so extravagant a value should
i be placed upon an ordinary razor and in
quired the reason.
"Why," responded the German, "that
is the razor that the sailor tilled my
daughter with. You can see the blood
j spots upon the blade now. There they
\ are. Those black stains are ray daughter's
j blood. Tbey will never come out. My
j daughter was a good girl. Ever since she
was killed I never shave with no other
razor. I loves her so much. As long as I
live I use this razor in memory of my
girl." It is difficult to astonish an ordi
! nary barber, but this one was struck dumb
for a while. Finally he did recuperate
sufficiently to exclaim: "Well, I'll be
dangod." The statement of the owner of
thfi precious razor was fouud on inquiry to
be quite true.
Two years ago the whole water front
was shocked by the foul murder of a
young 15-year-old girl under Circum
stances of singular atrocity. Her father
was the keeper of a sailor boarding-house,
| patronized by whalers almost exclusively.
i The girl had attracted the attention of a
j half - breed Kanaka who wanted to
I marry her, but tue girl would not consent
and repulsed him with horror and dis
dain. In a moment cf jealous fury the
mad Kanaka seized the r;irl as she was at
tending to some household affairs and cut
her throat, almost severing the head from
the body. The razor about which the
j ajted German was no solicitous was the
' real, actual instrument of the crime.

There is an island in Slumber Sen
Where; the drollest things are done,
And we will sail there, if the winds are fair,
Just niter the set of the sun.
'Tls the loveliest place in the whole wide world
Or anyway, so It seems;
And the folks there play at the end of each day
In a curious show called "Dreams."
Wo sail right into the evening skies,
And the very first thing we know
We are there at the port and ready for sport,
Where the dream folks give their show.
And what do you think they did last night
When I crossed their harbor bars ?
They hoisted a plan it on a greet cloud bank
And teetered among the stars.
And they sat on the moon and swung tbeir feet
Like pendulums to and fro;
Down Slumber S*a is the bail for me,
And I wish you were ready to go,
For the dream folks there on this curious islo
Begin their performance at eight ;
There are no encores, and they close their doors'
On every one who is late.
The sun Is sinking behind the hills,
The seven o'clock bells chime;
I know by the chart that we ought to start
If we would be there in time.
Oh, fair is the trip down Slumber Sea:
cJet sail aud away we so;
The anchor is drawn, we are off and gone
To the wonderful Dream-Town show.'

The Other Or\e.
Sweet little maid with winsome eyes
That laugh all day through the tangled hair;
Gazing with baby looks so wise.
Over the arm of the oaken chair;
Dearer than you is none to me,
Dearer than you there can be none;
Since In your laughing face I see
Eyes that tell of another one.
nients, and in 'chicken feedâl iKe they'd
gone through the young ones' banks to
make it up!
"Sometimes we come across folks who
want to give us their whole personal his
tory and a gaze at their genealogical tree,
and impress upon us that although they
may be slightly embarrassed as to money
matters at the present moment, in times
past they were simply rolling in wealth
and luxury, as were their fathers and
grandfathers before them. Sometimes
we find women who are determined to
'make mashes' on us with a view, ap
parently, to a lowering of the rent. Poor
things'â they don't realize that senti
ment and business don't trot in double
harness, and that a collector has nothing
to do about the rents except collect 'em.
"Then we come up with other folks who
pay their rants all right but are con
tinually giving us a song and dance about
repairs and changes. The fences, the
gates, the doors, the windows, the locks,
the roof, and the plumbing always needs
attention, according to them, and if you
would pay attention to their complaints
and demands you would use up the rent
money, and more, too, every month in
fixing things to suit 'em and then they
wouldn't.
"Then there's folks who are always com
plaining about their neighbors and have
a continual grievance about something
that has been done or said or thought, in
the flat above, or the flat below, or in the
house next door to them. They're tar
tars, they are, and they'll make your life
a misery if you pay any attention to them.
You soon learn, though, to sympathize
With them ju9t while you are making out
their receipts, and then let them fight it
out among themselves after you have
gone about youi business. Interfering
in neighbors' quarrels doesn't pay, and
strict neutrality is a collector's rule unless
things get too steep â hair- pulling, hot
water and sueh â and then he don't take
sides or join in the fray, but simply re
ports the matter at the office and leaves
the straightening of things to the man
ager.
â¢'One of the funniest persons that ever I
met in the business was a pieasant looking
old lady who moved into one of our
bouses and paid her rent as regular as
clockwork for the first three months.
The fourth month it happened to come
around that I had to call upon her, and
when she opened the door and saw me
standing there, receipt-book in band, she
looked at me with a very set and stony
expression â a regular 'glassy eve,' you
knowâ and she says: 'What is it?'
"'Rent, ma'am,' says I, as polite as
could be, and then she bucked right there.
"'I deny the existence of rent,' she
says. 'There is no such thing as rent;
there never was such a thing, and there
never will be.'
" 'I hope it isn't so bad as that, ma'am,'
said I, for she seemed to be taking a kind
of gloomy view of things; 'times are
pretty hard all over, but I guess you'll
manage 10 raise it some way. Supposing
I call again to-morrow?'
" She fairly glared at me. 'I refuse to
accept the idea of your existence,' she de
clared. 'You do not exist: you never did
exist, and you never will exist! I refuse
to entertain the idea of your presence
here on my front steps; it is unpleasant
and unprofitable, and I am going to close
my door.' And she did.
"I thought sbe was locoed, and sent the
head collector up to see about her, but by
the time he got around â two or three days
laterâ she had dug up some cash and pata
the bill like a little man. Come to find
out, she was onty one of those jcienliric
people who believe in 'affirming' and 'deny
ing' things just as the notion takes 'em, and
she was just practicing her principles on
me.
"When we get hold of tenants who are in
real distress it comes a little hard to slip
those yellow billetdo'ux under their
doors, but we can't help it, for we have our
orders and must carry 'em out. A great
many people are inclined always to blame
the agents for the cases of hardship which
now and then come to light, but in 99
cases out of 100 the agent is not at all
to blame. It is the owner who stands be
hind him and giveÃ the ordersâ the agent's
business is simply to carry them out.
'â¢Ever read 'Little Dorrit'? Well, that
saphead of a Flora Finching's father is a
pretty eood picture of some property
owners. They Jook very pious and benevo
lent, but if some Panks would cut their
hair off, figuratively speaking, you'd be
astonished at what you would ccc.
"About the worst place to collect in is
Chinatown. We have to do our collecting
up there in the evening to catch our ten
ants at home, and we have to go up there
three or four strong or we'd get wiped out
completely.
"The other night three of us went up to
one of those big beehives, and we got
along all right until we came to one door,
and when we knocked th^re a Chinaman
opened it a little ways and began chopping
at us with one of the ugliest and wickedest
lookine cleavers that you ever saw in your
life. That was his gentle and innocent
way of suggesting to us that lie didn't feel
inclined to pay any rent that evening â
was a little shy on specie, and would pre
fer to have us call again.
Here where the firelight softly glows,
Sneltered and safe and snug and warm;
What to you is the wind that blows,
Driving t he sleet of the winter storm?
Round your head the ruddy light
Glints on the gold from your tresses spun;
But deep is the drifting snow to-night
Over the brow of the other one.
Hold me close as you sagely stand,
Watching the dying embers shine;
Then shall I feel another hand
That nestled once in this hand of mine.
Poor little hand, so cold and chill,
Shut from the light of stars and sun,
Clasping the withered roses still
That hide the face of the sleeping one.
Laugh, little maid, while laugh you may!
Sorrow comes to us all. I know;
Better perhaps for Her to stay
Under the drifting robe of suow.
Sing while you may your baby songs!
Sing t'.ll your baby days are done!
But oh! tiu none of the heart that longs
Day and night for the other one!

"We understood him well enoueh, but, as
he came near shaving the arm off the fel
low next the door, we all three made a
rush at him. One of us hit him in the eye
and knocked him inside his den, and then
we took the cleaver away from him, and
while the heaviest fellow sat on him to
keep him from being too fractious the
others went through his outfit to see what
other weapons he had in stock. He
begged like a dog before we got through
with him, and promised all manner of
thinss if we'd only stop using him for a
divan and go away peaceably, and at last
we let up on him.
"The next day he came around to the
office with his eye in a sling and paid his
rent as pleasant as pie, and when the
manager asked him about the matter he
just said: 'Me foolee littee; Melican boy
foolee neap too muchee. Me no foolee
'gain, you bettee ahoe-stlings!' And I
don't believe he ever will â at least not
with that particular set of boys.
"Rent-collectors don' t have time to stand
round and let the grass grow under their
feet. I can tell you. It's a rustling and
hustling kind of a business, and the fel
low who can't rustle and hustle has got to
drop out. The first and fifteenth of the
month are our specially busy times, and
often I have collected and given receipts
for over 300 rents during a single day. It
makes a pretty big and heavy bag of specie
before I get through, but so far I've
managed to get it into the office safe
every time.
"Risky? Well, yes; of course there's
always a risk tnat some one may spot and
trail you, but you can't be guaranteed
absolute salety in any business. Every
one of us collectors is well armed, and we
know how to use our weapons, too, or we
shouldn't be riding round in these nice
little carts of ours."

y\r\ Old Wedding-JRing.
What a symbol of love Is that circle of gold,
By the token of which our devotion was toldl
How our youthful affection shines out, as it
seems,
In the light of the romance around it that
gleams;
And it knows no beginning or ending, or why
Its continuing course should not run till we
die.
And a sign and a seal of our reverence, too,
Had a part in our creed when that old ring
was new,
When a slender, light hand was upraised to
our lips
And our kisses were pressed on its slim finger
tips.
For that circle- of gold seemed a hallowing
pledge
Of a homage profounder than words dared al
lege.
But the metal that's purest wears quickest
away,
And that old wedding-ring has grown thinner
to-day ;
Yet the hand which It graced graces It in its
turn
With a magic the alchemist vainly would
learn.
For sweet charity's touch has so filled it with
gold
That that hand never lacked to the hungry
and cold.
And the summers may come and tbe sum
mers may go,
And the winters m<iy whiten the hair with
their snow;
Still the hand which a lover delighted to kiss
Wears the signet of half o? a century's bliss,
And no earnest of joy in the heavens above
Is more sure than that ring and its cycle of
love.
W. D. Ellwanger, in New York Sun,
IDYLS OF THE FIELD.
How beautiful the storm has been !
Half an hour ago the sky was dark and
frowning, and the rain descended â  tor
reniially. Now the silver drifts are mar
shaling out to sea, and the sun is touch
ing everything into cheer. The soaked
earth breathes out fragrance; the wet trees
sparkle rain bow- wise; and the whole
world looks dripping and sunshiny, like
a good baby smiling through its tears.
We are Having a singularly forward
springtime. The first catkins showed on
the willows a week ago. The poppies have
a good start, and in one of my rambles the
other day I found the broduea thrusting
up tiny baby fingers through the grass,
and the Idrage plants of the hillside are
already well-grown, sweet and nutritious.
A blacK-and-yellow-winged butterfly, that
for two months past has lain apparently
lifeless on a window ledge in my study,
yesterday spread his wings and tooK flight
across the room, and I saw, only yester
day, what looked like a white-crowned
sparrow, perched high above my head,
but whether he was a new-comer or a
lingering winter guest I have no way of
knowing.
Last summer while the hillside was bare
and brown a road was cut along it, the
plow going deep to lighten the heavy
grade. In some places the bank was cut
down several feet. The land has been
in cultivation for years. Successive crops
of barley and oats, potatoes, and of late
years persistent Canada thistles have
covered it, but now from the cut bank
along the edges and even in the middle 01
the seldom-used roadway a luxuriant
crop of ierns has sprung up. Whence
have they come, one wonders. It seems
hardly possible that the spores have been
dormant during all these years that have
elapsed since these smiling hillside fields
and orchards were the mossy, wet, laurel
grown sides of a canyon througn which a
sparkling stream rushed down to join the
great waters of the bay. But nature car
ries on wonderful processes in her great
laboratory. She is infinitely variable and I
suspect that with all our wisdom we are
yet as far as ever from exhausting her re
sources. Was it not when Franklin flew
his kite and coaxed the lightning from
the sky that some wiseacre declared his
conviction that discovery had probably
reached its ultimate limit?
Here upon the gray, moss-grown rock
where 1 am fitting a little lizard has
crawled out to get a brief sunning. He
sees me, but is too torpid with cold to be
frightened. I can even take him between
my palms, that the little chill-blooded
fellow may grow warm therein, without
causing him any apparent alarm. He
does not get warmer to the touch. I do
not think these little lizards ever do, but
he comes gradually out of his torpor. He
turns his head quickly from side to side,
watching me with his sparkling jewels of
eyes, ana his throat Degins to pulsate, al
ways a siern of excitement in the lizard.
He is warm enough to think now, and he
evidently thinks about getting away if
he can only rind a way of escape from this
queer corner where he lies; so I open my
Hands and he flashes forth upon the rock.
In nearly every order of life we find
some small specimen that, Dy reason of
its beauty and harmlessness, seems to
claim and win exemption lrom the harm
that usually besets its kind. Among the
birds the little hummer charms and de
lights us by its winning, learless grace.
What the humming-bird is among its
kind the Douglass squirrel always seems
to me to be among animals, and some of
the dainty little lizards among the rep
tiles.
My small friend of the rock I ere is as
graceful in his way as any humming-bird.
Indeed there is something very birdlike
in the bright, fearless way he regards me
as, with lifted head, he seems to listen as
well as to watch for furtherdevelopments.
If I were to move he would suddenly
whisk into some cranny and continue to
watch me, but I questir-i if he would be
greatly alarmed. I cannot understand
the shuddering horror with which some
people regard the whole reptile tribe. .As
a matter of fact most of its representatives
are harmless and many of them are very
beautiful. For my own part I question
whether the ancient story of the serpent's
bad behavior in Eden is the real explana
tion of our dislike for all crawling crea
tures. The human dread is probably
a survival of the terror which our pre
historic arboreal ancestors felt for their
nereditary enemies, the snakes.
Yet, singularly enough, these creatures
are very friendly inclined toward hu
manity, once they make our acquaint
ance. There is no branch of the various
lizard families a member of which in
captivity does not corce to know and take
some sort of interest in the human being
with whom it is associated. Theirs is
not cupboard friendship either, for they
are as nearly independent of food as living
creatures can well be, and can subsist for
months without nourishment. Even the
horrible-looking Gila monster is not with
out susceptibility to kindness.
A young girl of my acquaintance once
had one of these objects for a pet and for
months handled it, fed it and cared for it
daily. It never resented familiarity, even
when roughly handled. Had it done so
the result might have been tragical, for,
popular assertion to the contrary notwith
standing, the Gila monster is unquestion
ably venomous. I have repeatedly seen
the fact contradicted in Californian publi
cations, but the creature has a well-devel
oped poison apparatu?, and scientific an
nai* show plenty of instancesof the death
dealing power of its bite.
There is no other poisonous lizard,
however, known to science. Tae horned
toad, which is not a toad at all, but a liz
ard, is a startling enough looking
chap, but he is harmless, intelligent and
even capable of becoming attached to a
human being.
The little green, blue and gray lizards
so common about our rocka and trees nre
very useful members of society and should
never be harmed, for they do great good
as insect-destroyers. The small creature
at my band, here, just ran out hi 3 light
ning-lifce tongue and gathered in a scurry
ing bug that had ventured out across the
rock. Evidently friend lizard had for
gotten me for an instant, but, as if sud
denly recollecting me, he gave a little
start and then disappeared. I winked
hard in my astonishment. Had ho the
â¢**. sÂ«snr LARG3
recipe for fern aesd? Did he walk invisi
ble? But, no; lie had not stirred. He
had only become absolutely motionless.
There is something very wonderful in
this power of the small, wild creatures to
keep still. We noisy, restless humans,
who have it not, find it hard to under
stand, and when, by reason of it, the
woods dwellers become invisible to us we
talk wisely about their changing color.
My little lizard has not changed a whit.
He is still a delicate, beautiful grayish
green, but so still is he, so flat and motion
i less against the rock, that did I not know
I he is there he might wholly escape obser
r vation. So a bird will lie low among the
moss ana leaves, and you, looking for
her, will pass unseeing; a snake coiled
along a branch will escape observation,
not because he is like the branch, but
because he keeps still. Forest dwellers
know this and those vetsed in woodcraft.
An acquaintance of mine, who has ex
perimented not a little along this line,
tells me that he has frequently sat niotiou
( less in a streetcar, keeping even his
I thoughts, by a sheer effort of will, away
from himself and upon outside matters,
and that under these circumstances he ia
almost invariably overlooKed by the con
ductor on his fare-collecting rounds. I
do not throw this out as a suggestion to
would-be free passengers, but the idea is
I not without a certain psychologic sig
i nificance whether its relations are clear to
us or not.
The lizard would have small chances
j for safety were it not for his protective
coloring, which really changes very little,
and for this trick of quietude, for he has
no means whatever oi self-defense. His
little teeth could hardly scratch the deli
cate skin of a baby, nor does he ever seem
to think of biting when captured. Some
of them have a queer power to shed their
tails when caught, and as their tails aro
by far the loneest part of them and con
tinue to wriggle and move for some mo
ments after separation the effect of this
maneuver is startlingly as if the creature
had broken in two. But while the foe is
triumphantly eating the tail the lizard
makes good his escape and grows another
caudal appendage. It is this habit of
some lizards that has given, rise to the
popular belief in a reptile called the ylass
snake, that has the power to drop into
fragments when attacked, and to reunite
I the pieces when the danger is over. The
glass snake, however, is only a very harm
less variety of lizard â the blind worm of
| England and of the Southwest. He is not
even blind, but, like all hÂ» tribe, has very
bright and useful eyes, which do him far
better service than our own eyes are apt to
whenever we take our walks abroad.
Daring Ride of
an Athenian Girl
Miss Marrowfat lives in Oakland. That
is not her name, of course, but it will do,
because the title cloaks a real identity.
She has the intrepid spirit of Hannibal in
Italy, Napoleon crossing the Alps, Cccsar
in Britain, Bolivar battling for liberty,
Grant in the Wilderness and Dr. Mary
Walker â air in one. She would certainly
not shrink from taming lions alongside of
and in competition with Mrs. Captain
Daniel Boone, and probably would not
shriek if she saw a mouseâ if it had a
string tied to it. "Fear," she contemptu
ously says, "belongs to the weaker sex,"
meaning man.
This story is about her daring ride on a
bicycle, an up-to-date Al wheel, with
all the modern fixings and appurtenances,
a wheel to depend upon in an emergency.
The deck officer of one of the Oakland
ferry-boats had signaled to go out from
the pier at the foot of Market street, one
day the past week. The boat started to
move at the customary rate toward the
Athens of the Pacific. Seemingly all the
passeneers were on board, but no, just as
the wheels be?an to turn Miss Marrowfat
appeared, riding her trusty wheel directly
toward the boat. Her small feet moved
regularly and speedily.
"Hi!" said a warning shout.
"Stop!" yelled a deckhand.
"Turn back!" groaned an excited pas
senger.
Miss Marrowfat never turns back. On
she went at headlong speed across the
apron of the slip. She was off her wheel
and leaping boldly in the air in a second.
An impetuous deckhand seized her wheel,
leaping for it An equally impetuous
deckhand seized her person to prevent her
from falling. To the two decknands she
turned with a sweet smile and thanks.
Her hat was on a little awry, but she only
smiled. Her hair was rumpled, but sha
did not frown. Her face was flushed, buc
she was not annoyed. Sne was as cool as
Sheridan on his Winchester ride.
"Gosh !" said a bystander, "but she is
an an eel !"
"A bur-r-d is wnat 1 call her," responded
the officer of the deck. She will long be
known to the crew as the young woman
who could not be prevented from catching
her boat by fear of a dip in the bay.

ARC LIGHTS FOR
THIRD STREET
There May Be Seven Twin
klers Upon Every
Block.
Property-Owners Are Actually
Moving lor Needed Im
provements.
Merchants' Association Wishes to
Have Paving on G^ary Street
Laid at Once.
It is the firm belief of those property
owners who have signed the agreement for
the better lighting of Tnird street that their
property will thus be greatly improved.
In some instances property-owners hav
ing vacant lots eipect to erect new build
ings. Third street is the outlet to the
Potrero and is the inlet to the City of most
visitors who approach it by the railroad
entrance from the south. As soon as Fol
som street, between Third and Sixth, ia
paved, Third street will be one of the
main entrances to the main boulevard of
the Mission.
The property-owners along Third street
do not believe in going half way in the
matter of lighting the street. They desire
to have six arc lights installed upon each
block and one at each crossing. To ac
complish this result it is necessary to get
the co-operation of all the property-own
ers along the street. Until sufficient sie
natures are secured the canvassing com
mittee will not give the order for lights.
As soon as they are secured the order will
be given for seven electric arc lights of
2000 candle-power upon each block.
The contemplated lighting of Third
street with electric lights has awakened
great enthusiasm among the property
owners along that thorouchfare. The
committee, consisting of W. S. Hughes,
\V. Hendrickson Jr., Sylvain Levy, Hugo
D. Keil, Gerson Harsball and Mr. Meuss
ilorffer, all property-owners, have met
with gratifying success in securing the co
operation of the following well-knpwn
property-owners on Third street.
Mrs. Snook, Hugo D. Keil, H. Levy, Gustave
Marshall, James Conlin, Michalitschke Bros.
& Co., Charles Josselyn, Thomas Jennings, B.

Sufficient subscriptions having been re
ceived from the. property-owners, the
Merchants' Association has also sent a
communication to the Board of Snper
visors requesting that the block on Geary
street between Grant avenue and Stockton
street should be repaved, in accordance
with the resolution recently passed by the
board. This makes the third block so far
ordered repaved by the association.
One of the main questions that will be
discussed at the quarterly meeting of the
Merchants' Association on Thursday
evening, January 14, at Academy of
Sciences Hall, will be the consideration of
the best method of securing an improved
system of seweraee for Sun Francisco.
Din inherited Her Niece.

In Old Madrid
I^jr-.ADRID is but a few miles distant
Ji^/ jij from a large white stone, which is
JlJ'vl^ supposed to be in the exact
geographical â  center of Spain. It has
400,000 inhabitants and one of the worst
climates on the habitable globe.
It is doubtful if any other city in the
world presents such a striking cotnbina
tion of misery and magnificence. Though
not, as a rule, in particularly good repair,
many of its public buildings are most im
posing â none more su, perhaps, than the
royal palace, at present occupied by
Queen Regent Maria Christina and her
interesting family. The Spanish court is
and always has been noted for its Oriental
glitter, some of its ceremonies being
dazzling in their brilliancy. I witnessed
none more interesting than that of Palm
Sunday, when the Queen passed through
the corridors of the palace on her way
from the royal chapel, accompanied by
church and military dignitaries and mem
bers of her court. The pontifical robes
*vere gorgeous in the extreme, those of
the Queen and court â showing every color
of the rainbowâ being literally studded
with precious gems. Through fear of
bomb-throwing anarchists the number of
invitations to it was, I remember, cut
down from 2000 to 400.
The royal stables contain something
like 300 horses and mules. Many of the
finest animals are, however, imported
from England, Germany or France. Some
of the royal coaches are truly magnificent,
especially those of previous reigns, a
dozen or more of which are still care
fully preserved.' The royal armory, too,
at the palace contains many interesting
relics of the days of chivalry. The court
end of the city is fairly weil kept and con
tains many handsome blocks of six and
seven storied residences. This section also
contains the major portion of the more
noteworthy public buiidings. In the
dense'y settled portions of the city, too,
ieemiagly lost in labyrinths of narrow,
crooked streets and passageways, one fre
quently comes upon handsome old family
residences, still kept up, at least out
wardly, with more or less of their former
magnificence.
There is, perhaps, no more firm believer
in noblesse oblige tnan the high-born
Spanish gentleman. He must have his
carriage and horses, even if his table suf
fers, and that there is much of Â«uch aris
tocratic poverty in Spain to-day there can
be no doubt.
One of the busiest squares in Madrid is
the Puerto del Sol (Gaie of the Sun). The
plaza is thronged with people at all hours
of xhe day and night, and nothing im
presses the stranger more at first than the
mania of the people lor smoking cigar
ettes. They are smoked on the streets, in
the shopsâ in fact, everywhere â by army
officers, clerks, policemen, car conductors
and bejrgars, and are largely consumed by
womei in the privacy of their homes. If
the inhalation of cigarette smoke is ter
ribly injurious to body and brain, as it un
doubtedly is, why need we look further
for a causa of national enfeeblement and
aecay?
Many little shops scattered over the city
are devoted exclusively to the sale of
the national lottery tickets, and the latter
are hawked on the streets at every turn.
I cannot think, however, that the people
are seriously injured by any money they
obtain from the lottery after the Spanish
officials pet through handling it.
On and about the plaza are a few hand
some, well-stocked stores, but the number
is limited, most of the city's retail busi
ness being done in small shops on very
narrow ami crowded thoroughfares. lam
reminded, in this connection, of a sign
over the door of one of the most centrally
located m'llinery shop?. It read simply,
".Mibericordia," meaning mercy or ciem
e;icy. Thougn my information on the
subject is limited, I have been led to be
lieve that this sentiment is not commoniy
associated with such establishments in
this country.
Mules, many of them clipped in a fan-
tastic manner, and donkeys are used al
most exclusively for heavy work of all
kinds, and now and then handsome car
riage mules are seen. Diminutive don
keys are almost Invariably used as leaders
in heavy teams on accornt of their su
perior intelligence and because of the fact
that they are much less easily discouraged
than either horses or mules. As can, per
haps, be imagined, the effect of such com
binations is decidedly ludicrous.
Some of the equipages of the nobttity
are of the mos' elaborate description. A
four-horse barouche that attracted my at
tention at the races had two outriders in
green satin jackets, gold caps, white
breeches and top boots, while the footmen
were" resplendent in red plush knee
breeches, dark green coats, stockings of
a lighter green, with crown clocks, pumps
and tall silk hats, with red cockades.
Church edifices are to be seen on every
hand, and the solicitude of the Deople in
regard to their souls is further attested by
the numerous little shops devoted exclu
sively to the sale of candles, rosaries,
breviaries, et<\ Many little shops, too,
are devoted, during much of the year, to
the sale of iocs, made either of chufas
(small roots, grown in the vicinity of
Valencia) or rice. Both of these confec
tions are extremely calatable and refresh-,
ing, and a large glass of either being
served for the equivalent of about 4

As from time immemorial the funerals
of the city are moat imposing. la one I
observed the hearse was drawn by six
stallions, and accompanied by as many at
tendantsâthe latter in knee breeches and
cocked hats. Jet black was the prevailing
hue, relieved oniy by the powdered wics
of the attendants. In another, gold and
black were the prevailing colors, the at
tendants wearing dress coats, knee
breeches, tall hats with broad bands
and cockades and white stockings. At a
child's funeral the hearse gold and white,
was drawn by four black horses with im
mense white plumes on their heads. Two
attendants on each side wore white coats
lined with red, blue knee tyeeches, white
stockings, cocked hats and powdered wies
âthe whole forming a singularly brilliant
spectacle.
There are few more interesting sights in
the city, from an antiquarian point of
view, than that of a burrero, or ass-keeper,
making his rounds in the early morning
hours. The asses, four or five in number,
are milked at the doors of the customers â
one of them, as a rule, being ridden by the
burrero in making his rounds. The milk
is much sweeter than that of cows, ana is
claimed to be of especial value for con
sumptiyes. Large herds of goats, too, are
quartered in the very heart of the city,
being driven to suburban pastures in the
morning and returned at night.
At an early nour every morning tnore is
a grand coffee-roasting in front of each of
the many cafes, the coffee being usually
inclosed in a huge iron ball or cylinder
and slowly revolved over an open fire.
Not a bean escapes tne wily attendantâ it
goes bark among its fellows, even if ac
companied by a modicum of sand and
dirt.
In fart, little of value remains long on
the streets of the Spanish capitalâ the
ends of cigars and cigarfrt.es (finding a
ready sale at the tobacco factories) being
sought for with especial eagerness. To

bacco, to consumers, is both high in price
and Villainous in quality. The right to
sell and manufacture it is sold to private
individuals, no one being allowed to even
plant it without a special act of the Cortes.
There is hardly a newspaper in Madrid
worthy of the name. The best of them,
perhaps â the Iraparcial â would not take
second rank in an American city of a hun
dred thousand inhabitants.
Venders of flowering plants are numer
ous, their heavily laden little donkeys re
sembling flower-gardens.
The short, vest-like jackets, curiously
arranged back hair and broad-bnmnied
hats of some of the passers-by betoken their
connections with the national pastime,
bull-fighting, and there is a sprinkling, too,
of cowled and sandaled monks and Anda
lusian peasant?, the latter in conical
black hats, slashed knee breeches,
more or less white stockings and sandals.
The people, as a nation, live poorly, the
diet of the lower classes consisting chiefly
of gabantbas (small beans), tortillas, or
cakes of various Kinds, fresh vegetables
and garlic. Meat is only within reach of
the more wealthy. There is not a single
restaurant in all Madrid that would be re
garded as even second-class in any other
European capital.
Referring to some centuries before the
Christian era, Spanish history tells us that
when any individual was afflicted with a
serious disease he was seated on a public
thoroughfare "that the passer-by might
have pity on him , and bring with him
such remedies as had been proved effica
cious in similar cases." This ancient cus
tom doubtless accounts for the frightful
specimens of wrecked humanity to be
seen in Madrid to-day. It is not unusual
for one of them, if able to navigate with
sufficient rapidity, to take the middle of a
narrow thoroughfare and work the passer
by on both sides, going both ways, and
they are particularly numerous and im
portunate about the doors of churches and
other 'public buildings. My sympathies
were at first quite easily aroused, but be
fore leaving the city my rule was to give
only to those who were both armless and
legless, with a slight preference for those
who were also diseased and blind, and I
found even this a severe drain upon my
resources. *
At the tneaters, of which there are sev-
eral, entertainments are usually divided
into three or four funcior.es, or parts, for
each of which latter a separate ticket is re
quired. It is possible therefore to see a
single act of a play, or portion of an enter
tainment, at a very small cost. The peo
ple generally being much addicted to late
hours and an irregular manner of liv
ing, thousands purchase tickets simply for
the last part of an entertainment â lasting
from say 11 p. m. until midnight The
cazuela, or upper gallery, is for women
only.
In view of this latter fact many readers
will doubtless agree that "Paradise," the
name applied to that gallery in France,
would be far more appropriate.
The lace mantillas of song and story are
still much worn by women of the lower
and middle classes, though by far the
greater number go bareheaded.
The men of these classes are still very
fond of enveloping themselves in huge
capas, or cloaks (which nave anything but
a pleasing effect when worn, as they often
are, in conjunction with more modern at
tire), but the gente fina, or gentlefolks,
now very generally take their fashions
from Paris.
People of the lower classes still unite, at
times, on the street, and sing, monoto
nously, the epic-lyrical national songs,
immortalizing distinguished warriors of
the middle ages; and, now and again, a
crowd gathers to listen to the weird, wail
like singing of some little street arabâ
seated, cross-legged, on the pavement.
Serenos, or night watchmen, each carry
ing a lantern swnng on a lone staff, lock
up roost of the larger buildings at an early
hour â after which time one is liable to
experience no little difficulty in fretting
into his own domicile; for, while the
sereno may be close at hand, he is quite as
liable to bs several blocks away. Among
the countless other ancient customs which
are still adhered to may be mentioned the
carrying of wine in goatskin bags (botas),
the fetching of water from public fount
ains, by the women, in huge jars, and the
employment, by the uneducated.Jof escri
torios publicos, or public letter writers.
How well these latter are.patronized may
be judged from the astonishing fact that
of the nation's 18,000,000 of people rather
more than three-fourtus can neither read
nor write!
The policy of the Government being ex
clusion to foreigners, the people gener
ally seem to be almost totally unaware of
the existence of any other country, save
France, and one bright Madrileno, upon
learning that I came from North America,
immediately jumped to the conclnsion
that I was a Mexican. C. F. Davis.
BLAMES IT ALL ON HYDE
Charles H. Hawley Answers the
Criticisms of the Schcol
Board.
Declares That the Late Board Were
Not Treated Right by the Audi
tor and Supervisors.
Charles H. Hawley, chairman of the
Finance Committee' of the late Board of
Education, takes exception to the criti
cisms of members of the new board. He
says it would be much wiser if the new
board waits until it gets into harnes3 itself
before it begins to pick flaws with the last
administration.
Hawley declares that the criticisms
really emanate from F. A. Hyde, former
president of the board. He says Hyde has
been reading statistics of the schools ten
years ago to everybody who would listen
since he got out of office, but tliose statis
tics were never heard of while he was in
office, yet the administration which he
controlled spent more money than did
the succeeding administration. Hawley
offers to prove this with the following
figures: In 1891-92 (Hyde administration)
the scUool appropriation was $1,066,241. of
which $580,000 was from the State, $10,000
from rents and $746,241 from Ciiy taxes.
The (ax rate for scholars was 15.6 cents on
i he $100.
In 1892-93 (Hyde administration) the
appropriation was $1,090,000, of which
$580,000 was from the State, $10,000 from
rents and City tax $500,0C0. The tax rate
was 14.71 cents.
In 1893 94 (succeeding Hyde) the appro
priation was $1 ,000,000, of which $628,000
was from the State and $372,000 from rents
and City tax. The iax rate was 10.95 cents.
In 1894-95 the appropriation was $1,000,
--200, ol which $600,000 was from the State
and $400,200 from the City. The tax rate
was 12. 10 cents.
In 1895-96 the appropriation was $1,000,
--200, $600,000 from the State, $390,200 irom
the City, $10,000 from rents; tax rate 12.19
cents.
In tnis year, says Hawley, the general
tax rate for the City, $2 25, was the high
est ever levied, and yet the schools got no
more, although a deficiency was staring
i be Loard in the face from the beginning,
a deficiency thai can be made up in no
other way than from the teachers' sal
aries.
The new levy, 1896-97, is for $1,000,000,
with $200,000 for the Mission High Schooi.
Of this $630,000 is fron. the State, $325,000
is from the City taxes and $45.0U0 irom
rents. The tax rate for schools is 9.85
cents, nearly 20 per cent reduction. The
City tax has beeu reduced from $500,000 to
$325,000; $30,000 has been added to the
Auditor's guess of what the State allow
ance will De, which is simply a loss of
$30,000 to the school fund, as it is counted
in Dy the Supervisors in making their esti
mate, and $35,000, the rent of the Lincoln
School lots, heretofore handled by the
Board of Supervisors for the schools, has
been put in the fund, cutting it that much
and making altogether a loss of $130,000 to
the board over the sum supplied to and
consumed by the Hyde board.
The present cr.ticism has been occa
sioned directly, says Hawley, by Mayor
Phelan's message, in which he uses those
figures of ten years ago. The scheme of
education has been expanding since then,
lie says, a great many new and expensive
fads having been introduced, all of tnem
by Hyde, such as coofcing, manual train
ing, physical culture, etc. These are ail
well enough if additional money is sup
plied to provide for them, but they have
been added to the expense and they eat
up the funds without the money being
provided. That is where the trouble is,
lie says. He blames the Auditor for cut
ting down the estimate on which the levy
is made, and then charging the school
board for tlie responsibility for the deficit
which was certain to result. The Auditor
added $30,000 to his estimate of the year
before, as the sum to be secured Irom the
Stateâa sum that is never known until
the end of the year. The first half in
stallment has just been received and in
stead of being greater than the year be
fore it is $17,000 iess.
"During the past year," says Hawley
in conclusion, "the outgoing Board of
Education hasexpended in new buildings,
repairs, painting and whitening, etc., the
sum of $125,000, every dollar ofwbich was
actually necessary. The following are a
few of the principal items: Finishing the
Dudley Stone School, $15,000; new Bernal
Heights School, $26,000; n w bulkheads,
$16,000; sanitary clo-ets, $17,000; whiten
ing and painting schools, $14,000.
"Since the beginning of the present
term the Board of Education has opened
four new evening schools which contain
nineteen new classes, all in a flourishing
condition.
"The average cost per pupil on the num
ber enrolled for the past year was about
$25 per year, or & trifle over $2 per month
for each pupil."

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
A sense of humor is good.
The Examiner declares itself funny.
Slandering California is Hearst's idaa of
fun.
The boodle organ boodles as a merry
jest, '
Supporting Per Kins is a faker's joke on
the State.
Where there is humor without dignity
there is only a clown.
"Mocking at decency," says the slum
panderer, "is true humor."
Charging legislators with seeking bribes
is merely a Willie Hearst witticism.
"We lie about honest taen," says the
blacKmailer's organ, ''because that is our
humor."
The attempts of the Examiner to worry
Senator Perkins "into selling a ship" are
admittedly humorous.
"I do not pretend to have a sense of de
cency," says Long Green Lawrence, "out
please observe my sense of humor."
The Examiner gave notice yesterday that
it is supporting Mr. Perkins for the Senate
simply because he is a funny fellow with a
great sense of humor.
"When I took that $22,000 from the
Southern Pacific Company," says Willie
Hearst, "I was gently jocose, but when I
kicked because I did not get $8000 more I
became truly comic"
The Examiner shoald either label its
jokes or else print an announcement on
the title page that it is designed as a
comic daily and all its little fakes are in
tended to be humorous.
The mining interests before the Legisla
ture are great and deserve careful consid
eration. The State owes much to this
great industry and should do all in its"
power to repay the obligation.
In elevating Mr. Perkins as a candidate
for the Senate strictly on his sense of
humor the Examiner could hardly have
been aware that it was presenting the
public with a most pathetic picture.
The Democratic organ of Senator Per
kins again asserted yesterday that several
Democratic and Populist legislators
would vote for that gentleman, but it may
have been intended only as a witticism.
The assertion of the Examiner that it is
supporting Senator Perkins simply be
cause he has a better sense of humor than
any other candidate may have been in
tended after all as a joke on that gentle
man.
It seems we are to infer from the
Exavxwer of yesterday that "Long Green"
Lawrence put up his gun-figh:er as referee
in the late boxing match simply as a joke
on Fitzsimmons and to make game of the
town.
It will hardly be necessary to inform
Mr. Hearst that the speech of Grove L.
Johnson in the House of Representatives
on Friday is regarded by tne people of
California as a very good example of light
aud agreeable humor.
Honest Republicans in the Lesislature
wiil not be bulldozed by charges of brib
ery asserted by a Democratic organ which
la a seif-acknowledged boodier and black
mailer. They will vote for the candidate
of their choice and defy thÂ» slanderers.
The Sacramento correspondent of the
Examiner says that should any men enter
the Senatorial race "with enough money
to satisfy the wolves they might force an
interesting contest even at this late day,
the money feature predominating." That
is another joke.
The assertion of Mr. Perkins' Demo
cratic organ that the chief qualification of
aUnied Slates Senator is a sense o' humor
impiies an inability on the part of that
organ to distinguish the difference be
tween the Senate aud a circus. It doesn't
kuow a toga from a suit of motley.
Loyal RepuDlican-; should carefully con
sider the t: ctics of the opposing candi
dates for the senatorsnip. They should
tnke note of which side is upholding the
honor of the Republican party and which
side is resorting to charges of bribery, to
vilification, slander and the vulgarity of
the slums.
Samuel M. hihortridge has hired no
boodle newspaper to slander his oppo
nents in the Senatorial contest. He has
not maligned them nor even misrepre
sented them. He stands in this contest
upon his own merits and has not found it
necessary to decry those of other men in
order to exalt his own.
If the Examiner had any fact whatever
upon which to base its assertions that
money will win at Sacramerto, and that
lieoablican legislators are waiting to be
bribed, it would publish that fid and give
it a page, a picture, a caricature, ten !urid
headlines and forty fake attachments.
There would be a sensation in it.
It is conceded on all sides that the
Legislature has begun its work with a
degree of excellence which eives assur
ance of an economical and business-l.ke
session. The Senatorial contest has Dot
been allowed to interfere with other
matters and every duty of the first week
of the session has been accomplished with
coninieadabio lrornptness.
A STRANGE OVERSIGHT.
It is a most singular oversight on the part of the managers Of Mr. Perkins that
they have not produced b>fore the members of the Legislature tome evidence of his
superior fitness for the office of United States Senator. Surely there must
be an abundance of such material on hand and capable of immediate
production to satisfy the inquiring minds of legislators upon this important point.
The pages of the Congressional Record should fairly sparkle with gems of Mr. Per
kins' eloquence expended in advocating the claims of Calilornia to recognition
among her sister State 3 and which his managers at Sacramento might
proudly quote. Or they might point with equal priac to the San Francisco Postoffice
or the Alviso harbor improvement, or the other large and important benefits which
Mr. Perkins' efforts at Washington have conferred upon the State
of California. Or they might show that his influence with
the incoming administration was so potential that he could secure from it all of the
advantages for California which during his past official career he has notably failed to
obtain or even to promote to a perceptible degree. Or they might demonstrate with
what unselfish and whole-souled devotion he has labored to procure for his StatÂ«
ihe signal honor of a representation in the Cabinet of President McKiniey. Or
they might call attention to otlier striking and exceptional talents of Mr. Perkins,
by the aid of which, even without eloquence or a large degree of effort to fur
ther the interests of California, he had been or would be able to impress
the Nation with an admiration of his greatness, and thereby reflect honor upon
and awaken pride in the State which is being asked to honor him with election to the
high office of United States Senator.
The managers of Mr. Perkins have not done any of these things, and for reasons
which although best known to themselves are not entirely unknown to the
people of California or to the members of its present Legislature.
Instead of putting forward Mr. Perkins as v candidate for Senator
upon his merits they have preferred in making his fight for the place
to use all the cunninc devices and cheap tactics which small men in an unworthy
cause are minded to employ. By ex parte instructions; by an ineffectual and ridicu"
lous attempt to hold a caucus; by artful misrepresentations of
their own strength and less artful efforts at concealment of the
growing strength of his opponent; by enlisting ihs services of a notoriously
disreputable Democratic newspaper; by putting Mr. Perkins up
close to every aspiring patriot as '"a promising man"; by in
sinuating that any legislator who honestly ventured to vote for a
most worthy candidate for Senator would be smutted with the suggestion
of bribery, and by ridicaling the idea that genuine merit and the
possession of superior learning, eloquence and ability were to be con
sidered in the choice of a Senator, the managers of Mr. Perkins have
thus far conducted his campaign. Is it surprising that the Republican members of
the Legislature are becoming extremely restive under this sort of inducement to the
election of Mr. Perkins, and that every indication of the week points towaraan official
expression of their disapproval of such methods when the time for the election of a
Senator arrives ?
A REPRESENTATIVE SENATOR.
The whole people of California have the right to be represented in the choice of
the United States Senator who is to succeed Senator Perkins. In this larger sense
it is not a partisan matter, though Republican votes will undoubtedly elect him.
Two essential elements of character are plainly paramount in guiding legislators
to a wise decision. First in importance is the choice of a man who is a representa
tive of the whole people and not alone of the more favored and prosperous portion.
Is Mr. Samuei M. Sbortridge lacking or deficient in this essential qualification?
Who would think of Mr. George C. Perkins in looking over the State for a man pos
sessing this special qualification?
Tbe second essential consideration is that tne man chosen shall possess unim
peachable integrity and known ability of a high order for the position. It has
never been intimated in any quarter that Mr. Shortriitge is not fully qualified to
meet this requirement. Thk Call has no occasion to doubt the integrity of Senator
Perkins; but it is not a trespass upon propriety to raise the question whether any
supporter of Mr. Perkins believes he is a man of a high order of ability save only in
accumulating a fortune. Reward for that order of ability is found in the fortune,
not in a seat in the United States Senate; and yet we have seen Mr. Perkins hon
ored with such a seat for a time, short indeed, but quite long enough to satisfy
California.
It is a matter of common knowledge and a serious cause of public disquietude that
the corporations have altogether too many wealthy representatives of their
interests in the United States Senate. California should not heedlessly provoke
public resentment by returning Mr. Perkins to the Senate as the head of a power
ful and wealthy corporation to continue there for six years to represent the cor
porations of the State and not the great majority of the population. On the con
trary, the industrial and producing interests of the State, as well as the great busi
ness enterprises, would have in Mr. Samuel M. Shortridge an equal and fair champion
and protector, who would at once be accorded consideration and respect, and
whose commanding abilities and force of character would win success for the cause
he espoused. California is a great State with a National fame for measureless
resources and vast enterprises. Common sense would dictate the election of a Sena
tor of masterful resources and abounding energy, somewhat commensurate with
the State he is sent to represent.
Little sagacity is needed to see the desperate straits into which men are driven
who resort as their chief reliance to the use of personal ridicule and coarse cari
cature and intimations of bribery in order to defeat an opponent. It is a sneaking
confession of the weakness of their cause and of their underbred instincts. And
no one will be surprised that a charge of bribery or boodle should emanata from the
Examiner. Boodle is a potent argument with which it is unduly familiar if public no
toriety is any guide to its record. With no subtlety and with little skill it raises
the cry of boodle to intimidate the nominal supporters oj Mr. Perkins and frighten
them from changing their vote to Mr. Shortridge. But a charge of venality
made by the Examiner will hardly doter men of true worth from dafying the in
famous charge and voting in harmony with their convictions in order to serve
the State to their best ability by eleoting Mr. Samuel M. Shortridgo to a seat in tbe
Senate.
WHY did not the Examiner,
which so obtrusively boasts
that it gives all the news all
the time, publish the. speech
which CJrove L. - Johnson de
livered in Congress on last
Friday, grilling: Mr. Hearst?
From the Examiner's descrip
tion of its vileness, unclean
ness and obscenity it was just
the sort of stuir which that
newspaper searches every slum
for as its favorite kind of news.
Possibly, among; other sala
cious: matter of extra flavor,
the speech has been held over
for its Sunday issue, where it
will appear in full with appro
priate '" pictures , of -Mr. Hearst
in his variety as described by
Grove I-. : ,; Johnson upon the
floor of the House.
ANOTHER TBIOX
We were indebted Friday to the Sacra
mento correspondent of the San Fran
cisco Post for a revelation of the tactics of
the Perkins managers to bring about his
election to the Senate by inducing certain
Democratic and Populist legislators to re
main away from the Capitol when the vote
was taken. A furtner alleged revelation
of their schemes was made yesterday by
the correspondent of the Examiner in the
statement that pressure would be brought
to bear upon one of the Populist Assem
blymen to compel him to vote for Per
kins.
The scheme asserted by the Examiner
correspondent can be best stated in his
own words. He says:
It is definitely understood, however, that
should the Republicans in the Assembly fail
to make a nomination by the third ballot on
Tuesday, the Democrats will end the matter
then and there. Assemblyman Landsborough,
the Sacramento Populist who is under arrest
on a flock of felony indictments, has been the
target of some endeavor. Ex-Seuator Frank
Sprague is his attorney and is entirely willing
to help the unfortunate Assemblyman in any
way he cau by a little political manipulation.
So if any point in Landsborough's favor can
be worked by having him desert Cator and
vote for a Republican, the point will undoubt
edly be Bcored.
For a rieht comprehension of these
revelations it must be borne in mind that
the Post is for Perkins by insinuation ac
cording to its character, and the Examiner
according to its character is for him im
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
pudently with all its thousand fakes. The
I publication of the schemes was clearly
i intended to help Perkins by forcing Re
| publicans to vote for him under the threat
that if they do not the Democrats will
elect him. It will be seen therefore that
these statements ol tne tricks contem
plated by the Perkins managers came
from their friends aud are designed to aid
them. Tney are entitled therefore to as
much credence as can be given to any
thing which emanates from such sources.
It will bo noted that the Examiner cor
respondent does not say that Lands
borough is to be forced to vote for Per
k ns, but only that lie is to have the law
"worked" in his favor if he will desert
Cator and "vote for a Republican." The
correspondent evidently has not the same
sense of humor possessed by others in the
Examiner office, and suspects something
of dishonor in this scheme to take ad
vantage of a man's liability to the law. to
force him to vote against his party. Had
any of the friends of Mr. Shortridge de
vised this scheme the Examiner man
would have named at onca the Republican
for whom Landsboroujih's vote was to be
secured and would have played it up as
the big sensation of the first week of the
legislative session.
It is against tricks and schemes of the
nature of those described by the Examiner
and Post that Mr. Shortridge has to make
his contest. It seems incredible thai a
candidate for the United States Senate
would resort to such efforts to defeat the
will of his own party and procure an elec
tion by aid of certain weak men of other
parties The Call would never have as
serted such things of Senator Perkins. It
does not believe now that he connives at
these tactics of his managers, and it is to
be trusted that as soon as he becomes
aware of them he will repudiate
them â if indeed his managers themselves
do not succeed in proving both stories to
be false, and showing that they are the
mere emanations of fakers who have no
more sense of honor in politics than in
journalism.
THE ANGRY BOY.
The orator who first presented the ex
prize fighter John Morrissey for Congress
addressed the convention in words of frank
enthusiasm: "Gentlemen," he declared,
"I do not urge Mr. Morrissey for Congress
because he is mo^t fit, but 1 <1o assert that
he has- fit most." The convention ap
plauded, the people approved ana Mr.
Morrissey was duly elected.
That declaration of the quality required
in a candidate for Congress occupied a
nnique place in the annals of American
politics until yesterday, when the Exam
iner pronounced in favor of Senator Per
kins and urged his election to the Senate,
not because he is most fit, but because he
has the best sense of humor. The point in
this is not so apparent as in the case cf the
orator who nominated Morrissey, but let
that pass. The Examiner may not have
meant it to be pointed.
"It is undeniably true," said the Exam
iner with a sudden burst of veracity into
which it was betrayed by its eaeer pursuit
of an unexpected bubble of wit, "it is un
deniably true that Mr. Bhortridge is
equipped with a character superior to self
ish and sordid interests, with learning in
the broad sense of the term and with elo
quence which attracts the mind; be is also
a fearless friend of justice, a gentleman of
independent character and of broad cul
ture; but he has one defect â he has no
sense of humor. Now, there is Senator
Perkins"â but nere the Examiner paused
ana ceased to pursue the theme.
It is feared the Examiner has itself no
sense of humor, for otherwise it woold not
have ventured gravely and seriously to
disturb the decent decorum and dignity
of a legislative body deliberating with
earnestness as befits statesmen the selec
tion of a representative of California in
the United Btates Senate by intruding the
argument that he must have a sense of
humor. Neither Is it likely that the Ex
aminer, had it possessed a true apprecia
tion of the ludicrous, would have raised
before public imagination a picture of its
candidate, Mr. Perkins, perked upon a
pinnacle of a keen sense of humor and
claiming a seat in the Senate on that merit
alone.
In Ben Jonson's drama, "Every Man
to His Humor," a large place and full
play is given to the "Angry Boy." The re
membrance that "Rare Old B^n" allowed
the ebullience of that chaD to count in his
tolerant use of the word as "humor" gives
ground for conceding as much to the Ex
aminer even when it urges the nomina
tion of so mild-mannered and placid an
old gentleman as Mr. Perkins to the
United States Senate on the ground that
he is frisk}', frolicsome and agreeably
humorous. It is certain, however, that
Mr. Perkins is not so keenly devoted to
fooling that he would like to be addressed
in (he Senate as "Perfcy." It is clear,
therefore, the Examiner's sense of humor
is peculiar. Mr. Willie Hearst is evidently
playing the part of the '-Angry Boy."
THE opinions of* Attorney.
General Fitzgerald and. Hon.
J. â¬. Daly put a quietus upon
the ridiculous effort of Mr.
Perkins' managers to make
the public i as ..well" a* the Leg.
islature believe that they held
a caucus which, according: to
any accepted rule of political
usage, had either validity or
binding effect. Every effort to
hold a caucus of the dominant
party in the Legislature is ab
solutely ineffectual unless it re
sults in the attendance thereat
of a sufficient number of the
persons representing that par
ty to constitute a majority of
the entire Legislature. The
pretended Perkins caucus did
not consist . of that number
and hence it was not a caucus

ACCESSORIES TO DISHONOR.
San Francisco Bulletin.
It has become apparent the hopes of the managers of the campaign of George C. Perkins for
re-election to the United States Senate lie largely in the direction of securing the votes of
Democrats in the Legislature for their candidate on Tuesday next. They hope, in return for the
partisan advantage it will give the Democracy to have California and the Republican party
misrepresented by a weak man, to persuade the Democratic leaders to become accessories to
the most nefarious bargain ever made in the history of California politics. It Is at least an
open question whether any Democrat can afford to identify himself with this band of recklets
conspirators against the good name of the commonwealth. The vengeance of the people is
not partisan. Democrat or Republican, it strikes all alike who betray the interests of the
masses. It Is a wholesome fear of this avenging hand which holds many men of dishonest
instincts to the courses of honor. But, aside from the fear of popular wrath, the Bulletin does
not believe there is a Democrat in the Legislature so lost to all that makes men respectable
and self-respecting as to yield himself to the blandishments of this little coterie of schemers
who have undertaken to achieve a temporary success at any price of future punishment.
There are limits even to political malevolence, and no political party was ever built np by the
degradation of an opposing party which involved also the degradation of the State. The Per
kins managers have mistaken the. temper of the Democratic minority, as they have mistaken
the temper of the people of California.
By their hopes and their fears they have been led astray. Mr. Perkins hnd and holds the
advantage of a caucus nomination for the Senate, though it is the nomination ci a caucus
short of a sufficient number of votes on joint' ballot to secure his election. The open counting
upon enough Democratic votes to win in lieu of the defection of Republicans is proof at once
of their hopes nnd their fears. Republicans of California, what do you think of the fruits of
the glorious victory achieved in November ? The spectacle of the choice of ;a Senator depend
ing for his election upon tne votes of Democratic members of the Legislature is assuredly an
inspiration to renewed achievements in the line of party success.
The Bulletin does not believe the Democrats will lend themselves to the success of this plot
against the interest of the State to wiiich all citizens are loyal. In the lijrht of the appalling
exposure of the political perfidy of Senator Perkins, they cannot afford to do it. Even in the
lowest view, men who would so betray the State would be foredoomed to political death. All
men, regardless of party, know that in no other way could California's interests be more cer
tainly advanced than by the selection from the State of a member of McKin
ley's Cabinet All men, regardless of politics, know now that if Senator Per
kins has not spoiled the State's chance of Cabinet representation he has
contributed as powerfully to that end as he couldâ and from the most selfish motive. Senator
Perkins went to Washington pledged to the support of Waymlre for the Cabinet. Whatever
he may say now, whatever the adroit gentlemen who are managing his fight may say now,
that Is the fact. He went to Washington, also, with his election assured, but with a coward's
tear that the power of the Southern Pacific would be used against him. He was assured that
this opposition was rather an element of strength, put he had seen many men slaughtered
by that influence, and he was afraid. Ail the greater Southern Pacific guns were
at Washington, hostile to California representation in the Cabinet, and hostile, above all, to
Waymlre. He is an honest man, without even the taint of corporation influence. It is be
cause he is an honest man California Republicans to a man rallied to him when his name was
mentioned in connection with the Cabinet. Senator Perkins reached Washing
ton, where all of the Huntington force was gathered, and at once came
his indorsement of Horace Davis, the introduction of an element of dis
cord where only harmony could win, and the betrayal of California's interest, at
least as far as George C. Perkins could betray it. Also, there came a cessation ot whatever
railroad opposition there had been tojttae election of Perkins. The railroad organs and the rail
road men, big and little, are all for Perkins. They are hounding Republicans who dare oppose
him, and cracking the whip over the backs of Democratic 'egislators whom they hope to reach
through fear of railroad wrath. Whether the infamous bargain will be consummated rests
altogether with the Legislature of California. For the credit, for the material interest of the
Stete.it is to be hoped it is not yet too late to punish those who have dared to plot this
treason.

A TRUE REPUBLICAN.
Iteanona Hhy a Loyal â  Republican De
sires the auction of S. SI. Ahortridrre.
Etocktox, Cal., Jan. 8, 1897.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sin:
If I am not 100 late I would like to say to thÂ«
law-making power now in session at Sacra
mento to give us a â  Republican for our next
United States Senator. It is so long since out
State has had one that our party wouli hail
the glad tidings with untold joy. The present
incumbent is anything but a Republican, ai
evidenced by the rotten Democratic presa
now clamoring for his re-election.
.During the late campaign, and prior to the
nomination being made for Representative in
Congress from the fourth- District Senator
Perkins delivered & speech before the San
Francisco Chamber 01 Commerce eulogizing
Congressman Maguire and â¢ urging his return
to Congress.
Will THE CALL kindly supply it, as I have not
access to the file and lorget the date? 1 wrote
him a letter, however, at the time, upbraiding
him for his course and toid him the great In
justice he bad done to whoever would be the
Republican nominee, all of which turned out
to be trie truth. -I venture to say we have had
no genuine Republican Senator since the late
one-eyed hero Miller, If .there is any efficacy
in prayer, peace to his sacred ashes.
Had I a say in the councils of the Republi
can party I would urge the appointment of
Morris M. Esteo for a Cabinet position, al
though I frankly acknowledge 1 do not like
him personally; but right is right, and ii a
lifelong devotion to the Republican party and
Its attendant principles is a claim he certainly
has got it, and it is ingratitude to ignore him
at this time. â¢
But, Mr. Editor, tho position' of United
States Senator carries with it peculiar fitness,
all of which is embodied in the Hon. S. M.
Shortridge. His voice in the halls rof the Na
tional â â  Legislature would be of incalculable
benefit to our glorious State, would solidify
the Republican - party and redound to the
everlasting credit of those. who would be in
strumental in electing him. If we cannot
have Mr. Shortridge, why give us George A.
Knight or some gentleman of like qualifica
tions, but by all means let -him be a Republi
can in every sense that the word implies.
Yours very sincerely and respectfully, . ,
M. J. Sullivan.

jlj^ young City, the general literary taste
here is equal to that of any of the
older cities of equal size. There is a large de
mand for first-class books, and history and
biography, the most scholarly works on
science and the useful arts, as well as the
masterpieces of fiction, are bought from our
bookstores and borrowed from the big
libraries in large numbers. The favorite
writers in fiction are about the same as in the
great cities of the East. The amount of fiction
read in proportion to other works is lees here
than in an average amount of reading done in
bier cities generally. The big Public Library,
with its record of 440,000 volumes read per
annum, gives a pretty fair test of the ratio of
fiction read to the demand for books of more
serious study. Judged by that test, about 50
cent of the books read here are fiction,
and the usual average is 70 per cent. There
are many people here with both find literary
taste and abundant means to gratify it by the
ownership of fine private libraries, and this
creates a large demand for all the handsomely
bound books of real merit . that are issued.
There is sale here, too, for those treasures of
literature which Dring very high prices be
cause of their rarity from, having been long
out of print.
Think of a bookseller pulling down from his
shelves a single volume for which you would
have to part with $75 to become the owner.
That rare old books will bring rich prices is well
known, but it will surprise some that there is
a demand for them that justifies their being
carried in stock in the home market Some of
our booksellers estimate that there are more
books sold in California, in proportion to the
population, than in any other State, and say
that it is an undoubted fact that this is one of
the best of markets for the most choice and
high priced books.
It will be cf interest to know some of the
books which have stood at the top of the list
of favorites in this City. Recently "Senti
mental Tommy," by J. M. Barrie, seems to
have been the first choice here, as well as all
over the country, and "Kate Carnegie," by
lan McLaren, and "King Noanett," Dy Stim
son, are pretty evenly matched for second
choice. Outside of fiction Max Nordau's
"Degeneration" was most read during the
past year. Among the more serious books
White's "Warfare of Science and Theology in
Christendom" received the greatest attention.
In the realm of history and science Johu Fiske
has Deen king of popular favor, and for juve
nile books "Tommy Toddles," by Albert Lee,
entertained a multitude of young folks, and
Heniy's many books for boys and the bound
volumes of Harper's "Round Table" were in
great demand.
At William Doxey's recently the largest sales
were made of "Tales of Languedoc," by Bran;
"King Noanett," by Stimson, was second and
"Checkers," by Blossom, was third. Large
sales of "Sentimental Tommy" and "Kate
Carnegie" were made. The class of readers
who get their books at Doxey's prefer Thack
eray among the old standard authors, and
Walter Scott leads Dickens by a long way. For
young people he finds Henry's historical boots
are much appreciated, and Captain Marryat
and Maria Jidgeworih, maintain their oid es
tablished popularity.
At A. M. Robertson's the biggest sales re
cently were of "Quo Vadis," by Sienkiewicz ;
'â¢Seats of the Mighty," by Gilbert ParKer;
"Kate Carnegie" and "King Noanett." In
juvenile books the leaders were "Tommy Tod
dles," iby Albert Lee; "Rick Dale," by Keith
Monroe, and "Seraph," by Mrs. Jamieson. Mr.
Robertson finds the favorites among the older
authors are Dickens, Thackeray-and Balzac,
with honors pretty evenly divided. He had a
very large demand for the political novel,
"The Honourable Peter Stirling." by Ford,
and, surprising to relate, It outsold "Trilby
even during the height of the Trilby fever.
The works of the American writers of history-
John Fiske ana Captain Mab&nâ are much
read, and in poetry there has been a good sale
recently of the "Seven Seas," by Kipling.
In the big and busy Emporium the sales of
fiction are a hundredfold greater than those
of any other class of literature, and here "Sen
timental Tommy" stands first on the list; then
follow in order -'Kate Carnegie," "Taquisara,"
by Crawford, and ''Sir George Tressady," by
Mrs. Humphry Ward. Among juvenile books
the principal oues have been "The Book of
Famous Americans," got uo by the Cen
tury Company, and George Henty's works. In
calls for the older authors Dumas is the prime
favorite, with Dickens second, and Thackeray
far down on the list, which is a noticeable dif
ference from the demand at Doxey's, where
Tnackeray was the first choice. Although fic
tion is the main thing nt the Emporium, they
sell a large number of scientific works, and the
favorite has been the "Scientific Series" pf the
Appleton Company. John Fiske's "History of
the American Revolution" has been a good
seller.
At the San Francisco News Company, where
the trade is principally in books of cheap pa
per binding, the leaders in fiction have been
Marie Corelli's and Anthony Hope's works, but
here during the last year the sales of fiction
were largely exceeded by those of the popular
books on the all-absorbing financial question,
ifnd the sale of noveis became a very second
ary interest at that store. In holiday books
the first place was taken by Palmer Cox's
"Brownies' Year Book," second by "Twixt
Cupid and Croesus," and third by Gibson's
books of drawings.
From tho Public Library the works of fiction
that were drawn out in largest numbers were:
"By the Bonny Brier Bush," "The Honourable
Peter Stirling," "Sir George Tressady," "Sen
timental Tommy" and "KingNoanett." "Ben
Hur" keeps up In popularity without the pas
sage of time showing any effect In tiring the
publicâ they have to keep sixteen copies to
Bupj.lv the demand for this "tale of the
Christ." "Kate Carnegie" is very popular.
The most largely read book during the past
year was ''Degeneration," by Max Nordau,
but the interest in it has died out to a large
extent, and just now "Sentimental Tommy"
is in perhaps the first or second greatest de
mand. Ot the old standard authors here
tcott stands first, Dickens second and Thack
eray third. There are a very large number of
books used from this library on scientific sub
jecis and useful arts; the fiction is only 50 per
cent of the whole number of volumes drawn
out during the year. History and biography
cover About 13 per cent, philosophy and re
ligion 4 per cent, sociology about 3 per cent,
and poetry and the drama something over 4
cent. Most prominent in popularity among
the books for people studiously inclined was
White's "Warfare of Science and Theology in
Christendom." The numbers of volumes
made use of from this big library are increas
ing at the rate of about 18,000 per annum.
Members of the Mechanics' Library have
shown a decided preference for 'The Honour
able Peter Stirling," "The Prisoner of Zenda"
by Anthony Hope and "The Sowers" by Merrl
man. "Sentimental Tommy," "Taquisara,"
â¢'Seats of the Mighty," "King Noatiett" and
"Sir George Tressady" are books much read
from there and in which the members show a
similar tcste to all the rest of the world, but
they have displayed a specialty in the way of
an absorbing interest in the study of palmistry
and genealogy. No explanation is given of
why the fad has grown to such great propor
tions, but it taxes the capacity of the big
library to supply the information desired on
tho art of reading the lines that have been
traced by nature on the inside of the hand.
Outside of fiction the book most used irom the
Mechanics' has been "Degeneration" by Nor
dau, and next to that White's "Warfare of
bcieuce and Theology in Christendom." The
works of the Polish writer, Heinrik Sienkle
wicz, are in great favor. "A Summer in
Arcady'' is often called for. and "The Damna
tion of Theron Ware" has had a good many
readers. Mrs. Matthews and Mrs. Burnett and
G. A. Henty are the writers of juvenile fiction
j most liked by the young people. No decided
preference is here shown among the authors
Bulwer, Dickens, Scott and Thackeray. This
library is very largely used for works on the
applied arts.
William Doxey, who is a man thoroughly in
formed on the subject of books, both old and
new, and who is In as close touch with the lit
erary taste of the City as exhibited in its de-
I mand for es^hetically bound volumes of "the
I best that has been thought and said in the
world" as any one could well get 1o be, says
that San Francisco, both in its discrimination
of what is roost excellent in fiction and its de
sire for accurate, thorough and up-to-date in
formation in science, history, philosophy and
all the principal branches of human knowl
edge, is the peer of any city of equal size. It
equals many of the big centers of civilization
which have bad a great deal longer time
in which to develop culture and scholarship.
There is a good deal of original research going
on here, and the investigators are keen
to possess every publication, new and
old, which will throw any additional
light upon the subject of their studious
inquiry. It is surprising to learn that Mr.
Doxey ships books as far east as New York,
and occasionally to London, England. Speak
ing of the demand for books he says that there
is considerable call now for reprints of the old
favorite authors. These books ere now gotten
up with so much more artistic print and bind
ing than the old that their attractiveness is so
much enhanced they find new readers as weil
as reresders among those who had enjoyed
them long ago. He also finds quite a demand
for old, rare and costly books. Among these
he has a reprint of the "Golden Legend," just
as William Caxton got it up, "The Boccaccio"
in the origiral, the quaint worK of Junipero
Serra, and some rare and beautiful editions of
Shakespeare.
A". M. Robertson, the extensive book-dealer,
who also is in a good position to judge of tne
literery demands of the State and City, says
the sale of good books here exceeds that of any
other State in the Union in proportion to the
population, and this, too, notwithstanding the
fact that so large a part of the community is
made up of Chinese and Japanese, who do not
use our literature. Speaking of the propor
tion of fiction sold, he says that light litera
ture, as usually estimated, is 70 per cent of
the whole. But such estimates never take
into account the vast sale of Bibles. The Scrip,
tures outsell all other books, and next to that,
as might be expected, is William Shakespeare.
In this connection a brief report ot what
books head the list in popularity in some of
the other large cities may be interesting for
comparison. In New York they are reading
first, "King Noaneti"; second, "Kate Carne
gie"; third, "Sentimental Tommy," and "Ta
quisara" and '-Quo Vadis" take a high place
in the estimation of the metropolis. Among
the favorite authors of books for youthful
readers Miss Alcott is so far in the lead she
might be said to distance her competitors. At
! a recent meeting of a ladies' literary society
there, the question was discussed as to wnich
was the best of the three writers, Barrie, Mc-
Laren or Crockett; the palm was awarded to i
Barrie.
Literary Boston is reading most of all "King
Noanett" and "The Country of Pointed Firs,"
with an apparent tie for first honors. Second
place goes to Mrs. Humphry Ward's "Sir
George Tressady," and another tie for third
place between "beniimental Tommy" and
"Taquisara" is shown by the record. Taking
this report from the very nub of culture as a
standard we can see that in mnny points the
literary taste of San Francisco is quite up to
perfection, but inasmuch as no very promi
nent attention has been given here to "The
Country of Pointed Firs," we will perhaps be
compelled to confess to a wild and woolly
Western deficiency in some points which pre
vented the discovery of the merits of this
took. Boston's preference for "King Noanett"
is to some extent explained when we consider
that the author, Frederick J. Stimson, it a
Boston lawyer, and every city is proud of and
interested in its own productions.
In Chicago they are reading in the order
named, "Kate Carnegie," "A Child World,"
by J. W. Kiley, and "King Noanett," with
"Sentimental Tommy" among those much
read.
In London, England, they are reading first,
"Rodney Stone," by Conan Doyle; second,
"Sir George Tressady," and third, Rudyard
Kipling's poems, "The Seven Seas," which have
been so widely advertised by the high praises
and sweeping condemnations from various
critics. The success of "Rodney Stone" is
somewhat surprising in that it is a story with
out a heroine.
STORY OF SIN.
WHITE BAKD- By K. C. Balfour. The Merriam
Company, New York.
Of the making of seventh commandment
stories there seems to be no end, and this is
another one of the multitude founded en the
breaking of it. The pertinence of the title to
the matter of the book may be perceived by
the reader, good at guessing, early in the nar
rative, but it is not explained to the less clever
until the end of the tale. Adam, the wronged
husband, after his trouble has become
merely a thing of memory, is walking
through the white sand of an Arab
town. The sight of the sand brings
memories and Adam thinks of the
soft escaping iinperiousness of It in his fingers.
"Stone may be carved and clay molded, but
sand is neither to hold nor to bind. If such a
thing is sin, who but He shall judge it?" But
to many readers, this woman, whose frailty is
by the title of the book likened unto the
dazzling and shifting white sand, will seem
much more comparable to black 'sand. When
her husband comes to make a magnanimous
effort to call her back from sin and she
instantly decides to desert her paramour as
lightly as she had done her husband, she says
to Adam, "I dare say I am a little beast," and
t was one of the times when the fair little liar
spoke the truth.

climax. The author is a Fellow ol the Ameri

Illustrations, showing the various styles and
presenting some of the finest buildings from
the most picturesque point of view. There are
458 pages, and everywhere the endeavor to be
concise is evident. Those who wish to ac

in this brief and gracefully written work some
thing that .vill gratify their desire for knowl
edge and make a handsome addition to their

siastic over the "truth of Greek art." Defining
the word "Renaissance" as applied to archi
tecture he says: "The term renaissance means
more to the architect than a rebirth of the
classics. It denotes the gradual aoandonment
of picuresque irregularity for symmetrical
elegance; the subordination ol Gothic prece

Little love Lou, how your lashes glisten,
Your soft cheek flushes, your soft eyes fill
With dancing drops, while the people listen
To hear your tenderly-voiced, ''I will!"
And how you glow when the golden fetter
Encircles your linger and makes us two
One for the worse, and one for the better,
And one till death parts us, my little love

HE SPEAKS OF HIS FATHER.
George dv Maurier's son Gerald is a member
of Beerbohm Tree's company, which is now in
New York. To a Tribune reporter he recently
granted an interview, in which he talked at
considerable length in regard to his father and
his work in the realms of illustration and
fiction. Speaking of his father's booki, he
said:
"Personally I like 'Peter Ibbetfon' much
better then 'Trilby,' and I think father also
thought It was the better book of the two. He
was very much interested in the new book,
â¢The Martian,' and preferred it to either of the
others. * * * After his books became so
popular he was quite overwhelmed with let
ters from all parts of the world. A good many
came from admiring women, especially Ameri
can women, and some of them were vastly
amusing. I have no doubt many of them
thought he was a young man."
Anybody who examines "English Society as
Sketched by Dv Maurier" cannot fail to notice
the unattractive dresses in which most of the
women are clothed. Some of them are posi
tively slovenly in appearance, even when al
lowance is made for the rapid changes of fash
ion. Some light is thrown upon this feature
of Dv Maurier's work in the remarks of nis
Bon:
"He had not the slightest idea of fashion
nor what was the correct thing in dress.
OTTO D'ATJBERTIN has just pnt the finishing touches on another of his gro
tesque conceptions Urn is in line with his other wont that has attracted so
much attention within the last six months. This he entitles "Life and Great
ness," and it is intended to be a slap at tne degenerate in art and literature that of
late has made so many men famous.
While the work at present is only a sketch in clay it, of course, has all the points
of the subject brought out. Seated in a natural attitude is a monkey that has con
siderable of the anatomy of a man, so that it might really be called tne missing link.
The monkey is in the act of removing a lion's mask from his face and holding it in
front of him, so that he can look around one edge of it.
The idea to be portrayed Is that if you take the mask from many great men you
will find only a monkey. This is a trifle severe, to be sure, but all the world knows
how true it is. The great number of freak writers, artists, musicians and soldiers bear
ample testimony to the fact Wben the mask is torn off and the world sees the
monkey all homage to the imposition naturally ceases; but how many great men are
there wearine the mask of the lion to-day that are in really only monkeys in mas
queradef D'Aubertin's conception has a world of truth in it even though there be
also a bit of cutting sarcasm.
Little is to be said of tbe technique of thi* piece of sculpture, as itia hardly in a
condition to be considered that way. Of course, the pose and action are good and
also the expression of the monkey's face. There is some good work in combining the
figures of the man and monkey so as to make the result look a little like both. This
shown a great knowledge of anatomy and creative power of a high order. On the
whole, this little piece of work is of a high order of merit.
Mr. D'Aubertin will aoon begin the work of modeling "Life and Greatness" on a
large scale, after which it will be exhibited to tbe public

A NEW MONTHLY REVIEW.
We have received from the publishers, the
Critic Company, 287 Fourth avenue, New
York, a copy of The Month, in Literature,
ArtandLileâ A Journal of Cultivation. This
new candidate for public favor is edited by
Miss Jeannette L. Gilder and Joseph B. Gilder,
who are joint editors of the New York
Critic. It is a really wonderful 10 cents'
worth of literature, the first number contain
ing signed contributions by Thomas Bailey
Aldrich, Frank R. Stockton, Gerald Stanley
Lee, Locke Richardson, Dr. VV. J. Rolfe, James
Herbert Morse, Bliss Carman, Howard Crosby
Butler and A. I. dv Pont Coleman.
In their introductory the editors say:
"There is always room for a new ideaâ and
the Month is something new. There is
room for it because it breaks new ground and
makes a place for itself."
Most of the articles contained in its 100
pages are, of course, reprints from the Critic,
which fact enables the Month to be sold at
such a low figure, but by no means detracts
from its merits. The Critic we believe to be
the finest literary journal published in the
United States, and with the cream of its arti
cles reprinted in a convenient form even the
least wealthy have no excuse for not keeping
thoroughly posted in matters relating to
literature, art, music and the drama. We be

THE MIKADO'S FAIRYLAND
'IN BAMBOO LANDS"- By Katherfne schuyler
Baxter. The Merriam Company, New York.
Japan's rapid progress in civilization and
military and naval power, which was forced
upon the attention of the world by her recent
signal victory over the Chinese, makes a good
work describing that country and its people
of timely interest. This one is handsomely
gotten up and has 370 large pages and 116
illustrations, many of which are full page,
and the paper is of extra fine quality. The
picturesque features of Japan are displayed
by a choica selection of scenes, showing how
both nature and art have beuutifled the coun
try. The author has traveled extensively in
those quaint islands and had ample opportu
nities to study the customs, arts, industries
and ancestry worship of the inhabitants. She
calls Japan "that land of many charms, fairy
world of inexhaustible interest, Eden of the
nineteenth century."
A SHORT NOVEL.
A GAME OF CONSEQUENCES- By Albert Kin
ross. The Merriam Company, Nev York.
This little book, almost brief enough to be
called a novelette, is called by the author a
comedy-novel, and tells the story of an army
officer's admiration for a talented and ambi
tious young governess, who chafes at the sub
ordinate position fate has placed her in. Both
the chief characters are worldly and their
consciences are dormant. First comes a clever
flirtation between this army man and the
governess, Jessica, who was instinctively a
tine performer on the human heart. The flir
tation ends in a declaration of love, and at her
own suggestion Jessica becomes the officer's
mistress. They live a happy life together and
Jessica becomes less worldly and more wo
manly. The captain begins to develop aeon
science, "but then he was blissfully ignorant
of the fact." Finding themselves growing
more and more in love with each other they
marry. Whether the book is morally whole
some would be a very debatable question.

William Do*ey. Paiace iloiel, City.
The author gives as a reason for this little
book that while he was conducting the query
department in Vogue he received letters from
all parts of the United States asking for infor
mation on certain details of etiquette which
seem to have been overlooked by the writers
of etiquette manuals, and these correspond
ents wanted the questions answered from the
New York standpoint. Herein the bachelor is
warned against the faults which will make
him "impossible" in society. On the last page
we are told that one of the marks of a gentle
man is his complete mastery of himself under
the most trying and aggravating circum
stances, and lurthermore this: "Under great
provocation the expletive 'damn' is tolerated
in society, but it should be whispered and not
pronounced aloud."

send a sympathetic thrill through all who
read them with j the attention they merit.
They are all short and adapted for recitations.
All who have fine gifts of elocution will find
in the use of these verses and I sketches ample
scope for the exercise of all the resources of
their skill.
A new work of this kind is much needed, for
the old gems of our language adapted to
recitations have been repeated so often that
their exquisite beauty, however well rendered
by an adept in the art of elocution, is apt to
have its spell broken Dy the wearisome iter
ation. The poem; that gives its title to the
book, "The . Show Lion," is alive with the
strength and grace befitting the description of
the royal beast in his tragic fight for freedom.
The short sketch, "To a Picture of Sarah Bern
hardt Sleeping," commencing "A yellow
tigress stretched in slender strength," is a fine
piece of art in its picturing to the â  mind's eye
in a very few lines the subtle charms of - the
famous actress. "The Nun's Rose" makes us
understand how passionately/ a young and
loving woman's heart must beat against the
vows that are as prison bars. One of the best
Is ; "Courage," which with ! forceful -brevity
calls to mind the march of Napoleon's army
against Moscow, the burning iof -L the city by
the Russians, and using that as a moral, closes
with this condensed sermon: â 
Hast tbou that courage, canst thou look within
Ihe kingdom of thyself, search out the dear
desire. jfffiÃffiffiffifift^ffifflft^
And ere it take thy soul a captivj thing,
Slay/ burn, destroy, and purify with fire? '
Then thou art 'Alexander, Empeiorâ fling hard
' . the gauntlet in the face of Fate ', ,
: Fate cannot harm thee If thou darest so much-.
' To burn thy city ere (he foeman take."
Here is a fine sample of the author's work:
'â  "WHAT IHE BOSK TOLD.
Yes, Nature loves the truth,
She blazons forth the truth on every hand. ',.- ;j
The only oman 'neath the vaulted skies, .
Who has no secrets hid and tells no lie*â
Woman whose vows are "wr.t in sand,"
loves not the truth.
' I raved my hated lival near her home; 'â â¢
â â  Be smiied in passing, gay and debonair; _
.' Upon bis coat he wore a yellow rose. "â 
> Its silken petals crushedâ ':
" Who placed it hers. ". Who knows? '
Bui she sat lonely, waiting my return;
. Her eyes were fastened gravely on her book, ,
- Until I raised the pretty, dimpled chin.
And in the shy, soft eyes looked deep withinâ .
â¢ I sought tor guilty look, out found love in its

" Bast thou been all alone?" I murmured low, .'.
" No one to lighten time with chat or song?"
And s leaning so, caressed 'the pink-tipped ear;
She answered, "None; ' I waited for you, dear,
' And oh, the time with you away was long!
. Alone, time goes so slow." - â 
i â Tig only good Dame Nature loves the truth,
And even she may palter with the sunâ
' " I only know, nitain her hair that day,

â  There were just three more;

And yet, who knows? 1
Why, any man might wear a yellow rose!
A NEW POET IN THE WEST.
George J. Duraind, who has been Identified
with .-journalism in this City for the past fif
teen ' years, has just completed a poem, the
publication* of . which William Doxey is now
considering. It is a poem on the ideal in na
ture and art, and consists of between 4000 and
5000 words. / The author has planned to pub
lish it in eleven small books, each with an in
dividual title. Mr. Duraind has ! been greatly
encouraged to proceed with his work by Dr.
David Starr Jordan and Professor Hudson of
Stanford University, who several months ago
read what had been then written of the poem.
The work is ; written on j lofty lines. Mr.
Duraind says its tendency and aim is the same
with Christianity, ; that is, as Dr. Charming
said, to spiritualize our nature.
Mr. Duraind worked for several years on the
poem. '*. He, in fact, wrote four or five different
works ]; before his way became clear, to write
the j great poem, which be ; finally completed
last Saturday. Mr. Duraind here tells what
induced him Âto write the work, and â  gives to
tne reader glimpses of ' the - ; noble ; purposes
which animated him.
FIVE SHORT STORIES.
FELLOW TRAVELERSâ By Graham Travers.
' D." Appleton & Co., New York. Price 60 cents.
For sale by William Doxey, Palace Hotel, City,
Mr. Travers introduces us to tome interest
ing characters in these short stories. One of
the most pleasing of the five is "The Knight
and the Lady," in which the ; lady proposes to
the knight, but was amply justified as the
knight was dying and she promised to marry
him as * a reward ,â¢; for ; struggling to get well.
The knight was but 9 and the lady only 6, but
their romance was more interesting than that
of most grown people. ; i
; ' Another story Is a sort of a story in , agnos
ticism. Tbe two main characters are a beau
tiful, wealthy and frivolous â  girl and a very
plain i and very serious one, who looks upon
the gay butterfly with feelings far from envy.
One day the giddy girl questioned the serious
one as to what. she. believed. She could get no
answer but, ,'.'l believe it Is worth while trying
to be good." The end of the story leads us to
Infer that if the serious one had oelieved more
the giddy one would have seen it and would
have been saved from the sin into which she
drifted. ' __'â  ; ;'â :.'.â '.â¢':-.â .â¢

Alexandre Dumas and Mary, Queen of Scots,
are both names to conjure with, and ' when
they come in combination to us with Dumas
for author and the fair Queen with her ever
fascinating tragic history for subject, we must
needs surrender to their joint enchantments.
With all his wonderful powers of Imagination
the famous writer of romance could . not have
created \k\ heroine - r of ; fiction % who could Tso
charm us as does Mary Stuart of ' : actual
history. ' . : " :â *'.:: . ;â '. .".-'"X. " â --â¢ â ""â '.-.â ''â ''..â '
;,! This excellent ; translation . of . J. M. ; Howell
places before us . a vivid picture ] of . the turbu
lent times when this *j woman Vof \ strangely â¢
mingled strength and weakness ' strove to rule
the unruly Scots. ': These times were exciting
and picturesque, and . Dumas ; knew well , how
to make us feel the thrill of that excitement
and see tbe drama with fascinated r eyes. ~\ His
way of telling \of the murder of the Queen's
favorite, Rizzio, the ; avenging ot that deed by
the barrels of gunpowder when Darnley was
blown up in the Kirk of Fields, of Mary's im
prisonment In Lochlevin Castle with her
father's one-time mistress for jailer, and her'
daring escape thence by the aid of that Doug
lass who loved her so hopelessly and faith
fully, and of the last scene when the ax of
Elizabeth's jealousy struck the iinal blow to
her brave and beautiful rival, will make a
deeply grave impression upon the reader's
memory.
But with all its merit there is something dis
appointing about the book. Although the
author seems under careful restraint to show
no bias toward either the guilt or innocence
of the Queen, he yet puts into her mouth
words so coarsely satirical that they spoil that
ideal we love to cherish of her womanly sweet
ness and her queenly nobleness and majesty.
Even if we are compelled to admit that the
circumstantial evidence against ber Is too
overwhelming to be doubted, we will suspect
flaws in any portrayal which represents the
Scottish Queen as less than a noble spirit, how
ever siniul.

LITERARY NOTES.
A bust of Ernest Renan has been placed in
room 4 of the College de France, where the
great scholar used to teach his radical views
of Christianity.
The January Book Buyer will contain, be
sides a photogravure frontispiece, special illus
trated articles on William Morris, Arthur T.
Hadley and Charles Robinson, the illustrator.
The Messrs. Appleton have in press for early
publication "The True Life ol Captain Sir
Richard F. Burton," written with the au
thority and approval of the family by his
niece, Georgiana M. Stisted.
Mrs. Flora Steele's novel, "On the Face of
the Waters," will be published in January by
the Macmillan Company. Mr. Kipling is said
to have pronounced this the best story of the
Inaiaa mutiny that has yet been written.
The first editions of Florence Warden's new
novel, "Forge and Furnace," both in paper
and cloth, were sold in advance of their pub
lication. The second issue is almost exhausted,
and a third contemplated. The publishers are
the New Amsterdam Boot Company.
According to the St. James Gazette, Queen
Victoria will personally dictate and revise a
biography of herself, whicn will appear in
1897. Tne story of the longest reign in the
history of England from the Queen's own
standpoint cannot fail to be of great interest.
Charles Scribner's Sons announce the tirst
uniform edition of Rudyard Kipling's works,
to contain several stories not before collected,
in twelve volumes. For collectors there will
be a special American edition, consisting of
200 numbered copies, manufactured by the

The bound volume of Scribner's Magazine.,
for the past year has reached our review table.
This interesting publication keeps well to the
fore as one of America's leading monthlies.
The volume before us contains a large variety
of entertaining articles on literary, scientific
and historical subjects. Among the last Pro
fessor E. Benjamin Andrew's "History of the
Last Quarter Century in the United States" is
notable. Typographically and as a specimen
of the bookbinder's art Scribner's is all that
could be desired.
With the January number Romance begins
the eighth year of its life under new manage
ment in new and improved form, with a new
and striking cover, with new and original con
tents. It is now the property of Gilson Wil
lets, who is crowding into it the result of his
many years' experience as an editor and pub
lisher. The experimental stage in the career
of Romance terminated with the old manage
ment. All its fluctuations in price, its
changes in size, the uncertainty of purpose
which characterized it under old management,
are ended.
Dr. Fridtiof Nansen's account of his voyage
to the Arctic regions will be published in this
country by the Mes3rs. Harper in February,
simultaneously with its appearance in Eng
land, Germany, France, Sweden and other
European countries. The book was offered to
other New York houses, which refused it on
account of the enormous price askedâ sl2s,oooâ
more than half of the price paid by the Messrs.
Constable. It is not said that the Messrs.
Harper paid this price, but merely that it was
asked. The book will be published in two
volumes, and will be profusely illustrated.

.New York and Parisian
â¢Models.
As I have frequently stated, many
gcwns designed in New York are quite as
excellent in every detail as any Parisian
importations, and very foolish are many
who seek the great dressmakers in Paris,
for not unfrequently they pay high prices
for what are known to French women as
"nightingales." Indeed, unless one is
thoroughly posted in many little things,
nnd understands exactly what is most
suitable and becoming, the results of
shopping abroad are, to say the least, in
many cases disastrous. I should explain
that nightingales are garments lelt on
hand a season or so ago, and these are
frequently passed off triumphantly on un
suspecting foreigners. Sometimes a little
embroidery or trimming of a more recent
date is sewn on, and for such creations
from 1000 to 6000 francs are gladly paid by
visitors, who would exclaim in horror
were they asked half tbe sum at home, so
whenever I bear of a pretty toilette being
created by a New York dressmaker I like
to fully describe the poem in harmonious
colors, or in silk and Jace. Smith & Dillon
have lately designed pretty frocks, as well
as Martin, and this is what is said about
them:
Most exquisitely light and graceful in
effect are the newest fashions in ball
gowns. Smith & Dillon have two models
that are particularly noticeable; one tn
shrimp-pink satin is made with bodice
covered with pink chiffon embroidered in
pearls, with an empiecement of lace in
the back, and a broad draped belt of
the satin. The sJfeirt is en traine, the
sleeves of draped lace and pink-pleated
chiffon, ana the artificial flowers worn on
the gown are pink roses and yellow locust
blossoms.
The second gown is of soft Liberty silk,
very thin, made over stiff muslin and
trimmed in a most odd fashion with nar
row bias ruffles edged with black velvet.
A high girdle is Of two shades of creen
taffeta, while tbe large bow is also of
green trimmed with a narrow mffle.
White satin is used as much as ever, but
is, as a rule, covered with the sheerest of
nets and gauzes. Martin has a charming
gown for evening wear, the underskirt of
plisse satin, covered with gold spangles,
while on it is an overskirt of very sheer
net embroidered in green and gold
spangles; on the back of the skirt are
long sprays of scarlet poppies. The waist
is of white satin embroidered in green
and silver, and spangled with gold, and
softened by ruffles of tulle. The belt and
bow are of green velvet, and in sharp but
striking contrast are scarlet poppies which
extend over the sleeves.
Evening Gowns.
From other sources come descriptions of
evening costumes that cannot fail to be
interesting to those who entertain or go
out a great deal, as to fashion's votaries
every suggestion is valuable that conveys
the merest suggestion of novelty. To be
gin with, at a grand dinner party given
very recently at a delightful chateau not
far from Paris several of the toilettes worn
were so truly lovely that all Paris has been
discussing them. A handsome Countess
gowned in white satin, worked witb an
arraDesque pattern in silver spangles and
Beed pearls; the low bodice had a drapery
in front that matched. From the shoul
ders fell a mass ol gauze bouillonne. The
waist was slightly pointed, and at the
back of the skirt fell a large lace scarf.
The short sleeves were composed of a
bouillonne of lace and gauze. The long
kid gloves had a small monogram em
broidered at the top. This fashion will
meet with general favor, a crest being used
by many.
j Delightfully pretty was a dainty woman
who appeared in a cload of pink tulle,
caught up here and there with rosebuds
and knots of pearls over pink moire. The
low bodice had a wreath of roses buried
in pink tulle around the neck and shoul
ders. The waistband was of white satin,
and small and short were the sleeves.
A frock of white crepe lisse, accordion
plaited over white satin, was much ad
mired. The crepe lisse fell loosely over the
satin, not being fastened to it in any way.
Also plisse was the Jow bodice, round the
shoulders of which was an embroidery of
small white and gold beads, intermixed
with spangles. Quite novel in effect was
another toilette of crepe lisse. plisse, which
consisted of a black skirt over whicn was
a white one. The corsage matched per
fectly. Over it was worn a figaro of black
velvet, jet studded. This jacket was very
largeâ quite different from the short,
jaunty affairs so frequently seen. T.
Costumes at a Soipee.
A soiree given at another delightful coun
try house was the occasion for the discus
sion of more creations, but the three
specially worthy of remark consisted of,
first, a rich dress of flame-red and black
brocade, made with a long, plain skirt,
lined with flame - colored taffeta, and
a low bodice adorned with a row of
sable and a fall of point d'Alencon round
the neck. The elbow sleeves had flounces
cf Alencon.
Of feuille de rose lampas was the second,
which had a magnificent flounce, very
wide, of point d'Angleterre; it extended
half way up the skirt ana was apparently
held in place by several bows of pink
satin. Tbe bodice was low with a small
lace bolero that revealed a front en
riched with sparkling gems. The third
conception was worn by a youthful,
debutante and consisted of a maize-colored
crepe absolutely covered with an nil-over
embroidery of cream silk, the low square
cut bodice had a border of galon crepe,
embroidered with seed pearls and silk.
The sleeves were puffed, but of a very
modest size. The Frencby touch was
imparted by a bur.eh of roses pinned at
the left side of the corsage and a wide
corselet of pink faille, which was tied in
"Fashion's
Decrees"
the bacE, the long fringed ends reaching
the bottom of the skirt.
Blouses and Bodices.
Here some lovely blouses have of late
been noted. One in tucked turquoise
blue chiffon is made over blue taffeta
having a silvery sheen. The most
delicate insertions of creamy lace en
circle the wearer's slender figure. Round
the waist and throat are taffeta
ribbon, edged with quilling' lace. A
blouse, with a "botticelli" neck, has long
sleeves and is composed of serpentine ac
cordion â¢ pleated white chiffon, draped
longitudinally on a lining of white silk
aim uuuueu wilu uuuer-coioreu vaien
ciennes. .-..-.- "v
' Quite fetching is a low-necked bodice
with a fussy little basque' of frilled â¢ chif
fon. Baby ribbon is extensively used In
its construction, and the sleeves look like
puffy balls of chiffon. A charming ma
tron looks her ; prettiest, in a - bodice of
gray tulle finely accordion pleated,
trimmed with pink satin ribbon embroid
ered with silver and opal spangles. Pink
poppies with silver pistils are gracefully
trained over the left shoulder.
I also like a bodice with a vest and
collar of the palest pink chiffon bordered
with a frill of lace. Beneath the bust
scarfs or tbe chiffon cross to vanish in the
belt, edged with black velvet ribbon and
tied in the front. The sleeves of this and
tbe bodice are of a novelty silk of a rich,
beautiful texture, and the collar, which is
wired so as to stand up round tbe throat,
shows a double frill of the chiffon and
lace.
Indeed, nine out of every ten blouses and
bodices are mainly composed of Jace and
chiffon. A debutante's bodice which will
be much admired shortly is of a chiffon
covered with Marecbal Niel rosebuds
scattered over a green ground. It has an
overbodice of pale yellow lace, threaded at
intervals with green ribbons. Ie pouches
slightly in the front and displays a
vest of the chiffon, outlined with a double
frill of lace. Lace is also used to make long
sash ends at the back, frilled with the
chiffon, threaded with the ribbon.
Very Frenchy is an evening bodice of
white chiffon, with a short bolero of black
lisse, with an applique of cream lace all
over it The waist is trimmed with black
velvet ribbons.
A dinner bodice in white moire chine
Pompadour has loose fronts of green vel
vet of one of the beautiful new shades,
with tine applique guipure jabot and
riviere of ivory lace. Another is of a
fancy green and blue check velvet Zouave
with odd little capes edged with Valen
ciennes lace. The undervest is of blue ac
cordion-pleated chiffon, and the buttons
are of lapus lazuli. Tbe sleeves are of the
new puffed style and are of the velvet.
For morning wear a bodice of prune
colored cloth has lapels of moire antique.
The soft vest of surah has many rows of
shirring, which forms the yoke, from
which tbe vest falls softly. Ti.e belt is of
the moire. â 
Another model is made of a novel pink
silk, having a quaint design of a setting
Bun interspersed irregularly with fine
black lines. The belt and revers are
trimmed with narrow black velvet rib
bons, and a little friljing of chiffon bor
ders the bolero.
From Paris is a chic coat bodice, rather
Louis XVI in cut. It is of a new shade
of violet velvet, beautified with an
applique of black velvet irises, whica ap.

regular old-fashioned at coshape. At tbe
throat is a crush collar of the satin, and
down the front dead white lace is
jaboted over the satin, making an ex
quisite vest. Tbe bodice is lined with
the same. The skirt is of a beautiful
quality of satin cloth exactly matching
tbe satin corselet.
Concerning the cut of the bodice we are
again to count on round, seamless bodices,
draped on tbe straight edge of the ma
terial or on the bias, tbe fronts seldom
meeting, but tbe vest or plastron space
much less than it was last year. The
most popular addition of bodices
is the bolero or Eton-jacket form,
either separate or suggested by trim
ming, The lines of tbe figure are more
clearly defined than they were last year,
as the blouse fronts, old style, have en
tirely disappeared, and only a very slight
blouse vest is observable. High belts and
corselets are quite indispensable with
round bodices.
.Hats, Bonnets, Toques.
During the early autumn there was
quite a rage for shades of violet, but it
rapidly became so common that it was
banished from many a fashionable
woman's wardrobe, with, however, sincere
regret, as it was "sweetly becoming" to
not a few. As a result, "Eveque violet" is
now the color most affected In Paris, for all
stylish millinery, and veiy charming are
the creations evolved from judicious com
binations of velvet, tulle and flowers, in
this shade. The flowers most frequently
employed are irises, the pale mauve and
the rich violet making a harmonious
whole.
The flowers are grouped en masse be*
neath the brim in front of the hat This
season all the shapes are made so as to
allow the arrangement of flowers or rib
bon bows near the face and not as cache
pignes as they have been worn for so long
a time.
Black and Wftite Straw
Is a decided novelty, trimmed with a large
bow of scarlet velvet ribbon placed some
what to the lett side. The back of such a
hat must be well raised and finished off
with numerous loops of gauze ribbon.
Golden brown fluted straw will, I
hear, be very popular, trimmed with
gauze ribbon and bunches of scarlet hips
and haws. Positively, this is the first
time I have heard of hips and haws, but I
find that hips are the fruit of tbe dog rose
and haws are the berry and seed of the
hawthorn, so doubtless the result ob
tained by placing them toeether is artistic.
Mistletoe with its berries and leaves
trims many of the larger hats, but it is
worthy of note that the so-called large
hats are much diminished in size this
winter. The question frequently asked as
to what is the difference between the
"toquet" and the ''grand chapeau" may be
very briefly answered, as it lies but in the
existence of a narrow, flat brim. Numer
ous are the hats now bein<j made of col
ored velvet, adorned with a pair of feath
ers tbat exactly match the shade of the
velvet; they are arranged en aigrette;
Others are of black silk beaver with three
or four black silk feathers falling over
the side or at the back of the brim; these
are hideous affairs, I assure you, at least
they do not please me in the least, but
I are becoming doubtless to some faces.
' however, at times, I thoroughly appre
date how Lord Byron felt when
he declared that no woman with
a vestige of beauty should ever dis
figure herself by wearing either a hat
or a bonnet; instead he advocates
throwing over the hair gracefully a light
scarf of either white or black Jace. We
all admit the effectiveness of such scarfs,
nevertheless for the present hats or bon
nets we must wear, but they should
be chosen with real care and
much discretion, and I consider it a
waste of both time and money to try and
remodel or have remodeled either one or
the other, as nothing about a woman so
quickly announces the fact that it has
seen a previous season as her headgear,
which must be thoroughly correct in
every respect, and chic or dainty, as the
occasion demands.
Many Handsome hats of black velvet,
lately commented on in New York, are
beautified with large turquoise orna
ments that hold in place a feather aigrette.
These ornaments are frequently very
costly, consisting as they do of genuine
picked stones of fine quality mounted with
diamonds. Last year at a fashionable wed
ding the Princess of Wales wore a bonnet
which had the tiny brim studded with
diamond of rare beauty. As a result this
idea is now beine carried out for not only
several prominent personages but also for
many of fashion's leaders who have large
jewel caskets. Needless to remark this mode
will never become common, and I trust no
tawdry imitations will ever be attempted.
Jeweled bonnet-pins have been as fashion
able as ever for holiday remembrances.
Every one is commenting on the fact
that the felt hats are quite astonishingly
bright in color. Scarlet mingles with blue,
and scintilating steel and paste orna
ments are conspicuously displayed. Sable
tails are seen on all sorts and conditions of
hats. Sealskin hats are correct when
made like close toques. Speaking of
toques reminds me that among the loveli
est things in the trousseau of a recent
bride was one of the new white "crocodile"
velvet. It has a brim of dark sable,
just showing glimpses of a rouleau
of rose pink velvet. One side is caught up
with a bunch of shaded violets and a small
plume of white ostrich plumes. I have
just read of a cbapeau which is of a dove
colored felt, the crown being of antique
velours. In the front is a large Jace buw;
at the back are tucked, next to the nair,
violets and pink roses. Oh, just one more
toque must I mention, as it is quite chic,
its crown bÂ°ing of richly embroidered vel
vet, edged with sable, beneath which are
shaded velvet flowers that carry out the
coloring of tha embroidery; atone side a
knot of lace apparently holds in place a
bird of paradise plume.
The latest Parisian novelty in veils is
to be had in fine cream, pink or blue
gauze, with small dots of black chenille.
Nowadays we do not leave oar milliner's
after selecting hats or bonnets; we linger
over the dainty collets, ruches, etc
And quite charming and equally
chic are many of the delightful
conceptions, as, for instance, fur
certainly mingles wonderfully well with
numerous pretty materials and trim
mings, and with truth it may be said that
this season all the young girls particu
larly present such sweet attractiveness in
their high collars and ruffled neck and
shoulders that the onlooker wonders
where the plain faces have gone, as one is
never seen anywhere.
Likewise is it a fact that faces are soft
ened and figures improved by these means,
for the lace, fur and flowers have a happy
effect on stolid, expressionless counte
nances, and figures are declared to obtain
better hues from the width gained at the
shoulders, which always produces the
effect of i-lendernoss. Vogue dilates on
economy in collars:
Economically viewed, two sets of these
collars, with muffs to match, will assist a
small wardrobe in a marvelous manner â
sad that is what ao many girls have de
cided upon. For street wear, church,
shopping and general going about mouf
flon looks its best worn next to pretty
young faces, and its gray shadings go well
with every gown and jacket, as we see con
stantly wnerever we go. For paying visits
and all dressy purposes each one must be
governed by her toilet in selecting or
making for Herself these pretty little ac
quisitions to be worn with it A charm
ing model, and cot an extravagant one.
wnich I happen to know intimately â the
handiwork of the clever girl so often
quotedâ though reaching more into the
region of a shoulder-cape, is all the more
coquettish and picturesque. You are to
imagine the loveliest warm pigeon-gray
velvet â and of that the foundation cape
is built, warmly wadded in wool and lined
with a plush-pink brocade. On this cape
are five bias gathered flounces of the same
velvet, lined with satin to match: and the
lower flounce or ruffle â for they are not
more than five inches wide â is set on the
extreme edge of the cape. The neck is
finished with a double velvet ruffle, formed
into a high collar, and plisse runnings of
gray chiffon curl over and between in the
softest way, extending down both fronts to
the bottom. Makcella.
Romance of the
Great Oil Fields.
Oil operations in the field resemble
nothing so much as military operations,
says the Pittsburg Dispatch. When a
new field Has been discovered, remote
from civilization cr an inhabited country,
the genius of the oil pioneer shines forth.
He cuts roads through trackless forests,
strings telegraph wires, climbs moun
tains and spans waters with pipe lines.
He builds temporary towns, which some
times become permanent. One lucky
strike has made a millionaire out of a la
borer in a night, but the change in his
condition has hardly been swifter than the
change of a barren wilderness to a land
flowing with milk and honeyâ and oil.
Romantic and picturesque in the extreme
was the rise and fall of the Cherry Grove
field. So sudden were the changes they rose
the dramatic. Cherry Grove is in Warren
County. Years before a cherry grove
probably gave tbe place its name, but
when Grace, Dimick & Co. drilled a well
here in 1882 the forest was a thick grove
of hemlock. This was the first well
drilled. It was located on Jot No. 646.
The well became a mystery whose fame
has outlived the Cherry Grove field.
When the well had been drilled in it
was kept surrounded day and night with
shotgun guards. Details of six men each,
every man armed, patrolled the imme
diate vicinity of the well every hour of
the twenty-four. Grace, Diraick <fc Co.
had made wbat they believed to be a
bonanza strike. They were determined to
guard their secret, and the best way they
thought to do that in the oil field was at
the point of a gun.
The shotgun guard only made rival
firms more anxious to know what had
been found on lot No. 646. And the rival
firms succeeded. They obtained knowl-
edge of the dazzling prospect of immense
wealth to be gained at Cherry Grove. The
rivals associated under the name of the
Anchor Oil Company, and on lot No. 647,
adjoining the one on which the mys
terious well was located, another well was
drilled. This well ignited from a gas ex
plosion when drilled in, and for two
weeks threw a pillar of fire in the air,
consuming over 2000 barrels of oil a day.
But that is another story.
The wells were in the heart of a track
less wilderness, the haunts of wildcats
and owls. The Anchor well was nine
miles irom Clarendon on one side and
nine miles from Sheffield on tue other.
There weregbut two farms in the township.
The remainder of the land was owned by
Hortou, Crary & Co., tanners, of Sheffield,
and the Farnsworth Tanneries of Claren
don.
The latter had a plank road running
seven miles into the forest, while the Mor
ton firm had a six-mile road through its
land. There was also a township road,
little better than a bridle path, running at
right angles between the termini of the
plank roals Jeading from Tiona to Ball
town.
Oil flowed from the first well drilledâ
the mystery wellâ on May 19, 1882. In
sixty days from that date, July 19, the
Cherry Grove field was at the heieht of its
production. It was yielding 40,000 barrels
daily.
To reach this result, behold the trans
formation that has taken place. The
Clarendon road had been extended to
Gartield. The Cherry Grove Railroad had
been built a distance of ten miles, from
Tiona to Garneld. The Farnswortu Rail
road had ceen built from Sheffield to Gar
field, a distance of thirteen miles. What
had been a forest five miles wi ie was now
inhabited by 10,000 people. There were
drillers and pumpers, saloon-keepers and
gamblers, butchers, bakers and candlc
stick-rnaKers. Where two months before
travelers had to cut roads turough under
brush, roads were as numerous as streets
m a large city. The National Transit
Company had laid a four-inch pipe to
Kane, a dstance of forty mile?.
The same (ompany had laid a three
inch pipe from tne field to Clarendon,
nine miles. A pumping station had been
built with a battery of eight fifty-horse
power boilers. Two dupiex pumps had
been put together and had a daily ca
pacity of 15.000 barrels each.
Two towns had been built within the
limits of this tractâ Garfield and Farns
worth. Each town had from 1500 to 1800
buildings. The struggle for wealth was at
high tide. This Arabian night's dream
continued two months longer. On Sep
tember 19, exactly four months after oil
flowed from the mystery well, the death
Knell of tne Cherry Grove field was
sounded when the intelligence spread
that salt waterhad made its appearance
in flowing wells.
Almost as quickly as it had risen to
greatness in oildom, the Cherry Grove
field Jell to its former condition â a good
place for rabbits and squirrels. On the
day when the disaster to the field became
known 40,000,000 barrels of oil were in
stock. The market, which had been de
pressed by the field, immediately ad

vancea 25 cents. At an average of 25
cents a barrel this oil in stock alone repre
sented 110,000,000. Soon aft*r that fol
lowed the famous boom to $1 35, which
made and unmade hundieds of lortunes.
All trades nave their tricks, and the oil
business is not the exception. When op
erators make a good strike and desire to
lease surrounding territory as cheaply as
possible, drilling is sometimes stopped
and the well is plugged, and the story cir
culated that the well is a duster. Some
times a plug five feet long is lowered to the
bottom of the well, and is covered with
sand several feet deep. In some cases the
well is boarded up, and after a few weeks
have elapsed the desired land ia quietly
leased.
In the early days of oil excitement,
wnen the name of Pithole was synony
mous with immense wealth, and when
millionaires walked about in that neigh
borhood dressed in jeans, a rich field was
offered to unscrupulous persons. To the
credit ot oil men it can oe said that
they, as a rule, were victims rather than
aggressors. The swindlers were generally
outsiders, who, after having schemed
to get a little money, were never seen
again m those parts, a favorite trick of
these swindlers was to go on selline
shares in oil wells indefinitely. In those
days an average well was worth much
more than it is now, so that one-sixteenth
or even one-thirty-seconrt of a well might
mean a snug fortune. It is said that dur
ing tne Pithole days shams in wells were
sold until forty of fift\* sixteenths had
been sold. No one ever dreamea of hav
ing a swindler like that arrested, for the
simple reason that it would not have paid.
Every minute was precious, and meant
thousands of dollars to the bonanza oil
producers.

?T"*" HE third annual convention of the
/â¢â â ;- Pacific Coast Whist Association has
<jA^ passed into history. A few years
ago whist clubs were hardly known in
this State.
Tue first foothold whist got in San Fran
cisco was when a few whist enthusiasts
met in a room adjoining the writer's office
at -20 Putter street, on the 9th day of Oc
tober, 1891, and completed the organiza
tion of the San Francisco Chess ana Whist
Club, the first club bearing the name of
the City. The charter members of this
club were: S. A. Foster, W. R. Love
grow. M. G. Eyre, M. F. Claflin, A. S.
Howe, E. H. Cole, E. E. Washburn, G. S.
Simons, F. D. Gilbert, J. S. Brownell, R.
J. Hambrook. E. J. Taylor, R. Kendrick,
A. S. Baker. A. Morclon, James S. Snell
ing, J. I>. Kediiing, H. J. Sumtneruays
and P. J. Tormey.
The following were its first officers:
President, Joseph D. Redding; first vice
president, P. J. Tormey; second vice
president. H. J. Summerhays; secretary,
M. F. Claflin; treasurer, A. S. Baker;
governing committee â S. A. Foster, G. A.
Simons and R. Kendnck. This club
flourished for a short while, then dragged
a.ong until the time came when some of
i;s members left the City, and the interest
in the came grew less and less until the
entire expense of supporting the clnb fell
on the few. About the Ist of November,
1892. the spark rekindled. Henry Payot,
with the writer and two or three others,
got the signatures of over 100 to once more
man the ship, and on the 15th of Novem
ber. 1892, the present San Francisco
Club was launched as a sort of
auxiliary to the Mercantile Library Asso
ciation. With the assistance of this noble
institution in the way of nominal rent,
the breakers were passed in safety. This
time ladies were admitted, ana this no
doubt was the chief cause of its final suc
cess. Henry Payot w^s chosen as its first
cresident. It now ranks with the largest
strictly whist clubs in the United States.
About two years ago the club was in
corporated. Since that time George E.
Bates has been its president. Mathias
Meyer is the vice-president. He has the
reputation of being one of the best whist
players in the club.
The next wnist club of importance in
the City is the Trist- Duplicate Whist
Club, named after Mr. N. B. Trist, the
father of American leads. This club was
â formed about eighteen months ago. Mr.
A. C. freeman, one of the leadinz lights
of the bar of thi3 City, was chosen presi
dent. When he had safely guided the desti
nies of the club to "Easy street" he asked
to be relieved of the responsibilities and
now enjoys the privilege of being called
"ex." He is a hard worker in the cause,
and to show his great interest in the game
we all Jove he accepted the chairmanship
of the whist and contest committee. The
club is now :n a flourishing condition, oc
cupying a suite of finely furnished parlors
in the Berkshire. It was not long before
the outside towns and cities caught the
fever. Oakland has at least a dozen whist
club*. The Oakland Whist Club htfs
150 members, witb^ Mr. J. D. Eby presi
dent; the Linda Vista Whist Club is not
quite so large, but ex-President R. B.
Calley says they *'feel bigger.
The beautiful city of Vallejo has one of
the crack clubs of the State, with Mr.
JK>nio as president. This ciub won the
Eideout trophy three times: recently a
h dies' whist club has been organized in
Yallejo. Petaluraa has several whisi
clubs. The "Lomitas >: â a new name for
the Ladies' Duplicateâ and the Petalnma
are the leading ones. One of the whist
critics of The Call, and an exnert player,
resides in Petaiunia, Mrs. F. H. Atwater.
Santa Rosa is not far behind. She has a
good wnist club, and succeeded in show
ing Petalnma how the game was played.
Sacramenio, Alameda, Berkeley, San
Rafael, Hollister and Niles have all got
their whist clubs, and once a year, at
least, they all come together for a love
feast at our annuai whist conventions.
Tne Pacific Coast Whist Association was
formed December 14. 1894, comprised of
fourteen clubs from nearly as many differ
ent cities. How well this association is
known, and where its influence extends,
is best learned by reading the following
congratulatory letters from a dozen or
more of the greatest whist lights in the
world.
The first is from the patron saint of the
Trist Duplicate Whist Club, whose life
size portrait adorns its walls â a man who
is as gentle and tender as a loving mother
to her little babe when he comes in
contact with his whist children. What
woman or man wnose heart was ever
touched with the dart of Cupid but re
members the queer fluttering at the
heart-strings? So it is when he is near;
he is the center of all hearts of the
American Whist League, and also the
center of the hearts of our association, in
fact, as well as the central figure in the
illustrated emblem of the Pacific Coast
Whist Association. It is hardly neces
eary to mention him by name,
JVIr. Nicholas BroWse Jrist,
the father of American leads. His letter
A to tne president of the Pacific Coast
[ Whist Association is as follows:
New Orleans, December 31, 1896.
My Dear Tormey: It is a source of deep re
gret to me that 1 cannot accept your kind in
vitation to be present at the third annual
meeting of the Pacific Coagt Whist Associa
tion. Nothing could give me more pleasure
than to become personally acquainted with
its members, who, judging from the specimens
I know, must all be "trumps,'' and who, I am
sure, appreciate the 6treuuous and successful
efforts of their worthy president in welding all
the whist forces o." the Pacific Coast into one
mighty league, which I sincerely hope will
continue to grow and prosper, fight all fads
a;nl foster sound whist for ail time to come.
With assurance of my kind regards for one
and all of the members of your association, I
remain, cordially yours, N. B. Triht.
The following letters are all addressed
to the president of the Pacific Coast Whist
Association, P. J. Tormey :
Sir William Pole, the great whist philos
opher and author, also an octogenarian,
who Joves whist as he dot-3 his Bible:
London, Eng., Dec. 12, 1896.
Pear Sir: I thank you vary much for your
last letter of i!6ih November and for the kind
exoressicns itcontains. I cannot come to your
festival in January, but I shall hope to read
an account of it; and I can very sincerely re
peat my admiration of the effort you have
made to extend whist on the Pacific Coast. I
rejoice that they have been so successful. Be
lieve me yours very sincerely,
William Pole.
1 From the master "Cavendish."
. \ 22 Albion street, Hyde Park, {
v Ix>*don, EnÂ£.. W., December 12, 1896.)
Dear Sir: Many thanks for your kind invita
tion to be present at the third annual meeting
of the Pacific Coast Whist Association. It is
only the distance which prevents my at
tending.
1 am sorry to hear that you retire from the
office of president, considering all ypu have
done ior whist in Caliiurnia.
Winning continued prosperity to your asso
ciation, I am, yours very truly,
Henry Jones.
From W. H. Wbitfeld, processor of
mathematics at Cambridge, Eng., known
all over the whist world as the great
problem-maker.
Camrridge, Kng., December 12, 1896.
Bear Sir: I have just received your letter in
viting me to attend the convention of the
Pacific Coast Whist Association. Please ac
cept my thanks Jor the honor of the invita
tion. Were it not for the accumulntiou of
inches I should most willingly be present It
is pleasant to feel that, though far away, we
are united In the freemasonry of whist. I live
in hopes that I may perhaps at some future
time visit what is to me the far, far West.
Believe me, yours sincerely.
\V. H. WIUTFELD.
From Major-General A. W. Drayson
of London, late R. A., F. R. A. S., one of
the greatest whist writers and whist au
thorities living:
20 ASHBUKTON ROAD, SOUTHSEAJ
December 14, 1890. j
Dear Sir: Thank you very much for your
kind Invitation to attend the third convention
of the Pacific Coast Whist Association. It is
useless for me to reuret my age and general
shakiness, but these conditions alone prevent
me from crosÃinÂ«Â»the Atlantic.
I have also to thank you for the many ex
cellent cuttings from The Call written by you.
These I read till I have committed them to
memoryâ they are so good.
Your impartiality in dealing with whist mat
ters has been to me most gratifying. One does
not always find such a condition.
I am glad yon have received my letter of
November 13, in which I ventured to make a
few remarks relative to American whist laws.
With kind regards, believe me, yours very
sincerely, A. W. Drayson.
From our whist queen, Miss Kate
Wheelock:
Chicago, Dec. 26, 1896.
Dear Sir: I receives your esteemed favor of
the 20th, asking me to be present at the meet
ing of the Pacific Coast Whist Association. I
have always had a theory that where there is
a will there is a way, but in this case it fails
me. My will is to go, but the thousands of
miles make the way too long, hence I must
send my regrets, and with them goes my best
wishes for a most successful meeting. Having
visited all the large cities interested in whist
from coast to coast as weil as in Europe, I
realize how much good the associations are
doing, and I know of no association more in
terested in the good work than that of
the Pacific Coast, and you certainly ought
to be proud of its i>rogreÂ»sive work during
the time you have been its president. The
growth of the stiuly ot the game is to me won
derful, and each year aecms on the increase,
and I believe that we can Inuv say to-day that
our noble game is thought by all intelligent
people to be the one game that they would
like to excel In. Thanking you for your kind
invitation and regretting exceedingly 1 can
not be among the member?, I remain sin
cerely your friend, Kate Wheelock.
From the president of the American
Whist league, Walter H. Barney:
Pkovidknce, R. 1,, Dec. 22, 1896.
Dear Sir: Yours of the 13th inst., extend
ing me an invitalion to be present at your
third annual meeting, is received. It is much
like an invitation to paradise to a person who
knows that the flaming sword will prevent
his going. Nothing would please me greater
than to visit the coast and to be present at
your annual meeting, but it is impossible for
me to leave here before the time for the mid
winter meeting of the National executive com
mittee.
riease extend to the association my con
gratulations on their prosperity and the good
THE SAN FRANCISCO OALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
work which they have done for the cause in
the three years of your administration. I be
lieve the welfare of whist is to be advanced
even more by the local associations than it
has been by the league, and look forward to
the day when the larger portion of the coun
try will be organized in this way, bringing
about a closer and more intimate relation be
tween the whist players of the different sec
tions. Such a development must advance tne
cause of the National league as w%ll of the
game, so long as all are working together in
harmony.
I very much wish that the two Pacific asso
ciations would come out with a square decla
ration in favor of such harmony by becoming
auxiliaries to the league. I believe it would
lend dignity to the associations and be helpful
to them, and certainly would be a very great
help and support to the league and those who
are working in it for the advancement of the
game.
While independent action is not a source of
immediate danger the continuation of such
policy is almost certain to lead to a divi&lon
of forces that will prevent the best develop

Dear Sir: I wish to acknowledge the receipt
of your Kind invitation to be present at the
opening of your third annual meeting of the
Pacific Coast Whist Association, to be held on
January 8 and 9, 1897.
You express a clouot that I may not be able
to honor you with my presence. You are cor
rect in this. You and your association have
no business to be at the other side of these
United States If you expect a mortal like me
to favor you with my presence. I don't wish
to insinuate that it is not a good place to be,
either for you. the association or myself, for I
can assure you that I am well aware that
there is no place on earth any better than the
Pacific Coast.
I am sure the association has made no mis
take in honoring you as its presiding officer
since its organization, and I am equally sure
that when you pass the gavel to your succes
sor, as you inform me that you are abou t to do,
you can do so with the firm belief that your*
term of office was an entire success; and the
most that I can imagine that I might with for
your association is that your successor may
be one who will take the same interest in the
advancement of whist that I know that you
have done. Yours respectfully,
c. D. P. Hamilton.
From Robert H. Weems, corresponding
secretary American Whist League:
Brooklyn, N. V., Dec. 24, 1896.
Dear Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your invitation to be present at
the third annual meeting of the association
and sincerely regret my inability to acaept.
You have my heartiest wishes for a success
ful and enjoyable meeting and I hope that the
Pacific Coast Whist Association will continue
forever and each and every year grow stronger
and larger and increase the interest in the
noblest intellectual game invented by man.
Most cordially yours, Robert H. Weems.

ing Telegraph:
Philadelphia, Pa., Dec. 27, 1896.
Dear Sir: I regret I cannot attend the meet
ing of your association on January 8 and 9,
but you will realize bow impossible such a
trip is for me. I hope some day b:fore I die
to visit your good City, but when the time
would be I have no idea at present. lam sure
you are to be congratulated upon the great
success of your association and the popularity
of whist upon the Pacific Coast. I hear from
many sources of the good work you are doing
for the game and am sure you are developing
many good players. When I see you we can
talk over the po sibility of a match by corre
spondence between your association and
some Eastern cracks. It looks quite possible
to me.
Please present my best wishes to the whist
ers of the coast for their continued success,
saying to them that I read of their matches
and doings with the greatest interest and am
always with them in spirit though I cannot
be In person, that 1 hope to see them, or rather
some of them, at Put-In- Bay next July, and
that in the interim I will give just one word of
advice. When in doubt wnethcr or not to
chungo the 6uit, Don't. More tricks are lost
by good players by opening up new suits than
in any other way. Ever sincerely.

New York, Dec. 21, 1896.
Dear Sir: I am sorry to say that it will be Im
possible for me to accept your Very kind invi
tation for your annual meeting.
I wish you would send a few of your people
East, just to show us how you work things.
Fur two years we have been trying to get up a
whist association here, but withont success.
It is rather galling to our EaUern pride to'
think that with all our advantages of large
towns near together, and whist clubs by the
dozen, the Pacific Coast can beat us hollow in
the matter of organization. What we cannot
: imitate we must be content to admire, and we
wish you a long and prosperous career. Yours
truly, R. F. Foster. -
From Cassius M. Paine, editor of Whist:
i Milwaukee, Wis., Dec. 31, 1896.
Dear Sir: Please extend my greeting to the
members of the Pacific Coast Whist Associa
tion, and say they are keeping up their end
admirably. Without the encoura?ementfrom
the Pacific Coast interest in the game would
be largely diminished.
I hope at some time in the future to be pres
ent at one of your meetings and make the ac
quaintance of your enthusiasts. Meanwhile
let the good work go on. Yours very truly,

Whist":
Boston, Mass., Jan. 2, 1897.
Dear Sir: Your favor of the 13th ult. ex
tending to me an invitation to attend the
third annual meeting of the Pacific Coast
Whist Association is at hand.
I regret that I shall not be able to attend, as
I take great interest in the various branches
of the Whist League. I understand that you
have a splendid organization and I should
much like to meet with you if it were possible.
I wish the organization all possible success
and prosperity. Keep up the good work.
Just now the American Whist Club of Bos
ton, of which I have the nonor to be presi
dent, is rejoicing in the possession of four
trophiesâ all that could be played for since
the A. W. L. congress. Our team defeated the
Hamilton team and won the A. W. L. trophy
Saturday and on the same day won the New
England Whist Association vice-president
trophy. They also previously won the presi
dent's troohy and successfully defended the
Brooklyn trophy in a match against the N. J.
Whist Association. So I think we have reason
to feel proud.
While 1 am writing I will say a word about
the laws. A ca<e arose In this way: A player
laid down two cards, one covering the other so
completely that uo portion of the lower one
could be seen. It was claimed to be an ex
posed card. The laws conflict a little ou this
point, and I think it might be well to provide
more explicitly for the case. Thanking you
for your kind invitation, I am very truly yours,
Fisher Ames.

you that I cannot be present in person. I am
with you in spirit, however, and feel thatyo ur
meeting will be an entire success under your
guiding hand. I wish the Pacific Coast Whist
Association every measure of success in its
future career, and if you are going to pass the
president's gavel to some other worthy whist
man of your fraternity, I trust you will endow
the instrument with some of that authorita

for which you have long been noted.
Hoping to meet you at the midwinter meet

Dear Sir: 1 have your valued favor of the
13th inst., containing your very cordial
invitation to be present on the Bth and
9th of January next at the opening of the
third annual meeting of the Pacific Coast
Whist Association* It is with more than or
dinary feelings of regret, I assure yob, that I
have to deny myself the pleasure of being with
you on that occasion. I have heard a great
deal of the good work that has been accom
plished through and by your association, ana
it gives me pleasure to congratulate you and
yourcoadiutors for the high degree of success
you have accomplished and for the good you
have done for the scientific sraroe. I trust
that the person who shall succeed you as
president of the association will give the good
work the same active and intelligent atten

this movement and that the Pacific Coast
Whist Association may continue in the future
as it has in the past to lead all sections in the
auxiliaries to the league. The Inatana Whist
Association will have its annual meeting in
the latter part of January, but we have not j
been abl* to work up any enthusiastic repre

not hope that our coming meeting will com

truly yours, Chables E. Coffin.
From Eugene S. Elliott, father and

Tear Sir: lam in receipt of your kind fa
vor of tho 13th inst. inviting me to attend at
the opening of the third annual meetingof the
Pacific Coast Whist Association.
Among my Doyhood dreams none has been
so fondly cherished than that at some time of
visiting the Pacific Coast, and although gray
hairs are now crowding thickly upon my
head, and I can clatnvto be a boy no longer, I
still retain the hope that at no distant time I
can salute the waters of the Pacific through
the Golden Gate; but, unfortunately, the time
is yet in the future, so I must content myself
with sending the Pacific Coast Whist Associa
tion a God-speed and congratulations upon its
hitherto successful career. How much of that
success is due to the faithfulness with which
you have worked in its behalf I presume your
modesty would forbid me to intimate, but I
can assure you that your iriends throughout
| the East will bo sorry when they hear that you
have laid down the gavel.
Will you kindly accept and extend to the
other members of your association my sincere
good wishes and regrets.
I hope to meet you at Nashville next month ;

Dear Sir: J, am in receipt of your favor of
. the 13th inst. inviting me to be present at the
opening of the third annual meeting of the
Pacific Coast Whist Association.
I regret that I, cannot he with you on this
occasion. If Lam not mistaken you were the
first one in the American Whist League to
broach the idea of State association. This was
done by you at a meeting of the executive
committee of the American Whist League in
Philadelphia during the fourth congress. That
your ideas were practical has been illustrated
by the growth, prosperity and success of the
Pacific Coast Whist Association. Yours truly,
'1 HEODORE SCHWARI.
tiohrv T. Mitchell
Is practically the father of duplicate
whist. The first game of duplicate that
we have any record of was played In Lon
don in 1857 by two teams of four, as we
call them now. Matthias Boyce ("Mo
gul"), Henry Jones ("Cavendish"), Daniel
Jones, brother of "Cavendish, 'and Edward
Wilson comprising one team, Messrs.
Izard, Bullock, Chinery and Lewis the
other. It took Mr. Mitchell several years
lo awaken interest in the duplicate game,
but it must make his hear;, thump when
be realizes the thousands of whisters that
sing his praises.
G. D. f. Hamilton Says "Silence."
Discreet people prefer to do one thing at
a time and do it well. The best waist
players know that they cannot do any
thing but play whist while playinc whist.
They find that all their faculties are taxed
to the utmost on reading what the carda
have to say. The best whist and silence
are inseparable. Silence is in harmony
with the dignity and intellectual scope of
the American came of long whist, where
all the cards are played and the play is for
mental recreation.
Gredit to Whom Whist Credit Is
Due.
There is no man in the whist world that
we owa more to than General A. W. Dray
son. The whist writers for the past
twenty years, or right up to o^ate, seem to
be airaici to tell the truth â if they know it
â or afraid it will cause their star to Jose
a little of its brilliancy (?) if they say
I General Drayson suggested this or that.
Several years ago we suggested to "Caven
dish" that he/ write a whist book for be
ginners, and to put into this book not
only tables of 'leads, but tables of second
and third hand play. At that time such
an idea never appeared in print. Three
years later this idea was put into a book
in this country as a new idea. Major-
General Drayson, abont forty years ago,
invented a method of finding the distanca
of objects for artillery practice, but the
system was rejected by the British Gov
ernment as a useless "fad." Fifteen years
after an individual connected with the
Government (a gentleman with a "pull")
rediscovered exactly ttie same thing and
called it "range finding." It was at once
accepted and the individual was well re
warded. "Finding the distance" was a
"fad," but when the same process was
termed "range finding" it was most valu
able. When "Cavendish" first reviewed
Drayson's "Practical Whist" in the Field
he rather ridiculed the idea of what Dray
son called the "antepenultimate" (fourth
best) from six, and when Mr. Trist named
the play fourth best, it was said by "Cav
endish" to be a great discovery. It is
easy to follow and improve, but not quite
so easy to originate.
The whist-players of America are in
debted to General Drayson for this much
that we know of: First, alteration of laws
and adopted by the American Whist
League, with due credit to Drayson; sÂ«c
ond, "Change your suit to trumps," in
stead of callinc for trumps, with its im
portant results; third, the more free use
of trumps (page 111, "Practical Whist");
fourth, calling for trumps in the original
lead; fifth, the reverse discard; sixth, the
lead of the "fourth best" from suits not
headed by high cards in sequence. This
much we know originated with General
Drayson, and the whist editor of The Call
will always try to give credit to whom
credit is due.

Sad Accident to Mrs. Walter ft.
Barr\e\j.
The morning before Christmas in
Providence, R. 1., Mrs. Barney, with her
little son in the sleigh, drove down to the
office with her husband, the president of
the American Whist League. After leav
ing him ihere she started to drive home.
The horse became frightened and ran
away, throwing the occupants out against
an electric light pole, breaking both of
Mrs. Barney's legs and one leg of her little
boy's.
Mrs. Br.rney is known by nearly every
whist-player in the United States. She
always accompanied Mr. Barney on his
whist pilgrimages. It is sad, very sad, to
record such a terrible accident. We dad
a surprise in store for our whist clubs in
this City. It was the intention of Presi
dent Barney and Mrs. Barney to extend
their trip to California after the midwin
ter meeting of the league at Nashville. If
sympathetic words can deaden the pain
and anguish for one short moment, or
make the sad affliction lighter to bear,
we extend a hear : .Uil, and we know all our
whist friends will join with us in wishing
Mrs. Barney and her son a speedy
recovery.

Janus am I, oldest of potentates!
Forward I look, and backward and below.
1 countâ as god of avenues and gatesâ
The years that through my portals come and
go.
I block the roads and drift the fields with
snow,
I chase the wild fowl from the frozen land;
My frosts congeal the rivers in their flow,
My fires light up the hearths and hearts of
men.
H. W. Longfellow.
TH9 NAME OF OUR MONTH.
The ancient Grecians, in tneir strange
yet beautiful religion, believed that when
they came to the end of a year they found
it closed by a strong door.
They also imagined that this barrier was i
guarded by a porter, to whom they gave
the name of Janus, and he alone had:
power to open to them the New Year.
From the name of this heathen god was
the first month of the new year formed.
The Romans also believed in Janus and
erected many shrines tor his worship in
their wonderful city, the principal one be
ing the great Temple of Janus.
Wherever you may chance to see a
painting, statue or any representation of
thi-i trod you will notice that he is given
two heads, because every door and gate
faces two ways.
Thp members and would-be members of
C. K. C. have done splendidly with their
answers and contributions this week.
The way in which you are interested in
this work is very gratifying to your editor,
and makes it worth while to try to inter
est you.
Don't ever think you write too often,
because your letters are always welcome.
Please be careful to state whether your
stories and puzzles are original or selected,
and write your names in a good, legible
hand.

Chuckling at their indignant negatives,
he continued, "Well, I ain't, myself, be
cause I never saw one. You can go that
way home and see the berries. I'll put on
my rubber suit and go with you" ; and
although they assured him they knew the
way, he would accompany them "in such
a good cause."
On the way they passed several clumps
of berry trees, but all had been robbed of
their ruddy fruitage. However, when
thny reached the adobe they were de
lighted to see the groups of tree* glori
ously bedecked with their beautiful warm
red berries.
"Are these enough?" questioned Mr.
Davis.
"Oh, twice as many as we need, thank
you. Ain't they lovely? Won't Miss
Mutter like them!"
"When do you want them?'
"We will get them ilonuay. You see
Tuesday's Christinas, and the decorations
must be finished Wednesday morning.
The teachers arrive at noon Wednesday."
"Well, take them when you want."
After thanking him heartily the boys
went home, enthusiastic over "old man
Davis," and positive that their berries
would cast the other fellows' truck into
the shade."
Sunday afternoon the cloudn parted
and the pun smiled so bewitchingly tliat
people forgot his late desertion and hast
ened outdoors to pay him homage.
Mrs. Sales, Joe and Ruth spent an hour
on the beach, letting Miss Thistledown
Lightness, as one of her admirers named
her, run to her heart's content.
On their way home they saw approach
ing them the two Garcias, each loaded
down with a gigantic basket heaped with
bunches of Christmas berries.
"O mater! My heart tells me those are
our berries. I must find out," and he
accosted Jacinto, the elder brother.
"Hello, Jacinto. Do you want to sell
some berries?"
'None of these," and be set down the
heavy basket while he paused. "These
go to the city. Do you want me to get
you some?"
"No. I guess 1 can get some. Did you
get these near?"
But here Pedro called out in the Spanish
dialect, "Jacinto, come on. Stand tnere
talking ami the ghost will get us when we
go for the next load. Come ou." Jacinto
obeyed.
Joe whispered, "What did he say,
mater?" Mrs. Sales had been raised
among Spanish families and spoke their
ton.cue as her own, so she readily inter
preted for him.
"Ou, mater, you don't need me now.
Lei me hunt up the boys. We must save
our berries."
"But, Joe, these boys are earning their
Jiving selling berries ; besides I can't have
you quarrel with them."
'â¢I promise not to quarrel, and there are
plenty berries lor all if v they only leave us
our share. Do let me go.' 1 At her nod of
consent he kissed her and added, "Don't
â¢xpeut me till after dark. We mutt go
and see how many are left." And
kiss to baby Ruth he was off.
By the time Joe had found both the
boys his mind was full of a plan for out
witting the Mexicans.
"You see it is 4 o'clock now. They can't
get to their house, unload their basKets
and get back those two mile 3 before just
dark. If we can rig up a cbost it will
frighten them away for good. 1 '
"I don't want to take a hand in fright
enine them," remonstrated Bert. "Just
remember they believe in ghosts and won't
be able to see the joke."
"Well! I'd never have thought of it if
Pedro hadn't suggested it. I don't see
what else to do."
"I thinK it's all right," agreed Will.
"We told Miss Nutter we'd get the berries,
and we can't break our word, can we?
And Mr. Davis gave those berries to us,
and the greasers had no right to take
them after taking all the others. I'm with
you, Joe. 1 '
By dint of much coaxing tbey got Bert
to accompany them, and, armed with a
sheet, a candle and a small gray pumpkin,
they finally reached the adobe and imme
diately prepared the ghost. The head
they made as they often had, a jack-o'-lan
tern. They pinned the sheet around and
into the head. Then Will held the pump
kin on his head and, with sheet falling
around him and light shining through the
cavities of the pumpkin, he made an ap
parition that might have startled even a
brave heart on a dark night. Then they
sat waiting for the victims.
Dust deepened into darkness, and sud
denly they were startled at hearing:
"Joe! Joe Bales! Your little sister's

sick. O, Joe! Joe Sal-s! Your mother]
wants you. Cinto's gone for the doctor, \
Your sister's sick" â all in Pedro Garcia's ;
hoarse voice.
With a bound Joe was out in the dark
ness and the other boys followed, though
Will suggested, "It's only a trick." "No;
his voice is frightened," replied Bert.
"Pedro! Tell me quicKâ quick! Is it
true? Is Ruth sick?" But as he heard
the quick breaths of the Mexican he
waited not for the "yes," but raced home
ward. Will and Bert started after him,
with Pedro at their heels. Never had uny
of them made two miles in better time.
As Joe opened the kitchen door he saw
Jacinto putting wood in the stove, his
mother, with Ruth in her arms, in her
low rocker before the firo and the doctor
standing beside her, talking softly.
"She's better now, thank God," said his
mother as Joe knelt at her side. The '
little sister opened her eyes, her lips I
formed a weak little smile, her tiny hand i
just touched his hair, and she sank into a
quiet slumber.
"The danger is over," said the doctor.
"Just keep her warm, and if she wakes
give her a teaspoonful of this medicine.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
She will be all right in the morning.
You won't need me any more." With
parting greetings he left them.
Joe had to swallow down a pood many
sobs and wipe away a great many tears
before he could hear what had occurred.
It seems that after her walk Ruth had
been very quiet and soon fell into a
stupor. About dusk she, was seized by an
attack of croup. Mrs. Sales rushed wildly
to the door to call some one to summon
the doctor. Just then Jacinto and Pedro
wi re passing on their way to get another
load of berries', and she addressed them in
Spanish, beseeching one to run for Dr..
Hunt and the otner for Joe, up at the
haunted adobe. Throwing their baskets
over the tence, they were cff like startled
deer, one in each direction. After some
difficulty in finding him, Jacinto brought
the doctor and Baby Ruth was saved.
"Jacinto!" was all Joe could say as he
wrung the Mexican's hand, but tone and
eye expressed the gratitude that words
could not reach.
with a
A ]<mk tap at the door diverted their at
tention. Knowing it to be the boys, Joe
and Jacinto stepped out on the porch.
"The baby's better, old fellows, but I
can't talk. You tell Jacinto all about it.
Let him have Uie berries. He saved Ruth's
life. Jacinto! Pedro!" â ana he took a
hand of eachâ "l aidn't believe I was
such a sneak. Don't biams the boys; it
was all my fault. Count me as your
friend from to-night. Good-night, fel
lows; I must go to my mother," and he
passed into the house.
The boys were silent a moment. (Will
afterward confided to Bert that Joe's "my
motner" awed him more than anything
else.) Then Bert made explanations.
When Jacinto understood all, he asked,
in a pained voice: "Why didn't you tell
me? Miss Nutter's been good to us. I'd
get her berries if I knew she wanted
them."
"It's because we wanted to do all our
selves. We didn't have much sense, but
we're sorry and we hope you'll give us
your hand."
After a general handshake, it was de
cided that the four boys would collect the
remaining berries on the morrow, and,
after Miss Nutter had selected sufficient,
Jacinto would ship what were left 10 the
city.
"It doesn't matter much abont these,"
he said, "for most people have bought
their Christmas berries already."
At the association the berries glowed
and sparklea and nodded to each other,
fully satisfied that a Christian cheerful
ness pervaded the land.

Johnny Busy's Johnny
Glad.
Bettor than a fortune is the gift of ft
cheerful, sunny disposition. No one could
afford to surrender the blessing if in ex
change fifty thousand a year were offered,
for, after all, happiness is the great good
of life and with a melancholy spirit there
is neither comfort nor enjoyment.
Cheerfulness has been called the bright
wenther of the heart, and happy the one
with whom the bright weather is in
herent. But the faculty is susceptible of
cultivation, and nothing promotes its
growth better than employment.
"Johnny idle is Johnny sad. But
Johnny busy is Johnny glad."
"A merry heart doeth good like a medi
cine," says the Bible, and even in these
days, when medicines have much higher
healing qualities than of old, a happy
frame of mind will do more for a man
than all the doctors' skill can.
Domestics belong to the hire class of
society.
A Useful Ornament.
Secure a clay pipeâ one with the knob
well up on the bowl â then carve eyes and
mouth upon it, shaping the knob for the
nose. By blackening the outline of the
eyes, eyebrows and mouth and coloring
the hair, the face can be made quite effec
tive.
Insert the stem of the pipe in a spool
of linen thread, such as is used for sewing
on shoe buttons. Make a skirt of black
silk, quite full and lone enough to cover
the spool. Cut out a waist of any bright
color silk, shirring it tichtly about neck
and belt.
Fit on a cape of black and a hood of any
desired color, with a wide frill all around.
On the inside of the cape sew two pieces
of white flannel for needles, and attach a
small silk bag to her waist containing shoe
buttons.
Though quite attractive as an ornament
made of a common pipe, the old lady will
always be handy with needles, thread and
buttons.

To a Boy
Who Wanted Sugar to J^laUe the
Kisses QroW.
Kisses are sweet,
Give me a plenty
One's not enough,
I must have
twenty.
Love makes them
grow,
Sugar can't do it;
They root in the
heart,
And come up right through it.
Give of them freely
As time flies past ;
With a soul full of love
They grow very fast.
Twenty for grandma,
The same for Aunt Kate,
Put in a letter,
Will reach them
at 8.
Tu'enty for Ida ;
See with what
fleetness
They are hurrying
to her
To give her their
sweetness.

She'll want a caress ;
Just send her a tubful,
They'll go by express. F. M. W.

Aim at her and you'll do pretty well."
"All right, sir," said Par, and just then
the farmer was called away to the barn.
Ten minutes later he returned, and was
horrified to see that the plow had been

Legend of Robin
Redbyeast
What time the Christ to Calvary was led
And hung all bleeding on the cross of same,
Wnile frenzied hordes reviled and mocked
his nam>.',
O'er thorns ihe golden aureole's flame was
shed.
When o'er his face death's deadly pallor spread
And one great cry of anguish shook his
frame,
On rapid wings a pitying robin came,
And fluttered sorrowful about his head.
From out the wounded brow, with eager beak,
The robin plucked a thorn, when like a tear,
Upon its breast one drop'of lite-blood fell.
And even now the blessed mark will speak,
From every robin's bosom, of the dear
And tender pity that he knew so well.
The Blind Quadrille.
The "blind quadrille" is generally voted
the drollest sort of a performance oq rec
ord; it invariably results in shouts of un
controllab c laughter.
Its plan of procedure is this: Four cou
ples who are blindfolded attempt to go
correctly through the figures of a qua
drille. In this, however, they miserably
fail and wobble about in out-of-the-way
corners of the room and fall over furni
ture in a condition at once helpless nnd
ridiculous. For example, in th* ladies'
chain, ihey imagine they are performing
it gracefully and properly, but, oh dear,
no! for they are scattered about the room
in various places. The same grotesque
antics form part of every measure of the
dance. Their attempts to look dignified
are futile and the performance is often
concluded in an obscure corner of the
drawing-room amid shouts of merriment
from the onlookers.

How to Make a Ballon
It is easy enough to make a neat little
balloon at a cost of only a few cent*.
Buy; several large sheets o! stout tissue
paper and cut them into fourteen sec
tions the shape of that shown in the pic
ture, and of such size as you may wish â
three feet is a good length. Now paste
these strips together at their edges, being
careful to leave no slits nor holes any-
where in the balloon. Trim the bottom
off evenly all around, ana in the neck
fasten a circular piece of thin wire by
folding over the tissue-paper and pasting
it down firmly. Now provide two cross
pieces of wire, which may be hooked to
the circular piece, as shown in the pic
ture. Where these pieces cross fasten a
piece of soft cotton.
To inflate the balloon have some boy
hold it up by the top; then dip the cotton
in alcohol and set it afire, being very care
ful not to let the blaze touch the tissue
paper. The hot air will expand the bal
loon and cause it to rise to a great height.
Any boy or girl can make this balloon.

Â»^*iEW people are aware of the strange
li^J labors imposed upon the scientific in
i^\ vestigator in search after knowledge,
'in the field of material physirs there are
some remarkable features, which, when
exploited, disclose curious facts and con
ditions that sharpen the curiosity and en
courage yet further research in pursuit of
the ultimate conclusion. It is a field
which presents most enticing prospects,
and each incursion stimulates the ex
plorer to yet further effort, in the hope of
arriving at the complete knowledge of its
mysteries. Powerful as are its attractions
to the inquiring mind, they are incom
parable to those which half disclose
themselves when the boundary line is
cTossed which surrounds the domain of
the immaterial.
The study of psychophysics, the deter
mination of the relations between physi
cal stimuli and psychic action in the pro
duction of sensations, has always engaged
the deepest consideration and the ex
penditure of skilled energy of the pro
foundest minds. It involves the settle
ment of the question: What is life?
Where does it reside?
The written history of the world is re
plete with records of the arduous labors of
investigators of this absorbing subject.
Great minds have speculated and philoso
phized without definite conclusion, while
some bold students have enunciated a
mathematical formulation that, if th* sen
sation is to increase by apparently equal
differences of intensity, the stimulus must
increase by equal ratios; that is, an arith
metical series of sensations corresponds to
a geometrical series of stimuli. The
Btimulus immediately antecedent to the
sensation is directly proportionate to it,
but has been modified by the organs of
sense and conduction so as to be no longer
directly proportional to the external
stimulus. The psychophysical interpre
tation of this apparent law regarding the
relation between stimulus and sensation
is an important ultimate fact.
The materialistic schools define life as
being that state of protoplasm of an ani
mal or plant capable of what is termed
"metabolism," that is, alteration or
change under proper conditions. So far
as it goes, such definition is good, but we
are desirous that it should go further; we
want to have defined the psychic side of
To Produce Artificial Respiration
M'iEDIGAL men have for years been
' investigating ancient records and
J) experimenting on new ideas in
the hope of discovering some method of
artificial respiration that wouid prove not
only successful, but would be easy of adop
tion and free from danger.
It has been held by many men promi
rent in the .world of medicine tliat hidden
away in the archives of the ancient in-

formation could be found in this regard
which would practically revolutionize the
manner of life-saving, but up to now
nothing of moment has been found; that
iÂ«, nothing old has been revived. Never
theless, the old and clumsy method
adopted and now used by many of our
public departments must soon give way
to more advanced science, and it is safe to
say that before the year just born gives
I lace to 1898 a new method of life-saving
will be taught in every public school
throughout the land.
The method used by the "First Aid to
the Injured" and Known as the Sylvester
method is so well known that it will be
necessary to touch only upon it suffi
ciently to explain its defects, and there
are manyâ some even so serious ai to be
dangerous. Indeed, it has been said time
and again by different professors of
anatomy that of the deaths from drown
ing on record fully one- third can be has
tened by the 'â¢assistance" by the "First
Aid to the Injured."
These repeated statements have caused
no little friction between the regular phy
sician and those anxious to save human
life wherever possible without s thought
of payment for their services, and as in
I all cases the friction thus caused has given
\^ birth to investigation, which fortunately
in the case has given a new impetus to
Brience in the discovery of a system of
producing artificial respiration, which is
both simple, inexpensive (if that may be
considered), absolutely devoid of danger
and almost certain of successful results.
According to the present method, when
respiration is to be artiticially re
stored, the subject is laid upon his back, ,
this life. We regard the soul and the in
telligence as one and the same thing. To
analyze it we must first ascertain its loca
tion, its place of abode in the human
body.
It has remained for an American to
make the first bold attempt to unravel
the mystery. To-day the search is being
patieutJy conducted by an American
scientist in his retreat situated upon the
western slope of the Rocky Mountains in
Arizona.
Some years ago a close student of the
phenomena of life became desirous of
prosecuting his researches yet further
than legal limits permitted. The summer
of 1594 was spent by Dr. ia tne
Rocky M untains. While there he was
the witness of a speedy meting of justice
to a criminal who had been caught red
handed by the avengers of his crime.
The man was hanged to a tree and left
there by his judges and executioners.
Dr. visited the place of execution
about sunset and found the culprit sus
pended from the tree, partly supported
by his feet resting in the fork of a small
limbs, a position into which his struggle
had undoubtedly placed him. Filled with
the desire to make certain sureical investi
gations the doctor cut down the body,
when to his surprise he found that life
was not extinct. As he knelt beside the
body it occurred to him that the oppor
tunity which he had long hoped for had
arrived.
The body before him was that pf a male
factor whose living was a menace and a
pest to society. Outraged justice bad in
flicted her penalty, and to all intents and
purposes the man was dead. Should he
not avail himself of so opportune a.i oc
currence and use the spared remnant of
the wretch's existence to forward the
knowledge for which intelligent human
ity was craving? Hastily opening his
pocket-case, Dr. poured a few drops
of a powerfnl narcotic between the lips of
the insensate man, and then lifting the
limp form upon his horse, returned with
his buroen to the log hut in the canyon.
A simple-minded fellow was the doctor's
sole companion, and but slight explana
tion was necessary to explain to him the
presence of the body. The doctor sent his
servant without delay to the nearest tele
graph station, forty miles away, with a
his chest being elevated by placing the
most convenient thing at hand under hi 3
shoulders. Then the almost barDarons
process begins. The hands of the life
saver are placed upon the chest of the
subject and pressed downward with a
steady and regular force. It is recom
mended that the weiphtof the operator be
thrown upon the hands by a forward
movement o; the body, and indeed if this
is not done there is little hope of again
having the subject breathe, without in
any event he would do so.
This practice of pressing the chest is
perhaps the most dangerous of any trmt
could be imagined. It is rarely that arti
ficial respiration is necessary, except in
cases of drowning, in which, before con
sciousness is lost, the lungs are invariably
filled with more or less volume of water.
When this is the case, heavy pressure on
the chest means simply double the same
pressure on the lungs, and in many in
stances the water is forced through the
fibrous tissue until the lungs are practi
cally shattered. The result of this is ex
actly tbe same as that found in an ad
vanced stage of consumption, except that
their lungs, being free from disease, may
heal without much trouble. But it must
not be supposed that the healing of the
lungs leaves the person as physically
strong as before. Dozens of air cells have
been burst. Their usefulness is forever
gone. Consequently, the volume of respi
ration is diminished, and pulmonary
disease is something that can be looked
forward to in the near future with cer
tainty.
Another old method often used to-day
with more or loss success is to place the
subject face down over a barrel and roll
backward and forward until the chest is
relieved of its burden of water before try
ing to produce artificial respiration. This
has been found to work fairly well, except
that in some cases the blood vessels have
been badly broken, thus making the cure
quite as dangerous as the disease.
Ail these difficulties have had to be con
sidered and avoided before serious consid

carefully worded message to a well-known
friend in Denver, who like the doctor, was
an eager student and an accomplished
scientist. In five days the Denver friend
arrived at the hut. In the meantime the
criminal had been kept in a state of
lethargy. A rough conveyance was con
structed and the body of the criminal re
moved to a place close to one ot the lar er
mountain towns on tne line of the Santa
Fe .Railroad. Then began the series of
experiments herein recorded.
THE MYSTERIOUS SPINDLE-SHAPED OBJECT.
Doctor and his friend occupied a
small house at the rear of which was a log
structure which to all outward appear
ances would have been taken for a corn
crib. No windows and hut one door
pierced the walls. The building was, how
ever, well lighted by a skylight. In the
center of this outbuilding stood a large
solid table upon which was placed the
body.
Already the doctor had ascertained that
f eration could be given to any innovation
I but this has been done, and to-day there is
in vogue a system producing ariificial
| respiration that is as near perfection as
[ seems po^sible.
The principal advantage of this new
method is its t-implicity. The subject is
piaeed upon his back much in the same
position as in the Sylvester method, but
the support under tho shoulders is placed
there to elevate the chest, and must be
from eight to twelve inches high and nar
row enough to tit between the shoulder
blades if possible in order to allow an ex
tended chest expansion by the forcing
back of the arm. Once this position is
secured tbe arms are slowly raised up
ward as far as possible without producing
a strain, and then they are tied together.
Upon examination it will be found that
when this is accomplished the thorax is
wide open, and that in order to rid the
lungs of any water they may contain all
that is necessary is to turn the (subject on
his stomach and elevate the feet.
" : Once the water is out of the lungs the
subject is again placed upon his back, and
artificial respiration is produced ; by ; a linn
and regular : pressure Ã¼by.u by. the two thumbs
upon the thorax. The subject is grasped
round the neck much in the mariner that
would be adopted in endeavoring to
strangle a person. < The pressure must be
proceeded with at a rate of about twenty
times to the minute, and it will be found
that breathing begins almost at once, it
is, of ] course, necessary to keep the hands
well to the back of the head. This can be i
accomplished by placing any weight on
them that may be handy, as they, being
tied together/ can be bandied with ease.
: This system has': been discovered by an
Italian i physician named Calliano, who is
at present one of the leading medical au
thorities in Rome. 1: His experiments have
proved highly satisfactory, in i every case,
and in 'the near future ;it L is" his intention
to travel ',- through the ' various ; : ; leading
cities of tne world and expound his new
method before \ the principal medical col
leges.
complete unconsciousness could be main
tained without impeding the continuance
ot the manifestation termed "life." The
insensible body had been regularly
nourished by means of proper liquid foods
administered through a tube inserted into
the stomach through an Incision in the
wall of the sack.
From the 14th of September, 1894, up to
the present time there hav<Â» been experi
ments had within the wa Is of the log
building which have never before been
equaled in kind or character. It is the
belief of Dr. , and his co-laborer, that
all phyical life must have its power of
continuance coexistent with the psychic,
and consequently located in the same spot.
Reasoning from this assumption, they
hold that, until that certain spot or loca
tion is exterminated, life will continue,
and therefore its exact location in trie
human economy is determinate by a sys
tematic approach, consisting of the suc
Dr. Calliano expects to reap no other re
ward for his teaching than the satisfac
tion he will derive from the Knowledge
that thousands of lives will be saved
owing to his research. He is most anxious
to give information concerning his dis
covery, and upon application will readily
supcly physicians with ail the technical de
taih, which are, of course, of little inter
est to the penpral public.
Besides tliose mentioned there are
many other advantages to bo seen in Dr.
Calliano't method. The labor to the op
erator is greatly lessened, thus enabling
one man alone to handle a subject. There
is absolutely no danger from contusion of
t!ie shoulder- joints, but i-erhaps the fea
ture which will meet with most general
approval ia found in the fact that even the
most uneducate I person can ltarn the
entire method in five minute?.

Oh, siren of the river Eel,
Thou singest as 1 float along
Above thj' crystal waters' flow.
I bear the music of my song,
Now soft and low, now wildly sweet;
Now uprightly, as the dashing sprays;
Now loud, as though the Storm-King's voice
Resounded o'er thy watery ways;
Now tender as a lonely maid,
Who bicKher truant love return,
And tearful, es though half afraid
He would her loving summons spurn.
Thus listening here I wonder not
That men will seek thy moon-lit shrine,
Where bend the trees and bloom the flowers,
And trails tlie fair arbutus-vine,
And fishermen will leave their toil,
And caring naught for life or death.
Will madly seek to clasp thy form
And tasto the sweetness of thy breath;
Though nevermore their boats Rre seen,
And nevermori they fly their nets,
And evermoro the dimpling stream
For their familiar lftu?h'er frets.

MmJf one o the most interesting these
days is Miss "Bossie" Mulhali. Accord
ing to the baptismal register her name is
Agnes, but down in Oklahoma Territory
records of that sort command small at
tention. Miss Mulhali is the most fear
less rider of her sex who has ridden a
broncho in the West for many moons.
Those who Know say that half of the
marvels she accomplishes have never
been told.
To gain the place in public esteem that
Miss Mulhall holds is no easy Task in that
section of the country. Not only has she
gained it. however, but sbe holds it with
the tenacity of the proverbial leech. Sue
is the dauenter of "Z ich" Muihail, the
livestock agent of the Frisco railroad, the
only daughter of a famous fa:her, for the
cattleman who does not know "Zacb."
Mulhali must be a tenderioot indeed.
There have been all sorts of stories
written of the mysterious heroine of the
range, most of which were directed at
Miss Mulhall, but this is the first time the
actual story of her personality has been
gleaned from facts. The accompanying
illustration, which is drawn from a photo
eraph, is the only truthful one that has
ever appeared in any newspaper, far Mis 3
Muihullisas modest as she is capable,
and it would be difficult to pay her a
higher compliment.
Those who hava riddan the range in the
Southwest well know that it is a task
which calls for constant pluck and iron
endurance. The cowpuncher must be as
strong as his broncho tnd his nerve equal
to tho "gun" that be carries in his hol
ster.- Therefore it is wise for those who
hnve'had no experience to dismiss from
their minds the idea that it is no great
task fir a woman to become one of the
rough riders of the plains. If there are
those who insist on retaining the idea let
them try the actual experience. There is
nothing more convincing.
Miss Muihall is only 18 years old, but
the fame of her accomplishments extends
to every cattleman in Texas Oklahoma
and the Nation. Nature made her a bru
nette or ginally and her active out-of-door
existence has added several shades to the
darkened linge that originally graced her
cheeks. She is by no means an ethereal
young lady, but is the possessor of an ad
mirable figure, surmounted by an admir
swiftly following thÂ» healing of previous
removals. Next came bolder steps. It
was found that certain of the internal or
gans were not essential to the prolonga
tion of the phenomena of life and they
were successfully extirpated. The lungs,
the liver, the kidneys, and lastly, the en
tire abdominal viscera were removed.
Still life existed in the remaining mass.
The ribs had, piece by piece, been taken
away. There was not any canal remain
ing through which might course ihe
ruddy stream of life, and consequently no
further need of the mighty cardiac pump,
and so the heart wns d^pensed with. As
yet the seat of life had not been found,
Where would it be found, if ever?
Then followed experiment after experi
ment so weird and awful that even the
imperative demands of scientific research
could not blind the gha-tiiness of the
work. Piece by piece the vertebra was
separated and removed; the skull was
next operated upon, each suture dissected
and the entire cranium taken away. And
life still continued!
Here came doubt and deliberation. It
has been the popular belief for ages that
the brain was the seat of intelligence, and
therefore of directive life. Yet science
has been unable to point out in the brain
that seat. Medical and surgical science is
aware that the brain maybe wounded and
a portion destroyed without any sensible
change in tbe intellectual faculties. Al
cohol clouds the intellect. Even in the
case of the insane science can prove
nothing except their misfortune. One
Hemisphere of the brain may be atrophied
and vision continue equally good in both
eyes. The seat of the motor principle of
life is unknown to science. True, in man
the proportion of his brain with his in
tellect places an immense interval be
tween him and tbe most gifted lower
animals. But is it the brain alone? Some
speculators have supposed that the cere
bral lobes were the seat of tbe soul.
Others have held fiat the gray cortical
matter was the abode of the intellectual
faculties, while some place tbe intellect as
residing in the anterior lobes of the en
chalon, the moral qualities of the mind
domiciled in the middle lobes and tbe
animal faculties in the posterior lobes.
But the qu stion is. How much is specula
tion, how much is fact?
able and a very pretty face. Her abundant
dark hair is generally worn upon the top
of her bead, because it is always easier to
wear a sombrero that way, or a cap, as in
clination may suggest.
Miss Mulhali does not hesitate to ride
man fashion, as they call it in the land of
the steer and lariat. She can cinch a Cal
ifornia saddle upon her broncho with a
grace and a skill equal to that of the best

cowpuncher ol them all. It isn't neces
sary for her to grasp either horn or pom
mel of the saddle if she doesn't choose to
to mount the wicked little Deast that she
best likes lo ride. Of course every cow
puncher expects to be able to do the same
thing, but witti a woman it is different.
Reasoning upon the conclusions drawn
from a consideration cf these enuncia
tions, Dr. and his confrere decided to
take one yet bolder step. The entire
frontal portion of the brain, the cerebrum,
was removed. Life remained !.
Such profound investigations could not
be allowed to pasa unknown to other sin
cere and trustworthy investigators. Sev
eral of Dr. 's co-laborers in the field of
metaphysics were judiciously advised, and
at the close of the past month (November)
there assembled within the walls of the
log building a small but distinguished
gathering of men renowned in surgical
and medical lines, assembled to view and
discuss the remartcabie case there pre
sented. Upon a plain pine table, reposing
upon- a mass of antiseptic cotton, was a
spindle-shaped object about twenty-three
inches long, having a oulbous termina
tion at its superior extremity, and near
the middle of its length a small sack-like
appendage which was connected by means
of a de:icate glass tube with a system of
Wolfe's jars. It was a grayish, pulpy
mass, rounded and smooth, divided along
its length by a fissure in which a layer of
white substance connected the two
halves of the symmetrical tube. Was i
alive? Yea. From the median furrow
innumerable spider-web-looking fibers
and filaments, each of short length, pulsa
ted with slow expansion and contraction.
It lived. It was the seat of life of the
thing called man. It was the principle
which passionate hands had sought to ex
terminate two years before upon the
branches of the tree in the canyon of Ari
zona.
The results of this most remarkable
investigation may not, for very many
years at least, find their way to enrich the
general Knowledge of the lay masses. But
those students of the deeper problems of
life will soon be enlightened by the sum
marized conclusions of the learned doctor
and his confidential co-worker.
To be able to positively assert that life
resides in a certain definable spot within
the human economy is to confer upon
surgery a boon unsurpassable, for with
such knowledge humanity may then be
treated in a manner at once heroic, swift
and sure, in every case where is required
the presence of the surgeon or physician.
F. M. Close, D.Sc.
Not an easy trick to learn, and one which
requires great agility and judgment, for
the bronco is quite as likely to move as he
is to stand still.
The accompanying illustration shows
Mis 3 Mulhali in the costume she wears
when she rides astride. When thus clad
there is no wolf or deer hunt that she will
hesitate about engaging in. As for fol
lowing the hounds, as the Eastern hunts-
men have it, she is yet to engage in a
chase of this sort where she has not been
in at the death. Many a wolf scalp does
she own, and they are all rightfully hers,
too, because she shot the wolves and
scalped them herself. She is a sure shot
with a rifle or shotgun, and knows exactly
the spot in the anatomy of the deer in
which to place the bullet.
Now, Miss Mulhall is a very up-to-date
rider. Her rope is of the finest rawhide,
r.nd she has muscle sufficient to cast it well
and properly. Her pony is well trained of
course, and that is half the battle. In fact
it has been said that if the cowpony could
only throw a rope there would be no neces
sity of having a rider at all. All the
requisites of a rider are, however, possessed
by Miss Mulhall, and those who know de
clare that she roped her first steer with the
skill of a veteran.
With all these accomplishments, she can
break a broncho with skill and dexterity.
That is an ugly task on general principles.
T;.e broncho is always vicious before he is
broken. It is just as natural for him to
bite and kick as it is for a Mississippi
River mate to use profanity, and there is
nothing more natural than that in all the
world. In the first place the pony has to
be roped, and it is a fine dance he
leads whoever has the lariat after that hap*
pens.
These are the things that Miss Mulhall
has endured. She looks at them lightiy,
and many a girl in* Smith and Wellesley
looks with far more terror upon the an
nual "exam" than does this young woman
upon what many a man would hesitate a
long while before attempting.
With all her accomplishments of out-of
door life she has never neglected those
things which help make a woman so at
tractive. There is nothing in her appear
ance or demeanor that savors in the least
of the rough edge which frontier life is
supposed to impart. Thoroughly cultured
and refined, she receives her father's
friends from the city at her beautiful
home just outsidn of Mulhall, O. T.,
with the same finished demeanor that one
observes in the hostess in metropolitan
society. Hard indeed it is to recognize in
Mi s Muihall, the St. Louis society girl,
"Bossie" Mulhall, the cowgirl of the
Southwest. Yet they are one and the
same.
And this is a true story that will be cor
roborated by any Southwestern cattle
man who has ever known the girl that Is
the pride of every rider of the range.

flashing boy who bears on his own cap
able shoulders the whole weight of "Shaun
Rhue" at the Columbia. He is a mis
chievous fellow, full of the aged Harry,
but there is a warm, true heart beating in
Larry's breast, and you could not find a
keener wit nor a more wheedling tongue
in the whole countryside than his. Larry
teases and makes Jove with boyish verve,
foils the villains with the skill of a diplo
mat, and from beginning to end of "Shaun
Rhue," whea any one gets into troubleâ
and a good many of the characters do get
into troubleâ know that there is no
need to worry, for Larry, stanch and true,
will bob up serenely in time to make the
villains sing small and the virtuous thank
heaven that Larry Is there to save them
from impending disaster.
Last week Larry was not himsell
though. John Murphy played his part very
genially, but he came !ar from looking it.
I could not help thinking how very Impru
dent Larry was, at his lime of iiie to be
out in a damp churchyard, weening on a
grave, when he ought to have been sitting
comfortably at his am fireside, with nice
warm slippers ou his feet, a loose
wadded wrapper on his limbs, and a wee
drop ol the creetur at his side. It seemed
positively inhuman to drag Larry in his
old age out into a churchyard and put
him to so much toil and trouble to weep
over the tomb of a moiher who, in the
natural course of events, must have been
under the sod for many years. Now I
come to think of it, John W. Burton, who
played Larry's father, was a decade or
two younger than his son, so there is no
knowing how young his mother was. But
no amount of youtafulnes3 on the part of
the rest of the family could disguise the
fact that Larry was a gentleman of ma
ture years, and his boyish pranks were
quite unbecoming tne respect due to his
age. It is really to be regretted that John
Murphy does not possess the art of mak
ing up to look young, for barring his ap
pearance, he makes a very sympathetic
Larry Donovan.
Talking of an Irish play reminds me
that the great charm of Irish drama gen
erally lies in its touches of human nature
â its reproduction of the characteristic say
ings and doings of a warm-hearted, impul
sive people. An Irish drama that was not
true to Irish life would fall as flat as a
pancake, and this remark ought to apply
to the characteristic drama of any iand.
The great charm of "The Old Homestead"
js its characteristic portrayal of New Eng
land rural life and character, and I be
liere that a play which ia not true to tiie
scenes and types of character it is sup
posed to reflect can never be a really
great play. The country that is most
ridiculously misrepresented on the mod
ern stage is Rujsia, and yet Russia is a
land that teems with legitimate material
for the dramatist. At present our play
wrights have almost exclusively confined
themselves to melodrama when they deal
wiih Russian scenes, and they do it on
the principle that in melodrama a writer
is not expected to be true to any kind of
life.
"In the Name of the Czar," at the
Grand, is one of those familiar dramas of
Rnssian life which no more reflect the hab
its and customs of Russia than they do
those of Assyria or ancient Nineveh, but
it has nil the outward and visible marks
by which you can infallibly identity Russia
as it exists in the roseate imagination of
the American dramatist. As u-ual there
are anarchists who reside in "dens, 1 ' where
they concoct nefarious plots against all that
is good and virtuou*; every stray police
official is an autocrat, which is the more
to be regretted, as he is mentally unlit to
occupy the humblest office of trust The
hero can always foil him and his minions
without the least d.fh'cuhy. In the mat
ter of villainy it is a toss-up between the
Government officials and the anarchists,
who may be said to represent the devil
and the deep sea, the heroic characters
being placed between the two. "In the
Name of the Czar" is an exciting melo
drama, but its action might just as well
pass in ancient Kor as in Russia.
La Loie Fuller is said to have invented
the serpentine dance, but none of the evo
lutions of her art have been so utterly,
completely and entirely serpentine as the
road she is taking to China. After haying
been wished "bon voyage" by her friends
and admirers in the East La Loie reaches
San Francisco, en route for Hontkong.
Here she pauses and dances, serpentines
around the State and comes to San Fran
ciaco. It is now announced that she is to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897,
serpentine to China by way of Mexico,
Texas and Guatemala.
While La Loie is adding fresh curves to
her route for reaching the admiring Li
Hung Chang people who profess to know
all about theatrical affairs never talk of
Miss Fuller's trip to China without using
points of interrogation and admiration.
The admiration points are for La Loie's
marvelous skill in the art of self-advertise
ment and the interrogation points are all
reserved for Li Huug Chang. They run
something like this: "Did the Viceroy
make any contract with Miss Fuller?"
li Didhe?" "Is the interesting document
written in Chinese or English, and who is
ils croud possessor?" "If La Loie is go
ing to China to dance in the marble halls j
of Lt Hung Chang, why does it lake har
agent months of toil to arrange her book
ings?"
These are some of the questions with
which the theatrical atmosphere is laden.
Tlie notes of admiration adorn such sen
tences as: "Awfully clever woman, Loie
Fuller; she realized at a dance that Li
Hung Chang would never contradict her
when she said he had enpaged her to go to
China to dance for him." "That fuller-
Li business is the cleverest advertising
scheme yet." I have heard all the above
remarks, in every tone of interrogation
and admiration, but have not the least
idea whether Li would repel them with
scorn. If he would oniy telegraph to La
Loie, "My marble balls await thee," he
could down alt the talk in half an hour.
Pending a communication from the Vice
roy, I should sugges\ to La Loie to adorn
the foyer of the theater where she dances
wish a glass case containing her contiact,
signed and sealed by Li Hung Chang. It
would be at once an interesting exhibit, a
good ad for Loie and it would turn the
laugh against the people who smile at her
serpentine rouie to China."

Two months later (extract from La
Menieuse dv Soir, Paris): A most inter
esting piece of news is cabled to us from
New York. The Lama of TbiDet was re
cently looking over an odd number of the
London Graphic, brought to Lassa amoiiK
the belongings of a British traveler who
was murdered for trying to cross the
frontier of Thibet. This Graphic con
tained a picture of the celebrated Amer
ican gymnast, La Belle Birdie, In the act
of poising on a crystal electric globe- The
Lama was so charmed tnat he dispatched
couriers across the mountains to the near
est teleeraphic station in India, charced
to offer La Belle Birdie her own terms if
she would go to Thibot to dance for him.
She is understood to have aske 1 and re
ceived such a sum as La Patti in her wild
est dreams of avarice never pictured. She,
will go from New York to Thibet via Lon
don, Paris, St. Petersburg, Siberia, Viad
ivostock, San Francisco and Calcutta, giv
ing performances en route. The leading
geographical societies of America and
Europe are arranging to confer honorary
membership on La Belle Birdie, as she
will be the first white traveler who has
ever seen the Lama of Thibet.
Later telegram: Two or three geographi
cal societies have telegraphed to La Belle
Birdie to ask if she will accept their
medals, and she has replied in the affirm
ative.
Lat?r telegram: Th?re is a rumor that
the Emperor of Russia has telegraphed
to La Belle Birdie to arrange an interview
in !st. Petersburg. It is understood that
he will intrust her with an important
communication to the Lama, relative to
the utter annihilation ot British rule in
India. A deep political significance is at
taciied to La Belle Birdie's journey to
Thibet. Queen Victoria is said to have
expressed grave uneasiness on tun sub
ject.
Le Menteusedu Soir(two months later):
The protegee of ibo Lama of Tnibet, La
Belle Birdie, opened her engagement at
the Varietes laist night, amid scenes of
the wildest enthusiasm. The immense
crowd which had gathered out of curiosity
remained to applaud, and the entnusiasm
reached its climax when La Belle Birdie
introduced the Praying Machine Poise,
which she has invented lor the editicaiion
of the Lama. She stood on an electric
globe, illumined from within with mvstif
colors, and her pre-s agent afterward
sffirinefl that he distinctly overheard Presi
dent Faure, who was present, declare
that the darine athlete deserved the cross
of tbe Legion of Honor.
L:i Mentense dv S ir (ten months later).
La Belie Birdie has returned from San
Francisco via Vlaaivostock to appear
a^ain at the Vane tea in anew Prayins:
Machine poise. In an interview to-day
she expre-sed a fear that the Lama of
Thibet was about to sue her for breach of
contract, as she has not yet been to Thibet,
but sne said in that case she would have
to compromise or pay damages, as she has
now made important engagements for
three years to come. Some of the g,eo

drawfrg their medals in consequence cf
La Balle Birdie's action, but it is under

Some wild rumors are also afloat that
the Lama of Thibet never sent any tele
gram to Li Belle Birdie at all, but these
reports are most authoritatively denied

Columbia Theater.
That old but charming Irish play "Kerry
Gow" will be the bill at the Columbia this
week, beginning to-morrow. As well as
giving the star an opportunity for the por
trayai of characteristic traits of character,
it abounds in realistic effects. There is
the blacksmith's shop, with its real forge
ami bellows, its real anvil and horseshoe.
Tben, too, there is the exciting horserace,
which keeps tbe audience on the edge of
fear, lest the machinations of the villian
should be successful; finally, there are the
real carrier-pigeons, which bring tdeir

will be produced at Moroaco's to-morrow.
"The Land of the Midnight Sun" was
made int) a melodrama by Edwin Bar
bour, whose dramatization of "She" was
recently given at the Grand. It is said to
be full of surprising situations, the most
novel of which, perhaps, is in the fourth
act. There Jason Orry, an Icelaudi-c
piant, meeis his hali-brother, whom he
has been taught from infancy to hate. At
the time or recognition the younger brother
is in deadly peri!. The older brother sup
presses the hatred of a lifetime and saves
the man he has sworn to kill, an oppor

up a column of fire that stops pursuit.
A feature of the performance will be the
reappearance of John J. Pearson, who a
few years ago was one of the most hated
of the villains at the Grand Opera-house.

Bernhardt's Dream.
Sara Bernbardt has been crowned and
feted and fussed over recently, as never
actress was feted before, but her grea^
dream has been to obtain the cross (tl the
Legion of Honor, and without it she can
never be truly happyâ at least so she be
lieves.
President Fanre was mo9t persist
ently urged to give Sara the cross at the
lime of her rec nt arrival in Paris, but he
paused, hesitated and then quietly re
â  used, insinuating that he might bestow
the cross later. Bernhardt's friends de
clare that there is a cabal against her, but
calm onlookers say that the President
does not aare to establish the precedent of
giving the cross of the Legion of Honor to
an actress.

WOOL, TRADE IN 1896.
The Year Was the Poorest â¢ Ever : Ex
perienced.
The circular of Jacob Won ner gives the follow
ing review of the \v; ol traie in 1896:
The woo' season of 1896 will be remembered by
both dealers anJ growers of wool as about the
poorest year ever experienced on the Pacific Coast
or in the United States. It wai e'mirely feature
less in regard to prices. There was not a single
bright spot in It from the opening to the closing of
â¢ the year. Just previous to the election and a few
days after there was a little movement, but It was
only created by speculators, who thought wools
were too low to stay so. Some mills started up,
but the orders for roo is did not warrant their buy
ing raw material at prices asked find so the year
closed with unprecedented dullness.
The clip In California was lair, especially f*ll
wools being better tt.an for many years. As re
' garJs prices they were low. The wonl-growen
generally accepted the situation and sold at hat
was considered very low prices, hut Ihe buyers
could not realize a profit on the purcha e< and the
consequence is that we have over one-quarter of
the wools received in this market on hand, but it
Is mostly in second hands. Two-thirds of the
woo disposed of in this market lias been bandied
by the scoming-mitls. Scoured prlcei were all the
way from 13>A cen.s 10 32 cents, or about 10 per
cent lower than last year. Prices did not vary 2
cents on the scoured pound the whole year.
The total production or wool in California for
3 896 was as foiiows ii pounds:
Spring â¢ 19,000,000
Jail s : 8,0X),000
Pulled.'.". 2,000,000
Total .29,000.000
In 1895 the production of wool In California
amounted to 36,000,000. Received in San Fran

On hand January 1, 1897, in San Fran

and grease pounds 10,500,000,
In the interior 2,000,000'
Sales of wool in the three principal markets of

NEW YORK MARKETS.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan 9.-The stock mar
ket was irregular but in the main weak to-day.
Trading was on a small scale, the total sales foot-
In? up only 40,697 shares. The lO3ses in the
leading shares were confined to narrow limits.
Sugar was strengthened at the opening by Toledo
' rdvices that a settlement of the war witn the Ar
quckles was likely. Insiders here, however,
stated that there was no truth in the report and at
the close the early gain in the stock was lost.
Chica.o Gas, Leather ' preferred and American
Spirits were comparatively firm. Illinois t>:eel
suffered a breac Of nearly 6 points owing to un
satisfactory trade conditions. Near the close
Jersey Central bounded up 2 per cent on attempts,
to cover short ' contracts. ihe rise had no influ

GLASS MERCHANTS
HAD TO RETIRE
F. N. Woods & Co. Ab
sorbed by Powerful
Rivals.
Their Withdrawal Leaves a
Monopoly in the Hands of
One Firm.
Another Wholesale Paint, Oil and
Glass House Succumbs in the
Competition.
Dealers interested in the paint and glass
business are more or less agitated over the
latest change in the local wholesale situa
tion, which practically leaves a monopoly
of that trade in California to one firm.
The last vestige of opposition has been
wiped out by this transaction, and hence
the uneasiness among the retail men who
deal in oils used in painting and illumi
nating, and in paints, glass, etc., all of
which are grouped uuder one branch of
trade.
The monopoly, for such it is said to be
by business men well informed on the
matter, was effected when the house of F.
N. Woods it Co. sold out to the large whole
sale firm of W. P. Fuller & Co. Ttiis
transfer took place quite recently, and its
details are not all concluded at the pres
ent time.
The big stores and warehouses of Woods
& Co., at 51 and 53 First street, are now
ulmcst denuded of their valuable stock,
with which went the prospects of a con
tinued competition in that line of trade in
California. For nearly a month the stock
has been melting away in the ordinary
channels, and Fuller & Co. have been re
ceiving all the profits from it. So that
now the firm of Woods & Co., after a few
years' existence, is completely absorbed
by its powerful rival, and not a competitor
worthy oi the name remains in San Fran
cisco.
Woods & Co. established themselves
themselves three or four years ago, when
the firm of Whittier, Fuller & Co. dis
polved partnership oa the withdrawal of
Mr. Whittier. They opened business on
an extensive scale on First street, and at
once bepran an aggressive career which
promised much for the enterprising pro
prietors.
Prices were cut after a period extending
back for many years, through which old
time figures held undisputed sway. A
light was on. Fuller & Co. met the re
ductions of their competitors, and quickly
the light for business passed the stage of
customary rivalry. It developed into a
warfare that left little or no profit to
either side.
F. N. Woods used to be a member of the
old firm of Wbittier, Fuller A Co. He
had ample wealth and an investment, it
is estimated, of something lik- $100,000 In
the new house, and he determined to re
main in the competition. His partners,
Hiram S. Safford and Wjlliam G. Fuiford,
did not represent much capital, or, rather,
money invested iv the business, but they
were progressive merchants and had con
fidence in themselves. They remained by
the fignt until it eventually became tire
some.
Then they came to the conclusion that
it did not pay, this rivalry in which goods
often sold for less than what they cost,
and they pave way to the larger firm.
Among some of their more recent con
tracts was the glass for the Parrott and
Native Sons' buildings, which it is said
were taken at a loss.
Fuller & Co. forced the fight all through,
and after a bitter struggle for business
supremacy came out of it victorious.
Since Woods & Co. retired, one more,
and the only rival in the plate-glass busi
ness, gave up in despair of further pro
longing the ruinous competition. This
was the old-established house of F. H.
Rosenbaum &Co.,at 567 Market street. The
Rosenbaum concern lost money in meet
ing the prices of Fuller & Co.. and, after
paying 100 cents on the dollar of indebted
ness, sold out the stock and left the field
to the one hou c c.
William G. Fulford, one of Mr. Woods'
partners, immediately upon the dissolu
tion of his firm associated himself with
Fuller tfc Co., and it is generally believed
that he will represent certain patronage
or interests of tt:e defunct concern.
The result of these changes is regarded
by business men as the assurance of a
monopoly and consequently a general ad
vance in prices, since there is no competi
tion in the trade. Fuller & Co. nave
branch houses in the large interior cities
of Caliornia, where the prices during the
competition with Woods & Co. precluded
a fight to any extent by other merchants,
but as the business stands at present re
tail dealers declare it invites Eastern
establishments to come into California
and try their skill at competing.
MISSION PAEK PEOPEETY.
Frank B. Washington Han Appealed
From Judge Coffoy's Decision.
Attorneys MyricK and Deering, repre
senting Frank B. Washington, guardian
of tfertra and Josephine Callaghan, have
given notice that they intend to appeal
from the order ot partial distribution made
by Judge Coffey iii the Ann Callachan
estate.
The property in dispute is what is com
monly known as Mission Park. It is very
valuable and has been in iiiigation for
many years. Tim legal point at issue was
touching the validity of a trust which the
testator attempted to establish in her will.
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler raised the
objection that the proposed trust was void
on account of the fact that it was in con
travention of the law of California as laid
down by several decisions of the Supreme
Court.
After hearing argument on both sides
of the question Judge Coffey said that in
his opinion Mr. Wbeeler's argument was
not only unansworde, hut that it was un
answerable, and gave judgment declaring
the trust null and voia. It is from that
judgment that the appeal has been talcen.
Andrew Folkera Missing.
The police were notified yesterday of the
disappearance of Andrew Folkers, a farm
hand, who left Mountain View on January 2
to draw $300 from a Dank in the Hood Duild
lng. He slopped at the Hughes House, 214
Third street, for a day, but since then he has

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 10, 1897.
FROM GREATER NEW YORK
Budget of Interesting J^eWs and Qossip
About the California Colony in tne
Eastern Metropolis
NEW YORK, N. V.. Jan. 4.-New York
ers waxed hilarious on New Year's day!
The old-fashioned modes of making
calls have been lost in the newer methods
of doing everything. Nowaaays the
would-be hostess sends out cards for a
New Year's dinner or midnight supper,
and none but invited guests are admitted
beyond the sacred portals of her drawing
room. It is a good idea and does away
with the old habit of receiving one and all
on the first day of the year, besides spar
ing an indulgent Hostess the embarrass
ment oi listening to maudlin greetings of
gentlemen who have made too many calls
and have imbibed of divers drinks with
out ccnsidering the quantity or quality.
In these days the men who are not
lucky enough to De invited to a private
celebration quietly steal away in threes
and eights and have the uproarious time
that good fellows always enjoy. Of course
their wives and sisters soothe their manly,
aching brows the next day, and gently
administer bromides and spirits of am
monia to remove the dark terra-cotta taste,
but what's the odds so long as you're
happy !
This year is not next year; to-morrow
has no more to say to yesterday.
Misa Virginia Fair is without question
one of the most popular young; women in
New York society. Certainly the pretty
Californian "Birdie" Fair has quite de
serted her native heath, and also sweetly
ignored the California colony, neverthe
less she is a delightful guest at reception,
cotillon, bicyclo meet, skating party,
luncneon rr box party, besides being a
jolly and enthusiastic player on the golf
links.
She and her handsome sister, Mrs. Her
mann Oelrichs, are charming hostesses
too, and this winter will be brightened by
several dinners and receptions at their
Fifth-avenue residence.
On New Year's day Mr. and Mrs. Oliver
H. P. Belmont gave an up-to-date lunch
eon at their Sevepty-second-street bouse,
and among the invited guests were several
California-.is: Mr. and Mrs. William R.
Travers, Mr. and Mrs. Hermann OelrichÃ
and Miss Virginia Fair.
Vaudeville entertainments at private
functions are the prevailing craze. The
Belmonts had Mile. Anna Held, the
French chanteuse, as a special feature at
their luncheon, and during the feast the
Hungarian band played melting melodies.
Congressman James G. Maguire came
up from Washington, D. C, last' Monday
morning and remained in town until New
Year's eve. He is in excellent health and
spirits, and declares that he revels in the
crisp, snappy weather of Eastern winters.
Stanch Democrat that he is, Congressman
Maguire predicts a prosperous four yean
for the Nation under the administration
of McKinley and his Cauinet.
Mr. Pierce of Oakland, after remaining a
few days in New York, left last weelc for

Gotham part of the winter. They are
guests at the Manhattan, on Forty-second
street.
T. J. Robarson arrived last Wednesday.
His stay will be limited.
Ulric H. Collins, son of Hon. B. Collins

Bacramento, has been doing his native
Stale proud as a young actor of unusual
merit.
Though destined for the bar Uiric Col
lins a ream: of fame as a actor, and after
consiJeraWe buffeting is now on the high
road to fame. Since the opening of Clay
M. Greene's play "Under the Polar Star,"
in which Mr. Collins was cast in a minor
role, he has had the fortune to play every
male part in the piece, and so successfully
has he interpreted them that a prominent
New York manager has already offered
him a flattering engagement for next
season.
Mr. Collins anticipates visiting his
father and mother in Chico for a few
weeks next summer. He has been absent
two years and lontts for a sight of ye old
folks at home.
Charles Freeman Johnson of San Fran
cisco is busy making pluns for remaining
in New York permanently and premotinc
the interests of the Good Roads League.
George B. BurbanK, civil and bydrtulio
engineer, of White Pine, Cal., and Eureka,
Nev.. has recently opened offices in Wall
street. >
H. T. and Mrs. Wright have been in the
city a week or more. Mr. Wright is pay
master in the United States navy.
Judge N. F. Cleary of San FrancNco
stole into town on Friday and stopped at
an uptown hotel. Only a few of his
friends know as yet of his arrival, because
he preferred not to register. li's funny,
but there are always little birds in the air,
and even walls have ears.
M. A. Dormer is at the Windsor.
Mrs. Â£ red Wooster, former'y Miss Annie
Jackson, daughter of Colonel J. P. Jack
son, and who has recently been divorced
from her recreant lord, has just returned
from a visit with relatives in West Vir
ginia. She is a guest at Mrs. If. Tale's
home, on Fifth avenue. She does not
anticipate returning to California for some
time.
i Miss Clarissa Hale, the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. 0. A. Hale of San Jose, has been
dangerously ill at her mother's apart
ments in the Hotel Majestic. Friends
will be glad to learn that she is
convalescing.
The death of William A. Brady's young
and handsome wife was a sad shock to
their many friends in the managerial and
theatrical world. Mrs. Brady had been
ill but a week when the physicians guve
up all hope of her recovery. Mr. Brady
watched constantly at her bedside until
Thursday, when the end came.
She leaves two pretty little onesâ a boy
and girlâ aged four and two. Though a
very busy man, Mr. Brady has always
been a devoted husband and father. His
house at 150 West One Hundred and
Twenty-third street Is one of the finest on
the blocK. Mrs. Brady was of French
parentage and was known on the stage as
Marie Renee.
Colonel and* Mrs. Bavage will hold re
ceptions at the Girard the first, second
and third Mondays in January.
John E. Sen we arrived on Friday. He

has been visiting New England during the
past six weeks, has returned to the Eve
rett House.

Francis, T. J. Lamoureaux, J. D. Orton.
The majority of the new-comers are
business men. proprietors and buyers for
the iurse wholesale and retail houses on
the coast.
The Christmas Call is the talk of the
hour among the business men downtown
and uptown among members of the
colony. Every one is prnisin â¢ its artistic
beauty and magnificent reading matter.
The marine views by W. A. Coulter, the
frontispiece by William KeJly, the char
acteristic and eccentric drawings of R. K.
Culver have received flattering comment.
A prominent San Franciscan said to
day: "I consider The Call to be the
leading paper in the West. It has the
true ring of nobility and progress, with
truth and absolute honesty. That com
bination always wins."

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
FOR . WLIR.Y! SS OF Ml
WHICH < ITRKD HIM AFTER EVERY-
THING ki.m: FAILED.'
Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the mo>t severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost Impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness !
until it was a question whether he had not '
better take a dose of poison and thus end all I
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to li is aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, bin there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at once could
they but get such a remedy ns the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a lew things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time of happiness to most of us. Write to
Thomas Slater, box 2283, Kalamazoo, Mich.,
and the Information will be mailed in a plain
sealed envelope.
