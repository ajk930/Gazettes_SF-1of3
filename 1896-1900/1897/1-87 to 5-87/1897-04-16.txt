SULTAN ASKED TO DECLARE WAR
During the Period of Uncertainty Both the
Greek and Turkish Nations Proceed
to Prepare for the Inevi
table Conflict*
LOW DON, Esq., April 15.â The corre
spondent of the Daily News, who is now
at Volo, Thessaly, telegraphs that he
learns from wounded insurgents in the
hospital tnere the entire force of insur
gents was driven from Krania, Macedonia,
by the Turkish troops. They thereupon
retreated into Greek territory under or
ders from the National Society, which
regarded further bloodshed useless unless
the regular Greek army supported the in
vaders. The dispatch adds tbat the total
insurgent loss *ince March 16 was twenty
six Killed and twenty wounded.
ATHENS, Greece, April 15.âParlia

bill introduced by the Government yes

of the Ministries of War and Marine.
CANEA, Crete, April Ismael Bey,
civil governor, has made a protest against
the behavior of British troops who are on
duty here.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Turkey, April 15. :
The Greek representatives v here made a
formal j apology to the Turkish Foreign I
Office yesterday for acts of Greek insur- |
gent? in crossing the frontier into Mace
donia and disclaimed all reponsibility on
the part of the Greek Government.
Results of tbe two days' sitting* of the
Cabinet council which has just been held
here may be summed up thus: Edhem
Pasha, commander-in-chief of the Turkish
forces in Macedonia, wires the Porte from
headquarters: , .
"Unless I cross the frontier and take a
position there it is plain the present situa
tion is untenable, owing to the constant
attacks of insurgent bands entering the
Turkish lines by stealth. If the present
situation continues it will be very difficult
to restrain my troops, especially . the Al
banians, from marching forward and at
tacking the Greeks."
After deliberating upon this dispatch
the Ministers informed the Sultan that
in their opinion war should be declared
against Greece, or Edhem Pasha at least
be authorized to cross the frontier in the
event of further incursions of Greens into
Turkish territory. The Sultan, who all
along has objected to declaring war, has
not yet replied to the Ministers' com
munication. â¢ .-
BIOXASTE HIES IX THE AIR.
Homes of Some of the Leaders in the Up
rising Against the Turk.
Nature and man have combined to make
the monasteries and their seats on the in
accessible crag summits of Meteora one of
the wonders of the world. Situated where
the Peneus River descends from the ele
vated Pindus ranges into the Thessalian
plain. Meteora disputes the palm with
the Vale of Tempe on the otber side,
where, flowing between Olympus and
Ossa, the ancient river goes out to the sea.
Tempe was said by the ancients to bave
been the work of the mighty Hercules
only a demi-god who cut tbe way through
to drain the many miasmatic lakes that
infested tbe plainâ but Meteora was as
cribed to the gods themselves, being
called by the Greeks "Theoktista," or
works of the gods, and was regarded by
them with even more wonder than Olym
pus â their alleged home.
In the fourteenth century the zealous
monks of the order founded by Simeon
the Sty lite capped these imposing heights
with structures of such substantial con
struction as would attract attention
much nearer to mother earth. Perched in
midair they are at once evidences of mar
velous patience and ingenuity on the part
of these builders. When one stands at the
base, looks up the perpendicular cliff and
finally rests the eye' on the edifice, stand
ing in clear outline on the very top.be
naturally wonders how the material for
these buildings was ever got up there,
or how did the men themselves ever reach
those heights.
The only way in which the mountain
can be visited is by a series of ladders part
of the way, or up to a ledge or platform
some 220 feet from ibe top, and thence in
a net or basket at the end of a long - rope
passing over a pulley and worked by a
capstan at tbe top. This is the manner in
which the monks - raise .their food, etc.
They never use it for descendingâ being
condemned to a lifelong sojourn in aerial
retreat though this restriction has been
at times dispensed with, especially in
timee of insurrection and war, as at pres
ent. Many of these men whose lives bave
been dedicated to religion have come
down and joined their fellow-countrymen
in battle - against the Turk. â¢'â  On" former
occasions * they refused to ' allow the pas
sage of the Turkish army through "their
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
I defiles, and being in a position to support
' their refusal the latter had to choose
I another route.-
Since the war for independence this
j place has been visited by European trav
i elers quite frequently, but 'as at Mount
i Athos females have to content themselves
i with a view from afar, the rules of the
! order, to say nothing of the physical diffi
i culties in the way, forbidding their pres
ence within the precincts of this commu
; nity. Formerly there we're some twenty
j three of these monasteries; but the
' mistaken religious zeal which led the
monks to fix upon these lofty eyries for
their habitations is fast dying out,. and ac
cessions, to their ranks are few in these
days, and, with the exception given, the
buildings have -either been destroyed or
fallen into decay.
. The largest of them all is that of Meteo-
I ron, taking its name from the rock on
, which it stands, though those of Hagios
i Barlaam and Hagios Stephanos, the lat
| ter founded by the famous Kantakuzenos,
i are much richer.
The names of the other four ate Hagios
Nicolaos Kophinos. Hagiu Mome.'Hagiu
Ro.aiie and. Hagiu'Trias."' Though none
of them except Meteora has above a couple
: of dozen inmates, they will all doubtless
j as formerly contribute their quota of will
. ing arms end eloquent tongues in further
ing the ends of the movement which has
fixed its center in their secure retreat.
Though certainly partaking of worldly
affairs to an extent seemingly incom
patible with their vows, warring against
Moslem rule in their Christian country
j has the full sanction of precedent in their
j order.
Of all Greek countries held under the
dominion of the Turk there was none
which so persistently and frequently
sought to regain its independence- as
Thessaly, and none is claimed by the
Hellenes with equal ardor as a portion of
their common fatherland and the cradle
of their race. Foremost among those who
have maintained the one and fought for
the other have been the monks of Me
teora.

Spanning the river Arte, near the city of the same name, is a bridge which seems destined to oe the scene of a memorable conflict. ' Atopposite ends, with cannon
framed and ensigns fluttering .n the breeze, tbe Turks and Greeks confront one another, only awaiting the word of command to advance. It is an instance of armed

CASTLES IN THE SKY.
In the monasteries of Meteora, perched on the summits of lofty rocks rising in curious isolation above tbe valley of Trikkala, dwell a class of religious devotees
who were among the first to fire the hearts of the Greeks and urge them to overthrow their Moslem oppressors. Several of them are now with the army in Thessaly, and
it is certain that their voices are not raised in the cause of peace. ....,â¢

Smyrna.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15 âThe
withdrawal of the cruiser Minneapolis
from the European fleet is to be post
poned for the present and no attempt will
be made to reduce the strength of the sta
tion until after the arrival out of the
Raleigh. This change of programme is
made in view of the representations to
the Secretary of State by Minister Terrill
that the American interests in. Turkey
might be endangered should' hostilities
ensue between Turkey' and Greece. Sec
retary Long proposed ordering the return
of the Minneapolis so it might be retired
from active service with the Columbia and
such other vessels found expensive to
maintain in active service, but in view of
tbe possibilities of the United States be
ing called upon to conduct an active
patrol of the Turkish coast and to hold a
close watch on American interests, the
present fleet will be retained near Smyrna.
The departure of the Bancroft for Alex
andria to be docked is said to-day to have
no special significance. The officials have
never admitted what is a fact, however,
that the little vessel was -sent across, tbe
Atlantic to become a guardship at- the
Porte, but Terrill has several- times since
autumn expressed , the opinion it should
be stationed at Constantinople, and urged
proper representations be made to the
Turkish Government for ; the necessary
permission. < Recently he has brought the
subject up again. On the return of the
Bancroft from Smyrna he will probably

ter how serious the. present troubles be
came. The fleet is kept around the Turk
ish coast at present to be ready to extend

BAGS OF GOLD FOR JAPAN.
Payment of Ch.nese Indemnity Money De
pletes London's Gold Supply and.
Causes Some Apprehension.
LONDON", Eng., April 15.â Financial cir
cles are disturbed by the fact that the Lon
don money market is at the mercy of the
Japanese Government.* Immense sums of
Chinese indemnity money have been paid
to Japan through the Bank of England.
An enormous balance ha- been allowed to
remain at the bank for many months and
this has proved a frequent source :of
difficulty* both to the bank and the general
financial world.
There is nothing to prevent Japan from
depleting the supply of gold at 'any â¢mo
ment. This supply ordinarily, amounts to
Â£35,000,000, which is Â£10,000.000 less than
it was a year ago. Â-..-,..
"The Japanese aulhoritirs this week
withdrew , nearly , Â£2,000,000, ': thereby : re- '
ducing the bank's supply' of gold 6
per cent. The return issued by the bank
to-day show's gold on hand to the amount
of Â£33,000,000. The rate of discount of the
bank, which was reduced to 2% April 8,
was not changed at to-day's weekly' meet
ing, but the directors are seriously consid
ering how to meet or avoid embarrassment ;
which may be occasioned by the sudden
withdrawal of the remainder of the Jap
anese balance. *-\ Â»_ isthi .- *â  : ..-i *â

J NEW YORK, N. V., April 15â Mrs.

She had been living in retirement since
the Beecher trial. Friends have endeav
ored to shield her from publicity to such
an extent that there was no crape on the
door and the blinds were not drawn.
'â â  Mrs. Tilton's death is almost coincident
with that of Mrs. Beecher, who died only
two weeks ago. Of the persons ; directly
affected by the great Beecher trial the
only one now living is Tilton, the com
plainant. I Tilton was a " member of
Beecher's church and editor of the Brook

blacklisted the paper. The trial was one

THEIR INDEPENDENCE MUST BE

Insurgents In a Position to Hold
Their Own and So They De
mand Absolute Freedom.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 15â sensation
has been created by reports tbat peace will
very soon be established in Cuba through
negotiations now in progress between the
Washington administration, Madrid Gov
ernment and Cuban Junta in New York,
the latter supported : by General Garcia
and the Cuban Government in the field.
It is said that the only obstacle in the way
of making a peaceful arrangement has
been the uncompromising attitude of
Canovas and some prominent leaders of
the Conservative party in Spain.
As soon as there is a change in the Gov
ernment at Madrid, and the Liberal party,
led by Sagasta, assumes power, a treaty of
peace will be concluded. All other parties
are in complete accord, and only await a
change in the Spanish administration to
announce a decision. >
La - Lucha says the reports are believed
to be true by Spanish military men. A
correspondent has made inquiries about
the reports and has authority to say if
any agreement for peace has been made it
is on a basis of absolute independence.
For -promotion of negotiations on tbat
ground the Cuban Junta at New York has
absolute power. It is said the representa
tives of the revolutionists in the United
States have sent to Washington a scheme
for peace on this basis, presenting to Sec
retary. Sherman a plan' for the payment by
Cuba to Spain of a war indemnity of about
1100,000,000 on condition that Spain shall
recognize their independence. Th_ United
States in all these negotiations is acting as
a friendly intermediary.
An authorized representative of the rev
olutionary Junta at Havana said to-day:
"We are ready to pay the money to Spain
for freedom in order to avert bloodshed
and the devastation of another year of
war; but still we will never yield if our
independence is not acknowledged."
This news concerning peace negotiations
comes from Spanish sources. It is also
affirmed in a recent offer of friendly inter
vention in Cuba made by the McKinley
administration to the Spanish Govern
ment, involving a proposal for war in
demnity.
* Gomez writes from an estate in Santa
Clara province* that his military position
is very strong and he does not believe that
the whole Spanish army of 400,000 could
make a successful attack upon him.
"My health isveryeood," he adds, "and
I feel as strong as in better days."
An engagement is reported at San Joa
quin, near Campo Florida, Havana prov
ince, in which the Spaniards i under Lieu
tenant-Colonel Penil killed eight pacificos,
and then reported . they had won a vic
tory over the insurgents.

MADRID. Spain. April 15.â As Par.
liament cannot vote supplies for the
colonial wars until June, even if - the
Cortes be convoked before then, the Gov
ernment is using the authority granted
at , the last session, and will obtain ad
vances from the Bank of Spain to meet
the expenses of the war in Cuba. The
bank will furnish 65,000,000 pesetas imme
diately and 35,000,000 later. The loan will
draw 5. per cent interest, being guaranteed
by Cuban bonds of 1891 and by the Span
ish treasury. Other banks will advance
100,000,000 : pesetas now and 50,000,000
later for expenses incurred through the
rebellion in the Philippines.
AMX EST I\ 1' HUM IS IK
Cubans, However, Will Only Quit right

WASHINGTON, D. C. April 15.â News
has been received here that Spain is pre
paring to- issue a wholesale amnesty
proclamation similar to the one that re
sulted'in the surrender of 25,000 insur
gents in the ; Philippine Islands and the
ending of the war there. The Spanish re
gard the issuance of such a proclamation
as one of tbe most important moves re
cently made and predict that' the Cubans
will flock from all direction.* to surrender
and take advantage) of the offer.
.Prominent Cubans, however, .deny that
any such result will follow. They claim
to be gaining ground all the time, and
repeat what tbey have continually said,
that they never would stop fighting
until the independence of the island was
achieved. '__*&&
v One thing; that has undoubtedly had
great weight with--: the Spanish Govern
ment in hurrying the promised reforms
in Cuba is the interest beiug displayed in

The action taken by the Senate regarding
the expected execution of Rivera, though
not formally presented to the Spanish
Government, was brought to its attention
by the Spanish Minister here and pro
duced it* effect, supplementing as it .did
some very strong statements made ver
bally by Secretary Sherman.
As soon as Rivera had been captured
this Government proposed a vigorous re
monstrance against summary execution,
expressing friendliness with Spain, but at
tne same time intimating very strongly
that the insurgents of Cuba should be
treated as soldiers when captured and not
as felons. Instead of formally presenting
this to Spain, as had at first been in
tended, it was decided to verbally com
municate its contents to the Spanish
Minister. â  â¢ '

APPROPRIATIONS
FOR THE INDIANS
Interest ing Amendments
to the Bill Argued
in the Senate.
Vest Praises the Influence of
Catholics in the Schools
for Redskins. _.
But There Is a Paragraph Providing
That No Money Is to Go to
Sectarian Schools.
WASHINGTON,- D. C, Aoril 15.â The I
Senate spent an hour and a half to-day in
executive session on the arbitration
treaty, but did not -ret-ch a vote. After
ward the consideration of the Indian ap
propriation bill was resumed.
A point of oider on the Uncompabgre
amendment was withdrawn and the
amendment reed toâ 33 to 13. It de
clares that mineral lands in the Un
compahgre Indian reservation in Utah
are open to public entry under the min
eral land laws of the United States, and
I no one person to be allowed to make more
than One claim on lands containing gil
sonite, and it opens the whole reservation
except the portion allotted Indians Janu
ary 1, 1898.
One paragraph in the bill enacts that all
children born of marriage between whites
and squaws shall have equal rights in the
property of the tribe.
A motion to strike this out was made by
Gallinger, who argued its effect would be
to despoil the Indians for the benefit of
white adventurers.
After some discussion tbe motion was
rejected and the paragraph remains in the
bill, modified so as to require the consent
of the majority of the tribe and the ap
proval of the Secretary of the Interior.
The subject of Indian schools was
brought up by Vest in a speech in which
he lauded the influence of the Catholic
church on the Indians. He expressed a
bitter contempt for people who imagine
they have a monopoly of religion. He
was a Protestant, without the slightest
sympathy with any of the doctrines of
the Roman church. He was exceedingly
sorry be was not a good Catholic, because
some of the best people be had ever known
were members of thai. church. He had no
doubt that the Roman church had done
more for practical charity than any other
denomination. As to the blanketed In
dians of the future be was entirely hope
less.
The only chance for elevating the In
dian race was in rescuing younger In
dians from the influence of tbe tepee. He
had visited Indian schools in Wyoming
and Montana a few years ago, and obser
vations which ho then made had fixed him
in his opinions, and he now asserted there
was not a single day the Indian school
was worth a dollar to the Indians or to
the cause of civilization. Those schools
were travesties on education. The only
schools that had done the Indians any
good were those conducted by the Jesuits,
and if he had control of the subject be
would give the education of the Indians
to the people who could do it best and
cheapest.
Vest did not seek to have any change
made in the bill un the subject of Indian
schools. : ;.*_.â  --A
A paragraph in regard to them appro
priates $1,200,000 for day and industrial
schools for Indian children, and declares
it the settled policy of the Government to
make no appropriation hereafter for edu
cation in any sectarian school.
Consideration of tbe bill had not
ended when, at 5 p. m., the Senate, in con
sideration . of to-morrow being Good
Friday, adjourned till Monday.
COULD JTOT GET TIME TOR A VOTE.
Acting Chairman Davis of the Senate
and the Arbitration Treaty.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15.â When
the Senate took up the arbitration treaty
in executive session to-day, Acting Chair
man Davis made another attempt to ar
range by unanimous consent the time for
a vote.
He failed, however, owing to the objec
tions raised by Morgan, Mills and Carter.
Morgan would not consent to a vote until
tbe return of Daniels of Virginia, who
had expressed a desire to speak against
the treaty. Carter objected to a vote until
the pairs had been arranged.
The matter of pairs is purely a personal
one, and the rules of the Senate do not
cover it. Each Senator opposed to the
treaty must be paired against two in its
favor. There is a difficulty in finding
Senators willing to act as "halves." As
this state of affairs has existed almost two
weeks it would appear the friends of the
treaty are not over-exerting themselves
in trying to bring tbe matter to a final
vote. -However, Davis gave notice to-day
be would on Monday renew bis endeavors
to have a specified time fixed.
There was practically no debate to-day
upon the treaty itself. Mantle provoked
desultory discussion by proposing that
Davis' speech in ' favor and Morgan's
against the treaty be printed. It was
finally agreed to defer action until the
treaty is disposed of.' t*sp-^WISHB]
Tbe presence of an official reporter who
bad been called in to make a shorthand
record of an agreement for a vote if such
should be reached, was made the occasion
of a point of order by Chandler, who
claimed the reporter was not there by di
rection of the Senate. The point was sus
tained and the stenographer withdrew.

Many Indications That â  the Cleveland

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15.â 1t
was reported about the departments to
day that President McKinley would make
an order modifying the civil service rales
of tbe Cleveland administration so as to
permit a wider field for appointments.
Some indications that Cleveland's rules
are not to be allowed to stand bave been
furnished by the action of several beads
of departments. A list of all soldiers who
left their places or were reduced in grade
under Cleveland's two terms, and whose
successors are now sheltered by the civil
service,* is being prepared at the War De
partment, and a number of changes will
follow when Secretary Alger gets through
examining it.
Secretary Gage bas reinstated a num
ber of clerks in the Treasury Department
who were dismissed or reduced under
Democratic rule. In nearly every case
the person displaced was retained on the
rolls in some other position by Gage, but
to-morrow a number of treasury employes
will be dismissed outright. Representa
tive Grosvenor of Ohio, one of McKiniey's
close friends, said to-day Ie was con
fident that the President would in due
season modify the civil service orders of
his predecessor. Grosvenor is particu
larly anxious to have members of the

the classified service. He said a South

ARRAXGISG THE COMMITTEES.
Democratic and Republican Steerers
Bold a Conference.
WASHINGTON. D. C., April 15. -The
Democratic and Republican steering com
mittees held another conference to-day, at >
which the latter presented a counter
proposition for that proposed yesterday
by the Democrats in filling the commit
tee vacancies by tbe members of the same
political faith as former incumbents. This
was that the Republicans be given control
of the Appropriations and Postoffice com
mittees, which bave to date more or less
partisan questions, by including Silver
Republicans and Populists thereon as
members of the minority.
On the first-named committee the va
cancies are caused by the retirement of
Call, Blackburn and Price, Democrats;
but as Senators Teller and Pettigrew, who
were classed as Republicans when the last
apportionment was made, now vote
with Democrats on leading issnes, Repub
licans insist tbat they should be counted
as members of the opposition. Were this
done one vacancy would be filled by a
, Democrat, while the Republicans could
take care of two of their number. Tbe
Republicans would then control the com
mittee by a vote of 7 to 6. So, too, with
the Postoffice Committee, where all the
Democrats and one Republican have re
tired, and under the Democratic plan But
ler, the Populist, would hold the balance
of power.
Tbe Democratic steering committee took
the matter under consideration and will
report conclusions at another conference
to-morrow.

CALLED PLAIN
"DENNY" MULLAN
More Popular in the
Forecastle Than in
the Wardroom. â¢ â 
A Naval Officer Who Is Thor
oughly Democratic in
His Ways.
How the Commander Saved His
Ship at Samoa and the Thanks
He Got For It.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15.â Tbe
charges against Commander Mullan have
created no end of gossip in naval circles,
and there is likely to be a very lively
battle between the friend, and enemies of
that officer. Just now that he is in
trouble, numerous incidents in his career
are being rehearsed, Some to bis credit
and others directly the reverse.
Commander Mullan, or plain "Denny"
Mullan, as he is familiarly known fore
and aft in the navy, is not nearly so nop
ular in the wardroom as be is in the fore
castle. He is reported to have an uuoffi
cerliKe way of going among his crew and
forgetting bis rank sufficiently to culti
vate their acquaintance*. He is also said
to be indifferent as to the effect of bis
uniform upon a bluejacket, and is demo
cratic enough to believe that the high ef
ficiency of the service does not wholly de
pend on the severe military manners of
the enlisted men in the presence of their
superiors.
"Denny" Mullan first came Into actual
conflict with naval authority at Samoa in
March, 1889, after the awful hurricane had
piled all the shipping in the basin of Apia
upon the reef. When the wind went down
two American and three German war
vessels were ashore and hundreds of sailors
were dead under the blue water. Mullan' s
ship, the Nipsic, alone was afloat. She
bad backed on to the Deacb, where she
bumped ber keel off and the blades of her
propeller had curled up like autumn
leaves. Admiral Kimberly swam ashore
when his flagship, the Trenton, went down
alongside of the sunken Vandalia, and
from his headquarters on the beach
ordered the Nipsic away to Auckland for
relief. A mail steamer would soon touch
at Apia and it was suggested tbat the
survivors quietly await her com in-., but
the admiral, apparently animated by the
same spirit that bad kept him and his
three ships in an unsafe harbor, with be
barometer sinking to a hurricane depth,
started the shattered and disabled Nipsic
out to sea in the most stormy season of
the year. Mullan crawled back to Apia a
lew days afterward, having found it dan
gerous to proceed with the crippled Nipsic.
Then the admiral relieved the man who
had saved his ship from the command of
her. ; :; i" -
When the two officers met in Washing- 1
ton some months afterward the admiral
preferred, charges of insubordination
against the commander. The charges
went into a department pigeonhole. Later
the admiral went on the retired list and
the "Hero of Samoa" went down to the
Pensacola Navy-yard.

810 BELL TOR GOLDEX GATE.
Will Weigh 4500 Pounds and Can Re
H-ard'-len Miles.
WASHINGTON, . D. C., April 15. -A
monster bell is soon to be put in position
at Mile Rocks in the Pacific Ocean, near
the Golden Gate. It will weigh 4500
pounds and will be heard for a distance of
ten miles.
Congressman Loud of California called
on the secretary of the Lighthouse Board,
Commander George F. Wild, to-day in re
gard to the bell. The one now at Mile
Rocks is* a small affair, weighing only
about 950 pounds, and cannot be heard at
a great distance above the roar of the sea.
The Lighthouse Board has been experi
menting with one of, the new monster
bells at Vineyard Haven, Mass. These
bells are designed to take tbe place of fog
horns, as the sound is not only more pen
etrating, but | often there is not room
enough on ocean rocks for foghorns. Be
sides, the bells are worked automatically
by cc.an waves and do not require an at
tendant. The experiments at Vineyard
Haven have been very satisfactory, and
Mr. Loud has received assurances from
the Lighthouse Board that the bell at
Mile Rocks will soon be hoisted into posi
tion.

NEW YORK, N. V.. April 15.â A Christ
mas story by Edith Sessions Tupper, pub
lished in Once A Week, is the subject of
an action Droucht by Colonel Jenyns E.
Battersbv, a West .'Point graduate, to re
cover $25,000 damages from the publisher,
Peter Collier. The name of Colonel Bat
tersby is not mentioned, but he contends
the story referred to him unmistakably,
and to his large painting, "Surrender of
General Lee at Appomattox," which he
intended to exhibit at the World's Fair.
The picture was not exhibited there, and
it is now claimed that the story affected
the chances of its success.
The story pictured the colonel's phy
sique unflatteringly and spoke of the pic
ture most disparagingly. At tbe trial to
day Brigadier-General Serrell testified
that the colonel's was a better picture
than "The Surrender of Cornwailis," now
in the Capitol at Washington. Dr. Julius
Skllton, a former Consul-General to
Mexico, and two artists, testified to the
same effect. The cause was adjourned to
permit the jury to view the painting.

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 15â Cap
tain Barker of the Oregon telegraphed
to Secretary Long to-day, disclaiming all
responsibility for the accident to the
vessel at the Puget Sound station. He
says the piles and boulders had been left
unknown to him beneath tbe surface of
the water in the entrance of the channel
leading to the drydock, and a falling- tide
allowed tbe Oregon to settle on these.
Her great weight was sufficient cause for
disarrangement of plates and other
damage. Captain Barker says if the
entrance of the channel had been free the
Oregon would have had two feet of water
to spare.
Indemnity for Lynched Italians.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 15.â After

Department of State has decided to recom
mend an appropriation as indemnity for

President has concurred. The department
endeavored to evade the responsibility by
the contention that tne men had forfeited
their rights as Italian subjects by. exercis

tbe Italian. Government .insisted and
Sherman was obliged to give in.

DWARF BROOMCORN OF KANSAS.
Largest Single Shipment Ever Made
From Any Point in the World
Goes From Sterling.
WICHITA, Kans., April 15.â An event
of unusual importance to Central Kansas
is the shipment from Sterling, Rice
County, of an entire trainload of dwarf
broomcorn, consisting of twenty heavily
laden lreightcar?, to the Onondaga Whisk
broom Works of Syracuse, N. Y. It is the
largest single shipment of broomcorn ever
made from any point in the world and
was' shipped by Robert Findlay & Co.,
broomcorn commission merchants of
Sterling. Tbe route of the train will be
over the Missouri Pacific to St. Louis and
thence by -. Red Line fast freight to Syra-
cuse. :
The brush was . grown around Sterling
ln 1896, and is part of a crop of 1600 tons
which was raised '. within a radius of
twenty miles of that point. Nowhere in
this country, except in the three Kansas
counties for which the city of Sterling is
the central market, has the dwarf variety
of broomcorn been grown successfully on
a large scale, and it is there that manu
facturers come annually to buy their
year's ; stock. The standard ; broomcorn
grows very tall, frequently reaching a
height of ten or twelve feet, and bears a ,
brush ; twelve to twenty-four inches long.
The dwarf variety only grows as high as a
man's shoulder. It has. a brush much
shorter and of very fine, silky fiber, and is
in greatest demand by factories making
whisk or clothes brushes.
During 1896 there were 350 cars of dwarf
broomcorn shipped from Sterling to vari
ous parts of the world, some of them even
going to foreign ports. There were prob
acy 200 additional cars shipped from that
district, nearly all of which was handled
by the commission men ol Sterling. The
crop of 1896 was not a - large one, having
been scarcely half as _ big as ; that of 1895,
when there was an enormous yield. Be
tween 500 and 600 cars were shipped from
Sterling that year.
The train is gay ly decorated with flags
and banners and unique designs wrought
in broomcorn. and when it was. * side
tracked in ;â¢â  the j Missouri Pacific yards it
attracted unusual interest. There was no
oratory as ; when \ the ; famous : McKinley.
decorated train was sent on its wav to the
National t Republican . Convention >\ at Si.

Numerous Citizens of Undoubted Veracity
Tell of Seeing the Mysterious
Sky Craft.
TACOMA, Wash., April 15.â A strange
light, resembling accurately the one seen
over Minneapolis on -April 10. was seen
over Spokane this evening between 8 and
8:30 o'clock. It was moving west by
northwest, which course would bring it
over Puget Sound in a short time. James
L. Ford, a reputable salesman of this
city, who lives in Whiting's Addition,
about two miles from the center of town,
first saw it at 8 o'clock and describes it as
follows: - ; r J - â 'â ._..
"When I first saw it it must have been
two miles high. It was moving faster
than a star ami seemed to be hovering
over the town. It suddenly dropped sev
eral hundred feet, but it was too dark for
me to make out its outlines,. although the
sky was clear. The light was larger tnan
anyt ing I ever before saw in the heavens.
It occupied a space of four or five inches,
according to my *-ight, in the sky, whicti
means that it must have been of great
size. While I watched it the light turned
irom an intense white to alight green.
It slowly passed over the town and twen
ty-five minutes after it was first seen it
disappeared beybnd the northwestern
horizon, se minely sinking.
"It was maintaining a certain course.
When first seen it was above us at an
angle of about 45 deg. I examined it as
well as I could with a powerful opera
glass, but failed to make out anything but
the li.bt. It was certainly operated by
human beings." -
All four of Mr. Ford's family testified, o
the same lacts. .Miss T. Kiesling, a
trained nurs**, with her mother and family
residing near Ford's bouse, is also willing
to make affidavit to se ing the same
thing. Other people in different parts of
the city also testify to having seen the
light as it was disappearing beyond the
horizon. They feel positive it was an air
ship. . - ,; >. iv
At 9:45 Louis Titus and A. J. Charon
paw the light again from the Spokesman-
Review tower. It was moving west by
south and hovering over the mountains
to the west of this city.

There were about forty persons on the

FROM THE ISLAND
But Eleven Persons Per
ish Before Relief Is
in Sight.
Hundreds of Unfortunates In
the Flooded Sections in
Great Danger.
Additional Breaks In Southern
Levees Reported and the Misery
Increases Hourly.
VICKSBURG, Miss., April 15.â Refugees
from Davis Island late to-night report
eleven lives lost there four on the Hur
ricane place and seven on Colonel Tovell's
Palmyra place.
There are four Government boats on !
duty in this locality. A meeting was
held to-night in the Board of Trade rooms
to provide for tbe relief of refugees now in
the city, the number being increased by
arrivals ou every steamer. Captain Mc-
Martin of tbe United States army, who
was detailed by the Secretary of War to
investigate conditions, stated . he had
telegraphed a report to Secretary Alger,
but would supplement it by wire stating
there are now in the city 1500 or 2000 dest
itute persons, and the number is increasing
daily. The Mayor was instructed to wire
Governor McLaurin and the Secretary of
War for tents for 2000.
At 4 P. M. the river here reached 52:1
feetâ a rise of four-tenths of an inch in
twenty-four hours. Levee street is al
ready partly submerged. The relief-boat
Meigs arrived from Davis Island this
morning with 180 passengers rescued from
the island. They state the flood situation
below here is terrible. The Meigs could
not make a landing except at Davis
Island, where hundreds of half-starved
and frightened negroes were picked up.
Thousands of head of cattle and all homes
on the island have been swept away. The
captain of the Meigs said several hundred
people were huddled in a large ginhouse
on the island awaiting boats. The Meigs
could not rescue them, being too crowded.
NEW ORLEANS. La., April 15. â A
crevasse occurred to-day in Bayou La
fourcte, at the levee, a mile below the
Southern Pacific's Lafourche crossing.
There were already two small crevasses
en the Lafourche, but tbe last one is far
more serious, being higher up. It will
, flood the country between Lafourche and
Terre Bonne from ex-Congressman Price's
Acadia plantation to the gulf.
In the Tensas levee district the water
rose to-day half a foot and is still rising.
Bigg's levee and the levees at Ulawarra
and Milliken's bend are in a critical con
dition. Governor Foster telegraphed Sen
ators Caffery and McEnery to see Secre
tary Alger and obtain permission to use
all of the expended balance for the Mis
sissippi River improvements for levees,
the money to be paid from the river ap
propriation for 1898.
OMAHA, Nebr.. April 15.â The flood
situation is worse to-night in Omaha,
although the river has risen only three
Inches during the day. The cut-off lake
has risen threat feet and a high wind has
driven the water over the dykes on all
sides, frightening out those who remained
in their homes in spite of the water sur
rounding them the past three days. To
night the river shows eighteen feet, dan
ger line for the city.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 15.â This
special bulletin was issued by the Weather
Bureau to-day:
The crest of the flood is still above Vicks
burg, where the river rose .4 of a foot during
the past twenty-four hours.
At Vicksburg the water is now .8 and at New-
Orleans .6 of a foot above the high water of any
previous flooo. If no extensive break occurs
to the -northward the river at New Orleans
will reach the 19-foot stage by April 20, and it
Is imperative that provisions be made to meet
the still higher stage. The danger to threat
ened districts in Louisiana aro daily and
hourly increasing, and warnings previously
Issued by the bureau to remove persons and
property from regions flooded in former years
are repealed and emphasized, as but a few
clays remain in whicn to take advantage of
them. Heavy rains occurred during the past
twenty-four hours in the basins of the Cum
berland, Tennessee and Ohio livers and in the
Lower Mississippi Valley. The Missouri has
passed the danger line at Kansas City. The
Mississippi has risen slightly at Memphis and
from Vicksburg to the mouth. The river has
now been above the danger live forty-six days
at Cairo, thirty-seven at Memphis, thirty-one
at Vicksburg and twenty at New Orleans.
GOES "SLUMMING" IN TACOMA.
Commissioner Teats Finds That the Civil
Service Policemen Are Utterly
Incompetent.
TACOMA, Wash., April 15.â About a
month ago all members of Tacoma's
police force who bad failed to take or pass
the civil service examination prescribed
under the new amendments to the charter
were removed and the civil service ap
pointees took their places, with Romeo G.
Hoge as Chief of Police at their head.
Last evenine Commissioner Teats, one
of the three members of the civil service
board of examiners, for the purpose of as
cerlainine how the new force was en
forcing the laws went 'slumming," taking
in the disreputable houses, . dancehaJls,
saloons, gambling- room* and variety
theaters. He found everything running
"wide open."
In one building he found a saloon,
variety theater, dancehall, gambling-ball
and bawdy-house all combined under one
management. He found girls ' under '15
years leading an immoral life, and .that
messages were sent to and from the house
by messenger-boys, contrary to the State
law, which prohibits their entering., tsuch
places or entering saloons. .
Teats is very indignant and has pre
pared a report which be will lay before his
fellow-members of tne board: to-morrow,
a::d will urge the immediate discharge ol
Hoge for incompetency and moral cow
ardice.
Hoge, in the civil service examination,
p-*sÂ«ed beautifully, taking an average ol
99% percent. Teats and he are both mem
ber, of the People's party, aÂ« are many ol
the new force, but Teats declares that this
makes no difference and that he will have*
every member of the force removed if no -
essary, until he gets officers that will do
their duty and arrest the big offenders *Â«
well as the little oneÂ«.
The police do not know of his intended
action, and it will come upon them like a
thunderbolt oui of a c ear sky.
THE GOLDEN CROSS.
An En rranni Mill and Heavy,- Force of
Men on, the Property.
George H. Coffin of the Golden C.-oss
Mining and Milling Company in San Di
ego County, fourteen miles from Yuma, is'
â¢in the City. ; The camp of Hedges,
->erinÂ£ 500 or 600 people, is the center of
the mining district. It is not far from the
site of the mines managed and part lv
owned by ex-United States Senator Dor
sey. /
"The Golden Cross mines are now work
ing 225 men and running 100 of jibe 140
stamps of its mill,", said Mr. Coffin. '.'The
output averages about $1400 a day. There
are thirty properties owned by the com
pany, and of these three are producing
ore steadily. Most oi the quartz we are
now working in is as black as coal, and it,
hy the way, is the best. At least some of
the richest returns come from it. The
other quariz is speckled. It is all free
milling.
"The quartz is in such shape that practi
cally a good deal of it can be quarried. The
detritus and stons above it is worn off and
it is easy to get at. There is any amount
of it. This company took hold of the
property in 1893. It was then but little
more than a prospect, but it has become
such a mine now that 140 men are being
worked underground.
"The property is six miles from Ogilvie,
the station on the Southern Pacific Rail
road. Tnere have been a. good many in
quiries in that part of the Stale for good
mine-*."
Mr. Coffin will be here only a few days.
LOST HEIRS APPEAR.
Twelve of Them Came Into Court Just
in Time.
Alexander T. P.itton, representing the
Attorney-General of the State, made an ap
plication to the Superior Court on Wednes
day for an ex-parte order directing the
City and County Treasurer to turn over
certain assets in his possession to the State
â¢Treasurer as escheat.
The assets referred to have been lying
for over live years in the City and County ;
treasury, awaiting the appearance of
heirs, the estates having been settled by
the Public Administrator.
The residue of the estates, after dis
charge of deceaseds' debts and the ex
pense of administration, was placed
in the City and County treasury until
the right of the State to the residue as es
cheat developed, which is after five years,
according to sections 1404 and 1405 of the
Civil Code.
The court refused to crant the ex-parte
order on Mr. Patton's application and gave
instructions for a day to be set for the
hearing of the application, Â».nd requested
notice of at least five days.
Mr. Patton acted according to instruc
tions, and later developments proved that
the delay was a fortunate one.
Yesterday a notice was served upon the
court by James Taylor Rogers, who stated
that he would appear for the heirs in
twelve of . the . enumerated estates, and
cautioned the heirs against the aggres
sions cf the Attorney-General of the State
through his agent. Mr. Patton. ..-..â¢;_â '
MINING IN GRUB GULCH
C. M. Ward's Account of Work
on the Joe and; Syn
dicate.
He Says There Is an Unusual Amount
of Gold in the Districtâ The
Activity Growing.
Charles M. Ward, who owns a number
of prospects in Grub Gulch and who has
long been engaged in mining there, is
among the arrivals at the Baldwin. He
is accompanied by Edward Leonard,
owner of the Gambetta and other prop
erty, also in Grub Gulch. Mr. Ward says
there is unusual activity in the mines at
that place. '"/' :'';>:i -\ -
The Syndicate mine, owned partly by
J. B. Peaks, has, as he narrates, 150 tons
of ore out ready, for shipment. The ore
is to be handled at a mill some miles
away, and to this a new road is being
built. Mr. Ward says the owners of the
mine expect to produce and treat steadily
twenty tons of ore a day. Besides this
the Joe mine, which has a ten-stamp mill,
has reached a big vein of quartz ana will,
in his opinion, be a very large producer.
"Tbe vein in this, as well as in the Syn
dicate," said be, "is well defined and is
very large. I think both are destined to
he great properties- Ihere is plenty of
confidence throughout the district. I sup
pose there are about 100 men in Grub
Gulch now, but from all the indications
there will be considerable of a rush there
at an early day.
"It is surprising how much mineral is
being developed. 1 have been in the camp
many years, that is to say 1 bave been
tbeie and gone away and come back,- and
now after being half a lifetime on the
mother lode, 1 believe Grub Gulch is soon
to be one of the most noted places on the
lode.' Years ago it was lhou_ht the great
lead did not reach to Grub Gulch, but ere
long it became apparent that it did, and
in a remarkable way. The veins are con
centrated there, and they are rich when
reached. -. '-_
"I expect a big camp there. All the con
ditions are favorable. It is the same min
eral formation as it is five miles away,
where the Louise was lecently discovered."
Mr. Leonard isdeveloping the Gambetta
and employing a good force of men. lie
is also of the opinion that Grub Gulch is
to be a big camp.
BROWN JAPANESE EIOE.
Decision on Its Tariff Standing: From
the Treasury Department.
A short time ago Special Agent Moore
of the Treasury asked whether brown
Japanese rice was "cleaned rice" and du
tiable at \_i cents a pound. He wrote to
Washington for instructions, and in reply
the following was transmitted to the Col
lector of the Port:
The department Is in receipt of your letter
of the lOtb ult., in which you request instruc
tions as to trie reliquidation of certain entries
of brown Japanese rice imported at your port
under the decision of the Board of General
Appraisers dated Decemoer 31 last (S. 17,758,
G. A. 3744.)
Your letter with its inclosures and the sam
ple of the article were referred to the Board of
General Appraisers and the department is now
in receipt of a letter from the preside:.!, of the
board, dated the Blb inst., in which he states
that this grade ol rice has recently been de
cided upon by the board in a decision dated
theU6th ult., and held to be uncieaned rice,
dutiable under paragraph 193 of the act of
August 28, 1894, at eight-tenths of one cent
per pound.
He also states that competent and full testi
mony was presented in the protest covered by
said decision, that great care was taken to ar
rive at the facts as to whether the rice till re
tained the inner cuticle and that the facts aa
to the character of. tho rice would seem to be
Indisputable.! - .
This decision* confirms the statements of
yourself and the Appraiser at your port that
the inner cuticle of the rice known as brown
Japanese rice has not been removed, and
there- appears therefore to be no necessity for
the reliquidatiug of past entries at your port.

which the co-operative commonwealth movement will be considered.
Debs says there. will be gathered a number of men foremost, in the
movement for : co-operative; enterprises. He might make a formal

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALI., FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1897.
DELAY MAY LOSE
THE JUDGESHIP
Believed That McKenna
Could Name His
Successor.
Waymire Said to Be Looking
for a Soft Place on Which
to Fall.
Morrow Not Yet Indorsed by the
Delegationâ Northern Cali
fornia Marsha. ship.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 14.â The l
United States Circuit Judgeship for the
Ninth Circuit is now absorbing the atten
. tion of Cahfornians in Washington.
Despite all new -paper reports to the
contrary The Call correspondent was in
formed to-night that the -California dele
cation had made no recommendation of
any one to succeed Judge McKenna. It
was reported some time ago that the en
â  tire delegation had indorsed District
Judge Morrow for the vacancy, but this
appears to De erroneous. At any rate
Congressman Loud Bays he bas not recom
mended any one, and tie does not believe,
tbe others of the delegation have as yet.
Mr. Loud believes tbat something ought
to be done at once if California is to get
the place, for other States have candidates
who are active.
Senator Perkins, the chairman of the
I caucus of California Republicans in Con
gress, has not yet called a meeting of the
delegation for that purpose. It appears
that be is rather of the opinion that
Attorney-General McKenna will be al
lowed to name his successor. Judge Mc-
Kenna, on the other hand, believes that
the California delegation in Congress
should take the action and do so at once.
It is certain that Morrow is McKenna's
choice, and the prospects are that he will
be appointed. A word from McKenna
would settle the matter, as President Mc-
Kinley 19 already, favorably disposed
toward Morrow, with whom he served in
Congress. The danger is that the Cali
fornians, in their desire to shift the
responsibility of making any recommenda
tion, will delay so long that the appoint
ment may go to another State. ;7 '
The Call correspondent was informed
to-night by one of the Californians that
Hon. M. M. Estee would not accept the
District Judgeship in the event of Judge
Morrow's promotion. He is a candidate
for one place only, and that is the Circuit
Judgeship. Friends of Mr. Estee have
written to the several members of the
delegation urging his appointment to the
Circuit Judgeship.
Judge James A. Waymire evidently re
alizes that he will not be appointed Cir
cuit Judge, so he is casting about for a soft
i place to fall. It is possible that be might
get the District Judgeship, in the event of
Morrow's promotion, although one of the
California Congressmen said to-day, "I do
not believe -that' Waymire will rbe ap
â¢ pointed to either Judgeship." ,<
As to tbe United States Marshalship for
the Northern , California District Repre
sentative Loud said to-night: "I have
seen newspaper reports to the effect that
I would recommend Harry N. Morse, but
you may say that I do not expect to
name the Marshal." Other of the Cali-
I fornians say that even were Mr. Loud
j given the privilege of naming the Mar
j shal he could not recommend Mr. Morse,
j who does not live in Loud's district. He
j resides in Alameda.
Judge Waymire said to Attorney-
General McKenna that he did not expect
to be appointed to a judgeship, but that
be was here in the interest of se
curing appointments for friends in
California. Waymire and Perkins seem
i to have effected a reconciliation, for the
I former called on Perkins at the Riggs
House yesterday.
RIVALRI AT - WASRIXGTOS.
California Representatives May Re Al
lowed to Appoint Postmasters.
Washington, d. c, April 15.â Mr.
Loud Bays that he has not yet decided
who he will recommend for Postmaster at
San Francisco. "It is too soon to think
about it yet," said he, "as Mr. McCoppin's
term does not expire until a year from
next July. There are too many vicissi
tudes in political life to decide so far
ahead and too many contingencies that
might arise in the meantime. I have not
received any applications for the office
since I returned to Washington, although
I received a number before I left San
Francisco. Among them was ex-Post
master Backus."
There seems to be a sort of political ri
valry between Senator Perkins and Loud.
The latter fully expected to name the
Surveyor for the port of San Francisco.
The Santa Clara County people had 'in
dorsed McGrath for this place, and Mr.
Loud would have probably recommended
bis appointment, but as Senator Perkins
insisted upon John P. Jackson having tbe
Collector-ship of ; the Port, which Spear
wanted, it was agreed by President Mc-
Kinley and Senator Hanna that as a re
ward for Spear's services he should be
given the Surveyorship.
Naturally enough Mr. Loud feels disap
pointed. Besides he does not believe that
Mr. Spear represents the '.'regular" San
Francisco Republicans.
He does not believe , that Spear should
have been seated as a delegate at the St
Louis convention. Nevertheless, be real
izes that Spear will be recognized by Mc-
Kinlev. But Loud does not intend to be
cut iff with a shilling.' He intends to
have his fair share of the "pap" or know
the reason why.
President McKinley seems inclined to
regard the advice of Senator Perkins and
: ignore the Representatives as " small
fry." Upon the occasion of the first visit
of Senator Perkins and Messrs. Loud, Bar
ham ana Hilborn to the. White House
the President, after Mr. Loud had intro
duced his colleagues,' called Senator Per
kins aside, saying. "I want to talk to you
i about that Judgeship." It is understood
that Representatives Barham and Hilborn .
were inclined to resent this as a slight and <
are indignant, though, of course, they con
cealed their displeasure the best they
could. "Â« .. â .I ' . : . \
The chances are that Messrs. Loud,
Barham and Hilborn will not be allowed
to appoint any of the officers except the \
postmasters in their resnective districts, i
as all of the good things are cone. Leach I
will be appointed Superintendent of the
Mint, and Eli Denison might as well go i
home. Jackson will be Collector of the
Port, Spear Surveyor, Jacks Sub-Treasurer i
and Lynch Internal Revenue Collector.
It is altogether likely that when Irish's !
term expires "Billy" Hamilton will be ap- j
pointed naval oflicer, but Mr. Loud will j
insist upon matin- this appointment him- I
self. He does not intend to b_ deprived
of the appointments of surveyor and
naval officer both. If he sees that both are j
likely to get away he will say to the Presi
dent: "Make Mr. Spear Collector of the
Port instead of Jackson." There is a bare J
chance that this might be done and Loud
might then name the surveyor, but if \
Spear is appointed surveyor he will insist
upon recommending one of his friends for I
naval officer.
HA.SiXA OPPOSES DE YOUXG.
Michel Henry Will Sot Represent Hi*
Country â¢ Abroad.
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 15.âMi
chel H. de Young is doomed to disap
pointment. He will not . represent his
country abroad. That is, he will not if
Marcus Aurelius Hanna has. any influ
ence with the President, and it is gener
ally believed that he has.
The Call correspondent to-night re
ceived reliable information that Senator
Hanna is opposed to Mr.de Young being
appointed to a foreign mission. He is not
especially unfriendly to De Young and
would be quite willing for- him to be ap
pointed United States Marshal or some
oflice of a character that would suit Mr.
de Young's executive ability, but the idea
of his representing the United State*
abroad seems utterly preposterous to
Hanna.
Representative Loud of California is
also determined that De Young shall not
be appointed to a- foreign mission. As
stated in The Call yesterday, he has pro
tested to the Secretary of State and to the
President, and in passing it may be said
that Representative Loud is not only ap
preciated in Congress as one of the ster
ling characters in that body, but Presi
dent .McKinley is said to entertain a great
respect for his reliable judgment of men.
The President knew Mr. Loud before he
was elected President De Young is aware
of Loml's determined opposition to him.
for he told Chairman Frank McLauuhlin
in New York the other day that he knew
Loud was the only one of the California
delegation who did not indorse his candi
dacy.
Mr. Loud says it was a great mistake
for California to try to get five foreign
missions, besides several consular posi
tions. He believes they should agree on
some one man, and if they get that they
will be in luck.
GRAND ARMY VETERANS
They Will Ho d Their Encamp
ment at Salinas, Monterey
County, Next Week.
General Chipman, Originator of Deco
ration Day, a Candidate for
Commander.
The next encampment of the California
Department of the Grand Army of the
Republic will be held thi-* year in Salinas,
Monterey County, commencing next
Wednesday. The people of that inland
town have, for some time past, been pre
paring for the event, and they will show
by their hospitality that they have 'a
friendly, patriotic feeling tor the old sol
diers who volunteered years ago to main
tain the Union and the glory of tbe stars
and stripes.
The people of Salinas have subscribed
$1000 toward the entertaining of the vete
rans auring their stay with them. J. G.
Joy, past commander of James B. Steed
man Post, located at tnat point, and chair
man of t&e committee of \ arrangements,
who was in. this City yesterday, stated
that the arrangement, lor tne reception of
the deiej:atÂ«-s to the encampment are all
completed, and that when they , arrive
there they will meet a welcome as hearty
as they ever received anywhere. He stated
that while it is not Known how many will
attend as delegates, preparations have
been made to accommodate 600 in the
hotels and private residences.
In addition to the Grand Army En
campment tbere will be the meeting of the
ladies of the Relief Corps of the Grand
Army, and the Ladies of the Grand Army
will also be present during the encamp
ment. The Relief Corps and the Ladies of
the Grand Army, while they both work in
the same line, are two distinct bodies.
The former is composed of the wives and
the female relatives of those who took up
arms for the Union, while the other is
composed of women loyal to the Govern
ment. Tne aim of each is to look after
the unfortunate members of the Grand
Army and their families who are in need.
The posts throughout the jurisdiction
of California number 116 and the Relief
Corps number 60. The Crand Army will
be called to order by Department Com
mander T. C. * Masteller and the Relief
Corps' meeting by Mrs. Laura J. Robin
son, department president.
--â  There will be several candidates for the
position of department commander.
Most prominent among the â  number is
General N. P. Chipman â â  of Red Bluff,
who is urged for the position on the
ground that it was he, while adjutant to
General John A. Logan when he was com
mander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the
Republic, who wrote the order setting
apart May 30 as the day for the decoration
of the graves of the heroes of the war. â¢'-
Another candidate is Frank Miller of
Sacramento, past' commander of Sumner
Post, and another is Frank Cushing,
junior vice department commander.
The only candidate prominently men
tioned for senior vice department com
mander is J. E. , Eaton of Stockton, past
commander of Rawlins Post and at pres
ent adjutant of the post.
There is an unwritten law among the
veterans of. the Grand Army that the po
sition of senior vice or junior vice depart
ment commander snail* go to a member
resident of the place in which the en
campment is held, consequently one of
these positions will be filled by a member
of James B. Steedman Post, but who will
be selected. or which of the two offices he
Will be elected to has not yet been deter
mined.
During the encampment the visiting
lady delegates will be the guests of the
James ' li. Steedman Woman's ' ; Relief
Corps No. 86. A number of outings have
been planned, and it is likely that the
.veterans will be asked to join them on
pleasure excursions. '

GOLD BONANZAS
ON THE YUKON
Fabulous Stories Told
by Oregonians Just .'â¢
Returned.
They Bring Rich Dust From
the Famous Clondyke
District.
The Great Mining: Excitements of
California and Australia May
Be Repeated.
PORTLAND. Ob., April 15.â would
appear that in the gold placers recently
discovered along Bonanza and El Dorado
creeks in the Clondyke district of the
Yukon, the world is to witness a repetition
of the great mining excitements of Cali
fornia and Australia, says this evening's
Telegram. James McKay, J. S. MacAulay
and Richard Butler, men of known re
sponsibility, have arrived from the new j
gold fields and confirm in every manner '
the rumors concerning the wonderful rich
ness of the Clondyke that have heretofore
reached the outside world. An example
of the fabulous wealth of the country is !
shown in the product of one pan of dirt
washed out on an Â£1 Dorado claim, the
dust being brought out by Mr. MacAulay,
which at $18 an ounce weighs $243. Com
ing as this dees direct from tbe scene, and
brought by a well -known gentleman, there
is no doubt as to the truthfulness of the
statements made.
Concerning the big returns from a
single pan of dirt, it should be remem
bered that the dirt is invariably taken
from bedrock, and in these immensely
rich spots the pay streak is always thin â
sometimes not more than two or three
inches.
On the other hand, an example is found
in the Rhodes claim, where the gravel
runs from $2 47 to the pan on the upper
strata to $4 90 at bedrock, with a pay
streak nine feet deep. On such claims as
this no barren dirt need be handled, and
the net profits equal those where the
richer though very much smaller pay
streaks are found.
TWO TOUJ*G 3 Hit, FES CAUGHT.
Robbed the Mails at Pendleton and a
Store at La Grande.
POKTLAND, Ob,, April 15.â Deputy
United States Marshal Bentley arrived
from Pendleton to-day, having in charge
J. E. Smith and Columbus Weir,. two en
terprising youths of 17 and 19. They
went to the postoffice in Pendleton, where
Smith asked after letters for about every
member of the Smith family in Pendle
ton. He secured quite a number of letters
and postal cards, as may be imagined.
Weir, who is said to be a horse jockey
known as "Bogus," next asked forlettes
for all the Weirs in that section and re
ceived several. Among them were two
cards notifing one Weir to call at the ex
press office for two packages. Weir im
mediately called for them, but was in
formed that he was too late as they had
been delivered to the rightful owner.
The lads then proceeded to open their
mail, and in a letter intended for J. E.
Smith, a sheepman, they found a check
for $30. They at once started up the rail
road track and made their way to Baker
City, where they tried to cash the check,
but Smith could find no one to iden
tify him, and so they came back to La
Grande, hoping to have better luck there.
In some way they became separated,
aud Weir, who appears to be doomed to
misfortune, got mixed up in the. robbery
of a store the first night he was in town.
Some $700 worth of jewelry, shoes,
clothing, neckties, etc., were sacked up
and carried off. The goods were first
bidden under the station platform, then
moved, and finally the seal on a car for
New York was broken and tbe booty
stowed in the car and the doors closed as
well as possible.

To-Morrow at the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art.
BTANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
15.â Stanford and Berkeley will play their
first intercollegiate I game of chess next ,
Saturday, at 10 o'clock, in . Mark Hopnins

mission to the chess tourney is by invita
tion. C. Serpas, F. W. Kohler and Merle
Johnson are . Stanford's ! representatives.
Epstein, De Laguna and Parkhurst com
pose Berkeley's team.
Carlos Serpas of San Salvador will cap
tain the chess team. He is a sophomore
and a student in civil engineering. The
training which' an engineering course
; gives has been undoubtedly of great bene
fit to him. Serpas took up the game in
earnest last summer, although he knew
the moves several years ago. He plays a
strong game and has no trouble in carry
ing on two fames at the same time. He
plays a good game blindfolded. He has
improved greatly during the last few
months in openings and the general tech
nique : of "' the game. -. Last . year ha was
president of the Stanford Press Club.
Frederick W. Kohler of ' St. Helena, a
student in education, is a member of the
freshman class. He stands second in rank
on the team.: As a player he is- careful,
and several years' knowledge, of chess
makes him a strong opponent. Kohler
was a member of the St. Helena Chess
Club before entering Stanford.
.'Merle Johnson of Oregon City Is a senior,
and takes history for a major study. He
is perhaps better known as one of the
editors of the art department of the Josh,
and a member of Stanford's track team.
Johnson plays a brilliant game, and has
been putting up an especially vigorous
game of late.

SANTA BARRARA SURPRISE.
Unexpected Resignation of. Superior Judge
Cope â Charles F. Carrier Favored
for the Vacancy.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 15.â
The resignation of Superior Judge Walter
B. Cope, which was sent to Governor Budd
last Monday, was entirely unexpected, ex
cept to a few of the Judge's personal
friends, and during the first twenty-four
hours there was some lively work done
among the members of the bar to fix upon
bis successor. A number of lawyers
whose Democracy, was vouched for got up
petitions and obtained signatures asking
for the appointment, and for a time it
looked as though the contest would dis
rupt the party here. Finally, however,
the candidates stepped out one by one,
until now there are only two names men
tioned in connection with the . office-
Charles F. Carrier "and W. S. Day, with
the chances favoring thÂ« former.
This morning District Attorney Ogels
bv, William Gallagher, Colonel John
Hunter. Alston Hayne, ex-Assemblyman
Caleb Sherman. Philip Stewart and one or
two others wired the Governor that Car
rier's appointment would best harmonize
the factions in the party, and would be
eminently satisfactory to the public gen
erally. A- these gentlemen may be said to
be the leaders of their party here this
recommendation should have considerable
weight with the executive. '.
Mr. Carrier is a young man, and one of
the brightest and ablest members of the
Santa Barbara bar. . He is. exceedingly
popular, and his friends are confident
that he would make an ideal Judge. .

improving the streets and squares of the
city. It is composed of the leading so
ciety people of the city and is a most pro

The entertainment will be the great so
ciety event of the season, and it is the
first of its kind ever given in this State.

the arrangements, as they are under the
personal arrangement of Miss Dacia Fair
banks, assisted by ladies of the club. The

Miss Zne Fairbanks, Mrs. Hill and Mrs.
F. H. Den m ani
The keenest interest is being taken in
the venture, and there is no doubt of its
success. Rehearsals are held in strictest
secrecy, and the evening's programme
will be a surprise in more ways than one.
The proceeds will all go to carry out the
objects of the organization, and Petaluma
streets and parks will soon chow material f
evidence of the success of the ladies' idea.
BOGUS SAN JOSE POLICEMAN.
Young Mexican Attempts to Levy Tribute

Himself in Jail. *
BAN JOSE, Cal., April 15.â Adolph
Paraito, a Mexican, about 20 years old,
was t.rrested to-day on a charge of imper
sonating a police officer. Last night he
stooped Earl Hardy and Arthur Main,
boys 14 years of age, as tbey were return
ing home from the theater, and told them
they were under arrest for violating the
8 o'clock ordinance. Paraito walked the
boys down to the City Hall, but said he
would let them go if they gave him $1
each. He said, be would have to divide
the money with the Police Judge in tbe
morning. The boys agreed to get the
money at their, homes and the would-be
officer accompanied them.
Young Hardy asked his father for $1 to
save himself from jail, and the latter got
out of bed to investigate things. When

authority as an officer the young Mexican
took to his heels and escaped. The police
were furnished with a description and he
.was arrested this morning. Paraito was

San Francisco society people will greatly
miss the McCallas, for the social gather
ings at their delightful home have served
well to maintain- Mare Island's reputa
tion for hospitality. It was at the Mc-
Calla home that ex-Secretary of the Navy
Herbert was entertained in such royal
style a few years ago. * -'. .- .;-'. -/
Commander McCalla -is now number
fifteen on the list of commanders. He
graduated at the Naval Academy at An
napolis November 30, ( 1861. having been
appointed from New Jersey. The follow
ing aro the dates of his promotion!*: July
16, 1862, midshipman; November 1, 1866,

12.1868, lieutenant; March 26. iB6O, lieu
tenant-commander; 'November 3, 1884,
commander. ; *.*
On October 3. 1893, he was assigned to
the post of equipment officii at the
Mare Island Navy-yard, and his services
in that capacity are highly spoken of by
naval officials. During his administra
tion an electrical department' has been
established under his supervision, and
the plant now consists of r-ome of the
finest electrical machinery on the coast,
capable of performing work never at
tempted before on this coast.
A more fitting assignment- to the naval
war college could not have been made by
Secretary Long than in the orders issued
to Commander McCalla, as he is -the
recognized author of a system of naval
tactics.

Commutation ' Case. Â 1
SEATTLE, Wash., April 15.â Recently
Governor Rogers refused to. commute the
death sentences of Murderers Carey and
Straub to life imprisonment, though
recommended so to do by the Board of
Pardons, stating that he would only com
ply upon the additional written request
of the presiding Judge and; the attorney
conducting the prosecution. This an-
nouncement called forth a vigorous pro
test from various Judges and prosecuting
attorney*. Ex-Judge Thomas J. Humes,
who presided at the trial of Carey,' in at
open letter, bitterly criticizes the Gov
ernor, saying:
"If you desire to place upon me the re
sponsibility whether this man William
Carey, or any other man, shall live or die,
I unhesitatingly say let the man live. I
want the blood of no man on my hands."
Governor Rogers to-day replied in part:
"Upon receipt of a request from "you.

HOT POLITICS AT STOCKTOX.
I internists Win in City Convention* and
Await the A. P. A, Ticket.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 15.â For years
past no such interest has been shown in a
municipal .election as that which is to
come off hereon May 18 next.
At the last city election the A. P. A.'s,
under the name of the Non- Partisans, car
ried everything before them, but since
then their strength has been waning, as
was evidenced at the'last election for State
Senator and Assemblymen. However,
both the Democrats and Republicans re
garded them as dangerous in city politics,
and both the city committees of the old
parties, decided to fuse and put up a ticket
that could not be beaten. The Democrats,
though strongest in their position by rea
son of . the fact that the majority of the
A. P. A.'.** were Republicans, made tbe
overture and the Republican committee
accepted the proposal.
It provided for an equal distribution of
the municipal offices and the Republican
committee readily assented to a division,
provided good men were put up on both
sides, for the purpose of defeating the
A. P. A.'s. .
To-night the Republican and Demo
cratic city conventions took place, and in
the former there was war from the time
the temporary chairman. called: the meet
ing to order. The opposition to fusion
was led by Arthur L. Levinsky and R. E.
Wilholt. Levinsky urged the Republi
cans to stand their ground and nominate
a straight ticket, In a rattling speech
that received cheers from the gallery and
from the delegates he fought the fusion
ists. The latter were too strong for him
and nominated Arthur Ashley as chair
man â the chairman of . the Democratic-
Republican fusion committee.
Tnen there was a hot fight. Police
Judge Rendon moved to, adjourn until
Saturday, to wait until the Non-Partisans
and Democrats bad nominated their
tickets. This was bitterly fought, but
eventually .carried, and the throng filed
over. to the hall where the Democrats were
meeting. Then there was a love feast.
The programme of the fusionists was
carried out to the letter, and the Demo
crats, too, adjourned until Saturday morn
ing, in pursuance of the programme. AH
this was done to see what the A. P. A.
will do to-morrow night at its convention,
and then both Democrats and Republi
cans will be in a better position to pick
out fusion candidate-*. There will proba
bly be the liveliest fight . ever known in
municipal politics. .

NEWS OF LOS ANGELES.
Alva Johnson Gives Sensational Testi-
mony in the Trial of Kid Thompson
for Train-Wrecking.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 15.â sen
sation in the Kid Thompson train-wreck
ing trial came late last night, just before
court adjourned, when Alva Johnson on
the stand declared that he could not tes
tify. He might, he said, if he were a free
man, but under the circumstances he
could not, and be did not. He insinuated
that the prisoners at San Quentin were his
but bears.
To-day Johnson swung around all right
for the prosecution and gave testimony
against Thompson. How Johnson came
to change his mind cannot be stated, but
it is evident that be hopes by testifying
against the defendant to secure immunity
from bis life sentence . in the penitentiary
and possibly a pardon. *
Johnson, on direct examination, related
the details of the. robbery, in which be
asserted that he was assisted by Kid
Thompson. He said that he stood at the
open end of the siding and signaled to the
engineer with burning weeds, while
Thompson was at the south end, by the
switching apparatus. He saw Thompson
working with the lever, throw it open
and leave the train to run on to the siding,
and the forward part of the train over
turned. The two bandits then fired sev
eral shots, and told the conductor to get
inside or he would get his head blown off.
They went to the door of the express-car
and ordered the messenger to open it. He
refused to do, and then, Johnson says, he
put the dynamite on the door sill. They
took one of the men there, and going to
the rear door of the car made the messen
ger open it, and headed by the man se
cured the money.

Mohler, a son by a former marriage to R.

possession of his father, the divorced hus
band of Mrs. Austin. This morning the
matter came before Judge Vandyke, who
ruled that the case had no standing in his
court. Mrs. Austin carried her prize glee

Prison.
SAN QUENTIN, Cal., April 15.âTheo
dore Durrant, whose execution will take
place- on the 11th of June, is leading the
same life as the other condemned convicts
at San Quentin. He has lor comrades
men who are guilty of revolting murders,
one of whom is a maniac on religion. His
days on earth are rapidly slipping away,
yet he is still the same cool, collected
criminal and exhibits the same uncon
cerned air as marked his life in the County
Jail in San Francisco. Â ,'. r/.
--.. Only when his mother visits him at the
prison does he break his reserve and show
the feelings that are stored in his breast.
The mother who has remained by him
from the time of bis arrest to now, when
the days are so swiftly fleeting and he
must pay the penalty for the atrocious
crime of which a jury of his fellow-men
lound him guilty, he clasps ln his arms
and showers with kisses. , Then, and only
then, does be exhibit signs of .tenderness.
His life at San Quentin has become
monotonous. The same routine is gone
through every day. He is allowed to
read, but the San Francisco papers are
denied him and he must be content with
the pictorial weeklies published .in. the
East. His appetite is not affected, in the
least. He arises, about 6 o'clock, is
allowed, to exercise a short time in the
afternoon, and at 5 o'clock he is locked up
for the night. Thus his days are spent.
He is not allowed: any visitors hue bis

HILL'S TRIP TO EUROPE.
Will Endeavor to Devise a Scheme to
Capture a Portion of the Vast
Oriental â  Trade.
SEATTLE, Wash, April 15.â Replying
to a query as to whether he believed James
J. Hill's mission to Europe to be with a
view to bringing about a "consolidation "of
the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
roads. Judge Thomas Burke, chief counsel
for the Great Northern's Western division,
said: '*^JHfIW-I-HB^^
"I believe all these consolidation stories
to be merely repertorial inventions. Mr.
Hill, I am of the opinion, went to Europe
for recreation, and while there, to see also
if he cannot devise some scheme whereby
he can divert that great volume of Oriental
trade which has;. bo long been going to
Liverpool and London via the Suez canal
to the United States by way of a trans
pacific route. :â ''
"This has long been one of his chief am
bitions, and he will, I think, accomplish
it if the barbarous features of the Dingley
tariff bill are eliminated. ''
â¦'With the. right kind of a tariff the
Pacific Coast can p : soon command prac
tically all of the Japanese^ and Chinese
business now going to Europe through
the Suez canal, but we must not have any
barriers in the way of excessive tariffs on
Oriental products. Practically, all the
Eastern United State* business and travel
to the Orient can be thrown to the north
ern transcontinental lines with ? improved
transportation' facilities. Several years
ago.Mr, Hill- told me that at no distant
day he would be able to take a New York

ARGO'S GHOST MADE
STRONG MEN WEAK
Reckless Murderer Who
Begged Piteously for
Freedom.
Tramps in the Haunted Cell
Would Promise Anything
for Relief.
James W. Cochrane, -District
Attorney, Explains the Effect
on Convict Baker.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., April 15.â
ghost of William Argo, which prisoners
claim haunt the corridors of the Mann
County Jail, did not have an opportunity
of exhibiting himself last night to cause
the hair of some unfortunates to stand on
end. Sheriff Harrison has some regard
for the feelings of the prisoners under his
care, and he did not compel any to pass
the night in the haunted chamber.
An old woman brought to the jail on
the charge of insanity was confined in the
cell during the day, but at night she was
removed and the ghost was free to gam
bol at will.
A notable case where a prisoner saw
the apparition occurred during Frank
Haley's term as Sheriff. "Scotchy"
Baker, a cold-blooded murderer who had
assassinated a fellow-convict in the San
Quentln prison in a hearties* manner,
saw the ghostly visitor, and when conÂ«
fined in the haunted cell would com*
mence yelling and screaming at 4 o'clock
in the afternoon, begging to be taken out
of the cell and put into another.
At this time the visits of the ghost were
something new, and the officials took lit
tle stock in what the prisoners said.
James W. Cochrane, who was District
Attorney at the time, said to-day that
Baker was one of the worst opium fiends
in San Quentin. '.'He would set up a yell
at 2 o'clock in the morning," said he, "and
beg to be placed in another cell, where the
.apparition could not haunt him. Baker's
was not the first case. A number of tramps
who were locked up begged most piteously
to be released, offering never to come
to Marin County or do anything for which
they would again be locked in tbe cell.
Baker is now in Folsom, where he is serv
ing a life sentence."
The cell to-day is deserted. All the
prisoners are confined on the other side of
the corridor, away from the ghostly vis
itor that has furnished Marin County with
a mystery which yet remains to bo solved.

The. Engineer's Thrilling Re
cital of the Desperado's
Nervy Work.
Amusing- Testimony of a Witty
Irishman Who Knew the
Prisoner.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 15.â James
True, who is claimed by tho railroad de
tectives and secret service agents to be one
of the most daring bandits of the present
day, bad bis preliminary examination in
Judge JL>avis' court to-day on a charge of
robbing the United States mails, was held
to answer and will be returned to Ogden
to stand trial.
Among the witnesses .present were the
engineer, fireman and postal and express
messengers of the ill-fated train, whose
stories all agree in nearly every particu
lar. The testimony as rendered by the
engineer was dramatic. One could al
most see the train lunging through the
darkness of early morning into the deep
canyons and rattling along the steep
grades to the place of hold-up. One could
almost hear the ringing voice of the lone
robber, pistol in hand, as he climbed over
the tender and shouted, "Hands up!"
Than the story was recited of how the
robber drew some white sacks from his
pocket and ordered the engineer and his
mate to put them over their heads so that
they might be thought to be confederates
of the daring lone highwayman.
Then followed a vivid description of the
entry into the express-car, when the
nervy man, after producing a hammer
and chisel, in the presence of the assem
bled train crew calmly set to work to cut
an incision into the safe to hold dynamite
enough to shatter the locks, and how. fail
ing in this, he entered the mallear and
ordered the registered mailsacks thrown
out and rifled them.
But a more important witness was a
man named Culler*, a typical Irishman,
red-headed and brimming with mother
wit, deeply tinged with brogue, and too
shrewd to be cornered In the most rigid
examination. He told of various meetings
with True in San Francisco, having previ
ously known him in Utah. He told how
True had admitted to him, boasted in
fact, of having held up this particular
train single-handed and then tried to per
suade witness to accompany him to Col
li-, in this State, and hold up a train at
that point. "But I told him," he said,
"I was not ready to die yet, and that I
would rather work than get shot."
Then the prosecution rested, and the
defendant was heid to answer with bonds
fixed at $4000, and as be failed to produce
them he was turned over to the United
States Marshal and taken to San Fran
cisco pending his extradition.

TURK STREET NARROWED
Thirty-One Feet of It Added to
Calvary Cemetery for
Buildings.
Original M.pol Outside Lands Show
That the Street Ended, at
the Graveyard.-
Before proceeding with the considera
tion of the water schedule last night the
Supervisors took up the petition, of the
owners of 2504 feet 6 inches frontage on
Turk street, between Masonic and St. Jo
seph avenues, to have the width of that
part of Turk street reduced from 100 feet
to 68 feet 9 inches.
It was claimed that the whole of Turk
street between the avenues mentioned be
longed to the cemetery and had been
taken off the cemetery and made into a
street illegally.
Deputy Surveyor Moore produced the
official outside land map of the City and
County of San Francisco adopted by the
Supervisors ,in 1868. On the man, which
is the original, Turk street ran 50 or 75
feet west of Baker street to Calvary Ceme
tery. The map that was made in 1870,
Mr. Moore said, was not a true copy of
the original map of 1868, many un
authorized changes having been made.
Attorney Matt Sullivan appeared for the
petitioners, and argued that Archbishop
Riordan, as successor in interest of the
late Archbishop Alemany, was entitled to
the possession of that strip of land now
known as Turk street, between the point
named, but his clients did .not ask that
the street should be closed, as they had a
l"gal right to do. ' Tney asked that the
width of tbat part of the street should be
restricted to 68 feet 9 inches. .

iiTi^'li'iM'TtyrirtTri â  rwi linriinri liWTfrrifnrriTiM mini â¢ â¢*â  nâ  â¢
said that the petitioners asked for a strip
of land equal to sixty - six lots of 25
feet frontage each and valued at $75,000.
It was not within the power of the City or
of the Legislature to give away this prop
erty.
. Garret McEnerney followed on behalf
of the Archbishop. He said that all his
clients asked was that" property which
they owned and which the City had at
tempted to map away from them should
be restored to them.
Lackman moved :o refer the matter to
the City and County Attorney.
Rottanzi asked whether the City and
County Attorney had not already given
an opinion that Archbishop Alem.iny had
never delivered to the City a quitclaim
deed.
* Mayor Phelan replied that the opinion
was _ personal one, addressed to himself.
Britt moved that the committee rise
and report in favor of granting the peti
tion. .
Rottanzi moved to amend that the peti
tion do granted, provided (hat Archbishop
Riordan quitclaim to the City the 68 feet
9 inches of Turk street between the
avenues named.
Tne communication of City and County
Attorney Cresweil to the Mayor was read.
The opinion was that the Archbishop did
not and could not deed to the City that
which he did not own; that if there was a
street there it belonged to the City, and
that after a careful investigation he (Ores
well) found no record of any such quit
claim* having been made by the Arch
bishoD.
The* motion to close Turk street at Cal
vary Cemetery, providing thut Archbishop
Riordan should quitclaim 68 feet 9 inches
of that thoroughfare to the City, was ear
ned by the following vote:
Ayesâ Devany, Ha skins, Deiany, Shee

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1897.
WILL TALK

Before the Supervisors'
Committee.
IS SIX PER CENT A FAIR
RETURN!
Daniel Meyer Tells What He
Knws About Interest and
Securities.
BANKS PAY THAT BATE TO
STOCKHOLDERS.
Why Water Securities Are No' Pre
ferred to Government Bonds at
Less Than Half the Per Crnt.
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
appeared as a witness before the commit
tee of the whole of the Board of Super
visors last night and testified tbat in the
matter of water supply for tire-extinguish
ing purposes Eastern cities were far better
off than San Francisco. The cisterns in
San Francisco would not hold water, he
said, and were practically useless. In the
East there were many more hydrants to
each fire engine than there were here.
Engines were enabled to concentrate
their forces at a fire, having the advan
tage of large, well-built cisterns.
In this City, tho Chief continued, it was
sometimes necessary to run out 1000 feet
of** hose. This mci eased the friction so
much that it was necessary to use a much
greater pre asure at the engine. This in
creased the wear and tear on the appa
ratus and bad a tendency to burst the
hose. In Boston the hydrants ranged
from seventy-five to 300 feet apart. San
Francisco, with its area of forty-two
square miles, should have at least 5000
hydrants.
Supervisor Clinton said that if the City
owned its water plant it could have 100
hydrants to the block at only the expense
of the hydrants, whereas now the City
had to pay $60 a year for each hydrant.
Chief Sullivan proceeded to say that
larger water mains were needed for pro
tection against lire. The water company
had done more work during the last two
years than it had done for tbe tea years
previous in the way of putting in larger
mains. J * - â¢ V
But there were a good many small ones
in the Western Addition and they should
be replaced wito larger ones. Larger
] mains should be placed in the manufactur-
I ing and large boarding-house districts of.
: the City.
Mayor Phelan said that in Portland,
I Me., and other Eastern cities there was
I no charge for water used for extinguish
! ing fires. "â¢:-;'_ : -."--.'if: â "..!./, â ".'*'
Chief Sullivan, in reply to a question by
i the Mayor, said that every city between
St. Paul and New Yon* had a fully paid
fire department. South of Market street, j
in this City, was not well equipped with
water facilities. The, small streets such as
Stevenson, Jessie, etc., had only small
mains and not enough hydrants, but the
1 condition in that district bad been very
) much bettered since the big fire several
| years ago.
Engineer Schussler asked whether it
i did not cost as much for expenses in
j maintaining the mains and hydrants and
] the water supply' when there were no fire'
i at all, and the Chief answered that he had
no doubt that such was the fact. He was
not making any complaints, but he
wished to say that San Francisco was not
in tbe condition which she should be. In
the next few years there should be 500
hydrants put in each year in order to
make the City safe. There should be 2COO
or 3000 more hydrants. ;
"The water pressure Is very good.
! Spring Valley, ; I believe, has more water
than she knows what to do with," added
the Chief.
He did not consider that the City was
well protected against fireâ not even the
business portion of it.
William Ireland, geologist and mining
engineer, was asked by Dr. Clinton as to
the supply of water that could be fur
nished from the neighborhod of Castro
j ville. He said that irom 50,000,000 to 80,
--000,000 gallons of water could be obtained
I from tbat region for San Francisco. He
i bad' had the water analyzed and it had
1 been found tbat. it was "sometimes as
| good as the Spring Valley Water."
Daniel Meyer, capitalist, appeared be
j fore the board and said that he owned a
I few shares of Spring Valley stock, but
' was not a large shareholder. The stock
â¢ had fluctuated between 90 and par for
many years past and had * paid 6 per cent.
* 'Do you know what rate of interest is
being paid by the bane* in this City?"
asked Mayor Phelan..
"Well." replied Mr. Meyer, "your bank
pays 4.20 percent; other bank* pay 4.26
and the Hibern pays 4 per cent."
This answer raised a laugh.
With reference to the rise in the market
price of Spring Valley stock, as evidenc
ing the confidence of. the public, Mr.
Meyer remarked that the public was like
a womanâ changing from day to day.
When asked why the stock had risen,
notwithstanding the announcements that
a new issue of 8000 shares was to be issued
shortly, he replied that that fact bad
astonished him. . 'He thought Mr.
Schussler had been indiscreet in making
| that announcement. If the rate were to
i be fixed at 5 per cent, the value of the
| stock would fall.
"My customers," said Mr. Meyer, "call
for gas and water stock, but they are mis
taken."
I "You share their confidence, then?"
I asked tbe Mayor.
"No," was the ready reply, "I share
one-quarter of 1 per cent commission."
"Now,!* proceeded the Mayor, "assum
ing that the Spring Valley property is
worth twenty million *
"What?" '
"Twenty-three millions." -\_* â 
-J "Well," said Mr. Meyer, reflectively,
"Is it not worth that?" inquired Mr.
Phelan. ' -
. "Well." was the reply/ "if it earns 6 per
cent I think it is worth it. I don't go to
the value of a thing. 1 go on the earning
capacity of the stock."
In answer to further - questions Mr.
Meyer said that Market-street Railway
bonds â  were selling iat j 106 and . paying 5
per cent interest. He always Considered
Market-street stock as better than Spring
Valley stock, becaus-* .the : Market-street
Railway was never subject to the domina
tion oi the Mayor and ; he Supervisors.
Since the election of the present Mayor
and the pre-ent Board of Supervisors his
confidence in . Spring Valley stock had
b**en â 'â  restored * for two years -to - come.
English : .consols; selling , at * 11-?*'
and paying ?. 2% ' per cent , Interest were a
better . investment than Spring Valley
stock. ."'â '*â 'â â â¢:' â ''â *â¢'': '*'"â â
"Suppose th* powers combine to destroy
England?" asked the Mayor. "I"
"Tbey have not done so," was the reply.
"They tried it in 1802. History teeches
us that during the French revolution
English consols went as low as 76. .Values
were restored after the battle of Waterloo,
ami they kept creeping up."
Mr. Meyer informed the board that
some savings banks .paid their stock
holders 6 per cent interest, and the re
mainder paid more.
"What is the liability of stockholder*
in savings banks?" asked the Mayor.
"None."
"Of stockholders?"
"None."
"You surprise met" exclaimed the
Mayor.
'It would not be the first time, " re
marked Mr. Meyer drily. Then he con
tinued: "In most every savings ' bank
where the directors Know their, business
the stockho ocrs are not liable. It is a
contract which you sign- when you de
posit your first $5 in the bank.
"Would that contract override the law?"
asked the Mayor.
"It is an honest contract," replied Mr.
Meyer. "Stockholders are liable only for
the unpaid capital stock.". -
"Is not 6 per cent reasonable consider
ing that they are liable lor the unpaid
capital stock?" asked the Mayor.
*Vj(ot in the*e times," was the answer.
"They ought to pay up their capital stork
or make the capital smaller. The stock
holders of the Spring Valley Company
can be sued on the bonded indebtedness.
They are also liable lor injury to private
property caused by the bursting of dams
and so forth." â¢ .:...?
A. L. Langermann, stockbroker, said
that the '.ambling element in the Spring
Valley stock caused by the agitation by
tha Supervisors every year and by dema
gogues always threatened and impaired
the value of the stock, so that 6 per cent
was but a reasonable interest on the in
vestment. Should the sate be reduced to
5 per cent the stock would fall to 80 or 81
San Francisco could place all the bonds it
wanted at 3 per cent.
"Then if tbe City should issue bonds and
buy out the water company," asked the
Mayor, "the City would save money by
paying 3 per cent on its bonds, instead of
6 per cent to the water company as now?"
"Yes," replied the witness.
Adam Grant, the next witness, thought
that the agitation against the Spring Val
ley Water Company bad hurt San Fran
cisco by driving away and keeping away
capital. United States bonds at 3 per
cent would be a better investment than
Soring Valley bonds at 7 per cent.
"Mr. Baldwin of the real estate firm of
Baldwin (t Howell testified that a reduc
tion of rates would be of great benefit to
property.
A telegram from A B. McCreery of San
Mateo was read in which Mr. McCreery
regretted his inability to attend the meet
ing and favoring such a reduction in rates
as would give the stockholders an income
of 5 per cent on their investment.
John T. Doyle of San Mateo sent in a
communication setting forth that in most
cities water works are owned by the pub
lic, the interest on tbe bonds being paid
out of the taxes, the water-consumers pay
ing only the running expenses.
The great benefit to the City of having a
copious supply of water in t be mains could
hardly be overestimated, for without it
property would be valueless and uninsura
ble. The writer suggested that the City
should ultimately buy tbe Spring Valley
works, raising the money by the sale of
bonds at 3 per cent.
This closed the taking of testimony and
at 11:45 p. .*-. tbe board adjourned, subject
to tbe call of the chair.
BAY CITYS GET THE CUP
They â  Did Not Violate the
Rules of the Relay
Race.
The Board of Governo of the Asso
ciation so Decid.-' by a Vo
of 15 to 7
By a vote of 15 to 7 the board of gov
ernors ot the California Associated
Cycling Clubs decided last night that the
protest against the Bay City Wheelmen
over the recent relay race be disallowed,
and by a unanimous vote this club was
awarded the permanent possession of tbe
Varney trophy.
The entire evening up to midnight was
consumed in examining a large number
of witnesses on both sides, the arguments
and direct and cross examining being
conducted by Frank H. Kerrigan for the
Bay City Wheelmen and Charles Albert
Adams for the Olympic Club Wheelmen,
the protestants. *
From the testimony it was not shown
that tbere had been any open violation of
tlie rules which affected the result of the
race in any way, though the Bay Citys ad
mitted a technical violation of a trifling
nature in two instances.
The decision of the board awarding the
Bay Citys the cud was unanimous, the
motion being made by President Adams
of the Olympics alter the board had voted
that tbe Bay Citys had committed no in
tentional breach of the rules governing
the race. â 
JURORS MUST SERVE.
Judge Slack Will Not Release Tales
men Except for Good Cause.
Judge .Slack's courtroom will be crowd
ed at 9 o'clock this morning, for that is
the time set for the appearance of citizens
summoned to act as jurors in the suit of
James 6. Fair's estate against Mrs. Nettie
R. Craven.
Courtroom Clerk Casey was instructed
by Judge Slack to give notice that every
person summoned -feast appear without
fail, and Bailiff Martin was informed that
all those whose names are on the list were
to be served, or a showing made for failure
to do so. The only excuse to be received
would be that the talesmen' so designated
are absent from the jurisdiction of the
court or dead.
A further order was also made by Judge
Slack relating to excusing jurymen from
service on the panel.
It is reasonably expected that 'the trial
will take a long time, and some business
men may wish to be released from the
obligation of sitting in the jury-box week
after week, to the neglect of their own
affairs, during a period of two or three
months, even though they are to be paid
$_ a day for their services.
Anticipating. an avalanche of applica
tions for dismissal from the pane]. Judge
Slack : has . announced that he will bear
excuses only in open court, and that the
excuses must be made from the bar of the
court, in the presence of all, and in a tone
of voice loud enough for all to hear. He
is opposed to the custom so long preva
lent of having jurymen crowd up to the
bench and pour their tales of woe into the
ear of the court in suppressed whispers
and painful undertones.
Owing to the importance of the interests
at issue it -is deemed ' requisite to have a
large contingent from which to select the
trial panel, and this consideration has led
to the rules here laid down.

OLYMPIC CLUB
HAS WITHDRAWN
The Amateur Athletic
Union Loses a Great
Western Member.
Eastern Laws Are Not Accept
able to the Local
Athletes.
Joe Gans and M. Leonard Have Been
Matched to Fight Twenty
Rounds.
The Olympic Club bas seceded 'from the
Amateur Athletic Union and the propo
sition - now is to form a California Ath
letic Association, which will have its own
laws independent of the rulings of the
union.
The directors at a meeting held last
evening discussed the question of vmh
drawing from the union very thoroughly
and they concluded that it was about
time tbat something drastic must
be accomplished to sustain amateur
athletics and restore the interest in the
sport* which have retrograded to an
alarming extent owing to the severe laws
imposed by the union. >,-w
President Newhall said that the club
bad contemplated withdrawing from the
union since January last.
"I cannot see where this club has
benefited in the least by being a member
of this august body," said Mr. Newhall.
"We are represented by only one indi
vidual in the Pacific Athletic Association,
and 1 judge a club with such a powerful
membership as the Olympic should at
least have three representatives in the
association:.".' '\ *''â¢'-â 
"Why, the South End Rowing Club,
which is composed of comparatively few
members, has as much to say in the meet
ings oi the association as this club, and as
a result of this unreasonabe comparison
we (the Olympic Club) have been over
ruled in almost everything that bas been
suggested by our representative for tbe
best interests of the club.
"To cap the climax this man Casper
Whitney, who is the mouthpiece of the
union and whose writings in an Eastern
weekly journal have aroused the ire of
thousands of athletes, made most vicious
attack upon the directors of this institu
tion soon alter the Olympic-Butte City
football game, which was held in Central
Park last January.
"The writer of tbe article in question ac
cused us of fostering professional athletes
and that amateur athletics on this coast
were in a very decayed condition.
"The A. A. U., as far as I can see, has
never been iriendly to the amateur ath
letes of the Pacific Coast and it is through
the rulings of tbat body that the present
condition of athletic affairs here must be
attributed. ; ,c<:>:
"We can form an association which can
very well afford to take care of itself with
out the so-called assistance of the Ameri
can Athletic Union, and with that object
in view our secretary has been instructed
to correspond with the secretaries of the
various amateur athletic clubs' of this
State, many of which nave already prom
ised to sever connection with the union
when. the matter of forming a Pacific asso
ciation is ready for discussion." v, >':
Howard Taylor, who is leader of tbe
club, expressed bis views ou the question
of secession from the union at the meet
ing of last evening. He said that he did
not wish to display a sentiment of ingrat
itude for the apparent effort of
the Pacific Association to carry
out the laws maintained by the
union, but that if those laws are
not consistent with the wishes of the ath
letes of this coast new rules and regula
tions must be made which will be accept
able to the athletes who are now in a
disgruntled and dissatisfied state of mind.
Mr. Taylor advocated better prizes and
better treatment for athletes. He be
lieved tbat a grand athletic associa
tion could easily be formed on
this coast and that athletic sports
of all kinds would flourish under
laws that will meet the wishes of amateur
athletes, who are now protesting against
the rulings of the American Athletic
Union. * v^'-
The club will give a grand boxing enter
tainment in May, and the secretary an
nounced that the club had consummated
a match between Joe Gans, the clever
colored pugilist of Baltimore and M.
Leonard of New York. .
The men will fight at 133 pounds, and,
*__ they are said to be well matched, a rat
tling good mill is looked for. It is quite
probable that J. Jeffries and Steve O'Don
nell will also be . matched. A telegram
from O'Donnell is expected to-day.
HUMPHREY HAS RESIGNED.
Why the President of the Athletic
Association Retired From
Active Service.
' William F. Humphrey, who is president
of the Pacific Athletic Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union, has not re
signed his position as head of the Pacific
Athletic Association, but be has severed
his connection as a representative of the
registration committee of the board of
governors and as a delegate of the P. A.
A. of the A. A. U.
On May 14 there will be held an election
of officers of the Pacific Coast "Amateur
Athletic Association, and Mr. Humphrey
states tnat he will remain president of the
association until that time. He will not,
however, accept a renomination as he has
had two years of active service, and he is
nor; very willing to allow some one else to
handle the athletic oars. , '
John Elliott, who has been for a num
ber of years a stanch supporter of ama
teur athletics and one of the best informed
men on this coast on all matters that per
tain to athletic sports, said the associa
tion will lose a most valuable and. pains
taking official should Mr. Humphrey not
reconsider his determination to retire per
manently from athletics.
"You must remember," said Mr. Elliott,
"that since the inauguration of profes
sional xb . "..ng matches in the Olympic
Club the amateur boxers became contami
nated and actually refused to box in tour
naments unless' prizes .of "much greater
value than the. American Athletic Union
allows were given. .
"Mr. Humphrey and his supporters
struggled hard to keep amateur athletics
clean, but instead of receiving the assist
ance he was justly entitled to from prom
inent members the* president of the asso
ciation received no encouragement, and I
do not wonder in the leas; that he grew
disgusted and threw up the sponce." \
As a member of the board of governors
of the A. A. U. -Humphrey's statements
bad considerable weight with the officers
of the union, and as a consequence he was
in a position to sustain. the interests of
the . Pacific > Coast amateurs in , Eastern -
legislation.'.
.Mr. Humphrey was strongly in favor of
registration from the 'beginning, but the
amateurs of the different clubs; which
com poj-e the - Pacific Association were al
most unanimous in their opposition to
registration and the tacking on of a regis
tration clause to the rules has jeopardized
the success of several of the coming ath
letic events. I^imiWWWTlpjMmw
"_ But President Humphrey - says the real
reason for this unlooked-for movement on
his part was : caused by legal business,
which is so engrossing that it occupies all
of his time, and; it will be impossible for
him to give his attention to amateur ath
letic affairs.
For some time past a movement has
been on foot to form a new association of
Pacific Coast amateurs which will have its
own form of . government, and it was
hoped that Mr. Humphrey would assume
the leadership of the new association,
which once formed would secede from the
Amateur Athletic Union.
Two years ago, when President Hum
phrey.was elected to office, the associa
tion was between $400 and $500 in debt, but
through his inde'atigable efforts the Uni
versity of California and the Stanford
University paid up their back dues. Other
organizations also came to time by pay
ing up back dues, and now Mr. Humphrey
can proudly boast of a treasury which is
full to overflowing.

Warren Dutton, president of the Dairy

were no currants in the jelly, that it was,
composed of glucose, cane sugai, coal-taff

The jury, after being out for several

were discharged. They stood six to six.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Five words to wheelmen: Help the
Balboa-avenue fund.
McKinley is right again. It is time to
get started in preparing for the Paris
exposition.
It is estimated it will take $10,000 to
complete Balboa avenue. There are just
10.0C0 reasons, therefore, why you should
subscribe to the fund.
From the vehemence with which the
Kentuckians are tearing down tollgates it
would seem that every tollroad in the
Stale must lead to a distillery.
The Turkish ultimatum has been deliv
ered in due form, and the Greek Govern
ment will put it on file along with those
of the powers for future reference.
The crisis in the Levant remains in
about tbe same situation from day to day,
but the Greeks don't They keep moving
all along the line and all the time.
The Republicans of the Senate stood pat
on the clause putting the Dinglev tariff
into effect on April 1, and importers might
as well begin to do business on that basis.
The next step necessary in naval archi
tecture is the construction of a battle-ship
which can knock a rock to pieces or move
a mud flat out of its way without any of
these annoying accidents.
Since Great Britain is able to build thor
oughly equipped naval stations all round
tbe globe it would seem that we ought to
be able to provide stations in our own
country equal to t..e demand of our war
ships.
Spain seems to have won her fieht in
tbe Philippines, and now if she is wise she
will make peace with the Cubans, call all
her troops home, join the European con
cert and have a picnic talking war instead
of making it.
If there is to be an inquiry into the
cause of the accident to the Oregon there
should also be an inquiry into the reason
why there is no drydock in Puget Sound
large enough to receive her in case she
has to be overhauled.
It is said that Ibsen's recent play, "A
Wild Duck,*' is not a success, but perhaps
if Bryan would leave the lecture platform
and take to the stage he might make a ten
strike in the title role and save the drama
from being a total loss.
The appointment of President Angell of
the University of Michiean to be Minister
to Turkey has been well received in this
country, and if he will greet tbe Sultan
with his college yell he will doubtless get
a fraternal welcome from tbe Bashi-
Bazouks.
The University of Illinois may get back
some of tbe bonds which Banker Spalding
got away with, but all the same the trus
tees of the institution have received a
higher education in such matters which
â¢will fit them to run a business college
hereafter.
When the Wilson tariff was sent to the
Senate it took the Democratic members of
the Finance Committee seven weeks to re
vise it before reporting it. The Repub
lican majority of the present Finance
Committee is expected to beat that record
and beat it badly.

The attempt of Jerry Simpson to Induce
the Democrats and Populists to make an
attack upon Speaker Reed and the rules of
the House has failed utterly. Most of tha
members of the opposition have monkeyed
with that buzz saw once and are* not will
ing to try it again.
.
At the banquet of the Boston Bankers'
Association on Tuesday evening it was
noted that the name of Cleveland was
cheered loudly, while that ol McKinley
was almost ignored, and now the guests at
that feast will never be allowed to say
"We are the people."
An Irish cycling journal is credited by
the Pittsburg Dispatch with the assertion
that wheels made for women by English
manufacturers are annoyine to Irish girls
because the pedals are too . large, and ;if
this is so it might be well to send to Ire
land a consignment- of American wheels
for women's use, those designed for the
Chicago market of course being barred
out.
. . â¢ . ' ..'
In explaining the result of the city elec
tion in Chicago 'the Inter Ocean says:
"Two clockmakers sold clocks to the Afri
can savages. One man's clock, though
inferior, sold better than the other's.
Why? Because it ticked louder. So with
the reformers in the late election. Caught
by the tick." This is altogether the most
satisfactory explanation of the affair that
has yet been given, It is clear that any
any political party which depends on tick
instead of cash in Chicago is bound to
lose. ." ' '
The statement of W. C. Ford, chief of
the Bureau of Statistics in the. Treasury
Department during the Cleveland admin
istration, that the ; exports of American
manufactures during the calendar year
1896 amounted in value to over $250,000,
--000, has been disputed, by a writer for the
Inter Ocean, who, in an elaborate review of
our foreign trade, shows that y they
amounted to less than : $135,000,000. * The
difference is so great that if > Mr. Ford â â  has
not lost his regard for .public opinion s as
well as his office he will have to rise up
and explain his figures.
RETROACTIVE LEGISLATION.
The vote taken in the Senate on Wednesday on the resolution introduced by Sen
ator Vest, declaring the orders of the Secretary of the Treasury as to the retroactive
section of the Dingley tariff bill to be without authority of law, may be fairly con
sidered a test of how the vote will stand on that question when it arises for final
action. The resolution was referred to the Finance Committee by the narrow ma
jority of 2. to 23, and it is noted that one Republicanâ Senator Chandlerâ with
the Democrats.
' Ever since the adoption of the clause declarins the tariff shall go into effect April
lit has been the subject of earnest comment throughout the country. The differences
of opinion have not by any means coincided with party lines, as several Republican
journals bave regarded the clause as invalid in law or inexpedient in legislation. Tne
fact, however, that the clause was adopted in the House and has now received the
weil-nigh unanimous support of the Republicans in the Senate is calculated to remove
any feeling of uncertainty in regard to the measure an \ make it fairly sure that when
the new tariff is enacted it will contain that clause and its duties will be levied on all
goods imported from the date named.
General Grosvenor, who has made a careful examination of the law, holds that tbe
clause is undoubtedly valid, and quotes as an authority a decision of the Supreme
Court on a somewhat similar case in which the court said: "The words in a statute
ought not to bave a retrospective application unless they are so clear, strong and im
perative that no other meaning can be annexed to them ; or unless the intention of the
Legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied." The clear inference from this is that ex
press retroactive legislation, such as that contained in the clause under discussion,
will be held by the court to be valid and binding.
The expediency of the clause is based upon the well-rocognized fact that since the
Dingley tariff bill raises the rate of duty on many articles of import, the postpone
ment of the adoption of those duties to a future date would lead to large Importations
by speculators who would thus reap the benefits of the higher duties. Such action on
the part of importers would clearly defeat the object of the bill, which is to raise at
once an adequate revenue for the Government and provide protection for American
industries.
Since there has been so much uncertainty in regard to this clause the vote taken
in the Senate will be of benefit to the country. It gives assurance that the friends of
the tariff measure in the Senate will be as favorable to this feature of it as were those
of the House. We may count, therefore, on the enforcement of the new tariff from
April 1 as an established fact, and proceed to do business on that basis.
THE PARIS EXPOSITION.
The recommendation of President Mc-
Kinley tbat Congres* act promptly in pro
viding for the representation of the United
States at the Paris Exposition in 1900 is
one that should receive immediate atten
tion from both houses. As the President
says: "It is proner that I should empha
size the need of early action, for if the
present session pass without suitable pro
vision being made, the postponement of
the matter for nearly a year longer could
not but operate greatly to the disadvan
tage of the United States, in view of the
elaborate preparations already made by
other Governments."
The first step toward carrying out the
recommendation of the President was
taken by Senator Mason in offering a joint
resolution accepting the invitation of the
French Government to participate in the
exposition and providing for a commission
to take charge of the work in this coun
try. The amount of money to be appro
priated under this joint resolution is so
small that it can hardly be intended for
more than a beginning, and further legis
lation will be necessary to provide for
making a display which will be commen
surate with our industries as a people and
our greatness as a Nation.
Each succeeding universal exposition is
in many respects superior to all which
have preceded it. As far as the great
Columbian Exposition surpassed its im
mediate predecessor, so far, in all proba
bility, will the coming exposition in Paris
surpass the triumphs at Chicago. In all
those departments of industry in which
the greatest advances may be expected in
1900, over what was attained in 1593,
America will take a prominent and possi
bly a leading part It is in the domain of
mechanism, engineering and architecture
that the world is now rapidly progressing,
and certainly in these fields of endeavor
we can surpass all rivals if we make any
thing like a full exhibit of our work.
Perhaps the most important feature of
the world's progress in our time i* tbe de
velopment of facilities for transportation,
and the growth in this direction has led
to important results in commerce and in
dustry. Improved railroad and improved
ocean transportation make it possible to
transmit food products of a perishable
nature to Europe from such far-off lands
as California, Argentina and Australia.
In consequence of this there has grown up
among European peoples a large market
for fruits of all kinds produced in all parts
of the world. There will, of course, be a
lavish display of these fruits at the Paris
Exposition and it is important to the wel
fare of our people that we should make an
exhibit of our products of the kind which
will be at least equal if not superior to
that made by any rival we may have in
any quarter of the globe. . *
The subject hardly needs elaboration.
The importance of a good exhibit is every
where recognized. People will not count
it extravagant if Congress, in acting on
the recommendation of the President, not
only takes early action to provide for a
display at Paris . but accompanies it with
an appropriation large enough to make
the display worthy of America and bene
ficial to American interests.
M'KIKLEY AND CUBA,
It has been disclosed at Washington
that the determination of the Madrid
Government to prevent General Weyler
from executing Rivera was not reached
upon its own initiative. Our Government,
it seems, had much to do with it by tak
ing prompt action as soon as the an
nouncement was made of the capture of
Rivera to secure for him the treatment
which a soldier deserves at the hands of
civilized enemies.
It Is stated that immediately after the
reception of the news of the capture of
Rivera the President 'directed the Secre
tary of State to draw up a protest against
the reported intention of General Weyler
to try him by drumhead court-martial.
After consideration it was decided be
tween the President and the Secretary not
to make the protest in writing, but to in
form the Spanish Minister of the views of
tbe administration and .give him notice
that the Government of the United States
considers the Cubans to be neither trait
ors nor murderers, but recognizes them as
soldiers entitled to all the rights of pris
oners taken in civilized war.
The protest thus informally given was
sufficient. It did its work as effectively as
if it had been written and sent to Madrid
as an ultimatum. It made clear to the
Spanish authorities that the new admin
istration is quite different fiom the old,
and that it intends to carry out a foreign
policy :in complete sympathy with : the
sentiments of the American people. That
was all which was required. Mi. Cleve
land could have done, as much if he had
been equally careful to uphold the dig
nity of the United States and in its name'
maintain for the Cuban people the rights
of humanity and civilization. Â
. '_ It Is not; too much |to expect * that the
protest made in the case of Rivera will
serve effectually to protect all Cubans who
may be captured any time during the con
tinuance of the war. The action -: of the
President Is virtually a recognition of the
Cubans as _â¢ belligerents, and Spain' here
after will have to treat them not as Gen
eral Weyler wishes, but "as*- thV" American
people demand.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 16. 1 897.
BALBOA AVENUE.
j It is estimated that about $10,000 more
I is needed to complete the work on Balboa
1 avenue. If that sum is forthcoming the
: work can be prosecuted without delay and
, the great thoroughfare put into condition
i for general use. The sum is not large
when the importance of the avenue and
the wealth of the City are taken into con
sideration, and it is to be hoped that it
can bo raised in time for the work to be
carried on continuously and without a
break to the end.
To the wheelmen of the City the enter
: prise Is one of special value and impor
! tance. It will open for them a splendid
i roadway in addition to those which the
City has already provided. They there
fore ought to be liberal in their contribu-
I tions and earnest in their efforts to raise
j money for the work. The number of
J wheelmen in the City is so large that if
I all of them should contribute or any
. [ considerable number of them make a
| vigorous canvass for funds it would
not be long before the needed money
would be raised and the committee in
' charge of the work furnished with a sum
sufficient to open the avenue and put it
j in a thoroughly good condition from one
j end to the other.
So much has been accomplished in this
! work tbat it would be most regretable to
I have to abandon it now. It would be bad
j indeed if it were even necessary to delay
; the work for a few days and disband the
forco which is now engaged upon it.
These facts will be generally recognized
by all who have given the subject any con
sideration whatever. They are, therefore,
among the most potent reasons why sub
scriptions to the fund should be not only
| liberal but prompt. The wheelmen ought
to take it up. The road will â¢be for their
I pleasure and benefit when completed, and
I it should be accounted a part of their
S general duty to the community to show a
j true public spirit and civic patriotism in
i promoting it and hastening its successful
j completion. â  -

"THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL."
Letters From Our; Readers on Topics of Current
Interest.
As to Direct Legislation.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: It is safe to say that there are but two classes of American
citizens who stand out "against direct legislation, by the -people after they understand the
system, and these two classes find ln our present form of representative legislation a fertile
source of profit or a corrupt means of political promotion. -I have no doubt that there are
many Intelligent readers of The Call - who will deny this statement, but I propose to make It
good, because it is true. â¢â¢â .-.
Let us first try to agree upon what is meant by direct legislation by the people, else the
dissenting reader may be thinking of something entirely different from what the writer r urge'
him to accept as of vital interest to the Republic. Indeed, I may say at this point that I can
see no way out of the deplorable conditions which now afflict our country except through the
speedy adoption of the system of direct legislation. It is not an experiment, for we : already
practice lttn all the States of the Union, and in a wav also by the Congress o' the United
btates, out only to a limited extent. Every State constitution now in force was adopted by a
direct vote of the people, and that is direct legislation, pure and simple. ~
.Â».Â« *, he constitution of 'he United Stales, with every amendment to It, was adopted by a two
thirds vote of the several States through their Legislatures, which is a limited use of the refer
endum ana is equivalent to the adoption of a State consiitution or an amendment to it by a
two-thirds vote of the Supervisors in * the several counties of the State. But the men who
framed the constitution of the United States had but little practical knowledge of the form of
government th-y set up. When we remember who these men wereâ what their experience
was ana how they were trainedâ we can but marvel that they comprehended so clearly and
annnounced so unequivocally the great principle that governments derive thÂ»lr just powers
from the consent of the governed, and on that fundamental fact founded our Government.
Direct legislation thus appears to be simply the putting in practice to its full and legiti
mate extent of the theory on which our Government was founded. But lt remained for the
immortal Lincoln, nearly a century later, with all the light of experience thrown upon the
system, to set forth and define it as "a Government of the people, by the people, for the peo
ple. a hat any but a corporation-serving or a corporation-owning Republican can be opposed
to Lincoln s conception of our system of Government, which is iv fact the system of direct
legislation can be accounted for on the sole ground of prejudiced ignorance. And that a
Democrat should opppse it is a contradiction of his loudest professions and an unhappy ex
posure of his limited Democracy. Corrupt legislation is admitted by allâ except those who
P -5Â« i- * i,â to â â¢ tbe curse of our times and the disgrace of our country. And this curse and
this disgrace come to us as the result of representative legislation.
I aD > le( ) to take up direct legislation for consideration at this time by an address of the
Boston Nationalist Club, just issued, ln which the referendum and initiative, the two elements
of direct legislation, are discussed, ana I heartily wish every reader of The Call had a copy
2. -s"dress,5 "dress, and, better still, had a disposition to read it with the desire to understand it.
The address truly says that the principle of direct legislation is well known in Massachusetts
as changes in the constitution are referred to the people for decision, and the liquor question
is annually so referred. Recently the question of female suffrage was so referred for the pur
pose of discovering the real opihion of the people on the subject. 'In the New England town
meeting the principle has long been in fnl play, which Jefferson pronounced "the wisest
Invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government and its
preservation."
This address correctly states the operation of the system, as for example: "If anyone
thinks a law passed by the Legislature is bad, he can, under the referendum, within a given
time, sign his name to a petition asking for the law to be referred to the people. He then cir
culates the petition among hi* fellow-citizens, and If a certain number, say one twelfth affix
their names, the question ot the adoption of this law is sent to the polls at the next election,
and it is rejected or adopted, according to the vote of the people," precisely as they deal now
with a constitutional amendment. Thus the referendum protects the citizens from bad laws.
Or, if a bad law is on the statute-books, and a certain number of citizens petition for its re
peal, it must likewise be submitted at the next election to a vote of the people. The initia
tive is usea in this way: "If any one wants a new law he gets it drafted, circulates a petition
for its adoption, and tbe Legislature submits it to the voters for approval or rejection."
There is much force in what the Boston address says of the representative system of
Government established by the founders of the Republic as being the only form possible at
that time, since it would have been impossible before the introduction of steam transporta
tion, electricity and a well-developed postal system to convey Information to the voters as
quickly and completely as direct legislation requires. Moreover, the fathers of the Re
public never Imagined that the time would come when the country would be in the grasp
of trusts and corporations which could run the Government in their own interests in viola
tion of the public welfare, as they do at this day. Let the people pass upon the laws when
they so desire, and then they themselves will rule. Rut until that day comes the corporations
will continue to make, interpret and enforce the laws.
855 Market street, April 15, 1897. JOSEPH ASBURY JOHNSON.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: In view of the present pure-food crusade row
going on I would like to make a suggestion. I maintain (and I believe Professor Winzell or
any good chemist will b?ar me out in this) that the most important and necessary condition
in making all jams and jellies is to cook the fruit when it is perfectly fresh and before any
fermentation has set in, and this can best be done by putting up these goods where the fruit is
grown. Canneries and packers in cities cannot do this, as the lruit they get is always a day
old, and there is in these Institutions a general feeling that anything is good enough for jam
We have the finest fruit country in the world ana almost the poorest jams and leliies'ln
the stores, and I feel sure that if our fruit farmers were told plainly how to produce the finest
goods there would be a great Improvement in this class of goods and a large source of profit to
the most deserving class of men.
Plainly printed directions could be distributed to those who would apply for them uni
form styles of packages encouraged, and the results must surely be very gratifying alike to
producer and consumer. " H. <_.. C alley
San Francisco, April 15.
To the Editor of the San FrancUco Callâ Sib: What is the cause of the hot days? is a
qnestlon that is often asked. If they came in the middle of summer we wouldn't be one bit
surprised; but they are liable to come at any time during the year.
Stillness of the atmosphere seems to me to be the cause; and I think it is the cause. I
notice on those hot aays we can stand on any street corner to wait for a friend and we don't
have to stand out of the wind, even upon hills, because there is no wind ; and at night we can
carry a lighted candle anywhere. .
Then, stillness of the atmosphere is the cause.
Sometimes the wind blows itself out. After traveling hundreds of miles it finally comes
to a standstill, Â»nd if Its stopping- place happens to be here then there is nothing to hinder
the sun from pouring down its heat upon us, and we get it hot and heavy till the wind beeins
to blow again. __ A LAWTO^-

Their employes being, willing, the
Southern Pacific Company and. the Mar
ket-street Railway Company will join in
the establishment of a hospital wherein
members, on the payment of a certain
monthly fee, not to exceed 50 cents, will
receive medical assistance of all kinds in
cases of accident or illness.
The idea originated with the Southern
Pacific Company, but as that company
has not enough employes in this City to
warrant the establishment of such an in
stitution on its own account it was de
cided to secure the co-operation of the
street railway employes.
About ten days ago' the first ciicular
relative to the matter was sent out to the
heads of the various divisions of the
Southern Pacific Company in this City,
and tie result was deemed sufficiently
favorable to interest the sister corporation.
So yesterday General Manager Vining of
the Market-street .Railway Company sent
out the "following circular:
To All Heads cf Departments; The Southern
Pacific Company has been requested to estab
lish a hospital In San Francisco, A decision
M to whether it will do so or not will probably
be reached during the present visit of C. P.
Huntington; aud it is probable that the
decision will be governed by the decision of
the Market-street -Railway Company as to
whether it will or will not join the Southern
Pacific Company in the establishment of such
a hospital for the benefit ol the employes of
the two companies.
It Is hardly necessary to state that among so
large a force of men accidents and sickness
require medical attendance of a nature which
can be provided better and more economically
by means of such a hospital as is proposed
than in any other way. The expense of con
tracting for necessary treatment will not
exceed 50 cents per month, and It may be
found practicable to make the fee somewhat
less than that amount.
We have, no desire to force upon our em
ployes any provision of the kind above men
tioned, and do not intend to have anything to
do with it unless it is not only satisfactory to
them, but really desired by them.
â  I therefore inform you of the situation, with
the request that you lay the matter before
your employes in such way as you think
proper. If they desire action taken upon the
subject, they can in any way they choose notify
you of such desire. â¢ \
If such action is not taken it will ba under
stood that the employes do not desire such
hospital privileges, and the matter will be
dropped. What we wish to obtain is a free and
candid. expression of the opinion of onr em
ployes upon the subject, and in the absence of
positive action by them it will be understood
that they prefer to leave matters as they are.
*' Not until it has been found that a satis
factory number are willing to participate
in tbe scheme will it be decided whether a
hospital will be built or some existing in
stitution utilized j for the care of the sick
and injured. * -.----'- Â»â Â»-..Â» -â¢-. - <. â¢-.-â¢

I Crocker Lodge of the Ancient Order of
: the Workmen Gives Its First En
, tertainment.
Crocker Lodge No. 302, A. O. U. W., which
was organized about two months ago from
among the ranks of the streetcar men of the
Mission district, gave its first, smoker and en
tertainment in Excelsior Hall on Wednesday
night, and it turned out to be one of the best
of its kind ever given by a lodge of this order
in this City. The talent secured by John Van
Alen, A. C. Williams, P. Franke, J. H. Collin
son, Gus Hartman, W. Tonkin and J. Bruce,
the committee on entertainment, was of high
order and the various numbers presented
were, to use a commercial term, "Al." S. M.
Snyder, the master workman of the lodge,
acted as master of ceremonies. There was pre
sented a selection by the Railroad band, an or
ganization composed almost exclusively of
men in the employ of the street railroad com
pany. It is under the leadership of W. 11. Ram
sey Jr., and although but six months old gave
evidence of careful training. Professor F.
G. Hall, who during the evening acted as ac
companist, sang "The Village Organist";
Master Severs gave a vocal solo and whistled
the chorus with fine effect; Dr. W. H. Fearu
gave a classical selection on the cornet; J.
Guerrero, a heel-and-toe artist, showed how
; difficult it is to dance a jig on a carpeted floor,
I after which Mr. Armad sang, "They All Love
Jack," a nautical song. Grand Recorder Hirsh
berg delivered a brief but highly Instructive
address on the order, its aims ana accomplish
ments, tor the benefit of those present who were
not members of the order. It was a very con
cise explanation of what the Ancient Order of
United Workmen has done in the past and
what it will do for the benefit of
Its members in the future. There was
a . recess, during which refreshments ' and
a collation was served, in the meantime Dr.
Fearn, E. Mohrig and Professor Hall perform
ing a cornet, violin and piano trio. . Alter that
R. A. Clarke and William Massett, a new pair
of entertainers, gave a very Interesting num
ber, consisting of imitations without instru
ments of a cornet solo, the park baud, the Ger
man band, bugle calls with echo and the
Chinese music as performed at Little Pete's
funeral. Mr. Clarke also gave evidence of his
ability as a whistler. The imitations were a
novelty, and, being excellent; were very much
appreciated. Grand Receiver Sam Booth gave
some of his versifications â  to an original air.
It was about what will happen when the City
Hall Is finished and it convulsed the audience.
Deputy Wells had a few words to say for the
order and Crocker Lodge and Its officers, after
which there were several other numbers and
then the band played "Good Night."
The officers of the lodge are J. Van Alen, past
master workman; S. M. Snyder, master work
man; A. C. Williams, foreman ;-F. Clapp, over
seer; T. M. Perm, recorder; J. W. McClintock,
financier; W. H. Cards.* receiver; G. Hartman,
Inside watchman; Fred Rickard, outside
watchman. When the lodge - was organized
there were quite a number of signatures to the
petition for. a charter. Since then fifty-two
have been initiated, and there are now twenty
applications for membership, not including a
number that were received on Wednesday
night. The applicants wil" shortly be Initiated

CHANGES IN MANUFACTURING
Improvements in the Industrial World and
What they Imply.
' ft. Louis Globe- Democrat.
It takes a bright business man in these times
to keep the run of all that Is going forward in
the Industrial world. That it is in a transi
tion state is evident enough, but the rapidity
of the changes increases with each succeeding
year. There was a time when a manufacturer
bought a boiler and engine, and considered
the question of power settled for good. Now
he must watch the progress of electricity and
bo ready to use the current, perhaps over a
long-distance wire. The means of transporta
tion are undergoing constant improvement
and this implies a prompter distribution of
goods. Men in trade are conscious that they
are facing new conditions and must be ready
to adapt themselves to the latestach!e7emems
of Inventive skill. While Industries are be
coming more efficient the field reached by
their products is broadening and the outlook
presents more novel points of interest than
ever before. . . â¢
With a domain as vast In extent and varied
in resources as our own country Americans
are justified in regarding the manufacturing
situation with keen attention. Our exporta
tion of steel rails jumped from 8801 tons in
1895 to 72,503 tons in 1896. American shoes
are beginning to find a market abroad, and
American cloths of certain kinds are admitted
to be better than any of their class. Bicycles
made in this country have a reputation
throughout Europe.
A list: of all the American goods attracting
notice in foreign countries would be a long
one. Our manufacturers are quicker to seize a
new idea than are those of similar pursuits in
the Old World, and the arts that add grace and
beauty to a fabric or an implement are not
overlooked in our shops. No reason exists
why our productions may not become more la
mous, as the years run by. This will happen
in spite of. the constant assertion of free-trad
ers that the foreign demand for our goods rests
with a foreign regulation of our tariff*. A rea
sonable protective tariff* will not in the slight
est degree interfere with , a legitimate foreign
trade. Germany is a protectionist country,
and yet one of the perplexities of British
tradesmen is that their home market is flood
ed with German goods.
: When Americans compare the extent and
natural richness of their country with those of
England, Germany and France, it needs no
prophetic power to foresee that we are des
tined to take the leading place in the indus
trial world. The new administration may be
depended on to give intelligent consideration
to the growing businessof manufacturing, and
to spread the knowledge, through our consuls,
of any superior achievement of our artisans.
Our manufacturers will be as quick as any to
adopt improved methods, and to turn the
transition now going forward into an advan
tage. Good workmanship, fair dealing, ar
tistic styles and attention to novelties of merit
are arguments that no judicious tariff can
weaken, and our industries may confidently
press forward to reach the markets of the
world without waiting to discuss the matter
with economic theorists. y,

WILL OBSERVE
THE PASSOVER
Hebrews All Preparing
for the Festival of
Freedom.
Ceremonies Typical of the Ser
vitude of Israel in
Egypt.
. â , j i
The F- ast to Continue Eight Days,
With Appropriate Services in .
the Synagogue.
.
Hebrew residents in all parts of the
civilized world will this evening com
mence an eight days' celebration of the
Feast of Passover, or "Pesach," as it is
called in the vernacular of the chosen
people.
The festival derives both its name
and origin from the events recorded in
the second book: of tbe Old Testament,
These _re the descent into Egypt,
the oppression of the Israelites by
the Egyptians, the retaliatory plagues
upon Pharaoh and his people, the exodus
from Egypt and the drowning of the
hosts of the E yptians, their chariots and
their horses in the Red Sea.
The Feast of the Passover is celebrated
on the evening of the 14th day of the first
mouth of the Jewish calendar, Nisan.
Preparations for the festival are made
while it is yet light. The good Hebrew
housewife sets the table, upon which are
spread the sbankbone^of a lamb and a
bard-boiled egg, emblematic of the an
cient Paschal Lamb and the Levitical of
fering; four unleavened cakes, symbolical
of the unleavened bread which the
Israelites baked in the sun from the
dough made in haste in Egypt; horse
radish, typical of the bitter servitude en
dured by them, and a mixture of chopped
fruitsâ almonds, cinnamon and raisins â
called "charosetb," symbolizing the mor
tar with which were built Pithom ana
Kameses, the treasure cities of the
Egyptians. "'. 'â ". ;.'
The festival throughout all its observ
ances commemorates the national free
dom. Everything possible is done to im
press this fact upon the celebrants. Thus
during the whole services in the house
hold ihe participants lean upon pillows
and with th same object in view ; even the
meanest Hebrew servant in the house
hold is permitted to sit at table with the
master thereof. : ' â ; ; ; ;
Immediately after service in the syna
gogue on the first nights of the Passover
(called the "Nights to Be Observed") the
master of the house takes the sunciitica
tion cup of wine, with which he inaugu
rates the festival. He then lays his hand
upon the unleavened bread and exhibit
ing it to all present repeats the formula
that has descended from the Babylonian
exile and beginning, "Lo, this is the bread
of affliction which our fathers ate in the
land of Eeypt. Let all who are hungry
enter and eat." This formula is read in
the Aramaic text.
The youngest member of tbe company
then asks: "Why is this night distin
guished from all other nights?" He
bases his question upon tbe peculiar riles
that he sees perlormed and the distinct- '
ive articles of food he perceives exhib
ited. The master of th. house answers
bis question in the* traditional narrative,
beginning: "Slaves were we in the land
of E.ypt, and the Eternal, our God,
brought us forth from mere with a strong
hand and an outstretched arm, and if the
Most Holy, blessed be be, bad not re
deemed us from Egypt, behold! we, our
children and our children's children
would have been perpetual slaves to Pha
raoh in Egypt."
The remainder of the services consist of
quotations from rabbinical writers, of ad
ditions to and emendations of the original
biblical text. Supper is then served and
the rest of the evening is spent in chant
ing the "Hallel," or songs of praise.
The festival is observed iv the syna
gogues by the orthodox on the first two
and the last two days of the Passover. The
reform element of the Jewish community,
however, observes only the first day and
the eighth..
Services will be held in the Temple
Etnanu-EI and the Sheritb Israel and Beth
Israel synagogues to-morrow, when ser
mons on timely themes will be delivered
by Rabbis Voorsanger. Nieto and Levy.

The Pacific Coast Women's Press Asso
ciation has been in existence for nearly
seven years, and ranks in size third of the
women's press clubs of the United States.
It was projected by Mrs. Emelie Tracy
Y. Parkhurst, daughter of John Swett,
long at the bead of public education
in this City and State.
It has had lor president Mrs. Nellie
Blessing Eyster, the popular lecturer of
the W. C. T. U. ; Mrs. Charlotte Perkins
Stetson, another gifted lecturer, at present
connected with reformatory and charita
ble work in the East; Mrs. Emily Brown
Powell of Alameda, Mrs. Ada Henry Van
Pelt of Oakland and Mrs. Hester A. Dick
inson of. Alamedaâ all women of distin
guished ability. For six years Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper, whose name is world wide, was
an honored vice-president, and by her in
fluence gave wise direction to its affairs.
Her close friend, Mrs. George T. Gaden,
has also filled that office. So have Miss
Eliza D. Keith, the stirring orator and ad
vocate of "Old Glory" on the school build
ings; Mrs. Frances Fuller Victor, the
historian of the Northwest; Miss Ina
Danna Coolbrith, the poet-laureate of Cali
fornia, and other gifted women.
The able corresponding secretaries have
been: Mrs. Parkuurst, the founder; Mrs.
George T. (laden and Mrs. Marlon Beattie
Foster. Bright and energetic women have
filled all the offices, ana only want of
space prevents individual mention of
many more names.
Among the honorary members are Mme.
Helena Modjeska. Mrs. Jessie Benton
Fremont and other names distinguished
in social, literary, art and science circles.
There are over eighty active members,
ten associate members and of life mem
bers a dozen or more.
This association it was which gave rise
to the Midwinter Women's Congress, out
of which grew the permanent organiza
tion of the annual congress, whose meet
ings are held in May of each year, and out
of the same elements grew the* very in
teresting and popular suffrage 1 amend
ment campaign of last year. So widely
has extended the influence of the move
ment set on foot seven years ago by one
delicate woman, .whose frail life went out
in giving life to another.
The association has pursued its way
quietly, holding stated meetings and
yearly conventions. After each of these

be "relished by the wisest men."

FRIENDS OF THE ANIMALS
The Local Society Will Move

Oific:rs E ecte_.
The headquarters for the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will
shortly be changed from the Donohoe
building, Market and Taylor streets, to
the Animals' Home, Sixteenth and Ala
bama streets. This decision was reached
yesterday at the meeting of the trustee*-,
lt was the largest meeting held in many
months, only one trustee being absent.
For a long time it has been tbe desire of
the trustees to concentrate their forces.
The property of the Animals' Home, in
which tbe public Pound is located, has
cost the society over $20,000, and the
trustees did not see the wisdom of paying
a high rent for a downtown office when
all of the business of tbe home and the
public Pound, which has teen under tbe
care of the society for the past four years,
can be transacted at one place.
The building is a new ana substantial
structure and alterations will be made at
once, so that the secretary will have a
good office. That officer will be provided
with a horse and cart tor traveling around
the City on official business. The prem
ises will be inspected to-day with the view
of making the necessary alterations.
Secretary Charles B. Holbrook's report
from March IS to April 14 showed 265
cases of cruelty to animals and fowls. Of
these 127 were lame horse* working sick
and galled horses, 34; beating horses. 8;
overdriving, overworking and underfeeding
horses, 20; crueltyto dogs, fowls, pigeons,
cats and list*. 21 cases. Of these 29 cases
were prosecuted and 230 remedied without
prosecution. Ol tbe 29 prosecutions there
were 23 convictions, resulting in 22 offend
ers being lined. In all 442 animals were
afforded relief and 8 Bent to tbe Animals'
Home.

WOULD NOT GO TO
SEA ON FRIDAY
Chinese Cannerymen Who
Held All the Trump
Cards.
A Sailors* Superstition That Hur
ried the Sailing of â  the
Sterling.
ihe Old Bark Join Wesley Has Seen
Her Last Days- To Be Made
Into a Storeship.
There was trouble on the American ship
i Sterling yesterday. It was thought that
the vessel would be ready to sail for the
canneries during the afternoon, and a tug
was ordered to low her to sea. There was
so much to be done in the shape of clean
ing up, however, that Captain' Davis de
cided to remain in port until this morning,
and consequently countermanded â¢ the
order for the tup.
When the Chinese beard of this there
was a small insurrection in the forecastle.
The coolies had mixed so much with sail
ors during their annual ( trips to the can
neries tbat they bad imbibed the seamen's
belief in bad luck following a ship that
sailed on Friday.
The boss went to Captain Davis and
asked:
â¢'You sail this afternoon?"
"What has that got to do with you?"
roared tbe captain.
"No sail to-day, Chinaman no sail to
morrow. Chinaman sail Saturday."
The skipper stormed and raged, but
when he saw bis 150 Chinese coming on
deck ready to march ashore be gave in
and again ordered the tug. The Chinese
went back to their quarters, and an hour
later the Sterling, with her deck littered
with freight that there was no time to
stow, was on her way to sea. The Chinese
won their case, and the Sterling did not
sail on a Friday. ;â 
There is a surplus of laden sugar boats
in port just now. Eleven of them are
awaiting a chance to discbarge, and their
cargoes represent 151,774 sacks of the raw
material. Among the lucky ones are the
schooner Robert Lewers, which will dock
at Mission Rock to discharge, and the
schooner Honolulu, which will jro to the
sugar refinery this morning. The other
vessels awaiting a turn are the bri_s

The old time missionary bark John
Wesley will leave in a few days for the

The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday. All the bids for tbe
laying of blocks on Folsom-street wharf
were rejected and nev,- ones will be called
for. Captain Nelson made a strong plea
in favor of home industry, and said that
if any blocks were used they should be
redwood.
The work of constructing a new hy
draulic hoist for the ferry slip at the
Southern Pacific ferry was let to the Vul
can Iron Works, for $1324. The board's
attorney was instructed to commence suit
against the bondsmen of Galloway, Towl
ney & Co. for the money lost in repairing
Steuart-street wharf. The contract was
let to tbe firm named, but it failed to
finish the work and the State had to com
plete it. v
j On the advice of '_ the board's attorney it
was. decided not to accept rent from the
Valley road for the land granted them In
China Basin until the courts have decided
whether the lease has been forfeited or
not. Commissioner Chadbourne protested
vigorously against the passage of tbe reso
lution, but he was overruled. His conten
tion was that no obstructions of any kind
should be thrown in the way of the com
peting road by the State.
TARIFF ON COAL.
Local Manufacturers Struggle With the
T-f'O".* S-T^ Question of Duty or No !
Duty.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association yesterday the matter of Con
gress placing an increased tariff on an
thracite coal was considered. In the early
part of the year the association put itself
on record against the incroase of such
duty. Since then several large consumers
of this coal, fearing that such an increase
would be made, have prepared a dispatch
to be lorwarded to Senator George C.
Perkins, which reads as follows: ;*; .:
George C. Perkins: The placing of a duty on
anthracite coal would be a serious blow to our
Interests. We respectfully ask you to oppose
such action. .-â¢â :-:.â¢; -;*â¢".â  "-^'T. â -..'â¢ .

When this was brought up in the meet
ing, it met with decided opposition by
Charles K. Allen, who argued in favor of
a tariff to protect the coal mines of the
United Stales and particularly of the Pa
cific Coast. .
J. W. Kerr was of the opinion that an
increased duty on foreign coal would
simply Impose an extra tax upon the man
ufacturers without benefiting the con
sumption of local coal.
Samuel McKee was of the opinion tbat
if the coast is to compete ' with the world
it must have cheap fuel. 7 '-J'J, \ . -.
It was decided to refer the matter to a
special meeting of the board.
NOTES OF THE THEATERS.
The Alcazar Company Will Go
x to Honolulu in
June.
Skinner to Repeat The Lady of
Lyons" at the Baldwin
TcNight.
"Called â¢ Back" is proving one of the
most popular productions that the Alca
zar company has appeared in, for despite
the penitential season it is drawing large
houses. The long cast is effectively filled,
and George Os bourne does some intense
acting in the Siberia scene, which is pret
tily staged, though the clanking of chains
is rather melodramatically in evidence.
F. W. Robertson's comedy. "The Over
land Route," will be next week's offering.
In June the Alcazar company will go to
Honolulu to play a summer season at the
new opera-house, which was opened last
year by the Frawley Company.
Otis Skinner repeated "The Lady of
Lyons" at the Baldwin Theater last night
with the success that marked its produc
tion on Tuesday. It has been decided to
repeat the Lytton play at the Saturday
matinee. To-morrow night "Hamlet" will
be the bill and the season will close on
Saturday night with "Richard III."
Primrose and West's minstrel troupe
will come to the Baldwin on Sunday. A
great many vocal and comical novelties
are promised. â¢"â ''â " â .-.".
Georgia Cayvan is pursuing a prosper- I
ous career at the Columbia Theater with
"Squire Kate." On Monday the bill will
be ctian-cÂ«t for "Mary Pennington, Spin
ster," with which Miss Cayvan began her
tour in New York. This is a new comedy,
by W. R. Wilkes, in which the over-edu
cated woman is made the subject of deli
cate satire.
. T. Daniel Frawley is back from Europe
and is organizing his new company in
New York. While abroad he secured
three new plays. One is an adaptation of
a French comedy, and another is a melo
drama by an English author, called "The
Scapegrace." The Frawleys will begin
their third annual engagement at the Co
lumbia on Monday evening, May 31.
A good scenic production of "The Waifs
of New York" is providing excitement for
patrons of the Grand this week. Mollie
Thompson, the new. soubrette, has estab
lished her popularity by her portrayal of
a boy's role, and the songs she sings are
all bright and catchy.
"The Lily of Killarney" is one of the
best revivals the Tivoli has had for some
time past. Active preparations are going
on for the first San Francisco production
of "Sham us O'Brien." *
The Orpheum is having the usual large
houses. Among the new-comers the
Faust family have proved a success.
PATRIOTIC LADIES.
A New Departure by Sequoia Chapter,
Daughters of the American

At the March meeting of pSequoia Chap
ter, Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, it was decided that in order to make
meetings more attractive and interesting
a new departure should be taken, and the
ladies concluded to hold nine meetings a
year, three of which should be devoted to
literature, three to social intercourse, and
three to strictly business.
In accordance with this determination
the first of the series of literary meetings
was held on Monday at the residence of
Mrs. L. L. Baker, from the staff over
which floated the American flag. There
was a full: attendance, and in the patri
otically decorated parlors there was much
enthusiasm.
Mrs. Baker exhibited a platter brought
to America in 1630 by Governor Winthrop.
who was the first Governor of Massachu
setts.
The following was the programme that
was presented, and it proved a source of
groat enjoyment to all:.
Piano solo (Grieg), Miss Margaret Cameron;
original paper, "Colonial Homes," Mrs. llors
borough; song, "Spring" (Henshel Nash),
Miss Bergland, accompanist Miss Cameron;
"An Old Colonial Will," Miss Maude A. Smith
sonnet, "Lexington" (original), Miss Alma P.
Alden; "The Dream Ship" (Eugene Field),
Mrs. Langstroth. with Chopin accompaniment,
Miss Brlnn; "The First Settlers of Our Coun
try," Mrs. George Law Smith.

Two little girls, anxious to aid the un

proud and^happy when they saw $2, their
contribution, safely in the hands of
Colonel Sullivan, Mayor Phelan's secre
tary. â  < * ' ,'
Miss May .Sandy and Miss May Mc
carty, one 11 years old and the other 12,
live with their parents on Chapultepec
street, Bernai Heights, the father of the
former being a contractor.
Somehow their minds absorbed the idea
that the unemployed were deserving of
the aid of even the children, Bnd they
concocted the brilliant plan of eiving a
show to swell the funds. Music and reci
tations were arranged for the performance,
and it was decided to charge 5 cents ad
mission instead of the bottle, sack or oil
can usually demanded at the entrance of
boys' shows.
When the much-longed-for occasion ar
rived a few days ago they had an even
forty people in the house, as many
nickel-i burdened the box-otlice cashboz.
The show was voted a great 'success, and
the misses heroines, and the father of
Miss Sandy brought them down to hand
the money over to the Mayor.
Added to $74 additional. from the Police
Department tub contribution made. $76
sent to the treasurer of the boulevard fund
from the Mayor's office yesterday.
Wort has been pushed bo resolutely,
and such good use made of the funds
subscribed for the relief of the unem
ployed, that the construction committee
in charge of the work declares that Bal
boa boulevard will be open for driving as
far as Trocadero by Sunday.^, â¢--.-.
This declaration is made in face of the
fact that there is a great deal of work to
be done yet before the desired consum
mation maybe reached.
The forty-foot cut through the sandy
ravine is the chief trouble in the way.
Macadamizing is being pushed rapidly in
line with the completion of the grade.
The 290-foot culvert in Trocadero can
yon is completed and reported to be a
thoroughly substantial piece of work,
much more so than was at first contem
plated. Between 40.000 and 50,000 feet of
lumber were donated for the culvert, but
it was found necessary to purchase as
much more. - X V'
Subscriptions are still in demand for
keepitis the men at work and for com
pleting the undertaking.
There were reported in the fund yester
day $6400. The Emporium yesterday sub
scribed $100; John W. Ferris, $20; em

To the Editor of The Call: In answer to
an article appearing fn the Oakland En

interview with gentlemen connected with

say that no proposition was ever made by

Furthermore, no negotiations between

QUEEN VICTORIA.
One of the Secrets of Her Long L'fe and
'_',"'â¢'â¢ ' Vitality. â¢> Pj-}/.yV-
Ladies who suffer from poor health may
gain valuable information by reading of
the astonishing discovery, recently made
by the London World.
This journal has lately been investigat-
ing the cause of Queen Victoria's wonder-
ful health and. strength, and has discov-
ered that it is due to. the fact that she
drinks whisky diluted with water. She
does this by the advice of the court phys-
icians. The whisky she drinks is obtained
from a private distillery and is, of course,
perfectly pure.
The facts above given prove two things:
first, that medical men universally recog-
nize that pure whisky sustains the health
and prolongs life; and second, that in
order to do good, the whisky must be
absolutely pure. The leading American
physicians have always indorsed these
views. It is on this account that they have
so strongly recommended Daffy's pure
malt whisky to people whose systems
need to be strengthened and built up.
This is because it is the only medicinally
pure whisky produced in America, and in
this respect it is totally unlike all others.
So true is this that while many temper-
ance people denounce whiskies in gen-
eral, they acknowledge the superior merit
of Daffy's pure malt. There are, however,
many inferior imitations sold by deal-
ers and, when purchasing, care should
therefore be taken to see that none of
these is substituted.

MA ANGELINE AND
DORA DEANE
Two Melodies as Like as
Two Peas in a
Pod.
Two Colored Men of the Same
Shade Calling Each Other
Plagiarists.
Forty-Nine Mining Camp of the Mid
winter Fair Comes to the Front
for Recognition. â¢
"Who is the composer of 'Ma Ange
line'?" is the question now occupying the
attention of United States Commissioner
Heacock. .â v^.
Two colored men lay claim to the honor,
Charles Sydney Smith and Bert Williams.
Williams says that he composed "Dora
Deane," and the musicians say that the
melody of "Ma Angeline" is identical
with it.
James H. Love, formerly connected with
the '49 Mining Camp at the Midwinter Fair,
made affidavit that he beard "Ma Ange
line" sung in the camp a year so before
Williams composed "Dora Deane."
Broder & Schlam recently asked United
States Circuit Judge McKenna for an in
junction restraining * the Zeno ' Mauvais
music-store from selling "Ma Angeline,"
on the ground that it was an infringe
ment on the copyright of "Dora Deane."
Tbe matter was referred to Commissioner
Heacock to take testimony, and the pro
ceedings began yesterday.
Pierre Duryee, advertising agent and
secretary of the '49 Mining Camp at the
Midwinter Fair in this City, testified that
he heard the song for the first time about
Christmas, 1895, and it was at the Orphenm.
It would have been impossible for that
song to have been sung in any part of the
camp without his having known it-
Eugene Hahn, journalist, formerly one
of the proprietor!* of the camp, said that
he never heard "Ma Angeline sung there
by Charles Sydney O'Brien or by any one
else, and did not know of any colored
man being on toe payroll.
Phil Hasting-* corroborated . the testi
mony of the other witnesses to the effect
that be never heard "Ma Angeline" sung
at the camp.
"I have a very good ear for music," re
marked Mr. Hasting-* with a harmonic
chromatic smile, "and il it had been sung
there, I would have remembered it."
J. Williamson, colored, of ICO. Clay
street, was called to tell what he knew of
a song composed by Bert Williams. He
â¢â aid that Williams came to his house and
"ran over" a tune on the piano. It was a
song without a name. Williams said that
he was at work composing a song, and that
it was going to be the "hottest thing out."
Then he said he had to go home to work
on his song.
Peter Diaz, musician, of 7 Bernard
street, was piano-player for the St. Ber
nard dog show, and enlivened the spirits
of the dogs and the visitors -with Wag
nerian and other selection", but "Ma An
geline" and "Dora Deane" were not
nmoiiH them, and tbe big dogs were not
treated to that bit 01 delightful melody.
If "Ma Angeline" had been born at that
time he would have made it a part of bis
repertoire, because he was on the lookout
for new dance music, "Ma Angeline" be
ing of that order.
Thomas W. Flanagan, the barkeeper at
the Midway Plaisance, on Market street,
told how Bert Williams (colored) had
been working at the composition of "Dora
Deane" on the piano next the bar every
night for two or three months until it was
finished, which was about August, 1895.
Willia ms then sang it on the stage every
night, and the attaches took up the chorus
in order to make it interesting for the
guests. Charles Sydney O'Brien used to
come in and out while the song was being
sung, and about a year ago be sang "Ma
Angeline" there. The witne-s at once
recognized the similarity between the
two melodies.; _.; 1
An affidavit from Marcus Blum was
read to the effect that there was no "Ma
Angeline" at the Midwinter Fair.
Maurice Earl of 66_}_ Minna street, mu
sician, heard Charles Sydney O'Brien
singing in the Coney Island luncn place
at the Midwinter Fair, but never heard
him sing anything resembling "Ma An
geline." Never heard O'Brien sing a song
in that tempo. Witness was a drummer.
Alfred Roncovieri, bandmaster, did not
meet "Ma Angeline" till some time after
the close of the fair.
The taking of testimony will be contin
ued on April 26 at 10:30 A. m.
WAS IT A CONSPIRACY?
Startling Testimony in a Civil Case in
Justice Groezioger'i Court.
Some very peculiar testimony was given
in a case that was decided by Justice of
the Peace Groezinger Wednesday.
John Fredericks and his wife sued At
torney J. J. Stevens for the return of
money paid him to do certain work which
he failed to perform. It developed that
Fredericks was working for Dr. C. C.
O'Donnell on the physician's Glen Ellen
property and that he was arrested for bat
tery and locked up. O'Donnell was heav
ily indebted to him.
Stevens is a brother-in-law oi O'Donnell
and was sent for to get Fredericks out of
his scrape. While he was on his way
there Fredericks gained bis liberty, and
went to .Vallejo, where he was again taken
into custody. According to Mrs. Freder
icks Stevens asked and received $60 addi
tional to go to Vallejo and look after his
interests. Mrs. Fredericks says that
Stevens not only did not get her husband
out of jail, but tnat he entered into a con
spiracy with others to frighten him into
leaving the State.
She says that he was told that he bad
committed perjury and that he was pretty
certain of getting fourteen years in prison.
They induced him, she said, to cut off his
mustache, shave his bead- and go East
and into hiding there under an assumed
name.
Later she found that he was in no danger
of San Quentin and brought bim back.
Mr. Fredericks . testified .likewise, and
Stevens denied the story from beginning
to end. He said that he had earned the
fee nail him and that he never knew why
Frederick- went East.
It was' brought out that Fredericks had
obtained a judgment in the Superior Court
for the amount due from O'Donnell at the
time he left the State and that the owner
of the house where he had bee*i shorn of
bis mustache; and; hair was also a relative
by marriage of Dr. O'Donnell.
Justice Groezinger thought that the ser
vices performed were not worth $60 and
gave judgment accordingly.':
WINEMAKEBS Iff . LITIGATION.
Dowdell & Son Have Sued for 950,000
Damage* From C. Carpyetai.
Another suit growing out of the wine
makers'disputes was filed. in the County
Clerk's office Wednesday. The interests in
volved are extensive, and the result of the
litigation will be carefully watched for by
wine-growers throughout the State.'
The suit is entitled James Dowdell and
Arthur Dowdell, bis son, against Charles
Carpy, Owen Wftda. J. H. Wheeler," the
California Wine Association and the Cali
fornia Winemakers'- Corporation. . Dow
dell & Son charge conspiracy on the part
of the defendants, which resulted in the
financial ruin of the plaintiffs.
It is alleged in the complaint that Dow
dell & Son owned 450.000 gallons of wine,
the product of 1894, which was mortgaged
to the Bank of St Helena for $27,500; that
the owners, with the consent of Mr. Wade,
cashier of the St. Helena Bank, negotiated
with F. Chevalier & Co. for the sale of the
mortgaged wine; that the consummation
of this sale was prevented by tne fact that
the Bank of St. Helena pressed the claim
for foreclosure of the mortgage. This

SWINDLED BY TOUTS.
A Beer-Bottler, Who Entered Into a
Scheme to Beat the Poolrooms,
Loses His Money.
James H. Hall, a beer-bottler on Twenty
second street, applied for a warrant from
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Drury of
Judge Joachim-en's court yesterday for
the arrest of two touts at tbe Oakland
racetrack. He did not know their names,
but could identify them.
His story was that he met the two touts
at the racetrack, and Tuesday night he
was surprised to receive a visit from them
at his house. They suggested that he
should join them in a scheme to win
money from tne poolrooms.
If Hall would advance $150 one of them
would accompany him to the racetrack
and the other would remain in the City.
Immediately after a race was run they
could tolephone to the one in the City the
name ot the winning horse so that be
could lay the money on the winner in the
poolrooms before the news was received
there.
Hall advanced tbe $150 and Wednesday
the programme was earned out, the
race selected being the Emeryville handi
cap. vVben Hall and the tout returned to
the City they met the other tout and be
said he had laid all the money on Cash
Day and he was surprised to find thatCali
lornia had won. He had mistaken the
name telephoned.
Hall concluded that be had been swin
dled out of the $150 and wanted to get a
warrant for tbe arrest of tbe touts. He
was informed that the whole affair was
illegal and he bad no remedy.
GOOD POSTAL SERVICE.
San Francisco Holds Her Own With the
Great Cities of the United State..
Thomas J. Ford, superintendent of
mails, arrived from a visit to the East yes
terday and speaks in glowing terms of the
efficiency of the postal service at this port
in comparison with the service at other
places of equal or greater population.
Mr. Ford was detailed by the Govern
ment to investigate the system of collect
ing and distributing mails in Eastern
cities, and starting March 12 visited
Washington, New York, Brooklyn, Chi
cago, Providence, St. Louis and Cincin
nati. He found as the result of tils inves
tigations that the methods in the postal
service here are lully up to, and even
ahead of, those in the majority of the
cities. He found New York to have a bet
ter equipped sy-tem than any of the other
cities because of the vast quantity of mail
handled and business done there. Mail is
collected in that city twenty-six times a
day in the business part of tbe town. In
San Francisco mail is collected nineteen
times daily in similar localities.
The result of the trip is that the super
intendent is convinced that the depart
ment at San Francisco has had the proper
idea in giving the collection system chief
importance.
ARE FOUR BRAKES ENOUGH
Interesting Question About Elec
tric-Car Traffic in Judge
Bahrs' Court.
May Have S.m? Bearing With the
Jury in Deciding E. L. Levey's
Dam-g- Suit.
In the suit of Edward L Levey against
tbe Market-street Railway Company, be
fore Judge Bahrs and a jury yesterday,
tbe most interesting question involved
was the matter of brakes for the cars on
Mission street.
During the trial it was developed that
the car which struck Mr. Levey had only
four brakes, whereas it is deemed neces
sary to hare eight brakes on electric-cars
in all parts of tbe country. ;
S. M. Shortridge, attorney for tbe plain
tiff, who claims $50,000 damages for in
juries received in a collision, sought to
prove by witnesses that it was deemed
unsafe by railroad man to run a car with
less than eight brakes.
Attorney Charles L. Ackerman, repre
senting the defendant corporation, ob
jected, and claimed that the ordinary rule
did not bind his client to supply its cars
with the very best appliances in the world,
but that it is only required that reason
able caution and care be taken in provid
ing for the public safety, v
Judge Bahrs sustained Mr. Ackerman'-.
view of the case and shut off inquiry ln
regard to the general opinion of railroad
man touching the question of the suffi
ciency of four grates to a car in the electric
service.
William A. Clark, an electrician em
ployed hy the Market-street Railway Com
pany, testified that he was on the car and
saw the accident. He said he heard the
bell ring and that warnings were given to
Mr. Levey.
Edward Walsh, another employe, testi
fied ti.at he was working on Mission street
twenty or thirty ; - feet from Fourteenth
when the car struck Mr. Levey's wagon
and threw him to the stone pavement.
He said he beard the bell ring, and after
the accident he helped to pick up the
injured man.
William J. Jackson, motorman, testified
that be had char, c of ihe car at the time
of the accident to Mr. Levey. He said he
was ringing the bell all around the curve.
When within thirty feet of Erie street he
began to put down brakes preparatory to
crossing the switch; that he rang the bell
and, yelled for the man in the wagon to
look out. The next thing he knew the
car struck the wagon and the man was
hurled to the basalt blocks on the street.
He saw the man fall and rushed to bis
assistance. There were lour brakes on
his car. On some other cars there are
eight Drakes.
Judge Bahrs agreed to permit the
jurors -to visit the scene of the accident
on Mission street, near the old Wood
ward's Gardens, at 1 o'clock this after
noon. -The case will subsequently be ar
gued and will -o to the jury some time
this evening.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1897.
PARENTS FEW AND
BABIES MANY
The Home- Finding Society
Has a Surplus on
Hand.
This Is the First Time the
Tots Have Exceeded the
Demand.
Rev. H. W. Brayton Is Out 'in Search
of Homes for His Tiny
Charges.
Do you want a baby?
If you do the Home-finding Society of
California can accommodate you, for it
has a surplus of twenty little tots on hand
who are crying for homes and mammas.
This is rather an unusual state of affairs
for the society. It is really the first time
since the good people who support : it de
cided to incorporate as a life-saving organ
ization that they have found it incumbent
upon them to go out in search of foster-par
ents for their tiny charges. Heretofore the
surplus has been just the reverse â a sur
plus of applications for opportunities to
offer homes to little ones. Babies did not
come in fast enough to supply the,demand.
But the hard times have bad tbeir
effect. Parents who have found them
selves unable to secure employment
have been compelled to go to the super
intendent of the Home-finding Society
and beg him to take their little ones and
give them over to kind-hearted people
who would promise to raise and educate
them. There have been sad and heart
rending scenes, but they were necessary.
Then, too, there has been an unaccount
able increase of foundlines, and many of
these have fallen into the bands of the
society.
"We have found it necessary to go in
search of homes for;our little ones really
for the first time since we have been pur
suing our charitable work," said Rev. H.
W. Brayton yesterday. Dr. Bray ton is the
State superintendent of the society. "Our
theory is that homes with respectable
families are the only place to put the un
fortunate tots," be continued. "We do
not believe in attempting to raise them in
institutions. The latter are practically
prisons and the babies never thrive there.
Why, do you know, the mortality rate of
children under three years of age in found
ling asylum* is 97 per cent. Professor
Warner gives about these figures in his
book on charities. It is something awful
to consider. It is to offset this tbat we
organized, and tbat we are now out search
in? for homes for the babies.
"In order, to carry on our work we have
adopted the temporary home theory. The
temporary, home is an absolute necessity
in our work. * We hope some day to see
not only one but several of these located
in various important parts of the State.
They need not be pretentious â an ordin
ary dwelling suffices. We believe there
are people who, if they understood what
we are doing, would willingly donate the
use of houses and lots to the society.
These, homes will be presided over by
district superintendents and will be their
homes as well, so that tbey may come into
loving, vital contact with the children
and thus better adapt them to their per
manent, homes. One such temporary
ice has been planned for Berkeley,
where a lot ha? been donated for the pur
pose and some material already promised.
We provide for our children in the mean
time, temporarily, in existing institutions
or by boarding in private families.
"Our surplus of babies at present is of
such magnitude that we are all out in the
roles of home-searchers. Do you know of
anybody who wants a baby? If you do
ju-t tell them to call at my office ln the
Mills building."

REV. DR. HEMPHILL
UPHOLDS FEASTS
Remarks of the Learned
Divine on the Late
v Discussion.
Like Rev. Mr. Mathena, Hew
ever, He Thinks This an
Inopportune Time.
All a Mist'ke, Anyway, He States,
, so Fir as a Presbyterial Dis
cussion Is Concerned.
An interesting question was sprung by
Rev. Â£. Q. Mathena at a meeting of the
San Francisco Presbytery a few days ago.
In declining to attend a banquet at the
Occidental Hotel on the ground that a
minister ought not to set such an ex
ample in times of distress be has started
the wider question whether ministers
ought ever to attend banquets.
Mr. Mathena holds, above ail, that it is
not proper for ministers to feast when
there are hundreds of men clamoring for
an opportunity to do the most menial
labor to obtain bread for their wives and
babes.
Rev." Mr. Mathena is known as "the
friend of the poor of the Potrero." He
gave expression to his sentiments in
modest language, and some opposing dis
cussion occurred.
The question came to be discussed by
Rev. Mr. Reynolds rising and asking
those present to do all in their power to
aid the banquet to be held at the Occi
dental Hotel in honor of the graduation
of the senior pupils of the Presbyterian
Theological Seminary by attending.
Then it was that Mr. Mathena deliv
ered himself of the ideas which drew out
the opposition of Rev. H. N. Bevier, who
accused him of "breaking the sweet har
mony of the meeting by speaking of un
pleasant things.". Dr. Mathena said :
"We are asked to go to this banquet at
the Occidental Hotel," be said, modestly,
"but it costs $3 if we take our wives. I
confess that such a use of money seems
to me wrong, in these times of want and
suffering among our fellow-creatures. It
is embarrassing for me to thus decline
the invitation or to appear to be out of
joint with the times; out my work lies
among the very poor, among those to
whom a dollar is of great importance. It
is a matter of conscience with me, and I
cannot consent to spend $3 in this way
when tbe poor are coming to my door for
food, when little children are hungry and
ill clad, and wnen honest men are out of
employment and their families in want.
"With the small sum of $3 I could do
great good in the way of charity, or 1
might get ten children into my Sunday
school. Ido not think it is proper for
ministers of the gospel to set such an ex
ample as this would be. My conscience,
therefore, compels me to decline the invi
tation, although friends have offered to
pay for the plates for my wife and my
self."
Rev. John Hemphill, D.D., now acts as
a compromise in the matter. He says it
was all a mistake, and, therefoie, ought
to be dropped.
"In tne first place," said Dr. Hemphill,
"it was not a presbyterial discussion
proper. Moderator Jen ks wa-* out of the
room on committee work, and Dr. Doane
was serving in his place. Business mat
ters grew slack and an informal discussion
of the subject arose.
"So far a.Â« banquets are. concerned, I

I That's why we
sell so cheap;
. Good reason ?J
know that they have been very beneficial
to our churcn in other cities, such as New
York and Philadelphia. They . have a
Presbyterian union in each one of these
cities, and it is the custom to give ban
quets at more or less frequent intervals
during the winter months, at which lead
ing speakers are invited to address them
on theological, social and economic ques
tions, and these social reunions have been
most beneficial to our demonination in
the way of social uplifting and also in the
matter of raising money for church ex
penses.
"So that, on general principles, I am
heartily in favor of modest banquets in
church circles. Then comes in the ques
tion of the present hard times ana the
number of unemployed.
"Personally, if 1 bad not money enough
to go around, I think I should be living
up to the spirit of the good Samaritan in
giving my dollar to the unemployed fund
rather than to the banquet.
"I think our duty first of all is to the
suffering poor. 'The poor ye have always
with you,' said the Master, and lam sure
that we have the Master's spirit when we
assist the poor."
Rev. James Woodworth, in response to
a question as to his views ou the matter,
furnishes the following:
"Good feed and good fellowship are
closely associated, the first beinz greatly
promotive of the other, and as I am very
fond of both, if 1 could afford it, I should
certainly attend the banquet, not only for
the festal, but also for the social and in

A salesman in a hide and leather house in Denver, Col., |
in an interview, said : " I have used a great many boxes of
RIPANS TABULES
and I have received much benefit from them. Before I
used them I was severely troubled with indigestion,
dyspepsia and headache, and although I tried many
different kinds of medicines I have not come across any-
thing which gives the relief that Ripans Tabules do. As
; they say in I their advertisement, I found that one gave
relief. I now use them right along and do not let a chance
slip to speak of their merits."

tellectual enjoyment which I know it will
afford. As a means, however, for benefit
ing the cause of religion or promoting the
irttere***s of the theological seminary. I
cannot see how it is to accomplish more
than a minimum of good. The company
present will -be a select one, limited in
number and composed of those already
deeply interested in the seminary, and as
the published reports of the proceedings
will naturally have reference chiefly to the
banquet and the spicy things culled from
the speeches to follow, the public will get
but little concerning Ihe seminary by read
ing them.
"Besides, as the quarter centennial ex
ercises proper of the institution will take
place in the afternoon of the same day
the space given to them will of course be
limited, in order to leave room for the
more readable reports of those to occur in
the evening.^.
"In my judgment it would have been
better to provide for a single meeting,
consisting of a general gathering of the
friends of the seminary, with a supper to
cost 25 cents per plate, to be followed by
reports and statements and addresses
showing the character and needs of the
work, much like the annual reunions of
the Church Extension Society of the
Methodist, people, which are so effective
in producing denned results. However,
as the feast has been contracted ior and
the palates of the brethren are doubtless
already prepared for it, I say, with all my
heart, let it proceed and 'let joy be un
conlined' with all who shall have the
good fortune to participate in it."JUST ABOUT TWO
FAVORITES SCORED
A Day's Sport at Emery
ville That Suited the
Books.
lagleside Fell in the Opening
Event and Broke a
Leg.
May R a' 20 to i Downed the Favorit?,
Alvaradoâ Major Cook First, With
15 to I About Rim in the Ring.
A novice around the corner might have
picked the card at Emeryville yesterday,
but tbe regulars found it like taking soup
with Chinese chopsticks. Two favorites
won, but they had to; they were prohit
ive favorites in the betting end the races
were modeled to suit their respective
abilities. The attendance was good and
the individual donations kept the book
makers in good humor.
/.eke Abrahams now signs his name
with a minus sign affixed. He furnished
Ingleside the second choice for the open
ing six-furlong battle, and all he got back
was the saddle trappings and Brown,
the jockey, who by the way was in a sadly
demoralized state.
At the far turn Brown saw three inches
of daylight separating two horses and took
a chance of getting through. The gap
was suddenly closed and Brown and Ingle
side rolled in the dust. The colored lad
was short of atmosphere for several min
utes and Ingleside broke a leg and bad to
be destroyed.
Billy Ayres, an 8 to 1 shot, won the race,
with .Popinjay, at 100 to 1, second.
Parthamax, the Burns <fe Water house
entry, was a 2 to 5 chance for the second
event over a mile, and leading throughout
the Maxim coll led the entire journey,
winning cleverly from Russella, the sec
ond choice. Sly was a good third.
Tempestuous started for the first time in
the colors of the Fleur de Lis stable, and
was the post favorite for the six-furlong
selling affair next decided. He was back
in the ruck the first part, but came on in
time to finish second, beaten two lengths
by Charlemagne, asto 1 shot. Roltatre,
the second choice, made the running into
the stretch.
Miss Rowena lay all over the others in
the four-furlong scramble for two-year
olds, and won with consummate ease from
Barney Schreiber, going over to the gate
an 11 to 20 favorite. flushington, at odds
of 12 to 1, beat Hermoso out for the show.
The stable and intimate connections
got their checks down good and hard on
Alvarado to win the mile selling run, but
the clatter of hoofs at his heels all the
ay was distasteful, and he . became
afflicted with heart failure toward the
close. This bad acting son of Amigo was
a7to 10 chance in the betting. Among
the starters was May R with 77 pounds,
nnd Midget Johnny Woods in the saddle.
Tbe three-quarter section of a jockey
hustled the mare along, and gradually
pulling up on equal terms with Alvarado
at the paddock led him out a head at
the wire in 1:42. San Marco was third.
Dunboy, with "Jockey Bill" Manin at
the helm, was a 9 to 5 favorite for tho final
5J.x--u.nong dash. There were several fast
sprinters among the field and they made
Dunboy's head spin before he reached the
wire. After Reiugee and Jim Bozeman
had set a terrific clip well into the stretch,
Coady, astride the 15 to 1 shot Major
Cook, pulled out of the bunch and won
handily from Mobalaska, against which 8
to 1 was laid. Dunboy took show honors.

poor showing made by St. Distaff. Sam
said that last time out the boy hustled the
horse out in front; and he died away at the
finlah. Yesterday Shields was instructed
to make his run in the stretch, but the
horse had no speed. '
The run of Hermoso did not suit the
judges, and Jones was questioned about
it. He said the colt wanted to run out at
the bead of * the stretch,' and that proved
satisfactory. s , Â§fÃ9P
It is to be regretted the officials did not
question Man ty Bergen as to why be began
taking Taranto : back' three furlongs from
home. If these jockeys with a bank roll
can do as they like it is about time the

drafted some new rules that can't be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1897.
SINGLE-TAXERS
ARE CAMPAIGNING
Already Begin Work in the
Field for a New Con
stitution. *
Opened Headquarters With Ralph
E Hoyt, State Organ iz.r,
in Charge.
The Elections. Next Fall Give Indica
tions of Being Lively for
Several Reasons.
The Single-Tax Society of this City has
determined to be an active factor in the
campaign for a new constitution. To the
workers of that society, and more especially
to its treasurer, James S. Reynolds, is

RALPH HOYT, Stale Organizer of the Single-Tax Campaign
Already Inaugurated for a New Const-tut_Dh.
to the people. The society has now opened
headquarters at room 614 Sprectels build
ing, and proposes to keep up active opera
tions until election day, in November
next.
Hon. Ralph E. Hoyt has been placed in
charge of the headquarters for the time
being. He will be the general organizer
of the single-tax campaign, and will travel
over tbe State lecturing and forming clubs.
"We proroso to plainly state our reasons
for favoring a new constitution," said Mr.
Hoyt yesterday. "They are that we de
sire all revenues to be raised from a tax
on land values and would so have the new
constitution provide. \Ve shall keep up a
lively campaign cf education through the
campaign. We are aware that thÂ»re is a
very general feeling of discontent with
the prevailing system of taxation in the
State. It shows itself at every turn, and
we shall take pains to point the one
rational way out of the trouble. This dis
content shows itself in the many different
attempts to find relief in amendine the
revenue provisions in the constitution.
There were no less than seventy amend
ments to the constitution offered durinc
the last session of the Legislature, and of
these thirty were directed at the revenue
or taxation clause. _B9fi3H_.SK
"There is no doubt that the movement
in behalf of a new constitution will grow
more and more popular as time passes
and tbe character of the clumsy instru
ment that now serves as the fundamental
law of tbe State is mode clear to them. As
Senator Bulla says in a communication
addressed to me at Los Angeles, the ease
.with which the Supreme Court finds ex
cellent reasons 'or declaring unconstitu
tional very excellent laws whenever ihey
are appealed to seems to show tnat there
is something radically wrong with the
constitution, anyhow. It is a lot of con
fusing and hampering legislation, born of
tbe sand-lot agitation, and this State
should eagerly avail: itself of an oppor
tunity to frame a new one that shall lay
down some broad principles, and under
which the business of the State may be
allowed to expand.'
"This coming election will be a very im
portant- one. It. will be â necessary not
only to determine in favor of the constitu
tional, convention, but -we will have to
elect a Legislature that will make proper
provision for calling the convention. Th**
movement for a new constitution, espe
cially from the single-tax point of view, is
entirely non-partisan. Here the most ar
dent .Democrats, Republicans and Popu
lists may join hands."
Senator Bulla introduced the concurrent
resolution that resulted in submitting ibis
question to the people of the State. In a
recent letter to Mr. Hoyt concerning it he
said:
The resolution calls for a convention of
eignty members, one from each Assembly dis
trict, with the same compensation and qualifi
cations as members of the Legislature. The
former Constitutional Convention was com
posed of 120 members, but my idea in the
preparation of the resolution was that a body
of eighty men * could be ;as safely entrusted
with the interest- ot the people as one com
posed of a larger rnembersnip, and that their
iterations would require less lime and be
much less expensive â¢ for . Â» the , people <of
the State, -Â li. the . - resolution be adopted
by a majority of those voting -at the
next .' : general election it shall â â¢* be the
duty ol ihe Governor to forthwith Issue his
proclamation announcing the fact that such
convention has been called, and it shall there
upon be the auty of the next session of the
Legislature (in 1899) to provide by law for the
election of delegates to such convention and
for the holding thereof at the State capitol. .
The . convention must ; then -meet , within
three months. from the time of the election
of the delegates and continue In session until
its work of revision is completed. â â : Upon < the
completion of the â¢ revision a special election
must be held for the adoption or rejection of
the proposed, new constitution. The returns
of such election must be examined by the
Governor, Controller, Treasurer and Secretary
of State, and if 'the constitution is found to be
ratified the Governor Milt issue his reel am a
tlon declaring such constitution so ratified * to
be the constitution of the State.
It will thus be seen that it i* within the
bound- of possibility to secure for this Slate a
new constitution before the beginning of the
next century, and in my humble judgment
the people of this State could render them
selves no better service than - by calling such
convention and ; adopting : the result - of its
labors, providing the same shall be in accord
ance with the sentiment of the people of the
Stale at that time.
It is almost universally conceded that our
present constitution is unsatisfactory and that
the same should De revised. A constitution
should be a simple declaration of fundamental
principles of law. whereas our constitution Is
so incumbered with details as to be in effect a
statutory provision rendering it almost im
possible to enact laws thereunder whicn shall
not in some particular conflict therewith. In
some countries there is no written constitu
tion, and in view of the ease with which the
Supreme Court of our State decrees the uncon
stitutionality of desirable statutes enacted by
our Legislature I have sometimes thought that
it would be greatly to our advantage If we
also were without an unchangeable document
declaratory of our tundamental law.
The plain duty, then, of all persons who
favor constitutional amendments in our State,
whether in the matter of tax reform or upon
other subjects, is. to bend every energy to se
cure the majority of the votes at the next elec
tion ln favor of calling the constitutional con
vention, and as the people of this State are
progressive, intelligent and thoughtful 1 have
no doubt that two years from now they will
vote ln favor of such convention and in pur
suance thereof will elect men of sound judg
ment and progressive Ideas who will assume
the duties of delegates to that convention In a
spirit of earnest desire 'to so amend our or
ganic law as to abolish the numerous evils
which exist thereunder.
Speaking of the spread of the single
tax doctrine in the State Mr. Hoy t said:
"The single tax finds favor wherever it
comes *to be understood. -We really had
no opposition in the Legislature to the
single-tax amendment, so called, among
tbe small farmers of the State. The men
who beat that amendment wers large
land-owners in the city and the big
farmers, thoÂ«e who farm the farmers. I
have no doubt what the people at large
will say about it when they bave their
turn."
A public meeting win be held under the
auspices of the Single-Tax Soci ty at Py
thian Castle, 009 Market street, Sunday
evening, at which well-knowu speakers
will expound the doctrine.

JUROR SIMON WAS
A TRIFLE SCARED
Refused to Agree to Verdict
in the Turner
Case.
Accused of Fraternizing With
the Adherents of the De
fendant. _'/-
Judge Wa'lace Will Hear Deputy Dis
trict Attorney. Black's Motion to
Punish for Contempt of Court.
There was a sensation in Judge Wal
lace's court yesterday morning when the
jury in the case of J. F. Turner filed into
the jury-box and Foreman H. W. Hyraan
announced that there was no chance of
an agreement because one member of the
jury â afterward ascertained to be Isador
Simon would not listen to reason and
refused to discuss the testimony or the
law involved in the case.
Judge. Wallace smiled grimly, and in
bis usual courtly manner suggested that
the trial had occupied three weeks at great
expense to the people of the community.
He would be pleased to respond to any re
quest the jurors might make for further
information if there appeared to be a pos
sibility of an agreement. *â¢*-
Mr. Hyman thought there was no use
asking them to remain longer; that the
jury stood from first to last 11 to 1, and
that tne man who stood out had told the
others that he did not intend to agree to a
verdict.
Following are the names of the jurors:
John A. Apper*>on, Victor Andler, George
Snvder. J. G. Hecker, Rudolph H. Hahn,
H. W. Swasey, E. O. Tuttle, William A.
Hewitt. George R. Richmond, Isador Si
mon, Henry Rosenfeld and Henry W.
man.
After Clerk: Salomon had called the roll,
Judge Wallace looked thoughtful for a
moment and said he would like to bear
what counsel had to suggest in the
premises.
Deputy strict Attorney Black re
sponded by saying that he was informed
on good authority that a member of the
jury had disobeyed the admonition of the
court: that ne bad fraternized with
Turner's adherents, and that he had sev
eral times during the trial been seen in
consultation with the friends of Defendant
Turner. One of the men with whom the
juror bad associated was surety on
Turner's bond in the case. Mr. Black
promised to present affidavits that would
bring this matter to the attention of the
court in a formal way. a.id wished to see
whether a man who had been guilty of
such acts could not be punished for con
tempt of court.
Judge Wallace said he would listen to
Mr.' Back's application if a proper show
ing were mnde. lie considered it the duty
of every citizen to bear his share of the
burden in administering justice, and
jurors on service in the criminal courts'
must do their duty as required by law. If
they are neglectful or in any way attempt
to shift this responsibility by unlawful
acts they undoubtedly may be punished.
Mr. Black said further tuat fsador Simon
was the juror accused of misconduct, and
thai lie had been seen talking with friends
of Turner, and had been drinking in a
saloon with one of his bondsmen.' He
also spoke to one of the witnesses at the
courtroom door touching the ca_e and
about Turner. BSSbI pISSISS
Simon hastily left the courtroom as soon
as In was released from his position in the
jury-box. He made no attempt to justify
nis position, but sat with his head bowed
and his hand up to his face throughout
the proceedings. He seemed frightened
by the turn of events. "
At this morning's session of the court
Mr. Black will present bis affidavits and
Judge Wallace will ask Simon to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court.
'Judge Wallace ordered Turner into cus
tody and raised his bond from $1000 to
$8000. j â  "

the following reply:
Replying to your letter of the Ist Inst., the
department has to advise you â¢ that ' as â¢ inspec
tors are paid for their services per diem, they
are subject to the performance of official duty
on Sundays and holidays. An officer refusing

As a matter of special consideration, the de

day. . â  - .*;. 7 .-7!_
The inspectors referred to will take out

hitherto received as perquisites. While
their gross receipts will be less they will

unnecessary.

JEFFRIES TO SHARKEY.
Will Fight for the Largest Purse
Offered and a Big Side
Wager.
The Conqueror ol Van Buskirk Debars
"Fitz" and Corb*tt and All Men
of Color.
Tom Sharkey is now journeying in the
direction of the rising sun, accompanied
by that remarkable referee and all-round
sport, Wyatt Earp.
The sailor-pugilist expects to meet the
Irish heavy-weight champion, Peter
Maher, in a contest of twenty rounds be
fore one of the boxing clubs of New York,
and rumor says that Sharkey will insist
that Mr. Earp must act as referee, but it
is presumed that Mr. irp will not accept
the "honorable" position for. reasons that
are best known to himself.
Anyhow Sharkey is traveling eastward,
ostensibly for the purpose of proving to
Peter Maher that he* can hit harder and'
stand more solid punishment than either
Corbett or Fitzsimmons.
The dispatches do not say whether Maher
is really afraid to meet the sailor, or
whether he hsileves in silence as being a
cardinal virtue at this juncture, when loud
talking may be a means of drawing the
wrath of the powers that be on tbe heads
of the boxing club managers who have
made arrangements for the contest.
Sharkey may .whip the Irishman, but
the general opinion of all ring-followers
is that Tom will, run against a game this
time that will surprise him. It can be
said, and without the least fear of contra
diction, that if Maher lands one of his pet
right-band punches on the jaw of the
man wno stood before *'Fitz" and Corbett
the receiver will be afforded an oppor
tunity of feeling the sensation that arises
from a knock-out blow. s
As the * mate i between Maher ' and
Sharkey has not been consummated as
yet, and as there may be many obstacles
thrown in the way of a meeting between
the two heavy-weights, Sharkey can rest
assured of one thing, and that isa passage
at-arms between himself and Jim Jeffries,
the champion heavy-weight of Southern
California, who made short work of Van
Buskirk last Friday evenine.
Jeffries' manager, Tom McDonald, has
authorized the* publication of a challenge
to Sharkey. Mr. McDonald states that if
Sharkey will consent to meet Jeffries in
this City in a contest of from ten to
twenty rounds there will not be any diffi
culty in signing articles of agreement,
provided that the entire purse will go to
the winner and each principal deposit
$5000 as a side stake two weeks bafore tbe
day of the fight. Jeffries' backer states
further that be will not permit his charge
to fight a colored man; ho draws the line
there; but any white man, excepting Cor
bett and Fitzsimrnons, can have a brush
wi*h the new aspirant to bi.h honors, pro
vided that a side wager of $5000 will form
a part of the agreement over the signa
tures of the contestants.

NEW .IOKK MARKETS.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 15.â The stock
market was lifeless a greater part of the day, but
ln. late dealings the selling movement set In, os
feasibly based upon ai vices of a more belligerent
outlook in the La vane The only noteworthy net
uechne was IV_ per cent in Louisville and Nash
ville. - Throughout the remainder of the list net
losses were fractional, averaging barely half
points. Chicago Gas, which was more extensively
dealt in lhan any other stock, was exceptionally
steady and closed fractionally higher, on the In
troduction In the Illinois Legislature of a measure
permitting Chicago gas companies to consolidate
i li.- foreign ir.i : p. statement shows an excess of
exports in merchandise for March over imports
of nearly $11. 000,00*), and for nine months end
ing March 31. an excess of over $323,000,000, as
compared with the corresponding period of the
previous fiscal year.
The selling movement became more general
and most severe in coalers and high-priced In
dustr.as. The bears operated rather confidently
and offered round amounts of -sugar and Chicago
Gas for effect on the general list. The heaviness
of the. London ma: ket was utilized by traders to
create selling ot international shares. Grangers
displayed a stubborn front, but ultimately lost
siicht fractions. Tho sloe* market lapsed into
c- mi-stagnation after 11 o'clock. The fact that
th- Lonsoa Stock Exchange will close to-night
over Easter holiday and the local exchange will
suspend business on Good Friday tended to make
traders cautious- The 'bond mar-el was neg
lected, but generally linn.

Oakland Office San Frakcipco ("all,)
908 Broadway, April 15. J
The Sunday-school children of this city
are looking forward anxiously to the arri
val of the Morning Star. This vessel is
the South Sea missionary ship which is
supported by contributions of Sunday
school pupils all over the State. The
largest portion of the subscriptions from
this coast come from this city, and her
commander, Captain Isaiah Bray, also
hails from here, and this accounts for the
great local Interest.
The Morning Star left here about a year
\ go, and since that time has made a com
-1 plete trip among the islands of the Pacific.
Captain Isaiah Bray, formerly secretary of
tie Y. M. C. A. of this city, is her present
commander and sails under the flag of the
Congregational Board of Foreign Mis- j
sions. Charles S. Lewis, now sexton of
the First Congregational Church, was for
many years chief engineer of the mission
ary ship, and it Is very probable that he
Will again go to sea on the next voyage.
The present vessel is the fourth Morn
ing Star that has been built since 1866,
the year when the scheme of keep
ing a missionary vessel afloat in the Pa
cine was made a reality. The first one
was a schooner launched in Boston. After
doing missionary duty for awhile she was
sold in Honolulu, rechristened the Julia,
sailed for China and was never heard of
again. Morning Star 2 was also a Boston
â schooner, and was wrecked on the Kusaie
.Reef. Five years later her successor, also
a 80-ton vessel, was destroyed on the
same reef. The present Morning Star is a
steam barkentine which came to this
coast from Maine in 1891, and has since
that time made very successful annual
trips.
It costs nearly $20,000 a year to keep
this vessel running, and this amount is
entirely made up from pennies and nickels
from Sunday-school children all over the
country. The vessel now needs a thorough
overhauling, and she will be brought to
Oakland and be repaired on this side the
bay.
Tired or His Housekeeper.
OAKLAND, Cal., April Frederick
Edwards, an old man living in East Oak
land, has asked the authorities to rid him
of a housekeeper. The lady has lived with
Edwards many years, and when she was
young and blooming Edwards was very
fond of her. She established herself at his
home and kept house for him and his two
children by a former wire. She has
(worked hard daring all these years, and
laccording to all accounts has been a faith-
lul woman. On some occasions she has
.'tone working by the day to help sup
port the family. Edwards now is quite
well to do and owns three or four bouses,
ana is frightened that if he dies before his
housekeeper she will put in a claim to his
estate. -J: .-'â¢V-

OAKLAND, Cal., April 15.â Another

equal division. Furthermore, no negotia
tions whatever between the two com
panies are now pending upon any subject."

property is transferred to A. 8. McDonald
of Oakland, who recently put on record at
Martinez all the deeds to the [ property at
Point Richmond. The property consists
of 155 acres, and its purchase probably in

Following this the whole of the San
Pablo cable road will be fitted with elec
tric apparatus, and ultimately C. P.
Huntington's plan of using electricity on
all the local ferry lines will be carried out.
Part of the proposed plan is to erect an
enormous power-house at the mole, which
shall supply all the power required for
the machine-shops, the electric roads and
for illuminating purposes of the Southern
Pacific. This, it is stated, is the result of
President Huntington's visit here last

THE DOVE HAS FLOWN.
Pastor I.eveau and Deacon Nylander
Bars Grievance.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 15.â There is no
longer harmony in the Swedish Lutheran
Church. A large portion of the congrega
tion want the pastor, Itev. A. M. Leveau.
to resign, and he declares his intention of
continuing as their minister.
At the last meeting of the congregation
Deacon Nylanaer made a statement in
which he said that the minister was al
together too overbearing and narrow*
minded. '-
Rev. A. M. Leveau says the trouble is
all due to a member of his flock and made
the following statement:
"I do not dosir-* to "ay anything just at
present," said he. "Those accusations
have been made before and all 1 desire to
say now is this, that I am not the slan
derer, but the slandered. Certain people
in the parish who did not pay their bills
were always making trouble. They
wouldn't pay what they owed the church
or fellow members of the church. Now
this is all wrong and 1 preached against
it and tried to show my flock the right
way. Then members of the flock began to
wander away from the fold. They went
away on Sunday picnic-*, joined theatrical
societies and behaved in a way altogether
unbecoming to church members. I
expostulated in vain. I was sneered and
laughed at. Finally my objections grew
so earnest that certain members de
cided to resign, but they still refused
to pay their dues. One man was es
pecially remiss in this respect, and he is
the man who is making the present com
plaints. My dealings with him were con
fined to the time after I was appointed
guardian of the two Anderson children
and their estate. This man â Nylander is
bis nameâ occupied the house belonging
to the estate. He paid no rent and said
he wanted to buy. I went to my lawyer
and he told me to see what securities the
man could give. I investigated and found
he did not pay bis debts. Nylander re
signed his deaconship, wrote a vilely
abusive letter of me and behaved very
badly indeed. The deacons never took
any notice of bis statements. In fact, I
have never been asked to resign, and at
tempts to oust me from the pastorate are
made by outsiders who have forfeited all
consideration within tbe church."
A meeting of the church council will be
held Saturday night, when further devel
opments are expected.
TOO LATE.
A Pension for a Veteran Conies After
He Is Dead and in the
Grave.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 15.â Nearly a
month ago James Cook, an old resident of
this city, died in the Veterans' Home at
Yountville and was buried with honors at
Mountain View. Cook was a veteran of
the Civil War and had been a prisoner at
Andersonville and at Danvers, where his
health became so injured by the priva
tions that he never recovered fully from the
effects. Bui be never applied lor a ten
sion, though,, justly entitled to one, until
quite recently. On the other hand, he
supported himself in various ways until
absolutely unable longer to help himself.
Then at last be asked for the aid which
his services entitled him to, and pending
its being granted he was at last obliged
to se. a refuge at the Veterans' Home,
where, as stated, he died several weeks
ago. The application for a pension took
its usual course, and to-day news came
that it had been granted. But Cook has
gone where he needs no pension and a
"grateful country's" aid is no longer re
quired. *v',- :â : L* ;.'"<"* ''
DEATH PROM TUBERCULOSIS.
A Mother Who Had Not Kissed Her
ildren for a Tear.
ALAMEDA, Cal, April 15.â A sad case
was the death yesterday of Mrs. Isabel
Alice Porter of 1095 Park avenue. About
a year ago her husband, Dr. J. 8. Porter,
died from tuberculosis, and during his ill
ness his wife was a most devoted nurse.
As a result she' too acquired the disease,
and her physicians told her it was only a
question of a few months ere she would
follow her husband. She had four
children, three boys and a girl, the oldest
16 and the youngest 4 years of age.
In order to prevent them from being in
fected with the contagion the physicians
told Mrs. Porter that it would be neces
sary lor her to refrain from kissing them,
as to inhale her breath or touch her lips
would convey the germs of disease. The
mother bravely obeyed the directions, and
for almost a year endured the agony of
not being able to express the affection
which she bore her little ones in the man
ner usual to mothers. Mrs. Porter was
the stepdaughter of W. P. ' BenoiÃt, the
well-known Ban Francisco printer.
POUND DROWNED.
An Unknown Corpse on tho Shores of
Bay Farm Island.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 15.â While N.
P. Hanson was going along the beach at
Bay Farm Island Point to-day he found
the badly decomposed remains of a man
which had been washed up by the tide.
He at once notified Deputy Coroner
Fowler, who went after the remains. The
body had been so long in the water that it
was absolutely unrecognizable. It was
clad in a red sweater, a red flannel under
shirt, striped trousers, and one foot bad a
canvas slipper attached, such as are used
in gymnasiums and bathhouses. There
was nothing in the clothes to give any
clew to the identity of the deceased. He
had probably been of dark complexion, as
a tuft of black hair was still attached to
the skull.

any sensation at all.
Dr. Wythe's testimony was wanted be
cause of a little discovery made a fi-v
DR. J. H. WYTHE,' Who Was Examined Yesterday Regarding
His Visit to the Late Dr. Pardee's Home.
weeks ago while taking the deposition of
the widow. During her testimony the
fact was brought out that during the last j
three months of the doctor's life she culti
vated a habit of making memoranda of
passing events. When asked regarding a
certain conversation she produced her lit
tle notebooks and when once insight
everything in them was included in the
deposition. One afternoon Dr. Wythe
called on the late doctor and when going
away Mrs. Pardee asked him what he
thought of her husband's condition for a
man who had seen so much sickness and
suffered so much pain. According to the
memorandum Dr. Wythe replied; "I find
him tolerably well- -bodily."
This note was evidently taken as sug
gesting that Dr. Wythe 'considered the
late Dr. Pardee as being affected mentally,
and it was for the purpose of getting Dr.
Wythe's testimony on this point that the
deposition was taken this afternoon.
The story of Dr. Wythe was very brief
and did not occupy more than ten min
utes, He sain that on July 14, by invita
tion of Dr. Fisher, he visited Dr. Pardee
and found him in a weak condition and
suffering from several ailments. He said j
that he did not notice anything- wrong
j with Dr. Pardee's mind, and that he
! never saw him afterward. Prior to this
j visit he had never been acquainted with
the doctor except casually, and conse
quently he was not in a position to speak
from experience of the condition of Dr.
Pardee's mind for the few months prior
to his death. . . . . _
In reply to a question by Attorney
Moore Dr. Wythe stated that he did not
remember, having the conversation with
Mrs. Pardee, as stated in her notebook,
nor did he remember ever having any con
versation with Mrs. Pardee at anytime.
â¢ To-morrow afternoon Judge Van R. Pat
erson will take the deposition of Mrs. Vir
ginia Arnold in San Francisco. Mrs. Ar
nold was an old acquaintance of the Par
dees an 1 was intimately acquainted with
them during the close of the doctor's life.
Her testimony is requfredÂ«by Messrs. Reed
and Nusbanmer, attorneys for the widow.
On April 23 the celebrated case will come
to trial. The issues can be briefly staled.
The widow declares that at tho time of
making his will Dr. E. H. Pardee was so
completely under the influence of opiates
and his son, Dr. G. C. Pardee, that he was
not cognizant of ; the disposition he was
making of his property. |He left property
to the widow which be valued at $75,000,
and it is noted as remarkable that this is
the only valuation of property named in
the whole of tbe will.
Its present value is saia to be $45,000.
To his daughter, Nellie, he left two pieces
of property of which she was to obtain
possession when she was 23 years of age.
She died a few months after her father,
and by a clause in the will which pro
vided that should either the widow or
daughter die before the distribution of the
estate by an order of court the daughter's
property went to her nail-brother George,
as matters now stand under the will
George is entitled to about $250,000 and
,{he widow to about $55.000. V
It is very; evident that Dr. Pardee an
ticipated a contest, for in another clause
of the will it is stated that :if : any of the
beneficiaries shall make a contest they
shall forfeit all claim of any nature to the
estate. There is .also ; another "; clause
which shows that a contest was expected.
The decedent provided that any doctor,
attorney, or any professional man who .
had had any dealings with bim during
his life should not be subject to the
statute relating to professional confidence,
but should be at liberty to tell everything
they knew without restraint.
These are the conditions of the contest
which prevail at this time.
THE CONTINENTAL; LEAGUE.
It* Meeting; Taesday Nightâ About the
_.â¢-. New Postoffice. _
iAt the monthly meeting of the Conti
nental League held Tuesday night the com
mittee on constitution and by-laws re*
ported many radical changes for the
future government of the league, which
weie adopted. Among the changes was
one relating to delinquent members. As
the club bad during the last campaign an
enormous list of members, most of whom"
have failed to contribute to its funds, it
was decided to allow a certain time to
elapse in which to come forward and set
tle all delinquencies upon a liberal bisis.
Neither the period nor amount was fixed,
but will be at the next meeting.
Letters were read from Senator Perkins
and Representatives Loud and Maguire
setting forth their views recardinp the
commencement of wo k on the new Post
office building. Senator Perkins said the
matter would receive his earnest ana im
mediate attention. Mr. Loud's opinions
were: : "I am in receipt of resolutions of
your league urging that early action be
taken toward the building of the San
Francisco Postoffice, and in reply will say
that every effort is being made to secure
the accomplishment of your desires.
Mr. Maguire said: ; ;;--
Your letter of the 30 of March~i!T"at
hand. The resolution of the Continental
League which it embodies will be given favor
able attention. .Permit me to say in this con
nection that Senators Perkins and White and
Representative Loud and myself have been
steadily urging the Treasury Department Ito
commence work on the new Postoffice build
ing. The objections that have from time to
time been urged have all been removed ex
cept, the one that the report of the army en
git-ecTs appointed to examine and report upon
the character of the site as a foundation for
the building has not yet Deen filed.
I understand that the engineers are now
rapidly completing their examination, and
with the filing of their report the last reason
for delaying the work of which I have any
knowledge will be removed.
It is contemplated to conduct a series of
meetings for educational purposes, to be
gin at an early date, treating of subjects
of importance to the community. The
first will be an exposition of the new pri
â  mary law, and it is intended to invite the
I Hon. E. I. Wolf for that purpose. At the
next meeting of the league a paper will be
j read upon the subject of civil service and
i a debate will follow upon the question,
"Resolved, That civil service, as exempli
fied in the offices of the United States
Government, is in the main unrepublican
and detrimental to our institutions."
THE ARMY'S NEW SCHEME
Proposition to Form a Slock
Company Where All May
I Hold Shares.
The Wood Camp Is Flourishing.
Room for a Score More Men
There.
Major Will chell of the Salvation Army,
will leave for Santa Rosa to-day to look at
some other lands that have been offered
him for colonization purpose. He says
Santa Rosa is entirely alive to the benefits
likely to accrue from the establishment of
tbe colony near their city. One man
raised $400 to advance the scheme.
The committee of the Chamber of Com
merce, he says, is not giving the plan the
active support it will when the work on
the boulevard is concluded. Then the
committee will concentrate its energies in
the direction of establishing the colony.
It is suggested that the colony be formed
into a stock company, with shares at $1,
which shares may be sold to rich and
poor or to whomever will buy. It is
thought a fund might be raised in this
way sufficient to launch and carry forward
the scheme.
Major Winchell said yesterday the Sal
vation Army wood camp was flourishing
famously.' There are thirty men 1 em
ployed there, some of them cutting a cord
of wood a day. . He says there is room for
twenty more men. provision for whom
will be made if they apply at the camp.
The fare there is 65 cents. They are culti
vating forty acres of land in potatoes
there, besides cutting the timber, by way
of preparing themselves for taking up the
little ranches.

STUDENTS STILL
THROWING STONES
This Time the Military
Department Is Bitterly
Assailed.
The Occident Again Gives Berke
ley College Some. Cause
.or Talk.
The Paper Says the Duty Is Irksome
and tbe Commandant Rather
Despstic.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 15 "With un
abated zeal the student reformers at the
State University fly their vocation. After
tbe interim of but a week they poured
forth to-day another fusillade upon the
government and systems of education at
the institution, taking refuge this time
under the covert of "The Court."
The Occident, which: has been the
medium for delivering the charges upon
the university, was again brought into
use.
Under the soothing caption of "Respect
fully Submitted" appears a caustic
criticism upon the ever unpopular vy.ir
department of the university. The writer
begins by saying: "To those of us who
entertain a wholesome contempt for the
military feature of our university the
present policy of the department is en
couraging." He continues to charge the
enforcement of ."petty and irksome de
tails," and declares ' that the "petty
tyrants" meet with only hostility and
failure, as they' always will. Then the
writer goes on to say:
If any good is ever to be derived from the
military department, the commandant must
first realize the futility of attempting to en
force army methods in dealing with the
students. This fact should need no further
demonstration than the experience of the last
few years. When mutual talr treatment takes
the place of a policy of compulsion results
much more efficient than at present are sure to
be attained. Most of the student-soldiers are
not, like the Court, opposed on principle to all
things military; they can drill well, and when
they choose they do drill well. The recent
voluntary turn-out of the battalions on the
occasion of the celebration of the university
appropriation bill demonstrates what the boys
can do when they will; the negligent and
slouchy manner in which they regularly go
through the maneuvers shows what they will
do when they must.
: As long as the department pursues the pol
icy of emphasizing its authority by forcing
upon the men petty and irksome regulations,
just so long will an independeut student body
show its resentment by defiant hostility to
ward its petty tyrants.
' A change in the attitude of the department
toward the officers, especially the lower offi
cers of tho companies, might well be made.
The bitter personal reprimands wnich the
commandant sees fit to inflict at pleasure upon
the non-commissioned officers tends only to
create between them and the privates below
them the s><me attitude that the commandant
has created between itself and tho officers.
And the petty annoyances with which tho non
commissioned officer will endeavor to impress
his authority upon the ranks will arouse a re
sentment that will manifest itself in the most
careless kind of drilling.
And even a decent respect for the opinions
of the officeless might be shown without dero
gation from the dignity of the powers that be.
It is highly improbable that even fair and de
cent treatment will ever make drill univer-
I sally popular, but it is nevertheless certain
that a little mutual consideration will serve
to mitigate the drudgery of one's perfunctory
military schooling. If, for instance, excuse
from a term's drill were offered as a reward
for satisfactory drilling during the flrst two
i years and a half, or if the present custom of
i granting excuses that are not excuses were
I discontinued, the military department would
! be the recipient of fewer despairing Impreca
tions from the unhappy victims upon the
altar of Mars.
Another critic is Charles Osborne, who
thinks that the courses at Berkeley are so
arranged that students during their first
two years at college are taking a "post
graduate high school course," real uni
versity work not beginning until the
junior year.
Incidentally, Osborne declares that the
recent critics of the university have been
personal rather than general, thus op
posing Editor Hopper's expressed notion
that no personalities were indulged in.
They Kept Their Secret.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 15.â President
Martin Kellogg of ' the State University
has written a letter of thanks to the
young ladies of the university who pre
sented him with a charter day gift as a
token of remembrance of his fourth anni
versary as president.
The question has arisen as to why the
male students were not given a chance to
be represented in the gift to the president.
It seems that the co-eds discussed taking
collegians of the sterner sex into their
secret, but finally, decided that they
wanted to give the present themselves
as a mark of their appreciation of the
president, but . also in memory of his
especial justice and consideration toward
the women during the history of co
education at Berkeley.
College Functions Conflict.
" BERKELEY, Cal., April 15.â The Skull
and Keys Social and Dramatic Fraternity j
at the State University will give its an
nual play at the Macdonough Tneater, in
Oakland, on the evening of April 24. " By
an unforeseen combination of circum- j
stances the play will fall on the same
evening as the annual intercollegiate de
bate in San Francisco. It seems that the
date for the debate was originally -set for
Saturday evening, the 17th. Then it was
changed to the 24th. Meanwhile 'the
Skull and Keys managers had set the 24th
as the date for the play, made their de
posit for the theater and issued the invi
tations. -'"' â¢
Now that the two university functions
conflict, great regret has been expressed
on the part of the Skull and Keys men,
since a change of date seems impossible.
Annual Church Meeting-.

nual meeting of the West Berkeley Pres
byterian Church was held last evening.
P.ev. Dr. Ke chum was chosen moderator

His Nam- Great Scott.
Among the arrivals at the Palmer House
to-day was a middle-aged gentleman of
rather distin^uishe i appearance, who
wrote on the register: "Great Scott,
Baltimore."
The clerk smiled when he-read the name
and looked inquiringly at the guest.
"Yes, it is a rather peculiar name," re
marked the man, construing the clerk's
smile as an inquiry. "My family name is
Scott and my father was somewhat of a
humorist. When I was born he applied
to me as a name the common ejaculation
of surprise, and I have borne the name

HUGH B. McAVOY
ACCUSED OF FRAUD
Miss Annie B. Gallagher,
His Partner, Files a
Complaint-
Says He Has Systematically
Falsified tbe Accounts of the
Undertaking Business.
Thousands of Dollars Alleged to Have
Been Unlawfully Diverted to
His Coffers.
Miss Annie B. Gallagher, by her attor
neys, Sullivan & Sullivan, has Instituted
a suit against Hugh B. McAvoy and
Ernestine Gallagher, executrix of the es
tate of Henry J. Gallagher, deceased, for
an accounting.
Miss Gallagher is a partner in the un
dertaking business of McAvoy & Galla
gher at 20 Fifth street. She alleges that
she and her brother had always had the
greatest confidence in the honesty and in
tegrity of McAvoy and permitted him to
take lull charge of the books of the firm.
A suspicion of dishonesty never crossed
their minds, and so the books were never
given even a cursory examination until
after the death of Henry Gallagher, when
it became necessary to balance them to
ascertain the value of his interest in the
firm.
The complaint says that it was found
that McAvoy's frauds commenced in May,
1887, one year alter the partnership was
formed, and have continued ever since.
By means of false lootings be had been
able to appropriate $13,800 belonging to
the firm.
Miss Gallagher also charges that Mc-
Avoy has defrauded the firm of various
other sums in other ways, but the amount
is not known. He executed the note of
the firm in favor of the Donohoe-Kolly
Banking Company for $2000 and appro
priated the borrowed money to his own
uses.
Miss Gallagher always employed a man
to look after her interest?- in the firm, but
discharged him a short time ago. He was
immediately employed by McAvoy, wbo
refused to permit James Sullivau, Miss
Gallagher's newly employed representa
tive, to see the Dooks or look after her in
terests in any way.
Miss Gallagher alleges that the stock
and fixtures of the firm are worth $45,000,
and that there are outstanding accounts
to the value of $20,000. while the firm has
debts amounting to $16,000.
It is alleged that proceedings in insolven- |
cy are about to be commenced and that Mc-
Avoy is not able to pay his share of the
debts.
The plaintiff asks that McAvoy be com
pelled to account for the profits of the !
business; that he be restrained from in
terfering with the business ot the firm, ;
and that a receiver be appointed.
John L. Buckley was appointed re- i
ceiver and the restraining order issued as '
prayed for, preventing any further trans
fer of property in teres, one way or an
other.
Last Monday there was placed on rec
ord a mortgage of $1750 given by H. B.
McAvoy and wife to lists California Casket
Company on the property at the north
west corner of Broderick and Waller
streets. On the same day Mrs. McAvoy
filed a declaration of homestead on the
same property, valuing it at $5000.
Miss Gallagher alleges ti at the false
entries by McAvoy will amount to $13,800,
but she is unable to ascertain the extent
of bis other fraudulent transactions.
Mr. McAvov came to The Call office
last night and made the following state
ment and denial:
"My conduct has been honorable, and
an investigation will show that $11,000
was invested by Mr. Gallagher, and that
the $2000 borrowed was with his full con
sent for my brother's use. The sums
drawn by Mr. Gallagher were larger than
those drawn by me, and a thorough in
vestigation will put me in a proper light.
1 simply ask a suspension of judgment
until the case is settled."

SAN BRUNO'S NECESSITIES
The Residents on the Old Roadway
Will Ask for Fire Pro
tection.
The tamayers and property-owners on
the line of the San Bruno road will de
mand from the Supervisors a portion of
next year's appropriation for lights and
hydrants. They want them placed from
Army street along that portion of the
rood where the houses "are numbered.
It is claimed by those who live in
that section that they have been
neglected for a number of years, no provi
sions having been made to protect their
homes against fire. The Spring Valley.
Water Company lias ignored that section
in its distribution of water mains, al
though the pipes which supply the City
with water run within a :ew hundred
yards of the roadway, and the work of ex
tending a side main to any one of the
many elevated mounds adjacent to the
valley would entail but a trifling ex
pense.
If this were done hydrants could be
placed at convenient points.
A similar neglect is attributed to the gas
and electric company in not extending its
pipes or conduits in that direction, and
as a result the people living out there
might as well be located in Alaska. Even
"Uncle ; Sam" has forgotten them, in his
postoffice distribution. Not a solitary
letter- _ox can be found where the people
couid mail heir cotrespondence.

GLEAVES WILL BE
SURVEYOR-GENERAL
â¢p"'i-p "--.â -, -
Major McLaughlin Says No
Change Will Be Made
in the Attorneyship.
Chairman Hanna Telegraphs
That Candidates Must Get
Home Indorsement.
Other Positions and the Reward of
Colonel Irishâ Mr. McLaughlin Not
a Candidate for Any Office.
Major McLaughlin, chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee, whose
interview regarding some of the appoint
ments to be made by President McKinley
appeared a day or two ago in The Call,
has some interesting details not hitherto
published. They will be read with ap
preciation by many thousands in Califor
nia, and especially by those who want to
see Republican principles triumph. The
major was, in all, about two months in
-Vasbington. He first attended to ap
pointive offices of which he has not hith
erto spoken. There are seven or eight of
these.
Allusion was first make to the apprais
ersbip and to the efforts of Frank E.
: . â 
Senator J. M. Gleaves*
Webb, David Smith and Jacob Sbaen to
get the office.
"I really don't know," he said, "who is
likely to get this office. These are some
of tbe names, but there are enough
more to make the number legion. There
is no limit to the applicants. Tbe place
is under advisement. 1 can make no fore
cast.
"As to the postmastership the same
situation practically exists. Nooody
knows who will get it, but it will belike
the other place, and all places for that
matter. Whoever Gets it must bave the
backing of the California delegation, and
the indorsement of the Senate. The lat
ter is imperative. The California delega
tion, powerful as its indorsement is, and
important as it is, is yet not equal to the
Senate. The President makes toe ap
pointments and the Senate confirms. Ii
isn't the House. The House has nothing
to do with it. These remarks, though
given in connection with the postmaster
ship, apply to all appointive offices.
"In regard to Naval Officei. the place
now held by Colonel Irish, there is a dis
position to" reward the gold Democrats
who helped elect the Republican ticket.
Colonel Irish did excellent service, and he I
will undoubtedly be allowed to -serve bis
term out, and even then no one may be
appointed to take his place. I was sur
prised at the great number of friends that
Colonel Irish had. They \ were good
people, Republicans as well as Demo
crats, and tuey. kept cropping- up every
where. He has got very strong friends.
"About the surveyor-generalship there
are lots of applicants, but the man who is
slated to get it is Senator J. M. Gleaves of
Redding. â  I wish to state here that the
patronage is absolutely in the hands of
the delegation, and without its indorse
ment no . applicant , stands any show.
Senator Gleaves evidently has the lead
for this office. * *( : ; v ;' :
"Now,' regarding the Register of the
Land Office, Receiver and Commissioner
of Immigration, I know nothing. An
enormous number of letters have been
written by different people wanting these
and other places to Senators and others
â¢over the conntry and Mr. Hanna, asking
their aid. These letters are immediately
turned over to the California delegation.
They refuse absolutely to have anything
to do with such claims for office, and nave
been turning tne letters over to their own
people. I saw many ol these letters when
I was there. It would astonish you if you
knew who many of the writers were.
"Anent this some of those who sent let
ters to Senator Hanna and others have ex
plained that they did so at the solicitation
of these public men. but this is incorrect,
and only a way of beating around the fact.
I beard about this , and i wired Senator
Hanna, asking him about it. I have re
ceived his reply and the substance of it is
that candidates for office must make their
applications through the Slate Central
Committee and . be recommended by the
Congressional delegation, and that he has
in no way advised or made suggestions to
any candidates, despite any statements to
the contrary. This was, as I have said,
in reply to a telegram of inquiry of mine.
â¢'The United States attorneyship for
the Northern District will not be settled
for two years. No change will be made
before that time. About Judge Waymire,
he was out for a Cabinet position at first,
and now. is undoubtedly in the 'field for
the United States .judgeship, jj A great
deal will depend as to this place |on what
McKenna says. The President will listen
to him, and that will decide it. McKenna
has great influence with the President, as
I stated immediately on my return | from
Washington. As to Frank L. Coombs, I
have not beard that he wanted anything
since the Japan Ministry matter was set
tled. That was fixed for Mr. Buck in ad
vance at St. Louis."
The major. was asked regarding the as
sertion of yonng Georg- Morse, nephew
by marriage of - Mr. McKinley, that Way
mire was sure to be provided for in some
way. He said he did not think Mr. Morse
knew much about it. Major McLaughlin
also emphasized the fact that candidates
must have the indorsement of the Cali
fornia delegation and the Senate. It was
useless to go writing letters to Senators or
politicians elsewhere, because these letters
were almost immediately turned over to
the" delegation. â¢â "â .â¢*..
, Major McLaughlin allude I to the tire
less effort of .many, people, to get office,
and said he could notunderstana it. The
places were not worth the struggle that
was being put forth. J ..*;â 
"That leads me to allude to another
matter,' 1 said he, "that I . thought was
settled long ago, but it appears not,' for I
am hearing about ; it, again, and that is
that I might be *a' candidate .* for some
place and accept it. - I want to say, as em
phatically as I can, that l am not a candi
date for any position whatever and could
not, -under any , circumstances, be pre
vailed on to take any kind of a political
place.".
..- Judge Burke and Mr. Jarboe were pres
ent, and the former lightly twitted the
major regarding the governorship two
years hence. ';-*,;.;'
"I? want 'to say positively regarding
that," said he, "or any other place that
could be mentioned, that I neither want
any nor would 1 accept such place. I
would not take any position, State or
National, if it was brought to me, to use a
hackneyed expression, on a silver plate.
I hope this is now definitely and for all
time understood."
Y. M. C. A. REOPENING.
; An Interesting Programme, Cone! tiding
"With Â» Spirited Game of
flasket-Ball.
Last night was a gala night at tbe Y.
M. C. A. building. The occasion was the
reopening of the many departments be
longing to the association. The exercises
were , given under the auspices of the
Young Men's Improvement Committee.
The first part of the programme took
oiace in the cheerful little auditorium.
The Knickerbocker Quartet sang some
pretty selections, Miss Chase recited, Miss
Roberts sang and the Columbian orchestra
rendered several selections.
The game of basket-ball between the
"business men's team" ol the San Fran
cisco association and' the "Athens team"
of the -Oakland association was, how
ever, the event of the evening.
The score at the close ol the game stood
11 to 2in favor of the local team. Some
very brilliant work was done by F. M.
Goodrich, who made seven of the eleven
points. made by the San Franciscos. C.
ileniharii, the right center, made the
other four. .*->'
C. J. Anger's team work was excellent.
The Oakland team was evidently not in
good form, for it failed to put up its usual
good game and in the second bail went all
to pieces. F. J.. 8011s scored the first point
for the Oaklands, and some of the best
work for that team was done by J. Lan
caster. At the conclusion of the pro
gramme the teams were' given a banquet.
DECEIVED AND DESERTED.
A Woman Who Trusted Her New
Husband With Her Money
Mourns Both.
She Now Thinks That the Ceremony
That United Them Was Merely
a Sham.
Detectives are looking for a young man
who registered a few days ago at the
Windsor Hotel, on Market street, as H.
Sears. : ';'/.â ;..;
The wife whom he left there is very
anxious to discover bis whereabouts, and
it is she who has set the officers at work.
She claims to have been deceived, robbed
and deserted, and she is uncertain whether
the ceremony performed in Los Angeles
just previous to their coming here was a
genuine marriage or not. . . "_.V.J
Sears is a young man, about 35, weigh
ing about 135 pounds and is a Jew. He is
-aid to be a newspaper man, and he was
formerly employed as a reporter in this
City; later he was part proprietor or edi
tor of a paper at Vacaville. It is said by
some who claim to know him that his
name is Searles. ? -. i
The woman in the case is considerably '
older than ber alleged husband, being at I
least 40 years of age. IM''
She is of Swedish birth and is not only
taller but much stouter (ban he is. She
had saved ?_CO. which she placed in a Los
Angeles savings bank. She says that
Sears became acquainted with, this fact
and made desperate love. to her; that he
told her, as they walked in the park at Los
Angeles, that he bad a nice home in San
Francisco to which, if she would marry
him, he would take her.
She consented ; a man in a black coat
was brought in and a marriage ceremony
tone through with, by which she believed
she was married. She drew her money
from the' bank and they took tbe train and
came here, puttine up at the Windsor
Hotel. She gave her ; m*Â»ney into his
charge with the utmost confidence. They
remained over night, taking their meals
in their room. In the morning Sears left,
taking all the money, saying he was going
to meet his mother, whom he was expect
ing. He has not been seen since.
The woman remained I two days waiting
for him and then left to look for other
lodgings and for work, Sears having left
her but .*â *Â». ;â¢;>?
She was visited on the second day after
his departure by two men who claimed to
be private detectives and who told her
that her husband had fled, but that they
kneW where he was and that -they would
bring bim back for a consideration of
$200. â ;.-. ..-â¢-â¢, .';-â '. Â
The woman has some money still com
ing to her from the old country, of which
Sears had knowledge, and it is supposed
that this was a play for any odd sum she
might happen to bave left.' Rut she bad
none. She thereupon sought advice and
informed, the Police Department, and an
effort is being made to discover Sears'
whereabouts.

Nicholas Brennan Wat Responsible..
The case of Nicholas Brennan, charged

Wallace's court. -.;.â¢-..
During yesterday's proceedings the tes
timony of Miss Tarpey, taken at the pre
liminary hearing in the Police Court, was
read. Miss - Tarpey is 1 dead, and for this
reason the court allowed her former tes
timony to be read. In her statement she

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 36, 1897.
TO SEARCH FOR
THE SAMARIA
The Revenue Cutter Rush
Sent Out to
Sea.
Captain McLeod Is Still of the
Opinion That He Saw
Her April 2
At That Time She Was 180 Mies Off
the Mouth of the Columbia
River.
The fate of the American ship Samaria
is still in doubt, and the revenue cutter
Rush went out yesterday afternoon to
solve the problem."
On March 26 Captain Peterson of the
Sailor Boy saw the Vessel in latitude 46
north, longitude 127 west. At that time
she had her main topgallant and fore up
per and lower topsails set. After that an
exceedingly heavy gale came up and

again by the schooner.
The schooner Alcalde, Captain Weit
kanat, also lost sight of the ship in the
some storm. .?.lJ,J]
On April 2, however. Captain McLeod of
the Rcfus Â£. Wood is almost certain that
he saw her in a disabled condition. In
Tut. Call of Wednesday last be is quoted
as saying: ' - â â 'â¢â *.
Exactly twelve days ago this morning I
was 180 miles off the mouth of the Columbia
River. [The Ruiuk E. Wood reached this port
on the 10th inst.] Hull down, behind us I
could see a ship without a stitch of canvas on
her main, and only the light sails on her fore
and mizzen. She was heading for the river,
and I came to the conclusion that the main
mast was sprung and that the captain was
afraid of carrying sail even in the light breeze
for fear of doing more damage. Late in the j
afternoon the ship put about and took up the j
same course I was steering. Tne Wood bad I
every stitch of canvas set, and it was not long
before the other vessel was out of sight. From
that time to port we had light winds and I
calms, and the same kind of weather has -pre- I
vailed ever since. - While 1 am not sure that it !
was the Samaria I sighted, still I have no hesi
tation In saying that I think she will reach
port in a disabled condition. /,â¢--:-
It is evident that tbe Federal authorities !
are acting on the report of Captain Mc- |
Leod in the sending out of the Rush. The I
work of r coaling t.e revenue cutter was |
done quickly yesterday, and by, 4 p. m. she
was backing out from Folsom-street wharf,
and an hour later had passed through the
Golden Gate and was fairly on her search.
Deputy Collector of - the Port E. B.
Jerome was asked yesterday how long the
cutter would remain out. His answer was
that Captain Rob rts bad heen given in
structions to search the coast thoroughly ,
and also to go over the course. usually fol
lowed by sailing vessels on the way here
from Pueet Sound. According to him the
Rush will be away about three \feeks. ,' :
As before stated in The Cam., the opin
ion among seafaring men is still divided.
Some of the moat experienced skippers
on the coast think the Samaria will come
in, and point to her long voyage from
Hongkong in support of their contention.
Others, equally ;as skillful navigators,
point to the unusually heavy gales en
countered and shake their beads omi
nously. .
Captain McLeod still sticks to his opin
ion that the Samaria is afloat and will
either sail in or be towed to port by the
Rush. - '

Uext Monday morning Judge Wallace's
Department of the Superior Court will be

represented, and it is expected that there
will be 2500 active competitors on the
scene. ...'â¢. * -"â¢ 'JS:
The events will comprise team and in
dividual work. The local team is pre

THEIR SALARIES
WILL BE PAID
Teachers Need Not Worry
Over Their Warrants
ior May.
To Protect Tradesmen June
Salaries to Be Withheld
Three Weeks.
Then Warrants for the Balance Due
Since November Will Also
Be Forthcoming
It seems that of late some little alarm
has been manifest in school circles
through a rumor that the Board of School
Directors had .found it necessary to with
hold teachers' salaries for the month of
May. ' â¢ ."â¢â  ;';y
A communication addressed to the
editor of The Call was received yester
day, in which the writer stated that she
understood this to be the case, and as
serted, furthermore, that on top of the
withholding of. warrants for naif the No
vember salary, such action was an out
rage and deserved the condemnation of
the press and the public generally.
Inquiry has elicited the information
from a reliable source that there is no
ground whatever for any anxiety on the
part of teacher-. Warrants for the pay
ment of the May salaries will be forth
coming on June 5, but, owing to a peculiar
condition of affairs, the payment of June
salaries must unavoidably be postponed
until tbe last weeK in July, at which time
the remainder of the November salaries
will also be paid.
In explanation of this slate ot affairs
School Director Samuel Waller said last
evening:
"In the month of November the old
board deducted halt the teachers' salaries,
amounting. to $.'"7,000. Tbey spent this,
and together with oilier expenditures it
made a total deficit of $91,000 on January
1, when we took our seats.
"In the last tax levy an error was made
by the Board of Supervisors in fixing the
rate for the School Department, and in
stead of getting $325,000 for tne fiscal year
from July 1, 1896, to. July 1, 1897, the
Finance Committee of the Board of Edu
cation, by consultation with the Tax
Collector, Auditor and Treasurer, came
to th** conclusion that we would get only
$315,000.
"Aeain, the. Stale school fund, the first
installment of which was paid in Decem
ber, should have been $430,000, but we re
ceived only '$413,000, making a deficit of
$17,000 there.
"The first installment of these taxes.will
be due the Ist of July, and instead of get
ting $220,000 we figure that we will get
only $197,000, making another deficit ot
$23,000. Adding the sums of $91,000, $17,
--000 and $23,000, there exists a total deficit
of $130,000. Tnis will come on July 1. r
"This board has saved about * $30,000
since it has been in office by cutting down
supplies. Now, .by the jj closest kind of
figuring we have arrived at this con
conclusion: 'On July 5, when, in accord
ance with- custom, the demand fur the
previous month is made out we will be
r. Die to add to the June demand the half
month's salary for November heretofore
withheld. "' â¢ - -*â¢ - - .
"These demands will be then held out
until all the money due tradesmen who
have furnished supplies and material has
been paid. Otherwise under the provision
of the one-twelfth act these tradesmen
will lose all they have supplied the de
partment with. .' â¢fxx-.'~-'l . 'Â
"But the teachers' warrants will be
made out and held in our possession until
the tradesmen are paid, and teachers will
be given then warrants about the last
week of the month of July.
"According to ; the law the teachers
must receive their salaries, but tradesmen
are not protected., The teachers are sure
of their salaries, and will have to wait
only two or three weeks."

Twenty-Second Annual Meeting or the

held, one beginning at 10:30 a.m. and the
other at 1:90 p. M. .
Among the interesting addresses of the
meeting were ..those delivered by Mrs.
Henry Varley and Mrs. Hansen, who had
served in far India. .
