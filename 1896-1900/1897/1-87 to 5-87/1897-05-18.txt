LONDON', En*g., May 17.â The powers
are fast making the worst possible mud
dle of their miss on of mediation between
Greece and Turkey. They are directly
responsible for the last miserable collapse
of the Greek arms in Epirus.
The Greek troops in Fr day's fighting
completely retrieved their good name by
<Tlendid valor and martyr-lifce sacrifices,
worthy of any soldiers on earth. The
day's battle closed with everything in
their favor. They would have been al
most certain to have reaped the reward of
their courage the next day, but order.*
came from Athens to stop all offensive
movements. The reason for th:s was that
the powers had asserted they had inter
fered with negotiations for an armistice.
1 hoy offered to restrain the Turks if the
Greeks would keep quiet, thus gaining a
truce in fact, if not in name. It is now
known that t'te powers agreed to do what
is beyond their power to execute. The
Turks are vigorously pushing their opera
tion*, while ihe Oretti! are crippied oy
the actions of their impotent mentors.
The Sultan remains complete master of
the situation. He has rut forward claims
which Europe unanimously declares to be
ab-urd and preposterous, but this feeling
is cbaneing to dismay when it is consid
ered the Porte refuses even an armistice
until its dematidg are conceded. Active
interference by Europe is impracticable,
at least until after long consultations. In
the meantime the TurKs can take Athens.
There is material for cynical satisfaction
f6r American observers in to-day's attitude
of the impotent wrath of all the support
ers of Salisbury's policy. They display
the greatest surprise and anger because
the logical effects of their action, which
has been most obvious from the outside,
now dominate the Eastern situation.
The silly idea that the solution of the
problem wa3 the punishment of the
Greeks at the hands of the Turks has led
them into difficulties which are far more
perilous than the ante-bellum troubles.
England, however, is the only country
which has wholly overreached herself.
Russia, Germany ana Austria will settle
the problem to suit themselves when
] eadr. They will control the finances both
ni Turkey and Greece in some form and
Great Britain will have only a nominal
part in the arrangement.
BATTLE AT DHOMOKO.
Turkish Forces Assail the Greek
Stronghold, but Fall to
Capture It.
ATHENS, Greece, May 17.â Edhem
Pasha advanced upon Dhomolco with
40,000 men this moning. Later dis
patches say the fight bezau at noon and
Boon extended along the whole line of
the Greek defenses. Some 30,000 Turks
attacked both wings of the Greek army.
The assault was especially violent against
the left wing.
A report reached here this afternoon
that the Turks had captured DhomoKo,
but it has not been confirmed by later
dispatches, and is very doubtful. It is
certain, however, that a furious battle
has teen fought. The Turkish attack
was aimed to break through the Greek
lines. A part of the Turkish array ad-
Tanced as far as T'ouflian, bat the
Greek artillery compelled them to re
t-eat toward Pharsalia.
It is reported to-night that the Greek
left win>; temporarily retired toward the
center, being outnumbered three to one,
but that tho Greeks ultimately repulsea
the attacking force. General Mavromich
alis, one of the Greet commanders, was
wour.ded. The fighting ceased at 8:30
. o'clock to-night. At that time the Turks
had retreated sligbtlj from the. center
and right of the Greek position, and the
Greeks had abandoned their outpoats on
the left. .
The attack upon Dhomoko was a com
plete surprise here. The Ministers scarcely
believed the dispatches announcing that
the Turks had attacked the place. They
met at noon and continued in session un
til late to-night. There is great excite
ment in the city.
LONDON, E.\g., May 17.â A dispatch to
(be Clironicle from Athens gives the fol
The San Francisco Call
lowing official account of the battle at
D omofco:
"Hostilities began with artillery action
at noon, our big guns checking the enemy,
who were concentrating to attack our
front. The enemy neared our infantry
range at 2 o'clock, when the real battle be
gan. More than 50.000 Turks concurrently
and fiercely attacked our front on the
right and left. Our artillery and infantry
aid splendid woik. The whole of the
enemy's regiment twice stopped, wavered
and fled, but the attack was soon renewed
by fresh forces until those were also hurled
back by the stubborn resistance and
splendid vigor of our troops, and finally
the enemy gave way altogether.
"The attack on our left was led with
some vigor, but the enemy was repulsed.
We did not fare so well on the right. The
first attack was repulsed, but the enemy
concentrated an immen?p force and re
attacked us with extreme vigor. Oar first
line wavered and was broken. Our wing
would have been turned if a part of thÂ«
Second Brigade had not been sent to re
enlorce iL The enemy had gained ground
that it was impossible at that time for us
to regain. Subsequently our right wing
had to retire a little, concentrating at
Bousi. We kept all our positions in the
center and on the left. The enemy had a
reserve of 30,000 men. Our whole force
numbered 35,000. Our losses were heavy.
The enemy must have lost thousands."
A dispatch to the Central News from
Athens affirms that the Greeks were de
feated at Dhomoko. It says after the en
trenchments at Kitikim had been success
fully atormed the whole Greek army re
tired upon the line in the Othrys Moun
tains.
WAS DHOMOKO CAPTURED?
From Vienna Comes a Report That
the Greeks Were Badly
Defeated.
LONDON, Esq., May 17.â The Daily
Telegraph's Vienna dispatch says a cor
respondent with the Turtish army re
ports Dhomcko captured, and the Greeks
badly defeated.

More Than the European

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turret. Mny
17. â The powers have unanimously agreed
to protest against the demand of the
Porte that Thessalr be ceded to Turkey,
and also against the demand for the
abolition of capitulations in favor of
Greek subjects in Turkey.
Representatives of the powers have pre
sented to the Porte a note answering the
Turkish reply to tbe original note of the
powers requesting the cessation of hostili
ties pending negotiations. No notice was
taken in this note of the Turkish de
mands, the Embassadors merely repeat
ing the former request of a cessation of
hostilities.
LONDON, Eno., May 17.â A dispatch to
the Chronicle from Athens says diploma
tists mere have telegraphed their Govern
ments and to Constantinople pressingly
I requesting the immediate cessation of
! hostilities. itadd3 the Greek Government
declares that unless there is a cessation to
morrow extreme and desperate steps will
be taken.
The Times' Constantinople correspond
ent says representatives of tho powers
there were quite unprepared for the note
of the Porte in response to their request
for a cessation of hostilities. It was not
expected the Sultan would capitulate so
| precipitately to bellicose influences, but
I Abdul Hamid regards his personal
safety and security of the throne as less
endangered by ignorine the will of
j Europe than by resisting the wishes of an
overwhelmingly large body of his Mo
hammedan subjects on the question of
appealing to their fiercest sensibilities.
This danger was evidently brought home
to the Sultan Friday, for the German and
Russian envoys, who most closely observe
the Sultan, were astounded by the peremp
tory tone and preposterous tenor of the
note. The envoys absolutely and unani
mously warned the Porte that serious
difficulties would arise from the attitude
he has taken.

FICTION ONCE MORE ECLIPSED.
Morally and Legally Released President
Bottom ley Pays \he Debts of His
Defunct Concern.
LONDON, Eng., Miy 17.â The com
mercial world has been startled by a re
markable occurrence in which Horatio
Bottomloy, for many years president of
the Hansard Union, is a central figure.
The business of the union was the pub
lication of verbatim reports of the pro
ceedings of Parliament, corresponding to
the Congressional Record of the United
States. Several years ago the union com
bined with a number of large printing
establishments; more stock and bonds
were issued than the amalgamated
concern could stand, and as a finale,
there was a crash, in which the stock
and bond owners lost hundreds of thou
sands of dollars.
The indignation cf the unfortunates
was focused in the main upon President
Bottomley, although the legal investiga
tion that followed developed the fact that
he was more of a victim tnan a wrecker.
In the few years thet have elapsed since
the crash he has managed to accumulate
a large fortune in speculation, and hav
ing traced out all of the stockholder* of
the old concern who were ruined or tan
tamount thereto by the failure, he has
placed in the hands of trustees $2,260,000,
to be divided among the stockholders in
proportion to their losses.
The action is the more noteworthy from
the fact that there existed neither legal nor
moral obligation on Bottomley's part to
meet any of the liabilities of the defunct
concern.

REMAINS
Portions of a Skeleton
Found on a Reedley
Ranch.
BURIED NEAR CONVICT!
SANDERS' HOME.
Fresno Officers Believe They
Have the Bones of the
Professor's Victim.
WERE PARTIALLY DESTROYED
BY A CORROSIVE
Piece of Watch-Chain and a Can
That Had Contained Dye Also
Uncovered.
FRESNO, Cal., May 17.â 1s the small
collection of bones now in the possession
of District Attorney Snow the remains of
an arm of William Wootton? They were
unearthed about a mile from the ranch of
Professor \V. A. Sanders, who, by bis re
cent conviction on the charge of having
forged '.he name of the missing rancher,
was piactically adjudged guilty of having
murdered him, or at least to have bad
something to do with the deed.
There are some very peculiar e'reum
stances connected with the finding of
these bones, and it may be possible that
the discovery will solve tnat perplexing
question which has always baffled the
officers in even forming a reasonable
theory; what disposition was made of the
murdered man's body? Tde authorities
have not concluded their investigations
yet, and it may develop that the find
amounts to nothing. Dr. A. J. Pedlar ex
amined the collection at the instance of
The Call correspondent to-day, and,
thougli he did not express a positive
opinion, he was inclined to the belief that
the bones were not those of a man's arm.
With the bones was found a can, which
had evidently contained concentrated lye
or the like. The top of the can was off
and the lye had eaton through the tin.
The bones showed indications of where a
tissue-destroying solution had been at
work on them, and as they had been par
tially destroyed it was difficult to deter
mine definitely if they were the remains
of an arm or not. If those of an arm, the
limb had beon broken about two inches
above the elbow. They were all discon
nected. Two seemed to be the bones of
the forearm and many little ones the
bones of the hand.
The sensational discovery was made at
a place about a mile north of Sanders'
ranch, which is rive miles southeast of
Keedley. When Wootton disappeared in
February, 1894, the ranch on which the
bonea were unearthed was untenanted,
and no mon favorable spot could have
been selected by Sanders whereon to make
the burial secretly. The man who found
the collection is O. A. Henry, and he
made the discovery accidentally. He was
digging a hole in the ground at the base
of a tree. He noticed that t.'ie roots had
been cut, leaving the old stumps. At a
depth of two and a naif feet he uncovered
what he believed to be the remains of a
human being. He picked out the bones
and dug for several feet around for the re
mainder of the skeleton, but could find
nothing more. He immediately sus
pected that he had found the remains of
William Wootton, and hastened to Selma
to notify Constable Spencer there, who in
turn informed District Attorney Snow.
The District Attorney and Deputy Sheriff
Peck drove out to Henry's place and
brought the bones to tbis city.
Mr. Henry also found among the collec
â¢ion a gold bar of a watch chain, which
! was considerably corroded. It has not
been ascertained as yet whether Wootton
was carrying a watch on that ill-fated day
when he drove from his home with Pro
fessor Sanders.
While Mr. Pedlar is inclined to believe
that the bones are those of an animal,
there are some very peculiar circumstances
connected with the discovery which make
it highly interesting, because of the possi
bility that it may explain In part the mys
tery surrounding Wootton's disappear
ance. In the first place, it seems strange
that if it was a portion of an animal
buried there the man who dug the grave
should have gone to the trouble of cutting
away the roots when there was plenty of
soil around much easier to penetrate. The
finding of the can and a chain bar are
itlso very peculiar circumstances.
There have been some reports of late to
the effect that Mclntosh, the handwriting
expert who testified in Sanders' behalf and
who was sent to jail by Judge Carroll Cook
for perjury at the recent trial, shipped a
large-sized trunk from Reedier a few days
after Wootton's disappearance and took it
off the train at Pose It is said that Mc
lntosh was extremely solicitous about the
handling of the trunk. District Attorney
Saow stated to a Call correspondent to
day that the story originated in the imagi
nation of an excitable brakeman named
Smith.

CLASSED AS "HIGHWAYMEN."
Senator Pettigrew Pays His Respects to
the Pacfic R inroad Com
panies.
WASHINGTON, D. 0., May 17.â ThÂ«
resolution heretofore offered by Pettigrew
for the appointment of a s>eiect committee
to investigate the issue of patents for
lands to the Pacific railroads and the sink
ing fund of the companies, was taken up
in the Senato to-day and resisted by Gear,
chairman of the Pacitic Railroads Com
mittee, on the ground the committee
would be a "junketing" one, and all the
information desired could be obtained
from the Secretaries of the Interior and
Treasury. He moved that the resolution
be referred to the Pacific Railroads Com
mittee.
Pettigrew opposed this, saying the reso
lution would never come back to the Sen
ate. He charged that patents to millions
of acres of land in California have been
obtained by bribery and that there was
no pretense they had been earned. Ho
snoke of the companies as ' 'highwaymen."
Morgan, a member of the Pacific Rail
roads Committee, said he could see no
reason why an investigation could not be
made by that committee rather than by a
select committee. He moved that the
Pacific Railroads Committee be instructed
to make the investigation.
The motion was carried. The resolution
offered last week by Butler requesting the
President to inform the Senato under
what authority the proposed saie of the
Union Pacific Railroad had been agreed
to between the executive and the combina
tion of purchasers, was agreed to.

TARIFF t'ICK. ElilXii.
All Sort* of Rumor* in circulation About
ihn tutaar Sehtdule.
WASHINGTON. D. C. May 17.â Many
reports of tariff dickering are rife, out it is
impossible to ascertain which of them are
based on truth. One of these reports says
that several Western Senators have been
informed by friends of the sugar schedule,
as constructed by the Finance Com mi toe,
that their interests will b9 made subject
to reprisals if they do not vote for the
schedule.
The California Senators are said to have
been offered the Hawaiian reciprocity
clause of the Dingley bill in exchange for
their support of the sugar schedule, and
so the Hawaiian reciprocity clause may
aeain become a part of the Senate bill.
From the fieely expressed opinions of
many Senators it appears that the action
of the Finance C< mtn;uee in striking out
the reciprocity cause misrepre.sents the
prevailing sentiment in the Senate. The
most vigoroui opposition to the treaty
which a few weeks ago was expected to bs
exerted by Alien and other opponents of
tho sugar trust will not appear, probably,
now that it is learned that the trust de
sires the abrogation of the treaty. This
fact makes the vote of three years ago,
which was 5 to 1 against abrogation,
likely to be repeated if the matter comes
to a vote.

Renewal of the Battle to Secure
Recognition of the Insurgents

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 17.â Fresi.
dent McKinley to-day sent the following
message to Coneress:
"Official information from oar Consuls
in Cuba establishes the fact that a large
numb.T of American citizens of the island
are in a state of destitution, suffering for
want of food and medicines. This applies
particularly to rural districts of the cen
tral and eastern parts. Agricultural
classes have been forced from their farms
into the nearest towns, where they ara
without work or money. The local au
thorities of the several towns, however
kindly disposed, are unabla to relieve the
needs of their own people and are alto*
gether powerless to help our citizens.
"The latest report of Consul-General Lea
estimates that 600 or 800 Americans are
without means of support. I have assured
him that provision would be made to re
lieve them. To that end I recommend
that Congress mate an appropriation of
not less than $50,000 to be immediately
available for use under direction of the
Secretary of State. It is desirable that
part of the sum which may bj appro
priated by Congress should, in the dis
cretion of the Secretary of State, also be
used for the transporiation of American
citizens who are desiring to return to the
United States and are without means to
do it."
The message received the prompt and
cheerful support of every member of the
Senate, which passed the resolution ap
propriating the money requested.
A similar resolution would have passed
the House but for the objection of Bailey,
the Democratic leader. He prevented
unanimous consent for the passage of a
resoluiion introduced by Representative
Hittsimilar to the Senate's. As a result,
the House was compelled to adjourn
without action. Now it will be necessary
for the Committee on Rules of the House
to bring in a special order by which the
previous question can be ordered and the
Cuban resolution passed. This action
will probably be taken Thursday, the next
meeting day of the House.
toxed Donx the message.
Prttident McKinlnv Btedad the Adviea
of Counselor* at to Cubn.
WASHINGION, D. C, May 17.âChair
man Davis of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations was in conference with
the President and Cabinet at an early
special Cabinet meeting this morninpr,
and Representative Hitt, former chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs
in the House, read the message last even
ing during hij au<lience with the Presi
dent. Davis and Hitt informed the
leaders of the Senate and House of the
nature of the message, and meetings of
the Foreign Relations Committee and
Speaker Reed's lieutenants in the House
were hela before Contrress met, so that a
programme of action after the reading of
the message had already been mapped
out. I'>y the runk and file of Congress
men, however, and by a great majority of
the crowds of spectators in the galleries
it was supposed the President would use
graphic language in describing the
wretched condition of American cltisens
in Cuba, and that he would quote from
the confidential reports of Consuls.
There is good authority for the state
ment that when the President left Wash
ington Friday for Philadelphia he fully
intended to send to Coneresn to-day the
important points of the confidential re
ports, together with an appeal to Congress
for action on the Cuban question that
would have fired the hearts of Americans
everywhere. During the President's
absence, however, the question of what
action should be taken was left for tho
consideration of Secretaries Sherman and
Long and Judge Day. They were all
opposed to having the President go any
further Into the Cuban matter at this
time than to make a dispassionate recom
mendation for assistance for helple-8
Americans. The President hesitated
some time between his inclination to send
in his message and the advice of his offi
cial counselors not to do to. Last even
ing he Mud practically abandoned the
idea of tending any message at all. In<
meuiateiy after breakfast th'.s morning,
however, he sent word to the Cabinet
members to meet him at 10 o'clock. He
then sat down at his private desk and
wrote the message, which was submitted
to them at 10:30 and which went to Con
gress at noon.
The President has no intention to ?end
a warship to take away Americans who
want to return to the United Slates. The
suggestion in to-day's message about the
transportation of American citizens is in*
tended to ann'.v to Americans only who2
have no money and are anxious to get
away from the horrors of war. Passage
will be furnished them on regular steam
ers as fast as their applications are
granted.

claim of no quorum present, and a call of
the Senate was ordered. Foriy-six Sena
tors answered and before an attempt to
get a voe was maJe Wellington arose to
address the Senate in opposition to the
resolution. He made an impassioned ap
prtil' for â¢'ronservativeness." He likened
the "jingo"- talk of friends of the Morgan
resolution to the fighting of the windmill
by Don Quixote and the action of the
I.'i-hrusu at the Donnybrook fair, going
* about begging somebody to tread on the
tail of his coat.
Daniel of Virginia, a member of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, criti
cized Wellington's speech as a shot at the
main issue instead of an argument on the
motion to refer. It seemed to him Â«he re
marks of the Senator from Marylana were
based on an entire misapprehension of the
character of the resoution. The resolu
tion did not involve in the least an act of
hostility to Spain. The Senator from
Alary land had referred to the obligations
due to Spain for its encouragement to
Columbus four centuries ago, but for his
part, lie thought it a great pity Columbus
ever discovered America, if the new in
habitants were to continue the savacery
which bad prevailed before they came.
Daniel then went on to make a constitu
tional argument in support of the propo
sition that Congress had power to recog
nize either the belligerency or inde
pendsnee of a new State. He characterized
tne claim that the right of recognition was
executive as a "most preposterous and at
tenuated shape of one man power."
This remark caused a debate between
Daniel and Caffery, however, on the ex
ecutive's power to recognize belligerency.
It showed the speakers were all in doubt
on the point. Then Daniel continued
speech, saying:
'There has been a condition of war in
Cuba for two years and a half. The di
plomacy of the Spanish Government has
succeeded in blinking the eyes of diplo
mats of the United states to a realization
of tfsat fact. But the world knows there
is war in Cuba, high-handed, red-handed,
bloody, lamentable, cruel, savage war, a
war in which Spain has employed a larger
army than the British Government ever
seat to put down the insurrection in the
American colonies in 1776, and that army
is opposed by an army on the other side.
"It is a fact there is war in Cuba whether
the record is in our resolution or not. It
is a fact, whether we sympathize with
Cuba or with Spain, and it being fact, it
is an act of humanity for us to deal with
it and throw the great moral weight of
th;s Government so as to see the war con
ducted with as closa approximation to
Christian usages and civilized customs as
practicable under the circumstances.
- "It v said that this means war. I deny
it. If Spain should declare war upon us;
if she should seek for a moment war
against us because we recognize the bel
ligerency of her former subjects who have
been fighting her two and a half years,
sue will have an unjust cause of com
plaint in the war against us, and we will
have a just cause of complaint for war
a_'si:i- 1 her. Ido not want to see the
American people involved in war. I look
upon war as one of the greatest calami
ties. It is a greater calamity to have the
high public spirit of a great nation so
dead that it looks upon plunder and mur
der and arson with indifference; to have
the pnblic spirit of a great nation so
deadened that it hesitates or delays one
instant to go forward and do a proper act
because of a fear of war."
Daniel went on to argue that as Cuba is
right at our doors we have a just ground
for intervention. But aside from that we
have, he said, assumed an obligation
toward Cuba by the warning to Europe
that we will not permit them to meddle
with her affairs. He concluded amid great
applause from the galleries.
The English Embassador occupied a
seat in the diplomatic gallery during the
debate and was an attentive listener.
VBSTKUCIED HI BAIL BT.

ligrrtney Jifolutlon.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 17.-After
the President's message Had been read in
tne House, Hiti asked unanimous con
sent for the consideration of a bill appro
priating $50,000, in accordance with the
President's recommendation. Bailey said
):e wouid not object if, in connection with
the bill, the resolution of Senator Mor
gan, authorizing the recognition of bellig
erency of Cuban revolutionists could also
be considered by unanimous consent.
Dingley â I think, Mr. Speaker, we had
better dispose of the matter before the
House.
Bailey â Surely the gentleman from
Maine does not want to force an objection
irora this side of the House.
Dingiey â I desire tc test the House on
the proposition before it.
The Speaker â The gentleman from
Maine objects to the consideration of the
propositon of the gentleman from Texas.
Baileyâ Then I object to the considera
tion of the bill presented by the gentle
man from Illinois.
The passage by the Senate of tbe resolu
tion appropriating $50,000 for the relief of
Americans iv Cuba was afterward an
nounced to the House, and Hitt asked
unanimous consent for iis consideration.
Bailey again remarked there would be
no objection provided it be connected
with the Senate resolution by Morgan.
Dineleyâ We will attend to one matter
at a time, Mr. Speaker.
Baileyâ Well, you'll attend to both
of these before you attend to either.
[Rapturous applause by the Democrats.]
The Speakerâ Objection is made.
Baileyâ Tuen 1 a*k the unnninious con
sent, Mr. Speaker.
Dir.gleyâ l move the House adjourn.
Bailey â Certainly the gentleman from
Maine is not afraid to have this question
discussed.
The Speaker put the question on the
motion toadj>urn, upon which Bailey de
manded a vote by ayes and noes, and se
cured it, resulting ayos 90, noes 71. absent
13. So the House adjourned until Thurs
day.
The vote was along party lines, the Re
publicans being in the affirmative.
Dalzeil, member of the Committee on
Rules, said the committee probably would
report the order of consideration of the
joint resolution for Thursday. Bailey
thinks he has the Republicans in a hole,
nnd that they cannot avoid voting on the
Morgan resolution.
Should the Committee on Rules tase
the action indicated 03' Dalzeil, Bailey
says he will present a minority report,
making the Morgan resolution part of the
subject to be considered. The majority
will then, he says, be compelled to vote
on the resolution before it can act on the
appropriation resolution.

OMAHA, Nebr , May 17.â After many
months' delay in the filing of a supple*
mental decree, the case of the United
States against the Western Union and
Union Pacific is being heard in the Fed
eral court. General Solicitor Kelly of the
Union Pacific and Judge Mor*man, repre
senting the Western Union, are present
United Slates Attorney Sawyer took up
the forenoon in an argument to show that
the order of Judge Hunger, permitting
the tiling two weeks ago of the supple
mental answer of the Union Pacific and a
cross-bill by .he Western Union should be
vacated.
His position was that these papers con
tained matter for a new litigation, while it
is the plain duty of the court to proceed
to enter a supplemental decree under a
mandate of the Supreme Court and force
the two companies to separate their lines.
John Kellv was allowed to file an an
swer for the Union Pacific receivers. He
held that the receivers were already a
party to the action. He pleaded that
much time would be required to ascertain
what part of the telegraph property be
longed to the road and what part to the
telegraph company and that tlie receivers
at present were unable to state.
The court to-night took the case under
advisement.

Deviling Way* anil Meant to Combat

CHICAGO, 111., May 17â Most of the
leading ploying builders of the city
met in secret conference here to-day for
the purpose of consolidating the various
employers' associations to combat the
labor unions identified with the building
trade. .
These unions nave an alliance, offensive
and defensive, under which, if any Ine
trade has a grievance all the other trades
are pledged to join in a sympathetic strike
until it is remedied.
As a resultâ : n the event, for instance,
of the plumbers having a grievance â the
masons, bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters
and others of allied trades would be com
pelled to walk out, although satisfied with
their own relations with their, employers.
The latter have tired of being at the
mercy of the walking delegates and busi
ness agents and now propose to take mat
ters in their own hands.

Launch of the Holland
Submarine Torpedo-
Boat.
It Represents a Quarter of a
Century of Labor by
the Inventor.
Purely a Private Vessel, but More
Than One Government Is Anx
ious to Obtain It.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 17.â After ex
perimenting for nearly a quarter of a cen
tury John P. Holland bsd the satisfaction
to-day of seeing hi* submarine torpedo
boat launched at Elizabethport and chris
tened Holland. .No one will be permitted
to see the interior of the vessel until full
experiments liava shown the boat com De
sent to do the full work for which il was
intended. The launch was successful in
every way.
The Holland is purely a private vessel.
The Government is building a vessel of
the same type, much larger, in Baltimore.
Congress has appropriated $30U,G00 to
build two vessels like the Baltimore boat.
Some of this money will probably be used
to purchase the Holland, if the company
is willing to sell her. Several other Gov
ernments are said to have made offers for
the boat, and the Holland may be sent
abroad to give exhibitions.
The Holland is 65 feet long, and nearly
11 feet in diameter at her largest frame.
She will be run by a gas-engine when
partly submerged. When entirely sub
merged she will be run by electric storage
batteries. She has only one screw, which,
with the diving and steering rudder*, is
pro'ected from injury by a steel ring
nearly a foot broad and an inch thick.
On the surface she will have a upeed of
firteen knots an hour. Under water the
>peed will be from eight to ten knots per
hour. A reservoir ol compressed air will
be stored in the side to provide a constnnt
supply and to expel water from the tanks,
which are filled to tacilitate submergence.
When the tanks are filled and a hill crew
is aboard there will be a reserve buoyancy
of about 600 pounds. To overcome this
the vessel must be kept moving constantly
when under water, and the diving rud
ders must be kept slightly pitched down
ward to hold the boat on an even keel.
When the vessel stops runnine under
water she will rise to the surface through
her own buoyancy. The Holland has a
bow lorpetto tuhe, for which she will carry
three 75-inch Whiteiiead torpedoes. In
addition, *he Ims an S-inch aerial torpedo
gun in the bow and a submarine gun in
the stern, pointed upward at a slieht
angle. The aerial gun will throw a 100
--pound dynamite cartridge for a mile. The
submarine gun will send its charges
throngn the water for a distance of from
500 to 800 yards, fceiret tests of the Hol
land's capabilities will beuin in al:out two
weeks. When the boat is in good work
ing order 3he will be sent to Washington
under its own power for exhibition to the
naval authorities.

WASHINGTON, D. C. May 17.â The
return of General Henderson of lowa to
Washington has not sullied.. the question
whether the House shall consider the
Nelson bankruptcy bill, recently sent ever
from the Senate, which Bailey, the Dem
ocratic leader, greatly desires. If Hen
derson's convictions in the matter are re
spected nothing will be done this session.
He said:
"I certainly will not consent to the
House undertaking the discussion of a
subject of such great importance as the
bankruptcy bill with a view to enacting a
law thereon without first having it care
fully considered by the proper , commit
tee â the Judiciary. Such a measure is r!
most equal in importance with the tariff
bill, and for the House to go haphazard
into its consideration would be most un
fortunate. This session was convened for
the purpose of providing additional and
necessary revenue for the Government,
and I do not believe the House will un
duly retard the accomplishment of that
purpose. When it is accomplished Con
gress should go home." is?"
There is a division of sentiment among
Republicans on this matter. Some of
them, like Tawney, member of the Com
mittee on Ways and Means from Minne
sota, think the passage of the bankruptcy
bill is necessary to supplement the tariff
bill before prosperity can be expected to
return.

A Hint That Wholesale Advance

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 17.âBriga
dier-General Zmihs R. Bliss 1 , commanding
the Department of Texas, was nominate.!
by the President to-day to be major-gen
eral. Ke will apply for retirement under
the veteran service law when he has been
confirmed. ijfylV. â â 
Brigadier-General John R. Brooke will
be nominated to succeed him, ending the
rapid promotions among the higher offi
cers. It was the intention of tue Presi
dent to compliment some other officers
under an agreement similar to that made
with Forsyth and Bliss, by which they
promised to apply for retirement on secur
ing the coveted advancements, thu- creat
ing vacancies to be hlled by their juniors.
Opposition has developed among army
people, however, to the wholesale system
of retirement and promotions, principally
on the ground that criticism against the
retired list would recur and might event
ually result in securing its abolishment.
The President had in view the promotion
of a number of general officers to an actual
rank equal to their highest volunteer rank,
but he may abandon it.
The nomination and retirement of Gen
eral Forsyth and the immediate appoint
ment of Brigadier-General Bliss as his
successor was pred cted in The Call's
1 dispatches two weeks ago. - General Bliss
will retire immediately upon his confirma
tion and Brigadier-General Brooke will
succeed him. General Coppinger may be
similarly provided lor, and soon alter con
firmation will retire. -
The Army and Navy Register is au
thority for this statement. It intimates
that Coppinger will be the next major
general instead of Brooke, but that Gen
eral Otis is not to be advanced over Gen
eral Brooke. He will be promoted when
General Merritt retires. This programme
was adopted only after careful considera
tion by the President.
President McKinley's motive is highly
commendable, and everything taken into
account, including the fact that the exe
cution of the plan means a number of un
looked-for promotions in all grades of the
army, the arrangement will likely , be ap
proved of "by a larce majority of officers in
the military service. Army promotions is
a.subject to which the President and Sec
retary Alger have eiven much serious at
tention. It is the wish of the President
that every officer in the military service
should attain before retirement the high
est rank to which he was breveted for con
spicuous services during the war, and con
sistently with fairness to all concerned
the President proposes to carry oat this
idea. } t ' :''",. _ ;, ;^;v; ;
Another desire of the President is that
as far as practicable, keeping in mind
justice, all brigadier-generals shall become
major-generals before retirement as a re
ward for long and valuable services. The
President is a firm believer in the princi
ple ol seniority, and will observe this
principle with but few exceptions. In
the cases of the present brigadier-generals
the promotions of Generals Bliss and Cop
pinger (curiously he omitted mention of
General Shaf ter's name when referring to
the prost>ects) would operate as a
temporary hardship to General Brooke,
but that officer under the plan of the
President would be a major-general cer
tainly for over three years, and probably
for more than four years. . _ . - -Vii-
A War Department official, said to-day
that a practical .point was the good that
would result to many deserving officers
who have long waited for promotion. Un.
der the rule three more major-gener
als won d be nominated.. This means, o ,
course, the promotion of three colonels,
three lieutenant-colonels and three second ;
lieutenants, in addition to one officer in
these . grades who, would be advanced as
the result ol the selection of Major-General
Forsyth. The official thought this consid
eration one wbicn the army would attach
importance to when it was. remembered
that in departing from the rule of senior
ity in the case of General Brooke the hard-,
ship to that officer was only. temporary,
and that in making the proposed excep
tions the President .would reward deserv
ing officers who figured conspicuously in
the country's last great war.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Events to Be Contested at the Velo-
drome Next Sunday.
There will be a race meet at the Velo
drome next Sunday, the programme of
which includes a half-mile handicap and
two-thirds of a mile stratch, professional;
a half-mile stratch, amateur, and a match
race between Otto Zipgler Jr. and Allan
N. Jones nt one mile. Tha latter
event should be a great drawing card,
as there ha? been a question of supremacy
between these two riders and their many
lollowers for a long time past. Jones beat
Coulter at the Santa Rosa meet Sunday,
and if he should defeat Z egler could
r ghtly he termed chnmpion of the coast.
This meet is to be conducted by C. N.

BROKER CHAPMAN
IN DURANCE VILE
Enters Upon His Term!
of Thirty Days for
Contempt.
Havemeyer and Searles Get a
Respite and May Escape
Punishment.
Judge Bradley's Acttcn Is Severely
Criticized â Ins and Outs of
Sugar Deals.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 17.â Broker
Chapman, who declined todivnige to the
Senate investigating committee the
names of United States Senators alleged
to have speculated in American sugar
stock and as a punishment was sentenced
to thirty days in the District Jail and to
pay a fine of $100, is now behind irison
bars. His term began this afternoon and
he will be released on June 11, providing
he violates none of the rules of the jail.
Aside from having two of the ben cells
in the jail, having them furnished nicely
at his own expense and being permitted
food prepared under the direction of Man
ager Bennett of the Arlington Hot?l,
Chapman will be treated ]ust as though
lie was an ordinary prisoner.
"I have notbing to say for publication,"
Chapman said, "but during my confine
ment I may write something which may
put this matter in a Droper light."
The trial of Havemeyer and Searies, the
recalcitrant sugar witnesses, was to-day
postponed until Tuesday of next week by
Judge Bradley at the reauest of counsel,
although tlie motion was bitterly opposed
by the District Attorney. It is expected
now that a year will elapse before a final
decision. It took three years to land
Broker Chapman in jail.
There is plenty of adverse criticism here
as to Judge Bradley's action. It looks de
cidedly as though a very strong pull bad
been brought to bear on the court. The
feeling is all the more intensified because
of the charges made by a Now York paper
that certain Senators are now speculating
In sugar regardless of the notoriety at
tached to the Havemeyer, Searies and
Chapman cases.
One of the brokers who could probably
throw considerable light on the dealings
of Senators in Wall street and who per
sonally profited by advance information
on the sugar schedule is Abraham White.
Mr. White has offices at 16 Broad street
and 31 Broadway, New York. He is the
broker who successfully negotiated with
the aid of Russell Sage the purchase of a
million dollars' worth of Government
bonds during the last popular bond sale
on a total investment of 43 cents for pos
tage. He cleared about $200,000 by that
deal.
When the Dingley tariff bill went into
the hands of the Senate sub-committee
Mr. White came to Washington and
opened an office at .1313 F street. Ha
fitted it up in fine style and had a private
wire to New York.
On April 8 his first advertisement ap
peared in the local papers. He did not
stint Himself on space. He made refer
ence in his advertisement to his success
in the bond deal, and in large letters an
nounced that Russell Sage had helped
him to complete that transaction.
It was need that the persons who fre
quented bis office and traded through him
were mostly Senators and Representa
tives be lived in the Arlington Hotel,
where, it will be remembered, the Senate
sub-committee held its secret meeting*.
He was frequently seen coming out of the
room where these secret conferences were
being held, although it was impossible for
any but a few favored Senators and Rep
resentatives to enter this private chamber.

The Distinguish* Lady Will Sojourn
on the Coast. . . â 
Mme. Barrios, wife of the. President of
Guatamela, who arrived here about two
weeks ago, bad expected to leave for the
East about this time, but her physician,
Dr. Joaquin Yella, who with his family
accompanied her here, says Mme. Barrios
is not yet strong enough to undertake the
journey, her health having not been as
good as usual lately. For two or three
days the distinguished lady lias been
compelled to deny herself to all callers.
Her plivs-ician made this imperative.
When Mme. Barrios leaves the coast,
which she may not do for two months,
she will visit Chicago, New York and
other, Eastern cities and will goto Europe.
Her intention for some time past has been
to spend several months in Paris and
other European capitals.
It was learned last night that the

quietly until she goes East. â  .

ANGELS CAMP, Cal., May 17.â The
people of Angels Camp alept but little last
night. Not until a late hour did the
groups of roush rnoumaineers who were
clamoring for the life of Harry Arnett, the
wife murdererand *ould-be suicide, break
up. This morning the excitement had
somewhat subsided, and the authorities
do not apprehend that the threat of a
lynching will be carried into effect for the
reason that Arnett is already close to
death's door.
Arnett is still alive and his surgeon says
if he lives through the night he may
recover, but one bullet passed through

THE CASTRO V/LLE TRAGEDY.
Coroner's Jury Charges Joseph Cole With
the Murder of Mary
Perez.
SALINAS, Cal., May 17.â The inquest
over the ooay of Mary Perrz, who went
for a drive with Joseph S. Cole of Santa j
Rosa last night and returned a corpse, was
held to-day, and a verdict charging Cole
with her murder was returned. A stiong i
network of evidence had been woven :
around the accused man, and it is certain
that he will be held to answer for the |
crime.
The testimony given at the inquest con
firmed the story of the tragedy ai pub
liÂ«heil in The Call to-day. James Stirhns
told or having seen a buggy at 1 :30 o'clock
yesterday at the roadside about a mile
wesi of Castroville. One person was re
clining in the vehicle and another vras 1
leaning against ir. The additional testi- I
mony of E. Z. Brokaw was adduced by j
the Coroner. H* swore that he was re
turning from C-istroville, and as he \
reached the spot in the road previously I
indicated by Stirling, he saw a horse and i
bugjjy standing by the roadside. This !
was at 12:30 o'cloik in the morning. The â 
moon was unobacured and he had a !air â 
view. When near the vehicle he saw a.
light form on the ground, with another
clad in darker garb standing over it. J
WheD he got within twenty feot of them i
he saw that the person on the ground was
n woman, wh > lay in a motionless heap.
He passed on and looked back occasion
a.lv, expecting to see the prostrate iorm
risp from the ground, but it did not.
Drs. Barry and Stafford hnd prepared a
careful and thorough statement of tne re
sult of the autopsy. They agreed that
death did not result from natural causes.
It was the result of external violence, and
strangulation was the mod â  resorted to by
the murderer. Internnl conditions pointed
to this â the congested lungs, the trachea
congested and filled wi:h froth. The
biuiseson tin: chin was found to reach
the bone, while the tissues of the neclc
showed slight siens of violence.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., May 17.â Joseph
S. Cole, un'ler arrest at Salinas on a charge
of the murder of his wife's sister, was at*
rested here by Constable Joe Harveston
last Thursday and turned over to Consta
ble J. W. Chuich of Salinas, whither he
wms taken upon â  charge of failure to pro
vide lor his child. Cole was a teamster,
whose record in the service of Grover &
Co. was of a character to keep him always
employed when he wanted work. Ho was
unruly when drinking, but attentive to
his duties when at work. He was work
ing for Seth X der when arrested, and the
news of his arrest for murder was a sur
prise to his employer.
Stockton'* Municipal Campalan.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 17.âT0-mor
row's municipal election is creating in

fares were filled to-night with knots of
men, nil urging the claims of their favorite
candidates. The issue is a clean-cut one.
It is between the fusion candidates put up
by republicans and Democrats and the
A. P A. ticket, which was christened tho
Citizens' ticket. The American Protec
tive Association ba9 had control of tne
city government for two years, and is
making a desperate effort to retain its
power. It is centering its guns on the
offices of Mayor and Superintendent of

SOON TO LEAVE M ARM'S JAIL.
Colonel Fmnegan's Application to Be De
clared an Insolvent Will He Hsard
on Wednesday.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May 17.â Next
Wednesday Colonel Peter A. Finne
gan win be released from the Marin
County jailâ a pauper in the eyes of the
law. Tne man who has for over six weeks
been a prisoner for not paying $750 to his
wife, Mrs. Emily B. Finne an, who is suing
him for a divorceâ the mau who has ap
pealed to Superior Judge Angelotti to ad
judge him an insolvent debtorâ will on
that day have his accounts adjusted, and
the $750 will be paid from the assets of his
estate.
In his affidavit, filed with County Clerk
ThomasÃonneau, Colonel Finnegan swears
that he has not the sum of $750, nor has he
had any amount of money in excess of
$50 at any time since February 123, when
he was ordered confined in jail for con
tempt of court. Colonel Finnegan alleges
that he has no money or means of support
or maintenance; that he has not the
ability to raise or borrow $750, or any sum
whatever. All the property of the colonel
| has been turned over to Sher.ff Henry
! Harrison, and he further asserts* that he
has not concealed or in any way disposed
of any properly with designs to delay,
hinder or defraud any of his creditors.
I Finneean asks to be discharged from the
custody of the Sheriff and from the County
Jail.
Colonel Finnegan had lived with his two
dauebter3 at the Hotel Rafael, and after
his confinement in the Â» jail be was served
with French dinners from the Parisian
Hotel. Now he swears that ho is indebted
in the sum of over $16,000, and be has a
little over $20,000 with which to settle.
| The Hotel Rafael is owed $1000 for board
| and lodging, and this sum is secured by a
pledge of personal property. C. T. Mc-
Dermott of Oakland is owed $2060 on a
i promissory note, A. B. Spreckels $5000 on
a note and William Lange Jr. $50 on an
open loan. None of these amounts is
i secured. Mrs. Emily B. Finnegan is a
â¢ creditor to the sum of $1050, alimony,
j costs, etc., and this is unsecured. C. C.
j Bern is' notes for $7000 are secured by
| mortgages on the colonel's interest in
! race tract property and the Maloncy
| mine. Total, $1f!,16J. The assets consist
I of property amounting to about $30,000,
I with incurabrancps to the sum of $7000.
j There is money sufficient to pay the order
of court, and this will be settled Wednes
day.
So the man who a few years ago was
"rolling in wealth," visiting foreign
lands and passing the days in pleasure
and sight-seeing is no longer rich.
Colonel Finnegan is stili in the County
Jail in the basement ot the Marin County
Courthouse, wnile his daughters are
occupyine the best apartments in Hotel
Rafael. The wine dinners and the best
food that the Parisian hotel can furnish
are still the prisoner's fare, and the signs
of economy that one looks for in an insol
vent debtor are not visible.
The trial of the divoicj suit, with its
sensational details, will be commenced in
a short time.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1897.
WOODSMEN STRIKE
IN LUMBER CAMPS
Five Hundred Mendo
cino Laborers Re
fuse to Work.
Demand That They Be Paid In
Cash instead of Sixty-
Day Orders.
The Trouble Gives Promise of Ex
tending to Every Mill on
the Coast.
UKIAH, Cal., May 17 âA strike of the
woodsmen in the Fort Bragg and Caspar
woods, on the coast of this county, Is re
ported to-day. On Saturday a man de
manded cash in payment for his labor, re
fusing to accept -sixty-day orders. The
Union Lumber Company and the Caspar
Lumber Company asked until to-day to
consider the matter. To-day they refused
to concede to the demands of their men,
and 500 of the lumbermen walked out.
The corporations claim it is impossible
for them to pay in cash, as their returns
are received in ninety-day paper, and they
say that if the men do not return to work
the mills will be shut and over 1000 men
thrown out of employment.
C. R. Johnson, vice-president of the
Union Lumber Company, passed through
Ukiah tnis rooming en route to Sail Fran
cisco from Fort .Bragg, where he had been
engaged in an attempt to settle thÂ« trou
ble between his company and the strikers.
He made but little progress. It is ciaimed
by the mill managers that the mills have
been run at almost a loss for some time
past and that only a desire to keep their
men in employment induced them to
continue operations. They intend to right
the Santord law to tneend. As soon as
this measure, which provides that work
men shall be paid in cash, went into
effect the men demanded cash payments
under its provisions. After a consulta
tion among the manager* of the lumber
and mill companies it was decided that
they could not afford to comply with the
demand. If all the mills are closed be
tween 4000 and 5000 men will be tnrown
out of employment.
The attorneys of the mill companies de
clare the bill requiring a monthly cash
payment is unconstitutional, inasmuch as
it provides for such payment by incor
porated concerns only, and has no bear
ing on private companies or other busi
ness firms or partnerships.
The law upon which the strikers base
their demand for cash wages, and which
the corporations will attempt to have de
clared unconstitutional, provides as iol
lows:
Section 1. Every corporation doing bnsiness
in this State shall pay, nt least once a month,
each and every employe em ployed by such cor
poration in transacting or carrying on its
business or in the performance of labor for it
the wages earned by such employe during the
preceding month ; provided, however, that if at
ihe time ot payment any emplo}Â© shall be ab
sent or not engaged in his usual employment
he snail be entitled to said payment at any
time thereafter upon demand.
The act further provides that a violation
of this law shall entitle the employes to a
lien upon the property oi the corporation
fur the amount of wages due, and that
such a lien shall take precedence over all
other liens except duly recorded mort
gages or deeds of tru't. No assignment
of future wages shall be mad â  to a cor
poration by the employes tor the purpose
of evading the provisions of this law. For
a violation of this law a corporation is
subject to a fine of not over $100 or less
than $50 lor each offense.
CONTROL OF EDEN VALLEY LANDS.
Mendocino's Public Administrator Given
Charge of the Jsram Colony's
Estate.
UKIAH, Cal., May 17.â Judge Mannon
i to-day rendered his decision in the matter
i of the petition for letters of administra
j tion, and the opposition thereto, on the
estate of Peter J. Jeram, deceased. Let
ters were ordered issued t^> J. H. Barker,
the Public Administrator of this county.
Jeram mas the Catholic priest who i
about a year ago founded a colony at
Eden Valley, in the northern part of this
county, and built the town now Known as
Jeramvilie. Since it was founded, at which
time 500 colonists from all psrts of the
Union were brought to Eden Valley, the
colony has collapsed and nearly all of the
settlers have left the country. At the
time of the purchase of the land on behalf
I of the colonists deeds for the real estate
and bills of sale for the personal property
were taken in the name of Father Jeram,
and at the time of his death the property
of the entire colony was owned, as far as
the records were concerned, by him, al
though the money (o purchase it was sup
plied by the settlors whom he brought to
California.
While en route to Round Valley Jrorn
Edon Valley to attend a etock rodeo on
I May 4, Father Jeram, in company with
[ T. J. Chase, a range rider in his employ,
! attempted to ford EM River, and the
priest was drowned. Subsequently a peti
tion for letters of administration on his
estate was hied by Public Administrator
Barkerof this county, and two days later
a similar petition was filed on behalf of A.
C. Freese, Public Administrator of the
City and County of $an Francisco, both
bsing set for hearing 10-day, ihs former at
this place and the latter at San Francisco.
In the meantime special letters had been
granted to the petitioners by the respec
tive courts in which their petitions had
been tiled, and both Freese's deputy and
Barker repaired to Eden Valley to tate
charge of the properly.
At the hearing before Jndge Mannon
this morning testimony was introduced
by the petitioner tending to show that
Jeram was at the time of his death a no
tary public in and for this county, as
well as Deputy County Clerk. The regis
ter of the Palace Hotel was introduced in
evidence, Jeram having on May 2 regis
tered his name and given his residence as
Eden Valley. Evidence of his occupation
of a room in the Eden Valley Hotel was
also introduced.
Although the opposition introduced no
evidence at the hearing, owing to the fact
that it claimed it was entitled to a con
tinuance, it is said that the ground of the
opposition is that after the collapse of the
colony scheme Father Jeram was called
to fill the po-ition of chaplain of the
Sacred Heart College at San Francisco in
February last, and that lie subsequently
changed his residpnee to that City.
Administrator Barker left for Eden
Valley this afternoon to take full charge
of t'.ib estate, which at this time consists
of about 10,009 acres ot land, 1200 cattle.
50 horses, a large number of ho<;s and
other property, the value of the whole
being estimated at $50,000.
Demand for Haifilngton Cattle.
TACOMA. Wash., May 17.â 1t ia esti
mated that four-fifths of the beef cattle in
Washington, Idaho and Oregon have been
shipped to Chic mo, the core States and
the ranges in Wyoming, Montana and the
Dnkotas since January 1. Buyers from
the corn Btates have been eagerly pur
chasing cattle to eat up their surplus
corn, and have taken advantage of the
necessities of the raisers, wlio have been
short of leed after a hard winter. Local
buyers are now unable to get cattle, ex
cept in small herds. It will take this
State rive years to reach its former pres
tige as a cattle producer. Prices of beef
have gone very high, and cattle and hay
are being imported by steamer from Cali

SUISUN MERCHANT'S DEATH.
Moses Dinkelspiel, Ont of California's
First Settlers, Passes to the
Beyond.
SUISUN, Cal., May 17.â After a painful
illness lasting a little over two weeks,
Moses Dinkelspiel, one of the earliest set
tlers and most influential citizens of thu
county, passed away at 5:30 o'clock this
morning. Tne immediate cause of his
death was erysipelas, but he had been in
declining health for some time, and in
consequence his system was in no condi
tion to withstand the ravages of the
disease.
The deceased waa a native of Gem
mingen, Germany, and was born on OctÂ«
toter 1, 182 C. He came to America in
1848. In 1552 he came to California and
embarked in business with Bernard
Sweitzer, of the firm of Sweitzer & Co.,
of San Francisco, at Campo Seco, which
was then a bustling mining camp. In
1857 he sold out and went to San Fra
ncisco, remaining there nearly a year, and
ti en came to Suisun and in company
with Jacob Frans started a general
merchandise business. For nearly iorty
years he resided here and was prominently
identiiied with every public enterprise
and improvement in the vicinity. Poli
tically ha was one of the Republican
leaders of Solano County, which he rep
resented several times in State Conven
tion. During the '80's he served two
terms as Supervisor of Solano County and
promulgated a system of road building
which has been followed to great a d van .
tsge to the county up to the present time.
In the selection of a non-partisan board of
trustees for the State Normal School at
San Jose Mr. Dinkelspiel was appointed
by Governor Budd, which position he
held up to the time of his death. Among
other positions of trust which be held
was that of vice-president and director of
the Bank of Suisun and director of the
Suisun City Hotel Company. He was one
of the organizers and chartered members
of Suisun Lodge No. 78, I. O. O. F., in which
he retained his membership as well as
that in Suisun Loiitje No. 66 F. and A. M.
The deceased leaves a widow and six
children to mourn his loss. Among the
latter are ex- Assemblyman H. G. W.
Dinkelspiel of San Francisco and E. Din-
Kelspiel, editor of the Solano Republican.
The remains will be taken to San Fran
cisco to-morrow morning for interment,
and the funeral will be held under the
auspices of the Masonic lodge of Suisun.
NOT 'TWIXT DEVIL AND DEEP SEA.
This Oregon Man Found Himself Between
a Mad Bull and Two Wildcats,
but He Still Lives.
CATHLAMET. Or., May 17.â J.T. Lutes
of Skamokawa, while going on a vi:-u to a
neighbor two days ago, was chased by
a mad bull. Lutes took to the woods at
the edge of the pasture and climbed up ,
an o!d broken tree. The bull came charg- !
ing forward and commenced to butt furi
ously against the tree-trunk. Lutes, sit
ting expectantly on a dead branch, thought
he heard somelning inside the tree. He
climbed to the top of the stump, which
was hollow, and, peering down, was con
fronted by the blazing eyes of a couple of
wildcats.
"I realized like a flash," said Lutes in
relating his experience afterward, "that I
was between an infuriated bull and a brace
of wilucais â liable to be gored to death by
the one or clawed to dc.Vth by the other. I
would have traded position: witfc most any
one."
Suddenly Lutes remembered that he
hau a newspaper and some matches in
his pocket. To ignite the paper and
thrust it down the hollow center of the
tree was the work of an instant. The
scheme worKed like a charm. Terrified
by the smoke and flame, tne wildcats beat
ahasty retreat through a hole lower down,
springing straight for the bull. Tne lat
ter animnl, half crazed in t;:rn and bel
lowing furiously, dashed through the
meadow, Jons wildcat striking its claws
into his back, the other clinging to his
hams.
The fact that his flambeau had pet th&
tree on fire suddenly distractrd Lutes'
gaze from the animals, and he descended
and hastened homeward.

Small Catches of Seals.
VICTORIA, B. C. May 17.â An unoffi

from tha ollicial report of spring catches
of schooners engaged in sealing on this

smallest in years. This is accounted for
by the rough weather encountered during
the season. Three vessels were lost â ihe

TO SHUT OFF THE GAS.
The Supervisors Will Be Asked
to Substitute Arc
Lights.
A Superfluity "Which His Become a
Burden en the Business
Men.
Strenuous efforts will be made by the
retail storekeepers over": he greater portion
ol the Ã¼bsiness center of the City to have
the Supervisors substitute arc lights for
the street lamps now in use all over the
City.
During the oast six months the retail
â¢torekeepers on the principal streets of
the City contributed out of their pockets
direct for a display of electric-lights ovar
the center of the streets.
The result of this experiment has proven
satisfactory to the merchants, as it
brought trade during the evenings, where
as when the streets were in a condition ot
eenii-darkncss, with a blurring gasjet
flickering ou the street crossing, peoiile
liesitated to go shopping, have on the
more lrtquented thoroughfares, such as
]\la.rket and Kearny streets.
Poik street beinc the pioneer in this
progressive movement, encouraged others
to ioliow, and all claim that business was
Tastly improved by ihe innovation.
The expense of this additional light was
borne by the storekeepers direct, except
on Third street, where the landlords went
in the pool. Tins aid was the idea of
Bernard Katschinski of the Philadelphia
shoestore, who argued that what bene
fited the storekeepers also benefited the
property-owners. His reasoning was that
property without uroducing an income
was useless to its owner, and if the busi
ness on a street improved the property
was worth so much more to its owner.
And now comes a united front urging
the substitution of electric lights on ail
the business sireets in the orincipal part
of the City, ana the same time the shutting
off of the street pas lamps on such streets
as mitv be lighted by electricity.
L. V. Merle, president of the Sixth
street Improvement Glut), 13 tfa enthusi
ast on this subject and lie will, with tho
members of hi 3 clud, urge such a move
before the Supervisors before the next ap
propriations are made for street lights.
John T. Sullivan, president of the Fourth
street Improvement Club, will co-operate
in this movement.
BJohn Hayden, the pioneer of the arc
Jicht movement on Ninth street, signifies
his intention to join any movement lead
ing to the substitution of electric lights j
for cas lamps ah over the City.
B. Katschinski, president of the Third- !
street Club, will call a meeting of his club i
in ihe near lutur*> for an expression of I
opinion from tbe members as a body. His !
own position on this subject is fully ex- I
pressed in a few words. He said :
"Let us turn on the light all over the
entire City. It wiil be cheaper in tne end
than the present .system of easligh', and
besides it will males .San Francisco pro
gressive and business-iikÂ«. Gas for street !
light is fast as obsolete now as were oii I
lamps fifty rears ajro.
"Tne fcan Francisco people are liberal to
a fault. Just look at ;lie Balbon boule
vard; over $30,000 subscribed in a few
months. Again, ihe people want another
big park nnd a zoological collection
thrown in. "What we want is a Bo:;rd of
Supervisors to work in harmony with the
people. GjvÂ« them good s-treets and
plenty of lijjnt and in a few years the peo- j
pie will be astonished at them.-eives for re
maining so long behind tho age."
The Polk-street club's contract for
electric l:p hts for six months has expired,
end no steps have been taken to renew it,
as the merchants are hopeful that by Ilia
Ist of July the street wilt be lighted at
the expense of the taxpayers.
A similar opinion is entertained by
other clubs whose street-light contracts
are about to expire.
A determined movement will he made
to have tho Supervisors take action on
this matter nei; month.
WAS CHRIST A MYSTIC?
Mrs liesant's Lait Lecture Compares
Chrixtlanitv AVitli TheoÂ«i<iphyâ How
the ' avior Taught Ills Ajiostleg.
Mrs. Annie Besant wfta not erected last
night in Metropo.itan Temple with that
audience in point cf numbers to which
the merit of her lecture entitled her, but,
though small, it was intellectual, and,
Judging from the frequent applause, it
\vn-i weil developed thf-osophically.
Mrs. Bssant was attirjd in a loosely fit
ting robe of white silk. Her appearance
on the platform. was greeted with a round
of hand-clapping. Before beginning her
lecture she announced that the Brama
charm wouM remain here during the
summer and would give a series of lec
tures on tlieosophr.
There was nothing in theosophy, she
said, that was entirely new. This science
of the soul does not n quire men and
women to accept anything on faith, but
affjrJs its disciples every opportunity for
investigation. It had been Â«aid that the
masses found themselves confused by the
comilexityof theosophic teachings; that
it was fitted only for the educated classes,
and that in order to fit those two classes
the doctrine was divided into two parts,
esoteric and exoteric theosophy.
There was no idea duripg the early ages
of Christianity that all the most secret
truths of religion were to be thrown broad
cast without discrimination. The distinc
tion between public and secret teaching
was laid down by Christ, "Give not that
which is holy to the dogs, neither cftst you
your pearls "belore swine." The Jews used
this name 'Yogs" to apply to everybody
ou'sjde of the seed of Abraham.
Thus Jesus, when he spoke in public,
spoke in parables, and when the people
demanded an explanation he did not give
it to them, but he gave it to his apostles
when they were in private.
This custom of secret teaching was fol
lowed in the early days ot the Christian
church. Oij. r en says that Jesus gave a
very profound exphination of the parades
to those who had passed beyond the stage
of exoteric tenching, and it is claimed
that those explanations of Jesus were
handed down by word of mouth, and it is
said that the teachings which Christ gave
the apostles during the forty fays after
the resurrection were also hande-t down
by word of mouth.
These secret teachings were those wnich
enabled people to separate the soul from
the tody, to stand face to face with the
hisher grades of bring, to learn all those
inner verities, without which religion
loses its foundation, its strength and its
influence over the hearts and consciences
of men.
The speaker defined prayer as a com
mand unto the invisible world which will
be obeyed by tho-e intelligent beings who
catch the thought and tone of the prayer,
and will carry it to one who is charitably
disposed, when the prayer is for aid.
Prayer according to the theosophical Idea
is t lie upward aspiration of the soul to
God.
The ordinary Christian uses the terms
'soul" and "spirit" in the same sense.
But they are not the came. The Apostles
taught that man is the temple of God.
That also is the teaching of theo.-ophy.
Christ is the type of ttie developed soul
evolving life after lite until the soul has
reached its manhood, and here theosophy
nnd Christianity teach exactly the same
thing. Theosophy teaches that the soul
is to unite with the spirit and by uniting
there will be union with God, which every
reiision has taught. Christ prays that his
disciples may become one in him and he
one in us.
The speaker closed with an allusion to
incarnation and the deeper truths of theos
ophy.

PLEASURE MARRED
BY AN ACCIDENT
Delegate Horton of the
Conductors' Order
Loses a Foot.
Falls From the Platform of an
Excursion Coach Near
Los Angeles.
<
Business Session's of the National
Convention Are Drawing to a
Close.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 17.â
business sessions of the conductors' con
vention were resumed to-day and the
pleasure of the visitors who are not dele
gates continued uninterruptedly. The
routine this afternoon was varied by the
presentation of an elegant silken banner
to the Grand Division 38 a token from the
Los Angeles conductors. The guerdon
was given by W. D. Perkins, delegate of
Los Angeles Division No. 111. with an ap
propriate speech, to which Grand Chief
Conductor Â£. E. Clark made a happy re
sponse. The pleasing incident took up
but a few minutes of the time of the con
vention, and weightier matters were again
considered.
Over 400 of the visitors to-day made a
trip around (he kite-shaped railway, stop
ping fifteen minutes at Rediands and two
hours at Riverside, where they weregi7en
a drive on Magnolia avenue and hospita
bly treated by citizens.
As the train was coming back to this
city this evening the first unpleasant in
cident of the convention occurred. While
passing Ballona Junction, M. J. Horton,
a memoer of Los Angeles division, was
standing on the platform of a coach when
his hat was blown off by the wind. Mr.
Horton, in trying to catch the nat, lost
his balance and fell to the track. His left
foot was caught by a wheel and cut off at
the ankle. The unfortunate man was
brought to the Sisters Hospital in this
city, where he is resting in care of his wife
and brothers of the order. The accident
cast a gloom over the excursionists.
To-morrow a large crowd will go to San
Diego, a $1 round trip rate being made for
the conductors. A great many of the
Eastern visitors are counting on having a
good time visiting San Francisco on their
way Dome. A large party started for the
north by the regular train this evening,
and more will follow to-morrow, after the
business of the convention is concluded.
The Lilies' Auxiliary had a business
meeting to-day, but it was not largely at
tended, most of the delegates being out
with the excursion party. As one result
of this biennial meeting of the auxiliary
more divisions are to be formed in this
State before th 6 next meeting, two years
hence, the purposes of the organization
havng been put forward in a way to con
vince conductors' wives of the urgency of
their co-ope ation in the work.
It being a foregone conclusion that the
present officers of the conductor*' order
are to be re-.-lecied, the only contest ex
pected at to-morrow's business meeting
will be over the choice of a , city to be
honored by the "ext convention of the
order. Either St. Paul or Detroit will win
the prize.
The long-delayed Pennsylvania special,
with about 400 passenger* on board, has
succeeded in running the blockade near
El Paso and started westward at 2 p M.
to-day. It' is expected that the train will
arrive here between 5 and 6 r. m. to
morrow. Aboard are a number of promi
nent railroad officials who were once con
ductors and yet retain their membership
in the order. They will be met by the
brethren here witn great manifestation of
joy, which may soothe the feelings of the
passengers who had so dreary a time at
El Paso.
O.ie vcrv important subject to be dis
posed of in the business meeting of the
Grand Division to-morrow will be a three
sided contest over the location of head
quarters of the order of Railway Con
ductors. The general offices of the order
are now and have for years been at Cedar
Rapids, lowa, but the conductors have for
some time felt 'the desirability of re
moving to some larcer city. Chicago and
Cleveland are offering inducements to
have the headquarters removed to those
cities, and the contest in the convention is
expected to be lively.
It is said that delegates representine
Chicago's interests have come with a cer
tified check for $100,000 to be given to the
order to secure the location of head
quarters in that city, though the condi
tion! regulating the gift are not now
known. Cleveland wants the prize so
badly that an inducement of several
years' free rent i* offered, and the banks
there offer to pay 4 per cent interest on
the daily balances of the order's financial
account. As the monthly balance of the
insurance department amounts to from
$25,000 to $40,000, the matter of interest
on deposits cuts quite a iicure. The
banks at Cedar Kapids cannot afford such
interest.
Tne fact that Cedar Rapids is a small
city is against it, in the opinion of the
conductors who favor either Cleveland or
Chicago. The ( headquarters of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers are
at Cleveland, and that is another point in
favor of that city.

The all-absorb nz topic among the local
members of this order just at this time is the
twentieth anniversary celebration of the
founding of the order, which event will be
observed this year In a particular and some
what elaborate manner, if indications count
Jor anything.
Early in April the movement for a celebra
tion was set on foot and a general committee
composed of members from all the councils
was appointed, Argonaut Council and Go den
West of this City being among those who wero
early identified with it.
Tne local committee of arrangements have
now completed all their plans, and on the
evening of May 20 the order will observe the
Royal Arcanum anniversary in Native Sons'
building, this City.
Souvenir programmes from special design
will be issued to all who may desire them.
Over 2000 invitations have already been dis
posed of, and everything points to a large at
tendance.
The programme will consist of nn overture
by select string and brass band; remarks,
"Welcome," Regent Gcorne W. Dixou; bary
tone solo, Mr. Grodgens; soi:g, selected. Mny
Clover; address -'The Royal Arcanum,"

after which the floor wi il be cleared for danc
ing. Hat and co.ik rooms, without charge,

Old FriÂ«nd*' Day
The installation of the officers of the Society
of Old Friends, elected on the 12th, will take
place on the evening of the 26th Inst. The
society will give a clambake at Bausmito next
Sunday and the baking of the clams will be

Golden Gate Lodge of the P. B. O. I .
The society which is known by the nance of
Golden Gate Lodge No. 0, P. B. O. E. (incorpo
rated) will give an entertainment and ball in
Oda Fellows' Hall 10-morrow evening in aid of
its charity fund. The committee that has
charre of tiii-; Junction announces that it has
prepared an interesting programme.
Liibel Trials Postponed.
The second charge of libel pending agninst
Frederick Marriott, edi;or of the News Letter,
has been set down for trial on the 27th inst.
At the samo time the libel cases against
Thomas S. Williams Jr., George B. Connnt,
Benjamin Lucy, A. L. ( asavan. F. H.Qualman,
A. P. Kendall and T. H. McCarthy will be
called. In view of the fa-^t that the strongest
case ol the lot was conceded to be the first
charge against Editor Marriott, and as he was
triumpnantly acquitted, therj ssems to be no
possibility of securing a conviction. It is
pr<->Dable tiiHt District Attorney Rarnes -will
decide to spare the City's treasury and will
order d^mii-sal of the suits now pending.
Be Mysterious Echo
: .
Don't ever get weak, for if you do
you may be the victim of the Myste-
rious Echo. There is a certain class
of men who begin by having ringing
sounds in the ears. This is followed
by peculiar noises in the head, and
then comes thei Mysterious Echo. '
This echo is unlike the mountain, â 
echo, for the" noise is entirely
changed. Men who have lived lives
of recklessness, of dissipation or of
abuse soon find themselves in a con-
dition of weakness that is indeed
horrible. Besides the noises in the
head, the spots before the eyes, the
steam-like vapor that goes through
the body, the sweats of night, the
lost unmanly visions, and the first
break of day brings this poor fellow
to his senses. He realizes at last
that having misused himself, he has â¢
wrecked his manhood. â¢
To such men a reliable treatment is
offered by the greatest known doc-
tors. This treatment cures all those
conditions which ultimately lead to
complete failure .of manhood, to
premature conditions, to impotency.
HUDYAN'is a great remedy-treat-
ment, and it will do for you just
what you want. You should consult
the Hudson Medical Doctors about

Supervisors Make Sweep
ing Changes at the
City Hall.
RAINEY'S MEN TURNED
OUT.
Twenty One Democrats and One
Republican Received the
Piums.
HASKINS' ANTI-CIGARETTE OB
DIN ANCE.
He Would Totally Prohibit the Sale
of the Insidious Ro'lsâ The
Eoni Vv. s Insufficient.
Sam Rainey, the Bush-street boss, re- |
ceived a jolting yesterday at the bands of i
the Board of Supervisors that has thrown ;
. bis camp into confusion and his frightened !
and astonished followers are wondering \
who next will pay the penalty for having
marched under his banner.
It has been rumored for several days
that a new combination had been formed
in the board by tak ng in members who
hod heretofore been undecided and it was
expected that changes would follow, but
few were piepared for the general house- ]
Cleaning that was inaugurated. Some of '
the outs were innocent of all knowledge i
of their danger until the board was |
actually in session, and then they left their
posts to try to stave off their dismissal, |
bat in vain.
The combination had but one active j
opponent and he talked and tried to block j
the proceedings more because he wanted j
to go on record and get a chance to pour j
hot shot into those who were turning his
friends out than for any other reason. In
ali twenty-two of the men appointed by
the present board soon Â»f.er going into i
office were sent out into the cold world j
jobless, and twenty-two others were made j
triad by being placed in positions to live '<
off public pap. The hatchet traveled i
from Police Court, prosecuting attorneys
and clerks to janitors and elevator nun.
The only active opponent to the
changes was Supervisor Briti, who said ;
that good Democrats had been appointed ;
originally and ought to be allowed to re- ;
main. He prolonged the proceedings in !
every possible way by motions, amend- !
ments, substitutes and other subterfuges j
until ruled oft of order by Mayor Phelan j
on the ground that he was intentionally j
*-^-l:<y:n{. matters and without good reason. ,
He "was feebly supported by Supervisors j
Clinton and Morton, tut the macnine had i
its way, and aside from an occasional '
chance where a personal friend or obliga
tion was involved Supervisors Devany, j
Haskins, Deianey. Sheehan, Dodge, Lack- |
man, Rottanzi, Smith and Rivers voted j
together and created vacancies by letting
out the following:
Charles J. O'Callagan, Prosecuting Attorney
01 Police Court 3, by a vote of 10 to 2.
John Foley. clerk of Police Court 2, vote 9 'â

FOOD COFFEE.
A LITTLB HORSE
Seme and It Lands Home.
If a man would give his high-bred horse
day after day a coucoction to drinK that
was a certain detriment to digestion, and
t.'iat slowly poisoned the stomach, liver
and nerves, he would be considered a
detin.te fool by all knowers. Some men's
bodies are worth as much as that of a
good horse. In the isolated cases where
tli.s fact seems clearly established it
would be the part of good, cool judgment
and plain, every-day common-sense to
give such a body as fair treatment as one
would to the horse, particularly when it
is remembered that with a good physical
body kepi in health and strength man can
do thing-'.
There is quite as great a contrast be-
tween the worth of a well man and a sick
.one as between a well horse and a foun-
dered oid wrect, to say nothing of the
"feelins oi the critter" in either case.
. Blind to the cause of his physical ails,
man (and woman too) persists day after
day in pouring into tne protesting body
a liquid drug called coffee, known by all
chemists and physicians to contain the
same poisonous alkaloids as lourni in
strychnine, morphine, whisky and to-
bacco, and to require a powerful constitu-
tion to withstand. The weak ones sink
Under the insidious drag daily adminis-
tered and seldom snow enough to spot
tl:eir enemy. "How do we know coffee is
the enemy?" some ask.
Let tfje little spark of common-senÂ«e
flash again, and direct that coffee be ieft off
for ten days. You may not get entirely
well in that time, my impatient friend.
You would like to ride downhill for sev-
eral years and climb back in lOdays, but
you must let the little spark Hash again.
The quickest way to get up the hill oi
healtn is by the royal road of gooi food
and nourishing drink.
After a long line of experiments looking
to the production of a health coffee, the
Postom Cereal Co., Lim., of Battle Creek,
Midi., perfected "Postum" by a skiilful
treatment of the healthful grains, and
Postum now stands as a liquid foud-drink
of great value, while it cannot be distin-
guished Irom the choicest coffee in its
color, and the taste is such that it is
easily mistaken for Mocha coffee. Its in-
troduction into tne home means that
adults and children can have all the en-
joyment of coffee nnd daily add to their
oodiiy Health by the addition of just so
much nourishment in palatable form as
the mire grains of the field contain. "It
makes red blood" is the trademark, and
the rosy tinge of health attests tb6 trutn
Of the statement.
There is but one gen tiiue original Postara
Cereal coffee, wkh a multitude of imita-
tions offered as "just as good."

vices to the City government.
Supervisor Haskins introduced an ord>r
which he expects to work much good in
the community if adopted, prohibiting
the sale of cigarettes in this City. The
order, which was referred to the Judiciary
Committee, reads as follows:
order NO. .
Relating to cigarettes or certain substances en
closed or covered by paper wrappers and
known as cigarettes, the use of which is in
jurious to health and causes vice and crime.
Tne people ot the City and County of San
Francisco do ordain as follows:
Section 1. As injurious to health and as a
causation of vice and crime it shall be unlaw
ful for any tabacconist, saloon-keeper, or any
employe thereof, or any person whatever, to
sell, barter, exchange, give away, dispose of or
deliver to any person in the City and County
oi San Francisco any cigarettes or substances
enclosed or covered by paper wrappers and
known as cigarettes, or any combination of
paper, tobacco and extract of opium enclosed
or covered by paper of whatever color or tex
ture and known as cigarettes.
Sec. '-. Any person violating the provision of
this order shall be deemed guilty of a misde
meanor and be punished by a fine not exceed
ing jfSOO or by imprisonment not exceeding

ment.
The Public Bnildincs Committee filed a
report censuring the contractors for the
Hall of Jus; ice, Bateman Bros., for their
delay in beginning work on the structure.
Supervisor Clinton gave notice that at
the next meeting of the board he would
offer a resolution that permits be granted
for but one boxing exhibition each
month.
The PeorVs Mutual Telephone Com
pany recently filed a bond of $5000 to
secure the City against loss by reason of
tearing up the streets while the corpora
tion was laying conduits. The expert of
the board reported that the sureties were
insufficient. The clerk was instructed to
inform the company that a new bond
must be riled.
Supervisor Clinton stated that the
final report of the Water Committee, fix
ing water rates for the coming year, would
probably be filed at the next meeting. He
apologized lor the delay in the matter,
statin- that it had been a long and
tedious job to get the in:ormation neces
sary to arrive at a decision. ;
A . resolution offered., by Supervisor
Ilottanzi. requesting the opinion of the
City and County Attorney, as to whether
or not the board has the power to regu
late the compensation paid copyists in
: the Recorder-; office, was adopted.
Tne City pays 12 cents a folio for copy
ine, and receives but 10 cents from those
who record documents. Many of the
papers are printed form?, needing only
the tilling in of names and dates, but they
are charged just as though they were
copied in full.

gibbon of the Board of Health were each
, granted sixty days' leave of obsence with

couid be definitely settled until this mat-:
ter was in shape.
E. M. and J. E. Galvin requested per
mission to begin suit in the name of the
City and County againÂ«t E. S. Palmer to

The petition alleged that the deed had
been procured from the City by lraud, mis
representation and deceit.
Dr. Rottanzi's high hat ordinance was
finally passed to print, after the author

headgear.
A resolution instructing the clerk of the

"NAT" IN A NEW ROLE.
The Actcr Revives "Garrick,"
an O.d Robertsonian
Comedy.
Bright Music in "Captain Fr.-cassa."
"A Glimpse of Paradise"-*'Â£ast
LynDe."
N. C. Goodwin was greeted by almost
aa large an audience at the Baldwin The
! ater last n.ght as the one that applauded
farewell to the De Wolf Hoppers on bat
} urday.
The play last night was Tom Robert
j son's comedy, "David Garrick," in which
| Goodwin made his first Pan Francisco ap
j pearance. The title role is one which has
tempted many famous actors, and in es
saying it the comedian naturally chal
lenged comparisons with his predecessors.
Garrick is a part after Goodwin's own
heart in one resiectâ it depicts the sor
rows of a true lover who is mis-judged ana
comes within an ace of losi ng the woman
he wants to marry. Goodwin's imperson
ation of Davit; Garrick made a distinct hit
with the audience. It was humorous iv
the lighter scenes, and in the scene where
be pretends to be drunk in order to dis
illusionize Ada Ingot, Garrick entered
with vivacity into the spirit of the situa
tion.
With all hi? cleverness it must be con
fessed, however, that when compared
with such a David Garrick as that the
elder Sothern presented Goodwin fell
short, boih in polish and appearance. He
has not the easy grace of an ideal David
Garrick, and neither his form nor face is
picturesque enough to make the idea
plausib!e tliat a beautiful, romantic girl
could ?al! in love with him from across
the footlights, as Ada Ingot is supposed
to do. However, if not an ideal perform
ance, Goodwin's David Garnck is effective
and will no doubt go oi. pleasing his au
diences.
Maxine Elliott looked beautiful as ever
I ana acted unusually well as Ada Ingot.
The refinement of her manner makes her
well qualified for drawing-room comedies
of the Kobertscnioo school.
Goodwin's support has undergone an
improvement. William lngersoll, who
played Squire Chivy, did a drunken tcene
so weli that ne almost snared honors with
the star, and Neil O'Brien was clever and
effective as Ada's father. The people who
played the Smiths and Browns of the cast
had evidently been injudiciously incited
to burlesque the vulgarity of Mr. Ingot's
visitors from the city of Lonaon. They
so exaggerated the idiosyncrasies touched
by Robertson with a gentle hand that they
almost turned Mr. Ingot's borne into the
temporary abode of vaudeville.
The performance concluded with a
comedietta, "The Silent System. "
At the Aicazar.
Last night the patrons ot the Alcazar were
given "A Glimpse of Paradise." It is a comedy
by J. J. Dulley, full enough oi funny compile*
tions to suit even the most exacting of audi
ences. Hugo Toland has certainly the queer
est ideas of what a Frenchman should be. He
sports the fiercest mustaches, wears the most
astonishing of neckties, and in addition to all
this richness he adopts an accent surely never
spoken by any one but a stage Frenchman.
However, much may he forgiven him consider
ing that he gets most of the laughs in the
play. Charles Wineate plays Adolphus Dovl,
a poet who is a miniature of Gilbert and Sulli
van's Buntnorne and Archibald, the Allright.
Adele Belgarde and Mrs. Bates do the parts
allotted them in clever style.
"The First Born," Francis Powers' new play,
met with as much enthusiasm as it did the
first week, and on every hand were words oi
praise for the clever work of the young play
wright.
At the Tlvoll.
"Captain Frncassa," Dellinger's comic opera
in three acts, received its initial production in
this City at the Tivoli Opera-house last even
ing. The book, which is by Genee and Zell, is
founded on a historical romance of Gautier's
and possesses all that rich coloring and elab
orate incident necessary for the successful
librettist.
The music is rftther above the average comic
opera score and excels rather in the concerted
than tne solo numbers. The Tivoli manage
ment has taken unusual pains in the mount
ing of "Fracasss," and the ballet in the second
act is a happy version of Henderson's old
Pierrot ballet.
"Captain Fracassa" calls for all the Tivoli
favorites in the cast. Hnrtman, Rnys
Thomas, Raffael, Laura Mlllard, Elvia Crox
Seabrooke and Myru Morella each finds a con
genial part.
At Morosco's,
â¢â¢Time cannot wither nor custom stale," so
it wcuM seem, that tear-compelling drama,
"East Lynne." Last evening it was received
at Morosco's with all the fervid enthusiasm
worthy a brand-new production. The gentler
portion of the audience wept copiously
through the harrowing scene?, and strong,
bearded men were seen to furtively brush
away the tears that would gather and obscure
the vis-lon.
Maud Edna Hull, the favorite Morosco lead
ing lady, made her reappearance after a pro
tracted absence as Lady Isabel, the meek and
erring heroine. The applause and flowers
wntch greeted her first entrance testified to
the appreciation of her audience. Her Lady
Isabel was womanly, delicate, yet strong, and I
showed conclusively that she possesses unusual I
emotional powers.
Mortimer .Snow was too se'.f-conscious to in
vest Archibald Carlisle with the necessary dig
nity the part demands, and Jonn J. Pierson !
mnde of Sir Francis Levison a self-satisfied i
Prig.
Tne play was handsomely mounted, and
judging by the large first night audieuce will
enjoy a prosperous week's run.
At the Orpheum.
At the Orpbeum last night several new
claimants for fuvor made their bows to a San i
Francisco andienee. The star number on the
bill, the Osrani burlesque pantomime com
pauy, was decidedly disappointing. The act
was rather too broad for even an Orpheum
audience, and all In all it was about the most
tiresome show of the Kind the Orplieum has
ever produced. The Baggesins are really
clever aud scored an empnatic hit. I>o-Mi-
Soi-Do, a team 01 eccentric musical artists,
also created a favorable tmpression. Guille,
the littlo tenor, is as great a tavorite as ever,
but he has lately auopted a most aunoying <
habit of talking to the orchestra during the
preludes In his songs. It may be that he
thinks he is adapting himself to his surround
ings, but he only succeeds in lowering his
dignity as a first-class artist.
At the Chutes.
The Chutes are as popular as ever and the
open-air entertainiaents every afternoon and
evening are well attended. To-night the first
o.' a series of skating races between Joe Wald
stein, champion of the Pacific Coast, and
Charles H. Johnson, champion of San Fran
cisco, will ttke place. The distance i* a mile
and the remaining races will take place Thurs
day and Saturday evenings. The menagerie is
becoming quite a feature of the Haight-street
grounds.
Columbia Theater.
The second week of "Excelsior Jr." opened
last night. There was a fair-sized house and
some new songs and jokes introduced into the
performance were weil received.
ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE.
It Holds Â» Meeting and Lays Out Plant
â¢ f. of- Work.
The California Anti-Saloon League met
at the Y. M. C. A. building at 2 p. m. yes
terday, the Hon. S. W. Fergusson presid
ing. The committee on the itinerary of
Dr. Howard Russell reported that the

pared and that the rest of the journey
Kill soon be laid out.
Dr. Russell is expected to spend ten
days in Southern California, ten days in
the center of the State and ten days

munication from the good-citizenship j
committee of the Golden Gate Union of
Christian Endeavorers, offering 'their ser
vices and inviting a speaker of tne Anti-
Saloon League to its regular meeting, was
read and the proposition was accepted. I
Dr. Bevier was appointed a delegate to I

SCORED DEUPREY'S
"FIENDISH" ATTACK
Baptist Ministers Indignant
at Slurs on Pastor
Gibson.
" The Attorney Should Be Made
to Answer," Says Rev. M.
P. Eoynton.
Rev. S. S Cryor Denounces Professor
Lloyd's Unorthodoxy at the
Presbyterian Uni<n.
The Baptist Ministers' Union was turned
into a reenlar indorsement meeting of
Rev. J. George Gibsoa yesterday. Indig
nation at Attorney Deuprey's attacks on
the pastor of Emmanuel Church was ex
pressed on ail hands, and vigorous mo
tions of indorsement and sympathy for
Mr. Gibson were unanimously passed.
The Christian ministers were present at
the meeting, as they had been invited to
hear a paper by Rev. O. C. Miller, on
"The Gospel That We Preach."
At the conclusion of the paper, Rev. M.
P. Boynton drew attention to what he
j called "the tiendish attacks" of Attorney
Deuprey on Pastor Gibson. "I tmnfc Mr.
Deuprey should be made to answer for
these attacus," said Mr. Boynton. Rev.
1 Dr. Dietz at once jumped to his leet, mi
i dorsing everything Mr. Boynton had said,
and a general discussion followed, in
which Durrant's attorney was unani
mously scored.
It was finally resolved that Rev. M. P.
Boynton and the Rev. Dr. Dieiz should
j be appointed a committee to bear the
! sympathy of the meeting to Pastor Gib
j son. In order to make the condemnation
of Deuprey more vigorous, however. Dr.
J. Sunderland and Rev. W. H. Latourette
were iinally added to the committee, with
instructions to frame resolutions for pub
lication. The following resolutions were
finally adopted :
In view of the recent reflections and insinua
tions by Attorney Deuprey Â«nd a daily paper
of Alameda against the character of J. George
Gibson, a member of ihis body, we therefore.
! the Baptist Ministers' Union of San Francisco
and vicinity, make the following expression :
Firstâ Thai Mr. Gibson has been in our min
istry in California lor several years and has in
every place borne an unblemished reputation.
His character ftas stood among us from be
ginning to end without the slightest stain.
Second â In the unfortunate and awful
tragedy which occurred in the church bniid
! Ing of which he was pastor, he has been
brought under trials, the depth of which uo
man can measure, but in them all he hus
borne himself with great consistency and for
titude, and in such a manner as to draw to
hinisef ihe deepest sympathy and fullest con
' fidence of his brethren of this union, and, we
believe, of all Christian people who Know the
! facts.
Thirdâ We regard the insinuations and at
tacks made upon him as utterly without
erounii, basely malicious anl diabolical, and
in the name of fairness and justice we protest
against these attacks and insinuations.
Fourthâ lt is the desire and hope of this
body that Pastor Gibson will see his way clear
to continue his pastorate of Emmanuel
Church.
Fifthâ That Rev. M. P. Boynton and Rev. H.
L. Dietz are hereby appointed a committee of
this toiy to coivey to Brother Gibson our
I deepest sympathies in these repeated and ag
gravated trial* and our entire confidence in
his Christian ana ministerial character.
Sixthâ That we request the daily papers of
San Francisco to publish this ai-tion.
S. C. Keetch, President.
W, F. Binney, Secretary.
The committee, of which Rev. M. P.
) Boynton is chairman, will formally pre
sent the resolutions to Pastor Gibson this
morning.
Professor Lloyd of the Pacific Theologi
cal Seminary is the latest Congregational
minister to be accused of unortnodoxy.
The attack on the professor's div nitv was
made yesterday morning in a paper read
j by Rev. Dr. Cryor before the Presbyterian
I Ministerial Union.
Dr. Cryor's subject was "The Second
I Coming ol the Lord," but incidentally he
severely censured some 01 Professor
Lloyd's teachine at the Presbyterian Sum
mer School held last week in the Y. M.
C. A. building. Professor Lloyd was ac-
I cused of being both unscriptural and un
historical, and in the discussion which
I followed no one said Dr. Cryor nay.
Rev. Richard G. Hoods made an ear
| nest appeal at several of the meetings
! for ministers to asfc their congregations
for aid to send the corn to the starving
people of India.
At the Congregational Ministers' Club
yesterday Rev. J. P. Dixon read a paper
on the "Want of Emphasis."

The'tssk before the California delega- j
tion at Washington is to recover the Ding
ley rates on prunes and raisins without
losing a firm hold on the Senate rates on
citrus truits. It will be a case of holding
on with one hand and righting with the
other, but the issue at stake is worth the
struggle.
The bill for the relief of American citi
zens in Cuba would have been passed as
promptly in the House as in the Senate if
it had not been for Democratic obstruc
tion. The country, therefore, has another
illustration of the need of such a man as
Tom Reed in the chair to conduct busi
ness at all in the face of such opposition
as Democracy makes.
One of the unexpected results of the in

never realizes how fast he Is going, and no
one with less authority than a policeman
can arrest his attention and make him
think of it.
The fight over the tariff in the Senate
â¢will be directed mainly against the rates
fixed on sagar, wool, hides ana beer. The i
California contest will be to restore the
Dingley rates on prunes aud raisins,
while retaining those of the Senate on
citrus fruits. As ihe Republicans have
not a clear working majority in tha Sen
ate, a genuine Republican tariff will be
impossible. We shall have to be content
with a compromise measure, but the
Western men should be careful to see
that equal concessions are mada on both
fides. We must not give everything for
nothing.
The statement made at the Cuban mass
meeting it Washington that Cleveland's
Assistant Secretary of State bad written
to a Consul in Cuba, "I advise you to
make your reports hereafter less favorable
to the Cuban insurgents, as this adminis
tration desires to avoid all possible fric
tion with the Spanish Government," is
one that should be speedily investigated.
Jf such instructions were really sent to
our Consuls in Cuba it would seem that
during the Cleveland regime the Spanish
Minister at Washington must have been
as potent at the State Office as Secretary
Olney himself.
According to a recent Parliamentary re
port, the amount of money paid into
"chancery" during the year ending Feb
ruary, 1896, amounted to nearly $80,000,-
COO. This, added to the balance on band
at the beginning of the year, made a truly
grand total of $383,842,283. The exact part of
this huge sum which could be describeJ
as unclaimed is not revealed, but no less
than $11,649,110 has been appropriated to
various governmental needs on the sup
position that no successful suits to recover
it will ever be brought. It will be teen
the chancery business is a pretty rich
pudding, and the British G ivrnmeut
gets no â¢mall plum out of it.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
In his aessace on Cuban affairs the
President asks simply for a grant of
money from Congress for the relief of
American citizens resident in the island
who have been made destitute by the war.
Such an appeal should have met with no
opposition whatever, and notwithstanding
the well-known capacity of the Democrats
for blundering, the country will note with
surprise that the entire Democratic vote
in the House, led by Bailey of Texas, de
i liberateiy interposed objections to an im
mediate consideration oi the bill, and thus
postponed action on it until nsit Thurs
day.
The tone of the President in asking for
tins relief is studiously moderate. If he
had been requesting aid for the sufferers
i from the Mississippi 9oods his words
i could not have been freer from even a
suggestion of offense to Spain. He begins
by reciting that official information from
our Consuls in Cuba establishes the fact
that a larsre number oJ American citizens
in the bland are in a state of destitution,
suffering from a want of food and medi
cines. Ho adds that the agiicultural
classes have been forced into the towns,
where they are without work or money,
and goes on to say ihat the local authori
ties of the several towDs, however kindly
disposed, are unable to relieve the needs
of their own people, and are altogether
powerless to help our citizens.
This straightforward appeal, so simple
in its terms, met with an immediate re
sponse from the Senate. Within less than
an hour from the time the message was
read a resolution appropriating $50,000
had bean drawn up, reported to the Wen
ate and adopted unanimously. It is to
be regretted that an equal promptness was
not shown in the House. Bailey, how
ever, saw, or thought he saw, an oppor
tunity for party advantage and at once
declared he would object to an immediate
consideration of tne measure unless it
were amended by including in it the Mor
gan resolution recognizing the belliger
ency of the patriots.
By this action of the Democratic leader
and his party followers a simple measure
of relief for our destitute countrymen in
Cuba is bound up with a wholly different
question and postponed as indefinitely as
tha Democrats can do it. The country
will note the proceeding with something
more than its usual impatience at Demo
cratic blundering. In this cass there will
be indignation as well as impatience. The
people will gladly hail a proclamation
conceding belligerent rights to the
Cubans, and even more gladly a recogni
tion of the independence of the island,
but that is no reason why we should leave
our own citizens in the island to suffer
from destitution until such time as it be
j comes advisable to deal with the broader
| issue.
The message in itself is a most com
mendable one. President McKinley has
already shown himself a master of the
high art of saying much in a few words and
ending when he has said it. His nies
j sages so far have been models of lucidity
I and terseness, and the country has begun
i to regard him as one of the clearest
| thinkers, writers and speakers tbat ever
I sat in the Presidential chair.
A GOOD MOVE,
The real estate men of Santa Clara
County have recently held a meeting in
San Jose for the purpose of forming an
organization to be known as the Santa
Clara County Real Estate Association.
The objects sought for in the new move
ment are to provide a uniform method of
transacting business, to promote harmony
of effort arnon^ real-estate dealers and to
encourage the investment of capital and
the settling of home-seekers in the county.
The movement, while directly in the
interest of the real-estate dealers, will be
indirectly beneficial to ail classes ol peo
ple. Santa Clara, like so many other sec
tions of California, has been largely in
jured in the past and her advancement
hindered by divisions and dissensions
among her own people. The struggle for
personal pre-eminence in all undertakings,
which is so characteristic of Americans,
has been carried to excess in California
! and has not infrequently become what in
the emphatic language of the time is
known as "cutthroat business."
We have seen the ill-effects of these
keen rivalries in every department of our
energies. They are to be noted in poli
tics, ia commerce, in manufacture and
j not infrequently have been seen in the
struggles of rival municipalities. Every
thing which tends to restrict these rival
ries within wholesome bounds is certain
to be beneficial to every section of Cali
fornia, and, therefore, all movements
which tend to bring about kindlier feelings
between rivals in business and a greater
degree of harmony in work for the gen
eral good may be accounted as among the
more encouraging signs of the coming of
a new era of prosperity.
It is certainly a wonderful future that
lies keTore Santa Clara County. Her
situation with reference to San Francisco
and to the State at large is most favorable
in every respect. She has ample railway
communication, and may look for the ac
complishment in the near future of im
provement! at Alviso which wi'l give to
her county neat of San Jose practically
all the advantages ot a seaport. Her soil,
rising from the valley to the mountains
that girdle it, is suitable for the cultiva
tion of every form of tree or fruit or
flower that is either useful, beautiful or
medicinal, which is known to '.hÂ» temper-
I ate zone. No climate more agreeable to
men can be found anywhere under heaven,
! and no community offers more attractions
in the way of school*, colleges and good
society.
In the very nature of things it is in*vi
tabethat theÂ«e advantages must sooner
or later make Santa Clara one of the most
wealthy and thiculy populated rural dis
tricts in the world. It has advanced
rapidly in toe past, despite the rivalries of
its local leaders, but will aiivanco much
more rapidly as soon as an era of har
mony and united effort begins. For that
j reason the proposed organization of the
real-estate men is one of the encouraging
signs of the time*, and the good results to
flow from it may be expected to affect not
only t'nat county, but all other sections
of the State where peonle are wise enough
to emulate the example.
OUB FOREIGN TBADE.
A short time ago Consul Monaghan,
who represents the United States at
Chemnitz, Germany, in a report to the
State Department asserted the American
people will rind little or nnto t market for
tbeir manufactured (roods in Germany,
and expressed tbe opinion that if our mer
chants would make the same effort to ex
tend their trade in South America and in
Asia as they are now making to extend
it in Europe "tbe returns would be five
times as great."
Further reports from Germany not only
confirm the statement of Consul Mona.
ghan as affects manufactured eoods, but
show that there is comparatively little
prospect for tri.de with Germany even in
the food products of this country unless
we can arrange some system ot reciprocity
which will induce the Germans to receive
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MA.V 18, 1597,
American Roods in their markets on ex
actly the same terms that are given to
German goods jn the United States.
We are told that in the kingdom
of Wurtemoerg, the butcher who of
fers for sale meat imported from the
United States must display upon hiÂ«
â¢hop a sign bearing the words, "Inferior
American Meats for Sale Here." It will
be seen the adjective conveys 10 the mind
of the consumer the idea that American
meats are of an inferior quality. Very
naturally the sale for them will be lim
ited and few dealers will care to carry
them in stock while they are compelled to
advertise them in that way.
Saxony is another of the kingdoms of
the German empire where such restric- i
tiens are placed upon American goods as
make it almost impossible to sell them.
We are told that the importer of Amer
ican pork into that kingdom must first
pay the customs duty for admission to the
empire, then a duty for admission to the
kingdom, next a third duty of '614 cents
per pound for admission to the capital
city of Dresden, and finally a fee of 25
cents per piece must be paid for inspec
tion before sale is allowed, no matter
whether the piece weighs a pound or a
hundredweight.
These example* of German restriction
upon the sale of American exports suffi
ciently illustrate the difficulty which we
have to combat in building up a trade in
that country to prove the trutb of Consul
Monaghan's statement that we would find
larger and speedier profits if we directed
our energies toward expanding trade in
South America rather than in Kurope.
They also make clear the importance of
those reciprocity treaties which were such
a notable feature of the administration of
the State Office under James G. Blame
during the Harrison administration. We
import many millions of dollars' worth
oi goods from Germany every year, and it
would seem that we are in a position to
?ay to her she must accept either reciproc
ity or retaliation.
In the meantime whatever arrange
ments may be made with Germany our
merchants should not overlook the prom
ising field of South America. It is in the
countries of that continent rather than in
those of Europe that we must look for the
upbuilding of a trade which will be bene
ficial and profitable to all concerned.
THE SULTAN'S REPLY.
The reply of the Sultan to the European
powers, that Turkey will not cease hostili
ties before her conditions are accepted,
but will continue the march upon Athens,
may have been intended simply as a claim
for damages which the Sultan does not
expect to obtain, but which may be used
as a basis for exacting from the powers
much larger concessions than he could
have hoped for had he been more modest.
It is a well-underÃtood rule in diplomacy
as in law to ask for a great deal more than
the plaintiff has a right to obtain, for no
man ever gets more than he asks for; and,
on the other hand, by asking an excessive
amount a good margin is offered for de
ductions and compromises.
Whether the Sultan intended this kind
of a bluff can only be definitely known
when the final settlement of the question
is made. He has at any rate put himself
in a position where he can treat with the
powers from a point of vantage. He re
tains for himself the right to continue the
march of his victorious troops on Athens,
and throws upon the powers the responsi
bility of .continuing the war by refusing to
accede to hii terms. In doing this he
once more shows the diplomatic skill for
which he has become noted and goes far
to justify the assertion which has been re
peatedly made since the outbreak of the
Armenian massacres that he is by all odds
the greatest master of diplomacy now liv
ing in Europe.
It is not at all likely that his claims will
be admitted by the powers. The inaem
nity of 140 000,000 may do conceded, but
his further claim for the annexation of
Tbesanly to the Turkish empire can
hardly be seriously considered even by
his own advi-er*. The nations of Europe
have had too much trouble with Turkey
even in its present condition to give con
sent to anything which will strengthen
the empire and increase its wealth, popu
lation, territory and prestige.
In some respects it is not a ba 1 thing
that the Sultan has made so large a claim
upon Greece. It will serve to dispel the
lilusion that the Turk is a sick man who
exists in Europe simply by sufferance. It
will make evident the fact that the Turks
are as ambitious and as aggressive as ever
and constitute a continual menace to the
peace of the world. Those who fondly
bel'eved that the Ottoman empire would
die of itself if it were left alone will have
to revise their opinions in the light of this
war and ot the high claims the Turks
have based upon it Ie is apparent the
Ottoman empire is as ready as ever to ex
tend its frontier whenever it has an op
portunity to do so, and Europe instead of
having a dying man on its hands has con
fronting it a powerful and dangerous foe
to whom it cannot afford to make the
least concession or grant the slightest in
crease of power.

SOLDIERS MAY
BATTLE TO-DAY
The Rains Interfered With
the Plans at the Pre
sidio Post.
If Nothing Prevents the Sham
Fight Will Take PJace
This Forenoon.
The Post Field Day Events Will
Take Placs To-Morrow â New
Features to B;- Presented.
I
Had it not rained on Sunday night tbe
sham battle on Golf Hill at the Presidio
would have taken place yesterday morn
ing as announced, but as the heavy rain
had produced an immense amount of
moisture, which bad not sufficiently dried
yesterday morning, it was decided to post
pone (he event until this morning.
The iact that the event was postponed
on account of the moisture is no refUction
on the men in the three branches of the
service, for they are ever ready and will
ing to turn oui, if tnere is any necessity,
rain or shine, but tbe officers bad consid
eration for them and did not think that
any good would result from having the
men tramp in the mud and slush when
the result to be attained could be obtained
by a delay of twenty-four hours.
A large number of citizens visited the
Presidio, which is the most beautiful post
on tbe coast, if not of any under tbe con
trol of the United States military authori
ties, in the hope of seeing tbe contest be
tween the soldiers, who were to defend
the fortifications, and the "enemy" that
was to march upon them, but they were
disaDpomted, still when they were in
formed as to the reason for the postpone
ment, they took their disappointment
good-naturedly and said "better luck next
time." Tbose wbo remained on the
grounds did not have their trip out to tbe
post lor nothing, for they bad an oppor
tunity of witnessing i he drill by a number
of recruits for tbe cavalry, which was an
exceedingly interesting event. Tbe men
rode horses without saddle?, blankets
only being cinched on the animals, and
they went through the movements of dis
mounting and mounting while tbe horses
wore on a trot; they wera instructed in
the manner of holding the reins and in
the art of "turning in tbe saddle" and
other movements.
To-morrow, should the weather be fine,
and the indications are that it will be, the
monthly field day will be held at the Pre
sidio post, morning and afternoon. This
will be a most interesting affair, and while
not on ns grand a Bcale as was the tourna
ment of last month, it will be fully as in
teresting, for there will be a number of
military events that have about tbern a
certain chaim for tbe civilians. The men
who are booked for the several contests
are exceedingly enthusiastic, and it is safe
to say that they will no their utmost to
excel previous records.
There are several new features on the
programme. One will be a broad-sword
contest on foot ; another will be mounted
wrestling by teams, and still another wili
bo a mounted relay race. The drivers'
raoe, which excited so much interest and
was so favorably commented upon during
the tournament, will be repeated. Tbe
programme, as a whole, is a particularly
good one, and the men who are to take
purtin the contests deserve to be encour
aged by tbe presence of a large number of
citizens of both sexes.
DAVIS ESTATE CONTEST.
Judge CofTey Considering Another Will
Disposing or 93,000,000 Woith
of Property.
Judge Coffey yesterday began the hear
ing of the Jacob Z. Davis will contest,
which bids fair to ba a bitterly fought
battle, as tbe estate is worth about
$1,000 090, according to the estimate of the
proponents of the will, tbouzh tbe con
testants declare that $2,000,000 is tbe
proper figure.
There is an Rrray of leernl talent in the

Yesterday was the gala day of all the year for ihe members of the San Francisco Sehuetzen
Verein. It was the occasion of their thirty-eighth annual May festival, or kin* shoot. Shell
Mound Park was crowded from early morning until late in the afternoon with members of the
Verein. their families and friends, who had gathered to celebrate the lestal day. Almost the
entire active membership of the Verein, which now consists of one hundred and ssventy,
ware present, one hundred and fourteen of whom took part in the shoot
Lawrence Bauer won the honors of the day and was declared the "king shot." George
Alpers came second and won the crown. The other winners were as follows: Apple, E. Barut;
scepter, D. B. Faktor; ring. Ausrust Browning; head, H. Thode ; right wing, Henry Prien;
left wuig, L. Bendel; right fool. A. Bertelsen; left. O. Lenike; tail, J. C. Waller.
At 11 o'clock the "king shoot" b^gan. A wooden eagle, placed on a tall staff at 100 feet
distant, formed tho tnrget. Lots were ca^t to determine the order ot shooting among the
members. Then the earnest began. The object in view was to shnoi down the eagle, piece b'
piec.-, the man bringing to the ground the last piece ot the wooden image of the noble bird
winning the honors of tho day and the title of "king shot," which he will hold for a year.
The other winners were determined according as they brought down from the staff the hend,
a foot, a wing, or some other portion oi the bird. The contest was a close one, and it was
only after some very tine work that Lawrence Bauer finally won out.
After the shoot Bxuer wÂ«s carried about the grounds in a chair supported by six sturdy
fellows, members of the Verein. In the pavilion he was wreathed by Miss Lizzie, daughter of
the president of the order. The ex-king was also wreathed by Miss Kin ma Koch. Dancing in
the pavilion followed the congratulatory address by the president and the response by the
new king.
Next Thursday evening the official crowning of the king will take place at California Hall,
620 Bush street, at which all the prizes won on last Sunday and yesterday will be distributed.
The king' 6 prise is $1&Q in cash, lv addition King Bauer wlil receive a diamond medal.

The first of the two extra days' racing

paratively easy to "dope." There will be
no dearth of bookmakers to handle the

step Left a Trail.
Two fully equipped parties of scientists,
one from Italy and one from Philadelphia,
will leave the Moravian Mission for Mount
St. Elias on the 29ih of May.
The Italian party, which has been cor
responding with Dr. de Vecchi here for
some months, will consist of seventeen,
many of whom are experienced moun
taineers from the Alps. The Philadelphia
party, under Pro essor Bryant, consists of
but eight men. Professor George David
son thinks the smaller party has the
advantage, by reason of the smaller food
supplies and trappings required.
Thinking ihat me Italian party might
come ;o tli is City, the Geographical
Society of the Pacific passed a resolution
on Saturday offering the party its room.*
and the use of all book*, maps and other
data needed; but news was received by
Dr. de Vecchi that Professor Fay of Boston
haa advised the Italians to go by the
Canadian Paoitic, so as to leave for the
mountain t!i*Â» same day tha American
party starts, May '29, so '.hey will probabiy
not visit San Francisco at ail.
The Italian exue.ii lion was arranged in
March, but the American party has beeu
making preparations lor two years. Pro

climber and lie hoads the party. He has
fully consulted Professors Russell and
Davidson with reference 10 the work:.
"The purpose is to reach the culminat
ing peaks of the Si. Elias range, " said
Professor Davidson yesterday. "Mount
St. Elias is 18,011 feet above the sea, but
Mount Logan, which is twenty-six miles
northeast is 19,022 feat and is the highest
mountain in North America. A mile and
a haif beyond is Mount McGrath, which
is 19,275 feet high."
The last camp will be made by the
American party at Agassiz glacier. From
there the party will travel over the ice
afoot to Mount St. E!iaÂ« and the higher
peaks, beyond latitude 60 and near longi
tude 140. It is the same region visited in
1888 by Lieutenant Schwatka and Seton-
Karr 'for the Ntjw York Times. If the
y arty gets to tlie top of Mount Logan it*
members will be able to see nearly 190
miles. Mount St. Eiias can be seen 185
miles by mxriners.
At presenf absolutely nothing is known
of ths geology of the regions these parties
I are about to visit. All clime 3 hover along
j the cloud-reaching sides ol tlies j monster
peaks, more sub ime by far than Mont
Blanc with its Arve and Arveyron raving
| ceaselessly at its base. With success the
contributions made to science by this
party ought to b' of greÃt value.

Sad Fatality in Connection With the
Cruise of the Sloop-Yacht
R gina.
There was another yachting fatalilv last
Saturday night The sloop-yacht Regina
struck a sunken rock while on her way to
Vallejo, ana went down. Three of the
yachtsmen were saved, but two others
went down with the sloop. The Regina
was one of a combined fleet of Corin
thian and California Yacht Club boats
that started Saturday afternoon for a
cruise to Vallejoand return. She was not
the fastest boat in the fleet and was left
behind early in the race. Her crew con
sisted of Harry turn Suden, cousin of Otto
turn Suden the attorney ; William Vaughn,
a personal friend of turn Saden; Frank
Hayes, a nephew of ex-Councilman Hayes
of East Oakland ; James Lame, son of ex-
JudgÂ« Lame, and Edward J. A. Ingall3.
When the Kegina let her moorings at
Oakland it was clear sailing, but before
Angel Island was reached a heavy mist
had settled down and navigation was dif
ficult. Between 8:30 and 9 p. M., wh*n
near Red Rock, the sloop struck hard and
soon the hold was full of water. Turn
Suden, Hayes and Ingalls goi iatoa dingy
that/vas lowing astern and pulled away
for assistance. Vaughn and Larue were
left on the sloop and were never >c n |
again. The three men in the dingy were |
picked up by some Chinese fishermen and
all retnrned'to the scene of the wreck. No
trace of the yacht could be found. She
had disappeared under the waves ana
there was no trace of the two yachtsmen
who had stood by her. A search party
was sent from Oakland yesterday morn
ing, but no trace of the missing men was
found.
The Regina was 22 fret long and 1 ast
year was rebuilt and fitted by turn Suden.
The sctiooner Montezuma nearly met
the same fate as the Kegina. She went
out with an excursion party and the wind
tailing light drilled near the rocks near
Angel Island before the anchor held.
There were over 300 people crowded 1
aboard the small crait and lor three hours j
they were In a miserable plight. There
was little or no shelter ana the rain fell in
torrents. The small boat was manned
and went to Tiburon for assistance. In
the meantime a liberal use of the foghorn
was made, but it brought no assistance.
Finally, when the party had given up all
hope and some of them had made
themselves as comfortable as possi
ble in the vessel's hold, the tug
Sea Witch hove in sight and
towed the party to Washington-street
wharf. There was one row during the
evening. An aggrieved husband thrashed
a young man who accidentally stumbled
and held 011 to the man's wife to save him
self. The innocent victim got a black eye
and a bleeding nose before friends sepa
rated them. A few minutes' later the
victim learned that the man who had
beaten him wore a white hat and he
started to look lor him. Unlortunately
there were two men wearing white hats,
and the unfortunate second man had the
vials of the victim's wrath poured out on
him. Finally oil wan poured on the
troubled waters and peace was restored
after the husband had apologized to both
the beaten men.
Everybody who has occasion to use
I'oweil-street wharf are wondering when

I been told to do so, but still the much- '
j needed landing lit-.* in the cove behind

men had to climb tne piles in order to
reach the wharf.

everything imaginable and duplicates
thereof t>y the dozens; witli notarial
blanks, printing oflice timecards, entry- J
books iind what not; with microscopes |
and various other kinds of scopes â the
plaintiffs in this celebrate 1 case have con- j
vened Judge Slack's courtroom into an |
exhibition nlnce that outrivals the side- 'â 
show of the bissest three-ring circus ex- i
tant. True, th re huve been objections
registered here and tiiere to the introduc
tion of these freak*, but they were of a
purely leijal and tecun.cal nature.
It is all good enough until Judge Slack
is compelled to shift his court from one
part of the City Hall to another, as he has
had to do every day or two tince the tritl i
began, and then it it that the clerks and |
bailiff* and their myriad assistants have |
cause to puff and perspire and even swear, |
for it devolves upon them lo lug all of th.s I
1 junk along in the wake of the procession. :
The irial originally l>e<ran in Judge Slack's j
own courtroom on the top floor, but be j
was driven out of there by the workmen j
on tho roof and moved to Judge Troutt's '
quarters. From there ho went to the Ku- !
liervisors' chamfer, tlionce to Judge Heb- !
liar t's courtroom, buck again to the chain- .
her. and yesterday lie was driven into i
Judge Cook's tempie of justice. The end
of this migration is not yet, and the birth
of new and cumbersome exhibits is on the
increase,
But all this has its interesting features,
even if t lie backs of clerks and bailiffs are
being broken. It amuses the crowd, and
relieves the monoto:-.y and Humdrum |
that has chniacieriz?d" the trial until â j
Well, until yisteniav. There was some
thing oi an awakening yesterday, but j
still nothing sensationa 1 . It began when :
a iow among the attorneys for the plnin- \
t iff* developed, and after thnt had sub- j
sided the audience was &rpt irom uozing i
by tlio several wordy collisions and the
sharp repurtee between Attorneys Foote !
for the defense and Knight for the other;
side, iiy the way, speaking of Mr. Kni?hl,
that silver-tonj'.ued orator made his sec
ond audible appearanc? in tbe trial at |
yesterday's session, and is now presumed i
to be in the case with "both feet" as ihe j
saying goes.
Heietofore people have wondered vrhy
it was that a recognized ltader of the Fair
I hosts, such as Mr. Knight has been since
; the development of premonitions of a con
i test over the estate, should have so little
to say in a case of this magnitude. There
have been pronounced rumors to the c â¢
feet thai all was not harmony In the ranks
of the plaintiffs' army of attorneys, and
after yesterday's little set-to there can
scarcely be any doubt of the truth- of
these.
' Mr. Knight took his seat in the court
room on the very opening of the morning
session, and he looked like business all
over. He did not have to wait long for
tho business, for about the first thins; that
happened was the presentation by Attor
neys McEnernev and Pierson, who repre
sent the executor.*, of an application for
an allowance of additional fees.
I Mr. Knight, who appear* in the case
for the heirs as intervenors. was on his
â  <â â â¢â '. in a minute with an objection. It
developed. from what he said ti.at Messrs.
McEnernev mid Pierson have already re
ceived $79,025 for services rendered the
special uciminiijtraiors in entering the so
called 'trust" will for probate; $20,00)
more out of the fund left by Senator Fair
for the purpose of probating his will, and
now want another big slice for services to
the executor* "after the probate of the
will." Mr. Knight's complaint was that
the thing was being overdone, and that
his client!!, the heirs, were the ultimate
sufferers. â¢
Judge Slack declined to pass upon the
matter offhand. It was something, he
said that would be considered wlien he
was fixing the compensation of attorneys
later in the game.
This over, the dreary work of intro
ducing more negative* and enlarged re
productions of handwriting, all for the
swelling of the sideshow and correspond
ing 'suffering of the clerks and * bailiffs,
was* resumed. There was an objection j
and a debate when the plaintiffs sought
! to introduce negatives of the letter writ
! ten by Senator Fair to Mrs. Nettie Craven,
In which he refers to the "psncil" will
and the deeds he is said to have given her.
The court finally ruled that it was admis
sible.
David N. Carvalho, the New York hand
writing expert, was called to the witness
stand at the opening of the afternoon
session. George A. Knight conducted the
direct examination. Carvalho testified
that be In-ld the position of official expert
on disputed handwriting, inks and pnoio
graphs for the Grand Jury of New York
1 County, and held the same position in
Brooklyn. He had been a photographer
for thirty years, bm of late years had de
voted mm elf chiefly to the reproduction
of handwriting rather than to portrait
work. Curvallio said also that he knew all
about standard inks. Ink, explained,
was tanno gal late suspended in water by
means of gum.
"How did you happen to come out here
from New York?' asked Mr. Knight.
"I came here to testify in the case of
Angus vs. Craven," he replied. "I was
sent for by the executors of tne Fair es
tate and expect to be paid by them."
Mr. Knight now wanted to know if the
witness had examined ail of the checks,
letters, wills, deeds, negatives and en
larged reproductions of documents that
had been introduced as evidence in the
case and received an affirmative reply.
Attorney Foote, who was scheduled to
conduct the cross-examination for the de
fense, asked permission io ask the witness
a few questions in order to test his com
petency. In answer to him Carvalho ad
mitted that he never had had the pleasure
of a persunal acquaintance with Senator
Fair in his lifetime. Neither had he ever
seen the millionaire write. He confessed
that this would handicap him somewhat
in testifying, inasmuch as he would have
'o surmise now, whereas he would other
wise have been certain.
Mr. Knight took the witness again and
began allowing him the checks and let
ters admitted to be in the handwriting of
Senator Fair. Carvalho said he had made
a careful study of all of them for the
purpose of making comparisons with the
disputed handwriting.
Carvalho proceeded to tell the i jury how
he made his comparisons, but Lis remarks
developed into a veritable argument for
the plaintiffs and he had to be stopped by
the court. After considerable difficulty
with him on this account, be finally testi
fied that as the result of his investigation
he had reached the conclusion that tne
"pencil" will was a tracing â forgery.
He had found words in the will so similar
to repetitions of those words that he was

VON TIEDEMANN IS
NOT SO JAUNTY
John H. Fidler, a Former
Companion, Turns State's
Evidence.
Testimony That the Prisoner at
the Bar Directed the BogU3
Deed Conspiracy.
Attorney Campbdll Introduces the
Witness' Former Confession Which
Excn'pited Yon Ti d man-.
John H. Fidler yesterday supplied the
sensation that for tome time has been ex
pected in the trial of Carl W. yon Tiede
man, who is on trial in Judge Wallace's
court on a charge of perjury.
Hitherto Fidler, who is a convict in the
Foisom Btate prison, has been held up by
Attorney Alexander Campbell as a friend
of Yon Tiedemann, and at a former trial
an effort wan made to secure the introduc
tion of au affidavit made by Fidler that
would prove favorable to Yon Tiedemann.
Judge Wallace ruled out the affidavit, and
it was apparent tnat this action by the
court had an effect on the jurors, as they
failed to agree, and a new trial was or
dered.
When Fidler appeared on the witness
stand yesterday, being brought from Fol
som prison in rerponse to a summons
issued on behalf of tno prosecution, there
was considerable excitement among the
adherents of Yon Tiedemann, for they
were curious to hear what the witness
would say to the detriment of the ac
cused.
Fidier was formerly one of Yon Tiede
mann's associates, and while thus acting
pot into difficulty. He and Yon Tiede- |
niann were charged with a felony, and to c
the surprise oi everyone Fidler pleaded
guilty. He afterward explained to his
trieadl that he took this coums because
Yon Tiedemann said that was the only
way to extricate all of them and that he
would get Fidler out of jail in a few
months. Fidier was sentenced to a term
of years in the State Prison at Foisom,
after which Yon Tiedemann teemed to
forget about him, but Fidlor did not lose
hope Â«nd consistently reiused to testify
against Yon Tiedemann, though called on
by the Diairiot Attorney to do so. In re
sponse to all questions touching his rela
tions with Yon Tiedemann he replied that
he would decline to answer on the ground
that his reply miglit tend to convict him
of a feiony.
At the opening of yesterday's proceed
ings it was quickly made apparent that a
change had come over Fidler's feelings,
for he at once confessed that ho waÃ a
confederate with Yon Tiedemann in the
forgery of the deed that caused the origi
nal complaint to be filed against them.
In that transaction it was pretended that
Mrs. Harriet (Jbrisiy sold some real estate
lor several thousand dollars, and a man
appeared who said that he wes Horace G.
Pratt, and ftened two notes for $1600 each.
As a matter of fact Mrs. Christy had no
intention of selling her property, and the
notes pretended to be given for the prop
erty were fictitious and were procured for
the purpose of helping alone a scheme to
dispose of a bogus title of the property to
other parties.
When Mrs. Christy complained to the
police that her signature had been forged
to a pretended deed Yon Tiedemann was
arrested. On his trial he told the jury
that he had been imposed on ; that a cer
tain woman appeared in his office and
tula ly personated Mrs. Christy. He said
he would know the woman If he saw her
again. A photogranh of Mrs. Sarnh Owen
Spencer was shown to him and he swore
that it was a picture of the woman who
personated Mrs. Christy.
It so happened that Mrs. Spencer had
been charged with implication in some
questionable transactions, but had cleared
nerself, and it was suspected that this
former alleged blemish on the woman's
record hnd caused her to be selected as a
likely victim for Yon Tiedemann's de
livery. The jury believed him and ac
auitted him of ail blame in connection
with the bogus deed.
Information of Yon Tiedemann's alle
gation was sent to Mrs. Spencer, who was
In Chicago, and she responded by declar
ing that she was not in the State of Cali
fornia at the time of the Christy transac
tion and therefore said that Yon Tiede
mann committed perjury when he swore
that she was the woman who personated
Mrs. Christy.
Mrs. Spencer at once returned to San
Francisco and presented proofs to the
Grand Jury that she was telling the truth,
whereupon Yon Tiedemaun was arrested
on a charge o( periury.
Mr. Campbell yesterday informed the
couit thHt this is :he tilth time his client
has been on trial before a jury for felony
charged to have grown oui of this 1 ran suc
tion and that he had not yet been con
victed. If the jury places any reliance
on Fidler's testimony in the present trial
a different result may be expected, for he
swore that from beginning to end Yon
Tiedemann led the conspiracy and di
rected the proceedings, even going so far
as tn suggest that Fidler should sign the
name Horace G. Pratt to the notes and
mortgage on transfer of the property.
On cross-examination by counsel lor the
defense Fidler admitted he had refused to
testify against Yon Tiedemann hiiiKTlo.
He explained that he had declined to
appear against Yon Tiedemann because he
bad hoped to secure help from him in
getting out of the State prison. Hi was
finally convinced that Yon Tiedemann was
not going to assist him and i.c therefore
resolved to tell the truth.
The somewhat noted affidavit of Fidler,
in which he recited a state of affairs that j
would completely exonerate \\>n Tiede- j
mann, was read. Fidler confessed thai be
signed the statement and said he did so
because Yon Tiedemann promised to get
him out of jail in two hours if he signed it.
He would have signed anything under the
circumstances, and did not read the docu
ment and did not dictate a word of it, ns
it was taken to him in the jail where he
wÂ«s incarcerated. That wns July 3, 1894.
It was plain that Fidler s tcsiinionv
cnused great uneasiness on the part of
Yon Tiedemann, who has lost much of
the jaunty air that characterized his man
ner during the previous trials. He teems
to have lost confidence in his lucky star,
bet he still remains the best dressed man
in the courtroom.
The average number of novels i**ued
100 years ago in Arnerioa and Great Brit
ain was sixteen. Now the average is two
or three a day.

SPRING SUGGESTIONS,
Take Special Care During Nature'^
House-Cleaning: lime. -v,,^'.'
Avoid draughts and sudden changes of
temperature. *
Do not discard your warm winter cloth*
ing too soon. It is better to suffer a little
inconvenience than to take cold.
Remember that one is specially liable
to contract a bad cold or chili at this sea-
son of the year.
A cough or cold contracted between the
seasons is the most annoying kind, and
may last through the summer.
To -, make the home happy, keep the
health secure. Poverty may come, but it
can be endured if the health remains. ; .
No health was ever maintained without
assistance. .Health, like the body, must
be supported. But do not make a mistake
and do it foolishly. .
If you feel a cough or a cold coming on,
take a drink of pure whisky at once. It
will keep the blood in circulation, and is
the best preventive against the diseases of
the season.
Remember that only pure whisky should
be taken. Duffy's Pure Malt Whisky has
the strongest recommendations from the
leading scientists and medical men. It is
the only standard medicinal whisky. Take
no other from your druggist. '
DRUNK FOR TWENTY YEARS,
A correspondent writes: "I was drunk on
and off for over twenty yearsâ drunk when I
had money, sober when I had none. Many
dear friends I lost, and numbers gave me good
advice to no purpose ; but, thank GoJ, an angel
hand came at last in the form of my poor wile,
who administered, your marvelous remedy,
'Anti-Jug,' 10 me without my knowledge or
consent. IÂ«m now saved and completely
transformed from a worthless fellow to a sober
and respected citizen." .
If "Anti-Jag" cannot be hÃ<l at your drug-
gist, it will be mailed in plain wrapper with
full directions how to give secretly, on receipt
of One Dollar, by the Rer.ova Chemical Co.,

Explanation.
Tie arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiirk" means high barometric pressure and
is usually acfomrjanied by fair weather: "low"
rtfers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the '-low Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
Ihe 1 ressure falling to the California coast, warmer
w either may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO, lix., May 17.â The situation in pro
visions was very discouraging to the bol.s. Prices
wsre lower again to-day, owing to easier grain
markets, a decline in hog prices at the yards and ;
liberal selling by commission houses. Receipts of j
hogs continue to exceed the estimates. Packers I
bought moderately an 1 snorts were covered to I
some extent. There was a slight rally before the j
cios?, owing to good buying by foreign packers.
The cash market was fairly active tor meats; lard,

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MARKET.
The following resume of the wheat market Is
furnished by E. A. Eresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker, 412 Pine street.
San Francisco, May 17, 1897.
Chlcngo.
Wheat started the week In a sloppy condition.
The local crowd did not fancy cables, which gave
Liverpool 3,i@ld lower with a further decline of
14c abroad at the close. French markets quoted
flour 30@35, and wheat '20@!i5 centimes higher
than tSbtuiday's closing.
July wheat opened at 71.y 4 @71 %c against 7S2c,
final quotations on :*a;urday. a 1 ihe decline there
was good buying ior sboits. which temporarily ad
vancfd inlces. The advance was met with heavy
selling by the lo al crowd. Offerings were far in
excess of the demand, resulting in a sudden break
to 711.4 c. At this price prominent local operators,
together with commission bouses, began buvinp'
Their buying held the market steady against nta'r
pressure.
Af.er the visible supply was piseii offerings be
gan to dropoff. Prices gradually finned fin
ally dosing at op.-ning figures ihe difference be
tween May a d July wheat narrowed considerably
during the day. This was caused by less desire
upon the part of shorts 10 cover. Spot wheat was
moderately active: the demand has lessened
somewhat as compared with last \vek.
Wheat and Hour on i assage io the United King
dom increased 80.000 quarters, to thu Continent
increased 50 000 quarters.
The vl-ible supply decreased 2.125, C00 bushels,

San Francisco.
9:15 a. 11. session.
Rains over mary sections of California last
night eladdened the hearts of shorts. Before the
opening ihis morning many predicted a regular
avalanche in whea; prices. It had been piomised
should ruin come a break of large proportion
would immediately follow. To the surprisP of
Lulls and hears the market hardly recognized the
fa 1 lor which was to do j-o much d saver.
Weaiher conditions proved very Insignificant.
There is no di Ã¼bt much wood will result from the
rains of yesterday and lust night. Wheat seems
to have Us foundation gauged by European Vai
nes rather than local cau^es. December opened at
fl 2b 1 /a. declined to $1 2U'4, cUsed at al 26's,
against $\ 27% at the close on Haturday. The
extreme weakness in Chicago and Liverpool was
the chief cause in depressing prices in this market.
10:15 a. m. skssion.
stronger Chicago market started good buying of
wheat at me opening. Shorts wn<> sold early be
gun taking in their sails. December wheat opened
at 91 27, against fl 2tfÂ«/g at the close of the former
session. The demand was in excess of offerings.
Not much wheat was for sale until the price
reached $1 271/4, where early buyers began selilng
to realize. Cfferuigs were well taken. Closing was
at $1 27.
Between sessions Mr. Mayhew monnted the
block and auctioned off the first car of barley re
ceived from this season's crop. Eighty-one and a
quarter cenis w*M paid for it.
11:15 a. M. skssiox.
The strong feeling in wheat of the previous ses
sion continued its influ. nee during thiÂ» ses-son.
December wheat opened at $1 27. advanced to and
closed at $1 271,4. The buying was of a good chÂ»r
acter. CnVrines were ligbt, mostly by scaloers
who werÂ« flaying for a small reaction. Local
tradeis are in a quandary to account for the stub
bornness of the market. About the best solution
would seem that the market is In a very heavily
oversold condition.
Shippers are not In opposition to an advance.
Any unfavorable crop news now would cÂ«use a
sharp appreciation.
jJe.emiier barley opÂ»ned at 743gc, declined to
74c, the liil.il quotation.
2 p. m. session.
Clearing weather caused a firm feelin? In wheat
at the afitrnuon besslou. Afternoon offerings

ITS ABROGATION
Hawaiian Treaty Discussed
by the Federation of
Trades.
Senator Perkins Also Writes on
the Subject to the Su
pervisors.
He Says He Will B? Guided by the
Expressed Op. Dion of the People
of the State.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call.)
IX)S Broadway, May 17. )
The A'ameda County Federation of
Trades at its regular weekly meeting
passed the following resolution:
â  .. Whereas, The question of abrogating the
7re i- : treaty witn Hawaii is now before Con
gress; end, wherens, we believe In advocating
the o: .i'iovm nt of home labor in California in
every j-.oss.ble instance, and we further be
iicve tnat tin abrogation of the present Ha
wnllan ireutv would have a great tendency to
biii d up the beet-augur industry in California
and thereby put to wore many unernp oyed
ineD hose worK is now being done by cooly
labor in Hawaii, therefore be it
Kcsolvea. That the Alameda County Federa
tion of Trades most earnestly urge our repre
sentatives in Congress to do all in their power
to cause the abrogation of said treaty.
The Hawaiian reciprocity treaty occu
pied the attention of the Supervisors for *
short tirue to-day. A week ago a dispatch
was sent to Senator Perkins by the board
asking him to do all in his power to pro
tect, California interests with regard to the
treaty. To-day the following reply was
received :
.Vy Dear Sir: I am in receipt of telegram 1
relating 10 tfte abrogation of the Hawaiian
reciprocity treaty and will very gladly give it
my consideration. lam placed in this matter
in a very embarrassing situation, by reason of
the divergnt views taken regarding reci
procity with Hawaii by prominent citizens and
commercial bodies In different parts of th,e
State.
Â©The commercial organizations, banks and
ixport< rs 'i San Francisco deem the continu
ance of the treaty 01 vital importance to them
and to the general prosperity of the Slate,
while from ihe interior cities and counties
come appeals for trie abrogation of the
treaty. The point on wnich the opposition to
the treaty is bfiÂ«ed is the beet-sugar industry
ot".the State. No one can be more alive to the
Importance of that industry than myself, and
I hope Io Â»cc it grow and give to the State that
prosperity which I believe it in capable of pro
ducing.
. But there seem to be two views to the effect
of the continuance of the reciprocity treaty
. upon this industry, and it is these that have
given rise to the demands for its continuance
and abrogation. Both view? are strongly held
and both have a strong backing of fuels, so
that it-is not easy to determine whether one
j arty ii right and another wrong, or whether
tlO truth .ies between the two opinions.
Therefore, as you will see, my position in re
gard to the question at isÂ«ue is embarrassing.
We are noiv paying to China, the East Indies
and other countries with wnich we have no
reciprocity treaties tens of millions oi dollars
each ye^r for sugar, on which we impose an
import duty, and as long as we are compelled
to purchase sugar from foreign countries it
seems but right mat we should give to those
granting us procity benefits an advantage
in removing duties from their staple article of
export. If we were not paying out such
â vast sums to other sugar - producing
countries there could be no question j
that the reciprocity treaty wiih Hawatishould
be abrogated. Bat as long as we are unable to
ju educe sufficient sugar /or our own consump-
Uofi it is noi, to my mind, gui d policy to raai
'aly change our relations with a country
â with which reciprocity has been mutually ad
vantageous.
: "1 can only say that my best thought shall
be given 10 the matter, and that I shall be gov
erned in ray action by the wishes of the major
ity of the Deopi* nf the State as far at I can as
certain what they are. That they will make
t:>eir wishes known in no uncertain way I
have no reason to doubt."
EARLY CLOSING.
The Movement Postponed Owing to the
Opposition of One Van.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 17.â The move
ment for the early closing of the stores in
this city bag met an unexpected obstacle
in tie person of the proprietor of one gro
cery-store, and it looks now as though
tnere would have to be an indefinite post
ponement of the project. The man in
question is the proprietor of a grocery
store on Park street, and he c aims that
the greater portion of his trade is after
nightfall, and to close up at 6:30 or even 7
would destroy his business. The other
grocers agreed to close if all would do so,
bat as the one in question will not agree,
or has not so far, tue movement has come
to a' standstill.
Hosting Xotei.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 17.â The ques
on of having sports on Memorial day
has come up in the Alameda Boating Club
'and lias been decided in the negative. The
club was of the opinion that a proper ob
servance of the spirit of that day would
not permit them to indulce in amuse
ments even of the harmless kind which is
their mission, and so voted to hold no
race. â¢ : .
Disappointed.
A LAM EDA, Cal., May 17.â The refusal
of the railroad company to adopt the loop
system of running its trains through
Alameiia has been productive of consider
able disappointment, especially among
those who live in that portion of iowd
which would have been provided thereby
with better transportation facilities than
sit present enjoyed. They had hoped that
the company could see that with very lit
tle expense in track-laying it could avoid
the' necessity of an expensive bridge. JJut
it appears that the company trunks other
wisp.
Notes.
Â There is considerable complaint because
many members of the volunieer fcr^e aid
not turn out at the Llnderman's Opera
house lire a week ago. There were thirty
members absent.
The holiness convention at the Free
Methodist church has aroused so much
interest that it has been decided to con
tinue it for anotter week.

WOULD BLOW UP SALOONS
Rev. Mr. Rader Strongly Urges
an Explosive Temperance
Sentiment.
Considers the Sunday Dramshop Per
fectly Expressive of Sabbath
Desecration-
OAKLAND, CaI., May 17.â William
Rader of San Francisco made a sensational
address before the convection of the Cali- '
fornia Sabbath. Observance Association in
the First Congregational Church to-night
He said in part:
No other institution in America more com
pletely embodies or more perfectly expresses
the spirit of Sabbath desecration than the
Sunday saloon. It the saloon is a social |
nuisance on Saturday it id thrice a nuisance |
on Sunday. It is secular in proportion as Sun- |
dsv is sacred. The community which lacks j
sufficient public sentiment in close saloons on :
Sunday is not politically Christian. Some- I
thing is radically wrong when full churches I
and full saloons exist side by side in one city, i
ThÂ« open church and the open saloon make a
social paradox. The closed saluoa and the j
open church it the ideal condition.
Tne ground of our opposition is not the in- j
fluence of Sunday closing upon worklngmen. j
nor the historical Sabbath sustained by proof j
texts from Scripture, nor upon J the fact that
iv this State: we nave no Civic Sabbath." The j
open saloon on Sunday is a disgrace, whether I
labor is profited or not. The economy of the
problem is subordinate to the. righteousness of
it. The open saloon is a. menace to Sabbath
sanctity whether the Seventh-day Advenllsts :
are right or wrong. No hair-splitting defini
tions of the Sabbath materially affect the
broader basal principle under. the whole
question.
I have heard of but one saloon being sup
pressed in San Francisco, and that was by
dynamite. When public sentiment turns to
dynamite, when temperance sentiment be
comes explosive and definite ana consolidated,
then the suppression will go on. .
Appioacned on any side a discussion of Sab
bath desecration opens up every living topic
agitating the public mind. It is a hornet's
nest, which once disturbed brings out every
phase of the secular spirit and every form of
materialism. It toliows therefore that, the
matter of Sabbath observance is logical ly in
terwoven with the whole problem of the liquor
traffic.
In the city of Oakland, within the past two
years, two magnificent attempts were made,
not merely for temperance reform, but for the
honor of the Lord's day and the glory of God.
In bo instances the people were practically
one. It is true that one sect, consistent with
its own views, took grounds r.gairs: tnis move
ment and mirchtd with the saloon power, but
â or the must part the people were united. In
both instances, notably the firÂ«t, the leeders
fell, stabbed to the heart by the arrows of tne
enemy poisoned with power. By one vote a
great victory for Sunday closing was lost by
one of your representatives â or rather mlsrep-
ma lives â a man who was solemnly pledged
to sustain the people, elected to the r.fflce of
Councilman on the non-purtisnn temperance
ticket, but who on two different occasions,
with apparent sincerity and with an mr of a
martyr, fell belore Richmond, stunned and
battered by the paper pellet of a political pop
gun.
Let us bring to this tattle the cannon of a
civic Sabbath law. In 1858 an act entitled
"An act for the better observance of the Sab
bath" passed the Legislature. A man accused
of violating the law appealed to the Supreme
Court, which decided that it was unconstitu
tional. In 1872 another law was passed, re
maining In force eleven year*. A political
party destroyed it. Since 1883 we have had
no civic Sabbath law. From our Legislature
we have a right to expect an act that will
place California In the list of civicly protected
Slates on the Sabbath day.
CONSUMPTIVE CATTLE.
A Condemned Herd Fplivted Away From
Hie li ealth Authorities.
BERKLEY, Cal., May 17.â Twenty- r our
cows afflicted with consumption and con
demned to death were spirited away from
Berkeley yesterday or last nieht by the
owner, who, it is thought, intends to use
Hiem for dairy purro es in spite of their
condition. The cows were to have been
slaughtered to-day by Dr. Rowel!.
The diseased animals are sai I to be the
property of C. Curtin, who conducts a
dairy in tie hills east of Berkeley. Last
week Dr. Rowell subjected Cttrtin* s cattle
to th? t.jbercuiin test with the result that
out of forty-three animals twenty-four
were found to be Buffering irum tubercu
losis.
Dr. Rowell condemned the cows on
Saturday, and set ihem apart to be slaugh
tered. When the work of sorting out the
healthy half of the herd was done it was
too late to begin the killing, so the con- j
derailed cattle were left with tlieir owner.
This mornintr Dr. Rowell found all the
cows were missing. They had been driven
away in the direction of Martinez and are
outside of Alameda County. The doctor
at once notified the authorities at Mar
tinez and the health ottic at Oakland,
and a sharp watch will be kept to prevent
tuberculous meat or milk being sold as a
result.
A Motorman'fi Severe Shock.
OAKLAND, Cal, May 17.â Charles
Ctrr, a motorman on the Hayward* line,
received a shock yesterday of 1500 voitsof
electricity, buc no material injuries are
apparent, except a peculiar mark burned
on his right leg, which is at present par
tmliy useless. Carr was given charge of
the big freight locomotive this morning,
and while lastening a loose wire on the
top of the locomotive he received ibe lull
force of the current, which threw him to
;he ground several feet away. His hand
was somewhat burned, but his injuries are
very light compared with the strength of
the current
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1897.
FRICK SUES McNEAR.
Claim for Services Rendered
During the Last Leg
islature.
The Attorney Frvpared a Bill Re
lating to the Franchises of
Whaiv s ni Piers.
Oakland Office San Frakcipco Call, }
908 Broadway, May 17. J
Attorney A. L. Frick tiled a suit to-day
against George W. McNenr and P. E.
Bowles, president of the First National
Bank, for f>ooo. The suit does not give
any details, btlt merely recites the fact
that between January 1 and April lof
this year the plaint ff, who is a member of
the law firm of Frick & Goodcell, rendered
services to the defendant that wero reason
ably worth the sum of $SCOO.
The work lor which Judge Frick claims
compensation was done at Sacramento
during the late Legislature. . AlcNear's
wharves at Port Costa were in an uncer
tain condition regarding their franchise.
Under the act of 1893 Supervisors are re
quired to issue franchises to the highest
bidder only. Prior to that time MrNear
had obtained a twenty-year franchise for
his wharves at Port Costa, and that period
is just about to expire. The, last Legis
lature presented a solution of the diffi
culty. A bill was passed amending the
act of 1593 by accepting renewals of fran
chises tor wnarves, chutes and piers.
Judge Frick appeared at bacramento at
the special instance of Messrs Bowies and
| McNear and worked in the interest of the
amendment to the act of 1893, and with
such success thai it became a law by re
ceiving the Governor's signature.
Mr. Bowles declined to discuss the mat
ter to-day and said that Judge Frick had
j not been employed by him and that
i would be hi* answer to the suit.
When told that Mr. Bowles denied em
ploying him Judge Frick was very indig
| nant and said: "Mr. - Bowles does not
speak the truth. lie called me into bis
bank one Sunday morning and asked me
to see if an amendment could not be in
corporated upon a bill then pending be
fore the Legislature known as the Mead
bill. He furnished me with the desired
amendment and explained to me the posi
tion of Mr. McNear regarding his wharves
nnd said he had been requested by Mc-
Near to get m* to take hold of the matter.
"I dictated the bill which wag intro
duced by Assemblyman Wright, and I
took charge of it until it was finally
passed. Mr. Bowles ha* frequently told
me â¢â  iiico that the only difference oetween
us was regarding the value of my service*.
i I have waited over two months for an am
i icable settlement and have now brought
suit as my offer to submit the matter to
arbitration was not accepted. As proof of
i the service I might say that on one occasion
Mr. Bowles showed me a lotter from Mr.
McNear in which he said he would like to
pei tie with me for $tO3. Messrs Delmas
& Shortridge are my attorneys in this
matter. ,
WILDER PROTESTS.
Reasons Why ltaiiroud Property Should
Not Bo Opened.
OAKLAND, C>l., May 17.â At the meet
ing of the Supervisors to-day Superin
tendent A. D. Wilder of the Southern Pa
cific sent a protest against opening addi
tional streets across the property of the
company at Fruitvale. The protest was
called forth by the petition of the resi
dents of Fruiivale to open Tevis street
ac rots the right of wav of the railroad.
In his protest Mr. Wilder says that the
railroad company purchased the land for
$1000 an acre over twenty-rive years ago.
j The title is absolute and not for railroad
purposes only. In subdividing the prop
erty adjacent 'he owners of the land made
no provision for proper means of access to
the streets which they laid out, evidontly
considering the railroad ground as public
property. In contusion Air. Wilder
says:
So far as Tevis street Is concerned, we deem
it a sufficient answer that us such street exists
on one side only of our right of wny, there cÂ«n
be no propriety in the extension of Its lines
across our land only to have the street abut
against private property. But we have taken
this occasion to present the entire matter
i more fully to the Honorable board, trusting;
the/ will recognize our desire to meet the peo
pe more than half way, and agree with us
that the policy we are lollowlng is fair to all
concerned.
; Mint Look After Insane. -
OAKLAND, CAi..Â»May 17.â District At
torney Snook rendered an opinion to the
Supervisors to-day declaring that it is the
duty of the officers of the Receiving Hos
pital to keep insane patients under the
new act. The matter of a keeper 1Â« left by
the law to the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, and if the regular help of the
Receiving Hospital is not sufficient to
look after lunatics pending examination
and commitment to an asylum, additional
help musl be employed. The cost and
expense of such care and attention are to
be borne by the town or city securing
such commitment.

YOUNG ELOPERS
GET SAFELY OFF
Ray Torras Did Not Receive

He and His Brds Left Oakland
on the Overland

The Bride Met Her Parents and Said
Good-By, but There Was No
Shooting-
Oakland Office Ban Franctbco Call,)
903 Broadway, Way 17. S
Ray Torras did the Lochinvar act with
safety yesterday, although he made use of
the overland train instead of a trusty
steed. After the trouble on Saturday,
when Mrs. McCord tried to pull her
daughter out of a buggy in which 9ho was
ndinp with her young husband, Mr. and
Mrs. Torras decided to change their
quarters.
Mrs. Torras went to the home of her
mother and carefully packed up her be
longings. Being of legal age, her mother
was informed it would be useless to at
tempt to prevent her or to do anything
toward separating the young bride and
proom. After packing up, the young
lady placed her valise and trunu in a
bucgy and, with her mother by her side
and her portly father standing on the
axle behind and hanging on to the seat,
ihey drove to Fruitvale station yesterday
in time for Mrs. Torras to get the over
land train.
Ray Torras, the young husband, was a
very mad young man yesterday. The
stories told about him by his mother-in
law roused his anger and he told his friends
that tbe world's population of adults
would bedecreasfd by one before nient.
Torras is well ksown as a lighter, having
figured conspicuously some months Â«po in
a fight at tlie Hermitage over the affec
tions of a girl who afterward tried to end
her life by shooting herself. Yesterday,
however, he shot oft nothing more dan
gerous than a large amount of language
and ;-ucceede(l in meeting his young wife
on the overland train after she had bidden
her parents good-by. The young couple
intend to stay in the East until the atmos
phere at Fruitvale is moro congenial to
both of them.

THE LABOE CONVENTION.
Delegates to Meet ami Discuss the I
Hawaiian Labor Question. ,
When the California Labor Convention
adjourned sine die shortly alter the ad
journment of the last Legislature it was
believed that its mission was ended. Its
purpose Was to take such action as yeas
necessary to secure toe passage of certain
laws of advantage to labor. An effort is
being mado to revive the convention, as
will be seen by the following notice sent
out to nil of the delegates: Â.
Pan Francisco, May 16, 1897.
Dear Sir and Brother: You Â»re earnestly
requested to attend Â» special m -etinc of the
delegate! of the California Labor Convention,
to be held on the evening of the 18th
at the usuil place, for the purpose of acting
upon the report of Ltbor Commissioner Fitz
gerald in regard to displacing Asiatic with
white labor in the Hawaiian Inlands.
; v -,yix . â¢ .â - â  â â¢ J. .Rose, Chairman.
While many may attend the meeting to
nichtatols^"Marketstreet, there are many
who will not. The latter take the ground
that the convention went out of existence
when it adjourned sine die, and that they

as delegates were discharged by their re
spective labor unions and therefore have
no rignt to represent their unions at to
night's meeting. Those favoring the re
assembling of the convention declare that
by virtue of the words sine die (without
day) t c convention did not set a special
dote for reassembling, but that the chair
man has the richt to make a day for call
ing the convention together again.
OLYMPIC BOXING BOUTS.
Tho rujrilUt^ Are In Good Trim for
This Evening's Entertainment.
The Olympic Club has made fall and
complete preparations for this evening's
fistic entertainment at Woodward* Pa
vilion.
It wn reported yesterday that because
of the death of young Lawlor's father the
"curtain-raiser" would have to be declared
off; but the superintendent of the ciub
says that there is no hing in tne report
and that all the matches advertised will
go on on time.
The first event will be called at 8 p. H.
sharp, and those who will tarry by the
wayside, as in former exhibitions, will
miss seeing what may possibly be the
most interesting event of the evening.
Jeffries and Gans are in superb condi
tion and the latest intelligence from
Blanken's is to the effect that Baker and
.Leonard are also in good condition.
Bruting, however, is 2 to 1 that the Six
mile training resort will not produce a
winner.
Gans, however, will be watched very
closfly, and should he not debt up to his
usual form the referee will introduce a
measure that may not prove financially to
the satisfaction of the colored pugilist.
The entertainment promises to be a great
success.
DIED AT AUBUEN.
Unexptc'ed Demise of J. A. Boyken of
the "Siiaka" Drugstore.
J. Arthur Boyken, proprietor of the
well-known "Snake" drugstore, on Grant
avenue and Sutter street, died at Auburn,
Pacer County, yesterday morning.
He had bean in failing health for some
time and went to Arizona to recuperate.
He returned last Wednesday feeling rauc h
improve.!, and next day went to Auburn
to remain for a month or two. The news
of nis death was quite unexpected.
He leaves a widow and four children,
and the widow on receipt of the news leit
on the first train for Auburn. She will
return with the body to this City.
The deceased was a native of Germany,
47 years of age, and arrived in New York
in 1869. He came to California in 1875 and
obtained employment in the store of Dr.
Lsipnitz, the "snake doctor." In 1887 he
was made a partner, and on the death of
Dr. Leipnitz a few years ago he was by his

"WHERE AM I AT?"
Ths Pathetic Inquiry of a
Mao in the Police
Courts.
E. Cadenasso'* Rougi Experience In
Trying to G t H s Money Back
From Mrs- Mass-
E. Cadenasso is iike the member < f
Congress who made himself famous with
the inquiry, 'Whercam lat? 1
Some week! ago Cadenasso loaned $200
to a Mrs. Sophie Mas?, accepting as se
curity an assignment of htr property at
15C9 Steiner street. Subsequently the
woman sold the property to another man,
and as Cadenasso believed himself duped
he had the woman arrested on a charge of
obtaining money under falss pretenses.
The case proved most complicated when
heard before Police Judge Campell, the
evidence show.ng that while Cadenasso
bad actually been defrauded, Mrs. Mass
had been made the catspaw in the affair
for the benefit of others.
In view of this fact Judge Campbell
seemed inclined to be lenient with her,
ana as her friends offered to pay back the
borrowed money he asked the prosecuting
witness if he was satisfied to dismiss the
charge providing ne received his $200.
That "uiteil Cadenasso to a nicety and
he so declared.
The court was incidentally reminded by
the Prosecuting Attorney "that he was
placing himself in the position of a collec
tion agency, whereupon Judge Campbell
dismissed the case.
Yesterday Cadenasso was again up as
complainant before Judge Low, Mrs.
Sophie Mass being the defendant. The
same testimony as produced on the first
trial was again heard with the same re
suit.
"I'm inclined to bo lenient with you,
madam," stated Judge Low. "I will hold
you to answer on this cliare-e and release
you on a small bond, sxy $500."
Attorney Lucius Solomon, who repre
sented Mn Macs, pleaded that the
woman could not even furnish such a
j small bond on account of her lack of
I friends.
"But," he added, "were it not that I do
not wish to be regarded as compounding
a felony, I would willingly, out of friend
ship for this unfortunate woman, pay the
complainant his $200"
"Why not go on her bond, then?" asked
Judgo Low.
"I would sooner pay the $200 than do
that. And, besides, the Supervisors have
prohibited attorneys from going on the
bonds of their clients."
"That makes no difference here; the
Supervisors are not running this court,"
the Judge said. "I will accept your bond
in this case."
Attorney Solomon persisted he would
prefer paying t be $200 if it were permitted.
Cadenasso was asked if he would be sat
isfied with getting back his money and a
dismissal of the charge. He looked ihe
picture of despair, and remembering h:s
experience in Judge Campbell's court he
answered, hesitatingly:
"No; I want my money, but I want the
woman prosecuted."
Judge Low was quife indignant. Tnrn
ing to Cauenasso he remarked: "Tuis
looks too much like persecution. You
don't care enough for your money being
returned but want to have this woman
punished also. I dismiss the case.' 1
Cadenasso could have dropped through
the courtroom floor.
"What !' heshoutea. "In Judge Camp
bell's court the case was dismissed be
cause I wanted to accept my money and
lot the woman go, and in this couri the
case is di> missed because I did not want to
take my mone7 and let her go. Where
can I get justice?"
Through his attorney?, Ruef and Ross,
Cadenasso proposes bringing the matter
before the urand Jury.

TILTON GETS HIS MONEY.
Judge Hebbard I>ecideÂ« That the
New City Map I* All
Bight.
Judge Hebbard has decided that City
Surveyor Tilton is entitled to collect a
balance of $7000 due for the latest official
map of the Ciiy and County of San Fran
cisco.
When the map was completed some time
ago it was accepted by the Board of Super
visors and the bill was ordered paid, but
George W. Daywalt objected and brought
suit to enjoin City Treasury Widber, who
was aboiu to hnnd over the money.
At the first hearing of the case the court
said that there did not apnear to be any
thing irregular in the conduct of the Su
pervisors, but permission to amend the
complaiut was gramed. The matter came
up again yesterday and as the pleadings
did not appear sufficient to warrant any
lurther atteniion by the court an order
was made dismissing the action.

A Second-Hand Account of
the Wooing of
Barillas.
LIKE A PRINCE IN THE
STORY.
Attorney Dimond Relates Miss
Blair's Story of Her
Wrong.
BELIEVED SHE WAS BASELY
DECEIVED.
The Part Ribas Played in the Dram;
of the Coff c Millionaire's
Lovi- Making
With all his pesos and acres of coffee
General Manuel L. Barillas was not a
model Lotharioâ that i?, of coarse, if one
is disposed to believe the story of his love
making second-banded. He had a habii
of tossing cigarette stumps playfully over
the carpet of his inamorata, when a less
effusive lover would have probably laid
them carefully on the piano to the an
guish of the varnish and the servant girl.
But possibly they do things differently
down in Central America.
But of his geneiosity no criticism can
be made, and in a liberality that scatters
diamonds and ao.ltrs broadcast small de
tails of etiquette in winning hearts may be
legitimately excused. For in the ?quabbie
tbat has arisen between Henry P. Dimond
and Miss Lillian G. Blair, and various
lawyers on either side, there is a unan
imity of opinion on the sabject of the
"general 1 -;" lavish and princely manner
of making presents right and left.
Armando Riba?, who is after Dimond's
gore because the lawyer dare refer to him
as a "hotel runner,"' avows there is no
grander man living than the Guatemalan
ex-President. Attorney Milton S. Eisner
has magnanimously compared the Cen
tral American magnate to the Prince of
Waies.

baron is a true blue millionaire. Miss
Blair, her sister and her mother liave only
bouquets of good things for the man who
befriended them. The only hitch seems
to be that Barillas is out of reach of sub
pena or attachments, and the only bone
left for the lawyers to growl over is the
relic of his heart-breaking amours in this
City. "Alas and alack Â» uay, were he only
here now," is the only dirge all hands are
singing.
The case has resolved itself into a sort
of smoking out affair, a still hunt for a
fibber, and each side is out for a vindica
tion at the bands of the public. Di
mond and bis lawyers declare Miss
Blair has eiven them the "double cross,"
and Milton Eisner and Louis Hirach talk
darkly of n blackmailing conspiracy.
The affidavit period has been reached.
Dimond got first inning yesterday and
told many of the details of the wooing of
Barillas by means of an interpreter and a
dictionary. Of course the lawyer was
only reciting the narrative as he declared
he bad beard it from Miss Blair.
The deposition was made in the law
offices of Reinstein & Eisner, and all par
ties except Louis Hirsch had foregathered
to hear it. Miss Blair, her sister, Mrs.
Mamie Phillips, and her mother, Mrs.
Blair, supported Attorney Eisner, who
played tne part of cross-examiner. At
torneys Crittendon, Thornton and Henry
Ach flanked Dimond, and Attorney
Metzer acted as Mentor to Eisner. A
peppery politeness pervaded the room.
The lawyers countered and fenced with
chile con came circumspectness.
Once they disagreed on the meaning of
the word "Mrs." as used on an envelope
the millionaire had sent to Mrs. Blair.
Attorney Dimond, who wa< reading the
letter to the shorthand reportÂ°r as an ex
hibit, called it "Mistress." Eisner would
not have it this way at all. It was
"Missus," and he vigorously objected to
such misinterpretation of any records.
They fought it out on "Mistress" and
"Missus" until the referee called for a
dictionary.
Dimond was, of course, justifying his
action in bringing a suit for $10,000 against
Miss Biair; not that he expects any judg
ment for his pains; he is simply, he says,
exposing the perfidy of the young woman,
and Eisner in turn declares he is going to
expose Dimond. Everybody courts the
fullest investigation excepting Miss Blair.
But the lawyers will not permit her to be
the mummy at the feast. She is going to
have the star's place in the drama, no odds
how the wind-up comes. For was it not
she that the Central American laid siege
to, and, after all, that's the pith of tiie
story, let the attorneys caterwaul as they
will.'
Matters were opened by Dimond recit
ing that t>e was borÂ» in Keofeuk, lowa,
studied law in San Jose, incorporated a
vapor-engine company, became a partner
with Barclay Henley and finally went it
alone about two years ago. Dr. E. F.
Perrault introduced him to Miss Blair and
Mrs. Phillips last Derember, and then for
the first time the lawyer declared that he
tieard the story of Barillas' wooing and
heartbreaking. As he got it from the
woman's own lips it was something in
this wise:
Some time last June Ribas ap
proached the cashier's kiosk m Gnnst's
cigar-'toie under the Baldwin Hotel and
akked Miss Blair's permission to introduce
his friend, General Barillas, to her. The
introduction followed, so nil flowers and
bouquets. The Guatemalan was an ar
dent lover. Two weeks trom that time he
invited her to the Delrnonico restaurant
to dinner, and in the course of the feast
declared his passion and asked her to be
come his wife, or rather Ribas d.id, which
was the same thing, for Barillas couldn't
speak English and Miss Blair was at sea
in Spanish. Ribat was mutual translator
of the feelings of the lovers, and after
champagne it was arranged that the wooer
and his interpreter should call next day
and make peace witti the mother of the
tnmcee. Mrs. Blair had just returned from
Usiab and at first was no; inclined to look
with favor on ttio turn affairs had taken,
but alter hearing Rib.is she was won over
to the cause and congratulations, tears
and a blessing followed.
Eisner was for details and be wanted to
hear every word that had passed between
Dimond and Miss Blair in Perrault's
office. Dimond went over his narrative
step by step. At his first interview with
Miss Blair and her sister, they produced
the evidence of Barillas' protestations of
love in the shape ot forty-eight letters,
half Eiglish, hali Spanish, and seven
photographs. These Dimond duly pro
duced and Eisner demanded them. Ach.
however, superciliously exacted a promise
that they would be returned. Everybody
seemed suspicious, and in the end Dimond
resolved to hang on lo these exhibits, and
contented himself with expressing bis
willingness to rÂ«ad thoir contents into the
record.
These little difficulties temporarily ad
ju ted, Dimond went back to the thread
of his narrative. He did not like the
look of the case at first, but afier he had
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1897.
digested some of the letters he came to
the conclusion that Miss Blair had a
cause of action. On a second interview he
accepted the case, on a contingent fee of
one-half the damages obtained.
Ribas was not a persona j.rata in the
courtship, notwithstanding his useful
ness as interpreter, accor-iing to Dimond.
Miss Biair, so the lawyer said, spoke of
him nurinir the interview as "that dirty
old Ribas," and subsequently Miss Blair
referred to him as a "-nake in the grass"
and a devil. When the expected remit
tances from Barillas during his trip to
Europe failed to arrive, Dimond declared
the Blair family intimated that Ribas was
pocketing the money intended lor them.
But Ribas had his uses.
When the general wanted a nice dinner
the interpreter was commissioned to order
it at the Palace Hotel and see that it
reacned the Blair home. And when that
Deimonioo dinner was over Ribas trans
lated the feelings of the Central American
in this way : "He admires you; he is very
much in iove wiih you and desires to
make you his wife." At least that was
how Dimond declared Miss Blair said it
was dontÂ».
Mi>s Biair kept company with Barillas
from June to August, when the coffee
baron left for Europe. Then came rumors
to her of "another girl," and then it began
to dawn upon i.er that sho had been de
serted.
Eisner asked Dimond if Miss Blair had
not told him sue kiew that Barillas was
married.
"Sue did not," was the reply. "She
told me she believpd him a widower. He
had once pulled out a letter at the dinner
table, which he said was from his daugh
ter After that she never referred to his
domestic life, believing him, so she said,
to be a widower. She wished to keep their
engagement a secret, if possible, and only
two or three relatives knew of it. A
young lieutenant, who was calling on her,
"broached the matter one night."
Dimond went again to the beginning of
his tale. At his first interview with Miss
Blair, brought about by i)r. Perrault, who
was by the way his regular physician, he
learned that Barillas had betrayed her, in
addition to promising to marry her. He
had given her $UOO on his departure to
Europe, as well as a credit at the White
House and City of Paris.
'â¢ 'This dress is a p-esent from him,' she
said," continued Dimond. 'He bougtn
her a sealskin sacque at Liebes', worth

$3GO. Bhe spoke of the general lit- f
terine her carpets with cigarette stumps I
after a dinner downtown. Again she re
ferred to his leaving her house in tears
and almost falling down the steps into
the hands of a hackman. I believed that
she was a wroneed woman. I marveled
that Barillas was big enough fool to put
himself in black and white, wnen 1 read
the letters she gave me."
"Did you ask Miss Blair if she had |
isked Mr. Gunst if Barillas was a married
man?"
"She did not. She referred me to Gunst
a* h reference and he told me she was an
innocent girl. Bne told me that the boys
at the cigar-store 'joshed' her about her
acquaintance with the general, but as she
w;is a favored employe she soon shut them
up."
"You knew that Miss Blair, as cashier
in a cigar-store, was in the habit of meet
ing meh of the world? Did it not strike
you as peculiar that she would not learn
that Barillas was married in some way? 1 '
"No and yes," answered D.mond. "I
believed these people lived a secluded life.
I realized that they were in straitened
circumstancesâ they told me they worked
in cigar-stores and restaurants for $15 a
weekâ lnat their social station was not
such as to brine them into contact with
men nf the world."
And thus Dimond continued. He told
of stories of dinners aÂ». the Palace and
rides to Peralta School, where the general
had paid for a year's schooling for Miss
Blair's brother. Miss B:air, so Dimonn
said, believed Barillas worth $15,000,000.
and it was first proposed to sue for $250.
--000 damages on a double charge of breacti
of promise and betrayal. The particulars
of the division of the damages followed.
A few days* prior to his return from
Europa Miss Blair sent her lover a gold
match bÂ«x, which he failed to receive.
The present was returned to the giver by
the postoffice authorities, and at the con
clusion of the proceeding* Dimond pro
duced it as one of hi* exhibits. At Miss
Blair's request it was returned to her.
Inside the box was a card upon which the
young woman had inscribed her love for
the Guatemalan in this wise:
Mi Manuel, mi vida, mi alma, Jii predilccto,
acceptor este en senal, de en .Pruoba dp amor
despuses. Proprio, Lillian.
Attorney Thornton was ungallant
enough to say that Miss Blair had re
course to a dictionary to produce this
effusion. Tlie word "acceptor," he said,
should bÂ« "acceptador" and the transla
tion would then be in this wise:
My Manuel, my life, my soul, my beloved
fiancee, this is a sign of in proof of love besides.
Thine own, Lillian.
Attorney Dimond said that an agree
ment had at one time been reached to
compromise for $20,000 on tne principle
that half a loaf is better than none.
Barillas had no property that could be
levied on and there might be difficulty in
collecting a large judgment.
The deposition will be continued at 1
o'clock this afternoon.
A "Society" Story Off and Out.
One of the bits of gossip related to this
juicy scandal which floated about yester
day came from the reminiscent tongue of
an old and well-known newpaper man of
the Rialto. He knew Dr. Cranz, the en
terprisin? dentist in the case, and the
doctor cheerily told him one day that he
would bare a good story to give him soon.
it was to be about the coming marriage
of a beautiful San Francisco girl and one
of the wealthy planters of Central
America. No names were mentioned.
This was about last November, according
to this part of the gossip â while the den
tist knew the planter vaguely as "Manuel"
and before Miss Blair had so thought
lessly aud so very unfortunately whipped
out her watch in the dentist's chair and
displayed the picture of Barillas, wnich
Dr. Cranz recognized. The newspaper
man thought that he merely had a nice
society story in pickle and waited for de
velopments.
Some weeks later, at a time which now
seems to be after the timepiece revelation,
the newspaper man met Dr. Cranz on the
street and said, "Well. Doc, how about
that big wedding story?"
"Oh, that's all off,'' said the dentist
with a gesture of indifference, "it's all off.
Nothing is going to come of it after all, 1
rjuess. ''
Now this "society" story is out at last.

Arthur Sewell's big four-masted steel
ship Dirieo is riding safely at anchor in
the bay off the foot of Valie jo-street wharf.
The vessel had been given up ior lost, be
ing twenty or thirty days overdue, but a*
the underwriters were willinc to gamble
on her fate 20 per cent reinsurance was
paid on her in Liverpool a lew days ago.
Prior to her arriyal in this Dort last
evening the last sesn of the Dirigo
was in latitude 56 deg. south, 6t deg.
west, when she was passed by the British
ship Howth. The Howth arrived here
thirty days ago, and as her captain told a
gtory of a terrific hurricane he encoun
tered rounding the Horn, it was pre
sumed that the Dirigo foundered in that
storm.
"I see no reason why much uneasiness
should have been entertained over the
fate of the Dirigo," said E. S. Elwell, first
mate of the vessel, last night. "Ii this
season of the year 150 days is a fast pas
sage for a sailing-ship from New York,
and we were out 172 days. For a trip

â¢'Shortly before we reached the Horn on
the Atlantic side the first accident of the
trip occurred. John Leonard, a sailor,
fell from the topgallant halliards to i
the deck ana fractured bis skull. He
was carefully treated by Dr. Haig ol
Boson, vtrbo is traveling on the Dirigo for
his health, but he died in a few days and
we buried him at sea. A few days after
Leonard's death we ran into the storm
encountered by the Howth.
"For three days the hurricane raged and
we were frequently on our beam ends.
The cargo ol merchandise and railroad
Iron shifted, and it took twa days to trim

damage to the vessel resulted. When the

OVER THE TRAIL
OF A TRAGEDY
Gov. Budd Visits the Place
Where Blanche Lamont
Was Murdered.
Guided by Chief Lees, He As
cends to the Belfry of
Emmanuel Church.
A Visit Paid to Mrs. Caroline Leake,
Who Was an Important Wit
ness in the Trial.
Governor Budd, recognizing that execu
tive clemency alone can save Durrant
from the gallows, is making a thorough
study of the Emmanuel Church tragedy.
It is not unusual for a Governor to review
the testimony and proceedings of a mur
der trial when he holds the life of a con
demned man in his hands, but lawyers
note that it is a departure Irom the usual
custom in California for a Governor to
travel over the scene of crime with the
police detectives, interview witnesses and
talk to the lawyers in the case.
Governor Budd is doing all this in open
daylight, to satisfy his own conscience,
perhaps, and to convince the people that
his action, when taken, whatever it may
be, was founded on an intelligent and
careful consideration of tne case. It is
the rule for the judicial branch of the
Government to determine by proceeding!
in court tbe guilt or innocence of one ac
cused and for the executive branch to ex
tend mercy ii it can be extended without
detriment to the cause of justice.
Yesterday forenoon the Governor went
to the City Hall and there met Chief Lee*.
The two went in a buggy to Eruruaiiuei
Church. Others joined the party at the
church, among them District Attorney W.
S. Barnes; Euaene Deuprey, counsel for
Theodore Durrant; Rev. J. George Gib
son, pastor, and Mr. Taber. a trustee oi
the churcb. Detective Seymour was on
the premises when the Governor and
Chief arrived.
Mr. Deuprey was not apprised by the
Governor or Chiaf of Police of the proposed
visit, and therefore joined the party on
his own motion. He observed that the
Governor was diligent and thorough in his
inspection of the scene, and noted also
that the Chief Executive talked but little
beyond asking questions.
When Chief Lees saw the reporters at
the church he expressed surprise and
leigned indignation. He is quoted as
having made the remark that the report
ers had no business there.
I'a.-stor Gibson was in bis study when
the delegation visited the church, but be
preferred to remain in tne seclusion which
his study grants.
Immediately after the party entered the
churcb and barred the door a btart was
mado for the belfry. They first went to
the library on tbe first floor, where Dur
rant, according to tbe theory of the detec
tives, murdered the girl. The Governor
paused to make a thorough investigation.
District Attorney Barnes explained tbe
route to the executive.
The party then proceeded to the audi
torium. Chief Lacs leading the way to the
gallery and up the stairs, where it is sup
posed the body of the murdered girl was
dragged. Here the Governor halted to ob
serve everything and listen to Chief Lees.
By this time District Attorney Barnes
had "bellows to mend" and Chief Lees
was obliged to do most of the talking.
Meanwhile Detective Saymour remained
downstairs to guard the door. At the
landing where the body of the girl was
found, the Chief of Police told the Chief
Executive how the murderer had disposed
of the victim. From the landing the
route which Durrant is supposed to have
pursued was followed. The climbers
climbed to tbe top of the belfry. They
went ov r the ceiling and over the rafters
to the top of the sun-burners which fig
ured in the trial.
Then they wended their way to the rear
of tbe church, down the stairs and into
the Sunday-school room, where George
King, the organist, was playing the piano
when Durrant entered the room and ac
counted for his abrupt appearance by
saying that be was repairing the gas
fixtures. The Governor here paused a
long time and reflected. Chief Lees then
began at the beginning and told the story
over again, refreshing the Governor's
mind wittx details upon details.
After an hour's investigation inside the
parly emerged from tbe church and all
save Mr. Barnes went across the street,
where Mrs. Caroline Leake resides. The
District Attorney was too much exhausted
to go further.
Governor Budd was anxious to talk face
to face with Mrs. Leake for the reason
that she is the witness who swore posi
tively that she saw Theodore Durrant and
Blanche Lamont enter the side gate of the
, church ou the afternoon that tbe girl was

Leake several questions and then went to
the window to rind ont for himself if one
could distinctly -cc the eateway from the
window of the Leake residence.
Mrs. Leake reiterated her statement
that she had told the truth and the Gov
ernor seemed to be deeply impressed by
her assertions.
From Mrs. Leake's house Governor
Budu, accompanied by the Chief of Police,
went to Mrs. Crossett's bouse at Twe:Â»ty

DIVORCE DENIED.
Judge ITnnt Refimrs to Separate Isa
bella and Richard Williams.
Judge Hunt yesterday handed down a
decision in the divorce case of Isabella N.
Williams against Richard S. Williams,
which was a surprise and disappointmeui
to both parties to tho litigation.
Mrs. "Williams sued for a divorce on the
ground of cruelty, and proved that her
husband had been extremely cruel at dif
ferent times. He Oled a cross-complaint,
demanding a divorce on similar grounds
of cruelty.
In tbe course of the trial it was shown
that Mrs. Williams drew a pistol and tried
;o shoot her husband on a streetcar, and
tnat she said she was sorry she failed to
kill him.
The court weighed all the facts, aud
finding that both had been at fault ae
cided that neither is entitled to a divorce,
and so they must continue in their rela
tion of husband and wife, no matter how
irKsome the yoke may be.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST.
Annual Session of the Supreme Circle
of California.
The first session of the Supreme Circle of
the Companions of the Forest was held yester
day in Social Hall, Foresters' building. There
were present fifty-two delegates and nil the
supreme officers, Supreme Grand Chief Com
panion Mrs. Sarah Beversen in tne chair.
The committee on credentials presented Its
report, after which the reports of the supreme
grand chief companion, Supreme Grand Sec
retary Mrs. Florence N. Morrow, Supreme
Grand Treasurer Mrs. K. E. Falconer and the
supreme grand auditors were presented.
From these it appears that there is a member
ship of 1700â a decrease since the previous
session, but that there is an increase in the
funds.
As a result of the trouble which occurred at
Ukiah at the previous session charges were
preferred against Mrs. Annie Boehm and R.
Â»V. McLennan, and after thai they were fined
$500 each and expelled from the order. Yes
lerday it was stated that the ruling in the
case was a just one, as "a war measure," but
the judgment, was considered too severe. The
judgment was set aside by a majority vote.

A Wife- Beater Kicked.
W. H. Bradley, 1747 Minna street, was taken
to the Receiving Hospital yesterday afternoon
with his nose broken and his eye and cheek
bruised and swollen. He said he whs asleep
in his house when a man walked all over him
and kicked him on the face. He had beaten
his wife a few days ago and he thought it
might have been one of the neighbors, who
