CANEA, Crete, March 29.â 1t has been
arranged that a force of Anstnans shall
occupy the fort at Izzedin, which place
was attacked by insurgents yesterday
from the heights above the town of Suda.
It has also been decided that an inter
national force shall occupy the town of
Akrotiri, on the peninsula of that name.
Each of the foreign admirals has asked
his Government to send 600 troops in
order tbat the insurgents may be held in
subjection.
There does not appear to be the slightest
prospect in the near future of any im
provement in the deplorable situation ex
isting throughout the island. On the .
contrary, the outlook is darker now than j
it has been, and most of the Christians ;
are ready to fly at each other's throats
whenever the opportunity arises.
The conferences between the foreign ad
mirals and their representatives and the
insurgents appear to be productive of no
good results. Notwithstanding this the
admirals continue their efforts to arrive at
some understanding witb the insurgents
which wili lead to their laying down their
arms r.ccx jitintr the sntcnomr already
proffered ami refused. "The latest attempt
in this direction is the sending of the
Russian Consul at this place, who is well
acquainted with the insurgent -leaders, to
hold another conference with them.
The British Vice-Consul at Retimo has
sent a report here stating that the com
mander of the foreign troops at that place
reqnes'.ed the consular body to invite the
insurgent leaders in that vicinity to enter
the town to confer. The Turkish Gover- '
nor vetoed the proDosition, refusing to I
allow the entry of the rebels, whereupon \
it was decided to meet the leaders at.!
Coube. a village in- the vicinity of Retimo,
they having accepted the invitation to a
conference.
A delegation of the insurgents arrived
nt Coube Sunday and there awaited the j
coming of the Russian Consul, who ha |
been selected as a deputy to represent his j
colleagues. The 'Turkish officials had !
undertaken to inform the Consul of the j
arrival of the rebel chiefs at Coube, but |

they did not do so. When the chiefs
found that the Consul was not coming
they retired.
Thereupon the lurkish soldiers fired
unon the insurgents in the vicinity of the
town, but the latter did not reply. The
Turks then fired again, with a result that
they had not anticipated. A large force
of infuriated rebels swarmed down from
the hills and would probably have anni
hilated the Moslems had it not heen for a
strong detachment of shi Bazouks who
were dispatched fr-m Retimo to the aid of
their endangered coreligionists.

lasted until darkness, rendering further
fighting useless. The Turks returned to
the town and the insurgents withdrew to

was sent to them by the foreign admirals
informing the insurgents that the sup
plies must be allowed to go to the TurKs,
otherwise the foreign warship? and troops
would resort to force to compel obedience
to tneir demands. In the meantime, the
admiral said, the insurgents captured the
Turkish blockhouse at Malaxa. [Cheers

The foreign admirals, the telegrams
stated, then decided that it was necessary
to drive the insurgents out of the block
house, and accordingly the warships
opened fire upon them. .The firing lasted
six minutes, at the end of which time the
insurgents evacuated the blockhouse, but
not before they had looted and burned it.
[Renewed Irish cheers]
Mr. Curzon continued his reading after
the cheers had subsided. The British ad
miral wired that owing to repealed at
tacks on the part of the insurgents, the
j foreign admirals decided to treat them as

LONDON, Eng., March 29.â Instead of
improving the condition of affairs in
Europe seems to-; be getting worse, and it
is now only the! most sanguine who hope
to avert war. It ia almost certain that* it
the King of Greece should attempt* to
withdraw the ' troops , from the; frontier
without a fight with' the" Turks the troops
would march on Athens and dethrone the
King. More than ever is it evident that
war and retirement are the two alterna
tives facing King. The departure of
Crown Prince. Constantino- to take com
mand of the Greek troops in, Thessaly in

lose his crown if he can help it.
The war fever among the s Greeks is as
hot as ever and they "are not willing to
listen to reason. Rumor 3 that the powers
are' ; disagreeing among; themselves have
strengthened this feeling* and led the
Greeks to believe that case of war they
: will not be without friends. ' That is what
the more level-headed among them are
calculating on. - They know that if war
between Greece and Turkey, should occir
and if there should be no interference by
â¢outsiders, the great numerical superiority
of '; Turkey would cause that; country to
triumph in the end. *' But they know, also,
or confidently believe, that before such
a result was reached ' the powers of
Europe would be involved |on opposite
sides and that the struggle would be more
even. ''**' ""''â¢'"-''"' *"_ ' 'â 'â¢'

The office of president of the Northern

Then, too, Lamont would probably be
acceptable to the Deutsche Bank interests'

SOCIALISTS TO "LIE LOW."
They Will Ignore the Celebration of the
Kaiser Wilhelm I Fetes and Pre-,
pare for May Days.
"BERLIN, Germany, March 29.â During
! the Kaiser Wilhelm I fete the Social Dem
ocrats held aloof from all participation
and have since pracically ignored the
celebration. Their leaders have refrained
from even criticizing the festivities ex
cept when occasionally sneering at the
utterances of loyal papers. The reason
for this can be well understood. . The So
cialist leaders have been taught by experi
ence carefully to avoid a brush with tne
Kaiser over "anything in, wnich he espe
cially interests himself and upon which
tbev cannot assail a minister, so the So
cialist cue was to "lie low.". They are
already organizing their own fetes for
May day, however, but there is no new
feature in the projected programme.

day where they can do so without injur

DUTY OF CONGRESS TO CONTROL
PACIFIC ROADS. 7 /V^
The Unit d Slate?, Says th- Senator,
Cannot Afford to Lose Control : -
of the Great Highway.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.â
Morgan submitted the views of the mi
nority of the Committee on Pacific Rail
roads in the Senate to-day on the bill to
amend the act for the construction of the
Pacific railroad bill reported by Gear,
March 18, 1897.
"Legislation,'' says Morgan, "that sepa
rates the Central Pacific and the Union
Pacific roads in two competitive parts de
stroys the greatest value and denies to the
people the real advantages of the great
transcontinental highways created for
their benefit and built with their money
under the laws that this bill seeks to
abolish.
'â¢A leading purpose in building this
great system of railway was to establish a
National highway across the continent
for Government purposes, every mile of
which* should be perpetually connected
with and dependent upon every other
mile for commercial, value, for its opera
tions and Tor its control 7by the Govern
ment of the United States as an instru
mentality in government in all its length
from r the Missouri River to the Pacifio
Ocean. These matters should not be cast
aside even to provide for the most honest
private demands.'.' '
The pending _ bill, , Morgan ' says, is in
tended to abandon the great duty of Con
gress.' to control these roads and protect
the money of the people. The companiei
do not hold their corporate rights by con
tract with the Government. They are ex
pressly affected with the duties and obli
gations of a great public j trust, to be ex
ecuted ; and administered in conformity
with the law enacted for that purpose in
the observance of a declared public policy.
The pending bill, Morgan says, provides
for an agreement with the "owners" of
the Central Pacific interest, declaring who
owns it, and deals with it as if the United
States Government is not, the owner. In
making this final disposition of the prop
erty, the bill, he contends, destroys the
unity of this great highway and proposes
to separate the Central from the Onion
Pacific by an act that Congress alone can
sanction. No court could thus ignore or
defeat the public interests that unite
these roads in one continuous system
without violating the law of the land. An
act of Congress proposing to change the
law ought never, Morgan says, be passed.
This fatal act of separation 7 between
these roads has not reached a stage tbat
is conclusive upon the Government; it
should be intercepted and placed by act of
Congress in the hands of the commission
provided in tnis bill if it becomes
a law. The United States could no
more afford to have this great highway
pass beyond its reach as an instrumental
ity of Government 'than Great Britain
could afford to have the Canadian Pacific,
which, in a military sense, is the spinal
column of the empire, pass into the hands
of the American Government.
â¢Morgan says there should be no sale of
the Union Pacific until authority for such
transaction appears} in - the statutes, and
he deplores the lack of information vouch
safed by the executive' to the legislative
branch of the Government on this subject.
If legal authority exists to make this sale,
such . authority, he .-,- contends, should ' be
withdrawn before the -sale Â« is concluded.2
Tbe nature of the transaction condemns it
as a usurpation of authority by the ex
ecutive that has no support in law. It is
too much to ask that Congress shall stand
by and witness a disposal of this vast
property under a private agreement be
tween the executive and a great railroad
combination without even a protest, and
shall enlarge its jurisdiction to give the
semb'.ancs of judicial sanction to such
proceeding.
The proposed sale of the Union Pacific
was to enable a great railroad combina
tion to control transportation from New
York to the Pacific over that rdad. Mor
gan denies the justice of endeavoring to
shoulder the settlement of this question
on the executive. It was a scheme to
shelter this Union , Pacific "behind the
sacred respect that would be felt for a
settlement by the President." The Presi
dent should not be forced to act as umpire
in a contest between crime and public
justice, and to invite him to find some
middle ground of adjustment that will
result in condoning the wrongs, and in
the relaxation of the duty of the Govern
ment.
"There cannot be," says Morgan, in
conclusion, "a more dangerous political
arrangement in any form of proceeding
to be employed in the administration or
disposal of these railroad properties and
franchises than that which is provided
in the bill reported to the Senate. No one
was ever offered the control of a mors
powerful and dangerous political lever
age than is presented in this bill to the
President and his Cabinet. That it will
not be improperly used is no reason why
Congress should recognize so dangerous a
departure from safety."
FROZEN ALCOHOL EXPLODES.
Fifteen Amateur Scientists Experiment
With a New Discovery With
Startling Results.
NEW YORK, N. V-, March Fifteen
men â lawyers, bankers and merchants â
residing on Upper West Side, who are in
the habit of meeting in the Hotel Endi
cott, at Eighty-first street and Columbus
avenue, to discuss scientific problems,
were the victims of a peculiar explosion
that occurred there on Saturday night
during the progress of one of their experi
ments, the details of which leaked out
yesterday. The object that exploded was
a common tumbler half filled with frozen
alcohol, to which one of the gentlemen
appl ed a match, with the result that
tbree doctors in the immediate neighbor
hood were called in and spent three hours
in extracting particles of glass from the
anatomies of the experimenters, three of
whom were so severely injured that they
were confined to their homes yesterday.
A secret compound discovered by
Charles E. Tripler, a chemist and in
ventor, was the remote cause of the
strange disaster. Tripler had been ex
perimenting for some time with the ob
ject of obtaining an inexpensive and satis
factory freezing mixture, which .when
exposed to the air would produce an ex
ceedingly low temperature by rapid
evaporation. ..* . JJr/J
Tripler had just succeeded in finding
what he has been so long searchine for,
and learning of his success the coterie
of amateur scientists, all of wnom are
his personal friends, asked him to give
an exhibition of his powers. Tripler
accordingly brought some of it to the
Endicott on Saturday. Some of the
liquid was poured upon bread, which
immediately froze solid, then into a
glass of whisky, which immediately con
gealed, and finally into a glass of pure al
cohol, with the same result. The alcohol
had been frozen and Tippler stepped to
the other side of the cafe to. explain the
action of the mixture to several friends,
fifteen or twenty genilemen gathered
around R. J. Dean, president of a cold
storage company, who was testing the
frigidity of the alcohol. All of the freez
ing compound had evaporated, leaving the
alcohol a mass of ice in the bottom of the
glass. As it began to melt Dean struck a
match and held it to the alcohol to see if
it retained its inflammable properties.
Instantly there was a vivid flash ot
white flame, followed by a loud explosion
that sounded like the discharge of a small
cannon, and the men around the table
staggered, blinded and dazed, in all direc
tions, bleeding from numerous wounds
on their bodies, hands and face;*, caused
by the flying bits of glass which were
hurled with terrific force all around the
room. Dean narrowly escaped losing his
sight. Fortunately none of the class
entered his eyes, but the muscles were
strained and his face was covered with
small cuts. Every one in the room re
ceived some of the flying particles of glass
and was cut and bruised.
In discussing the cause of the explosion
last night Tripler said it was a puzzle to
him, as the chemical compound was per
fectly harmless in itself. Tripler intends
to follow up the matter and find, if possi
ble, just what caused the explosion. Per
haps a discovery of great importance to
science will result from the accidental ex
plosion.
PICKLER WAMiS A PLACE.
Very Anxious to Become Commissioner

NEW YORK, N. V., March 29.â Sun
special from Washington says: It is not
at ail settled that ex- Representative Pick
ler is to be Commissioner of Indian
Affairs. Two more formidable candidates
are yet to be pacified. Needles of Illinois
and Elliott of the District of Columbia.
When H. Clay Evans accepted the Com
missioners iip of Pensions it was thought
certain that Major Pickler would be Indian
Commissioner. The friends of the other
two candidates, however, could not see
things this way. They contended that
Pickler had never been a candidate for In
dian Commissioner and had just cast bis
eyes in the direction of that place after
seeing that everything else in sight was
spoken for. 'â¢'
Senator Kyle of South Dakota, who owes
his election to Pickler, is doing all he can
to have him placed, while both the Illinois
Senators, Cullom and Mason, are using
their efforts to have Needles landed.
Elliott's friends have importuned the
President to appoint him and they claim
to have assurances that he will be ap
pointed. *

by the Committee on Ways and Means
were agreed to as follows: Increasing

appeal was made for protection to the
article by Maddox (D.) of Georgia, in both
of which States bauxite was found in great
quantities sufficient to supply the whole
country. The amendment was intended
to equalize conditions so that the Ameri

French clay which was transported over

The amendment was agreed to. The
duty on common brown and yellow
earthenware was increased from 15 to 25
per cent ad valorem. An omission in the
bill was corrected by inserting in the para
graph covering silvered glass cylinder and
crown glass. The pararaph included
only polished plateglass silvered.
Allen (D.) of Mississippi had read edito
rials from two Western Republican papers
crit cizing the general debate on the tariff
bill, particularly mentioning ttie speeches
of Dotiiver and Grosvenor.

Dingley having moved that debate on

Indiana objected so strenuously, persist

into t -c coram ittee of the whole.
Bland (D.) of Missouri then spoke on
the silver question, and when the few
minutes allotted him expired moved a
formal amendment to extend it further.
And upon each committee amendment of
fered he would take up the thread of his
remarks, greatly to the amusement of the
House. ':J-J'/'
The chairman finally warned Bland to
confine his remarks to the subject.
Ricnardson (D.) of Tennessee, referring
to the debate last week, said the Demo
crats had been accused of juggling with
figures in their assertion that rales in the
pending bill were higher than those of the
McKinley bill.
He wou.d not specify the articles. In
twenty-nine sub-articles in schedule B of
this bill the rates were higher than the
McKinley bill, while thirteen were on the
free list in the Wilson bill and the peop c i
were taxed $164 005 more by this schedule j
tuan by the same schedule in the Mi Kin
ley bill. In schedule A, forty-nine were ;
heavier than McKinley rates and sixty
seven were on the free list of the WiNon |
bill, the duties being $2,018,975 more, j
And he referred to asphaltum, upon j
which .i tax of $282,851 was to be levied.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio said the gentle- I
man was very unfortunate in picking out
articles which were controlled by one of I
the most exorbitant monopolies or trusts j
in tho country. It was nearly all a for- j
eign* product and paid the Queen of Eng
land a royalty of $1 40 a ton. The com- !
mittee thought it could as well pay this i
Government a like tax, especially as there
were undeveloped mines in California and
Utah which were practically inexhaustible.
De Vries (D.) of California owned that
his district contained immense deposits
of asphaltum, but declared the price
would be increased by the imposition Â«f a
duty unless Congress first took up the Pa
cific railroad question and compelled those
great corporations to charge reasonable
prices in place of the present exorbitant
rates. â¢ 77; '/'
The provision in the metal schedule ad

JAPAN'S GOLD STANDARD.
One Hundred and Forty Million Yen in
Silver That May Have to^Be
Redeemed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.â The
Secretary of the Treasury is in receipt
of information from the United States
Minister at Tokio, Japan, that during
the present session of the Japanese Diet
a Government coinage bill will be pre
sented for the consideration of that
body, which will, if passed, change the
standard of value in Japan from silver
to gold. It is proposed to fix the Govern
ment parity, or ratio, between the two
metals at 32 to 1. The unit of value will
be a gold yen, which will be one-half the
weight and value of the old Japanese gold
yen, which is of the same weight and fine
ness as the gold dollar of the United States.
The proposed unit of value will there
fore te the exact equivalent of 50 cents
in the United States, and approximately
of tho same value as the present unit of
value in Japan, the silver yen, which at
the current rate of exchange is worth
about 51 cants in United States money.
It is proposed that the smallest coin
minted shall be a 5-yen piece. Further
coinage of silver will be limited to sub
sidiary coins. The silver yen now in cir
culation will be maintained at par with
I the gold yen, the Government being pre
| pared to redeem them in gold whenever
| called upon to do so. It is important to
note that there are about 1-0,d00,000 of
Japanese siiver yen in circulation, of
which it is estimated that about 70,000,000
are in circulation as money in China and
the English, French and other colonies
and settlements in the East. .onld the
ratio between gold and silver become j
greater than 1 to 32 the tendency would
seem to be to drive the outstanding silver
coin back to Japan for redemption.
The vernacular press reports consider
able dissatisfaction among the manulac
tuting and- commercial classes upon the
proposed change of standard, and it is re
ported that the Cotton-spinners' Associa
tion has prepared a protest against it. .
Those interested in manufactures in
Japan are at present very prosperous and
satisfied with the returns their invest
| ments are bringing in. They are naturally
j as a class not disposed to view favorably a
proposed change, the effects of which
upon their interests they have no means
[of determining beforehand. It is generally
believed, however, j that the Government
bill will in a perhaps modified form be
come a law. It is supposed that the prin
cipal object the Government has in view
in bringing about the chance is to enable
it, should such n measure become neces
sary or expedient, to nego iate a loan in
Europe on better terms than would be
| possible, as they believe, if Japan re
mained on a silver basis.

WASHINGTON, D. C. March 29.â
Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart of Cali
fornia is in the city. He filed in the
United States Supremo Court to-day a
motion to dismiss the appeal of the con
testants in the case of Florence Blyt

SENATORS ARGUE ARBITRATION.
Bacon of Georgia Says Salisbury Cannot
Find an Excuse to Refuse to
Ratify the Treaty.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.â The
debate on the arbitration treaty in the
Senate to-day was dull and spiritless and
of short duration. .
Bacon of Georgia spoke in favor of such
amendments to the convention as suould
effectually eliminate certain questions
from arbitration under the terms of the
treaty. He thought it was essential
to either adopt the . amendment
of Mr. Chilton, which leaves the
Senate to act upon and approve
any and all propositions submitted
to arbitration or to eliminate the great
questions involving the Monroe doctrine,
matters of foreign or domestic policy and
kindred subjects by name. He denied
that Lord Salisbury would be. justified in
rejecting the treaty, as was reported in
some of the press dispatches, if it were so
amended, or if it were made applicable to
pecuniary claims only. He would be
stopped from such rejection by his own
attitude when the treaty was being nego
tiated, inasmuch as he at that time in
sisted that only such matters should be
included. _ " < . â¢ _ .
Senator Turpie of Indiana followed in
a brief speech in advocacy of the ratifica
tion of the treaty as it stood with the
committee amendments which have been
agreed to. These be believed covered
every point that has been made in criti
cism of the instrument and protected the
United States completely. When Mr.
Turpie had concluded no one elsexared to
speak and the Senate adjourned.
The vote on the various amendments
thn have been offered will be taken Wed
nesday afternoon at 2 o'clock and if any
amendments are subsequently offered the
vote on them is to be taken the next day
at 4 o'clock. After that no amendments
are to be received and the debate will be
directed against the treaty as amended by
these votes. "Chairman Davis hopes to get

pose of side-tracking real and vital issue?.
The address : further declares that "lack
of revenue is not the result of defects in
the bill (the Wilson bill) as it was passed
by, Congress, but resulted from a decision
of the Supreme Court which declared the
income tax ' unconstitutional. The most
direct and effective method would be to
restore silver and increase the circulation
of .the mediums so as to restore the level
of prices which 5 existed prior to the de
monetization of that metal." 7v

do not regard the Dingley bill as a revenue

who is living with her mother in the Na

Commenting on this story the Washing

Agriculturist Wi sen Takes Great!
Pleasure in Showing His Depart
ment to Visitors. ' '
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 29.-
The democratic habits ,- of the President
and the members of his Cabinet and their j
accessibility to callers are pleasantly com- j
mented upon. Mr. McKinley's manner
of receiving visitors - and his horseback !
rides and afternoon strolls have become j
familiar matters of conversation, It m a
maxim here that the President's person
ality can be judged by his conduct during
the first few months of his administra
tion. ' 7v~. 7"7:^ 7 -7>^;y7^7
The members of the Cabinet have '
shown a surprising but pleasing regard
for the time- honored , custom. [ They are
not bound down by . official prejudices,
but do what they want without regard for
red tape. _ - .
Wnen Secretary Gage wants to see one
of his subordinates, he is . as likely as not
to dispense with the services of a messen
ger in summoning the person needed and
to walk into his office, without warning.
Postmaster-General Gary and Secretary
Wilson are ft llowing the same plan. Mr.
Gary frequently answers calls on the tele
phone, and Mr. Wilson will take a visitor
through the Agricultural Department
conservatories and explain the varieties of
rare plants that are in the horticultural
collections. '_" .
The reputation Mr. Sherman had for ex
cluiiveness while in the Senate is net
borne out by his personal conduct as Sec
retary of State. Mr. Sherman has fol
lowed the example of the late Secretary
Gresbam in throwing opjn the doors of
bis office to all who have business with
him. Of course, as with the other mem
bers of the Cabinet, there are certain
specified hours when the Secretary is not
accessible, but liberal time is allowed all
who desire to see him.
Secretary Gage is much the same and he
frequently comes out into the office of his
private secretary, Vander ip, which is
u-ed as a waiting-room, to expedite the
bu-iness of callers.
Attorney-General McKenna is a hard
worker, but his duties at the Supreme
Court and other demands on bis time do
not operate . to any ; great extent against
those who desire to see him. The many
delegations that have called are always
courteously received and find the Attor
ney-Genera! an attentive listener.
His endeavor to grasp every detail con
corning the naval service does not con.
surne so much time that Secretary Long
cannot be reached by the many who have
gone to the Navy Department on public
matters. The Secretary is easy to reach)
and leaves an agreeable impression upon'
his callers.
General Alger, like Mr. Long, :is assid
uou-iy studying the methods of the mili
tary brancn of the Government. He is al
ways genial and , approachable, and gives
patient hearing to tho unfortunate ones.,",
The habits of a business man stick to
Mr. Bliss. ;He is at his desk in the Inte
rior Department early and manages to
transact a large amount of business dur
ing the day. If it were not for the office
seekers Mr. Bliss, would go ahead in his
customary way, conducting his depart
ment as he does his private business.' But
.the office-seekers; have no cause to com
plain. 7 They are given a liberal share of
the Secretary's time, and no dissatisfac
tion has been displayed over the manner
in which an Eastern man disposes ot mat
ters largely concerning the Western
country. -
The nearness of Mr. Gary's legal resi
dence to Washington has brought upon
him its penalty. At ncwother department
are there so many visitors anxious to -je*
its ; chief. >J His office :is : thronged every
day with crowds of persons who wan po
sitions under f. the Postoffice ' Department.
Mr. Gary sees all. who come, listen's care
fully i and . patiently ", to each visitor * and
altogether : is making himself very popu
lar among : those f who think the adminis
tration owes them something.
I A very simple man in his habits is Mr
Wilson, the Secretary of Agriculture. 5 He
is conscientious in - learning all that can
be learned about the Agricultural Depart
ment, * and, as a result, works hard and

Over His Crime. \
PHILADELPHIA Pa., March 29.â For
the .first time since July 2, when he was
sentenced to De hanged for the murder of
Actr-ss Madge Yorke, or Margaret W.
Drysdale, as she was known off the stage,
James B. Gentry was allowed on Sriaturdav
to see and talk to his counsel, George F.
Muncie. Since the hanging of Holmes
the authorities have rigidly enforced an
old law which prohibits prisoners con
demned to death from receiving any
visitors, even legal and spiritual" being
excluded.
A bill has just been passed by the Legig
lature, and j on Friday was signed by the
Governor, repealing the old Jaw and per
mitting condemned murderers to receive
visits from their lawyers, family aud any
minister whom they may dssignate.
Lawyer Muncie on this authority pre
sented himself at the prison and was ad
mitted to see his client. Gentry was very
glad to see his counsel and they neld a
long consultation over the possibilities
of securing clemency for the condemned
actor.
Muncie said Gentry was very weak and
low spirited and that he brooded con
stantly over his crime.

HAVANA. Cuba, March 29.â General
Hernandez Velasco, who is operating in
the hills of the province of Pinar del Rio,
has sent a report to the Government which
has caused much elation to all classes of
Spaniards. He says tbat while his column
was in the vicinity ot Cabezadas in the
Rio Hondo district yesterday they en
countered a party of rebels, 100 strong,
who were under the command of Ruiz
Rivera, who was appointed to the com
mand of the insurgents in Pinar del Rio
after the death of Antonio Maceo.
The rebels occupied a strong position
and fouzht stubbornly, but after an en
gagement which lasted an hour they were
deieated and dispersed. A grenade was
thrown by the Spaniards which fell among
the insurgents, and exploding wounded
many of them. This caused a panic and
many of the rebels fled.
Shortly after the explosion the Spanish
infantry penetrated the rebel position.
They found Colonel Bacallao, chief of
staff to General Rivera, attempting to
carry ths latter, who had been wounded
by three Mnsser bullets, to a place of
safety. Lieutenant Terry of the insurgent
party, who had been badly wounded by a
fragment of a shell, was also captured.
The rebels carried some of their dead with
.hem, but left on the field ten bodies tbat
they were unable to remove. The Span
ish loss was only one man killed and one
lieutenant and twenty-four privates
wounded.
General Valeaco sent General Rivera,
Colonel Bacallao and Lieutenant Terry, in
charge ol two companies of troops, to San
Cristobal, at woif-h place tbey arrived at 8
o'clock last evening. Lieutenant Terry
was so badly injured, however, that he
died on the road.
Speaking to a soldier at San Cristobal,
; General Rivera said that he had been
! kindly treated by his captors, and he com
â  plains greatly of the pains of his wounds,
but is cool and self-possessed. He has one
bullet still lodged in his thigh. He is
edged at the quarters of the guardia
.civil.
General Valesco is operating in the vi
cinity of Canezadas.
Private advices have been received here
to the effect that C. C. Crosby, the corre
spondent of a Chicago newspaper, was
killed while witnessing the recent combat
at Juan Criollo. It is stated that he was
with the rebels. No official report of his
death has been made.

RIVERA WAS SURPRISED.
Surttundrd by General Velasco's Forces
and Captured.
NEV YORK, N. V., March 30.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana, referring
to tht capture of General Ruiz Rivera,
says: 'Â»
General Ruiz Rivera was surprised at
his camp at Cabezadas, some four miles
to the lest of Consolacion del Sur. Gen
eral Velasco, who was at Consolacion with
bis column, learned of the whereabouts of
General Rivera through gome scouts of
his guerilla forces. 'He knew also that
the Cuban general had been wounded and
had few men with hia.
By a quick movement he surrounded
the camp and capture&it and Rivera, and
bis staff were made prisoners. Rivera's
â¢wounds did not allow -tm even to try to
escape. The column iq General -dc Ve
lasco is composed of soap 800 men. .-
General Rivera will tba brought to
Havana from San Cristoill and will prob
ably be shot here. Reqvsta have been
telegraphed to General Weyler to spare
his life as a civilized act which would win
sympathy for the Spanish Government,
but it is very doubtful that Weyler will
agree with this view.
The news of the capture has bee o pub
lished by La Lucha and the Diario de
Marina and has causei wild joy among
the Spaniards here.
General Velasco is enthusiastically com
plimented and a great manifestation in
his honor is preparing.
Complimentary cablegrams from Mad
rid, signed by the Duke of Tetuan and
General Azcarraga, have been sent to
General Weyler, extending congratu
lations to the army.
The successor of General Ruiz Rivera as
commander of the Cuban forces in the
province of Pinar del Rio will be Colonel
Vtdal Ducasse, a brave native of the
province of Santiago de Cuba, who came
with Maceo in the invasion from the
east. Ducasse is a mulatto, and he and
his brother have always been considered
by General Weyler himself as redoubtable
foes.
CARGO OP TBE LAURADA.
An Accurate Description of the War
Material Sent Insuraents.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 29.â El
Porvenir, the Cuban paper, published to
day for the first time an accurate state
ment of the cargo of the Laurada, which
is reported to have been landed in Cuba
on March 21 with General Carlos Roioff,
the Cuban Secretary of War, and other
leaders on board. Although the war sup
plies debarked are asserted to have ex
ceeded in quantity those of any other
expedition since the war began, it appears
from the new list that they were consid
erably less than have hitherto been
printed. The numoer of rifles, instead of
being 6000, was only 2516, and the cart
ridges 2,600,000, against 3,000,000. Instead
of three dynamite guns, as stated in a
morning paper to-dny, from information
purporting to have been furnished by a
"trustworthy source" (presumably the
Junta) there was, according to El Por
venir's admission, only one. ln addition
the invontory includes two Hotchkiss
12-pound cannon and 3500 cannon shots,
30 tons of dynamite, 5000 machetes and
j 1-5 cases of war materialâ that is, electric
batteries, fuses, machinery for repairing
rifles, parts of rifles, etc. There was also
a supply of clothes and medicines.
Concerning the statement in yesterday
morning's paper that General Roloff, who
has forfeited his bail in the Federal court
here and in Baltimore, had not sailed
with the Laurada, but was still in this
| country, a member of the Junta said that
j General Roloff undoubtedly went with
j the Laurada and was now in Cuba. "I'm
as certain of it," he said, "as that I am
sitting at this desk."

OFFICIALS WITH SOFT JOBS.
Those Put Out of Office by the Supreme
Court Decision Given Railroad Bureaus
of Information.
CHICAGO, 111., March 29. â Western
railroad mauaeers decided yesterday to
j wind up the affairs of both the Western
Freight and the Western Passenger asso
ciations. In their place bureaus of infor
mation and statistics will be formed for
I both freight and passenger business. This
was agreed upon by the general and traffic
managers of the various Western roads
! which have their headquarters in this
! city. Chairman Caldwell of the Western
| Passenger Association will become the
chief of tho passenger bureau of statistics
and information, and the members of the
board of administration of the late West
ern Freight Association C. A. Parker, H.
H. Conrtwright, C. L Wellington and H.
L. Shute â will take care of the different
departments of the freight bureau.
The offices heretofore occupied by the
Western Pa uenger Association, on the
fourth floor of the Great Northern build
ing will continue to be occupied by Mr.
! Caldwell and bis force while the lreight
bureau will have accommodations on the
j ninth floor of the same building, removing
from the Rookery building, where they
now are. All clerks and other employes
I of the associations will find employment
in the new organizations.
The reason for placing all the four mem
bers of the late board of administration in
charge of the freight bureau's work is, not
because their services are needed, but
because the roads are under contract to
pay them $10,000 per annum each for two
: years, of which term only thiee months
have expired.
Definite arrangements for the establish
ment of the hew bureaus will be made
next Wednesday, a meeting of the general
traffic officials of the Western roads having
been called for next Monday in this city,
to perfect the details of the new scheme.
At yesterday's meeting the officials of the
Chicago roads only were represented, but
at Wednesday's meeting, the officials of
all the roads in the West are expected to
â¢ be present.
Through the agency of the new organi
zations, the railroads expect to keep in
formed what the rates of each individual
road are and keep posted as to changes in
rates. With this information at band,
joint tariffs can be published by the
bureaus and shippers anu travelers can be
informed what the through rates _. are, '
while otherwise each road could only pub
lish rates over its own line, and shippers
would, m order to find out what through
rates are, have to secure information from
all the different roads over which the
business is to go.
To make uniform tariffs would be easy
enough without holding meetings for
that purpose. The roads can. send volun
tary information of what their rates are
to the bureaus, and if the rates do not
correspond the roads can be visited by the
chiefs of the bureaus with a view to secur
ing uniformity of rates.

THE ,'SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1897.
LIVELY DEBATE
IN THE COMMONS
Unjust Taxation in Ireland
Causes Som 3 Interest
ing Speeches.
Redmond Says the Appointment
of a New Commission Is
an Evasion.
Finally a Motion Is Made to Reduce
Premier Salisbury's Salary, but
It Is Def.ated.
LONDON, Eng., March 29.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day Hon. Edward â  Blake,
Nationalist member for the South Division
of Longford, opened the debate on the
financial relations between Ireland and
Great Britain by introducing a motion for
the relief of the taxpayers of Ireland, con
tending tbat the contribution of Ireland
to the treasury of Great Britain was un
justly disproportionate.
Mr. Blake added that the report of the
committee on the financial relations be
tween Great Britain and Ireland bad
proved that the latter country was unduly
taxed. It was the duty of the Govern
ment to take early steps for the adoption
of remedial legislation. '
Mr. Redmond (Parnellite) seconded Mr.
Blake's motion. He said that the ap
pointment of the new commission was a
dishonest evasion and was intended to
shelve the question for an indefinite time,
but it would result in a hastening of the
day when Ireland would find in her Na
tional Government the best safeguard
against further spoliation.
Thomas P. Whitaker (Liberal) moved
that while the exchequers of Great
Britain and Ireland are made consoli
dated all portions of the United King
dom must be regarded as one country for
fiscal purposes. This motion was sec
onded by Thomas Waring, member for
the north division of County Downs, who
is classed as a "constitutionalist and im
perialist."
j Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Chancellor of
the Exchequer, in behalf of the Govern
ment, said that the opposition ascribed
everything wrong in Ireland for the past
century to Great' Britain. In 1817 the
Irish and English debts bad been consoli
dated and the exchequers of both coun
tries amalgamated. The act had been
passed by Parliament 'by a unanimous
vote, because it was felt that it would be
a great relief to Ireland. He denied the
stories of the poverty and misery that
was said to prevail in Ireland.
Continuing, Sir Michael declared that a
system of taxation based upon taxable
capacity was never successful owing to
constantly varying conditions in all parts
of the kingdom. f__ji^|j
Sir Michael farther said tbat if the Gov
ernment restored to Ireland the Â£2,570,000
she claimed was the excess of taxation
she bad paid she would contribute noth
ing to the common expenditure of the
United Kingdom, but would receive trib
ute from England and Scotland. There
would be a further inquiry into the matter
of the financial relations between Great
Britain and Ireland, the Government de
siring to do full justice, but it would in no
wise depart from the system established
in 1817. Tne debate was then adjourned.
The House subsequently went into com
mittee of supply, whereupon the Hon.
Philip Stanhope, Radical member for Bui
nev, moved to reduce the salary of Prime
Minister Salisbury, his object being to
call attention to Crete. A warm debate
ensued.
The Right Hon. George N. Curzon, Par
liamentary Secretary of the Foreign Office,
warmly repelled the charge made by Mr.
Stanhope that the Government was siding
with Turkey. The charge, he declared,
was grossly untrue. Crete, he added, had
been taken from Turtey, whose troops
were confined to the towns on the coast
and sbe had been prevented from sending
re-enforcements to the islands.
At this point one of the Irish members
shouted 'Tommy Rot." The Speaker
warned him that he must not repeat that
expression. Mr. Curzon was frequently
interrupted in the course of his speech,
chiefly by members of the Irish benches.
Sir Charles Dilke, Radical member for
tbe Forest of Dean division, said. he be
lieved that the Government's policy in the
Cretan matter had caused profound dis
satisfaction in Great Britain.
Sir Ellis Ashmead Bartlett, Conserva
tive, who was recently decorated by the
Sultan, taunted John Dillon, leader of the
anti-Parnellites, who had spoken against
tbe course of the Government, with advo
cating the maiming of cattle and at the
same time posing as a Christian philan
thropist.
A vote was taken on Mr. ; Stanhope's
motion and it was rejected, 163 to 60.

by the State.
TACOMA, Wash., March 29.â The re

Pacific Bank case, finding four acres of
city lands escheated to the county, bas

CORN FOR THE STARVING
A Ship Laden With Food Will
Sail for India Within
Six Weeks.
Large Supplies on the Way From
the Eastâ A Third cf a Cargo
Now In Sight
The local Indian famine relief com
mittee has taken new life and from all
accounts a ship laden with corn and pro
visions will sail from this port for India
within six weeks. Several weeks ago the
committee decided that in the relief prop
osition they bad bitten off more than they
could masticate and' that the project of
sending food to the starving inhabitants
of Queen Victoria's Eastern possessions
would have to be abandoned. The prin
cipal obstacle was the excessive cost of"
getting Western corn to the railroads and
then to the sea. So the committee called
a halt and decided to send the $800 already
subscribed to the relief headquarters in
London. ,
Within the past week the movement has
received fresh life. Secretary R. P. Perry
ha** been informed that the people have
contributed .8..00 to the fund. In lowa
they have forwarded fifty carloads of corn

WATER RUSHING
OVER THE LEVEES
Now the Great Mississippi
Flood Has Reached
New Orleans.
Alarming Reports of the River's
Rise Come From Many
Sections.
Thousands of Acres of Fertile Fields
in a Fertile Valley Will
Be Submerged. >
NEW ORLEANS, La., March 29.â The
river finally . reached the top of the levee
this morning and began running over into
Mandeville street, directly in front of the
celebrated French market building. It is
not believed '. that < any material damage
will occur to property.
The people in the city are not greatly
alarmed because .the levee at that point is
a very strong one and there is no fear that
it will break, no matter how much water
flows ovarii.
That portion of ' the river ; where the
water is flowing over is the ; nearest point
between the river and Lake Pontchartrain.
The water coming over the . levee can be
easily carried back into the lake. There
are several streets which would carry it to
the lake at once. Canal street and the
main portion of the city is above where
the overflow has occurred, so that very lit
tle damage can be done unless the- water
flows over the levee in the upper part of
the city. .
The only news ' disturbing the citizens
is the fact that freshets and rising rivers
are reported from the States above Louis
iana. . J
News has come that the Minnesota
rivers are rising rapidly. The Mississippi
at St. Paul has passed . the ten-foot mark
and is getting higher.: /JJ'JrJ/:
Higher water Is reported at Little Falls,
St. Cloud and Grand Rapids.
At Quincy, In., the river is fifteen feet
above the low-water mark.
Every effort will be made by the city
authorities of New Orleans to strengthen
the levee. From past -â¢ experience they
know that the very high water only lasts
a few weeks and after that all danger is
past. Usually when the river is booming
the levees above break and that relieves
the pressure here. -li very often happens
that the levee on the Algiers side caves in
and generally saves the city.
MEMPHIS, Texn., March 29â
weather is cloudy to-day. Another down
pour of rain is soon expected. The levees
along the lower Mississippi are in serious
danger of giving way, but up to noon they
are intact.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 29.â The river
is rising steadily and is now within four
feet of the danger line. Reports received
from the upper river points state that a
flood is on its way j down and may be ex
pected here within forty-eight hours. It
is raining this afternoon and the rain is
general - throughout Missouri, Arkansas
and Western Tennessee. J t - .-17
ST. BERNARD KENNELS BARRED.
Stockton Kennel Club Forbidden to Receive
Their Entries for the Coming
Bench Show.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 29.â At its
meeting to-night the Stockton Kennel
Ciub discussed the action of the advisory
committee of the American Kennel Club
in asking for the suspension of the St.
Bernard kennels and of the National or
ganization in following the committee's
suggestions. President W. M. ; Gibson
said on behalf of the Stockton Kennel
Club that it did no; de-ire to take any part
in the fight between the San Francisco
Kennel Club and tbe Olympic Gun Club.
The desire of the local organization was to
see the differences between the clubs
amicably settled; but it would not take
any part in the controversy, desiring to
retain the friendship of both.* -.7;;.
Notice has been received by the bench
show committee here forbidding it to
accept any entries from the' St. Bernard
kennel**, or to offer any prizes donated by
that duo or its officers.
From word received here to-day by J.
E. Doak, one of tbe leading men in the
local kennel club, it would seem that the
differences between the warring dog fanci
ers in San Francjsco were ill a fair way to
be settled. J/,
Entries are coming in very rapidly for
the show that is to-be held here next
month, and from the 'present outlook
twice as many dogs will be benched as
were here on exhibition* last September.
One of the features of the show will be an
exhibition by the great bloodhound be
longing to John Quiggle Jof Gait, which
will show how tracking by dogs is done.
There are many ' other special features
that have been arranged,* but the - dogs
themse will be well worth the trouble
of those who bave promised to come con
siderable distances to see them. -
VIEWS OP A DOG-EAMCIER.
Says the San Francisco Kennel Club Is
in the Right.
SAN JOSE, Cal.'. March Charles H.
Harker, secretary and treasurer of the
Santa Clara Valley Poultry ,:â  and Kennel
Club, in speaking of the fight between the
San Francisco -Kennel Club and the
Olympic Gun Club said this evening*:
'â . "The San - Francisco v Kennel Club is
right. It is justified in the action which
it has taken. The Olympic Gun Club is
just what its. name implies â a gun club
and not a kennel club. I have received
notification from the American Kennel
Club ; that the :, St _ Bernard 3 Club 'of ' San
Francisco has been disqualified. Prior to
this we had received entries for our dog
show, from the St. Bernard Club and from
members of ';' the Olympic I Gun oClnb.
These entries still. stand, as the local club
is taking no chances of a suit for dam

UTICA MINE DISASTER.
Pcwder and Drilling House Wrecked by an
Explosion â Engineer Fred C/ough's
Bravery.
ANGELS CAMP, Cal., March 29.â A
powder and drilling house at the Utica
mine was blown up this morning, causing
consternation among residents, for it was
thought that the explosion had occurred
in the mine. The building was small and
only a few feet from the engine-house at
the Stickle shaft. It was used as a drying
place for miners' clothes and as a store
bouse for giant powder at times. Only
one box of 100 cartridges was in the house.
The woodwork caught fire from a small
stove in the room and set off the powder.
Engineer Fred Clough stood at bis post,
although he knew the powder wan in the
place. At the time he saw the fire he was
hoisting a car, and to desert his post
would mean the crushing of the miners
below. The windows of the engine-house
were all blown out and some other dam
age done.

Last evening when Chivelo Michelo,

COLUSA, Cal., March 9.â Sheriff Jones
returned irom Ashland, Or., to-day, hav
ing in charge the two men who entered
the Mountain House Hotel, about twenty
two miles west of Colusa, on the evening
of Marcb 3, and at the point of their re
volvers compelled the occupants to part
with their cash. They obtained about
$30, and after exchanging shots with the
proprietor of the place rode on a few miles
to the ranch of H. S. McMichel, where
they left ono of their horses, which was
almost exhausted, and stole a fresh one.
Sheriff Jones was notified and imme
diately started in pursuit. He tracked
them through -Bartlett Springs away up
into Lake County, where they doubled on
their track and came back through Bart
lett.. They stopped there to purchase a
pair of shoes and were recognized, but no
attempt was made to capture them. They
returned over the trail they had made in
escaping, and were again recognized by
the occupants of the Mountain House;
who locked their doors and turned out
their light, half expecting to be held up.
Their trail was owed north to Sisson,
where they shipped some articles by ex
press to Ashland, Or. Their description
was telegraphed ahead, and 1 they were
arrested by the Ashland officers about
five miles from town, where tbey had ob
tained work on a ranch.
The prisoners are young men, and both
are supposed to 'be ex-convicts who were
released from Foisom orison about the
middle of last month. One of , them, Wil
liam Roberts, about 19 years of age, was
sent irom San Francisco to serve two
years for robbery, and the other, James
Hanner, was sentenced from Tehama
County for horse-stealing. Hanner now
claims to be John Buchanan, and says he
lived for several years at Arbuckle and
has a brother working for Superintendent
George Nortney of the Sulphur- Creek
mines..
Both disclaim any knowledge of the
robbery, and say the officers have made a
mistake. Nevertheless they have been
fully identified as the right persons.

Japanese Shipping in Books Falsely
Stamped as Copyrighted in the

TACOMA. Wash.. March 29.â The wily
Japanese, who have been copying so many
articles of American manufacture, have
commenced shipping in pictures, books and
other articles falsely, stamped as copy
righted or patented in. the United States.
Now this is to be stopped by Uncle Sam,
for local customs officials to-day received
a Treasury Department circular calling
their attention to the act of Congress ap
proved on March. 3, prohibiting such im
.-nations and sales, which are made to
save the trouble and expense of obtain
ing copyrights. At present there are no
laws in Japan governing trademarks and
copyrights. ;;â '.* ,
Recently a circular was sent from Wash
ington warning patentees of the danger
of allowing their machines and attach
ments to be sent to Japan until such in
ternational laws had been adopted as
would effectually prevent the hand me
chanics of the Orient from duplicating
articles with impunity. The new law pro
vide-* that no book, map, c art, musical
or dramatic composition, print-cut, en
graving or photo which shall have unlaw*
ml notice of copyright attached, shall
be admitted, and that any one who shall
knowingly sell such work shall be liable
to a fine of $100, one-half going to the in
formant and one-half to the Government.
The Federal Circuit Courts are empow
erod to enjoin sale of such articles.

ASYLUM RECORDS ALTERED.
Commitment Under Which . Stuart B.

fore Judge Kittredge this morning. In
trying to expedite matters Judge Kit

was not represented by an attorney. This
was objected to by Attorney Gallardo, on
the ground that a Judge was disqualified
from acting ss attorney, and a motion to
have the hearing transferred to another
department was granted. The case will
be heard before Judge Lorigan Wednes
day morning.
Dr. Hatch says that within a short time

written in the committing clause, making
it read that the patient "is not insane."
The doctor says the commitment did
not so appear in January, 1892, when it
was brought with the patient to the asy
lum, and a copy supplied a few weeks ago
by the Los Angeles County Cleric does not
show tbe negative.
Strong is 50 years old. He is auiet ex
cept when angered, and is allowed much
freedom. The asylum officials are willing
that some one should take him out, but
do not think it safe to discharge him, as |
the inmate threatens to kill bis brother, j
C. H. Strong, who resides in Los Angeles, j
attributing bis confinement to. the latter.
Gallardo claims that Strong is the vie- j

Waif. 'ir' â¢
LOS ANGELES. Cal., March 29.â A pa
thetic scene was witnessed in the Superior
; Court room here this forenoon. By the de
-1 cision of the court one woman lost a little
! boy whom she had learned to love, an dan
| other woman gained possession of the lad
j and carried it off in triumph. But this
! was not done without a struggle on tbe
; part of the child, who, as he was carried
; away, cried pitcously to get back to the
people with whom he had been living.
The incident was the culmination of the
'-- adoption proceedings in the case of little
Malcolm Smith, which have occupied so
. much time in Judge Smith's court for the
j past week or ten days. Briefly the story
jis this: He was born more than twq
years ago at the hospital of Mrs. Smith
on Bellevue* avenue. The mother, un- I
j married, upon .her recovery left the cbild j
with Mrs. Smith and departed for San
! Diego. Mrs. Smith gave tbe baby to a
! Mrs. Judd to care for. In the course of |
time the daughter of Mrs. Judd, Mrs. j
J Dobbins, became attached to the child, |
and a short time ago. when Mrs. Smith
wanted little Malcolm, she was refused
possession.
â¢So the affair got into court. After a
spirited contest, the court signed papers
of adoption and ordering the. child. into
the possession of Mrs. Smith.

Orchardists Warned of Impending
Danger to the Product of
*Â» Their Trees.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 29.â A
high wind, accompanied by an exceed
ingly low temperature, prevailed tri rough
out Southern California for sixteen hours
up to 5 o'clock this afternoon. The wind
began easing off at that time, but the
temperature has been going down all day
until the frost line has been almost
reached. Grave apprehension exists to
night for the safety of one of the most
promising fruit crops ever known in the
history of Southern California. â¢ -
The damage from the wind in this city
has been alight, but other localities in this
part of the State have been less fortunate.
Great injury has, it is feared, been wrought
by the wind in the open country lying to
the west ayd south of tbis city. Santa
Monica and San Pedro report the strong
est gale known in many years, and it is
known tbat several orchards of deciduous
fruit trees have been seriously damaged
between these places. The Santa Ana
and Riverside valleys have also suffered
greatly from the almost unparalleled wind
storm. -
Tha wind, to the surprise of everybody,
has held steadily from one direction â the
northwest. The forecast by the local
weather bureau warns people in the
southern section of the State that killing
frosts are expected to-night." Fruit-grow
ers are advised to take precautions against
the damage that will likely occur in ex
posed sections by burning smudges in
their orchards.
In the business portion of the city the
wind played merry pranks with all kinds
of signs. Those _ not securely fastened
were hurled about, end in some instances
did some damage in their flight In a few
instances window glasses were shattered
by flying boards and dislodged awnings.
In the residence portion of town the trees
felt the strain, and in many cases they
were uprooted or their branches broken
off. In the more exposed partsâ on the
hilly section, for instance the less sub
stantial homes were caused to sway, to the
alarm of many inmates.

Sense Damage Done 'to Buildings and
Orchards in the taunt*/.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 29.â A
storm of unusual severity visited Sonoma
County Saturday night and Sunday wind
ing up this morning with a nipping frost.
The principal damage was caused by a
high wind which unrooted several houses
and otherwise damaged property. The
streams near tbis city rose rapidly and
reached the hign- water matte of the season
within turae hours. Reports from the ad
jacent towns show the storm to have been
general throughout the county with the
damage confined to a few uprooted trees
and tbe demolishing of one or two frail
buildings. . The frost of this ,' morning
while quite severe is not supposed to bave
inflicted any great damage to the fruit
crop. 7' " 'â /' 7 ' ' '"â â¢ 'â¢' 'â  "

ANDERSON, Cal., March 29.â heavy
frost prevailed in this section last night,
sending the v mercury down to 25 degrees
above zero. 'It has resulted in killing the
almond, apricot and plum crop. * Peaches,
so far as , can be . learned, are not so seri

RRANDY SEIZED AT FRESNO.
According io the Revenue Laws, Spirits
.May Not Be Manufactured
From Figs.
FRESNO, Cal., March 29.â Deputy In
ternal Revenue Collector Al Griffin to-day
seized six barrel** of brandy at the dis
tillery which A. F. Ten ney conducts in
conjunction with his fruit cannery in this
city. Mr. Tenney manufactures brandy
out of the refuse from the canning estab
lishment. It appears that the Federal
authorities learned that he had made
some alcohol from * damaged â ' figs. This
fru't is not specified as one from which
spirits can be manufactured, and for this
reason the six barrels were seized to-day.
Mr. Charles de Toy, a local representa
tive of Mr. Tenney, could not be found to
night by a Call correspondent, but it is
understood that ignorance of the law was
the cause of its violation. The brandy is
manufactured from all kinds of refuse
fruits, and the damaged figs went in with
the rest. Mr. Tenney did not know he
was. guilty of an , infraction of the law.
There does not seem to be any particular
reason why figs should not be used in the
manufacture of the liquor.
UKIAH ASSASSIN'S FATE.
Gregorio JS.'revara Sentenced to Life Im-
prison men t for the Murder ot
Rancher Henderson..
UKIAH, Cal., March 29.â The closing
scene in a trial for one of the most
dastardly murders ever committed in this
county was enacted to-day wben Judge
Murderer Gregorio Berevara*
J. M. Mannon sentenced Grecorio Bere
vara to the State prison at Foisoni, there
to remain for the term of his natural life.
Berevara, on February 3, with a butcher
knife stabbed and killed Benjamin Hen
derson, a wealthy rancher of this county,
at the latter's ranch three miles northeast
of Ukiah. Henderson was a man highly
esteemed and threats of lynching were
freely expressed when Berevara was first
arrested. During the trial the prisoner
was moody and sullen and. when placed
en the stand in his own behalf refused to
make .reply to questions directed to him
by his counsel. At one time he created
considerable excitement in court by risine
from th- witness chair and advancing
toward the bar in a -threatening manner.
The jury on. the first ballot found him
guilty of murder in tne first. degree and
fixed the punishment at life imprisonment,
Berevara is a native of Chile., about 40
years of age, and is not a very attractive
specimen of his race.: He is stoop shoul
dered and less than 5 feet in height.
SAN DIEGO-YUMA RAILWAY.
Mayor Carlson Asks for Franchises on
Behalf of the Southern Pacific
Company, .
SAN: DIEGO,- Cal., March 29.â Mayor
Carlson addressed a meeting of citizens at
the San Diego Theater to-night in advo
cacy of the proposition for a direct rail
road line East to Yuma, to connect with
the Southern Pacific "there.:. The Mayor
had a diagram on the stage showing the
distance from San Diego to Yuma via Los
Angeles to be 375 miles, while a direct line
would cut the distance to 175 miles, open
up a vast new territory, give San Diego a
competing line and turn, a great portion
of tho Eastern tourist tram*: direct, into
San. Diego before it reached any other
part of Southern California. 7 Speaking for
President Huntington, Mayor Car. son said
it would cost $4,000,000 to build the road
to "Yuma,*: and -would â  occupy "two and a
half years, including r the time necessary
to clear up the terminal franchises. jr **
â  "If the Council will grant the franchises
on the water front ana the people raise a
guarantee of 4 per cent for tbree' years on
the capitalization 1 * of $480,000, the road
Will be begun immediately," he said.
Another meeting will ue held to-mor

ARREST OP A RIVER PIRATE.
Accused of 'Robbing Bouses and Vessels
Along the Sacramento. .., .
SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 29.â
Deputy Sheriffs Fisher and Hinters to
day arrested Frank Kelly, well known in
police circles in this city, and lodged him
in the County Jail on suspicion of being a
pirate. -'
Kelly has been living in a houseboat on
the river for several months, since his re
lease from the County Jail, where he had
been held on suspicion of burglary. 7
Of late the depredations along the river
have become alarming. Houses were pil
laged and steamers robbed, and it is; now
claimed that the stolen goods have been
traced to the houseboat. It is probable
that Kellv and bis partner, an ex-convict
named Wagner, may become gues ta of
the State for an extended period.
THOUGHT TO BE A THIEF.
William Weed Arrested in His Boom in
the Palace Hotel.
William Weed, a young man about 28
years of age, suave-mannered ana well
dressed, wbo arrived in this City from
Alaska on the 22d. inst., was taken from
bis comfortable room in the Palace Hotel
by Detectives Bee and Harper last evening,
and was detained in the tanks of the City
Prison on suspicion of being a petty lar
ceny thief.
The young man was not charged with
having committed any crime, bnt the de
tectives believe him guilty of having
entered several rooms in the Palace Hotel,
and will endeavor to build up a case
against him.
Several days ago a young woman, whose
room is in close proximity to the prison
er's, missed a gold thimble and a breast
pin of small value. She noticed that the
room had been disturbed by some unin
vited guest and reported the case to the
police.
Detectives Bee and Harper were do
tailed on the case and after a search of the
pawnshops located the missing jewelry.
The detectives secured a description of the
party who pawned the articles from the
pawnshop-keeper, and as Weed faithfully
answered the description suspicion was
fastened on him.
He was not arrested immediately, but a
close watch was kept on him. Last
evening the detectives arrived at the con
clusion that they were in possession of
sufficient evidence to warrant the young
man's arrest and ho was taken into cus
tody. _______________________________________________
DEATH FROM PAREGORIC.
An Overdose of the Drug Acci
dentally Administered to
Irving Tevis.
The Chili Was but Tnree Days Old
and Antidotes Proved With
cut Av-il.
Irving Tevis, but 3 days old, the son of
George â  Tevis. steward of the Brooklyn
Hotel, died last evening in the home of
bis parents, BC4 Larkin street, from the
effects of an overdose of paregoric, acci
dentally administered by the child's
nurse.
The little child came into the world
Saturday morning and was bright and
healthy. It remained so until yesterday
morning, when it was apparently sei,:.-d
with colic, or some similar complaint.
The nurse was asked to administer a lit
tle paregoric, but unfortunately she un
derestimated the strength of the drug and
gave the child an overdose.
It shortly became semi-conscious, and
its mother, fearing that her baby had
been poisoned, sent for Dr. A. Brune.
The physician diagnosed the case as one
of paregoric poisoning and gave antidotes,
but without effect, and at 6 o'clock the
little baby collapsed and died.
Although heartbroken over her loss,
Mrs. Tevis blames no one for the death of
her baby, as she knows that it was due
solely to an accident.

exists it.will have little value to the Val
ley road, except as to/its right of way,
and this is so tortuous and of so undesir
able a grade in places that it will have to
be in large part changed should it come
into the possession of the Soutnern Pa
cific's great competitor. Rails: and; ties
will have to -come up and _be replaced,
and even the mile of per built into the
bay at Emeryville will have to be re
placed with a new structure, extending at
least three miles from shore to secure a
Buflicient depth of water for- ferry steam
ers. This alone, it is estimated, would in
volve an expenditure of three-quarters of
a million dollars.
As the bay terminus of the California
and Nevada at Emeryville is just on the
northern boundary of the charter line of
Oakland, provision in the shape of street
car lines would have to be made for tbe
distribution of passengers on the, other
side of the bay. At present the only
streetcar line that reaches Emeryville is
the San Pablo avenue cars.
Emeryville, Berkeley and all the country
thereabouts would undoubtedly be greatly
benefited should the Valley.. road be in
duced to operate a ferry line from Emery
ville to San Francisco, It is understood
that should the new road engage in the
undertaking there would be nothing half
way about, the enterpriseâ the service
would be first-class in every particular.;
It ; is reported " that the Oakland com
mittee which has been appointed to treat
with the Valley road is already 'at work
seeking to secure possession of the '.Cali
fornia and â "- Nevada Railroad, with <7 tbo (
avowed purpose of turning it over to the
Valley road.
Point Richmond will be utilized as the
shipping point for wheat and freicht gen
erally, while Emeryville will be the great
passenger entrepot of the road.
ANXIOUS TO SELL.
California and Nevada Railroad
Owners Want the Valley Road .
to Have It.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â The peri
odical story regarding the purchase of the i
California and Nevada Railroad by the
Valley road is now going around. A |
thorough investigation of the facts, how
ever, shows that although the California |
and Nevada Railroad Company would
like to sell or do anything that would j
take tbe line off its hands, the Valley road j
has not as yet made any arrange or |
even entered into any negotiations that J
might end in purchasing the little narrow
gauge route.
The situation to-day is this: The con- I
troversy between F. M. Smith, J. S. J
Emeiy and C. H. Smith has been tempo- |
rarily adjusted. By the arrangement |
made F. M. Smith and Emery have
yielded to Charles H. Smith of Denver the
power to dispose of the road,
F. M. Smith anil Emery want to have
the road turned over to the Realty Syndi
cate, which bas for two years past been
bonding all the property contiguous to
the road at Emeryville. Charles Smith,
who has a large interest in the road, is
opposed to its oeing absorbed by the syn
dicate, and consequently they nave tem
porarily turned it over to him for the pur
pose ol letting him try -'ami sell it. In
the event of his not being able to do so
he will probably let it go to the syn
dicate.
In the face of all the circumstances it is
not at all unlikely that ' the -Valley road;
if it shall come to Oakland, will ' be pre
sented with the franchise of. tha little
narrow-gauge road. Sucn an event is not
at all improbable, for the presence of the
road would give to the thousands of acres
bonded by the syndicate a value such as
they will never have until a through road
is built - ' ' /' -'
F. M. Smith, the president of the syndi
cate, was seen at bis . home in East Oak
land to-day and said that he was not in a
position to talk about the matter, but re
ferred to Frank C. Havens, the manager
for the borax dealer.
Mr. Havens slated that the Valley road
: will naturally want to come to Oakland,
and that the. syndicate wanted it to come
over the California and Nevada tracks.
"Wehave succeeded in getting this prop
erty," said Mr. Havens; "because we
needed it. A few days ago we acquired J."
S. Emery's land at Emeryville and we
need a railroad to make thai land valua
ble, ana we want that road operated.
Things are now in such shape that I. do
not see now the Valley road-can come
into Oakland any other wav, and we in
tend to* do everything in our power* to
make it to the advantage of that road to
come over our line."
Robert Watt, vice-president of the Val
ley road, who lives iv this City, is author
ity for the statement that no ; arrange
ments have yet been made with the Cali
fornia and Nevada road. ."We have not
arranged for ary ferry system," said Vice-
President Wait, "nor for the purchase of
the little road. We need first an en
trance into San Francisco for freight, and
then we will turn our attention to Oak
land passengers." _
For over two years the Realty Syndicate
consist of F. M. Smith, W. J. Dingee,
F. C. Havens. E. A. Heron and others has
been quietly bonding* every available lot
of land along the route of the little nar
row-gauge ; road. .. For , a long time it has
been no secret : that they were doing , this
for the purpose of trying to. sell thÂ» road
to some other company, and at different

times it has been published that the road
had been bonded by nearly every com
pany, that comes , within ay thousand
miles of California. %.7
Of course, now that the Valley road has
decided to come to Point Richmond, ad
ditional interest is given to the little road
that comes down from a point not far from
Point Richmond right - into Oakland; and
connects with the pier built three .years
ago by F. M. Smith at Emeryville, and
which has never yet been used except ,by
promenaders and fishermen. ,*' .'.'â¢' â¢*â '. '-â¢_*.f
The understanding between the Smith's
is not very recent, having * ; been made
some time ago, out since the nefinite loca
tion of the Valley Railroad Company's
freight terminus at Point Kicnmond, at
tention has naturally been turned toward
the two streaks of rust that for a Ion*;
time have marked the route of the Cali
; fornia nnu Nevada. _
As the road is in such a condition that
it would be an absolute impossibility for
the Valley road to run a single car over it
until it was entirely rebuilt, it is not con
sidered probable by those who know most
about such undertakings that the Valley
road would give a single dollar for the
franchise. MJBfiffe*^"- â 
There is at present pending a confer
ence between prominent men of Oakland
ana President Spreckels of the Valley
road, at wnich the advent of that road in
to Oakland is to be discussed. It is con
sidered absolutely certain that the Valley
road will demand at least a free right of
way should it come to this city. It is now
in a better position to demand this than
ever, for the California and Nevada road
cannot be of service to any other road but
the Valley road, and as the syndicate has
declared its anxiety tnat the Valley road
shall come through its property, it is not
likely that tney will want to see. the ap
preciation of value of that property de
layed any longer tban is absolutely neces-
sary.
Taking all these circumstances into con
sideration, it is seen that tho Valley road'
bas not yet taken any action in the mat
ter; that the owners of the California and
Nevada and the Realty Syndicate are very
anxious, for the Valley people to come
intoOikland, and that it is hardly likely
that the Valley Railroad, knowing the
value that is set upon its coming to this
city, will feel inclined to purchase any
right of way, especially as the most promi
nent merchants ami officials of Oakland
have already c- expressed their desire to
make a substantial offer should the road
see fit to extend its lines from Point Rich
mond into this city.

An Important Decision Relative to the

The Supreme Court has rendered a de
cision of no little importance relative to
tbe power of the Board of Dental Exam
iners of the Stat** of California. .
* John D. Van Vleck holds a diploma of
graduation from the American College of
Dental; Surgery of ' Chicago, issued on
April 2,1894. A month later he came to
San Francisco and presenting bis diploma
to the State boaru asked for a certificate
and license to practice the profession of
ais choice. The board refused to do so
and Van Vleck applied rto the \ Superior
Court lor a writ of mandate to comnel the
Stale board to do as requested. In the
Superior Court Van Vlecic was successful
and the board demurred, which demurrer
was overruled. .-â *â¢â¢'â ;* -.' -Jr
From this judgment the -State-board
I appealed to the - Supreme Court. -This

Otis Skinner Presents . a
Play of Charles IPs
Time.
"For Fair Virginia" Makes a
r Favorable Impression at v
the Columbia-
Pretty Ballets at the Tivoli in "Den.
Juan, ad Lib"â N:w Elood at
the Acezar Theater.
Love-making and the selfish intrigues
of Charles Il's; court are the themes of
"His Grace de Grammont,"; the romantic
comedy by Clyde Fitch, with which Otis
Skinner opened bis engagement at the
Baldwin Theater last night. The linked
sweetness, long drawn out, of the love
making and counter love-making is
scarcely a strong. enough motive to fill
four acts. But there are some telling sit
uations in "His Grace de Grammont,"
and the picturesque costumes and settings
of the restoration > period, which were
faithfully reproduced in every detail,
made the play a series of charming pic
tures. .7- '-_Â*_..'".'
"The Merrie Monarch," as chroniclers
who condone Charles Il's high-rolling pro
clivities love'to style him, is presented in
anything but an enviable light in "His
Grace de Grammont.'' â  Clyde Fitch has
not minced the slate of morals, or rather
the utter absence of morals, which pre
vailed at his court, and the "goings on"
of the wittiest and Wickedest of the Stuart
kings are enough to make any American
thank the Lord that royalty. has never had
a chance to disport itself in the land of
the free. In fact, the glimpses of restora
tion morals are calculated to jar th" sensi
bilities of the descendants of the Pilgrim
Fathers.
The plot of the play centers ronnd the
attempt of the fickje Charles to win the ;
affections of fair Mistress Hamilton, who
in the hrst act falls in love with the Count
de Gratnmoht, an exile from Louis XlVs
court. Grammont from all accounts lias*
been as great a high-roller as the Merrie
Monarch before he fell under the spell of
Hamilton's charms, but true love makes'
him reform, and thenceforth he discards
his former flirtations and soars above
court intrigue.
Two ladies with whose affections Gram- .
Mont has dallied are not so easily shaken
off, however, and they manage to put
several spokes in. tht* Chevalier's wheel.
Twice is Grummont'goaded by his enemies
into speaking about Charles before his
face in a way which almost made the
Merrie Monarch cry "off with his head."
The last time tbe Chevalier was already
on his way to the Tower for high treason,
with a prospect of decapitation to follow,
but in the end. Charles was induced to be
generous and not only pardon the cheva
lier but bless his banns wiih Mistress
Hamilton. -
Otis Skinner was excellent in all the
phases of tbe Chevalier's role, both as the
impassioned lover and the indignant sub
ject. His picturesque restoration . cos
tume suited him well, and there was
no thing 1 bat one couid have, wished al
tered, except to hare wished him more
voice for his song. v... ;â  7 â '*'-â 
. It is impossible to sneak in too high
praise of Maud Durbio's Mistress Hamil
ton. Her appearance was extremely pic
turesque and youthful and Bhe acted with
a winsomeness' and girlish abandon that
won her the house. ' - ' Â
Frederick Mosiey's make-up as. Charles
11 was strictly on historical lines. Any
one familiar with pictures of the Merrie |
Monarch could not fail to be struck with
the faith lul reproduction of the King. j
Mosley acted bis part almost as well a*
he looked it. ' Rose Shuman and Eda
Aberle were satisfactory as the two . ex
flames of Grammont, though* he showed
questionable taste in admiring two ladies
wbo looked like caricatures of the "new
woman." Sarah Trua" acted well,' and
looked 1 picturesque as Lady Csstlemain,
and the rest of the cast was satislactory.
At the Columbia.
Itls a touching picture of the home life
during the Civil War that Russ Whytal has
portrayed in his charming urama "For Fair
Virginia." -77 {JJ..
Bronson Howard .and Gillette went to the
front for the stirring scenes in their war
dramas. Whytal. with keen insight, stirs bis
audiences with the strength and loyalty of tha
women who Suffered and prayed; counting the
heartbeats to the muffled accompaniment of
the cannon's roar.
There is, nothing startling, nothing abso
lutely new in this war drama. It is simply a
charming story of love ana devotion charm
ingly told.- Each succeding act strengthens
the slowly u:itol<ling plot, and the last act
finds the plucky Yankee in the arms of a van
quished but happy "Johnny" and the South
ern heroine safe in the shelter of her loving
husband's arms. The villain, ofÂ» course, is
properly vanquished, as he should be in any
st-lf-respecting piny. A number. of delicious
love scenes run through the drama, and the
cigarette-rolling episode is. at once deligntiul
and novel. . â¢ ..-.'. , ;:â . v. .

Grand Opera-House.
"The Dago," which received its first San
Francisco performance at the Grand last night,
is an effective melodrama which contains a
number of sensational scenes, particularly the
fire scene, where' Baby Lewis, the persecuted
heiress, is the means of rescuing her. father
from the flames.
John F. -tenon, the villain of the stock com
pany, has a congenial role as the "Dago," who
for the sake 01 filthy lucre steals an infant
heiress. Mortimer Snow is quite at home as
Gerald Morton, tne banker, and Leslie Morosco
livens up matters as Huppy Days, the bar
keeper. *â  â¢â â â â¢â¢â¢â¢â 
Among the other members of the long- cast
who ingratiated themselves with the public
Were Harry Lewelly ii, an Irishman, with_songs

Irma Fitch repeated her success of last

excellent as the infant heiress, and tbe other
parts were satisfactorily filled.
At the Alcazar.
Augustus Thomas' â â  four-act comedy, "New
Blood," was presented at the Alcazar last
night with the full strength of the stock com
pany. As usual the play was well mounted,
and the costumes worn by the ladles were well
worthy of mention.

Camilla Urso Concert. ~; 7
A very good audience greeted the celebrated
violiniste, Camilla Urso, and her concert com
pany at Golden Gate Hall last night. The ap
pearance of Mme. Urso was greeted with
i many rounds of applause and she was.pre
sented with a number of floral tributes.
Mme.-- Urso' .opening number was Ernest
Guiraud's "Grand Caprice de Concert," and
long before she. had completed the "allegro
apras-dnato" it was evident that she hand
led her instrument in as masterly a way as
ever. | She executed the most difficult passages
with consummate ease and spirit, and charmed
her bearers into ei;tnusiastic_Â«pplause_;and a
determined demand for an encore. Â±i
Mme. Urso's other solos were a "Reverie" by
Vieuxtemps and Bag-mini's "Witches' Dance."
The latter, which bristles with technical diffi
culties, was magnificently played.
G. H. -Wesley, the piauist, opened the pro
gramme by artistically playing Liszt's
"Twelith Hungarian Rhapsodic*." He also
gave a brilliant rendering of a Chopin "Bal
lade." ,
Edwin H. Douglas, the tenor, appeared to be
suffering from hoarsenees, and in conse
quence his voice was rather lorced in the dif
ficult aria from "Der Freischuetz." Miss Min
nie Metho:, tbe so* ratio, showed herself to be
the possessor of a clear and rather bard voice,
though some of her : upper tones were very
sweet. She is an accomplished singer, in the
French style, but her voice is not marred by
the tremolo that so often disfigures; singers
"made in France." : Miss Me: hot's and Mr.
Douglas' voices sounded to excellent advan
tage in Faure's duet,. "Charity."

A large audience was at tne Oberon last

About all the powers can do in the Le
vant is to blockade the schemes of one an
other.
If it were not for the valor and vigor of
King George the Cretan crisis would be
one of the best plots for a comic opera on
record.
It can . now be understood why Glad
stone continues to be one of the foremost
men of his time. He has learned to ride
the bike.
The rival kennel clubs may go to the
dogs, but not to the bow-wows. There is a
prospect ahead for peace and a chance for
a good show.
As soon as the present boulevard pro
ject is completed there will be ano'.ner to
extend it. San Jose has taken notice of it
' and is already reaching for it.
One of the items of news which creates
no surprise is the announcement that the
action of the Greeks bas disgusted the
stockbrokers in every capital in Europe.
The statement that the Kaiser's policy
in regard to Greece is not actuated by any
hostility to the Greeks seems to imply
tbat it is the outcome of pure cussedness.
California farmers are taking a renewed
interest in beet-sugar culture and are right
in doing so. There is a big thing in it and
we must not let the East get ahead of us.
All the country that has any stock or
share-in the Mississippi River is going to
be in a condition of free liquidation tbis
spring. The river is booming now and
still rising.
Those Eastern workingmen who are
striking for higher wages before the tariff
bill gets into operation are trying to -till
the goose before it has a chance to lay the
golden egg.
The new tariff bill bears the title, "An
act to provide revenue for the Govern
ment and to protect the industries of the
United States," and that is why the Demo
crats are fighting it.
It is not surprising to learn tbat the
Spanish troops in Havana have become
mutinous. They have been there long
enough to have felt the influence of the
ail of freedom and the atmosphere of re
volt.
It seems the Greek army is determined
to march to the liberation of Crete or else
to Athens to overthrow the King, and
Prince Constantine is therefore wise in
taking the lead and keeping it headed to
ward Turkey.
A Chicago dramatic critic declares the
people 'of that city who do not attend
opera during Lent are divided into two
classes: those who are too rude to enjoy
music and those who are too poor to pay
for it. It is very different here.
Since the accession of a Repuolican ad
ministration at Washington Spain has
treated American citizens in Cuba with
more respect, and before long she may be
compelled to treat the Cuban patriots ac
cording to the rules of civilized war.
There is more trouble in the Senate over
the silver Republicans who bolted the St.
Louis platform than over all the Demo
crats and Populists put together. The
stray lambs should get back into the folds
of protection and stay there hereafter.
As young Carter Harrison is running for
Mayor of Chicago on the promise to undo
all the Republicans have done in the city
it is easy to foresee that he wili be beaten.
Chicago has had too much experience with
Democratic undoing ever to try it again.
According to the descriptions given it
will be worth while to visit Los Angeles
during the fiesta just to see the costume of
the queen. It seems to be calculated to
discount the inaugural robes of Mrs. Mc-
Kinley and throw a luster over the whole
pageant.
If King Georze should declare war
against Turkey for her failure to keep her
agreement with the powers to protect the
Christians in her dominions the diplomat
ists of England, France. Germany and
Russia would have a really delicate duty
to perform.
The canvass for the city elections in
Chicago and St. Louis shows that gold
Democrats and silver Democrats cannot
agree even on a municipal ticket "When
it comes to making up the slates each side
wishes to have sixteen candidates to one
for the other.
Some of the enterprising men of Salinas
are projecting an electric line to connect
the city with 'the sugar-mill erected by
Claus Spreckels, and thus a new illustra
tion is given of the way in which the com
pletion of one enterprise compels the be
ginning of another. Wben a community
gets started it is bound to keep moving.
The object of the pure food ordinance
is to prevent the sale of goods containing
injurious substances under the form and
name of genuine articles of food, and the
Hoard of Health should be careful to con
duct their enforcement of the law in such
a way. as will enable it to accomplish
what was aimed at If the ordinance is
used to harass dealers in goods which
are compounded of pure food articles it
will cease to have the support of the
people and will eventually become a dead
letter.
SALINAS 1 BRIGHT PROSPECTS.
When the Salinas correspondent of The
Call remarked yesterday "tbat "Salinas,
the county seat of Monterey County, has
brighter prospects to-day than any town
of similar size in California," he bordered
very closely upon truth. Ordinarily,
swteping assertions of that kind are made
under the fervid inspiration of home
ride, or by the sufferance of the tradi
tional license which topographers have
long been permitted to enjoy as compen
sation for the general dull sameness of
their theme; but in this particular in
stance, naihless it were a mere happen-so,
the resort to wholesale praise has hit the
nail squarely upon the bead.
The precise factor which gives a solid
foundation to our correspondent's happy
hit is the circumstance that Salinas has
been chosen as the location for the largest
beet-sugar factory on the Pacific Coast,
and already the residents thereabouts are
thriving upon the anticipation of it.
The sugar-beet industry is exceedingly
profitable. The producer trades directly
with the consumer, gets good prices for
his product and keeps the handling of lis
money wiihin his own commercial circle.
None of the money which is paid to him
for his beets comes out of his part of the
country. It comes from the sales of the
sugar, mostly in the East or in other parts
of the State, as does also the money which
is t>a:d to the factory workmen and wood
haulers of his immediate vicinity. Noth
ing could be more financially beneficial
than this arrangement of always bringing
in and never taking out.
No wonder that Salinas' prospects are
bright. She foresees in Watsonville, her
near neighbor, a state of affluence to which
she herself is bound to attain, through the
same experience- and by virtue of the
same advantages.
WHAT AILS NEVADA?
The Eastern press is much concerned
for the future of Nevada. Her recent ad
diction topagilism has served more than
anything else to persuade tne Eastern edi
torial mind that she is deplorably unregen
erate and going speedily to perdition. The
Boston Advertiser solemnly avers that the
State is a "disgrace" and a "menace" to
the Union and that it is dangerous for
such a community to possess statehood
without having "sufficient manhood to
make a respectable State."
The Washington Post, while mildly cor
rective, deprecates violent denunciation
on the ground that Nevada has a consti
tutional right to do as she pleases in the
matter of prize-fights, also that other
States, including Massachusetts and New
York, have harbored just as brutal fistic
encounters as the Carson fight without
incurring marked reproach from every
other portion of the country.
Another journal points with a scandal
ized uplifting of hands to tbe fact that
Nevada has recently introduced a legisla
tive resolution forbidding her legislators
to speculate in stocks or securities whose
market value i*. susceptible to legislation,
affirming thereon that this is a tacit ad
mission that her legislators would be
thieves if she would permit them to be.
All of these complainers need reminding
of a few things that the delirious heat of
accusation has caused them to overlook.
First, Nevada in countenancing prize
fight is not much worse than those locali
ties which permit prize-fights by an
evasion of the law. Hardly a week passes
without a prize-fight in some Eastern city,
and the East therefore has small right to
condemn the West on that scoie.
In the second place, while Nevada's pro
vision against corruption on the part of
her legislators is not creditable to them as
individuals, it is to be remembered that
the individual legislator of Nevada has
plenty of prototypes outside of Nevada,
and a few in Massachusetts we
haven't the slightest doubt. Besides,
there are county and municipal ordi
nances everywhere which forbid public
officials to trade with the county or the
city which they officially represent lest
they might swindle the taxpayers. It is a
very practical precaution and makes due
allowance for a well-known human
weakness.
So perhaps it would be as well to let
Nevada alone. Until pots can reasonably
call kettles black and people in glass
houses can safely heave pebbles promis
cuously about, Nevada will not be much
worse off than the rest of us.
THE MISSISSIPPI
Again the hopelessly insecure residents
of the Mississippi Valley are shrinking
before a rise in the river. The great
"Father of Waters," superb indifferent
to all the puny restraints which man may
presume to urge upon it, goes grimly on
flooding things as though men were reeds
whose faint rustling by the wayside was
lost in the fathomless sweep of its cur
rent. In spite of levees, in spite of arti
ficial outlets, in spite of all that mortals
have been able to devise for its subjuga
tion, it rites to-day as easily over the con
fines on either side of it as it did years
ago when those confines were unfortified
by man's little diggings and shoveling-;
and pattings of earth along the tops of
them, and when the world was unedified
by the spectacle of him in the cheerful
performance thereof. For no matter how
high its banks may be built,* its bed will
rise, and it all the time rising, from the
sediment which constantly drifts into it,
aDd its surface will correspondingly keep
up within easy reach of an overflow.
The problem of how to control the Mis
sissippi flatly taffies all who venture to
contemplate it. The fact that this tre
mendous volume of water can by no ap
parent human possibility be stayed when
it proceeds 'to ! run over its banks and
drown the adjacent country is one of the
majestic natural conditions before which
'the ingenuity of man must needs lower
its bead in silent admission of its ultimate
futility and insignificance. 7
At present the telegraph tells us that
the water is raising at the rate of . six
inches per day, ana the dwellers in the
lowlands are already preparing for incon
tinent flight . their arms full of 7 bed
clothes and their skirts and coat-tails fes
tooned by clinging urchins dolorously au
dible over their enforced migration. This
seems to De their only resort And the
future holds out no promise of a better
one for their children or for their chil
dren's children. It is merely to be as
sumed that the people of the future will
be forced to , regard the situation as con
siderably more serious tban do the people
of the present, since it is a situation that
will do exactly the reverse of improving
with age. -
PARK IMPROVEMENTS.
In the decision of the Commissioners
of Golden Gate Park to flood it with elec
tric light and bo make it into a great
pleasure ground by night as it has here
tofore been by day, we see another long
stride forward in metropolitan greatness.
San Francisco herein shows again her
progressive spirit . in providing with a
munificent generosity for those legitimate
enjoyments .which* by amply - supplying
an outlet for the natural desire for pleas-;
ure in an energetic population not only
stimulates their capacity for achievements
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1897.
in all forms of industry, but also has a
tendency to limit those vicious and un
wholesome pleasures which enervate a
community and retard its progress! 7
/-â  It is the purpose of the Commissioners ;
to use in this improvement the system of i
lighting best calculated to secure at once
the most thorough efficiency and close
economy. The park will furnish its own
electric current from a power-house built
within the grounds, and thus make sure
the light is supplied at actual coiL The
copper conductors will be laid under
ground, thus ensuring the public against
any possible danger from live wires. The
development of the illumination will be
gradual, but there will be an ample re
serve force in the power-house to ulti
mately extend the great arc lamps over
all the main driveways and make a broad
sheet of white light within which bicy
clers and horsemen can take delight and
Drace their nerves with open-air recrea
tion.
Of coarse the chief glory of the park will
be for daylight enjoyment when the colors*
of the flowers and foliage can be plainly
seen and the contrasts of light and shade
on the lawns join with tue view of the
green hills in the distance to delight the
eye, but the way in which the night light
ing will work to the City's betterment in
happiness and power will be the opportu
nity given for open-air recreation for those
many busy men who burn up all their day
light in arduous toil in office and store.
Among these are units of the communi
ty's growth and welfare who both need
and deserve a bracing outing the most,
and the big park alit will be a gracious
boon to them which they should plan to
profit by.
Another feature of the wisdom of thus
adding to San Francisco's attractions is
that such things draw like a magnet the
most energetic, capable and ambitious
people from all sections to come and make
happy homes in a place so enticing, and
so cause the City to more rapidly grow in
business greatness as well as esthetic and
joy- giving excellence.
THAT POSTOFFIOE.
The California Architect, referring to
The Calls recent prodding of the Federal
authorities in charge of the Postoffice site,
goes to the point of "commiserating the
daily press if they really think tbat
any efforts, however herculean, will have
any effect in piercing (he invulnerable
hide of official indifference to the needs of
San Francisco." Yet this extraordinary
remark doe-* not discourage us from pur
suing the subject a while longer. So long
as the agitation has resulted in any kind
of action even the somewhat chestnutty
action of testing the already overtested
site there is hope that the advantage of
the authorities' attention may extend
itself to other stages of.the work, per
chance to the stage of laying a foundation
for the building.
Activity is manifestly preferable to
somnolent inattention and idleness, and
The Call is not without hope that per
sistent reference to the matter of that very
much delayed Postoffice will ultimately
be crowned with the .reward of beholding
that institution actually looming before
an a well-pleased populace.

CRESWELL STANDS
BY HIGH HATS
Rottanzi's Order Said to
. Be in Derogation of
Civil Liberty.
The Police May Suppress the
Three-Story Bonnets if They
So Desire.
Dr. C lntoa .Champions the Measure
and Claims That Ladies Have No
Right to Wear Them.
Supervisor Rottanzi's theater-hat or
dinance is in a fair way to follow in the
footsteps of many another well-meant
measure, for City and County Attorney
Creswell has put the official stamp of bis
disapproval on it, and pronounced it "in
derogation of civil liberty."
He says that tbe police may banish the
three-story-and -a -basement hat from local
playhouses, but what gallant guardian of
the peace would interfere with a lady's
headgear, even if it was aa tall as the
Tower of Babel?
Attorney Creswell s*?nt the following
communication to the Board of Supervis
ors yesterday in response to an inquiry as
to the legality of the proposed ordinance:
To the honorable the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of Bam Frandseo: 1 nave
examined into the power of the Board of Su
pervisors to pass an ordinance regulating the
character of head adornment to be worn by
ladies when in attendance upon the theaters or
other places of pubi.e amusement, and In con
formity to the wish of the Judiciary Commit
tee of the board herewith transmit my opin
ion on the same:
If this right exists at all it must be found in
the police power of the government wherein
it may "preserve and promote the public wel
fare, et en at the expense of private rights."
If it ls intended by the proposed ordinance
to promote the convenience of patrons of the
theater and other places of public amusement
the board has 'no power to pass and enforce
the ordinance. The police power does not con
fer upon governmental agencies the right to
iegis.ate lor the convenience alone of the put
lie. - The proposed ordinance in my opinion i*
sumptuary in its nature and in derogation of
clvii liberty. Haeey T. Creswell,
Attorney and Counselor.
Supervisor Rottanzi found an unex
pected champion for his measure in Dr.
Clinton when the matter came up beforo
the board yesterday afternoon. Ur. Rot
tanzi was wroth that the legal adviser of
the municipality bad decided against bim,
and instead of moving for a reconsidera
tion of the matter as he had promised to
do at tbe meeting when his oraer was
knocked into a "cocked hat." he asked for
a week's further time. He will consult
eminent legal lights to net opinions to
offset that of Mr. Creswell.
Dr. Clinton said, while the discussion
was going on, that be thought Dr. Rot
tanzi's measure eminently proper; that
ladies had no right to obstruct the view of
male patrons of the theaters by wearing
sky-scraping bonnets, and that when the
ordinance came np for final consideration
he would rote in favor of it.

The Pilot-Boat Bonita Putting to Sea Yesterday in the Teeth of a Strong Gale and a Breaking Bar. She Had a Number of State
Senators Aboard and Not One of Them "Was Able to Enjoy the Scene, as All Were Seasick.'
WENT TO SEA IN
A STRONG NORTHER
Senators Who Braved a
Gale in a Pilot-
Boat
Tbe Eonita Tcok Out a Number
of Guests of the
Pilots.
Many More Casualties Frem Satur
day Night's Storm Were Re
corded Yesteidiy.
The norther kept control of the bay all
of yesterday. Many of the vessels drifted
during the early morning, and some of
them had to be shifted out of danger by
tugs. Several of the sealing fleet at
tempted to make port, but as the bar Was
breaking the pilots ordered them to sea
again.
Tho pilot-boat Bonita had a rough expe
rience going out and the steamer Homer
"caught it" when coming in. The sailing
vessel made the better weather of it, and
the Congressmen and Senators she had
aboard did not fare as badly as did the
passengers on the Hornet.
__ t least fifteen members of the State
Legislature went out on the, Bonita, and
the intention is to stay out at least a
week. "The spirit is willing, but the flesh
is weak," and the chances are that the
week will not have passed its meridian
before tbe Bonita and her passengers will
be back again.
The sealing schooner Epplnger, with
Â£72 skins aboard, attempted to make port,
but the pilot would not tempt the bar and
she bad to put to sea again. Oil was
poured over the stern, but the big rollers
would not be denied and the schooner had
to face them and put to sea again. It was
lucky that the captain followed the ad
vice of the pilot-boat, as the schooner
would assuredly have gone down had she
attempted to run the gauntlet.
The little Pollywog, a new creation of
Commodore C. Baettege, the well-known
scow man, did not prove to be the success
be expected. He went out in her yester
day morning, and, much to his disgust, a
squall turned her over. The launch Amy
picked the crowd up and the Pollywog is
once again at Folsom-street wharf. Cap
tain Baettege says he will await fine
weather before he takes his wife and fam
ily out on a sailing cruise.
Another schooner was in trouble. The
Ruby A. Cousins sailed down from Port
Costa and attempted to make tbÂ« dock at
Folsom No. 2 without the assistance of a
tug. The wind and tide were against her,
however, and she missed stays and crashed
into Folsom No. L The latter wharf was
damaged to the extent of several hundred
dollars and the vessel lost her martingale
and did considerable damage to her stem.
She drifted away from the wharf, and
eventually her anchor held and the sails
were clewed up. Luckily the new struc
ture bad fender-piles, and they saved the
schooner.
The scow schooner Ida did not play in
as good luck, however. She ran into the
wharf at Port Costa and sank. She is a
total wreck and the Whitelaw will have to
be employed to get her out of the way of
navigation.
The Olivebank, on which Murderer But
ler played his part many months ago was
also caught in the gale. She was blown
off the Oakland Creek mud flats, and went
afoul of the St. Nicholas, Sharpshooter
and Inveramsy. The tugs Vigilant and
Alert were ; sent to her assistance, and
finally got her back on the flats and into a
safe anchorage. .None of the vessels ware
damaged to any great extent.
The Maria Hackfeld drifted down toward
the rable, and the telegraph people at
once began to growl. A tug was sent for
and the bark moved, but it was found that
she was at least a hundred yards from the
telegraph : : wires. CapUin Kruse 7 was
aboard, and he ordered tbe boat to the re
finery, where he will discharge the cargo
of sugar be has aboard. ..; â¢ââ¢?.]
The bark Albert, that was to have sailed'
. â *. â  â  â â  *. : *
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1897.
yesterday, did not venture out. She had
a very heavy load for the Hawaiian
Islands and also a deckload of mules and
horses. The captain was afraid of losing
his valuable deckload, and therelore would
not venture out. The Albert will probably
get to sea to-day.
The British ship Saint Mirrem had lots
of fun all by herself at Selby's. Wben
the pale struck her, the captain put out
extra hawser-. The lines proved stanch,
but the vessel lost several of her stanch
ions and the wharf isjmmus four piles.
As no lives were lost, the captain of the
Saint Mirrem is congratulating himself.
Captain George "Western, formerly of
the sealing schooners Bonanza, Alton and
Allie I. Alger, is fitting out a vessel for a
novel cruise. He proposes hunting the
divers that cover the bay at certain sea
sons and then following them to Bolinas,
Drakes and Neah bay--. The white patch
on the bird's breast is all that is valuable,
and for each one secured the Liebes Com
pany has agreed to pay 27)4 cents. As a
man named Campbell is getting from
forty-five to fifty skins a day hunting at
Sausaiito, Captain Western think" that
bis new venture will prove more profit
able than sealing or otter hunting* The
birds migrate every season, and the
schooner will follow tbem from bay to
bay along the coast.
The schooner Transit got In from
Hawaii yesterday after a smart passage of
twelve days. She reports that the brig
Percy Edwards, which sailed from here
last January bound ior "the Adamless
Eden," had put into Hawaii and that
many members of the crew had mailed
letters home. According to the advices
that came up on the schooner all aboard
the Percy Edwards were well and happy,
but no one knew the destination of the
party.
' The Japanese are making trouble on the
various plantations. On the 13th inst.
they rose in arms on the Spreckelsviile
plantation and murdered the interpreter.
The militia was called out and four men
were arrested. An attempt was made to
rescue them, but when the crowd was
charged with fixed bayonets it gave way
and no further attempt at rescue was
made.
The Chief Hvdrographer of the United
States is more than pleased with the man

HAS BOUGHT THE

J. W. Pender, After Much
Experience, Dips Into
Randsburg.

Colonel J. Pender, seventeen years
ago a resident of San Francisco and since
then engaged in mining in many lands,
COLONEL J. W. PENDER, Who Is in San Francisco After
an Absence of Seventeen Years.
y [Sketched from life by a "Caii" artist.] '
including South Africa, Wales and Cripple
Creek, is among the arrivals at the Palace.
Four months ago he went to * Randsburg,
and a few days ago he - and' capitalists he
represented bought a group of seven dif
ferent properties there. The most im
portant mine of the group is the Val
Verde. 7 "
Mr. 1 Pender is president of the organiza
tion^ owning the properties. It is called
the Randsburg Gold J Mining, Milling 'â  and
Water Company. 7 The company is sink
ing several artesian wells to furnish water
for* the milling and mining purposes.
Mr. Pender says the work is to be actively
pushed. He thinks well of the camp and
says in his judgment that in four or five
years it will be a very heavy producer- of
mineral. '
"I have had many experiences since I
left California," said he yesterday, "and
bave done a lot of mining and exploring
in different lands. I built a mill in North
Wales that handled 4500 tons of ore a
month from the mine there. I was several
years abroad, and for a time was consult
ing engineer in South Africa for some
English firms. I was also at Palermo, In
Chihuahua, where I established great
works, of which I was the managing di
rector. I was also for some time general
manager of a gold mining and milling
company in Costa Rica. Prior to going
abroad I was for two years chief eneineer
of the Moffat syndicate, with headquar
ters at _Leadville. After that, for a lime,
I bad the management of the Elkhorn
mine in Montana, and developed it so that
it sold for $1,100,000. J J ,
"Kandsburg seems to me to have a great
future. The surface indications go to
show tbat tbere is unlimited gold-bearing
ore. There is also unlimited chist and
porphyry, with which the ore is in
contact. Digging is also cheap there.
Instead of costing $25 a foot or such a
matter, a 4xÃ shaft can be put down*- for
$12 a foot, while a drift or tunnel can be
run for not to exceed $3. At the same
time ore from the mine can be taken out
at a cost not exceeding $1 a ton.
"If you look all over the. world, too, and
see where the big camps are everywhere
except in South Africa, where there is no
water yon will see they are on the desert.
It is so in Australia and so elsewhere.
People may say there is no water or tim
ber and what a -drawback tnat is, but
when there is no water the ore is much
richer and far easier and cheaper milled.
Mine in water and yon get ; all kinds of
lean streaks, where thousands on thou
sands - of tons of worthless rocks have to
be handled rock in which there is no
gold whatever.; This .:â  being the case, how
much better the desert is after all.
"We are sinking at Randsburg several
artesian wells which will supply all the
water we want We have two down 250
feet, and one I other one that we are going
to put down 500 feet. They are ten miles
from the mine. 7 The 7 Val _ Verde is our
principal property, thong out of seven
we have four that we think will pay well."

ROBBERS PLAY
A NEAT TRICK
Pulled the Plug Out of a
Trough and Got
Gold.
They Had Reconnoitered Their
Victim's Salcon for Three
Weeks,
.-._â â 
Ttea Gave Mr. Schwoem â â¢', the
False Steer" and Pocketed Two
Hundred Dollars-
Charles Schwoenstede, a saloon-keeper
at the corner of .Second and Brannan
streets, was the victim of a bold highway
robbery yesterday, and now b3wails the
loss of nearly $200.
The robbery had been planned for a long
time, for the thieves, three in number,
haa been hanging around his place for the
past three week?, lulling his suspicions by
spending a few nickels every day with him
for steam beer. It was about 11 o'clocic in
the forenoon when two of the three men
entered the saloon and called, for drinks.
As they were being served, the third
member of the gang ran in and cried:
"Charley; the water is all running out of
the trough."
Charley rushed to the watering-trough
on the edge of the sidewalk and saw that
some one had pulled the plug oat of the
bottom, thus letting out the water. When
Charley turned. to go back into the saloon
the three men walked out and broke into
a run down Brannan street.
A hasty glance over the counter showed
Mr. Schwoenstede the trick that had been
played upon him. His cash-drawer, in
which had reposed $150 in gold and about
$50 in silver, was pulled out and lay empty
on the floor. .
Charley is a good runner, and he started
after the hindmost thief, who was a block
ahead of him. He followed him into
South Park, two blocks away, where the
thieves disappeared. ' " J/J .
Schwoenstede reported the affair to
Captain Lees and Chief of Police Crowley.
Something in his description of the men
recalled reminiscences, and the album of
photographs entitled the Rogues' Gal
lery was consulted. Two ex-convicts were
pointed out as being two of the gang -by
the saloon-keeper, and the entire detective
force was turned loose to catch the
thieves. -7.7-
Mr. Schwoenstede'3 brother, who keeps
a saloon on the corner of Twelfth and
Harrison streets, was shot at by burglars
in hi** store last Saturday. They were
probably the same gang of desperadoes.
OOEBETT AFTER â " PITZ."
Tbe Champion and It- Champion Will
Meet at Salt Lake City.
Jim Corbett, the ex-champion heavy
weight pugilist of the world, left this City
last evening with his . trainer, McVey, for
Salt Lake City, where he is booked to give
an exhibition on Wednesday evening.
Champion Fitzsimmons will also give
an exhibition in Salt Lake City on the
same evening and the sporting people are
anxious to see bow the lighters will draw.
Some small bets were made yesterday that
Corbett will attract a larger crowd than
the champion. The Californian says tbat
he will try and exhibit in every town and
city that his successful opponent will
appear in .on his journey through the
States to New York.
Corbett thinks that if he can prove to
Fitzsimmons that the latter is not a draw
ing card the champion will become dis
gusted with touring and will withdraw
his statement of retiring from the ring. y
Anyhow Corbett says that he will keep
after Fitzsimmons until the champion
will afford bim another opportunity to
either win back bis lost laurels or go down
a whipped man for the second and last
time.
Quite a number of Corbett's friends saw
him off last evening on his Eastern tour.

CHRISTIANITY'S FUTURE.
Rev. H. Dharmapala Collates New and Old
Doctrines of Theology. *
Following his lecture on Saturday evening on "The Future of Christianity in
Asia," Rev. H. Dharmapala has written the following on the broader : theme, "The
Future of Christianity," for The Call:
.We are living in critical times. The people have been aroused from their long
slumbers. The priest, the theologian, the dogmatist, the atheist and the materialist
have been for the first time confronted with a new doctrine which makes all things
new. Theological dogmatics have been put into the crucible of analysis by the in
vestigating searcher alter truth ; the , gods have teen asked to come down from their
thrones and show themselves to men, and the annihilationists have been shocked by
the declaration that nothing could be annihilated.
For the first time in the history of Christendom a new light is being thrown upon
the dark sheet, making the people to see things which had been hitherto hidden from
them. The patient researches of that indefatigable man of science, Darwin, have
given us a new conception of the universe and man. . .
Huxley, Tyndall and their associates of the school of evolutionists; astronomers
like Kelvin, Ball and Fiammarion ; psychologists like Kibot, and pnysicists like
Mach, have deluged the world of : thought by tueir indefatigable labors in the domain
of science, where tha priest and the dogmatist cannot go. About 300 years ago Gior
dano Bruno was burned to death by the church authorities ot Christendom lor the
scientific declaration he had made that there are other worlds besides, this earth.
Calvin had his mend tortured to death for a difference of opinion about the divinity
oi the Sou of God. The Catholic church organized the Inquisition and several mil
lions ol people were persecuted and burned to death during the time the church had
the power of ruling over men's minds in Europe. _"';â  ,-*â 
If the saying "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church" is true in build
ing up the superstructure of ecclesiastical Christianity it is equally true that the
blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church 01 science. The bright sunshine that
we all enjoy to-day is made doubly enjoyable on account of the freedom we enjoy in
the domain of thought. .
The inquisitors in early days had no telescopes to look into infinite space to find
out the countless solar systems, and in their ignorance they tortured and killed inno
cent men. Blessed are they who are born in this era of freedom and enlightenment
What the ecclesiastical dogmatists denied in their infatuated ignorance the scientist of
the present day demonstrates by practical experiments in the laboratory. The scien
tific philologist and the antiquarian have unearthed gems that have been hidden from
our view for thousands of centuries. The Egyptologist, the Assyriologist, the Orient
alist and the Sinologue has each in his own way brought Irom his own field of study
the results of his researches, and now we are in possession of an inexhaustible mine of
ideas which have to be accepted alter investigation and analysis.
Nineteen centuries ago the weak and lowly Nazarene went forth among the Gali
leans and in the spirit of compassion taught them simple ethics. The people of
Judaea could not appreciate him and the prophet of Nazareth was discarded by his
own people. His mission of reform was too early and he had to die a martyr to his
cause. In the name of him who wanted mercy and not sacrifice what terrible deeds
have been perpetrated during the eighteen centuries that have passed away. Millions
have been persecuted, killed and burned by the followers of the man who, dying on
the cross, declared, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." Nineteen
centuries of ecclesiastical Christianity have "deluded the world with the blood of
several millions of people. Intolerance, bigotry and persecution bave gone hand in
hand with the church of Christ. Â«
For the first time in the history of European Christianity the theological dog
matics of the West have been put into the ciucible of scientific analysis with the
result that we have now either to accept the fables of the early Semitic tribes as
unchanging truths or place them in the same category of folklore tales. But in the
folklore tales the scientist finds the evolution of religions ideas among a primitive
people wuo had no conception of the evolutionaiy laws of nature. The primitive
races had not the intelligence nor the scientific training of the present day to enter
the laboratory of nature and discover great ideas. The Semitic races had never given
a Darwin, a Spencer or a Huxley. All the knowledge they had was obtained from
tbe Persian, Egyptian and Assyrian sources. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel
and Daniel, like the Brahtnamcal Bisbis, undoubtedly did influence for a time the
Jewish people for a few hundred years by their prophetic revelations.
For nearly 500 years, betweeu tne last of the prophets and the birth of Jesus
Christ, there had been no great prophet born among the Jews. During this period it
is obvious that the Persian and Semitic duatistic systems were influenced by the
doctrines of the Aryan teachers of India*) who were then traveling all over the prov
inces of Iran, Kandahar and Turkestan, disseminating the teachings of compassion,
peace and universal brotherhood. The disciples of Budaha three centuries before
Christ were active in their missionary propaganda, which reached its perfection in the
first century of the Christian era, unuer the great King Kanisha. By the end of the
century ail Asia had acknowledged the undisputed leadership of the great teacher ol
compassion, Gautama Buddha.
The Buddha appeared in India at a time of great spiritual and philosoph ical activ
ity. Ii was on the healthy soil of the free and independent Aryan mind that Buddha
began to sow the seeds of his new religion. After, having studied tbe Brahmanicai
speculative philosophies and the lives of the ascetics the Buddha rejected their
theories, condemned tn- ir ascetic habits and hoisted the standard of his new religion.
Having organized a spiritual brotherhood he admitted ali without distinction of race,
creed or co.or. Dressed in yellow robes, these disciples of Shakya, "Samana Sakya
putras," as they were called, went irom place to place preaching the gospel of peace,
love, universal brotherhood and the noble unselfish life.
Although twenty-four centuries have passed away since this great revolution oc
curred, the vitalizing effect of the religious ideas of the Buddha has not been abso
lutely lost", and the student of philosophic thought still finds mental pabulum to
satisfy his appetite in the religion bequeathed by the great teacher. Savage countries,
like Thibet and Mongolia, have been brought under the humanizing influence of the
gentle teachings of the Buddha. The first great missionary religion in- the world.it
spread within the limits of the Indian Peninsula during tbe life of the promulgator
himself. Compassion to animals, the brotherhood of man, the equality, of sexes, the
education of women and the law of Karma these were the fundamental principles
that were disseminated by the Buddhist missionaries. Wherever these missionaries
went they carried with them the civilization of.the ancient Aryans of India. The
manufacture and sale of intoxicating drinks were put a stop to and peopie taught the
evil effects of alcoholism.
These Buddhist missionaries became the educators, preachers and teachers of the
peopie. The monastic establishments became centers of learning and the people
always took a share in their development. Gentle, unselfish, compassionate, virtuous,
these pure-hearted apostles of Buddha, dressed in their yellow robes, without means,
expecting no costly or heavenly reward, traveled, crossing the mountains, seas and
deserts, to unknown lands. >
Max Muller says: "The future battle for the spiritual domination of the world
will have to be fought between Buddhism, Christianity and Mohammedanism."
Civilized humanity would think twice before accepting the tenets of Islam as enun
ciated by the Prophet Mohammed. The destruction of Buddhism in India. Chris
tianity in Palestine and Asia Minor and Zoroastrianism in Persia is due to the savage
vandalism of the bloodthirsty followers of the Arabian prophet.
The spiritual battle for the domination ot the world has to be fought between
the two great missionary religions Ãuddhism and Christianity. Whatever the
zealous propagandist may think of his own creed, in the nature of things it is not
possible to convert the whole **Yorid to Â»one form of religion. We may as well attempt
"to propagate one breed of horses, destroying all other life and all other species. It
is man's ignorance of the evolutionary nature of the world that makes him . think
that the world can be brought into one permanent state of being. Every organism
is undergoing momentary changes, and there is no permanency in a thing in itself
for two consecutive minutes. Perpetual motion is the only permanent law exhibiting
itself in the manifestation of phenomena that come into existence and finally pass
away. ...-;*""â .--:..._
The history of Christianity shows the evolution it has undergone since the ethical
teachings were first promulgated by the Son of man eighteen centuries ago. They
were too sublime to be appreciated by the materialistic and priest-ridden people of his
time, and he died a martyr to his own teachings, showing the spirit of forgiveness to
those who had crucified him. Failing to grasp the spirit of his sacrifice ana the great
truth it conveyed the disciples of the gentle teacher in their devotion to the personal
ity of Jesus began to idolize the figure, forgetting the life and the teachings. The
result was the foundation of a chuich on emotional sentimentalism, which later on
developed into an ecclesiastical workshop, with all the complications of an unwieldy
machine with the crushing wheels of theological speculations of metaphysical hair
splitters.
The history of Christianity from the first century, down to the year 1837 shows
that the spirit of Christ was never in the church. Ecclesiastical Christianity, with its
speculations, dogmas, priestly power, is not the Christianity oi Christ. His teach
ings are not to be found in the life of the people in Christendom. The Christian priest
has become like the Pharisee of the time of Christ. He is like the blind man leading
the blind. There is wealth, power and sellishne-ss; bul no compassion, self-sac
rifice and, unselfish love in the doctrines imparted to the people.
Science has turned its guns on the priestly fortifications. Speculative Christianity
must go. Tne Jewish traditions recorded in the Old Testament are only Jewish tra
ditions, not of the world. If Christianity clings to the tribal traditions which are an
tagonistic to the world traditions it cannot have a place in universal history and can
not claim a univeral acceptance. The theories of Jews may be truths to the half-civ
ilized Semitic races; hut to ti.e scientific evolutionist who has conceptions of the
immensity of space and life and who sees countless solar systems through the refined
telescopes the Christian theories do not suffice. . -
Christianity to become universal should associate itself with universal truths.
Dogmas, speculations and ecclesiastical superstitions of theologians of the past have
made Christianity a machine of torture. Civilized humanity, with the experiences of
their own scientific researches, should not be enslaved by the Mosaic or Calviniatic or
Papal manifestos. "Ye are the light of the world," said Jesus, who proclaimed to the
Jews that "he that doeth the wili of my Father he is my mother and brother," enun
ciating^ new conception of univer*>alism and bringing all humanity into one common
center in the utterance he made, "Your Father and my Father." ...
The world cares-little for theories and speculations and beliefs. By persecution,
by fraud and dishonest means the priest may for a time uphold them, but it is not
permanently possible.
- -With the wealth, intelligence and energy that theological Christianity has it can
be converted into an agency of blessing; but the priest must first, become unselfish,
compassionate and holy, taking Christ as the ideal of a beautiful, noble, self-sacrificin"
life. H. DHARMAPALA, General Secretary Maha Bodhi Society. "." "

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1897.
THE LATE JAMES P. THOMAS.
Death has removed from the Commission Merchants' Association the well
known member, James P. Thomas, whose place of business was located on the
southwest corner of Davis and Clay streets. \ '
The deceased had' been a member of the San Francisco Produce Exchange for
about twelve years and was the publisher of Thomas' Produce Market Report.
Previous to opening business for himself he had been in the employ of H. Dutard
and other produce commission houses.
Mr. Thomas was about 55 years of age and was a native of England. He was a
very finely built man, being about 6 leet 4 inches in- height, straight and. well
proportioned. This bearing he acquired by having served in her British Majesty's
Life Guards, a reeitnent where none under six-feet are accepted. He had resided
in this City for the past thirty years, and it is thought had accumulated quite a
good stake of the world's goods, as he lived quietly at 917 Market street, where he
died last Sunday after a short illness.
The Produce Exchange yesterday appointed a- committee, composed of H.
Dutard, Julian Newman and L. W. McGiauflin, to draft resolutions of respect to
his memory. ~'v ."
His funeral will take place this afternoon from the undertaker's at Geary and
Stockton streets. . >

When the members of the Board of Su

J. Dunne as an assistant in District Attor
ney. Barnes' office, even after they had
been warned that Auditor Broderick would
not sign his salary warrants because tbere
is no money in ti.e special counsel fund,
they probably did not understand that
they were obligating themselves to pay
him out of their own pockets. There will
probably be a wild scramble to rescind the
action when tbey learn the true import of
what they have done.
Mf. Dunne was employed some time ago
to assist the District Attorney, and in a
strone communication to the board Mr.
Barnes urged that he b> retained.
Mayor Pbelan warned the board that
there was rio money to pay him, and said
that he hud been retained to prosecute
violators of the pure-food laws w en the

work. Nevertheless the board voted to
retain him. * J : j
The following resolution was introduced
by Supervisor Clinton for the purpose of
preventing discrimination in the assess
ment of real and personal property and to
prevent property in the City and County
of San Francisco from being raised by the
State Board of Equalization:
â  Whereas, The State Board . of Equalization
has repeatedly raised the total assessment of
real and personal property of this city and
County to make it eon torn to the assessments
of other counties as alleged and in support of
said action has presented cases of assessments
illustrative of a discrimination in the assessed
valuation of property In this City and County,
and by reason thereof has increased the
valuation of the assessable I property, of this
City and County, notably the increase of 20
per cent on the assessed value of the present
year; and whereas, the taxpayers of this City
and County have no desire to escape by an im
proper valuation the payment lof their quota
of taxes for State and county purposes and ob
ject to nny such action as results in. imposing
nu increase of taxation because of the alleged
lact mat certain property is not as^bssud on a
lair and equitable valuation, as required by
law, thereby imposing an unjust burden upon
property wnich is â¢ fully and fairly assessed,
creating a discrimination and a burden wholly
in violation of the fundamental principles
that all property should be assessed at its cash
value; and whereas, the action of the State
Board of Equalization, as prescribed, is limited
to equalizing the valuation of the taxable !
property of the ; several counties in the State
lor tlie purpose of taxation, and if such causes
exist us are claimed by said board the only
remedy is in this board, which ; has power
to Increase or lower any assessment, or make
the same conform -to its true value, and
for that purpose i this board meets from the
first to the third Monday in the month of July
of each year; and whereas, some: intelligent
action should be taken by this board to ex
amine Into the principles upon which assess
ments are made and to invite the members of
the State : board \to ; examine | the I assessment
books and the assessments made therein/and
if complaints * are '< made as . to i the assessed
valuation of any property assessed on aaid
books to make with the Assessor such investi
gation into said complaints lor the purpose of
ascertaining the true valuation, and If on said
investigation |it is disclosed I that I the assess
ment of said property should be raised or low
ered to make it con form to the valuation as
provided by law to have said assessment ad
justed by the Assessor as in case of a failure or
neglect on the part of the Assessor to cause the
same to be corrected, as required by law ; and
whereas, if such information is 'obtained and
the ; principles understood Â» upon which i all
property is assessed in .this; cuy and County
its representatives, if. required, to: appear be
lore the State board, will : be^ prepared. to pre
sent their, case Intelligently and with a full
knowledge of ? the valuation "of property - as
made b>* the Assessor and equalized by this
board; and wnereaÂ«, if such action is taken
the discrimination- in assessments heretofore
prevailing will not exist, and each taxpayer
will pay on a true and equable assessment of
his property alike fair to nil, and. the repre
sentatives of tbis City will be ;in a position to
warrant a demand for a decrease instead of an
increase in the total valuation at the hands of
the State board when it meets for the purpose
of equalizing , the . valuation of .': the ', taxable
property of the ! several l counties ! for I tbe pur
pose ot taxation; therefore .--Jr.;-'-. -://â  >â¢â¢-..
Resolved, That a standing â  committee of this
board be created to be designated the "com
mittee on assessments," whose duty it shall
be to carry out the intent and purpose of this
resolution in furtherance of the interests of
the taxpayers of San Francisco, the said com
mittee to consist of three members of the
board, to be appointed by his Honor, the
Mayor, and the power is nereby conferred
upon the said committee to make such exami
nation and investigation as may be required
to carry out, the objects and purposes of this
resolution. '
The measure was adopted.
The Richmond District Improvement
Association petitioned the board to sta
tion a tire engine company and machine
near the Clin- House. The same organi
zation requested that air protests against
the paving of First avenue, beiween Point
Lobos avenue and Fulton street, be
ignored, and thst the time limit be en
forced on- the contractor who is grading
Caliiornia street, between Central and
First avenues. â :â â â - ây-y-

resolution to employ an additional physi

it was decided to hold a meeting of the

the rooms of the board and that all inter

The Market-street Railway Company
submitted a report of the receipts of its
lines that are operated under percentage
franchises as requested by law. During
the year 1896 the lines took in $193,554 65
which at 2 per cent nets Â»he City ' $3871 09.
The Buildings Committee was empow

Mayor Phelan called the attention of
the Fire Department Committee to the
necessity of compelling each theater to
keep a fireman and tire apparatus ready
during all performances, so as to prevent
danger from fire*
Supervisor Britt offered a resolution
whicn in effect abolished the rattler test.
He stated that it was not a just test and
that it was a common rumor about town
that if the rattler test was finally decided
on the price of rock would go up all over
town and that the taxpayers wouid have
to pay exorbitant prices for their work.
Supervisor Smith said that the test was
a necessity in order to make certain that
good rock should be used in street work
and tout if ii was found that a combina
tion existed among the contractors it
wonld be an easy matter to repeal the
ordinance upholding the test and teach
the contractors a lnsÂ»on. .
Then Supervisor Clinton took a hand in
the discussion.
"It is common talk," he said, "that pe
culiar measures, to say the least, have
been used to perpetuate the rattler test
and this board should not aliow itself to
rest under, the suspicion of having felt
these influences."
- The resolution was defeated.

HOW TO DETECT IT.
Some Valuable Hints Regarding the
. Grippeâ Signs __ of Its Approach and
7 How to "Counteract Them.
â¢ The discussion as to the { cause of the
Grippe is/of course, interesting, but give-^
little satisfaction to its unfortunate vic
tims. Whether caused by microbe or
vagaries of the weather, its ravages con
tinue, and the country still bends under
the scourge. " - . ' ; ' -â¢'*''â 
It cannot be too strongly irarresssd on
people that, in order to ward off the dis.
ease, warning symptoms must bs regard
ed and prompt action taken. It becomes
extremely d rhcult to dislodge tne disease
if allow- dto take -its course. Hence its
name. It generally commences with a
slight headache, or. pains in the small of
of the back or limbs. It does not always
give one even as plain a hint as thatâ a
feeling of tightness across the forehead,
buzzing in the ears, or peculiar feeling
about the eyes, may be all the caution one
gets; so i i is culpable caielessness to neg
lect even these slight signs. â¢/---; .*. ;
The remedy lies in a stimulant, and tha
preferenca suould be given to whiskey.
â All the doctors of the country are agreed
on this point, but are very careful to im
press on their patients the fact. that pure
whiskey alone 1 must be tai:en. Duffy's
Pure Malt Whiskey is the purest on the
market, and can be readily obtained at all
stores. There are many imitators
who say tbeir whiskies are "just as good"
Do not be deceived. They are not. Duffy s
Pure Mr it is the only medicinal one.

THE GREAT ISSUE
Forced Upon Carriers by
the Recent Court
Decision.
1 .
A Novel Suggestion Discussed
by Traific Manager
] Stubbs.
Withdraw of the Southern Pacific
From the L cal Passengar
Association.
It is generally conceded by railroad
men that the recent decision of the Su
preme Court will compel the dissolution
of all railroad organizations having for'
tbeir object the maintenance of rates or
the apportionment of traffic. They fur
ther recognize that no relief from the situ
ation can be found under the law as in
terpreted by the highest tribunal in the
country. Some, however, hope that a re
hearing of the matter may be secured, and
that on a more comprehensive showing
and argument the decision of the court
may be so modified as to permit of the
maintenance of associations which will
[ provide for the fixing of joint rates and
thus prevent complete demoralization of
the railroad business by a runious rate
war.
The latest suggestion to overcome the
anticipated evils of the decision is to give
the Interstate Commerce Commission the
power to make interstate rates throughout
the United States. In this way it is hoped
to maintain that stability of reasonable
rates, which is said to be as advantageous
to the public at large as to the railroads.
Traffic Manager J. CL Slubbs of the
Southern Pacific Company, wbo is ac
knowledged to bo one of the shrewdest
and ablest men in his line in the United
Mates, sees little relief from such an ar
rangement. He expressed his views on
the subject yesterday as follows:
I should say that such a method of fixing
rates would be utterly impracticable. It
would be impossible for a board of seven
railroad commissioners, sitting in Washing
ton, to fix rates all over the Cnited States.
No State board has ever been able to fix rates.
Xo railroad company has ever been able to do
itâ make a fixed general tariff go that it will
run for any length of time. There will be
continual changes necessary, with respect to
particular commodities and with respect to
particular service and particular districts. A
tariff should be flexible.
In order to be able to undertake this work
a: all the Interstate Commeiee Commission
would have to have a representative on the
trnffic staff of every railroad in the United
states, with fall powc- to act, in order to be
able to establish rates without damage tothe
community which the railroad companies
serve or the public interests.
The Interstate Commerce Commission under
the most favorable circumstances can do no
more than examine the tariffs submitted by
the railroad companies, and approve them as
maximums, allowing the railroad companies
full liberty of action within the maximums.
That would afford the railroad companies pre
cisely the seme power that they possess to
day. The law, as I understand, requires rail
road companies to file with the Interstate
Commerce Commission their tariffs, and when
the tariffs are ?o fiied they become the legal
tariffs. Xo higher or lower rates can be made
without giving ten days' notice for any ad
vance, -or three days for reductions. What
more authority is it possible to give the com
mission? None that 1 can think of, except in
the case of complaint against a rate as to its
unreasonableness.
The Supreme Court, as I understand, has de
eded that the commission, while it can find
whether the rate in point is reasonable or not,
it it declares it unreasonable has not the
Authority to determine or fix what ls a reason
able rate. That is about all the additional
authority with regard to rate-making, the
Interstate Commerce Commission is seeking.
That may be given by Congressional action,
but I doubt it. In fact I think If you wiil
poll the rate-paying community you will find
a very large majority who prefer that the
rates should be made by the railroad people,
who understand their business, than that the
rates should be made by a board at Washing
ton.
Let me illustrate the difficulties that would
beset such a board. Suppose a shipper in Kan
Irancisco wanted to place his goods in the
Missouri River territory. On inquiry he finds
that the established rates will not enable him
to market his goods in competition with other
sections enjoying lower rates. He cal.'s upon
the carriers operating between San Francisco
and the Missouri River. He represents the
conditions and asks them to make a rate that
will enable him to meet tbat competition.
How would he like to be told to send his ap
plication to Washington and ask the Inter
state Commerce Commission to authorize the
rate?
The Interstate Commerce Commission has
been presumed to construe its authority as
enly to be exercised in the matter of unreason
ably high rates. In other words, thatitshou.d
protect the public against rates deemed uu
reasonaDly high, but not the railroads from
unreasonably low rates made by bad manage
ment. If it should be clearly made the duty
of the Interstate Commerce Commission to re
strain carriers from making unreasonably low
rates as weii as unreasonably high rates there
might be some benefit to carriers as well as to
shippers.
Railroad men believe that railroad property
or money invested in railroads is as mucn en
titled to protection at the hands of the Gov
ernment as money invested in iarms or manu
factories. â ':â .â -'.
Traffic Manager Stubbs illustrated this
point by citing the case of the Burlington
and Northern Railroad. It Blade a very
low through rate between Chicago and St.
Paul in competition with the Chicago.
Milwaukee and St. Paul and the Chicago
and Northwestern. The Burlington and
Northern passed through an undeveloped
and unproductive territory, wnile its com
petitors passed through thickly populated,
rich and productive country. For this
reason the latter while they met the
through rates of their competitor could
not and did not apply such rates to inter
mediate points and thereby violated the
long and short haul clause of the inter
state commerce law. Complaint was made
against them, and although it was shown
that the rates established by the Burling
ton and Northern resulted in toss to all
concerned the commission held that there
was a violation of the law in Charging a
higher rate for a short haul than for along
haul over the same line.
"I understand," concluded Mr. Stubbs,
"that the stand taken by the Interstate
Commerce Commission â â  was that it was
not their business to protect the railroads
from unreasonable competition. Subse
quent'v the B. and N. went into bank
ruptcy."
Notice was given yesterday by 'the
Southern Pacific Company and the Rio
Grande Western to the local passenger
association of withdrawals from.that or
ganization. Similar action was taken last
week by the Chicago, Burlington and
Qtiincy and by the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific. This means the undoubted
and complete dissolution of the associa
tion, but not that nn immediate rate war
will necessarily follow.

Presbyterian Church, at the corner of Oak and
Baker streets, on Friday evening, for the bene

to have died by accidental' drowning by a
Coroner's Jury yesterday.
TWO CITIES AND TWO SIDES
Santa Rosa . and San Bernardino on : tfye Project of a .New
Constitution
DR. J. W. JESSE, Mayor of Santa Rosa.
Basra Rosa, March 26, 1897.
Editor Call: The late lamented Legislature redeemed itself in its closing hours by
passing the joint resolution providing for the calling of a convention to revise the
State constitution. That our present fundamental law is defective in many respects
is evidenced by the flood of amendments offered at each session of the Legislature. I
am informed that no less than thirty-seven amendments were proposed in the upper
house alone at the last session.
Most of these proposed changes were in relation to revenue and taxation, and
point witb unerring accuracy to the weakest spots in our organic law. Many of
them were to correct the evils in our judicial system and to control the growing
influence of corporations.
By adopting even the best of these amendments we would have but a crazy-quilt
constitution, increasing the intricacies of an already complex litigation and which
would the snd completely block the Supreme Court calendar with constitutional
questions.
Some of the amendments offered were most excellent changes, notably the one
passed by the House and defeated in the Senate, giving the Legislature power to regu
late taxation.
That this measure was killed by the influence of big land-holders and real-estate
men who feared the rapidly growine single tax sentiment is, to my mind, one of the
most cheerful signs of the times and the best thing that could have happened.
By defeating the bill calling for submitting the amendment to the people the
opponents of sing tax paved the way for the joint resolution and allowed the taxa
tion question to become the dominant issue before the' coming convention. -The
wide discussion which must follow during the next three- years will prove of
inestimable value in educating the people on the single tax, and its benefits will
become apparent, I am convinced, to even the most casual student on the subject.
Local self-government for cities of all classe* is one of the changes most likely to
be made and one very badly needed. Tbe old English parish system is not suitable
to the needs of the American people, who demand home rule.
County government should also be by home rule, and in fact local self-government
should be granted to every political subdivision" of the State. Salaries without con
tingent expenses, fixed by those who have to do the paying, will leave thousands of
dollars in the treasury that now go to line private pockets, and the saving effected by
simplifying the levying and collection of taxes will pay the expenses of the conten
tion many times over in the first year after the new constitution is in operation.

CLUNIE EXPECTS
THE COMMISSION
M. R. Higgins Resigns . as
Insurance Commis
sioner.
Appointment to Fill the Va
cancy to Be Made Before
Next Thursday.
A J. Clunie Goes to Sacramento With
Governor Budd and Expects to
Return as Incumbent.
Andrew J. Clunie is "next tdnimself"
this time and according to inside intelli
gence next to Governor Budd. Mr. Clunie
has already been nominated by the Gov
ernor and confirmed by the Senate for the
officfe of Insurance Commissioner for four
years from April 5, 1808. But this; is not
all. M. R. Higgins. the present Insurance
Commissioner, has resigned. The term
for which he was appointed by Governor
Markham does not expire until April,
1898, but having received the offer of a
lucrative salary and a permanent position
as general superintendent of the Pacific
Mutual Life Insurance Company he has
decided to resign the public office. His
resignation, to take effect Thursday of
this week, is in the hands of the Governor.
There are two applicants for the honor
and emoluments of the unexpired term,
namely, Andrew J. Clunie of San Fran
cisco and ex-Senator H. C. Gesford of
Napa. Mr. Gesford was once appointed
by Governor. Budd Insurance Commis
sioner, but Mr. Hk; ins, by the aid of the
courts, held the office, so all that the Napa
statesman got out of the deal was the los
ing end of a lawsuit.
The insurance men, or many of them at
least, favor the selection of Mr. Clunie for
the unexpired term on the ground that he
is to have the full term beginning in
April, 1898. They argue: "We don't want
three Insurance Commissioner* inside of
two yearj. Since Mr. Higgins h2s decided
to retire Mr. Clunie should go in and hold
the office for five years. Should Mr.
Gesford .be appointed to succeed Mr.
Higgins, and Mr. Clunie, by his appoint
ment already confirmed,': succeed Mr.
Ges.'ord, the Insurance business might
be subjected to all kinds of regulation."
Governor Budd left the City ior Sacra
mento" Sunday evening and Mr.Ciunie
went also. It is said in circles ;ot insur
ance that A. J. : will ; return from Sacra
mento with his commission for: the Hig
gins' unexpired term. i Surely he deemed
it prudent and wise to keep next to the
Governor.
In the campaign which preceded the last
gubernatorial election A. J. Clunie was an
TnE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1897.
ardent and impassioned supporter of Gov
ernor Budd, and General Thomas J.
Clunie, Andy's brother, was a cheerful
giver to the Democratic campaign fund.
It was then -upp<-Â«ed that A. J. would be
commissioned by Governor Budd. to step
into the registration office ot San Fran
ciscoand take command. Something hap
pened which has nojrer been told, and
William Hinton got the office of Registrar
of Voter-. The next flash over the wires
from Sacramenio may tell of A. J. Clunie' a
victory in his fight for the office of Insur
ance Commissioner.
Many politicians seem to regard it as re
markable that Mr. Higgins should resign
from a place so much coveted. Money to
run the office for the next two years has
been provided by the following items in
the general appropriation bill:
For salary of Insurance Commissioner,
$6000.
For salary of Deputy Insurance Com
missioner. $3600.
For traveling and contingent expenses
and attorney's fees of the Insurance Com
missioner $4000.
J M. R. Higgins. in his new line of em
ployment, will, in addition toother duties,
have oversight of all outside worK and the
field force of the Pacific Mutual Life In
surance Company. He .is not a stranger
to insurance work and is moreover a man
of superior business attainments. He has
a good many of the attributes of a rustler.
He made his- advent in San Francisco
from Los Angeles as Colonel MarKhain's
confidential man on the campaign com
mittee of the Republican State Commit
tee during the gubernaturial .contest
which terminated in the election of the
magnetic statesman from Pasadena. Mr.
Higgins was subsequently appointed pri
vate secretary of Governor Marknam, and
later on obtained the office of Insurance
Commissioner. He was an active, ener
getic man on the Republican State Com
mittee during the last National campaign.'
The acceptance of private employment is
regarded as an indication that he is here
to stay and grow up with the town.

J. E. LAWSON, President of the Board of City Trustees of
San Bernardino, Cal.
San Bernardiso, Cal., March 24, 1897.
Editor Call: 1 believe that a constitutional convention ought to be called in this
State. The present instrument is certainly very defective and susceptible of vast
improvement. The State has reached a plane of population and intelligence which
imperatively demands a change in the fundamental law of the Golden State.
I believe that the people would elect as members of a constitutional convention the
best and ablest men in the State, and that the result of their deliberations would be a
modern constitution. In my judgment, the document ought to bo pain, brief, con
cise and embodying only fundamental principles of State government leaving tbe
amplifications of those principles to the general Assembly.
It ought to embrace the provision for biennial sessions of the Legislature, but
there should be no limit to the length of these sessions, except the will of a majority
of the member--. . ".." â  Â-.
The present pay of members of the General Assemby is altogether too small. I
believe that the members ought to be paid $1000 per session. At the present rate of
compensation no man can afford to leave a paying business, pay the costs of an elec
tion and expenses at Sacramento and come out anywhere near even. With unlimited
length of sessions and $1000 for a session, the State would get better men as legisla
tors, and consequently, better laws.
From the new constitution should be omitted all reference to commutations
railroad or otherwise. A brief, terse and plain statement of the duties and powers of
the executive, legislative and judicial departments is about all that should rind a
place in a State constitution.- â "-â¢â â¢<-;.- "".â¢.'_ ','
I consider it of vital importance to the welfare of California that the so-called
"mortgage tax" provision, of the present constitution should be annulled at the
earliest possible moment. In their verdancy the framers of the Kearney instrument
thought tbat they had. provided a plan whereby a loaner of money would pay the tax
on money loaned. But does he? Practically experience by borrowers is that they
hand over the tax money in the way of added interest to the loaner, and he, as their
agent, pays it to the tax collector. In fact, the loaner adds a per cent or. two by way
of commission for serving as agent for tne borrower.
There are many other changes that ought to be made in the present apology for a
constitution, and I am firmly in favor of calling a convention to frame a document of
fundamental law which shall be in consonance with the present and future intelli
gence and population of the State of California. The days of sandlot Kearneyism
have gone forever, and a new, better and progressive race of men have . taken their
places both now and forever. The vast and varied interests of the State demand a
constitution that shall be a model for otber commonwealths in clearness of statement
and principles enunciated. J. E. La SON, President Board of City Trustees.

The Building to Bs Completed in Nine
Months, and There Will Bj '
Â No Interruptions.
The Hall of Justice, the building of
which has been so long delayed, to the
great joy of certain steam-beer palaces on
Park avenue and Larkin and McAllister
streets, will begin to rise tbia morning,
and the clink of the trowel will rill with
merry. sound the vacant lot in which soli
tude has brooded for these many montns
agone. - - ,â¢';"'"
Even the gloomy Morgue will cheer up
with the unwonted noises, and the beer
joints will put on fresh coats of paint and
nigh standing collars of bitter foam, lor
tha thine which they long had sought has
come at last. The shyster and bis legiti
mate prey, -'the drunk," together with
the Police Court capper, the professional
juror and the straw bondsman all will be
back again to the old battlefield, the site
of so many thrilling scenes, and they will
not pass idly by the magic V, which
speaks at once of a iuxury and its price.
The drunkard's cell will reverberate
witb the maudlin oaths of the irrascible
and robbed sailor and the sods and howls
of the -painted pirates of the pave, and
caged innocence will grin behind the bars
and will boisterously welcome the new ar
rival. â â *'.':
But this time they Will be faraway from
the madding crowd. They will have risen
from the sordid deeps of the basement to
the top^loor, where the air is purer, even
though the moral atmosphere may be as
bad as it ever was. The jail will be in the
garret and the good people will be on the
ground floor.
This morning the bricklayers will begin
work on the much-delayed edifice, and the
building, will be continued without in
terruption until its completion. The con
tract requires that the structure shall, be
finished iv ten months from the first ot
the present monthâ New Year's
day. A big pile of mortar was mixed five
or six days ago and has been allowed to
stand and ripen. ..; ,., ;â ";., J.
At 11 o'clock this morning the Building
Committee of the Board \>f Supervisors
will meet with Architect Shea, Contractor
Bateman and others for consultation as to
the best method for forwarding the work.
The committee will meet every week dur
ing the progress of construction, with the
same object in view, and they see no rea
son why there should be any further
delay. .
Much of the delay was caused by a mis
understanding of the terms of the con
tract for clearing the site, several walls
underground having to be removed by
Contractor Raver after considerable dis
cussion and delay. There* is no longer
any excuse for hampering or postponing
the work any further. J Chairman Shee
han and Messrs. Britt and Rivers of the
Building Committee of tue Board of Su
pervisors are determined that the build
ing must be up within the time mentioned
in the contract, and for that reason they
have decided to hold the weekly meetings
to which reference has been made.
Dunbar alley and Merchant street will
rejo cc to-day over the dawn- of the new
era of returning . prosperity. ; They \ will
welcome the legions of drunks and bums
with open arms.' . V '
ANOTHER REVIEW WRIT.
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan to Show
Cause "Why It Should .Not Issue.
1 William Nicoll, by his attorney, W. A.
S. Nichol>on, has hied j a petition for re
view directed against Justice of the Peace
Kerrigan. . â ' J-
The petition sets forth that a suit was
begun by Nicoll against Catherine March
and that an attachment was issued by
Justice Kerrigan; that subsequently Mrs.
March demurred to the complaint with
out reservin the right to move to dissolve
tbe attachment; that at a later date she
entered the motion to dissolve, but the
plaintiff objected to hearing such motion
on the ground that Mrs. March had
waived and lost -that privilege by failing
to give notice of such intention when she
presented her demurrer. -/. '.',..
.Disregarding the protest, of Nicoll an
order was made by Justice Kerrigan dis
solving the attachm nt except as to $84.
Nicoll alleges that this was an error and
asks to have Justice Kerrigan's action re
viewed. Judge ; Bahrs of the . Superior
Court has ordered Justice Kerrigan to ap
pear on Friday, April 2, and show cause"
why the writ of review should not be
granted. Â".,'' . . - '

"Lows" fiscally first appear on the Washington

NEW YORK. N. V.. March 29.â depression
n the markets for securities in the closing days of
last week, consequent upon the Supreme Court
decision in the Trans-Missouri Freight Associa
tion case was increased to-day by news from the
West about ra;e-cnttlng and also by advices from
London and the Continent of a more warlike feel
ing. The bears had the upper hand and pushed
their advantage with vigor, being encouraged by
the receipt of numerous selling orders by commis
sion-bouses from Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago
and other cities, The decline in prices ranged I
from i/2 to 3% per cent, and as the down- 1
ward movement made prrgress " many stop
orders were executed. Missouri lac wasl
singled out for special attack on the reports cur- |
rent that the company had taken the initiative in
rate-cutting by making a reduction of the regular
schedule charges on eggs. Â« , -
This story afterward met with an emphatic de
nial by President George Gou'd, who also pro
nounced the rumors about a receivership for"the
company as being without the slightest founda
tion in fact Before the receipt of Mr. Gould's de
nial, however, Missouri Pacific had dropped % to
16% Other manor! declines developed in ihe
early trading were 20/ in Bock Island. % In Fur
lington and Quincy, 2% in North v. est, 1% In <v
Paul, 1% in Jersey Central, 1% in Lsnear, 3% in
American Spirits preferred, 2 1 â¢ Atchison, 1% la
tobacco, lVa in Omaha and 1% in New York
Central.
During tbe af ernoon in addition to denials con
cerning Missouri Pacific came the February state
ment of the Chicsgo, Burlington and Quincy,
which showed a b g Increase in surplus as com
pared with last year, and the advance of 1-16@V8
in certain grades of refined sugar. The advances
that followed were equal to 1% In Lake f-hore
aud 2% in American Spirits preferred, 1% in
New Jersey 1 entral and % to 1% 'In the re
mainder of the list. Near the close, however, the
grangers developed renewed weakness, but the re
mainder of the list held firm, and the improve
ment noted was well maintained. The grangers
closed with only fractional recoveries ana in the
case of Bock Island tbe final sales were at the
lowest of the day.

possessed of more activity than has been wit

weeks. The tone was firm, however, a ver/
gloomy view of the crop situation and of the pres

tending to inspire confidence in belter prices.
Light world's shipments, 3.723.000 bushels, a de
cline in English consols and a decrease ln the
amount on ocean passage of 400,000 bushels were
filming considerations. On the other band, heavy
Northwestern receipts 844 curs, against 3-Â»4 lan
Monday and 535 a year ago, and not particularly
strong Liverpool cab es, restrained buying enthu
siasm Chicago receipts were 14 cars, and 63,500
bushels were taken from store. Tue visible sup
ply decreased 1,407.000 bushels, the reduction
being larger than expected ana consequently help

Grlnbaum.A MYSTERY OF
SAN LEANDRO BAY
Nothing to Identify the
Well-Dressed Body Found
on the Beach.
A Stylish Young Man Whom It
Is Thought Committed
Suicide.
May Have Fallen Off the Narrow-
Gaure Train While Crossing
the Trestle.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, March Â£9. f
The inquest to-day at San Leandro failed
to solve the mystery surrounding the
young man wnosa body was washed upon
the beach some time within the past
month and found yesterday in a little
slough off San Leandro Bay.
Beyond the testimony regarding the
finding of the body nothing was brought
forward that wouid show how the unfor
tunate man came by his death or got
where it was found.
Everything indicates that it is the body
of a respectable young man about 30
'years of age. It was well dressed, and the
| character of the clothing shows that the
' young man must have been quite fashion
able. The remains were dressed in a
black diagonal Euit of good quality, and
dainty pointed sboes incased the feet.
Although deal several weeks, it was.,ap
parent that the body was that of a man of
dark complexion, of about 165 pounds in
weight and five feet eight inches in height.
The hat found near the body was a Derby
and the underclothing and necktie indi
cate that they belonged to some one of re
fined taste.
From the nature of the place where the"
body was found it is more than probable
that it drifted in from the bay. and the
fact that in none of the pockets was there
anything which might possibly lead to
identification suggests the idea of suicide,
probably from one of the ferry-boats, as
other bodies which were known "to be those
of people who jumped from the boats have
been found in the same portion of San
Leandro Bay.
The tides at present do not come within
seven or eight feet of where the body was
found, so that it must have been washed
ashore during the high tides of two weeks
ago.
There had not been any case reported
of any young man missing rom Oakland
during the past few weeks that would
seem to throw any li^bt on the identity of
the body, and inquiry with the San Fran
cisco Police Department does not show
that anybody of that description bas been
repotted as having disappeared. Owing
to the advanced state of decomposition
there is no possibility of identification
other than by the clothing, which will be
kept by the Coroner a reasonable length
of time. gaaÃj
There were no marks on the body that
would lead to the supposition of foul play.
The place where it was found is about two
blocks from the narrow-gauge, trestle
across that portion of the bay, and a
other fata! accidents have occurred of peo
ple ailing eft the platform of the train it
is just possible that the unfortunate young
fellow may have been on the train and
had fallen off at night.
The fact, however, that there was not a
single paper or marK on any of his cloth
ing that would lead to bis identity caused
the Coroner to believe that death was pre
meditated, because people in the walks of
life such as he belonged to do not gener
ally go around without something upon
them that would disclose their identity in
some manner or other.
OHUEOH GETS EVEN.
Retaliate* on Hoeth by Removing a
Hospital Matron.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â Sup
erv.sors had another lively meeting to
day and started to make more changes in
the patronage at their disposal. The first
matter that came up was the resolution of
Mr. Roeih to have the fact put on the
â¢ minutes that at tbe last meeting Mr.
Church had called him numerous kinds of
a liar. He was making an argument in
favor of bis position in the matter, when
Supervisor Wells proposed that the
minutes be approved as read. The motion
prevailed and Mr. Roeth's desire will not
be gratified. He asked that Mr. Church
apologize, but Mr. Church refused to do so
unless Roeth would state that the pub
lished interview credited to Roeth, which
caused the trouble, was false.
' Roeth stated it was wrong and Church
.wanted the interview and Mr. Roeth's
statement also included in the minutes,
but this matter did not prevail, and tbe
incident passed. Later on, however, Mr.
Roeth was greatly surprised when a reso
lution was introduced relieving Mrs. A.
M. Bennett of her duties as matron of the
Receiving Ho pttaland appointing Hattie
McDonald to tne place.
Roeth demanded to know the reason,
but one was not given and the significant
resolution was passed.
This action has caused a great deal of
\ unrest among the employes of the county.
VWhen tbe new board took office Roeth
' vas in a position to dictate, and be took
full advantage of it. At the very first
meeting he attempted to change every
person in the employ of the Supervisors.
He was able to carry out his plans,, but
now the complexion of the board has
changed and Mr. Roeth is in the minor
ity, and the action of this morning seems
to indicate that the removal of Mrs. Ben
nett Is but tbe beginning of another clean
sweep.
A committee from the Board of Trade
appeared at the meeting and made an ar
gument that only one bridge be built
across the estuary instead of two as at
present.
TOO MANY FAMILIES.
Why a Society Wants the Custody of
the Children.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29. â The
guardianship of the two children of the
Robinsons of West Oakland, which came
up tbis morning before Judge Ogden, re
vealed a peculiar story of the matrimonial
affairs of Tony Brisino.
Brisino formerly lived in San Francisco,
but is now a West Oakland painter. In
San Francisco he separated from a wife
with some children. In Oakland be lives
with a young woman by whom he had
two children, and it was only recently
that their acquaintances discovered that
they were not married. More recently
still Brisino went to: San Francisco with
the wife of another man and succeeded in
obtaining the custody of his oldest daugh
ter by his first wife from the Home of the
Friendless, where she was being main
tained by her mother.
â¢ When Mrs. Brisino No. 1 found out what
had been done she at once started .to
search for her daughter May. She was
found in Oakland doing the housework for
a Mrs. Robinson, who is a friend ot Bri-
Blno's.';Mrs. Prescott, secretary of ; the
Children's Society, was at once notified of
the circumstances, and took charge of
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
May. who is a lovely girl 14 years of age.
Brisino has been constantly trying to re
gain tbe girl, who has been sent into the
country pending the trouble, and Mrs.
Robinson has just at", lied for a divorce
from her husband. The Robinson chil
dren i-ave been placed in the Teraescal
Home, and Mrs. Prescott will be appointed
guardian of the children of Brisinos
and the Robinsons.
HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW.
William Schwarz in Jail, Though His
Wire I, Wealthy.
OAKLAND, Cal., Match 29.â William
Schwarz, who married Carmen Peralta of
the historic family ;of that name, was
found guilty this morning of disturbing
the peace of his mother-in-law, Mrs. V. T.
Yescas. j/-y
Some time ago Mrs. Schwarz inherited
an estate valued at about $50,000, and ns
she is of a simple disposition, unable to
read or write, and it was shown that her
husband was not managing it solely in
her interest, Major Bromley was appointed
her guardian. Schwarz and his n:ottier
in-law had a row, because he was deposed
as his wile's guardian through the influ
ence of her mother.
The testimony to-day showed that
Scnwarz had forced his way into the
Yescas home on Webster street and ap
plied unbecoming language to his mother
in-law. He will be sentenced to-morrow,
but although his wife is wealthy he has
been unable to secure bail.
ALAMEDA CITY TRUSTEES.
Protest Against a Street Improvement. |
Introduction of Ordinances.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â The pro
test received to-night by the City Trustees j
from the trustees of the Sather estate was i
MRS. STECKMEYER and the Younger Half of the Family That the Police Now Guard.
found to represent more than a majority j
of the frontage affected and sufficient to
stop for six months the proposed improve
ment of Santa Clara" avenue, 1095 feet west
from High street, through the Indian j
shell mound. Some question was ad- !
vanced whether the jurisdiction of tbe â¢
board would not be lost after the end of |
the six months by a claim that the land |
sought to be improved is private property, j
The City Attorney replied that such a I
contention would not affect the result of i
the case. The street in question at the
point named has been dedicated to public ]
useâ has, in fact, been in use as suchâ and !
there has been an actual delivery of the
deeds.
An ordinance was introduced to permit
of the discharge of fire arms ou Bay Farm
I Island between the Ist ot February and
the Ist of June to protect seed and crops
against larks and other destructive birds.
Another ordinance introduced proposes
to raise the salary of the City Assessor
from $65 to $80 a month, the assessor be
ing the lowest salaried officer in Alameda.
Labor Exchange.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â The Board
of Directors of the Labor Exchange re
cently organized in this city have decided
to establish a depository at . once where
mem can leave such articles as they
had for sale, receiving exchange checks in '
return therefor. A number of the mem
bers have offered to deposit coin and take
checks for the purpose of putting them in
circulation and givingtheexchange a start.
A place has" been obtained, rent free at 1422
Park street, to be used as a depository,
and it is expected that in a short time the
exchange will bein full working order.
The Water Carnival.
ALAMEDA/ Cal., March 29.â The pro
pose! water carnival, in connection with
the Fourth of July celebration, is receiv
ing.some attention in this city, but has
not yet come to a head. If there were any
organization to take hold of the affair
doubtless'it could be made a success. Tbe
tidal canal is an ideal location for an
event of tbis kind, while the big draw
bridge, wonld lend itself admirably to
decorative purposes. So far, however, no
one has been found to take the matter
actively in hand.
Notes.
An incipient fire was extinguished by Officer
Schoenau in Wiihelmi's coal nnd wood yard
about midnight last night. As a high wind
was blowing, the discovery was made in the
nick of time, otherwise a disastrous conflagra
i tion would probably have resulted.
Some little damage was done about town by
the high gale of yesterday, trees being up
rooted, yachts set adrift, etc.
Chinese have dug a pitfall in the shape of a
ditch across a footpath crossing some property
leased by them at Encinal and Park avenues,
in order to prevent people from using the
thoroughfare, and late last night a lady hurry
ing from a train fell Into the hole and nar
rowly escaped serious injury. As it was, she
was badly bruised and thaken up.
The regatta of the Alameda Boating Club

No More Frittering of linn..
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29 âThe new
bill just signed by Governor Budd making
it necessary for every resolution appropri
ating more than $100 by a City Council to
go to the Mayor has. a peculiar applica
tion ;to Oakland. In this city when the
policy of tbe Mayor and Council hat dif
fered regarding any large expenditure the
Council has taken advantage of its power
to expend any sum under $500 independ
ent of the Mayor's approval. Large ratal
of money have been frittered away on $549
resolutions, and one of the greatest objec
tions Mayor Davie had to the actions of
the present Council was this practice, and
to his exertions was partly due the passage
of the bill through the House. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1897.
SAYS HER HUSBAND
IS OUT TO KILL
A Mother and Eight Little
Ones Protected by
Police.
While a Young Woman She
Married a "Rich"
Rancher.
His Riches Consisted of a Mortgage
and a Jealous Temper that Im
pels Him to Lunacy
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,?.
90S Broadway, March 29. )
An industrious, hard-working woman
stricken with terror applied to the police
to-day for protection. She declared that
she is frightened her aged husband will
return and carry out his threats to kill
her and her, young children, of whom
there are eight.
The cause of the old man's threat is
jealousy, and it is based on the fact that
he is an old man considerably over 60,
while his wife is hot much more than half
his age. j He was well along in years when
be married the young girl, and although
quite a large family has come to them
they have not been altogether happy, and
recently there has been open war.
To Chief Lloyd Mrs. Steckmeyer of 221
Second street told a story of misery and
fear. Some years ago she came to this:
country a young and comely German
maiden. Sbe met Gotlieb Steckmeyer
and be proceeded at once to make Jove to
her. He told her that he was a wealthy
rancher and that in addition to valuable
property in Napa County he also had con
siderable ready cash. She finally accepted
him as her husband and a speedy mar
riage followed.
Immediately after the wedding day she
saw that she had been deceived. The
ranch in Napa County pioved to be a small
vineyard hardly so large as the mortcace
upon it. She worked hard in order to help
her husband make a. livelihood for their
family, and she says that Steckmeyer not
only refused to do any work himself, but
continually accused her of being unfaith
ful.
Not long since the mortgage was fore
closed, and with her children tbe unhappy
woman came to Oakland, where she has
been making a living by taking in wash
ing. Steckmeyer came here about two
months ago and abused the little woman
in many ways. She declares that he
.slapped her and made threats to gill her
and her family, and brandished a knife to
give weight to his words. Recently she
has received letters from bim which have
not helped to make her feel less fright
ened, as they contain many suggestive
threats. ,â  * " ' r
"This is not the first time he has tried
to kill me," said Mrs. steckmeyer. "When
we were living in Napa County he fre
quently had spells of insane jealousy and
threatened to cut my throat and kill all
the children. The three oldest children
and I had to disarm him several times.
At such times he foamed at the mouth
with rage. He has no reason to be jealous
of me, and bis actions are both absurd
and crazy. He says he is coming to Oak
land and will kill me and all the family,
and I know if he once gels inside the
house that he will carry out his threat."
Chief Lloyd has detailed an officer to
keep constant surveillance over the cot
tage where the unhappy family live.

been nearly every spring, upon Â» the business
of the Enquirer. He goes direct to New York

Complication of Heirs.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â trou
bles of 'a ; com plicated > family ; were pre
sented to Judge . Ogden ; to-day, when the
estate of Charlotte Schweiss came up for
distribution. As it was the separate prop
erty of the deceased; the; husband was' en
titled to one-half tbe' estate, and. the heirs
to the other half. . The heirs are brothers
and Bisters of the decedent, who was a
daughter of Henry Waass, a German mer
chant, who became the father of half a
dozen children by a domestic in his em
ploy, while he was Hying with nis wife in
Germany. Waass married the domestic
eventually, and acknowledged all the chil
dren. Attorney Phil M. Walsh, who rep
resented the heirs, claimed that the chil
dren were legitimized by the marriage of
their father and mother, and Judge Ogden
shared this opinion. One of the sons is a
prominent business man in San Francisco,
and final distribution has been continued
pending adjustment.

winner in the contest at the State "Uni
versity for the best criticism on Professor
Louis" Dv Pont Syle's new play, "The
Chaplain's Revenge,'' and Miss E. R.
Farnham '97 was a close .second to Miss
Barto, in the opinion of Professor A. F.
Lange, who made the award, and in his
communication concerning the decision
he says tbat both together give a more just
impression than either one alone. The
prize is at $20, and was offered by a friend

Thieves at Work. .
BERKELEY, Cal., March 29.â About
dayiight this morning, thieves broke into
the Goodrich house on D wight way, and
would doubtless haye made away with a
quantity of the vast.store of valuables and
curios to be found in the residence had it
not been that they were frightened away
by the old couple who are carine for the
house during the absence of. the Goodrich
family in Europe. Their, entrance was
gained through a rear window by means
of an ordinary pick, the handle of which
was â  found later in '; the j day. : â  The ;foot
prints aoout the building are small, indi
cating that a man of small stature or a
boy was the thief.

FAVORITES IN
WINNING FORM
Four Heavily Played Firs
Choices Cross the Line
at Ingleside.
Greyhurst Was Left at the Post
arid Damien Then Won
Easily.
R. J. vey Re-engaged as S'.arter.
Michael Quite a Shifty Youngster.
Horatio Won -Driving.
The attendance at Ingleside yesterday
was only fair, and there was a noticeable
slackness about tbe betting in the ring.
The track was in good condition, though
a trifle deep, and a strong breeze pre
cluded of any fast time being accom
plished.
The buyers of odds did not enjoy a very
profitable afternoon's sport, as four out of
six heavily played favorites caught the
eye of the judges first.
Mr. Allen's starting was very good with
the exception of the third race, in which
he was unfortunate in leaving the heavily
played second choice, Greyhurst, at the
place. This caused a deal of dissatisfac
tion among spectators, as a result of
wbicli the association has again engaged
the services of the popular starter, R. J.
Havey, who will handle the gate to-day.
The last two races of Pat Dunne's good
horse Damien evidently keyed him right
up on edge, for it would have taken a good
one to have downed him yesterday. He
was backed down â¢ from 8 to 5 to 11 to 10,
and took the third event, over a nine,
from Good Times in a gallop. Honest
going David, with 121 "pounds in the
saddle, was third.
Michael, a big chestnut colt, by imp.
Islington, proved the best of tne sixteen
maiden two-year-olds. He went to the
post at odds of 5 to 1, and won very im
pressively from Imoerious, the 3 to 1
favorite. Front deÃoeuf was a good third.
With the dangerous one scratched out
of the second event, a six-furlong selling
sprint, Duuboy, witn Skeets Martin in
the saddle, was backed to even money at
post time. Sweet William, the second
choice, led until well into the stretch,
where he began dying away, and tbe fa
vorite won without effort in 1:16 Rus
sella came last at the end, taking the
show.
Atkins & Lottridge gathered in a purse
very handily with their horse Double
quick, whicn now shows excellent form.
He was backed down by the big coin from
6 to 5 to 7 to 10 to win the mile and a six
teenth selling affair that was fourth on the
card, and taking the lead at the turn had
only to gallop to beat Benamela out in
I:slJ^. Can't Cance finished in the show.
Wih Yankee Doodle and 'Salvation
scratched from the mile purse race next
decided, Preston, with three very ordinary
ones to beat, was a prohibitive 2 to 9 favor
ite in tbe betting. Ho headed Coda and
Wyoming into the stretcn, and in one of
Willie Martin's finely drawn finishes won
easily by a bead in I:43*Â£. Imp. Trance,
poorly ridden, was third. .;
The final race was a five-furlong scram
ble with the weights raised twenty pounds
1 above the scale. It was one of tiie best
contested events of the day, as a furlong
from home, with five of the starters fight
ing it out beads apart, tbe result was prob
lematical. At the wire Snider, on Hora
tio, the second choice, was first by a neck,
with old Logan second, a head in front of
Tempestuous. The Bto 5 choice, The Sin
ner, was in front as the stretch was
reached, but could not last it out. ,
NOTES?
Entertaining an idea that possibly the
betting on the fourth race was a trifle
speckled, Presiding Judge Rees informed
the owner of Benamela that he would ex
pect to see the brown horse run a good
race, or in future his entry would not be
desirable. He was never able to extend

OFPIGIALS TAKE HOLD.
Onkland Passes Quietly From the Old
Administration, to the New.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 29.â The new
city | officials, with ths exception of the
Mayor, assumed their duties to-night.
The old Councilmen introduced their
successors, and they at once proceeded to
the election of a president. The first vote
was: W. Pringle, 8; W. Heitmann, L
Pringle was escorted to the chair and
made a brief speech. The nsw president
is but 25 years of age and is the son of E.
J. \Pringle, the well-known attorney of
East Oakland. ~ â â¢.-- - - -..â â >'â¢â 
The election of City Clerk was the next
business, and Major Tompkins, the pres
ent clerk, and Will Hawkett were nomi
nated. Tompkins got all the votes but
one (Girard voting for Hawkett) and he
was declared elected. Ed Holland was
also re-elected assistant City Clerk. The
re-election of these gentlemen is well
deserved. Both have worked faithfully
and courteously during the past two
years and the work of the office has been
as near faultless as possible.
Mayor-elect Thomas was present, but as
Mayor Davie says that his term is not up
till April 1 Captain Thomas will not enter
the office till that time.
The new Board of Education also took
office to-nig it. J. A. Britton, who was
elected a school director, caused some sur
prise by stating that be had not qualified
because he is unable to do so. He ex

THE TICKET MUDDLE.
City Attorney Taylor's Opinion on thÂ©
Matter He Waxes Facetious Over
"" the Clerk's Quandary.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 29.â 1n order
to settle the ballot muddle, City Clerk
Lamborn referred the whole matter to the
City Attorney, E. K. Taylor, and that
gentleman ' to-day gave his opinion, in
which he said that no legal convention
nominations had been made, and that the
mass-meeting at Harmonic Hall was not
an assemblage of delegates. He added in
a vein of humor: J\
While it is your duty to make un the ballot
from your rccora, you are not required to in
clude in your record of certificates documents
which you know are false. The verified cer
tificate of the Harmonic Ball rasas-meeting
reads: "That said convention was a duly
called and organized assemblage of delegates
duly elected thereto." For Harmonic's sake
we will call this prevarication. The Penal
Code designates It with less politeness, and
irom certain sections it appears that all who
are parties to the making or films; of an in
correct certificate areâ naughty. :â â¢â â .>
From the law and facts it manifestly appears
thai the N. P. certificate is N.G. You have
therefore no legal right to place the designa
tion "Non-Partisan" after any name, except
ing those of K. G. Wheeler and B. F. Lamborn.
Mr. Taylor waxes funnier as he goes on.
Of course if the general non-partisan cer
tificate had not been on file you could not
have used that designation, and my request
was based on the lact tnat the certificate was
entitled to recognition until declared Illegal,
and T purposely refrained from so declaring
because lt would be in bad taste for me to
throw out the certificate of the "convention"
which threw me out. But now It tastes badly
anyway.. This threatening business .is so
small it would make a good microscopic
slide. . Â» * Â»
Vitiating error must te something which
would affect the final result Therefore, if
you leave the sample ballots as it is and print
the oflicial ticket like it, you will In no way
invalidate the election. You may have
troubles of your own and possibly have to
print another ticket, but as this has been the
driest and leanest campaign our printers ever
knew, you should rejoice at the prospect of
being able to help them out of your privy
purse. rj/r-J.y>'yJ.:, -..â  .
City Clerk Lamborn says he will follow
the attorney's advice, and so the question
may bs considered settled so far as the
preparation of the tickets is concerned.
Whether any candidate will raise tire
question after the election remains to be
seen, but to do so would not be in accord
with popular sentiment.
HURLED FROM A CAPSTAN.
Miraculous Escape of C. A. Km lay
From the Consequences of a
Peculiar Accident.
OAKLAND, Cal., March During
the gale of yesterday C. A. Emlay, the
bridge-tender of the Webster-street draw,
had a miraculous .escape from being
crushed to death.
Emlay. opened the bridge to allow a
schooner to pass through. The gale was
blowing fiercely, and as soon as the bridge
was released from its moorings it needed
no capstan to help around. '":/'â /:
Emlay went to the capstan as usual, but
as soon as the bridge felt the wind it flew
; around at a rapid pace. The capstan re
volved like a top and Emlay, after being
carried around several times, was finally
thrown a distance of thirty- five feet along
the bridge. He landed on the roadway
I and was picked up with a sprained ankle
and a small blood vessel broken. He re
vives rapidly.
It was nothing short of a, miracle that
he should be hurled along the bridge and
not touch any of ; the ironwork, as the
chances are about one in ten for escaping
under tbe peculiar circumstances without
being dashed to death.
CRACKING OF RIFLES.

nia Schuetzen Club's Park at

offered for competition on the ring target.
The prizes are so numerous for the honor

on Sunday morning next for Tiburon,
where they will take passage on the cars
for the shooting grounds. The rifles will
commence barking immediately upon the
arrival of the marksmen at the park, and
there will be no let up to the "smoke of

sweet home," when the sun goes down
behind old Tarnalpais. ', '/J/y

festival the Schuetzen Schuemann

park , by holding a grand picnic on the
ground?. - There will be vocal and instru
mental music and bowling for cash prizes.
A grand - day's , outing ; will certainly .be
enjoyed by ali participants. ;

WELLS STILL
THE CYCLE KING
He Left McFarland, Down
ing and Jones Lengths
Behind Him.
Stevens of lowa Took the Three-
Mile Event From a
Speedy Field.
A Big Crowd Attended the Opening
Night of the Second Week of
tte Cycle Tournament.
The cycle races at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion last nigbt drew a largo house â
larger than was expected for a Monday
nightâ and certainly the high quality of
the sport furnished warranted the people
in going.
The second week of the big indoor tour
nament opened auspiciously. There were
two good professional events on the card,
each necessitating six preliminary heats
and three semi-finals before the starters in
the final heats could be determined.
These made seventeen actual races, be
sides the usual record trials, comprising a
long and interesting programme.
The best race of the evening, ana judced
by many to be the best yet seen at the
tournament, was the final of the mile
open, which was won by Wells, with lots
of space separating him from McFarland,
Downing and Jones, It was a very popu
lar victory.
Ten men Qualified in the five prelim
inary heats of the mile open, professional.
They were McFarland, Dow, "Bob" Terrill,
Downing, Wells, Sullivan, Jones, Morris,
Stevens and Davis.
They were required to ride in three
semi-finals, winners and fastest second to
qualify for the final. The field was men
reduced to McFarland, Weils and Jones,
who won their heats, and Downing, who
was second in the fastest heat, 2:17.
In the third semi-final Jones was lead
ing, Steven?, Sullivan and Davis follow
ing. This was the order as they rounded
the last turn. Stevens ran into Jones'
rear wheel and fell. Sullivan rode com
pletely over him ana also went down.
Davis rounded the wreck and finished
second. Fortunately neither Stevens nor
Sullivan was more than scratched.
The line-up at the tape for the final was
McFarland. Jones, Wells and Downing.
It was paced by Morris on a single. Jones
was first to catch him., but Downing rode
around him and dropped back, and the
order was Downing, Jones, McFarland,
Wells. McFarland started his usual early
sprint, but tbe others would not be left
behind, and there then ensued one of the
prettiest finishes of the tournament.
Wells, from last position, forged aheadjby
a magnificent sprint, and once in the
lead tne race was bis, as he gained at
every stride, finishing fully ten lengths
abead of McFarland, who ran second, a
length in front of Downing. The time
was 2:11. Wells received a splendid re
ception as he dismounted.
The three-mile race was a beautiful con
test. After four preliminary heats had
been run, to cut down the field, the
starters in the final were Stevens of lowa.
McFarland and Downing of San Jose, and
"King" Eaton of Chicago.
Morris was put iv io pace, and Downing
was the first to catch on behind him.
Stevens was second, Eaton third, McFar
land fourth. McFarland rode up along
side Stevens, and the latter allowed him
to drop into second place.
Sullivan took the pace on the second
mile, and the order behind him remained
unchanged, the men evidently preferring
to . save themselves for the final sprint
rather than fight for positions.
When the bell lap came Eaton had at
tained tho lead, but Stevens went by him
on the outside and held first place to the
finish, Eaton a close second. McFarland
passed DowDine and got third. Ttie time
by mile was 2:25 2-5. 4:42 1-5 and 6:54 1-5.
J. R. Kenna of the Bay City Wheeimen
gave a pretty exhibition in a mile record
trial, paced by the Griffiths- Davidson and
Hall-Kraft tandem teams. The former
team carried him the last half and ran
away from him on the last lap, but he still
made it in 1:59 1-5, a world's record. Had
he been able to hold the tandem all the
way this time would probably have been
cut three seconds lower.
C. M. Smith and W. S. Bacon of the
Olympic Cyclers rode a half-mile exhibi
tion on a tandem, the time being :59 1-5
secondsâ above the record. *
The following is the summary:

ol the mile open with Sullivan Foster could
do no better than third.
Stevens has the reputation of. being the
quickest starter on the track.' When there is
a tandem to be caught he always gets there
first. .
Supervisors Devany and Sheehan, both en
thusiastic wheelmen, occupied one of the
boxes. yJJ'/JJj ; J J
Harlow H. White . was the referee of the
evening, and his. rulings gave universal satis
faction.
Sullivan slid fully fifteen feet when he fell
in the mile open, hut ilus boards of tne track
are so smooth he suffered hardly a scratch.
Professor Baisden performed a new trick in
his exhibition last night, riding around the
curves of the track while standing erect on
his wheel. It was very cleverly done and won
him deserved applause.
In the mile open, final. Wells rode the last
half ln 09 seconds, world's record time.
In the third heat of the three-mile race a
dog which had escaped from its owner ran
across the track as the men were racing down
the backstrelch and threw Foster. It was
hard luck for Walter, as he seemed to have
the heat well in hand.
Loughead, the Canadian, is not yet up to a
race. He again occupied a seat 111 the grand
stand with some indies.
Wells and Loughead are going East next
Monday night and Eaton and some of the
other Eastern flyers now here may go the same
time. Stevens, McFarland. the Terrills and
others expect to ride on the National circuit
this season. _^^_____________
CHINESE DEPORTATIONS.
The first Case of Â» Series Was Begun
Yesterday.
The case of Leung Ab Funsr, one of the
Chinese girls up for deportation, waa
partly heard by ConVmiiÂ«ioner Heacoct
yesterday, but Attorney Dibble had the
case postponed until to-day.
A Chinese inspector ami two Chinese
women identified the girl as one who came
from .South America, though she claimed
she was born in San Francisco.
WORKING PINGREE'S PLAN
A Tract of . Land in the City
Has Been Secured as a
Starter.
There the Unemployed May Be
Taught Pract.cally How to
Farm.
Major Winchell, chief of the social de
partment of the Salvation Army, is rap
idly perfecting his plans for carrying out
the colonization scheme of the Salvation
Army.
Mrs. D. M. Morey has offered him a
small tract of land at Colma, on the line
of the San Mateo electric line, which, if he
finds upon examination that it serves the
purpose, he will turn into an agricultural
school, so to speak.
"To get men down upon the land, with
instructions to dig their sustenance out of
the earth, is good in theory, Out in prac
tice it is expecting a good deal'of them if
they have never tried their hand at it be
fore," said Major Winchell yes'erday.
"Pingree's plan contemplated a little in
struction in the art of tilling the soil, and
that is what we propose to do. I think we
will have no difficulty in getting land,
both in and out of the City, and on most
favorable terras. '
"This at Colma is easily accessible by
electric car from the City. There is a
house there and everything in shape to
go to work. We will put applicants for
land there first and see what they can do
with it, or teach them what to do with it,
before we send them into the country."
Speaking of his woodchoppers' camp,
the major said: "It is succeeding
famously. We have now about twenty
men at the place. They are working
hard and are perfectly contented.
"We issue certificates ot the work done,
which certificates are good at the com
missary when we get that institution
going. They pay us 40 cents a day for
board, and are enabled to save about $1 30
a day. The problem just now with us is
to provide the necessaries pending the
time when we sell the wood. The men
insist upon the market price at tbe time
of sale â $3 a cordâ and will not sell for
less. They pay us tbe 40 cents a day in
wood, remember, not in money. We will
have :o sell it at a reduced juice, perhaps,
in order to purchase edibles."
IMPORTANT TAX SUIT.
Another Itig Claim Filed by a Banking
Institution Against the City
and County.
An action at law las been commenced
by the San Francisco Savings . Union
against the City and County ot San Fran
cisco for the collection of $31,375 78, al
leged to be due for taxes paid under pro
test.,
The claim of the plaintiff is based on
the alleged error of Assessor Siebe in de
manding the payment of taxes on per
sonal property said to be outside the State
of California on the day the assessment
was levied. The bank's officers set up
tbat it is not material, so far as the As
sessor is concerned, where the property is
owned; that he has no authority to assess
it unless it is in his district on the first
Monday in March.
Assessor teiebe held a contrary opinion
and levied the assessment in accordance
with his information touching the owner
ship of the personal property. He believed
that under the law the money oueht to be
taxed here because it is actually owned
here, though actually outside the State on
the first Monday in March. JJ/:/J
In order to avoid the penalty for delin
quency the officers of the bank paid the
taxes under protest and brought suit for
recoveiy as allowed by law.
A dozen suits of this character are now
pending against the City and County of
San Francisco, involving more than half
a million dollars, and the importance of
the litigation has led City Counselor
Creswell to devote great care to the worK
of preparing for the trial of. the questions
involved. The matter has not yet been
adjudicated in this City, but tome of the
cases will be heard soon. In view of the
ereat interests at stake, tho Supreme Court
will, of course, be called . upou to finally
settle the dispute. If the City should fail
in the litigation it would be a serious loss
to the public revenues, and ultimately
would have the effect of greatly increasing
the rate of the tax levy.
LAND DEAL COMMISSIONS.
li. _ i.oomis Wants George W. Phelps j
to Pay Something Like $10,000.
B. E. Loomis has sued George W. Phelps
for an accounting aud a settlement of fees
said to be due on account of certain real
estate transactions in the city of Stockton.
The complaint alleges that Phelps em
ployed George W. Hopkins to sell a tract
of land; that Hopkins handled the prop
erty and secured purchasers, thereby
earning his fees; that Hopkins assigned
his interest In ' said fees' to Loomis for
$10,0C0, and that Phelps refused to pay
any part of the money due or to give an
accounting. Judgment is asked to com
pel tne defendant to. show up his books,
so that the amount of Hopkins' commis
sions may be ascertained and that Phelps
be compelled to pay the same. Pending
the hearing an injunction has been grant
ed by the Superior Court restraining
Phelps from doing anything that might
impair the rights of the plaintiff in the
premises.
Dickey Sentenced.
S. R. Dickey, who pleaded guilty to sweating
gold coins, was : sentenced by Judge Morrow
yesterday. He was given eighteen months on
each of five counts and fined $500. .

The Judge Will Not Tarry

Waymire Before Appointing
a Circuit Judge.

Placesâ Congressman Loud May Re

Judge Waymire, who left his home in
Alameda for Washington last Saturday
evening, will not tarry on his way to the
National Capital. He wants to get there
witliout delay, as Mark Hanna wired him
to come. It has been telegraphed from
Washington that the Judge was not sum
moned by those in authority, but such is
not the fact. He has documentary evi
dence to prove that his presence was
sought.
Judge Waymire may not be appointed
United States Circuit Judge to succeed
Mr. McKenna, but he will be asked to
give his opinion about the distribution of
party patronage in California. Judge
Morrow may get, the coveted Circuit
Judgeship or Judge de Haven may get the
place. It is thought, however, that the
President will talk the matter over with
Judge Waymire before any appointment
is made.
While It has been wired from Washing
ton that the delegation from California
had agreed upon Colonel J. P. Jackson for
Collector of the Port, there are many here
who insist that Joseph Spear will get that
position and that Jackson will do as he
did eicrht years ago accept the office of

Secretary John G. Searles of the American Refining Company.
John G. Searles ol Brooklyn, N. V., secretary of the American Refining Company, or
sugar trust, about which there has recently been a great deal In tne dispatches, enjoyed
himself for a part of the time yesterday in looking about the City and then attended to
some business he had in hand. Mr. Searles- is accompanied by Mrs. Searles. Miss Searles,
Mr. and Mrs. M. B. Chapman, Miss Chapman and A. J. Oxenheim, his private secretary. ,
Mr. Searles is a rather tall man of good weight and wearing a full beard, with the ex
ception of the mustache. The beard reaches a pretty good length and is getting rather
gray. Mr. Searles wears spectacles, but- they are not gold-bowed. He wears also a black
Prince Albert coat, which he keeps well buttoned. Altogether, the secretary, about whom
so much has been said,' looks much like a deacon in a prosperous church. -
He is pleasant to meet, but not much inclined to go into an interview. When he did
he came to the point without any superfluous words. ! â.
"I came out here," he \ said, "to attend the meeting of the directors of the Western
Sugar Refining Company. They held their meeting here to-day. I was present, and that's
about all there is to say concerning that,, I will also, while; l- am here, see the City, and
may visit some other parts of the State. g I came over ths Central' Pacific by way of Denver
and brought several friends along. We will remain here a few days.

HE SIAD SHE
WAS A FLIRT
It L*d to Serious Trouble
on Eighteenth
Street.
Peter Leonard Severely Beaten
by Jerry Lynch and His
Relatives.
Leonard Was Arrested and Discharged
Yesterday, and Now the Others
Will Ec Arrested. . jj:;
Peter Leonard and. Jerry Lynch are
neighbors on Eighteenth street, the for
mer living at 4220 and the latter at 4227.
Nothing disturbed the serenity of their
lives until a few weeks ago, when Leonard
heard that Lynch had been saying that
his wife was a flirt. Leonard spoke to
Lynch about it, and Lynch told him he
had said so, but be wanted to know why
Leonard had called his wife a flirt.'
Honors were even, and they decided to
maKe a quiet investigation. It resulted in
each acknowledging that he had no foun
dation for the charge.
Leonard thoucht this mutual acknowl- I
edgment settled the business, but Lynch
apparently was of a different opinion, as
the sequel proved. \ â 
Last Friday evening .Leonard's doorbell
rane, and on opening the door he was
confronted , by Lynch, who had with him
Mrs. Mary Lynch, his wife, James Lynch;
his brother, J.. Granville, his father-in
law, and M. Granville, his brother-in-law.
Thinking it: was a friendly call Leonard
invited them to come in, but he was very
much surprised when Lynch knocked him
down, and, assisted by 'the others, gave
him a terrific beating. To defend him
self Leonard drew a pocket-knife and cut
Jerry Lynch on the right arm. /
v, After hostilities had ceased Leonard
went to the Seventeenth-street station
and asked for the arrest of his assailants.
While telling his story Policeman J. J.
Kern, who had heard of the row, made his
appearance, and placed Leonard under ar
rest on the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon for cutting Lynch on the arm. *
Leonard appeared belore acting Police
Judge Carroll yesterday morning and was
defended by /Attorney *T. F. Graham.
After hearing the evidence the /Judge
promptly dismissed the case, remarking"
that Leonard was justified in using the
knife to defend himself and that -Lynch
should have been in the dock instead of
Leonard. i' ;:â¢,;' , Â - .
Leonard immediately swore out - com
plaints charging Jerry Lynch, Mr?. Mary
Lynch. James Lynch, J. Granville and If.
Granville j with battery, and the - Judge
will? have an opportunity of again listen
ing to tbe story of the troubles of the
Leonard and Lynch families.

PURE 10 OD 00NGEESS.
Letter* Sent to County Supervisor* Ask
'J.JjJ. ing for Co-Operation. J
Isidor Jacobs, chairman of the invita
tion committee of the Pure Food Congress,
bas sent the following communication to
the Boards of Supervisors of all the coun
ties in the State:
Gentlemen: A Pure Food Congress will be
held at the hall of the Chamber of Commerce,
California street, in San Francisco, at 10 a. _Â
on the 30th day of April, 1897. < ,
The question of pure food in California being
of far-reaching importance as effectine, not
only the health ot our people, but tne standard
and demand .'or our products, has enlisted the
attention and energies of the Manufacturers'
aud Producers' Association now for more than
a year. This organization finds, however, tnat
in prosecuting the work against the adultera
tion of foods aua dealers in adulterated foods
in San Francisco it is simply driving these
products into the Interior, aud it has become
convinced that in order to make the move ef
fective it roust be State wide. Hence, the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association, in
conjunction with a strong committee from the
Council of Associated Industries, have re
solved upon the proposed Pure Food State Con
gress and desire that all portions of the State
shall be strongly and ably represented in the
â aid congress.
We therefore appeal to your honorable body
to appoint from your ablest and most public
spirited citizens at least ten delegates to this
congress, and in the selection we beg you to
try to name those who you believe will
attend. We want to make this, if possible, the
event of the year. We would like to see it the
createst convention ever held in California.
It should be so large and representative in
character, and positive and practical in action,
as to startle those that arc contending against
us ln this contest for pure foods, good Health
and the lame and good name of California.
We trust we shall have your hearty co
operation in this matter, and that through
you your county will be fully and ably repre
sented. Asking you to notify us of your
appointments, we remain, for the bodies above
named, yours very truly, .
