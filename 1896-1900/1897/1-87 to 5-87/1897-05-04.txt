â Â£;-.; Part of Leaders Reach

CONSTANTINE SAID TO HAVE
DESERTED THE WOUNDED.
â¢Although All Hope of Vanquishing the
: Turks Is Gone, the Hellenes Desire
One Great Battle to Vindicate
Their Honor.
â¢[Copyrighted 1897 by the New York Bm.]
LONDON, Eng., May aâ lt seems al- ,
' most useless, according to dispatches from ;
a great variety of sources, to expect any
effective rally of the Greek forces. The !
fighting spirit of the rank and file re- 1
mains, but lack of competent leadership j
continues to nullify every advantage, j
. The rage of the common people revives as
the details of the ignominious failure of â 
the Greek campaign in Thessaly become
known. This rage is not long to remain j
impotent. According to latest news from '
- Athens it is chiefly directed against the j
' "royal family, especially the Crown Prince,
who was never popular and is now de
tested.
Refugees from Larissa, describing the !
conduct of the Crown Prince's retinue I
when the city was evacuated, say they â 
â¢ filled the whole train witb the Prince's ,
â¢ baggage, including supplies fit for a gour- â 
mand, consisting of live d-tcks and all
â¢'. sorts of delicacies, while hundreds of
. wounded soldiers were left to their fate.
- : It Is impossible to verify such stones, but 1
â¢ ihv Englisa correspondents do not ques- â 
tion their truth. The effect upon the ex
asperated population st Athens can be !
â¢ â  easily imagined.
. A definite announcement of the policy â 
of the Ralli Ministry is momentarily ex- 1
: -!pected. It is beginning to be seen even j
in Athens that all bopes of a successful I
,' resistance of the Turks is gone. It is the |
' intense desire, however, to retrieve the
disgrace that has fallen upon the nation,
canted by the cowardly leadership which j
made possible the panic during the retreat j
from Larissa.
Patriotic Greeks, including a large sec- i
... tlon of the army, demand that one great
'â¢'. battle be fought, even ii defeat is certain, !
in order to vindicate the honor of Greece. I
- Then they will be willing to submit and
seek the good offices of the powers, which
'. the latter are so anxious to exercise.
..." The impression prevails that, whatever
* be tbe popular feeling, official circles
â¢would welcome any mediation of the
... .powers that would delay any definite 1
declaration. The action of the new
Ministry may be explained by stating
. that they are awaiting a fulfillment of
'their hope, despite the denials of dip
- lomats, and are in a passive accordance
- with the decision of the powers to await
â¢ Greece's act of penance. Persistent re- '
. ports circulate that foreign envoys are
â¢using their efforts in the direction of
. peace with prospects of success.
. â  Skouloudis, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
â  in- conversing with the diplomats has
shown he is not opposed to mediation,
though it has not been asked for. The j
situation will doubtless develop speedily
- after the receipt of the reports of Colonel
Tsamavos, Minister of War, and Theotkis,
- Minister of the Interior, who were sent to I
Pharsala to examine the condition of the â 
army. It is stated these reports have al
ready been submitted to the Cabinet, but
â¢ statements regarding their tenor vary, one
. declaring they were impressed with the
preparedness of the army and in favor of '
â¢ prosecuting the war, while another says :
,' the reports are gloomy, their substance
" being the army is not in a position to as- !
'* .same the offensive or even resist for any
length, of time.
Meanwhile tbe hopes of the patriots ;
and soldiery center in General Smolenitz, j
the hero of Velestino. He if anybody !
;" seems to be able to lead the troops to vie- !
tory*. Independent accounts ascribe to
bim great ability, sound judgment, cool
ness, personal courage and the faculty of
inspiring confidence. Only as a strategist
he has not yet been proved. Should he
'meet the . invaders and be defeated it
' would undoubtedly be the last act of the !
military drama. Thereafter a revolution
; might be expected.
GUILTY OF COWARDICE.
Crown Prince Constantine Avoided
Engaging the Turks In Every
Case In Thessaly.
. LONDON, Exg., May 3.â lt is believed,
the. dispatches allege, besides gross in
competency the most flagrant cowardice
was displayed by the Greek officers, in- |
eluding Crown Prince Constantine, in the \
'..whole: campaign in Thessaly. Several i
English war correspondents on the Greek j
The San Francisco Call
f side say the Crown Prince in every case
avoided an engagement. The effect of
such conduct of the commander and of
; ficers upon the army was extremely de-
I moralizing.
The danger of the dynasty's overthrow
! is increasing, and it is believed the gravity
| of the situation consequent upon the pop
| ulai*exasperation at hearing of the cow
ardice of the Crown Prince accounts for
the diplomatic illness of Kine George and
< his proposed departure from Athens.
Among the reports in circulation it is
i alternately asserted and denied that an
* armistice Las been declared. It i. also re
ported that the Greeks have begun to
withdraw from Pharsala to take up a
i final position at Darnaki and the Otbrys â 
i Mountains-
The Standard's Athens correspondent
recording instances of the irritation
( against the royal family says at Achaia,
where the Crown Prince owns a large
estate, the people were summoned Sunday
by the church bells. After they had as
sembled they marched in a body to the
royal residence, seized the arms of the
royal guards, smashed the furniture and
burned all the private papers they could
find. The dispatch adds that there was a
renewal of disorders in the churches in
Athens and Patras in connection with the
i offering of prayers for the royal family.
Detailed reports of the three days'
i fighting at Velestino show that the Turks
were either badly informed by the scouts
\or absurdly rash. The truth seems to be
j that they did not suspect the presence of
j the Greeks, who were skillfully concealed.
i The Ottoman cavalry charge on the
Greeks' left wing seemed sheer madness.
Very few horsemen reached nearer than
200 yards of the Greek lines.
The wheat field over which they charged
was thickly strewn after the engagement
with the bodies of men and horses who
bad fallen victims to the deadly musketry
fire of the Greek highlanders. Many of
tbe dead were clad in portions of Greek
uniforms, which were presumably aban
doned when Larissa was evacuated. The
Turkish locs at Velestino is estimated to
have been 600 killed and a large number
wounded.
PARIS, Fba-nck, May 3.â Figaro asserts
the King is afflicted with heart trouble
which manifests itself in the recurrence of
cardiac spasms, and his physicians have
insisted upon his immediately seeking a
change of scene and climate either on
the island of Milo or Syra.
VOLO, Greece, May 3.â The Greek war
, ship which is about to start for the
Piraeus, the port of Athens, bas aboard over
100 strong boxes containing Government
; funds collected in Thessaly. This fact
causes uneasiness, as the people believe
} the removal ot the treasure indicates the
; Government has little faith in the ability
| of the army to hold the Turks in check
j should they make an advance in force.
Officials here assert, however, the ship
ment of money is simply a precautionary
measure.
The Turks are again in the vicinity of
: Velestino. wbere 18,000 Greeks are en
! camped. A French flag has been hoisted
| over the hospital for the purpose of pro
| tecting it from the fire of the Turks in the
event of another attack.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, May 3.â
; The whole of the second-class reserves be
| longing to the Third Army Corps have
! been called out for active service.
FOR AN ARMISTIC
i Edhem Pasha Reported to Have
Sent an Officer With a Flag
of Truce.
ATHENS. , Greece. May 3.â Advices
from Pharsala say that Edhem Pasba has
sent an officer with a flag of truce to the
headquarters of the Greek army request
ing an armistice for five days.
Colonel Vassos, the commander of the
Greek army of occupation in Crete, has
been recalled and Colonel Staikos will suc
ceed him. His recall is officially explained
to be due to the necessity of re-enforcing
the army in Thessaly, where the officer is
wanted. There is no intention of recall
ing the troops from Crete.

Greek irregulars commanded. by Tertipi,

GERMANY WILL STRIKE BACK.
A Remorseless Tar ff War Against the
United States Suggested â Yon Bieb
erstem's Significant Remarks. . .
BERLIN, Germany, May; 3.â ln the
Reichstag to-day Count, yon Kanitz-Pod
angen (Conservative) asked the Govern
ment if, in view of the increased differ
ence of duties upon German sugar fixed
by the new American tariff, it was its in
tention to maintain the agreement with
the United States entered into * in * 1891.
He advocated a : remorseless tariff war
against the United States. " *' *-*.*â¢
Yon Biebersteiu, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, replied that the governments of
the United States and Germany had not
yet taken definite positions upon the ques
tion and that it- would be impossible to
foretell what would happen when the res
olution passed by the House of Repre
sentatives at Washington should become
a law.
The Foreign Minister then rehearsed
the commercial relations between Ger
many and the United States and protested
against the D.ngley bill, which, he said,
threatened to cancel tbe concessions made
at Saratoga. There was a mistaken con
viction entertained at Washington that it
would be* to the interests of Germany to
maintain cordiality of relations with Amer
ica in any event and he hoped there
would be a thorough change of views in
this respect. He objected, however, to an
immediate tariff war, which he believed
would be a sinister mistake. Such a situ
ation, he said, was a serious one and all
Europe would take interest in its develop
ment. The Government would decide
with energy, founded upon its rights in
the cause, and consider the best interests
of the empire.

SUDDEN FALL OF
A BONANZA KING
Financial Ruin of the
Builder of Aspen,
Colo.;
James B. Wheeler Loses the
, Millions He Made by
Fraud.
Compelled to Make Restitution to
the Family of the Man He
Robbed.
DENVER, Colo., May Jerome B.
Wheeler, once a millionaire of Aspen,
Colo., is said to be at the end of his string
after half a score of years of unqualified
success.. He, was. reputed to be worth' at
one time from one to five million dollars,
and mercantile agencies said tbat the lat
ter figure was a closer estimate of his for
tune than the former. He practically
built Aspen, and :by the free use of
money raised it from the level of a min
ing camp to a town which, until the
panic, supported a population ot , 10,000
souls. ;â ' .
.There he erected a hotel at a cost of
$60,000, and started a bank that main
tained unimpeachable credit throughout
the panic, in spite of 'be fact that its doors
were closed for a few days .while awaiting
the arrival of currency from New York.
So confident were the depositors of the
security of their funds that even after the
doors were opened they did not withdraw
a cent. .* â¢ ./' ;.,,; ...-.-. -, - . JJ.yJJyy,
Wheeler was owner of the famous Aspen
mine, that netted him at the lowest esti
mate $3,000,000 when silver was ona parity
with gold. When at the. zenith of! his
success Wheeler visited ( Manitou,. and so
pleased was he with the place that he
ordered one of the finest villas in the West
to be built on the side of an old trail lead
ing to the summit of Pikes Peak. 'There
he held forth season after season, enter
taining with a lavishne^s that was aston
ishing. Every one attempted to trail after
him in the matter of investments, for, be
never failed to make handsome returns
from anything he touched. JJjjj.
A residence at Manitou was not enough
for a bonanza king who might want to use
large sums at any hour of the day, so he
started a bank that in the summer season
controlled the business between ; the
watering place and the East, for a draft
from Wheeler's bank was deemed so good
that it really commanded a premium over
larger and incorporated concerns at Colo
rado Springs. y\
J- But one day a quiet little fellow named
Casserleig-i from Kansas City walked into
the office of the, millionaire and made a
demand for possession oi the Aspen mine
and a share of ; the profits that Wheeler
had been | storine? "; away for ten' years.
W Peeler ordered him out of the office and
then Casserlei-h. who bad spent five years
in procuring testimony, went to the heirs
of a deceased prospector and told them
they , were ; en titled i-toJ a million -iby.
proofs in hia '.- possession. : fie told them
' that Wheeler bad defrauded; one Woods,
a poor old miner, out of his property ,by
representing that tne mine would never
pay, and* getting his relinquishment 'for
the nominal sum of $150. Woods had
died and his family was scattered, most of
them suffering for want of food when
Casserleigh found them. ,-' ;
- Judgment was rendered against Wheeler
for $750,000, and the litigation was carried
to the highest courts of the land, where
the findings were approved, thus encom
passing the downfall of the millionaire.
Both of his banks at Aspen and Manitou
were turned over to assignees to-day under
instructions from ' Whoeler by 'telegraph
from New York, where he resides. Wheeler
is now on his way here and 13 expected to
! arrive on Friday. â  ' â 
STAVING OFF THE DIVORCE.
Latest Western Union' Move. to Prevent .the
Segregation of 'the Company From â 
the Union Pacific.
OMAHA, Nebr.. May 3.â Rush Taggart
of New York, solicitor for the Western
Union Telegraph Company, was in the
United States" court to-day v asking for,
leave to make a supplementary filing in
the case of the United' States against bis
company and the Union Pacific Railroad
Company in the matter of separating tbe
telegraph business of the defendants. The
question before the court is the entering
of a decree, in obedience 'to the mandate
of ; the Supreme Court,-, absolutely and
finally divorcing the Western Union from
the Union Pacific and compelling ' the
latter hereafter to operate a telegraph line
of its own for commercial purposes. - -
Mr. Taggart raises' the point that the de
cree which it is proposed to enter is not a
correct copy of the original decree signed
by Judge Brewer, but this is less import
ant than the request that before any fur-
proceedings in the- matter are had
the receivers of the Union Pacific be made
defendants, . the ~ original action having
been v brought _ beoref receivers were
appointed. Before the decree :is entered,
also, an accounting between the Union
Pacific and Western Union, with '. a sched
ule of telegraph equipment owned by
each, is asked: for. ;}<-â â :'
- The court took the matter under consid
eration. - It is the conjecture that the de
fendants are seeking only for time,
hoping to defer the entering of the decree
until after the contemplated sale of the
Union Pacific, when possibly the necessity
of a decree may be avoided by j a ratifica
tion of the old contract by the new com
pany and the making of a new con
tract. â¢â  ' * *_-- .â¢'-'- ;' ,

IMPRISONED IN A SEWER.
Thrilling Ordeal That Causes a Laborer's
'. flair to - Turn From Raven Black

BOSTON, Mass., May 3.â The newly
completed metropolitan sewer, which lex
tends from Somerville to Cambridge, on
tbe Outskirts of Boston, was opened to
day with nearly fatal results, a workman
enduring a terrible experience. . Francisco
Lazaroni, an Italian laborer, went back
into tbe sewer to-night to searc h for some
tools after work was suspended. When
he returned he found that big three-inch
planks had been nailed over the entrance,
actually imprisoning him.
His cries and blows were of no avail.
He' could not make himself hoard and
could not force the heavy planks. J It was
inky dark and the only avenue of escape
was at the. other exit, over two miles
away, in Cambridge. The sewer is only
four feet deep,' which prevented him from
standing erect, so he could only make his
way slowly and painfully with bent back,
bruising himself at every turn 'by falling
on the slippery bricks.
â¢ It was 'an awful ordeal. ' For hours he
walked, often-falling exhausted and hope
less in the deathlike blackness and silence.
After four hours- and alter walking over
two miles he was rescued at the other en
trance, - more dead 'than alive. -When
taken out' his' drawn and haggard features
were crowned by ; a head of snow-white
hair, wbich only ' four hours ' before was
black as night.

Morgan Cries Out That
Cruelties to Cubans
Must Cease.
IN THE NAME OF GOD
AND HUMANITY.
Such -Horrors as Weyler Has
Inflicted Should Be at
Once Checked.
RECOGNITION WOULD PREVENT
STARVAIION.
Sleek, Well Fed Hale of Maine,
However, Obj cts and Causes
a Postponement.
WASHINGTON, D- C, May 3.â ln tbe
Senate to-day tbe joint resolution recog
nizing the belligerency of Cuba, intro
duced some weeks ago by Morgan, was
taken up, and Morgan asked a vote upon
it. . An objection was interposed by Hale,
who said he had only just returned
from the obsequies of bis colleague in
the House, Milhken, and was not pre
pared to speak upon the resolution. He
said otber Senators also desired to speak
upon it. He assure I Morgan be had no
desire to delay action and was willing to
have a vote taken as soon as it could
properly be done. He could not, how
ever, agree to have the time fixed for such
vote as Morgan suggested.
Morgan said he had reliable authority
for the statement that under tbe present
policy of Weyler thousands of people were
literally starving to death in Cuba. In
the city of Matanzas and other cities and
towns * hundreds of .persons were naked,
diseased, starving and begging for crumbs.
-That condition had been brought about,
he said, oy the most- inhuman method of
war. which Weyler had instituted in
Cuba, driving people from . their homes
where they might be* able to subsist and
berding them in towns, requiring tbem to
remain under a promise of support from
the Spanish Government. That promise
had not only not been kept, but was will
fully violated. He was alraid before the
Senator from Maine would get ready to
submit his remarks hundreds of persons
would starve to death in Cuba under that
policy. Ttie peoole of the 'United States
were sending money and provisions to
India to help tbe starving Hindoos, but
no such contributions were sent to Cuba.
If any attempt to do so were made the
contributions would .be intercepted by
ships of the United States; or if not they
would be refused admittance into the
ports of Cuba.
' "Well, sir," he exclaimed dramatically,
"I cannot remain in a state of content
ment while I know these sufferings, .those
woes, these outrages, these horrible inflic
tions are going on under the name of
Spanish warfare. Let the burden of
responsibility fall upon those who are
willing to bear it. In the name ol God
and humanity lam not willing to share
that burden. No, sir, not for a day. What
I conceive to be the duty of the Senate is
to forthwith act on this joint resolution
and either pass or refuse to pass it. Let
us stand in an honest and sincere light
before God and humanity. Let us not
attempt to deceive ourselves and mankind
at large with . the idea we have got any
human sympathy left in our bosoms or
any feeling of resentment against the out
rages and barbarities perpetrated in Cuba,
while we stand here talking about the ex
pression of our honest views on so great a
subject. I will not consent, however, to
further delay, knowing in doing so I am
exposing men to starvation, disease and
death, from which they woold bo relieved
by the passage of this joint resolution
whether passed by the House and ap
proved by the President or not."
Hale said.be did not agree with Morgan
regarding the present condition of things
in Cuba, nor did he think the passage of
the joint resolution would tend to improve
matters. He thought it would rather
intensify them. He assured Morgan he
had no desire to delay action and would
be ready to proceed with the discussion to
morrow. With this the colloquy closed,
the joint resolution going over until to
morrow.
THE COB Alt REPUBLIC.
There Will Be a. Meeting of lta Congress
â¢ to Revise the Law*.
PUERTO PRINCIPE, Cuba, April 17.â
Representatives of Orient, Camaguey and
Las Villas in the General Assembly of the
Cuban Republic, which will probably
meet in May at Guaimarito have already
arrived at the headquarters of the Cuban
Government ; near San Jeronimo. .The
Government has received advices from
Matanzas. Havana and Pinar del Rio.
Representatives of these States have also
been nominated in the elections held in
tbe Cuban array of the West. They ex
pect to arrive soon. .
The Assembly's object is a revision of
the constitution .. proclaimed .September
16, . 1895. The special law will also be
vetoed prohibiting chiefs of the army from
receiving proposals of peace from Span
i lards and declaring to be a traitor and2
liable to the death penalty any Cuban
who shall make such proposals unless
they are based upon absolute indepen
dence of the Island. The Representatives
will be twenty-four in numberâfour from
each of the six States into which the
island is divided. After the constitution
is revised and other measures providing
for an improved internal administration
adopted the Assembly will adjourn to
meet again for the election of a Presi
dent. According to the opinion of the
majority the re-election of President Sal
vador Cisneros is almost certain. The
only formidable rival is Vice-President
Masso, who served in the army during the
war of 1868 <nd was one of the first to take
up arms in 1895.

Stanton Sickles, whom the President
has nominated for Secretary of Legation
at -Madrid, is a son of General Daniel
Sickles, and as such his appointment may
carry considerable significance. General
Sickles is one of the most ardent sup
porters of the Cuban cause. He has been

Cuba's annexation, and has openly ex
pressed a desire to be the first Governor of
Cuba. His son's sentiments are un

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 3. â The

Government for its treatment of American
products and manufactures. He says that
Germany bas greater fears of the United
States in the future than any other coun- ;
try. !
"We bave nothing to expect from Ger- j
many in the way of permanent trade," he j
says. "Our machines will be bought, ta Ken
apart and successfully imitated, except j
when our manufacturers are wise enough j
to take out imperial patent rights."
The Consul adds that one manufacturer !
who has grown rich by stealing American
inventions will leave Germany within ten
days for America, for the purpose of secur- j
ing new inventions and selling them as '
his own.
"This is no market for our merchants
or manufacturers," says the Consul. "It j
is not in the temper of these people to
take our wares except to successfully imi- I
tate them. Many of the largest and most !
successful factories in this district owe
their prosperity to American merchants!
and American ideas. If uroois of this ;
statement are wanted 1 have them ready." !
The Consul suggests the advisabi.'ity of I
entering into commercial relations with ;
Russia and Austria with a view to forcing j
Germany into more satisfactory trade re- !
lations.
PROVES A SPLE\DiI> VESSEL.
Official Report of the Cruiser Brooklyn's
Pinal Trial.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 3.â The
ofliciai report of the armored cruiser
Brooklyn's final trial was received to-day
and shows the Brooklyn to be a splendid
vessel. She made eighteen knots under
natural draught. The engines ran
smoothly, without heating, and gave no
trouble whatever despite the suspicion
that they had been injured by the ground
ing of the sbip in the Delaware River last
February. Average indicated horsepower
of the main engines for the whole run at
lull speed was $293.7.
The turret-turning gear, steam and elec
tric, worked easily and quickly. The guns
proved to be all right and the vessel stood
concussion well. There was no oppor
tunity for testing her qualities as a sea
boat or for the working of her turrets
under heavy-weather conditions on ac
count of the smooth sea, but the board
pays the vessel will not fail of efficient
behavior under any conditions of the
service.

Major Dowling Detailed as
Military Attache at
Vienna.
Great Chan-gas Contemplated as a
Result of Commissioning* New
Gunboats. *
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 3.-The
nomination of Colonel William K. Shafter
as brigadier-general was confirmed by the
Senate to-day, notwithstanding all oppo
sition, as predicted in Thk Call's Wash
ington dispatches.
General Shafter was a visitor at The
Call? Washington office to-night. He is
very much gratified over the action of
Senate. He is also proud of the last honor
conferred upon him by the President.
! He has been assigned to command the
! Department of tbe East, with head
quarters at Governors Island, during the
absence of General Merritt, wbo will be
'in Europe for two months. This com
mand is second in importance, that at
Chicago being tbird.
At the end of the two months Genera)
Shatter will return to San Francisco, and
! after packing bis household effects will
j remove to Vancouver, the headquarters of
j the Department of the Columbia. He
I goes to Governors Island on Thursday.
! General Shafter said to The Call corre
! spondent to-night that Lieutenant-Colonel
Kline, now of the Ninth, would succeed
Colonel Jewett as colonel of tbe Twenty
first Infantry, and tbat Lieutenant-Colonel
Miles would be as* gned to the First In
fantry.
The War Department has decided to
detail Major Dowling of the Third Ar
tillery, now at the Presidio, as military
attache at Vienna, Austria. By direction
of tbe Secretary of War, Private John P.
Collins, Company G, First Infantry, now
t the Presidio of San Francisco, will be
discharged the service of tbe United States
on receipfrof this order by the command
ing oflicer of his station.
Lieutenant-Colonel William H. Bell, U.
â  S. A., assistant commissary general sub
sistence, has been granted a patent for a
. project adapted particularly to smooth-
I bore guns, in which means are provided
! for imparting a rotary motion whereby it
I is kept steady upon its axis in flight and
i prevents the common errors technically
i known as "tumbling." The projectile was
; recently tested at the Presidio of San
| Francisco, where it was fired from a six
! pounder smooth-bore gun, attained a
I velocity of 700 feet per second, and satis
fied all the requirements claimed. Inter
ested with Lieutenant-Colonel BeU in the
invention is Captain W. D. Reed, U. 8. A.,
retired, of San Francisco.
As a result of the commissioning of new
; gunboats there promises to be a consid
! erable change of material of ships on for
eign naval stations. Orders have been
issued by the Navy Dspartment placing
; the Wilmington in commission. Details
! are also being prepared for the gunboat
Concord, the repairs to which have just
\ been completed at Mare Isl-nd, and for
; the Helena and Annapolis, which have
; been preliminarily acc&pted and are now
'. nt the yards of their builders undergoing
; final touches preliminary to being turned
: over to the Government.
Instead of being the training-ship for
the Naval Academy it has been deter
mined by the officials to use the Annapo
lis for regular service and have the
| Vicksburg perform this duty. This vessel
| is under construction at the Bath Iron
j Works. The Vicksburg will have her pre
j liminary trial witbin a few days. The
! Nashville, which is practically completed
j at the works of the Newport News Ship
building Company, has had several con
tractors' trials and has been reported as
ready for her official test.
The gunboats Wheeling and Marietta
are being completed at the Union Iron
Works and instructions are being sent to
the officers at Mare Island to lay out a
trial course for the vessels in San Fran
cisco Bay. Considerable difficulty is being
experienced in getting crews for these
ships, but once they are manned they will
be sent to the four quarters of the globe.
The monitor Amphitrite, before being
i laid up in ordinary at Annapolis, will go
to Norfolk, where she will be placed in
! apple-pie order. Those of her crew who
I wiil not be retained on board this ship for
duty will be distributed among tbe gun
boats to go in commission.
The Columbia will also be thoroughly
repaired before being placed in ordinary,
and a portion of her crew will be used for
filling the complements of men intended
for the third-rate vessels.
Tbe Concord, which will be commanded
by Commander Asa Walker, will prob
ably be sent to China. Upon her appear
ance there is reason to believe that tbe
Yorktown will be ordered home. Witbin
the next year the Monocacy will probably
be disposed of and one of the new gun
boats will be sent to China to take her
place.
The Wilmington may be ordered to the
South Atlantic station to take tbe place of
the Yantic, which is now on her way to
Norfolk, where she will be placed out of
commission.
It is the purpose of Secretary Long to
distribute the gunboats as much as possi
ble, and lay a numberof tbe larger vessels
up in ordinary, so as to run the navy on
as economical a basis as possible.
The detail of officers to take a course of
instruction at the naval war college dur
ing the coming summer is being prepared
at the Navy Department. On account of
the necessity of officers performing work
in connection with vessels under construc
tion and tbeir routine duty, some diffi
culty is being experienced in getting
twenty-five who are available. Com
mander C. F. Goodrich, the president of
the institution, has outlined a course of
study, which will be lollowed. Ji : JA
PERMITTED ;TO RESIGN.
While Xini.ter to Hayti Smythe Was
Tea Drunk to ttrnd to Duly. J .
WASHINGTON, D. C, May. 3.--The
publication of the proposition of .'â  tbe
P.-esilent of San Domingo to grant .the
United State* a coaling station in Samana
Bay ; has led j to the discovery * that the
American Minister to Hayti, Henry M.
Smythe, to whom; the proposition was
made, was allowed to resign while charges
were pending against bim of being a
baoitual drunkard. Smytbe's statement
that ho was dismissed through a blunder
of Assistant Secretary of State Cridler
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 4, 1897.
while on the point of giving the depart
ment the details of a project which he
had arranged with the San Domingo Gov
ernment i 3 not officially admitted, but
there is no doubt that immediately after
making the verbal report to Secretary
Sherman his resignation was accepted.
It transDlres that whether.or not Crindler
acted without authority it is a fact that
specific charges of habitual drunkenness,
incapacitating him from the performance
of official duty, is now on file against
Smythe in the State Department made by
various persona. Following are extracts
from the written charges: 'â ':â 'â ' 'â â .." V
' "He arrived from San Domingo March
15. and I can prove by every Consul here,
starting from the United Slates down to
every other, that since his arrival be has
not been one hour sober, abd not drunk
alone, but beastly drunk besides. He is
just staggering all day from one side to
the other of tho streets, with a crowd of
little boys Calling out, 'Look at the
drunken sailor.'
"Smythe made an appointment to meet
the Minister of Foreign Relations on the
â¢-!*">! Keed, the Vice-Consul, was to go
wiih him and act as interprets. When
the time arrived Reed found the Minister
in such a drunken state bu refuse .* to go
with film, and the upshot was there was
no meeting at all. This man Smythe is
the laughing-stock of the community."
It is understood the State Department
will shOitly give a statement covering the
facts regarding Smythe's negotiations tor
a coaling station. --- ; -V.
MILL VALLEY COCKING MAIN.
Tame Duel Between Go Fowls in a
Secluded Canyon Near the
Ti if.7.
MILL VALLEY, Cal.. May 3.â A genuine
old-fasbioned cocking main was I eld in
one of the canyons between Mill Valley,
and Alto, and was witnessed by a number
of sports from Ran Franciscoand others
Irom this vicinity. The canyon selected
for the illegal pastime is just beyond East
Mll Valley. The birds were of the game
fowl variety, the roosters having been
raised especially to appease the morbid
longings of persons inteiested in such
sports. Yesterday afternoon a quiet tip
was passed to the trusted few who knew
that the event was to take place, and they
slipped quietly away from Mill Valley and
journeyed to the secluded canyon.
One of the cock* was raised in Mill Val
ley and great things were expected of him,
while the other bird was broil- over
from San Francisco by its owner. So
secretly was the affair conducted that the
officers did not know of it until this morn
ing alter the princinal parties had left for
the City and tne tight was a thing of the
past. Those who witnessed the fight say
that it was a tame affair and a great dis
appointment. The birds had not been
supplied with gaffs, but the owners took
the precaution to sharpen their spurs.
When the games hopped lorward to fight,
the spectators expected a fierce struggle,
but the pair showed little energy and
needed considerable urging before they
could be made to fly at each other. They
acted as if tired, and neither took the
offensive with any vim, to the great dis
gust of tbe assembled sports.
Taken all in all tie tight was a disap
pointment, andwthe favored few who trav
eled over the dusty roads to witness it
were more tban angry.
It is said that another fight between the
same birds will be brought off if the ar
rangements can be completed without
coming to the knowledge ol tbe officers or
others who will stop the sport aud arrest
tbe principals and spectators.
FITZ WOS'T IHi HI CHOIXSKI.
Says Joe Must First Vanquish Corbett
and Maher.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 3.âFitzsim
mons arrived from Pittsburg yesterday.
He immediately set aside all chances of a
match with Cboynski by declaring that
the posting of $1000 by "Parson" Davies
with Al Smith to further the encounter
next fall was futile. Fitzsimmons added
that he does not intend to fight anybody
for a while, and if he does make up his
mind to go into the ring once more his
next opponent will not be Choynski.
"If Joe wants to fight me," said Bob,
"he must go ahead and lick Corbett and
Maher. There is no absolute chance of
any of those would-be fighters meeting me
unless they go ahead and do something
I've fought every one and licked them ail
with the exception of Goddard and Jack
son. Peter is a great fighter, but has re
tired. Goddard is the only man left and
he is entitled to first chance.''
Speaking of Corbett the champion said:
"I don't know wbat I wilt do with him. I
may fight him again and may not."

LIVELY WORDS
IN THE SENATE
Morgan and Tillman Go
at Each Other With
Sarcasm.
The Alabama Senator Resents
the Assertion That He Is
a Cobbler.
And Says Some Rather Uncompli
mentary Things -"bout South
Carolina People.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 3.â Senator
Vest's resolution for an investigation by
the Committee on Commerce of the causes
of disastrous floods of the Mississippi was
reported back favorably from tne Com
mittee on Contingent Expenses in the
Senate to-day, and went over until to
morrow. v*;-^'
A message from the President recom
mending an appropriation of $6000 for dis
tribution among the heirs ot the three
Italians lynched in Louisiana last August,
"without admitting liability by this Gov
ernment," was referred to tbe Committee
on Appropriations.
The Senate then went into executive
; session, where Morgan delivered another
installment of his speech against the arbi
tration treaty.
When the doors were reopened the Sen
ate bill to provide free houses on public
lands for actual and na-fide settlers,
and to reserve public lands for tbat pur
pose, was taken up as unfinished business.
An amendment Was offered by Morgan
providing that all public lands not taken
up by homestead entry January 1, 1900,
shall be granted to States and Territories
for educational purposes.
Morgan was twitted by Tillman with at
tempting to "gobble up" public lands for
the benefit of Alabama and other States
which had them, leaving out such States
as South Carolina, in which there are no
public lands. JJ^JJ'J
"I am not a gobbler," Morgan said
severely, "and the rules of decency which
apply to gobblers do not apply to me.'
The colloquy was continued in a bitter
tone, Tillman declaring that nearly half
the people of Alabama had descended
from the men of South Carolina and were
proud of their forefathers.
Morgan retorted he was willing to vote
that all who came -to Alabama from
South Carolina should go back there.
"I have never seen an Alabaman that
came from South Carolina," said Tillman,
"who was not proud of it."
, "Yes," said Morgan, contemptuously,
"they are usually proud and poor; that is
the misfortune of a great many people."
After this interchange of compliments
Morgan withdrew the amendment and
tho bill went over till to-morrow, when a
vote will be taken.
BAILEY'S IXFLVEXCB WANES.
Jerry Simpson Gets Almost as Much
. nnpporl Â« â¢* the Texas Leader.
WASHINGTON, D. C., May, 3.â Jerry
Simpson, Populist leader, of Kansas, rose
in the House to-day to a question of per
sonal privilege, as the basis for which he
sent to the clerk's desk and had read sev
eral newpaper extracts charging him with
being an obstructionist. One Of these,
from the Glenns Falls (N. V.) Times, said
of him:.
He reminds ns strikingly of a species of
sheep which when released tears all over the
farm. Knocking down everything and every
body in sight. But Jerry wants to always keep
in mind that this bounding, buoyant hunter
sometimes runs its head against a wall, and
Jerry, when he tackled Tom Reed, makes us
think very much of this simile. ' ;. ,r t
Some people will think the truth of this
characterization j Was vindicated by the
subsequent proceedings. Before the
House had adjourned a majority had re
lieved Reed of the responsibility of refus
ing to appoint committees, which was the
burden of Simpson's plaint, and by a vote
of 124 to 51 formally declared it did not
want the committees appointed.
To be sure, he was not the immediate
cause of this action, knowing too well the
result to respond to the challenge of tne
Speaker to test the sense of the House on
the question. But the impetuous mem
ber, James Hamilton Lewis of Washing
ton, rushed in where Jerry feared to tread
and the issue was made, with the result
stated.
The proceedings leading up to the vote
were unusually lively. After Simpson
i ad read his collection Of Clippings Ding
ley made a point, no question of persona!
privilege being presented by Simpson,
and the Sneaker expressed the same opin
ion. â ':','*â 
Notwithstanding this Simpson went on
declaring he would not rest under the
charge of obstructing business when the
truth was the Sneaker had failed to ap
point committees in accordance with the
rules of the House. This angered Reed,
who engaged in an animated colloquy with
Simpson, challenging him or any other
member to present a resolution directing
the Speaker to appoint committees.
"If he will do that and the House" ap
proves his position the committees will
be promptly appointed," Reed said with
emphasis.
"The Speaker knows a single objection
would prevent consideration," Simpson
pleaded. â â¢***. â¢
"The chair will recognize the gentle
man for that purpose. Will he introduce
the resolution ? ' tbe Speaker asked.
"Oh, with a brute majority at his back
the Speaker likely enough will be sus
tained," was the reply.
"Will the gentleman introduce the res
olution?" Reed reiterated. "He knows
he can settle this question by presenting
the resolution and the chair would wel
come the test." ::yJ;J'-y
Simpson, however, was not inclined to
accept the challenge and endeavored to
proceed with his personal privilege. /;â â 
Several members on the Republican side
protested against his being permitted to
go on simply because |he had seen fit to
make an attack upon the Speaker.
"Oh," exclaimed Simpson, "is the
Speaker not to be attacked ? Is he beyond
the reach of all of us here?"
He was cut short by the fall of the
Speaker's gavel. The Speaker ruled that
Simpson had not presented a question of
personal privilege. He said: "It would
be bad policy, to permit the time of the
House to be taken up with such newspa
per statements as he has presented, for it
is apparent they do not in any wise injure
the gentleman's usefulness." . -"J'Jy
; This shot was received with loud laugh
ter. Democrats and Republicans alike
joining. The Speaker asked the House to
determine whether Simpson bad presented
a question of privilege. By a vote of 94 to
37 it was decided he had not and on
demand for the ayes only eighteen joined
him. *; - - 1 '
Dingley moved the usual three day ad
journment and it resulted in ayes 128,
noes 46.
Lewis' resolution was then Introduced.
It declared it to be the sense of the House
that committees be appointed as soon as
possible. Lewis advocated the adoption
of the resolution M meeting the demands
ol the country that the fr-e coinage of
silver be discussed and ordered if Con
gress shall deem bast. J ,*-J:-il
After Bailey's remarks on the resolution
Dingley moved an amendment by declar
ing it to be the sense of the House that
the committee be immediately appointed.
Dingley's resolution was accepted as the
question before the House. The Republi
cans and followers of Bailey among the
Democrats voted no. It resulted, ayes 51,
noes 124.
Incidentally, the proceedings came near
making a shipwreck of Bailey's leader
ship. He opposed the resolution, declar
ing it to be tbe sense of the House that
committees be not appointed at tbis ses
sion, and when the vote was counted it
was found Bailey was only supported by
thirty-one Democrats, while thirty under
Simpson voted against him. While the
vote was progressing it was said by one of
the Bailey men it was really a test of con
fidence in Bailey as a leader; that ever
since the caucus three weeks ago the op
ponents of Bailey had desired to get an
aye and no vote on the question.
The Senate joint resolution appropriat
ing $50,000 to pay the cost of the congress
of the Universal Postal Union was passed.
At 3:30 the House adjourned until
Thursday.
UXDEhT.tKEIxS HIS VICTIMS.
Capture and Swift Disposal of a Unique
London Thief.
LONDON, Eng., May 3.â The most
unique thief of the present decade, and
who for a year had been hunted in vain
by his victims, has at last been appre
hended, tried, convicted and sentenced to
penal servitude, all within sixty hoursâ
an unusual record in this country." â¢
His name was James Felix, and his
method was to call at undertakers' es
tablishments, generally late in the even
ing, for the purpose of making arrange
ments for the funeral of some mythical
father, mother, wife or other relative. . .1 '
When the undertaker's back was tem
porarily turned for the purpose of getting
sample's of satin with wnich to line the
casket or velvet with which to cover it or
samples of the silver plate or handles,
Felix would appropriate anything in
sight from the contents of the cash
drawer to an overcoat and make a hasty
departure.
In this way he has victimized over 400
undertakers in London, or an average of
two a week for four years.
On odd nights he made incursions by
rail into the residence suburbs, where he
played the same game, j Finally some of
the latter-day victims put tneir noses to
getner and issued a re ward for his capture,
which finally resulted in his conviction
and sentence. -â¢ ?v

Colonel Buckand Young

Duel. ;
At a Distance of Fifteen Paces

Wounded Honor.
CHICAGO. 111., May 3.â Colonel Jere
Buck of the South and W. L. King of Chi*
cago went out to kill eec^i other yesterday
according to the dueling code. Unknown
to them they shot chewing-gum bullets at
each other. The duel was fought at 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon, on a stretch
of sandbeach at the north end of Lincoln
Park. Colonel Buck served as an offic?r
on the Merriraac and on tbe staff of A. P.
Hill during the war. King is an insur
ance solicitor and the son of W. W. King,
who was a leading Chicago lawyer. The
Southerner was seconded by E. E. Kelly,
a member of the Board of Trade, and J.
S. Stevens, a Western Union telegraph
operator, stood by the side of King.
Other witnesses to the duel were Dr. A.
W. Bauer, a surgeon; Waite Denvitt, pro
prietor of the Lens ng Hotel, where the
principals lived, and F. D. Gallagher.
The trouble originated Friday over a war
discussion. King contended that General
McClellan was the greatest of modern
soldiers and Colonel Buck said it was a
lie. A physical encounter was narrowly
averted tben and a challenge followed
The weapons were 38-caliber revolvers Snd
the distance fifteen paces. The five cham
bers of both weapons revolved Until
empty, but neither principal was hurt.
They suspected the regulation ammuni

to shake bands and honor was satisfied.
The seconds loaded the revolvers with
chewing-gum.

WHAT CII 00
To be cured? I do want to be a
s:rong man once more. The answer
is, Consult the Hudson Medical Doc-
tors, either privately or in a letter,
which is the same. Tell the doctors
just how you feel, do all you can to
help them, and if the great remedy-
treatment HUDYAN is good for you
the doctors will allow you to have it. .
Just 10,000 men claim to have been
cured with HUDYAN. Can they be
10,000 fools or worse? Dr. Johnson
says What all believe to be true must
be true. Well, if it is true that HUD-
YAN does cure, you ought to have it.

Ramon Molina's Trial ]
for Murder Begun
at Fresno.
Slew a Cantua Creek Lad Who ,
Had Bested Him at
Wrestling.
The Accused Prisoner One of the
Most Hated of Early Day
Outlaws.
FRESNO, Cai... May 3.â The trial of
Ramon Molina for the murder of Juan
Parra in the Can tun Creek country, in the
northwestern portion of this county, five
years aco, was begun in Judge Webb's
court this morning and will be concluded
to-morrow.
Molina is an aged Mexican, and the j
Sheriff's force, which has made some in- j
vestigations, believes that he has a very
dark record. According to information
in the possession of the officers Molina
was a member of the Va*-auez gang of out
laws which terrorized California some
years ago. Yasquez was at the bead of a
large gang of Mexican brigands, and,
though he perpetrated awful cruelties on
many of his victims, Molina is said to
bave been too bloodthirsty for him and ,
the leader expelled the man now on trial
for murder from his gang.
From some of the old Mexicans who
knew Molina at that time it is learned â 
that he was reputed to have killed twenty- j
ii men in his career of outlawry. They
say that the man's thirst for blood was so
great that even Yasqut-z loathed him.
The murder for whicn Molina is now on
trial was committed in September, 1892,
He eluded the officers until about two
montns ago, when he was captured in
San Luis Obispo County. Tbe mur
derer's victim was a young man about 24
yeais of age. The killing was the result
of a drunken row, and Molina claims
that he shot Tarra in self-defense. Ac
cording to the testimony of the prosecu
tion to-day the murderer shot bis victim i
because the latter had bested him in a j
wrestling match.
Molina was on the stand in his own be
half and testified that Parra was trying to
stab him when he shot him. The de
fendant exhibited knife-scars on his
wrists and hands, where, he said, his ad
versary bad cut him.
After the murder Molina conveyed the
body to a creek near by and buried it in
the sand. It was rooted up by hogs and
found by neighbors a few days later.

BIG HOUSES BURNED.
San Francisco Business Man Tells
. About T. C. Jenkins and Joseph
Home & Co.
E. C. Godfrey of this City is an intimate
acquaintance of T. C. Jenkins, whose big
grocery bouse, said to be the largest con
cern of the line in the world, was totally
destroyed in the fire at Pittsburg, Sunday.
Mr. Godfrey speaks in the highest terms
of Mr. Jenkins and declares that in the
loss of the two concerns, those of Jenk
ins and Joseph Home & Co., Pittsburg
has suffered a severe blow commercially.
"T. C. Jenkins," said Mr. Godfrey yes
terday, "started life in this City. He
came in the early fifties and no doubt
some of the old residents who were in
business at that time will remember him.
He came to know many men who have
since gained wealth and distinction,
among them Senator Fair. Flood and oth
ers. He returned East, went to Pittsburg
and in 1865 or thereabout established
with his brother a wholesale house, hand
ling principally flour. He afterward with
drew from the firm and founded the house
which has developed into one of the great
commercial houses of the world, especially
. great among tbe list of those conducted
.py single individuals. He bought the
property upon which the house stands in
.1885, at a cost of $300,000.
"I remember his telling me of bow he
had piled up money in a bank previous to
that time, with the purpose of putting up
a big building, and that just when be was
about ready to go ahead, the bane broke,
and, as he said, he 'had to begin all over
again.' He did begin over again, and suc
ceeded in bis design of building what he
always claimed to be. and no doubt was,
'the largest flour and grocery-house in the
world.' The view of that bouse which I
have here, shows the Liberty-avenue front.
It extended through to Pennsylvania ave
nue, and there the frontage was over one
third greater. A train of eight cars could j
be run into the establishment from Lb- I
erty avenue, the tracks of tho Pennsyl
vania Railroad Company.
"Mr. Jenkins is about 65 years of age
and, shrewd, conservative and withal enter
prising business man that he is, he is dis
tinguished by' his mild, gentle manner
and kindness of heart. Without ostenta
tion, he has always been a most liberal
giver, and the list of those whom be has
assisted without the knowledge of the
world would be a long one. At the time
of the great yellow fever scourge at New
Orleans and after the Johnstown flood Ue
gave large sums*.
â¢'His loss from the fire will probably
amount to three-quarters of a million,
which I have no doubt is neariy if not
altogether covered by insurance. How
ever the interruption to his business is a
loss that cannot be met in this way. It
was his ambition to leave his big business
establishment to his sons and I am afraid
the defeat of this plan, for at bis time of
life it may probably be reckoned as de
feated, will be a severe blow to him.
"The bouse of Joseph Home & Co. was
to the dry-goods work' what that of T. C.
Jenkins was to the flour and grocery
trade, not only one of the largest but the
most widely and favorably known in the
whole country. In the obstruction of
these two Pittsburg has suffered a great
loss. "
CORWINE PLEADS GUILTY.
The Natal Paymaster Giree No Chance
for .*â â  rg nt.
NEWPORT, R. 1., May 3.â The court
martial of Paymaster John E. Corwine,
U. S. N., was continued at the naval sta
tion this morning, the accused pleading
guilty on every charge. This was a sur
prise, though his friends are pleased that
he decided upon this course, believing
that it will aid him in a plea for clem
ency.
Judge Advocate Locheirnor read the
specifications, which set forth that Cor
wine, some time between November 26,
1896, and February 1, 1897, embezzled
$10,000 of the Government's money, con
verting it to his own use; also, that on
March 1, 1897, he drew by checks $5000 of
the Government's money; also that he
made false reports in his accounts of
March 1, by representing to Pay Director
Schenck that there was a balance to his
credit in the sub-treasury at Boston of
$21,510 72, when there was only $11,510 72;
also that he absconded, and was therefore
guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer,
and also that he deserted from the naval
station on March 1.
After hearing Corwine's plea on each
count the court adjourned; as the judge
advocate, in view of the plea, would offer
no testimony. To-morrow Corwine will
be allowed to make a statement, in which
it is expected he will state that he is
really the victim of another's stealing,
and while his deficit once amounted to
$25,000 be had reduced it to $10,000 and
expected to pay the balance.
THE OUTFLOW OP .GOLD.
Steamer Lahn Takes $1,500,000 in Coin
for Paris.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 3.â Gold coin
amounting to $1,500,000 is aboard the
steamship Lahn, which sails for Bremen
to-day. It was withdrawn yesterday from
the United States sub-treasury, $1,000,000
being taken by Baring, Magoun & Co.,
representing the firm of Kidder, Peabody
& Co., Boston, and $500,000 by Heidelbach,
Icklebeimer & Co.
The destination of the gold is under-
I stood to be Paris, which has been the des
i tination of the bulk of the gold recently
i exported. Paris sterling is very weak,
1 and this shows that a large French credit
j balance has been created as a result of
j heavy sales of securities in the London
j market, chiefly mining shares. Gold is
being shipped to Paris practically for ,
London account, and this country at pres-
ent is the cheapest market where geld is
obtainable.
The gold withdrawn to-day makes a
total export since the present movement
began of $7,977,000. As a result the sold
balance of the treasury is below $150,000,-
THAT DISPENSARY LAW.
Seizure of Vandercook's Carload of Wine
May Cause the Collapse of the ' *i
System. â 
CHARLESTON 8. CL, May a â The
State dispensary law is about to lose its
main prop. In the United States Court to
day a bill was filed by Vandercook & Co. of
Calilornia, frbm whom last week a carload
of wine was seized, praying for $5000
damages for the recovery of the car. A
plea was submitted asking that a per
petual injunction be granted against
every State oflicer working under the dis
pensary law from hereafter interfering
with the company and business with its
patrons. The bill states that the company
will hereafter import liquors to the value
of $10,000. and will store and sell it to indi
viduals. The company claims rights under
the constitution and the original-package
law. The court fixed May 17 for the hear
ing.
Lawyers believe the company will se
cure an injunction, in which case liquors
can be brought in and sold just as saloons
are licensed. The State will make a big
legal fight, realizing the dispensary sys
tem is doomed if officers cannot seize im
ported liquors. Vandercook's seized car
contained goods valued at $1200. Gover
nor Ellerbe has refused to release it. It
was taken while in transit The Federal
courts have pushed the dispensary to the
wall, and the suit instituted to-day is but
the beginning of its downfall. The State
has reached an end in trying to cope with
the Federal Government in controlling
the liquor traffic.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 4, 1897.
RECOVERS A CHILD
STOLEN YEARS AGO
John Patterson of Los
Angeles Given Cause
to Rejoice.
The Little Son Kidnaped at His
Wife's Grave Returned
to Him.
Sent by an Unknown Person Across
the Mountains From a Town
In Tennessee.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 3.â A strange
and happy sequel to. a deplorably sad
event was witnessed here to-day, when
John Patterson's six-year-old son he bad
not seen for three years was returned to
him. The father, who had considered his
only child lost to him for all time, wept
tears of joy.
Three years ago Patterson resided with
his wife and child in Cincinnati. Ihey
had a comfortable home and Patterson
was earning $3 a day as the proprietor of
a milk route. In the early part of May,
1894, Patterson's wife was taken ill and on
the 12th she was buried. There was a
large attendance at the funeral and some
200 people bad assembled about the grave
while the burial services were in progress.
In some way Patterson's child became
separated irom the relatives of the family
and could not be found. Search was made
that day, the day following and for weeks
thereafter, but no trace of the missing
child could be found. It was evident that
it had been kidnaped. Patterson was
nearly distracted by reason of his misfor
tunes and concluded to come to California
for a change of scene.
On the 20th of April Patterson received
a letter postmarked Tennessee, the exact
place not being plain enough to be de
ciphered. The letter said:
John Patterson: The child lost at your wife's
grave is in '.his place. I know the circum
stances of his being carried away, but cannot
divulge them or disclose my identity.
To prove that your child is within my reach
I will describe him.
Then follows a description of the child,
and reference was made to certain marks
of identification. The letter continued:
If you telegraph me that you want the child
and will give your address I will place him in
charge of a passenger going to California.
Answer to-day and address J. J. Joyce, Nash
ville. The telegram will be forwarded.
Patterson telegraphed his instructions.
The child readied here to-day in charge
of a woman who is traveling for her
health. She says she did not know the
particulars of the boy having been kid
naped, and did not know the woman who
placed it in her charge. All. she was told
was that the father bad sent for his child.
She was informed by the person who
placed the little one in her care that it
had been kindly treated.
These are all the particulars that Pat
terson can give, and he is as much in the
dark as to the child's captors as ever.
Charlie is a bright little boy and says he
"has been with mamma, away off." This
is all he is able to say about bis experi
ence of the past three years and now he
"wants to go home."
THE TRAGEDY AT SATICOY.
Cause ot the Suicide of Wealthy
Rancher Harrald Is Veiled in
Mr stery.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May The
suicide of William B. Herrald at his
home near Saticoy, Ventura County,
seems to have been the sequel to an un
pleasantness of a sensational nature. The
deceased owned one of the finest ranches
in Southern California, its estimated value
being $50,000. He came of good parentage
and had a brother at Abilene, Texas, who
is said to be possessed of great wealth and
to stand high in political and Masonic cir
cles. Tbis brother is now hastening from
bis home to take charge of the family and
splendid estate of tbe deceased.
It is evident that some serious affair
not apparent to the suicide's neighbors or
acquaintances must have induced his act.
He was living in comparative ease and
comfort, with all the external appearances
of perfect happiness. A knowledge of
tbese things is what astounded the en tiro
community when it was learned some
time ago that he had attempted to end
his life, for it is now asserted that Herrald
made two former attempts.
Last Saturday nigbt Herrald slipped a
shotgun out of his residence and took it
to the barn, where be discharged the con
tents of both barrels into his abdomen,
dying instantly.

CLAIMS THE BAILEY ESTATE:
Putative Son of the Late Santa Rarbara
Rancher Appears.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 3.â ln the
summer of 1873 Alexander Bailey died
near Santa Barbara, leaving ranch
property in that vicinity worth $15,000
and an estate in San Mateo County valued
at $50,000. His wife, Margaret Bailey,
was appointed executrix of the estate,
and, no other heir putting in a claim, she
took possession of all the property. In
1877 Mrs. Bailey died and her estate was
divided between a number of her rela
tives. One of these was John W. Shoulto,
a resident of Los Angeles Connty.
Now comes a young man from Arkansas
and claims to be a son of the late Alex
ander Bailey. He declares that his father
was married in Arkansas, and at the
death of vis wife moved to California,
leaving his son with an uncle. For a time
Alexander wrote from California, but
after awhile correspondence ceased. A
few mouths ago young Bailey made In
quiry of various County Clerks of this
State concerning Alexander Bailey, and
learned of his death. He will claim the
! estate. " sjjrr
SUPREME COURT DECISIONS.
Appealed Cases Lost by Iran Lui* Obi.po
and "Lucky" Haldwin.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May The fol
lowing decisions were received from the
Supreme Court this morning:
People vs. the City of San Luis Obispoâ
This action was commenced by the people
on the relation of Joseph Lind to abate an
illegal nuisance caused by the discharge
of sewage of the city into San Luis Obispo
Cr-sek. The lower court found for the
people. On appeal,- the. point was pre
sented that the decision prevented tbe de
positing of sewage not only at the point
complained of, but at any place on the ten
mile course of tbe creek to the ocean. The
judgment of the lower court was affirmed.
E. J. Baldwin lacked his usual luck in
the suit he and R. Garvev brought against
James Durfee to recover possession of two
small but valuable tracts of land. , The
defendant' pleaded the statute of limita
tion. The 'Santa Anita millionaire lost
the case and was refused a new trial in the
lower court, and suffered the same result
in the. Supreme Court.
Oil -net l* in II hit tier.
LOS ANGELES. Cal.; May The oil
region about Whittier is attracting great
attention at present. Five or six com
nies are operating there now with success.
The Central Company has live wells, one
of which is yielding 100 barrels a day ard
another seventy. The Whittier Comnany
was the first to strike oil, which it did at
the depth of 300 feet. There are also the
Rex and the Mutual companies, and the
Southern California Company, which has
thirty-six acres of land and is about to

ASHORE NEAR HARDY CREEK.
Schooner Nettie Sundborg Breaks From
Her Moorings and Is Driven Upon
the Beach.
CAHTO, Cal., May The schooner
Nettie Sundborg, Captain 0. Johnson
and a crew of ten men, from San Fran
cisco on May 1, is ashore at a point near
Hardy Creek. Tho captain and crew are
safe after having experienced a rather
perilous adventure for a time.
The schooner was moored at the Hardy
Creek Lumber Company's dock last night
preparatory to loading to-day. The
weather indications and the sea were un
favorable and Captain Johnson had taken
measures to assure that the vessel would
not break from her moorings during the
night by running two extra lines to the
bow and stern moorings. The schooner
lay at ease until low tide this morning,
when a succession of heavy swells swept j
over her, took away everything movable!
from the deck and severed the bowlines.
This permitted the vessel to swing toward
a rocky part of the beach. The sea at this
hour (5 o'clock) was running high.' "-
When the vessel broke her moorings
and it became apparent to Captain John
son that be and the crew could not handle
her, all escaped. to the rigging for safety.
The schooner was still held by her stern
lines, and it was feared that she would go
to pieces on the rocks if the lines were not
cut. Tbe captain and sailors were cling
ing to the rigging, while the heavy sea
was beating over the vessel and all at
tempts to render assistance from the shore
were of no avail. â  â 
The captain finally came down from the

CAUGHT A DRUMMER NAPPING.
Confidence Men Steal the Jewelry From
a Chicago Man's Sample
Case.
PORTLAND, Or.. May 3. â Herman
Willinbauer, a drummer for a Chicago
jewelry house, who has been on the road
for sixteen years, was caught napping for
once while coming to Portland from San
Francisco. He arrived yesterday morn
ing, and upon opening bis sample-box
found that be had been robbed.
On the train, when leaving Sacramento,
be met two other commercial travelers,
strangers to him, who made themselves
quite agreeable. At Redding one of the
two suggested that they take a drink, and
Willenbauer accepted, but tbe third man
remained in the car. At the next station
the strangers bade the drummer adieu ,
expressing a desire to meet htm in this
city in a few days.
Willenbauer does not expect to meet his
fellow-travelers face to face again until
they are in the custody of an officer. He
carried with him a trunk full of valuable
samples and also a small box containing
between $600 and $700 worth of goods.
Tbe small box, when he opened it at his
hotel yesterday, was empty, or, rather, it
was filled with small' bags of sand in lieu
of the jewelry fctolen out of it. ; " - J ; â¢'-â¢â¢
The victim has no doubt that the self
styled drummers were expert Eastern
confidence operators and that the invita
tion to drink was extended to get him out
of tbe car to enable tbe other thief to go
through his sample box. The latter must
have been provided with peculiar keys, as
the box had a tumbler lock which worked
as if it had not been tampered with when
Willenbauer opened it here.

CARSON WITNESSES
UNDER SUSPICION
Evidence of Perjury in
the Heney Mortgage
Litigation.
Judge Hawley Declares That
He Will Make a Full
Investigation.
Conflicting Stories Told by Bullion-
Thief Heney and His Former
Counsel.
CARSON, Nev., May 3.â The suit
brought by the Government to invalidate
the transfer of mortgages given by James
Heney, the convicted bullion-thief, to
Woodburn and Coffin, the attorneys who
represented him when he was on trial for
robbing the Carson mint while there em
ployed, is developing new sensations
daily. The Dnited States counsel con
tends that the mortgages were trans
ferred by Heney alter he was convicted,
his intention being to place his property
out of reach of the Government. Heney
himself declares that he entered into this
fraudulent deal with the attorneys, but
they deny the allegation, insisting that
the only mortgages they received were
tendered in payment for their services.
In court to-day Heney said he was ready
and willing to pay the $5000 fine against
him provided he could recover the mort
gages and realize upon them.
The testimony in the trial is so conflict
ing that it can De accounted for only on
the ground that, perjury is being com
mitted by some one. Judge Hawley to
day commented on this from the bench,
and alter an attorney had made a state
ment from his seat he was at once ques
tioned by the court under oath, and then
his Honor remarked that the evidence on
some points was most unsatisfactory and
that hi would make further investigations
on his own account.
Hon. William Woodburn on the stand
testified that Mrs. Heney had retained
him for the case and he acreed with
Heney that he was to be paid $-000. When
he was discharged they had a stormy in
terview, and finally he agreed to "take
$1000 for his services up to the time of
his discharge and turn over the papers to
Trenmor Coffin. He told Heney lie was
glad to get out of tne case. The next day
Heney came to him and apologized, say
ing he had done wrong, and re-employed
him. Afterward Mrs. Heney sent for him
and asked to have some of the proceeds of
the mortgages given to her. He refused,
and when offered so much cash for an as
signment of the mortgages again refused.
Hearing that United States Attorney
Jones had said that Heney would testify
that the mortgages were fraudulent,
Wood burn had called on Heney at the
prison. Heney stated that if Jones had
ever said so he told an untruth. After
the conviction of Heney Woodburn was
giveti a mortgage for $(',*.'*<Â» as his fee. He
did not know that Coffin was employed
as one of Heney's counsel until two days
before the trial. After.he war engaged he
was the principal attorney, and Coffin
assisted him. He did not know what
Coffin's fee was. His own fee had been
fixed by himself at $3500.
"Coffin has testified that one of the
mortgages was sold in California and bid
in for him for $1750. That money ought
to be here now," said Attorney-General
Clarke.
The court asked Coffin about it. Coffin
said that J. W. Dorsey ha attended to
the business, but Coffin did not know
what was done with the proceeds of the
sale. The Judge stated that he had talked
with Dorsey personally and suggested to
him to send the money to the cierk of the
court. It had not yet been sent.
Sheriff Kinney testified that Heney had
told him that he had agreed to pay
Woodburn $2000 out of the mortgages
and his wife was to get the balance. This
was after tte assignment had been made
and the lawyers had retired. He also said
that he bad agreed to piy Coffin $600.
Convict Heney was recalled in rebuttal.
He said he had Had but one talk with
Coffin about hiring him in the case, and
tnat was on the Saturday night before the
trial. Coffin agreed to lake" the case for
$500, or $600 if Heney was acquitted,
whether he was tried once or a dozen
times. He told Heney that he could sell
the $1600 mortgage to a man named Cook,
and they could divide the money, he to
get a little more than his fee for his trou
ble and Heney the balance. Continuing,
the witness said that if Woodburn would
accept $450 due him and Coffin $100 he
would take the mortgages, and wiihin
ninety days dispose of them and deposit
his $5.00 line with the cierk of the court.
He wanted the court to understand that
he made this promise in good faith.
The court here reratu-ked : "To say that
there is a great conflict of testimony here
would be putting it very mildly. The ob
ject of this inquiry is to reach the truth.
The court has the power to get additional
evidence, if possible, and so far the evi
dence is very unsatisfactory in regard to
the value of the mortgages. I desire to
cast no reflections on any witness, but I
believe the facts can be arrived at. If any
agreement is made by counsel, I want it
qualified in such a way that the court will
i. aye the power to refer the case for future
evidence, if necessary, and the court
would make some personal investigations
regarding some matters'which need more
light than the court has yet received."
Some testimony of minor importance
was introduced, and the case was closed.
It will be argued next Saturday.

are good for grazing.
"Let my people have them. We can

DRYING POTATOES
FOR THE MARKET
New Industry Opened
to the Owners of
Canneries.
Great Demand for the Product
of a San Jose Packing-
House.
Bleached Tubers Find a Ready Sale,
and Orders Are Coming
In Fast.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 3.â The Penni
man Fruit Company has instituted a new
industry at its drier in the Willowsâ that
of drying potatoes. This .promises to
prove profitable for Santa Clara County,
and as soon as the run on potatoes is over
carrots and turnips will be dried. A
force of twenty persons is engaged, and it
is believed the run on potatoes will last
another month.
The work of preparation is very simple.
Apple-parers are used in peeling the pota
toes, and slicing is next in order. The
potatoes are tben pressed, and about 10
per cent of the water is removed in tbis
way. As tbe starch is extracted from this
water there is no waste. Evaporating
and bleaching is done in practically the
same manner as in the drying of fruits.
After leaving the press the potatoes are
subjected to a temperature of 100 to 120
degrees in the evaporator. It has been
found that a temperature in excess of 120
degrees discolors them, but at that beat
they retain their color, and when taken
out have the appearance of the green
product.
The dried potatoes can be eitber boiled
or fried and will be sure to please all
classes of people except those who insist
on having their potatoes served with
"jackets on." One great advantage of the
dried product is that it can be kept on
shipboard for an indefinite period.
The potatoes are being shipped to a San
Francisco commission house. It is ex
pected that the output will reach 30,000
pounds by May 20. In all about 80,000
pounds of potatoes will be dried, which in
the green state would be 400,000 pounds,
as the drying procsss takes away four
fifths of the weight. This leaves all the
nutritiousness of the potato in a compact
form. The originators of the process be
lieve that there will soon be a great de
mand for dried potatoes and that in a short
time dried vegetables of numerous kinds
will be found in every market.

Ex- M ivster to Hay ti. Tells of a Conces-
sion He Was About to Secure When
Requested to Resign. 7
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 3.-The
United States has, according , to" Henry
M. Smythe, ex-Minister 'to /Hayti,
probably lost a concession from the re
public of San Domingo for the establish
ment of a coaling station at Samana Bay
or some other convenient harbor.
Minister Smythe is no longer the Gov
ernment's accredited representative to
either of these republics, and is now in
Virginia very much exasperated because
bis resignation was accepted before he had
time to complete, the main features of a
treaty whereby San Domingo eranted,
free of charge,' a site for a coaling station
and several ot'.ier commercial privileges
for which this country has been working
for years. He now declares that he will
not surrender the protocol to the depart
ment. *. .. -. :'. > 'JrJlJ':
-No one has as yet been appointed Min
ister, and as there is not much of ' a. con
test for the place Smythe may be con
tinued after all in office until the protocol
for the possession of the coaling station is
completed. Smythe says:
"In San Domingo last March the Presi
dent submitted a memorandum embracing
the following heads for a treaty: Com
merce, navigation, extradition and reci
procity of interest and concession. Under
this last division, at my second inter
view, I obtained from the President a
concession for a coaling station for use of
the American navy during the continu
ance of the treaty on the sole condition
that coaling facilities be allowed the
Dominican navy in American ports. He
also asks for the removal of import duties
on sugar, practically an, American indus
try, which cannot exist under present
conditions."
.The acquisition of some Island of the
West Indies for a coaling station has been
recognized by naval experts as necessary,
and it is believed that if Denmark were
pressed she would sell the little island of
St. Croix for a reasonable sum. Next to
a coaling station in the West Indies,
naval experts have contended that one
in Hawaii is second in importance. There
is now available in the treasury $300,000
for the establishment of a coaling station,
which can be used on the one proposed at
Pearl Harbor. This same money could
be devoted, however, to Samaua station if
Smythe is restored to office and given a
chance to complete bis negotiations.
WHAT WILL THE VERDICT BE?
Romeyn Trial Ended and Result Dis-
patched to General Merritt.
ATLANTA, Ga.. May The Romeyn
court-martial completed its work at noon
to-day, and two hours later, after secret
deliberation, reached a conclusion and
dispatched it to General Merritt, bead of
the Department ot the East. Just what
the verdict i 3 no person outside of the offi
cial thirteen has any definite knowledge
of, but speculation all extends on the line
of either absolute acquittal for Romeyn
or his exoneration on the body of the
charges and a reprimand for his share in
the parade-ground episode. The judi*e
advocate "and Komeyn for the defense
summed up tbeir, respective sides this
morning, adding nothing of importance to
the evidence already adduced. . *.'.. .*-
It is charged that Lieutenants Bamford,
O'Bren and Martin and Captain Carter,
both previous to and during the trial,
have violated the articles of war, the pen
alty for which is court-martial, but the
members composing the board have pro
nounced the task of further investigation
into this complicated web impossible for
military court. V";.-;. - .
Both the official family at the garrison
and its friends are uneasily awaiting lur
ther movements on the part of the Wash
ington authorities, for no one believes,
after what has been brought to light by
the court-martial, that the War Depart
ment can afford to Ignore conditions pre
vailing at the post. ...
FIGHT WITH C. .TILE- EVES.
Three Out of a Giny of Five Wounded
and Captured.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.. May 3.â The
cow-punchers of Indian Territory are run
ning off farmers' stock at an alarming
rate. Eariy this morning a drove was in
tercepted by farmers near Eufala and an
effort made to kill the five men in charge
of it. .'
About twenty-five shots were fired and
three of the thieves fell from their horses.
The other two escaped. Jerry Wilson, one
of the farmers, had his horse killed ana
received a dangerous wound in the shoul
der. P. A. Berry, another. farmer, was
shot in the right thigh. Several less dan
gerous wounds were sustained -by the
others. . :*.',, or -j
Two of the wounded men proved to be
half-breed Choctaw Indians living near
the neighborhod, while the third was
Henry Hennessey, an outlaw wanted at
Fort Smith on a charg** of murder. The
cattle were taken to Webbers Falls and
shipped from there to members of the
gang residing in this city, where they

TWELVE MILLIONS
FOR THIS RAILWAY
Sale of the Atlantic and
Pacific Line at
Gallup.
Bid in by a Representative of
the Santa Fe Board of
Directors.
Many Improvements Projected, but
Officials Will Not Be
Chanced.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., May. 3.-At
the Atlantic and Pacific Railway sale in
Gallup to-day the property was bid in
for $12,000,000 by Aldace F. Walker, chair
man of the board of diroctors for the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe and of
the general purchasing committee of the
Santa Fe's system.
The special car containing Chairman
Walker and party arrived in Albuquerque
Saturday night. They spent Sunday bere
overlooking the Santa Fe's varied interests
and conferring with leading citizens about
the 'improvements under project. Early
tbis morning the special left for Gallup.
Very little interest was taken in the sale in
tbat city. The citizens knew that the
Santa Fe was already the practical owner
of the Atlantic and Pacific and that th-**
sale was a mere ceremony. It passed off
quietly and after a short stay in the city
the special returned to Albuquerque, ar
riving tbis evenine.
That the* Santa Fe has under view the
centralization of the shops and offices at
one main point is acknowledged, but
when this will commence is not known.
This city seems to be the favored one.
Many additions will be made to the shops
here and it is more than probable that 400
men will be added to tbe payrolls. J
There will not be many changes made
in tne working officials of the road. Every
thing west of this city will be under the
general superintendency of A. G. Wells.
This will also include the Calilornia
Southern. .. :r \-J : AJi A'':A\ *"â '.-
From this city to Seligman, Ariz., C. R.
Perry will be division superintendent.
From Seligman to San Bernardino John
Denair will be division superintendent. G.
Beamer will be division superintendent
over the territory between San Bernardino
and Los Anzeles.
Lo- Angeles will be the headquarters
for the auditing department, which will
be under the charge of W. E. Walsh. In
Los Angeles also will be the headquarters
fos the general passenger and ticket de
partment, under the charge of J. J. Byrne.

to the Frontier, Feuding Settlement
of the Boundary Dispute.
NEW YORK, N. V., May The Her

- seemingly authentic report that the Gov
! ernment of Costa Rica, in order to be
ready for an emergency, is preparing to
send immediately 2000 men to the Nica
raguan frontier pending a decision of the
boundary dispute. ..-*,,*
President Zelaya of Nicaragua now has
several hundred troops stationed on the
frontier. Of these troops 400 are scattered
in small groups between tbe frontier
towns. In San Juan 150 men are await
ing orders, 200 in Chinanadega, 200 in
Leon and a like number in Granada.
Rivas has also been strengthened by sev
eral hundred soldiers.
Ali this activity may result in hostili
ties. Nicaragua is dominated by the fear
of invasion, as Government officials have
received private advices stating that a
movement of that kind is being pushed.
The leaders, it is said, are men who have
been exiled from Nicaragua,' _ 'jfjjj

COMFORT IN JAIL
â 
Occupies the Women's
Cell in the Marin
Prison.
Sheriff Harrison Questioned
as to Favoritism Shown
His Guest.
â¢;â  Contempt Proossdlngs Asainst the
Millionaire's Jailer Again
Continued.
RAW RAFAEL, Cal., May 3.â Colonel
Peter A. Finnegan, the wealthy prisoner in
Marin County Jail, occupies the women's
Sll in the prison. So said Sheriff Henry
arriion this afternoon from the witness
stand In the Superior Court, when he was
being examined on an order to show cause
why he should not be adjudged guilty of
contempt for conferring npon Millionaire
* Finnegan too manyfavois since the latter'
confinement in the county jail for refusing
to comply with Judge Angelotti's orders
to pay $750 as alimony to bis wife, who is
suing him for a divorce.
Sheriff Harrison filed an affidavit this
â  . morning, in which he denied all the alle
â¢ cations made by T. i. Crowley, attorney
for Mrs. Finnegan. Crowley had alleged
that Finnegan was not confined in tbe jail
proper, bnt occupied a room in the base
ment of the courthouse, furnished by
himself! that Finnegan was not locked up,
and was free to go where he pleased.
On the witness-stand this afternoon
the attorney asked the Sheriff if it was
not a fact that Finnegan was occupying a
room in the basement of the courthouse.
The Sheriff denied this, but stated that
the cell had originally been intended for
women prisoners, so Colonel Peter A.
Finnegan, mine-owner and horseman, is
occupying the "ladies' " cell. The Sheriff
stated that Finnegan was locked in the
prison ceil, but that any person who
"knew the ropes" could draw the bolt and
'.. walk into the colonel's present home at
. any time.
Judge Angelotti said that the manner in
" which Sheriff Harrison had kept Colonel
Finnegan in his custody was hardly a com
pliance with the order of commitment.
Sheriff Harrison had said that he con
sidered the millionaire in the county jail
at any time since he had been in his cus
. tody, although he had been allowed to go
with Under-Sheriff Hannon across the
street to a restaurant.
The matter went over until May 13,
when other testimony will be introduced
by both sides. Under-Sheriff John Han
non, who has charge of the jail, will be
examined as to the freedom the million
. aire enjoyed while in his custody, and
'.â  other witnesses will be produced to show
that Finnegan had too much of a good

FIFTEEN HUNDRED GAIN
The Estimated increase in the
Number of School
Children.
School Directors Now in Accord With
Superintendent Webster end the
Census League.
Superintendent of Schools Webster esti
mates, from a careful study of the work
of the school census takers, just com
pleted, that the census will snow an in
crease of school children of 1500 over last
year.
" The work of checking up the figures of
the canvassers is yet in progress and will
. not be finished for several days, but the
increase will vary very little from the es
timates made by Mr. Webster.
The Board of Education has come to the
- Superintendent's idea regarding the le
gality of the census and has taken such
. steps as will place the matter beyond
question.
â¢ Two of the directors called on Mr. Web
ster yesterday and stated that legal advice
had been taken, and the result had been
"an opinion from the attorney that the
Superintendent's position was correct;
that in order to make the census legal the
â  census-takers must file their oaths of of
fice with the Superintendent and be ap
proved by him. This was one of the legal
.forms insisted on by Mr. Webster before
*. he- would consent to approve the result of
the canvass. Without this approval the
canvass would be useless.
To straighten the whole matter out the
hoard admitted that Secretary Welch was
a member of the Superintendent's staff.
As t- c oaths of office were filed with Mr.
Welch the admission mentioned settles
- the complication that threatened to make
. trouble all around.
Mr. Webster says that the census has
been taken with unusual care and that it
will be, when finished, the most correct
â¢ and thorough canvass that has been made
in years. . '
In many cases where school children re
ported that census-takers bad not visited
their homes it was found that they were
mistaken, as the names appeared in the
canvasser's field book. , . . .
The Superintendent will sign tbe salary
demands of the men now that the legal
obstacles have been overcome.
RADER IS PRESIDENT.
Congregational Monday Clnb Honors
the Pastor of the Third Church.
The Congregational Monday Club set its
seal of approbation on Rev. William Ra
dar yesterday by electing him president of
that club. Whether there was any dis- j
cussion over the election outsiders were
not informed, for it has become the rule
with the clnb lately to hold its meetings
with closed doors and jealously ke p
secret everything but routine business. It
is understood, however, that a large ma
jority of the pastors in the club are
strongly in favor of supporting Rev. Mr.
Rader against any strictures that may be
passed upon his orthodoxy by Christian
Endeavorers in the East.
The subject of Dr. Rader's orthodoxy or
otherwise was not formally discussed at
any of the other Monday ministerial
meetings, but it was spoken of a great
deal among the ministers in the course of
conversation. Rev. F. Farrand, in the
course of some remarks on the subject,
said:
"The matter is to be deplored, for a
nnmber of Eastern religious papers are
advising Christian Endeavorers not to
come to the California convention on ac
count of Mr. Rader's unorthodoxy ooupled
with his prominent connection with the
Christian Endeavor Convention here. I
do not see how this can fail to injure the
convention."
GOLDBERG IS MISSING.
He Made All His Usual Collec
tions Last Steamer
Day.
Ssveral Hay Firms Anxious Over His
Sadden Leave-Taking While
in Their Debt.
The sudden disappearance of David
Goldberg, a young business man who had
conducted a hay and grain store at 317
Seventh street, has been the cause of a
subdued wonder to those who had known
him.
Goldberg had been in the employ of
Barg & Eileen at 526 Seventh street until
the Ist of last October, when he left their
service and joined bis father. Max Gold
berg, in a feedstore at the number men
tioned.
About six months ago the firm of Gold
berg failed and a compromise with the
creditors was made, after which the son
conducted the business in his own name,
dealing with such firms as his former em
ployers. Anspacher & Bros., Scott & Mc-
Cord, W. W. Chase & Co. and C. S. Healey.
Those firms gave the young man credit to
a limited extent, not over $500 in any one
instance.
Last Wednesday young Goldberg started
out to make collections from his custom
ers, with the understanding â so far as the
creditors know â of calling on them during
the day and liquidating his indebted
ness. But, to the.r disappointment, be
failed to find their offices up to yesterday
afternoon.
Since he made his collections on
Wednesday he has not been seen by any
one who knows him. At first it was
thought be had met with foul play and
might have been robbed of bis collec
tions. But this fear has been dispelled by
the attitude of his parents over his failure
to return. No call has been made upon
the police, and, as far as is known, his
father has lost no night's rest searching
for him.
Before his departure, however, it is un
derstood he assigned the greater portion
of his woridly goods over to his mother.
If this be the case the creditors will have
nothing to levy upon to secure them.

The opening game at the Alameda Base
ball Park on Sunday between the San
Francisco Athletic Club and the Alameda
Alerts resulted in a victory for the former
by Â«i score of 3 to 2.
Over 2000 people witnessed the game,
and, as it was an excellent exhibition, it
augurs well for baseball in Alameda.
Krug pitched an excellent game for
the Alerts. He had fifteen strike-outs to
his credit, which is record twirling.
Raymond's delivery was all that could
be desired. The Alerts were only able to
get five hits off him, and he showed rare
judgment in playing his position.
One of the features was a grand-stand
catch by Spellman.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 4, 1897.
DE WOLF HOPPER
AGAIN IN TOWN
â 
Expresses Satisfaction at
His Welcome in a
Speech.
The Bohemian C lib Turns Out
in Force to Honor Denis
O'Suliivan.
Ward and Yokes Continue to Be a
Eraw at the Columbiaâ "East <-.
Lynne" at the Aicazir.
In a few days every gallery-boy in
town will probably be tramping round on
his daily avocations to a whistled accom
paniment of selections from "El Capitan,"
the comic opera by Charles Klein and
Sousa, which the De Wolf Hopper Com
pany produced last night at the Baldwin
Theater. 'Â« rjJJ
There was a packed and fashionable
audience to greet the big comedian, his
dainty little wife and their new operetta,
and all three came in for a deserved share
of the honors. The opera is just the sort
that hits the popular taste on the most
casual acquaintance, the action and fun
are original and never flag, the music is
bright and catchy, the staging is posi
tively brilliant, and last but not least, De
Wolf Hopper and Edna Wallace Hopper ,
have pans that suit them admirably.
In his make-up De Wolf Hopper has,
evidently taken a wrinkle from the pict
ures of Don Quixote, and it is easy to be
lieve that the librettist had the Knight of
the Rueful Countenance also in his mind
when lie imagined the character of El
Capitan, for that worthy is a sort of comic
edition of Don Quixote.
The story, whicb adapts itself well to
picturesque staging, is supposed to pass
in Peru during the sixteenth century.
The recently appointed Viceroy, in con
stant dread of assassination, hides himself
from his new subjects, who rise in rebel
lion and capture his palace. The Vice
roy solves the immediate difficulty by
posing as "El Capitan," a famous leader
of the rebels, but terrible complications
ensue, for the Viceroy ls very much mar
ried, and Estrelda. the daughter of the
rebel Viceroy, falls in love with him and
tries to lead the reluctant El Capitan to
the altar, in the very teeth of his own
wife, who does not dare to declare his
identity.
A large part of the plot consists of El
Capitans harrowing experiences among
the rebels. De Wolf Hopper enters heart
and soul into the comic agony of the situ
ations, which are made more absurd by
his assumed valor and his ridiculously
uncouth appearance.
Edna Wallace Hopper, graceful and
snrightly as ever, makes a fascinating
Estreida, and the guileless way in which
she thrusts her unsought love upon El
Capitan adds hugely to the fun of the
perlormance.
The music that Sousa has written round
this sparkling libretto is all that one would
expect of the march king. It is catchy
and tuneful, makes one think of the park
on a Sunday, and in its most melodious
moments almost smells of fresh roasted
peanuts and popcorn.
It is almost impossible to resist hum
ming "El Capitan's" march, "You See in
Me," to the jingle of the cars on the way
home.
The new prima donna, Nella Bugan, is
De Wolf Hopper, Who Made a
Hit in "El Capitan" Last
Evening*.
a remarkably beautiful woman, and she
sings prettily, though, barring Hopper
himself, no one in the company is over
burdened with voice.
Little Alfred Klein has a good part as
the Viceroy's chamberlain and general
factotnm, and he plays bis role with his
old-time air of a comic martyr.
The rest of the cast is good and the
chorus girls are young, pretty and pos
sessed of a good volume oi voice.
A perfect ovation was given the stars,
and Hopper rashly promised a "glittering
speech later on," when he was called out
at the end of the first act. The audience
bore the promise in mind, and later on
Hopper was compelled to deliver quite an
oration, but he firmly resisted saying his
littie piece, "Casey at the Bat,"
-<ff "V At the Alcazar.
In reviving "East Lynne" the management
of the, Alcazar Then ter played a trump card
If liberal applause goes for anything. '"
The whole company received curtain calls
after every act. Adele Belgarde does the best
work she has done at this house as Lsdv Isabel.
The part is a trying one, for it is difficult to
play such au emotional role and not overdo it.
Irs. F. M. Bates does her usual good work as
Cornelia. Thouirh Cornelia is a decidedly dis
agreeable character, she gets all the laughs
there are to be had out of a naturally teartul
play. Wm&i *'.-'â 'â ' â â <;â â â 
George Osbourne gives an unusually strong
performance as Archibald Carlyle, and Hugo
Toland as Francis -Levlson is the conventional
society villain. The rest of the company are
well cast. ' â 
Grand Opera-House,
Another spectacular comedy-drama opened
at Morosco's last night to a well-filled house.
"An American Hero" is the title of the play,
and as usual the hero.ln the person of Mortimer
Snow, assumes disguises by the wholesale
and rescues the heroine trom the most impos
sible situation**, to the great delight of the
gallery gods. Baby L^wis delights all by her
clever dancing, and Mollie Thompson and Nat
Willis contribute some rather good special
ties. ''^Sm^SsgSSsm^SS^SSSEd^ssss^^--.
One ot the most realistic shipwrecks ever
seen in this City occurs at the close of the sec
ond act. ,
Maud Edna Hall, one of the most popular
leading ladies who has ever been at the Grand,
will make her reappearance with the stock
company on the 17th, as Lady Isabel in "East
Lynne. '*
Tivoli Opera- House.
Another deluge of Mr. O'Suliivan' friend*
turned out and completely filled every nook
and corner of the . Tivoli last night. The,
Bohemian Club was there 100 strong and
loudly applauded all that was done or said,
and at the close of the second act fairly
smothered Mr. O'Suliivan with flowers.
Maurice Darcy's Miles Murphy has made a
decided hit. It Is the first really good oppor
tunity he has had since he joined the com
pany and he is undoubtedly making the best
of it. '-â  â â 'â â â 'â â â 'â â 
The music of "Shamus O'Brien" grows pret
tier at each hearing. In fact 11 Mr O'sulli
van's friends hold out "Shamus O'Biien" will
have a long and prosperous run.
At the Orpheum.
' The Orpheum has a host of novelties on this
week, besides retaining many of the attrac
tive features of the week gone by. Signor
â¢ Achile Alberte and Mme. Annina Orlandi, the
grand opera stars; Marzelo and Millay, the
grotesque bar performers and burlesque
wrestlers, and that very clever colored team,
Al and Mamie A-iderron, have not yet lost
their power to please. Fleurette and her four
fleurs-de-lis, otherwise a clever little dancer,
and ber four blonde choristers, gave what tbe I
Programme calls "the latest sensation from
Paris."
If this be so. to startle Paris all that is re
quired is fetching gowns, nimble toes and
rasping voices. However, San Francisco's
taste and that of the gay and giddy capital
seem to be similar, and Fleurette and the
fleurs-de-lis, judging by their last night's re
ception, have captured the Western me
tropolis.
Another great card on the programme ls
Ml c. Anl, the marvelous gymnast, whose
thrilling performa- cc lacks none of the beauti
ful. Taken altogether this week's Orpheum
offering is of the best, with variety to suit all
tastes and Inclinations.
At the Auditorium.
Fortunate it is for Mrs. Dimond that the
regulated temperature of the Auditorium
stsgo possesses none of those changes for
yÂ»CE.PR|iSip'ENT W.G.CUPTIS
which this great and glorious climate of Cali
fornia is justly noted. Otherwise might the
dread pneumonia claim the massive Carrie
for its own and San Francisco suffer the loss
ot an erstwhile society lady wno hopes to
elevate (?) the stage and incidentally line her
pocket with shekels. It is an interesting audi
ence that assembles to spur the divorcee on
in her chosen career. One almost sees the
fair admirer who, by the way, brings her off
spring to the play, turn over the leaves of her
book of etiquette and with puzzled brow look
to see how- the blonde representative of the
island 400 smiles and bends and says "Thank
you," and "On, dear me!" .To master, the
aciress' frozen smile in . response to ... the
clamorous demands for an encore is as much
as those imitators need to be immediately
welcomed into the ranks of the select. .*â â¢'â 
Mra Dimond'a theatrical sway is apparently
all smooth and even. True to the Instinct of
the caste she lias deserted, nothing annoys or
astonishes the lady. Bhe summons her fairy at
tendants with the easy grace of the lady who
\ accepts her thimbleful of chocolate at an after
noon tea, and demands the extermination of
ali her enemies as evenly a3 she orders mush
for the next day's breakfast. Neither exertion
nor execution", for that matter, is ' Mrs.
Dimond's mission on the stage. She la there
to snow herself, and in that she offers all she
generously promised.
Columbia Theater.
Another large house last night showed that
the fun made by Ward and Yokes continues to
be as much appreciated as ever. Several new
songs were introduced and "caught on" with
the audience.
At the Chutes.
The Chutes have a long list of attractions,
which are presented on the open air stage
every afternoon and evening. The coyote
family, three-legged horse and monkey cages
all have a large and interested following.
During May there will be no admission charged

PILING UP A
SURPLUS FUND
Prosperous Condition of
Railroad Employes'
Association.
Unusual Financial Gains Made
During the Year Just
Past
Interesting D.bate Over a Proposition
for a New Assessment
Policy.
Remarkable prosperity was enjoyed
during the past year by the Central and
Southern Pacific Railroad Employes' Mu
tual Benefit Association, as shown by the
oaEbifcENT C.B.RVAtr.||ij
financial statement submitted at the sev
enteenth . annual meeting in tbe , Hobart
building yesterday.
The result was the more gratifying, as
the previous year had been one of the
most trying in the existence of the or
ganization, it having been necessary to
pay out no less than $15,000 on beneficiary
certfiicates. Despite this drain, however,
there was a net gain of nearly $3000 dur
ing 1895-96. This year the gain was nearly
$13,000, and the association now has
$81,400 as a surplus fund. r-yjk
This large sum is out at interest in the
hands of the Southern Pacific Company, ,
which is the treasurer of the association,
and the income from it, some members
believe, will largely help to maintain tbo
institution. With this idea in mind,
some of the men in C. J. Wilder's depart
ment at the meeting yesterday proposed
that the interest income shall be applied
to the payment of death benefits and
other expenses, and that tne assessments
of members shall be accordingly reduced.
A long and interesting debate followed,
but the proposition was lost by a vote of
326 against and 150 in favor of it. It is be
lieved that the suggestion will be submit*
ted by the directors at tbe next meeting,
and many who voted against it this time
owing to it having been proposed without
previous notice will vote for it then. Tbe
older and conservative members are op
posed to any change. They claim that
many of the members are now getting
along in years; that the drain will event
ually get heavier, and that the amounts
now being paid ,in by members will be
necessary to â¢ keep the association in a
sound financial condition.
All the officers were re-elected as fol
lows: President, E. B. Ryan; vice-presi
dent, W. G. Curtis; treasurer, Southern
Pacific Company; secretary, Mrs. Anna
Cummins; counsel, J. E. Foulds.
The membership numbers about 880, ft
considerable gain during tbe year. -J.-'-jy

It is asserted that fakers in New York
did a great business during the celebration
attending the aedication of the Grant
mausoleum by selling bricks as souvenirs
of the occasion. They claimed that the

great tomb was finished, and no ordinary

A man accused in a New York court of
beating his wife pleaded in justification
that she was addicted to "cabin-hunting,"
and when the amazed magistrate asked
what that meant he explained that it was

have therefore a new vice and a new word
for it and our manners and oar language
are to that extent enriched.
According to the New York Press -"am

shell, cut glass. And roulette parties are
becoming commoner than poker parties."
From all of which it is evident that New

gamey -and is very close to the spoiling

OUR SHIPPING INTERESTS.
From the tone and temper of the East
ern press it is evident that as soon as the
tariff bill is out of the way the attention
of Congress will be called to tho shipping
interests of the country and the urgent
need of building up a merchant marine
capable of carrying at least the larger por
tion of our entire foreign commerce. Many
of the most influential papers in the larger
cities are actively agitating the question
and there can be no doubt they reflect the
sentiments of a large and powerful por
tion of the people.
A recent article in the American Econo
mist containing an elaborate review of the
subject points out that while in 1845 fully
81 per cent of all American ocean carried
exports and imports were handled in
American ships, in the year ending June
30, 1895, American vessels carried exports
and imports valued at only $170,500,000 out
of a total trade of $1,456,000,000, or only
11.7 per cent of the whole. If we had car
ried in 1895 the same percentage that we
carried in 1845, fifty years before, the
value of goods carried in American ships
would have been $1,176,360,000. This
shows a loss in value handled by Ameri
cans of $1,005,860,000 in one year.
The drain thus made upon our resources
by the cost of importing and exporting in
foreign ships is enormous, ln a recent
address at a conference of shipbuilders
and shipowners in Washington Charles
H. CramD estimated that we pay about
$150,000,000 a year in gold chiefly to tbe
English for carrying on our foreign com
merce for us. This foreign tribute is one
of the worst which is imposed upon
American industry, for it carries out
money for which we get no goods in re
turn. It has been going on as an ever
increasing* burden for upward of fifty
years and it is certainly full time that it
should be stopped.
The American Economist very strikingly
â¢ays that as a result of this loss of the
ocean carrying trade on our part and its
gain by England "the true boundary line
of England is at New York and San Fran
cisco and every port of entry on the At
lantic and Pacific Ocean. English ships
convey nearly every bushel of wheat ex
ported from Oregon and California; Eng
lish ships carry an exceedingly large per
centage of all American exports from At
lantic ports. Wherever American products
are transferred to a ship carrying an Eng
| lish flag there the dominion of the Repub
lic ends and there the jurisdiction of Eng
l land begin"."
The people of the Pacific Coast, and par
ticularly those of San Francisco, have
abundant reason for cordially supporting
the Eastern movement for the revival of
our merchant marine. We have fully as
much, and possibly even more, to gain
from success in the work than have the
people of the East. Any measure, there
fore, which promises a prompt upbuilding
of our shipping interests can count upon
tne support or the Pacific Coast and the
votes of at least all of the Republicans in
our Congressional delegation.
THE FLOOD OF IMPOSTS.
Events attending the revision of the
tariff afford another illustration of the old
familiar maxim, "No one can make an
omelette without breaking eggs." Whiio
Congress is deliberating on the new sched
ules to be adopted the importers are busy
in bringing in foreign goods under the ex
isting duties so as to obtain the advantage
which will accrue when the duties are
raised.
Reports from our special correspondent
at Washington published yesterday are to
the effect that the statistics of the Treas
ury Department justify the conclusion
that foreign goods are being brought into
the country so rapidly there is likely to be
nearly a year's supply on hand when the
new tariff goes into effect. The retroac
tive clause of the bill adopted by the
House seems to have had little or no effect
on the imports, as the importers have
reached the conclusion that either it will
be stricken out by the Senate or else be
declared invalid by the courts. At any
rate, they are acting in the belief that if
the clause proves to be inoperative they
will gain by making their importations
now, and if it should be sustained they
will not lose much by going ahead in
stead of waiting until after the bill is en
acted.
As a result of these conditions the im
portations for April have been phenome
nally large. The total imports last
August amounted to less than $50,000,000.
In December they rose to $59,000,000, while
for the last month they reached the great
' sum of $50,000,000. It is also noted that
the increase has been particularly largo in
non-dutiable articles, showing that the
importers are taking every advantage of
the free list of the Wilson tariff in order
to obtain large profits when the protective
measure comes into force.
This increasing flood of imports very
naturally causes uneasiness in commer
cial and industrial circles, and will un
doubtedly have a bad effect upon the
country for some time to come. It will
largely counteract the good effects of pro
tection for many months, possibly for a
whole year, and prevent American pro
ducers from receiving the full benefit the
measure is intended to provide. In spite
of all this, however, it would be unfair to
accuse the Senate of any undue delay In
enacting the bill. A tariff, if it is to be
equally beneficial as a revenue bill and as
a protective measure, dealing equally with
all the diverse interests of the country,
must be carefully and deliberately con
sidered.
The West has important interests which
were not fully protected in the bill as it
passed the House, and we must look to
the Senate to protect them. This we
have every reason to believe the Senate
will do. and bad as may be the effects of
the large importations from abroad it
would be better to stand them for a time
and perfect a good tariff bill rather than
to make undue haste and impose upon
the country a measure which wonld be in
adequate to its permanent welfare. We !
can never have rest from tariff legislation
and trade disturbances until that legisla- !
tion has been settled by being settled \
right, and any deliberation necessary. to
that end will not bo on the whole dis
advantageous to the people. .'â¢
IN GOOD HANDS.
The net results of tbe Pure-Food Con
gress in this City were the manifestation
of an earnest public sentiment in favor of
preventing the sale of adulterated foods
and an arrangement for organizing the
work by entrusting it to the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association and to
the various Boards of Health throughout
the State. These results amply justified
the assembling of the convention and
afford a basis for believing that the cru
sade for pure food will be conducted to a
speedy success. * */*:-.*:
The various addresses delivered before
the convention clearly prove the evils
which adulterations do to our trade as
well as to the health of our people. With
that evidence to work upon it ought not
to be difficult to awaken the attention
even of citizens who have hitherto been
indifferent to the subject, and convince
them that it ia to then interest and wel

fare to give support to those who are
actively engaged in the difficult task of
suppressing the wrong.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has been so successful in nil other
work it has undertaken that the public
can look forward with hopefulness for suc
cess in the new enterprise. It will have
strong and potent allies in the Boards of
Health, for these also have shown in many
instances their value to the communities
in which they work and their efficiency in
the performance of the duties entrusted
to them. J;'ir_ '-J'J
While it is satisfying to know that the
work has been thu3 entrusted to safe
hands, this satisfaction should not lead
either the press or the public to neglect
the subject or cease to give it close atten
tion. In the very nature of things neither
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation nor the Boards of Health can ac
complish mucb/unless they are supported
by resolute public opinion. The work so
fairly begun should be prosecuted vigor
ously to the end, even if it should be
necessary to follow the example of the
New York Dairymen's Association and
appeal to Congress for assistance in pro
tecting California brands when once those
brands have been made guarantees of
pure food in every package on which they
are placed. 'J'r'yyyJyJ'JJj
LOCAL HISTORY.
Considerable attention is being given in
the East to a local history which has been
prepared in Brookline, Mass., for introduc
tion into the public schools of that city.
The object of the book is to maKe the
children acquainted With the munici
pality and to interest them in all its fea
tures, scientific, historical and political. -
From accounts given in the Boston pa
pers, it appears that the local history be
gins with an account of the geography of
tne city of Brookline and its relation to
other important centers of the State.
! Next the geology of the town is treated
and information is given concerning the
processes of the formation of its soil. This
is followed by a description of the natural
flora and fauna of the surrounding dis
tricts, so that the child is made acquainted
with the general characteristics of his
locality and its natural productions.
After the scientific chapters of the book
the history of tho town is taken up and
an account is given of its foundation and
development, and also of all old and note
worthy buildings which it possesses.
Along with these is a record of services
rendered to the community by distin
guished citizens, and brief biographies of
ihose men of the community who at
tained a National eminence.
All this serves to prepare the way for
an exposition of the method by which the
town is governed in ali its departments.
Children in the public schools are taught
how elections are held, officers selected,
and all public work performed. The in
formation is, of course, of direct advantage
in training them for their future duties as
citizens and forms a good groundwork on
[ which to base in further studies a knowl
! edge of the general history of the United
States and its constitution.
So warmly has the Brookline experi
ment been commended that it is almost
certain similar courses, of instruction in
local history will soon be adopted in other
cities of the East. While it is generally
recoenized that our public schools are
being overburdened with studies, yet it is
believed they might well adopt the study
of local history even if some other
were crowded out to make way for it.
There can be no question of the value of
such instruction to the youth of American
cities, and the subject merits consideration
in San Francisco as well as in the East.

PALACE CARS DECAYING.
Philadelphia Record.
On a railroad siding 'our miles above Holli
daysburg stand thirty-two Pullman palace
cars, closely guarded day and night by watch
men whose only duty is to see that no one
interferes with the process of decay and des
poliation which the elements have inaugu
rated. The cars are the property of the Penn
rylvanla Railroad Company and represent an
outlay oi about $400,000. These handsome
coaches have been dragged through the slow
and tortuous process , of litigation for over
five years. Both the railroad and the Pullman
Company have claims on the cars, and until a
final decision is rendered in the courts these
magniflcent vehicles of travel by rail are left
to rot and crumble in the open air, exposed to
all kinds of weather, and will soon ba unfit for
any use except kindling wood and old scrap

MARSHAL TOWE
AS A SPRINTER
He Is Outrun by Lee John,
a Chinese Incen
diary.
Polios and C tizsns Jcin in the
Chase, but Without
Success. â¢Â»
The Chinese Sat Fire to a Lodging-
Hcnse Where he Lived, at
gig Cay Stree*.
It is seldom that a Chinese can be ac
cused of incendiarism, but Fire Marshal
Towe has on hand a case at present and
yesterday he chased and nearly captured
the firebug. ]â 'â  JrJ_
Friday night, shortly before 10 o'clock,
there was a still alarm for a fire in a two
story frame building, 919 Clay street,
owned by the Luning estate, and occupied
by Urbin Husson as a lodging-house.
Mrs. Husson was the first to discover the
.fire, being awakened from her sleep by the
smoKe. It was in a room occupied by
John L**e, alias Lee John, alias Lee Law,
a Chinese, and his wife. She told her hus
band, and he succeeded in extinguishing
the flames.
A lot of empty boxes had been piled in
a corner of the room and saturated with
coal oil, and a gallon can of oil with the
top off had been placed on top of tho
boxes, which had been set on Are.
The case was reported to the Fire Mar
shal yesterday morning, and on going to
the house he learned that Lee had insured
the clothing and furniture in the room on
April 8 for |300. The furniture belonged
to tb c landlord and last Tuesday Lee's
wife took away all the clothing, Lee tell
ing the landlady tbat bis wife was going
away on a visit to tbe country. All that
was left was two hats and an empty
trunk.
Lee continued to sleep there, and as he
owed $3 for a month's rent, tbe landlady,
Friday evening, asked him for the money,
and he gave her $1 on account. As soon
as the family retired to bed, Lee, it is sup
posed, piled up the boxes, saturated them
with coal oil, set fire to the pile and then
quietly slipped out. He did not return to
the house.
The landlady was not insured and the
Fire Marshal estimates ber loss at $75 and
th*.' loss to the building at $50. If the fire
bad not been discovered in time the prob
ability is that three grown-up persons
and a baby who were asleep in tee upper
story might have perished, as tne flames
from Lee's room would have cut off the
only means of escape by the stairs.
The Fire Marshal went to the insurance
company and arianged with them that if
Lee called to present bis claim they were
to tell him to go to the house at 1 o'clock.
Lee called at the oflice and was told to go
to the house, wbere the Fire Marshal was
waiting for him.
'i tie Fire Marshal questioned him and
he gave evasive answers. Finally he ran
downstairs and the Fire Marshalstarted
after him. Lee bolted down Clay street,,
hotly pursued by the Fire Marshal, and a
crowd quickly gathered and joined in the
chase. Someone blew a police whistle
and policemen came running from dif
ferent directions and also joined in the
chase.
When Lee reached the corner of Dupont
street he dodeed into a doorway and ran
swiftly upstairs. The Fire Marshal and
police followed, but although they
searched the building from top to bot
tom Lee could not be found. It was sup
posed he had got on to the roof through a
skylight and bad disappeared into an
other building.
Lee is well known in Chinatown, and
the police say it is only a question of
time when he will be captured. He and
his wife claimed to belong to the Chinese
Methodist mission on Washington street,
and they worked that for all it wa3 worth.
He was arrested about a month ago for
selling lottery tickets, but the case was
dismissed.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
The Oregonâ N. N., City. The United States
warship Oregon was launched October 26, 1893.
To Laundry Farmâ S., City. There is a good
road for bicycles irom Broadway and Seventh
street to Laundry Farm in Alameda County.
Start from the thoroughfare named, ride along
Broadway to Twelfth, along Twelfth until the
county road is reached near Fruitvaie, and
take the road that leads to the farm.
Marriage and Divorceâ G. F., Sacramento,
Cal. If parties divorced in California after
April 26 want to marry on the high sea they
can do so, providing the ceremony is per
formed by one who Js authorized to solemnize;
but if married by the master of a vessel it is
doubtful if such a marriage would bo valid, as
there is no law that authorizes a master of a
vessel to solemnize marriage. If the parties
went to the State of Nevada they would have
to reside in the State six months.
Ducks and Drakesâ Jones and Brown, City.
To make ducks and drakes with one's money
or property of others is an allusion to a game
played by boys, who take oyster-shells or flat
stones and throw them horizontally along the
surface of apiece of water in such a manner
that the missiles skim along the surface, touch
ing It many times and again emerging. The
hrst time the stone emerges it is a "duck,", the
second a "drake," and so on, according to the
old doggerel:
A duck and a drake,
- â  And a halfpenny cake,
i. . And a penny to pay the baker.
The meaning in the case of money is that the
spendthrift metapaorically uses coins as the
boys use stone to make ducks and drakes. As
applied to property of another which one has
in his keepiug it means that by being careless
in the handling of it he lets it pass from him
as the boys do the stones when playing the
game described. -

HER MAINMAST
IS HER FUNNEL
Missionary Vessel Morning
Star Is Queerly
Rigged.
She Made a Very Peculiar Show
ing in tbe Bay Last
Sunday Morning.
Miss Daisy Towd Braved the Farallon
Breakers in Order to Board
the Gracie S.
The missionary barkentine Morning
Star is a curio. When here six years ago
she was the one attraction of the water
iront and her auxiliary screw was a con
tinual source of wonder. The screw was
always in evidence, bnt no smokestack
could ever be seen. Still the barkentine
can always make from four to five knots
in a calm, but just how she makes it has
been a mystery to many of the natives in
the southern seas.
The mainmast of the missionary vessel
is hollow as far as the truck and it serves
as the funnel. i
When the barkentine was bucking the
tide yesterday, with all her sails furled
and the smoke pouring out of the main
roast she presented a peculiar appearance.
Many of the boatmen insisted that she
was on fire, but as soon as Mike Fitzgerald
made her out he set all doubts at rest by
explaining the phenomenon.
Among the arrivals yesterday was the
British ship Afon Alaw, 133 days from
Swansea. Captain Thomas considers it a
fair passage, but it does not begin to com
pare with the record of 96 days he made
in the Merioneth. At that time John D.
Spreckels presented him with the cham
pionship flag and the Merioneth still flies
it. Captain Thomas is wedded to his new
love, however, and, according to him, a
tiner,ship than the Afon Alaw was never
launched. When rounding the Horn the
good ship had a terrible time of it. The
cargo shifted and on one occasion the ves
sel was on her beam ends. Another roll
in the trough of the sea put her on an
even keel, however, and then when a little
sail was made on the fore she gathered
way and ran into safety.
The Uiitish ship Caradoc, 119 days from
Calcutta, also made port. Sue was hove
to for three days off port, and the captain
says the norther was a very heavy one.
The old side-wheel tug Tiger, so well
known on the Sausalito freight route a
year ago, got back to port yesterday. She
started for San Francisco with a Darge in
tow, but when the gale came up she had
to cut adrift and make port alone. The
barge is now drifting around somewhere
off the coast, and the chances are that one
of the steam schooners now due from Men
docino will bring it in.
The bar is breaking, and Miss Daisy
Dowd. the "school mann" at the Faral
ions, had a rough time of it coming in on
the Gracie S. The handsome little pilot
boat had to stand on and off while Miss
Dowd was put aboard through the break
ers. Not oniy she, but the entire boat's
crew got a good ducking, and the women
lolks in particular are living in anticipa
tion of the return trip.
The members of the Grand Court of the
Foresters of America started for Marys
ville yesterday. There was a big crowd at
the 5 p. M. boat to see them off and the
expectation is that all will have a most
enjoyable time.
The schooner Mary and Ida will go out
again on another cod-fishing cruise this
week. The last venture was a success and
the captain thinks that another cruise to
Bering Sea will more than pay expenses.
The Mary and Ida docks at Hunters
Point, where a new codfishing estab
lishment has teen put up, while
the other vessels put their cargoes ashore
at California City.
John White and William Duggan were
locked np at the Harbor poiice station by
Officer John Dower yesteiday on a charge
of disturbing the peace. They got into a
conversation at the Clay-street landing
and Duggan invited White across the
street to have a beer. During the conver
sation White put down & quarter and Dug
gan, picking no the change, put it in his
pocket. A row followed, names were
called, blows were struck and now both
men must answer to a charge of disturb
ing "he peace.
Officer John Aitken of the harbor police
is the ''peddlers' terror." Hardiy a day
passes but tbat he runs in one or more of
the "gentry," and invariably secures a
conviction. Many of the prisoners have
stolen goods in their possession, and as
they are returned to the owners the har
bor police have another go-d showing to
their record.
The revenue cutters will sail shortly on
their regular monthly cruise. The Cor
win will get away for Alaska to-day and
the Rush will sail to-morrow. Both cut
ters will keep a close watch over the seal
ing grounds.
Many an improvement has been intro
duced on the water front during the past
twenty years, but the man wno has saved
the State the most money during his in
cumbency and who has done more toward
making the port of San Francisco a
model for other ports in the United
States, is Howard C. Holmes, the
present chief engineer of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners. It was he
that introduced the present method
of concrete piling, and he is still perfect
ing ihe system. When the iron cylinders
were driven over the piles and the work of
filling in began, Mr. Holmes saw that the
rock went to the bottom, that the sand
came next and the cement made a top
dressing. After weeks of study he solved
the problem. The three ingredients were
mixed in a gunny-sack and sunk in a pile
at Lombard-street wharf. To-day the
mass is as solid as a rock and a sledge
hammer couldn't break it. The traces of
the gunny-sacks can be followed with a
pencil, but even when the mass of con
crete is placed at an angle the sledge can
not make any impression.
At present the donkey engine and a
"borer" are at work making at least
twenty holes eight inches in diameter in
tne flooring of the new depot. These
will connect with the water pipes and the
toilet-rooms of the structure, and consid
erable trouble is being found in making
the connection. One of the diamond
drills was lost yesterday and a delay of
over an hour resulted.
Mr. Holmes says that good progress is
being made on the depot, and if he is
satisfied, why then there is no "kick com
ing." w-
A Tea Inspector.
Robert D. Bane has beeu appointed tea in
spector under the new act of Congress. He
will remain in office until his, successor shall
have been appointed under tke civil service
system, the examination to take place on May
12. The identity of the successful candidate
will not be made known until about six weeks
afterward. Mr. Bane will not enter into com
petition. He does not want the office. It pays
only $2000 per year.
To Stop Filibustering.
The Secretary of the Treasury has notified
all the Collectors of the Ports to be on the
watch for the organization of filibustering ex
peditions and tbe fitting out of privateers
against countries ,at peace with the United
Stales. This notice had direct, reference to
Cuban affairs and applies more particularly
to the Atlantic seaboard.

NEW GALLERY FOR
PARK PICTURES.
The Commissioners Have
Decided to Add a Large
Extension.
The Walls of the Present Build
ing Are Crowded and Will
Hold No More.
Collis P. Huntington Has Donated Nine
Valuable Oil Paintings by Con
tinental Artists.
The picture gallery of the Park Museum
is full to overflowing, and tbe Commis
sioners have decided to build a large new
one adjoining the present gallery on the
south. It will he 70x30 feet, and will be
lighted from above so hs to leave all tbe
wall space available for picture-banging.
Tbe cost will be about $3000, and work
will commence on it this week. The
Commissioner** thought it would be false
economy to be refusing the offer of hand
some pictures merely because there was
no place to put them.
The present gallery has just had a large
addition to its treasures. Collis P. Hunt
ington has donated nine valuable oil
paintings from the walls of his residence.
They are all by Continental artists, and
some of the canvases are quite large.
One of tbe largest and best is called
"Recreation in Capri," by E. Sain. It
shows some youths and maidens dancing.
Another very fine one by the noted ar
tist, And. Marks, is a herd of horses on
the plain?. There is an amusing one
called 'Chastising Cupid," in which the
mischievous little god is being soundly
basted by an artery dame tiii bis month
wears a very different expression from the
smiling one usually depicted. Others
specially good are "The Burning Ship,"
by Denny, and "The Court Tailor," by
Thompson.
The Chinese merchants, Sing Fat & Co.,
have presented to the museum a very
valuable and beautiful piece of cloissonee
ware. It is a large jar worth $75. This
fine enamel work is done by hand on cop
per and takes such an immense amount of
time and labor tbat the Japanese, who
manufactured it, will soon cease to produce
it, because the time of the workmen is now
become too valuable to spend a year on a
single article.
A start has been made on the park elec
tric plant Forty men and six teams
have been beautifying the grounds around
the new bridge. A carload of bamboo
roots have been ordered to plant around
the pools. Twenty men and three teams
have been working on the road to the
south of the water-works. , . "y.

lived for over thirty years.
Mr. Sinon was born in Cork, Ireland,
and came to America in 1843. He went
first to Brantford, Canada, where for a
time he served on the Board of Super
visors. At that time he was engaged in
the building and contracting business. â >
A lew years after Mr. Sinou came to the
United States; in 1859 he decided to make
San Francisco his home.
He followed the same business here as
in Canada. Anion*** his constructions are :

land recently d*Â»- troy ed by fire, the resi
dence of Robert Johnson on O'Farrell and
Leavenworth streets, the old Clay-street
bank and the power-house of the Union
street cable road.
Mr. Sinon was deeply interested in street
cable roads. He was one of the incor
porators of the first cable street railroad
companies in the world, the old Clay-street
Cable Company, whose line used to run
over the Clay-street bill from Kearny
street to Van Ness avenue. j He was one of
the seven who tested the then new system
at 4 o'clock in the morning. The others
were H. L. Davis, Joseph Button, A. S.
Hailadie, Richard Tobin, Robert Sher

that venture is now a matter of history,
and to Mr. Sinon is due much of the credit
lor the success of the enterprise.

APOLOGIES DUE
ON BOTH SIDES
That Is What the Friends
of the Bramacharin
Think.
The Incident Discussed by the
Woman's Congress in Execu
tive Session.
0 ficers Elected by the Boiy for the
Ensuing Yearâ Mrs. Swift
President.
At the meeting of the Woman's Con
gress, held in one of the smaller rooms of
tne Golden Gate Hall yesterday after
noon, the president, Mrs. Swift, took occa
sion to state the position of the congress,
or of its executive board and officers, with
regard to '"the Bramacharin incident" of
Saturday night. The meeting was one of
the members of the congress, the doors
being closed to all others, and to tbe mem
bers the president thought a statement
was due.
The Bramacharin had complained that
be had been insulted by ladies on the
platform; that he had been invited to
speak before the congress and, accepting
the invitation, his robe bad been Dulled
from behind while be was speaking. Mrs.
Swift said that the young man occupied a
position upon the siage where she could
and did see him ail the time be was
speaking, and she was sure â she knew â
that he was mistaken with regard to this.
If, however, he felt himself to have been
insulted in any way he had erred in not
complaining to the board, which would
have made every reparation called for, for
it wus certain tnat no slight of any kind
was intended.
She had understood, she said, that Mrs.
Wadham, a member of the congress whose
guest the Bramacharin was in this City,
knew that he felt offended, and that he
intended to give some expression of re
! sentment at tne public meeting. She said
she did not think that Mrs. Wadham had
done what tbo congress bad a right to ex
pect of her in not informing tbe board of
this intention and thus preventing a
scene. .-*.â . â¢".".â â¢'â¢'
At this Mrs. Wadham. who was in. the
audience, rose, sayini?, "I wish to say that
.thai is not true. While 1 knew he felt
offended I had no thought that he in
tended to refer to it."
"If you knew that he felt offended I
think you should have advised the board
of it, lor no offense was offered him, or at
least none was intended. I saw nothing
that could possibly give offense."
At this Mrs. Edward L. Wadham, Mrs.
Wadham's dau;hter-in-law, arose and
said that Mrs. Swift was not in a position
to see what had taken place, but that an
affront had been offered.
"What was it then?'' asked Mrs. Swift.
"A lady back of you and back of him,
while be, the Bramacharin, was speaking,
made a motion with her hands in view of
the audience suggestive that be should sit
down. Then Mrs. Gardener, whose ex
pressed opinions the Bramacharin was at
tacking, laughed heartily much of the
time. In view of the fact tbat the Brama
charin was there by invitation of the con
gress he felt this as an insult."
Mrs. Swift repeated that however this
might be, she knew that nothing of the
kind was intended, and that had a slight
been unintentionally given it would have
been intentionally apologized for bad
notice been given.
With this tbe incident was dropped and
the congress went about its business of
electing officers for the ensuing year.
Mrs. John F. Swift was elected presi
dent, Mr?. Lovell White was elected vice
president at large, Mrs. Van Pelt, record
ing secretary; Mrs. George T. Gaden, cor
responding secretary, and Mme. Sorbier,
treasurer.
The following were chosen to the execu
tive board: Mrs. David Starr Jordan, Mrs.
Stanford, Mrs. Austin Ferry, Mrs. Lloyd
Baldwin, Mrs. Asa Simpson and Mrs.
George Oulter.
The congress has been invited to hold
a session at Stock ton, and will probably
do â¢ so* carrying with it some of its best
speakers. :L' : : x
In- speaking of the Bramacharin inci
dent after .be meeting yesterday. after
noon Mrs. Edward L. Wadhams said that
sbe felt tbat the Bramacharin "had been
strucK* first," and that he had made the
mistake of resenting it. She thought
apologies were due from both sides, but
that tne action of Mrs. Swift throughout
was without blame.
Cantor ***>tark Re-elected.
- A special â¢ meeting of the Congregation
Emanu-El was held Sunday to elect a new
cantor for the Sutter-street Temple. 1 E. J.
Stark, the former cantor, was the choice of the
congregation, and as a mark of further appre
ciation bis salary was raised. He was re
elected for a term oi ihree years.
BY SINGLE TAX
OR SOCIALISM
Joseph B. Leggett Discusses
the Two Great Reform
Movements.
He Declares the Latter Has Done
Much Good, but Is Now
Doing Harm.
Gorge Speed Takes Up the Cudgels
ii Defense of Socialistic
Principles.
Joseph B. Leggett, the well-known ex
ponent of single tax, delivered a very in
teresting address in Pythian Castle Sunday
evening in which he showed from a single
tax standpoint the part that the socialists
are playing in the great economic Ques
tions of the day. He paid a hish compli
ment to the socialists, saying that they
were the first to perceive this question,
the freeing of tbe wage-earners from tbe
slavery of poverty.
Their aims and objects are laudable.
Henry George, author of "Progress and
Poverty," used to meet and exchange
views with the socialists of San Francisco,
and he endeavored to point out to them
the better parts of the system they advo
cated. Socialism has drawn to its ranks
some of the brightest minds of the worid.
However, Mr. Leggett had more than
compliment to pay to this body ol politi
cal economists, for in the remainder of
his address he reproached them for cre
ating dissensions and splits in all reform
movements. When in 1886 Henry George
ran for Mayor of New York be was sup
ported by the socialists, but a year latex
the socialists split with tbe single taxers,
who were also interested and working to
the same ends, political and economical
reform.
Tne two bodies can now never agree,
for socialism represents the principles of
collectivism, while tbe single tax stands
for individualism. In its early stages so
cialism sowed the seed for the single tax,
and that was its mission in the world.
The speaker spoke of the nationalist
party that came into existence after Bel
lamy's "Looking Backward" was such a
rage, and said that in this City the party
stood a show for victory but for a split
caused by the socialist element. He said
that such splits as these have caused many
reform movements to be failures, particu
larly in England and Australia, and that
in consequence since 189") socialism has
been going on the down hill.
In England Mr. Leggett claimed th*
single tax element has been steadily gain
ing strength and that in England and
Scotland it permeates the entire political
system.
At the end of his discourse the chair
man invited short addresses from the
audience. Among those who accepted
the invitation was George Speed, a well
known Socialist. He denied thai social
ism is on the decrease and cited ths re
cent elections in Italy, Austria and other
countries where they have obtained more
than a good foothold. He also denied
that his party is the cause of splits in re
form movements ana said that all the
cases cited by the principal speaker was
where the single taxers had unwittingly
become the allies of capitalistic political
parties. ;
PACKED TO THE DOORS.
O'Rrlen's Sacrifice Sale of New Spring
Goods Takes the Town by
Storm.
The croakers who are constantly prating
of hard times and dullness of trade must
have been astonished if they were any
where in the neighborhood of O'Brien's
mammoth dry-t?oods establishment at
Market and Jones streets yesterday, for
one of tne biggest crowds of buyers that
ever attended a sale turned out to the
opening of this popular firm's great un
loading and forcing-out sale of their
gigantic overstock of new spring goods.
But the instantaneous and overwhelm
ing success of the opening of this great
sals is not to be wondered at, occurring as
it does just at the height of the buying
season and enabling the thousands who
have not yet made their spring purchases
to supply their needs with the latest and
most thoroughly up-to-date products of
the best designers and manufacturers at
tremendous, reductions from prevailing
retail prices.
The extraordinary character of the sale
can be judged from tho fact that the
Messrs. O'Brien having nearly doubled
their usual spring importations in antici
pation of the proposed great increase
in the tariff now find themselves heavily
overstocked owing to the backwardness
of the spring season, and this compels
them to adopt the most stringent
measures to unload the vast quantity of
goods on hand while they are yet season
able. . a'
That their efforts will be successful be
comes almost a foregone conclusion in
view of the reduction made, the prices in
many cases having been actually cut in
two and yesterday's tremendous outpour
ing is substantial evidence that the pur
chasing public fully recognizes and ap
preciates the extraordinary money-saving
opportunities presented.

FAVORITES ARE
ON THE DECLINE
The Talent Made a Mess
of It Yesterday at
Emeryville.
Ostler Joe Was in Rare Fettle
and Equaled a Coast
Record.
Daylight Won a Gamely Contested
Raceâ Torsida Disposed of Her
Field Very Handily.
The favorites were in poor form opening
day at Emeryville, capturing but two of
the events on the card. The attendance
was none too large, and it begins to look
as if race-goers really did have a surfeit
of the sport.
* By far the best performance of the day
was that of the black horse Ostler Joe in
the mile and a sixteenth purse event.
Opening a 3 to 2 choice he receded to 3 to
1, and all from a stiff play which caused
the price laid against Double Quick to be
swiped from twos down to 3to 2. Ostler
laid at the favorite's side to the stretch,
where he drew away and won by three
lengths from Satsuma in 1:415%, equaling
the coast record.
Veragua, second choice in the betting,
proved the best of the eleven platers that
answered the post call in the opening seven
furlong selling race. Bozeman hustled
him out in front and, maintaining hi*-- ad
vantage throughout, passed the wire a
leneth ahead of Mulberry, which came
from the rear at the end and took the
place from Nervoso. Wm. 08, the favor
ite, was unplaced.
The next race decided was a mile selling
dash, for which St. Aignon ruled a 2to 1
choice, with Daylight next in demand at
sto 2. The barrier was broken in a break
away and Ferguson started the field with
the red bunting. Isom got Daylight
away first, and he was never headed, win
ning in a drive, a length before Walter J,
in 1:42..
After receding in the betting from 7 to 5
to 2to 1 Torsida captured the two-year
old scramble at five furlongs very handily.
Bergen waited with her until straight
ened for the wire, when he passed Rey
Salauzar and beat the colt out by three
lengths in 1:02. El-more finished in the
show.
The defeat of Zamar 11, the 3 to 5 choice
for the fourth event at six furlong?, was
not unexpected. Peixotto raced with him
to the stretch, when he showed the dis
tress signal. Peixoito now assumed com
mand, out was in turn passed and easily
beaten out by Colonel Wheeler, against
which 5 to 1 was obtainable.
Refugee, the 6 to 5 choice, managed to
win the final seven-furlong run by the
narrowest of margins. Mainstay led him
for most of the distance and was only
downed a nose the last jump in 1:28.
NOTES.
Peter Weber, the well-known horse
man, now a resident of Los Angeles, was
at the trace yesterday.
Wally Weaver left for Denver yesterday
with Cabrillo and Tulare, recently pur
chased from Pat Dunne and the useful
plater Charlemagne, which formerly ran
in barney Schreiber' .colors. Aliare cap
-â¢blejof winning their oats in any company.
â¢Walt Vivel!, the capable trainer, went
along with I he horses.
Double Quick went lame in his race,
which probably interfered with his
chances.
Could Mike Henne*Â«sy on Walter J have
had clear sailing the colt wouid have won
without much difficulty. He was pocketed
nearly the entire journey.
Colonel Wheeler is back in his old win
ning two-year-old form and he will now

DURRANT IS FRETTING.
Visited at San Quentin by
v Salvation Army
0 fleers.
Expresses the Opinion That Everybody
"on the Outsid'." Believes
Him to B- Guilty.
Major Winchell and Editor Mlllsapof
tbe Salvation Army, with Chaplain
Drahms of the prison, visited Theodore
Durrant in his cell at San Quentin Sun
day.
In the short conversation that was held
with the condemned man he expressed him
self to the effect that he expected that his
visitors had been imbued with the general
opinion of his guilt. Yet, whiie that
might be the case, he assured them he was
innocent irrespective of this general be
lief "on the outside." He affirmed his be
lief in religion and that he was still a Bap
tist, believing in the tenets of his faith.
He excused himself to his visitors, saying
he was busy writing, but would be glad to
see them again. ...
The Salvation officers say the condemned
man looks haggard and fretful, and has
lost much of bis cheerfulness since he was
removed from the County Jail.
Chaplain Drahms offered no opinion re
garding him further than that the officers
i of the jail speak of Durrant as being an
i obedient inmate.
Entertained the Delegates.
At the invitation of the San Francisco Board
of Health the interior delegates to the Pure
Food Congress enjoyed an excursion on the
bay Sunday. The tug Governor Markham
lett Mission-street wharf at 10:30 a. m., re
turning to the City about 3:30 p. m. A visit
was mane to the Union Iron Works, the Heads,
Sausalito, Belvedere, Tiburon and San Quen
tin. An elaborate lunch was served on board
and the time was pleasantly passed by all.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 4, 1897-
TO THE AID Of
THE TEACHERS
Supervisor Smith Wants
to See Their Sala
ries Paid.
Introduces a Resolution to That
- Effect at the Board
Meeting.
Dr. Clinton S<ys the Cut in Water
Rates Must Ba Made a Hori
zontal One.
Supervisor Smith came within one vote
at the meeting of the Board of Super
visors yesterday of getting through a reso
lution that would have settled the vexed'
j question of the payment of teachers' sal-;
aries. Near the close of the meeting he
introduced the following measure:
Whereas, In the tax levy of the present
fiscal yeur allowance was made for the sum of
$947,000. to be used in the payment of sal
aries each month on demand ol teachers and
other School Department employes; and where
as, at the same time an allowance of $294,277
was made for buildings, supplies and oti*er
incidental expenses of the School Depart
ment for this fiscal year; and whereas, notwith
standing this fact, the hard-working school
teachers have been deprived of their salaries
forthe period of fifteen days; and whereas,
publications in the daily press indicate that
the salary demands ot the teachers will be
withheld during the month of June by the
Board of Education for the purpose of further
ing the payment of demands for supplies pur
chased in excess of the amount allowed in the
tax levy by the Board ot Supervisors; there
fore be it -' %
Resolved, That we deem it the duty of the
Bonrd of Education to issue each month a
salary demand to each teacher and employe of
the School Department for the amount due aa
contemplated by the Board ot Supervisors in
making up the lax levy for the fiscal year
1896-97.
Resolved, That it is the duty of the Board of
Education to forthwith pay all back salaries to
teachers in preference to the payment of ex
cessive supply demands. - *
Resolved, That the clerk Is hereby instructed
to transmit a copy of this resolution to the
Board of Education. ;â¢ -"â / .-'JA* '--Jr?J'_
Dr. Clinton wanted the matter pnt over
a week. He said that previous School
Boards had found it necessary to tempor
arily withhold the pay of teachers in or
der to tide over financial difficulties, but
that the instructors had always been paid
in the end. He questioned the authority
of the Board of Supervisors to interfere
with tho Board of Education.
Supervisor Smith declared it was the
duty of the Board of Supervisors to see
that the teachers were paid. The Super
visors furnished the funds for the School
Department and the Supreme Court had
recently decided that teachers must be
paid no matter who else had to wait.
Supervisor Britt wanted the matter
postponed nntil the board could consult
with the School Directors. The motion to
I lay over a week was defeated by a vote of
7to 5. A motion by Supervisor Britt to
lay the motion on the table was defeated
by the same vote.
A motion by Supervisor Clinton to refer
the matter to the Finance Committee was
carried by a vote of 7 to 5.
Supervisor Lackman demanded to know
what had become of the water rate ques
tion and why the Water Committee had

He reminded the board that the matter
bad been under consideration a long time
and that the rate-payers were growing
anxious. He called on Supervisor Clinton,
chairman of the committee. The latter
stated that tbe committee was still seek
ing information. That the water, com
pany's books were of such a character the
expert of the hoard could maKe no head
nor tail of them; and that it seemed as
though the cut in rates must be made a
horizontal one. He thongbt the commit

AN ORGANIST HONORED.
Sam Mayer's Twenty Five Years'
Services at the First
Church.
An Envelope Containing $650 Handed
Him by I. to. Scott on Behalf
of Many Friends.
The First Congregational Church was
the scene of a notable little ceremony on
Sunday night, when a large congregation
had assembled to celebrate the . twenty
filth anniversary of Samuel D. Mayer as
organist and choirmaster of the church.
The pulpit and organ-loft were beautifully
decorated with flowers, and an elaborate
musical service was rendered, the pastor,
Dr. Adams, delivering an appropriate dis
course on musical instruments.
But it was after the regular service that
the particular ceremony of the evening
occurred. Organist Bam Mayer was play
ing the postlude in the presence of over
200 people when he was informed that Dr.
Adams wanted him. The doctor made a
brief address, alluding to Mr. Mayer's long
and faithful work, and was followed by
Mr. Brown and Irving M. Scott. The
latter wound up a felicitous address by
presenting Mr. Mayer with a large enve
lope containing $650, one of the constitu
ent checks being from Mrs. Harriet
Crocker Alexander of New York for $250.
Mrs. Alexander was the donor of the
First Church grand organ, which Mr.
Mayer handles so well. The pleasant af
fair terminated in an all-around hand
shaking, in which the arm of the popular
organist ran serious risk of dislocation.
A Society Recital.
A dramatic and dialect recital will be given
by Miss Hattle Nathan at the Maple Hall of
the Palace Hotel on Thursday evening, May
27. The affair will be under the auspices of the
Eureka Society for the Protection of Children,
which has been recently organized by Mrs.
Kate Pettee. The programme includes dra
matic, comedy, dialect and, Shakespearean
roles, to conclude with the charming Eastern
novelty "of song' reciting. As Miss Nathan
is well known in society circles it is expected
that a large gathering will greet her appear

DURRANT FILES HIS
LAST LEGAL PAPER
Bill of Exceptions Presented
Yesterday in Judge
Bahrs' Court.
Attorney Deuprey Says This
Will Act as a Stay of
Proceedings.
-.;*. I "â 
\ * â¢* ;
District Attorney Barnes Says the
Execution Will Take Place on )
i the Date Appointed.
Th* Durrant case was dp in Jndge
Bahrs' murt yesterday, the bill of excep
tions being tiled by Attorneys Eueene
N. Deuprey and John H. Dickinson on be
half of tne deiendant, Theodore W. H.
Durrant. convicted of the murder of
Blanch Lamont. ; ;
Trie position taken by the attorneys for
Durrant is that Judge Bahrs in passing
sentence of death on the prisoner based
that action on the judgment hitherto en
tered by ex-Judge D. J. Murphy, who at
the close of the trial sentenced Durrant
to imprisonment in the State prison and
to be executed by hanging. At the time
of the proceedings in Judge Bahrs' court
the words used by ex-Judge Murphy were
repeated, so far as the order of imprison
ment before execution was concerned,
ai.d the court declined to strike out those
words, although Mr. Deuprey at that
time moved to have them canceled from
the record, v
In his argument before Judge Bahrs on
the 10th of last month Mr. Deuprey char
acterized ex-Judge Murphy's action as a
"pretended judgment,'.' alleging that the
Court in that matter bad exceeded its
authority, and that therefore the entire
judgment bad been vitiated and had been
I made null and void. Jl-j
The objection thus made was overruled
I by Judge Bahrs and an exception was
duly entered. At every stage of the pro
i ceedings excep*. ions to the orders of the
court were noted, and particularly there
was an exception to the judgment and
sentence of death, to be preceded by im
prisonment in the State Prison.
Mr. Deuprey held that there was a nice
distinction involved in this point, and ha
believed that tbe court had overstepped
the mark. He admitted that when the
jury returned a verdict of murder of the
tirst degree : against Durrant, without fix
ing the penalty at imprisonment for lite,
that fact carried with it the infliction of
the death penalty. If the court had
stopped tben, Mr. Deuprey argued, no
error would have been committed in pass
ing sentence, for he thought an error fatal
to the legality of the order was made when
ex- Judge Murphy added the punishment
of imprisonment in the Stale penitentiary
at Sun Quentin. He cited authorities in
support of this position, but Judge Bahrs
thought the decisions quoted were not
applicable, so he disregarded them and
followed words of ex-Judge Murphy
in passing sentence on Durrant.
Mr. Deuprey said yesterday that the
next thing to be done is to print the bill
of exceptions and present the same to the
Supreme Court. "In the meantime," he
a :d<rd, '"our appeal to tbe Supreme Court
acts as a stay of proceedings. I have
heard that counsel for the people say that
this is not so, but I do not regard their
opinion as binding. 'This order made by
Judge Bahrs, aside from all other consid
eration", is clearly an appealable order,
since it is an order after judgment. Our
bill of exceptions will be riled in the Su
preme Court on or before the 10th inst.,
and there can be no reasonable dispute as
to proceedings being stayed until our ap
peal has been heard and determined by
the Supreme Court. Of course, there could
not possibly be an execution of Theodore
Durrant before that appeal is decided
against him, as no one has authority to
carry out the order of the Superior Court
until that time. The Warden of the State
Prison Would not dare to do it. He would
not care to incur the responsibility and
take the chances of answering to a charge
of murder." ,
District Attorney W. S. Barnes said: "I
suppose Mr. Dcvi; is doing the last
thing that can be done for his client. Of
course he is all right, so far as that is con
cerned, but I don't see that this bill of ex
ceptions cuts any material figure in the
case. It will not act as a stay of proceed
ings, and will not interfere with the ex
ecution of Durrant unless an order to
that effect is made by the Supreme Court.
A similar course was taken in the Fred
ericks case, but there was no delay in tbe
execution. It was several weeks after
Fredericks was hanged before the Su
preme Court banded down an opinion con
firming the judgment against him.
"Of course the Supreme Court has the
power to issue an order at any time grant
ing a stay of proceedings, and. that may
be done; but unless it is done the execu
tion will come off at the time provided for
â  in Judge Bahrs' order."
Lawyers regard this as a very interest
ing point in criminal jurisprudence, and
it is inferred that Durrant is not alto
gether indifferent to the way in which it
shall be finally settled. Warden Hale has
also some feeling touching the part be is
likely to take in the proceedings, and it is
thought that an effort will be made to
secure an early expression of, opinion
from the Supreme Court.

VALET CLARKE ESCAPES THE
GRIDDLE.
Attorney Foote Again Shows Up the
Meddlesomeness of the Local
Police Department
"I object to that question on the ground
. that it is irrelevant, incompetent and
immaterial."
The litigation over ilr*t- Nettie Craven's
. -deeds' to the Fair property is now in its
. third week, yet these were the tirst words
..uttered by Attorney George A. Knight
â¢* since the trial began. By them lie meant
.â to. have it known that he has something
to say in the case and does not propose to
â¢;â¢ ' be shut out. Mr. Knight has all along
"posed as one of the generals over the
army of barristers arrayed against Mrs.
Craven and her claims and that detach
â¢ ment of the general public which is in
daily attendance at Judge Slack's court
i.as wondered more than ever why it was
. that he kept in the" background. Knight
- doubtless had been thinning about this,
too, and determined yesterday to interject
... himself into the case in a manner calcu
. lated to bring about a speedy determlna
: tion as to where he was at.
So it was, then, that the silver-tongued
orator from the woods of distant Hum
boldt took advantage of the tirst oppor
tunity presented him to object to one of
the cross-questions put to Witness Her- j
bert Clark by Attorney Foote of the de
fenseand sure enough that started the !
"bail rolling. i
Counselors McEnerney and pierson, who
â ** "have been doing all the" talking and busi
ness generally for the plaintiff's side
since the beginning of the trial, looked up
in surprise nt Mr. Knight's intrusion, |
and there were some people in the court- !
room who thought they even detected a
frown on the gentlemen's faces. But, j
however that may be, Judge Slack became
readily cognizant of the tact that some
thing was up and wanted to know by what
right Mr. Knight was ringing in, as it .
-' were.
"Well, if your Honor please, "said Mr.
Knight rising and glaring around him !
â savagely, we "might just as well have this
thing settled right now. lam here repre
â * senting the owners of this estate â the
heirs as interveners â the chilaren of James '
G. Fair. They would be in possession of
their property but for tbis suit, and it
.seems to me that I, as their legal repre- !
sentative, have a most important duty to
attend to here. 1 propose to look after i
their interests and to exercise my right to !
speak whenever I deem it expedient."
Judge Slack said he had already ruled !
that the interests of the intervenors and
executors were identical, and he was not
going to permit a dozen attorneys to bob j
' up whenever they felt like having some
thing to say.
Of course all this was no funeral of the !
defense's, but nevertheless the attorneys j
on tbal side could not abstain from having
Mrdfll
ATTORNEY KNIGHT Demands the Pij-rht to Participate li
the Fair-Craven Trial,
- a little mischievous fun out of it at the
expense of the enemy. Mr. Foote, for
instance, remarked with a droll attempt at
gravity that Mr. Knight should sit down
and keep quiet, and should speak only
iwben he got permission to do so from
either _4cEnemÂ»y or Pierson.
It made Mr. Knight wince and bite his
lips.
"" Then Mr. Deimas toolc a shy at the dis
ordered rank*}. As he understood it, Mr.
Knight had nothing to do with tbe cage.
He was the attorney for Charles L. Fair,
and' the latter was in no way a Darty to
tins suit to quiet title to the property
claimed by Mis. Craven. Of course, there
would be no objection to Mr. Kniglit be
ing present, but he should certainly be a
nice, quiet little boy.
Mes-r**. McEnern-ey and Pierson were
discreetly silent through ali this, but
their countenances spoke volumes. They
didn't like it, that was evident. Knight;
was left to dodge the torturing poises j
from the defense and to fight it out with I
the court all by himself. He argued, and I
Judge Hack finally disposed of the matter I
by saving that he would recognize Mr.
Knight as counsel for tbe interveners, but
. would not tolerate the talking of all the
attorneys for the plaint ff a at once.
This quieted matters off and the trial
' proceeded.
The baiting of Valet Clarke by Attorney
Foote on behalf of the defense occupied
the entire forenoon session and furnished
all that was interesting in the day 'â  evi
dence-taking. Mr. Foote took occasion to
again bring out strongly the fact that the â 
San Francisco Police Department had
taken sides in this, _ purely civil proceed
in*.', and had been hunting up evidence, j
serving subpenas and disbursing witness
fees for the Fair estate, instead of devot
ing its energies exclusively to the duties
prescribed by the people who are taxed
for its support and are entitled to its un- j
divided attention and protection. And, j
as usual, counsel for the other side made |
strenuous efforts -to keep this sort of cvi- i
i dence out, but invariably without success.
'-â â  In cross-examining Clarke Mr. Foote
began where he left off at the close of
court last Thursday, and that was in refer- j
ence to the trip Clarke made with Captain
Lees and Detective Seymour to San Rafael j
in search of evidence calculated to break
down Mrs. Craven's claims. In reply j
Clarke acknowledged that although he I
knew Senator Fair had spent the whole of
! the 24. h of September in San Rafaelâ that |
I he knew it at the very time that he and i
the officers had started off togetherâ yet \
he for some reason or other failed to tell j
them anything about it. It was this very !
point that Lees and Seymour wanted to |
establish, and by telling them about it ,
j Clarke could have savad them the trip and |
considerable anxiety.
"Did anybody ever inform you that it
j was very important, in order to establish
the validity of Senator Fair's trust will,
to prove that the Senator was notfn San ;
Francisco on the 24th of September?" .
! asked Mr. Foote.
"No â yes,'' stammered the ex-valet. \
"Who wasit?' demanded thej attorney.
"I think the executors."
"Which of them?"
"Mr. Bresse, I believe."
"Anybody else?"
"Yes, Mr. Angus, too."
"Didn't Lees tell you, too?"
"I believe he did."
"Don't you know he did?"
"Yes."
"Why don't you come out and say so
tben?"
Mr. McEnerney objected to this line of
' questioning, and in doing so stirred up
\ Mr. Foote. " The latter intimated that the
showing up of the connection of the police j
with the caseâ with a civil suitâ was hurt- |
ing somebody. McEnerney's objection i
was based upon the alleged fact that there
was no record that the peace officers were
connected with the case, or that Captain
i Lees was a peace officer at all.
"No," said Mr. Foote, "there is no record
j that he is the kind of a peace officer you
[ mean."
McEnerney objected to the last insinua
; tion, too, and induced the court to ex
punge it from the court record.
Mr. Foote now essayed to read some of
! Clarke's testimony given at the examina
; tion of Attorney Cooney, his object being
1 to show tnat the executors and heirs of
j the estate were fighting among themselves
jat that time, in doing so he elicited a
| chorus of objections from the plaintiffs'
I line. He then proceeded to beg the court
j to give the defense some latitude in the
! cross-examination of Clarke. This wit
i ness, he said, had been brought in to
j prove a vital point and it was ol the great
| est importance to the defense that it be
permitted to show up all of the man's
: connections with the case and the interest
| he was taking in it.
Judge Slack promised not to hamper the
: cross-examination, but said he did not
\ wish the trial delayed.
Clarke, in resuming his disjointed narra
tive, denied that he assed Captain Lees to
go with him to San Rafael for the purpose
'. of getting evidence that would corroborate
bis story. It was Captain Lees, he said,
! who suggested the trip. The witness and
the officers visited San Rafael several
i times in search of evidence. They saw a
i number of people over there and took
' statements from them.
"Did you see the Parisian Hotel register I
; when you went over there with the offi- j
I cers the first time?" asked Mr. Foote.
"No; it was not there," replied Clarke.
"Where was it?"
"We were told that Mr. Cassou, the ;
' former proprietor of the house, had taken j
it away."
"Now isn't it a fact that you were also
told thai Cassou would not give it up un- ]
,' less paid liberally for it?"
Clarke did not remember that, or at
least said so. The valet denied that he
knew a family named Elliott, or that he j
had read tnat the Elliotts had told Attor- ,
ney Knight that Fair was lying ill at the ]
Lick Hou--e, instead of being at San Ra
lael on the 24. of member.
Clarke then gave another illustration of
how well he remembered the incidents of
! that day across the bay by recalling that
'. after breakfast he entranced the millions
; aire by reading "Aladdin, or the Wonder- i
! iul Lamp," and other hair-raising yarn- '
! from the 'Arabian Nights" to him as j
! they sat together on the veranda of the |
Parisian House. He got tangled up in the !
, effort to remember how many volumes j
j comprised the series, and also could not j
: recollect whether he read any of the stor
i ies to the SenatorJ the day previous or
I afterward.
Clarke was still on the stand when re* j
I cess was ordered.
Owing to the fact that the Board of Su
pervisors was to meet in the afternoon and
needed its assembly chamber, Judge Slack
was compelled to move again. Tnis time
he arranged to secure -. Judge Hebbard's
courtroom temporarily, but to-day he will
go back to the big eh ameer. Juror Bur
llngame delayed matters considerably by
not putting in an appearance on time.
He had difficulty in finding the new court
room and besides had misunderstood the
court's order as to the time for convening.
Tbe cross-examination of Clarke was
quickly finished and then came the r e
atrect examination. In response to Mr.
McEnerney's questions Clarke said * that
the first time he ever told anybody that
Senator Fair spent the 24tb of September
in San Rafael was some time shortly after
the so-called pencil will was offered for
probate. He could not remember just
| when it was, but it was inside of two
months after that will was produced.
Then tbe witness was returned to the
! defense for re-cross-examination. Mr.
Foote being absent Clarsewas questioned
by Mr. Deimas. The latter wanted to
know again who was the first person ho
told about the San Rafael trip and Clarke
said it was Executor Goodfellow.
"How did you come to tell bim?" asked
Mr. Deimas.
"I don't know.' I was in bis office at
tbe time,'' was the reply.
"How did you come to be in his office?''
"I thing I "went there to get some paper
signed."
"What paper?"
THE SAN : FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 4, 1897.
"Something from our office, I suppose?"
"What is our office?" â **-.*'.
"The office of the Fair estate."
'.'Oh, then you are a part of the Fair
estate," said Mr. Deimas in well-feigned
surprise. â â jsSÃ__\
"No; I am an attache."
"A what?. An Apache?"
"No; an attache."
"On; excuse me."
William E. Stanford, a clerk for the
i stationery-house of H. S. Crocker <fc Co.,
was called to the witness-stand by the
plaintiffs. During the year 1896 he had
I charge of the legal blank and mathemati
i cal department.
Mr. Pi rson was now doing the ques
j tioning for the plaintiffs and Judge Den
! son changed seats with Mr. Deimas, in
J order to do the cro-*s-examining when his
I turn came.
Stanford went on to say that it was his
duty to order the printing of such stock as
his department required. He produced
his order-book and found by consulting it
that ho issued an order to the printing
office for 10.000 acknowledgment blanks on-
January 8. 1896. The plaintiffs are to
make an effort to show that tbe blanks on
which Notary Coouey's acknowledgments
of Mrs. Craven's deeds appear were
printed after the date those' deeds were
executed.
Under cross-examination Stanford said
he had been in full charge of the legal
blank department for about a year. He
could not remember who was in charge in
January, 1896. His immediate predeces
sor was a man named Cashin. - Tho wit
ness admitted that his order-book con
tained many entries made by persons
other than himself, and in some of these
he delected errors. He was quite sure,
however, that his writing-* were all cor
rect. He did not think it possible that he

could have made a mistake regarding the
order for 10,000 blame acknowledgment*.
The arrival of adjournment hour left
Stanford's evidence incomplete, so he will
resume the stand this morning.
ANSWERS THE BRAHMIN.
A Chinese Lady Physician Describes
the Ignoble Position of "Women in
the Orient.
Dr. Di Silva, a Chinese lady M. D., was
asked yesterday to tell the Women's Occi
dental Board whether the Brahmachar
in's account of women in the Orient could
be considered correct. The doctor, who
is a highly intelligent woman, and a grad-
I uate of an Eastern medical college, re
! sponded by giving a harrowing account
!of the enslavement of women in the
I Orient and she showed now they were al
ways the wards of seme male relation,
and never enjoyed any personal liberty.
At the business meeting of the Occi
. dental Board it was announced that in
I consequence of the New York Board of
I Missions having reduced its appropria
; tion this year, the Chinese and Japanese
; work in San Jose and ' Sacramento had
been abandoned. A strong hope was ex
pressed that the churches in those towns
would continue the work.
WHO FIRED THE SHOTS?
The Police Investigating a Row In a
Low Lodging-House on Pa

The police are investigating into the
cause of several shots being fired Sun
day morning in" a lodging-house 532 Pa
' cific street, kept by Margaret Kelly, better
known as '.'Tough^JVlag.'^c^i;^;..
The lodging-house - is . over a saloon
! called the Cowboys' Rest, and frequented
; by some of the worst characters on the
; Barbary Coast. JyJJi'JJ'JJ
About 7 o'clock yesterday morning sev
| eral shots followed by the screams of a
; woman were heard, and an hour later
| several more shots were heard. .One of the
I bullets went through an open window and
struck H. Simon in the heel, inflicting a
painiul wound. Simon has a second-hand
store at 535 Pacific street, and was stand
ing in front of his store when the bullet
struck him on the heel. LS -. : * ..
The police were notified, and Detective
Egan was detailed on the case. After an
investigation he arrested Harry and Fan
nie Lund and Lulu Smith, tnree of the
roomers, but subsequently theLunds were
discharged. The Smith woman is being
held pending further investigation, as
powder smoke was seen in ber room. She,
however, denied all knowledge of the
shooting.- -^ â¢'â -..:... .
Itis believed that some of the inmates
and visitors had a drunken carousal, and
some one fired the shots as a drunken

DRILLMASTER
MARSHALL DEAD.
Feeling of Gloom in the
Police Depart

He Was One of the Most Popu
lar Olfic.rs in the National
Guards.
His Untimely Death Was Due to an
Abscess That Gathered in
Hii Ear.

A feeling of gloom pervaded the Police
Department yesterday when it became
known that the genial and popular drill
instructor, Robert A. Marshall, had
breathed his last at his residence, 20),
Franklin street. *.'-:;"
An abscess gathered in his ear and al-
though he suffered some pain from it he i
was able to attend to his duties till last
Friday morning. The pain was so severe
that morning that he had to go home.
His own physician, Dr. Shumate, and
Dr. Keeney, physician for the Police De
partment, attended him, ' but he grew
worse. Sunday he was delirious from
pain and about noon yesterday death
ended his sufferings. - â¢â ?
He was a native son, having been born
in this City on August 30, 1863. When a
lad lie entered the office of Neustadter
Brothers, wholesale dry-goods merchants,
and rose to be their head bookkeeper.
While occupying that position he was
offered and accepted the position of drill
instructor of the police department on Oc
tober 16. 1894. He was at once appointed
a corporal, but on December 1, 1895, he
was promoted to be sergeant.
No man was better fitted for Ibe office of
drill Instructor due to his long connection
with the National Guards. He was ac
knowledged to have no peer as a well
drilled officer and man of executive abil
ity. He was idolized by bis men and bis
superior officers loved arid respected him
for bis admirable qualities as a man and
comrade.
He joined the National Guards when 18
years of ago as a drummer in, Company A.
then known as tho McMahon Guards, and
in six years rose to be captain of the com
pany.
His military record, as given by Lieu
tenant-Colonel Duboce, is as follows: He
enlisted in Company A, First Regiment,
August 22, 1881; was made sergeant
June 8, 1885; promoted to the lieutenancy
September 14, 1885; promoted to the cap
taincy March 14. 1387. On July 23, 1895.
Captain Marshall was transferred to Com
pany C, Third Infantry, and on July 22,
1896, he was elected to the captaincy of
Company D. First Infantry, the position
he held at the time of his death.
As drill inspector of the Police Depart-
I ment Captain Marshall's time was taken
up to the detriment of his company.
Realizing this be refused to present his
name for re-election last Friday night.
Second Lieutenant Thomas J. McCreagh
was elected as his successor, and will this
week go before the examining board to
qualify. r : \t.'ihLJ
The death of Captain Marshall leaves
First Lieutenant Eugene V. Sullivan in
charge of Company D, First Infantry.
From th. time he took in hand the
drilling of the members of the Police De
partment there was a marked change in
the appearance ofthe men, and at the last
annual review in October it was acknowl
edged by military, men that their move
ments were executed with as much pre
cision and tbey kept as good alignment as
any body of men in the country.
In Grilling the men he was the reverse
of a martinet. When there wore faults io
be corrected he did so in a way that in
spired confidence and esteem, and made
the men do their level best.
He was a member of the Widows' and
Orphans' Aid Association, and a prom
inent member of the police choir. He
leaves a widow, and a son 9 years of age. ,

The uncle came on the stand and swore that

SPOKE TO YOUNG MEN
Key. J. George Gibson at Y. M. C. A.
Hallâ Chief of Police Lees
a Listener.
Rev. J. George Gibson, pastor Emman
uel Baptist Church, spoke to men and to
young men particularly at Y. M. 0. A.
Hall on the corner of Mason and Ellis
streets Sunday afternoon.
Among the interested listeners who did
not leave the hall until Mr. Gibson fin
ished his address was Chief of Police
Lees.
The pastor spoke of the hard struggle of
young men to find employment anu of the
discouraging rebuffs they received from
the selfish and prosperous men of the day.
He mentioned that the act of criticism
was easier to cultivate than the act of
sympathy. Men appealed to for assist
ance often turned about and asked the
applicant all sorts of questions winding
up with the remark: . "if you lad not
done so and so you would not be in need
of help." ;â¢.'â¢'"â .',"-
Here the speaker cited the example of
Christ who always held out the hand of
compassion before he commanded. Christ
melts the heart with love until it is soft as
wax and then puts on any impression he
chooses. J-.
The pastor reminded his young bearers
tbat 'we all have our temptations, trials
and worries, and that the reai helper of one
wearied and discouraged is Christ."
The audience sang "Showers of Bless
ings'' and H. J. McCoy related some of
bis experiences in seeking for employment
twenty-seven years ago. The kind words
which he received from one man then
were pleasantly mentioned yesterday.
In speaking of bis future plans Mr. Gib
son said to a Call reporter after the meet
ing that he would not leave his church
earlier than two months hence. He re
marked that it was not bis purpose to
leave California, but thought he would go
to Chico and there rest for some time.
FOR ST. CHARLES CHURCH

Promises to Be a Great
Success.
There was an interesting meeting ofthe

night for the purpose of perfecting plans
for their fair, which will begin the last
week in August and continue for three
weeks.
The object of the fair is to pave the way
for raising funds for tbe new church-
Much encouragement has already been
received, one lady having collected $300
for the enterprise. The parishioners are
very anxious to build the new edifice at
Seventeenth street, and there is every
prospect of early financial success.
A newspaper will be conducted during
| the fair, and there will be many Interest-
I ing features. ; *'.-*-

FOOD COFFEE.
SAID BY A CATERER
To Be Injurious.
Did you ever live near Buffalo? If so
you know that firm of fancy grocers,
familiar to every on** in Western New
York State, Faxon, Williams & Faxon.
Their business makes them experts in the
good things of the tabic.
The bead of the bouse will tell any in-
quirer that when Postum Cereal coffee
was put into his own bouse in place of
berry coffee, it permitted them to enjoy a
; delicious coffee beverage and a gain in
health where formerly they were denied
coffee because of its effect on the health of
the different members of the family. ; "^%*g
Postum, being made of pure erains
only, can be taken by the weakest
stomach, as nature has wisely provided
that the grains of the field can be digested
easily, and as Fostum look-* like the finest
Mocha and ha<- the coffee taste, it tills the
want of the coffee-drinker very nicely.
Beware of the fraudulent imitation of
the original Posiuin Cereal Grain coffee.
Insist on Fostum.
DRUNK FOR TWENTY YEARS.
â¢ A correspondent writes: "I was drunk on
and off for over twenty yearsâ drunk when I
had money, sober when I had none. Many
dear friends I lost, and numbers gave me good
advice to no purpose ; but, thank Go I, an angel
hand came at last in the form of my poor wife,
who ministered your marvelous remedy,
'Anti-Jag,' to me without my knowledge or
consent. I am now saved and completely
transformed from a worthless fellow to a sober
and respacted citizen." ;-' ;
If "Anti-Jag" cannot be had at your drug-
gist, it will be mailed in plain wrapper with
full directions how to give secretly, on receipt

PROMINENT MEN-
Some of the Leading Scientist*! 'Agree
Upon an Important Subject
It is not only natural but just that proof
should be demanued by the public for
every statement or * claim that is made to
the public. When, therefore, it is asserted
that a certain article is not only pure and
palatable, and a most delightful beverage,
but also that it possesses qualities almost
invaluable for the human system, people
are ri***ht in demanding the proof. Read
the following: ,
Dr. William T. Cutter. State Chemist of
Connecticut, says: "Duffy's Pure Malt
Whisky contains no deleterious or injuri-
ous qualities, and its absolute purity as
well as scientific mode of manufacture
must recommend it to general use and
favor."
Rev. B. Mills, LL.D., says: "I have
used Duffy's Pure Malt Whisky with great
benefit to my wife, who is a confirmed in-
valid. I am a Presbyterian clergyman
and a doctor of divinity, but I am not
afraid torecommend Duffy's Malt Whisky
as tne purest and most efficient prepara-
tion as a medicine that I Know of, and
my experience is a large one."
Hundreds of additional statements
could be furnished, but tho merits of this
article, which hits been before the public
so many year.-*, amply prove in themselves
its great power and value. Do not be
persuaded by any druggist or grocer to
accept anything but the pure, the real
Duffy's Malt. ,â '::

THE COAL TRADE.
The private circular of I. Steuart gives the re
ceipts of Coal at this port during the first four
months of 1897 at 430,100 tons, against 451,200
tons id 1896. and says: "The deliveries of Coal in
port from the various sources of supply during the
month have been about an average quantity with
the exception of English Anthracite, of which
there have been no arrivals for the past 9!) days.
Blocks of this Coal are extremely low, and ns
there is only one vessel nearly due, suppi.es must
continue very limited for some time to ceme.
Prices of all kinds of foreign Coal are folly main
tained ami will probably continue to be so, as the
outward grain freights ruling are not such as to
tempt Coal tonnage to seek this port."

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lews" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and tho isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable:
but when tbe "low ls Inclosed with isobars of

able. With a "high" ln the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
wettber may be expected In summer and colder

NEW YORK, N. V., May & -Sharp advances
In Government securities abroad and a vague In
timation that the week's gold exports would be
less than expected caused an advance on the
Stock Exchange to-day. Most of this upward
movement, however, happened at the opening
hour. Later In the day activity fell off materi
ally, but the general tone of firmness lasted until
the close, In the bond market trading in Gov
ernment bonds was confined to fours of 19.5.
Tne tone of the marke. was slightly eaaler. A
comparatively fair business was transacted In
â¢ railway bonds, wltn prices fractionally higher.
Louisville and Nashville, Jersey Central and
Northern Pacific preferred displayed greater
strength than the majority of the list, but on ligbt
transactions. The so-called Gould stocks, particu
larly Manhattan Railway and Missouri Pacific,
were exceptionally weak.

Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 3. J
Even the shoutings of hallelujahs, the
jingling of tambourines, the beating of
drama and the tooting of cornets and
double bass horns cannot lay a ghost.
This has been demonstrated at the new
train-rig home of the Salvation Army, lo
cated at Tenth and Adeline streets.
*â â¢â  About two months ago the militant
Christians moved into their present quar
ters and the rental was placed at a low
jure, because the house had a history.
â ''The history was not altogether pleasant
and contained anecdotes of whistling
wraiths, midnight visitors and other un
canny things. The house is haunted.
Such spirituelle things as ghosts have
no terrors for Salvationists and so the
soldiers boldly entered the haunted
chambers, declaring that if any influence
on earth could drive out spooks and ap
paritions it is the influence of Salvation
ists. They started in with a very lively
. house-warming to which all the soldiers
and friends were invited. The stories of
* tne ghost were told and laughed at and
the burly cadets made light of the tradi
tions connected with the house. Now
they think differently.
.. A few weeks ago Lieutenant Sawyer was
awakened in the middle of the night by
some mysterious presence, and as soon as
â¢ his eyes were properly opened he saw an
unknown face looking at him. There was
nobody, but simply features. He at once
arose and chased that face until it got to
the window, where it wont out and disap
peared, and the lieutenant has not seen
it since. He tried to explain matters by
saying that he had a nightmare, but this
..Can hardly be credited, because abstemi
ous, punctual Salvation Army officers do
none of those things which are invariably
the cause of nightmares.
Mrs. Staff Captain Merryweather said
last night that when they rented the
house they were very candidly told that
it was haunted. The fact was confided to
her that noDody would stay in the house
. long on account of the whistling ghost.
An examination of the house was made,
and it was found that there were several
speaking-tubes from one portion of the
old building to another, and the Salva
tionists at once declared that the whis
tling ghost was simply a stray breath of
wind getting into the speaking-tubes.
More recently other manifestations have
. occurred to convince the noisy inmates
I that there is something uncanny about
the place, is something uncanny about
the place,
' "The lieutenant told me." said Mrs.
M<:.-jy weather, "that the screen from the
fireplace in one of the rooms has a habit
of dancing around the room. I have not
seen it myself, but the lieutenant is thor
oughly reliable. Our house is a peculiar
one in some respects, but no matter what
ghosts may haunt it we ate not alarmed
that any of them will do us harm. The
poor lieutenant certainly got a fright the
other evening when he chased that face
out of the window, but as nothing was
found on the court below next morning it
is evident that the ghost was nothing
very material. The house has a lively
reputation for ghosts and the longer we
are here the more we hear about them,
Put I do not think there are enough ghosts
in all Oakland to drive us out of our snug
quarters."
As there are about a dozen able young
men in training at the home a lonely
ghost would not stand much show if he
should happen to be caught.
DOCTORS AND POLITICS.
Saturday's Work of tho Health Board
Wag Illegal, and the Ax Fell
. .. ". in Vain.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 3.â Matters in
â¢ th** Board of Health are considerably
mixed. O.i Saturday, as published, the
new board met and proceeded without
delay to turn out all the officials of the
â¢â¢'board and elect their successors. City
Attorney Dow has now rendered an
opinion that the meeting was entirely
illegal and, consequently, all their acts
were null and void, as proper notices were
not sent out.
Tnis leaves the board in an unorganized
condition, without a president, and to
make matters more complex, Dr. A. E.
Small," the family physician of the Mayor,
tendered his resignation. The speed
with which matters were carried out on
Saturday clearly shows that a programme
had been prepared before the doctors took
Ottice, as their appointments were only
fiied early in the morning and thoy met
and changed all the patronage before 2
*" o'clock.
.The resignation of Dr. Small comes as a
great surprise and has added considerable
.interest to what is now a political sensa
tion. .Dr. Small attended the Mayor all
througn the last political campaign, wh*Â»n
Mr. Thomas was seriously ill, and the
â¢only. time he appeared on a public plat
form was when he was accompanied by
bis doctor. In the resignation is an under
lined phrase which reads "I always keep
my word," and this has caused much
comment.
An effort was made to-day to call an
other meeting of the Board of Health for
the purpose of legally making the changes
'â¢in patronage. As there is no president
â  this could only be done by getting the
' signature of three members. Dr. Cham
'. berlain, one of the homeopathic hold
overs, would not sien and of the three
members Dr. Brinckerhoff is out of
town, consequently no meeting could be
held.
In the meantime the members of the
board and Mayor Thomas are trying to
toss the ball of responsibility for Satur
day's hasty proceedings from one to the
other.
Harry Thomas, secretary of the Board
of Works, said his father did not make up
any programme, but that the members of
the Board of Health acted on their own
judgment. .As young Thomas, on account
of his father's illness, was hit right-hand
man during the campaign his utterances
may De regarded as correct.
â  On the other hand one of the three new
members stated he was presented with a
paper containing a list of the changes to
be made, but be declined to say from
whom he received it.
It is now possible that the slate may be
broken. Republicans are makine a loud
protest at the appointment of Dr. Siim
, son for veterinary surgeon and the re
moval of Dr. Pierce. Stimson was an
' out-and-out worker for the fusionists last
-November, while Pierce has always been
an ardent Republican. Paul Schaffer, the
secretary, whose place was illegally given
on Saturday to H. K. Snow, is the son-in
law of Captain Hunt, who worked actively
and spent his money freely in the Repub
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
lican cause and especially for Captain
Thomas, and it is stated that Captain
Thomas promised Hunt that Schtiffer
should not be disturbed, and that the
underlined phrase in Dr. Small's resigna
tion has more than ordinary significance.
Politicians are busy to-night trying to
ferret out the meaning of the whole affair.
This evening the necessary three signa
tures to call a special meeting were ob
tained and the board will meet at 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning.
HILL TO BE BAPTIZED
Dr. Kiimmer Will Receive the Mur
derer Into the M. E. Church.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 3.â To-morrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock Benjamin Hill, the
wife-murderer, whose appeal to the Su
preme Court has been denied, will be bap
tized in the Methodist faith by Dr. Kum
mer in the County Jail.
For several months Hill has professed
conversion, and A. B. Deming, one of his
spiritual advisers, has urged him to be
immersed, according to Scripture, but as
the Methodist faith allows either method,
the form known as "sprinkling" will be
used.
Contrary to the usual custom in such
cases, Hill's jailers believe him to be sin
cere, as he has practiced for several months
what he has preached. When his desire
lor baptism was made known to the Sheriff
he consented to allow the ceremony to be
performed in the jail, and Dr. Kummer
was selected to perform the service.
"The reason I am to be baptized," said
Hill this morning, "is I believe tbe Lord
desires it. 1 intend to obey the command
of Scripture, as lam a Christian. If the
Lord wills I am ready to be hanged at
any time, but if not I shall devote my
life to trying to save the souls of the un
fortunates in the prison."
Hill's attorneys are still trying to save
him from, the gallows, and as soon as he
is resentenced Attorney Bradley will ap
ply to the Governor for a commutation of
sentence. In the meantime a petition is
being circulated on behalf of the con
demned man.
HOAG CHOSEN CAPTAIN.
Berkeley Honors the Successful Base
ball Player.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 3 âWilliam B. '
Hoag, familiarly known among his fel
lows as ''Diddy," has been chosen captain
of the victorious University of California
baseball team for the year 1897-9 S. By a
unanimous vote cast last night st tho
banquet of the team after the game the
plucky little center-fielder, who has prob
ably won more distinction for the Berke
ley nine this season than any other man,
excepting perhaps Captain Elston, was
elected to lead the team of IS9S.
Hoag's career in the diamond has been
a particularly brilliant one. During the
season of games just closed he piled up a
list of more home runs than any other
man on the team, and in the three con
tests with Stanford did not make a single
error.
COLLEGE AND RELIGION.
Grneral Tendency at Berkeley
Declared to Be Not Anti-
Christian.
Seniors Express Their Views on the
Matter at Trinity Methodist
Chnrch.
BERKELEY, Cal,, May 3.â The Uni
versity of California is not altogether a
â¢oul-destroying institution, according to
the sentiments of a symposium of seniors
at Trinity Methodist Church last evening.
The members of the graduating class who
are connected with the church were in
vited by Dr. Bentley, the pastor, to ex- j
press their views on "The Religious Ele
ment in Education, Viewed from the
Standpoint of Experience." The entire
evening was turned over to the student
speakers, and a large concourse gathered
to hear them.
Two of the prospective graduates â Miss
A. R. Kemble and A. G. Van Gorder â had
found in their college life influences anti
religious, but not over powerful, while the
remainder declared Berkeley to be a good
place for spiritual erowth.
"I never knew," said Miss Kemble,
"what it was to be criticized for being a
Christian until I came here. I nuver had
to face sarcasm for that before."
Before coming to Berkeley the lady had
studied in a sectarian school in the East.
She drew a comparison between that in
stitution and California, declaring it to be
impossible for the latter, as a State uni
versity, to teach religion, but the students
at Berkeley need not lose grace.
Van Gorder, who is to be one of the
commencement speakers, declared that a
college course raises doubts in religious
matters. In the preparatory schools it is
the memory that is exercised, but in col
lege years reason is cultivated and a phil
osophical mind is developed in every true
student. Of course, doubts are raised, and
they ought to be. The mind is enlarged
and new points of view are developed.
S. W. Cartwright said that Berkeley has
a bad reputation in the interior, where
those who go to join its ranks are consid
ered "lost." He opposed such a view and
maintained that he had found a better
Christian atmosphere in Berkeley than
where else he had been. P&^SKQHi
Miss E. Turner also stated that there is
no need for university students to drop
religion, and L. E. Reynolds declared that
he had been warned that the University
of California was a bad place for souls,
but he had tried to develop mind and soul
together.
Brief Items.
The Berkeley Bible Seminary closed last Sat
urday for tbe summer vacation.

Pitiful Experience of a
Young Mother in the
Chabot Home.
Deserted by Her Husband aDd
Unable to Support Herself
and Little Ones.
The Father Said Farewell and N*ver
Cam Back, bat Followed a
Fake Friend's Advice
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 3. j
Mrs. Thomas P. Craig, who bas been
admitted to the Chabot Home, tells a
story or poverty and desertion such as is
rarely met with even in an institution
where cases such as hers are common. -
According to the woman's story she was
in such poverty when her little baby was
born that newspapers were the only cov
ing on her bed. Two months ago Mrs.
Craig was the happy wife of Thomas
The Two Little Craigs, Who Have Been Deserted by Their Father.
Craig of San Francisco, who was con
nected with the Pacific Coast Dental and
Medical Collection Agency. They then
lived on Mission street, near Sixth, in San
Francisco, and on the 15th of last -month
her landlady told her to vacate her rooms,
as the rent was long unpaid.
Some days afterward the landlady took
possession of all Mrs. Craig's personal
property, but worse than all, stripped the
bedclothing from the bed. The night this
occurred a little girl was born and the
only substitute for clothing was a parcel
of newspapers. At this time the family
was practically penniless.
"When the baby was a week old," said
Mrs. Craig, "my husband came home,
kissed us all good-by and said he would be
back shortly, but he never returned again.
I cannot account for his disappearance
and I have made inquiries wherever he
was known, but no tidings have been re
ceived. The kindliest construction I can
put upon his strange conduct is that his
mind may have become unbalanced and
he has wandered off.
"I am, however, inclined to the opinion
that he has been persuaded to forsake his
family through the influence of one of bis
iormer partners. One night on the other
side of the folding doors I overheard a
conversation between my husband and the
man I refer to. He was persuading Mr.
Craig to leave his family and urging him
not to be tied up to a wife and liitle chil
dren. My husband refused to entertain
his proposition, but a lew days later he
disappeared. I have written to all places
where be was known, but with no result.
"In my helpless and desperate condi
tion, with the landlady threatening to put
me and my babies on the street, I was
compelled to tell my story to my friends.
I came to Oakland with a friend and was
taken to the home of Mrs. Lane, a kind
hearted member of the Baptist church,
who kept us a week. Â-,.â¢--%_,.'*
"Our case was then presented to the
Chabot Home and we were brought here.
1 am in a desperate condition, but cannot
think of parting with my children, and at
present I cannot see how it is possible for
me to obtain work and keep them with
me. I have no plans, and am simply
waiting and hoping that my husband will
be found."
Mr. Craig is a well-educated gentlemanly
Scotchman, and has always shown a
marked loyalty and devotion to his fam
ily. His strange conduct cannot be ex
plained by any of his friends, but the mis

frail, is still pursuing her inquiries, in the
hope that in some manner she may find
relief. j - ' * - - JyyJtir^

Alameda City Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 3.â The City
Trustees reduced to-night from $10 to $5
the license on billiard tables. This was at
the request of the proprietors of one of
tbe "billiard parlors." Saloons pay no
license on tables, as they come under the
eeneral yearly license of $500. . , Trustee
Brick advocated a general readjustment
of business licenses, claiming that they
are unequal, that the city is not deriving
the income that it should and that the
gratuitous license petitions are being
overdone. The time for this read justment
was inopportune, however, the license year
having expired with the month of April,
and bo no action was taken on the sugges
tion. â¢*-â¢'â¢-."â¢.

this suggestion would be acted upon now
that the construction account is closed in
order that interest and wear and tear may
be computed.

WHY LITTLEFIELD
USED HIS FOOT
Booted a Liquor-Seller off
the Corral Hollow Com
pany's Property.
_
Poured Whisky on the Ground
and Afterward Kicked
the Smuggler.
The Superintendent Is Arrested for
Battery, and Says He Is Anx'oui
to B- Heard in Court
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908. Broadway, May 3. f
i Superintendent Littlefield of the Corral
Hollow coal mines will be tried at Liver
more this week on a charge of battery.
The circumstances attending it are rather
unusual.
Mr. Littlefield applied his boot in an
unceremonious manner to Constantino
Machia, who has persisted in trying to
sell liquor upon the premises owned by
the coal-mine company. Mr. Littlefield
has made a rule that no liquor shall be
sold on the premises, nor supplied to the
men if it be possible to avoid it. For a
long time he has been bothered by people
who surreptitiously carried liquor on the
premises and sold it to the miners. Upon
the principle that the company would be
held responsible for accidents arising
from incompetent employes, the superin
tendent argues that he is -justified in using
all the means within his power to keep
liquor-dealers away.
Last week Constantino Machia of Liver
more had several jugs of whisky in a
wagon on the premises. What occurred is
best related by Mr. Littlefield:
"This man Machia," he said, "and two
other dealers of Livermore, have been fur
nishing the miners with whisky. Not
withstanding tbe strict prohibitory meas
ures we have enforced to keep liquor away
from the mines, they have found a way to
bring it there. , Not long ago I met Machia
with a load of whisky in a wagon, which
he was driving on our property. I ordered
him off the place and warned him never
to bring liquor there again. I asked him
if be understood me, and he answered
that he did. A few days afterward I
learned that he was bringing up liquor to
the miners after nightfall, arriving some
times as late as midnight.
"Finally last week Machia grew bolder
and came to the mines with a load of
liquor. I met him just off the county
road and did not lose any time pulling
bim out of his wagon and attempting to
kick a little docency into him. I then
broke all his whisky-jugs and compelled
him to leave the premises."
Mr. Littlefield was afterward arrested
on a charge of battery, and he declares he
is quite willing for the case to come to a
speedy trial. He says he is a busy man,
and it is his duty to protect the interests
ol" the property and lives placed in his
charge, and as his time is limited he in
stituted a speedy and effective method of
abatinz what he considered a nuisance.
At the mines several hundred people are
employed. Before the mines were opened
many of these men constituted the unem
ployed of Livermore and locality, and the
residents of the town have expressed
their willingness to support Mr. Little
field in his task of keeping liquor from the
miners.
The case will be tried before Judge Tay
lor some day this week. J .' .J\JJ.

THE MONTICELLO.
! Judge Morrow Award*! Three Hundred
and Fifty Dollars for Towing
Her Into Safety.
United States District Judge Morrow
yesterday rendered an opinion in the case
of the Pacific Improvement Company
against the steamship Montlcello, Z. J.
Hatch claimant, a libel for salvage services.
Judge Morrow said: , fi-r
I am of the opinion that the service ren
dered it) the case at bar, 11 it can bo deemed a
salvage service at all, is of a very low order.
The Monticeilo was not in any Immediate
peril or danger, nor does the evidence indicate
â¢that she would have been in a dangerous
position before the arrival of the tugs which
had been sent for. The San Benito did not ex
perience any risk or peril in rendering the
service, and beyond a delay of five hours, a
slight shift of her cargo, the chafing of ncr
hawser and the loss of some rope, does not ap
pear to have suffered any particular incon
venience. It was testified that the charge for
towage services by a tug from the locality
where the San Benito towed the Mouticello
would be from $125 to $250. The claimant
had tendered th.- cum ot $200. lam of the
opinion, however, that under the circum
stances the San Benito is entitled to more than
the amount tendered,' and something more
thanjthe ordinary towage compensation.
I snail allow the sum of $350, which amount
will cover the damage done to the hawser and
the loss of the rope. A decree will be entered
in accordance with this opinion.

Mrs. Huntington the Guest of
Honor at the Elaborate
Function.
Guests Applaud Major Darling's New
Musical Composition, " Dsar,
Do You Remember ?"
To Mrs. Darling must be accredited the
honor of presiding at the most elegant
and elaborate function of the post-Lenten
season. This great affair was a musicale
and tea given yesterday afternoon in the
rarlors of the Occidental Hotel compli
mentary to Mrs. Collis P. Huntington,
who, with her distinguished husband, is
spending a few weeks at the white man
sion on the hill.
Mrs. Darling proved her rare tact and
hospitable qualification by giving an en
tertainment in exact accordance with the
taste of ber guest.
Mrs. Huntington is passionately fond of
music, but prefers the quiet pleasures of
the home circle to the delights of the
crowded drawing-room. Consequently a
musical programme was a necessity, and
a small gathering equally important. Out
of her long visiting list of 600 Mrs. Darling
selected 150 favored namesâ no easy taskâ
and with equal good taste provided for
the afternoon an excellent musical pro
gramme. :â¢â ".:.: rJj';''
The large drawing-room of the Occiden
tal was a beautiful picture with its ex
quisite decorations in honor of the occa
sion.
Glowing crimson, the artillery color, was
used with exquisite and artistic effect.
Long streamers of crimson buntinc,
draped the walls, being fastened at regu
lar intervals by golden stars. On the
mantel were roses galore and on the long
table from which the refreshments were
served deep red carnations made a most
elaborate decoration.
The hours of the tea were from 3 to 5,
during wnich ladies . . and gentlemen
crowded the rooms to listen to the excel
lent music and i?reat the distinguished
visitor. After 4 o'clock Mr. Huntington
joined the throng and added his commen
dation to that of the many in praise of
Major Darling's latest musical composition
"Dear, Do You Remember?" Other gems
from the same prolific source formed a
part of the programme, noted as the com
positions of August Mignon, the name
under which the gallant Major vainly
strives to hide his merits. Jj'-Jj'J
The programme of the afternoon in full
was as follows:
"Blessed Dreams" (August Mignon). "The
Old, Old Siory" (Blumenthal), "Dear, Do You
Remember?" (August Mignon), Mrs. Etta li.
Blanchara, contralto; "Vaise Caprice" (August
Mignon), '"Love's Dream" \P. Liszt). Miss
Carrie Bowes, pianist; "For My Dear Lady's
Sake" (August Mignon), "Dolly" (August Mig

leading social events of the season.
The event will take place on the even*

25 Page street, and the youn***ters are
drilling at every available opportunity

The exhibition will consist of many
fancy evolutions in addition to the move

company on the eventful night will be
commanded by Captain L. E. Edwards, the
chief officer of the cadets.
There is but one company, in the High

to a high state of efficiency by constant
practice. The ball to which the boys are
looking forward with much pleasurable
anticipation is to be held on the 25tb inst.

HABITS OF THE HEN.
The Case of Cruelty Against Miss Mary
McKlaney, Schoolteacher, Dis
missed.
Miss Mary McKinney, a schoolteacher,
was up before Judge Joacbimsen yester
day to answer a charge of cruelty to ani
mals.
It appears that a pullet belonging to
Mrs. K. Floethr, a housewife, living at 411
Thirty-fifth avenue, strayed away a weeK
ago and went foraging into the McKinney
yard. .'."_ V
The neighbor objected to having her
plants pecked by the fowl and, according
to Mrs. Floethr, proceeded to belabor tho
hen with a cluo, ultimately casting it
over the fence into the Floethr yard, and
in due time, according to the testimony,
it had to be killed, properly cooked and
dined off by the family.
Attorney Cabani3s, for the defense, won
his case by his bright answer to the state
ment made by the Judge, which held that
it was the natural instinct of the hen to
roam about and seek her food where she
might best get it. He replied that it was
the natnral instinct of the human being to
protect his property against the predatory
habits of any. animal, even the chicken.
Coroner's Inquests.
The Coroner's jury held two inquests yester
day, one on the body of Mrs. Mary R. Loring,
who died suddenly on April 18. The verdict
was that her death was caused by injuries In
flicted by her husband, Robert Loring, while
she whs in a delicate condition. Loring was
booked altorward on a charge of murder.
The other case was that of Mrs. Mary Lem
rners, asphyxiated by gas at her residence,
2198 Devisadero street, on April 24. The ver
dict was that she came to her death acci
dentally."' y-rj

PLENTY OF PRUNES
AFTER THE DROP
Orchards So Burdened With
Fruit That They Must
Be Thinned Out.
Late Frost Did Slightly Nip the
Apricots, but the Yield
Will Be Good.
Lsading Houses Receive Encouraging
R ports From the Fruit.Pro
ducing Districts.
Reports by wire and letter that the
prunes were rapidly dropping in the
orchards of Vacaville, Visalia, Sonoma I
and Santa Clara, caused some alarm
among dealers in this City yesterday.
A prominent orchardist near Saratoga
wrote to Porter Brothers last Saturday that J
the prune crop there would be lighter this J
season than it was last year. Three or four j
other letters of a similar character, one |
from Sonoma County, another from Visa
lia and one from Vacaville, created the
impression that the crop of prunes and i
apricots might be seriously affected. It
was said that the north winds and change
abe weather at the times the prunes were
setting nad caused the unusual dropping. ,
Inspection of reports from every fruit- j
growing region of the State gives no just
cause for alarm. The Castle Brothers keep
very weil posted aud assert that nothing
has been received that justify vie predic
tion of a diminished yield. On the con
trary the reports from agents in Santa
Clara, Sonoma and Solano counties indi
cate tnat the crop will be larger.
Sidney Smith of the Cutting Packing
Company has an excellent system of ob- !
taming and charting reports irom ail the
great iruit-producing sections of Califor
nia. The prune, apricot, peach, cherry
and plum charts were placed before a
Call reporter yesterday. At the same
time the reports for the week ending last
Saiurday were exhibited in connection
witn the charts. In order to fix a line of
measurement last year's yield is placed in
each district at 100 points. Many predic
â¢ tions of 200 or a quantity twice as large
us that produced last yearâ are noted. In
a very few instances only do the returns
go below 100.
The dropping of the prunes is readily
explained by the immense quantity of
fruit borne "by the trees*, li they did
not drop they would not be larger than
ctierries.
One orchardist wrote to Cutting & Co.
that he had thinned and thinned, spend
ing an hour or more on a tree, and yet the
oranches were so heavily laden that one
could not tell where the thinning had been
done.
It is claimed that there must be a great
dropping of prunes in order to develop
the fruit on the trees. Nature is now
taking the proper course for giving a good
crop of fair-sized prunes and apricots.
The reports from the lower San Joaquin
Valley and Southern California are en
couraging. Peaches are promised in abund
ance.
Sonoma 13 not a big peach county, but
cherries and prunes are produced there i.i
large quantities and the outlook is good.
Santa Clara County is the great prune
and apricot region of California, and de
spite the recent dropping, the tree** are
overburdened and much thinning must yet
be dove.
Yuba and Sutter counties produce gieat
quantities of peaches, and the outlook for
a large yield is excellent.
Notning to cause the slightest discour
agement has been received by the Cutting
Packing Company from Tehama, Sutter,
Placer, Solano, Sonoma ana Santa Clara
counties.
The frost hit the apricots in the region
of Visalia, but the yield of other fruits will
be large. Frora the orchards immediately
around the town 500 carloads will be
shipped.
Last year the pear crop was' large and
bids fair to be good this season. Cherries
promise a fair yield.
The apricot yield, according to reports
from Haywards and San Leandro and
other places in Alameda County, will be
large.
In looking over the situation carefully
Castle Bros, and the people of the Cutting
Packing Company see nothing to cause
discouragement. In some sections rain is
needed to increase tne size of the fruit.
Castle Bros, have not discoverad any
particular demand for prunes now on
hand, so it is reasoned that dealers do not
anticipate a short crop.
Reports from the East are studied with
absoi bing interest. Should the fruit crop
in New York, Michigan and Georgia prove
light, as foreshadowed by reports some
days since, there will be an increased de
mand for California products.
THREE BRAVE GREEKS.
They Leave California To-Day to Fight
for Their Country.
Three brave Greeks of this City have
disposed of all their earthly possessions,
have received the blessing cf the Bishop
of the mother church and will start to
day for their native land to take up arms
against the unspeakable, but rather nu
merous Turk.
The loyal sons of tbe mother of the arts
are Alexander Mavrigis, Mitchel Cb.
Markus and Elepherios Elenheriou. They
called yesterday upon A. Gousiiaux, the
Acting Consul for Greece, and informed
him of their intention. He praised them
for their noble resolve. Then they went
to the Orthodox Greek Catholic Church,
of whicn the Czar of Russia is the head,
and told Bishop Nicholas that they were
going home to tight for their country.
The Bishop gave them the blessing of
the church and took down their nances so
that he might offer up special prayers for
them while the war lasted.
The Greeks here like the Russian Bishop
Nicholas, because he sympathizes with
their cause. It was only the other day
when he gave $50 to the fund for the
suffering Cretans.

Attorney Shortridge Pulls Chestnuts
From the Fire That Were Not
Relished by the Prosecution.
Another piece of the story of the mis
management of the People's Home Savings
Bank was told yesterday in Judge Dain
gerfieid's court. Metaphorically speaking
it was a link in the claim Attorney Samuel
M. Shortridge has promised to forge con
necting Judge Hebbard with the actions
of John F. Sneehan as receiver of the in
stitution, and which would justify Editor
MairiQttof the News Letter in expressing
the opinion that Hebbard was the "tool"
and ''creature" of the ring in control of
the assets of the bank.
Now, to go back nearly three years, in
June, 1894, there was much dissatisfac
tion among the depositors over Sheehan's
conduct of the bank. Indignation meet
ings were irequent, and the speakers did
not hesitate to express their mind in very
emphatic and sarcastic terms about the
matter. At a mass-meeting at which 1600
of the depositors in the defunct bank were
represented resolutions were adopted ac- ;
cusing Sneehan of many misdemeanors,
among others of causing to be published
j statements tending to undervalue the
assets of the bank.
This action, it is said, caused many of
the depositors to sell their bankbooks to
speculators at a sacrifice. In fact, some
of the executive committee of the depos
itors accused Sheehan of running a little
; speculative syndicate on his own account,
j but that's another story, which may prob-
I ably be fully ventilated before tne case is
i concluded. :' .-"
Now Sheeban was appointed by Judge
i Hebbard, and in his capacity as receiver
j of the bank was, as lawyers say, the serv
; ant of the court. Attorney Shortridge
; was endeavoring to show that the court
was made aware of its servant's shortcom
ings. To do this he put Harrison D. Pike
on the stand to testify that as secretary of
; the meeting he had forwarded a copy of
these resolutions, reciting Sheehan's mis
conduct, to Judge Hebbard. That was
one of tne "links in the chain." Then, by
way of making a good job of it. he asked
that a copy of these resolutions be read to
the jury, and therein he stirred up Heb
bard's wrath.
Attorney Julius Kahn and Assistant
Prosecuting Attorney Hinkle performed
all sorts of legal gyrations in their efforts
to prevent the reading of those famous
resolutions. Judge Hebbard himself as
sisted in the fight.
The resolutions were type-written and
of course very interesting reading. Judge
Daingerfield was for putting Attorney
Shortridge to the trouble of proving all
facts recited in them before they might
be read. The lawyer was willing to do
this if it took all summer just to show
j that Judge Hebbard knew wuat Sheehan
j was doing, and how distasteful bis aciions
i as receiver were to the depositors.
Then there were arguments as to the
weight of the resolutions as evidence, not
avoirdupois, but in the legal measure.
This, according to Attorney Shortridge,
was a matter for the jury to decide. Their
competency was first to be determined, he
argued.
Then it was that Kahn invoked ad
journment. Shortridge managed, how
ever, to let the jury hear a few of the spicy
paragraphs the depositors adopted, and
the wrangle will be resumed this morning.
Incidentally,' the evidence of Pike de
veloped that he had strong opinions . con
cerning Judge Hebbard, much stronger
than Editor Marriott had expressed. Also
the proceedings developed a phase of the
late political campaign, wherein Judge
Hebbard was hooted at a public meeting.
The resolutions were adopted at a mass
meeting of tie depositors, and Pike, as
secretary, stated lhat he had forwarded a
copy of them to Judge Hebbard through
the mail. The executive committee of
seven, representing the depositors, had
been for some time previously vainly
struggling with Judge Hebbard to allow
the old board of directors to resign, and
the adoption of these resolutions was a
sort of forlorn hope. Still, they were in
the nature of a last appeal to the heart of
tbe court. - J'\ 'JJ Jj" : -
Attorney Shortridge then made a formal
request to introduce the resolutions into
the record and read them to the jury. At
torney Kahn dramatically declared that
the men who drafted them should have
been cited for contempt of court by Judge
Hebbard for daring to criticize the actions
of Sheehan. ,
"Well, why didn't he do it? ' queried
Shortridge, but Kahn made a new tack.
He was for having all the acts recited in
the resolutions proved by means of wit
nesses. -; A*
"Well, we'll do that in time, all right,"
was the ready response of Attorney Short
ridge. -J JJJ -J'
Judge Daingerfield asked if it was in
cumbent upon Judge Hebbard to act in
accordance with the tenor of the resolu
tions. 'J'JJj.
"We are not complaining that he did
act," said Shortridge, "but that he did
not act and remove the receiver after he
was informed of his misdoings. He re
mained passive with the knowledge of
these facts before him, and we are simply
reciting these circumstances to bring
home to Judge Hebbard his connection
with the matter."
Then Judi*e Daingerfield inquired if
Judge Hebbard had b**Â»en asked to act in
the matter in court. yyJ'Jr.
He was informed that many people had
appeared before Judge Hebbard to request
him to modify his injunction restraining
the ola board of directors from resigning
as they wished to, in order to make room
for other directors selected by the de
positors. .
Again Attorney Shortridge offered the
resolutions as evidence. He asked Judge
Daingerfield to read them, but the court
said the communication did not mace it
incumbent upon Judge Hebbard to take
official cognizance of it.
"These matters should be brought home
to Judgeâ"
"Well, that's just what I am doing," re
plied Shortridge.
Judge Daingerfield asked if application
had ever been made for Sheehan's re
moval. JyJyJ~::y
"Yes ; to remove the whole caboodle of
them before Judge Seawell's court," was
the reply. y *-"â¢
"Now, granting that the receiver did
certain wrong things," continued Short
ridge, "we must bring it home to the
Knowledge of Judge Hebbard; that's what
we are doing. The most honest Judge
in tne world might be the 'tool' of wicked
men. v How else can we prove this? The
receiver wouldn't come into court and tell

han bad caused statements to be pub*
lished of the assets of the bank which
scared depositors into parting with their
bankbooks at a big discount. Pike re
lated how the committee appointed by the
depositors had attempted to get access to
the bank record, and were denied even ac
cess to the building after Sheehan had
learned that he was not wanted in charge
of the management of the affairs of the
institution. To retain his position the
receiver had requested Secretary Palmer
of the bank to get signature to a circular
requesting that he continue in charge of
the bank. This was a "bogus" circular,
said Pike, but the words jarred on Kahn's
ear. Pfke said, when he presented his
cause against Hebbard, the Judge pulled
this same "bogus" circular from his
pocket to offset his own document.
"Did you explain to General Sheeban
thatyou were secretary of the depositors'
committee?"
"I called on Mr. Sheehan and informed
him of our committee, and he was at first
very courteous." ,-{i
"When did the change come over the
spirit of his dream?"
"As soon as he learned we were not in
favor of him retaining control of the bant.
Afterward he misrepresented our commit
tee to everybody."
There was a meeting of the bank de
positors in the Bush-street Theater on the
Saturday preceding the last election.
Judge Hebbard had found his way there,
but was hooted and jeered, said Pike.
"How did he act?" asked Shortridge.
Kahn objected, and Shortridge added
that maybe the answer would show that
Judge Hebbard was unfitted for the
bench. :-yj :
Upon cross-examination Pike told
Attorney Kabn he had been in the| State
five years. The legal adviser of Judge
Hebbard asked Pike for some of his
opinions of his judicial client.
"Did you ever call Judge Hebbard a
murderer at any of your committee meet*
ings?" asked Kabn.
"Yes, I think I have," replied Pike.
"Did you ever call him a thief?"
"Yes."
"Did you ever call him a liar?"
"Yes," was the laconic answer.
"Did you ever send any anonymous let
ters to him?"
"I never sent an anonymous letter in
my life." â¢
Attorney Shortridge thought the ques
tion ridiculous, and when Kahn attempted
to justify it by relating that Mrs. Heb
bard had received many anonymous let
ters threatening disaster to her nusband,
Judge Daingerfield ordered it blotted from
the record.
Kabn then desired to know if Pike ever
contemplated making an effort to get the
secretaryship of the bank and received a
negative reply. jr
T. H. McCarthy, chairman <jf the execu
tive committee of the depositors, cor
roborated Pike's recital of Sheehan's re
fusal to allow anybody to see the bank
records.
McCarthy presided at tbe meeting of
the depositors at the Bush-street Theater
on the Saturday evening preceding elec
tion. Admittance wis by bat: book or
certificates from the California Safe De
posit Company. After the meeting had
opened Judge Hebbard was seen coming
down the aisle to the stage. It transpired
that he had a number of his adherents in
the front seats to break up the meeting if
possible. McCartny recalled Milk In
: spector Dockery and Court Clerk Fitz
gerald among them. They were not de
positors, and McCarthy was unable to
say how they gained admittance.
"By the way, how did- Judge Hebbard
get in?" asked Attorney : Shortridge; but
this too was a conundrum. Hebbard had
made his way to the stage and asked per
mission to address the audience. The
people refused to listen to him; there
upon he retired. ... _ .;},";. -
Once again Attorney Shortridge asked
permission to read the* resolutions to the
court reporter and jury. He argued that
they would show that judge Hebbard was
aware what Sheehan was doing, and that
as a Judge in a court of' equity he should'
have taken notice of the acts of his ser
vants. Sheehan's actions as receiver bound
Judge Hebbard, who appointed him. He
was Hebbard's "creature," so to speak.
The attorney began to read the resolu
tions, to the general discomfiture of Judge
Hebbard and 1 , his attorneys. When he
came to a recital of Sheehan's attempt to
undervalue the assets of the bank he ob
tained from McCarthy the information
that Sheehan baa told him that the de
positors would not get more than 25 or 30
cents on the dollar. ? ~ â
"I advised him not to talk like that,','
continued McCarthy. '*,.' "To tell you the
truth, 1 thought he was standing in on
some kind of a deal." : .
Attorney Shortridge was then ; inter-,
rupted by adjournment. To-day the-re
mainder of the resolutions will be read,
and thus an important link forged in the
Hebbard-Sheehan chain. - .]

BANQUET OF GOOD THINGS
A Kearny-street House Makes
a Dazzling Display of Fine
Clothes.
J W. Raphael & Cd. Hava Outdone
Themselves This Time in Artistic
Window Arrangements.
It requires but a glance at the surging
mass of people that clamor around the
show windows of J. W.Raphael & Co.
from early morn until late at night, en
deavoring to obtain a peep at the unique
and handsome window display, to fully
realize that San Franciscans are art-loving
people.
"The Feast of the Season," as the dis
play is called, was designed and arranged
by E. C. Hiller, head of the staff of win
dow-trimmers of the big Kearny-street
firm.
Occupying the center position in the
show window is a dining table spread
with whitest drapery, finest crystal
and choicest china. Arranged with great
taste are flowers and fruit, and all is in
readiness for a royal feast.
The feast of the viands is, of course, de
signed to call attention to the yet more
elaborate banquet of clothing buyers a
special departure made mis week, and
certainly calculated in itself to attract an
unusual share of attention.
Some of the finest examples of tailoring
ever sent forth from the manufactories â
consisting of the richest and best fabrics
and the latest and best styles to be had â
surround the suggestive dining table.
It is the great "ten-dollar sale" of suits
and overcoats, whose regular values range
around and about $20, but which J. W.
Raphael & Co., with the object of drawing
to their great store the thrones which
they so delight in, have cheerfully de
cided to sacrifice.
When it is considered that from amid
this great mass of handsome clothing the
buyer is invited to pick and choose, al
ways for the same extremely low price,
the point in calling tbis "The Feast of the
Season" may readily be seen.

bullets. The wounds are not dangerous. ;
George was arrested and booked at the

present with full ranks in Golden Gate
Hall last night for tne purpose of electing

The reports of the outgoing officers
showed tbat the commandery had a mem
bership of 295. Thirteen members died
during the yeai and forty-three new mem
bers were received within the castle, mak
ing a net gain of thirty. This ia a remark
ably good showing for a commandery only
sixteen years old.

whom fell the mantle of preference, for
there was practically no opposition. The
following are the officers for the ensuing
term: IJAJ- '.-.
Jonathan M. Peel, commander; Charles
L. Patton, generalissimo; J. C. Campbell,
captain-general; Robert Ash, prelate; H.

recorder; John Gilson, senior warden; S.
L. Lent, junior warden.
The installation will take place two
weeks from last night.
Commander-elect Peel is a native son,
having been born in San Francisco. He
was educated in the public schools of this
City and graduated from the High School.
He graduated from the Cooper "Medical
College in 1888. Three years ago he mar
ried the daughter of a Sir Knight, having
first met the young lady at the Triennial
Conclave in. 1883. He is an enthusiastic
Mason, having become a member of Gold
en Gate Commandery seven years ago,
and having filled all the subordinate
chairs.' \
After the close of the session last even-

TO BREAK THAT
HYPNOTIC SPELL
Jacob Kline Causes * the
Arrest of His Son
Edward.
The Lad Was a " Subject for
Students of the Strange
Power.
He Got Five Dollars a Week and
Board for Being Stage Property
in an Institute.
Edward Kline, a boy 18 years of age,
who for the past few months has been act
ing as a "subject" in the Pacific Hypnotic
Institute at 44 Sixth street, was arrested
last evening for vagrancy.
Back af this common-place entry on the
prison book there is an interesting story
that throws some light upon the inside
facts concerning the institute.
This place has already come to the
notice of the public through the some
what sensational marriage of the business
manager. Dr. H. M. : Thornton, with a
young woman who, it is claimed, plays
musical instruments by the inspiration of
powers not wholly her own. The charges
of the girl's family that Thornton was
already married caused the bride to take
poison and the groom to go into a hyp
notic fit, from which both recovered.
As stated, the story of the boy Kline is
interesting. The complaint upon which
he was arrested was made by his father,
Jacob Kline, a hard- wonting German who
resides at 511 Minna street. According to
the tale of the parents the lad was obedi
ant and industrious until he met Perry H.
Baker, whose cards state that he is an
instructor in hypnotism in the institute
named. From that time on, the parents
state, Edward has stayed away from home
and been entirely under the influence of
the disciples of Mesmer.
They have made repeated efforts, they
state, to see the boy, but to no purpose.
At one time the hypnotists asserted that
they did not know where the boy was.
At another time the mother received a
rambling letter from her son, who was in
hiding in Oakland, in which he asserted
that he was bound for Alaska, and that he
had money enough to travel all over the
world. Trie poor woman was almost wild
with grief, for she could not get any defi
nite knowledge of her boy.
A few days ago tbe angry relatives of
Thornton's young wife told the Klines
that their son was still at the institute
and under the control of Baker & Co. The
case was reported at police - headquar
ters, but the lad could not be found. The
next move was to report the matter to
Colonel Parnell, secretary of the Society
for tbe Prevention of Cruelty to Children
Last evening Officer McMurray, detailed
to special duty for the society, went to the
institute and had a long talk with
Hypnotist Baker. This man's account of
young Kline's connection with the insti
tute was a revelation.
He said the boy is an excellent subject
and when under hypnotic influence isa
great clairvoyant. He sees wonderful
things. The lad is particularly valuable
as a subject for students of hypnotism,
Bauer's pupils, to practice their newly de
veloping powers upon. He yields readiiy
to their influence. In fact, of all bis sub
jects, Baker said, Kline was the favorite.
Baker sr.id that he pays Kline $5 a week,
and gives him his board and lodging for
his services, and added that the boy is
! worth three times as much.
Upon the officer demanding to see the
lad Baker left the room and was gone for
several minutes before returning with
young Kline, wbo is a short, stoutly built
youngster. The latter answered ques
tions readily and told a long story as to
why he left his home, the burden of
which was that his mother took all the
money he earned and nagged him all of
the time, while his father was accustomed
to beat him. The youngster expressed
himself as highly pleased with his pres
ent occupation of "going to sleep" at the
will of others.
Baker interjected that in the beginning
Mrs. Kline was only too glad to have her
son hypnotized at $5 per week and
"found," as she wanted him to ba a
mediMTO. Officer McMurray called upon
the family a little later and the father and
mother refuted all of the statements made
by Baker and the boy, who they claimed
must have been made to say wnat he did
through Baker's strange power. Not only
did tbey deny having been . cruel, but
they denied that their son bad been ad
dicted to strong drink and tbe cigarette
habit, as the boy and Baker had claimed.
They denounced this as a fabrication
uttered to advertise tbe institute. It took
but a short time for: them to decide that
their son must not remain in such sur
roundings and Mr. Kline accompanied
the officer back to the institute. The offi
cer, who had learned a trick or two. gave
five raps on the door, which was opened
without delay. This rap, so the lad after
ward stated, meant that a friend wanted
to enter.
â  Mr. Kline had not s?en his son for sev
eral weeks and was much surprised to see
: the lad grown so thin. Hi* was formerly
! rosy checked and very fleshy. Upon
being confronted by the stories he had told
to the officer, the young "subject" ack
nowledged tnat he had not told the facts, \
and that the only complaint he had to 1
make was that his mother would not let I
him run around nights with the boys.
Then it was that he denied his former
story, and said that his parents never beat*
him. ' The charge of vagrancy was placed
against him in order to get the boy away
from the influence of those who conduct
and frequent the hypnotic institute.
AT THE FARMERS' CLUB,
Interesting Subjects Discussed and
Committees Appoiuted.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Farmers' Club was held last evening in
the Mills building, E. F. Adams presid
ing. The greater part of the evening was
spent in a discussion of the works and
policy of the ciub for the coming year.
Joseph J. Clappell. W. H. Russell and
George Morehouse were appointed on the
membership committee, B. N. Rowley, J*
M. Carroll ar.d E. F. Adams on tbe pres Ã

After some discussion on the question,
it was decided to take up the free market
j as a subject for the next discussion.

CROSSED THE LAST BAR
Death of Captain J. H. Blethen,
Formerly Chief Wharf
inger.
Ho Was a Pioneer and Weil Known in
Shipping Circles â First Skipper
of the Webb Line.
Captain J. H. Blethen, a well-known
pioneer and at one time chief wharfinger,
died at the residence of his son-in-law,
518 Devisadero street, last Sunday night.
He was one of the best known men in tbe
State, and both he and his sons have been
connected with the shipping of California
from the days of '49. His son, J. H.
Blethen Jr., was at one time "captain of
the watch" at Meiggs wharf, and since
that time he held various positions of
trust along the front.
Captain Blethen was 83 years of age and
was born in Brunswick, Me. When a ;
youth he came to San Fran cisco,. and in
1850 he was running as master of one of
the Central American packets. Later he
joined the Pacific Mail Company and was
one of its most trusted employes.
Captain Blethen was the first skipper
that ever piloted one of the old Webb line
from San Francisco to Australia. This
was years ago and the big side-wheeler
was a revelation to the people of Auck
land and Sydney. The company did not
make expenses, however, and the vessels
were withdrawn. Captain Blethen re
tired from the sea and a few years later
was appointed chief wharfinger of tbe
port. When his term was up be retired
from active life and eschewed politic*.
He was the father of J. H. Blethen Jr.

THE SEW FREE MARKET.
Country Producers Will Ask Why It Is
Delayed. â ,?. :'J. I'A.'-
Word was received yesterday by John
T. Randolph that there is a concerted
movement among the fruit-growers of
Sacramento and Santa Clara counties to
insist that the Harbor Commissioners
take immediate steps to carry out the law
that requires the building of a free mar
ket.
There is also, it is said by those inter
ested, a concerted movement among tbe
produce-dealers of the City to oppose the
building of the market, lt is expected
that there will be a mass-meeting of the
producers at an early date, and the result
will probably be an inquiry as to why
steps are not taken to carry out the pro
visions of the law. Jj'jjy
Chased Her With a Baaor.
Mrs. M. S. Lavalle, 3134 Sixteenth street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Low's court yes
terday charging her husband, George Lavalle,
with disturbing the peace. Mrs. Lavalle re

morning her husband went to her house and
chased her out and around the neighborhood
with a razor in his hand, threatening to carve
