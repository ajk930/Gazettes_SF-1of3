Heaviest Storm ia New Eng
land S.nce 1888
JACKSONVILLE, Fla... Jan. 28.âFl*r
y was visited this morning by the coid-
VeM weather of the winter, the mercury
\ telling in Jacksonville to 21 deuref^ and
'to 30 degrees at Tampa, in the southwest
central portion of the state. Vegetables
as far south as Sanford were bfdly hurt,
but not entirely ruined. Oanges and
other semi-tropical fruits w*re not dam
aged to any considerable decree.
The fortunate feature of the freeze was
that it was of short duration. The lowest
temperature was reported in the State at 6
o'clock this morning, and by 9 o'clock the
weather had greatly moderated.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 28.â Not since the
blizzard of 1888 nss there been a storm of
such severity throughout New England as
that which hÂ»s prevailed during the past
twenty- four hours. All sections report
beayy snows, varying all the way from 15
to 34 inches on the level, while the bi<rh
â¢winds have in many places piled up drifts
6 to 10 feet in height.
Country roads are everywhere rendered
impa.ssable, while steam railroads, elec
tric railways, teiegray>h and telephone
service have been pretty thoroughly de
moralized. In many places schools have
been closed, portions of mills shut down
and business oi all kinds practically sus
pended.
The storm in this city developed very
nearly into a blizzard. The snow ftÂ»ll has
beenabout 24 inches, causing great inter
ruption to streetcar and steam railroad
traffic, besides practically placing an em
bargo upon ail ships hereabouts. With
the exception of two or three schooners
â which came in this morning the haibor
has b?en barren of arrivals. Ferry-boats
are mating their trips, but are greatly
hampered by the thick snow.
All sorts of rumors have been afloat in
rr-fÂ»Tci to vessels being ashore at Nahant,
Wintbrop, Galloupes Inland and other
.points below, isut diligent inquiry has
lia.ied to confirm any of them.
Roicfcville, Conn., reports a fall of 34
incues of snow and drifts from five to eight
feet deep.
BALTIMORE, Ma, Jan. 28.â 61eighing
is always a novelty in Baltimore and to
day thousands took advantage of the op
portunity to enjoy the unusual pleasure.
The most severe storm of the winter oc
curred yesterday and to-day. The snow
fall has been heavier than any sinoe 1888.
Ice has fastened itself upon the waters oi
the rivers and Chesapeake Bay and is giv
ing trouQle to shipping interests.
Vessels are Jocked in by the ice. A num
ber of oyster-boats have been temporarily
abandoned, their crews walking on the ice
to the shore.
A great deal of destitution in all parts
of Baltimore has been brought to light by
the cold snap and every police station is
beine overrun with men, women and chil
dren in search of food, clothing and fuel.
Many .cases of distress have thus been
discovered. Reports from Western Mary
land counties indicate the heaviest snow
storm and the lowest temperature of the
winter.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Jan. 28.âRe
ports from up and down tbe New Jersey
coast show that the prevailing snowstorm
is the heaviest in several years.
Besides the snowstorm the weatiier is s
thick with foe that ihe strongest marine
glass cannot penetraie it deeper than lCu
yards. An uncommonly heavy sea is run
ning at Atlantic Higulands, The surf is
ris.ng over the broa i walk at Asbbur\
Park and washing sand r.p in the ram
parts. The snow is so deep that all traffic
on wheels is stopped.
Trains running into Long Branch are al.
delayed, and wires are down from Barne
gat City to Atlantic City.
At Sea Isle City the Jseawalls of several
jcotiages have been destroyed by the
l*"oraj. Business is nearly suspended iji
City on account of the ftorm. Tup
biggest fall of snow and fog envelops Ege
Harbor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 28.â New York
awoke this morning to face ti.e heaviest
snowfall in this re-ion for years. It
started in wuh determination tne evening
before, and kept up a continual downfa.:
until the city was buned at 10 a. m. to-.ia.
beneath a robe of even tÂ«n inclie-. But
the snow wa> dry and the wind was not
"otrong enough to create any heavy drift*
and â¢other blizzard conditions. For this
reason it readily yielded to the feet and
reduced discomfort to the lowest notch.
TThe storm started on the Atlanlic
<x>ast near South Carolina. It struck a
ccld steady breeze rrom the north. This
made New York the storm center. While
snow was falling all over the middle At
lantic States, this region got the heaviest
dohe by far.
It played havoc with all kinds of traffic,
clogged surface tracks and congested thor
oughfares. Crowding and yelling truck
men, nervous aDd pushing pedestrians,
the loud grinding of snow plows ana the
determined work of the cartmen and
Bhovelers made up the regulation tableau
that always comes with a metropolitan
. stolrm.
Cable lines were troubled with slippery
cable-,, which made progress slow and
f halting on them, so that a large amount
â  l^f passenger traffic was diverted to ele
'Va ted .roads.
Suburban trains were behind their
schedules and trains on all lines were ari
hour or two late. The snowfall in thit
vicinity was the Heaviest since the his
toric blizzard ol 1888. That record-breaker
scored % iy z feet on a level, while the storm
oMo-day has 10J4 inches to its credit. The
btbrna practiculiy closed the port this fore
The San Francisco Call
noon and last night, no veswis venturing
in or out. .
During the evening, hcwerer. the ves
sels which had anchored mside the Hook
passed out. and a few of those due, which
had anchored off shore, came in. Reports
from every part of tbe State, and from
every New England hamlet or town where
the taleeraph reaches, show the same con
dition. Even in the guif and cotton States
of the far South a temperature of coldness
exists wnich ior Â» third of a century has
not been equaled.
COLUMBIA, S. C, Jan. 28.-Dispatcb.es
report the temperature at Pickens 2 de
crees below, Marion 4 below. These towns
are in the Piedmont section. At Green
ville it was 6 degrees above, Columbia 18
above. It ha.Â« grown colder to-night.
RAILROADS SEEK RELIEF.
They Wil Have to Change Their Ticket
System Unless Protected by
Congress.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 28.â Among local
rai'road oflici ils the prevailing sentiment
is strongly in favor of the proposed
amendment to the interstate commerce
act now pending in the Senate which is
designed to prevent ticket scalping, and
the railway companies are working in
legitimate channels to overcome the com
bined opposition to the bill. The railway
companies claim that the amendment
will stop the wholesale fraud practiced on
the companies and the public such as just
been shown by the arrest and indictment
of a gang of scalpers and retainers here
yesterday. This gang is believed to be the
one which was successful in putting out
several hundred counterfeit ticket; of sup
posed issue of prominent Western roads
iast August and SeDtember. Thesetickets
were honored by nearly every big road
runnme east and southeast from this city.
The use of this bogus paper represented a
loss of several thousand dollars to the
victimized linea, the money going into the
pockets of scalpers and retainers.
The position of the railway people is
that if they cannot be protected in some
such manner as contemplated by the
pending amendment in Congress that the
companies will eventually be forced to
discontinue most of their through ticket
ing arrangements now in effect. The
number of cases of successful counterteit
mg and sale of such tickets are increasing
iapidly, and owing to the fact that it can
be carried on for several months without
discovery it is impossible to bring thi
guilty party to justice.
A WASHINGTON AIRSHIP.
Professor Langley of the Smithsonian
Institution Has Invented a Flier
and Made Two Trips.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 38.â A Sun
-pecial from Washington says: The re
port of Professor Langley, secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, just submitte
to the Board of Re ents, contains the fol-
Jovrine about his flying-machine:
"The writer has, during the intervals o'
his official duties, continued to experi
ment in this manner until he has reached
a measure of success which seems to jus
tify him in making the statement here
that mechanical flights have now been at
tained. On May 26 last a mechanism
built chiefly of steel and driven by n
steam-engine made two flights of over
half a mile. Since that time the result
has been nearly doubled, in each caÂ«r
there was no support from gaÂ°. The ma
chine was a thousand or more time
heavier than the air in which it was mad>
to move. Dr. Alexander Graham Bel
witnessed the first of tliese, and communi
cated the statements of results to tin
Academy of France.
"I do not know how far interest in thr
work may bias my judgment, but it ap
pears to me that in these things, the tina.
accomplishment of which has come un
der the charge of the Smithsonian Insti
tution, it has made a contribution to tht
â itilitiesof the world which will be memor
able."
RASH IN NAME AND DEED.
In a Fit of Insanity a Nebraska Farmei
Murders His Wife and Three Chi.-
dren With an Ax,
WAYNE, Nebr., Jan. 28.â A most shock
ing murder was discovered this morning
uu a farm ten miles southeast of this city.
C. K. Rasb, in a fit oi madness, brained
ins wife and three children with an ax
vnd then hacfred the bodies to pieces.
The deed was discovered by a boy who
hud been sent from a neighbor's house to
engage Rash to help shell corn. Ai
proachinz the bouse he was startled by
cries, and. supposing there was a struggle
Â£oing on inside, burst in the door.
A terrible spectacle presented itself.
The furniture of the room was in bad dis
order and the walls and ceiling spattered
with blood. On the bed was the body o;
Mrs. Rash, her head so badly battered tha.
it was scarcely recognizable. In an ad
joining room lay the bodies of the chil
dren. Wherever he went were evidence^
of a struggle and deatj. Upstairs In â 
loft lay the husband of the family. Hi
vacant stare and wandering talk showed
clearly that Teason had left him. The
Sheriff was imrae.iiately. sent for and tin
maniac placed behind the bars.
The cause of his action is still a mys
tery. The family was in moderate cir
cumstances and esteemed highly.
HALPIN MAVIh UVH.s B IMS BVt.
Hound for San 1 mneinco He 'lriet tt
Cut Bis Throat.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 28.â An insane
man, who attempted to cut his throat
with a razor in a rear coach of a west
bound passenger train on the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad shortly after ii
had Mt the depot, caused much excite
ment among thirty or more passengers at
10:45 o'clock last night, and resulted in a
delay of the train at Oakley avenue until
the i olice could arrive and take charge of
the frenzied man.
Had it not been for the prompt action
<>f the trainmen the man would have suc
ceeded in ending bis life in the presence
ii the excited passengers. As it was, he
drew the blade of the razor across his
throat, but inflicted only a slight wound.
The man fought fiercely with the train
men, and it was only after several passen
gers had offered assistance that he was
overpowered and hela until the arrival of
i he police. On the way to the County
Hospital the crazy man fought and at
tempted to jump from the pairol-wagon.
When the hospital was reached he be
came more quiet, and said his name was
Halpin Hay.l and that he was on his way
from France to San Francisco. He had a
ticket tor San Francisco in his pocket,
which bore the name be gave to the
police.
SAN FRANCIÂ«CO, FRIDAY MORNING, JANUARY 29, 1897.
COLONEL ROBERT GREEN INGERSOLL.
\From his latest photograph.]
Colonel Ingersoll. who is now in hs sixty-fourth year, recently decided to retire from the active practice of law. He
purposes devoting much of his time to lecturing, for which he has always had a great fondness. His new lecture, which he
delivered in Boston last Sunday night, he calls "How to Reform Mankind."
GAGE ACCEPTS
THE PORTFOLIO
Will Become Secretary of
ihe Treasury in the New
Administration.
D?mand for His Appointment
Came From Men of All
Parties and Rank.
Vith Perhaps One Exception, Major
M Kinley Has Now Selected All
tbe Cabinet Mcmb rs
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 28.â Lyman J.
Gace will be the next Secretary of the
Treasury. He arrived at Major McKin
â¢ey's house a few minutes before 3 o'clock
(bis afternoon and was warmly welcomed
by the President-elect, who straightway
withdrew with him for a private con-
rence, which lasted until 6 o'clock. The
President-elect and his Secretary of the
Treasury had a private talk, in wb^ch they
â¢ li -cursed at length the financial and tariff
pohcy and considered problems that would
call for immediate soiution by means of
legislation. Major McKinley and Mr.
Gage are thoroughly in accord on all
political, financial and economic questions.
The demand for Mr. Gage's appoint
ment comes from nearly every commer
cial center in the country and from mem
bers of both parties. He is indorsed not
only by the business world, but by many
labor organizations as well. The direct
statement is made in nearly all the letters
and telegrams which have reached Major
McKinley respecting Mr. Gage, that the
direct effect of his appointment will be to
hasten and render certain the restoration
.jf confidence. Mujor McKinley has been
thinking about Mr. Gage for several weeks
in connection with the treasury portfolio,
but has been waiting to learn if he could
accept it. It has also been Major McKin
ley's intention, lrom the day be was
plected, to choose a Western man for Sec
retary of the Treasury, if he could find an
available man.
Mr. Gage meets all of the requirements,
hut his appointment does not remove
rom the list as a Cabinet possibility the
name of Charles Emory hmith, who
would in all probability have been made
Secretary of State if the office had been
tilled by the appointment of an Eastern
man. It may be safely assumed that
Major McKinley has decided at present
upon six men for his Cabinet, though he
has not formally tendered all of them
portfolios.
The men who are regarded as certain of
appointment are: John Sherman, Ly
man J. Gage, Nathan Goff, Joseph .vie-
Kenna of California, John D. Long and
James Wilson of Ohio for Secretary of
Agriculture. General R. A. Alger's ap
pointment as Secretary of War is prob
able, but by no means certain. The re
maining portfolio, which is not likely to
be tendered by the middle or last of
February, will doubtless go to a New
Yorker or a Pennsylvanian.
Mr. Gage said this evening and author
ized the United Associated Presses to
say: "I nave been tendered the appoint
ment of Secretary of Treasury by Major
McKinley and have accepted it."
South Dakota' t /struggle.
PIERRE, S. D., Jan. 28.â The fusion
caucus to-night was one of the warmest
held since the assembly convened. It was
in the nature of an experience meeting,
each member standing up and giving the
reason for the faith that was in him and
why he supported his man. For some
days it has been whispered aiound that
H. H. Potter of Aberdeen was to he the
dark horse. He has been on the ground
several days, but his boom has failed to
materialize. The last vote to-day showed
.no material change. It is: Kyle 3o, Piow

PLUNGED FROM THE TRACK.
Catastrophe on a Brooklyn Elevated
Roadâ Two Will Die and Many
Were Injured.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Jan. 28. â Ice,
snow and an open switch were the cause
of one engine and a car on the elevated
road leaving the structure at Fourth street
to-night, falling to the ground, a distance
of twenty-five feet. Stveral persons were
injure!, two, it is said, faialiy.
The injured are:
Thomas Gaffney, engineer, skull frac
tured and other injuries to the body.
George Thomas, fireman, scalded by es
caping steam.
Albert Brown, engineer, several scalp
wounds.
Thomas Heath, fireman, left leg am
putated.
The passengers hurt are:
Henry Sebres, leg sprained.
Julius Hanbury, spine fractured.
Andrew Gorans, contusions of hips and
legs.
Henry Hinke, wounds in tbe scalp.
Heath and Gaffney will die.
Four cars made up the train, but only a
few passengers were in them. At the
junction of Broadway and Fourth street,
as Gaffney was about to alow up, engine 6,
drawing a train of empty cars in charge of
Albert Brown, loomed up, and striking an
open switch headed directly in Gaffney's
course.
Both engines came together with a
crash that could be heard blocks away,
and a second later engine 74 toppled over,
leaving tbe rails and dragging the first
car^viih it to the street. The breaking of
the coupling on tlie second car prevented
the other three coaches from leaving the
rails.
Only four passengers were in the first
car. These were taken from the wreck
and soon several doctors were at work on
th>m.
Heath, who bad his leg crushed and was
unconscious when taken from the cab of
Ins engine, will die.
Gaffney and Thomas were foud wedged
against the side of the boiler in their cab.
A.U of ihe injured were taken to the hos
pitals. Tne only two that will die, ac
cording to the doctors, are Gaffney and
Heath.

Liberal Inducements That the
Governor and Legislators
W.ll Accept.
Important Use to Ec Made of the
State Prcperty Formerly Occupied
by the Feeble- Minded.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 28.â The State
property formerly occupied by the Home
lor the Feeble-minded in Santa Clara,
which is proposed to be converted into a
State reformatory for girls, was visited by
Governor Buctd and a committee from the
State Legislature and a delegation of per
sons interested- in reform work this morn
ing;.
Governor Budd was accompanied by the
following: Senator S. N. Androus of Los
Angeles, H. V. Morehouse and F. C.
Franek of Santa Clara County, Assembly
man H. E. Wright of Alameda County,
chairman of the Committee on Grounds
and Buildings, and N. E. Malcolm and J.
J. McLaurin of this county. J. F. Carrere
of the Los Angeles Express officiated as
secretary. Dr. A. E. Osborn, medical
director of the Home for Feeble-minded
at Glen Ellen, accompanied by his wife,
was of the party. Ex-Senator E. M. Pres
ton and Fayette Mace of the board of
trustees, and E. Carl Bank, superintend
ent of the Preston School of Industry at
lone, also accompanied the delegation.
The visitors were met at Santa Ciara
upon tneir arrival by a large number of
prominent men from Santa Clara and this
city and escorted to the property in
carriages.
The mem bers of the delegation expressed
great surprise nt the attractiveness of the
location, its conveniences and the capacity
of the buildings. A tour of inspection was
then made. Each rbom in the three de
partments of the building was visited and
tbe size of the rooms, lighting, ventila
tion and convenience were commented
upon. Governor Budd acted as leader
and questioner.
"Why I had no idea the State bad such
an excellent piece of property here," was
his first remark upon entering the
grounds, and from this moment he
showed favor to the proposition to use the
property for a giris' reformatory in every
remark be made. The water plant, light
ing plant, several gardens and orchards
received close inspection.
When the party returned to the portico
in front of the main building J. B.
O'Brien, as president of the Board of
Trustees of the town of Santa Clara, made
the following statement:
"Tbe town of Santa Clara ia anxious to
have this property used for a State re
formatory for girls, and to secure that end
we are willing to offer ouch inducements
as are within our power. Santa Clara
owns its own water plant, and the Trus
tees have expressed their willingness to
furnish the institution free of cost with
fifty gallons of water per capita a day.
Santa Clara also owns its electric lighting
plant, and we are willing to supply what
arc electric lighting will be deemed neces
sary for properly illuminating the
grounds. Further than tbis, we are will
ing to extend the town sewer to the front
of the building, in order that the property
may have every sewerage facility."
This proposition was received with
much favor by the delegation and ap
plause by representatives from Santa Clara
and San Jose.
In conversation with a Call representa
tive Governor Budd said: "I have been
opposed to the establishment of
new public institutions requiring in
creased expenditures for mainten
ance, but I must say I am heartily in
favor of tbe project to bring the girls from
the Whittier Reform School and establish
a girls' reformatory at this place. I am
agreeably surprised to find this such a
pretty place. It presents a better appear
ance and woul'l be more comfortable for
the girls than Whittier. The proposition
of the Santa Clara Board of Trustees re
moves all question as to the proposed
chance involving additional expense to
the State. I can easily see how it will save
the State several thousands of dollars an
nually. Besides tbis it would separate the
boy 3 from the girls and this has become a
necessity. I recommended the same in
my message to the Legislature and have
worked to accomplish it. My only objec
tion to the establishment of a reformatory
at this place was that I did not want any
new institutions vhich would require a
new set of trustees.
"Tbe removal of the girls to this place
would only involve the expense of about
$5000 for needed repairs. This money can
be taken in per capita proportion from the
$40,000 now fn the Whittier School fund,
which would still leave considerable
money to the credit of this institution to
be expended in the best manner for the
education of tbe girls in the schools.
"I have examined the property care
fully. Its sewerage with the proposed
connection with the town sewer would be
excellent The buildings are in good con
dition and so constructed as to be admir-
able for dividing tbe girls into necessary
classes. The grounds are abundant and
suitable for both work and play. The
gardens and orchards could be made a
source of profit and also give desirable
occupation to the inmates of the institu
tion. The convenience of the buildings to
the Agnews Asylum will enable the plac
ing of the institution under the control of
the trustees of that institution. This will
prevent the appointment of a new board
of control. The medical director, engineer
and omer employes of one institution
could be used when necessary for the
other.
"Another thing of importance is that
the proposed change will relieve the
Whittier School and make an appropria
tion for new buildings unnecessary. The
trustees of Whittier have asked ior $80,000
for this purpose. lam heartily in favor
of the project, and I am satisfied a bill
making the change will receive no opposi
tion in the Legi-lature. It certainly will
not when it cornea to me for my signa
ture."
Senator Androus of Los Angeles ex
pressed himself as being heartily in favor
of using the building as a reformatory for
girls, and stated that the plan proposed
Â»,as, in his estimation, for the best inter
ests of the State.
Senator Morehouse took great pains in
having every adaptability ot the buildings
and grounds shown to each member of
the delegation, and stated that he would
introduce a bill embodying the idea upon
his return to Sacramento.
Dr. Osborn, ex-Senator Preston and
others expressed their hearty approval of
the propose 1 ! change. After the inspec
tion the visiting party was dined by David
Henderson at his home in Santa Clara
and at the conclusion of the dinner a pub
lic reception was held.
The Governor and Legislative party also
visited the State Normal School and in
spected all of its departments. Senator
Morehouse showed the party the grounds
and explained what he desired in the bill
he had offered, granting to the city of San
Jose a suitable Bite on the State property
for a high school.
Governor Budd, regarding the proposed
grant, said: "lam in favor of giving the
city as much of the grounds as is desired
for such a purpose, and I am in favor of
empowering the trustees of the Normal
School and the Board of Education of San
Jose to select the site and agree upon the
amount of ground to be set aside for that
purpose, provided, however, the city will
agree to keep the ground allotted to it in
good order. The grounds now I consider
too large for exclusively normal school
purposes, as they are too expensive to keep
in attractive condition."
The Senators and Assemblymen ex
pressed themselves in favor of granting
the proposed site to the city, and stated
that little opposition to Senator More
house's bill was contemplated.
Senator Androus and Secretary Carrere
visited Agnews Insane Asylum for a short
time before going to the Normal School.
Senator Androus stated that he would
favor a larger appropriation for tbat insti
tut on, as he thought electric lights should
be used exclusively for illumination.
Governor Budd also favored an increased
appropriation for this purpose, and stated :
"i am always willing to sign bills for im
provements at Agnews Asylum, for'l con
sider it one of the best and most econom
ically managed public institutions in the
State."
Governor Budd, Senators Morehouseand
Androus. with the secretary of the com
mittee, left on the 8 o'clock train for
Tracy, where they will join a legislative
party en route for Southern California,
where the State institutions will be in
spected.

Little Prrgress Made in the So-Cared
Investigation of Cbiet Duck
worth's Acts-
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28.â Ed J.
Smith of San Francisco kept tbe Duck
worth committee on investigation on the
langh for fifteen or twenty minutes this
afternoon. He bad been called as an ex
pert to tell all be knew about the practice
and precedents of past sessions of the
Legislature in temporary organizations.
Mr. Smith proved to be an expert to the
manner born. The air of candor with
which he discussed practical politics and
his surprising frankness took away tbe
breath of the members of the committee
and all that they could do was to sit back
in their chairs and roar with laughter.
He was a page in the long ago when tbe
Legislature held its sessions in what is
now the County Courthouse on I street, a
rusty looking building with a magnificent
portico modeled after that of t:.e beauti
ful Temple of Venus in Athens. There he
received his first lessons in practical poli
tics, and counting the Constitutional con
ventions as a session of tbe Legislature he
has attended eighteen sessions as boy and
man and he is yet poor. When he was
asked as to the number of attaches in
addition to the statutory officers that were
employed in past sessions he replied that
in tbe session of 1881 live extra attaches
were employed. In 1887 about fifteen.
"Then," continued Smith, "they con
tinued to increase from year to year up to
the present time. At the last session
there were twenty-nine, and I was one of
the temporary fellows. The Legislature
in tbe session before last was Democratic,
and the Democrats created the position ol
history clerk for me. When I came back
two years ago to help organize the Legis
-1 ature I was not on the temporary roll,
George Peckham was clerk and I said :
" 'Look here, George, I have been work
ing here right along, and I ought to be
put on tbe roll,' and he put me on the
third day after."
Smith told bow he had worked in San
Francisco figuring on the mileage of
members before he came up here,. For
instance, he figured Assemblyman Me
lick's mileage from Lancaster to Los An
geles and from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco. He had got the distances and
stage and railroad routes from a railway
guide, and this guide did not appear to
show that Lancaster was on the Mojave
Desert between Los Angeles and Sao
Francisco.
While the members were heartily
laughing over this liberal method of com
puting mileage. Smith, wholly uncon
scious of having made any funny revela
tions, pointed his finger at Chynoweth's
black whiskers and said:
"Just as I did for you, Mr. Chynoweth."
This sally provoked such a shout of
laughter that Chynoweth's blushes con
cealed his whiskers. He recovered from
his confusion in time to ask whether
bmith had treated him with the same
liberality as he had treated Melick, and
Smith replied that he had allowed him
only bis proper mileage, as be had tried
to do with all the other members.
Chairman Waymire asked Smith how
many employes he thought necessary to
organize the Assembly, and the witness
blurted out with breezy frankness:
"Well, politically speaking, I would
put on as many as I could."
It required five minutes for the com
mittee to recover from its tit of laughing.
It was plain that Diogenes need no longer
roam the desert with his lantern search
ing for the honest man; he could come to
the Assembly chamber.
Smith, then speaking not politically
but practically, explained that the Assem
bly could be nicely and comfortably or
ganized with the following officers: A
chief clerk, two assistant clerks and one
minute clerk, five pages, a sergeant-at
arras and three assistants for the gates, a
postmistress, a rear porter and a mail
carrier.
"Didn't you leave out the history clerk?"
asked Brusie facetiously.
"Oh, we don't want a history clerk on
temporary organization," replied Smith.
"The temporary roll increases every year.
I don't blame them. When the Demo
crats had no place ior me they created the
office of temporary clerk."
"Are you a Democrat or a Republican?"
inquired Chynoweth.
"I am a Republican, sir," responded the
witness with dignity, straightening him
self up.
Belshaw was the next funny witness.
Belsbaw's name appeared on Duckworth's
temporary roll as sponsor for a page named
A. A. Smith, and when the roll was read
out loud in meeting BelshÂ»w, apparently
very much perturbed in spirit, produced
the affidavit of the page Smith to prove
that Smith was appointed or placed on
the temporary roll on January 5, tbe day
after the House was organized. The state
ment of tbe gentleman from Antioch was
received with smiles, winks and nudges
by all the newspaper men and by most of
the committee. It was rather tangled,
and runs as the crow flies as follows:
"Oneof the pages told me that his name
was A- A. Smith ; that be bad served as a
page at the previous session, and that he
wished I would give him a re com mend a*
tion so that be could draw his salary. I
thereupon wrote down on a sheet of paper,
as near as lean recollect, the following:
'I hereby recommend A. A. Smith to be
appointed temporary page,' and signed
my name and sent it up to tbe desk.
Duckworth held the note up over his desK
and said, 'Did you write that ?' and I re
plied that I certainly aid, and Duck
worth put it down. I began to s udy over
the matter and it came to my mind that I2
had given a recommendation to this page
after the power of the clerk to appoint had
ceased.
"I found afterward that the name of A. A.
Fmith appears on the journal of Monday,
January 4. It appears to me that the chief
clerk has tried to shield his numerous ap
pointments behind somebody else."
Judge Waymire poked his stick between
the barn of the cage. "I understood you
tc say a while ago," he asked, "that you
did give a recommendation for the ap
pointment of this page?'
Mr. Belshaw attempted to explain by
saying that the recommendation was
'given after he was already on the tem
porary roll as it appeared on the journal.
The stick went between the bars again.
"If his name was on the roll," persisted
the chairman, "why should he need a
recommendation ?''
"I don't know," replied Mr. Belshaw.
In reply to Chynoweth the witness de
clared that fifteen or twenty employes
would be a very liberal number for tem
porary organization.
Brusie asked the witness wnether he
would not provide for more employes
than the Jaw allowed, and the witness re
plied that the law allowed but three, but
that he would provide for more.
Leon E. Jones of San Francisco seemed
to be the most influential Assemblyman
on the floor. The attaches appointed on
his reci mmendation were A. S. Vischer,
Devine, Friedlander, Voorsanger and
Blakeston. He said that he had asked
Clerk Duckworth to place Mr. Vischer's
name on the roll. After that the others
came to him and he tola them they were
at liberty to use his name and influence to
get on the roll if they could. He c u:d
not say whether or not Devine was pres
ent during the temporary organization,
but he knew that Friedlander and Vischer
were. He did not know whether Vischer
did any work or not. He did not know
Blakeston and Voorsanger. Duckworth
was an entire stranger to Assemblyman
Jones, and in fact Jones went to Sacra
mento with another candidate for chief
clerk. It was after the Republican cau
cus had selected Duckworth as chief clerK
thatJoneÃ had asked him to appoint Mr.
Viscuer.
Assemblyman Shanahan, a whiskerless
Populist from the manzanita groves and
grizzly-bear pastures of Shasta, went be
fore the committee and swore that there
were no such thing as a temporary organi
tation. He thought that these officers
were sufficient to do the temporary busi
ness.
Clerk Gndley corrected his testimony of
the day before. He said: "I was asked
by whose direction I put those two names
on the Blip. My reply was: 'By the direc
tion of the Speaker.' I understand that
some one in the House asked to have
those names inserted and the Speaker re
quested me to do so. The names were M.
A. Kearney and Miss M. Bertola." The
correction was made in the same manner
as all otter corrections are made by the
Speaker.
Dr. Keables, in seconding the motion to
receive the temporary roll in evidence
said that they wanted to know all about
tLis affair and that the temporary roll
should be made public and all the facts
connected therewith. He wanted nothing
concealed, but wanted the whole truth, no
matter upon whose shoulders the blame
might rest. Mr. Duckworth would be
given every opportunity of making a free
and fair explanation.
"This is not a Duckworth investiga
tion," added Dr. Keables. "The reputa
tion of every member of the Assembly is
involved in this."
Emmons followed and declared that the
committee was not bound by any consid
erations of privileged or secret communi
cations. "Those are the very things that
will show us where the blame lies. Il is
what is hidden that we want to reach. I
don't understand that Mr. Duckworth is
on trial here, but if he wants to throw any
light on this affair he will be afforded
every opportunity of doing so.
"After adjournment last evening," con
tinued Emmcns, "I received informa
tion that a certain gentleman said that he
was charged up with two appointments on
that roll, and another member said,
'Good for him; if necessary I will be
charged up with two to help him ouL' I
feared that he might find some com
placent members who will allow their
names to be placed on that roll for the
purpose of helping Mr. Duckworth."
He thereupon iaoved that the roll be
read and made public, and the motion
unanimously prevailed. The roll was read
us follows:
Statutory officersâ S. J. Duckworth, R.
Q. Wickham, Andrew Branch, A. L. FlÃh

Chlff Clerk Duckworth ltsuts a State-
ment While Sick in Bed.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28.â Mr.
Duckworth to-night issued the following
card:
. "To the people of California: Daring
the early days of this session a committee
consisting of Assemblymen Anderson,
Cutter and Fontana requested me to fur
nish a list of the members who had asked
for appointments on the tem
porary roll of the Assembly. 1 complied
as far as I was able to, checking up the
names on the list with as many members
as I could reach at that time.
"In handing the li-t to Messrs. Fontana
and Cutter 1 said to them that some
names were erroneously charged because
some of the memoianda bearing on these
names had been misaui, but I could at
any time thereafter make the necessary
corrections so lhat the list would De abso
lutely accurate. They assured me this
was satisfactory, and that as long as it
was substantially correct it would answer
the purpose. My last words to them were:
'Remember, gentlemen, that I do not
claim that this list is correct, for I have
not had time to check it up, although the
major portion of it is all right. With a
few changes, however, it will be correct,
and if it is ever to go beyond the Republi
can caucus I will a>k to have it returned
to me for revision.'
"They assured me that my wishes would
be respected, and that the Republican
caucus would consider it a privileged
communication and preserve secrecy con
cernfng ii. On yesterday iho investi
gating commiitee voted in accordance
with the promise of the Republican com
mittee. To-day it changed its mind and
gave this list to the world, thus doing me
and other innocent parties in jiny almost
irreparable. If ihis uction hart been taken
under any other circumstances I would
not say a word, out this violation of the
promue made by the Republican caucus
officials comes when I am contineu to a
Kick bed ana absolutely prohibited by my
physicians from giving any thought what
ever to my own interests in this matter. I
tuerefore request a suspension ot judg
ment pending my restoration to health.
"Every name on that temporary roll is
bona hue. Every one has been vouched
for by eminently respectable people, and I
have no desire to evade a fair and search
ing investigation as to my connecton
with the organization of the Assembly.
But in all fairness 1 ask that these matters
should, in so far as they concern innocent
parties and myself, be peimitted to rest
until I can at least stand on my feet and
meet the charges face to face.

SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 23.â There
was barely a quorum presont when the
Eenate was called to ordc- this morning,
many members being away on junketing
trips, and this afternoon many others left
for the south to visit San Diego, Highland
and other points.
The second reading file was gone over
rapidly and nothing of importance came
up, as the question of no quorum would
have been raised. A few oiiis were intro
duced and other measures passed their j
second reading. The only business at the i
afternoon session bosides the reading ot a j
number of bills a second time was the
reading of the report of the Committee on
Hospitals, recommending that Senate bill
117, providing means for transporting pa
tients to asylums, do not pass. Ad
journed.
In the Assembly this morning the Com- ;
mittee on Election Laws reported ad- j
versely the bill for using photography in
voting. Dibble moved that all bills re
ported from committees be read the first
time and placed on the second-reading
ti!e. So ordered.
The attempt to increase the number of
attache* by adding another bill clerk was
defeated.
The Cuban resolutions, parsed yester
day, were witharawn from the Senate in
order to give Dryden a chance to speak
upon them to-morrow.
Many bills were reported by committees,
including the Stanford University tax
exemption bill.
Waymire introduced a woman's suffrage
amendment to the constitution.
The bill to combine Washington's birth
day and Arbor day was withdrawn.
Speaker Coombs called attention to the
testimony given before the Duckworth
mv stigating commit. Â«c by Journal Clerk
Gridley that he added two names to the
temporary roll on the Ctti of January by
order of the Speaker. Coombs said he
had no such recollection and asked the
members and clerks to state what they
remembered. He did not propose to stand
charged with a responsibility that did not
belong to him.
Several Assemblymen said they had
been paying close attention to the pro
ceedings of January 6 and had not beard
the Speaker order any names added to the
temporary roll.
Journal Clerk Gridley was asked about
tbe insertion of the names. He stuck to
his story, but had no explanation to offer.
The matt r was dropped temporarily.
Drycien introduced a resolution request
ing Congress to cause the Government to
bid in, own and operate the Pacific rail
roads when the mortgages were fore
closed.
Leavitt asked for three days' longer leave

BUDD JS VERX AXXIOUS.
May find Some Jingo in ihÂ» State
Printer's Office.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28.â The
State Printer was called to task recently
by Senator Witbineton in the Senate be
cause be did not exercise a privilege
granted by a law passed two years ago
empowering the State Printer to revise or
exclude voluminous reports ordered print
ed by various commissions. To-night
State Printer Johnson said that he was
advised lone ago by, the Attorney-General
that all such printing orders had to co to
the Board of Examiners for revision. The
law was passed to protect'the office, from
bulky and redundant reports, and has af
forded him no protection. Many times
throughout the year copy accumulates.
The Governor is often absent: the Attor
ney-General is frequently in San Fran
cisco, and the printers, shouting for copy,
cannot get it. The expense of the office
is increased somewhat thereby. The bill
allowing the State Printer $75,000 to main
tain his office until July 1 next is in the
hands of the Governor.
Budd is said to be anxious "to do" some
Democratic politics with this measure.
lie has directed the State Printer to fur
nish the most minute data. Mr. Johnson
says that at least thirty days should be
given any department to supply the data
which the Governor now demands. The
data which the Governor calls for will be
furnished, and - it will show on whose
order the money appropriated lias been
â¢xpended. Republicans who are well
versed in the matter are willing that the
Governor should jump in now. li any
department of .the State government is
being run for the benefit of politicians it
is well that the public should know it,
and know what particular department is
in deepest. The fight on the State Printer
and . the efforts of the Governor to run
that office may develop some interesting
facts in other quarters. :. {
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 1897.
IMPROVEMENTS OF
PUBLIC HIGHWAYS
Mono County Pleads for a
Road Across the
Sierras.
Residents Up There Tired ol
Going Halt Way to New York
to Reach This City.
Attorney Preston Causes an Injustice
to the Valley Roai to Be
Remedied.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28.âInfor
mally the Committee on Roads and High
ways listened to a plea from Mono County
this evening requesiing that a public
highway be constructed for a distance of
twelve miles across the pine-clad penks of
the fcierras in order to connect the Tioga
and Mono wagon roaas, so tuat the in
habitants be in touch with those of the
rest of the State.
Marsdon Manson of the Bureau of High
ways appeared by request and described
tbe route needed, and Assemblyman
Caples of Mono also addressed the com
mittee, ending by saying: "Gentlemen,
all the people of Mono ask of ti is Legisla
ture is this road, which will enable us to
cross the Sierras without going halfway
to New York in order to reach the South
ern Pacific Railroad to come to Sacra
mento or San Franctsco. The cost of con
struction is computed to be about $2000 a
mile."
The matter was passed without any de
cision being arrived at, but it is probable
that Mono will receive its appropriation.
The Lake Tahoe and Placerville wagon
mad bill asking for an appropriation of
$25,000 in order to repair the road and
provide a salary of $.50 per month for an
overseer, who shall be empowered to make
repairs, etc., then cropped up. This is in
furtherance of the pet idea of Governor
Kud'l, which is to make it the beau ideal
road of the State.
Assemblyman Burnham advocated the
inserests of this bil', and it was finally re
ferred to the sub-joint committee of the
Senate and Assembly.
At the last session of the Legislature a
bill was introduced and passed providing
that the road become State property, and
in favoring the proposition it was plainly
stated that it would require but a nominal
sum to place it and keep it in repair, and
several of the members of the committee
expressed the opinion that $25,000 was by
no means a nominal sum.
Assembly bill 438, which endeavors to
prevent the granting of franchises or privi
leges for the construction, extension or
operation of railroads over or upon county
roads or highways by the Boards of
Supervisors of the several counties of the
State, developed a bug of gigantic dimen
sions and encountered a very decided
opposition from those against whose in
terests it was seeming'y framed. Nomi
nally thÂ» bill was introduced In order to
protect the highways of the State from the
encroachments of electric roads, but as
was plainly portrayed by Attorney Pres
ton of the San Joaquln Valley road, if this
proposed act was carried, it meant a
death blow to the extension of that road.
"There are many unincorporated
towns," said the speaker, "which can
only be entered by some public highway,
and if we are debarred by this proposed
act our work must cease. For instance,
take the towns of Ridley and Visalia; the
only approach is on the public road. And
another thingâ should this act pass it
would be repealing by implication the
present codes and would provoke in the
future strong litigation.
"Gentlemen of the committee," contin
ued the speaker, "the introduction of
steam railroads in any locality means
added prosperity and advancement. For
years this State ha 3 been restricted in its
growth by lack of opposition in trans
portation facilities, and the road which I
represent is tbe only one which has been
started in order to release the people from
the iron bands of the Southern Pacific,
and it has already made a cut in freight
rates of 17 per cent and they didn't liti
gate either. Ever since Its inception we
have had to meet and overcome obstacle
after obstacle.
"We have always endeavored not to im
pose in any way upon the people, and I
am borne out in this statement by the fact
that we have constructed 125 miles of road
with but four condemnation suits, in ecch
of which the contestants were awarded no
greater sums than we would have paid
them. At the present time we are blocked
at Fresno by a man named Burns who
has refused to allow us to pass through his
property, and in company with his wife
Has gone in biding in order to escape tbe
serving of papers.
"All we ask, gentlemen, is that you so
amend this act as to not throw added
difficulties in the path of a road which is
being built, not from the prosperity of its
stockholders, but through their misery.
We do not want to use the highways any
more than is absolutely necessary, as they
are conducive of damage suits, but we do
not want to be debarred from using them
when it is necessary."
Then arose a hot discussion on the sub
ject, and Assemblyman Mellick of Los
Angeles stated that he w as opposed to the
entire act, as in futurity he saw a connec
tion between the San Joaquin Valley road
an the Santa Fe which would excite an
opposition in ratea proving beneficia 1
to all.
After considerable discussion Caminetti,
at Preston's suggestion, introduced an
amendment, so that the bill reads as fol
lows:
.-ection 1. It shall be unlawful for tbe Board
of Supervisors of any county to authorize or
pass any ordinance, order or resolution grant
ing to any person or persons or association of
persons or corporation whatsoever any privi
lege or franchise for the construction, exten
sion or operation of any railroad over or upon
any or part of any county road or highway In
any county in the State of California; provided,
where public highways are absolutely re*
quired, the person or persons or association
of persons or corporation applying for such
franchise, If the same be granted, must, under
conditions prescribed by the Board of Super
visor?, provide a highway suitable and safe,
distance equal in kind with that part soap,
propriated. The provisions of this act shall
not apply to crossings over highways nor to
highways in mountain or other passes, nor to
approaches to cities and towns for a distance
of one mile therefrom.
The amendment was adopted and the
committee decided to report favorably on
the bill as amended.

STATE VttGAMZAtIO>S WAR.
Contests in the. Woman Svffragi*lÂ» Con-
rCr.TV vention and . Officers Elected.
DES MOINES," lowa. Jan. 28.â The fore
noon session of the suffrage convention
was devoted to a discussion of a plan of
work reported by the committee on that
subject. The report proposed that the
committee be . enlarged by adding to It
women neeafbers of important standing
committees. It was objected to and re
sulted in a long discussion. It was
avowed that the business committee was
in the hands of Eastern members. o'ithe
other hand it was urged by Mrs. Anthony
ana others that, with the present small
membership it was impossible to get a
quorum. It was not adopted.
Upon the proposition that a State or
ganization have charge of their own suf
frage campaign, instead of allowing the
National organization to conduct the State
campaign, Miss Anthony said she re
gretted the feeling that the National orti
<sers wore assuming too much authority.
She said the National association had to
furnish money for ate campaigns and
should have the management. The Statd
organization won again. -
Several reports were received and read
from standing committees.
In the afternoon the training school for
organizers and workers was held.
The evening was devoted to a public pro
gramme. The following addresses were
made before a large audience:

AFTER A 28.il Lb I MARS' CHASE.
A Deserted Wife Â»ndÂ« and I'rotecutea
If v 'band and Paramour.
PALATKA, Fla., Jan. 28.â A hand
eomeand well-educated Frenchman named
Hugo Benedix and a pretty brunette
named Madeiino Elder of Indianapolis,
Ind.. were two of the principals in a sen
sational affair in Justice Coxe's court yes
terday. The other actor was Mrs. Hugo
Benedix, and she confronted the two after
a chase of three yean.
It appears that Benedix was engaged as
a stockbroker in New York City three
years ago, and Madeline Elder was em
ployed as his typewriter. The two eloped,
going to Indianapolis, where they re
mained until three mouths ago unmolest
ed, although it appears that all this time
tne deserted wife was searching for them.
After leaving Indianapolis the pair came
to PaJatka, posing as man and vife. They
spent money freely, and finally bought a
handsome Â« ome on the St. Johns .River,
which they callid Oak Villa. Everything
went well until yesterday, when Mrs.
Benedix appeared. She went before Jim
tice Coxe, told her story and demanded
the arrest of her husband and Miss Elder.
Warrants wer issued and Benedix aul
.Mis-! Elder were arrested Thursday night.
Yesterday they were confrontea by the
wife before Judge Coxe. Mrs. Benedix
immediately made an attack on Miss El
der and would have injured her severely
if the Sheriff had not interfered. Mrs.
Benedix between sobsaeain told her story,
and Judge Coxe h<-ld Benedix and Aiiss
Elder under bonds of $300 each. Benedix
pave cash bail, and he and Miss Elder
were released, returning to Oafc Villa.
Mrs. Benedix is still here, and says stie
will prosecute the elopers to the bitter end.
A HICICLE JOK SOL.UIEBS.
A Patent Support Stakes the Wheel Suit-
able tor Army XJ*e.
WEST POINT, N. V., Jan. 28.â J. A.
George of Williamstown, Mass., has in
vented a bicycle support which promises
to increase the use of the wheel for mili
tary purposes. The arrangement of the
devise is extremely simple. A brake-like
appliance joined to the handle-bar when
pressed drops two light steel supports to
the ground. Upon these supports the
bicycle rests, and the rider, after coming
to a standstill and without dismounting,
ran use both hands for any purpose.
Touching a small spring on the handle
bar sends the supports back into place
again. The whole affair weighs less than
one pound.
For years military men have been look
ing for a bicycle support that would en
able riders to remain awheel while load
in c ana firing. The one great obstacle to
thi9 use of the bicycle in the army has
been its inability to stand alone. The
new invention enables the soidier to halt
without dismounting and to execute the
most intricate movements which hereto
fore were impossible.
General Miles and other army bicycle
enthusiasts have given much thought to
the use of the wheel in actual warfare. Its
failure to stand alone haa been the chief
argument used against it. When a bicycle
corps cets fairly under way on a eood road
no difficulty is experienced. A halt, how
ever, meaut dismount, and each man was
compelled to hold fast to his machine.
The new support overcomes this obstacle,
and the silent steed is now under greater
control than the horse. Two of the sup
ports have been selected for inspection.

tne gorgeous ball which she is to give on
the night of February 10. She reads but
few, if any, however, and many of them
are unmistakably the production of epis

It is entirely safe to say to no event in
New York's wealthy social circles has ever
stirred up so much interest as this ball,
not only among the public at large, but
by those fashionable people who are sup
posed to be superior to any vulgar show of
emotions.
No lurther proof of the extraordinary
interest taken by society folk m the event
is needed than the fact that some of the
principal custumers in the town were com
pelled yesterday to shut down oa further
orders. In consequence of this there was
a scramble for the services of the lesser
lights in the business.
All sorts of plans and projects in con
nection with the big event are being
formed.
Mrs. Ogden Mill 3, Mrs. Frederic Bron
son, Mrs. Henry Sloane and Mis, John
Jacob Astor are among those who will
cive costume dinners on the night of the

shine any at the ball. Yards and yards of
valyet will be used for his regal mantle,
which will be of the blue of France lined

WEAVER VILLE IS EXCITED.
Box Full of Human Skeletons Found on

REDDING. Cal., Jan. 28. -The people
of the progressive little ruining town of
Weaverville, the county seat of Trinity
County, have been thrown into a fever of

The Call correspondent learns the par

does solve the whereabouts of an entire
family who mysteriously disappeared
from Weaverville over twenty-nve years ,
ago.
Two sons of Mr. Zuger have been at
work for two weeks sluicing a piece of
ground on their father's premises. The
particular piece of ground is a cut be
tween two cracks and not over half a
mile from the Weaverville Courthouse.
The ground has never been worked since
Mr. Zuzer moved onto it, and that was in
the tail of 1871. 'While at work sluicing
the boys uncovered a box, quite badly de
cayed and containing seven human skele
tons.
Some were full-grown, while other 9 were
small, as of children. They reported their
discovery, and all Weaverville has turned
out to gaze on the bones.
Ttie boys thought at rirst the skeletons
were those of In ;ians, but on second
thought decided that could not be, as In
dians never bury their dead in boxes, and
especially as early as before 1871 they were
not in the habit of making coffins. The
discovery of the skeletons brought to the
memory of some of the old settlers the
mysterious disappearance of an entire
family about six years before the Zugera
moved to the place.
A family named Jensen lived in the
very spot where the bones were found.
The family -consisted of father, mother
and several children. One morning their
nous* was discovered burned and the
family missing. A couple of days there
alter the father was seen, but only for a
few moments, after which he disappeared,
and to this day no trace has been heard of
the unfortunate family.
It is now supposed by many that the
skeletons now brought to light are those
of that family, who were either murdered
by a fiendish father and buried there or
else made the victims of Indiana, the
father alone escaping. His departure
later, however, was suspicious. The bones
have been temporarily reinterred, but it
In said an investigation will be held in an
effort to solve tne mystery.

WASHINGTON. D. G, Jan. 28.â The
proposed sale ol the property of tbe Union
Pacific Railroad under foreclosure pro
ceedings instituted by tbe Attorney-Gen
eral is sought to be impeded and prevent
ed by a resolution offered in the Senate
to-day by Allen, the Populist Senator
from Nebraska.
Allen's resolution instructs the Com
mittee on Pacific Roads to inquire <md
report whether, under existing law*, the
executive department has authority to
foreclose the Government mortgage on
the Union Pacific Raiiroad and tJ sail the
property without additional legislation;
also as to the authority of tba President
or Attorney-General to contract in ad
vance of sale for the amount that is to be
bid; also whether it is not the duty of the
President and the Secretary of the Treas
ury to redeem or otherwise clear off all
the paramount liens ry paying the same,
and directing the Attorney-General in the
meantime to refra.n from entering into
further stipulations or agreements re
specting the sale of the property.
Allen proceeded to explain and advo
caie his resolution. He said that the re
organization committee would be, by
virtue of the purchase, subrogated to all
the rights and properties of the Union
Pacific Company, including a sinking
fund of $14,000,000 or $15,000,000 and a
land grant of about 18,000.000 acres. It
was necessary, he said, that Congress
should have full information, so as to be
able to act Intelligently on the subject.
He arcued that it was tne duty of the
President, under the Jaw, not to direct
foreclosure, but to pay off all paramount
liens and take possession of the property.
There was no pretense, he said, that any
effort had been made by the President to
redeem the property. Tbe right to fore
close was a secondary right, dependent
on the failure of the primary right of re
demption.
Platt (R.) of Connecticut asked Allen
whether under the statute the President
had to use both remedies or whether they
were alternative remedies. Allen replied
that the language of the statute was not
couched so as to make the remedies alter-
native.
The President, he added, could not
ignore the provision of the statute. The
price fixed, Ailen asserted, was not equal
to 50 per cent of the value of the property;
in his judgment it was not equal to 35 per
cent. He complained that the property,
worth $140,000,000, should be taken from
the control of Congress by an executive
order, and said it was bad enough to have
the Cuban affair and other foreign matters
â withdrawn from the control of the Senate
without having domestic matters also
withdrawn.
Thurston (R.)of Nebraska said that he
desired to address the Senate on the sub
ject and asked that the resolution go over
until to-morrow, and it was so ordered.
The bill for a representation by com
mission at any international monetary
conference was taken cp, and Chandler
addressed the Senate in favor of it. He
appealed to Cannon (R.) of Utah to with
diaw his amendment requiring the hold
ing of the conference in the United States.
He also appealed to Stewart (Pop.) of
Nevada, whom he spoke of as "the friend
of my lifetime," to withdraw his amend
ment, which provides that, within a
month after the failure and adjournment
of the conference, gold and silver shall be
coined in the United States mints, the
silver into standard silver dollars.
Stewart said that he bad no disposition
to embarrass or hinder the passage of the
bill, but be went on to argue that the
United States should alone coin silver
dollars on a fixed ratio of gold.
Alter we fix our own money," he was
asked by Hoar (II.) of Massachusetts,
"and after we conclude that it is for our
good to get goid and silver coined at our
mints at a certain ratio, would it not be a
good thing if we could persuade the other
nations of the world to adopt the same
ratio?"
"I think not," Stewart replied. "I
think it would be a very bad thing. In
the first place, it would rob us of the ad
vantage of acquiring silver. Let them
Btict to gola, although the bill is very
humiliating to the United States in that
it requires other nations to give their con
sent to our legislation. I shall not oppose
its passage.''
. In the course of along speech Stewart
yielded â¢ the floor fora moment to <l*able
Bacon (D. ) of Georgia to offer an amend
ment to the bill authorizing the President
of the United States to call, in his discre
tion, such international conference to as
semble at such point as may be agreed
upon.
â  Chandler said that while he did not
thin-k it necessary, he saw no objection to
jt, and therefore lie was willing that it
should be adopted.
Stewart then went on with his speech.
While he was descanting upon all the
evils inflicted upon the people and when
he used the phrase, "You are responsible
for all this," Hoar asked him, jocularly,
who he meant by "you." "Did he mean
the Vice-President?" [Laughter].
â¢'When I say 'you,' >: Stewart ex
claimed, "I mean every servant of the
British power; I mean every man who
Likes to see the poor miserable and tne
rich happy; I mean those who want to
have a stronger Government here to keep
down the rabble."
â¢ Stewart resumed his speech, and said
that he would allow the bill to pass in any
form that its friends desired. At the close
of his speech the bill went over till to
morrow, and the Senate went into execu
tive'session.
The doors were reopened at 4:30 p. at.
and the Nicaragua canal Dill was taken
up. Morgan presented a substitute for
tne amendment offered by him yesterday
to meet the objection made in tne com
munication of Minister Rodriguez. He
also presented resolutions from the Na
tioual Board of Trade, sitting in Wash
ington, declaring that the construction of
the Nicaragua canal is of the highest im
portance to the commercial interests of
the United States.
The bin was then l..id aside and the
bankruptcy bill taken up. Nelson (R. ) of
Minnesota asserted that there was no bill
beiore Congress of such urgency as a
bankruptcy bill.
"What bankruptcy bill?" Hale (R.) of
Vaine asked. - "Is it the Torres bilit" j
"Some kind of a bankruptcy bVL" Nel

THE HARRISON BILL
New Provision Eliminating the Union Paci~
fie as Foreclosure Is Confined to
the Central Pacific.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.â After
being so amended that It should not inter
fere with the foreclosure proceedings
which the Government has instituted
Bgainst the Union Pacific Railroad the
Harrison bill to settle the indeb edncss of
the Pacific railways to the Government by
a commission consisting of the Secretary
of tbe Treasury, the Secretary of the In
terior and the Attorney-General was con
sidered at the meeting to-day of the sub
committee of the Pacific Railroad Com
mitue and ordered reported favorably to
tbe full committee.
Tbe bill provides that the Government
shall still control the rates of fare and
transportation; that the commission shall
report their action one year from the pas
sage of the bill, and gives the commission
full power to seitle the indebtedness of
one or all the bonded railroads to the Gov
ernment.
Tnere was a provision engrafted on the
bill to-day eliminatinc ihe Union Pacific
Railroad from the commission, because
the foreclosure proceedings limits the com
mission to the indebtedness of the Cen
tral Pacific, the branch line extending
from Atcnison, Kas., 100 miies west, ana
thf Sioux City ami Pacific.
Toe bill wili be laid before the full com
mittee at a special session to be held on
Saturday, and judging from the opinions
expressed at the previous meeting of tlie
committee it is not unlikely that a favor
abie report will be ordered. In this event
Speaker Reed will be asked to set the time
for its consideration. The fate of the bill
is uncertain. Those who are most deeply
interested in it expressed a disinclination
to speculate upon the chances of its
passage.

HUBBARD HAS * SUBSTITUTE.
Prepare* a Bill to Settle the Itebtt of
Pacific Railroad*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 29.-Rep
resentative Hubbard of Missouri, repre
senting the minority on the House Pa
cific Railroads Committee, has prepared
the draft of a bill us a substitute for the
"Harrison bill" providine for a commis
mission to settle the debts of the Pacific
railroads. Hubbard's bill provides that
each section of the country shall be repre
sented on such commission, and that
there shall be thirteen members.
There is a provision included regulating
freight rates and passenger fares on the
Central Pacific, and in anticipation that
Huntington or his agents might possibly
buy in the Central Pacific at a public sale
it is expressly provided that the pur
chasers of the Central Pacific shall enter
into ao kind of traffic agreement with the
Southern Pacific.
ECKELS OK fIU SUCK.
HÂ« Tell* H7iv the Country Has Lately
Suffered.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.âComp
troller Eckels of the Treasury to-day ad
dressed the Committee on Currency, and
Banking on several bihs referred to him.
He said a great depression had been
brought about by overtrading, unwise
credit and unusual extravagance â public
and private.
The great decline in the goid reserve
was caused by fear on the part of the pub
lic that the Government could not meet
its demand obligations. The legal tenders
could be gradually turned in away which
would not attract speculation. If the plan
of Secretary McCulloch, he contended,
had been followed and the obligation* re
tired, we would never have had the late
trouble.
Hawaiian Cable Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 25â The
Republican steering committee this after
noon decided to make ' the Hawaiian
cable bill the order of business after the
Nicaraguan canal bill is out of the way.
This action was conveyed to the Demo
cratic committee, and while that commit
tee has not finally concurred the majority
of the members this afternoon agreed in
formally that at a meeting to be held to
morrow they would consent to this order.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 1897.
THE INDIAN BILL
PASSES THE HOUSE
Liberal Appropriations for
the Sioux Agency
Schools.
Humorous and Acrimonious
Speeches on Altgeld and
Secretary Morton.
Agricultural Bill Was Sidetracked.
D.ffrrences en the Purity of
Ohio Election.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.âSev
eral interesting and at times humo rous
acrimonious political speeches were un
expectedly precipitated upon the House
to-day, just at the close of an ott erwise
dull session, during which the considera
tion of the Indian appropriation bill, be
gun on Monday last, wa.^ concluded, and
tbe bill passed with some material
changes, all reducing the scope of tbe
measure.
Wadswortn (R.) of New York, chair
man of the Committee on Agriculture, had
called up the bill making appropriations
for the agricultural department for the
year 1897-98, and following Sherman's
course in the management of the Indian
bill, yielded the floor to Grosvenor (R.) of
Ohio. That gentleman usea the oppor
tunities thus accorded him to defend the
State of Ohio from what he termed the
false charges of ex - Goremor Altgeld,
mode in the latter's speech at the recep
tion given him last week. Other speak
ers defended Altgeld.
During the day Grout (R.) of Vermont
reported the appropriation bill for the
District of Columbia.
Thomas (R.) of Michigan gave notics
that on Wednesday next he would ask the
House to consider the report of Election
Committee 3 on the contest of Cornett
vs. Swansen. from the Fifth Virginia Dis
trict.
The Speaker laid before the House a
num ber of private bills with Senate amend
ment*, which were agreed to. Other
bills which the house had amended were
sent to conference, the Senate refusing to
accept the House amendments.
By unanimous consent a bill was con
sidered and passed to extend the time of
the ccn>truction by the East Nebraeka and
Gulf Railroad Company of its line through
the Omaha and Winnebaco reservation,
Nebraska.
To half a dozen others, mostly private
pension bills, objection was made and
they went over.
Grout (R.) of Vermont reported the ap-
Dropriatiun bill for the District of Colum
bia. Calendar.
The House then went into committee of
the whole to further consider the Indian
appropriation bill. The paragraph im
meu..aefy under consideration was that
providing for the salaries and expenses of
the Dawes Indian Comm ission.
Sherman (R.) of New York offered an
amendment changing the phraseology of
the paragraph to meet the objections
raised by Cannon ( R. ) of Illinois and also
reducing the amount from $50,000 to
$43,000. Agreed to.
On a roint o f order made by Cannon an
item of $.50,000 for the irrigation of the
southern U;o allotments was stricken out.
Murphy (K. )of Arizona offered, through
Curtis (R.) of Kansas an amendment at
the suggestion of the Bureauof Ethnology
forbidding the removal or destruction of
antiquities on reservations in the western
country under pena'ty. Agreed to.
The Drovision inserted by the commit
tee that "hereafter wtiere funds appro
priated in speciuc terms for a particular
object are not sufficient for the object
named, any other appropriation general
in its terms, which would otherwise be
available, may be used to accomplish the
object for which the specific appropriation
was made," met the proniDt objection of
Dockery (D. ) of Missouri, and being new
legislation was rejected.
An amendment proposed by Curtis (R.)
of Kansas was agreed to providing that
the children of a marriage between a white
man and an Indian woman sbouid have
the same rights to the property of the
tribe to which the mother belonged asanv
otl.er member of the tribe.
The proposition to abolish the offices of
Commissioner and Assistant Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs and to appoint a
board of Indian Commissioners to do their
work went out on a point of order.
An item of $10,000 for the erection of a
bridge across the Big Wind River on the
Shothone reservation, Wyo., went out on
a point of order.
The paragraph removing all restrictions
against the leasing, sale or conveyance of
ti.e allotted lands ot the Puyallup Indians
in Pierce County, Wash., also went out
on a point of order.
The appropriations for schools ($225,000)
and for employes ($85,000), at the Sioux
agencies, which bad been quÂ»stioned by
Cannon, were agreed to, he having with
drawn his objection.
Ad amendment was agreed to appropri
ating $3000 to repair the bridge over Big
Wind Kiver, Wyo.
The last sixteen pages of the bill in
which were set out the terms of the agree
ment with the Shoshone and Arapahoe
tribes of Indians in Wyoming and with
the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa
Indians, North Dakota, with the declara
tion that they be ratified and confirmed,
were stricken out on the ground that the
ratification had no place in a general ap
propriation bill.
Tne committee rose, the bill was re
ported to the House, the various amend
ments agreed to, and as thus amended the
biil was passed.
The conference report upon the bill
authorizing the purchaser of the Atlantic
and Pacific Railroad, under foreclosure of
the mortgage, to incorporate the company,
was presented by Powers (R.) of Vermont,
and he gave notice that he would call it
up for consideration to-morrow.
The House again went into committee
of the whole to consider the agriculture
appropriation bill. Debate was limited to
an hour, half of which was occupied by
Grosvenor (R.)of Ohio, in a reply to the
speech by ex-Governor Altgeld, at the
recent banquet given in his honor at the
c-lose of his gubernatorial term. Altgeld
had declared that, in the Jale election,
Bryan was defrauded of victory by stuffing
the t allot- boxes in certain States named.
One of these was Ohio, in which he said
94,000 fraudulent votes had been counted
for McKinley. If there had been a fair
election, Altgeld had. asserted, Bryan
would have carried the State by over
40,000 plurality.
Grosvenor said he would have supposed
that Alteeld wonld be the last man to
drag out from the rapidly closing waves
of oblivion the facts of the late election,
for it was bis understanding that one of
the most potent factors in the Republican
victory was the desire to defeat a party
tbnt bad him for one of its leaders.
Grosvenor declared that no State in the
Union had fairer elections or better elec
tion laws tnan Ohio. He reviewed the
table ol votes at recent elections in O.io,
which showed that the Republican vote
in 1896 increased over tuat ol 1895 by
120,000, while the Democratic vote showed
an increase of over 200,000. So that what
ever fraud in the Republican vote was be
yond the comprehension of that profes
sional slanderer applies with twice as
much loroe to the Democrats as the Re
publicans.
He asserted that in several States the
election resulted in increasing the Repub
lican majority. The slander of AUgeld,
Grosvenor said, had not been repeated
nor indorsed by a single Democratic
leader or Democratic newspaper in the
State of Ohio.
Grosvenor's remarks were supplemented
Dy Bromweil (K.) of Ohio, wno presented
a table of votes cast at State and Presi
dential elections in Ouio since tne Repub
lican party named its first Presidential
candidate.
De Armond (D.)of Missouri, disclaiming
any interest in the controversy between
ex-Governor Altgeld and the Republican
Senators of Ohio, continued tbe general
debate on the agricultural bill by r aaing
from a newspaper article, printed shortly
after the November election, which went
toshowtbat AUgeld's charges regarding
the vote of Ohio were well founded. As to
AUgeld himself, De Armond said, it must
be conceded by friend and foe alike that
he had the courage of his convictions and
made his charges where there was an op
portunity to answer tfcem. He said it
might be that the Governor would have
an answer here to tne gentleman from
Ohio, for he seemed to have yet the sup
port of a large and enthusiast. c following
in his State, and, he believed, in the coun-
try.
De Armond then devoted himself to a
topic having some relation to the billâ
the bulletins issued by the Department of
Agriculture, snowing, as he said, the illit
eracy and poverty of those Suites which
had the temerity to declare their desire to
see the restoration V c free coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. This he de
clared to be a slander upon that part of
the people whom the Secretary of Agri
culture in the administration of hi? ofhce
was supposed to particularly represent.
C. W. Stone (R.) of Pennsylvania said:
"The gentleman understands that the Re
publicans are not responsible for the
official?"
De Armond â Oh, certainly, and I can
thoroughly appreciate the gratification
you must feel over that faot. Years ago
it was said of a great Secretary, "The Sec
retary stood alone; modern degeneracy
has not reached him." Now the iangna'ge
is different. "The Secretary stands alone;
modern deseneracy has not passed him."
[Laughter.] He apuealed to the Repub
licans to tind a place for him after tnis
administration ended. He understood, of
course, that he could not be kept in his
present place. In former times royal
courts comprised such an individual, but
there was no court now to place him.
"But," he asked, ''can't you put him on
a shelf in the museum labeled as a curi
osity of modern political lifÂ« and modern
political administration ?''
Grosvenorâ l understand the gentleman
to criticize my remarks, partly at least, on
the grounrt that Governor Altgeld would
have no opportunity to reply. May I ask
what arrangement the gentleman has
made for the Secretary of Agriculture to
respond to tnis attack?
De Armond â I cannot imagine, Mr.
Speaker, but that ttÂ»e gentleman from
Ohio, who speaks here at least once 3 day
and often several days, will respond for
him. [Laughter,]
De Armond tiien, to the great, amuse
ment of the House, described Secretary
Morton as a man who was always writing
when he was not talking, always talkihg
when he was not writing, and always do
ing both when not thinking, and con
cluded wiih the following parody on
Gray's lines:
Full many a whim of purest ray serene,
Th*- daiic un fathomed dreams of Morton bear,
Ful many a wheel is formed to whirr unseen
And >â¢ a*tt Its flretness 'oeath J. Sterling's hair.
Wadsworth then stated that the pend
ing bill carried a total appropriation of
13,152,752, a net decrease ol $102,780 from
tue appropriation for the current fiscal
year.
In the appropriation for the Weather
Bureau there was a decrease of $330 in the
item for salaries and a total decrease of
$4290 in the same item for the entire de
partment aside Irom the Bureau of Ani
mal Industry. For that bureau an in
crease of $25,000 was provided in order to
extend the inspection of meat provided
for in the act of March 3, 1891, to numerous
abattoirs and packing-houses which have
requested such inspection and which have
not up to the present time received it.
The committee arose at 5:10 and on
motion of Payne (R.) of New York the
House adjourned.
TWO REPGRTERS MAY BE DEAD.
Inexplicable Collision on the Mississippi
and the Newspaper Men Go Down
With Their Yacht.
NEW ORLEANS. La., Jan. 28.â The
Norwegian steamship Albert Dumers and
the steam yacht Argo collided in the Mis
sissippi River, near Point Eads, at 12:35
o'clock, and two reporters, members of
the Picayune's staff, were probably
drowned, as nothing was seen of tneni
after the boats came together.
The Dumers lay by and searched for
the missing men for more than an hour,
after picking up the boats, but nothing
was seen of them.
Nine persons, including the crew, were
aboard the Argo, which had been char
tered by the Picayune to convey its re
porters to the jetties that were to be
viewed by the Congressional delegation
now in this locality.
Up to that time no arrangements for the
preaÂ« had been made on the steamer
Whitney, which waÂ» carrying the Con
gressmen. The Argo left Algiers some
time before the Whitney departed with
the Congressional party, and this is how
she came to be in the middle of the Mis
sissippi when the Dumers was on her way
up the river.
At 11 o'clock all on board the Argo, ex
cept Captain Brown, in command, and
the engineer, went to bed. The crash
when the Argo and the Dumers struck
awoke everybody, and all clambered on
deck in their underclothing to hnd their
boat stove in and fast sinking.
The largest boat the Argo carried
would barely hold the party, but they
crowded into it and cast off. The wind
was high, and considerable difficulty was
experienced in getting to the Dumers, as
the overloaded boat was unmanageable.
The names of the missing reporters are
H. B. Blessine and Harrison Hesler.
The latter is a son of Secretary Hesler
of the Cotton Exchange. It is believed
he was asleep in the cabin of the yacht,
the shock not awakening him, and went
down with the vessel.
The collision is inexplicable. It oc
curred at a point where the river is narrow
ana a strong current runs, and Captain
Brown of the yacht probably lost his head
at a critical moment.
Steltner Â«irnrrf<-d the Fight.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28. â The
board of governors of the Sacramento
Athletic Club to-night annulled the de
cision of Referee Donahue in declaring
the Stelzner-Van Buskirk ficht a draw,
and awarded the tight to Stelzner. The
club hail reserved the risjbt to overrule
the referee's decision, if in its judgment
the contest was not given to the one hav
ing the most decided advantage.

GOVERNOR SADLER
WILL SURELY SIGN
Glove- Contest Bill Passes
the Legislature of
Nevada.
Opposition of Ministers Killed
by Speedy Action of the
Senate.
Carson Is Jubilant and Assumes a
Eusy Airâ Work to B.gin oa
the B.g Pavilion.
C ARSON, Nev., Jan. 2?.â There was
great excitement in the Senate chamber
when the glove-contest bill was placed on
final passage this morning. It was gener
ally believed the nieht before that the biil
was doomed, but members who had been
against it received telegrams from all over
the State urging tnem to stand by the bill.
As tnese telegrams were read from the
clerk's desk it was eaay to see tnat the
tide was turning, as many of the dis
patches were from prominent men and
heavy taxpayers.
There was a scene of snppreued excite
ment as the roll was called an.' when two
doubtful Senators wheeled in line the
vote stood 9 to 6 and the news spread rap
idly over the city. The business men were
delighted at the news and there was hardly
a dissentiHc voice except from the clergy.
The pastors of. the various denomina
tions met in solemn conclave the ni^i.t
before and held a council of war. Tney
decided to smite the coming iniqui;y with
a series. of resolutions netting forth in
becoming clerical language their ideas of
the bill. Tney drew up the protest and
in the morning were circulating it among
iheir flocks.
While they were thus engaged the
President of the Senate had hammered
the desk with bit gavel and announced
the passage of the bill. The parsons, who
were about to spring their petition on the
Senate, were met by tho crowd coming out
announcing that the measure was passed.
They made an attempt to get it recon
sidered, but could find no one to make
the motion, and to-.nignt the bill is being
enrolled for the Governor's signature.
The Governor is a hard- headed German,
who has no Puritanical ideas on the
proposition. He believes that the matches
if properly conducted will tring thcu-ands
of people to Nevada who otherwise would
not come, and they will be brougnt in
contact with the great natural resources
of the State. Besides this, nine-tenths of
the people of Nevada are in favor of tho
bill, and there is no doubt that he will*
sign it to-morrow.
The bili calls for $1000 to be paid by the
managers for each tight, and the idea is
that if there i 3 to be any lighting it will
be properly handled. It also shuts out
the Cheap John fighters who have become
a nuisance in Nevada.
Up to to-day there has been a stringent
law here against pugilistic encounters,
but it has never been enforced and no
Grand Jury ever pays the slightest atten
tion to iis violators.
W. K. Wheelock. the agent of Dan
Stuart, stated to The Call reporter this
evening that he had no authority from
Mr. Stnart to say where the fight would
come off; Mr. Stuart was the proper per
son to make the announcement. There is
no doubt, however, that the right will
come off at the Carson racetrack at the
time set and- In a pavilion that will hold
at least 15,000 people.
Already the San Francisco sporting men
are telegraphing for accommodations at
the hotels, and it is regarded in San Fran
cisco that tne matter is now definitely
settled. Another good feature to them is
the certainty of no interference, which
enables those who desire to see the great
est contest of the past quarter of a cen
tury to make their plans.
To-day teleerams were pouring in from
all over the United States from newspa
pers hungry for news of the affair. The
plans for the big pavilion aie expected
here in a few days and every idle man
hereabout will be put to work.

DALLAS, Texas, Jan. 2S.â Dan Stuart
to-night informed the correspondent of
the United Associated Presses thatCorbett
and Fitzsimmons will fight in Nevada on
March 17. Mr. Stuart said:
"I am gratified at the liberal spirit
tbown toward athletic sports by tho Leg
islature and Governor of Nevada. It had
not originally been my intention to have
Corbett an 4 Fitzsimmonsmeetin that State
after signing them for a second time; but
things have so shaped themselves that
Nevada is the most desirable location in
sight.
"I shall start for Nevada within the
next four or five days, to devote my time
to the details of making the battle a suc
cess as a high-class sporting event.

Eddie Connolly Before an Excited
Crowd in England.

five rounds, in whicn ttie exchanges were
about even, Burge landed a crushing blow
on Connolly's neck, knocking him down.

rapidity irom the effects of the blow which
had come so near knocking him out, and
in the uext round be bad BtlrÂ»;e groggy.
The spectators were wild with excite
ment wnen they saw the iavorite in this
condition.

were weak, but game. In the midalo of
the tenth round ihe management declined
to allow the fight to proceed further, and
the referee then stopped the fight and an

STOCKTON'S COLORED GUEST.
An Idiotic Youth Charged With Three
Attempts at Train- Wreck ing /s
in Custody.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 28.â There is
now in the County Jail a simpleton col
ored boy, not quite 19 years old, who is
charged with having made three attempts
to wreck a train near the Ripon station.
His name is Thomas Campbell and be
was brought here last nigut by Deputy
Constable Black and Railroad Detectives
W. B. Brissell and C. C. Crowley. They
arrested the young negro late yesterday
afternoon in a river bed near the home of
his grandfather. The detectives had
been working on the case for several
weeks and succeeded in catching Camp
bell without much trouble.
Campbell was seen at the jiil this morn
inc and there admitted having opened a
switch three times, bÂ«it said that he did
not haTe any purpose of wrecking the
train, but ju-t wanted to see it stop. A
man at Bakersneld, from which place
Campbell went to Ripon to live with his
grandfather, to!d him that if he wanted
to see a train stop suddenly to open a
switch.
Once the train was sidetracked and the
other times it was stopped short as soon
as it was learned that it was on the wrong
track. Campbell said that after opening
the switch he wonld wait at the station to
see the fun. He confessed also to the offi
cers, declaring, however, that he had no
criminal intent.

PALO ALTO, Cal., Jan. 28.â The Rich
mond was destroyed by fire this morning.
The house, which was owned by Mrs. Rob
erts, had been rented to Clark '98 and his

The loss was about $4000, part of which
was covered by insurance.
The students having charae of the house
lost everything they possessed except their
wearing apparel. It was their intention

The tire protection at Palo Alto is entire
ly inadequate for the size of the town. A
small waterpipe and an efficient tire buck
et brigade is the extent of its resources.

Vanderbilt project to build a railroad from
Salt Lake to this city and also foreshadow
ing steamship connections are absolutely
without foundation.

IMPORTANT LAND DECISION.
A Timber Patent on the Parry Mining
Properly Obtained by False
Representations.
CHICO, Cal., Jan. 23.â One of the most
important land cases that has been tried
in the Superior Court for years was yes
terday decided by Ju^dge John Gray, after
a nine days' legal battle between the
parties to the action â M. L. Merry and
George Parry, plaintiffs, and Lincoln
Brodt, defendant â in an action to quiet
title to the property known as the Parry
mine. The plaintiffs have been working
the ground lor a number of years, hold
ing it by virtue of location and by deed
from locarors and having expended the
sum of $22,000 for machinery and labor.
Upon applying for a patent the plaintiffs
were surprised to find that the defendant
had received a timber patent to the said
land, whereupon they brought the action
to quiet title.
Judge Gray decided in favor of the
plaintiffs, adjudging that the defendant
he.d the real estate subject to said action
as trustee for plaintiffs and that he be re
quired within ten days after the decree is
entered by pood and valid deed to con
vey to plaintiffs all bis interest in and to
said property subject to said action.
Colonel Park Henshaw and Richard
White were attorneys for the plaintiffs.
Tiiis case has occasioned much interest in
mining circles all over the State, as the
defendant has been indicted by the Fed
eral Grand Jury for swearing falsely to
obtain the timber patent.
SJX DIEGO AS A TERMIXUS.
One 2nd of the. Pacific Cable mil Be
Located Here.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 28.â 1t was
given out this afternoon that Edward
Ram'oo, and U. A. Griscom of New York,
who purchased 120 acres of land in Point
Loma last week and left here Monday,
were advance representatives of the
Pacific (able Company of New York,
which proposes to lay a cable from San
Diego to Yokohama via Honolulu. Plans
are now in the architect's bands here,
for the erection of a big stone building on
the point, to be used as the American
terminus of the cable.
Surveyors went over the Point to-day.
The site selected commands a erand view
of the mountains and ocean. The hydro
graphic survey made four years ago shows
that the land falls away very rapidly from
the shore leaving little surf and no cur
rents. A private wire to-day says that
Gnscom has gone to Honolulu to secure
land there lor a cable station. A subsidy
proposition is now before Congress. Full
particulars will be known in a few days.
THE BLIGHTING CIGARKITK.
Interesting Developments in Santa
l!oi<i's Hiffh Ac/tool.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. 28.â A very
strong argument against the use of
cigarettes was brought to light in the
Santa Rosa High School to-day. Pro
fessor Coz, while engaged in marking the
standings of the young men in his de
partment, found that those who indulged
in cigarettes did not stand well in their
classes. It is the custom to mark those
who average well with a capital "E,"
which signifies excellence, and a careful
canvass of the cigarette-smokers of the
entire school reveals the astounding fact
that not one of the tobacco-users has the
"E" after his name. As the boys of the
High School are familiar with tie stand
ing of each of their fellows, as well as
their habits in the pmoking line, the
moral will be easily drawn and a falling
off in trade may be looked for by the
tobacco- venders of this city.

BOYCE CONVICTED
AT REDWOOD CITY
The Old Convict Guilty of
Burglary in the First
Degree.
Sensational Evidence of Two of
His Accomplices in the
Dastardly Crime.
Murder Wcu'd Have Been Committed
but for the InterTrence of
One (f Them.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Jan. 28.â After
a trial lasting two days, a jury late' yes
terday afternoon rendered a verdict of
guilty of burglary in the first degree
against Asa 0. Boyce. Daring the prog
ress of the trial evidence was produced
which showed that the crime committed
was one of the most ourageous and
despicable ever committed in this county.
Though the crime for which the defendant
was tried was technically that of burglary,
yet the testimony showed it to be one of
burgiary, arson, and, but for th 6 inter
ference of one of the parties implicated,
one that might have be n murder.
Three parties were implicated in the
commission of the deed, cne of whom
turned State's evidence and the other
pleaded guilty. Both of the latter took
the stand against the defendant and
minutely described every step in the dia
bolical plot. Boyce, who is 64 years of
age and who has served one term in San
Quentin, lives in the mountainous Alpine
District in this county, where he has a
homestead claim on 160 acres of Govern
ment land. His neighbors are few and
far between, one of whom is Frank
Shumet, an old Frenchman, who has a
claim which immediately adjoins his own.
Another of his neighbor! is one JBaptista
Bordi.
On the 18th day of December, 1896, Shu
met was living alone in the Bordi house,
an eigut-room cottage. "What occurred on
that night appeared in evidence on the
trial and is best told by these two Doys,
by name Green and Tann, who were im
plicated in the crime. Tann, who had
worked with defendant about three years
ago on the latter' s place, and Green came
from Boulder Creek on the 18th of Decem
ber last to the cabin of defendant, where
they arrived about 8 o'clock in the morn
in â¢â¢ Tann was greeted by the old man
with a "Hello, I thought you were hune
long ago." He asked the boys if they
were looking for work and told them that
if they were he nad a job for them. The
job referred to was the cornmi-sion of this
offense for which probably all three will
spend some time in durance vile.
"Durine the day their plans wera dis
cussed and firearms cleaned and loaded
for the work they proposed to do that
night. "What those plans wera is best told
by what actually took place as testified to
by the boys. Between 7 and 8 o'clock,
they testified, the three left the house and
started for the Bordi bouse, in which
Shemet was living, distant about a mile
and naif, and where they arrived between
9 and 10 o'clock. Tann, who had black
â¢ ned his face in order to conceal hte iden
tity, went to the door of the cottage and
knocked, while Boyceand Green concealed
themselves within sight of the door, the
former Laving a shotgun loaded with
slugs.
Shumet, who was in bed, responded to
the knock, and as soon as be opened the
door was confronted with a loaded re
volver and told to throw op his hands,
which he did without further urging. He
asked what was wanted and said he did
not have much, but if money or plunder
was what was desired they were welcome
to what he had. To this Tann replied
that he was not after money, but that he
was going to burn up the house. Tann
then made the old man come out and
called Green ana told him to get a rope
and tie the old man's bands behind him.
After doing so and blindfolding him they
led him to a well close by, where he was
made to lie down. Tann then said to
him: "You . I am going to kill you
and throw you in this well. Do you want
to pray?"
To this Green obiected and perhaps
saved the old man's life. Boyce and
Green then went into the house and
stripped it of almost everything portable,
while Tann led the Frenchman away
about 200 yards, where he tied him to a
tree. After ransacking the house it was
sÂ»t on fire. They tbon returned to where
tne old man was and removed the blind,
inviting him to enjoy tha fire. Before
leaving it was suggested that they tie a
rope around the old man's neck just tight
enough to strangle him by slow degrees,
but here the better instincts of one of the
trio prevailed and they merely tied him as
tbpv supposed secarelv and left him.
He remained in this position some two
hours, when he finally worked tne ropes
on his arms loose and liberated himself.
baturday morning he notified the officers
by telephone of what had taken place, and
accused these three parties of the acts.
On the following Wednesday the Sheriff
visited the Boyce cabin and made & thor
ough search for the stolen goods, but none
were found. Green and Tann were on
that day arrested. On Friday the officers
again visited the place and found Boyce
at home alone. They again made seaicb
and found in and about the cabin and
brush immediately surrounding the same
many articles taken from Shumet, all of
which he positively Identified as his own.
Informations were filed against all
three, and the result of the trial of Boyce
has already been seen. Another and sep
arate charge, that of arson, still remains
to be disposed of, but it is thought that on
account of the conviction on the burglary
charge, and considering the aga of the old
man, It will not be pressed. He will
be sentenced to-morrow.

Ti.e story of Smith's desertion was not
known to bis first wife until her visit to
this city some few months a^o. She then
learned that Smith bad been here and
brought with him Mrs. Smith No. 2. The
friends of the first Mrs. Smith when the
second lady arrived supposed that be had
been divorced. Smith and his first wife
lived in this city a few years ago, but, un
fortunately, hbe : became . infatuated with
another woman and the two eloped to the
south, going overland in a bupgy. They
purchased a small ranch near Santa Ana
and . went to housekeeping on a small
scale, where tbÂ«y have lived ever since.
The pair were soon located and Con
stable Gross went down south Tuesday
morning and, together with Deputy Sher
iff Landell, proceeded out to the Smith
ranch, and wktu they arrived there they
found S^ith plowing in the field. They
soon tcia him what was wanted, bat he
flatly der.*ed the cbarce, claiming he was
innocent. Wben the bluff would not
work be a=Ved the officers two days in
which to wind up his business affairs,
but he could not be allowed this time
and is now 03 his way to this city to an
swer to the charge of adultery. Mrs.
Smith No. 2. remains on the ranch.
When the tali facts in this case can be
brouant to lisht it will undoubtedly be out
of the ordintrj iine of scandals, as all
parties are of piominence and the parti
cipants' history iÂ« interesting.
LOS ANGELES DAMAGE SUIT.
An Odd Case in Which the Pullman Com
pany Is Sued for the Value of
Stolen Clothing.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 28.â The trial
of the damage suit of Caanes E. Anthony
vs. The Pullman Palace Car Company was
begun this morning b9foia Superior Judge
Allen and a jury.
The case is quite an odd one, and, al
though the damages asked for are only
$275, there are a goal many nice points
involved, and the company is resisting
the suit with great energy.
The circumstances of the case were that
on the night of November 13. 13!>4, tha
plaintiff and his son were passengers in a,
Pullman car of tue Southern Caiiiornia
Railroad Company.
During the night in question the cloth
ing of the son was stolen whiie he vas
asleep, so that when he reached Los Aa
geles, in the language of the complaint,
"the said son was wnollv w thout c.othinsr
and practically naked" and the lather
was "compelled to take his said son out of
the said car without sufficient clothing to
present a d9cent, reputable appearance,
and with insufficient clothing to protect
him from the inclemency of the season."
It is alleged that the boy was injured by
the exposure and was put to shame, con
tumely and reproach, the amount ot dam
age bein* estimatt-d at $200. This, with
the value <Â«f tne clothing stolen, makes the
amount $^73 for which judgment is asked.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 28.â The
doors of the Home- product Fair were
opened this afternoon to Erin's sons, but
tfae real lun commenced at 8 o'clock this
evening, when the descendants of St. Pat
rick turned out in force to attend the fair
and haye a good time generally.
An excellent programme was arranged,
consistine of old Scotch and Irish med
leys, recitations, songs and stories, includ
ing Scunlan's great poem, "An Address to
the Irishmen of America," by James M.
Ward, by permission of A. Y. Pearson of
the Burbank Theater.
Wherever two or three sons of Ireland
are congregated there may be found wit
and good nature. The music by the band
this afternoon was appropriate to the occa
sion. It was full of the sentiment of
"There are noble souls in Ireland where
the grass grows green." The opening
programme commenced with an address
by D. M. McGarry, chairman of the
evening.
Miss Bcanlon sang "Kathleen Mavour
neen" and M. J. McGarry recited "Robert
Emmet's Address." Miss McCabe sang
"Rosy, Dar ing," followed by a cornet
solo, "Come Back to Erin," by Allan Han
cock, after wnich came a solo by Eugene
Rotn. entitled "Astbore."
To-morrow will be excursion day, when
a large attendance is expected on account
of the reduced rates made by the railroads
and tne number of strani-er^ now in town.
Several tableaus will be presented in the
evening scenes taken from the late war.
RAyDSBVBG DUCILIS SHOCKED.
Joung l.rrfdy Said to Hare Sloped With
thti Bflle of thi Camp.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Jan. 23.âRands
burg society is said to be greatly shocked.
Society ia that lively mining camp is ex
clusive and intensely sensitive, and when
social etiquette is disregarded by a mem
ber of tlie smart S9t there is the greatest
commotion. An event has occurred that
has created a sensation not only in upper
circles, but all along the line,
It is said that Edwara Reddy, young,
gifted, handsome and a great beau, has
eloped with a Mrs. Everett, the belle of
Randsburg. That's why Randsburg so
ciety is all torn np. It is further reported
tÂ£at the couple had between them several
thousand dollars. The woman in the case,
it is said, is the wife of a miner, and the
couple had lived together comparatively
happy until handsome young Reddy ap
peared, and then the husband appeared
in the wife's eyes very plain, uncouth and
ignorant.
But society is often hasty and it iÂ« just
possible that Mr. Keddy's and Mrs. Ever
ett's disappearance are not equivalent to
an elopement by any manner of means.
Young Reddy is a nephew of Hon. Pat
rick Reday, the well-known San Francisco
attorney.

WEAVING A WEB
ABOUT SANDERS
Cellmate of the Professor
Gives Very Damaging
Testimony.
Plots to Secure Two Witnesses
Who Would Give Fabricated
Evidence.
A Maa Who S w Wootton Drivj
Away From H s Ranch With
the D.findant
FRESNO, Gal., Jan. 25.-To-day was a
bad day for Professor W. A. Senders In h:s
trial Defore a jury in Jurtge Webb s court
for forging William Wootton's name.
Some very damaging testimony was intro
duced against him.
Robert Anderson, who had been a cell
mate of the defendant, testified regarding
tie alleged attempt Professor Sanders ha I
made to get hira to find two witnesses to
give fabiicated test mony. The defense
succeeded in proving the unenviable char
acter of the witness, but tne fabricated
which was written by Sanders for the two
testimony witnesses to make affidavit to
was introduced and corroborated Ander
son's testimony. The handwriting in this
case is unquestionably that of Sanders.
The other witness examined during the
day waÂ« Cirarle" Rohloff, who was work
ing at Wootton's rancb when he dis
appeared. Rohloff saw the aged rancher
drive away from hi 3 home with the de
fendant, since which no trace of Wootton
has ever been found. The witness' testi
mony pointed seriously to tha guilt of
ganders.
The attorneys were more careful yester
day to have the witnesses speak loud so
that their answers could be beard by J. M.
Rose, the juror who is partially deaf.
A. R. Anderson testified that he is at
present living in Los Angeles. While he
was confined in the County Jail here, pend
ing his trial for stabbing a man at Kings
burg, he had been a cellmate of Professor
Sanders. ThÂ«y had several conversations
regarding his (Sanders') casÂ«", the profes
sor having broached the subject first.
The witness had offered the defendant no
inducements to get him to make any state
ments.
Anderson said that the defendant
wanted him to get two witnesses to testify
for him. Sanders wrote out some papers â
statements the two witnesses were to
make. The witness was to take these and
go to Los Angeles and employ two men
who would swear to them. Whatever
Anderson should agree io pay these two
men would be satisfactory to Sanders, who
was to bear all cost and expanses. The
amount it was estimated, would range
from $500 to $1000.
District Attorney Snow then read the
statements which Smders bad intended
for fabricated testimony. The witnesses
were to swear in substance that they had
seen "Wootton in Los Angeles and also at
the Midwinter Fair in San Francisco after
he disappeared from his ranch. At both
piac s he was accompaa e<%bv 'he "myth
ical" John Knanscri and R. L. Graves.

mHERE ARE MANY MEN WHO
-*- now and then suffer from nervous
twitching of the eye and other parts.
When the facial nerves twitch there is
certain to be an irritation at their centers
in the brain. These facial nerves origi-
nate in the brain and end in the muscles
of the face. It is then true that these
twitchings show a decline of the nerve
force of man. This decline will give . a
lack of nerve life, and may develop into
nervous debility and then into nervous
prostration. The nerves of a man are
delicate and he should indeed be very
careful not to harass. them, not to abuse
them, not to gnarl or knot them. It is
those who subject the nerves to these fear-
ful strains that bring on nervous debility
and melancholia. American men live'
rapid lives; they do everything overmuch.
They rob the body of blood 'in their ex-
cesses and their indulgences. They are
never content to live in moderation, and
the result is, and it is a pity, too, pre-
maturity. Prematurity shows decay, and
decay means, of course, decline of power.
When you are in this condition the abso-
lute cure is the great "HUDYAN" cure.
"HUDYAN" cures nervous debility, ner-
vous prostration, melancholia and sper-
matorrhoea. If you are suffering consult
the physicians of the Hudson Medical In-
stitute. If you cannot come to their fif-
teen offices write far circulars and testi-
monials.
BLOOD POISON.
It is certainly not known to the laity,
though it is true, that blood poison In its first,
secondary and tertiary state, it not properly
enrotf, will bo carried down from father to
son. After three or four generations blood
poison ends la scrofula, malignant cancers,
etc. You have a body to protect, young man,
and you owe it to yourself and to your chil-
dren to bo â permanently and skillfully cured of
blood poison. If you are suffering from blood
poison, if you notice failing hair, glandular
lumps ou the tongue, lumps on the back of the
neck, Â»ore throat, copper-colored spots on thÂ«
body, consult the great doctors of the Hudson
Medical Institute about their thirty-day cure.
The. thirty-day our* is certain: the thirty-aay
euro It positive. â If you are not cured *in the
lime the doctors specify you will be treated
with thÂ« thirty-day cure free from that time
onward until cured. Write for thirty-day
cur* circulars.

FOR HIS LIFE
Plot to Murder an Influ
ential Chinese in
Sacramento.
Quong Chick, Manager of the
Sam Yup Theater, in
Danger.
"Little Pete's" Widow Now Offers
$2000 fcr the Punishment of
His Assassins
It has just come to light that simul
taneously with the murder ol "LiitJe
Pete" in this City an attempt was made
to murder another influential Chinese in
Sacramento, and that community was
spared the unwelcome sensation attend
ing a foul assassination only by the vigi
lance of certain friends of the man marked
for death in tec capital of the State.
The day before Pete's temerity caused
his dealb six as desperate highbinders as
Chinatown can boast of took the train for
Sacramento. Their mission was to mur
der Quong Hing, the former interpreter of
the Sam Yups, and there exists little
doubt that the deed would have bean con
summated had it not been for the fact
that spies here learned of the intended
crime and immediately wired 'ling of his
danger.
As soon as the latter received the start
ling news he leit his mercantile business
in charge of subordinates and went into
biding until the day before yesterday. In
the meantime the natchetmen arrived
and at various times were seen about
those places where the man marked for
slaughter was most likely to be found.
On the day before yesterday Quong
rime quietly boarded the train for San
Francisco, wnere he would be surrounded
by friends and in comparatively small
danger of losinz his life so long as he ob
served ordinary precaution. The high
binders were apprised of h.s arrival here
and have since returned.
Quong H;ck, the manager of the Sam
Yup theater, on Jcckson street, is another
person whose life is in constant danger.
The success of that institution, it is said,
i? largely owing to his bu-iness enterprise
:un<! sagacity, and in order to give the rival
See Yup house, lately opened on Wash
ington street, a better chance to thrive he
bas been placed on the death-list.
Bo'.h Quong Hing and Quong Chick are
frequently seen on t:;e street together;
but they are always accompanied by a
Caucasian guard. White guards have a
"snap" in the Chinese quarter nowadays.
The conspiracy to murder Hing in Sac
ramento shows one thing pretty conclu
sively â that sooner or later "Little Pete"
would have been murdered even if his
White guard were atong. The idea in
killing liing was to keep him from re
turning to this city and filing the office of
interpreter to the Sam Yups, whio would
be left vacant by Pete's death. The
Chinese say the sum on Quong Hing's
and Quong Chick's head is $1000 each.
WIDOW SEEKS REVENGE.
Chun LI Offers $2000 Reward for
Her Husband's Murderer,
Although a pagan woman, born in a
paga.n empire and surrounded by pagan
influences, revenge is as sweet to the
widow of the murdered "Little Pete" as it
is to tbe bluest blooded aristocrat that
treads the earth. She seeks vengeance for
her husband's d6ath and is willing to part
with a portion of the gold he hoarded
and left her, when the highbinder's bullet
cut' short his life.
Such, at least, is the deduction drawn
from the following notice, copies of which
were circulated ahout Chinatown yester
day afternoon:
NOTICE.
A reward of $2000 Is hereby offered for the
conviction of the murderers of Fong Ching,
otherwise known as Little Pete, who was mur
dered in this City on Jan vary 23, 1897.
Chun Li, Widow of Fong Chiug.
Many a Sam Ynp face lit up when he
read tne placard, knowing that gold
would tempt the most vicious hatchet
man to betray his companion if he knew
ihat he could do so and escape assassina
tion. The See Yups, however â those who
hold the slayer of "Little Pete" in the
light of a hero â scowled ominously when
they read tbe posters, showing too plainly
that their sympathies are with the mur
derer, not the murdered. Several of the
reward notices were posted, but tbe See
Yups refrained from committing any
ovurt act and the notices remained
during daylight undisturbed. Under the
cover of night, however, several of them
â were torn down, but not under the eyes
of the police.
SMASHING OF THE JARS.
Serjeant Price's Hatchet Brigade
V on the Warpath.
' . .Sergeant Price, "the American terror,"
and his squad, "dressed pay as peacocks,"
moved through the highbinder dens of
Chinatown with ax and sledge yesterday
afternoon. When he was tbroueh with
his march where gay decorations and
handsome paraphernalia once gladdened
the hearts of the Mongolians nothing re
mained but unsightly traces of demolition
and chaotic desolation.
Early in the morning the sergeant se
lected six men and went with them to the
Gibson House on Jackson street, between
Dupont and Kearny. The ghosts of many
a Chinese victim have stalked through the
dark hallways and slept in the dingy
rooms of this building, and the police
wanted to meet them. On the upper floor
of the building is located the meeting
room of the Suey Sing Tong. In this
room the squad of destruction found half
& dozen Mongolians all more or less under
the influence of opium.
A short search brought to light several
pieces of lead pipe and an assortment of
wicked-looking knives. These were
promptly confiscated and the squad pro
ceeded to its work of demolition.
Axes and hammers splintered, chopped
and smashed, and in a few moments the
once gaudy room could not claim a stick
upon a stick. The Chinamen were al
i lowed to remain and watch.
I A small dark room on the second floor
* o' 822 Clay street, the homn of ;wo wild
Â»t>yed hatcuet men, next received its share
of police attention. It was wrecked be
yond repair, and a red-eyed joss that had
faithfully guarded the room for many
years was dismembered. Its skull was
cracked and it was tossed without fear of
vil into the heap of wreckage. This epi
sode finished the day's work of demoli
tion.

HE CARRIED A SLUNGSHOT
A Nevipaper * hlef Who Was Allowed
to Go free by Judge
Joachimsen.
George Dunn is under arrest on two
charges, one of petty larceny and another
of carrying a concealed weapon.
The arrest is one of the beneficial results
of the instructions given out a couple of
days ago by Captain Wittman to his men.
He called their attention to the fact that
Chief Crowley was in daily receipt of com
plaints innumerable, to the effect that
petty thieves abound in the Western
Division; that they stole all thing'with
in easy access and especially the morning
papers thrown at the door-* of subscribers.
Dunn was captured on Fell street by
Officers Hostetter and S. Bonner. Judge
Joauhimsen took it upon nirnself to allow
him to go from jail on his own recog
nizance, and shortly after that the officers
found that the man carried a murderous
s ungshot such as is used by footpads.
This caused them to place the second
charge against him, that of carrying a
concealed weapon.
George Loomis, an individual taken into
custody at the same time as Dunn, has
been held a prisoner in the tanks that his
past record may be investigated.
SWAN HILDA'S SAILING TIME
Now Out Sixty-Sx Days, but Not
Yet Overdue.
Sixty-six days to-day since the Swan
hilda left Newcastle, and still no sail in
sight to indicate the coming of Butler, the
Australian murderer. This does not nec
essarily mean an unusual delay, as the
average passage is nearer seventy than
sixty days.
The fastest sailing trip on record from
Newcastle to San Francisco is forty-four
days, made by ttie English bark Win
hover. The longest passage is 126 days
and was made by the En.-lish ship Lord
Canning. It once took the Am ncau
bark J. D. Peters 1:24 days to make the pas
sage and tne English ship Hahneman
was out 115 days before she came into this
port.
The Swanhilda is a fine, long, four
inast bark, and on her last trip from New
castle came up in fifty-eight days. It is
known, however, lhat the Swanhilda is
now very foul with grass and barnacles.
This condition makes a very considerable
difference in her speed. On her recent
passage from Cane Town, South Africa,
she was fifty days in sailing the course
usually covered in thirty-five or forty.
The bottom had become foul after a thrte
months' stay at Cape Town, and it has
not been scraped since.
The brisk southeast winrt that has been
blowing ior several days off the coast may
be expected to bring the Swauhilda into
port any time now, if she be reasonably
near here. But for all that has been seen
by any of the ships that have arrived
already the Swanhiida may be very far
away, the victim of contrary winds or of
calms.

There was another Swanhilda scare on
the front yesterday. It was very bHzy
outside, and the lookout at Point Lobos
could not make out the vessels in sight.
A "square rigger" was reported and in a
moment everybody was on the gui vive.
The detectives got ready and Sergeant
Bunner had the police boat swung out and
all were ready for active service. After a
couple of hours of delay the vessel was
finally made out to be the William F.
iJabcock from New York. The run was
made in the good time of 138 days. Heavy
weather was encountered off Cape Horn,
but the passage from fifty to fifty was
nevertheless accomplished in twelve days.
Off the Pacific Coast heavy westerly gales
were experienced and the pilot had con
siderable trouble in getting aboard. Can
tain Graham of the Babcock and Captain
Freeman, who brought the vessel in, both
say that very heavy weather prevails out
side. It is a fair wind for the Swanhilda,
however, and the pilots who go out in the
Bonita to-night are confident of capturing
the prize. Captain Graham of the Babcock
is one of the best known and best liked
masters that comes to San Francisco.
The following information has just been
received from the Hydrograpbic Office at
Washington, D. C:
Along the south side of that portion of the
ocean east oi the Hawaiian Islands the trade
winds may be expected to blow with a de
cided northerly slant, while to the westward
of them the trades may be expected to be gen
erally eHSterly or east-northeasterly. During
February the belt of calms and variables be
tween the trades may be expected to be nar
row â so narrow in some places that a vessel
may pass from one trade wind into the other
without any perceptible break.
Typhoons are unusual during February.
The northeast monsoon on the coast of China
blows s.eadily during this month.
Occasional fog will be found along the

W. Thompson, or. as he is known from
one end of ibe water front to the other,
"British Bill," is prostrated with grief
and yet he is the envy of th? entire neigh
borhood. His wife is slowly but surely
dying and that is what is causing him
sorrow "because." said Bill yeaterday,
"she was the best wife a man ever had.
Hundreds of times when I have gone off
on a spree she would brace me up and
bring me around into working shape
again."
What excites the envy of the neighbor
hood is the fact that during the thirty-six
years Mrs. Thompson has been in" tne
sailor boarding-house business with her
husband she has amassed a fortunes of
about $25,000 unknown to him. "The
only person who knew anything about it
was Mrs. Lane (the wife of another board
ing-master)," said Thompson. "My wife
told her some time ago that she had been
saving up money since IS6I and that she
hoped she would die first so that I could
have the use of it after she was cone."
Some months ago Thompson joined the
Salvation Army, and a short time ago was
promoted to be a sergeant. Knowing that
she was dying, she informed her husband
of the little nestegg she had been saving
up for him and siened her passbook over
to him.
There was a short but lively session of
the Harbor Commissioners yesterday.
Three sweepers, Frank C. O'Neil, P. W.
Winkiey and J. T. Bloomer, were dis
charged, and Foreman of Sweepers
Thomas Kane had to be protected from
the:r vengance by Sergeant Hayes.
Wednesday was a wet day, and the men
took more liquor than was good for them,
and Kane brought them to account. The
men got anerrv and one of them struck the
old man. They then seized him and
rushed him up to the Chief Wharfinger's
office, where they demanded that he be
dismissed.
Chief Wharfinger Root told the men to
go to work and make their complaint next
day. They got abusive and he at once
suspended tnem. Before their sentence
of dismissal was passed Sergeant Hayes
was telephoned for and he was instructed
to take Kane under his charge.
The yacht Idier, from which J. C. Wil
son Jr. was drowned some time ano, will
go to Honolulu. After the sad occurrence
Ihe little vessel was sold to the Naval
Battalion and her name was changed to
Natalie. Her new owners soon tired of
her and she again changed hands. She is
now being fitted out for an ocean voyage.
It is expected that as she is a handsome
and speedy craft a good price will be ob
tained for her at the islands.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
steamer Golden Gate will be launched
from Hay & Wright's yard, Alameda
Point, to-morrow. The Golden Gate has
during the winter been lengthened 25 feet
and raided 2 feet, which gives her a water
line of 105 feet ana a good freeboard, mak
ing her one of the finest cannery steam
tenders sailing out of San Francisco.
Special attention has been given to her
crew accommodations, which gives them
large and comfortable apartments. Her
new enginesâ llx24, 18-inch stroke â will
give her a spsed of 9>Â£ knots per hour.
Her reconstruction has been under the
direct supervision of Captain 0. J.
Humphrey of the whaling company. The
Golden Gate sails for Alaska the middle
of March, where she will be employed as a
tender to Qne or more of the company's
cann pries. Captain S. F. Snow goe3 out
in the Golden Gate in commend.
The wife of Captain A. C. Sherman, the
well-known whaling man, died in Ala
meda yesterday of typhoid fever. Her
little dauahter, Helen Kerschel Sherman,
the first white child ev-r born in the Arc
tic Circle, had been very sick with the
disease, and the mother nursed her
through it only to succumb herself. Cap
tain Sherman will go out next season on
the Orca, but will leave his children at
home.
A Barbers' Ma*iÂ«-9leeting.
The Journeymen Barbers' Union will hold a
mass-meeting next Sunday afternoon at 102
O'Farrell street. The purpose is to discuss
the bill the barbers of the State have now be
fore the Legislature. The proposed law is
similar to that under which dentists practice.
It provides thai none but competent barbers
shall follow the trade, and that all must be
examined as to their qualifications beiore a
competent board. Apprentices must f-erve a
stated time before they can secure a license ta
practice. If tne bill passes it Mill kill the so
called barber's colleges, wtere face-scrnpers
are turned out by the dozens after a few days'
or weeks' tuition.
PORTLAND'S CLUB
LOST GOOD MONEY
Brown of the Multnomahs
Went Down Before
Kreling.
A Grand Night's Wrestling
Tournament in the Olympic
Gymnasium.
The Directors Cut D^wn the Salaries
of Their Employes Ten
Per Cnt.
"Notwithstanding the heavy rainstorm,
which was at its bast about 8 o'clock last
evening, the ladies and their escorts
poured into the Olympic Club as thick as
drops fell on the street without.
It was wrestling night and the announce
ment that a special match between the
champion lightweight of the Multnomah
Athletic Club of Portland, Or., and the
champion of the Olympic Club would
take place attracted a large gathering.
The storm could not keep the ladies
away.
In the feather-weight class, 125 pounds
and under, F. Butler of the Olympic Club,
H. Gelaer of the Oakland Athletic Club,
F. Haustren of the Eintracht Athletic
Club and J. Meagles of the Columbia
Athletic Club contested. Gelder defeated
Butler, Haustren defeated Meagles, and in
the final bout Gelder ciefeatad Haustren
and won first prize.
m the lightweight contests H. M.
Platt of the Reliance Club defeated F.
Eckhardtof the Olympic; L. Mamlock,
Columbia Athletic Ciub, defeated J. J.
Phillips, Olympic, and F. G. Ely, Olym
pic, defeated E. F. Empey, Olympic.* In
the second ruund Platt defeated Mamlock
and Ely wrestled Mamlock a bye. Ely
and Plait met in the final and Plate won
first prize.
Eckhardt is anxious to meet Platt in
any ciub in a special match, best two out
of three, as no considers that he did not
pet a fair show last evening.
Wei ter- weight division â G. Ecklardt,
O. 0.. defeated JM. E. Smith, O. C. ; F. G.
Ely. O. C, defeated J. J. Conlon, C. A. C.
In the second and final round Eckhardt
defeated Ely for first place.
Middle- weight?â F. Hoffman of the San
Francisco Turn Vereins defeated Charles
Peterson of the C. A. C, and D. Mahoney,
O. C, defeated R. B. Cornell, 0. C. In the
final Hoffman easily disposed of Mahoney,
proving beyond a doubt that he is a very
ciever wrestler.
Heavy- weightsâ G. Hiiderbrant, O. C,
defeated Charles Peterson. C. A. C. ; R.
B. Cornel!, O. C, defeated D. Marione, O.
C. Cornell, Mahoney and Peterson
wrestled also in the middle and heavy
weight divisions. In the second and final
bout Hiiderbrant defeated Cornell be
cause oi his advantage in size and weight,
which handicapped Cornell. Doubtless
Hoffman would have won the first Drize
liua he been a contestant, as he was by
long odds tbe better wrestler.
Tue event of the evening was the special
match between H. Brown, a past director
of the Multnomah Athletic Ciub of Port
land, Or., and C. F. Kreling of the Olym
pic Club, who holds the lightweight
championship. Great interest was mani
fested in this contest, as the athletes of
the Multnomah Club were sanguine that
their representative would easily defeat
the Olympic lad.
Yesterday a prominent member of the
Olympic Club received an order to place
$700 on Brown at even money and long
before the wrestlers made their appear
ance on the carpet the coin was covered.
Brown holds the Northwest record for
pole-vaulting, having cleared 10 feet 1
inch. It is said that Brown taught Green
land â the athlete who received a decision
over Kreling in Portland last year be
cause of the ignorance of the referee â all
that the northern champion knows of
catch-as-catch-can style of wrestling.
Because Greenland defeated Kreling the
Portlanders were certain that Brown
would easily throw Kreling and they
wagered their money accordingly.
Brown has been a resident of this City
for a year, during which time be has b en
in the employ of Palmer & Rey as fore
man oi the firm's type foundry." He has
trained four weeks for the contest and ap
peared in first-class condition lust evening
when he faced hisopponent on the mat.
Referee Eugene Van Court of the Re
liance Athletic Club ordered the wrestlers
into action at 9 p. m. |They were given
half an hour in which to gain a fall.
Brown started in to finish bis opponent in
quick order, and after some hot prelimi
nary work he got a leglock on Kreling
and brought him to the carpet. Brown
tried several neck and arm locks, all of
which Kreling broke. Then Kreling by a
quick movement got a hammer luck on
Brown's left arm, which the latter broke
after a hard strain.
Kreling soon had him again in a tight
place by a neck and arm bold and Brown's
shoulders almost touched the carpet, but
by a great display of strength he manaetd
to turn and breas the hold. Brown then
attempted to get on his pins, but he was
Quickly caupht in an arm hold, which
Kreling suddenly changed to a neck 'iold,
and then by a roll he put Brown on his
back with both shoulders on the mat. The
result was signaled by great cheering.
When the men appeared for the second
bout, a â¢ tne match was best two out of
three fails. Brown wore a very determined
look and the spectators expected to see
Â»ome extra lively wrestling, but the ex-
Portland champion, so. to apeak, was not
in it with the Olympic boy, who appeared
as cool as a cucumber ana proved that he
kriew a thing or two about the game.
Brown started in well and soon had bis
opponent on the carpet by a neck hold
and a throw, but Kreling* was at home
when on all-fours and soon had Brown
guessing.
The Portland lad fell into a trap in
stantly, and by an arm and neck hold
Kreling had Brown with both shoulders
almost touching, but the latter broke the
hold by another great display of strength.
After considerable give-and-take work
Brown made an attempt to roll Kreling,
when the latter countered and, with a
half-hammer lock, Kreling brought Brown
half way over. Kreling then changed to
a half Nelson, wnich Brown broKe, but
before he knew where he was at Kreling
had him again on his right shoulder, with
a leg ana arm lock, which Kreling quickly
changed to a leg pinch, out of which
Brown could not possibly extricate him
self.
The match was won by Kreling â Time
of tirst fall, 5 mm. 4 Bee. ; time ot second
fall, 8 mm. 15JÂ£ sec. Possibly the Mult
nomah Club may now give Krelins a
return match with Greenland, their home
champion.
The directors of the Olympic Club met
last evening in session and decided to cut
the salaries of all the employes 10 per
cent, which means a saving of about $200
per month to the club. Peter Mclntyre
was engaged to look after the outdoor
grounds for two months at a salary of
$40 per month.
A bigprofessional boxing carnival is now
contemplated, to be held at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Resolutions for Keform.
The Merchants' Association has embodied
in a neat pamphlet the resolutions adopted at
its last quarterly meeting, requesting the
Legislature to take cognizance ot the need of
legislation on civil service and primary elec
tions aud amendments to the laws now bear
ing on streets and Freeholders' charters. The
pamphlet will be extensively circulated
amonff the members of both the Senate and
Assembly.
Improving Fair KÂ«tute Property.
Judge Slack has signed an order permitting
the executors of the will of James G. Fair,
deceased, to erect a two-story building on
Sacramento street, between Davis and Front,
at a cost not to exceed $20,000. B. F. Barton
Has leased one of the stores in the proposed
building for a term of five years at $100 a
month.

Amelia Emily Smith Irom J. Smith, on the
ground of willful neglect; Victoria R. Leve
roni from Roland Leveroni, for desertion;
Bertha F. Handle from Harry Randle, for fail
ure to provide. The plaintiff is allowed to re

THE CALL SPeAKS FOR ALL.
The fake journalist will now go slow for
a little while.
When you read it in The Call you know
it Isn't a fake.
A free market we need and a free market
vre must have.
Millions for fakes and not a cent for
news is a poor motto.
Nevada may secure the big prise-fight,
but there will be no Arizona referee.
Stopping firecrackers in Chinatown is
good, but stopping highbinders would be
better.
It will be observed that the Examiner't
Chinese dispatch miil has stopped
working.
Perhaps Long Green Lawrence would
rather be known as a faker than as what
he really is.
Eastern charity is still tussling with the
Eastern blizzard and keeping itself warm
by wholesome exercise.
What does it profit a reader to get stuff
by fakelectrophone from China when he
doesn't even get straight news from Stock
ton street ?
The speeches for free Cuba at Sacra
mento did not hurt the Spaniards, but
they killed time and warmed the blood of
the orators.
It begins to look as if ihe Duckworth
inquiry will drag itself along until it has
made the people tired and then crawl
into a hole.
Princess Chimay is reported to have left
her gypsy, and the next stage in her
career will probably be theatrical in name
as well as effect.
The State Department is to go to Ohio
and the Treaanry Department to go to
Illinois. It is now time lor Major Mc-
Kinley to look west.
Little Pete's life was bad, but there is a
chance his death may have a good effect.
Public opinion is now ready for resolute
action against the highbinders.
The lext step in Willie Hearst's career
from affluent to penury will be to call up
ihe Emperor of China by telephone and
ask him where Li Yung Yuen is.
The fact that Melba's voice has suffered
from singing Wagner's music is not con
clusive as to the effects of the music. We
â would like to have Mr. Bryan try it.
Adulterated food, substitutes for estab
lished articles of beneficial use and fake
newspapers are three things to be avoid
ed. A word to the wise is sufficient
We were not aware that the immigra
tion bill is very hot stuff, but Congress
man Walker said it makes his blood boil,
and Mr. Walker is from Massachusetts.
The juveniie attaches of the State Legis
lature are said to have organized a social
club, and when not dancing attendance
on business will be in attendance at a
dance elsewhere.
The missing furniture of the committee
rooms has been found in other offices of
the State Capitol, so the members of the
last Legislature who were accused of
pocketing it are acquitted.
Once more we are assured that the new
tariff bill will be reported early at the
coming extra session and will be promptly
adopted. Even the Senate, it is said, has
made up ics mind to attend to business.
We do not like to pour vinegar into
open wounds, but really the purchase of
a fake story from the Emperor of China
to Li Yung Yuen, who isn't in town, by a
man who pretends to run a newspaper
was funny.
Senator Voorheis of the Finance Com
mittee reports that bills already introduced
into the State Senate call for appropria
tions of more than $3,242,000. Fortunately
there is a wastebasket handy to drop
most of them into.
Senator Sherman's determination not
to resign his seat in the Senate until he
has been confirmed as Secretary of State
has the advantage of securing him a
chance to vote for his confirmation and
debating it if necessary.
If Long Green Lawrence really thought
that Chinese story was true when he paid
Willie Hearst's money for it he is not to
be blamed for the fake, but really he ought
to cultivate a sense of the ridiculous and
learn to know absurdity when he sees it.
Senator Sherman's statements concern
ing tbe Nicaragua canal are encouraging.
He declared in the Senate on Wednesday
that the canal should be constructed by
the United States, and that a treaty should
be made with Nicaragua for that purpose.
That is the kind of talk we are pleased
with from the next Secretary of State.
The fake journal gave the public an
other example yesterday of its fraudulent
news service. In the first column of the
first pajte it puDlished an alleged dispatch
dated Washington, January 27. and
marked "special cable to the Examiner."
Legitimate news comes from Washington
by wire across the continent. When a
s-tory is asserted to have been sent from
that city to San Francisco by cable across
the ocean it may be known as a fake, and
'it is s ardly necessary for the Examiner
to reiterate the statement and add that it
â¢ was absolutely tine."
KINDRED EVILS.
The American people are at thi3 time
engaged in efforts to suppress three evils
of a kindred nature, each being so insidi
ous in its character as to be almost able to
defy suppression by law, and at the same
time so injnrious in its effect as to require
constant vigilance on the part of the
intelligent portion of the public to prevent
it from becoming a serious menace to the
welfare of the credulous and unsuspecting.
Boards of Health are trying to suppress
the adulteration of food, the owners of
legitimate patented articles are endeavor
ing to prevent tricky dealers from substi
tuting inferior articles in place of the
goods which the purchaser calls for, and
legitimate journals are trying to crush out
of the country that false Peter Fuak sys
tem of running newspapers which prom
ises the people news and gives theÂ» fakes
and freaks instead of genuine reports of
the event* of the day.
These evils are of a kindred nature inas
much as all of them partake of the char
acter of petty swindling. The man who
sells cotton-seed oil for olive oil, and glu
cose compounds for fruit preserves is not t s
sentially different from him who sells some
worthless nostrum in place of a specific
of established repute, or the journalist
who concocts fakes in his private office
and sells them to his readers under the
title of diapatches from China. Neither
is any one of the three widely different
from the gold brick swindler or any other
man who relies upon his canning to obtain
money under false pretenses.
Since the beginning of society there
have always been men who pride them
selves on living by their wits instead of
by their industry, but fortunately, despite
their boasting.they have been invariably as
devoid of wit as of energy. Their schemes
sooner or later are always exposed, and
their wits do not serve to keep them from
an eventual penury or the penitentiary.
The enactment of laws against these
offenses serves a good purpose, but is not
sufficient to guard the people against the
injurious effects of the {â¢eif-styled witty
fellows. Adulterated foods are always
for sale, inferior articles are always being
substituted for good ones and fakes con
tinue to be offered for news. The only
safeguard for the citizen is in his own in
telligence and the exercise of a constant
vigilance against the sharpers. Under
these circumstances it is the duty of those
who see the evil to expose it. This work
is in a particular sense incumbent upon
the press since it is looked to by the
people to furnish news of what is good
and warning against what is vicious.
The Call in the performance of the
duty due to the public from legitimate
journalism has endeavored to expose each
of these kind of fakers. We have given
space in our columns of late to reports of
discoveries made by the Board of Health
of the sale of adulterated food in this City,
we have called attention to the evil prac
tice of substituting cheap articles in place
of those of established merit, and we have
exposed the fraud of the Examiner in
palming off upon its readers a fake dis
patch from China. This much we have
done to warn the public. It now remains
for the intelligence of the people to act
upon the warning and to protect theni
seive3 Irom the schemes of the fellows
who live by their wits.
THE MICAEAGUA CANAL.
Statements made by Senator Sherman
in discussing the Nicaragua canal bill on
Wednesday are in the highest degree en
couraging to the advocates of that meas
ure. As it is known that the Senator is
to be Secretary of State in the next ad
ministration his words may be regarded
as a declaration of what w:ll be under
taken by President McKinley, and they
give assurance thereiore that the measure
which now seems to be checked will be
carried forward under a new form to com
plete success.
Senator Sherman is reported to have de
clared that he believes the only means
of building the Nicaragua canal is
through the power of the United States.
He expressed the opinion that no private
canal company could carry out the project
and that it should be undertaken by our
Government directly. He went on to say
he would vote for the bill in any form in
which it might be presented, but be
thought the better way would be to allow
the matter tp rest until a new treaty could
be made with the Nicaraguan Govern
ment.
The statement as reported is certainly
explicit enough to give satisfaction to the
advocates of the measure. As Secretary
of State Senator Sherman will himself
have charge of negotiating the treaty for
the construction of the canal, and his
words are a distinct promise that he will
do all in his power to promote the great
enterprise. There is moreover a degree
of satisfaction to be found in his declara
tion that the canal should be constructed
by the Government for the people, and
not for a private corporation. Much of
the objection to the present Dill has been
founded upon the belief that it granted
too much favor to the canal company,
and this objection will of course be re
moved by the adoption of the policy sug
gested.
There can be no question that the great
est opportunity which will open before the
Secretary of State of the new administra
tion on entering office will ba that of ar
ranging such a treaty as has been out
lined. The construction of the Nicaragua
canal is just now the most important en
terprise which engages the attention of
the world. It means a virtual revolution
in the commerce of the earth. Its ad
vantages to every nation will be great, and
its benefits to the United States will be
too vast to be calculated. The Secretary
of State who perfects a treaty which pro
vides for the construction of the canal,
and the President under whose direction
the great work is carried out, can count
upou holding a high place in the scroll
which contains the names of the great
statesmen of America who have promoted
the welfare of the country, not tempor
arily, but for all time.
IMMIGRATION BILL.
The passage by the House of the immi
gration bill reported by the conference
committee gives promise that this im
portant piece of legislation will be enacted
during the present session of Congress.
The amendments made in the bill, as or
iginally reported, are of comparatively
little importance, and it is reasonable to
conclude that tbe Senate will agree with
the House in adopting the measure, and
will promptly pass it.
The bill does not go so far as iome ex
treme advocates of restriction would have
desired, but it is a marked improvement
on the existing law. It will tend to pro
tect American labor from the competition
of cheap laborers from abroad, and also to
secure American society irom tue per
nicious influence of aliens who bave no
understanding either of our laws, our cus
toms or our aspirations. It will check, to
some extent, the incoming horde of immi
grants, and if found by experience to be
insufficient, can be easily made more ex
tensive and more restrictive in the future.
It is singular that the chief objector to
the educational test in the bill was a Con
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 1897.
pressman from Massachusetts. It has
been generally supposed that the people
of that State were in favor of education as
a test not merely for foreigners coming
into the country, but even for American
born who desired to exercise the right ot
suffrage. Mr. Walker of Massachusetts,
however, declared that the bill made his
"blood boil" because it would exclude
from America honest farmers and worK
ingmen who cannot read while opening
the doors to nihilists and anarchists who
possess that accomplishment.
The objection thus made to the bill is
not valid. We have laws already against
anarchist" and men of the criminal class.
What is needed now is a bill which will
shut out from the couutry those who are
not only ignorant, but are so devoid of
worthy ambition as to neglect to educate
themselves even in the language of their
own country.
Bo fsr as it goes the bill is good enough.
The people desire to see it enacted with
out further delay. Such defects as may
be discovered in it may be remedied here
after. The point at issue now is to restrict
immigration as far as possible at once.
The revival of industry in this country
will bring hordes of cheap European la
borers to this country to compete with
our workingmen if they are not checked
by the passage of this law. It will not do
all, but it will do much, and for that rea
son it should be regarded by Congress as
a measure of urgency and promptly
adopted.
THE COMING ISSUE.
In an eloquent address before the Illi
nois Legislature Mr. Mason, the newly
elected United Btate3 Senator, won ap
plause from the Republicans by pledging
his devotion to the great measures of pro
tection, reciprocity and sound money; bnt
when he spoke of trusts and corporations
he was greeted with acclamations in
which men of all parties joined. It is
evident, therefore, that ho spoke the uni
versal sentiment of the Legislature on that
subject and may claim with justice to be
in that respect * representative of all
Illinois.
The passage in his speech which won
this unanimous approval is thus reported:
I want to say one word upon the subject of
trusts. The constant struggle of corporations
against competition has for a long time, and
will for many years to come, furnish food lor
thoughtful minds. The trusts produce cheaper
because they produce more; but the great
trouble has been that the cheapening of the
cost of production has inured to the benefit of
the few, whi.a the consumer has been de
prived of tlie benefits that justly should have
mllen to his lot. I shall, on behalf of the peo
ple of Illinois, favor additional legislation, if
necessary, and the enforcement of the laws
a. ready passed by our party, to the end that
when competition is destroyed the saving in
the cost of production shall go to the pockets
of the p'.aia people, who consume, and not to
the pockets of the few, who grow rich by rea
son of their combinations and trusts.
It is not in Illinois only that these
words will meet with commendation. In
Congress and in all the State Legislatures
there have been repeated efforts made to
restrict trusts and corporations to a
greater or less extent. Public sentiment
is everywhere ready to support almost
any well-directed movement in that direc
tion, and all signs point to the conclusion
that when the tariff and the currency
have been properly settled the next great
issue to be taken up in our politics will
be that of regulating corporate activities
and preventing th 3 injurious effects of
trust monopolies.
It does not follow that because there is
a unanimous sentiment in favor of placing
some limit upon the activities of these
mighty organizations of trade and in
dustry that there will be anything like
unanimity in fixing the limits or in devis
ing the law for maintaining them. When
the issue comes up for linal settlement
people will divide on it, as they are di
vided on the money question, into con
servatives and radicals. There will be
party differences on this question, as on
all others, and there will be no longer
universal acclamations for any orator, no
matter which side he takes or how elo
quently he speak 3.
What has been done so far to regulate
trusts and monopolies has been ineffective
and futile. The trusts that have cone to
pieces tiave failed from inherent defects
rather than from the force of statutes de
claring them illegal. We have been, as it
were, experimenting with the task before
us. The genuine life or death grapple
with it is to come later. When it will
occur cannot be predicted. It is signifi
cant, however, that one of the youngest,
ablest and most forceful of the new men
who will enter the Senate in March has
declared himself in favor of meeting the
issue at once and meeting it boldly.

"BILLY" MASON'S FINE HOUSE.
Washington Post.
An Illinois member of Congress had dined
with "Billy" Mason in Chicago. They had
talked of the desire of Mr. Mason to come to
the Senate, and admired the beautiful house
in which be lives, had even inspected the
tiled glories of the bathroom, and then, smok
ing an afternoon cigar, the two friends waited
downtown together. When they were some
distance from the house the Congressman
turned and looked back at the large and bril
liantly lighted dwelling.
"You have a beautiiul home," said the Con-
gressman.
"Yes," replied Mason, with a sound that was
between a laugh and a sigh, "but 1 can hear
that house drawing interest two squares
away."

But there Is at least one instance In the great West which seems to afford an example of

THE RICH SHOULD NOT ECONOMIZE

The greatest injury that can be done to the
prosperity of a community comes from the
enforced or voluntary economy on the part of
society. If every family in New York should
begin to-day to cut down its expenditures by
a small fraction only the sum of the loss to
trade and lnbor would be so vast that it would
bring disaster to business and industry gen

would be an appalling increase in "poverty

sands of men and women would be deprived

with the "matrices" of the leading newspapers
of the countryâ that is, the pulp impressiong
from which the page is stereotyped.
"They described San Francisco to me as the
Paris of America and I think the description
fits exactly. I brought a box full of letters of
introduction to people here, but they are still
in the box," he said. "I didn't use 'em. The
people seem to be all made of such original
stuff that formalities are out of place. I've
been shown everything, and among others I
might say that the Olympic Club Is a big card
for the City. That salt water is great stuff.
In Chicago we have a fine athletic club, but
the only things that go with it free to the
members are admission and ice water. Every
thing else is charged for extra."
But even with this handicap added to its
eccentric climate Mr. Hunter does not go back
on Chicago altogether.
"They say that we have taken into the city
limits all the farming country of the State,
but that is not literally true," he said. "We
have a street that is twenty-five miles long,
built up for the whole distanceâ Halstead
street. We have three distinct cities in the
three divisions. The North Side Is the Boston
of Chicago. There are the libraries and the
culture. The South Side is the New York. It
is the mercantile and money center. The
West Side is cosmopolitan Chicago itself."
Speaking of the big weeklies he represents,
Mr. Hunter said: "They were started by W.
D. Boyce some ten years ago. Mr. Boyce had
been a publisher of patent lnsides, and in
spite of the fight made agalnit him by Kellogg
and others, he became such a competitor that
they finally bought him out for $70,000. Mr.
Boyce then, with three others, started the
Chicago Blade. They undertook to make the
paper go on its merits without advertising.
Boyce sunk his $70,000, and when the paper
was $15,000 in debt he bought out two of his
partners for $100 each. He kept at it, work
ing all sorts of schemes to get a circulation,
and at last it began to go, and has continued
to do so with marvelous rapidity. The W. D.
Boyce Company was formed, and the Chicago
Leager and af teTward the World were started.
We paid Uncle Sam for postage last year on
the three pap ira at 1 cent a pound $27,000.
We paid fully as much more on circulars to
our agents.']
HOW HEARST IS RUINING
PULITZER.
New York Press.
"Willie" Hearst Is discovering that tbere
are wicked thorns in the path of a bumptious
young man who comes from the West to scalp
New York and gets skinned alive. On the ro
mantic stage the people who were pulling his
leg would call him an "angel." In the brutal
new journalism they call him a "sucker." He
is fair game for everybody, and everybody
plugs away at him. Anybody can sell any
thing to him by telling him that some other
paper wants it. When a man wants an in
crease of salary he tells the California come-on
that Pulitzer has offered him more money
than Hearst Is giving him. Hearst goes wild
at the thought that Pulitzer is trying to get
his men away from him, doubles the chap's
salary and thinks he is ruining Pulitzer,
Hearst was paying one of his artists a hun
dred dollars a week, when some of the World
people put up a job on htm. They told the ar
tist the World would like to have his services
at $150 a week. The artist told Hearst, and
willing Willie raising him to $200. Then the
World raircd to $223, and Willie, in a panic,
raised to $250 and promised the artist a trip
to Europe. That is the way the World helpa
Hearst spend his money, and Willie is tickled
to death, thinking Pulitzer is the victim.
You could sell Hearst a yellow dog for a
thousand dollars if you told him Pulitzner
had offered you nine hundred tor it. Every
body knows this, and every day a lot of gold
bricks are offered to him, which take a large
slice of the fortune his father made In silver
mines.
"Willie has been trying to buy a paper in
Chicago to save freight on the free copies of
his Sew York paper that he sends out West.
He hasn't succeeded in getting the Chicago
paper yet, because the shrewd Westerners are
bidding him up just the way the World people
bid up his artist. Willie has found no lack of
helping hands eager to assist him in scatter
ing his trailer's millions.
The funny thing about Hearst is that he
came here to teach new journalism 10 Pu
litzer, and that after dropping two millions
he is trotting along admiringly behind Pu
litzer, as if he had been trained to it all his
life- If the World comes out tor a beer tax on
Monday, Willie follows him f<sr a beer tax on
Tuesday. It's the same way with trusts, po
lice abuses, special commissioners, baby shows,
and everything elÂ«e. Willie has become a
crazy free-trader now. If Pulitzer should ad
vocate an American emperor Willie would
say amen. And his leg-pullers would male
him believe that was the way to put another
nail in Pulitzer's coffin.
Every week Willie pours a barrel of silver
into his paper. He draws large checks for
contributions rejected by the World, employs
the World's discharged men at liptop salaries,
and, as a result, expects every day to see the
dome of the Pulitzer building fall into Park
row. The Journal's free campaign fifty-cent-
on-the-doilar circulation slips over into tha
World office day by day, but that doesn't make
any difference. Willie buys everything that
the World won't have, and smiles beautifully
when his people tell him that "Pulitzer ia
doomed."
While Willie is "ruining Pulitzer," the wily
Joseph helps Willie spend a little more of the
silver of his late papa each week, and while
Pulitzer chalks up his circulation Willie looks
at the stubs of a hundred check-books and
gloats over the tall of Pulitzer. If Willie were
a heavy-weight there would be a terrific crash
some day, though not of the gilded dome; but
the passing when Pulitzer has done with the
innocent Willie will probably be like the pop
ping of a little red balloon.

AMERICAN AID
FOR THE HINDOO
San Francisco Will Re
spond to England's
Appeal.
The Executive Committee of
Fiity Appointed by Mayor
Pheian.
Expressions of Deep Sympathy at
Yesterday's Mass-MeetingâTele
grams Received.
â  The mass-meeting convened yesterday
afternoon in the Chamber of Commerce
hall for the purpose of devising means for
the relief of the famine-stricken districts
of India was but sparsely attended,
though those present were fully entitled
to represent the most important interests
of San Francisco. The result of a brief
and amicable debate was the adoption of
a motion which empowered Mayor
Pheian to appoint a committee of ways
and means to consist of fifty members for
the purpose of determining the nature of
ths assistance to be afforded, together
with the arrangement of all other details
reiutive to the same.
Mayor Phelan having been introduced
as the chairman of the meeting by Presi
dent Craig of the Chamber of Commerce
said that the failure of the crops in India
had resulted in widespr ead famine to
which the bubonic plague had afterward
added its horrors. The distress was genu
ine and had assumed such proportions
that the English Government could not
cope with it. "The magnitude of the
calamity is such," continued Mayor
Phelan, "that the sympathy of the whole
world has been enlisted in that behalf."
He added that be had acted after consul
tation with I. J. Truman, president of the
Civic Federation and the Columbian
Banking Company, who had agreed to
make arrangements for the receipt of do
nations and their transmission to the
afflicted districts.
Telegrams had been received from the
chairman of the committee caring for the
distressed in India and from the Lord
Mayor of London, which afforded authen
tic evidence of the real condition of
affairs and the present need of relief.
With these facts before them he thought
the people of San Francisco could not but
respond to the call made.
The secretary, Captain W. L. Merry,
then read the following telegram received
from Sir Francis Maclean, Chief Justice
of Bengal and chairman of the relief com
mittee at Calcutta:
Xew York, Jan. 26, 1897.
Hon. Jamet D. Phelan, Mayor San Francisco,
CaL: Central committee Indian famine lund,
Calcutta, earnestly solicit your cordial co
operation, highest possible scope private be
nevolence outside State relief system. Area,
numbers affected, enormous. Distress rapidly
increasing. Feel sure unavoidable privations
millions industrious poor will arouse pro-
Jound sympathy of all classes, all nations.
Committee makes urgent appeal to you to or
ganize relief fund. Will be grateful contribu
tions which will be public'.y acknowledged.
Sic FbanciÃ Maclean,
Chief Justice Bengal and Chairman Com
mittee, Calcutta.
A second important cable message, ad
dressed to the public, was received from
the Lord Mayor of London, stating that
he will accept aid from the public of
America with'profound gratitude, and will
ask the roj'al family to contribute to the
fund.
Archbishop Riordan wrote expressing
regret that illness prevented his attend
ance and ndding that the object of the
meeting nad his warmest sympathy aud
heartiest support.
Later iv the afternoon additional mess
ages were read from the Governors of
Nebraska, lowa, Oregon and Washington
proferring assistance in tho shape of food
stuffs.
The Right Rev. Bishop Nicbolls was
then requested by the chairman to address
the meeting. He said that the truest
recognition of the present necessity would
be in the shafce of names written at the
bottom of checks and by committees
promptly proceeding to materialize as
sistance. Modern civilization had tended
in a good many ways toward India.
Columbus started out for that country
and was surprised when his prows ran
against this continent of ours.
Key. Dr. Stebbins briefly described the
seriousness of the twofold calamity with
which India has been visited. The Eng
lish Government was deeply impressed by
this calamity, and had aheady remitted
to the afflicted country the sum of a mil
lion pounds, or $5,000,000.
Before the question was put Rabbi
Voorsanger made a few remarks. It was
not necessary, he said, to ada anything to
the excellent words which had been ut
tered. He believed in the whdom and ex
pediency of attending to this matter at
once, and that the committee suggested
could take it in hand. "I believe," he
said, "that thr real test of the humanity
of the community does not come from the
checks of the wealthy, but from the mites
of the poor, and in addition to the com
mittee of ways and means I suggest that
the people of San Francisco should be put
completely in touch who this movement
through the agency of public subscription
lists, to be opened in the press of the City,
so that those who cannot be reached by
this committee may swell the fund with
contributions from the municipality at
large. I maxe this motion."
The original motion and the amend
ment were then carried, together with
that of Rabbi Voorsanger, to the effect
that the qnestion of opening public sub
scriptions be referred to the committee
and solicited through the newspapers.
On motion of Rabbi Voorsanger the
Mayor was appointed chairman of the
committee.
Professor Davidson alluded to the im
portance of transportation and of deciding
at an early date as to the nature ol the
relief to be afforded. He stated that
during his travels in India in 1874 the
rice was brought to Rangoon by steamers,
and hud to be carried by bullock-wagons
into the starving districts. Maize, or
Indian corn, so far as he could ascertain,
did not grow there.
President Craig suggested the advisa
bility of leaving these details to the com
mittee, and Bishop Nichols further
moved that the committee be empowered
to bring the matter before the congrega
tions of the City at an early date. The
motion was adopted and the meeting
adjourned.
The committee subsequently chosen by
Mayor Phelan is as follows, subject to
revision :

UNLAWFUL POKEB DEBT.
Judge Slack Decided That It Could Not
Be Collected in Court.
An interesting suit was called for trial
in Judge Slack's court yesterday. It was
an effort of A. It. Schafers to collect a
poker debt of $345 from 8. Atlell.
The claim was based on a note for the
amount regularly signed by Attell on the
Bth of October, 1895, and drawn in favor
of S. Hoffman.
Iv the answer of the defendant it was
alleged that the promissory note set forth
in the complaint was made and delivered
to the payee therein solely for and on ac
count of money won by said payee from
the defendant in a gambling transaction,
namely, in a game played with cards for
money, and that no other consideration
was given for the note.
The testimony of all the parties to the
litigation sustained this allegation and
Judge Slack at once gave judgment for
the defendant and directed that the plain
tiff pay the costs of court.
POLICE PENSION FUND ALL EIGHT
Judge Slack Say* That It Cnnnot Be
Declared Insolvent.
Judge Slack gave short shrift yesterday
to Counselor Clarke's petition to have the
police pension fund declared insolvent.
The matter came up on the demurrer of
the Commissioners having charge of the
fund, who alleged that the court had no
[From a photographic slide.]
right to consider the petition inasmuch as
the law does not grant the court jurisdic
tion over such organizations.
Deputy City and County Attorney Brc
becu represented the Police Commission
ers and argued in favor of the position
assumed by the demurrer.
Counselor Clarke made no direct reply in
regard to the question of jurisdiction, but
indulged in an oration touching the acts
of the Commissioners in paying out money
to J. F. Moran and others. In this he
ignored the claim of the Commissioners
that the money paid to Mora.n was for the
purpose of defending the suits instituted
against the fund by Mr. Clarke himself.
Judge Slack said it was clear that the
court had no jurisdiction of such a case,
and as it would be impossible to amend
the petition in a manner to bring it
within the provisions of the law the pro
ceedings were ordered dismissed.
GOOD WORK DONE.
Annual Meeting ot the German General
Benevolent Society and Election
of Officers.
The annual meeting of the German Gen
eral Benevolent Society was held last
night at Druids' Hall, Sutter street, and
there was a large attendance.
President Broemmel In hi* report stated
that the committee appointed at the last
quarterly meeting to consider the advisa
bility ot erecting a new hospital had come
to the conclusion that the present hospital
was amply sufficient for all requirements
for some years yet, and that it was not
necessary to erect a new building. It was
I recommended that the building fund,
i which during the past year had increased
to nearly $10,000, should be H3ed as a nu
cleus for the new building and to be added
to every year till the necessity fora new
building arose. The recommendation was

FUR SEALS OF
THE FAR NORTH
President Jordan Tells of
the "Sea Bears" of
Alaska.
Thousands of Pups Are Trampled
to Death by the Fight
ing Bulls.
How Scientists Stretched Forth Hu
mane Hands to Save Yonng Seals
From Death.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University delivered an interesting
illustrated lecture al Ooiden Gate Hall
last night on "The Fur Seal, or Sea Bear
of Alaska."
Before touching on the subject of seals
the speaker dwelt at some length on the
extent of Alaska and its picturesque won
ders. He showed views of sublime Mount
St. Elias, towering 20,000 feet above the
Arctic Ocean, described the marvelous
volcanoes and volcanic islands of the far
north, and tola of the wonderful rookeries
infested by thousands of seals. The talk
was interesting and informal throughout,
and the audience greatly enjoyed the photo
opticon views, which were unusually good.
The speaker pave a lncid account of the
expedition of Gerassim Pribilof, and in
cluded a brief history of the lur-seal
islands, which were bought from Russia
in 1868 and leased to the Alaska Commer
cial Company in 1870. He showed how
there has been a great decline of the herds,
owing 10 an indiscriminate killing.
One of the interesting fsatures of the
lecture was the educator's account of how
he and other scientific explorers went to
great pains to arrange many of the rook
eries so that the young pups will not be
killed during the lights of the bulls during
the coming season.
'"During the fighting season among the
bulls," said the speaker, "they trample
thousands of pups to death. On one bat
tleheld alone we counted 14,900 dead pups
that had been tramped upon by the an
pered bulls in their deadly combats. We
threw hundreds of big stones over the
rookery so that the pups will be protected
hereafter.''
In conclusion the lecturer said he hoped
for an amicable and honorable settlement
at an early date of the many vexatious
questions that have arisen between Great
Britain and this country on the seal ques
tion.
FOR HUSBAND AND FATHER.
Mary K. Hngarty and Her DaujhterSuo
the Southern Pacillc,
Delmas & Shortridge yesterday insti
tuted an action at law on behalf of Mrs.
Mary E. Hagarty and Mary Margaret
Hagarty, a minor, against the Southern
Pacific Company for $50,000 damages.
Mrs. Hagarty is the widow and Mary Mar
garet is the daughter of Henry Hagarty,
who was killed by an accident on the rail
road near Palo Alto on the 9th of last Oc
tober.
The complaint sets forth that on the
date mentioned Henry Hagarty was em
ployed by the company as a locomotive
engineer on an engine attached to a freight
train, and when the train was near the
station of Palo Alto, by reason of the
"negligence and defective manner in
which the track, sidings, switches and
ways of said railroad were constructed,"
and by reason of the negligence of the de
fendant, the engine was wrecked and
Hagarty was, without fault on his part, so
injured that ne died.
At the time of his death Mr. Hagarty
was 36 years of age and in the enjoyment
of perfect health. He was a railroad en
gineer by occupation, and nis services
were then, and for a long time prior
thereto, had been worth and he had been
actually receiving $125 a month.

tract.
A. J. Morrell, a cousin of Quackenbush,

General Changes in San

cific Road.
Superintendent Corballey's Res
ignation Accepted by the
Directors.
Dividend No. 4, cf $30,000, Was De
claredâNo Change in tha Train
Service.
A change in management h3s been
adopted for this year by the directors of
the San Francisco and North Pacific Rail
road. The directors met last Wednesday
afternoon. At that time there was the
first dull thud of the official ax and the
head of one of the most prominent officers
of the road rolled into the list of the un
employed. Official titles were metamor
phosed, being added to and subtracted
from, and more work was partialed out
among a decreased number of officials. It
is understood among the employes of the
railroad that the policy of retrenchment
is to be pursned farther and they do not
know exactly where they are at.
It is feared the guillotine will be run
along the main line and branches and
sidetracked to do some wore at way sta
tions and division points.
Superintendent W. G. Corballey is the
man who presented his resignation to
General Manager H. C. Whiting, and
through him to President A. W. Foster. It
followed the usual lcd-tape methods and
got finally before the board of directors,
where it was acted upon.
W. G. Corballey has been with the road
so long that he has almost grown gray in
its service. His connection with the sys
tem began as a peanut butcher. Next be
emerged into public view as a brakeman.
his next promotion brought him a train,
and the honors of superintendent of the
whole system were finally bestowed upon
him, which position he has held a number
of years. There is said to be not a man.
woman or child, a cross-tie or a fish-plate
from Tiburon to Ukiali that he does not
know.
The other changes are as follows:
In addition to his duties as president
President Foster was also made general
inanaeer. H. C. Whiting resigned as gen
eral manager and was appointed general
superintendent. The office of superin
tendent was abolished. Mr. Whiting's
headquarters will be at San Rafael or
Tiburon. F. K. Zook, chief engineer, has
been appointed assistant superintendent
in addition to his duties as civil engineer.
At the meeting the directors also de
clared dividend 4 of 60 cents per share, or
$30,000.
The official changes will not in the least
affect the operation of the road. President
Foster said, in fact, that it is the aim of
the company to improve the service. No
action was taken in regard to a reduction
in the price of commutation tickets.
A NEW LEADING LADY.
Miss Lorena Atwood to Temporarily
Replace Miss Victory Bateman at
the Grand.
The leading lady who temporarily re
places Miss Bateman at the Grand is Miss
Lorena Atwood, who is reported to be a
very clever young woman, and who has
held several responsible positions in East
ern companies. In private life this lady
is Mrs. Clarence Arper, who is well known
in local theatrical circles.
It has not yet been decided who will per
manently play leads at this theater, but
the management are in communication
with several, and will soon make known
their choice.

TWO BOARDS OF EDUCATION
CHARGED WITH EXTRAVAGANCE
Ex- President Hyde Accuses Them of Nepotism and
Gross Jobbery.
GRAVE CHARGES MADE.
He Says Buildings Are Repaired
and Places Made for Di
rectors' Relatives.
AUDITOR BRODEBICK SCORED.
The Ex-School Director Makes a Sweep
ing Accusation That Funds
Are Squandered.
The controversy between the chairman
of the Finance Committee of the present
Board of Education and the chairman of
the last board promises to assume far
wider proportions than either one im
agined at the outset. F. A. Hyde, ex
president of various boards of education,
has entered the arena to lodge grave accu
sations against the last two boards. He
makes specific cnarges of great extrava
gance and nepotism.
Mr. Hyde's contention is that the School
Directors have no power to divide the
school fund and that the Auditor has no
right to withhold the payment of any bills
approved by the Board of Education pro
vided the one-twelfth act is not violated.
Speafcmg of Mr. Hyde's allegations in
Thursday's Call Auditor Broderict said
last night:
"I am acting under legal advice, govern
ing myself by the statutes of 1871-72 and
of 1875-76. According to my attorney's
views I have a right to respect the con
tract for the Mission Hi?h School and to
refuse to touch any such funds as may
have been set aside for that purpose. Ido
not think Mr. Hyde's opinion worth any
tning, for he is away off on the facts and
the law."
Mr. Hyde, however, reiterates his accu
sations of extravagance and violation of
tae law.
"There is a striking object lesson in
what the Board of Education did last
night," said Mr. Hyde yesterday. "They
had hardly warmed their chairs until they
appointed an inspector for two years at
$200 a month to inspect â nothing. They
pretend that he is to inspect the Mission
iiigh School. Whenever there is anything
in sight to inspect it will be found that
the architect has been paid and hired to
do the inspecting. The truth is this is a
fat job for somebody's friend. This board
promised wonders in the way of economy.
What is it doing? It has dismissed no
body, cut short no expenses; but has be
gun to create fat places for its friends."
Continuing in the same strain Mr.
Hyde said:
The enormous increase in the expenses of
the department chargeable to tbe creation of
unnecessary positions and the employment of
unnecessary teachers is strikingly exemplified
in tbe estimate of expenditures presented last
evening to tbe Board of Education by the
chairman of the Finance Committee. He esti
mates tbat for the first six months of this year
the sum of $453,117 75 will be required for
teachers' salaries, which is at the rate of
$906,235 50 per annum. For the fiscal year
1893-94 tne total sum expended lor teachers'
salaries amounted to $814,110 39. For tbe
closing half year during the administration of
the same board the expenditure was Â§408,
--034 80.
This would show an average teacher's salary
list of about $815,000 per annum. Thus it
appears that the last Board of Education In
creased tne salary list alone about $90,000
per annum. While there has been a gradual
Increase in the expenses of the department
from 1884-85 to the piesent time no such re
markable increase in any one administration
bas heretofore been shown. The average
daily attendance of pupils in 1893-94 was about
83,000. This attendance has been increased
by about 1500. Such an attendance aa that,
scattered through the School Department,
would necessitate the employment of but few,
If any, additional teachers, for it never hap
pens tbat tie classes are full. In fact at a
time when the minimum number for one
class was placed at fifty the actual average
attendance was only about forty-three. If
every class in the department, however, had
been full, and it were necessary to employ
additional teachers for the 1500 additional
pupils, only thirty additional teachers would
have been required. As a matter of fact the
actual number required would be nearer five,
and yet there are in the department about
seventy-five teachers more than there were
three years ago.
The sentiment of the Supervisors and of '.he
people has been that $1,000,000 per annum
was enough to conduct the schools; and, out
of that, the Directors are obliged to appoi t.on
over $900,000 for salaries, leaving a litttw over
$90,000 per annum to pay all of the other
running expenses, out of which about $40,000
is disbursed for janitors and others receiving
fixed salaries.
Mr. Hyde's indictment of extravagance
relers to Superintendent Babcock on the
question of back salaries, and is as fol
lows :
The law provides for a City board of ex
amination, who may examine applicants for
teachers' certificates and grant two grades of
certificatesâ primary and sramraar grade.
The primary-grade teachers are authorized to
teach only in primary schools, and their
maximum pay is considerably less than that
ot a person hold ine a grammÃr-jtrade certifi
cate, notwithstanding that they may teach in
the same classes.
About the year 1887, while B. C. Stone was
chairman of the Clarification Committee, the
Board of Education passed a rule allowing
applicants for teachers' certificates 1 percent
extra for each year of successful experience
in teaching, not exceeding 10. Shortly there
alter, the Board of Examiners, misunaerstaud-
ing the rule of the Board of Education, rec
ommended that several teachers, numbering
about twelve in all, should receive various ex
tra credits for experience, and added the
same to the credits which they had previously
received on their primary-grade certificates,
thereby making the average of 85 per cent
and, on the strength of that result, gave them
grammar-grade certificates. The Board of Ed
ucation,* later, discovered this error and an
nulled the action >jy which these grammar
grade certificates had been granted.
Miss Annie Hines, who was one of the teach
ers who received a certificate in this manner,
entered a suit against the Board of Education
for the recovery of her grammar-grade certi
ficate, and also lor the payment of back salary,
the difference between the salary of a prim
ary-grade teacher and that of a grammar
grade teacher. Before the action In court was
settled, however, Miss Hines entered an ex
amination and, in the proper manner, se
cured a grammar-grade certificate. The suit
in court, notwithstanding, went on to a final
issue upon the question of salary; only, and,
during the last six months, it was decided oy
Judge Murphy in favor of Miss Hines.
During the time that the application was
pending in the Board of Examination, and
also while It was being considered by the
Board of Education in 1887, and subse
quently, while the matter was being consid
ered in court before Judtre Murphy, Superin
tendent Babcock always favored the side of
Miss Hines as against the Board of Education;
and it is supposed that it was largely through
his influence and testimony that the court
decided in her favor. The Superintendent,
on various occasions, both in the Board of
Education and in the committee of the whole
of the board (which is simply a private meet
ing of the members) urged the Board of Edu
cation not to appeal the case to the Supreme
Court, and also urged that the payment of the
back salary, amounting to about $700. be
made to her.
The attorney for the Board of Education,
William Grant, was strongly of the opinion
that Judge Murphy erred in giving the judg
ment in favor of Miss Hines, and recommended
the Board of Education to appeal the case. So
sure was he of the accuracy of his position
that he offered to bear all the expenses of car
rying the case to the Supreme Court, and to
charge no fee for his services; and, even fur
ther, he offered to pay the interest which had
accrued by reason of the delay in paying the
judgment; but the Board of Education refused
to order the case appealed to the Supreme
Court aud paid me judgment.
Superintendent Babcock called the atten
tion of the Board of Educatiou to the claims
of Miss L. A. Orr and Miss E. L. Williamson
and urged tnat they should be paid their back
salaries on the ground that their claims were
similar to that of Miss Hines. The amount of
money involved In these two claims is about
$700 and $500 respectively. The Board of
Education postponed consideration of the
recommendation of the Superintendent from
time to time, buf finally, just before going out
of office, these two claims were included in a
report of the Committee of Finance, which re
port was not read in detail to the board, and
the claims were allowed and ordered paid and
sent to the Auditor for approval. So little was
known about it that the Directors who had
persistently opposed these claims from the be
ginning voted in favor thereot without know
ing what they were voting for. These claims
arc now before the Auditor and not yet paid.
Two of the three teachers referred to have
since procured first-grade certificates, so that
the decision affects them only in the matter
of back pay, but the third holds a second
grade certificate, and the action oi the board
will necessitate paying her about $12 a
month extra in the future.
Among other contracts the board made one
with the Whittaker & Ray Company of this
City to furnish all subscription books at speci
fied discounts. Among these books was the
subscription edition of Webster's Dictionary.
Ignoring this contract the Supply Committee
purchased from some Eastern agent 100
copies of the dictionary for $10 80 each,
amounting to $1080, and the books were de
livered. To cover up the transaction it was
arranged that the bill should t>e divided into
ten parts, and that, each month, a bill lor
one-tenth ot the whole should be presented to
tbe board.
Payments have been made aud It is ex
pected that the new board will meet the bal-,
ance as they become due.
When School Director McElroy came into
office nis daughter was a primary teacher in
the department. Through his influence he
had her elected to '.he prineipalship of the
Harrison Primary School, situated on Grove
sueet, westoi Larkin. The building was an
old, dilapidated structure, unfit for school
purposes, not only by reason of defective cou.
struction, but because of old age and lack oi
repairs. There is no necessity of maintaining
a primÃry school in that locality. There was
abundant seating room for all of the children
in that neighborhood in tbe surrounding
schools; but, Instead of abolishing the school
when the prineipalship become vacant, the
board appointed Miss McElroy as principal;
and McElroy, as chairman of the Committee
on Buildings and Grounds, induced the board
to order the building repaired, and over $5000
was spent on the school building and yards.
The North Cosmopolitan School is one of the
old buildings and should be torn down. A
new building of the same capacity could be
erected for about $30,000. Tiie late Board of
Education ordered repairs to be made whicn
cost $17,000, without increasing the capacity
of the school.
The Webster Bchool is situated in the rear of
the Lincoln School building, ana consists of
two buildines, poorly constructed. It was
found about a year and a hull ago that there
was vacant class room in the surrounding
schools, and that the pupils from the Webster
School could be conveniently accommodated
therein. School Director Henderson made a
strong fight to have the Webster School
abolished, and at least five directors were in
favor thereof; but the majority prevailed and
the school is still running, while there is
abundant room for the pupils in schools near
by.
Something over a year ago the Directors
made a great show of intention to abolish the
Normal School. They said at that time that
the school should be abolished at the end of
the year. It was not abolished but was con
tinued, and one of the last acts of the late
board was the election of a so-called vice
principal. This was not only entirely unne
cessary, but is said to have been against the
wishes of the principal.
During the past two years an immense
quantity of fnrniture and school supplies has
been purchased from C. F. Weber & Co. It
will be interesting to follow down the pur
chase and see what goods this firm
sold the department during that time.
About $1000 worth ot maps were recently
bought of C. F. Weber & Co. They were pur
chased out. of the Library Fund, depleting it
so as to make it impossible for the teachers to
get what library books they need.
The board has usually employed about thirty
teachers, known as the substitute class. It is
to this class that appointments are made. The
board of 1893-94 made no appointments to that
ciass, except, as the result of competitive ex
aminations. The last board had a ruie provia
ing for t>ucb examinations, but uever made an
appoiutment thereunder. All aipoinuaents
were made under suspension of rules, and as
a result of bargaining and trading among the
memoers. On January 1, 1895, there were
about 891 teachers employed. On the Ist of
January, 1897, the b<>ard had increased the
number to about 956. On Junusry 1,1895, there
were 27 day-school substitutes on the payroll.
On January 1. 1897 there were 35 under pay
and 6 not under pay, and about 8 unas&igned
teachers, making a total oi about 50 day
school teachers in the department not in
charge of classes, besides 12 in the evening
schools. The average number ol teachers
actually employed In the day schools, to do
substitute work, is about 15, and in the even
ing school.s the average number of substitutes
actually at work is about 2.
The following school bu.ldings are old and
dilapidated and should be torn down as fast as
they can be replaced: Harrison, Longfellow,
Marshall, Redding and Webster. Most of the
money that is spent in repairing buildings
goes into these schools. A good school build
ing uses very little money for repairs during
the year. Every new board that comes in
makes a itrong showing of the amount thatis
necessarjr for school repairs and instances
these buildings. They ought not to be re
paired. Tbe policy of the board of 1893 and
1894 wan to keep them In habitable order.
Money that is spent on extensive repairs is
thrown away.
Mr. Hyde thinks there is more reckless
extravagance, nepotism and jobbery in
the scno la of San Francisco than in any
other department of the government. .He
sayÂ» matters are con trolled by apolitical
ring and that some people do not work at
any visible occupation after they become

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 1897. f~
FORMS OF BLANKS
USED BY COONEY
Lees Succeeds in Introduc
ing a Big Batch of
Deeds.
The Notary's Name Appears in
Print on All of the Ac
know'edgments.
Detectives Assert That Only in the
Craven Documents Wa> the
Crocker Csrt ficate Used.
The prosecution in the Cooney case
scored a point yesterday, when it was
opened for the introduction of some forty
documents acknowledged by Cooney,
which the detectives have gathered dur
ing the past four months. These docu
ments were dragged into court to prove
that the young notary was in tbe habit of
using a notarial form with his printed
name, instead of the general acknowledg
ments on the print?d deeds.
These papers and deeds cover the period
between August, 1893, and December, 1894.
They have been gathered from the lour
corners of the State, and if of no relevancy
in the case, as Cooney's attorneys con
tend, are at Jeasc evidence that tbe police
have bestirred themselves to a consider
able extent in making the collection.
These instruments include two made on
tbe day preceding the date of the pencil
deeds, while one of them, a conveyance
by Joseph Ennght of some property in
the Mission to his wife, was acknowledged
on the same day as the forms of the deeds
would seem to have been signed. Now,
in the case of the Euright deed Cooney
used a blank about the size and shape of
an ordinary bank check, with his name
printed on it.
In the majority of the acknowledgments
attached to the batch of instruments
brought in by Lees and the District Attor
ney this particular form of blank was
used. In the remainder a form somewhat
larger in size was adopted. Cooney's
name, however, appears on it in type,
and it was this very fact that caused the
District Attorney to drag the documents
into court. Arguing by inference the
logic of the prosecution ran in this wise:
On all deeds, with the exception of the
documents of Mrs. Craven, Cooney used a
notarial blank with his name printed on
it. Ergo, is this not a strange and pecu
liar urray o. facts?
The fact that they have deeds bearing a
date later than that of the pencil will tbat
Cooney acknowledged with forms contain
ing his printed name die detectives cite
as proof that he was not oat of that par
ticular style of blanks on September 27,
1894. They would go a step farther and
say that Cooney never used me general
form of blanks on the Craven deeds in the
course of his regular business. They say
they have ransacked the State, from
Shasta to Indio, and can find no deeds or
other documents acknowledged' by Cooney
with a general notarial blank. This
might or might not be so. but the defen
dant maintained it could be of no earthly
significance in his case.
What more natural, asked Reddy, than
that Cooney used two sets of blanks, as is
the custom of every notary, and that
when James G. Fair called on him to
have tiie pencil deeds witnessed the
notarial form that was first at hand
was used? Cooney had admitted, said
Keddy, that he find blanks with his name
printed upon them.
District Attorney Hosmer was tooth
and nail ior getting the result of the
detectives' wort in the way of collecting
Cooney acknowledgments into court and
have them duly scheduled as "exhibits"
or something else in the famous case. It
was a theory of the prosecution, argued
Hosmer, that Cooney never used such
blanks as appear on tbe pencil deeds, but
was accustomed to use what is Known as
an individual form.
Attorney Reddy came back with his
famous metaphor of the beefsteak and the
turkey. Because Cooney had blanks with
bis name printed upon them was no
reason why he had not the general lorm
of acknowledgment. Because he was in
the kabit of using the individual form in
seme instances was no proof that he did
not also at times use the other form. On
these lines the opposing attorneys fought
it out, with a result that Magistrate Cook
finally allowed the documents to come
into court for "what they were worth."
It look Detective Seymour half a day to
formally identify each deed or instrument
as they were presented to him. They
were irom all parts of the State, and
when finally piled up in court mude a
formidable array of real estate exhibits.
Tiie Enright deeds had first place, prob
ably because on the preceding day it
came to grief in the beefsteak and turkey
logic.
Reddy put Seymour through a some
what extended cross-examination. The
detective said that he had gained posses
sion of the Enright deed about Decem
ber 18.
"How did you come to make inquiries i
in this case?" asked Reddy.
"1 was detailed by Captain Lees," was
the reply.
"How long before the filing of the com
plaint against Cooney was this?"
"I began work on the case September
27 last."
There was no charge then pending
against Cooney?"
"No, sir."
''Then why were you investigating the
case?"
"As I understand the matter it was re
ported to Captain Lees. At any rate,
Captain Lees detailed me on the case."
"When you started out on your search
you were, of course, informed what the
object of the police inquiry was?"
"Yes, sir."
"State what this purpose was."
"Well, on September 26 Captain Lees
called me into his office and stated that
the Craven deeds and will had been re
ported to him as forgeries. He said he
had be?n asked to investigate the matter
and detailed me at once on the caae."
"Did you receive any further instruc
tions?"
"Well, as Captain Lees was in charge of
the case. I was in consultation with him
'from time to time.' "
"Well, when did yen include Cooney in
your searches?"
"Well, as soon as the pencil will was
dropped I turned my attention to the
deeds."
"You kept a record of the various wills
in the Fair case presented to the Probate
coun?"
"Well, I remember something about
them."
"Yon were informed that the Fair people
believed themselves injured?"
"I was informed that the Fair heirs had
made a complaint to Captain Lees."
"Up to the time the pencil will was with
drawn you devoted your search to that
document, you sayâ gathering evidence to
prove tnut it wÂ»Â« a forgery?"
â¢'Yes, sir."
"After that what instructions did you
receive from Captain Lees?"
â¢'He toid me to try to collect all the
deeds Cooney had acknowledged as a no
tary."
"You understood the purpose of that
inquiry?"
"Oh, yes â to find evidence to prove that
the acknowledgments on the pencil deeds
were false."
"You have produced here all those
kinds of deeds?"
"Oh, yes."
"You had two objects â one was to prove
the falsity of the acknowledgments, and
the other was to find evidence to convict
Cooney of perjury?"
"That's correct."
"Now, as a public officer, what object
had you in securing evidence to show that
the deeds were not genuine?"
"Well, I suppose it was in anticipation
that more people would be arrested if :his
investigation continues."
"As a public officer, have you ever been
requested to investigate the genuineness
of a deed to property where the parties
were not millionaires?"
"I don't think I have."
"Have you ever investigated deeds or a
will where the parties were millionaires?"
"This is the first one."
"You have never been asked before to
ascertain if a will or deed was false or
genuine?"
"No, sir."
Captain Lees followed to increase the
number of documents acknowledged oy
Cooney by seven mortgages.
Butler Smith was called to show a deed
Cooney had acknowledged for him on
September 26, 1894. Attorney Hugh J.
Jones had a simiiar exhibit of the date of
September 22, 1894. In each case Cooney
bail used an individual blank, and they
were all labeled in turn and turned over
to the custody of the court clerk.
District Attorney Hosnier then at
tempted to get J. O. Jebsen to say that he
had printed those lorrus of blanks for
Cooney, but the Magistrate threw the evi
dence out of court. v

as a notary, was called for the prosecution
to say that he had fallen heir to a number
of Cooney's blanks, all of which were of
the individual form. It transpired that
Lyons has an office at 607 Montgomery
s-treet. He was appointed a notary first
in 1884. For about two months previous to
Cooney's retirement he had no office and
had his notarial work aone by the latter.
Cooney had taken a number of blanks to
Lyons' office for this work. When Lyons
was finally reappointed he found about
thirty of theae forms in his desk, left
there by Cooney.
"These blanks had been taken by
Cooney from his own office to yours to do
your business for you?"
"Yes, sir."
"And there were too many of them?"
"Yes, I suppose so."
"Yon don't know what blanks Cooney
left in bis own office?"
"No, sir."
"Did Captain lines ask you in is ques
tion ?"
"Yes, sir."
That was the end of the evidence along
the line of what kind of blanks Cooney
was accustomed to using.
This morning Max Gumpel, the expert
in handwriting, will be called to compare
the defects in typography in the pencil
will certificate with wbat is claimed to Do
similar flaws in the blank printed by
Crocker & Co. on January 8, 1896. This
wiil complete the case for the police on
the preliminary bearing. They say they
have much important evidence in reserve
which tÂ£ey will not make public until
the trial of Cooney, that in, of course, pro
viding that Magistrate Cook sees his way
clear to hold the young attorney.

TO BE INTERRED
AT LAUREL HILL
Details of the Burial of
Mrs. Flood Kept
Secret.
Only E datives Will Follow the
Remains to the
Grave.
Father Wayman Will Officiate at
the Burial S rvices, Which No
Friends May Attend
Only relatives will follow the remains
of Mrs. Mary E. Flood to the grave. No
friends may view the well- re mem be red
features of tbe departed. No flowers nrfay
be placed upon tbe bier.
Tbe greatest secrecy is being main
tained by the family relative to the burial.
All that is known is that the funeral will
take place some time to-day.
Father Wayman will read the burial
services, and the casket, wherein reposes
all that was mortal of the late widow of
the multi-millionaire, wiil be placed in
the Flood vaolt-at Laurel Hill.
Up at the brownstone mansion on the
hill all inqaries of tender, solicitous
friends meet witn no response. The great
oak doors, destitute of all badge of
mourning, are hermetically sealed.
This funeral, at which no friend may
attend or even send a flower in loving
remembrance, is in keeping with the oft
expressed desire of the deceased, and also
in strict accordance with the views of her
son and daughier. Only they and Rich
ard Pollis, brother-in-law of Mr?. Flood,
and James Follis and Miss Lillie JJ'ollis,
nephew and niece, will follow her remains
to the grave.
1 Mrs. Flood's death was not altogether
unexpected by her intimate friends, who
have watched her health failing for the
past year. Nevertheless her passing away
with so little premonition was a great
shock to them. Speculation is rife as to
the disposition of the vast estate, but as
yet no one is in a position to state just
what disposal Mrs. Flood has made of her
colossal fortune.

CLOSE FISH
Beaten Out a Nose on
Bright Phoebus by
Argentine.
. â
Schnitz at Odds of 15 to 1 Led
His Field From Wire
to Wire.
Queen Mab Outfooted tbe TwcYear-
Oldsâ Suisun Was Presented
With a Race.
The going was of the splashy sort at
Inglesicie yesterday, yet withal the first
choices fared extremeiy well, three out of
six breasting the tape in front Schniiz
evoked praises from bis backers ana
lamentations from the friends of the first
and second choices by .-canipering away
with the second event on the card at the
spicy odds of 15 to 1. In the :-ame race
Jack Martin vas â second at 100 to 1, and
the "didn't I tell you' crowd immediately
assumed a wiser look. The stormy con
dition of the weather was not propitious
for good racing, still the same old crowd of
icgulars were seen "piping" the odds in
r ring.
Mike Hennessy should perchance re-
I ceire an appointment aa a policeman, in
all probability the first one to feel tbe
strong grip of the law at his hands would
be Michael himself. The veteran knight
of the saddle had the mount on Bright
Phcebus, the one-time winner of the rich
Realization stakes, which was one of the
four starters that faced the barrier in tbe
third race over one mile and a furlong.
Trainer Hunn had the oij? bay right upon
edge, Â»nd a swell plunge was made on
him, cuttins his price from II to 5 down
to 3 to '2. Benamela opened a 6to 5 fa
vorite, receding to twos. Argentina be
cause she wouldn't do in the mud, and
Osier Joe for some other reason, were also
expected to. show some speed.
T. Sloan sat the back of Argentina which
it was supposed couldn't step in juicy go
ing, and sat it real well. He sent her out
in front, and lolling over on her neck was
never observed to fall back among tha
other three starters. Michael Hennepsy
was alternately third, second, third,
four h, second, and when the wire was
passed Michael was still second, only by a
Lose.
The veteran rider made the same error
that other riders before him have made.
A furlonp from the wire he wÂ»" satisfied
that he bad the race up his sleeve, which
he undoubtedly did have. He forgot,
however, to allow for the mare slightly in
front of him having a pound or so in re
serve, and when he began riding hard
from the paddock on, was beaten on the
best horse. The winner was 4tol in the
ring.
It must be that "Will "Wallace's colt
Flacon aoeu not like a muddy track.
He opened an even-money favorite for the
three-furlong two-year-old scramble and j
then receded to twos. Getting away
fairly weil he could not contract himseif,
finishing sixth. Queen Mab, which
coupled with Siva, her stable companiou,
ruled favoriie in the betting around post
time, won the dash in a drive from Free
Lady, a 7 to 1 shot. Siva was a good
third.
IBraw Scot was chosen as tne most
â  _ible of the nine starters in tne mile
run, and it proved a very poor pick. The
old gray opened a 2 to 1 favorite, went
back to 13 to 5 and became entangled with
the mud over near the half pole. Schnitz,
with "Skeets" Martin up, wes in front
from the jump and won at the end rather
cleverly from Jack Martin, a 100 to 1 shot,
piloted by Stevens.
Charley Sanders had the pleasure of
peeing his colors finish first again in the
fourth event, a six-furlong spin. He
started Ransome for the first time this
season, and, starting equal choice in the
betting with Morven, made all the run
ning and turned up the easiest kind of a
winner, with Mike Rice in the place a
leneth in front of Morven.
With Fiy and Potentate scratched out of
the six-furlong run that followed. Cahente
opened up at evensin the ring. From the
manner in which lie was ridden the odds
should have beenlOO to L Sport McAllii

Good start. Won easily. Winner, ii. E. Leigh's br. L, by strath more- Beatrice. â  lime, 1:34. ___
ter could not head Kowalsky yesterday,
and the latter horse, allowed to cut out the
pace, passed the wire an easy winner by
three length*. Caliente, coming on from
back in the ruck, secured the place clev
erly enough from Sport.
GenÂ« Leigh's fasi tiily fcuisun, starting a
3 to 10 favorite, had nothing to beat in the
final seven-furlong run, and won as sac
liked from imp. Sain.
xo its.
George E. Smith (Pittsburg Phil), the
gentlemanly Eastern plunger, arrived
here Wednesday night and was a visitor
at the track yesterday. Mr. Smith is the
possessor of quite a select string of horses
himself, about the best of which is Belmar.
jSiliy McGrance's two-year-old filiv Free
Lady stood a chance of beating Queen
Mab had she not run out on swinging
into the stretch. She is a daughter of
Free Knight and Fauna 111.
Kemmel is another youngster that made
a very good showing in the two-year-old
scramble. She is a half-sister to Chart
reuse 11. . Ââ.,
There was a warm tip out on Sir Wil
liam, a colt by Fitzjames, to win the baby
race, and it was not sue i a wild one either,
for he ran flatteringly, and was well up at
the end, although failing to get a piece of
the coin.
The number of bookmakers chaining up
odds was swelled to twenty-one at venter
day's cut-in. Barney Schreiber and Harvey
Harris were back ou the block.
Johnny Coleman took a hard fall out of
Caliente, the favorite, for the fifth race,
laying the top price of 8 to 5 against him.
Slaughter's ride on Braw Scot in the sec
ond race was about as picturesque as the
oue he furnished astride Kowalsky at
Oakland some days ago. Either would bd
a credit to a schoolboy.
The price laid against Jack Martin was
certainly a false one. Muddy going is the
gelding's strong iorte, he being of little
use as a money-earner on a fast track. The !
tempting place and show odds offered
caught many of the small bettors.
The field books were hit hard over the
victory of Schnitz, the lines bacit of the
stands after the race resembling those at
a country town postoffice on a Saturday
night. Jack Martin's second also reduced
the bank rolls.
The win of Argentina in the third event
gives that race at Oakland one day last
week a decidedly spicy flavor and just a
few are presumptuous to presume that a
colored gentleman removed a big fat tur
key from the coop some time in tne even
ing when he guessed no one was looking.
It is strange what a deal of gossip the Bald
win stable furnishes the turf and what ex
ecrable and inexplicable performances its
| horses have furnished. On the day of the
mare's bad race over the Oakland track,
on January 21, she warmed up like a wild
horse in the preliminary gallop, after
seeing which a number of bettors pro
ceeded to get aboard. The mare steadily
receded in the betting and the right ones
were given the tip to hedge out. That
rare was passed with too light an inquiry
by the judges. Yesterday the mare comes
out and downs such a notorious high class
mudlark as Bright Ptjcebus.
It is probably fortunate for some boy
with a rather shady reputation for
honesty that he did not sit on the back of
Caliente and put up the ride Eddie Jones
| did or he might bo seen at a downtown
employment office this morning. Lying
away back in the ruck tne first part of the
race with his mount, he made a late run,
and finished second to the "uood thing,"
Kowalsky, on clearly the best horse.
Moreno, a full sister to the pood mud
performer, Sam Leake, was well played
to get a place or show in the last race,
and made a ridiculous showing. A glance
at the form book will show that "she must
have slipped her muzzle and robbed some
hay and feed barn.
Races should be so conditioned as to pre
vent such high-class performers as Suisun
falling into races with a band of cheap
seliing:platers such us Opposed her in the
final race of the day.

Measures Which Have Passed the As
sembly of Importance to Sportsmen.
Word was received yesterday at the
office of the Fish Commission in this City
of the passage of several bills of import
ance to sportsmen : through the lower
house of the Legislature. In most in
; stances these are amendments and modi
fications of the old laws. Under the old
law robins may be killed four months in
the year, but under the amendment these
pretty creatures are included with Cali
fornia canaries and song birds that are
protected from slaughter at all limes.
> The open season lor doves has been
altered so that it extends from July 15 to
February 15- At present the open season
begins on July 1. The law prohibiting
the killing of pheasants has been carried
to March 1, 1899. An important change
has been made relating to the killing ana
selling of game birds. At present game
birds can be tilled for four months, but
game cannot be Bold except for two
months. Now the season lor killing and
the season for selling are identical. The
deer law is materially altered. The pos
session of deer, except that of male deer,
in the open season is prohibited. At pres
ent the offender has to be actually caught
in the act of slaying these animals before
a conviction can De had.
For the protection of fish the new law
prohibits the takin&of black bass except
by a hook and line. The taking of lobsters
and crawfish "of less than nine and a half
inches in length, measured from one
extremity to the other" exclusive of claws,
etc., ii prohibited. The buying, selling or
possession of female crabs is unlawful.
This measure is directed against the
Chinese particularly, as these fishermen
take all kinds and all sizes. .
A change has been made in the open
season for trout. Instead of being open
from April 1 to November 1, it will be
from May 1 to December 1.
The close season for steelheads will be
from February 1 to May 1 and the close
teason for salmon from September 10 to
November 15, with the provision that
salmon may be taken in tidewaters after
October 15. This is to protect the salmon
in (be upper as well as the -lower rivers
during the spawning season.
The tidewaters are define J as follows:
In the Sacramento River as extending
from its mouth to Sacramento city in the
San Joaquin to the Southern Pacific Rail
road bridge, near Lathrop; in Eel River.
Humbolat County, to east fprry abov* the
town of Fortuna; in the Klamath River
to a point on the river north of the resi
dence of J. McGarvey; in Smith River,
Del None County, to Haggins ferry.

COOED IN COMFORT
ON A DOORSTEP
Officer McLaughlin Makes
a Startling Morning
Discovery.
It Was an Abandoned but
Bouncing Baby Girl Four
Days Od.
The Cbi!d Has Alre-dy Secured One
Home and Many Others Are
Open to Her.
Officer McLaughlin is responsible for
the introduction of a wee bit of girlhood
into society. His method, however, dif
fers widely from those of Ed Greenaway,
but then it is because they travel on dif
ferent beats.
McLaughlin was patrolling Steuart
The Doorstep Waif.
street early yesterday morning, when he
heard a child's voice in a dark doorway.
He approached carefully, and in a recess
in iront of No. UK. out of c rain, he
discovered a snug bundle of kicking hu
manity.
It was a four-day-old little eirl, comfort
ably clothed and apparently in good
health.
Attached to the jacket was the follow
ing ncte:
Ban Francisco, Jan. 27, 1897.
This child was born January 25 at 9a. M.
Owing to circumstances which no doubt you
may surmise, it is impossible for It to be cared
for by the mother. Both father and mother
are of fine family, and you will, I am sure, be
amply repaid ior your troubleâ or any one in
whose care you may piace it. Try, for hu
manity's sake, to keep the child out of an in
stitution, ior you will most certainly be re
warded for doing this or helping to doso.
The babe was immediately taken to the
Receiving Hospital and then was placed
in charge of the Rev. J. W. Daniels of
Sacramento, who is assistant superintend
ent cf the Children's Home-finding So
ciety of California.
This gentleman soon found a haven for
the child in a private family, but it is de
sirable not to mention where. In speak
ing of the babe, tie said:
"It is our desire that all little waifs com
ing under our charge should break off
entirely from the past from the moment
they come into our hands.
"This unfortunate little one will never
know any more than we know now of her
parents, who, by abandoning it as they
have, have forfeited all right to it.
"We have given the poor little girl a
nice, comfortable home. To be sure, so
far as we can see at this time, the home is
but a temporary one, one which may be
come permanent. However, within a
few weeks or months we will know better,
and if the people who have her now care
to relinquish their charge there are many I
warm hearts and comfortable homes ready
to receive her."
As the Rev. Mr. Daniels was saying the
above a well-dressed and apparently
wealthy lady from Oakland, accompanied
by her maid, dropped into the office.
"Is this where the Uttle baby is?" she
asked, with some perturbation. "I've just
come from the JP.eceiving Hospital, and
they told me to come here."
"So, madam; the child is not here. It
is beine cared lor at a private home."
The woman was much put out. "I
wanted to see it," she said, "and perhaps
I wouJd adopt it."
Tbat lady's name and address have been
booked in the "want column," and she
will be one of the first on the list for the
next stray waif.
The police are at a loss to know who are
the parents of trie child.
JUDGE BREEN CORRECT.
His Claim of !>:â¢ quaiheution to Try a
Case Upheld by the Supreme
Court.
A decision was handed down by the Su
preme Court yesterday affirming an order
transferring the case of Johnson, adminis
tratrix, against Brown et al., defendants,
from San Benito to Santa Clara county.
â  The case came before the Supreme
Court on appeal from the order, the mo
tion being upon the ground that tie
Judge of the court was disqualified by
reason of relation within the third degree
to one of the attorneys for the defense.
Joan N. Uudner was the husband of a
niece of tue Hon. James F. Breen, the
Jud^e 01 the Superior Court oi San Benito
County, in which the action was pending,
and lor more than three years prior to tue
induing of the motion nad been the gen
eral law partner 01 N. C. Brigys, one of the
attorneys of record for the defense.
One of tuÂ© plaint. fts made an affidavit
in which sue stated that Huclner hud en
acting continuously since me rLing of de
fendant's answer in conjunction with his
law partner, although the answer was
signed by Brings only.
Also by affidavit one of the defendants
sta.ed that- iludner had not- been em
ployed'as attorney and rendered no assist
ance m the case.
It was shown that at a previous trial of
the case Huduer hud sat at the table with
his law partner and assisted in the trial.
Judge Breen claimed that this disqualified
fairnsell to act, and by order ol anotaer
Judge the case was transferred to canut
Clara County ior trial. The plaintiffs then
appealed.
Judge Hanison wrote tne decision, Van
Fleet and Mcfr'urland concurring.
CUT HIS THROAT.
W. li. PatAhel to Get Kid of Business
Troubles Attempts to End
His Life.
W. Â£. Patchel, painter and decorator,
1020% Larkin street, attempted to commit
suicuie yesterday afternoon by cutting his
throat with a razor.
His shop was attached by the Sheriff a
few days ago, and since then he has felt
despondent. He talked of his creditors
"crowding him to the wall" and making
life not worth the living.
Yesterday afternoon he ate a hearty
ineui ia tne kitchen, and after the meal
was over liis wife stepped into the parlor.
As soon as she left the kitchen l'atcljel
pulled a razor out of his pocket and drew
it across his throat, indicting a long, deep
aash, penetrating to the windpipe, butnot
severing it.
His wife heard him fall to the floor, and
rud ing in saw the blood pouring from
the wound. She ran shrieking out of the
house and told the neighbors what her
husband had done. l>r. Bushnell \va
summoned and he stitched and dressed
the wound. The doctor says that with
care Fatchel will soon recover, but he nad
a narrow escape.
LEVIN BEOS.' STOEES SOLD.
Creditors Will Realize About Twenty
Cents on the DuUnr.
All the crocery-stores formerly owned
and operated by Levin Eros, were sold by
moans of private bids in Judge Slack's
court on Wedne-day. The basis of sale in
each case was 70 per cent of the inventory
value of the stock?. The two stores in this
City, located at 134 Sixth street and 1324
and 1326 Market street, were sold for about
$20,000 to H. and M. Wolf, who will con
duct the business under the firm name of
H. Wolf & Bro., successors to Levin Bros.
They will retain in their employ the mem
bers of the old firm.
O. Moses purchased the store at West
Oakland and Golliber & Hart that at
Tenth and Washington streets, Oakland.
The stock of the Berkeley store, which
wns removed to the Oakland establish
ment immediately after the embarrass
ment of the firm was publicly announced
about a month ago, was sold as pan of the
latter.
It is estimated that the creditors will
realize about 20 cents on the dollar. They
were offered a settlement on the basis of
3o l /3 cents, but the objections of Dodge,
Sweeney & Co. prevented the acceptance
of the proposition.
The San Francisco stores will be re
opened for business Saturday.
MAYOB PHELAN OBJECTS.
Be Says s Japanese Interpreter Is
Entirely Unnecessary.
The commission to select interpreters
for the criminal courts met again in the
Mayor's office yesterday afternoon to
complete the list of appointments which
was partly filled Wednesday. One con
clusion reached was. to dispense with a
Japanese interpreter, if, appearing to be
the fact that there is so little use for such
an official as to make an appointment prac
tically useless. The tallowing: dispatch
concerning the matter was yesterday sent
by Mayor Phelan to Senator Braunhart at
Sacramento:
San Francisco, Jan. 28, 1897.
Senator Braunhart, Saciamento, Cal.: A
Japanese interpreier is absolutely unneces
sary. It means a wasteful expenditure of pub
lic money. Chief Crowley says there is hardly
a case a month needing an interpreter and
that the authorities have no trouble in getting
one when needed. Inform the Legislature to
this effect and enter a strong protest.
James D. Phelan, Mayor.
The Commissioners have appointed V.
Marchabout interpreter of French and
Spanish and Andrew Glover interpreter of
Portuguese and Slavonian.
MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT.
French Benevolent Society "Will De
light Friends With a Grai>d Affair.

is to take the form of a benefit for the
fund to pay the dues of the poorer mem
bers.
Great preparations are being made for
the affair, which is to take place at Native
Sons' Hall on the 21st of February.
It is expected that the French colony

talent, and the second a one-act opera,
"Le Nocesde Jeanette."
Administratrix Gardner Accuaed.

C. VAN DE VERE
HAS SKIPPED OUT
The Wife of Professor
Eugene on the List of
the Missing.
Story of Two Clairvoyants and
a Tale ot G H. Bell's
Lost Money.
Professor Eugene Has Started Easi
R\p:ng to 6 t N ws of His
Departed Spouse.
Charles Van de Vere, thÃ clairvoyant
who came into notoriety in April last, is
very much sought after. He has been
under $2500 bonds daring the past nine
months to appear before Police Judge
Low on a charge of grand larceny, and Jus
trial was to have been held yesterday
morning.
But Mr. Van de Vere, as a clairvoyant,
evidently did not see his way clear to
getting out of his scrape, bo he did not
show ap in court and Jndge Low declared
the bonds forfeited, and a bench warrant
has been issued for his arrest.
Van de Vere and Professor Eugene, alÂ°o
a clairvoyant, connected themselves in
1896 with George H. Bell, the ex-post
master of Carson, Nev. He was partial to
the schemes they placed before him and
eventually obtained $800 of his money, so
as to pay the expenses of developing his
interest in an estate in Scotland valued at
more than Â£1,000,000.
Bell beneved in the two, and furnished
them with expense money as tliey de
raanded it until be suddenly found him
self without enough capital to return from
this Ciiy to Carson. Then the story came
out and both Van de Vere and Eugene
were placed under arrest and charged with
grand larceny.
They promised to return the money to
their victim, who was really in need of it,
and who is still in a condition which might
jeopardize a successful trial and convic
tion. On this promise the grand larceny
trial was repeatedly postponed, and when
Professor Eugene eventually paid ud bis
share the case against him was dismissed.
But Charles Van de Vere has not ful
fi led his promise, hence the intended
prosecution.
Back of this is another story, showing
that the erstwhile partners in the clair
voyant business are no longer friends as
of yore.
They had adjoining offices and living
rooms at 1728 Market street, where they
transacted their business. Mrs. Eugene
assisted them materially in their work,
and frequently, in fact more frequently
than with her husband, she was the assist
ant of i is friend.
When Charles Van de Vere disappeared
three weeks ago Mrs. Eugene was also on
the absent list, and her whereabouts is
as much of a mvsteryat this lime as is
that of Van de Vere.
Professor Eugene ceased his occupancy
of the Market-street offices yesterday and
proposes leaving for the East to-day.
"Whether he knows where Sirs. Eugene is
or his old associate is not known, but he
is going away to hunt lor one of the two
or both.

LOST HIS MOTHER'S MONEY
Young Tyler,- 111, Unconscious and Xeg
lected, is Bobbed Aboard the
Walla Walla.
Llewellyn J. Tyler, a young man 22
years of age, is very ill at his mother's
residence, 915 Haigtit street, and there is a
pathetic story connected with hi 3 preaent
condition.
Three months ago he went to Seattle,
Wash., in search of employment. Subse
quently he contracted rheumatism, be
came unfit for further work, and soon ex
â hausied" what little money he ad saved.
He sent to his mother for $10 that he
m ght come home.
The mother made inquiries here and
learned that $10 would secure only steer
age accommodations, so she sent her
boy $20.
He took passage January 14, in the
Walla Walla. Though unwell he was de
termined to save his mother from an ex
tra evy on her slender re>ources, and ac
cordingly chose steerage fare that he
might return the other $10.
The first evening out from Seattle he
was taken with convulsions. They hustled
him out of the warm steerage into a cold,
cheerless place between decks and ielt
him there on a poor little mattress and
sparsely coverpd, though he was exposed
continuously near open hatches to the
j cold ocean air.
The next day 'near noon the Walla
Walla arrived here. Word was sent to
the boy's lather, Charles M. Tyler, who is
divorced, that his son was ill aboard the ,
steamer. On the following day the iataer
went down to the pier.ana was surprised
to find young Tyler not only ill but un
conscious, unattended and exposed. His
face and bauds were blue with cold.
The younc man was taken at once to
the Receiving Hospital and later to his
mother's home, where on the following
day he recovered consciousness and
wanted to know if his mother had got
the $10.
Since then he has been ill at the point
of death, his condition, the doctor says,
having been caused by great exposure.
Upon regaining consciousness he told of
the incidents oi ins voyage up to the time
he was hustled off b-tween decks and left
alone and lost consciousness.
While left alone and out of his bead
some one had visited him and rifled his
pockets not only of the treasured $10 but
ol a purse and small change and his moth
er's letters.
MUST EEPOET BIRTHS.
Board of Health After Physicians Who
Fall to Make Keturns.
Judge Joachiinsen has fined Dr. E. N.
Lowry $5 'or failing to report a birth.
Some months ago Dr. Garrigue was lined
in the same amount for a similar failure.
The intention of the Board ol Health is to
have ail births reported if it is possible to
compel physicians to do their duty in thi3
respect. A circular has been sent out by
Secretary Edmond Godchaux to all pnysi
oians and midwives in the City and Coun
ty to call attention to the section of the
Political Code which provides that physi
cians ana midwives must, on or Lefore the
4th day of each month, make a return of
all births occurring in their practice dur
ing the preceding month. Notice is also
given that prompt arrest and diligent
prosecution will follow any violation of
the law.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 28.â Speculation was
â¢xtremely dull again to-day at the Stock Ex
change, and In a majority of instances the fluctua
tions were trifling. The only wide changes were
in a few of the specialties, c-rtaln of which ad
vanced while others declined. - The trading, how
ever, was so small that no special significance was
attached to any of the movements. The transac
tions aggregated only 87,456 shares, of which
12,300 were American Sugar Refining. No other
stock figured for as much as 10,000 shares. The
fact that quotations from London came fraction
ally higher at the opening did cot authorize the
market to make any response owing to the con
tinued lack of orders for outside account. Prices
yielded i/gfal!; per cent, but the losses were soon
recovered, only to be followed by another decline
which left Uie leading stocks fractionally below
last night's finals.
The declaration of the long-expected 3 per cent
dividend by the St. Paul and Omaha lea to no
activity in thai stock, and it closed with a net gain
of 01. ly i/g per cent. Northern Pacific preferred
certificates were noticeably strong and advanced
from 33% to 5, a well-Known Broadway house.

Manhattan was sold down 1% 10 59% on a

UNION STOCKYARDS. 111.. Jan. 28.-Bup
plies of cattle thlj week have not been large: yet
the demand is not brisk, and prices show no buoy
j ancy. Yesterday's advance of 10c was lost to day,
although the supply offered was but moderate.
About 40.000 have been received thus far this
wee* against 40,529 for the same lencth 01 time
last week, and 42.35U for the corresponding period
in 1896. No improvement is shown in the qual
ity of offerings.. Hogs continue to be held back
on account or the severe weather, and the weed's
receipts will fall greatly short of the last two
weeks. Since Monday but 110,700 hogs have
arrived as compared with 150.339 for the same
portion of lav-, week, 95,170 a year ago and 132,
--038 two years ago. eastern shipper* are, bow
ever, buying sparingly, and prices are no better.
Packers find no competition, and are therefore
able to buy at low prices. A decline of 6c took
place to-day. There was a fairly active local ship
ping and export derrmni fur sheep, and as offer
ings were light prices were steady.

WORK OF YEARS
A Haywards Inventor Pro
duces a Remarkable
Rotary Machine.
Engineers Declare That It Will
Result in Great Changes
in Steam Engines.
E. 0. Bernett Says He Has Jnst
Realiz d the Dream of
H;s Lif.v
Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 28. j
After many years of patient working
and earnest study, E. O. Bennett of Hay
wards has just completed a practical and
perfect engine, which those who have ex
amined it declare to be the most wonder
ful Â»nd valuable mechanical invention of
the age.
Many years ago Mr. Bennett conceived
the iaea that it was possible to derive the
greatest amount of force from an engine
â with the least possible material, and his
\tion consists in what is Known es a
"Trotarj steam engine which is as powerful
Vis the ordinary machine ol six times its
weight and size. A delegation of practi
cal engineers was recently invited to Mr.
Bennett's studio to inspect his miniature
engine, which is not so high a? the seat of
a chair, but which develops a force equal
to fifteen horsepower. The engine only
weighs 400 pounds, and receives ampie
steam through a half-inch pipe, which is
but one-sixteenths the area of the stand
ard supply pipe of the ordinary engine of
the same power, w hie the weight of the
latter is about 2500 pounds, or six times
that of Mr. Benneit's invention.
Mr. Bennett has spent most of his life
in solving mechanical problems, and his
invention attracted much attention in
San Francisco before his ill-health made
imperative his removal to the softer air of
Haywards.
His little engine is composed of but nine
parts. There are no parts that require re
pairing, tightening up or adjusting to
wear, neither are there any packing or
stuffing boxes, as alt wear is automatically
taken up by the parts themselves.
In describing his engine to-day to a
party of interested mechanics Mr. Ben
nett said: "It is decidedly a pressure en
gine, for the steam that once enters it has
got to move something- to get out. In
propelling the wheel tho steam acts upon
an average area of only five square inches.
Yet it is easy to understand that this is
sufficient to develop great power if you
take into account the fact that there is no
dead center to overcome nor heavy fly
wheel to move, but a continuous and di
rect action of the steam upon t!:e work ;
without the intervention of excessive !
weieht and multiphcaiion of parts causine â 
more or less 1 fiction.
"As soon as I have progressed a little !
farther with my experiments I shall i
patent my ideas both in this country and
abroad. I am now preparing to make
some very extensive tests, and 1 am con
fident that they will show most wonderful
jfres- ..its and prove to tiie world that a prac- j
â kal and perfect rotary steum-engine has I
W'> iÃÂ»t been produced, and that California |
*viil add one more successful invention to
tne long list she has already produced."

LIKES FOLSOM' S CLIMATE.
Burglar Jennings Tells Why Ho Doei
Not Like San Quontin.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â John Jen
nings, the burglar who terrified a com
panion at Haywards with an empty pis
tol, was sentenced to three years' impris
onment in Folsom. He asked to be sent
to Foisom, because he said the climate
there was more healthy than at San Quen
tin. Jennings has been a boarder at both
places.
Jennings said that he wanted to live an
honest life, but such a thing was impossi
ble. He wanted to leave the State when
he was dismissed from San Quentin, but
had net the money, 'ihe |5 given to each
man when leaving the prison was used by
him while in the hospital, and he left
with money enough to reach San Fran
cisco. Four days later he was again under
arrest.
Love in a Courtroom
OAKLAND, Cal, Jan. 28.â The habeas
corpus proceedings' of John Howard, the
motorman charged with being jointly
responsible with Dr. Sharce for the death
of Anna Johnson, came up before Judge
O^den this morning. As the evidence
was not all written up, the hearing of the
petition was postponed till next Wednes
day.
Hulda Johnson, the sister of the cead
girl, always greets Howard when he comes
into court, and to-day as they were before
Judge Ogden, he was holding her hand
and she was drawing her fingers through
his hair. Occasionally she would lean over
and kiss him. Howard is a very aristo
cratic prisoner, and refuses to associate
with his fellow-prisoners. This morning
he was highly indignant when he was
handcuffed to Burglar Jennings to be taken
to court. He protested that it was an out
rage to couple him to a common burglar,
but his protest was unheeded.
INTERESTED IN McKENNA
His Appointment to the Cabinet
Would Aff?ct Three Water-
Front Cases.
They Have Been Tried Before Him,
and the Evidence Wou d Have to
Be Presented Again.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Call.l
908 Broadway, Jan. 28. J
The Mayor, the City Council, the at
torneys for the water-front suit and inci
dentally the whole ciiy are interested in
Judge McKenna's Cabinet aspirations
At the present time there are three
cases pending in the United States Dis
trict Court that have been heard before
Judge McKenna and which will have to
be retried if Judge McKenna should retire
from the bench. The Mayor, a majority
of the Council, City Attorney Peirsol and
Attorneys Hill & Davi3 were present,
and it was decided that nothing could be
done at this time. The cases are Cook
vs. the city of Oakland, Southern Pacific
Railroad Company vs. Oakland, and the
Southern Pacific Railroad vs. George C.
l'ardee.
Tiie^e suits are the result of the water
front agitation of four years ago, and the
last two are for damages for the alleged
illegal removal and sale of railroad prop
erty from Broadway wharf.
Attorney Davis sated that all the evi
dence was written up and that if Judge
McKenna should retire the cases would
have to be retried. It would, however,
not be so much work as at the former
trials because the presentation ot the cases
on behalf of the city would only require a
review of the testimony already offered.
It was decided that the matter was alto
gether too del.cate to be handled and that
no'Â«hjng could be done at present, so the
conference concluded with united good
wishes for JudÂ°e McKenna and his Cab
inet aspirations.

Cost of I'seiess Trial*.
OAKLAND, Cau, Jan. 28.â Judge Og
den dismissed the charge to-day against
Albert LeFort, who was held to answer for
assault with a deadly weapon. His attor
ney moved for a dismissal because of a
lack ot evidence and Judee Ogrien grant
ed it.
"Already this case has coÂ«t the county
$200," said the Judge, "and the evidence
ciearly shows that nothing more than a
simple battery was committed, and 1
douot if a conviction lor mat could have
been obtained had the defendant pleaded
self-deiense. Before holding a prisoner
committing justices should consider the
time of this court and also the expense
which it entails upon the county."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 1897.
DEMOCRATS RUSH
THE CONVENTION
Seth Mann Will Be at the
Head of Their Munici
pal Ticket.
The Young E'ement Were on
Deck and the 0!d Guard
at Home.
No R cognition Given tho Committee
S:nt From the Cilizns' Party
Convention-
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â When
Charles McCleverty, the old-time Jeffer
sonian Democrat, called the City Demo
cratic Convention to order to-night there
were about seventy out of the seventy
seven delegates present.
T. C. Coogan was nominated for tem
porary chairman and elected unani
mously. Leo Park and S. Bachrach were
SETH MANN, Democratic Nominee for Mayor of Oakland,
elected secretaries and a recess was taken
while the chair named the usual com
mittees.
Somehow or other the convention aid
not partake of the usual nature of such
gatherings. The hurrah of former years,
when Frank J. Moffit, Warren English,
William D. English and \V. W. Foote took
a hand in Democratic politics, was miss
ing, and Charley McCleveny had to shout
for several minutes before the delegates
dispelled the cnilly air of their respective
quarters by occupying them.
Instead of the old crowd a younger gen
eration was in evidence, and since their
political experience began the reign of
Democracy in Alameda County has been
very unstable, and they met with hesi
tancy. With the old-timers it was dif
ferent They remember the time when
Democracy was King and they schooled
themselveÂ« to act in accordance with their
power. When thines changed the old
guard dropped oat of sight as soon as they
realized they could not control. Never
was this shown clearer than by the per
sonnel of to-night's convention.
The chairman appointed committees as
follows:
On credentials â James Brown, A. T. Mo-
Donnufh, James Holmes, C. H. Brosnahan, W.
H. High, J. Stanley, C. F. Thompson.
On plntform and resolutionsâ W. Dunn, J.
J. McDonald, James Neyland, C. H. Abbott,
P. E. FteberUng, M. Sullivan, W. F. Leonard.
On permanent organization and order of
businessâ P. Murphy, J. A. /orster, Charles
McCleverty, L. F. Hiekey. C. W. Logan, P. E.
Ualton, V. Gllardin.
The first intimation of the old struggle
between tne Moffitt and Fitzgerald wings
occurred over the proxy of J. B. Carring
lon, which was held by Frank J. Motfitt.
Will White of tho Third \v ard stated that
James Landregan held Mr. M... Hut's proxy
and was therefore entitled to vote also ior
Mr Carrington. Con Bro-nahan led the
Opposition and a viva voce vote showed
that the Fitzeerald-Brosnahan men pre
vailed at the rntio of about 4 to 1.
The platform was short and clear. It
pledges the nominee to prosecute the
water-front snits, to maintain good streets,
to alternate the fire hydrants so as to have
the benefits of both, to an economical
administration, and concluded with a
nlank regarding pubi.e schools and stating
that under no consideration should any
sectarian influence be permitted to enter
intn their administration.
Wnen nominations were called for Carl
Abbott named Seth Mann for Mayor, and
the nomination was made by declamation.
Mr. Mann was called for and made a little
speech.
Hiram A. Luttrell nominated Thomas
F. Garrity for City Attorney, and the
choice was made unanimous.
George Earl and It. M. Turner were
nominated for Councilman at large. The
other two nominations are to be made by
the Cily Central Committee.
John A. Bntton, J. Chestnut, J. W
Evans a.id W. H. O'Brien were nominated
for School Directors at large. A delegate
wanted to know why Chestnut and Evans
and Britton, Deing not Democrats, should
be nominated, and Chestnut was with
drawn. J. W. Evans was voted down and
the choice eventually fell upon W. H.
O'Brien, John Britton, John Buss and Dr.
Myra Knox.
For Library Trusteesâ Dr. J. M. Shan
non, J. Bullock, B. A. Rabe, Lewis Anken
and M. H. Bran.
**or Ward Councilmen ther following
nominations were made: First Ward â
James Hetmebeiry; Second Ward, F. R.
Girard; Third Ward, J. C. McLeod;
Fourth Ward, C. H. Brosnahan; Fifth
Ward, Aron Kibosh; Sixth Ward, E. A.
Stanley; Seventh Ward, H. P. Capell.
For School Directors from warts the
following wore nominated: First W;ird,
K. Fiege; Second Ward, E. B.Clement;
Third Wan!, Henry GooJ-eH; Fourth
War,i. C. W. Losan; Fihh Ward, F. M.
Weston; Sixth Ward, EL Bachrach; Sev
enth, Dr. W. J. Wilcox.
The new city central committee was ap
pointed as follow*: -First Ward, F. W.
Leonard and R. Wallace; Second Ward,
J. E. Erijuon and J. T. Smith; Third
Ward, Morns Aker'y and A. T. McDon
ougli â¢ Fourth Ward, M. J. Holland and
P. Gallagher; Fifth Wan, R. M Fitz
serald ;t;id W. H. High Jr. ; Sixth Ward,
James Giliisan and James Stanley; Sev
enth Ward, M. J. Croaks and Victor
Giiardin.
Carl Abbott moved that Montgomery
Clement be nominated for City Engineer.
Another delegate nominated R. M.
Clement, and it was discovered that both
men were The sanv and the nomination
was made unanimous.
The City Central Committee was em
powered to complete the ticKet Dy nomi
nating two Councilmen at large, Auditor
and Treasurer.
The convention adjourned at 10:15, hay-
ing made a record for being the most ex
neditious municipal convention ever held
in thi* city.
There is a contention by well-Informed
people here that the nominee of the
Democratic convention this evening for
the office of City Attorney. Thomas F.
Gnrrhy, is ineligible to the office he peeks.
There ia a clause in the charier of the city
which plainly says that the City Attorney
must have been a practicing lawyer of the
.Suite for live years previous to his elec
tion. The charter is so very plain that
the only way to escape its provisions is to
attack the clause on ttie ground of nn
constitutionality, but undoubtedly Mr.
Garrity will, ii elected, have a contest on
his hands.
CITIZENS DO NOTHING.

mlttee of Sevan.

zens' party met to-nieht in Elite Hall and
there was a fair attendance of delegates.
James La Rue was called to the chair, and
an informal discussion was held as to the
method of procedure.
It was the sense of the majority that no
nominations be made, but that a commit
tee be appointed lo attend the Democratic
convention and secure the best agreement
tbey could. No one seemed to under
stand iust wnat the duties of the commit
tee consisted of, and it was explained that
they were io see what the Democrats
would do in the way of sharing nomina
tions. After the appointment of the com
mittee the convention adjourned to meet
again to hear its report. It consistpd of:
First Ward, G. W. Drake; Second Ward,
J. Rutherford; Third Ward, A. Stillraan;
Fourth Ward, D. H. Priest; Fiith Ward,
G. Fo"g; Sixih Ward, A. Rugolsky; Sev
enth Ward, P. H. Stokes.
The committee attended the Demo
cratic convention and their presence was
announced but no notice was taken of
them, and when Carl Abbott nominated
Seth Mann for Mayor he laid such stress
upon the folly of going outside the party
that the Citizens' committee withdrew
and were not heard from. It is not known
what programme toe Citizens' party will
follow to-morrow night wnen they hear
the report of the committee.

DID NORDHAUSEN
COMMIT SUICIDE?
Detective Whitaker Says
He Will Prove That
He Did.
Captain Lees Has Also Arrived
at the Same Final
Conclusion.
The Inquest Win Take Place Tc-Day,
When Lfght Ma 7Be Thrown
on the Mystery,
The inquest on the body ol C. C. Nord
hausen, the Oakland capitalist, will be
held this morning by Coroner Hawkins,
and Detective Ross Whitaker, who has
been steadily working on the case, says
he will be able to show conclusively that
it was not murder but suicide, and Cap
tain LeÂ«3 shares his views.
The facts that bear upon this positive
statement of tba police have already been
published, but something was developed
yesterday that strengthens their views.;
At the time Nordhauaen was taken from
the room a partial examination could
only be made as the room was almost
immediately occupied by a gentleman
and his wife. Manager Lake told Detec
tive Whitaker that as soon as the room
was empty he would notify him and a
thorough search could be made. Yester
day afternoon word was sent to Whitaker
that the room was empty and he at once
went to examine it, accompanied by Lake,
when an important discovery was made.
A hole made by a bullet was noticed in
the curtain of the window and a hole in
the glass of the window made by the
same bullet. Tim led to the conclusion
that ?vordhausen had tired two shots, the
first probably glancing off his forehead
and passing through the curtain and win
dow.
It is assumed that Nordhauaen had
been stretched on the lounge when he
tired the first shot. That position would
account for the course of the first bullet,
the lounge being under the window, and
would also account for the empty shell
found in the bathtub, which corresponds
with the cartridges found in the revolver.
Finding that tne first shot aimed at his
skull had not taken effect, Nordhaasen
Dad thrown the empty shell into the bath
tub and h;iÂ«l loaded the revolver in every
chamber. Then he fired the shot at bis
heart, which took effect and proved fatal.
It is presumed that after wounding
himself In the forehead he wiped the
blood off with the towels found in the
room, one of which was seen tied around
his forehead on the occasions when the
bellboys took drinks into his room.
Four cartridges were found in a bureau
drawer in Noruhausen's room ; there were
four in the revolver, and the shell found
in the bathtub and the one in the re
volver would *how that he tiad two
rounds of ammunition with him.
All these facts, according to tne police,
disprove tho theory advanced by the
doctors that Norlhausen was shot out
side of the hotel.
There is some mystery about the
woman living in a room immediately
above Nortlhausen's who heard a shot
lired about 2 o'clock .Monday morning.
Manager Lake refused to cive Detective
Whitaker the name of the woman, al
though it was pointed out to him that her
testimony would be of the utmost im
portance.
ROBBED IN OAKLAND.
C. C. Nordhausen Told a Peculiar
Story to a Landlady.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â Mrs. Lamp,
ing, who helps her mother to keep a lodg
ing-house at 476 Twelfth street, told a
story to-day that throws much light upon
the tragedy in which C. C. Nordhausen
was the central figure.
"Mr. Nordnausen was at the foot of the
stairs about half-past 12 on Friday morn
ing," said Mrs. Lamping. "He was so in
toxicated that he could hardly stand, and
with the assistance of a Gentleman who
saw the condition of affairs, I helped him
ui> the stairs and my mother put him in
a room, lie slept till about noon of Fri
day and when he got up he said that lie
would like to talk to me. His ciothes
were very dirty, as if he had been rolled
in the mud and there was blood on his
mustache and his face. When I looked
at the bed I saw that there was also blood
on the pillow and I thought that bis
nose had been bleeding, but it may have
been from other causes.
"When i went into his room he was
very nervous, and it was with difficulty
that he could express himself clearly. He
told me that he had been drinking, and
had decided to quit I told him that was
the best thine to do, and then suggested
to him that a man with as much money
as he had should get married, as he was
well able to look after a wife. He was a
frequent patrou of this house before he
went to Randsburg, and we all thoueht he
was a single man, and much to my sur
prise he told me that he was already mar
ried. He asked me if he came to the
house alone, and 1 told him that he did,
and he then said that he had been robbed
by two women in a restaurant. He said
he did not know who they were, as he had
never seen them before, but only met
them casually. He told me that they
â¢touched' him for $50, and that he did not
know how or where he had parted from
them. He talKed about his Randsburg
property, and said that it was a good
thing, and he intended to do all he could
down there. He seemed thoroughly
broken up, and convinced me that lie was
sincere in his desire to reform and quit
drinking. He felt his position keenly,
and told me that he intended to go to
Randsburg Saturday, and that if he did
not go he would return to his room at
night.
"He was never intoxicated to my knowl
edge before last Friday morning, and
always behaved like a gentleman. No one
thought his taking a room here at all un
usual, as it was not kuown that he was a
married man. He seemed to enjoy life
and was a good-natured feliow, and 1
never saw him the least bit blue until
Friday, when ue really seemed anxious to
quit drinking."
The body of the deceased was brought
to this city last night by ex-Coroner Evers,
who will conduct the funeral to-morrow
afternoon.
Mr. Evers said this morning that during
his many years as Coroner of this county
he hud seen numerous cases of violeut
death, and he says that the wound on Mr.
Nofdhausen's forehead was not caused by a
simple fall. He feels confident that others
are concerned in his death.

Sudden Death of CLarles W Peterson.
Mr. Tremor Objjcts to the
Odor of Horseflesh.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 28.â The body of
Charles W. Peterson was found on the
floor of the basement of his residence,
2317 Eagle .avenue, by Robert Richardson,
the expressman. Peterson's wife died
August 8 last and this had a very depress
ing effect upon him. Many times be has
been heard to say, "Mamma calls me
every night to come to her and some night
lam going to her." Last Thursday he
said to Mr. Hadley of the Pacific Hotel
cafe, "If this don't go I will have to go."
Tnese remarks were repeated by others
upon the street to-day and cansed many
to believe that Mr. Peterson had com
mitted suicide.
However, this was not the case, as was
proved by the autopsy held by Drs. Pond
and Keys this afternoon. An inquest was
held at 4 o'clock: with Charles Day, R. B.
Tappan, M. W. Simpson, Seymour Her
bert, 8. Stephenson, Robert Collins, D. W.
Martin and William Higby as jurors. The
testimony of the doctors showed that
death ensued from an apoplectic fit.
The body was in such a position when
found as to lead to the conclusion that
Peterson had been lying upon the bed,
and, upon arising, bad fallen to the floor,
striking his head upon the bedstead.
The deceased was 56 years old. He was
master of finances of Alameda Lodge No.

DRIVING CAPITAL
FROM THE STATE
Robert Watt on the Effect
of Mead's Assembly
Bill.
Would Prevent the Future Rail
road Development of
California.
Proposed Law Prohibiting Issuance
.f Bonds Exceeding 90 Per Cent
of Valuation.
Tne several bills pending before the
State Legislature inimical to tbe San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road, and all other railroads that may be
built in California in tbe future, are not
worrying the Valley Railroad officials.
As stated in yesterday's Call one of
these bills makes it unlawful for any
Board of Supervisors to grant to any rail
road company a franchise over any coun
ty road except to cross it; another pro
hibits companies issuing bonds in a total
amount greater than 90 per cent of the
cost of the corporate plant or of property
on tbe security of which bonds are issued;
and still another I ill is in regard to court
costs.
Vice-President Robert Watt of the Val
ley road said yesterday afternoon :
"Mead's bill in rejrnrd to the issuance of
bonds is, of all these proposed measures,
particularly disadvantageous to us or any
other railroad that may be built in the
Staie. While the use of small portions of
a count.v road here and there might facili
tate the mpurinc of rights of way and ex
tension o!' track, prohibition of such use
would not be an insurmountable obstacle.
"But the proposed bill in reiation to
bonds is Beriously objectionable for several
reasons. It will keep a lar^e amount of
Eastern capital out of California and
seriously dÂ«;)ay, or entirely prevent, rail
road development in tbe State. It would
be more difficult to place bonds under
such a clause. It would compel money
looking for investment to make extensive
and careful investigation of all property
franchises and assets of whatever nature.
"This would pat the investor to a great
deal of trouble, from which, hie would
naturally shrink. What would be the re
sult? He would seek investments on
which it would be easier for him to inform
himself, and his money would go else
where than in California railroads. As far
as the 90 per cent valuation is concerned
that would not affect us, as we do not con
template issuing bonds to exceed 66 per
cent. Investors in bonds in tne market
will not go to the trouble of making ex
tensive investigations and the result will
be that the bonds will be let alone.
"We have no lobbyists at Sacramento
now, " he continued, "and we do not ex
pect to have any. When the time comes
lor hearing on these bills we shall be
rf presented at tbe Legislature and what
we have to say will be said in open meet
ing."

DEATH CAME
AT NIGHT
A. Loughborough Suddenly
Stricken Down by
Apoplexy.
IT CAME SWIFT AS A
BLOW.
He Had Not Been Ailing and
the Stroke Was Unex
pected.
A LAWYER WÂ£LL KNOWN IN
THIS CITY.
He Wa> Born in Virginia, but Has
Practiced Here Since the
E rly Sixties.
A. H. Louehborough, who for years has
been one of the prominent ticureÂ« of the
San Francisco bar, died suddenly last
night from a strobe of apoplexy.
He was at his residence, 1100 O'Farrell
street, and had retired some time before.
His wife, who was in an adjoining room,
heard him breathing heavily, and on goin>;
in to see what was the matter sue found
her husband lying on his back, his face
almost purple, and giving every sign of
that dread disease, apoplexy.
She called her son George and he was
at once sent for Dr. Kobinson. He re
turned with the physician within a few
minute-, but in the meantime the attor
ney bad died.
Mr. Loughborough had not been ailing,
in fact he has been enjoying unusually
good health for some time past, and his
sudden end came heavy and swiit as a
blow unon his family.
A. H. Loughborongh was 62 years of
age. He was born in Warren ton, Va.,
October 17, 1834. and came to this State in
IS6I. lie has been practicing law in this
City for a great many years and his name
figures on either one side or the other of
the biggest actions that have appeared in
the courts of California.
He went into partnership with Julius
George on his arrival in this Stale, but
that partnership was dissolved two years
later, when he returned to West Virginia,
to Wheeling, to be married.
After bis marriage he removed to Balti
more, Md., where he practiced law for
four years. Then ne returned to this City
and resumed his practice here.
He was a hard student and he gave to
his cases the greatest care and attention.
He was a good court lawyer, but of late
years his business has not been so much
in court as in his office. He was known
to be particularly good in probate cases
and his probate business was in conse
quence very large.
He leaves a widow and three children,

FISHER'S EXPLANATION.
His Absence Due to I Iness and
Not to a Wish to Defraud
Creditors.
Papers Served Upon Him Yesterday
in the Fair Estate and Divorce
Proceedings.
Will E. Fisher, the real estate agent
whose business and domestic difficulties
have furnished much food lor discussion
and speculation of late, yesterday re
turned to thi9 City and visited his
office, 14 Post street, and early in the day
accepted service of papers in re the Fair
estate claim for office rent and the divorce
proceedings instituted by his wife.
He was seen during the afternoon by a
Call reporter, to whom he made the fol
lowing verbal statement and explanation
of his actions since the date of his disap
pearance:
"A great many things have been said
and undoubtedly many of them have
been exaggerated. I regret sincerely that
illness compelled my departure, out pos
sibly in the long run it maybe for tne
best. For two years and a half I have car
ried a load upon my shoulders. It was
bound to become too weighty, and the
end came as 1 anticipated. My pride pre
vented me from going into insolvency.
When my former partner. Henry A.
Smith, endeavored to influence me to do
that I refused to do so, and he went into
insolvency himself. Most of the firm's
debts were contracted during the period
of the copartnership between us.
"A great many published statements
have been made regarding my wife â to me
the dearest woman on earth. She has
kindly come forward on two occasions and
assisted me. Once she indorsed notes to

the extent of $13,000 and the last time
gave me $5000.
"Had I gone into insolvency when Mr.
Smith did I shonld only have bad to pay
mv proportion of the liabilities, which
would have been a very small sum. My
indebtedness to my wife has been greatly
exaggerated, as also that of the firm,
"With respect to the divorce proceed
ings against me I have only to say that I
reeret the fact exceedingly. I Jove my
wife. But I have no desire to discuss my
private and family affairs, which concern
only myself and wife and in which the
public is not interested. However, I de
plore the position she has taken in tiiis
matter and am forced to ascribe it to cer
tain influences antagonistic to myself
which have been brought to bear upon
her.
"Another source of profound regret is
my departure from San Francisco. 1 did
not leave the City with the intention of
running away. The truth is I have been
sick for a period of seven weeks with the
grippe, under the caro of Dr. Bushnell,
and liave been in no position to present
myself before creditors, attorneys and
others. So I placed the whoie matt rin
the hands of my lawyer, C. H. Shurtl ff,
and left for Stockton to meet my old
friend, Joe Nye. Alter reaching Stockton
I was seized with nervous prostration and
constrain d to occuty my room for six
days. On being shown ths papers whicii,
in many item?, publicly branded me as a
criminal I determined to return, face the
music and be ready for all comers."
Mr. Fislier spoke of his business mis
fortunes, which he attributed to misfor
tune. "1 could not make a success of the
real estate business," said he. "No mat
ter how hard I tried, with debts hanging
over me, and realizing that everything I
made was for the purpose of paying off a
dead horse. It is not my purpose to be
dishonest and I have come back to San
Francisco to stand by my creditors and, if
they will have conriience in me, I think
that I can bring them out all right. Other
men have failed in this and other busi
nesses. My misfortune was due to delay
in bringing my creditors together. I be
lieve 1 am thorougly competent in the
real estate busines?; there are few in it
to-day who have remained in it as long
as I.
"I have accepted papers of service in the
suit of the FÂ«ir estate and the divorce
proceeding instituted by my wife."

city in the East. The time and place of
this gathering bas not yet been selected.
At the conclusion of the business the
body adjourned to the banquet hall, where
there were spread such good things as
would best tempt the appetites of the
banqueter?. The banquet committee con

CARNIVAL TAKING SHAPE.
Meeting of the Cycle Board of Trade.
Odd Fellows to Convene.
The inclement weather militated against
the attendance at the meeting of the
Cycle Board of Trade called for last nieut
to discuss the various features for "Bicy
cle day" during Carnival week. No at
tempt was made to organize the bicycle
division, but a general discussion of the
features that wouia attract the most at
tention was held. Secretary Hamilton
reported that all the members of his or
ganization were thoroughly in eccord
with the proposition and would render all
the assistance possible to make it a grand
success. The matter of bringing out a
number of crack Eastern riders 10 partici
pate in the various races and the possibil-
ity of securing the opening of the National
circuit on that day was discussed. After
some talk over the various features it was
decided io call another meeting for next
Thursday uighl at the assembly-rooms of
the California Hotel.
A letter was received at Carnival head
quarters from the Los Angeles fiesta com
mittee thanking the local committee for
postponing the carnival until the week
following theirs. The Los An^e'es people
have very generously offered to advertise
the fact that San Francisco's festival will
follow theirs and promise to render every
assistance in their power. One significant
fact contained in the letter was that over
2000 letters of inquiry regarding Southern
California were received in the two
months preceding the fiesta held last
spring in Los Angeles.
General Wartield, Carnival Director
Friedlander and Messrs. Boldeman, Fisher
and Hess w*Â»re appointed a committee to
attend the OJd Fellows' carnival conven
tion, to be held at Fraternal Hall, Odd
Fellows' building, next Saturday evening.
The grand officers of the Odd Fellows an

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 29, 1897.
NO OPEN SEASON
FOR FEMALE SEALS
Professor Jordan Makes
Some Important Rec
ommendations.
If the Herds Are to Bs Pre
served They Must Be
Well Cared For.
Considers the Proposition to Destroy
Seal Herds as Nothing Less
Than Monstrous.
Professor David Starr Jordan has pre
pared and sent to Secretary Carlisle a re
port of his observations on the fur seals of
Bering Sea, made by him last summer, in
accordance with a Congressional resolu
tion. The report is given as merely.pre
liminary, indicating that it may be elabo
rated upon later, but it deals quite iully
with the practical matters involved in the
preservation of the fur seal.
Any approach to a census of the fur seal
would have been impossible before the
present depleted condition of the rook
eries was reached, and an accurate census
now is almost an impossibility says the
report, but an attempt -was made at count
ing on the rookeries. Some 5000 harems
were numbered, with 81,793 cows, making
a total of 143,071.
The report says further:
The changes in the breeding herd from year
to year lie in the following elements :
1. The addition of the three-year-old females
who bear their first pups.
2. The loss of females killed at sea in the pre
vious fail, those killed in the spring, those
killed by the bulls and those destroyed by nat
ural causes. Keeping these elements in mind
we may attempt a comparison between the
breeding heids or 1895 and those oi 18UU.
In 1896 30,000 Killab c males were taken,
22,000 of these, to the bust of our information,
being three-year-olds. Some 2000 or 3000
more of these are. left, while neariy as many
more were killed in 1895 as "ione" two-year
olds. Of male pups born in 1893, therefore,
about 26,000 survived until they becaiuo till
able. As many three-year old leinales entered
the rookeries to bear their first pups in 1896.
These numbers represent something less than
a third of tfje pups born in 1893.
A tabulation of the gaius and losses from
1895 to 1896 would run as follows:
Gainsâ Three-year-ola females bearing their
first, pup (about) 26,000
Lossâ Females killed at sea, August, 1895
(about) '23,000
Females killed at sea, April, 1896 (about). . 8,000
Females shot at sea and lo.it. unre corded
(about) 6,000
Females killed by bulls, 1896 130
Females lost at sea by natural causes, un
recorded (about) 10,000
Total 46.130
Estimated net loss for 1896, 12i/fe per ceot
of total breeding cows 20 130
Pelagic sealing In Bering Sea in August is in
the highest degree destructive to the herd. If
considered as an industry it is a suicidal one,
as it can be profitably continued only under
conditions which must bring it to a speedy
end. Pelagic sealing is therefore not properly
an industry at all, as it adds nothing to the
wealth of the world. Since il began more than
600,000 fur seals bave been taken in the North
Pacific and in Bering Sea. This means the
death of not less than 400,000 breeding fe
males, the starvation oi 300,000 pups, and the
destruction of 400,000 pups still unborn. In
this calculation account is taken only of those
oi which the skins have been brought to mar
ket. No record of the animals lost after being
shot .or speared is available, though the num
ber is known to be very great.
Pelagic sealing, in the j udgment of the mem
bers of the present commission, has been the
sole cause of the continued decline of the lur
seal herds. It is at present the sole obstacle
to their restoration and the sole limit to their
indefinite increase. It is thcreiore evident
that no settlement of the fur-sea! question as
regards either the American or trio Russian
inlands can be permanent unless it shall pro
vide for the cessation of the indiscriminate
killing of fur seals, both on thp feeding
grounds and on tneir migiations. There can
MADAME LASSAUGUE.
Mme. Lassaugue, a well-known singer and professor of singing in Paris and
London, has just arrived in this City with ihe intention of settling here. She is
the daughter of the late James Berry Greening, for twenty-three years editor of
the London Punch, and in her childhood she was brought in contact with some of
the brightest literary and musical people of the time. Among the other visitors
to the home of James Berry Greening was the famous singer Titiens, and when
Miss Greening was a very young girl, Titiens, who had heard her sing, and was
charmed with her voice, persuaded the editor of Punch to let her daughter study
seriously for the concert and operatic stage. She went to the Paris Conservatory,
where she graduated as a laureate, and directly after made her debut on the Lon-
don concert stage wicn great success. Miss Greening was also a great favorite in
Paris, where she sans frequently in opera, her repertoire including such works as
"La Sonnambula," Gounod's "Mirella," etc One o' her most successful roles was
that of Marguerite of Valo : .s in the "Huguenots." Mme. Greening Lassaugue
has sung more than once in America, always with success. Some years ago she
was persuaded to settle for a timo In Los Angeles, where leading business men in-
duced her to found a college of music, for which they guaranteed a substantial
fund. After remaining in Los Angeles for four years she returned to Europe, but
bas now come back to California to stay.
be no "open season" for the killing of females
if the heard is to be kept intact.
Continuous investigation is recommended.
The herd should oe treated as a breeding herd
of cattle or horses would be. It should be un
der the immediate control each summer of a
competent naturalist, who shonld devote his
energies to the study of the needs of the herd,
its preservation, increase and possible im
provement
Deprecating reference is made to the
traps set for seals and to the great mortal
ity of pupa from starvation, resulting from
the death of their mothers.
Much important information is eiven
concerning the habits of the seal bearine
upon the perpetuation of tho herds, and
in concluding Professor Jordan says:
I may here express my feeling that the
monstrous proposition to destroy the senl herd
because it has been injured by pelagic sealing
ought uot to be considered for a moment. It
would be a confession of impotence uuworthy
of a great ana civilized Nation. Its result
would be to transier 10 ourselves any odium
which has deservedly fallen upon those who
would recklessly destroy a most useful and a
most interesting race oi animals.
If extreme action be thought necessary the
safe and effective method of branding the
female pups could be tried. But this ought
uever to become necessary.

SUES THE SHEEIfF.
That Officer Sold Mortgaged Property
and is Agked to Pay tbe Mortgage.
Wing & Hornblower, attorneys for Ce
line Anderson, have brought suit for
their client to recover $500 and interest
on a mortgage held by her on the iurni
ture of the Hichelieu Restaurant, 118 Ellis
street, which was sold by the Sheriff
under an execution issued at the suit of
E. Mv Ratto against L. Berge and his wife.
Mr. and Mrs. Berge conducted a French
restaurant on Ellis street, and last No
vember executed a chattel mortgage to
Mrs. Anderson for $500, money advanced
by her to them for fatting up and running
the place.
The Berges gave a note, secured by a
mortgage on the furniture, for the amount
of iheir indebtedness on November 11,
1896, recording it on that day. Later they
became involved and certain creditors as
signing their claims to E. M. Ratto, he
attached their furniture and obtaining
judgment directed the Sheriff to sell the
same.
The attorneys for Mrs. Anderson claim
that before the Sheriff can seize by at
tachment or execution any personal prop
erty mortgaged, he must pay the mort
gagee the amount of the mortgage debt.

FOUND THE WILL
OF A RICH ESTATE
Louis F. Reichling Left All
His Property to
Cousins.
Owned a Large Interest in the
Famous Kennedy Mining
Company.
Possessed Other Property and Lately
Fell Heir to a Third of His
Father's Estate.
On Wednesday last Albert H. Reichling,
brother of the late Louis F. Reichling,
filed a petition for special letters of ad
ministration on his estate, through
Adams <fc Adams, his attDrneys. The
following morning the will was discov
ered. It was found to leave $10,000 to
Cornelia Theurkauf, a cousin of the de
ceased, who lives in Cincinnati. His
mineral cabinet waa bequeathed to the
California Academy of Sciences, and all
the remainder of his property, including
his one-third Interest in tne estate of
Francis Reichling, his father, who died
only a short time before him, was be
queathed to his cousin, Miss Lillie Theur

George Goodman, a director of the
Kennedy Mining and Milling Company
and manufacturer of artificial stone, and
Lillie Tiieurkauf are made the executors
of tne wm without bonds.
Ex- Superior Judge J. F. Davis of Jack

mediately filed the will here yesterday
aiternoon for probate. He also filed a
petition for special letters of administra
tion in behalf of Mr. Goodman, tbe
executor. The estate is a large one, as all
persons who were acquainted. with Albert
Reichiing and his interests will be aware.
He was a heavy owner in the rich Ken
nedy mine, of which he was secretary.
He also owned large interests in other
mines, besides other property. It would
not be surprising if the estate turned out
to be worth $100,000 or more.

CATHEDRAL COUNCIL.
It Will Absorb the Membership of Ber- j
mingham Council, Young Men's
Institute, No. 59.
Despite the very inclement weather last ;
night there was a large attendance at the
prelim inaiy meeting held in the basement
of St. Mary's Cathedral, for the purpose
of taking steps to institute the new coun- '
cil of the Young Men's Institute in the
cathedral parish. j
The meeting was presided over by the j
Rev. Father Dempsey, and the only busi- '
ness transacted was the reception of the j
applications of those who wish to become
members of the council.
This council will be called Cathedral
Council and will have the members now
held by Bermingham Council No. 59. This
last-named council was not numerically
as strong as it was thought it ought to be, j
and it was suggested that it be merged i
into the new council that was being or- j
ganized in the Cathedral parish. - The
suggestion was accepted and steps were â 
then taken to perfect arrangements for
the consolidation. . .â  .' â 
At a future meeting those whose appli
cations have been favorably passed upon
will be organized, then initiations, insti
tution and election of officers will follow.
The expectation is that the new council
will have about 100 members.

violating the health ordinance. Solomon was
the owner of a diseased cow, which he gave to
Herman Vogel, a neighboring butcher, to kill.
VoÃel was arrested and â¢ was fined $100 by
Judge Conlan. In court he pleaded as an ex
cuse that he had killed the cow for Solomon,
which led to Solomon's arrest.
