SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 5.
In its wild despair and rage over
being shown up as a malignant
faker, the Examiner struck out
blindly, hitting all who refused to
become a party to its attempt to
quash the bribery investigation or
to blind the real issue. Among
others it maligned were Senator
Voorheis and Judge Frick. Both
took steps to-day to even up the
matter.
On the floor of the Senate this
afternoon, Senator Voorheis rose to
a question of privilege, and spoke
as follows :
"1 desire to rise to a question of
personal privilege. I noticed in the
Examiner of this morning that I
was accused of leaving Sacramento
to avoid being subpenaed in the in
vestijjatidn which is now pending
in the Senate and Assembly. 1 de
sire to state that my absence from
Sacramento was on purely business
of my own, and the statement in
the Examiner that I left to avoid
being subpenaed 'is a falsehood pure
and simple.
" 1 desire to make that statement
to the Senate, for the paper that
goes broadcast and carries every
where such malignant statements
should be denied representation in
this Senate and Assembly. Its
statements are malignant falsehoods
from- first to last."
Judge Frick took a more drastic
course. To-day he telegraphed his
law partner to begin a libel suit
against the Examiner for $50,000
for the defamatory matter published
in its columns this morning.
Two hot-worded altercations also
took place here to-day as the result
of the scurrilous attacks this morn
ing on witnesses before the Assem
bly Investigating Committee. One
was between Frank Moffitt of Oak
land and Andy M. Lawrence, and
which nearly resulted in blows.
The other was between Judge Frick
and- Andrew J. Clunie, in which the
lie was given Clunie.
( " LONG GREEN " CONFESSES
\The Managing FakÂ»r of the Ex
aminer Admits That He Had No
Foundation for the Libel.
SACRAMENTO, Cau, March s.â The
Assembly committee investigating the
Examiner libel fonnd out something to
day. It found that the article accusing
the Senators and Assemblymen of being a
pack of bribe-takers was written upon
nimor, and that it was published witn the
full knowledge and approval of Andy M.
Lawrence, managing editor of the monarch
of the "new fake journalism."
Assemblyman Valentine conducted the
case for tne Assembly commi'lee, and
Andy Clunie had the impudence to ques
tion Valentine's right to be there. Lev
ings, the author of the article, could not
give tne committee any information. He
claimed to bare a tip that Mr. Hayward
had sent a dispatcn to Senator Voorheis,
and the Examiner at once jumped to the
conclusion that it was a proposal to bribe
the Senator- to vote for Caminetti's bill
No. 273.
Manager Jaynes of the Western Union
office produced the telegram, under pain of
contempt in case of his refusal to do so,
and it proved to be a request from Mr.
Hayward to do what hÂ« could la favor of
Senator Wolfe's bill on corporation's sole,
in which Aich bishop Riordan was said to
i be interested and to desire its passage.
J The bill was a perfectly honest ana legiti
' mate one.
Judge Frick produced copies of tele
prams which had passed between him and
George W. Baker, attorney for the Liquor
dealers' Association, which was interested
in No. 273, and theÂ«e proved to be open
and above board. They are published in
full in this article.
The Examiner's attorneys displayed so
much anxiety to conceal the fact that the
The San Francisco Call
libel was not founded upon even a cobweb
that the crowd broke into rude laughter
several times while Clunie was trying to
bamboozle the committee and while
Knight was growing red in the face with
the effort to preserve a grave countenance
while the farce was going on.
Senator Voorheis, again-t whom the
bulk of the Examiner's insinuations had
been directed, swore that no menaces
whatever had passed between him ami
Mr. Hay ward or any other person regard
ing bill 273, and drove the cowardly lie
deep down into the throat of the fake or
gan.
Managing Editor Lawrence looked dis
tressed at the plight into which he had
got the paper, and showed bis teeth
threateningly to the committee on one
occasion when he lost his temper.
Isador Alexander testified that he was a
correspondent of the Examiner, and had
been acting as such during the present
session of the Legislature. He did not
write the article in the Examiner, did not
know who wrote it and did not know any
of the facts stated in the libelous article.
E. H. Hamilton of the Examiner denied
that he was the author of the article or
thai he knew who was, or that he was ac
quainted with any of the facts.
"Do you know," a?kecl Valentine, "of
any bribery done here in connection with
any member of the Assembly . relative to
Assembly bill 273?"
"I don't recall any knowledge that
would throw any light on the subject,"
replied Hamilton.
"Do you know of any bribery at all con
cerning this Assembly bill 273? D d you
have any information at the time this arti
cle was written, or have you acquired any
information since, in relation to the charge
of bribery?"
"I don't believe I read the article," re
plied Hamilton.
"Do you know who prepared the article
or where it wai prepared?"
"No."
"You know absolutely nothing about
it?"
"No."
"Nor as to who caused it to be written
or put in the paper?"
"I haven't the faintest idea."
"Who has charge of that department?"
"Mr. Lawrence is the managing editor.
The coast editor receives the matter sent
by telegraph?"
Alvinza Hayward was recalled and was
asked whether he knew anything in con
nection with the preparation of the arti- \
cle. He replied that he did not, and Hill
explained that Mr. Hayward was not a
member of the Examiner staff.
Mr. Hayward in response to further
questions by Valentine paid that he knew
absolutely nothing concerning the alleged
bribery.
Andrew M. Lawrence, managing editor
of the Examiner, confessed to that fact
under oath. He said that in important
matters other members of the staff were
called in for consultation with the editor.
"Do yon know who published the arti
cle in the Examiner February 27?"
"Only by hesrsay," replied Lawrence.
"Did yon prepare it yourself?"
"No, sir; I received., information that
f<n, ? teJegrenis passed between Senator
Voorheis and', Alvinza Hayward, and' I
was told that if Iwe could get those t?le
erams they would show corruption in the
Legislature."
"Who gave you that information?" was
asked.
The witness became suddenly dumb
and cast an appealing look toward Clunie
and Knight.
Knight shook his head as a tip to the
witness not to answer. They held a whis
peied conference, and while they were in
consultation Assemblyman Clarke said:
"I thought you wanted to' give us. all
the information in your power?"
"You will get all you want before you
get through," retorted Lawrence de
fiantly.
"There will be another investigating
committee," said Ciunie insolently, "and
you know what that means."
"From whom did you receive that in
formation?" Lawrence was asked again.
"From one of the members of the staff,"
was the reply.
"What was his name?"
Clunie interposed with an objection.
He said that W. R. Hearst was the only
person who had authority to divulge his
own secrets. It was a confidential mat
ter.
Belshaw said that he wanted to get at
the bottom of the investigation, "and if
it is all hearsay evidence we want . to
know it." â 
Hill said that the object of the question
was to find the name of the member of
the staff so that they could get him as a
witness and find out what he knew about
the matter.
It seemed to Belshaw that the Exam
iner must have known that the article
was true before it was published, and if
the Examiner people had thai proof they
should put nothing in the way of this in
vestieation.
'â¢The Examiner said that it was beyond
the shadow of a doubt that members of
the Legislature were bribed to support
Assembly bill 273," said Valentine. "If
the gentleman will give us the informa
tion. If he will tell us what members of
the Assembly were implicated, so that we
can proceed, very well. We muÂ«t get to
the man from whom he obtained this in
formation, and follow it up so that we
can pin this charge to the man whom thÂ«
Examiner represents in this libel."
Here ; Clunie got a chance to make an
other bluff, and be took it. "If you will
have Mr. Jaynes produce those telegrams
you will find the worst state of corruption
that ever existed," he said.
Valentine proceeded with the examina
tion of Lawrence.
"You say there are four gentlemen who
sometimes assisted the editor 'in the
preparation of those matters?"
C'unie objected again. He did not want
the faking machinery of the Examiner
exposed. * . â¢'â ,' -.*".' Â£
Valentine quietly suggested that if the
Examiner would give the names of its in
formants to the committee .the work of
the investigation would be rendered very
easy. All that the committee wanted
was the: truth.
"I cannot see for the life of me," he
added, "why the Examiner is hiding itself
behind technicalities. The Examiner is not
on trial,".he siad. , "The : Examiner took
the initiative in this matter and said that
it was positive as to the fact?. If the
Examiner could make that assertion it
undoubtedly- had the names of the men
concerned, the places and the ' circum
stances of , the bribery to back it." -.
Lawrence still refused to answer the
questions. 'Â£Vv : i , , , . ,
"What was the information thus ob
tained?" asked Valentine. ,
; Clunie fell into a man trap here for he

objected to the question on the ground
that the answer would be hearsay, thus
admitting that the Examiner had libeled
the Lecislature upon mere rumor and
hearsay.
"Did you yourself have any hand in the
preparation of this article or auy part of
it?" asked Valentine.
Clunie objected again, but Lawrence im
patiently replied that he had had no band
in the preparation of the article. He
added that he hart not assisted in the
preparation of any portion of the article.
Then Valentine turned loose the ava
lanche that buried the Examiner.
"Did you know of the offer or the pay
ment of any money to any member of the
Assembly in relation to bill 273?"
"No," now replied the manager editor
of the Examiner, thus confessing that his
paper huct deliberately und maliciously
faked a libel.
A murmur of surprise arose from the ;
audience at the shameless avowal and at j
the stupidity of the Examiner's counsel j
in having failed to object to a Question of :
auch tremendous importance to the issue
involved.
Valentine followed up the question with ;
another pf eqnal imiji rfance
"All tue in form at ion on which thin 1
article was published is hearsay, and only
hearsay?" he asked.
"Yes," replied Lawrence.
"Did you see the messages that were i
said to have passed between Mr. Hayward
and Senator Voorheis?"
"No, sir."
"Did yon know the contents of those
messages?"
Here Knight recovered from the stupor
in which he had been thrown by the
knockout blow flelivertd on the Examiner
by the manager of that paper, and ob
jected.
Valentine asked if the Examiner people
were so anxious to prove the truth of the
libelous statement that corruption ex
isted beyond the shadow of a doubt why
did they attempt to throw the committee
off on the telegrams and yet refuse to
give the committee the information in
their possession.
"All we want of the Examiner people is
to tell us this testimony which estab
lisned in their minds beyond the shadow
of a doubt that ' this bribery existed. We
are inviting the Examiner to assist us in
this instead of throwing obstacles in our
way."
"Did you authorize the publication of
that article in the Examiner ?" asked Hill.
Here Clunie awoke from his ten seconds'
trance and objected, and the committee
dropped Lawrence. They had squeezed
out of him a confession that the libel was
a take, built upon the airy foundation of
rumor, and they smiled at the expression
of consternation depicted upon the coun
tenances of Clunie and Knight.
Frank Jaynes, general manager of the
Western Union Teleeraph Company, took
the stand and produced a dispatch from
Alvinza Hayward to Senator Voorheis, re
questing him to vote for Wolfe's Senate
bill, empowering a corporation sole
right to dispose of real estate in the same
manner as private citizens are allowed to
do. The telegram was not read, but was
exhioited to the committee, who decided
that it had no bearing on tha matter of
Assembly bill 273. This is a bill in which
it was stated on the floor of the Assembly
by Judge Dibble that Archbishop Kiordan
was interested.
The witness had his clerks in Oakland,
San Francisco and Alameda searching for
other telegrams between the two parties
and he expected that the search would be
finished by next Monday.
Frank Moffitt, ex-newspaper publisher
and politician, was called 10 the stand and
said that he knew nothing about any
bribery.
Franklin Hichborn, one of the Examin
er's Kiaff of correspondents, testified that
his work was in the Assembly chamber.
"Do you kndw of any money being paid
to any member of the Assembly to in
fluence his vote on Assembly bill No.
273?"
â â¢No, sir."
He did not send to the Examiner any
information on which the article was
based and he did not write it or any part
of it. He did not know anything about
ihe matter.
Judee Frick came in at this moment
and produced the following copies of tele
prams which passed between him and G.

BRAVE LITTLE
GREECE DEFIANT
Will Battle With the Turks
if They Cross the
Frontier.
Warlike Activity at Athens
Shows Ultimatum of the
Powers Is Ignored
All the Army Reserves Are Called
Oat and the Grecians Are
Reaiy f<v he Fray.
ATHENS, Greece, March s.â Advices
received here tnis afternoon show that
the force of Christians who are investing
Heraklion number 15,000 men. The in
surgents have stopped all communication
with the town by land, and it is certain
that unless the foreign warships actively
intervene in behalf of the Moslems the
town will shortly be compelled to sur
render.
The small detachment of sailors and
marines landed from the various war
ships still occupy the town, but without
the aid of the fleets they could make but
a feeble defense against the overwhelming
numbers of insurgents.
The greatest activity is being displayed
in A.hens in making preparations to give
battle to the Turks should they cross
the Greek frontier. The Ministry of War
presents a most animated scene. Officers
in uniform throng the corridors and
orderlies are constantly being dispatched
in every direction with orders to different
commanders. The telegraph wires are
constantly busy with dispatches to officers
in distant places. The niogt energetic
measures are being taken for the mobiliza
tion of the forces.
There is a similar scene of activity in the
Ministry of Marine, where everything pos
sible is being done to placo the fleet in
readiness for any contingency.
There is no sign anywhere of the King
or Government receding from the position
they have taken, and it is ominous that in
the face of the threat of the combined
Europe, the warlike preparations are being
carried on with feverish activity. The
most intense enthusiasm is everywhere
displayed and the people evince no fear of
the result of au appeal to arms. They know
full well that the Greek army by itself is
no match for the numerically superior
Turkish forces, but they also know that in
the event of war the whole of Southern Eu
rope would be set on lire. It is this thai
the powers wish to prevent. If they at
tempt to use force to compel Greece to ac
cede to their demands, there is a very
strong probability that Greece will apply
the torch that will start a conflagration,
the result of which no one can foretell.
It is believed here that the powers, see
ing the chance of their becoming involved
in a great war, will, owing to their con
flicting interests, make haste slowly in at
tempting to force the Greeks to withdraw
their support from the Cretan Christians.
It has been decided that there shall be a
eenerai mobilization of the Greek forces,
and to this end the two clas s es of reserves
that had not been summoned previously
have now been called out. The reserve
forces alone give a totai of 104,600 men,
and behind this is what is called the terri
torial arm, which numbers upward of
Mti.OOO men, not by any means an insig
nificant force. The standing army num
bers about 20.000 men.
Ammunition and supplies for the troops
are being supplied as rapidly as possible,
and in a few days the whole available war
strength o fthe nation will have been pre
pared for any eventuality that may occur.
People who have arrived here from the
provinces have expressed no surprise at
the enthusiastic support that is beinz
given by the Athenians to the Govern
ment. They aay that there is more en
thusiasm in the places they come from
than is displayed in the capital, and there
is a grim determination to uphold the
King ami Government in any steps they
may take to maintain their present posi
tion. Dispatches from different points in
Thesaaly and Epirus report the move
ment of large quantities of munitions of
war to u.e frontier, where troops are being
amassed aÂ» speedily as the resources at
' tht: command of the military authorities
permit.
LONDON, Eng , March s.â Sir Charles
Dilke, Sir Thomas Reid, Henry Labou
chere, John Dillon, Herbert Gladstone,
the Right Hon. A. J. Mundell and nearly
100 other Liberal members of the House of
Commons have subscribed their names to
a letter to the King of Greece, paying him
a tribute for his services to Crete and ex
pressing hope for the future safety and
welfare o! Greece.
The Standard says the letter has ex
cited indignation among the supporters of
the Government. The letter, it adds, is
calculated to encourage the King to resist
the poweis and to produce a mischievous
result.
Concerning the dispatch signed by 100
I Liberals, National Irish members of Par
liament, which waa sent to the King of
Greece last night, expressing sympathy
with the efforts of Greece in behalf of
Crete, the Westminster Gazette (Liberal)
says;
"When the King receives this message
of sympathy be will do well to take notice
of the fact that the British Government
lias a majority of 150 in the House of
Common If he understands tba beiring
, of this, and. it he know* mat the Govern
-1 men t of Great Britain can only be diverted
I from its decision by an adverse vote in tne
House of Commons, which there is ap
parently no chance of obtaining, he will
better understand the value of the mes
sage."
The Constantinople correspondent of
the Standard telegraphs that the police
have reported that 10,000 Greek residents
of the city are preparing to make trouble.
Orders have been issued from the Yildiz
Kiosk tnat exceptional precautions should
[ be taken in view of the bitter feeling be
tween the Greeks and Mussulmans.
In reply to a letter from the editor of
the Chronicle, Gladstone writes from the
south of France that to expel the Greek
troops from Crete ana keep as police the
butchers of Armenia would further deepen
the disgrace of the powers.
The Times publishes a dispatch from
Constantinople stating that the Forte's
reply to the note of ' the powers was
drafted Wednesday and will probably be
delivered Thursday evening. The tenor
of the reply is acquiescent. The dispatch
adds that the powers have agreed upon
the terms of their communication respect
! ing the withdrawal of the Turkish troops
I from Crete, and that this communication
j will be handed to the Porte on Monday
I immediately after the Bairim festival,
during which the public ottices are closed.
ST. PETERSBURG. RrssiA, March 5.â
The Journal (semi-official) makes a state

that spirit took the initiative in propos

reason to hope that further difficulties
will not arise and tbat Greece will prove
her wisdom by bending to the mighty will
of united Europe. In the common in
terests of peace and legality Greece cannot
desire to endanger her future oy acts of
folly, and the Greeks may be happy in the
knowledge that their kinsmen in Crete
will in future enjoy local autonomy.
Russia, which has ever had the interests
of the Christian peoples of the East at
heart, will regard the suggested solution
with SHtisiacuon, all the greater seeing
that it is in harmony for the desire for
universal peac e and in the spirit of
equity by which the ir perial Government
is constantly inspired.
CANKA, Crete, March s.â The situa
tion at ISelino and towns in that vicinity
is uncenain, the leports from there being
va^ue. It is claimed that Cadmoa is stili
holding out despite the previous reports
that the town had surrendered to the
Christians.
.bur three days a discussion has been
going on between tne admirals of ihe
foreign warships and M. Baraklis, the
Greek Vice-Consul, who was recently di
rected by King George to go to Selino 10
intervene wiih ihe insurgents in beha.f
of the besieccd Mohammedans at Cad
mos. The Consul insisted upon going
to iSelino on the Greet warship Hydra,
but the Greek admiral, apparently
thinking that if he went in a Greek
vessel Greece would get too much credit
for the rescue of the Moslems, declined to
permit him to go on the Hydra, They
offered, however, to place a Kussian tor
peuo-boat destroyer at his .service for the
purpose, Dut Al. Boraklis very firmly re
iused the offer.
It is now variously stated that M. Ber
aklis has gone on nis mission of mercy
and that he has not gone. The impor
tance of the matter lies in the desperate
situation of the besieged Moslems ai
Cadmos. Public feeling here is strong
against the attitude of the foreign ad
mirals, which may lead to the loss of
many lives.

THE TRANSVAAL RAID.
Rhodes Says It Was Precipitated by tht
Gross Discrimination of Kruger
in Raiiway Rates.
LONDON, Exg., March 5. â The ex
amination of Cecil Rhodes, ex-Premier of
the Cape Colony, was resumed in West
minster Hall to-tluy by the Parliamentary
committee appointed to inquire into thy
Jameson raid in the Transvaal. There
was a fair attendance of spectators, but
there were not nearly so many persons
present as at the previous sittings.
Mr. Rhodes testified that the Transvaal
Government had raised the railway rates
for passengers and freight through the
special intervention of President Kruger,
Uie object Ixnu io divert {rsflio so that
the bulk of it should be secured by the
Netherlands line. Witness said that he
himse.f. had told President Kruger that
the result of such action would be that
the Cape Colonists, and even a great many
of the Boers, would resent it and try to
turn him out of office. To this Kruger
replied that he had the power and meam
to Ã¼be it.
The opposition to commercial federa
tion, Mr. Rhodes said, came chiefly from
Germany, as it tended to interfere with
the German trade. The duties aid not
oppose the wishes of the Germans. Mr.
Rhodes said that bis main object in assist
ing an insurrection in the Transvaal was
to secure free trade throughout South
Africa and a more tolerant attitude on the
part of the Transvaal republic toward the
Cape Colony.
In answer to questions relating to the
expenses of his operations against the
natives in South Africa Mr. Rhodes said
that be had sold 40,000 shares of the
British South Africa Company stock to
pay the expenses of the war against the
Matabeles and had expended Â£f)4,000 in
delraying such expenses, from which out
lay there hart been no return.
Mr. Rhodes further testified that he had
paid Â£50,000 toward the fines which had
been imposed by the Transvaal Court at
Pretoria upon the Johannesburg reform
committee prisoners.
The examination of Mr. Rhodes was
then concluded.
Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Rhodes were
mutu&ll; polite during the sitting, but
there did not seem to be any feeling of
cordiality between them. The questions
put and the answers given throughout Mr.
Rhodes' examination, however, agreed in
showinc that thn narrow and reactionary
policy of the Transvaal Government is
endangering the peace of South Africa.

The long overdue schooner Vine got in
from the Southern Seas last nixht.
Captain Luttrell reports that Spain has
.-.nother war on ncr hands, in the Caro
lines, and that Jipan will demand satis
:acuon for the murder of several of her
subjects. It api ears that latterly "the
little brown men from the land of the
chrysanthemum have had cou'rol of all
the trade on all the islands. This ansered
the natives and they toon ibeir revenge on
the Japanese when the opportunity came.
The whole colony was wiped out and now
Japanese warships have been sent to the
scene of action in order to uphold the
honor of the flag.
"It was this way that the trouble oc
curred," said Captain Luttrell yesterday.
"The natives are half Spanish and Half
Soutn Sea Islanders. At first they wel
comed the Japanese, but when the latter
| began to monopolize. all ti.e business of the
group the natives began to kick. Finally,
when the Japs began taking to wife the
handsomest gils on the group tne trouble
began. A general uprising followed and
every Japanese ou iha link .-roup was
killed. 1 call it cold-blooded murder, and
the Japanese Government seems to hold
the same opinion. When the Vine left
the Carolines warships were expected
there every day, and the chances are that
that the islands of Ruk are in ruins and
that several thousand natives have paid
the death penalty for tho murder of the
Japanese.
"Of all the natives in the Caroline
group those on the Ruk Islands are the
most savage. They demand an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth, and nothing
save death can prevent them .rum having
their pound -of flesh. Nothing shore of
extermination will quiet them and no
power on earth can accomplish that.
Spain cannot control them and Japan
wiil not be able to do anything with the
warships except to have them back up her
demand for an indemnity. In the mean
time ihe Japanese are being murdered and
the whole group is in a ferment."
While the Vine was at Kusaie the hull
of a copper-riveted vessel drifted on the
reef. At first it was thought to be the
Centaur, which was burned in April last
in 150 west, but now Captain Luttrell is of
the opinion that it was some American
ship that was reported missing years ago
and has finally reached land. There was
nothing but the hull left and not a thing
by which the vessel could be identified.
No matter what vessel it is, the hull shows
I that it must have drifted at least 3000
! miles durinpr the past six months.
James McMiilen, an old-time trader and
one of the beat known men in ibe South
ern Seas, died at Butaritari last January.
It was tirst intended to send his remain?

vailed and he will rest in peace in his
island home.
The Rev. J. W. Kanoa also passed away
while the Vine was among the Gilbert
group. He was the first and only Ha
waiian missionary that left his native
country to publish the gospel of peace.
He was an earnest worker and ono of the
best known men in the Southern Seas.
Some years ago he married a young native
woman and soon thereafter scandal waÂ«
busy with her name. The aged minister
stood by through ill report and good re
port and when an order came from the
synod of the church commandine him to
sever his connections with her, he simply
wrote back, "Whom God hath joined let
no man put asunaer."
"They gave him a big funeral," Â»aid
Captain Luttrell yesterday, "and his widow
was the chief mourner. He left the
church because it would not receive his
wite, and I think that the Kanoa church
in the Gilbert group is now one of the
most successful in the Southern Seas.
"British Consul Campbell at Taputeo

most autocratic men I ever came across.
He simply will not alow an American
to do business in the group. He pre
vented me from landing any goods, and
when it came to trading I wasn't in it. I
did fairly well, however, and had it not
been for my long trip the vessel would
have paid expenses.
"Chief Engineer Douse of the steam
missionary barkentine Morning Star
nearly died at Ponai>e of hemorrhage of
the stomach. Dr. Rife managed to pull
him throueb, however, and be was aent to
Honolulu to recuDerate the day before we
sailed.
"The missionary schooner' Hiram Bing
ham was in Kusaie when we left, and
Captain Walkup reported all well. The
whaler Gayhead was also in Kusaie and
Captain Foley reported that he was on his
way from the Carolines to the Gilbert
group and thence to Alaska. He expects
to reach Unalaska early in July and hopes
to do better in. the Arctic than he did in
the Southern Pacific. His wife was taken
sick during the cruise and is now on her
way to San Francisco via Honolulu. Two
tailors deserted and, if all reports are
true, tbey are married to native prin
cesses.
"However, no one paid any attention to
such little things as desertions and mar
riages, the one absorbing question being
the war against the Japanese. The lat
ter's warships, will insist on reparation
and just where Spain is eoing to get off in
the matter 1 don't know and the Spanish
officials aro in the same box. One thing
is certain. Japan holds the best hand
and she wiil punish the natives for the
murder of her subjects no matter what
Spain says. If it comes to a war, and I
wouldn't be a bit surprised to hear war
was declared, then Japan will win. The
Japs are aching for a fight and since their
countrymen were murdered they are
losing no opportunity to exasoerats the
Spaniards. The killing was done by the
natives, but as they are subjects of Spain
the Japa hold that country responsible."

LAUNCHING THE
NEW CABINET
Senate Confirms the Selec
tions of President
McKinley.
Teller Critic Z2s the Nomination
of Bliss lor the Interior
Pcrtfo io.
Thinks Ha Is Hardly the Man to
Handle the Interests of the
Great West.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March s.â The
proceedings of the first session of the
Fifty-fifth Congress were witnessed to-day
by a very large assemblage of spectators
in the galleries of the Senate chamber, the
Senate being to-day without the executive
partisanship of the House of Representa
tives, which body will remain in a state of
suspended animation until called into re
newed existence on the first day of the
extraordinary >eÂ»von soon to bs convened
by President McKinley.
As soon ns tite journal of yesterday's
formal meeting was read the Senator from
Ohio (Foraker) rose and presented the
credentials of Mr. Hanna as successor to
Sherman, resigned. The credentials hav
ing been read Vice-President riobart in
vited Mr. Hanna to step forward and take
the oath of* office.
Together the two Republican Senators
from Ohio who takd the places of Senators
Brice and Sherman walked to the Vice-
President's desk, where the oath was duly
administered to Mr. Hanna after a round
of handclapping in the galleries, and then
Senators Foraker and Hanna took their
seats tegether.
The next step was Ihe adoption of a
resolution offered by Frye (R.) of Maine
directing that until otherwise ordered
Davis (R.) of Minnesota be acting chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tionsâthe chairmanship having been
vacated througn the retirement of Sher
man.
At 12:45 President McKinley sent to the
Senate the following nominations: John
Sherman of Ohio to be Secretary of the
State, Lyman J. Gage of Illinois to be Sec
retary of the Treasury, Russell A. Alger of
Michigan to be Secretary of War, Jo.-eph
McKenna of California to be Attorney-
General, James A. Gary of Maryland to be
Postmaster-General, John D. Long of
Massachusetts to be Secretary of the Navy,
Corne.ius N. Bliss of New Yort to be Sec
retary of the Interior, James VViison of
lowa to be Secretary of Agriculture.
Immediately upon the receipt of the
Cabinet nominations, the Senate went into
executive session.
The length of the executive session this
afternoon led to the circulation of several
unfounded rnniors that a contest was
being made against the confirmation of at
least two of the members of the Cabinet
selected by President McKinley. Rumor
ha 1 it that the opposition was aimed at
Mr. McKenna, selected for the Attorney-
Generalship, and Mr. Alger for Secretary
of War. The delay was not unusual. The
nomination of Mr. Sherman was confirmed
immediately without the formality of a
reference to the committee. It was sug
gested privately on the floor that the
whole Cabinet be at once confirmed, but
i his was not done, for had snob action
b?en taken, the compliment intended for
Mr. Sherman would have been no com
pliment at all.
All the other nominations were referred
to the various committees, which, after
informal discussions, made favorable re
ports in each case.
Teller addressed the Senate briefly. He
said he tt id not propose to oppose any se
lection Mr. McKinley had made. He'rec
ognized the fact that the Caoinet was the
official family of the President and the
President ought not to be hampered by
the Senate in the cnoice of men whom he
desired for his advisers. He wished, how
ever, to say that he beiieved that in some
cases Mr. McKinley had made mistakes in
the men he had chosen. Whoever else
Teller bad in mind is unknown, for he
mentioned only Mr. B!iÂ«s, nominated to
be Secretary of the Interior.
Tel er emphasized the fact that he did
not criticize this nomination on personal
grounds. He knew Mr. Bliss to be a man
of affairs, who bad oeen successful and
was held high in the esteem of bis fellow
men. He did not doubt but that Mr.
Bliss -would bring to the office all his busi
ness and executive ability.
But there was more required, Mr. Teller
said, than mere business ability. The In
terior Department was one of the most
important in the Government, affecting
interests in many States and particularly
those in the great West. The Secretary
annually made more important decisions
Involving property than did the Supreme
Court of the United States. The head of
â¢ his great department ought to be equipped
with legal ability and a familiarity with
land matters to meet the intricate ques
tions that would come before it, and for
this reason, and for this reason only, Mr.
Teller said the nomination was open to
criticism.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada spoke briefly
in the same v*in, corroborating what Mr.
Teller had said about the importance of a
head to this department who would be
able to deal justly and jadiciouÃly in
the matters of dispute constantly coming
before the court of which the Secretary
was the reviewing judge.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts replied to
Teller's criticisms by praising the ability
and qualifications of Mr. Blis* and ad
dressing himself \o the one point made
by Teller, asserting that this could be
easily overcome by the selection of as
sistant secretaries, who would have those
qualifications that would gaide the Secre
tary in his ruhn s.
Chandl r called attention to the fact
bai Zachariah Chandler had no legal
raining and that he was an Eastern man.
Still it was ail initted that his conduct of
the administration of the Interior Depart
ment was one of the best in the history of
the Government.
Teller emphasized the fact that he had
not criticizeu Bias becauie he was an
Eastern man, but because, being an East
ern man, ho knew nothing of the great
Western matters constantly arising in the
Department of ihe Interior. There was
no clash between th- Ea-t and We>t, and
bearing in mind the recent elnborate re
ports of executive sessions in the arbitra
tion treaty Teller jocularly remarked that
he hoped the "reporter" of an executive
session debate would exonerate him from
the charge of criticizing Mr. Bliss' selec
tion on the ground that i>e was an Eastern
man.
Without taking a formal vote all the
nominations were then confirmed.
TO CONFER ON ADJOURNMENT.

The title of Sanford's bill compelling all
corporations to pay their employes at
least once a month was approved.
The Senate could not ?et a quorum to
nigbt owing to most of the Senators being
in attendance on the Examiner investiga
tion. An adjournment was taken shortly
after 8 o'clock.
In the Assembly this morning a resolu
tion for the appointment of a commi'tee
of three, one of which is to be the Speaker,
to confer with a like committee from the
Senate, for the purpose cf abrogating cer
tain of the joint rules of both houses and
to fix upon a definite time ior adjourn

The county eovernment bill was up for
a second reading, for amendments.
Tbe Assembly this afternoon refused to
pass the Senate bill requiring pawn
brokers to file bonds and make daily re
ports of business transactions to tbe Chief

A considerable part of the afternoon
was consumed in the second reading of
Senate bills.
When the House went into committee
of the whole to consider the general ap
propriation bill Caminetti moved to
amend the item appropriating $75,000 in
a lump sum for State Printing Office by
d vidinji the amount, and providing
$45,000 thereof for Legislature printing.
The amendment was lost.
Caminetii then suDmitted an amend

employed by the Beard of Examiners.
Cutler, who was in the chair, ruled the
amendment out ol order as unconstitu

Carainetti withdrew the amendment.
The committee then rose and reported the

Boone and Hudson again tried to raise
their district agricultural appropriations,
but failed.
An amendment by Kenyon iaisine the
National Guard allowance from $30,466 66
to $40,000 was adopted.
Caminetti then put in his printing ex
pert amendment.
L avitt raised the point of order that it
was in violation of me constitution us an
amendment to the appropriation bill.
Caminetti replied that the office was
already provided and that the amendment
regulated the expenditure of the expert's
salary. Pries and Leavitt spoke to the
Question and the chair ruled that ie was
unconstitutional.
The Assembly to-nieht passed t'ne fol
lowing Assembly bills: Appropriating
$350 to pay a deficiency in the appropria

FOUNDER OF CIRCLE CITY.
His Story of the Gold Product
and the Opportunities lor
Mining.
Strange Places Where Ivory Ij toÃs.
Picked Up and Where Whole
Skeletons Are. ,
A. Harrington, one of the founders of
Circle City, and one of the owners of im
portant placer mines on Mastodon and
Eagle gulches, is at the Russ. Ha has
been on a visit to his old home at Gallopo
lis, Ohio.
It is the first time he has been out of the
Yukon for eight years. He is now going
back, laden with supplies, and expects to
get out a big amount of gold from his
claims before he again confronts civiliza
tion in this part ot the world.
He is one of the owners of claims 1 and
2, below the original discovery claim in
Mastodon uulch, and of one or two claims
in the Eagle Gulch. He says the former
property pays from $15 and $20 up to $50
and $75 a man each day, according to
whether it happens to be rich or poor.
However, it costs from $10 to $12 a day for
labor.
"Last year we employed fifty men,' 1
saia Mr. Harrington; "the season lasts
about 100 or 110 days, and we are as busy
as we can be during all that time in order
to get out as much gold as possible. We
worked the two claims on Mastodon
Gulch. The gulch takes its name from
the fossils of the mastodon mat are found
thÂ»re. I have seen many of them at dif
ferent times.
"Further down, on Crooked Creek, lots
of rtttCS in the shape of tusks, teeth, jaws
and different kinds of bones are to be seen.
I have seen tv ks three or four feet long
and three or four inches through, some of
which were as clear, bright ivory as exists
anywhere. Others were somewhat de
cayed and blacfcened.
"Sometimes ihe remains of the masto
dons are found right on top of the ground,
but usually where the creek has cut
away the bank and exposed them. There
are places down on the main Yukon
where whole skeletons can be dug out.
I saw a man there who had broueht out a
huge jawbone witb four teeth in it, and
he told me he believed he could have got
out a perfect skeleton."
Mr. Harrington was fairly well im
pressed with that part of the Yukon. He
formerly mined in Colorado for five years.
As one of the s<x founders of Circle City,
lie believes that place is to be the enter
of a large mining country. But the
country is remote and not so good as Colo
rado was when be was there, which was
during the rapid development of silver
properties.

Judge Frick said that he had given per
mission to Mr. Jaynea to produce the
originals when found.
Senator Voorheis was .called to the
stand, and, in reply to questions, said : "I
never had any telegraphic correspondence
with any one concerning that bill. I
never saw the bill or knew that it was
introduced until it had passed the As
sembly, and I never knew that such a bill
existed until it came before the Senate.
"I am charged with having introduced
a bill in the Senate. That i 3 absolutely
false," added the Senator.
"Do you know, directly or indirectly,
that any Assemblyman was offered or
paid any money?" asked Valentine.
"No, sir; nor any Senator," replied
Voorheis.
Alvinza Hayward was called next, and
said tbat he had no recollection of having
received any telegrams from Senater Voor
heis in relation to bill 273. He would con
sent that any such telegrams might be
prodnc j d. He had not been in Sacra
mento for over a year and knew of no
bribery.
Al Murphy, better known as "Blinker,"
testified that he was "a newspaper man,
connected with the Examiner."
"Do you know of any bribery in the
Legislature?" was asked.
"No, sir," replied Murphy.
"Did you furnish any information to
the Examiner on which this item was
based? Do you know of any Assembly
man receiving money to influence his
vote on Assembly bill 273?'
"No, sir," was the rep!y. Murphy
added that he did not write any portion
of the article and did not know that any
money had been paid to any member of
the Legislature.
"Have you any knowledge whatever 01
any bribery in connection with any mat
ters of legislation here?"
"I have not," replied Murphy.
"Do you know who wrote the article?"
"I could almost say so, but I don't
know positively."
"Do you know who wrote part of it?'*
"Yes."
"Who?"
"L. L. Levings. He spoke to me about
bribery in the Senate, witn reference to a
Senator in connection with this bill."
"Do you know that any money was of
fered or paid to any member of the As
sembly as a bribe?"
"I have no such Knowledge."
L. L. Levings, one of tne Examiner
staff, was the next witness, and when he
was asked whether he wrote the article
Ciunie vehemently objected. In fact, he
objected to every au-stion that would
throw any light oif yjive any information
as to whether there had tfcen any bribery. '
Levings explained that he was in a very
embarrassing position. The information
which he had given the Examiner was
the property of that paper, he oeir.g only
an employe. He could not give any of
his information without the consent of
the Examiner, and he could not betray
any confidence that had b<Â»en reposed in
him. When he was asked whether he
knew that even a single Assemblyman
had been bribed Ciunie objeted. Lev
ings said that he thought he could direct
the committee to a place where they could
get information as to tbe truth or falsity
of the charge or bribery, and when asked
where, he replied by referring the com
mittee to the Western Union Telegraph
Company.
When asked whether that was where he
got his information Knight objected.
When asked whether Lcvings could fur
nish the name of any individual who
could give the committee even the least
information Knight objected again.
"Suppose that an operator in the West
ern Union Telegraph office in Sacramento
told this reporterâ suppose he gave him a
hint," said Knight, "about bribery and
said that things were getting very crooked
and there was a suspicion of bribery
going on, do you think this witness would
have a risiht to expose and disgrace that
young man?"
Knight in thÂ» same breath remarked
that he did not wish to be understood as
casting any reflections upon the operator.
Valentine, wearied of the attempt of the
Examiner to hide behind the slandered
telegraph operator, made a little speech
in which he said: "We come right now
to the plain bold statement of asking this
witness, as a representative of the Ex
aminer, for the facts, if any, on which he
has written this article and scattered it
broadcast over the whole State besmirch
ing every member of the Legislature. We
ask him the plain question, what was it?
We ask him if the Examiner will refuse
to permit him to answer that question."
Knight objected again, and Chairman
Belshaw remarked that he admired
Knight's gall, whereupon Knight said that
it was the first time in his experience that
he knew a legislative committee to accuse
a lawyer of having gall.
T c committee vainly tried for a half
hour or more to get livings to tell the
facts on which he based the article,
but as L >vin,T3 had no facts his attorneys
vehemently objected time and time again,
until the committee (Mead and Ryan,
Democrats, voting no) adjudged nim
guilty of contempt, but deferred action
on sending him to jail until the Senate
committee could take a whack at him in
the evening.
G. H. Jessen, another Examiner corre
spondent, testified that he knew nothing
about any bribery in tue Legislature or
about the article.
The committee then adjourned until 9
o'clock on Monday morning.
DARE NOT ANSWER.
Being Afraid to Confess the Fake
Examiner Fakers May Be
S nt to Jail.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. March s.â As the
result of the hearing before the Senate
Bribery Investigating Committee to-night
the wain of a jail stare Andrew M. Law
rence, managing editor of the Examiner,
and L. L. Levings, a member of the Ex
aminer staff, in the face. Both preserved
the attitude of defiance toward the com
mi'tee which makes them liable to pun
ishment for contempt, and under the cir-
cnmstances the Senate will bare no other
coarse open, in justice to the members of
that body, than to order them imprisoned
until they consent to answer ttie questions
which they baked at to-night.
Not one scintilla of evidence of any
kind, o-al or documentary, was obtained
to show that there was any foundation for
the Examiner's fake of last Saturday.
Tnere were the same attempts at bully
ragging witnesses and bulldozing the com
mittee and its attorney that were made
before the Assembly committee, but the
firmness and dignity of Chairman Dickin
son of the committee and of Senator
Morehouse, who acted as attorney for the
Senate in the matter, soon made irre^
pressibie Andy Clunie realize that nis
capers would neither be effective nor tol
erated.
There were also the name transparent
attempts to cloud the issuo by the legal
representatives of the Examiner, who
were re-enforced in the peison of Garret
M< Enerney, that had been made on other
occasions. Ttey continued to try to make
it appear that the fuct that the Examiner
had published its story on rumor and
hearsay only cut no figure in the case,
and that the Examiner bad now the right
to go on a fishing excursion into the rec
ords of the Western Union Telegraph
Office, the Postal Telegraph Office, on the
waters of the seas, on shore and even into
the clouds above to secure testimony, if
any there was. to prove that bribery had
been commitiei in connection with As
sembly bill 273.
But the committee and his attorneys
knew tbeir duties, their rights and the
law too well to be coaxed, beguiled or
driven from the real object of the investi
gation. This was clearly enunciated by
Chairman Dickinson, who said that the
Examiner had made the charges of
bribery, and if those charges were true the
Examiner should have the information
necessary to prove them, and should be
only too glad to furnish that information
to the committee. By doing so, he inti
mated, it would be doing the State a
great public service and would at the same
time lift from itself the cloud of suspicion
that now rested upon it and made it ap
pear that its bribery charges were abso
lutely without foundation, and that its
story relative to the matter was a pure
fake.
Daring the arguments that interspersed
the taking of testimony, Attorney Knight
virtually admitted that the article had
heen published simply on idle rumors and
unreliable hearsay.
The Supreme Court room, where the
inquiry was held, was crowded to suffoca
tion, all the Senators being in attendance,
the Senate having adjourned to be present.
Andrew .M. Lawrence, managing editor
of the Examiner, was the first witness
called. With little preliminary interroga
tion. Senator Morehouse got right into the
heart of the matter.
"Do you know who wrote the article?"
he asked.
"I would like to consult my attorney,"
answered thj witness.
After consultation with both Knight
and Glunie the latter objected to the ques
tions on the statutory ground that they
were incompetent, irrelevant and imma
terial.
No attention was paid to the objection,
and the witness replied, "I know by hear
say."
"Do you know of your own knowledge
who wrote the article?"
The same objection was made but again
ignored, and the same reply was given.
"Do you know of any fact or circum
stance set forth in the article last Satur
day of your own knowledge?"
"I had been informed by a member of
the staff that there were telegrams in the
Western Union office that would show
there waÃ bribery," Jnswered the witness,
according to the preconcerted plan to at
tempt to make the Western Union a
stumbling block in the investigation, and
possibly a shield for the lakers.
"Do you know this of your own knowl
edge?"
"I do not."
"Do you know any Senator or Assem
blyman who received money to vote for
this bill?"
"I do not."
To all further questioning Lawrence
gave replies intending to convey the idea
that he bad no knowledge of the article
until after its publication, notwithstand
ing that he was at the time in charge of
the Examiner as managing and news ed
itor and had full control of its columns.
He was excused and L. L. Levingc, one
of the Sacramento legislative correspond
ents of the Examiner, was put on the
stand. Levin>;s went through the same
programme he had carried out before the
Assembly committee. He claimed to have
knowledge of the facts upon which the
Examiner article was based, but evaded
answering the question if he had fur
nished the data upon which the article
was written.
Clunie claimed that the writing con
taining such data was the best evidence,
and that Morehouse had no legal right to
make the witness testify orally on the
matter.
Then Morenouse put the Examiner on
record in its attitude tending to block, the
investigation. He said:
"This investigation is an investigation
of the Legislature of California. The Sen
ate is under a charge of bribery published
in the Examiner. It either had or had
not these facts in its possession at the
time that article was published. It can
take the stand and tell us all the facts,
and that is all we want, and when we have
the facts we will bring the parties here
who can prove bribery or did the bribing.
The man who wrote the article is the best
witness."
Clunie tried his sidetracking bluster by
suggesting that Bagget, Jaynes or Hay
ward be put on the stand, but Dickinson
quietly but effectively t6ok all the steam
out of him by remarking: ''We propose
to start at the fountain head of the source
whence these charges flowed. We ask
these gentlemen of the Examiner to state
who were bribed and how it was done.
The Examiner is here as a witness and
not as a prosecutor. We refuse absolutely
the proposition that this is a prosecution.
of the Examiner, and decline to allow the
Examiner to take charg> of the prosecu
tion. We want nothing subsequent to the
time the article was published. We will
come to that later."
Then Knight gave the fake of the Ex
aminer en areiyaway, to use the expres
sive slang of the day. He said :
"It makes no difference whether the
editor oi that journal knew the facts at
the time that article appeared or not. The
question is whether tne Legislature is
corrupt or pure. If the man who wrote the
article wrote it only on idle rumor and on
street talk at the time of writing, and can
now prove by outsMe means these charges,
this committee will not hide itself behind
the fact that this man did not know the
truth at the time he wrote the article.
Let us submit for the sake of argument
that he wrote it on idle rumor and that
since be and bis friends have made an ex
amination of the matter and have learned
it was true, and is prepared to prove to
night the fact, would not the committee
accept it f"
In this virtual admission of faicine on
the part of the Examiner, and this cunning
plea to be allowed to go on a fishing ezcur
sion for evidence, Knight showed the true
status of the journal be represented.
To this Morehotise replied that ail the
committee wanted was that if the Exam
iner had no fact* in its possession at tue
time it should say so right out and the ex
amination would be stopped.
Knight, however, refused to make the
flat admission.
Morehouse then declared until the com
mittee had thoroughly examined the peo
ple who made the rssault on the Legisla
ture, there could be no fair investigation.
Lawrenoe was recalled, and while he
denied he had seen the dispatches which
went to the Examiner from Sacramento
on Friday las , he admitted having infor
mation bearing on the article. He was
asked if the iniormation was in writing,
and declined to answer at first, but subse
quently replied in the affirmative.
"From whom?" continued Mo r ehouse.
"I decline to answer," replied the wit
npss.
â¢'Where is that writing now?"
"I dec.me to answer."
"What did you do with it?"
"Destroyed it Threw it away."
"How did you destroy it?"
"I decline to answer."
"What was the contents of the docu
ment?"
"I decline to answer."
"Dd or did not the contents have rela
tion to the subject-matter of the article in
the Examiner last Saturday?"
"I decline to answer."
At this point Morehouse turned to the
chairman and said: "If I can't get an
answer then I ask that the proper resolu
tion be adopted by the Senate and that
the witness be committed to prison until
he answers."
The chairman said the matter would be
duly considered, and the witness was ex
cused for the time being.
Several others of the Examiner staff
were put on the stand, but stated they
had no knowledge whatever of the matter,
and were excused for good.
Levings was recalled, and he was not
long in getting into the same boat with
his superior. H ! testified that of his own
knowledge he did not know of any one
paying or receiving a bribe in connection
with Assembly bill 273. His troubles be
gan when he was asked by Moorehouse:
"Do you know of your own knowledge
of any telegrams sent by any member of
the Snate or nceived by any member of
the Senate to influence his vote for this
bill?'
"I shall decline to answer," said the
witness, and then pleaded not to be asked
to violate the confidence that he intimated
had been placed in him, whicn. he said he
would have to do if he replied.
Dickinson ruled the reason was neither
good nor valid, and the witness again de
clined to answer.
"The committee will take the matter
under advisement," sententiously and
significantly remarked the chairman, and
then excused the wi ness for the present.
Superintendent Jaynes was put on the
stand and said that if any telegrams that
the committee desired were sufficiently
identified to come within the decision of
the Supreme Court on the matter he
would on Monday produce them, and
Clunie was given the privilege of drafting
the subpenas duces tecum for such tele
grams, so that the Examiner could have
no cause for complaint.
In connection with the present investi
gation it is pertinent to recall the course
of the Examiner in Ihe notorious Brnner
case. It then had facts and allowed its
reporters to go on the stand and testify
freely and fully as to all they knew. If it
has facts now, is the question asked by
legislators, why don't it produce them
ana aid the investigating committee, in
stead of arraying itself in a defiant atti
tude against the committee?
It is understood thai on Monday the
necessary resolutions citing the two re
calcitrant witnesses to appear before the
bar of the Senate, and asking that they be
imprisoned for contempt, will be intro
duced in the Senate.
MOFFITT'S EXPLANATION.
Tolls Why He Called Lawrence a
"Liar, Crook and Boodllngr
Blackguard."
OAKLAND, Cal., March s.â Mr. Mof
fitt said to-nisrht: "At the instance of this
fellow Lawrence I was subpenaed to Sac
ramento to testify before the investigation
committee. There was no reason fcr
sending for me except that I am a friend
of Colonel Hay ward, against whom there
is a big tight. I never knew of tbe Hale &
Norcross bill and have not asked a mem
ber of the Legislature to vote for or ayair.st
any measure of any kind this session. In
obedenca to the subpena I went to
Sacramento.
"Mr. Hay ward was also sent for. When
Lawrence saw me there with Mr. Hay
ward he concluded that lie would roast all
of Mr. Hayward's friends, knowing that I
never would have been there if he (Law
rence) had not sent for me. Accordingly,
this morning he printed a lot of personal
references to myself, concerning wtiich
there is not a word of truth, and when he
passed me in front of the Golden Eagle
Hotel I concluded I would denounce him.
It is true that I did use some language
that no newspaper could piint. I also
used some that stung him, I guess, pretty
deep. He acted like a cur in not resent
ing what I called him, and sixty seconds
would cover the whole episode. Yes, I
sa id Lawrence was interested in the Hale
& Norcross judgment.
"I do not know this, bat I have betn
told it. I called him a liar, a crook and a
boodhng blackguard and many other
things. I was not dot, but I thought that
the scrub should ba called down. There
were many present and they all seemed
triad. While I consider myself even witn
Lawrence, I did not by any means fire off
all my ammunition and I cannot now tell
how far I may be forced to fo in dealing
with Lawrence. There was no reason for
Lawrence jnmi in? me in the first place,
and it is only human nature for one to re
taliate when he has the whip hand."

Rivers Flee for Their
Lives.
Much Prooerly Destroyed and Rail

Several Lines
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March s.â At mid
night last night the rain which has fallen
steadily for thirty-six hours suddenly be
came of cloud-burst proportions, and all
the low-lying parts of the city were soon
under water. The River Doc Peres, which
drains the city's western suburbs, over
flowed its bank-, and the villages of Chel
tenham, Clifton, Howard. Benton, Ellen
dale and Edgewood were water-bound.
The track of the St. Louis and San
Francisco Railroad was covered. The
River Dec Peres, ordinarily eighteen
inches deep, was twelve feet deep and a
mile wide. But one railroad track, the
Missouri Pacific, was above water. A
footbridge at the Subletto avenue cross
ing was carried away and two men were
drowned. People living in the flooded
.district took refuge in the tops of their
houses. The police and volunteers broucht
boats and took them to high ground. This
work went on until -day light, when the
water receded rapidly. The losa will be
enormous.
The Iron Mountain tracks along the
river were washed out at three points,
though traffic is continued over the Illi
nois Central to Cairo. Every incoming
train was late from two to four hours.
On the other side of the Mississippi
River the flood did some damage, princi
pally to railroads. The Vandalia and
Baltimore and Ohio are the most serious
sufferers. Canteen Creek, near the bluffs,
grew to the proportions of a lake near
Collinsville and Casey ville. Serious wash
outs at these points caused the abandon
ment of all trains on the Vandalia and
Baltimore and Ohio. There are two breaks
on the Vandalia road near Collinsville
two hundred yards wide, and the water is
running under the track in torrents. Tne
loss to farmers in the American Bottoms
and south to the Chester Bluffs will be
very heavy.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, March s.â The
Ohio River is rising rapiily. There has
been a steady downpour of rain for fifteen
hours. Great damage is reported. Many
persons were compelled to flee for their
lives.
The steam railroads and the electric
line to College Hill were closed on account
of the submerged tracks. The town of
Lockland, Ohio, is inundated, and at
Cummingsvilie, in the northern part of
this citr, the raging torrent is doing more
damage than the recent high, water.
Houses ta.e baan moved from their
foundations. All small streams are
swollen. The Miami and Licking rivers
will certainly tise to swell the Ohio
Kiver, which is now rising at the rate of
seven inches an hour.
The Weather Bureau states that the
rain is general from the Missouri Valley
to the Alleghany Range, being heaviest in
Illinois, Indiana and Western Ohio. The
river at this point is expected to reach the
danger lineâ forty-live feet â by the rising
ot its northern tributaries. The rain is
likely to continue all night. The sur
rounding country has been greatly dam
aged by the overflow of small streams.
A landslide at Trautmans station car
ried away part of *he Big Four Railroad
track and covered other parts, preventing
any trains on that road reaching this
city. Andersons Ferry is submerged from
surface floods, all the river-front houses
are in danger, and north of the city the
flood is the worst ever experienced there.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, March s.â Rain has
been falling steadily and heavily since
last night. The water is threatening the
street railways. Reports from the country
say that great damage has been done by
the floods. All railroad trains were de
layed Dy washouts. The Ohio River is
rising and another flood is expected.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., March s.â Five
railroads were cut off from Louisville to
day by the heavy rains in Indiana. Every
line north ol the Ohio River has trainÃ
scattered all over Indiana between Louis
ville, Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati.
The Louisville, New Albany and Chicago
and the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern
had no trains in or out. The Big Pour
train from Chicago, due at 7:39 a. m., ar
rived at 1 p. M. The Pennsylvania only
succeeded in getting in one train, and the
ht. Louis Air Line's service was badJy de
moralized.
A tornado did considerable damage in
Central Kentucky tnis morning. Western
Kentucky was also in the storm's path.
In Christian County a negro was tilled by
the blowing down of a barn and two others
probably faially injured. Near East
Christian Robert Hail, a farmer, was
fatally injured by a piece of flying timber.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March s.â Not
since 1875 have the railroads experienced
so much trouble from high waters as to
day. There was not a train in from Cin
cinnati to-day. The Indianapolis and Vin
cennes had rive washouts and all through
trains were annulled for thÂ« day. The
Vandalia had trouble on the westend and
no trains anived Jrom St. Louis until late
this evening. The Peoria and Eastern was
delayed two hours by a washout at Oler
mont. Ihe Monon has a washout south
of Crawford-vilJe, and ran its night ex
press for Louisville via Nashville intend
ing to go over the Louisville division of
the Pennsylvania line, but between Co
lumbus got tied up by a washout.
The Big Four's hret trouble was at Val
ley Junction where the dirt from a bank
had rolled down on the track for a consid
erable distanc covering the track several
feet deep. To get around this tie Big
Four sent its trains west over the Cincin
nati, Hamilton and Dayton, but between
Rushville and Morristown washouts
stopped the Monon trains, and all day
trains of both roads were tied up and not
until evening was there any train from
Cincinnati. The Big Four also had diffi
culty on its Cincinnati and Columbus di
vision. On the Cairo division several
washouts were reported.
NAfcHVILLE. Tekn., March s. âA small
cyclone struck Nashville this afternnoon,
doing considerable damage. The centen
nial buildings came through unscathed.
Scores of big downtown business uousei
were unroofed and the Masonic Temple
was slightly damaged. No fatalities have
been reported as yet.
WEYLER'S FIERCE DEFIANCE.
Sccffs at Newspaper Criticisms and Says
He Will Continue o Wade in
Cuban Blood.
HAVANA, Cuba, March s.â While at
Remedies Captain-General Weyler was
interviewed by a correspondent of La
Luchaof this city. General Weyler said
amons other things:
'â¢Believe me, 1 pay no attention what
ever to what is said or murmured about
me by the newspapers here or outside of
Cuba. 1 have fixed invariable plans,
which I intend to follow with all the
tenacity of which I am capable, and noth
ing will makf me deviate from that line
of conduct. My columns are now impos
ing peace with the muzzles ol their guns.
Nothing wi 1 be heard of peace in the
provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana or
Matanzas until I begin operations on a
great scale, pressing, pursuing and cor
raling the rebels on all sides. The same
thing will happen in the eastern provinces
as soon as I begin operations in that part
of the island."
All the local daily papers, in their com
ments upon President McKinley's inaug
ural address, express satisfaction that he
did not allude to the Cuban question.
This is taken to indicate that he will
adopt a policy of abstention, leavins Spain
to settle her affairs alone.
THE 3IVRJ>t,R OF RUIZ.
Contul Lee Complain* of Olney's Unjuit
Conduct.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 6 âA dis
patch to the Herald from Havana says:
Consul-General Lee has received the cor
respondence in relation to the Ruiz case,
as given to the Senate by the Secretary of
State, Mr. Olney. The Consul-General
will not make an official reply until the
official record is forwarded to iim.
He will then in the most public manner
reply to the correspondence, which does
him grave injustice. At the proper mo
ment he will have no difficulty in proving
how without foundation are Mr. Olney's
insinuations. It can hardly be imagined
how the department could have supposed
that General Lee would demand Ruiz's
release from incommunicado when sev
enty-two hours had elapsed.
The department never authorized Con
sul Lee to do so, though instructions in
this sense have been repeatedly requested
by him in similar cases and were never
forthcoming.
In the Scott case General Lee demanded
his release from incommunicado upon his
own authority, and the department, see
ing that the steps were approved by the
people, did not disavow it. But until
after the murder of Ruiz the department
had never insisted upon the recognition
by the Spanish authorities of this un
doubted treaty richt.
HILI* COMPETITOR RUMOR.
Groundless Story of Her Having Been
Heleasrti and Sunk.
HAVANA, Cuba, March 5.â A number
of inquiries were received here to-day re
garding a report that the Spanish au
thorities had released the captured filibus
tering schooner Competitor and her crew
and that the vessel had been sunk by a
Spanish warship after leaving the harbor.
The report is totally unfounded. Tne
Competitor is lying at the anchorage here,
in which she was placed after being
brought here. The men who were cap
tured on her are still in the Cabanas
fortress, and as far as can be learned from
officials there has been
no change in their condition since they
were tried and sentenced to death.
HEW ORDERS FROM MADRID.
Convicted Americans to Be Expelled
Fran* the Island.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.âSecre
tary Oiuey has received the following ca
blegram from Consul-General Lee at Ha
vana:
All quiet; no excitement here now. I hope
to see prompt trial of all Americans impris
oned, those found innocent to be released and
those guilty sent out of the island.
This dispatch, which came this after
noon in cipher, indicates a most impor
tant change of attitude on the part of the
military authorities in Cuba under orders
from Madrid, as guilty Americans, on
conviction, are to be expelled from the
island instead of being otherwise pun
ished.
FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
D mond Secures a D vorce and Custody
of His Child â The Ex-Queen's Move
ments Cause Uneasiness.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Feb. 25, via Vic
toria, B. C, March 5.â T. E. French oi
San Francisco and Valley Springs was
drowned on the 19th, while bathing at
Waikikl Beach.
Warren Goodall fell dead in the street
of heart disease on the night of February
22. He was an aged man of high stand
ing here for fifty years.
The Dimond divorce case closed yester
day after ten days' trial. Judgment was
promptly given for the hnsband and the
custody of the child and no alimony to
the wife. Spectators and the press were
excluded. It is learned that four degraded
women testified to participation in vile
orgies at the husband's house in his wife's
absence, where the captain of a steamer
was present and three white women from
the ship took a very active part. The hus
band was able to refute that by the testi
mony of reliable men living with him at
the time alleged.
No violence on the husband's part was
proved except that in a violent quarrel
about her conduct witli a naval omcer he
shot at her and plunged her into a chair.
Her theatrical engagement is understood
to have contributed to defeat her claims
to the custody of tne child.
Neither of the parties receives any sym
pathy. The wife was married at 18 to a
young and indiscreet husband, who was
apt to fill his house with naval officers
and other gay companions.
The royalist paper, the Independent,
discredits the Washington report that
Liliuokalani has repudiated the validity
of her act of abdication. All the papers
have entirely abstained from comment
while awaiting lurther news. The general
belief here is that she has done this in or
der to be in a belter position "as Queen to
ask for a money indemnity for her de
thronement and loss of income of crown
lauds on the ground that she was de
throned by United States naval forces. It
is now believed that she would resume an
attitude of open hostility to this Govern
ment in mere wantonness without a spe
cific object. Many persons believe when
she left here that the object of her visit
was to enter such a suit.

be filed against the Southern Pacific Rail
road for taxes and penalties for the past
four years, aggregating $150,000, and will
file the iirst suit on Monday or Tuesday
for $60,000. It is known that it is the in
tention of Attorney-General Taylor to file
all the suits within the next week unless
the attorneys come up and settle before
that time.
The $60,000 suit is for penalties for 1893
--94, and brings the question to a square
issue. The attorneys for Huntington
have claimed they were unable to make
any statement to the officers on account
of statistics which had to be sent to New
York and San Francisco. The Attorney-
General set a date upon which they were
requested to corue forward. Attorneys
Humphrey and Davis stated they had re
ceived statistics, but were compelled to
send them back to New York on account
of not being sufficiently full. This was
simply a move on their part to prevent
further legislation, and in the hope that if
the road should gain the suit there would
be no further remedy against them.
General Taylor anticipated this, and
recommended legislation which would
give further power to the Board of Valua
tion, and prevent the road from escaping
taxation.
Governor Bradley's call for the Legisla
ture to meet in extra session March 13,
issuea to-day, recommends the passage of
acts for proper legislation along this line,
and since the call was issued, the attor
neys for the road nave asked another con
ference with Attorney-General Taylor, but
it is not likely that terms will be reached,
as General Taylor will accept nothing
short of a complete settlement, and the
road's lawyers have already indicated that
they are not going to do this unless com
pelled to do so by enforcement.

Financial Relations Discussed and
Remedies Suggested.
LONDON, Eng., March s.â ln the
House of Lords to-day Lord Castleton
(Liberal) raised the question of the finan
cial relations between Great Britain and
Ireland and suggested as a remedy for the
grievances of Ireland the creation of a con
solidated fund, to be managed by Irish
financiers and utilized to promote Irish
industries and agriculture. * ,
Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State tor
War, speaking on behalf of the Govern
ment, advised that the House await the
report of the committee appointed to in
quire into the financial relations existing
between Great Britain and Ireland. Lord
Farrer (Liberal) expressed his disapproval
of the scope of the inquiry allowed to the
new commisssion.
Lord Morris, Lord of Appeal, expressed
the opinion that unjust taxation was
answerable for the downward course of
Ireland. He believed that crops would
disappear altogether and the people of
Ireland still further decrease in numbers
if the taxes were not reduced.
Lord Spencer (Liberal) thought that the
decrease of taxation in Ireland was the
only eventual solution of a safe measure
of home rule.

"for no good would come of it. What I

naming the new torpedo-boats as follows:
No. 1, Farragut; No. 6, Porter; No. 7,
Dupont; No. 9, Dahlgreu; No. 10, T. A.
Craven. The vessels are named after
naval officers who served with distinction
during the War of the Rebellion.
The order changes to Porter the narue
of torpedo-boat No. 6, which a few weeks
ago had been christened Farragut, in
order that No. 1, which is a much larger
boat and, which is expected to make much
greater speed, may be called after the
leading admiral. No. 10 is named for
Tunis A. Craven, who was lost when com
manding the monitor Tecumseh in Mobile
Bay, and who, when the pilot told him it
was time to abandon the ship, replied,
"Alter you, pilot." The pilot alone lived
to tell the story.

SECRETARY OLNEY
SHOWS HIS EARS
His Dignity Wounded by
the Inauguration Com
mittee.
Assigned to a Back Seat in the
Senate Chamber hj an
Oversight.
Explanations Are Unavailing, and
the Ex-Premier Declines to At
tend the Ceremonies-
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â The
causÃ of Secretary Olney's conspicuous
non-participation in the inaugural cere
monies is explained as follows:
Trie members of the Cabinet, in dis
cussing at Cabinet meetings last Tuesday
the parts assigned to them in the inaug
ural proceedings, found no provision in
the programme for their seats in the Sen
ate chamber or on the stand in front of
tho Capitol.
Secretary Thurber immediately com
municated with Secretary Sherman, chair
man of the arrangements committee, who
replied that heads of departments had
been provided for on the stand, but not in
the Senate. The programme was con
sulted again, and thin was found to be
true, but they were in the rear of mem
bers of the House of Representatives,
whereupon Secretary Olney declared that
he wouid not go to the Capitol at all. i
All the members of the Cabinet agreed
upon this action, but when Mr. McKinley
came to the White House yesterday and
started with Mr. Cleveland he noticed
that the Cabinet officers were not going
to accompany the parade, and, on in
quiry, learned the reason.
Senator Sherman, who was present, im
mediately offered to give front seats to
the secretaries on the floor of the Senate,
and Mr. Cleveland's advisers consented
to attend the ceremonies. None of them,
however, went on the stand as ''heads of
departments" to listen to the inaugural
speech, but hurried off to Secretary La
mont's house to bid Mrs. Cleveland
good- by.
Seretary Olney did not get Mr. McKin
ley's verbal invitation to go to the Capitol
because he was not at the White House
with bis colleagues in the morning, being
detained at the State Department all day
by important matters. He went, however,
to the ball in the evening, prepared to
escort Mrs. McKinley, according to the
adopted programme, but this wa3 disar
ranged at the last moment by Mrs. Me-
Kinley's weak condition compelling her
to have other assistance.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Marcb 5.-Ex-
Secretary of State Olney denies any per
sonal responsibility for the presence of
ex-Q leen Liliuokalani of Hawaii in the
diplomatic gailery of the Senate yesterday
and to offset the publication that the ex
regal presence there during the inaugura
tion was due to a surreptitious gift of a
tiiket to her by tne State Department, ex
hibits the following letter:
United States senate, Committee ox)

Hon. Richard Oiney, tfecretary of Stateâ sir: Ex-
QUeeti LmuokMlaiil is desirous of witnessing
the inauguration of the President ana Vice-
President-elect on the 4th of March, and she
has made application through her friends for
two seats, one for herself and one for her

It is impossible for the committee on ar
rangements to provide these places except in
the diplomatic gallery, but as the tickets to
that gallery are lo be sent to you for distribu
tion tbe committee does not feel at liberty to
assign seats in that gallery to any one.
It is, however, the judgment of the com

scats for the ex-Queen out of the sixty 10 be
sent you for the use of the diplomatic corps.
Very respectfully, John Sherman,

A. Hanna received his commission as
United States Senator from Governor
Bushnell this morning. Both the Gover

ton with its band to serenade B. H. War
ner of Washington, who had charge of the
civic parade yesterday. Mr. Warner
n.aie a little speeca and then Governor
Bushnell was calied out to make a few
remarks. He spoke of the beautiful
weather that marked the inauguration
day and said it was an omen of the bright,
sunny and prosperous administration that
the President wuuld give.

lowed the Governor's little speech, came
to the window of his apartment.
He was seen by the crowd, which
cheered with visor and called loudly for a
few words from the new Senator. Hanna
yielded to the importunities by coming
down to where the Americus Club men
and spectators were standing and made
some remarks in a happy vein.
NEW TIMBER IN THE SENATE.
Many Famous Characters Drop Out ot
Public Life With ihe Changtt ot
the Administration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â There
are a number of new faces in the Senate
that starts out with the incoming of the
McKiniey administration. There is the
fiery Foraker, to whom may be applied
a paraphrase of the historic remark ad
dressed to General McClellan on the oc
casion of his inauguration as Governor of
New Jersey in 1878: "Great Governor of
yesterday, great Senator of to-<iay; who
shall say but that greater honors may be
awaiting thee ?"
For the first time in thirty-seven years,
or since 1860, there is a Republican Sen
ator lrom the State of Maryland, George
L. Wellington succeeding Charles H.
Gibson as the colleague of Arthur Gorman.
David JB. Hill has said adieu to his as
sociates and Thomas C. Platt reaches the
height of his ambition in becoming a
regularly elected Senator from the Em
pire State. Big hearty, good-tempered
Senator Pusrh of Alabama is succeeded
by E. W. Pettis, and General John B.
Gordon of Georgia manes way for A. S.
Clay. Fred T. Dubois ot Idaho gives place
to Henry Heitlield, while the veneraole
John M. Palmer of Illinois surrenders his
seat to the joke-loving, story- telling
William E. Mason.
The silver-tongued oratory of the "Tall
Sycamore of the \Vabash," Daniel W.
Voorhees, will be bear<l no more in the
Senate chamber, and the dignified, some
what austere C. W. Fairbanks will co
operate with David Turpin in represent
ing the Hoosier State. " The great and
only Peffer also is retired to private life
in favor of Lucien Baker, and Senator
Blanchard gives way to ex-Governor
McEnery.
The last of the great Cameron dynasty
that for years held the political rule of
Pennsylvania in the hollow of its hand
has also said farewell to the highest leg
islative chamber, and Boise Penrose sits
beside his political maker and mentor,
Matthew S. Quay. Joseph H. Earl be
comes the cdieague of "the only Ti!l
-man" from South Carolina, succeeding
John Erby.
John L. Wilson succeeds Watson C.
Squire from Washington, and last but not
least John C. Spooner, the lit tie giant of
Wisconsin, resumes possession of the
seat that he surrendered six years erno to
William L. Vilas, and in doincr so has
honored himself and his State by paying
the highest tribute to the Senatorial
career of his political opponent.

of'the White House to-day in honor of the
new President, while prominent men,
scores of o'A friends and members of po

It was a nasty day. Cold rain fell all

During the afternoon Mrs. McKiniey held
part of a reception, as prominent a part as
her fatigued system would permit.
She sat for an hour or so at one of the

WASHINGTON, D. C, March s.â The
caucus of the House Republicans on Sat
urday evening, the 13th inst., will lack
the usual element of interest, ll will be
heid to nominate the House officials of
the Fifty-rifth Congress, which convenes

can be learned the present official list will
be renominated without opposition.
It was reported several wenks ago that
the Illinois delegation would present a
candidate for sergeant-at-arms in opposi
tion to Mr. Russell, out the purpose seems
to have been abandoned. Thert* seems to
be no candidate in opposition to Mr. Reed
or the other officers, except for sergeant
at-arms.
The call for the Democratic caucus has
not been issued. The caucus will prob
ably be held on the morning of the 15tti

REDWOOD CITY TO
FETE THE NATIVES
Elaborate Preparations for
the Grand Parlor's
Session.
Various Amusements to Relieve
the Monotcny of Routine
Wcrk.
Committees Laboring tc Fully Pro
vide for All Who Attend
the Meeting.
KEDWOOD CITY, UAL.. March s.â The
meeting of theGraiul Parlor of the Native
Sons of the Golden West, 10 be held in
Redwood City during the Jast week in
April, gives promise of being very success
ful. Ever since the decision of that body,
when in session at San Luis Obispo last
year, to ijold its next session at Redwood
City the members of the local parlor have
been quietly at work planning for the
event and as the date approaches their
energies are constantly increased ant their
enthusiasm intensified. Everything that
can possibly be don- to give the Native
Sons a grand reception and good ij me gen
erally is being done.
The monotony of the routine work of
the parlor will be enlivened by various
forms of amusement and entertainment.
Money is pouring in to the already large
iund, and even now enough has been sub
scribed and collected to carry out the
plans which the ways and means com
mittee had originally outlined; but as
more is added from time to time, the com
mittee will enlarge and vary its plans
accordingly. From the time tlie sub
scription paper was started, some two
weeks ago, the committee has succeeded
in raising something over $2000, and it is

seeking for the most suitable quarters in
the city in which to place the delegates
when they arrive. Rooms in the hotels
have already been engaged and all accom
modations will have to be obtained
through this committee.
FRESNO HAISIN-GROWERS' ACT.
Will Send a Delegation to Washington to
Work for a Protect, ye
Tariff.
FRESNO, Cal., March s.â The leading
rai?in-growers and business men of Fresno
met this afternoon and heard the report
of the committee appointed at a meeting
yesterday regarding a p.'an of campaign
to have the du'.y on Zante currants in
creased from trie rate recommended by
the Ways and Means Committee. During
the past few years the Grecian currants
have been classed as dried grape 3 and
were subjected to the import duty of I}<
cents, which was the rate on raisins and
grape products. In the new tariff bill it
is proposed to take Zante currants from
the classification of dried grapes, on which
the new measura imposes a tariff of 2%
cents, and fix a separate tariff of only 1
cent a pound on them. Without sufficient
protection the foreign product would be a
strong competitor in this country with
home raisins.
The enactment of the recommendation
of the Ways and Means Committee would
be injurious to southern Caliiornia's
great Industry, and those who are vitally
interested are therefore taking steps to
make a strong contest tor a fair adjust
ment in the tariff schedule as far as it ai
fects them.
It is proposed to send a delegation, con
sisting of Dr. Chester Rowe.l. Colonel
William Forsyth, U. J. Woodward and
Arthur Briges, to Washington to work
nmong the Congressmen and convince
them of the error of the recommendaiion
of the Ways and Means Committee. A
finance committee will be set at work im
mediately to raise about $10,000 to defray
the expenses of tne delegation, to assist
which it is the purpose to enlist the ser
vices of ex-Congressman Bowers.
fremo Farmer*' Institute.
FRESNO, Cal., March s.â The second
day's session of the Fresno County
Farmers' Institute was more largely at
tended than that of yesterday. Pruiessor
M. E. Jaffa made a very interesting talk
on dairying, giving the farmers valuable
suggestions on the art of butter-making.
B. W. Rowiey spoke on "Diversified Farm
ing." "Poultry Raising" was the s.ibject
of an excellent paper by K. F. Mitchell
and the programme closed with a dis
course by J. P. Johnston on "Small
Fruits." The institute has been a success
ful one in every way.
La Orange Miner Hats loadntoolt.
MODESTO, Cal.. March s.â Another

Palo Alto Water Bond* Bold.
PALO ALTO, Cal., March s.â Palo Alto
disposed of us $40,000 water bonds yeater
day to J. F. Warren of Portland, Or. The
bonds were voted for at a popular election
last year. E. D. Vincent has been awarded
the contract to put in the water system,
and work will commence within ten day*.
The supply at present is inadequate for
the needs of tne town as a few recent
fires have demonstrated.
SAM PEDRO'S REAL ESTATE BOOM.
Property Purchased in the Morning Trebles
in Value Before the Sun
Goes Down.
LOS ANGEL.ES, Cal., March s.â The
excitement over raal estate transactions
at San Pedro consequent upon the deci
sion of the Harbor Commissioners desig
nating that port as the Bite for the deep
water harbor has had no parallel in
Southern California since the halcyon
days of the boom. The town is thronged
with strengeis, nearly all of whom are
bent on purchasing some of the precious
dirt in or near the village. The specula
tive fever has taken possession of the resi
dents, and every one is op the gui vive for
"pointers" as to ihe best locations.
Everybody seems to have money now to
purchase lots or tracts of land a: San Pe
dro. The wildest and most absurd stories
have been set afloat in ihe town by a
coterie of practical jokers as to the most
seductive snaps in real estate. In some
instances these yarns have been taken for
sober truths, and have resulted in pur
chases in the most unpromising portions
of the town. The appreciation in the
value of real estate at San Pedro has been
the most rapid ever known in Southern
California. Lots purchased in the fore
noon have been sold in the afternoon of
the same day at an advance of 300 per
cent.
The syndicate of which John T. Gaffey
is the head placed a large block of lots on
the market yesteiday afternoon, and fifty
of them were sold before sundown, men
standing in line for hours lor a chance to
buy.

Alt Objects Upon Which Dora Marks Gazes

VANCOUVER, B. C, March r j.â As
every one knows when ono looks through
* camera all objects in sight appear to he
upside down. There is a little girl in
Victoria whose eyes are to her like a
camera. ShÂ« sees all objects upside down
and she is the envy of her school males at
the Central public school, because during
her writing lesson her copy-book is placed
bottom side upward in front of her and
she writes wiin her left hand. If the
copy-book is placed in the usual way she
forms the letters with great difficulty.
The girl is Dora Marks, the 11-year-old
daughter of S. Marks. At her music
lesson the sehoolteacber must stand on

cording to the book, for the music is
placed on the rack upside down. When
Dora and her father read the nuwspaner
her father places it beiore him as ordi

opposite him and upside down, as other
people don't. In fact the whole world is
upside down to Dora. Her case puzzles

BURGLARS AT WILLLAMS.
Three Business Houses in the Town
Visiied by a Band of Midnight
Prowlers.
COLUSA, Cal., March s.â The town of
Williams, ten milei-west of Colusa, was
visited by burglars last night and three
business houses were entered. The thieves
first turned their attention to the hard
ware-store of B. P. Grover.which they en
tered by cutting a hole through the bact
door, through which they put their hands
and threw back the lock. Here they ob
tained about $75 worth ot razors, knives
and pistols. Next they visited the post
office, where they succeeded in getting the
doer unlocked, but were unable to open it
because it was fastened with a wooden bar
across on the inside.
They gave up this attempt and crossed
the street to Peter Grazer's saloon, where
they again succeeded in unlocking a rear
door. They were preparing to ransack
the place when they were frightened away
by a man sleeping in an adjoining room,
who heard them and got up to investigate.
One of the robbers is believed to have
been "Billy the Kid," who robbed the
same store about a year ago. He wan seen
in the vicinity of Williams the day before
the robbery.
SPOKANE'S THRIFTY OFFICIALS.
Populists Elevated to Office Mora Their
Families Into the County
Courthouse.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 5.â A sen
sation has been created here by the dis
covery to-day that a number of recently
installed Populist county officials have
moved tbeir families into the big court
house and are there domiciled paying no
rent. All told nineteen people sleep,
cook and eat in the building-.
The overpowering smell from the cook
ing together with the presence of chil
dren about the corridors caused an in
vestigation to be made. It was then found
tuat five families of the officials ana
employes were inhabiting rooms in the
basement ami on the heretofore unoccu
pied top floor. The wife of one of the
employes is taking boarders from among
the employes in the building. Of the
Populist county commissioners, two
membsrs live some distance from the
city. They fitted up a vacant courtroom
as a sleeping-room for themselves. They
profess to see nothing wron^ in so doing.
HID Fit DIES JVBAJt rOICTLAXD.
Believed to Bare Much Wealth Burled
About Hi* But.
PORTLAND, Or., March s.â Joseph
Leonard, an aged hermit, bavin.: for
many years dwelt in an old hut about
twelve miles from here, is lying at the
morgue. Owing to his reputed wealth,
with the miser's habit of secreting it near
at band where he might gloat over it,
and also that he was involved in litiga
tion which was to be heard to-day in
Judge Shattuck's court, it was believed
by many of Leonard's neighbors that the
old hermit had met with violence.
Circumstances do not, however, go to
farther this belief. He was a man nearly
70 years of age, and taking into consider
ation his utter neglect of the most ordi
nary hygienic rules, the sparse, wretched
food which he allowed himself, with the
lick of proper clothing, it is to be won
dered at that Leonard survived this life
the length of years he did.
Leonard was an eccentric character,
alleged to have had no social relations
witn any one for the past twenty years.
It is said that almost ten years ago he
drew $12,000 out of a bank in this city,
and as his expenses amounted to less
than $100 a year it is presumed that the
money is cached somewhere near his late
place of habitation.

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND MAKES ONE WELL !
In March, April and May use Paine's
celery compound.
And only Paine's celery compound! For
it is nature's remedy.
Do not for a moment confound it with
any of the ignorant, catcbpenny.short-lived
patent remedies â sarsaparillas, nervines

Paine's celery compound cures disease.
It makes peoola well. It has saved the

It purities the blood and enriches the

GREAT RACE FOR SAN JOSE.
Cyc/ist "Bunt" Smith Will Race Against a
Locomotive and Try to Beat tho
Mile Record. .
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 5.â C. M.
("Bunt") Smith, one of the crack riders
of the Garden City Cyclers, will ride a
rjile, paced by a locomotive, near Law
rence, ten miles west of this city, on May
% The object of this novel binycie feat is
to lower a similar railroad mile record
made by E. E. Anderson of St. Louis last
summer, who rode a mile in 1 :03.
All alona Smith has declared that he
could lower that record, and has been in
negotiation with the Southern Pacific offi
cials for some months concerning the
race. Last evening be received word that
the arrangements ior the test had been
completed mid the- date set for May 2.
The fastest engine owned by the road will
be assigned the tass of pacernaking.
The road between the rails will be
planked for a distance of three miles.
This will jrive the rider a mile to get up
speed, a mile in which to ride for a record
and a mile in which to slow up. The lo
comotive to be used will have two cars at
tached, and if necessaay a speed of a mile
in fifty seconds can be attained. The rear
end of the second car will be boarded up,
the boards reaching to within an inch of
the rails. The boards will be painted
black, but tnere will be white stripes
extending down the center to serve as a
euide for the wheelman following the
train.
"Bunt" Smith will soon begin training
for the event. He is confident he can go
the distance at first trial in at least live
seconds less than Anderson's time of 1:03.
He is a game and speedy rider, and
has demonstrated his racine ability in
many contests. In a five-mile road race
over the Milpitas course his time was 10 :20
flat, which time has never been beaten in
a road race on this coast.
The ride behind a locomotive will un
doubtedly attract several thousand people.
The Southern Pacific Company will run
excursions from all of the important
cities of Central California, and every
wheelman within a day's ride of Lawrence
will be on hand. As the affair will take
place just before the opening of the San
Francisco carnival, it is expected that sev
eral thousand Eastern pleasure-seekers
will come to Santa Clara County to witnesa
an attempt to lower the fastest bicycle
mile ever ridden on earth.
SANTA CLARA CATTLE-THIEF.
Officers Arrest a Youth After He Has
Disposed of Stolen
Stock.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March s.â Alphonse
Roberts, a young Spaniard, was arrested
by Sheriff Lyndon this morning on a
charge of stealine nine head of cattle from
J. M. Kenyon, a rancher near Smithi
Creek. A few days ago Roberts offered to
sell the cattle to G. Wendte, a butcher,
and the latter notified Sheriff Lyndon.
Wendte was instructed to continue nego
tiations with Roberts and a trap was set
for the thief's capture. Roberts was paid
$25 down and was to be given the balance
on the delivery of the cattle. The stock
was turned over to Wendte at his place on
the Mount Hamilton road last evening,
and tiiis morning he came to town with
Roberts to pay over the money.
They went to Greenfield's grocery, on
the corner of First and St. John streets,
where Sheriff Lyndon and Under Sheriff
Bemon were awaiting them, and in the
presence of the officers Roberts signed a
bill ot sale for the ca:tle and accepted a
check for $122 6U. As soon as the sale was
accomplished Roberts was arrested by
Sheriff Lyndon. Others are implicated id
the theft, among them F. Sagardia, the
stepfather of the prisoner, and more ar
rests will probably be made.
J. M. Kenyon, the owner of the cattle,
swore to a warrant before Justice Dwyer
to-day charging Roberta with, grand
larceny.

SAN JOSE, Cal., March s.â The Santa
Clara < County Wine-makers' Association,
at a largely attended meeting in this city
yesterday afternoon, agreed upon 20 cents
per gallon as the minimum price at which
members, shall dispose of their vintage.
This price is the same as that set for wine
last year, and the action was taken owing
to the disposition of some of the members
to sell . at a ' lower rate. : ' The â  â  general
opinion of those present was that the
market was in a much better condition
than for several years and there were pros
pects lor increased prices. â  '
A resolution -was adopted asking the
president of the California Wine-makers'
Corporation to call a meeting ol the stock
holders for the purpose of discussing the
wine industry and to agree upon a uni
form minimum price for the year's prod
uct. Colonel Bendel, president of . the
Wine-makers' Corporation, who was pres
ent, stated that he would call a meeting
for some day next week in the Chamber
of Commerce building in San Francisco.

nerves are able to furnish sufficient energy
to the digestive organs.
No remedy in the world accomplishes
these results like Paine's celery compound.
It nburishes, regulates and invigorates the
entire nervous system, from the brain to
the minutest nerve filament. It causes an
increased appetite and tones up the
stomach to deal with the increased food.
Its nourishing action is immediately
manifest in a clearing up of the muddy,
unhealthy skin, an increase in weight and
more refreshing sleep.
First discovered after laborious, scientific
research by the ablest physician America
has produced â Professor Edward E.
Pheips, M.D., LL D., of Dartmouth Col-

by the best practitioners in every city of
America. It has been so enthusiastically
recommended by graiefulmen and women
in every walk of life that it is to-day in
every sense the most popular remedy the
world ever knew.
It has proven itself the greatest of all

Boston, St. Louis and two or three other
large cities the leading newspapers, mak-
ing their own canvasses again this year,
have found that the demand for Paine's
celery compound surpasses that of all
other remedies together.
Payne's celery compound, taken during
the early spring days, has even more than
its usual remarkable efficacy in making
people well. It makes short work of dis-
ease. It rapidly drives out neuralgia,
sleeplessness, dyspepsia and rheumatism
from, the system. It removes that lassi-
tude or "tired feeling," which betokens
weakened nerVes and Door blood.
Women working in close offices; sales-
women, tired oat an>i nervous from long
hours' standing on their feet and waiting
on impatient, irritating customers; over-
worked, worried ana disheartened men
and women everywhere, will be astonished
to find how much happier life becomes
when their nerves have been strengthened
and their blood purified by means of this
great remedy.

proval of a like body of educated men and
women and professional men, nor has
A practicing physician in Shelbyville relates that his atten-
tion was first directed to
by a brother doctor while on a visit to the National Capi-
tol at Washington, D. C, some years ago. " 1 first used
the Tabules myself experimentally," says the Illinois
doctor, '' and derived such benefit from them that I at once
adopted them as a part of my medical armormentarium.
They have given great satisfaction and in one case where
the stomach was infected by large stomach worms, the
Tabules destroyed the worms and expelled them, greatly
to my surprise and also to the permanent relief of my
patient."

remedy used.
Prof." Phelps had studied the nerves Jn
health and disease, when well nourished
and when under-nourished, in men and
women and children years before he
locked for the remedy. Paine's celery
compound is the outcome of his entire
professional life. It is the one remedy
that the world could not lose to-day at
any price.
Paine's celery compound induces the
bouy to take on solid flesh.
Physicians recognize Paine's celery com-
pound as the one scientific spring remedy,
and it is universally prescribed by them
wherever there is yreat need of a vigorous
and prompt restoring of health and
strength to the worn-out system.
Paine's celery compound is the best
spring remedy because it is more than a
mere spring lemedy. It brings about a
healthy appetite, complete digestion, re.^-

Second B ack Eve.
CARSON, Xkv., March 5.â A was
this afternoon cast over the training
camps of the two famous pugilists who
are soon to battle for the world's cham
pionship. The weather clerk is to blame
for it all. We were awakened this morn
ing by a rattline of shutters and sough
ing of trees, and the oldest in
habitants inlormed us that something
was coming off. Just wnat this some
thing was to be they hesitated to say, but
from their iolemn expressions of counte
aanie it was more than obvious that they
looked for more serious results than tho^e
usually left by a passing zephyr. As the
day greÃ' older the blow increased in vio
lence until it finally reached a stage when
there could no longer be any doubt as to
what was in store. A snowstorm was
plainly in sight. For a time the opti
mists of Carson beseeched the tenderfeet
not to worry, and told them that if they
FITZ TRIES OUT HIS WHEEL WITH RESULTS AS ABOVE.
were patient they would witness a calm, '
and after that more of the pleasant
weather that has been enjoyed during the
past week.
"It's only one of those winds that come
along opportunely at this time of the year
and dry up the roads," they would say.
But predictions and customs were swept
away by this windâ a wind that would
have made envious the historical big wind
in Ireland, and along about 4 o'clock this
afternoon flakes of snow began to flit into
town and into the faces of pedestrians.
There has been no cessation of the visita
tion, and to-night Carson is cloaked in a
mantle of immaculate white.
But to return to the beginning. This
eudden and unexpected change in the
weather has sent sadness and disappoint
ment into both training camps. And no
wonder, for it practically means an end to
road work in tne open air â branch of
the preparatory work whicti the handlers
of both Corbett and Fitzsimmons liave
deemed most important of late. Both of
the big fellows delight to take a spin on
their Dikes, in addition to getting out on
dry roads for sprinting matches with their
trainers, but to-night's change means that
they will have to be content with Arcti:
shoes and furs in preference to bikes and
spikes.
â¢ This sudden reversal of climatic condi
tions has given rise to much animated dis
cussion in all parts of Carson as to which
of the two big iellows will suffer most by
the new conditions. The consensus of
opinion is that It will work more to the
advantage of Corbett than to that of Fitz
simmons. The reason given is this: When
both Corbett and Fitzsimmons arrived the
snow was a foot or more deep for miles
and miles surrounding Carson. The Cali
fornian immediately elected to do only
indoor work and his trainers acquiesced,
not particularly for their own convenience
so much as for the safety of the cham
pion. Corbett himself said at the time
that inasmuch as he was in a strange
climate he would prefer not to take any
chances in exposing himself and woul i
rather do all of his training indoors and
go Into th ring without colds or rheuma
tism than to give anybody a chance to say
that he was unfit for the battle and de
liberately threw down his friends and
backers. >
But not so with Fitzsimmons. The red
headed athlete proclaimed at once that
snow was as propitious for training as was
the dry ground, and, although he was de
prived oi the pleasure he could have with
his erratic bicycle, he included a daily
trudge through the snow in his routine of
work auU stuck to it until the thaw had
set in and the roads become clear.
It is the knowledge of the preferences of
the two championship aspirants in regard
to training in the snow that has caused all
the discussion that is going on to-night.
If the storm continues with the violence
'hat characterizes it now, it simply means
that the roads will not be clear again until
alter the 17th of March. It may be that
Corbett will not adhere to his original an
nouncement that he would taKe no
chances out in the snow and that he will
adopt Fitzsiminons' tactics and brave the
elements rather than sacrifice the benefits
to be obtained by exercise out in the free,
open air.
He will have to fight with only the blue
sky over his head, an! the more outdoor
work he gets the better it will be for dim.
I am fully aware of just what James J.s
ideas are on this subject, for he has fre
quently unbosomed himseif to me during
his stay here. What he fears more than
anything else is thut he might meet with
some injury or contract a cold, or have
something happen winch' would leave
room for excuses for his defeat, if defeat
should be his portion, and for that reason
he has even refused to skylark with his
visitors or to venture out of doors at night,
or in fact to tak .* any chances whatever.
"If lam beaten in this contesi,' 1 he said
to me one day, "I want so be in a position
to tiike off my hat and say that my defeat
was due to the simple fact that I met a
better man and nothing more. I have
been trying to corral this man Fitzsim
mons in the ring for three years, and I
mean to whip him or disappear from the
Dublic gaze entirely. If I am in proper
condition I know I can whip himâ l have
always known it.
'â¢I am in perfect form right now to
achieve the victory and I do not feel that
I have thÂ° r sht, in view of the fact that
my friends are goinj: to wager $1,000,000
on my chances, to expose my-elf or take
the slightest risK of reversing that form.
I know myself better than anybody, ana
while I acknowledge that constant out- j
door work is beneficial, still I am equally
confident that I can eet ready for the bat
tle without going out and contracting
pneumonia or some other malady that
will unfit me for thecomingengagernent."
Jim made this little talk nearly a fort
night ago, when neither Billy Delaney
nor Charley White, his chief trainer, were
here. It may be that they will insist upon
outdoor work in spite ol the snow, and in
that event Corbett may change his mind.
I know that both of these trainers are
ereat sticklers for this class of work and I
can scarcely believe that a loot or so of
snow will cause them to abandon their
hobby. I would not be surprised, there
iore to see the champion out climbing
over drifts to-morrcw, encased in gum
boots and furs and feeling his way with an
Alpine staff.
Fiizsimmons goes out In his ordinary
clothing and romps and rolls in the snow
like a schoolboy, cut this dees not mean
that he is proof against the treachery of
the climate. He has already picked up
one severe cold during his training as the
result of his daring, and may find another
that will inconvenience him on St. Pat
rick's day.
The training induced in by the big fel
lows to-day was much the same as that
wiich lias been going on right along.
Fitzsimmons prowled around the hills
durini: the forenoon, then tramped into
town for his mail and in the afternoon
went through his course of bag-punching,
boxing, wrestling and working the wrist
machine.
When the Cornishman arrived in town
the first thing that was noticed as regards
his appearance was the fact that his left
optic looked as thoush somebody had been
ornamentine it with a hit of burnt cork.
This I ascertained was the handiwork of
Dan Hicker. B )b's boxing partner. Fitz
simmons sported a discolored eye last
week, also a present from Hickey, but it
did not pass beyond the carmine stage;
but this last one is of the full-fledged
variety and will probahly adhere to the
Cornishman's countenance until the day
of the big light. It bothers Bob not a
trifle, however; in fact, he seems rather
proud of it.
"It mean?," he said in his usual off
hand way to-tiay, '\hat when I box with
my trainers they have no instructions to
go easy, as I have reason to believe is the
case out at Shaws Springs. My boy= are
told to lay it on the best they know how,
and you can bet that they do it. In con
sequence I get some action and get used to
hard knocks. You see lam training for h
riehtand not a nice little parlor exhibi
tion. And I sail into my men as if I mean
to rut them out, and they expect it.
Look at that eye on Roeber. Isn't that a
peach?"
Corbett was out on the road, too, during
the forenoon, taking about a nine-mile
tramp- After luncheon he punched the
bag, boxed, played hand-ball, worked the
wrist machine and skipped the rope. It
was about the heaviest day's work he did
this week. Now that his wife and sister
have returned to San Francisco he has
started in to finish uj> his training with
more zeal than ever, and from the appear
ance of things the only iear his trainers
wili have is that he might do too much
work.
Dan Stuart did not come out for a sun
ning to-day, as has been the case sincn he
reacned a convalescent state. The weather
was too threatening and his doctors or
dered him to stay indoors. As a matter of
fact the genial, big Texan is not round
in-.'-to as rapidly as had been hoped for.
The effects of the pneumonia still cling to
him, and his friends are beginning to
doubt seriously whether he will be well
and strong enough to take charge of the
big carnival on the 17th of March. But
he has able assistants, and even if he is
forced to keep in his apartments the great
project will be carried through success
fully Just the same.
There is no longer any doubt about the
intention of many women to attend the
Corbett- Fitzsiramons contest. The first
ticket to admit a woman was sola to the
wife of a prominent Carson resident sev
eral days ago. She will accompany her
husband and occupy a box close to the
ring.
Since then applications have come in
for over fifty seats for womenâappli
cation^ coming from various parts of the i
United Statesâ and Secretary Wheelock j
says ie is confident that on the <ln y of the
contest there will be at least 1000 of the
fair sex present.
Escorteti by Architect Donohoe I spent
nearly an hour to-day in the arena where
the three big battles are to be fought.
The structure ia so near completion now
that one can form a fair idea of what a
mammoth affair it is. It is a ventoble re
production of the famous Coliseum of
Rome, except that it is more circular in
form that oval shaped. I climbed over
the seats to the very last row in order to
ascertain what sort of a view one could
obtain from that poiiit, anc j waÃ rea iiy
surprised. The tiers rise so sharply one
above the other tl at there can be abso
lutely no obstruction to a complet? view
of the ring. The last row is just 150 feet
from the ropes, but owing to the jierfect
a.'rangement of the seats this cannot be
considered a drawback at all.
These back seats will not be reserved
and will be sold tor $5 each. Separate en
trances and staircases are to be provided
for each section, so that there will be no
chance of confusion when the crowd
arrives. A cordon of barbed wire wiil
separate each of the divisions, thus pre
venting the usurpation of reserved seats.
A cowboy tournament is one of the lat
est additions to the carnival programme.
This feature will taKe place on the race
track on the loth and 10th inst. "Jimmy"

Dr. Guinan, the physician who yester
day examined Corbett and pronounced
him to be in perfect physical condition,
visited Fitzsimmons' camp this evening
for the same purpose. The Cornishman
readily submitted himself to the test. Or.
Guinan was thorough in everything he
did, and when he finished he smiled and
said that he guessed Fitzsimmons could
pass muster.
"I thought when I examined Corbett,"
he said, "that he was the most perfect
specimen of physical manhood I had ever
seen, but now I find that there are two
such beings in the world. Barring a
slight cold, Fitzsimmons is simply grand
so far as health and condition are con
cerned. He is marvelously developed
ahout the chest and shoulders, Â»nd I am
satisfied that he is fit to undergo a tre
mendoust test of endurance without dan
ger." J. G. Mansfibld.

Corbett Indulges in Four Lively Sparring
BoutÃ.
CARSON, Net., March s.â The chief
interest to-day centered about Corbett.
He had practically loafed for two days
and great things were expected of him.
Nobody was disappointed. Breakfast out
of the way Jim threw on a sweater and
called out his dog Laddie. Together they
rambled over the hills in the direction of
Empire, dodging a few jackrabbits and
dodging around innumerable bowlders.
Corbett does not fancy road work. He
claims that it stiffens his legs and im
pedes his rapid footwork, which saves him
from so many blow?.
After dinner he jusrgled with the wrist
machine for a quarter of an hour before
tackling the bag. Timing himself he
hooked the ball with his left continuously
for ten minutes and punched it with vigor
with straight rights and lefts for ten more.
Hurrying over to the court he called out,
Jeffries, with Edgren on deck, and the fun
be -an.
Tne bulky citrus belt Dugilist is improv
ing every day. His orders were to keep
coming and he followed them out. When
Jirt. backed into a corner Jeffries invaria
bly caught it, and a chorus of "Oh's"
went up from the female spectators.
Three minutes of hard work left Jeffries
puffing, but two little streams of perspira
tion trickling down Corbetts cheeks were
the only evidence that he had been work
ing. His bellows were operating beauti
fully.
Edpren is very quick on his feet, but
lacks experience. He lashes out with his
right as thoueh he were throwing a
sixteen-pound hammer, and before he
pains his balance Jim puts in a iew on
the body and perhaps a tap on the jaw.
He coaches the Berkeley giant continually
and promises to turn him out a finished
boxer. Most Judges agree that the talent
is there.
Con McVey was ronghlv handled by
the champion in their wrestling bout,
which followed Edgren's round. He ap
peared to be perfectly helpless, and Jim
banged him up against the wall time and
again, thumping bis breast meanwhile
like a Salvation Army drummer beating
time on a cold evening.
It was Billy Woods, however, who illus
trated the champion's kitting power.
With his armor blown up taut he strutted
out, only to be pounced upon like a wild
cat. Right and left Jim clogged him (in
the jaw, and when his guard went up he
caught it on the brenst with lon<:-range
straight drives or lightning uppercuts.
Each of the four men went through
four rounds of three minutes each before
Jim was satisfied. Then brother Joe and
Al Hampton played him two games of
handball each, after which he called it a
day's work.
Over at Fitzsimmons' quarters the reg
ulation programme went through without
a hitch. Bob took a morning walk and a
rub-down and put in two hours in the aft
ernoon wrestling with Roeber, sparring
with Hickey and Stezner and punching
the bag. Very lew spectators paid admis
sion to the gymnasium and altogether it
was a dull day around the Cornishman's
cottage.
Few people arrived to-day and no celeb
rities were reported on the road. The
Western Union brought in two additional
wires from Reno this morning, thus in
creasing its facilities to nine circuits, five
of which are quadruple! and two Wheat
stone. The time of transmission to the
East has been reduced to a minimum.
NO MONTE CARLO IN THEM.
Senate Bill 14 and Assembly Bill 260
Made Needed Provision in Reference
to Horseracing.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March s.âSen
ate bill 14, by Bert, and Assembly bill 266,
by Bettman, nave been assailed as having
been framed for :he purpose of creating a
Monte Carlo at Emeryville. A more erro
neous opinion of the measures which are
indicated could not well be formed.
The bills have been examined by com
petent attorneys, who declare that they
were framed solely and only for the pur
pose of legalizing the acts of the Board of
Supervisors who called an election for the
pupose of creating the town of Emeryville.
Foreign books are barred from the tracK
by an agreement between the two racing
associations, which is to last for two years,
and such a thing as a Monte Carlo there
is absurd.
The charge that Bettman is acting in
the interest of the Oakland track is un
founded. He had an Honorable reputa
tion when he went to Sacramento and has
done nothing to sully it.

PURE FOOD AND
ITS CHAMPIONS
An Interesting Meeting of
the Committee Yes
terday.
Soon a Convention Will Be
Called to Consider the
Question.
The Su'ject Also Discussed at a Con.
ference of Health Officials and
Professors.
The pure food committee of the Council
of Associated Industries met yesterday in
ti;e rooms of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, Mills building, to
consider further the question of grappling
with the sale of impure and adulterated
foods.
Among the subjects discussed was the
prosecution of cases already begun and
those soon to go on the calendar of Judge
Campbell's court; the attitude of the
Board of Health in keeping the result of
its analysis secret until passed upon
officially; the eeneral attitude of the press
on the question, and the advisability of
calling a convention for the near future in
order to bring the crusade more promi
nently before the public and arouse a
greater interest in the work now going on.
The action of the Board ol Health met
generally with commendation, as it is so
difficult to remedy an error when once it
gets out.
In prosecuting cases B. N. Raviey was
in favor of going after the manufacturers,
the fountain-heaii whence flows all that is
impure in the food line. The question
was raised at this time: "What are we eo
ing to do with manufacturers outside the
boundary of the State?"
Julian Sonntag thought it would be best
in this, as in most other cases, to make
haste slowly.
Oscar Lewis was appointed a committee
of one to wait on W. S. Barnes to see if
that attorney could elucidate the question
as to whom the war should be waged on.
The following resolutions, alter a cursory
discussion were adopted unanimously:
Whereas, The food reform movement is at
the present time becoming as it Is in other
States East and throughout the world one ol
the most important movement*-; and whereas,
the said movement against the adulteration
of foods of all kinds vitally coacerns the
health of our people, and us well the In
dustries of this State; and whereas, we bjlieve
that health should be paramount to all other
considerations; thereforo.be it
Resolved, By the pure tood committee of this
council, that a convention be called at Mieli
time as may be advisable in the uear future.
Be it further
Resolved, That a committee of five be ap
pointed to arrange details regarding the said
conveution.
The convention will probab y bs held
some lime within two or three weeks.
It will probably be held under the aus
pices of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, as that body was the
first to anitate the pure- food movement.
Reports of all committees will be made
to-day at the meeting of the council,
booked for 2 p. M.
A meeting of the Board of Health was
held iast evening to confer witn Professor
Rising, Slate analyst, and Professor \V.
T. Wenzel, chemist of the board, with re
gard to the movement for pure foods. It
was presided over by Dr. J. F. Morse,
chairman of the committee on milk and
food.
Isador Jacobs and Oscar Lewis were
present, representing the lood committee
of the Council of Associated Industries.
J. B. Reinstein, regent of the university,
who has been instrumental in forming
plans for the crusade, was also present
and advised the chemists as to their duties
under the law. He said that it would not
be necessary for them to make exact
analyses of foods, but to discover
whether deleterious adulterations be in
troduced or the quality or strength re
duced, or whether ttie article was what it
was represented to be.
Mr. Jacobs said the crusade for pure food
to be inaugurated by the board would be
of vast benefit to fruit-growers and to
other producers in this State; that canned
fruits were being imported to California
from London in such great quantities that
the grower here was practically starving,
the reason being tuat packers adulterated
here to such an extent that merchants
had to go abroad to get pure goods.
"If the packers here were honest," said
Mr. Rein-tein, "the fruit-growing indus
try along would support the State. By
their adulterations the packers have
driven business away from them and
paralyzed the industry."
"This movement will spread over the
State once it is inaugurated here," said
Jacob).
"It will mnke an enormous sum of
money for the State; it is the best thing
that has been done for it in a long time;
it gives a value to the products of the
State at once."
Professor Rising said he wonld be glad
to co-operate with the chemist of the
board in every wiiy. He saw ihe neces
sity for iho movement, he said.
Food was adulterated to an extent not
popularly understood. Vory cheap ar
ticles in "oiive oil," for instance, was
almost without exception nothing more
than cotton-seed oil flavored with mus
tard seetl. As to wine?, he hail heard so
many reports cf late of adulterations that
he was appalled.
The pure-food crusade will be in
aupurated vigorously at once, and
wherever adulterations are discovered
prosecutions will be begun.
Dr. Morse thanked the eentleraen of the
Associated Industries, Mr. Reinstein and
the chemists for responding to such short
notice, and the meeting adjourned.

HER SON IN SANTA CRUZ'S JAIL
Aged Woman Walks From San Francisco
to Â¥isit Her Imprisoned
Offspring.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March s.â An at
fecting demonstration of a mother's love
for her boj- was witnessed here yesterday
in the meetine at the County Jail of Mrs.
Williams of San Francisco and her son, J.
Moss, who has been sentenced, together
with J. P. Densen, to eighteen months in
the State Prison for stealing Fisherman
Perez's boat. The mother was too poor to
pay her fare to Santa Cruz and when she
heard of her boy's trouble she started
afoot, walking the entire distance. From
the time she le(t San Francisco until she
reached this city there was hardly an hour
when rain was not falling or a cold wind
blowing, but it dla not change her pur
pose.
She would have saved her son from the
disgrace of a term in prison had it been
within her power, but there was no eto
couragement to be derived from the facts
in the case. The evidence aeainst the
young man is too strong, and District At
torney Carl Lindsay had, before her ar
rfval, secured a plea of guilty without the
expense of a trial.

A DEAD MAN'S
NAME IS NEEDED
Sterling A. Hopkins, the Old
Marshal, Is Wanted
in Alameda.
His Signa ure Demanded by the
Heirs ot the Late Mayor
Andrus.
But the Marshal of the 0 d Vigilantes
Died in the Baitb of the Wider
ness in Sixty-Four
A recent inquiry for Sterling A. Hop
kine, who was a prominent member of the
famous Vigilance Committee of 1856, has
come from several local attorneys, who
want bis evidence to clear the title to a
piece of land at the southeast corner of
Manuel and Jackson streets, Alameda,
being a part of the estate ot the late ex-
Mayor W. R. Andrus of Oakland.
"This inquiry siiows how short is the
memory of the masses," said Attorney Os
car T. Shuck, yesterday. "My Statistical
Abstract shows," said be, "that Hopkins
was killed in the Battle of the Wilderness
on June 1, 1864. This information cannot be
found in the San Francisco newspapers,
but is in the old files of the Sacramento
Union."
The point about which lawyers are wor
ried could be cleared by Hopkins if the
dead could speak, but tbe attorneys in the
case have not yet learned of Hopkins'
death, though bis long silence, in view of
his prominence in pioneer times, might
indicate that he had died.
In 1856 Hopkins was Marshal of San
Francisco. While he was )o the act of ar
resting a notorious character he was
stabbed in the neck by David S. Terry, at
thai time Caliiornia's Chief Justice.
For a long time HopkinÃ* life trembled
in the balance, during which time the
Vigilantes decided that they would hang
Judge Terry if the wound resulted in
death. At the time of the stabbing Hop
kins was in the act of arresting Reuben
Mallony. who had been captured on the
bay by Vigilance officers. Maiionev had
taken refuae in a room at the State
Armory, at the corner of Washington and
Kearny streets.
Judge Terry was present at the time of
the attempted arrest and he declare i that
nobody should be arrested in his presence
by any person claiming authority from
an illegally constituted tribunal. Hop
kins retired fur a time and returned with
an armed force. Judge Terry presented a
rifle, which Hop&lns seized, whereupon
Terry plunged a dagger into the back of
his neck, severing the carotid artery.
The Vigilantes then filled the streets to
the number of 1500, surrounding tbe
armory where Terry and his friends were
barricaded. All this occurred on June 20,
and Terry was not released until August 7.
It is probable that the absence of Hop
kins' signature to the deeds in question
will result in a compromise among his
heirs, for the omission of the ancestor's
signature gives some of them a color of
right to several valuable tracts of prop
erty.
PIUTES .<OAJX MAMPA.NT. ,

. -. , . ... Ma Â» on -Talleif Murder. â  â  â '"' â¢"
VIRGINIA, Net.; March s.â The pros
pect of trouble between the Piutes and
whites has not yet disappeared.
The cause of the uprising last week,
when the militia was called out, was the
murder of a Piute named Jim King in
Mason Valley by a man named Logan.
King was killed while protecting his sister
from assault. Logan escaped and the
Indians threatened trouble if he was not
punished. He was captured and the oat
break subsided.
Preliminary examination of Logan was
held yesterday before the Justice of the
Peace at Dayton, Lyon County, in which
Mason Valley is situated. The examina
tion was a farce and Logan was acquitted.
He was put in the County Jail, however,
for safe keeping, and during the day Cap
tain Dave, chief of the Mason Valley
Piutes, secured an onier from District
judge Mack of this place holding Logan
for trial.
In the meantime fifty Pintes armed
with Winchesters guard the Dayton jail
and a party of twelve Indians, also armed,
search every outgoing train to mike sure
that Logan is not spirited away. A race
war is imminent if Logan is not punished.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., March s.â High rains
for twenty-fonr hours have again started
the rivers rising. Telegrams from New
Madrid and Bellefontaine, Mo., state that
the New Madrid sfnk is under water and
families are forced to the hills for safety.
Much alarm is felt in the peninsula, as a
high stage of water increases the danger
of the threatened cut-off irom the Miss

above their juncture.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
pâ â â â _^â^
bATUHDAY MARCH 6, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
4429 inches
of advertisements, which is
318 inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
Things are moving already.
The extra session is in sight.
McKinley's inaugural address was a ten
strike.
Keep the ball rolling for the Federal
building.
This is going to be a workingman's ad
ministration from start to finish.
Bryan got out of Washington before in- I
auguration day, but he wasn't missed.
The protective tariff bill will be ready !
to report as soon as Congress meets, and j
there will be no delay.
By providing work for the unemployed
the new boulevard will open a way for j
rosrerity to return to many a household. j
There is reason to believe that even the
Senate will quit fooling and promptly at
tend to business when the tariff bill comes
up.
You will wish all the news and lots of
other good reading for your leisure to
morrow, so leave orders to-day for The
Sunday Call.
The biscuit trust is a combination
which should have been well cooked up,
but nevertheless it has flattened out as if
it were dough.
It is well known that politics makes
strange bedfellows, but it never cut a
stranger caper than when it put Cleve
land and Hill into retirement together.
McKinley said nothing directly abou;
Cuba, but his pledge to insist "upon the
enforcement of the lawful rights of Ameri
cana everywhere" had better be read care
fully by the Spaniards and duly attended
to. _
Cleveland had a talent for making ene
â  ruie?, and McKinley has a genius for mak
ing friends. That is the difference be
tween the two men, and it will make a
erÂ»at difference in the government of the
"country.
It does not seem. that the Democratic
nomination for Speaker of this Congress
would be much in the way of spoils, and
yet Bland, McMillin and Bailey are
fighting for it as if it were a bone with
meat on it.
As the Boston Herald asserts that in
that city "the men worth knowing are
not the men who are socially known" it
is clearly evident the editor isn't getting
the invitations to swell parties he thinks
he has a right to.
The most disturbing condition of the
Government is the deficiency in the reve
nue. It amounted to over $4,266,000 for
the month of February, and the Presi
dent has certainly acted wisely in calling
Congress together to remedy the evil.
It is hard to believe that so good a
fighter as Theodore Roosevelt desires to
back out of the row he has raised in New
York, but all the same hi? eagerness to
obtain a place at Washington as Assistant
Secretary of the Navy looks like a willing
ness to take water.
Weyler's return to Havana was probably
prompted by the knowledge that in his
treatment of American citizens in Cuba
he will have a different administration at
Washington to deal with hereafter. It
is time for him to hunt a quiet place in the
palace and devise a new policy.
The President says: "Congress should
give prompt attention to the restoration
of our American merchant marine. To
my mind few more important subjects so
imperatively demand its intelligent con
sideration." That is the right kind of
politics. It means trade, it means com
merce, it means business.
With the retirement of Hill, Voorhees,
Vilas, Blackburn and Palmer there will
be hardly enough Democratic statesmen
left in the Senate to organize a caucus or
conduct a parliamentary battle. ; If old
Senator Morgan should break down the
Democratic Senators would have to follow
Populist leadership or resort to bush
whacking. â¢
A Minnesota heiress induced her mother
to co to a matinee, and then sent for her

When the father returned from business
and the mother from the play they found
the daughter had made a play that meant
business and was safely married. That
scheme beats elopement on a bicycle and
breaks the record.
A bill has been introduced into the Mas
sachusetts Legislature authorizing any
railroad corporation in the State to con
struct along public highways branches of
its main line to be operated as electric
roads under the same terms as street rail
ways. The bill if passed is expected to work
a revolution in local transportation and
has caused as much comment as if it were
an insurrection. j
HIS BEST FRIEND.
He is the best friend of laboring men, skilled and unskilled, who giyes them
employment at remunerative wag*s. Every private and public enterprise that gives
such employment to our people should be encouraged. American workmen are the
bone and sinew of the country. We are a nation of toilers, in shop and factory, in
forest and mine, on farms and rivers. Federal and State Government should inaug
urate and resolutely carry on wise and permanent improvements. Here in San Fran
cisco the Federal building should be pushed to early completion. The erection of
this much-needed building would give employment, directly and indirectly, to thou
sands of our citizens, rnnny of whom are now teeking in vain for worK. Work means
wages, and wages bring food and shelter to wives and children.
During the four years just past the people have drunk deep of the cup of sorrow.
We have been taught in the hard school of experience; we have seen the ruin
wrought by unwise legislation; we have had brought to our own hearths ana fire
sides want, misery and despair, and this in a land of wondrous natural resources and
opportunities 1 Business depression has prevailed everywhere. No State, no section
of the country has escaped. Idle mills and shops, idle men and women â these have
been the immediate cause and the effect of the hard times.
It is the duty of statesmanship; it is the duty of the Government â Federal, State
and municipal; it is the duty of citizens, in their private capacity, to give the largest
possible employment to our people. Laws should be passed with the avowed object
of favoring American laborers in every calling. It is believed that a brighter and
better day is dawning. Light is breaking through the clouds tnat have hnng over us
like a pall. As Californians, let us assist one another, and to that end let us work in
harmony; let us bend every energy toward furnishing employment to our people; let
us put forth every effort to build up our Stateâ develop our mines, increase our
domestic trade, add to the tillable acreage of our valleys and hillsides, encourage by
patronizing home manufacturesâ and generally, in season and oat of season, endeavor
to hasten the return of business activity, which means individual contentment and
happiness.
In this good and patriotic work The Call will continue to co-operate with its
brethren and with every organization whose purpose is the development of California
and the welfare of her people.
THE NEW CABINET.
It is gratifying to the country to note
that in selecting his Cabinet President
McKinley has exercised a choice which
shows him to be not more wise in defining
a policy of governmental action than in
selecting fit men to carry it out. Many a
man capable of planning sagaciously
lacks tbe talent of selecting men able to
execute what has been planned. Presi
dent McKinley sbows that he is not of
that nature. He posseses both the quali
ties necessary for a chief executive. He
can direct wisely and is also a sufficient
judge of men to know how to choose the
agents who are to carry on the work.
The only selection made by the new
President against which any adverse
criticism has been directed was the
choice of Senator Sherman for Secretary
of State. Fortunately the Senator has
been so long in public office and for many
years has so ably acted as chairman of
thn Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions that bis record is a sufficient answer
and refutation to the attacks of his assail
ants. In every other casa the man chosen
for the office has been so clearly fitted for
the performance of its duties that public
approval has followed promptly upon the
announcement of the name.
It is certain that this will be one of the
most notable Cabinets in the history of
the country. Sherman, Gase, Long, Me-
Kenna, Bliss, Gary, Alger and Wilson con
stitute a notable assembly of statesmen.
While each has a special fitness for the
work for which he has been selected, all
are well versed in the general affairs of
the country, are skilled in ihe conduct of
business and will form not only a wise
council for the President, but an able and
efficient corps of execnti^e officers to ad
minister the great departments of the
Government.
In one notable respect the new Cabinet
differs from that which has fast gone out
of office. It does not contain a single un
known or untried man. Ail oi them have
bad experience in the conduct of great
affairs, and all of them have achieved emi
nence and distinction in the country. The
people do not have to search around to
find out about these men as they did about
those whom Cleveland raised from com
parative obscurity to Cabinet offices, not
so much to advise him as to take orders
from him in the management of official
business.
The country is to be congratulated upon
this Cabinet hardly le-s than upon the ac
cession to office of the Pr sident who has
selected them. They will conduct the
business of their various departments in
such a way as to add to the efficiency of
the Government and to subserve the best
interests of the people. California may
rightly rejoice in having a representative
among them, and she can find satisfaction
moreover in the knowledge that he who
represents her holds not the least impor
tant office in the Cabinet, nor is the least
fitted for the honor bestowed upon him or
for the responsibilities of the duties be
has undertaken.
THE FEDERAL BUILDING.
The action taken at a joint meeting of
the principal commercial bodies of the
City on Thursday will go far toward bring
ing about a speedy beginning of the work
upon the Federal building. The action
was in full accord with the prevailing sen
timent of tbe people and will, undoubt
edly, find cordial support from the Cali
fornia delegation in Congress.
As a result of the meeting a memorial
was addressed to the Senate and House of
Representatives in Congress urging tbe
necessity and wise policy of promptly
constructing the building, and a letter
was addressed specially to the California
delegation requesting active aid in pro
curing the commencement of the impor
tant work. Both the memorial and tbe
letter were excellent in tone and in terse
neis of language. They will not fail to
have effect upon those who receive them,
and we may count upon seeing more
energy displayed in the work by the Gov
ernment officials than has been done at
any time since the construction of the
proposed building was first advocated.
As was pointed out in the letter to the
California delegation the present time is
especially propitious for the commence
ment of the work. Building materials
are lower than ever before in this market
and a large number of men are unem
ployed. Tbe public service needs the
building and as the money has been pro
vided there is no reason why the work
should not begin.
The new administration will be as favor
able to public enterprise as the Cleveland
administration was adverse. Its sym
pathies are with the workingmen of the
country, and its officials will be only too
glad to afford employment for them as
promptly as possible. We may confi
dently count, therefore, upon a favorable
response to the memorial and to the
letter.
Thk Cai,l began the new agitation on
this subject because it recognized the im
portance of acting promptly at this junc
tnre, and having now tbe assistance of
the Chamber of Commerce, the Board of
Trade, the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, the Merchants' Association,
the Builders' Exchange, the Oakland
Board of Trade, tbe Siate Board of Trade
and tbe Labor Council, it feels certain
that the agitation will be rewarded with
complete success. The movement for ob
taining the building has been well ad
vanced In this City, and we have no doubt
the energy here displayed will have its
uue effect at Washington,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 6, 1897.
THE EXTKA SESSION.
The action of President McKinley in
calling an extra sea-iion of Congress to
meet within ten days is tbe first proof
given to the country of the energy
with which the new administration will
direct itself to the task of removing the
evils which now depress our industries,
and of providing a means for a speedy re
turn to prosperity.
As the President said in his inaugural
address: "Business conditions are not
the most promising. It will take time to
restore the prosperity of former years. If
we cannot promptly attain it, we can
resolutely turn our faces in that direction,
and aid its return by friendly legislation."
This much is well understood by the peo
ple, and they therefore hail with gladness
the action of the President in summoning
Congress at onca to enact tbe friendly
legislation which is required to promote
the public welfare.
The peopie share with the President the
belief that Congress will not be found
! lacking "in disposition or ability to re
lieve the situation as far as legislation can
do so." It ia true that the "restoration of
confidence and the revival of business
which men of all parties so much desire
depend more largely upon the prompt
and energetic action of Congress than
upon any other single agency affecting
tbe situation." It is to Congress there
fore that the people now look with expec
tation and with confidence that it will be
found not unworthy of the task imposed
upon it.
There is every reason for believing that
a new tariff designed to increase the reve
nues of the Nation and at the same time
afford protection to American industry
will be passed without Any factional oppo
sition. The Atlanta Constitution, one of
the leading Democratic papers of the
Union, recently obtained opinions from
prominent Democrats of the country on
the subject of the tariff, and the prevail
j ing sentiment was in favor of permitting
! its prompt adoption.
Senator Jones of Arkansas,, who was at
the head of the Democratic National Com
mittee during the last campaign, ex
pressed the general sentiment of the lead
ers of his party in saying: "Since the
people of the country have given the Re
publicans a sufficient number of votes to
pass their bill the Democrats will give
them full opportunity to do so." Senator
Morgan of Alabama, who will be the
dominant Democrat in the Senate, de
clared that his party "will throw no cap
tious opposition in the way of the Repub
lican administration in enacting such
measures as they promise will bring pros
perity."
The outlook therefore is good. The Re
publicans of the Ways and Means Com
mittee will have a tariff bill prepared in
time to submit it as soon as Congress as
sembles. As tbe House is overwhelm
ingly Republican, and as its proceeding!
will be directed by Speaker Reed, it is rea
sonably certain that the new bill will be
promptly passed and sent to the Senate.
The assurances given by Jones, Morgan
and other Democratic leaders promise an
equally speedy adoption of the measure
there. We will probably have the new
tariff before the close of the present fiscal
year. There will be an end to deficits,
disaster and debts.
All hail to President McKinley, all hail
to the extra session, all hail to a protec
tive tariff, all hail to returning prosperity I
BEET SUGAR.
The great and growing interest which
California has in the beet-sugar industry
makes it well to note with close attention
what is going on in foreign countries in
regard to it. The United Btates Consul-
General, in his latest published report to
the Dapartment of State, says tbat tbe
long-vexed problem of sugar legislation
has not been so definitely settled as to
eliminate it from German politics, and
that the sugar manufacturers are prepar
ing an appeal petitioning for tbe pass
ing of a new act to safeguard their in
dustry.
Such movements in foreign countries
should be closely watched in tbe interest
of the American industry, and every ad
vantage and stimulus European Govern
ments give to tbe production of sugar by
their people ought to be promptly met by
an insistent agitation in this country for
such protection as will place our farmers
and manufacturers on at least an equal
vantage ground in competing to supply
our home market.
Germany is tb* most important country
to keep an eye on in this matter, because
it is beyond all comparison the largest
beet sugar producer, and her lead must be
followed. Her sweeping reaches for con
trol of the world's market must be met
with counter efforts by all countries who
do not want to surrender tbe industry en
tirely to that empire. Germany produces
something over a million and a half tons
of beet sugar out of a total European yield
of something less than four and a half
million tons. Our American production
is so comparatively insignificant that we
have only eight factories to tbe 1215 plains
that are running in Europe.
If we expect to preserve this little start
and make it grow till we have a proper
share of this great industry it is obvious
that the policies of those countries winch
are so far ahead of us must be studied
either for adoption or to fortify ourselves
against their invasions of our own mar
ket?.
The subject is of especial interest to
Cahforniana. No other State of the Union
has such possibilities of achievement in
this industry. California can produce
pugar enough to supply all that is needed
by the people of the United States. Much
has already been done for the State in
developing this industiy by such capi
talists as Claus bpreckels, but he and
others should have encouragement and
assistance by such legislation as would
wrest from the foreign producers the un
due advantage which their Governments
are seeking to give them.

BUSINESS METHODS IN THE NAVY.
The Union Iron Works and the Cramps have
presented claims for several hundred thou
sand dollars, which these firms allege to have
lost on the Olympia, Oregon and other ships
thiongh delays and changes on the part of the
Navy Department. To those familiar with the
business methods of some of the bureaus the
claims do not appear extravagant, for the
builders have been sadly hampered, notably
through non-delivery of armor and guns.
It has been the aim of four successive Secre
taries to improve the business methods of the
Navy Department. Chandler called attention
fifteen years ago to the need of reform, and
Whitney inaugurated a system devised by
Commodores Brown and Meude, a lieutenant
of marines and a lieutenant of tne Washington
navy. It is, perhaps, needless to say that the
system found little favor and failed to work.
Secretary Tracy also essayed to organize a sys
tem upon the loundation of which the present
Secretary has built up the existing business
methods of the supplies and accounts of the
navy. It is all very well so far as it goes, but
no pan has yet been devised by which bureau
chiefs and clerks can be made to attend to
business, and It is on this account that nearly
$1,000,000 extra expense is claimed by the
contructors.
Judging from the numberless forms of blanks,
quadruplicate requisitions and reports, the
convening of boards of high rank officers to
sit as a jury to determine the cost of repairs to
a chair with a broken leg, and the many other
intricate methods by which the public in
terest is guarded, the system is no doubt a
success, and it has only this one fault, that
ilio object is lost sight ci in order to carry out
all the preliminaries to their final end. The
commanding officer, although he may be an
admiral, has but little to say as to how things
might be expedited, for he is tied up with the
same red tape that extends from Washington
to the Atlantic seaboard and botck to the Pa
cific Coast.
A little incident which occurred about nine
years ago at Mare Island will illustrate what
the so-called business methods were then, and
how much room there was for an improve
ment. It was during Commodore Russell's
time that two boats were ordered built with
out delay for the Ranger. They were of the
Ingersoll patent, without frames, and having
instead a double skill of planking.
A half-dozen men were set to work on each
boat, and the work went along with a rush
until the outer thickness of planking v/as
ready to go in place. The foreman boat
builder then made requisition for one bolt of
canton flannel, but none was to be found in
the storehouse. The commodore promptly
telegraphed to the proper bureau in Washing
ton for permission to purchase one bolt of
canton flannel. The chief of the bureau wired
the next day, "What is the canton flannel
wanted for?" The commodore promptly re
plied, "For the Ranger's boats." Still the
chief was not satisfied in his mind that all was
right, and inquired by telegraph, "Will noth
ing but canton flannel answer the purpose?"
The commodore answered laconically, "No."
On the fourth day after the telegraphic corre
spondence had begnn a dispatch came from
Washington authorizing the purchase of the
canton flaunel, and on the following day the
stuff came up from San Francisco by express,
its purchase having been ordered by telegraph
from trie yard.
As a business transaction the account stood
thus: Telegrams, $7 20; cost of one bolt of
canton flannel, $5; total cost of the flannel,
$12 20. This, however, does not cover the
actual expense of the flannel, for during the
four days' telegraphic correspondence two
gangs of men were practically idle, and allow
ing that they worked one-half of the time
there still remains $108 (at the rate of $4 50 a
day to each man) to be charged to the canton
flannel, thus making its total cost $I^o 20.
The difference of $115 20 might have been
saved if the commandant ha<l been intrusted
with discretion in the matter, but then it was
the navy's way of doing business, a system
somewhat complicated and not suited to the
ways of civilians.
It is alleged now that with the new system
no Buch extraordinary delays and expenses
are incurred, and yet the contractors com
plain. __________

"THE CALL" SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Letters From Our Readers on Matters of Public
Interest.
McKinley's "Word.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: President McKinley's word is made eood by his inauguial
address. All doubt is cleared away as to his understanding of the platform on which he was
elected. It was made by politicians for him to get in on, and now he affirms his intention to
stand on it as President. Considering the conflicting interests which were compromised at St.
Louis when that platform was made and which were held in line during the campaign, but
which will dow soak to control the administration on differing linesâ the gold men and
bankers striving for one line of policy and the honest international bimetallists for another
line of policyâ it must be conceded by all candid meu that President Mi-Kinley has given
proof of a robust honesty of conviction and intention most decidedly refreshing and inspiring
to all fair-minded citizens.
I have tried to read the President's inaugural address with fairness and candor, forgetting
for the time that I did what I could do honorably to defeat him as a candidate for the Presi
dency; and so great is my desire for the prosperity of our country and the speedy relief of the
vast multitudes of suffering people all over our country now in abject poverty and dependence,
with the future growing hourly more hopeless and desperate, and with even a larger number of
industrious American citizens who are desperately struggling to save their business or incum
bered property from annihilation, thinlt I succeeded fairly well in reading this iuaugurnl
address in a somewtiat hopeful spirit and in real fairness to President McKinley and tho
political party he represents.
My confession is at once openly made that there is more of the straightforward man and
far less of the shifty politician, more of the stalwart American and less of the crafty "head of
a nation" in this inaugural address than I anticipated. While holding that the wording of
the platform which outlines the National policy he was elected to enforce is to be taken to
mean just what it says, to a plain man of ordinary intelligence, and asserting in terms de
void of equivocation his full purpose to carry out that policy to its logical sequence, ha places
himself bofore the Nation in the simple but sublime dignity of the National Executive, not as
tho arrogant dictator who preceded him, when he distinctly calls upon Congress to assume
its entire responsibility for "prompt, energetic and intelligent action" to "secure, as far as
legislation can do so, the restoration of confidence and the revival of business which men of
nil parties so much desire," because "upon such action more than upon any other agency"
tho return of prosperity depends; and in this we see a change of administration quite to the
satisfaction and delight of vie American people from that which four years ago autocratically
sneered at "having Consrress on its hands." McKiuley thus stands as ua American President,
not as a bloated corporation autocrat.
It must also be noted here to the credit of President McKinley that he takes cognizance of
the gravity of the situation which confronts him as he enters upon his du'ies as Chief Magis
trate. Indeed, he opens his address by reference to his "responsibilities which are augmented
by the prevailing business conditions, entailing idleness upon willing labor and loss to useful
enterprise." "The country is suffering," he says, "from iudusuial disturbances from which
relief must be had." As remedies he proposes greater economy in National expenditures and
an increase in revenue, "secured by a system of taxation, external or internal, or both."
These are old remedies and in line with the fixed policy of the Republican party. Indeed, I
find no intimation In this inaugural address of any departure from the prevailing policy of
the party for the past thirty years. Will it suffice for present conditions?
Without a radical change, such as President McKiuley nowhere intimates as desirable, I
cannot understand how the return of prosperity will follow in any satisfactory seuse tho
measures proposed in the inaugural address. Fifty "years ago a close student of the causes which
produce nationnl decline and disaster had the courage to speak hi 3 mind as to the result of
influences then at work in our country, although he was jeered by our countrymen without the
leasl snow of respect for his dismal anticipations. It was the crabbed and blunt critic Thomas
Carlyle, who is now more admired by both English and American readers than lie was fifty
years ago. He then said:
"The republic west of us will have its trial period, its darkest of all hours. It is traveling
the high road to that direful day. And this scourge will not come amid famine* horrid
stride and ordinary punitive judgments. It will come as a hiatus in statecraft, a murder
ous bungle in policy. It will be when health is intact, crops abundant and the munificent
hand open. Then so-called statesmen will cry overproduction, the people will goto the
bnliot-box amid hunger and destitution and ratify this infamous lie, thrown upon the
breeze by the eervile editors of a corrupt press."
I think the present generation of American voters will recognize the "direful day" of
Carlyle as a too familiar iact of the last election and of existing conditions. At the "time
Carlyle made his unwelcome prediction nothing seemed more preposterous to the American
people.
If the people of our country, by a considerable majority, possessed the clear intelligence,
the historical knowledge, the subtle discrimination, the sturdy integrity, the moral cour
age and the wise foresight of Thomas Carlyle they would see in the broad open light of mid
day the causes which have brought their country to its present deplorable condition, and
any man of ten millions could name the only remedies which can by any human possibility
cure these evils. Relief will not be found iv continuing the policy under which our country
has traveled to its present "dlreiul day." While I hope for the best, I do not see how our
country can enjoy but a temporary and fictitious prosperity, and I iear but little of that,
until we have an entire chiingp in our political economy. Joseph Asbury Johnson.

The Way of a Faker.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: We herewith take pleasure in expressing our
thanks to The Call for taking the pains to ascertain the facts before publishing the particu.
lars about the case of Emma W. Krenz in The Call of the "-d uIL Emma W. Krenz commit
ted suicide in a fit of despondency on the 20th ult., and the following day the Examiner not
knowing what to do for some sensational news and never stopping to find out the facts pub
lished an account of the case to fit its own ideas, coupled with a love story. This story was
ridiculous, ana was denied by us ana the lady where she had been at service. However the
"Monarch of Fakers" immediately published another equally ridiculous story to the effect that
she had committed suicide because she did not get a new coat. We took no notice ol these sto
ries because we thougtit it the work oi one of its second-hand reportersand thought the Exam
iner wouid discover its mistake at the Coroner's inquest. Such was not the case, however, for
after the Coroner's jury had heard the evidence anÂ«t rendered a verdict of ''suicide in a fit of
de o pondency," the "Monarch of Fakers" would still have its own way, and the following day
published the verdict in this style, "Suicide on account of not receiving a new coat." We hope
you will be kind enouch to publish ihis and let the public know the truth. Thanking you
for past favors, we are as ever, F. \V. Kbenz (brother).
;Mrs. Ed Ullman (sister).
O. Kbenz (father).
P. B.â Have been a subscriber to the Examiner for tne last eight ye*rs, but I now find I can

already done. Respectfully, Mrs. Ed Ullman, Islais street, near Mission road.
A Plea for Single Men.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: Your correspondent Mr. Orr points the un
employed of the City to the placer gold gravel bars of the State as a place where a dollar a day
can be made by hand labor, but this scheme would not suit the numerous married men who
seek employment near their homes and families.
And this suggests to me the question, "Why are so many married menidle"T Seeingthat the
benevolent philanthropists of the City always give the preference of work to these, leaving
the single men to fight the world as best they can, and why is it that men and women are so
foolish as to persist in marrying and raising families when the world apDarently has no use
for them; they breed only more slaves to minister to the luxury of the capitalists and the more
they breed the more numerous the capitalists become and the more numerous their slaves.
If wisdom instead of selfishness ruled the world, instead of subscribing funds to make employ
ment for these selfish, nmrried men, these would be left alone to stew in their own juice, and
employment provided only for me provident single men like myself, a rusty, cruslv old bache

â Cincinnati Enquirer,
A OOOPEE MEMOEIAL.
An Effort to Perpetuate the Memory
of the Great Kiudergartner.
The following appeal has been issued:
It is the desire of the co-workers of Mrs.
Sarah B. Cooper and of the resident? of San
Francisco to perpetuate her memory in a
memorial which shall be a living testimony to
the value of the work, she has done in this
City.
As the exponent o( Mrs Cooper's teachings
and realizing the far-reaching iutluence of her
labors, the Golden Gate Kindergarten Associa
tion believes that this memorial should be a
continuance ol her Hiework. It, therefore,
most earnestly appeals to you, as a resident of
sun Francisco, to aid in carrying on the wort
among the little children in the kindergartens
established and superintended by her. These
children are too young to obtain rudimentary
instruction in any public educational Institu
tion in the City. Through these kindergartens
they have been lifted irom ignorance and ltd
consequences of meutal and moral deteriora
tion, and thus far but one of the 22,000 chil
dren enrolled in the Golden Gate Kinder
gartens is known to have been arrested for
misdemeanor or crime. The united evidence
of the officials of thii City is to the effect tnat
in the districts where kindergartens have
been established disorderly and vicious ele
ments have invariably diminished.
Generous men and women, prompted by
Mrs. Cooper and under her direction, have
founded kindergartens amonc the needy and
destitute in various parts of the City ; but
there remain fourteen kindergartens, formerly
supported by subscriptions irom the general
public, unprovided for.
The financial strain in the business world
has been severely felt by the association. The
amount oi its subscriptions has decreased and,
without a more generous income, the associa
tion cannot support these kindergartens.
What, then, shall be their fate? To give up
any of them closes the door of hope to many
children; and substitutes degrading for eluvat
ing surroundings, and lessens the influence of
the noble woman whom the City delights to
honor. It remains with you, who recognixe
the benetits received ia the past, to decide if
these kindergnrtens shall live.
Witn this statement and in the name of the
noble woman whose life was devoted to the
uplifting of humanity the Golden Gate Kin
dergarten Association appeals to you lor finan
cial aid, believing that the prevention ol im
morality and vice is a more effective method
of reform than the industrial schools and
prisons you are taxed to support.
In conclusion you are asked to fill out the
inclosed card with the amount of your sub
scription or donation, and to mail the same to
the treasurer of the Golden Gate Kindergarten
Association, Mrs. F. a. Frank, 1601 Van NesÃ
avenue, City. Yours truly,
Emily Talbot Walker, President
Minna \. Gaden, Secretary.

THE FRATERNITIES.
Dramatic and effective Cer.mnny of
lu.tallationofthe Ladies of th*
Maccabees.
1 Of the many fraternities m San Francisco
that install officers in public, there are but
few that do so with more impressive and
dramatic effect than do the Ladles ; of the
Maccabees. On Thursday last the officers o
Modin Hive No. 19 were installed in public In
the social hall of the A. O. K. building, and the
beautiful ceremony was witnessed by a largo
number of the members and friends. The
officer, do not wear regalia, but are designated
by the insignia of office affixed to a neat bow
oi black and red ribbon. WUen the time for In
stallation was called the various officers occu
r> t-d their respective stations, and soon tfaere
ater there came from an anter.>..m Uu young
Udici who are known as the staff-bearers, each
carrying" long staff or wand, having tied a:
U*e top a bow of red. white and black ribbon,
the colors of tne order, and euch wearing a
broad red ana biack sash across tne shoulder.
These staff-Dearers marched In column of two
up to the altar, saluted the lady commander
by placing the left hand over the heart, then
opened and stood facing each other in par
allel lines. At a signal iroiu the organist the
staff-bearers crossed staffs forming a lone
bower of youth and beauty on each fide and
silk overhead. The lady sentinel, passing un
der the bower, advanced to the altar gave the
salute and announced that Lady Henrietta
Cook, supreme deputy commander, was in
waiting to install the recently elected officers.
sue was admitted, and after passing through
the bower was conducted to the lady com
mander's station. Â»*fcÂ«. - i_JiÂ«
The several officers, upon request of the lady
deputy, vacated their siations and each de
posited her insignia of office upon the altar,
after which the newly elected officers, as their
names were called, took seats in a circle re
served for them at the eastern end of the nan
facing the installing officer. Then followed
the calling ot the new lady commander, who
passed through tho bower escorted by the
mistrejs-at-arms and, nfter the salute, the
staff-Dearers circled around the altar and with
their stwffs formed a sheltering canopy over
the heads of the two who were waiting the ,
pleasure of the installing officer. She explained
the nature of the obligations tne lady com
mander-elect would have to assume and re
ceiving her assurance that she was willing
and ready to assume thtm the deputy ad
vanced to the altar and administered the oath
to her, the lady commander during the timo
holding her left hand on the Bible, afterwhich
she was decorated with the insignia of the
office, and the chaplain offered up a prayer.
The new officer was conducted, to the
sound of a march, to her station by the mis
tress-at-arms and escorted by the staff-bearers,
who then formed in two lines and circled
oack to their stations at the rear of the altar.
Then the other officers, one by one, were
brought forward and each was charged, witli
more or less obligation, according to rank. '
The entire proceedings were very solemn,whkh
was added to by the impressive manner of tho
installing officer, who performed her part of
the work In a most creditable manner, deliv
ering all her charges without the aid of a book.
The installation ceremony being declared at
an end, there was then given a very pretty
exhibition ef floor work called "the march of
the Ladies of the Haccabees '' that closing by
the staff-bearers, the ten officers and two la
dles from other hives forming one after an
other four living letters, L. O. T. M.. the in
itials of the name oi the order. The effect
was charming, and the participants were
loudly applauded.
Tne new officers are: Lady commander, Mrs.
M. Devega; past ludy communlor, Mrs. Â£. R.
vVaddelt; lady lieutenunt-comiutillder, Dr. K.
t-prague; lady record-keeper, Miss Helen
Black; lady finance-keeper, Mrs. L. Manning j
lady rhaplain, Mrs. M. Boell; lady sergeant,
Miss J. Fitzgerald; lady niistreÂ«s-Â«t-arms, Mrs.
K. Creig; lady sentinel, Mrs. K. Wheeler, and
lady picket, Mrs. C. Shatman.
A short impromptu programme followed, in
which Miss Bertha Moody, the Miss'-s Carrto
and Ethel Manning and Mrs. & J. Tully took
part. The deputy, Mrs. Cook, made a few re
marks, and then "there was dancing and re
freshments.
LÂ»uring the evening the hive wÂ»s visited by
the members oi Modin Tent in a body and
General Supervising Deputy for the Pacific
Coast, C. A. Luckenbach.

and dance by John Guerrero aad John BeiTers
Jr. Tho latter in response to an encore gave a

THE PASSING
OF ASA FISK
Death of a Well-Known
Character of This
City.
A Cold Caught Some Time Ago
Undermined His Con
stitution.
He Deeded Most of His Property to
His Wife Just Bifcre He
Died.
Asa Fisk, the well-known money lender,
passed away after a long and painful ill
ness yesterday afternoon at his residence,
700 Hayes street.
The illness which caused his death was
contracted last October by trs catching a
severe cold which turned into a bad at
tack of pneumonia and at that time
threatened to be serious. Medical aid and
a robust constitution, however, thwarted
the attack, but it left him an invalid and
caused his retirement from active business.
A change for the better took place about
the Ist of January, when his family noped
that he would be restored to his m.ual
activity, but in this they were disap
pointed, for he never recovered his usual
vitality. He became more feeble day by
day until death came yesterday.
Previous to his death Mr. Fisk deeaed
all his real estate, except that which is
located in Alameda County and this City,
to his wife, leaving his holdings in the
two places mentioned to be disposed of
according to the conditions of his will.
His funeral will take place to-morrow
from his residence at 1:30 p. m. Religious
services will be conducted Dy the Rev. Dr.
Berger of the Presbyterian denomination,
of whose congregation the deceased was a
member prior to Dr. Berger's removal to
an Eastern church. Dr. Berger's presence
here at this time is owing to a visit to his
old associates in California.
The deceased belonged to the Masonic
fraternity, but since his arrival in this
City he ceased to be an active sojourner.
Mr. Fisk was well known in business cir
cles, but in his privaie affairs he always
maintained a reserve that but few of his
intimate associates broke through. He
was born at Holliston, Mass., on Christ
mas, 1818. He came of an old New Eng
land family. His early life was spent on
a farm. At the age of 14 yountr Fisk left
the farm and made his way to Boston and
went to work at a small salary in a ero
cery store. Later he secured employment
in the firm of David Kimball & Co., who
dealt in tailors' goods and supplies.
For the first few years his salary was
only $100 a year, but this was gradually
increased until he held several positions
of trust and confidence. Upon the death
of one of the members of the firm he se
cured a half interest in the concern, which
took the name of Kimball & Fisk.
In 1856 the death of Mr. Kimball left
Mr. Fisk tne sole proprietor of the bust
ness, but a while after he took in a part
ner. While still engaged in that line Mr.
Fisk branched out and built the East Bos
ton and Suffolk Railroad. During these
years he was a resident of the Middlesex
district, a suburb oi Boston, and one term
he represented the district in the Massa
chusetts Senate oi 1859 and 18<J0.
In 1803 Mr. Fisk came to California.
He traveled extensively over the State,
combining business with pleasure. After
an absence of a year or two he returned to
Boston and eventually closed out his
business in that city. In 180!) Mr. Fisk
returned to this State, bringing with him
about $75,000.
It was about 1871 or 1872 that Mr. Fisk
started into the business of a money brok
er, a business that he followed ever
since. His fortune at the time of bis death
amounted to several hundred thousand
dollars, but the exact amount is unknown
even to his family. He still owned large
holdings of real estate in the East as well
as in this State.
Early in life he married and three chil
dren W6re the result of that union. His
first wife died and be married again in thia
Btate and two more children were added
to bis family.
One who was well acquainted with the
old man stated that while Asa Fisk has the
reputation of driving a hard bargain in
money matters, there are many good
traits in bis character.
Among these was mentioned his habit
of doing effectual, though unostentatious
charity. He was the subject of much
criticism, which his friends declare was
unjust. Mr. Fisk himself took this philo
sophically and was once heard to remark
that the only people who abused him were
those who did not pay their notes. He
was never known to reply to public criti
cism.

A large and Dusky Flood, Which With
Incidental Snowy Stationery, Will
Be Investigated.
Auditor Broderick and Supervisor Has
kins puzzh d yesterday over a bill for sta
tionery, which came from Cunningham,
Curtiss & Welch, and which purported to
be for the use of Judge Wallace, but
which was ordered by Iris clerk, Benjamin
Solomon. No requisition had been made
upon Supervisor Haskins for stationery,
but there was the bill for $121 15, enu
merating the following items:
Lithographed letterheads, 2400. $18; 2400
lithographed noteheads, $13; a gross of pen
cils, $12; a half gross of colored paper pencils,

stain us, $10; 500 1-cent postage stamps, $5,
and a large amount of rulers, rubber bauds,

Auditor .Broderick believes that al
though Judge Wallace approved the bill,
he did not carefully note* the items nor
observe that the total was sufficient to
stock a small store. Supervisor Haskins
will investigate. The stationery iund is
overdrawn $2t)00.
HIS WIPE WAS MISTAKEN.
Why Coroner Hawk in* Inquired Into the
Circumstances of V. A. Brown's Death.
The funeral of P. A. Brown, who died
on Thursday and was buried yesterday,
was delayed a few moments when about
to take place, by Deputy Coroner O'Brien,
ASA FISK.
who was sent to make inquiries as to the
circumstances of the death.
Tiie Coroner was notified early in the
day by the wife of the deceased that she
BU&pected foul play and 'hat the case was
one ior investigation. The deputy found
that Brown's wife had not lived with him
for two j'ears and that the physician wha
signed the certificate, a reputable practi
tioner, wr.s certain as to the cause of
death, which he stated to be spinal men

CARING FOR PENSIONERS.
Uncle Sam Win Have to Appoint a Spe
cial Agent for Their Accom
modation.
It will not be long before Uncle Sam will
be compelled to employ a special commis
sioner to care for the interests of the peu
sioners in San Francisco.
The list of incapacitated pensioners in
creases constantly, and there are now over
a hundred veterans and widows of veter
ans in this City who are physically unable
to appear in the office of the County Clerk
for the purpose of swearing to their
claims.
No provision i=i made by the Government
for taking the oaths of pensioners except
in tbe oilice of the County Clerk or in the
office of some other legally authorized pub
lic functionary, and consequently many
are made to Deputy County
Clerk J. B. Mulcahy for his attendance at
the residences of the pensioners in order
that they may be sworn. "Without that
formality they would not be in a position
to draw even the small stipend to which
they are entitled. In order to accommo
date the veterans Mr. Mulcahy has been
in the habit of going to their homes be
fore and after business hours. He says
that if the list of incapacitated pension
ers continues to grow in the future as it
baa in the immediate past he will hava
more of that Rind of worK than he can
attend to. Then the Government will be
called on to supply a special agent to at
tend to the wants of its superannuated
pensioners.
CARGO MAY BE LIBELED.
An Interesting Decision in Favor of
Sailor* by Judge Morrow.
Judge Morrow of the United States Dis
trict Court rendered a decision yesterday
in the case of J. T. Tibbal and others
against the American barkentine Marion
and her cargo, consisting of 850 barrels of
salmon, that is of interest to sailors.
The vessel shipped a crew for a fishing
cruise in northern waters, and on her re
turn was libeled by the sailors for their
â wages. The barkentine was sold by the
United States Marshal, but the proceeds of
the sale were not sufficient to pay the
claim-. Then the sailors libeled ncr cargo
on the ground that it belonged to the
owner of the vessel ana was liable for the
debts incurred on the trip.
Judge Morrow decided that the point
was well taken and that where vessel and
cargo are owned by the same parties the
cargo may be libeled to pay claims for sail
ors' wages.

THE "EXAMINER"
TELLS MORE LIES
False Reports of the Build
ing Trades Council
Meeting.
Its Statements Rcundly De
nounced as Being
Untrue.
No R solutions Were Passei Con
demning "The Cal" by the
Aifi ia'ei Unions.
The Examiner made another effort yes
terday to break its own record as a faker
and falsifier, and to a considerable extent it
was successful. It failed, however, to this
extent, that a lie to be of any effect must
be well told.
In its report of the meeting of the
Building Trades Council, held at 915J^
Market street on Thursday evening, the
Examiner said:
Last night the Building Trade* Council
fully and by official act indorsed the resolu
tions of condemnation of the paper (The Call)
adopted by the Carpenters' Union of this
City.
This statement, was a falsehood made
out of whole cloth. No resolutions were
passed or adopted at that meeting con
demning The Call or indorsing tne action
of any union relative to that matter, and
the Examiner's two representatives, sent
to the meeting for the purpose of having
juch action taken, so that the Mission
jtreet sheet could make capital out of it,
were so informed.
The following emphatic denial of the
Examiner's story was made last night by
representatives of the Building Trades
Council:
BAN FKANCISCO, Marob 5, 1897.
To the Kditor: I desire to state that
the printers who visited the Interna
tional Amalgamated Sheet Metal Work
erg, Local >o. 21, on Wednesday even
ing, March 3, 1897, at Academy Hall,
827 Market street, showed no intent
nor purpose to convey the impression
that they in any way represented Typo
graphical I'nion No. 21, of the Inter
national Typographical Union, but
merely that they were individual mem
bers of The Call chapel, with no I
delegated power, and that they visited
us for the purpose of correcting a mis
state inent.
1 also desire to state that the same
gentlemen appeared before the Build
ing Trades Council on Thursday night,
and they were extended the courtesy of
the floor in a like manner to that of the
meeting of the Metal Workers, and they
conducted themselves in a like manner.
I also desire to state that no resolu
tions were passed by the Itnilding
Trades Council on Thursday evening,
Maroli 4, 1897, condemning or cemur
ing any newspaper or publication.
1 H. C. ttINCKEN,
Fresident Building Trades Council.
W. M. PAGK,
Secretary Building Trades Council.
Mr. t'age also made the following state
ment:
"I was present as one of the dele
gates of the Building Trades Council
at the meeting held at 915}^ Market
street on Thursday night, March 4,
1897, and as an individual and not as a
representative of that body I will state
a resolution wai presented by J. IV.
KoiÂ«e in substance the same as the
one passed by Carpenters' Union No.
88, which he asked to have the Build
ing Trades Councit adopt. The council
decided not to take action, and referred
the matter to the several unions affili
ated.
" The statement made in this morn
ing's Examiner that the council in
dorsed those resolutions and con
demned The Call is false and without
foundation in fact. The council parsed
this matter without any action what
ever. Therefore the council cannot
take any action whatever until the sev
eral unions tako action on the matter,
to which all such must be referred.
" I make this statement voluntarily,
in ordnr to correct any injustice that
has been done to The Call, that has
always been friendly to labor acd
work ing men. "

THE POLICE ON TOAST.

by the Carpenters' Union.
Police on toast, well browned, with
cayenne pepper sauce. That was the till

clause of the official report ended in the
adoption by unanimous vote of the follow

WnEREAS, The regularly appointed police
of this City and County have tor years past
been doing the carpentering work, the plumb

HIOKEY'S WIDOWS.
Both Were Divorced, but They Are
After His Estate.
In the estate of Emmet M. Hickey, de
ceased, Judge Coffey has handed down a
written opinion setting fortn the reasons
for vacating a former order settling the
account of the administrator.
Hickey had been married twice and
both times divorced. Mary Cummings,
formerly Mary Hicfcey, the woman who
was his first wile, presented a claim for
|660 for alimony, but this was compro
mised for $400, and its payment was al
lowed, and it was included in the adminis
trator's account as settled by the court.
Mary Hickey, the second divorced wife,
applied for a family allowance as widow
of the decedent, on the eround that the
decree had not been signed.
Subsequently an attorney was appointed
to represent the absent minor heirs, and
they by their attorney objected to the pay
ment of the $400 to Mrs. Mary Hickey-
Cummings on the ground that they were
not notified of her application, as was
their right.
Judge Coffey heard argument on this
point and h'naily decided that the position
taken by the minor heirs was correct, and
set aside the settlement of the adminis
trator's account. Tnis opens up the mat
ters of the entire estate and gives botli
divorced women and their children an
other opportunity to enter the struggle
for the estate.

Rules for Acquiring Funds Which
Those in Charge Will
Adhere To
A meeting of the "Robbie" Burns monu

at Scottish Hall, on Larkin street.
Chairman Boyd sta:ed from the num
ber of letters received by him from several
enthusiastic Scotchmen throughout the
State, volunteering assistance and askinsr
for instructions as to how to proceed to aid

and with the nope ol realizing a large sum of
money.
Filth â While the committee gratefully ac
knowledges the many courteous offers made,
it will accept no benefits tendered until after
the celebrations, directly on thuir own ac
count, shall nave been held.
This proved satisfactory to all present.

of tilling up the committee was deferred
until the next meeting.

SCIENCE MARVELS
THAT HE LIVES
Strange Case of Edward
Bernard, an Injured
Laborer.
Falling Rock Crushes His Skull
While Working in a
Quarry
A Large Piece of Bone Removedâ The
Patient Closely Watched by
Physic ars
Yesterday morning Edward Ber
nard was simply a common day
laborer, earning by the sweat of his brow
the pittance tiiat men of his class receive.
To-day he has reached distinction and if
watched far more carefully than many
whose destinies placed them in higher
places.
It is true that Bernard's road to fame
may also lead to death, for he is lying des
perately near the verge at the City and
County Hospital, yet ha is now a scien
tific marvel and attracts more attention
than any of the poor unfortunates who
are dependent on the City's medical refuge
for their chances of life.
Bernard worked for Warren & Malley.
the contractors, and was engaged with
many of his fellows in dragging; from its
bed of centuries the rock that is intended
to improve and beautify the streets of the
City.
Somehowâ no one seems to assign any
reason except the rain â a huge bowlder
high up on the side of the quarry became
detached and rolled down upon the toil
ing workmen below.
The shout of warning that echoed
through the excavation on the hillside
either did not reach Bernard or he did not
gather its import, for the great stone
struck him on the left side and he fell, as
does the ox when struck by the butcher's
maul.
At the hospital, to which he was con
veyed as quickly as possible, the doctors
found that almost the entire left side of
bis head was crushed in, and they mar
veled that he lived.
Sharp instruments in the deft hands of
Drs. F. W. Dudley and C. H. Lowell
quickly laid bare the skull, and a jnece of
the bone 1% inches wide by 4% inches
long was removed. Considerable ol the
brain matter came with the splintered
bone, and yet Bernard lived to set at
naught the researches of science.
The shadow of death hovers over Ber
nard and may settle at any moment, yet
the fact that he has survived at all is con
sidered remarkable, and the patient will
be watched closuly in the benefit of sci
ence until death claims him or he re
covers.
Bernard is a single man, 35 years of age
and lives at 9 Hinckley alley. The report
of Dr. Dudley states that his injury is a
compound comminuted fracture of the
skull.

nights. After taking several bottles of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, some Liver Pills, and using your
Sanative Wash, I recovered.
I can eat well, and every one that
sees me tells me I am a -different per-
son. I can do all my own work, sleep
well and feel well. I am growing
stronger every day, and am able to go
out and enjoy a walk and not feel all
tired out when I return, as I used to. . I
doctored for sixteen years, and in all
those years I did not feel as well as I do
at the present time. I wish that every
woman that is troubled as I was, would
try that medicine. Oh ! it is so good
to feel well, and it is all owing to Mrs.
Pinkham's kind advice and medicine.

Getting Ready for a Trip to Carsonâ The Gun,

The rain has interfered with all lines of
outdoor sport. The tug-of-war 'at the Pa
vilion has been well attended. The wheel

nament, which promises to be a great
affair. The sports are getting ready to

THE WHEELMEN.
League Secession Movement Grow
ing Steadilyâ Coming: Indoor
Tournament.
The return of Chief Consul Kerrigan of
the North California Division, League of
American Wheelmen, and his experiences
at the National assembly and opinion re
garfline the course to be pursued since the
Sunday racing amendment was defeated,
as told in The Call yesterday, has aroused
interest in league affairs and created con
siderable talk around the clubs yesterday.
The meeting of the board of officers, to be
held this evening at the rooms of the Bay
City Wheelmen, will be well attended and
its action is awaited with interest. "To
secede, or not to secede, " that is the ques
tion with the league wheelmen, ana the
Bentiment prevails that if the league will
not sanction Sunday racing in some way,
secession will be the best thing, for the
good of the sport in this State.
Bearings prints another clever editorial
on the subject this week in which it says:
Seven is not a large number. Still, when the
seven happen to be the seven members of the
L. A. W. racing board, men who have had
every opportunity to form accurate judgment
on what is for the best interests of racing in
America, and when the seven report unani
mously on a subject, it would seem as il the
delegates to the National assembly would not
have gone far astray if tuey had accepted the
ISAAC B. POTTER, President of the League of American
Wheelmen,
judgment of the seven as the best solution of
ihe problem under discussion. The action of
the assembly In defeating the Sunday racimg
mea-ure seems the more strange when it Is
taken into consideration that those who advo
cated Sunday racing were not attempting to
force it on the whole country, but merely asked
that each State be allowed to settle the ques
tion for itself.
Had the question come up with less substan
tial backing itt) fate might be considered the
tame as the fate of scores of other quos that
have been defeated by the honorables.the dele
gates to the National assembly. Its backing
â was and Is too good, however, to permit the
question to be lost sight of. It had the unani
mous indorsement of the racing board, was
advocated by a large number of delegates who
caw the racing interests of their various local
ities at stake, and was backed by a large ma
jority of track-owners and responsible race
meet promoters, not to mention the entnusi
astlc support of the racing men themselves.
Those who opposed the measure and still op
pose itâ for the measure, although killed by
the National assembly, is still a very lively
corpseâ are trying to belittle the movement.
They assert that the threatened secession of
the Western and Southern Slates is all bluff
and bluster and will amount to nothing. They
assume that the league, like the king, can do
no wrong. They are either willfully misrepre
senting or are woefully mistaken. Tne news
columns of this issue of Bearings will testify
to the widespread disaffection. This Is a ques
tion that will not down. Sunday racing is
bound to win.
The Imperial Cycling Club's ten-mile
road race will start at li o'clock to-mor
row morning at High street, Fruitvale,
weather permitting. The entries and
handicaps were given in Ihe Call yester
day.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen alto have
a ten-mile try-out on the cards for to
morrow. From the showing made in this
ride some of the members of the club's re
lay team will be picKed.
The League Bullatin says in the last
issue:
James D. Pbelan, the very popular Mayor of
Ban Francisco, has further his
correct estimates of men and measures by be
coming a member of the L. A. W. In this im
portant acquisition to the league membership
the Narth California Division may well feel a
sense of pride, in which ihe entire organization
may happily share.
A three weeks' indoor cycle tournament
is to be conducted in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion, commencing Saturday evening,
March 20, under the management of D G.
Snaler.
For some time past there has been doubt
as to whether any indoor meet would Oh
given this year. Tne San Francisco
Amusement Company inteaded to give
one, and secured W. B. Fawcett of the
Velodrome as manager. Fawceit's un
popularity with the racing men, however,
stood in the way, as most ot the promi
nent professionals declined to ride at any
meet with which he was connected. The
company has now secured the ,Â«ervices of
Shafer, the noled trainer and manager,
and the meet is assured. The racing men
all like Shafer. He ban a string of men
under his charge now, consisting of
LoUL'head, Ziegler, McFarland, Borse.
Stevens and Morris, all Eastern cracks,
and Wells, the XerriiJs, and other fast lo
c:il men. To this contingent will be added
Jimmy Michael, the Welsh champion, the
most remarkable performer in competition
ami at record-Drt-aking ever known.
M'Chaei will ieave Ch'cago for this City
next Monday.
For the three weeks $9000 in prizes will
I c hunj; un . which is not too much when
the iiiu'h class of the men who will com
pete is considered. There will be events
at a.l distances from a hall-mile up to
twenty- four hours.
Bt-si les the aggregation now here, which
is by far the greate-t array of racing tal
ent ever quartered on the coast, Bald,
Cooper, Gardiner, Eaton and Staruuck
are expected. Bald and Cooper led tbu
list of champion professionals of last year,
Gardiner was close to them, Eaton is
called the "indoor king" by reason of his
remarkable rides on small indoor tracks,
and Starbuck is the champion long-dis
tance rider of the world. The latter will
be the favorite in the twenty-four-hour
race.
An eight-lap track will be constructed in
the Pavilion, similar in shape to the one
of last year, only much safer and faster.
Snafer says a miie in 1:50 will be possible
on it, and he says that Michael can reel
off miles at that clip sitting up. His
record of five miles in 9:12 is ample proof
of this.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
five-mile handicap road race on Sunday,
March 14, and a ten-miie try-out the fol
lowing Sunday, to select the club's team
for the coming relay race.
The State circuit meet at Dixon
scheduled for Wednesday had to be post
poned owing f> the rain, and the meet on
the cards for Woodland to-day will also
have to be put off, as the track is in poor
condition. The San Jose meet on March
10 is not affected, as the track there is of
cement.
The meets will be under the direct con
trol of the prominent local wheelmen.
Among those invited to officiate who have
alrea'ly accepted are Wilbur F. Knapp as
announcer, Robert C. Lenniu as starter,
and George P. Wetroore as timer and F.
H. Kerrigan as judge. Their indorse
ment of the meet is sufficient guarantee
for the riders themselves. Some have sug
gested that a three weeks' meet would be
too long, but Shafer says that he will have
so many novelties to present that the time
will be short enough, and he promises to
piv." the people racing which for spirit,
dash and excitement they have never seen
the like of here. Shafer is an old hand at
the business, and as he has the confidence
of the racing men he can probably do
what he says.
C. M. Smith of the Garden City Cyclers,
San Jose, has completed final arrange
ments with the Southern Pacific Com
pany whereby he is to ride a mile paced
by a locomotive, a performance similar to i
that of E. E. Anderson, near St. Louis,
who covered the distance in 1:03 in the
attempt. The date has been set for May
2, and the ride will take place at Lawrence
station, between Maylield and San Jose.
The snace between the track will be
boarded for three miles, thus allowing a
mile in which to get a eood flying start
and another mile to slow up in. Smith
says he expects the momentum will be so
great that after the mile is covered he will
be carried the next quarter in 18 seconds;
that 54 seconds for a mile is possible be
hind a tram, and he expects to do it in 58
seconds at the first trial.
Eddie Bald banked $12,500 last year,
and now Tom Cooper wants $5000 of* that
amount and Tom Butler would like about
the same in a match race, according to
Bearings. Bald may find a chance to
double his money here or lose all, and
Bald is not the man to back down with
such chances. From what has been said
this ii just the chance that Eddie Is look
ing for, and both Toms will receive recog
nition at an early date. A. D. Kennedy
of Chicago will probably be Bald's team
mate this year, both under Asa Windle,
manager. They are expected in California
very shortly.
Meade Mitchell Shields, a well-known
wheelman of Los Angeles, formerly of
this City, is in town on a visit.
Louisville track-owners contemplate
giving a complimentary brassard for the
season. This brassard will entitle the
holder to $5 daily while in his possession,
and will be competed for weekly at mati
nee races. Beside this the Velodrome
shield, carrying with it |10 a week, looks
very, very small.
The Yosemite Cyclers and the Inde
pendent Cavalry held a joint entertain

RING AND GLOVE.
Judging by Performances Corbett
Should Beat Fitzslmmons.
The heavy-weight championship battle
between Jamei J. Corbett and Robert
Yarum Fitzsimmons is now close at hand,
and the -porting world is looking lorward
to the forenoon of March 17, for upon
that memorable day a championship will
be won and lost. .
Wtio is going to win? that is a question
that is being asked by thousands of peo
ple daily and answered In many ways.
The same question was asked by as many
people when Corbatt fought Sullivan, but
the answer coming from nine out of ten
ot the supposed authorities on fisticuffs
wan â Sullivan, of course.
Corbett at that time was a comparative
ly unknown quantity, and the wise
acres who were reminded of tha Jackson
and Corbett tis-ht and the grand perform
ance of the youngster in front of an old
ring general, who had seen ana conquered
many, did not affect or chunge in the
least the opinions ot those who had Sulli
van on the brain.
Weil, what was the result? The youne
and clever fellow who had already formed
an idea of what the then great pugilist of
the age was capable of accomplishing,
havinir had a short set-to with Sullivan in
the Grand Opera-house when the king of
the punchers was on a visit to this City,
quietly informed his friends that Sullivan
was "easy gnme." Corbett remarked to a
prominent member of the Olympic Club
after the maicli was consummateu/'Why,
Sullivan can't hit me. I can just jab him
to death."
He was true to his word. The bisr fel
low defeated himself by swinging his
ponderous fists and musing thai will-o'

Of course, if Sullivan had landed on
Corbett as he had landed on other men.
Pompadour James would not have been
enjoying the sunshine of his wife's smiles
in chilly Carson.
The Call was the only paper west of
the Rocky Mountains that predicted suc
cess for Corbett, and in a column article
descriptive of tbe men its reasons for so
doing were given.
Now, a man, Fitzsinynons by name,
who is a better general than Suilivan, and
one who can strike probably as heavy a
blow as the Boston boy, is anxiously look
ing forward to the 17th inÂ»t., for on that
day he is booked to meet in a passage-at
arms a native son who has lived like a
prince and who has been hale fellow well
met ever since the time he conquered the
pet of the pugilistic world.
Will Fitz win ? Ah, there's where the
shoe pinches. If the Cornishman can
land either of the sledge-hammer fists he
carries as self-defenders on Corbett's jaw
it is safe to say that he will be crowned
the facile prfneeps of the prize-ring by
the thousands of sport-lovers who will
witness the battle.
But will Corbett give Robert the oppor
tunity of bringing the contest to a speedy
conclusion by exposing his jaw or any
other vulnerable spot as a target to be
shot at is another very importantquestion
that must not be lost sight of.
Corbett is unquestionably a great ring
general and a very close observer. He
will go tit Fitzsimmons as carefu.ly as a
cat when about to spring on a mouse.
His maneuvers in front of ihe Cornisb
rnan will be flashlike and puzzling. Fitz
will doubtless be on nis guard, and will
wait for tne attack which in aii proba
bility will come from tne Corbett battery,
then the game will be on, and if Co-bett
should conclude to enter into a give-and
tnke proposition the battle will assuredly
have an early termination, as tbe Cornish
man will doubtless drop bis game, as it is
in close-range fighting he inflicts heavy
damage.
But Corbett will not cut out any such
line of battle witn Fitzsimmons. He will
jab and get away and clinch when tie is
cornered. Possibly Fitzsimmons will take
the aggressive part. Should he do so,
then the spectators will see some very
pretty foot and head work on the part of
Corbett.
The Californian will resort to all man
ner of tricks to arouse the ire of his oppo
nent, who when "rattied" is a very wild
hitter and loses all control of his tbinking
box. Certainly, if Corbett should succeed
in "rattling" Fitzsimmons the latter will
go down and out, and James can then
congratulate himself on the fact that there
are no further fields to conquer, as it is
acknowledged the world over that Fiiz
simmons is the only living man who
has any license to enter a ring against
Jim Corbett.
It is presumed that both men are in
goou condition, or will be on the day of
the battle. Making that allowance for ar
gument sake the only true line that can
be drawn in figuring upon the result is
from the records of the men. The ques
tion now arises: Can Fitzsiramons whlD
the men whom Corbett defeatedâ that is,
if they were physically as able to do battle
now as when they faced the victor? The
The same question can be reversed and
applied to Corbett, and it will bo found
that, although the Cornishman has to his
credit the greater number oi scalps, Cor
bett has achieved the greatest victories.
Here are the records of important battles
the aspirants for the championship have
to their credit:
Corbett defeated Joe Choynski on June
5, 1889, at Benicia, in twenty-seven rounds.
Tno men used driving cloves ana Ccrbett
cut his opponent to pieces. The contest
took place on a barge. This was Corbett's
first encasement of any note. He next
whipped Dare Campbell in ten rounds.
He besied Jake Kilrain at New Orleans in
six rounds. In 1891 he fought a draw with
Peter Jackson, the contest ending in the
sixty-first round. Then he had a friendly
sparring four-rouna bout with Suliivan at
the Grand Opera-house, from which he
got a line on the big fellow. After engag
ing in sparring bouts with Jim Hall and
others he met and defeated Sullivan in
twenty-one rounds on September 7, 1892,
at New Orleans. He next whipped Charley
Mitchell in Jacksonville, Fla., in three
rounds. He was matched to fight Fitz
sjiiumons on October 31, 1895, but the con
test had to be declared off. His four
round contest with Tom Sharkey is too
well known for comment.
Fitzsimmons had several contests in
Australia before he arrived in this coun
try, but he carried with him one blot on
his escutcheon which will always darken
his record as a prize-tichter. His defeat
by Jim Hall in four rounas, on February
10, 1890, in Sydney will not soon be for
gotten oy Fi;zsimmon3 and his backers.
Fitz has intimated to tiis friends that he
could have, whipped Hall, but being on
his uppers at the time he took a licking
for cash. His principal fiÂ»hts in this
country were against Billy McCarthy of
Australia, whom lie defeated in nine
rounds in May, 1890, before the old Cali
fornia Club; Arthur Upham in New Or
leans, who wasjknocked out in Jive rounds;
Jack Dempsey, who lasted thirteen
rounds; Peter Maher in New Orleans, who
was knocked out in twelve rounds; Joe
Godfrey, who was knocked out in the first
round. Jim Hall and Fitz met again on
March 8, 1893, in New Orleans, and Hall
went to sleep in the fourth roui>d. Fiiz
fought a five-round draw with Choynski
June 17, 1894, in Boston, Mass." He
knocked Dan Creedon out in the second
round in New Orleans on September 26,
1894 He whipped Peter Maher in less
than two minutes in Texas, and then he
met Torn Sharkey in Mechanics' Pavilion
and was defeated oy the referee
It will be seen that the hardest fights
the Cornishman encared in were against
Billy McCarthy, Jack Dempsy, Joe Choyn
ski, Peter Maher and Tom Sharkey.
If any of the above-named pugilists
were now booked to light Corbett to a fin
ish, the betting would be at least two to
one in favor of Corbett, but because Fitz
simmons polished off his opponents with
such consummate ease, the sporting fra
ternity are of the oninion that he will
prove a hard game for Corbett, as the lat
ter is supposed to have been physically on
the retrograde for ?ome years.
If Corbett is really in anything like the
form he was when he whipped Sullivan,
he should certainly defeat Fitzsimmons',
as the Cornishman wouid nut be in the
race in a contest to a finish with such
men as Sullivan and Jackson when they
had seen better days.
In fact Fitzsimmons would not dream
of meeting Peier Jackson in a contest to a
finish at the time that Corbett faced the
colored gladiator, although he was older
and had more experience than the Cali
fornian at the time.
On form Corbett should win, provided
he is physically able to no the distance.
The nonsensical reports circulated about
Corbett's inability to inflict, punishment
are not worthy of notioe. He can hit and
hit hard, too, when the opportunity will
present itself for a good opening shot;
but all clever men are careful and do not
waste ammunition in punching holes in
the atmosphere.
The result of the fight depends on Cor
bett's condition.
THE ANGLER.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Will
Patroi the Coast Streams.
The recent heavy rains will interfere
with rishing in tide waters, but with a
spell of line weather the streams will soon
be in condition for angling.
Last Sunday live or six inrge fish were
caught at Point Reyes, and during the
week smtUl fishes were plentiful.
It is reported that the boys who reside
at the -White House," Point Reyes,
stretch topes across the big pool for the
purpose of capturing Looks and leaders
which the anglers lose whe.: fishine for
steelheads. Means will be used to stop
this iit tie scheme. The boys have been
prompted by people who should know
better than to interfere with the sport of
anglers, who arÂ° a benefit to that part of
the country.

BERKELEY, Cat,., March s.â Berkeley's prospects for success in the coming
intercollegiate baseball contests nave assumed a brighter aspect than at the opening
of the season by the appearance on the scene of a cracfc pitcher in the person of J. B.
Bykes, a student in the law department and a veteran player on the diamond. Sykes
is looked upon as a powerful man in the box and a heavy player on bases. He Is a
tower of strength, standing 6 feet 3 inches in height and weighing 190 pounds
stripped. His name is not unfamiliar to lovers of the National game, for he has
pitched for the Olympic, the University and the San Francisco Boys' High School
teams. Tbe last â¢work ne did of any mention was five years ago, when he pitched
for the Berkeley team through one season. He has been training regularly during
the last few months and is now twirling a swift, steady ball. He comes over to
Berkeley from San Francisco twice a week for practice with the 'varsity. Old players
consider him much superior to Morden, who held down the box for Berkeley last
season. Wheeler of the dental college is back at his old place behind the bat.
A rumor has been circulated that Syfces is a professional, but he says that the
story has no foundation in fact, and that he has his amateur papers.
On account of the rainy weather practice at Berkeley has been very light this
week, but most of the men have done more or less training in the "gym 1 ' and at light
fielding.
Ed a deputy, with instructions to patrol
the coast streams from now until the
opening of the trout-tishing season â
April 1. As the law is now very strict re
garding the killine'of steelneads by means
of spears and explosives, it is pre-umed
that some of the country people, who
never keep themselves informed by read
ing the papers, will have to suffer for their
ignorance of the law. The Commission
ers are determined to make examples ot
the law-breakers.

THE OARSMEN.
Busy Times Around the South
Ends' Boathouse.
At the last meeting of the South End
Rowing Club it was decided to enter four
crews in the carnival regatta â two senior
crews, an intermediate crew and a junior
crew, *
The senior barge race ought to be one of
the greatest events ever witnessed on this
coaat, as every club on the bay will par
ticipate.
The Olympic Club will be represented
for the first time in this race, and they
will have an opportunity of testing their
new barge. The Dolphin boys are doing
all in their powsr to organize a senior
crew, and it is hoped that tney will be
successful, as they have the material for a
ureat crew. The Stocktons, Pioneers and
Arlels will enter the same crews that
rowed in the Stock'on rogatta.
The new South Ends' intermediate crew
is doing excellent work and wiJl take a
practice spin with the senior crew on Sun
day morning.
On Saturday afternoon Frank Burke,
Archie Campbell, M. Tiernan and Joe
Campodonico visited the battL-sbip Ore
gon and had a hard row home against the
tide. Hereafier they will wait for the
Orison to visit them.
Frank Duplis?ea has purchased Jim
Foley's shell and has begun training for
the whaleboat regatta, to be given by the
Naval Battalion in the latter Dart of May.
Gus Carson's smiling conntenance was
greeted once more at the baathouse last
Sunday morning. His only desire is to
have another race with the Stockton
Giants, and he says he will then die

ROWING.
How the Oarsmen Are Enjoying
Themselves.
Fine weather and calm water attracted
the members of tne South End Rowing
Club iast Sunday morning.
The new senior crew, under the direc
tion of Captain Thomas, took one of their
usual long rows to the Dolphin boathouse
and return.
Tne new intermediate crew, composed
of Walter Duplissea, Tom Lynch, Will
Lynch Â»nd Georee Fox, also visited the
Dolphins. This crew has shown remarka
ble improvement within the last month,
and it is hoped they will continue their
good work.
Gus Carson's smiling "countenance was
once more welcomed by his fellow-mem
bers last Sunday morning. Mr. Carson's
only desire is to have another go with the
Stockton Giants, and, win or lose, he says,
he will die happy.
Bob McArthur was out in his shell,
which he purchased from William Mc-
Causland, and received some valuable in
struction irom Jim Foley.
On Washington's birthday Al Fritz and
Archie Campbell visited tbe United States
batt.le-ship Oregon. Mr. Campbell is de
veloping into a first-class oarsman, and
will represent the club in the next re
gatta.
At the last meeting M. J. Tiernan, Wm.
Mead, Frank Reicbling and Ed Rafferty

and on the following Sunday Hunters
Point will be tbe destination.
Tuar-of-War.
The last and most exciting tugs of the
big tournament which has been in prog
ress at the Mechanics' Pavilion for the
past week will occur tc-night. Interest
has been wrought up to a fever heat and
there is widespread discussion as to the
result of the finals to be determined to
night.
The contests will be as follows: Ireland
vs. Canada, Denmark vs. Italy, France vs.
Germany. Scotland vs. Norway, United
States vs. Sweden.
Ti.e American team is the most popular
and stands a good chance for first prize if
it can defeat the Swedes.
Despite the big counter-attractions and
the absorbing interest in the big fight at
Carson, the attendance has been large and
the audiences have evinced the greatest
interest in the lively *port r.fforded.
WEBSTER VISITS BABCOCK
Webster Gave Nctice That H
Will Call Again To-Day
0 ficially.
Babcock's Counsel Has Secured a Stay
and tbe Litigat on Is Not
Tet at an End.
Reginald H. Webster, who has been de
clared by the Superior Court to be entitled
to hold the position of Superintendent of
Schools, visited the rooms of the Board of
Education at the new City Hall yester
day. He also called upon Auditor Brod
erick and conferred with him. C. B.
Stone accompanied Mr. Webster to the
ball and was announced to be Mr. Web
ster's choice for Deputy Superintendent of
Schools. The appointment of the deputy
is wholly within the gift of the Superin
tendent and docs not need confirmation.
Mr. Stone is named to succeed Miss Eng
lish, who has occupied the position during
the past two months.
Notice of the decision of the court con
firmine Mr. Webster's claim to the posi
tion wai sent to Mr. Babcock yesterday
morning. Mr. Webster, accompanied by
Mr. Stone, called upon Mr. B&Dcock soon
after. The meeting between the two
gentlemen was outwardly friendly. Mr.
Webst r said that he desired to give Mr.
Bibcock a little time to gather his per
sonal property up preparatory to movine,
and suggested that he would probably call
again to-morrow. Then Mr. Webster and
Mr. French departed and secured a blank
form of appointment for the new deputy.
Some time daring the day Mr. Patter
son, attorney lor Mr. Babcock, visited
Judge Hebbard's court, and late yesterday
afternoon it was known that he had se
cured a stay of proceedings. Whether
this stay was secured in the hope of a re
hearing or for an appeal to the Supreme
Court Mr. 4labcock did not say. Mr.
Webster had left the hall when the stay
was secured. .
The question of salary was discussed by
Mr. Webster and Mr. Broderick. The
Auditor said that he mast take official
notice of the fact that Mr. Webster had
been drawing his salary as a principal
while the proceedings in court have been
pending and during the period interven
ing since Mr. Webster received his cer
tificate of election. Mr. Webster explained
that he urew the salary while the question
was at issue as to who was entitled to the
position of Superintendent as a matter of
necessity to preserve it from loss. The
move made by Mr. Babcocfc's attorney
yesterday indicates that he has not yet
given up the contest for the position.

ONE CONTRACTOR
HAS BEEN INDICTED
J. J. Mulcreavy to 80. Re
quired to Answer a
Charge of Perjury.
Made False Returns of Work
Done at tbe City and
County Hospital.
Aa Expert Measured His Work and
Found It Short of the Amount
He Dr.w Pay For.
J. J. Mulcreavy, contractor, will have
to answer the cnarge of perjury in the
criminal court The Gi and Jury yester
day filed an indictment him be
fore Judge Cook.
J. J. Mulcreavy is the contractor who
laid certain concrete flooring at the City
and County Hospital and made oath to
measurements in excess of the amount
and drew pay lor that excess. His work
is a part of the grabbing arrangement that
began with the appropriation of $10,000 by
the late Board of Supervisors for im
provements and repairs at the hospital,
and which developed into a noisome
ecandal. Columns and columns have
been printed in the newspapers about it,
and the present Grand Jury began a care
ful and searching investigation of the
matter almost as soon as it was sworn in.
That investigation has continued from
sittine to sitting almost ever since, and
yesterday the indictment against Mul
creavy waÂ« filed, with bonds fixed at
$5000.
The evidence is said to be as conclusive
in tnis caÂ»e as figures, which do not lie,
can make it. Tne contractor laid a cer
tain number of feet square of concrete
and swore he bad laid a considerably
greater number and drew pay for that
greater number. Experts were sent out to
mate the measurements of the work and
the discrepancy was at once discovered.
Mulcreavy was only one in a crowd who
made a grab at that "SIO,OOO. There were
contractors and contractors, and some who
were not contractors. To get at the facts
the Grand Jirry has summoned before it
members of the Board of Health, members
of the Board of Supervisors, ex-Superin
tendent Stahle, his bookkeeper, the stewara
and nearly every official about the hospi
tal, as well as experts who had been sent
by it to make special investigations.
Thi^ is tne ?econd indictment found by
the Grand Jury against contractors hav
ing to do with the City and County Hos
pital, the other being Frank Marty, who
furnished milk to the place and who had
a habit of slipping pieces of gold to offi
cials connected therewith.
It is altogether possible that other in
dictments may follow touching other than
the contractors, for the jury is convinced
that only a conspiracy with officials which
guaranteed the contractors a certain
security would have emboldened them to
auch a decree as to admit of their return
ine and making oath to lalse bills.
The jury spent a large part of yc3terday
afternoon in hearing witnesses in the
Cooney matter. Richard V. Dey, Charles
Wueeler E?q and Charles Clark gave
testimony. This case will drag aiong for
some time.
BUTLER'S LATEST MOVE.
The United States I ircuit Court Ap
pealed To for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus.
The attorneys for Murderer Butler, alias
Newman, alias Burgess, alias half a dozen
other names, took a new tack yesterday
when they asked Judge Morrow, sitting in
the United States Circuit Court.for a writ
of habeas corpus.
They contend that the Australian mur
derer is illegally held in custody by
United States Marshal Barry Baldwin.
As reason for the allegation they repeat
the argument made by Mr. Black during the
examination â namely, that the extradi
tion laws provide for the deportation only
of criminals fleeing from justice and seek
ing an asylum in this country. Mr. Black
contends that his client came to California
on the Swanhilda, not seeking an asylum,
but en route to England. He inÂ»istt>,
moreover, that a British ship, even though
in American waters, is not American ter
ritory. Butler nrver, of his own free will,
set foot on American soil, but was forc
ibly taken into this country from British
territory â the ship Swanhilda.
Judge Morrow sanctioned the issuance
of the writ, making it returnable on Mon
day next at 10 o'clock.
It is understood that in case the writ is
dismissed Attorney Black will appeal to
the United States Supreme Court. Should
such be the course of events it will be
months at least before the accused can be
taken to Australia.
Divorce Sutts Begun.
Suits for divorce have been filed in the

ARGUMENT.
Bat Dr. Clinton Admits That the
Company's Salaries Are Not
Unreasonab'e.
The water rates investigation was re
sumed before the Board of Supervisors in
' committee of the whole last night.
Before going into committee, however,
Supervisor Bntt moved the following
resolution, which was adopted without
debate:
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of San Francisco request
the members of the Legislature, particularly
the representatives from San Francisco, to use
all honorable means to defeat Senate bill 392,
introduced by Senator Bulla, striking the
â¢word "consecutive" from the present law per
mitting the five-Dlock use ot the tracks on
street railroads in common; and be it further
Betolved. That we protest against the adop
tion of this measure as one which will confirm
the present streetcar monopoly in this City and
prevent the possibility of legitimate competi
tion and exclude independent railways from
access to the ferry depot, built fat great public
cost for the convenience of the people, and
trota che park maintained out of the proceeds
of general taxation. And be it farther re
solved that a substitute bill be recommended
to give any company a ten block use of any
one street in common with any other com
pany on the payment of a proper compensa
tion for the use of tracks to the end that the
, public streets be not made an impassable bar
rier against public rights, and that franchises
never meant to be exclusive be now legislated
into oppressive monopolies.
The board then went into committee
of the whole, with Dr. Clinton in the chair.
'The chairman suggested that it would
be advisable for the members of the com
mittee to confine their questions to the
company's itemized statement relative to
operating expen-es. By adhering to this
method confusion would be avoided.
The statement read as follows:

Secretary Ames stated in reply to the
chairman that the sum of $15,000 32
charged to the Lake Merced pump was in
curred by material, the cost of running
the pump, coal, oil, etc. The number of
employes was nine in all, viz.: One chief
engineer, two assistant engineers, three
firemen, one oiler, one coalpasser and
one helper. The chairman asked Mr.
Schussler, "How long is it, since the lake
furnished water to the City?"
The witness replied that Lake Merced
had not been used since 1800. The com
pany pumped water from San Andreas,
using the Lake Merced pump, into the
Pilarcitos pipe. The wages per month
for this station were $735 when the men
were working full time. The total run
ning expenses in 1894 were $21,485 93.
The expenses varied with the quantity
of water pumped. The company paid
515,295 to pump 1,561,000.000 gallons at
Belmpnt, 200 fe t high, equal to 3,122,000,
--000 gallons 100 feet high.
These figures did not include the inter
est or the cost of the plant. He estimated
that the expense of pumping 100 feet high
"amounted to 60 cents a thousand gallons.
The original purchase price of the Ala
NINA DE ST. HUBERT.
Miss St. Hubert is one of San Francisco's most beautiful and accomplished girls.
As a violinist sne is well known. A perfect master of the instrument, her playing is
indeed delightful. She accompanied GuilJe during his aarond week at tne Orpheum.
' He sang "Aye Maria," and her excellent rendering of the difficult obligato made her
i favorite at once. Besides the violin Miss St. Hubert plays several other instru
ments. Both Guille and her teacher, Noah Brandt, are very enthusiastic over her
work, and predict * brilliant future for her, should she decide to take to concert work.
It may be remembered that during the World 'â  Fair the schoolchildren of the City
held a Kirmess. Miss St. Hubert on that occasion played a solo on the cornet. There
was nothing particular in that, but the fact that three months before Miss St. Hubert
couid not play a note on that instrument makes it an interesting indication of her
musical aptitude.
meda works was $1,000,000, including the
water rights and 4200 acres of farming
land in tne Calaveras Valley. The cost of
pumping in Cincinnati was much cheater
because coal cost less. He considered that
the difference in the cost of coal would
explain the difference in the cost of pump
ine here and in Cincinnati. The cost oi
pumping in Chicago could also be ac
counted for by the greater cheapness of
coal there.
The Mayor â VÂ» T hat price do you pay for
coal?
The witness said that the price varied
all the way from $6 30 to $7 80 a ton at
Bel mont.
Dr. Dodge commented on the creat con
trast between the cost of pumping in the
Eastern cities and in San Francisco, con
cerning which the wnness expressed him
self somewhat skeptical, and assured Dr.
Dodge that he would be greatly pleased
to read the article from which he obtained
his da. a.
Mr. Schussler went into details' as to
the method employed in keeping the coa.
account, and explained that when he
found that the amount of i'oal burned at
a given punioing station did not agree
with the amount reported he immediately
proceeded to investigate.
Dr. Dodge â Wnat amount of water
should one ton of coal send into the
City?
The witness said at the rate of 8,000,000
gallons a day from the Belmont pumping
station the monthly amount would be
about 240,CC0,000 gallons. He conld not
remember the amount of coal used in that
time, bu: couid tell by referriug to' his
books.
The Mayorâ How much coal do you con
sume annually?
The witness said that would depend upon
the amount of pumping. In lg;*j they
pumped 3,605,000.000 fjallons; in 1895
2.696.000,000; in 1894, 3,002 000,000: in 1893
2,495,000,000; in 1892, 4.230,000.000. The
amount varied considerably evÂ«ry year,
and the amount of coal they consumed
also varied approximately with tne
amount of water they pumped.
The coal bill last year was $25,000 in
round figures and 3,005,000,000 gallons
were pumped during that period. It was
not only coal, he said, that was *o much
dearer here than in the East. The com
pany's salaries were also much higher â
25 and 30 per cent. Their head engineer
received $150 a month, assistants $100 each
and firemen $30.
, The Mayor â The railway company pays
less thar. $5 for coal.
The witness insisted that the company
did cheaper pumping with dearer coal
than otliers did with cheaper coal.
The committee discussed the next item
of $10,742 34 for the Clarendon Heights
pump, briefly. Mr. Schussler said that
this was ustd to pump water from the
j Crystal Springs reservoir and to raise it
1500 feet in height to a large reservoir on
j the extension of Eighteenth street, where
! it was distributed.
The chairman asked for an explanation
regarding the cost of $S7O for theÂ«l'ortola
r^sprvoir.
The witness said that trie company had
never received any water from tn is source.
The Stan ord University was supplied
therefrom. Hut the company would get a
proportion of the water a- soon as a cer
tain number of leet were added to the top
of the dam. The dam cost nearly $120,000
and wouid be tne foundation for the com
pany's main dam. The company was the
real beneficiary, because they purchased
by the contract wilh the local company
fully a half interest in all the water rights.
On the motion of the Mayor the com
mittee proceeded to the consideration of
the general expense account of $17,981 70.
Secretary Ames took the stand and
enumerated the following as among some
of the items of expenditure:
Advertising, $5250 40; trustees, $2304: em
ployes overtime, Â£540; damage claims $3K5;
City license, $604; raiirosd. $565 20;
donations to charity, $455; pensions,
$470; bills receivable. $iJ000; certificate
tax, $173; wagon license, !jvis 50; groceries,
$52 45; engineers' picnic, $721; team". S?I9U;
microscope, $92; general expenses, $335 15;
shipping department, $314 50; Stock and
Bond Exchange, $25; bad coin, $40 50; com
mission to Baldwin & Hammond, $1013 69;
fire alarms, $13 40; more donnt oiib tochiiruy,
$420; service* of experts, $162; sundry ex
penses, $465 83; sundry employes' overtime,
$565; legai expenses, $16,596.
Mayor Phelan was anxious to know the
items of the advertising account, which
Mr. Ames sad he could not give off-hand.
He was required by the chairman to pre
pare such a statement in time for the
next meeting.
Dr. ftottanzi wanted to know whether
the company had not paid large sums for
laudatory articles published iti the daily
press.
Mr. Amesâ l don't know.
The company refused to state the indi
vidual amounts received by the com
pany's attorneys. The company, Mr.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 6, 1897.
Ames said, retained three attorneys regu
larly.
Mr. Echussler resumed the stand to ex
plain the sums allotted to meter repairs
and meter expense accounts. The coat of
a meter, ne aaid, depended upon its size.
There were in use at the beginning of the
year 11,018 meters. At the beginning of
the year 1894 tiiere was as many as 15,964,
but the company had been taking them
off gradually as the amount of water in
creased in the reservoirs.
Secretary Ames was then questioned
regarding the remaining accounts. The
bookkeeping account, he said, was com
posed almost altogether of salaries; engi
neers' department, partly of salaries and
partJv of survey expenses and outside
work;, inspectors' account, of salaries;
collectors' account, ditto. The general
salaries account had already been ren
dered in full.
Mr. Scliussler's salary was charged part
ly to the engineers' department.
The Mayor referred to the statement of
general salaries and discovered that the
average annual salary paid by the com
pany to eacn of the eleven general officers
remaining alter the six trustees were
eliminated was $6000. There were seven
trustees including the president, but he
deducti-d only six, leaving eleven general
officers who received an aggregate of
$Â«1.000. This dividpd among eleven
officers left about $5626 a year paid to each.
â  Further desultory discussion followed,
in the course of wiiicli the Mayor asked
the chairman if he intended to press tue
Inquire for the individual salaries of gen
eral officer?.
The chairman stated that the company
declined to srive this information for pub
lication. "Personally," added the chair
man, "I can find no lault with the sal
aries paid. I was under the impression
that they were much higher than I found
them to be. Perhaps tne rirsi-eiasa pro
fessional man masea as much or more. '
Mr. KeUogq â They make more.
"Personally," continued the chairman,
"I do not rare to press the question. It is
for you to decide, gentlemen."
Dr. Kottanzi â I believe they are on rec
ord as b-'ing In default for not enswering
to Â»liis committee oi the whole. That is
sufficient.
The Mayor wanted to Know the amount
paid for salaries live years ago, his irn
pressioa being that their tendency wa.- to
rise.
Mr. Ames tlvnight the tendency was
rather stationary. There might have been
increases in one or two instances.
Mr. Keilosj; said that the general office
extenses ha I been decreased because
three offices were now rilled by one
person.
Mr. Schussler was again subjected (o a
lengthy examination on the subject of
connexion charges. He said that last
y^ar there were 39,355 customers; at the
beginning of 1897 mere were 40,189, be
ing an increase oi 834.
The Mayor â Haven't we been assuming
60,000 customers in San Francisco in esti
mating the pur capita rate?
"That," replied Mr. Schussler, "has
nothing to do with the per capita rate.
There are only 40,000 water rate-payers.
Many of tnnse, nowever. own more than
one house. We nave a great many more
convections than customers These
40,189 pay for 58.3)5 famii.es 15.451 btibi
n -83 places ati'l 143 public place*, ruakinu
a total of 76,929 Consumers. Those are ail
included in t0e 40.189."
Referring to tne company's charge of
$15 for each new connection, the chairman
said that a practical plumber had stated
that he would like to take the contract for
making connections at $10 apiece, and ho
would lurnisii a bon.l to perlorm the work
satisfactorily.
The witness said that the company was
obliged to keep quite a force of men in its
shopÂ«, and preferred to charge a higher
rate rather than lose money oa the work.
The company employed the men by the
day and thereby insured a b'lter class of
work, though it might cott a little more.
Mayor Phelan directed the discussion to
the company's taxes. "I notice, " he said.
"that they have increased from $90,000 to
$127,000 in this year."
Mr. Ames explained that the latter
amount included a portit n of tho next
year's taxes, paid on installment. The
actual taxes for the year will amount to
$103,000.
The Mayor contended that it was some
thing unusual for a company to pay more
than one year's taxes in one year.
He added that he would liKe to intro
duce some testimony to show the decrease
in the rate of security during the last rive
years'.
Mr. Schussler said he feit competent to
give the required information, and again
look the stand.
The Mayor uut a question regarding the
quotations of the Pennsylvania Railway
Company's stock, to which Mr. Schuss er
replied : "I know nothing about that "
"Tl,en," said trie Mayor, "the Commer
cial Cable and Postal Telegraph Com
pany."
"You know well enough that I know
nothing about that," rejoined the witness.
"The only resource we have is to fell
stock and to give reasonable assurance
that the buyers will get 6 per cent. If the
stockholuers are told that they will* only
get 5 per cent, we cannot get over 80 cents
on th- dollar, and the consequence is that
we have to spII 10,000 snares at 5 per cent,
instead of 8001) at 6 per cent. It the rates
are left at 6 per cent, liien people have
sufficient confidence to purchase stock at
as high a rate as possible."
The Mayor â I want to know why when
other stocks soli al par there should be so
much d.s:rust in this case?
Mr. Schusterâ Triers are- no such cases
where Supervisors control the stock.
Show me one. The raie is subject to the
control of th* Supervisors year after year
and every new board wants 10 distinguish
itself by reducing the rate and seriously
Interfering witn the proper management
of the works. The City should take more
interest in keeping them up to their pres
ent magnificent position.
The Mayor quoted from a pamphlet
deaiine wiih the stock, of Mackay's Com
mercial and Postal Company showing
that Commercial stock now sells for 168}^,
and Pos;al on a -1 ncr cent basis is snapped
up at f;7 and 98. Tue policy in these cases
had been one of contraction instead of the
inflation of capita!.
Mr. Schuster contended that this stock
was not subject to the Supervisors. The
water company's fi per cent bonds sold at
120 and their 4 per cents at 100, because
tliey were secure from interruptions of
this nature, whereas the stock had to bear
the brunt of the Supervisors' action. If
the company could procure a twenty
years' agreement, to guarantee the 5 per
cents, that stock wouid sell at. par.
In the course of further discussion the
Mayor wished ,to aak A. H. R. Schmidt,
the cashier of the German Bank, whether
it was not a matter of fact that the rate
of interest on all classes of property had
greatly decreased during the last ten
years.
Mr. Kellogg objected and the chairman
called him to order, asserting that any
citizen was at lib j rty to give testimony
before the corn mi: tee. Air. Schmidt, how
ever, declined to answer, and the commit
tee soon after rose, reported progress, and
the board adjourned to resume the in

James A. Herne, who ha 3 created
new things upon the stage, who has

of the theater, and who will no doubt
have svieh a following in the future as to
give him the rating of a founder of school,
is not only a great realistic actor, but he
is a careful and earnest student of social
JAMES A. HERNE.
problems. He is known everywhere
throughout the country a* among the
most ardent champions of the single tax.
Everywhere he goes he is called upon to
"help the cause" in some way, for he is
known to be always willing, and when he
is not called upon he does it of his own ac
cord.
For instance, upon his visit to this City
some vear3 ago, when he was not nearly
so well known as he is now, he hired a
hall, paying the expenses himself, in or
der to preach the doctrine which he be
lieves will eventually inaugurate the era
of freedom and justice among men.
Mr. Herne is not merely a student, he
is a scholar. He is a strong personality,
a real iorc.e. He talks as impressively
from the platform as he piays deiightiully
before the footlights, and the Single-tax
Society is arranging to hava him lecture
under its auspices during hi 3 stay in the
City.
"The single taxer," said Mr. Herne, "has
become a factor in affairs that is hardly
iealized by those who have not watched
tiie signs of the times. Some of these
days the question will get before the peo
ple, and, as Henry George says, ihere will
be so many of them tnat their opponents
will be kept guessing where they came
from. They will seem to rise up out of
the ground.
"The question is now Before the Legis
lature oi five States in the form of con
stitutional amendmentsâ the StaTes of
California, Colorado, Delaware, Kansas
and Washington. The last-named State
will be first to sco the new era inaugur
ated it the signs count for anything. It
is aUo bsing worked indirectly in New
York. It is in the National Congress, led
by Maguire, and it will remain there,
thrusting itself forward forever until its
mission is realized.
'â¢Yes. I have been called upon to talk
the single tax at almost every stopping
piace over the country and beyond it. In
deed, they have the single tax now, prac
tically, in ManitoDa. The people are
happy and well-to-do. They know noth
ing of tramps and beggars there. It is
amazing to me that the system is not
adopted now, or long since, in view of the
conditions which I find everywhere as I
find them here â men who do not warn
charity, but work, and who are yet com
pelled to drag wagons about the street,
begging for food. The single tax, at one
stroke, in one day, would change those
conditions, would give employment to ail
and set everybody on the road to pros
perity and a higher plane of existence.
"Is v not s'.range that they reJuse to
listen and keep binding themselves with
new chains day b/ day? But, as I said
before, it will burst upon us some day
from some place tbat even the prophets of
the doctrine cannot now nominate.
"I have said tnat I think the State of
Washington will inaugurate it. Certainly
the indications are most lavoraDle there.
There is a majority in the Assembly there
in lavor of it. The Governor, a Populist,
is opposed to it. It is hard to reconcile
these things and it is as well, perhaps,
not to try but just go on making the
tight. The State is full of single-taxers
however, and a good strong pull, all to
gether, would carry it over the line into
the promi-ed land, so to speak.
"That reminds me that I organized the
firÃÃÂ»sinÂ«le-tax club in that State. There
were seven single- taxers in the State when
I chanced to co there in the lirst instance.
They asked me to talk on the subject on
Sunday night and I consented. They
hired an old barracks of a ball, stocked it
with benches and chairs and then put
forth their energies to fill it with influen
tial people. They got together a remarka
ble audience for the place â lawyers, doc
'ors, preac iers, Judges â the very best
men and their wives. Weil, we had a
famous meeting. It was after 12 o'clocK
be. ore it broke up, and the enthusiasm
was great. That meeting resulted in the
formation of a club. I saw a clipping in
the paper after I left. It was called the
James A. Herne Single-Tax Club. From
thai small beginning the State has taken
the first placÂ» in the lists.
"I was at Denver a short time ago, and
was asked io speak before a joint sersion

work in my speech on the single tax.

together, and then I pieacned to them.

SERGEANT NEARLY
TWENTY YEARS
End of Thomas McKenna's
Service to the
City.
Succumbed to an Operation
After Much Suf
fering.
S:nc2 72 H? Was a Member of the
Police Force and Was Very
Popular.
Sergeant Thomas McKenna. one of the
best known officers of the Sau Francisco
poiice force, died at Dr. McLean's sani
tarium yesterday afternoon.
Sergeant McKenna has for several years
Leen troubled with an affection of the
throat, which of late has assumed can
cerous symptoms. The trouble caused by
this affliction finally became so burden
some that the sergeant determined to risk
an operation, though, he was advised that
the result was apt to be fatal.
With this warning in view the sergeant
arranged ail his private business and got
the affairs of his office in shape. On
Wednesday he went to the hospital and
the operation was performed the succeed
ing day. Ii was 2:45 r. M. yesterday when
his decease occurred.
Ti omas McKenna was born February
14, 1837, in Randolph County, Illinois.
D.-ceiuber 20, 1872, ne was appointed on
tne police lorce of this City, and served
faitlifuiiy as patrolman for six years. In
December, 187S, he was aupointed ser
geant, and was placed in charge of the
liquor license department of the police
ollice.
This position he held to the time of his
death, and it was in the capacity of license
sergeant he was principally known to the
puclic.
bergeant McKenna was highly regarded
by his official superior?, not only for his
faithiul and efficient services, but for
many sterling qualities of personal char
acter. He was popular with all members
of t lie force and had hosts of friends in
the inofficial public.
He leaves a widow and two dauehters,
one of whom is the wife of Policeman
Jo n Lewis.
The funeral will be under the auspices
of Mount Moriaft Lodge, P. and A. M., of
which the deceased was a member. He
was also a. mem bar of San Francisco Chap
ter No. 3 of the Ancient Order of Druids
and of the Knights of Pythias.
Sunday at 2 p. m. will probably be de
eded upon as the time of the services.
A MAD RACE A JOB.
Dizz/ Experience cf Frederick
C. Rooke in a Swaying
Rai'way Cab.
Was Bound ior His Home in
Australia ani Caught the G ng
plank Just in Time.
Frederick C. Rooke, clerK of the New
South Waies Supreme Court, who for
some months past has been doing Europe,
arrived here yesterday in the cab of the
Overland Mail, after a breathless race
across the continent to catch the steamer
Aianieda for home.
Rooke has been away on a vacation,
and he had timed himself to get tome to
the scratch when h:s period of absence
was up. But the steamer Umbria was a
day late on the Atlantic, owing to heavy
weather. When be reached New York he
was in a desperate strait. He caught
the fastest train he could bound out toward
the sunset, but still felt the ground sink*
inÂ£ from under him.
On renchinK Chicago he was six hours
too late for the last overland that would
reach San Francisco in time. In his des
p ration he iried to secure passage on the
Burlington fast mail. But this train does
not under any circumstances carry any
passeneers.
Mr. Rooke explained that he was racing
for hi 9 job and that he dimply must go.
Superintendent Troy finally decided that
he might ride in tne cab with the en
gineer. This was a snap for Rooke. He
cot a box of cigars and something in a
flask ana got aboard. Thus it was that he
arrived, here yesterday. The Alameda
was lir-een minutes late and Mr. Rooke
reached the gansr'nlank -just in time. He
yet L as some 7000 miles to ride over the
billowy main before he can be sure he has
bfa position. He stood bis wild run well.

GENtKAL CONDI I'IOX OF TRADE.
The placing Of orders tor nearly 1,500,000 tons
of steel within the past three weeks is the most
Important influence for improvement in general
trade since the November election, says Brad
street's of February 27. The contracts for sieel
rails taken since the break in the price, together
with expenditure necessary to lay the rails, means
the placing In circulation of no less than $35,
--000.000. The meaning of sales of mils for export
has been exaggerated, as some orders placed
abroad were due to English mills being tempora
rily, engaged on other forms of steel. Many
woolen mills In New England have started up
Manufacturers are buying in expectation of a duty
being placed on raw wool. Recent improvement
In cotton goods is maintained. At most cities
there has been no change In the volume or temper
of trade. â¢ Demand has been quiet, and while ex .
pectatiocs favor an early improvement, progress
thus far has been somewhat disappointing.
THE COAL TRADE.
The circular of I. S*tenart gives the receipt of
coal at this port during the first two months of
1897 at 220,700 tons, azainst LM9.500 tons during
the same period in 1896, and says: -The de iv
eries of coal in port during the month from the va
rious sourc-s of supply have been about the aver
age quantity usually received at this seasou of the
year, excel/line English anthracite, there having
"t>oen no arrivals of this coal, and none aie due for
â¢some time. The market must necessarily become
bare of this coal in the meantime."

the stock market in early trading to-day occa
â¢ sioned no great surprls? to the general run of
traders- The further decline in consols and the
fact that American quotations were 1/4 below yes

and promptly attacked the list at the opening, but
met with very poor, success, and after merely
fractional concessions the market started up in
lively fashion. It was evident that the powers be

CUICACO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ir.i,. March 5 âWheat had a lively
and strons openlns market this morning, first
prices being from 6,^ to 1c higher than yester
day's closing prices. The Euro] political situa
tion has again become a factor and caused the
appreciation in prices this morning. New York
reported that cable offers last night had met with
no acceptances. There was a weakening feature
an.l caused some selling of wheat here. Receipts
in the Northwest were quite liberal at 298 cars,
a-ainst 130 last Friday and 331 a year ago. Chi
cago received 16 cars and inspected out 34,260
bushe p. laier the market became strong and a.l
vanced to opening figures, the war scare remaining
the factor. Exports were fair at 351,911 bushels.
Closing Continental cables were irregular, Paris
being higher a d Berlin and Antwerp lower. May
wheat opened from 76Vjc to 76Vic, sold between
75% c and 765^0, closing at the outside, i@iygc
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts tor
to-morrow, 17 cars. No. 2 rd , spot, wheat
ranged from 84% cto 87 /8 C , closing about 85S/g<6
87V2C
COKNâ Was affected by the war alarm, t>v
lighter receipts than expectedâ 2Bs carsâ ana by
the burning or aÂ»i elevator at Peona containing
250,000 bushes of this grain. The house which
owned the elevator was a good buyer. With
drawals from store were light at 9628 bushels.
Liverpool cables quoted i/id advance. Exports
were 195,485 bushels. May corn opened at 24yi~,
sola between 24i/ B @24y4C, closing at the outside,
1 /2@VBC higher th.iti yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow, 295 cars.
OA'l : ne uousethut bought corn against thÂ«
burned elevator stocks at Peorla was also promi
nent as a purchaser of oats, there having been
3011,000 bushels or this grain burned. This was a
tinning influence as was also the general specula
tive uneasiness noted in the other grains. Re
ceipts were 23it cars. There were no withdrawals
from store. Kxr>or:s were 90,778 bushels. May
oats closed 3/ B @y,c higher than yesterday. Esti

DUN'S REVIEW . OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V.. March 5.â X. Dun * Co.
will say to-morrow in tliÂ»ir weekly review of
trade: , The slow and , gradual improvement in
trade has continued during tl>Â»*past week. There
is a better demiiud tor moti products on the whole
with continuance of speculative buying in some,
notably in wool, because of expected duties.
Meanwhile money markets continue as easy and
undisturbed as if there never ha.l been any anxiety
about tne cod reserve, and fairly large sales:, f
stocks on London account during the week possi
bly because of mien atlonai anxi ties have made
110 perceptible cliff rentes in American markets.
Report* of probable need, abro.id have ne.ped
speculation in wn-at somewhat, but i, has risen
but 3 rents, though the price is sail lower than
two weeks a.i;o. . *
Corn is a cent stronger, about the price of two
weeks ago. Western receipts of wheat are still
small, 1,559,281" bushels against 2.301,633 last
year, and the Atlantic exports, flour included,
were for the week 1,232,412 bushels, against
1,541,135 last year, but ihf corn exports continue
so heavy as to compensate largely.' if not wholly,
for RDy decrease in wheat, amoun ting for the
week to 2,779 974 bushels, Gulf pore* not in
cluded, against' 1,014. 391) last year. Reckoning
ha f a bushel of corn for one bushel of wheat, the
Â«rÂ»in supply of other countries continues much
larger than a year aÂ«O.
> ouon has declined an eighth and with good
i- "a ion. Although the receipts from plantations fall
off the decrease is not greater ihmi the decrease in
consumption, Owing to the stoppage of mills. As
there is comparatively little cotton available in
the country the lnnrKet i.i very convenient for
speculators to manipulate.
While many of the mills have stopped produc
tion Â«i cotton goods for a lime the general outlook
is on the who.c unchanged and the demand for
goods does not Improve while print cloths are a
suave lower. The demand for wool has dimin
ished although out little, lhe boot and shoo in
dustry can leckon a good many more shops at
work and shipments have been an large for the
past four weeks as In any previous year. The
market for materials has not changed to any Im
portant extent.
Wh.lu the demand for Bessemer pig has sus
stainea the recent advance to $10 75 per ton at
t'itisluirg and giay forge is still quoted at $9 40
and there is less cutting in prices to get mote
business In fiuisbe l products, tup general ranee
of prices still continues very low. Wire nails
have been advance.l by very heavy buying to
$1 40 per keg, without change in cut nails, which
are dull, and mere is less evidence of Eastern
mi. Is se. ling rails below $-0, except for export,
tome sale ÃOf .i.at character having been made at
$18. \Vra em makers are sal 1 to be linn at $21
per ton. but ihe demands of moat impoitant rail
ways have been supplied for the present. The con
sumers of billets aie not in he market Just now,
and with somewhat larger production of pinion
it may be doubted whether outs de of rails the
demand for finished products equals the capacity
of in* works.
Failures for the week have bean 246 in the
United Estates against 285 last year, and 59 in
Canada against till last year.

THE STOCK MAEKET.
There was not much change in mining stocks
yesterday. Business was very dull, as usual. The
market was firmer at the close.
The Pacific Mieet : Metal Works has declared
the usual dividend, payable immediately.
The transfer books in the office 'of the Hale &
isorcross .Mining Company will be closed to-day.
The annual meeting of the stockholders will be
held on Wednesday.
The Virginia Chronicle says: Whatever other
causes may have combined to the sudden slump
in values it Is certain that no unfavorable change
in the situation In the mines can be cited as one of
Lhem. On the contrary, tin* work now in progress
in Consolidated California & Virginia Is the most
important since 1886â raising on the: rich ore
streak above the 1550 level. This work began on
Monday, and the time elapsed since then ha* not
been sufficient to advance the work to a point that
will determine its extent or value. There is now
accumulated in the bins at the C. & C. shaft nearly
sufficient ore fora run, and shipments to the Mor
gan mill will begin at an early da c. The bullion
proceeds of thl* ore, which shows an average
Â»s<ay value of over $40 per ton, will mater ally
aid in covering operating expenses.
The report from the Standard Consolidated for
the week is ai follows: 245 levelâ The Bullion
vein north drift on the fau t seam from No. 3 up
raise has encountered nothing of value. Have
r.iisid above i hi,s drift on a small seam. -Raise 2

PRINCIPLE ONLY
H. B. Land Again Runs for
Treasurer With No
Hope of Success.
Postoffice Blocked With the
Enormous Amount of Elec
tion Matter Mailed.
Saloon- Closing Advocates Mcke a Par
ti:! Report Which They Claim Is
a Sample of Public Feeling.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. )
Among the many candidates now seek
ing Ifoe suffrages of the voters there is at
least one man who is making the cam
paign for principle only. On several occa
sions at county and city elections this
man has been nominated with no show of
success, but he is always willing to be led
to the slaughter for the sake of his princi
ples.
This man is H. B. Land, who is now a
candidate for City Treasurer on the Pro
i.bition ticket. Year after year Mr. Land
â i^ been accorded the small vote of bis
;arty :n this vicinity. Last year it showed
a decided decrease, but nothing dauuted
he allowed his name to be placed on tlie i
H, B. Land, the Salvationist and
Prohibitionist, Who Rons for
Office Without Any Hope of
Success*
ticket by the twelve delegates at Hamil
ton Hall that constituted the Prohibition
convention.
Mr. Land does not expect to be elected
nor. does he expect his party to score a
large vote. At the present time the tem
perance movement in municipal politics
has taken a new turn and the genuine
prohibitionists have not been heard from
at a single meeting since they made their
nominations. The work of advocating
saloon closing has been taken ud by peo
ple of all parties and in the mattsr of ad
vocating temperance the Prohibition party
has been outdone by tuose who it has
always said have been controlled by the
} ower that operates from what they call
the "saloon element."
vVhen asked ab ut his chances of suc
cess Mr. Land stated that it was simply a j
matter of principle and he did net expect
at th time to receive enough votes to
place him in office. He is also possessed
of another distinction never before found |
in an office-seeker in this city. Mr. Land
is (i .sergeant and treasurer of the local
Salvation Army corps and is one of the
mo-t valuable and unassuming men
among his fellow-soldiers of the cross.
The advocates of saloon closing have
just completed a house-to-house canvass j
of i be city, but they will not make public |
heir figures, which they declare show a
very large majority in their favor. Dr. j
' ar'coli announced last night that two of \
['â¢he reports of .he canvass in East Oakland >
â  are particularly encouraging. One report
I hows that out of twenty-nine houses
Visited twenty-eight agreed to close the
saloons. The second report showed twenty
four against the saloon and eleven waver
â¢ ing. 1 iiesÂ° figures, however, cannot be said
to fairly represent the situation, and a con
servative estimate seems to place the pro
portion in the ratio of six to four and a
half >n favor of closing.
In an interview to-day Rev. Father Mc-
Hweeuey said: "The Catholic church has
legislated at all times and in the straight
esi possible manner arainst the curse of
drunkenness. Not in this nor in any other
land has. there existed a power more un-, .
* tiring or more fearless in i he cause of
temperance. Our very best efforts should
be given, and given most willingly, to
check an evil that brings and keeps such
misery in our midst."
J. West Martin, president of the Union
Savings Bank, said to-day: ''I am opposed
to the open saloon as now conducted in
this city. As a general proposition, lam
opposed to ' liquor in every manner and
form, because of its evil effects upon the
community and State. If such a thing as
closing the saloon be possible I believe
every man should vote in favor of it."
The present campaign has made a large
. amount of extra work for the postolfice
officials. To a certain extent it has been
a fireside campaign. The voters have
. shown a disposition to receive their poli
tics at home rather than attend the nu
merous ward meetings, and as the candi
dates could not draw them out they have
resorted, as never before, to the practice
!of sending their campaign circulars
i hroti^h the mail. For the past weeic
i' very voter on the great register has re
. e;ved not less than three pieces of mail
' containing pictures of candidates, ex- !
pressions of views, -various kinds of
pledges and much good advice, all bear
ing on the campa:gn. |In some instances
this has been carried .so far as to include
the criticism of phrenologists in proof of
t, c fact that a candidate possesses the
necessary qualifications to serve the city
ably. Postmaster White said to-night
1 that the office is blocked, and that it will
not be relieved by to-morrow night.
The people who are prosecuting the j

anti-saloon campaign have also adopted
this method, and probably there has
never b?en a time when Hie intelligent
voter has been so thoroughly informed on
the ustiea that arc to be decided next
Monday as he has been during the past
week.
Contrary to precedent, although the
election U but. three days < ff, there has
been kb yet no withdrawal of independent

HAEEOR COMPLICATIONS.
President Cleveland Did Not Sign the
Appropriation Bill.
OAKLAND, Cal., March s.â There is
somedoubt as to the fate of the appropria
tion for Oakland harbor improvement?
which was passed by both houses of Con
gress and presented to the President for
his signature "Wednesday night. The
constitution of the United States provides
that if sucli a bill be not returned by the
President within ton days after presenta
tion to him it shall become a law, as if he
had signed it, unless Congress by iis ad
journment prevents its return, in which
case it shall be a law.
Attorney W. R- Davis has expressed an
opinion that the failure ot President
Cleveland :o sign the bill <s equivalent to
a pocket veto ana he says that it is rea
sonably certain that the appropriation is
lost to Oakland at this time.
Congressman Hilborn ha* written a let
ter 10 some frienaa in Oakland in which
he gives much of tiie unwritten history of
the struggle to get the appropriation bill
through Congress. He outlines tne objec
tions ihet had to be met, and incidentally
shows that it is a matterof great difficulty
to push an appropriation to a successful
termination.
Mr. Hilborn, according to a dispatch re
j ceived this evening, has already begun
I work am on.' tiie members of the new
House, and lie i? confident that although
I tne biil 13 practically vetoed the chances j
j for the success of the improvements in ibe j
harbor are really better than ever. He j
says with the new Congress that there will ;
undoubtedly be a raising of the limit on i
the cost of the appropriation to the figure i
set by Engineer Sutter. Under these cir
cumstances Mr. Hilborn explains that
harbor matters are really iv a better con
dition than if Mr. Cleveland had signed
the original bill.
A Importer Officially Thanked.
OAKLAND. Cal., March s.â Tbe work

People's Party Delegates in a Row
Over the Candidates for the
Office of Marshal.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 5. â The
Populist convention in Sisterna Hall last
night resulted in a bitter row, of which
the end is not yet, and growing out of it
are charges of political jobbery made by
Marshal Lloyd against his opponent for
re-election, George Schmidt., The con
vention nominated Schmidt for the office
after a long and bitter wrangle and ex
change of personalities.
The charges of intoxication while on
duty made by Saloon-Keeper Unda against
Lloyd were repeated by Samuel Fisher,
and N. T. Whiting, ex-Trustee of Ward 3,
made Â» bitter assault upon George
Schmidt.
Lloyd then startled the delegates by
telling them their convention was a
stuffed one and announcing that he
didn't want their nomination.
The delegates then made Schmidt the
nominee of their party.
The rest of the ticket named by the ;
Populists is as follows: Town Clerk,
George H. Wriprht; Assessor, Isaac Wells;
Treasurer, R. W. Good. Trusteesâ Ward

The names of M. L. Hanscom and J.
T. Sherrett, Non-Panisan and Republican
candidates for Town Clerk, were presented
to the convention, but each declared him
self a Republican and unable to indorse
the People's party platform.
The platform adopted is a lengthy one.
It declares th- principles of the Omaha
Populist platform of 1892. A reduction of
the number and of the salaries of public
officers is demanded, and also the cessa
tion of all censorship over literature
donated to the public libraries.

Large Audience
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. )
The Tabernacle was filled to-night with
Republicans who were anxious to welcome
Captain Thomas, the nominee for Mayor,
who had been announced as one of the
speakers of the evening, and to celebrate
the inauguration of President McKinley.
HON. "W. R. DAVIS, President of the Inaugural Celebration.
Ex-Mayor W. R. Davis called the meet
ing to order, and asked if the weather
made it chill and untoward for Kepubli
cans inside the tabernacle, what must it
be on the outsi'le for the Democrats? If
we are not happy to-night, what must be
the condition of the other six minion of
American electors?
"Mr. Cleveland, who is a great man in
one resnect, has gone out of office and we
hail a change. To-day there are very few
great men. Very few men are great and
none are so unless they represent a sys
tem. The change of a few men at Wash
ington does not cut so much of a figure as
the change of system and theory of j
the Government. But, although a change, I
we Know thai every citizen is always will
ing to uphold the administration so
long as it is in power. The American peo
ple are wonderfully loyal, and all are
ready to uphold their Government where
it is necessary, irrespective of party.
"We know that we can trust the present
administration. A few months ago we
worked ior It and fought for its principals
almost as bitterly as if it were a physical
matter. The case went to t: c jury or 70,
--000,000 and as a result all the American
Nation is congratulating itself that Major
McKinley is now President.
"The man who has just gone out of
office did not have the decency to sign the
bill that would guarantees fund for im
proving Oakland harbor j\nd the small
ness of this act is typical of the man's
whole career. Now, I want to say why
the candidates who will speak to-night
are worthy of support. They represent
the same principles that are represented
by President McKinley and what is pood
for the Nation as a whole is good lor the
States, counties and cities."
During Mr. Davis' speech Captain W.
R. Thomas entered the hall and the audi
ence rose to receive him while the band
struck up a lively air. This is the first
time Captain Thomas has been able to
leave his home during the campaign.
Captain W. R. Thomas, who was very
cordially received, said:
"There is one pull stronger than the
political pull, and that is the pull of the
grip. I want first to rejo:ce with you over
the seating of Major McKinley. The
country is safe, and just an certainly as
Oakland is a small part of this Republic it
will also be safe when the Republican
candidates are elected next Monday. I
am not here to electioneer, because you
have all made ud your minds how to vote.
I want to thank you for your kindness,
and especially those Republicans who
have worked for me.
"I know that the Board of Works, with
Wilson and Dow and the other fellow,
will be *afe and we will at least be on
speaking terms. If there ara any pin
heads on the board it will be tne other
fellows. 1 am not going to make a
speech, because I am physically unab'.e,
but I promise that after I am elected on
Monday, as i shall be, I shall do mr duty
irrespective of sect, religion or politics."
The Reliance Glee Club followed with a
couple of glees.
Auditor Snow was the next speaker.
His speech was a carefully prepared
document, showing the cost of the city
government. It was a brief synopsis of
his annual report, which has already been
published in this paper. As a result of
his experience he said that the city pov
ernme:it, under the present charter and
existing laws, cannot be properly gov
erned at a saving of more than $10,000
from which it costs now. He said that n
consolidated city and county government
must follow if economy is to be followed
and the territory north of tho city is to
be annexed. If the parks nre not to be
improved by tne city they had better be
turned over to the local improvement
clubs. He predicted that no one will ba
elected next Monday who has not pledged
himself to continue the suits to recover
the water fronts.
J. E. Farnum made a speech, in which
he said tnat it was a great pity the ideas
of Mr. Bnow had not been placed in pam
phlet form and put in the hands of i very
voter in tha city. The speaker contrasted
Oakland with Los Angeles, and said that
in the southern pan of the State they did
not fight for years over a few cents on the
tax levy, but they went to work with a
will to" beauty their city. Others wbo
spoke were D. Edward Collins, A. R. Wil
son W. D. Heitman, H. C. Cuvelier. W.

DAVIE EXPLAINS.
Says He Has Not ,Ke ceded From His
Water Front Position.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: My position in
regard to the water front being so well
known to the people of this city I never
thought it was necessary to define my
policy In that regard. Having been as
sailed through the columns of the San
Francisco Examiner and my motives
questioned I take this means of reaffirm
ing my policy, which as a citizen I inau
gurated, in regard to regaining possession
of the water front and creating it from the
srrasp of a corporation that has no ri ht or
tit ie to it.
I have expended a small fortnno, my
own personal means, in bringing to an
issue the question of the water front
ownership. Tins fact is known, or ought
to tie, to every citizen who has kept track
of events. Again, with a few associates
1 entered into active competition with the
Southern Pacific Company in the ferry
business and inaugurated the 5-cent rate
and reduced the freight tariff between
this city and San Francisco, which com
pelled that corporation to reduce us
rates, with the result, that the people of
this city are saving $1000 per day ana that
corporation is suffering a loss to that ex
tent.
I am now as I have been opposed to the
unjust encroachments of the Southern
Pacific Company as well a- any other
corporation, and I again affirm that 1 will
lend my every aid to pain the repossession
of the waier front and push the suits to
the court of last resort so that the city
will regain its own.
It appears to me that no man can offer
more evidence of his sincerity in this mat
ter than 1 hay? , and I trust that my efforts
in the pnst are recognized and appreciated
by a community that I have ÃBed my best
efforts to aid in its struggles against corpo
rate aggression.
I have not utilized the water-front ques
tion as a campaign issue to further my
own personal aims. The cases have been
tried "and submitted in the courts of this
county and judgment rendered m favor of
the city of Oakland, myself and associates,
and appealed by the defendants tc the Su
preme Court of this State, where they have
been finally submitted, and we are now
awaiting a decision. If the judgment of
that tribunal should be unfavorable to this
city I will continue to carry the litigation
to the Supreme Court of the United States.
My past record in this regard and my pres
ent attitude are surely a sufficient guar
anty to the people of this city wi at my
. future policy will tn concerning the de
â fense of the Oakland water front.

GOOD GOVEKNMENT PRIMABIES.
Preparation* All Completed and an
Interesting I line Expected.
ALA M EDA, Cal., March s.â The prep
arations for the primaries of the Good
government Club are all complete and an
interesting time is expected to-morrow
afternoon and evening. The polls will be
opened at Linderman's Opera-house from
2 to 8:30 p. M., the late hour for dosing
having been selected so as to afford tne
many members of the club who are en
gaged in business in Ban Francisco ample
time to attend and cast their ballots. It
has been very amusing to note the change
in the altitude of a great many politicians
with regard to this club. At first they
affected to despise it, but as soon as it was
developed that it had a powerful element
behind it and that its favorites were likely
to win at the election they lost no time in
trying to make peace with it. As its
name implies, this club is strictly non
partisan and is seeking nothing but the
best men for the various offices to be filled.
At this writing it seems altogether prob
able that its ticket , will be the successful
one in April. I . 7" '. â¢?,

The executive committee comprises in its

applying the local option idea to different
portions of the city. Alameda now has
only twenty-three saloons, which are re
quired to pay an annual 1 license of $500
each, and the Trustees have refused to
license any more. They are not allowed
to keep open after midnight, and the fact
that during the whole of last month there
was only one arrest for drunkenness shows
that the liquor business is far from being

DECEASE OF
GEORGE WYMAN
Once a Successful Man,
Now a Wreck at the
Hospital.
Many Years Ago He Was a
Prominent Politician, and
Once Twd Men.
Ho Tells a Story of the Time Wlrn
H Wis Suppos?d to be Doal
Three Days.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 5. f
Geoive Wyraan, who has figured more
in the history of Alameda County the
past thirty years than the average man,
was taken to the Receiving Hospiial to
day, a complete wreck. He is suffering
from dropsy and other ailments, all of
which have been induced by general dis
sipation and morphine.
Twenty years ago George Wyman was
one of the foremost men in this city.
When he first came Â«.o Oakland he ran a
stage line, and a few years later bought a
roadside house in Temescal. While at
thi3 place he was greatly annoyed by a
crowd of toughs called the "800 pang,"
and during a fracas he sliot two of them
and afterward was made a policeman.
For a long while he was a prominent
politician, and his business enterprises
flourished moderately weli. Some time
ago he received an allowance lrom an
estate, but the fund was shut off and he
was compelled to *eek alms of the county.
He is now in a destitute and wrecked con
dition, and should he leave the hospital it
will be to go to the infirmary.
Tills afternoon Wyman told a most re
markable story. He went to the inn'rmary
ten years ago to-day, and died, according
to all ordinary precedents. For tbfee
days he lay in a trance ami heard the ar
rangements made for his funeral. He
knew his death notice had been pub
lished, he heard his relatives mourn by
his side, but was unab'e to move. His
body was prepared for burial, but just as
it was being placed in the coffin power to
move returned.
"it was just ten years ago to-day that I
was taken to the infirmary," saia Wyman
this alternoon. "At that time I weighed
200 and was something ot an athlete. One
of my tricks was lifting heavy weights
with my teeth. One day I overdid it. I
felt my neck snap and dropped the weight,
but it did no good.
"My knee? cave way and I fell to the
floor, and they took me to tba infirmary.
I got no better, and one day found myself
unable to move. The nurse looked at me
and remarked that it was all up with
G> orge. He sent for the doctor, who pro
nounced me dead. This did not worry
me much, for I was quite conscious but
absolutely powerless to control a nerve or
muscle. My relatives cried by my bed
side, and I heard them tain of my death
notice in the papers. I knew when I bsi
carried to thÂ« deadroom and was placed
on a. slab with a sheet thrown over me.
There was another corpse in the room,
because I heard the attendants speak of
him. Some of my political friends came
10 take a last look at me, and I heard one
of them say, 'Fix him up good and we
will pay for the funeral.'
"They left and the attendants fixed me
tip. They washed my body in cold water,
combed my hair and put a clean sheet
over me. Then I began to worry. At last
they came with the coffin and placed it
beside the slab. One man took hold of
my feet and a fellow named Clark took
hold of my hÂ«>ad. Just as they lifted me
up I was enabled to open my eyes and
look the fellow straight to the face, and it
almost made me Liugh to see how quickly
they dropped me and ran."
The chances cf recovery are against
Wyman, and unless there is a speedy
change the doctors do not prophesy much
more of life for the patient
Two Draws Before the Kellance.
OAKLAND, Cal., March s.â At the Re
liance Club to-night the two contests wero
drawn. Mike McCormack and Harry
Woods fought eight rounds, which ended
in a draw, and the fight between Ned
O'Malia and Charles Goff ended in the
same manner. Both contests were spir
ited, with the honors about evenly divided.
FAINTED ON THE CLEATS.
The Norwegian Team Defeated
the French Alter a Dasper
ate Struggle
The Canadians Gavj the Swedish
Team an Unexpected
Surprise.
The rain again kept many people away
from the opening events of the tug-of-war
tournament at the Mechanics' Pavilion
last nieht, but many witnessed the two
last pulls of the evening.
The Iri9h and Italian teams opened, and
the Irish team won in 5 mm. 22J^ sec.
The betting whs $5 to $1 on Ireland and
Italian money was scarce.
The next event was between Germany
and Denmark, and the pull was won by
the Danes in 1 mm. 4% sec. The pools
sold in favor of the Danes at $3 to $1. The
German team attributed its defeat to a
new anchorman, who did not understand
the ropes.
Wituout any question the best and
most exciting tug of the tournament was
the one between the French and Norwe
gian teams. The spectators went wild
with excitement a 9 the teams struggled to
gain an advantage. Big beads of perspi
ration rolled off the contestants as they
strained every nerve and muscle. Tne
French first gained a few cleats, but the
Norwegians won the ground back, only to
lose several more cleats to tho French,
which team finally got the indicator half
way along the stick.
Then there was a seesawing and neither
team could score an inch. The contest
ants pulled like Trojans and after twenty
minutes of the hardest kind of pulling the
men from NorVay managed to get the in
dicator bick to its old position. The
cheering was deafening. The struggle at
this juncture was desperate and inch by
Inch the French pained ground until the
dial again was drawn half way into the
French territory.
The spectators were on tiptoe of excite
ment and the contestants were in a lather
of perspiration. "Go ir, France 1" "Pull,
Norway !" were the entreaties of tho spec
tators, who had now worked themselves
into a fever of excitement. The French
men had wagered a large sum of money
on the result, and it was do or die with
thorn. Two of the French team finally
cave out, and the Norwegians getting
them off their guard made one mighty
effort and succeeded in getting, the mdi- [
cator moving, and away it went until it j
struck the winning stick .on 1 the . Nor- j
wegjan side. Time, 36 mm. 42 sec. .\ ; .
Three of the French ' team and two of
the Norwegian team fell prostrate on the
cleats from exhaustion when the .'judge's
pistol sounded the finish. Tl:e batting
was 10 to 4 in favor of the Norwegians.
The sports looked for* another hard
strui-gle when the Swedish and Canadian
teams took 1 their respective . positions on J
the 'cleats; [ The pools sold 10 to 6 with the
Canadians on the long end..
The fact that the Canadians were such
strong favorites against the successful
Swede? meant that something out of the
ordinary was going to happen. The Cana
dians had their original anchorman, At
kinson, in harness. .. r . , â 
The Canadians were first to gain a few
cleats, and they pulled like demons from \
the crac!-: of tie pistol. The indicator i
went with them and they won the contest I
in 2 mm. 24 sec. The . Swede.3 were given
a surprise, as the Canadian anchorman
did actually try to win. He said that, al
though he was a little bit late, ho was
still in th<Â» swim.
' The last event was a struggle between
the United States and Scottish teams.
The Americans won an easy victory in 3
mm. 19 sec. . â.:.

GUNST BOYCOTTED.
Trades and Labor Alliance Declares
Against Tenement-Made Cigars.
At the regular meeting of the Trades
and Labor Alliance last night the follow
ing preamble and resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
Whereas, The San Francisco Trades and
Labor Alliance is authoritatively informed
that the cigars manufactured by the firm of
Krebs. Wertheimer <S: Schiffer oi New York
and Pennsylvania are made by non-union
labor in filthy tenement-houses, at a rate
of pay that forbids the employment of
union labor at living wages; and,
whereas, many thousands of these
cheap tenement cigars are dealt in
by San Francisco dealersâ chief among whom
is Moses Gunst, a known enemy of union la
bor â who inus, for a few cents additional profit
on a cheaply made article of doubtful quality
and cleanliness, are willing to take the bread
from the mouths of competent San Francisco
cigar-makers, wtio, by their purchases, when
employed, assist local trade and otherwise
contribute to the welfare of this community ;
therefore be It

MUDLARKS WERE
IN GREAT FETTLE
Five Out of Seven Favor
ites Captured Purses
Yesterday.
Argentina Captured the Mile and
a Half Run From Mort?
Fonse.
Folix Carr's Montgomery Beat Yemen
in a Driveâ Cash Day Led
Oat Applause.
The web-footed horses were very much
in favor, and the crowd that weathered
the rain and the cold biting breezes and
visited Ingleside track yesterday enjoyed
a profitable if not a pleasant day of It.
The card consisted of aeven events at vari
ous distances, and the favored ones in the
betting captured five of them. The bet
ting-ring was well fiiled with spectators
and the betting was sharp and lively for
what is generally considered a dull day at
racetracks.
As usual interest centered mostly in the
mile and a half, with a field of four facing
the issue. The Baldwin entry Argentina
had first call in the betting, but she was
by no means a popuiar choice. Loben
gula, ridden by Willie Martin, was
pounded down from 11 to 5 to 8 to 5, but
it proved an unwise move, for he could
not raise a gallop in the slushy going.
The favorite made the pace from the out
set, and although showing unmistakable
signs of slopping at the end lasted long
enough to beat the fast-coming Morte
Fonse a short length in 2:41%.
Dan Honig's mare Lizzie H, backed
down from 5 to 2 to 6 to 5, proved the good
thing in the ouening six-furlong purse
event. She was away from the post tirst,
and leading throughout won easily from
Treachery, which, coupled with Tulare,
ruled second choice in the bettin*. The
latter horse was successful in getting the
â¢how.
The black mare Hermanita commanded
substantial backing to win the seven-fur
long selling run that was next decided,
gome to the post a 7 to 5 favorite. She
was minus speed to a noticeable extent,
failing to get within the money. San
Marco, at odds of 9 to 2, was nearly
always in front, and in a drive Hennessy
got him past the stand half a length in
advance of Doctor G, whieti was the con
tending horse from the start. Tar and
Tartar was third, Deaien but a nose for
the place.
The grand old crippie Cash Day acquit
ted himself nobly in ihe third event over j
six furlongs. Carmicnael's horse was |
chalked up a 4 to 5 chance, but so much j
coin went in around post lime on Ap- â 
plause, forcing the odds against the mare !
from 7to 5 to 11 to 10, ti.at 9to 10 was
laid against Cash Day. Purser's mare
outbroke her neltl, and led to the paddock,
vvuere the favorite got up an>i downed her
a bead in 1:16%. Tuxedo finished third
at 7 to 1 lor mat position.
Several good sprinters with a decided
penchant for slusliy going faced the bar- |
rier in the fifth event at seven furlongs,
and there was no decided favorite in the
betting, Gutta Porcha, Mob&iasfca and
Frank X all being quoted at 16 to 5 by the
layers of odds.
The first-named man 1 appeared to have
the footing over her held, for showing the
way throughout, she finished over a length
in front of Frank K. Mobalatka, atone
time in second position, dropped back in
the stretch, ending up in third place.
Owner Pat Dunne's unlucky colt Sten
tor finally played in beiter luck and took

hollow fashion. Going to the post a 9 to
10 favorite, he had little difficulty in lead
ing the company pitted against him. win
ing easily from Basquil. George Palmer
was a close third.
The crack Magnet was scratched out of
the final rive-furlong spin, leaving Yemen
to s'art for the post a 9 to 10 chance. The
favorite soon headed Fly and Montgomery
into the stretch by half a length. The
latter horse, though, eot a great hustle on,
and in a hot drive got the verdict by a
nose.
CLOSING HAY AT INGI.ESIDE.
A Tery Attractive Card of Klght. KventÃ
Down for Decisionâ Fait Sprint
ers to Meet.
The card at Ingleside to-day has a most
inviting look. Eight events arc down for
decision, among them the Crocker stake
for two-year-olds. The mile special, bring
ing together Magnet. David, Libertine and
Damien, is a rare good attraction, and will
undoubtedly draw a large crowd. Each
one of the sprinters named is possessed of
speed to burn, and some great mud-splash
inc will be indulged in when they line up.
Montgomery carried the colors of Felix
Carr, and alter the race Felix was warmly
congratulated by his employer â Barney
Bchreiber â on his maiden win as a horse
owner.
Bookmaker Sam Summerfield held
Montgomery out in his boos and backed
nim enough on the outside to cash $800
worth ot tickets.
Sam Doggett appears to be in hard luck
all around. He had the mount on Fly in
the last race and just as the barrier fl-w
up the !>printer stumbled, interfering with
his strid > considerably.
It seemed as though the ring took un
due liberties with the odds about Babe
Murphy, but then as a rtfle bookmakers
ure a shrewd class of men, and they may
have heard something from Babe's in
dulgent parents. She has always been a
naughty girl at time?.
There was a hot tip circulated on
Peixotto, but it would have taken a barrel
of coin to cut his oilds, for notwithstand
ing the stiff play on the fast sprinter they
steadily lengthened out.

Intnrent on Prohatn Claim*.
Judge Coffey and Judge Slack, both of whom
are constantly considering matters of probate ,
jurisdiction, have concurred in the opinion !
that a claim against an estate can bear only i
the legal rate of interest after the date of its
allowance until paid, even though the origi
nal contract called for a higher rate of inter
est. It is added that If the approval of the
clnim ttiioiild be signified before it is due that
fact would not .-:ffect the original rate of in

date of its maturity.

BEAT AN AGED
MAN TO DEATH
Bruggy Defended His Char
acter in a Horrible
Manner.
His Friend Stcod By and
Watched the Brutal
Crime.
Because the Old Man Called Him a
Loafer He Killed Him in
Cold Blood.
William Brugge because he took excep
tion 10 remarks which he considered de
rogatory to his character beat a man 60
years of age to ttie ground and then with
the fury of a wild beast stamped find
kicked his prostrate victim until life was
extinct
The disgusting tragedy occurred in the
Enterprise saloon, a little grocery at the
corner of Fremont and Brannan streets.
It is right next to the water and is one of
the worst of the water-front resorts. The
victim of the outrage is a German cook,
who is Known only as Louis.
Brugga and a man named Hans Al-
Oertson entered the saloon yesterday
ftltemoon about 4 o'clock, and the former
immediately began to make troubie. He
accused Louis, who is employed at the
saloon, of having accused him of being a
iree-lunch loafer and a hard game gener
ally. He was also accused of having been
the cause of Adolf Aurich, a former bar
keeper and a friend of Brugge, having
Jost his job.
According to the story of John Hoepi
ner, who whs in charge of the saloon,
Louis denied the charges, whereupon j
Brugge gave him the lie and commenced
striking him in the face. Hoepfner, who
is an old man, ran to the assailant and
started to catch his arm.
"Let them fight," cried Albertson, pull-
Ing the would-be peacemaker aside. Then
Louis fell to the ground, and Brugge, his
â wrath still unsatisfied, grasped the man
by the back and jammed him forcibly to
the floor several times.
Then he kicked him viciously in the
side. The old man did not stir and the
two men, Bruege and Albertson, walked
out, leaving Louis lying quiet on the
floor.
Hoepfner immediately summoned Offi
cer Gus Videau, but by the time the po
liceman arrived Louis was dead and
Brugge and Albertson had disappeared.
The body of Louis was taken to the
Morgue. A partial examination showed
that his skull was fractured and the left
leg and collarbone were broken.
Brugge, Albertson and Aurich. the man
whom Brugge said Louis deprived of a
jod, were all arrested last night.
Aurieh is held merely as a witness, as
he is thought to know "something of the
nature of the crime. Brugge is charged
with murder. Albertson has not "yet
been charged, but a complaint (or mur
der as accessory may be made against
him. Brugne, who is about 40 years of
age, says he is a mining man. and has
been here only about a year. He says he
lived in Australia for fourteen years. To
Detective Reynolds he admitted he struck
Louis, giving as an excuse that Louis
called him a vile name.
FRAWLEY COMPANY.
Many of the Old Members to Be Ile
tained in the Ntw
Company.
In spite of ali the rumors to the con- i
trary, Phosa McAllister and Harry Car- !
son Clark will remain with Frawley for j
the coming season. Miss McAllister was
the first one to be re-engaeed. Blanche
Bates will be the leading lady and among !
the others will be Madge Carr Cook, Wi!- |
Bon Enos and Georee Bosworth. Mr. j
Dufiield will resume his old position with j
the company. If Frank Worthing returns !
to America he will piay with the company.
There is, However, some doubt on that
question as Mr. Worthing has been cor
responding with the manager of a promi
nent London theater, whom he left to
join the Daly forces.
This season the tour will be extended as
far_as Chicago and if the Chicagoans take j
T. Daniel to their hearts as tbe San Fran
cisco people have done, it will not be long
before Frawley will realize his ambition
and take a San Francisco company to New
York. They open here on May 31 and
play into September.

EIGHTS OF SAILORS.
Judge Bahrs Decides That Si) vicra Is i
Kntitled to Damages.
Judge Bahrs has given judgment in ,
favor of Sailor Silviera and against Iver- j
son and other.-', owners of tne vessel known
as the Ocean Spray, for $2000 damages.
Silviera was an able seaman aboard tbe
Ocean Spray, and while at work reefing
the mainsail the reef pennant broke, caus
ing him to be thrown to the deck. His
shoulder was broken, and he was incapaci- {
tated for work.
When he sued foi damages the owners
of the vessel replied that no sailor had:
ever before brought such an action, and i
they moved for a dismissal on the ground !
that it was contrary to the usages of the
business to consider such a claim as that.
Attorney P. J. Castlehun replied that
the fact that no sailor hitherto had suffi
cient temerity to institute a proceeding
for the enforcement of his rights ought to
preclude the plaintiff in this case Irom the
law's protection.
Judge Bahrs refused to entertain the
motion for a non-suit, and after hearing
the testimony reached tlie conclusion that
the outfitting of the ship waa defective,
that the owners were liable and that the
plaintiff was entitled to $2000 damages on
accoantof the injuries received.

MURDERER JOHN MILLER, Who Was Convicted Yesterday
and Will Ec Sentenced to Death.
A BABY GIRL IN
THE CITY PRISON
Effie Holstrom Suffers Be
cause She Has Two
Mothers.
Unable to Agree Upon a Cus
todian for the Unfortunate
Little One.
Judge Coffey Admonishes the Contest
ants That the Child's Interests
Are Suffering.
Little Effie V. R. Holstrom was in Judge
Coffey's court a<;ain yesterday. She ap
peared in her Â«ailor boy's suit, the same
as on Wednesday, and when asked her
name replied that it was Tommy, just as
she did when first presented at court. She
appeared to be suffering from nervous
ness, and was not as bright looking as be
fore. Attorney Eugene Deuprey asked
that the child be given into the custody
of Mrs. I. C. Leonora Barron of 1334 Va
lencia street.
To this suggestion Attorney Matt I. Sul
livan, representing the mother, offered
opposition, saying that Mrs. Barron is a
partisan and friend of Mrs. Holstrom, the
foster-mother of the child.
Mr. Deuprey objected to Mrs. Dr.
Thrasher advising the attorney for the
mother of the child, Mrs. d'Artnay. He
thought only those in interest ought to be
allowed to control or parlicipate in the
i proceedings.
Judge Coffey said it was apparent to him
that Mrs. Barron is a good woman and a
proper person to act as mother pro tern.
or the third mother for this little bit of
humanity. He was not disposed to hasti
ly decide a matter that might be of ini
portance to both sides of the controversy,
â  and would remand the child to the cus
i tody of thÂ« matron of the City Prison un
j til 2 o'clocK to-day. If at that time no
other person is agreed on as custodian of
! the child, he will put her in the keeping rf
I Mrs. Barron.
Both mothers were present in court,
and both followed Bailiff Finn to the
City Prison, where the pretty little waif
was given ovjr to the matron, who is a
gen He but very busy woman.
Mrs. Holstrom, the foster-mother, wept
over the child and tbe baby clung to her
affectionately, begging 10 be taken home.
Mrs. d'Armay, the mother of the child,
stood aloof, but wore a determinea look
that showed that she was not disposed to
yield the point in controversy. She was
accompanied by her husband, a eentleman
of respectable appearance, wl>o manifested
much interest in f c case. Mr. d'Artnay
says he will stand by his wile in her claim
for her offspring, even though it was born
out of wedlock.
When tie City Prison's matron took
hold of Effie the little thing drew back
impulsively and cried : "Don't put me in
that room again. Somebody come with
me. Don't put me in alone again."
The door was opened disclosing two
dark-looking candidates for the Magdalen
Asylum, with the mark of sorrow and dis
grace on their low brows.
"Go in and see yourgirls,*' said tae busy
matron, kindly but firmly.
"No, no; let me go home with mamma,"
walled the infant, but a baby's cries avail
not in a prison, *o the door was pushed
shut and another child of misfortune was
left alone with her roitows. Those who
stood outside could hear the little one's
heartbroken sobbings, until a party of
tourists were escorted into the jail to see
iJutler, nlias Wellcr, the Australian mur
derer, who has quarters just across the
corridor. The shuffling feet of the new
comers, the cheery prattle of the double
murderer and the dreadful rattling of the
keys drowned tne sounds of sorrow in the
matron's room, both mothers had been
escorted out, and the incident was forgot
ten by the habitues of the jail.
Judge (Joffey took occasion to admonish
both sides of the controversy. He said
that in their partisanship and in their
selfish desire and strenuous efforts to get
possession of the child they had forgotten
its real interests. He thought they ought
to be morr. tender of its feeiings and its
welfare. Finally he said that his depart
ment was overcrowded with important
matters and said he hoped they would find
some other Judge to hear and decide the
question between tne two mothers as to
which should have the custody of the
ciiild. The matter will come up again
beiore Judge Coffey at 2 o'clock this after
noon. .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 6, 1897.
OAKLEY'S BAGGAGE
WAS IN COURT
It Came There in Response
to a Search War
rant.
Manager Kirkpatrick and Cor
oner Hawkins Battled for
Custody.
Attorneys Grew Heated mJ Indulged
in Personalities â D cision
Expected To- Day.
A legal battle royal took place in Jus
tice of the Peace Barry's court yesterday
between the Coroner and the manager of
the Palace Hotel, Mr. Kirkpatrick, over
the search warrant upon which the effects
of John M. Oakley were seized. The most
of the facts in the case were not disputed.
The Coroner alleged that the Palace Ho
tel people had refused to permit him, by
deputy, to see or have access to Oakley's
effects, and that Oakley's trunk and valise
would have been shipped out of town, at
the direciion of the -'Countess Espanola,"
had not the search warrant prevented.
The Coroner also set up by witnesses
that the body of Oakley was removed
from the Palace Hotel to an undertaker's
before a death certificate had be n issued.
Manager Kirkpatrirk and Assistant Mana
ger Warren of the Palace Hotel explained
some leatures of the case at the sugges
tion of their attorneys. They claimed to
have peen always willing to produce the
property upon tbe service of subpenas.
Tne greatest difference of testimony oc
curred over tbe dispatch sent by "Coun
tess Espanola" after she left the City.
Mr. Kirkpatrick testified that he had not
told the Coroner that the "Countess" had
telegraphed to him to eend on the bag
gage, and that he would have sent it had
it not been for the search warrant. Joseph
K. Hawkins testified directly in opposi
tion to th:s. Attorney Lennon, who ap
peared for Coroner Hawkins, wished to be
sworn aÂ« a witness to testify that he nad
heard Mr. Kirkpatrick make this state
ment and so did Coroner Hawkins, but
Attorney Dunne said that he was willing
to admit that they would so testify.
During the hearing Oakley's trunk and
vanse were brought into the courtroom,
and it was proposed to open them that an
inventory might be made of their con
tent?. Coroner Hawkins testified that he
believed tnat an inspection of the con
tents might assist (n determining the
cause of Oakley's dea\h. They were not
opened up. Deputy Coroner McCormicfc,
Dr. George 11. Martin and the others
named testified.
During the arguments Justice Barry in
terposed to suggest that if the Palace
Hotel manager would give up the prop

Attorney Lennon stood up for the pre
rogatives of the Coroner and incidentally
remarked: "If a murderer should say that
he would not do ao aeain."
Attorney Allen's ire kindled. He ap
peared for the Sharon estate. "There are
some gentlemen in the world," he said,
glancing angrily at Lennon.
"What do you mean by that?" de
manded Lennon.
Justice JJarry quieted the enraged attor
neys, but after the luaring was over At
torney Lennon leaned angrily over toward
Attorney Alien nnd demanded, "What
d'd you mean by your remark about
gentlemen?"
Attorney Dunne interposed and there
were no more anury words.

OVERCOME BY GAS.
How John Wulbern Died at HU Home
on Filbert Street.
John Wnlbarn, aged 55 years, died at his
home, 1900 Filbert street, on Thursday
evening from asphyxiation. Wulbern
kept a cigar-store on Washington and
Davis streets for several years, but was
compelled some time a^o to sell it on ac
count of ill health. He was given a posi
tion by Assessor Siebe as a special deputy,
but the work was evidently too niucn for
him.
It is supposed that feeling ill during the
night he got up and lit the gas and was
overtaken by a fainting spell before he
could apply the match, and was overcome
by the gas before he recovered conscious
ness. The deceased leaves a family of
grown-up children. The Coroner has
taken charge of the reruaina.
MURDERER MILLER
MUST SURELY HANG
Declared Guilty of Murder
in the First
Degree.
Judge Carroll Cook Will Pro
nounc3 the Death
Penalty.
Dastardly Crime of a Jealous Man.
Shot Down a Stranger on
ihe Street.
John Miller, who killed James Childa in
this City on the 18th of last November,
was yesterday declared guilty of muruer
in the first degree, and as the jur3 r failed
to recommend life imprisonment the
death penalty will be imposed.
The trial occupied the entire week in
Judge Carroll Cook's department of the
Superior Court, a determined battle being
made by Attorney J. N. E. Wilson to save
his client's neck on the ground of insanity.
Deputy District Attorney Hosmer con
ducted the case for the Slate, and suc
ceeded in convincing the jury that even
though Miller might be lacking in some of
the attributes of an altogether intelligent
man, yet he was capable of judging be
tween right and wrong and ought to be
held responsible lor his murderous act.
Tee story of the killing is brief and
squalid.
Miller, who is a hunchback, had been
intimate with a woman named Nellie
Ryan, and becoming jealous of her he
sought to murder her. Meeting her on
Clementina street, near Fifth, he drew a
revolver and attempted to kill her. One
bullet passed through her hat and came
within an eighth of an inch of her m-.ul p.
She shrieked for help, and Mr. Childa,
who happened 10 be passing, stepped be
tween them. He was a stranger to both,
and only acted on the impulse of Human
ity in seeking to protect a helpless woman
from the attacks of an enraged brute, wlio,
though deformed in body, is possessed of
great phy>ical strength.
When Miller saw that his murderous in
tent was balked, he turned like a savage
beast on the generous intruder and de
liberately shot him to death in front of
400 Clementina street. Not satisfied with
inflicting what was evidently a faial
wound, Miller stood over his victim and
emptied into his body the contents of his
pisiol.
When he knew that the cartridges in
the pistol were entirely exhausted Stiller
turned the muzzle against his own throat
and snapped the hammer, but tie was safe
in doing so, for the weapon was harmless.
\N hen arrested Miller denied having
shot the man, saying he did not know
him, but remarked that he pursued the
woman because she had failed" to keep her
promise to him and had bestowed her
smiles on others.
The following- named citizens were im
paneled as jurors: Theodore L. Hall. J.
Bremen P. H. Englebert, A. Armstrong,
F. W. Kattleman, George Lake, G. Sohind
ler, James Phillips, Henry Larsen, John
.Noonan, J. W. McCormick, Jacob Loh
man.
After Miller's arrest the wife whom he
had deserted for two yssrs returned to his
side and did everything in her power to
save him from the teirible obloquy and
penalty o: tbe scaffold. Sne sat by his
side through the long, tedious trial and
by words and smiles endeavored to De
guile the prisoner irom a contemplation
of the droadiul consequences of his awful
deed. He accepted her sacrifices and lov
ing ministrations much as a wooden Chi
nese joss might accept the adoration of
fered by a tong of highbinders.
The jurors were out five hours and when
they came in it was scarcely expected that
they had agreed. Yet when ihe verdict
was read by Clerk Tolle the least inter
ested person in the couitroorn, so far as
could be judged by appearances, was the
condemned felon at the bar. His faithful
wife, however, manifested her emotions,
for despite ail that she has suffered she
still Keeps sacred the love and affection
consecrated by her to this man at the
bridal altar.
Judge Cook will pass sentence of death
on the prisoner on the 13th inst.
BUILDING OP SOCIETY-
A General Weeding Out of Poor Social
; . . -.-.V.'. Material Suggested.
The large auditorium of the Turk-street
Temple was tilled last Wednesday night at
the mass-meeting held by the ; Liberty
Branch of the Socialist Labor party to
hear the views of H. H. Powers, a profes
sor of economics in Stanford University,
on "The Building of Society." The lect
ure of the evening was preceded by a
select reading by Secretary ; Theodore
Lynch ana a violin and piano solo by Pro
fessor Ohiappey and Mr. Fitzgerald, which
were well received."* The professor claimed
that it was utterly impossible to assimi
late in any harmonious combination the
idle,* vicious and depraved members of so
ciety, and while admitting that a social
istic state was inevitable in the near fu
ture claimed that the requisite auxiliaries
to a permanent solution of vexed social
questions would be hampered by â  the
amount of insufficient good material
available for the setting up of a social
order that would be durable without a
weeding out or destruction â¢of the perni
cious elements in the social organisms.
The speaker, after a brilliant discourse,
which lasted one hour and thirty minutes,
was taken to task vigorously by several of
the speakers who followed in the discus
sion of : the evening, including Leo Gasser,
George Aspden, Dr. J. D. Brock and M.
W. Wilkins, the litter, as well as Rev. J.
E. Scott and Theodore Lynch, claiming
that the speaker's views were entirely at
variance with the humanitarian and ethi
cal features of socialism.
Professor Powers closed in a lengthy .
and clever defence of his position, during
which he avowed his willingness to be
come a member at once of a colony based
on the fundamentals of co-operation and
challenged the socialists ; presont to mani
fest as liberal a spirit of tolerance to pro
fessionals as himself and his colleagues
ol Stanford, who had already invited lead
ing socialist speaker* to address the stu
dents, piomising no interruption or dis
play of feeling on the part of their
audiences. He closed by paying a tribute
to the learning and integrity of the expo
nents of socialism, Karl Marx, Engels and
William Morris.
The meeting closed after the announce
ment by the chair- of an address by Rev.
William Hall Moreland in the same hall
on Wednesday/ 1 March 10, at ,8 F. M., on
"The Socialism of Christ.''
Says She Bobbed Him.
Maggie Watson was arrested on Grant
avenue yesterday on a charge of grand lar
cen*, sworn to by VV. M. Look, a stranger from
the country. Cook claims that while in the
company of the woman he was relieved of a
large sum ot money. The woman was also
charged with vagrancy.
Musicians' Union Sued.
W. J. Henderson has sued the Musicians'
Mutual Protection Union of San Francisco for
damages, because lie avers that he was ille
gally expelled from the society. He also asks
to be restored to membership.

THE FUND IS
GROWING SLOWLY
Boulevard Committees Re
quired to Work a Little
Harder.
The Cash Now in Hand Is In
sufficient for a Single
Day's Wages.
Active Preparations by the Organi
zition for Tuesday's Banefit
Entertainment.
If nothing untoward occurs in the
meantime, there should be no difficulty
experienced by the special and district re
lief committees in collecting the $5000
deemed necessary in order to justify the
commencement of work upon the boule-
yard on Monday. Ex-Mayor Ellert, who
is one of the most indefatigable members
of his particular committee, stated yes
terday that he had $400 or $500 on his
books, which should be paid in by to-day,
and expected to add $300 thereto before
Monday. It is none the less evident, how
ever, that the bulk of the work of obtain
ing subscriptions is falling upon two or
three of the many district and special
committees recently appointed. This is
the more to be regretted inasmuch as the
large commercial concerns of the City,
with few exceptions, have expressed their
willingness to help if approached indi
vidually.
The most prolific sources of supply have
scarcely been tapped as yet, and the funds
already in the hands of Daniel Meyer,
though better than nothing, are not suffi
cient to provide more than a single day's
work for the unemployed.
A united effort on tne part of all the
committees would simplify matters won
derfully, but without it nothing of a per
manently ameliorating character can be
accomplished.
Mr. Sbarboro reports considerable suc
cess among the wine and liquor dealers,
but very little has been heard as yet from
tne larger portion of the special commit
tees. A. Gerberding, C. S. Laumeister
and F. G. Waikington of the Produce Ex
change will bold a meeting on Monday.
They have assured the general relief com
mittee that there will be no difficulty in
raising a handsome appropriation.
Another suggestion has been made; it is
to make a special appeal to the school
teachers of tne City and to the Fire and
Police departments. Toere are 930 teach
ers in all, and so small a sum as $1 from
each would net a comfortable little sum
to add to the boulevard fund. If the
Board of Education offers no objection
letters will be addressed to the principals
of the different schools appointing each a
committee of one to solicit subscriptions
from the rest of the sttff. The teachers,
the Fire and Police departments, between
tneni, should easily raise $2000.
Tiie general committee also proposes to
vigorously revive Mr. Ellen's suggestion
that the wheelmen of the City should be
earnestly appealed to in the present emer
gency, and with that end in view, Henry

The unemployed at the armory are
taking an active interest in Tuesday even
ing's benefit concert at the Auditorium.
A t^ang of men was engaged yesterday in
thoroughly cleaning the interior of the
theater, and arrangements are well ad
vanced for a grand parade on Tuesday
afternoon, designed to advertise the en
tertainment in every popular quarter of
the City. Something like 3000 tickets are
in the hands of energetic agents and it is
expected that a goodly proportion of this
number will be disposed of. '
The members of the family relief com
mittee expressed the hope yesterday that
as many women as possible will tina it
convenient to take part in the parade, so
that the well-to-do public may realize the
extent of tue present distress.
The Gas and Electric Light Company
have kindly undertaken to illuminate the
Auditorium on Tuesday evening free of
charge. -
The family relief committee is so over
burdened with applications for assistance
that it has been compelled to stop issuing
fresh cards until the cases now on hand,
amounting to 52 in all, are disposed of.
No less than 37 individual cases and seven
families were - relieved up to 4 o'clocc
yesterday.
Some misapprehension seems to exist as
to the manner in which application cards
should be filled out. It is not sufficient
for the applicant to suppy his own name
and residence; he or she must also obtain
the indorsement of at least one reference
before the committee will consider the
application.
The commissariat and clothing depart
ment is greatly in need of meat, bread,
sugar, shoes and underclothing. Arch
bi^nop Riordan's generous donation ar
rived Thursday evening just iv time to
relieve the scarcity of provisions. It com
prised eight sacks of flour, two sacks of
potatoes, eight Bucks of beans, a sack of
sugar, sack of coffee and twenty-five
pounds oi tea. G. Lemaruty of 418 Turk
street contributed six new suits of clothes
yesterday and S. A. Leffingwell, the chair
man of the organization, supplied two
blankets, a quilt, some cooking utensils
and a sack ot beans.
The cash receipts yesterday were $25 55.
fOE THE UNEMPLOYED.
The Labor Council Will Confer With
the Mayor.
At a meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council last nigbt Delegate McArthur
made a motion ihat the executive com
mittee be appointed as a committee to wait
upon Mayor Phelan on the subject of
doing something to aid the unemployed.
The question was discussed at some
length and tinaliy passed with an amend
ment that the sum oi $10 be appropriated
for the relief of those now idle in San
Francisco.
"It is not charity that we want," said
Dsiegate McArtnnr, "out some system by
which the unemployed may receive reg
ular employment from the municipality.

about two-thirds cultivated, and there

RELIEF FOR INDIA.
A Generous Offer of a Cargo
of Grain From Nebraska
Received.
Rev. R G. Hobbs, an Illinois Minis*
ter, Says He Can Fill a Ship
With Breadstuff;.
The prospects of a shipload of bread
stuffs being shipped from this City to the
India sufferers were never brighter than
they are at present, if the promise im
plied in a telegram received yesterday by
Dr. W. 8. Matthews, editor ot the Cali
fornia Christian Advocate, can be relied
upon.
The author of the telegram is Rev. R. G.
Hobba, pastor ot the Centenary Methodist
Episcopal Church of Jacksonville.
Dr. Hobbs stated that he had, in con
nection with others, been agitating relief
measures for the India sufferers, and had
succeeded in getting quite large subscrip
tions of cereals. He stated he had reacheti
the conclusion that it was much more
practical to shin by way of San Francisco
than via New York, and he requested in
formation an to the facilities for freÂ«
transportation from the Middle States
here.
Mayor Phnlan last night expressed the
opinion that the local relief committee
would handle the grain if the offer proved
genuine, and that there would r>e no
difficulty experienced in getting the
transportation.
